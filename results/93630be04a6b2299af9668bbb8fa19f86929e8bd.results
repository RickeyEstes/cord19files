During the study period, there were a total of 12 Southern Chinese patients with SARS admitted to 5 public hospitals in Hong Kong (Table I) . The maternal age ranged between 27 to 44 years. There were 5 health care workers and 7 others who acquired the disease in the community. Seven women were less than 13 weeks of gestation (3-12 weeks) and the other 5 patients were in their late second and third trimesters at presentation. None of the patients had underlying medical disease. All patients had high fevers (O38(C) and most presented with chill, rigors, malaise, and myalgia. Only 33% of the pregnant patients presented with shortness of breath. Physical examination of the chest revealed crackles with or without percussion dullness. Lymphopenia (!1.0!10 9 /L) was observed in 8 patients at presentation, but subsequently all had lymphopenia develop. Some patients had mildly elevated lactate dehydrogenase (5/12) and aminotransferase (4/12) levels. Serial chest radiographs showed progressive air-space disease in all patients, similar to those reported earlier in nonpregnant patients. 6 There was no evidence of infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, or Legionella pneumophila. Viral serology for adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza type 1 to 3, and respiratory syncytial virus were negative. All patients had either positive SARS-CoV RT-PCRs or raised SARS-CoV antibody titers (O100). Patient 7 was retrospectively diagnosed to have SARS. She is a health care worker and had cared for a patient with atypical pneumonia from Guangdong Province, China, before the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong. She subsequently had a high fever and atypical pneumonia develop 5 days later. All patients were given broad-spectrum antibiotics, namely, beta-lactams and macrolides or fluoro-quinolones. All patients, except patient 7, were given ribavirin and/ or hydrocortisone after 48 hours of observation. All couples were fully informed of the potential teratogenic effect of ribavirin and all opted to receive this treatment. Ten patients also had 1 or more courses of pulse methyl-prednisolone as described in previous publications. 8 The fever lasted between 2 and 9 days. Five patients had high fevers develop again after initial response. Six patients (50%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) because of decreased blood oxygen saturation. The length of stay ranged from 14 to 37 days. Four patients (33%) required mechanical ventilation ranging from 16 to 37 days. After ribavirin therapy all patients became anemic (Hb !10g/dL). The major medical complications among these patients included disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (patients 3, 8, and 12), renal failure (patients 3, 9, and 12), secondary bacterial pneumonia (patients 3 and 12), sepsis (patients 11 and 12), adult respiratory distress syndrome (patients 3, 10, 11, and 12), cardiovascular collapse (patient 11), abdominal wound dehiscence (patients 11 and 12), and surgical emphysema (patient 12). Three deaths occurred of which 2 patients (patients 3 and 11) died of progressive respiratory failure and 1 patient (patient 12) died of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia associated with cardiovascular collapse not responsive to active resuscitation. Six of the 7 women (except patient 7) presenting in the first trimester had positive pregnancy tests during hospital admission. Five women (patients 2-6) had ultrasound confirmation of an intrauterine gestational sac. In these, absence of fetal pole was noted in 3 women (patients 2, 3, and 4) and a single fetal pole with fetal heart pulsation was detected in 2 (patients 5 and 6). Ultrasound failed to demonstrate an intrauterine sac in 1 woman (patient 1) and she did not have any sign or symptom of ectopic pregnancy or spontaneous miscarriage. Serial serum human chorionic gonadotrophins rapidly decreased and she was considered to have a very early pregnancy loss. Myalgia  NA, Not applicable; SOB, shortness of breath; CXR, chest X-ray; CT, computed tomograph; IV, intravenous. Four of the 7 patients presented in first trimester had spontaneous miscarriages between 2 to 5 weeks after the onset of illness (Table II) . Patient 7 did not receive ribavirin or steroid and has an uncomplicated ongoing pregnancy. Patients 5 and 6 had termination of pregnancies at 10 weeks and 15 weeks of gestation for social reasons after they had recovered from SARS. Gestation at presentation for the other 5 patients ranged from 26 to 32 weeks. Four pregnancies (80%) resulted in preterm delivery. Three patients were delivered by emergency cesarean section between 26 and 32 weeks of gestation because of maternal deterioration, secondary to failure to maintain adequate blood oxygen saturation, despite on 100% oxygen (patients 10 to 12). Patient 10 also had fetal distress develop before cesarean section. After delivery, the need for supplemental oxygen was reduced in all mothers. One patient was extubated 20 hours after delivery, but she was reintubated 32 hours later for oxygen desaturation again. The ventilator settings for the other 2 patients were unchanged after delivery. Two pregnancies (patients 8 and 9) that did not require early intervention had intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) develop during treatment. Both pregnancies were also complicated by oligohydramnios. Fetal surveillance with antenatal CTG and umbilical arterial Doppler velocimetry was satisfactory. Patient 8 had spontaneous preterm labor at 33 weeks of gestation during the convalescence period, which did not respond to tocolysis. Patient 9 had emergency lower-segment cesarean section for intrapartum nonreassuring CTG. There was no clinical or serologic evidence suggestive of vertical transmission of the coronavirus (Table III) . To date, none of the 5 newborn infants show any evidence of perinatal SARS infection. In particular, the first 3 newborn infants (newborn infants 3-5) were delivered during the acute stage of maternal SARS infection and were exposed to a significant risk of perinatal infection. Peritoneal fluid (patient 10) and samples of body fluid were positive for SARS-CoV at the time of cesarean section. The SARS-CoV RT-PCRs and viral cultures from nasal swab, blood, urine, and stool were all negative in these infants. There was also no significant rise in paired acute and convalescent SARS-CoV antibody titers. Three newborn infants delivered soon after the mothers presented with SARS were average in size, whereas the other 2 were growth restricted with birth weight below the fifth percentile for gestation. Of the newborn infants delivered preterm, 2 had serious complications develop related to prematurity (Table III) . RT-PCRs and viral cultures of the cord blood and placenta tissues were all negative for SARS-CoV. Amniotic fluid obtained from patients 5, 6, and 9 were also negative for SARS-CoV. No viral inclusion body or particle was detected in the products of conceptions. The placental findings from the 5 deliveries are summarized in Table III . All the placentae showed trimmed weight falling short of the fifth percentile for gestation, with a weight deficiency of 8% to 47%. Three placentae (patients 10 to 12) had normal histopathologic findings. Two placentae from pregnancies (patients 8 and 9) complicated by IUGR showed avascular fibrotic terminal villi with thrombotic vasculopathy in some stem villi. In addition, placental infarction was evident grossly and on histology in the placenta of patient 9. The percentage of infarcted placental tissue was estimated to be about 10%. No placentae showed chorioamnionitis, funisitis, villitis, viral inclusion, or other features of infection. No significant erythroblastosis was noted.
