3.1. Experiment 1: toxicity of QR448(a) in cell culture and in embryonating eggs, and effect on IBV in vitro Undiluted and a 1 × 10 −1 dilution of QR448(a) was toxic to Vero E6 cells and cells inoculated with a 1 × 10 −2 dilution of QR448(a) had CPE affecting about 50% of the monolayer. Cells inoculated with a 1 × 10 −3 dilution or higher of QR448(a) were unaffected at 7 days post-treatment. The Vero E6 cells inoculated with undiluted and a 1 × 10 −1 dilution of the diluent had CPE in >90% of the cells, whereas cells inoculated with higher dilutions of diluent did not have any CPE following 7 days of incubation. None of the negative control cells had CPE. Disregarding embryo deaths within 24 h of inoculation, none of the embryonating eggs died during the course of the experiment. At 7 days post-treatment, none of the embryos that received QR448(a) or the embryos that received diluent had gross lesions. As expected, none of the negative control embryos had lesions. To determine the decrease in titer of infectious virus, we examined the effect of QR448(a) on IBV (Beaudette strain) as determined by titration in Vero E6 cells and the data are presented in Fig. 1 . Treatment with QR448(a) at a 1 × 10 −3 dilution reduced the titer of IBV from an average of 1 × 10 3.0 to 1 × 10 0.8 TCID 50 /ml. Treatment at a dilution of 1 × 10 −4 reduced the IBV titer from 1 × 10 3.0 to 5 × 10 2.0 TCID 50 /ml. None of the dilutions of QR448(a) higher than 1 × 10 −4 reduced the titer of IBV. No reduction in virus titer was observed for the diluent at any dilution and, none of the cells in the negative control wells (cell culture maintenance medium alone) had CPE (data not shown). Data showing the effect of QR448(a) on IBV (Beaudette strain) as determined by titration in embryonating eggs also measured the decrease of infectious virus and the data are presented in Fig. 1 . Titration of IBV Beaudette strain in Vero E6 cells following treatment with 10-fold serial dilutions of QR448(a) starting at 1 × 10 −3 to 1 × 10 −9 in cell culture maintenance medium and cell culture maintenance medium plus IBV alone (control) are presented. The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) titers reflect the average of three replicates. No reduction in virus titer was observed for IBV treated with the diluent (data not shown). Fig. 2 . Treatment with undiluted QR448(a) reduced the titer of IBV from 1 × 10 4 to 1 × 10 2 EID 50 /ml. Dilutions of QR448(a) at 1 × 10 −1 and 1 × 10 −2 reduced the titer of IBV from 1 × 10 4 to 1 × 10 1.7 and 1 × 10 3 EID 50 /ml respectively. No reduction in IBV titer was observed when dilutions of QR448(a) from 1 × 10 −3 to 1 × 10 −7 were used or when the diluent at any dilution was used. The lesions in the embryos, were typical of those reported for IBV (Gelb and Jackwood, 2008) .
