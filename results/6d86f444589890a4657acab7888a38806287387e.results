From four well-managed Danish conventional pig farms a total of 201 ileal and colonic intestinal content samples indicate a significant effect of interaction (Table 3) . Species mark with † are not consistent findings. # Estimated fold changes for this category are calculated as: γ percentage points , where the parameter y from column 8 is the estimate of the exponential eβ of the estimated effect parameter β for diarrhoea in formula (1). The diarrhoeic percentage points range from 0 to 100. This table is an extension of Table 2 , and the estimated fold changes are the estimates of the exponentiated effect parameter. were collected from 50 control piglets without NNPD and 52 case piglets suffering from NNPD (3 samples were lost between sampling and the laboratory). Of the case piglets, 25 were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics intramuscularly, depending on their diagnosis and according to herd treatment practices. Piglets were three to seven days old and were all reared with their biological dam and siblings [15] . A bacterial taxonomic profile was obtained from both gut sections of each animal using the Gut Microbiotassay targeting rRNA genes of major bacterial groups in the mammalian intestine. Normalized Cq data were used for PCA. After excluding the primer sets with less than 50% recorded Cq values ("Class Epsilonproteobacteria", "Phylum Verrucomicrobia", and "Domain Archaea"), as well as the "Domain Bacteria A" and "Domain Bacteria B" primer sets (which did not contribute any information to the PCA analysis), 19 primer sets remained for the data analysis. In addition, 12 samples were removed from the dataset as a consequence of having too few Cq registrations. From the PCA scores plot (see Figure 1 , for further information on the major principal components in the PCA see Additional file 2), four case animals (three of which were treated with antibiotics) and four control animals were randomly chosen to be representatives for their respective herds. Detailed taxonomic information was acquired for these 16 samples using 454 next generation sequencing.
