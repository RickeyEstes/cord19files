A specific positive reaction was observed only in FIP-specific granulomas (Fig. l) , either in macrophages or in necrotic areas. In a single cat positive monocytes could be seen intravascularly in blood vessels of the choroid plexus of the brain. The reaction was granular in appearance and varied from being very intense and occurring in most macrophages of a given granuloma, to being so inconspicuous that it was seen only in a few cells and was detectable only when using the high-power objective (40 X 1. The reaction pattern did not differ between the monoclonal antibody 631 and the polyclonal feline ascites antibodies. A positive reaction was obtained in 100 of the 102 cats with FIP; 98 cats were positive with the monoclonal antibody 631 as well as with the polyclonal feline ascites antibodies, while one cat each was positive only with one of the two types of antibodies used in this study. None of the cats without FIP investigated in this study (two with lymphosarcoma, two with adenocarcinoma metastasizing in the peritoneal cavity, one with hepatocellular adenoma and interstitial nephritis, one with necrotizing pancreatitis) exhibited any positive reaction. Positive staining of formalinfixed specimens was dependent on use of buffered formalin and pretreatment with trypsin. Demasking of the epitope identified by the monoclonal antibody was best achieved after 90 min of trypsinization. We could not demonstrate coronavirus antigen in epithelial cells of the intestinal tract in cats that had died of FIP. In one cat the intestinal epithelium was coronavirus antigen-negative in an area where immunohistologically positive FIP granulomas in the intestinal wall had ulcerated into the lumen of the intestine, and where shedding of FIPV in the direct vicinity of epithelial cells would have been expected. The nicitating membranes of 25 cats that had died of FIP and that were immunohistologically positive in granulomas at other locations were examined for FIP antigen. Twenty-two were completely negative. Two cats exhibited positive macrophages in tiny granulomas in the mesenchyma but the epithelial cells were negative. One cat showed a positive reaction in epithelial cells which was also present, however, in the control incubations and thus was not regarded as FIP-specific.
