Seventeen morphologic categories of normal or damaged cells were distinguished (Table 2). The undamaged ciliated, serous, basal, intermediate, brush and migratory cells were identified by standard criteria (Jeffery and Reid, 1975; Plopper et al., 1983; Pearsall et al., 1984) . Damaged ciliated cells were cate-gorized as those with short or damaged cilia or as degenerate, or necrotic cells. Short-cilia cells were cells with cilia of uniform but less than 2.9 pm length, with no other evidence of injury. There were no apparent differences in the density or basal body structure of these cilia compared to those of undamaged ciliated cells. Damaged-cilia cells had sparse, broken, irregular cilia. Cells with apical basal bodies, arranged either regularly or irregularly, but lacking cilia were also placed in this category. Degenerate cells were those with several membrane-bound cytoplasmic vacuoles which measured greater than 1 pm in observed cross section. They contained electron-dense material and resembled autophagosomes, multivesicular bodies, or residual bodies. Cells with electron-dense, condensed nuclei and extremely electron-dense or vacuolated and lucent staining cytoplasm were identified as necrotic cells and categorized according to cell type, unless they lacked discernible identifying features in which case they were labeled unidentified necrotic cells. Occasional cells with only a small nuclear profile, little or no cytoplasm, and lacking distinguishing features were categorized as unidentified cells. Necrotic cells which were located along the luminal surface of the epithelium, but not within the epithelium, were counted separately as sloughed cells. Many of these sloughed cells had features (cilia, basal bodies, nuclear characteristics) which identified them as ciliated cells, but not all sloughed cells could be identified as to cell type. After the 24-hr explant exposures no material resembling secretory product was seen still attached to the luminal surface. The epithelia of the tracheal explants from the O3 preexposure group exposed to 3 ppm O3 in culture had a ciliated surface and the majority of ciliated cells were undamaged (Fig. 1 ). Occasional ciliated cells had uniformly short cilia, and lesser numbers of ciliated cells had irregular, broken cilia or evidence of degenerative changes.

In contrast, ciliated cells were rare in the epithelia of the explants from the FA preexposure group exposed to 3 ppm 0s in culture, and approximately 50% of the ciliated cells had irregular broken cilia or degenerative changes. These epithelia also exhibited more frequent necrotic cells and sloughed cells were present only in this group (Fig. 2) . No short cilia were present in these epithelia. Quantitation of cell types and cell damage revealed several significant differences between the FA preexposure group and the O3 preexposure group in the response of the tracheal epithelium to 0s exposure in vitro (Table 2). Two of the most striking differences were in the number of necrotic cells (Fig. 3) FIG. 1.

Ciliated cells (c), serous cells (s), and basal cells (b). This epithelium is indistinguishable from that of rats preexposed to filtered air for 60 days followed by explant exposure to 0 ppm Or. The surface is ciliated and there is no evidence of ciliary or epithelial damage. and in the number of sloughed cells. The other major change was the significant decrease in the numerical density of ciliated cells in the epithelia from the FA preexposure group. In order to express the degree of ciliated cell damage relative to the population at risk, the ratio of abnormal ciliated cells (short-cilia, damaged-cilia, degenerate, and necrotic ciliated cells) to the total ciliated cell population was calculated (Fig. 4) . This ratio is significantly greater in the FA preexposure group compared to the O3 preexposure group. The large proportion of ciliated cells damaged by the explant O3 exposure in the FA preexposed group is especially apparent when the existence of the short-cilia cells in the O3 preexposed epithelia is taken into account (Fig. 4) . The results of the two control group exposures (0, preexposure followed by explant 0 ppm O3 exposure and FA preexposure followed by explant 0 ppm 0) exposure) showed no significant difference between these two groups in the total number of ciliated cells, but there was a significant number of short-cilia cells in the O3 preexposure group. Occasional damaged-cilia cells were present, but their numbers were low relative to the total population of ciliated cells. Necrotic cells of any type were rare in both of these groups, and there were no sloughed cells.
