Identification of polymorphisms in DPP4 that alter amino acid residues which make contact with MERS-CoV S The binding interface between MERS-CoV S and the cellular receptor DPP4 was resolved by Wang and colleagues using crystallography, revealing the interacting amino acid residues for each binding partner [16] : Fourteen residues of MERS-CoV S (Y499, N501, K502, L506, D510, R511, E513, D537 G538, D539, Y540, R542, W553 and V555) interact with a total of fifteen residues in DPP4 (K267, F269, Q286, T288, A289, A291, L294, I295, H298, R317, Y322, R336, Q344, I346 and K392) [16] , which are distributed over the glycosylation-rich domain and the cysteinerich domain ( Figure 1A-C) . In order to identify polymorphic residues in DPP4 that contact MERS-CoV S, we screened public databases that provide information on polymorphic amino acid residues based on data derived from different bio projects (i.e. gnomAD, TOPMed, ExAC, 1000G; more information is given in the Materials and Methods section). By this method we found that nine out of the fifteen DPP4 residues interacting with MERS-CoV S are polymorphic (K267, Q286, T288, A289, A291, R317, Y322, I346 and K392) ( Figure 1C ). While five of these residues can be replaced by only a single different amino acid residue (Q286[K], A289 . Circles with sticks represent glycosylation sites, while small numbers indicate the amino acid residues. Triangles below the domains highlight the positions of amino acid residues that directly interact with MERS-CoV S (grey triangles mark residues for which no polymorphism has been reported, while red triangles indicate polymorphic residues). (B) Side (left) and top (right) view of homodimeric DPP4 (the dotted line indicates the border between the two monomers and the cellular plasma membrane is schematically depicted below the side view model of DPP4). The protein model was constructed on the published crystal structure (4PV7) deposited in RSCB PDB and the binding interface with MERS-CoV S has been highlighted (green). (C) Close-up on the DPP4 residues that directly interact with MERS-CoV S and for which no polymorphic (yellow) or polymorphic (red) residues have been reported. In addition, the specific residues in DPP4 (regular letters and numbers), including the respective polymorphic residues (letters in brackets), and the corresponding interacting residues in MERS-CoV S (italicized letters and numbers) are indicated. (D) Frequency of polymorphic DPP4 residues in the human population. Public databases (see Supplementary Table 1 and the materials and methods section for detailed information) were screened for the frequency of the polymorphic residues under study (y-axis). Error bars indicate standard error of the mean (SEM) and refer to polymorphic residues found in more than one database. Table 1 ). Finally, the frequency of these polymorphisms in the human population is low, ranging roughly from 1:19,000 (A289V) to 1:245,000 (T288I) ( Figure 1D and Supplementary Table 1 ).
