Large-scale RSV whole-genome sequencing from Nashville, Tennessee. The INSPIRE cohort includes term infants born in June through December such that they are on average less than 6 months of age during the RSV season. The INSPIRE study design included surveillance and collection of nasal wash samples for infants meeting pre-specified respiratory illness criteria occurring from November 1 st to March 31 st 25 . A total of 861 nasal wash samples from infants collected in the 2012-2013 season with acute respiratory tract infections were screened for RSV using qRT-PCR. Out of 210 RSV-positive samples, 106 samples from 99 patients were selected for whole-genome sequencing based on disease severity and quality of virus detection by qRT-PCR ct value (< 29) . Characteristics of these study subjects are in Table 1 . Five infants had RSV isolated during two illnesses and one patient had RSV isolated during three illnesses during the 2012-2013 season. Of the 106 RSV-positive study samples from the 2012-2013 season, 71 RSV whole-genome sequences were obtained, annotated, and submitted to GenBank using an overlapping amplicon-based sequencing approach. Partial genome sequences, obtained from three additional samples that contained gaps and lower coverage areas, were removed from the dataset. In addition, we attempted to sequence 24 RSV-positive samples from the 2013-2014 season, out of which 21 whole-genome sequences were obtained. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate multiple co-circulating RSV lineages in a given season. A maximum likelihood phylogeny that combined the RSV-A and RSV-B lineages was generated using whole-genome sequences from 474 publicly available sequences and the 71 study genomes from the 2012-2013 season (Fig. S1) . A subset of these genomes was used to infer a maximum likelihood phylogeny using only the G gene coding sequence, and a similar topology was obtained (Fig. S2 ). The 71 study genomes segregated into three separate clades: BA RSV-B (seven genomes), GA5 RSV-A (five genomes), and GA2 RSV-A (59 genomes). Recent isolates of the RSV-A clade GA2.1 (a continuation of the GA2 clade) were further divided into three monophyletic groups, with 35 genomes representing the genotype ON1, 22 genomes representing a new group of viruses specific to the study samples from Tennessee that we named genotype TN1, and two genomes with sequences proximal to the divergence point of GA2.1, which we have named genotype TN2 in the context of this study. Both TN1 and TN2 genotypes are supported by Bayesian posterior probabilities of 1 and ML bootstrap values between 99-100%. These findings confirmed co-circulation of multiple RSV clades and genotypes in a given season in the same geographical location. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses provide estimates of RSV evolutionary dynamics. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were constructed using G gene analyses for both RSV-A and RSV-B (Fig. 1) . In addition, Bayesian phylogenies using a subset of available GenBank whole genomes, including genomes sequenced by us, were inferred using each individual RSV gene, as well as using the whole genome; these analyses provided substitution rates similar to those reported in previous studies 6, 9 for all RSV genes (Fig. 2) . In particular, we observed a high substitution rate and a Bayesian highest posterior density (HPD) interval of substitution within the SH gene of RSV-B, similar to previous reports (Table 2) 6, 9 . The mean estimates of the times to most recent common ancestors (tMRCAs) for the whole-genome dataset suggest that circulating and historical RSV-A lineages share a common ancestor from around 1951 (95% HPD, 1937 HPD, -1964 , and RSV-B likely diverged in 1967 (95% HPD, 1964-1970) based on available whole-genome dataset. Comparing RSV-B G gene phylogenies from our whole-genome dataset to the G gene phylogenies that contain more extensive sampling of all available GenBank full G gene sequences (Fig. S3) indicates that the whole-genome dataset is missing diversity that exists within several RSV-B clades. Further analysis using Bayesian Tip-association Significance (BaTS) detected that global and local circulation patterns exist. BaTS testing of the RSV-A G gene phylogeny resulted in AI and PS scores of 0.0 and MC scores of 0.009 for the global and local state assignments. The PS and AI scores indicate an overall non-random association of local and global assignments with the phylogenies tested, whereas the MC result indicates the local state is specifically associated with the topologies of the phylogenies tested. Because these results are less than 0.01, they provide strong evidence for these states being topologically associated with the Bayesian phylogenies. No significant correlations were found between RSV disease severity and phylogenetic topologies using BaTS analysis. Glycosylation sequon analysis reveals sub-clade specific glycosylation patterns in the G protein. Results of NetNGlyc across all study samples show that the N-linked glycosylation sequons in the F gene are relatively conserved. Nearly all of the RSV-A and RSV-B samples have the same N-linked sites (residues 27, 70, 116, 120, and 126) within the F2 domain. However, N-linked glycosylation sequons in the G gene appear to follow a genotype specific pattern, with multiple glycosylation patterns co-circulating simultaneously. Genotype ON1 shows three predicted N-linked glycosylation sites; clades TN1, TN2, and GA5 have five, four, and five sites, respectively (Fig. 3) . RSV-B genomes show two different glycosylation patterns. Genotype BA.1 has four glycosylation sites, three of which are consistent with the majority of circulating RSV-B BA.1 genomes. Genotype BA.2 shows a novel RSV-B glycosylation pattern with just one glycosylation site present toward the C-terminal end of the G protein after the G duplication. Similarly, NetOGlyc shows that the O-linked glycosylation patterns for the G protein follow a genotype-specific pattern as well. Seven distinct O-linked patterns are observed in the G protein sequences from our study cohort. Genotype ON1 shows 85 predicted O-linked glycosylation sites, whereas genotype TN1 has 74 and 83 sites (in non-duplicated and duplicated genomes, respectively), genotype TN2 has 74 sites, and genotype GA5 has 72 sites. RSV-B genomes show two different O-linked glycosylation patterns, with 82 sites for genotype BA.1 and 85 sites for genotype BA.2. There were no significant numbers of O-linked glycans predicted for the F protein. Consensus genotype-specific glycosylation patterns were plotted for visual analysis for the G protein (Fig. 3) .
