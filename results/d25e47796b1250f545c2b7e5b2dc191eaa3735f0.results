We successfully amplified all but one gene (cfrA) from the genomic DNA of Camyplobacter jejuni. All eleven genes that were successfully amplified showed the correct length (see Figure 3 ) and were subsequently cloned to KRX single-step competent cells. The correct insert size was determined by Colony PCR. Plasmids from clones containing the correct-sized inserts were isolated and the MCS was sequenced using both a forward and a reverse primer (HT7 For and Flexi R). During cloning an extra GTT, which encodes for a valine residue in the proteins' primary structures, was inserted immediately prior to each stop codon. As a universal stop codon TAA was used, replacing other stop codons if present. This was mainly done to gain maximum flexibility during cloning as the Flexi vector system enables the direct transfer to other vectors with different tags. A GTT is mandatory to later transfer the gene of interest to a vector encoding a C-terminal tag. For that reason, no 100% identity can be observed, when comparing the sequencing results with the original gene sequences from EMBL using a global alignment with free-end gaps. Nine of the plasmids differed only in the additional GTT mentioned above. For pyrC the usual stop codon TGA was replaced by TAA causing minor discrepancy in the alignment. The longest gene under investigation, flaA demonstrated the least conformity to the respective sequence from EMBL. The length of each sequence reaction was approximately 1300 nucleotides. Due to the numerous alterations in the sequence causing a shift in amino acid sequence, flaA was omitted from future investigation. The correct expression of the encoded fusion proteins was assessed by SDS-Page. Analyzing the gel under fluorescent conditions reveals protein bands which have the HaloTag ® ligand attached. The PageRuler Plus prestained Protein ladder possesses two fluorescent bands, at 25 and 70 kDa respectively. HaloTag ® Standard Protein with a Figure 1 Detection of immunogenic proteins on microarrays. The cell lysates are spotted onto HaloLink™ slides (shaded area) with immobilized ligand (curved lines). The HaloTag ® (pink sector) is fused to the N-terminus of the protein of interest (purple sector) and attaches covalently to the ligand. Thus, the protein of interest is covalently attached to the surface prior to screening, whereas other proteins from the cell lysate are unbound and washed away after the coupling reaction. Subsequently, primary antibodies (blue) bind to the protein of interest. Afterwards, secondary antibodies (black) conjugated with a fluorophore (yellow) bind to the respective primary antibody. The fluorescent dye is used for detection of positive spots identifying sites of potential immunogenic proteins in the process. size of 60 kDa was also analyzed and helps as an additional size reference. The HaloTag ® features a size of 34 kDa alone. For ease of use and brevity the expressed proteins are abbreviated and referred to as their corresponding gene names in plain text, e.g. pseB as the protein encoded by the gene pseB. Full protein names for each gene as taken from the KEGG database can be found in Table 1 . Most of the fusion proteins investigated fall into a range between 61 and 73 kDa, namely HaloTag ® fused to argC (73 kDa), pyrC (72 kDa), pseB (71 kDa), gapA (70 kDa), cjaA (65 kDa), peb1 (62 kDa), hisJ (62 kDa) and flaC (61 kDa). Outside of this size range, only HaloTag ® -flaA (93 kDa) and the small HaloTag ® -pal (52 kDa) are found. For each protein, bands with the correct size could be detected, see Figure 4 . Additionally, bands of smaller size are visible (34 kDA) which might be due to untimely termination of translation, potentially comprising only the HaloTag ® , which features the corresponding size. The cell lysates containing the expressed fusion proteins were spotted to HaloLink™ Slides (Promega) by the QArray2 microarray spotter. For the spotting layout see Figure 5 . The immunogenicity of the immobilized proteins was assessed using polyclonal antibodies raised against whole and partially lysed attenuated cells of Campylobacter jejuni. Secondary antibodies conjugated with a fluorophore were used to detect signals. For better comparability the raw data was processed and contrast values were calculated. Figure 6 shows the resulting bar chart of the processed data of one slide. Four proteins showed contrast values above the cutoff. The contrast values ± s.d. for each of these proteins were 0.63 ± 0.17 (cjaA), 0.47 ± 0.10 (hisJ), 0.35 ± 0.05 (flaC) and 0.68 ± 0.15 (peb1a) respectively. In comparison, the contrast values of the following proteins were significantly below the cutoff: 0.06 ± 0.20 (gapA), 0.08 ± 0.15 (pyrC) and 0.09 ± 0.04 (argC). The last two proteins -pal and pseB -led to contrast values of 0.17 ± 0.11 (pal) and 0.25 ± 0.05 (pseB), which albeit closer are still slightly below the cutoff of 0.25. Subsequently clones are cultivated, protein expression is induced and finally cells are lysed. The whole lysates can directly be spotted to the HaloLink™ Arrays rendering additional time-consuming and costly purification steps obsolete. As only fusion proteins will bind to the ligand, remaining proteins from the lysates are simply washed off after spotting minimizing background and crossreactivity during the subsequent screening steps. The microarray platform allows for several thousand spots per slide allowing for easy high-throughput screening applications. Table 2 for expected gene lengths. As markers Hyper Ladder I (M) and II (M2) were used both supplied by Bioline. To validate the results from one slide technical replicates (n = 5) were analyzed. Summing up the results of all slides, a box-whisker-plot was composed, see Figure  7 . The replicates emphasized the results from the one slide above. CjaA, hisJ, flaC and peb1a were clearly above the respective cutoffs and led to positive signals in all the slides. On the contrary, gapA, argC and pyrC were significantly below the cutoff. The tendency of pal and pseB to fall within close proximity of the cutoff is observed throughout the replicates. Further verification of the results was performed by using a standard western blot experiment to test for immunogenicity. Figure 8 shows the results of the investigated proteins after purification with HaloLink™ magnetic beads was performed prior to SDS-PAGE and blotting. Only two of the investigated immunogenic proteins (cjaA, and hisJ) show strong visible bands in western blot matching the expected sizes. The three remaining immunogenic proteins, peb1a, flaC and pal, The full names of each protein investigated are given according to the KEGG database with their coding genes. The gene names were used as abbreviations for the proteins in this paper cannot be distinguished in western blot analysis as well as all the other proteins. Additionally, a Dotblot was performed ( Figure 9 ) with the purified proteins, which showed clear positive signals for cjaA and hisJ, a rather weak signal for peb1a and extremely low signals for flaC and pal. In contrast, Figure 10 shows a western blot performed directly with whole lysates after recombinant expression without further purification. At least four bands are visible in all the samples with the most prominent band at 70 kDa. Bands of lower intensity appear at approximately 55 kDa, 28 kDa and 18 kDa. The first five lanes, corresponding to the known immunogenic proteins, cjaA, hisJ, peb1a, flaC and pal, show bands of higher intensity than the remaining five lanes. However, as the investigated fusion proteins fall either into the 70 kDa or in case of HT-pal into the 55 kDa range, a clear differentiation between positive bands and background caused by KRX cross-reactive proteins is hardly possible.
