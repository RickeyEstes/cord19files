Acute encephalomyelitis Suckling mice born to unimmunized mothers infected intranasally with MHV-JHM (5 x 10' PFU) at 10 days of age developed an acute encephalomyelitis with all mice dying by 7 days post-inoculation (Fig . 1) . Clinical signs including hunching, ruffled fur, irritability and lethargy. Three of 12 mice developed these signs within 3 days of inoculation, whereas the remaining 9/12 did so within the following 4 days . Virus titers in the brains of infected animals at 3 and 5 days post-inoculation were approximately 4 x 10 3 and 2 x 10' PFU/g respectively (Table 1 ) , and viral antigen could be found throughout the brain parenchyma (Table 2 ), in both the grey and white matter, particularly at day 5 post-inoculation . Histological examination of the brain at 3 days post-inoculation revealed a small amount of leptomeningeal infiltration whereas at 5 days post-inoculation it showed an acute encephalitis, including perivascular, parenchymal and leptomeningeal inflammatory infiltrates, and proliferating astrocytes and microglia surrounding neurons (glial stars) . Antibody protected mice : clinical studies If female mice were immunized prior to mating, the offspring were completely protected against the acute, fatal encephalomyelitis in agreement with published results ." In our experiments, female mice were immunized with MHV-JHM in Freund's adjuvant five times . Resulting antibody titers ranged from 1 :700 to 1 :4300 (mean 1 :2700) by plaque-reduction neutralization assay (Fig . 2) . The offspring were infected intranasally at 10 days of age with the same dose of virus (5x10' PFU) that caused the acute encephalomyelitis in the offspring of unimmunized mothers . As shown in Fig . 1 , 100% of the suckling mice survived the infection, and none developed any signs of clinical disease during the first few weeks following virus inoculation . In the period 3-8 weeks after inoculation (mean : 35 d, range 23-60 d), 40% (12/30) of the mice developed a neurological illness characterized by hindlimb paralysis . The clinical disease was variable in the rapidity with which hindlimb paresis progressed to complete paralysis . In some degeneration . Virus could be cultured from brains and spinal cords but not livers at this time (Table 1 ) . Using an immunoperoxidase assay, viral antigen was detected throughout the brain in both the grey and white matter in the cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem . No viral antigen could be detected in the spinal cord at this time ( Table  2) Day 7 : On histological examination, the brains of mice 7 days after inoculation showed evidence of meningoencephalitis (Fig . 3) , although the mice were totally asymptomatic . There were perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and widespread, focal petechiae throughout the grey and white matter . Subependymal and meningeal infiltrates were also present . The cerebrum was heavily involved, with fewer inflammatory cells present in the hippocampus . Glial stars, similar to those seen in the acutely-infected mice, were present in the cerebral cortex adjacent to injured neurons . Lymphocytic infiltrates were also apparent in the diencephalon and pons, with minimal involvement of the cerebellum . The liver showed evidence of viral infection also, with a few areas of lymphocytic infiltration in a nodular pattern apparent, although infectious virus was not present . Viral antigen could be readily detected throughout the grey and white matter of the brain by immunocytochemical analysis of frozen sections and was also observed in scattered foci in a few of the spinal cords of these mice (Table 2 ) . Virus could be cultured from the brain at seven days after inoculation in 1 of 6 mice examined (Table 1) . Day 14 : By 14 days after inoculation, the brains showed much less evidence of disease on histological examination . No meningeal infiltration was present and only a small amount of lymphocytic proliferation was apparent in the grey and white matter of the parenchyma . Viral antigen could be detected by immunoperoxidase assay in scattered cells of the brains and spinal cords of two of three mice examined ( Table 2) . Many of the cells containing antigen were not in areas of cellular infiltration . Virus could be cultured at low titer from the brains of one of six mice assayed at this time (Table 1 ), but not from the liver or spinal cord . Day 30 post-inoculation and longer in mice without neurological disease : Histological examination of the brains of mice without neurological disease at 30 d postinoculation and longer showed no meningeal infiltration, but did show a few areas of lymphocytic infiltration of the parenchyma . Viral antigen could be detected by immunocytochemical methods in scattered cells in most of the mice examined (Table  2) . Occasionally the antigen-containing cells were surrounded by a lymphocytic infiltrate, but more commonly, these cells did not invoke an inflammatory response (Fig . 4) . Hematoxylin-eosin stained sections of the spinal cord showed no abnormalities except for a few lymphocytic nodules in one of the five mice examined . Examination of the livers of the older mice revealed a few focal parenchymal infiltrates with lymphocytes and eosinophils present . Viral antigen was detected in only 1 /8 of the livers examined and in marked contrast to the results obtained in the antigen studies, no virus could be cultured from the brains, spinal cords or livers of these older mice (Table 1) . Animals with hindlimb paralysis : 40% of the antibody-protected mice developed neurological disease from 23 to 60 days post-inoculation . Histological examination of the central nervous system of these mice revealed multiple abnormalities, especially in the spinal cord . Areas of destruction were apparent in the mesencephalon and pons, primarily in the white matter, although lymphocytic infiltrates were also present in the adjacent grey matter . The cerebrum showed a few areas of lymphocytic infiltration, and a basilar meningeal infiltrate was apparent . The spinal cord had many areas of focal damage with lymphocytic infiltration . After staining with Luxol Fast Blue, extensive white matter destruction was apparent with many foamy histiocytes present (Fig . 5) . Many degenerating pyknotic cells were also observed in the white matter (Fig . 5 ) . Although these cells could not be definitively identified by electron microscopy, their small size and presence in white matter suggested that they were most likely oligodendrocytes . A few coronavirus-like particles were tentatively identified by electron microscopy but they were not present in large clusters, as seen in the acute infection s (data not shown) . Viral antigen could be detected throughout the brain and spinal cord, principally in the white matter (Table 2) . Virus was cultured from the brains and spinal cords of mice with hindlimb paralysis at titers approaching those found in acutely infected mice (Table 1) . Serological studies Mean neutralization titers, as determined by a constant virus-variable serum plaque reduction assay was 1 :2700 in immunized female mice (Fig . 2) . Antibody titers in the offspring rapidly decreased over the first few weeks of life, and became undetectable in all mice which developed hindlimb paralysis . Many of the mice which remained asymptomatic also had undetectable titers, although low levels of neutralizing antibody were present in some . Thus, the majority of mice, whether symptomatic or not, did not develop significant levels of neutralizing antibody to MHV-JHM, suggesting that the level of antibody did not correlate with protection from the delayed onset neurological disease . Sera from immunized females and from mice which developed hindlimb paralysis were tested for their ability to neutralize virus isolated from infected, symptomatic mice . The antibody titers in each case were approximately the same as when tested against the original strain of JHM, so that maternal sera had high neutralizing titers whereas those of the symptomatic offspring had titers < 1 :100 .
