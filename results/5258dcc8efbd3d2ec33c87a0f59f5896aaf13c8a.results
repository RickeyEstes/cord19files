A total of 780 patients were studied. A trial profile is shown in Fig. 1 . Demographic, clinical, laboratory and outcome data by clinical group are shown in Table 1 . Overall 44% (345/780) of patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness had respiratory viruses detected. Picrornaviruses (91% rhinovirus, 9% enterovirus) were the most frequently identified virus and were detected in 23% (176/780) of patients, either alone (21%) or with another respiratory virus (2%). Influenza A and B viruses were detected in 11% (82/780) of patients. Altogether human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses (group 1 and 2) and parainfluenza virus (types 1e4) were detected in 11% (85/780) patients. Few admissions were associated with RSV or adenovirus detection; 3% (22/780) of patients combined. Co-detection of two different respiratory viruses occurred in 2% (19/780) of patients. Table 2 shows the rate of respiratory virus detection for all patients and by clinical group. Fig. 2 Picornaviruses were more commonly detected in patients with asthma compared to other clinical groups (p < 0.001) whereas influenza virus detection was more commonly associated with acute bronchitis/ILI (p < 0.001). Fig. 3a shows respiratory virus detection rate by clinical condition. Bacteria were detected in 19% (146/780) patients with acute respiratory illness overall. Table 3 shows bacterial detection by clinical group. Bacterial detection was more common in patients with pneumonia (33% [55/166] of patients) and exacerbation of COPD (25% [75/304] of patients) compared to other clinical groups (p < 0.001). S. pneumoniae was the most commonly identified bacterial pathogen and was detected in 53% (78/146) patients with positive tests for bacteria. Mixed viral and bacterial detection was also more common in patients with pneumonia (16% [26/ 166] patients), and exacerbation of COPD (11% [34/304] patients) compared to the other clinical groups (p < 0.001). Detection of bacteria was uncommon in patients hospitalised with exacerbation of asthma (5% [9/171] of patients), heart failure (8% [6/59] of patients) and acute bronchitis/ ILI (6% [5/80] of patients). Fig. 3b shows the proportions of patients with viruses detected alone, bacteria detected alone, bacteria and viruses detected together, and cases where no pathogens were isolated. Although all patients had nasopharyngeal swabs tested for viruses and the vast majority of patients had blood cultures and pneumococcal antigen testing performed, only 342/780 (42%) were able to produce sputum samples for culture. We therefore performed a separate analysis of only those patients with complete sampling for bacteria (sputum culture, blood culture, pneumococcal antigen testing). Among this subgroup the overall rate of bacterial detection was higher than in the main cohort, for patients with pneumonia (55% versus 33%) and exacerbation of COPD (43% versus 25%), but remained low in asthma (9%), heart failure (13%) and acute bronchitis/ILI (11%), shown in Table 3 . Overall, antibiotics were given in 76% (582/761) of patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness and at least one dose of intravenous (IV) antibiotic was administered in 30% (229/761). Antibiotic use was high (>50%) across all clinical groups. Antibiotics were given in 98% (156/160) of patients with pneumonia and 65% (104/160) received at least 1 dose of IV antibiotic. 79% (235/299) of patients with exacerbation of COPD received antibiotics and 22% (67/299) received IV antibiotics. Antibiotics were given in 59% (98/165) of patients with exacerbation of asthma and 13% (22/165) received IV antibiotics. 58% (33/ 57) of patients with heart failure and 75% (60/80) of patients with acute bronchitis/ILI received antibiotics. No patients were treated with neuraminidase inhibitors or other antiviral agents whilst hospitalised. Antimicrobial treatment by clinical group is shown in Table 1 . Examining antibiotic use by aetiology showed that overall 78% (211/270) of patients with viruses detected alone were given antibiotics, representing 36% (211/582) of all antibiotic use in acute respiratory illness. Only 21% (125 of 582) of all antibiotic use occurred in patients with bacteria detected e either alone (11%) or concurrently with a virus (10%). 70% (247/351) of patients with no pathogen detected received antibiotics representing 42% (247/582) of all antibiotic use. Antibiotic use by aetiology is shown in Fig. 4 .
