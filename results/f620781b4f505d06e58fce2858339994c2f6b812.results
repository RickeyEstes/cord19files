Interviewers were dispatched to 545 random GPS locations over a period of 17 days. No eligible participants could be recruited in 19 locations within the pre-set time limits and 10 locations were inaccessible (most were private properties). Amongst the 1032 eligible residents invited, nine refused to participate. In total, 1023 residents at 516 GPS locations were interviewed, 554 responses on weekdays and 469 during weekends. The distribution of the GPS locations is shown in Fig. 1 and the distribution of responses in different timeslots is shown in Supplemental Table 1 . The demographic characteristics of the respondents, compared with the corresponding 2011 Census data, [26] are shown in Table 2 . Direct comparison was difficult since some respondents declined to disclose their exact age (apart from being older than 18 years) and income. Men were slightly over-represented in the sample, and residents that lived alone were under-represented. (Table 3) .
