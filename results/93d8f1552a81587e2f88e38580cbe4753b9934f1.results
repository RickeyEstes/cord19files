To identify and sequence SARS-CoV-2 two complementary techniques were used. First, an amplicon-based system and the second, a metagenomic approach, that can also be used to assess the background microbiome. For the amplicon-based system, a series of primers were designed such that the SARS-CoV-2 genome could be amplified in appropriately 1000 base paired sequential fragments, with an approximately 200 base pair overlap to allow sequence assembly from the amplicon data (Fig. 1A) . The primers were selected on the basis of conserved regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome based upon an initial deposition of 17 genomes. The rationale to generate short amplicons was also to allow the selection of primer pairs that could amplify longer segments should one set of primers fail on a particular sample. To test whether the primers could generate amplicons, RNA was purified from Vero cells that had been infected with an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (MT007544.1 GenBank). This RNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis followed by PCR using the conserved primers. This generated 30 amplicons covering the SARS-CoV-2 genomes and these were sequenced using MinION (Fig. 1B) . The amplicon-based approach was then evaluated on nasopharyngeal swabs collected from two patients with COVID-19. Three samples were used -Patient 1 -Days 1 and 3 and Patient 2 -Day 1. Amplicons were generated and sequenced using the MinION with reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1C) . The data indicated that potentially some amplicons were potentially more abundant than others, but nevertheless resulted in identification and sequencing of the viral genome. To assess the respiratory microbiome, and to provide an alternative approach to identify SARS-CoV-2 in a clinical sample, a metagenomic approach was used. This All rights reserved.

Here, amplification by sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) was used. This had previously been used to identify dengue, chikungunya, influenza and Lassa fever viruses in clinical samples [7] [8] [9] . To provide an internal control, samples were spiked with nucleic acid from a plasmid expressing the VP35 RNA from Ebola virus (EBOV) [10] . Samples were not bar coded Reads mapping to viruses could also be identified and these included SARS-CoV-2 and human betaherpes virus 5 (human cytomegalovirus) (Fig. 1D) . Coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the three samples was not uniform (Fig. 1E ) and unsurprisingly the read depth was much lower than with the amplicon-based approach (Fig. 1C) .
