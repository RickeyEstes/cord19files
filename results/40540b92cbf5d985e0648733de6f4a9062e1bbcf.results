Clinical characteristics of patients with EV71 infections EV71 isolates were detected from 17 stool, 2 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), 2 throat swab and 1 rectal swab samples of 22 patients in Hong Kong. Most patients were young children (median age 3 years, ranged from 9 months to 32 years) who presented with HFMD without any complications. Ten were males and 12 were females. The clinical characteristics of the 22 patients with EV71 infections were summarized in Table 1 . RT-PCR and sequencing of partial VP2-VP3, 2C and 3D gene regions of EV71 and phylogenetic analysis The partial VP2-VP3, 2C and 3D gene regions of EV71 from the 22 viral isolates were amplified and sequenced ( Figure 1A ). Based on the phylogenetic analysis using partial VP2-VP3 gene sequences ( Figure 1B ), 20 isolates were clustered with EV71 subgenotype C4 strains and 2 were closely related to EV71 subgenotype C2 strains. Further analysis showed that the 20 EV71 subgenotype C4 strains were clustered with EV71 genotype B strains for partial 2C region ( Figure 1C ), but with EV71 subgenotype B3 strains and CVA16 prototype strain G-10 for partial 3D region ( Figure 1D ). Such incongruent phylogenetic relationships observed among different partial gene regions of our 20 EV71 subgenotype C4 strains suggested that these strains may belong to a newly proposed genotype D, which may have arisen from intraand inter-typic recombinations as described previously [15] . On the other hand, the two EV71 subgenotype C2 strains, V08-2231530 and V08-2236079, were clustered with other subgenotype C2 strains for partial 2C and 3D regions ( Figure 1C and 1D), indicating that they belonged to subgenotype C2. The result showed that except the two EV71 strains belonging to subgenotype C2, all EV71 strains from Hong Kong during 2004-2010 included in this study belonged to subgenotype C4 (proposed genotype D), revealing that "genotype D" was the predominant genotype persistently circulating in our population.
