Cytotoxicity of flavonoids. The MTS assay was used to determine cytotoxicity of each flavonoid for Vero and BHK cells. The CC 50 value of each compound was calculated (Table 1 ). There was no observed Antiviral activity assay. Primary screening. Different non-cytotoxic concentrations of silymarin, kaempferol and quercetin were tested on CHIKV-infected Vero cells to find the effective compound. A CPE inhibition assay was used at 48 hpi. It was shown that 100 Î¼ g/ml of silymarin significantly inhibited the CHIKV-CPE presentation (P = 0.0007) (Fig. 1a) . This finding was not unexpected as silybin (also known as silibinin) is one of the components of silymarin and has been shown to possess anti-CHIKV activity 20 . In contrast, the highest concentrations of quercetin and kaempferol only exhibited 25% CPE inhibitory activity (Fig. 1a) . The results of CPE inhibition assay were further confirmed by using MTS assay (Fig. 1b) . Silymarin inhibits early post-entry stages of CHIKV replication. From analyzed compounds only silymarin was able to suppress CHIKV mediated cytotoxicity. Therefore it was chosen for a time-of-addition assay performed with aim to determine which stage of virus infection cycle this compound affected. As it is shown in Fig. 2 the inhibition was most efficient when silymarin was added at 2 hpi. The time-dependence of inhibitory effect of compound is coherent with hypothesis that its anti-CHIKV activity may be due inhibition of some early, but probably post-entry, step of CHIKV replication cycle. Anti-entry assay has also been performed and the result has clearly shown that there is no antiviral activity of silymarin against CHIKV at the anti-entry phase (Fig. 3 ).
