Generation of serially egg-passaged viruses. A pathogenic strain of IBV belonging to the Massachusetts serotype lineage GI-1 (23), M41-CK, was used to inoculate four embryonated eggs to establish four separate virus lineages (A, B, C, and D), each starting from the same point of origin. After 13 subsequent passages, virus could no longer be detected in lineage B by routine reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) screening (data not shown). At this point, lineage A was used to infect an additional egg to create an A1 lineage, replacing the original B passage, which remained independent for the remainder of the experiment. After a total of 106 egg passages (EP), pathogenicity was assessed for resultant EP106 viruses using in vivo and in vitro methods, with a further stock, EP107, grown solely for the purposes of 454 sequencing. From this point, when lineages A to D are described, this refers to lineages A, A1, C, and D. Adaptation to embryonated eggs does not impair the ability of M41-CK to grow in adult chicken tissues in vitro. The growth characteristics of lineage A to D EP106 were investigated and compared to those of virulent M41-CK in vitro using primary chicken kidney (CK) cells. Viral progeny was assessed by plaque titration assay over a 96-h period (Fig. 1A) . Growth characteristics were broadly similar for all five viruses, with lineages C and D at 48 h and lineage D at 96 h being significantly different from M41-CK (P ϭ 0.0028, 0.0041, and 0.0222, respectively) using Dunnett's multiplecomparison test. All other points showed no significant difference from M41-CK. Plaque morphologies for the egg-passaged viruses were similar to that of the M41-CK parent (data not shown). To assess each virus's ability to cause ciliostasis, tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) were infected with 5 ϫ 10 4 PFU of virus. At days 4 to 8 postinfection, ciliary activity was assessed by light microscopy and the proportion of beating cilia was determined (Fig.  1B ). TOCs infected with virulent M41-CK exhibited very low ciliary activity and scored 0.27 and 0.09 for days 4 and 6 postinfection, respectively. Each serially passaged viral isolate caused a significant reduction in ciliary activity compared to that in the mock-infected group (P Ͻ 0.0001). Ciliary activities for lineage A (days 4 and 5), lineage A1 (days 4, 5, and 6), and lineage C (day 4) were deemed significant, with P values of Ͻ0.0001, 0.0004, Ͻ0.0001, Ͻ0.0001, 0.0015, and 0.0054, respectively. All other comparisons were nonsignificant (P Ͼ 0.05). Serially egg-passaged M41-CK viruses are attenuated in vivo. Groups of 12 8-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Rhode Island Red (RIR) chickens were inoculated with 1 ϫ 10 5 PFU of IBV or mock infected with 0.1 ml of serum-free medium via the intranasal and ocular routes. Each virus characterization had their own mock infection and virulent M41-CK virus controls. Snicking ( Fig. 2A) and rales (Fig. 2B) were recorded daily between days 3 and 7 postinoculation. Average ciliary activity scores over 50% suggest that IBV is attenuated, here indicated by an average ciliary activity score greater than 2 (Fig. 2C ). On days 4 and 6 postinfection, the average ciliary activity of chickens infected with all serially eggpassaged M41-CK viruses remained above a 50% threshold and was significantly different from that of the M41-CK virulent controls. As RIR chickens are outbred, some FIG 2 Serially egg-passaged M41-CK lineages are attenuated in vivo. Viral pathogenicity was assessed in a series of three separate animal studies. Assessment of lineages A and C was performed in separate investigations, while lineages A1 and D were assessed in a joint study. For each group (n ϭ 12), 8-day-old SPF chicks were inoculated with 1 ϫ 10 5 PFU of each virus via the ocular and nasal routes. Clinical signs, including snicks per bird per minute (A) and rales (B), were recorded daily from days 3 to 7 postinfection. (C) Ciliary activity was assessed by observation of 10 tracheal cross sections (rings) from three randomly selected birds per group on days 4 and 6 postinfection. The mean ciliary activity of these three birds is plotted, with SEM plotted as error bars. *, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01; ***, P Ͻ 0.001; ****, P Ͻ 0.0001. (D) Detection of IBV in trachea by using PCR or qPCR methods. differences were observed in clinical signs between the different M41-CK virulent control-infected groups; however, all virulent M41-CK-infected birds exhibited ciliostasis. With the exception of lineage D (P values of 0.0003 and 0.0044 for days 4 and 6, respectively), the difference between the egg-passaged viruses versus mock at each time point was deemed not significant by pairwise comparison (Tukey). Chickens inoculated with lineage C demonstrated clinical signs consistent with IBV infection, although differences from mock-infected birds were not significant. While birds infected with lineage C showed some clinical signs, the virus was deemed attenuated due to low observed clinical effect and an average ciliary activity above 50%. Tracheas were screened for the presence of IBV RNA on days 4 and 6 postinfection (Fig. 2D ). IBV RNA was detected in the tracheas of all birds infected with virulent M41-CK on day 4 postinfection, decreasing to one or two out of three M41-CK-infected birds on day 6 postinfection. Similarly, the number of birds infected with egg-passaged viruses testing positive for IBV RNA declined from day 4 to day 6 postinfection in all groups except lineage A1, for which only a single bird tested positive on each day. Interestingly, presence of IBV RNA in the trachea and reduction in ciliary activity did not correlate. For example, while the average ciliary activities for birds infected with lineage A did not differ between day 4 and day 6 postinfection (Fig. 2C ), all three birds infected with lineage A tested positive for IBV RNA on day 4 postinfection and none of the birds tested positive for IBV RNA in the trachea on day 6 postinfection (Fig. 2D ). Due to the reduction in clinical signs, reduction in the presence of IBV RNA in the trachea, and increased ciliary activity in birds infected with egg-passaged viruses in comparison to those of birds infected with virulent M41-CK, all four lineages were considered attenuated by serial egg passage. There are very few consensus-level sequence differences between virulent and attenuated M41-CK. Once attenuation of the egg-passaged viruses was confirmed, we investigated the genomic changes for each isolate compared to the starting inoculum. Stocks of virulent M41-CK and attenuated EP106 viruses of each lineage were grown and partially purified, and the RNA genomes were sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. Of the 105,728 quality-filtered reads obtained for M41-CK (Table 1) , 102,415 (96.87%) reads aligned to M41 (GenBank accession number AY851295.1) ( Fig. 3A and B ). Thirtynine point mutations (39/27,475) were identified in the M41-CK sequence relative to the sequence with accession number AY851295.1 ( Fig. 3C and D) , though the consensus for M41-CK could not be called for 20 nucleotide positions. This includes 13 positions that could not be called due to insufficient coverage and 7 positions that were ambiguous. With the set coverage threshold (10 reads), consensus could be called for 89.53%, 89.16%, 99.90%, and 99.90% of the viral genome for lineages A to D, respectively ( Fig.  4A and Table 1 ). Consensus-level changes (occurring at a Ͼ50% frequency) were called for each lineage relative to M41-CK, with 11, 17, 13, and 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified in lineages A to D, respectively (Fig. 4B ). Sliding-window analysis showed that some regions of the genome, particularly within the replicase gene, did not contain any consensus-level SNPs and may indicate more conserved areas of the viral genome (Fig. 4C) . Conversely, mutations accumulated at the 3= end of the genome, within the N gene and 3= UTR. A total of 9 SNPs were identified in more than one sample (Fig. 4D ). Lineages A, C, and D all shared two mutations occurring at positions 8520 (nsp4, synonymous [S]) and 20720 (spike, K116R). Lineages A1, C, and D all shared a mutation at U24297C (envelope, F30L), with consensus at this site unable to be called for lineage A (coverage ϭ 7). Reads at this position for lineage A concurred with the mutation present in the other three egg-passaged viruses. Overall across all four passages, 43 (70.5%) of the identified consensus SNPs were nonsynonymous (NS), 11 (18.0%) were synonymous, and 7 (11.5%) occurred in untranslated regions (Fig. 4E) . Distribution of variant positions indicates shared regions of diversity between attenuated viruses. The location of subconsensus and consensus variant positions was determined and plotted across the length of the IBV genome ( Fig. 5A ; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material). In total, 156 unique polymorphisms were identified across each of the five lineages, with each exhibiting a diversity profile of variants unique to that lineage (Fig. 5B ). This variant mapping suggests the emergence of new highly diverse regions in the attenuated virus rather than further diversification of preexisting regions present in the original population. Indeed, in most instances those variable regions present in the original population appear to have been lost in the final attenuated populations. Few consensus and subconsensus mutations are shared across attenuated viruses. Of those mutations identified, no mutation was common between M41-CK and all four attenuated viruses at either the consensus or subconsensus level. Indeed, no single mutation was shared in all four attenuated viruses. Twenty-three, 9, 49, and 23 subconsensus variants were identified in lineages A to D, respectively, that were unique to that one lineage, whereas 118 different subconsensus variants were identified across all five samples (Fig. 6) . All five consensus sequences were aligned to virulent M41 or to Ma5, H52, and H120 vaccine strain sequences available in the NCBI database. Only seven consensus-level changes resulting in a match to a vaccine strain sequence (i.e., Ma5, H52, or H120) were identified out of a total 153 SNPs within the egg-passaged viruses ( Table 2) . For U24297C other publicly available IBV sequences, both pathogenic and nonpathogenic, possess a C at this position, suggesting that this U is unique to our initial virus. Similarly, U22224 is present in both virulent M41 and vaccine strains Ma5, H52, and H120, indicating that mutation G22224U identified in lineage C is unlikely to be involved in attenuation. No common trend in variant frequency is observed for mutations identified in virulent M41-CK. Nine variants were detected within the original M41-CK population, three of which were no longer detectable in any egg-attenuated virus (Table 3) . A11525G (nsp8, NS) occurs at the low initial frequency of 1.9% but only remained detectable in lineage C. Of the initial variants undetectable in the final serially eggpassaged populations, there was no apparent relationship between their initial and final frequencies; i.e., if a variant initially exists and remains within the population, it does not necessarily reach fixation. This capability for an intermediate frequency variant to exist within an attenuated population would suggest an intrinsic ability to retain a virulent genotype at a given position. Spike contains the highest number of subconsensus mutations; however, the 3= UTR and N gene exhibit the highest rate of mutation. Each subconsensus variant was determined as possessing either an NS or S impact. The number of NS and S variants was quantified for each genomic location (Fig. 7A) relative to the coding gene length to provide a rate of substitution per nucleotide (Fig. 7B) . With the exception of lineage D, the majority of subconsensus variants in each lineage were NS. Spike, nsp3, nsp2, and nucleocapsid had the highest combined total of SNPs, with 21, 19, 13, and 12 SNPs, respectively. For spike, this consisted of 12 NS and 9 S mutations, the highest number of S mutations for a specific region. The highest number of NS mutations was observed in nsp3, with a total of 15. Combined totals of 2 and 5 mutations were identified in the 5= and 3= UTR, respectively. For the 3= UTR these mutations did not occur in conserved stem-loop structure (24) . Relative to this length, the 3= UTR had the highest rate of substitution, with an average of 0.003077 across all five passages (average ϭ 0.003846 for attenuated viruses). Nucleocapsid exhibited the highest rate of NS change, with an average of 0.001630 (average ϭ 0.002038 for attenuated viruses). Conversely, ORF5b possessed the highest rate of S change at 0.001626 (average ϭ 0.002033 for attenuated viruses).
