A total of 1,001/1,449 (69.1% response rate) Hong Kong adults successfully completed the interview. The characteristics of the sample were compared against the Hong Kong 2006 by-census population data [46] , showing respondents to be better educated and more likely to have been born in Hong Kong compared to the general population (Table 1 ) but otherwise representative. Both formal and informal information trust were correlated with all situational awareness variables except worry about contracting A/H1N1 (''Worry''), while formal information trust was also independent of perceived personal susceptibility (''Susceptibility''). In turn, understanding of H1N1 cause (''Understanding'') and Perceived self-efficacy (''Self-efficacy'') were significantly associated with hand washing while Worry and Susceptibility were significantly associated with social distancing (Table S3 ). The SEM model fitted well to the data with CFI = 0.977, TLI = 0.969 and RMSEA = 0.026. Standardized coefficients indicated two primary features in the model; the first one linking Formal information and hand hygiene and a second linking Informal information and Social distancing ( Figure 2 ). Paths were seen via Formal information trust and Self-efficacy (b = 0.25) and Self-efficacy and hand hygiene (b = 0.23), and via Formal information trust and Understanding (b = 0.36), and Understanding and hand hygiene (b = 0.19) while Understanding and Selfefficacy were independent. These associations formed the first feature. Marginal associations between Worry and hand hygiene and between Self-efficacy and social distancing were seen, but the small standardized coefficients of b = 0.13 suggest that these paths are minor. Susceptibility and Worry were associated, but otherwise were functionally independent, both upstream from formal information trust, and downstream from hand hygiene. The second feature of the model is reflected in a different set of paths associating informal information trust with social distancing. Trust in informal information sources was inversely associated with Susceptibility (b = 20.21), which was associated positively with Worry (b = 0.44), and inversely with Self-efficacy (b = 20.42). However, more confidence in informal information sources was associated with more Worry (b = 0.16) and finally, only Worry was associated with social distancing (b = 0.36). Trust in informal information was independent of Understanding and Self-efficacy. The only remaining notable feature of the model was a strong inverse association (b = 20.42) between Susceptibility and Selfefficacy. This suggests some interaction between these two variables that could strongly influence both sets of paths mentioned so far. Overall, the model explained 11.3% of the variance in hand hygiene and 16.1% of the variance in social distancing behaviors.
