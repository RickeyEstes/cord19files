Activity-Based Profiling Identifies ZUFSP as a Putative DUB Since our recent discovery of a new family of DUBs (Abdul Rehman et al., 2016) , we sought to determine whether there were other yet-to-be identified DUBs. Ub-based suicide probes have been instrumental in the identification of several DUBs (Hewings et al., 2017) . We therefore established a sensitive and robust pipeline using chemical probes in combination with proteomic approaches to isolate and identify DUBs from cell extracts (Figures 1A and 1B) . Using propargylated Ub (Ub-Prg), a potent and selective modifier of DUBs , we set up an optimized pipeline to maximize recovery of DUBs, with which we capture the majority of cysteinebased DUBs (Figures 1C and S1A-S1C). When performed with lysates from two different cell lines, we captured a unique set of DUBs from each cell line. The robustness of the pipeline established here is also highlighted by the presence of MINDY DUBs, which had previously not been identified using Ub-based suicide probes. Intriguingly, we repeatedly observed the presence of ZUFSP (Zinc finger with UFM1-specific peptidase domain protein) in our pull-downs ( Figure S1D ). UFM1 is an important Ub-like modifier whose functional roles are still poorly understood (Daniel and Liebau, 2014) . However, ZUFSP is thought to be an inactive UFM1 peptidase as it lacks a key catalytic residue ( Figure 1F ). To rule out that ZUFSP was a contaminant in our Ub suicide probe pull-downs, we expressed and purified the catalytic domain of ZUFSP and monitored its activity toward Ub-Prg. Indeed, the predicted catalytic domain of ZUFSP is readily modified by Ub-Prg ( Figures 1D and 1E ). In contrast, ZUFSP is not modified by UFM1-Prg suggesting that ZUFSP may be a Ub-specific protease ( Figures 1D and S1E) . A sequence alignment of ZUFSP with the other known Ufm1 proteases Ufsp1 and Ufsp2, however, reveals that the His residue that is part of the catalytic triad of both Ufsp1 and Ufsp2 is missing in ZUFSP ( Figure 1F ). This raised the question of whether and how ZUFSP could be an active DUB.
