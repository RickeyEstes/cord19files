Serum viromes. Twenty-six serum samples from PRDC-affected piglets were pooled and then sequenced using the Illumina 4000 system. We obtained approximately 10 million reads in total from the serum samples (GenBank accession number: SRX2901706). Reference genomes were downloaded from GenBank to screen for the best BLAST hits and the raw sequencing reads were mapped to them using the template assemblies. Assemblies were inspected manually and only where one unique read as a minimum mapped to multiple regions of the viral genome was the virus considered to have been detected, and the number of reads was tallied. Sixteen distinct viruses were identified in the serum samples from the diseased piglets (Fig. 1a) , which, in order of sequence read abundance, are as follows: porcine parvovirus (PPV) 6 (PPV-6, 46.42% of all reads), PPV-3 (35.04%), PPV-5 (8.18%), PPV-4 (5.41%), PPV-2 (4.03%), porcine pseudorabies virus (PRV, 0.38%), torque teno sus virus 1b (TTSuV-1b, 0.25%), TTSuV-1a (0.07%), porcine kobuvirus (PKV, 0.06%), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV, 0.04%), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2, 0.03%), porcine bocavirus 5 (PBoV-5; 0.03%), ungulate bocaparvovirus 2 (PBoV-1, 0.02%), ungulate bocaparvovirus 5 (PBoV-3, 0.02%), pig stool associated circular ssDNA virus (PigSCV, 0.02%) and porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV, 0.01%).
