Based on univariable regression analysis (see Table 1 for detailed results), all potential explanatory variables were significantly associated (P < 0.001) with the outcomes (i.e. testing positive for BRSV or BCV). In the multivariable models (see Table 2 for detailed results), only 'herd size' and 'regional cattle density' were significantly associated with testing positive for BRSV. In other words, when adjusting for these covariates, neither 'in-degree' nor 'ingoing infection chain' could be shown to be associated to testing positive for BRSV. For the outcome testing positive to BCV, the significant covariates kept in the final models were 'herd size', 'regional cattle density' and also 'in-degree' or 'ingoing infection chain'. No interactions between main effects were significant and these were therefore excluded from the final models. In the comparison of selection strategies, all risk-based approaches detected more positive cases compared to total random sampling. However, for BRSV, the only strategies where the median values or number of detected positives were above the 95% percentile of the random sampling distribution were the sampling strategies based on 'indegree' (Fig. 2) . For BCV on the other hand, all risk-based approaches except random sampling of herds with >0 contacts (i.e. 'in-degree' >0 and 'ingoing infection chain' >0), had median numbers of detected positives above the 95% percentile of the random sampling distribution (Fig. 3) . Notice that the more narrow distributions for the selections strategies 'in-degree' ≥5 and 'ingoing infection chain' ≥25, compared to total random sampling, is a result of the smaller number of herds in these categories (relative to the sample size of 100).
