Demographic characteristics. A total of 356 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and analyzed. In detail, 163 patients were female (45.78%) and 193 were male (54.21%). Most of the patients (319) were <5 years old while 36 patients were >5 years old. Patients are heterogeneously distributed in different seasons, while regarding geographical origin, 123 (37.9%) patients are of Naples metropolitan area, 201 (62.03%) originated from neighboring municipalities, and for 32 patients this information is lacking. In our study we considered only viral infections, but we detected also other etiologic agents (Bordetella pertussis, Chla myd ophila pneu m oniae, M ycopla s m a pneumoniae), highlighted the presence of these infections in 24 patients (6.7%). Respiratory infection viruses distribution. The total rate of detection of all seven viruses was 78% (278/356) of patients. In detail, HRV viruses were detected in 44% of patients, followed by ADV viruses (18%), RSV viruses (13%), and PIV (12%). A lower incidence has been instead highlighted for FLU (7%), HCoV (4%) and HMPV (2%) (Fig. 1) . In a significant proportion of individuals co-infections were also highlighted. In detail, double co-infections were detected in 69/256 (26.9%) patients, triple in 17/256 (6.6%) and quadruple infections only in 1 patient (Table I) . The more frequent association was detected between HRV and PIV viruses 19/87 (21%), followed by HRV and ADV viruses 15/87 (17.24%), and HRV and RSV viruses 9/87 (10.3%) ( Table I) . Sex and age distribution. Viruses appear heterogeneously distributed between sex, with the exception of PIV. In detail, ADV was slightly higher in males (18/34, 52.9%), while FLU (10/14, 71.4%), HMPV (3/4, 75%) and HRV (50/86, 58.13%) were strongly higher in males children (see detection rate Fig. 2 ). On the contrary HCoV (5/7, 71.4%) and RSV (18/25, 72%) are better represented in female patients (see Fig. 2 ). Regarding age distribution a decline in the incidence of viral infections with age was observed for respiratory viruses, except for FLU (Fig. 3) . In fact the detection rate for FLU viruses was lowest in 2-5 years patients. The detection rate for ADV gradually decrease from 0-2 years patients to >5 years patients. The same trend was highlighted for HCoV, PIV, HRV and RSV (with a consistently increasing of detection rate in 0-2 year-old patients). HMPV was detected prevalently in 0-2 year-old children (Fig. 3) . Seasonal distribution. The total detection rate for all respiratory viruses in spring, summer, autumn and winter was calculated. The rates of detection was more heterogeneous during the different seasons. In detail, ADV infection was prevalent in summer (20/34, 58.8%) and spring (10/34, 29.4%) seasons, FLU was prevalent in spring (7/14, 50%) and winter (4/14, 28.5%), HMPV in winter (2/4, 50%), HCoV in autumn/winter (3/7, 42.8%), HRV in autumn (34/86, 39.5%) and summer (30/86, 34.8%), PIV in summer (13/24, 34.8%) and RSV in winter (24/25, 96%) (Fig. 4) . Geographical distribution. The pediatric patients were divided into two main groups according to origin from the metropolitan of Naples and neighboring municipalities. The detection rates for the two areas appear different with a prevalent distribution in extra-urban areas. This appears more evident especially for ADV, HRV and RSV viral infections (Fig. 5) .
