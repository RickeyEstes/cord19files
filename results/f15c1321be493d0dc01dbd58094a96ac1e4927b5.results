There were 501 children recruited between November 2010 and April 2011. As sufficient data were available to allow the evaluation of all cases, all subjects were included in the final analysis. While 410 of the children were only seen at the emergency department, 91 children required hospitalization. Laboratory-confirmed influenza (using either rapid diagnostic test, culture or RT-PCR; all analysis performed for all subjects) was demonstrated in 26.1% of all children (131/501; 95% CI: 22.4---30.2); i.e., 29.3% of children attending only the emergency department (120/410; 95% CI: 24.9---33.9) and 12.1% of hospitalized cases (11/91; 95% CI: 6.2---20.6). The median age of children with laboratory-confirmed influenza was 36.0 months (range: 0---179 months) and 54.2% were male (Table 1) . Among the 131 cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza, 107 (81.7%) required medical re-evaluation at the emergency department following discharge and two (1.5%) required hospitalization ( Table 2 ). The subsequent follow-up visits were made by most patients, regardless of influenza status; 81.7% of influenza-positive subjects and 87.0% of influenza-negative subjects (p = 0.1477). Among influenza cases, a comparable proportion with influenza A (86.6%) and influenza B (74.1%) had subsequent follow-up visits (p = 0.1104). At the time of last contact, almost all the children (93.1% [122/131]) had recovered; and 6.9% (9/131) were still recovering. The overall median of total direct medical costs associated with each case of laboratory-confirmed influenza was Table 3 ). The range in costs relates to the range in treatment received; the majority of patients had an emergency department visit (median D 142.71) and all patients received prescription or non-prescription medication (median D 8.53). Around 60% of patients had diagnostic costs (median D 28.00), around 10% of patients incurred expensive ward costs (median D 1646.73) and 1 patient expensive ICU costs (median D 1535. 19 ). Most of the children with laboratory-confirmed influenza (71.8% [94/131]) missed school or day care. The mean absence was 6.6 days (range: 1---15). School absence was recorded in 62.7% (42/67) and 81.0% (47/58) of children with influenza types A and B, respectively. The proportion of domestic contacts with influenza-like symptoms, ARI and/or fever during the study period was significantly higher among children with laboratory-confirmed influenza (25.8% [95% CI: 21.
