3.1. Complete sequencing of Indonesian IMNV strains L. vannamei samples were collected from aquaculture farms in East Java, Bangka Belitung, and Lampung provinces in early 2012, including one sample that had been stored frozen since early 2011. This Lampung 2011 sample (ID-LP-11) and one East Java 2012 sample (ID-EJ-12-1) were chosen for complete (whole-genome) sequencing. After RNA extraction from the shrimp tissue, and RT-PCR to amplify overlapping regions of the IMNV genome, sequencing was performed directly from both strands of the purified RT-PCR products. The genomes of both ID-LP-11 and ID-EJ-12-1 were found to span 7561 bp and to encompass two long, partially overlapping ORFs on one of the RNA strands, i.e., the plus strand. The upstream ORF, ORF1, covers 4818 nt (encoding 1605 aa) from the first in-frame AUG codon at nt positions 136-138 to the first in-frame stop codon at nt positions 4951-4953, leaving a 5 nontranslated region of 135 nt. The downstream ORF, ORF2, covers 2739 nt (encoding 912 aa) from the first in-frame codon at nt positions 4752-4754 to the first in-frame stop codon at nt positions 7488-7490, leaving a 3 nontranslated region of 71 nt not including the ORF2 stop. ORF1 and ORF2 thus overlap by 199 nt (positions 4752-4950) not including the ORF1 stop, and ORF2 is in the -1 frame relative to ORF1. These results agree with those reported by Senapin et al. (2007) for the IMNV strain from East Java collected in 2006 (herein referred to as ID-EJ-06). The genome sequence of the first IMNV isolate, from Brazil in 2003 (Poulos et al. (2006) (herein referred to as BZ-03), was originally reported to be 7560-bp long, differing from the genome sequences of Indonesian strains ID-EJ-06, ID-LP-11, and ID-EJ-12-1 as noted above by a single nt deletion near the 3 end of ORF2, slightly shortening ORF2 and the predicted length of its encoded polypeptide. Given this discrepancy, we asked the previous authors to recheck their original BZ-03 sequence, and they indeed found an error, indicating that the genome length of BZ-03 is also 7561 bp, with ORF2 encompassing the same nt positions (7488-7490) as in the Indonesian strains. This correction has been made to the GenBank entry for BZ-03. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the complete sequences of the one Brazilian and three Indonesian IMNV strains aligned without gaps and shared nt-sequence identities of 98.7-99.6%, or only 30-102 nt substitutions per pair (Table 1) . Pairwise scores for aa-sequence identities among these strains showed similar relative values (98.9-99.5%, or only 12-28 aa substitutions per pair). The two strains exhibiting the lowest pairwise-identity scores were ID-LP-11 and ID-EJ-12-1, suggesting they may represent diverging lineages of IMNV in Indonesia. Based on these findings and the phylogenetic results described below, a crude estimate of the Fig. 1 . Phylogenetic comparisons for 656-nt region of IMNV genome. Trees were reconstructed according to different phylogenetic approaches as described in Sections 2 and 3: neighbor joining (distance) (A), maximum likelihood (B), and Bayesian inference (C). All trees are unrooted and displayed as radial phylograms. Branch-support values (%) were obtained as described in Section 2, and branches with <70% support were collapsed to a polytomy at the preceding node. IMNV strains for which sequences have been previously reported are labeled in gray, those newly reported here are in black, and those for which whole-genome sequences are available are underlined. nt-substitution rate for IMNV is ∼8 substitutions/genome/year between 2003 and 2012, or ∼1 × 10 −3 substitutions/site/year, which approximates that for avian reoviruses suggested by Liu et al. (2003) and is at the higher end of that suggested for dsRNA viruses by Stenger et al. (2010) .
