All four MERS-CoV strains replicated effi ciently in Vero-E6 cells at multiplicities of infection of 0·01 and 2 (fi gure 2, table). Egyptian dromedary MERS-CoV NRCE-HKU270 replicated at least as well as did human MERS-CoV EMC, and reached peak titres even faster than human MERS-CoV at 48 h post infection when infected at low multiplicity of infection. Although the two Saudi dromedary MERS-CoV strains (AH13 and AH19D) replicated less effi ciently than did human MERS-CoV during the fi rst 24 h post infection, the viral titre of AH13 was similar by 72 h post infection. Replication of dromedary MERS-CoV NRCE-HKU270 was signifi cantly higher than that of the other two dromedary MERS-CoV strains at 24 h and 48 h post infection at multiplicity of infection of 0·01. Immunohistochemistry of ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung infected with human and dromedary MERS-CoV strains suggested that all four viruses could infect these tissues (fi gure 3). Because of their threedimensional nature, infection in ex-vivo cultures was non-uniform throughout the histological specimen (appendix). Figure 4 shows viral replication kinetics of the viruses in the ex-vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung. In the absence of permissive cells, the thermal inactivation curves of each of these MERS-CoV strains showed virus infectivity largely decreasing to undetectable levels by 24 h post infection (fi gure 4A). We noted similar thermal inactivation kinetics when we substituted mouse lung tissue (non-permissive to MERS-CoV) for the human ex-vivo tissues (data not shown). Although the extent of virus replication varied from donor to donor, comparison with the thermal inactivation curves provided convincing evidence of virus replication of all four viruses in the ex-vivo human bronchial (fi gure 4B) and lung (fi gure 4C) cultures from each donor over the 72 h experiment period. Two replicates of ex-vivo cultures per donor from three donors, infected with the same virus (human MERS-CoV EMC) on diff erent occasions, showed that the change of area-under-curve from the same tissue donor in bronchus ranged between 0 to 1·36-fold and in lung ranged between 0 to 1·46-fold, providing an indication of the range of technical variation in these ex-vivo assays (appendix). By contrast, the diff erence of area-undercurve for human MERS-CoV EMC between donor 3 and donor 1 was 5·3-fold for the bronchus (area under curve above detection limit 112·8 for donor 1 patchy nature of the infection, the variation between donors, and lack of adequate statistical power, statistical comparisons between viruses have to be interpreted with caution. Within these limitations, we noted no signifi cant diff erence in the replication competence of the four viruses in either the bronchus (p=0·151) or the lung (p=0·270) as assessed by the area-under-the-curve using the Friedman test (appendix). Immunohistochemical analysis of virus-infected bronchial tissues showed that the types of cells infected by human and dromedary MERS-CoV were very similar (fi gure 5). Co-staining of viral antigen with the goblet cell marker MUC5AC (fi gure 5A) and ciliated cell marker β-tubulin (fi gure 5B) lent support to the notion that MERS-CoV infects non-ciliated bronchial epithelium other than goblet cells. Co-staining of viral antigen and alveolar epithelial cell marker AE1/3 showed that all four viruses infected alveolar epithelial cells (fi gure 5C), and co-staining with the alveolar type II epithelial cell marker prosurfactant protein C showed that type II alveolar epithelium was infected (fi gure 5D). We noted no evidence of infection of alveolar macrophages (fi gure 5E). All four viruses infected lung endothelium (appendix). Thus, overall, the respiratory tropism of the human and dromedary MERS-CoV was similar. All three MERS-CoV strains (EMC, AH13, NRCE-HKU270) replicated effi ciently in Calu-3 cells (AH19D was not included because it is in the same clade as AH13). To quantify the viral RNA and cytokine and chemokine gene induction and expression, the humanrespiratory-tract-derived cell line Calu-3 was cultured and infected with virus as for the Vero-E6 cells. RNA from the infected cells was also collected at 6, 24, and 30 h post infection for analysis of gene expression and quantifi cation of viral RNA. We harvested 1 mL of culture supernatants from Calu-3 cells at 30 h post infection to measure cytokine and chemokine protein concentrations using ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and cytometric bead array (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA), using methods specifi ed by the manufacturer. As a positive control for assessment of cytokine and chemokine induction in Calu-3, we used a highly pathogenic avian infl uenza H5N1 virus, A/Hong Kong/483/1997. Infl uenza virus was prepared in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells as previously described. 17 Despite effi cient replication, none of the MERS-CoV strains induced signifi cant gene expression or protein secretion of tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), CXCL10, or interferon β (fi gure 6). We used infl uenza A (H5N1) virus, a potent inducer of interferon β and CXCL10 in epithelial cells, for comparison. We noted evidence of interleukin 6 induction by all three MERS-CoV strains; although AH13 and NRCE-HKU270 induced greater production of interleukin 6 mRNA than the human EMC strain, the human EMC strain induced higher concentrations of interleukin 6 protein than did either dromedary strain (fi gure 6F).
