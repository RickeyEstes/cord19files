Establishing the RPA-LFS assay Zaire ebolavirus species specific RPA primers and probes were designed based on the published sequence of the Guinea strain (Accession number; KJ660348.1) with the use of PRIMER-BLAST [44] , which generated 20 nucleotides that were extended manually to a longer 30 nucleotides to be more amenable for RPA reactions. [2, [45] [46] [47] . Labelled primers and probes were tested for RPA followed by LFS detection (Zaire RPA-LFS) using a synthetic Ebolavirus template, and tested for optimal reaction times between 5 to 40 min. The optimal reaction time at 37°C was 30 min, plus 5 min incubation of the LFS in the running buffer. A visible red colour band at the control and test lines were observed for positive controls while the no template control (negative control) had only one band at the control region of the strip. The control band on both strips indicated a valid RPA-LFS assay. Analytical sensitivity and specificity of the RPA-LFS assay The detection threshold of the Zaire RPA-LFS was determined using a dilution series of plasmid containing the NP gene (1.34 × 10 10 to 1.34 × 10 1 ) copies / μL), and viral RNA from cultured Ebolavirus and comparing results to quantification using the gold standard realtime PCR assay. Detection using Zaire RPA-LFS showed the same sensitivity to RT-PCR, with a detection limit of 1.34 × 10 2 copies / μL (Fig. 1) true positives, as demonstrated by ImageJ analysis of black pixel density. Such image analysis could be performed in field situations through the use of a lateral flow reader. We note that the faint test bands in the no template negative controls and Fig. 2 have been shown to disappear using higher dilutions of RPA product in the lateral flow device (e.g. 1:100-1:200) [48] compared to the 1:10 dilution that we used, however, this may affect sensitivity of the assay. We also observed that in the case of very high concentrations of hybridization product, the intensity of the control band was affected, but this did not affect interpretation of results. In order to determine cross reactivity or analytical specificity of our assay, we tested cultured viral RNA from Reston, Sudan and Marburg viruses, as well as different strains of Zaire ebolavirus species (Table 1) . Marburg viruses show the same haemorrhagic symptoms as Ebolaviruses and Ebola cases were mistaken for Marburg virus when it was first discovered in 1976 [46] . We also tested Plasmodium falciparum, Dengue virus 1-4 and West Nile virus (Kunjin NSW 2011 strain), as these pathogens are likely to be isolated from clinical samples in the same geographic region. Our Zaire ebolavirus RPA-LFS did not show a positive test result when exposed to the Marburg RNA, any of the other ebolavirus species, or other pathogens (Fig. 2) , indicating the assay was specific to Zaire ebolavirus species. We confirmed this specificity by demonstrating a test line consistently appeared when exposed to viral RNA from cultures of different Zaire ebolavirus strains (Fig. 3 ).
