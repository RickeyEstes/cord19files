A total of 401 children were enrolled; 241 and 160 in the pre-and post-vaccine studies, respectively. All had at least one microbiological investigation performed. There were similar demographic characteristics between the pre-and post-vaccine studies, including median age (2.5 versus 2.6 years), proportions of males (57% versus 56%) and aged ,5 years (75.5% versus 69%). Figure 1 summarises the aetiological and radiological classifications and one dose less for their age. Among those who had PCV13, one received the full schedule, one child had one dose less for age, and eight had not completed but had appropriate doses for their age. Table 3 shows the number of pathogens identified with age-group distribution. Viral (31%) and mixed infections (12.5%) were significantly higher post-vaccination than pre-vaccination, at 19.5% (p50.021) and 5% (p50.015), respectively. The detection of viruses using a combination of PCR and serological assays post-vaccination (85 (57%) out of 149) was higher than that achieved testing with immunofluorescence and serology pre-vaccination (65 (30.5%) out of 213 Post-vaccination, RSV was detected in 21% (31 out of 147) of samples, of which 19 were type A, with rhinovirus (8.5%), influenza (7%) and adenoviruses (7%). These figures were comparable with those prevaccination for adenovirus and influenza A/B (6% each); but higher than that for RSV (15%). Of the 142 identified causative pathogens post-vaccination, 71 (50%) viruses were detected among those aged ,5 years, compared to the finding in the pre-vaccine study (54 (36%) out of 149). hMPV was not detected in any of the 48 pre-vaccination respiratory samples tested, but was identified in one child in the postvaccine study.
