As uncertainty associated with the exponential growth rate decreases, accounting for uncertainties in generation intervals becomes even more important (Fig. 2B) . Propagating error only from the growth rate gives very narrow confidence intervals in this case. Likewise, propagating errors from the growth rate and the mean generation interval gives wider but still too narrow confidence intervals. We expect this hypothetical example to better reflect more recent scenarios, as increased data availability will allow researchers to estimate r with more certainty. Figure 2 : Effects of r,Ḡ, and κ on the estimates of R 0 . We compare estimates of R 0 under five scenarios that propagate different combinations of uncertainties (A) based on our pooled estimates (µ r , µ G , and µ κ ) and (B) assuming a 4-fold reduction in uncertainty of our pooled estimate of the exponential growth rate (using (µ r + 3 × median(µ r ))/4, instead). base: R 0 estimates based on the median estimates of µ r , µ G , and µ κ . growth rate: R 0 estimates based on the the posterior distribution of µ r while using median estimates of µ G and µ κ . GI mean: R 0 estimates based on the the posterior distribution of µ G while using median estimates of µ r and µ κ . growth rate + GI mean: R 0 estimates based on the the joint posterior distributions of µ r and µ G while using a median estimate of µ κ . all: R 0 estimates based on the joint posterior distributions of µ r , µ G , and µ κ . Vertical lines represent the 95% confidence intervals. We also compare the estimates of R 0 across different studies by replacing their values of r,Ḡ, and κ with our pooled estimates (µ r , µ G , and µ κ , respectively) one at a time and recalculating the basic reproductive number R 0 (Fig. 3) . This procedure allows us to assess the sensitivity of the estimates of R 0 across appropriate ranges of uncertainties. We find that incorporating uncertainties one at a time increases the width of the confidence intervals in all but 7 cases. We estimate narrower confidence intervals for Study 3, Study 6, and Study 7 when we account for proper uncertainties in the generation-interval dispersion because they assume a narrow generation-interval distribution (compare "base" with "GI variation"); when higher values of κ are used, their estimates of R 0 become less sensitive to the values of r andḠ, giving narrower confidence intervals. We estimate narrower confidence 8 .

Substituting the reported r orḠ from Study 1 with our pooled estimates give narrower confidence intervals for similar reasons. We find that accounting for uncertainties in the estimate of r has the largest effect on the estimates of R 0 in most cases (Fig. 3) . For example, recalculating R 0 for Study 7 by using our pooled estimate of r gives R 0 = 3.9 (95% CI: 2.3-8.6), which is much wider than the uncertainty range they reported (2.0-3.1). There are two explanations for this result. First, even though the exponential growth rate r and the mean generation intervalḠ have identical mathematical effects on R 0 in our framework (Eq. 2 in Methods), r is more influential in this case because it is associated with more uncertainty (Fig. 1) . Second, assuming a fixed generation interval (κ = 0) makes the estimate of R 0 too sensitive to r andḠ. One exception is Study 1: we find this estimate of R 0 is most sensitive to generation-interval dispersion κ. This is because Study 1 assumes an exponentially distributed generation interval (κ = 1): estimates that rely on this assumption make R 0 relatively insensitive and thus tend to have particularly narrow confidence intervals. Finally, we incorporate all uncertainties by using posterior samples for µ r , µ G , and µ κ to recalculate R 0 and compare it with the reported R 0 estimates. Our estimated R 0 from the pooled distribution has a median of 2.9 (95% CI: 2.1-4.5). While the point estimate of R 0 is similar to other reported values from this date range, the confidence intervals are wider than all but one study. This result does not imply that assumptions based on the pooled estimate are too weak; we believe that this confidence interval more accurately reflects the level of uncertainties present in the information that was available when these models were fitted. In fact, because the pooled estimate does not account for overlap in data sources used by the models, we feel that it is more likely to be over-confident than under-confident. Our median estimate averages over the various studies, and therefore particular studies have higher or lower median estimates. We note in particular that, while the baseline example we used from Study 6 may appear to be an outlier, the authors of this study also explore different scenarios involving changes in reporting rate over time, under which their estimates of R 0 are similar to other reported estimates. Here, our focus is on estimating uncertainty, not on identifying potential explanations for these discrepancies.
