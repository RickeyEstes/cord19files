Results suggest that the use of museum specimens could effectively reveal historical infections of MPXV across broad geographical scales and within multiple host specimens. We found evidence of MPXV circulating in host species as early as 1899, identified two new potential host species (F. carruthersi and pyrropus) and verified MPXV infections within F. anerythrus, congicus and lemniscatus. The overall MPXV prevalence level for either MPXV amplicon was 9.0% (93/1038, table 1). All positive samples belonged to the Congo-Basin strain of MPXV and were found in the DRC, except for one in the Central African Republic, with large numbers of positives occurring in the northwestern provinces of Kivu and Orientale, the southern province of Kasai-Occidental and the eastern provinces of Bandundu, Équateur and Bas-Congo (figures 1 and 2) . The amplicons used were highly conserved and no genetic diversity was found between samples. Of the ten species tested, five species (F. Prevalence levels are shown by dot coloration with areas with no MPXV-positive samples as grey dots, low prevalence as light reds and high prevalence as dark reds. Size of dots corresponds to the sampling number per locality (n ≤ 58). Estimated species ranges are shown in purple [44] . Underlying layer represents tree cover, with darker greens corresponding to high percentages of cover [47, 48] . Local administrative areas were geo-referenced to centroid coordinates. . In comparison to F. anerythrus for the same year bin and museum, a negative coefficient for carruthersi, lemniscatus and pyrropus suggested that these three species were less likely to be positive for MPXV. F. congicus, however, had a positive coefficient, suggesting that a sample from this species had slightly higher odds of being positive when compared with anerythrus from the same museum and time period (table 2) . Tukey's all pairwise differences found a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the MPXV prevalence levels of congicus and carruthersi (p = 0.028) and between congicus and pyrropus (p = 0.015) ( All samples without a collection year were dropped from the dataset. Error bars correspond to Clopper-Pearson exact 95% confidence intervals [33, 34] . To highlight years with larger sample sizes, black dots indicate years with 10 or more samples. extracted from RMCA samples may be of slightly higher DNA concentration and quality than the AMNH samples (see electronic supplementary material, methods).
