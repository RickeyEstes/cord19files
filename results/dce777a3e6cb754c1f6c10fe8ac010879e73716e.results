Expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant DDX1 The human DDX1 was expressed in E. coli and purified as described in Materials and Methods. Because of the wide range in enzymatic activity observed for DEAD-box proteins, it was important to determine if the recombinant DDX1 was compactly folded prior to enzymatic characterization. Gel-filtration analysis revealed that DDX1 eluted from the column in a single peak in 500 mM KCl, with the retention expected for a monomeric ∼ 80-kDa protein (Fig. 2) . A small shoulder consistent with dimeric DDX1 was also visible, but this represented only a small fraction of the total protein. In contrast, DDX1 eluted as several peaks in 150 mM KCl corresponding to monomer, dimer, and larger aggregate. This chromatogram demonstrated that 10 μM recombinant DDX1 self-associates in a saltsensitive manner at 25°C. However, in neither case did DDX1 primarily elute in the void volume as would be expected for a denatured protein, indicating that recombinant DDX1 is folded in a compact conformation. Circular dichroism (CD) was used to further investigate the folded state of DDX1 at 25°C using the same samples analyzed by gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. 2) . The spectra of DDX1 in both 500 mM and 150 mM KCl are essentially identical, within experimental error. The negative signals at lower wavelengths are consistent with the presence of mixed α-helical and β-sheet content. 35 These spectra are also similar to those reported for other DEAD-box proteins. 36 The secondary structure of DDX1 is not KCl dependent, as judged by CD, indicating that the self-association observed at lower KCl concentration is not due to a gross unfolding of the protein. Thus, by both gel filtration and CD spectroscopy, recombinant DDX1 is folded at 25°C.
