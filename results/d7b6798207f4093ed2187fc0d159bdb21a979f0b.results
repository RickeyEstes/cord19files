Infection of BJAB cells wit γ-herpesviruses induce expression of IFITM1. In a recently concluded study, we demonstrated the ability of KSHV to induce IFITM1 expression during early stages of infection 10 . In the present study, we analyzed the effect of another closely related γ-herpesvirus, EBV, on IFITM1 expression. IFITM1 transcript (Fig. 1A ) and protein expression (Fig. 1B ) levels were significantly elevated with EBV and KSHV infection of BJAB cells. The expression of IFITM1 increased in virus infected cells as early as 5 min post infection (PI) which was elevated by 10 min and 15 min PI in BJAB, but significantly declined by 30 min PI (Fig. 1B) . We observed a similar IFITM1 expression profile during early stages of viral infection in human microvascular dermal endothelial cells (HMVEC-d) cells (Supplemental Fig. 1) . We also performed binding assays to decipher if just binding of KSHV and EBV is enough to induce IFITM1 expression in BJAB cells. Our results (Fig. 1C) demonstrate binding of the wild-type or the UV.inactivated virus is not enough to induce IFITM1 expression. The results implicate the ability of γ-herpesviruses to induce the expression of IFITM1 during early stages of infection.
