CoV PLPs antagonize STING-mediated activation of IRF-3 To determine if CoV PLPs are capable of blocking STINGmediated activation of an IRF-3 dependent promoter [36, 37] , we assessed the level of IFN stimulated response element reporter (ISRE-Luc) activity in the presence of STING with increasing amounts of coronavirus PLPs. Stimulation of HEK-293T cells with STING alone resulted in greater than 20-fold increase in activity of the ISRE-dependent reporter. Co-expression of STING with wild-type PLP2-TM or PLpro-TM resulted in a dose dependent decrease in ISRE activity indicating that these PLPs can antagonize STING-mediated activation of an IRF-3 dependent promoter ( Fig. 1 B and C and supporting information (SI) Fig. S1 ). To determine if this antagonism is dependent on PLP catalytic activity, cells were co-transfected with plasmid DNA expressing STING and catalytic cysteine mutants of either PLP2-TM or PLpro-TM. Consistent with previous studies, CoV PLP catalytic mutants also act as antagonists, although they are less effective than wild-type PLPs in antagonizing the IFN response [14, 17] . The effect of PLP2-TM on STING-mediated activation was also visualized using confocal microscopy. HEK-293T cells were transfected with STING-HA in the absence or presence of PLP2-TM and the localization of IRF-3 was monitored by immunofluorescence assay. In cells expressing STING-HA, IRF-3 translocates to the nucleus. However, in cells co-expressing PLP2-TM, IRF-3 remains in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D ). In addition, STING-HA and PLP2-TM co-localize in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. These results indicate that CoV PLPs antagonize STING-mediated activation of IRF-3.
