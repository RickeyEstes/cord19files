3.1. Conservation of X-domain 'Asn, Asn, His, Gly, Gly, Gly' position within HEV strains Within the HEV X-domain sequences, Asn806, Asn809, His812, Gly815, Gly816, and Gly817 residue positions were found highly conserved among human strains representing the recognized four viral genotypes (Fig. 1) .
