Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE) profiles of APP bacterial proteins and western blot analysis Proteins from total cell lysates of APP serotype 1 were separated by 2DE. Two-dimensional separation profiles are shown for separation by isoelectric point (pI) in the first dimension over a pH ranges of pH 4-7 ( Figures 1A, 2A ) and pH 7-11 ( Figures 3A, 4A ). The separation profiles were highly reproducible in 2DE experiments conducted in triplicate followed by membrane transfer and developing, yielding similar patterns of total proteins and immunoreactive proteins. Figures  1B, 2B , 3B and 4B show the western blot analysis with the convalescent sera from naturally infected APP serotype 1 swine and from hyperimmune sera from S259-immunized rabbit. No specific immunoreactive protein spots were observed when negative control sera were used.
