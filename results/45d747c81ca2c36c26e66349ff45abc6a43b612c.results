Twenty-five (33%) of 75 veal calf farm samples and 2 (2.0%) of 100 pig farm samples showed visible products of the expected size (326 bp). The gel electrophoresis and hybridization results are shown for eight strains (Figure 1 ). Hybridization with a set of probes used for detection of NLVs in humans yielded no positive reactions ( Figure 1B) ; therefore, 46 products (25 of the expected size and 21 of a smaller size [ Figure 1A , lane 7]) were sequenced. All 25 RT-PCR products of the expected size contained the GLPSG amino acid motif characteristic of viral RNA polymerases (29) . The 21 products of smaller size revealed no viral sequences. The NLV-RT-PCR was negative for all pooled specimens from 43 dairy herds and 48 chicken farms. By phylogenetic analysis, all calf calicivirus sequences formed a tight cluster closely related to NLVs from GGI with the highest similarity with the Newbury calf calicivirus (Figure 2 ) (22) . Nucleotide sequence identities between the calf NLVs and GGI NLVs were 63% to 70% (75% to 77% amino acids). The swine virus sequences clustered as a separate lineage within GGII NLVs, with 69% to 71% nucleotide and 79% to 83% amino acid identity. In addition, the swine sequences strongly resemble (94% nucleotides, 100% amino acids) the swine calicivirus sequences from Japan. Partial polymerase sequences of Bo/NLV/176/1998/NET and Sw/ NLV/34/1998/NET have been assigned GenBank accession numbers AF194183 and AF194184, respectively. Since the calf and pig strains did not hybridize to the probe mixture for detection of NLVs from humans, specific probes were developed based on the consensus sequence of RT-PCR products of 10 calf herd samples and on the pig farm samples, respectively. The probe sequences were: RH1(calf) (5'-GGATGTGGTGCAGGCAA AC-3') and RH2(pig) (5'-TCCGCATCTCTATCGT GG-3'). Hybridizations with the calf probe (RH1) confirmed all RT-PCR-positive calf samples after 15 minutes exposure to an ECL hyperfilm ( Figure 1C ). Overnight exposure to ECL hyperfilm revealed eight more positives, for 33 (44%) positive calf farm samples. All veal calf farm samples were screened by electron microscopy for viruses (Table) . Particles with NLV morphologic features were found in only one specimen (Figure 3) , in which the presence of calicivirus sequence was confirmed by RT-PCR and hybridization (Table) .
