The membrane ordering effect of TM-wt is associated with electrostatic interactions of the peptide with negatively charged lipids As shown in Fig. 1 , A-C (solid lines), when the molar concentration of TM-wt incorporated into MLVs of DMPC/ DMPG/Chol ¼ 40/30/30 increases from zero to 1.33 Â 10 À2 (TM-wt/lipids ¼ 1/75), the S 0 of all three spin labels in the vesicles at 37 C and pH 7 (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA) increases significantly, i.e., from 0.412 to 0.476 (by 16%) for DPPTC, from 0.52 to 0.60 (by 16%) for 5PC, and from 0.24 to 0.27 (by 14%) for 14PC. The noticeable increases in S 0 start at a concentration of TMwt around 0.5 Â 10 À2 (TM-wt/lipids ¼ 1/200). This concentration is the same as that of TM-wt in DMPC/DMPG ¼ 4/1, at which the Fourier transform infrared spectrum of the membrane begins to show a significant change (15) . The NLLS spectral analyses show that all of the spectra of DPPTC and 14PC in the vesicles of DMPC/DMPG/Chol ¼ 40/30/30 can be well fit with a single component. However, the spectra from 5PC show a two-component feature when the concentration of TM-wt in the vesicles is R1.0 Â 10 À2 . (The spectrum with TM-wt/lipids ¼ 1/75 is illustrated in Fig. SF1 of the Supporting Material.) These spectra were successfully simulated with two components with distinct order parameters. The S 0 of the first component (0.55), which is independent of the concentration of TM-wt, is slightly higher than the S 0 of 5PC in vesicles without TM-wt (0.52). The S 0 of the second component is 0.61, 0.64, and 0.69 for the spectra with TM-wt/lipids of 1/100, 1/88, and 1/75, respectively. These values are > 0.59, the order parameter of 5PC at 24.0 C in the gel phase-like domains in pure DMPC bilayers (data not shown). These gel phase-like domains coexist with the liquid crystal phase domains near its main phase transition (23) . The second component is less abundant than the first one, with a relative population of 0.21, 0.26, and 0.32, respectively, for the three spectra with the high concentration of TM-wt. Note in Fig. 1 B that the values of S 0 of 5PC for the spectra with TM-wt/lipids of 1/100, 1/88, and 1/75 are averaged order parameters over their two components. It is likely that the spectra of DPPTC and 14PC from the vesicles with high concentrations of TM-wt also consist of two components, but they are not resolved. These results indicate that at high concentrations of TM-wt, highly ordered membrane domains are induced in DMPC/DMPG/Chol ¼ 40/30/30 membranes. The membrane ordering effect by TM-wt depends not only on the concentration of incorporated TM-wt but also the concentration of DMPG in the vesicles. For the case of 5PC, when the concentration of DMPG was reduced from 30 mol % to 10 mol %, giving a mixture of DMPC/DMPG/ Chol ¼ 60/10/30, as the concentration of TM-wt was increased from zero to 1.0 Â 10 À2 (TM-wt/lipids ¼ 1/100), the S 0 of 5PC (at pH 7 and 37 C) increased from 0.51 to 0.57 (dotted line in Fig. 2 A) . However, as the TM-wt/lipids was further increased to 1/88 and 1/75, the S 0 of 5PC decreased to 0.53 and 0.52, respectively. For the case of 14PC, there was almost no change in S 0 (at pH 7 and 37 C) in DMPC/DMPG/Chol ¼ 60/10/30 (dotted line in Fig. 2 B) as the concentration of TM-wt was increased. When DMPG was completely removed (i.e., in DMPC/Chol ¼ 70/30), the S 0 of 14PC decreased only as TM-wt was incorporated (dashed line in Fig. 2 B) . It can be seen that lowering the con-centration of DMPG reduces the membrane ordering effect of TM-wt, and in the vesicles without DMPG incorporation of TM-wt, it only disorders the membrane. (We could not obtain ESR signals from DPPTC in vesicles with a concentration of DMPG < 30% after TM-wt was incorporated; therefore, no results regarding the dependence of S 0 of DPPTC on the concentration of DMPG in these vesicles are presented). In addition, the membrane ordering effect of TM-wt depends on the ionic strength of the medium. When the concentration of NaCl in the pH 7 buffer was increased from 150 mM to 250 mM, the order parameters of all three spin labels in the vesicles of DMPC/DMPG/Chol ¼ 40/30/30 at 37 C remained constant (within experimental error) as the concentration of TM-wt in the vesicles increased (dashed lines in Fig. 1 , A-C). This is indicative of an ionic interaction of TM-wt with the DMPC/DMPG/Chol ¼ 40/30/30 membranes. Taken together, the above results suggest that electrostatic interactions between TM-wt and negatively charged DMPG are related to the membrane ordering effect of TM-wt. The rotational diffusion rates R t and R k , and S 0 of 5PC, 14PC, DPPTC in DMPC/DMPG/Chol ¼ 40/30/30, 60/30/10, Table S1 and Table S4 Table S1, Table S2, Table  S3, Table S4, Table S5, and Table S6 . It can be seen that upon incorporation of TM-wt, the motion of acyl chains outside the highly ordered membrane domain increases slightly, but increases significantly in the highly ordered membrane domains. TM-wt appears to have the opposite effect on the motion of the headgroups.
