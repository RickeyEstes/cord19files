Time course of pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure A total of 45 MERS-CoV infected patients were hospitalized during the outbreak with 13 patients in group 1 (including 3 asymptomatic patients), 19 patients in group 2, and 13 patients in group 3. The clinical course of symptomatic MERS patients progressed serially: patients developed initial symptoms after a median 5-day incubation period (IQR 3.5e7.0), pneumonia after a median of 6 days from symptom onset (IQR 5.0e7.0), and respiratory failure after a median of 12 days from symptom onset (IQR 10.0e13.0). In group 3 patients, it took a median of 2 days from desaturation to respiratory failure (IQR 1e3 days). The development and progression of pneumonia by time sequence is depicted in Fig. 1 . No one developed pneumonia before day 4 of symptom onset.
