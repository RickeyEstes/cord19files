In order to study PSAP function we generated several deletion mutants which were used to study mitochondrial import and induction of apoptosis by this protein [23] . We targeted PSAP fragments to the MOM by fusion to the TMD of Bcl-XL, demonstrating that MOM localization was required for apoptosis induction, since endoplasmic reticulum-targeting by fusion to the TMD of VAMP2 [27] did not induce apoptosis. Since apoptosis induction by PSAP could be mediated by interactions with other proteins, we attempted to detect PSAP-interacting proteins by crosslinking, using some of the above-mentioned chimeras. When HEK293 cells expressing the first 168 residues of PSAP fused to the TMD of Bcl-XL (PSAP 1-168 TMD Bcl-XL, 21 kDa) were treated with BSOCOES, a band was observed by western blot suggesting dimerization of the protein (Fig. 1, lane 2) . Similar results were obtained with the protein containing the TMD of VAMP2 (PSAP 1-168 TMD VAMP2, 21.2 kDa). Since both proteins share the same PSAP sequences, we first assumed that PSAP was mediating dimerization. Nevertheless, a literature search indicated that the TMD of VAMP2 is responsible for its homo or heteromerization at the ER membrane [28] , suggesting that the dimers observed in our experiments could depend on TMD instead of PSAP sequences. This interpretation could also explain a band migrating between those corresponding to the monomer (21.2 kDa) and dimer (42.4 Fig. 1 , as a heterodimer between endogenous VAMP2 (12.6 kDa) and PSAP 1-168 TMD VAMP2 (expected molecular mass: 33.8 kDa, marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1 ). Note that some of the bands are also present in the absence of crosslinker, suggesting strong interactions.
