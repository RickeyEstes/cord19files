There were 3273 participants, of whom 1858 (57%) were female. Approximately, 40% of participants were 15 years of age or younger and co-morbidity was infrequent. 362 (11%) were aged 0-4 years, 366 (11%) aged from 5 to 8 years, 574 (18%) aged from 9 to 14 years, 310 (10%) aged from 15 to 19 years, 410 (13%) aged from 20 to 29 years, 380 (12%) from 30 to 39 years, 409 (13%) from 40 to 49 years, and 462 (14%) aged ‡50 years. There were 149 (11AE2% of 1328) with laboratory-confirmed influenza and 595 (18AE2% of 3273) with at least 1 episode of laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infection other than influenza. Of the 149 with laboratory-confirmed influenza, 32 were also infected with another respiratory virus. Influenza (including A (H1N1), A (H3N2), and B) had the highest incidence (0AE80 ⁄ 1000 person-days CI: 0AE74-0AE87), followed by entero ⁄ rhinovirus (0AE69 ⁄ 1000 person-days, CI: 0AE65-0AE73), RSV (0AE28 ⁄ 1000 person-days, CI: 0AE25-0AE30), coronaviruses (0AE26 ⁄ 1000 person-days), and parainfluenza (0AE23 ⁄ 1000 person-days). The age group-specific incidence of respiratory virus infection is shown in Figure 1 . Among children of age <5, entero ⁄ rhinovirus had the highest incidence (1AE36 ⁄ 1000 person-days; CI: 1AE20-1AE53), but this was not significantly higher than RSV (1AE29 ⁄ 1000 person-days, CI: 1AE12-1AE45), P = 0AE809). Influenza A was not detected in those aged ‡50. Influenza B was not detected among those aged ‡30 and among those 40-49 years of age and older, a decline in incidence was observed for entero ⁄ rhinovirus, coronaviruses, RSV, and influenza A. The incidence of parainfluenza increased among those aged 40-49 years and older; in contrast, h-MPV (human metapneumovirus) was not detected in those 20-29 years of age or older (Figure 1 ). In addition, the highest incidence of parainfluenza was in children aged 0-4 years (1AE11 ⁄ 1000 person-days, CI: 0AE95-1AE26). Entero ⁄ rhinovirus had the highest age-specific incidence among participants with age ‡50 (0AE33 ⁄ 1000 person-days, CI: 0AE26-0AE40), which was higher than for seasonal influenza (0AE25 ⁄ 1000 person-days, CI: 0AE14-0AE36), although statistically not significant, P = 0AE744) (Figure 1 ). The incidence of entero ⁄ rhinovirus in this age group was significantly higher than coronavirus (0AE27 ⁄ 1000 person-days, CI: 0AE21-0AE33, P = 0AE01) and to RSV (0AE06 ⁄ 1000 person-days, CI: 0AE03-0AE09, P = 0AE005). The weekly occurrence of influenza and non-influenza viruses was plotted in bar graphs ( Figure 2
