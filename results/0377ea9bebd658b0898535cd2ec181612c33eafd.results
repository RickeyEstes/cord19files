This section first discusses the accuracy of the CFD simulation by comparing the numerical results with the corresponding experimental data for the jet that developed from the gasper. We then describe the use of the validated CFD model to study the jet flow characteristics. Fig. 6 shows the simulated velocity profile at different downstream locations. The velocity profile starts with double peaks, which were caused by the annular gasper outlet. The two peaks gradually merge to one peak. Fig. 7 (a) compares the calculated centerline velocity U c along the jet axis (z direction) with the experimental data, where U c has been normalized by its maximum value U max and z by the location of U max and D. Because of the Coanda effect [36] , the air from the annular inlet immediately attached to the solid cone. At a certain distance from the inlet, the airflow around the cone merged to a single stream. This explains why U max did not occur at the inlet (z = 0). The comparison shows that the modeling results agreed well with the experimental data, especially after the merging point (z = 3.2D) where the flow was more developed. The mixing mechanism of this flow is illustrated in detail in Section 3.2. This investigation also performed a self-similarity test on the peak velocity profiles in the region downstream from the jet. Pope [28] has discussed self-similar characteristics in turbulent round jets in detail. Fig. 7(b) shows U z /U c âˆ’ x/x 1,2 profiles, where x 1/2 is the x location at which the z-velocity is half of U c . After normalization, the three profiles at the three different downstream locations collapse into almost a single profile, which strongly indicates self-similarity. The similarity profiles also matched well with the experimental data. Since the numerical model used in this study is able to predict the gasper-induced airflow with reasonably good accuracy, the model is considered to be validated.
