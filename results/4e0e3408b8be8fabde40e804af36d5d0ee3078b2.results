Among 650 vaccinees preparing for the Hajj pilgrimage, 580 voluntarily participated in the study, yielding a response rate of 89.2%. Respondents had an average age of 58 years (range 20-85 years) with a sex ratio (M/F) of 1.32 (Table 1) . A total of 217 travellers were living in Marseille (37.4%), 357 in other parts of southern France (61.6%); information was not available in six cases (1.0%). Most of the pilgrims were born outside of France, with 88.8% having been born in North Africa. The mean duration of stay in France was 32 years (range 0-72 years). A proportion of 83.1% of travellers had a primary school education or below. Thirty-four per cent of individuals were retired. Among those under 65 years which is the age of retirement in France, only 10.9% were employed. A proportion of 47.1% was living in state-subsidized housing and 49% received state subsidies for payment of rent. Only 19.8% were property owners. Among 41.2% of individuals, the household allocation was less than one room per person. A proportion of 26.6% of travellers was covered by the state-financed complementary health insurance which is accessible to insolvent individuals and 45.2% had a self-financed private complementary health insurance. A proportion of 7.4% were covered under the statefinanced full health insurance coverage in cases of chronic and debilitating disease. Forty-three per cent of the pilgrims declared to suffer from chronic diseases, including 22 A total of 447 pilgrims (77.1%) were presented a questionnaire upon returning home, six individuals renounced travel (1.0%) and the remaining (21.9%) were lost to followup. The mean time between return and presentation of the questionnaire was 27 days (range 1-98 days). No significant variation was observed between the 447 travellers who answered the questionnaire and the 580 enrolled pilgrims regarding demographic, immigration and socio-economic characteristics, as well as underlying chronic diseases. The mean duration of the pilgrimage was 30 days (range 14-63 days). The vast majority of pilgrims declared to have been housed and to have eaten together (99.8% and 96.4%, respectively). As shown in Table 2 , a proportion of 53.9% of travellers attended a doctor during travel and 6.5% did so after travel. Nine individuals were hospitalized (two in Saudi Arabia, one in Algeria and six upon returning to France). Among the six patients hospitalized in France, two had a respiratory tract infection. Haemophilus influenzae was identified as the responsible pathogen in one of these two patients who was also suffering from diabetes. Among the four other hospitalized patients, two had unstable diabetes mellitus and two had haematological disorders. A total of 74 travellers (16.6%) experienced fever during their stay in Saudi Arabia (67 attended a doctor) and 271 (60.6%) had cough (259 attended a doctor). Just over 25% of the travellers with cough were febrile. Dates of beginning of fever and cough are shown in Fig. 1 . A first peak was observed on 28 December, followed by a second peak on 30 December. The mean duration of fever was 3 days (range 1-15 days) while the mean duration of cough was 11 days (range 2-30 days). None of demographical and socio-economic characteristics of pilgrims significantly affected the occurrence of cough. Similarly, previous travel to Saudi Arabia, diabetes, hypertension and chronic respiratory diseases, as well as vaccination against influenza had no significant influence on the occurrence of cough during the pilgrimage (Table 3 ). When considering only the cases of cough associated with fever, travellers with diabetes appeared to have an increased risk compared to other patients in univariate analysis (OR = 2.02 (1.1-3.7), p 0.02). Similarly, individuals of <65 years and unemployed had a greater risk of cough associated with fever (OR = 2.22 (0.98-5.03), p 0.05). Several factors appeared to be related to febrile cough, without reaching statistical significance. None of the other factors influenced the risk of febrile cough (
