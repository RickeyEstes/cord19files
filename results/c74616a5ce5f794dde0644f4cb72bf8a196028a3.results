Severe morbidity, mortality, and respiratory disease following influenza transmission from infant to mother To investigate influenza infection in the mother-infant dyad, we intranasally inoculated 4-week-old infant ferrets with the 2009 H1N1 virus, A/California/07/2009 (Cal/07), at 10 5 EID 50 . Infants were housed with nursing-mothers before and after inoculation. Nasal washes (NW), temperature, weight, clinical assessment, and survival were collected daily as shown in the design schematic ( Fig 1A) . Necropsies were performed at Day 3, 4, 7, and 14 post-inoculation or if an animal was removed from the study (reached weight cut-off or had succumbed to illness). Inoculated infant ferrets developed illness leading to mortality starting with a high fever at 104% of baseline temperature (p<0.05) Day 2 post-infant-inoculation. Infants then developed hypothermia (Day 6) ( Fig 1B) . All infants reached weight cut-off (lost 20% of original weight; p<0.05) or died by Day 8 post-infant-inoculation (Fig 1C and 1D ). Four days post-infant-inoculation, nursing-mother ferrets also developed influenza-like symptoms including increased body temperature (103% of baseline). Mother weights significantly decreased by 13% Day 4 post-infant-inoculation ( Fig 1C) . Weight did not recover by study end and one mother reached cut-off ( Fig 1D) . The weight and temperature of the mothers of mock inoculated control infants are presented in S1 Table which showed mothers did not develop symptoms post-mock-inoculation of infant ferrets. As the mothers of inoculated infants began to display clinical signs of influenza including temperature increases, weight loss, and mortality, we went on to analyze the upper and lower respiratory tracts of the infants and their mothers to determine virus transmission and pathogenesis. Viral burden in infant NW was first detected Day 1 post-infant-inoculation (Fig 2A) . The NW of nursing-mothers were positive for influenza virus Day 3 post-infant-inoculation. Viral titers remained high in mother NW Day 6-7 (Fig 2A) at more than 6 TCID 50 /ml (Log 10 ). Residual virus persisted in the mothers' NW by Day 10 (S1A Fig). Virus transmission between adult ferrets pair-housed (S1C Fig) were used as a comparison of transmission dynamics between infants and mother ferrets. For this control, one adult was intranasally inoculated under similar circumstances as the infant-mother inoculations and NW were collected for viral load assessment. NaÃ¯ve cage mates of inoculated adult ferrets began shedding virus in NW Day 3 post-inoculation. These results showed that the influenza virus was able to be transmitted from direct intranasally inoculated infant ferrets to the upper respiratory tracts of their nursing-mothers on a similar time scale as that of adult ferrets. We next determined if transmission of the virus from infants to mother led to lower respiratory tract infection. Examination of viral titers in the lower respiratory tract of the mothers found virus levels above 6 TCID 50 /ml (Log 10 ) in both the trachea and lungs post-infant-inoculation in 2 out of 3 mothers investigated (Day 4 and 7 post-infant-inoculation) ( Fig 2B) . H&E (hematoxylin & eosin) staining of mother lungs revealed delayed, airway-localized inflammation ( Fig 2C) . Day 3/4 post-infant-inoculation, mother lungs showed areas of minimal infiltrating leukocytes (black arrows: diffuse areas; green arrows: dense infiltration) ( Fig 2C) . Increased leukocyte infiltration was observed Day 7 post-infant-inoculation where sites of inflammation were dense in mononuclear cells with lymphocyte-like morphology. Infected mother lungs were compared to the lungs of adult male ferrets directly inoculated with Cal/07 through the intranasal route ( Fig 2C, right column) . The lungs collected from mothers of mock inoculated infants were similar in architecture to that of mock inoculated adult male ferrets. The adult lungs collected Day 3/4 post-direct-inoculation had markedly more leukocyte infiltrates compared to the mother lungs at Day 3/4 post-infant-inoculation ( Fig 2C) . Taken together with the above data, these findings indicated that 2009 H1N1 transmission from infant to mother led to severe respiratory disease with upper and lower respiratory tract infection and accompanying lung pathology but on a delayed time course compared to direct adult infections.
