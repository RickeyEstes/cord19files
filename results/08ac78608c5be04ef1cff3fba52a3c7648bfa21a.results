The results of the blood parameters and serum chemistry analysis (mean, SD, minimum, maximum, and RI -lower limit and upper limit) are given in Table- 1. The comparative level of blood parameters and serum chemistry between males and females, adult and juveniles is shown in Table- 2. Levels did not vary significantly between males and females. Juveniles showed higher levels of PCV, total leukocyte count (TLC), neutrophils, eosinophils, P, Na, Cl, and TP, whereas adult shrews had higher levels of lymphocyte, urea, and glucose. Among the samples, the mean urea (51.43 mmol/L) and glucose (130.43 mg/dL) levels were significantly higher (p<0.04) in adults compared to juveniles. Elevated mean values were observed for lymphocytes (47.91%) in adults but for PCV (41.83%), neutrophils (45.29%), P (21.35 mg/dL), and TP (9.13 g/dL) in juveniles (Table-2 ).
