During the experimental period, none of the dogs in groups A and B showed any clinical signs, including significant increases in rectal temperature, or distinct abnormal biochemical blood characteristics including CRP when compared with group C dogs. In addition, the WBC counts of group A and B dogs were nearly equal to those of group C, and body weight increased in all animals after inoculation (Figure 1 ). Statistical analysis showed that the only significant difference was seen in the potassium level in the three groups five days before inoculation. At autopsy (51 days PI), any significant lesions were not observed macroscopically. Major lymph nodes, especially the axillary lymph nodes, were small, ranging from 0.5-1 cm in diameter with distinct cortico-medullary junctions. The spleen and bone marrow did not contain any significant lesions. Infectious RD114 virus was not detected from TE671 (LacZ) cells co-cultured with buffy coat cells using the LacZ marker rescue assay. This finding was also confirmed by PCR assays using genomic DNA from the co-cultured cells as a template. Additionally, RD114 provirus was not detected in genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleen and sternal bone marrow, using the one-step PCR assays ( Figure. 2).
