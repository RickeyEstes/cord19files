The results of logistic regression and the SIR model simulation are given in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The comparison of the predicted final sizes is shown in the graph in Figure 1 . We see that both methods converge and with more data, the discrepancy between the predicted values becomes less than 5%. From Table 1 , we see that the peak of the epidemic was probably on 9 Feb, 2020. .
