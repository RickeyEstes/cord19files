From among 22 692 children recruited at 145 nursery schools, 2528 who were younger than 2 years were excluded, after which an additional 569 children were excluded because they met other exclusion criteria. Ultimately, 19 595 children aged 2 to 6 years were observed for 20 days (391 900 person-days). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the participants. The size of schools was categorized according to quartiles of the number of children in the school, and school location in Fukuoka City was classified by city ward. No significant differences were observed between sexes. There were significant differences between the gargling and nongargling groups in the distribution of age, school size, and school location. The rates for fever onset and sickness absence were significantly lower in the gargling group than in the nongargling group (Table 2) . Although the proportion of gargling children across the 145 schools ranged from 18.2% to 100% (interquartile range: 70.4%-88.8%), the proportion across the 7 wards ranged from 76.3% to 83.9%. The rates of fever outcomes across each size of school ranged from 0.28% to 0.40% in the gargling group and from 0.85% to 1.31% in the non-gargling group. Furthermore, the rates of fever outcomes across 7 wards ranged from 0.21% to 0.49% in the gargling group and from 0.59% to 1.46% in the non-gargling group. We divided all schools into 4 quartiles, based on the proportions of gargling children in attendance, to compare the rates of fever outcomes in non- gargling groups among the 4 school groups. There was no trend in the rate of fever in the non-gargling group over the 4 school groups. The results of logistic regression are shown in Tables 3  and 4 . Each table shows the 4 models used to estimate the odds ratio for gargling. We first conducted the analyses adjusted by age (models 1 and 2). However, considering the strong influence of age on outcomes, analyses stratified by age were added (models 3 and 4). As shown in Table 3 , gargling was associated with significantly lower odds ratios for fever onset, except among children aged 3 (in model 4) and 6 years. The odds ratios for sickness absence were significantly lower among gargling children aged 4 or 5 years and among those aged 6 years in model 3 ( Table 4 ). The gargling agents were added to the model in subgroup analysis ( Table 5) . As compared with the non-gargling group, each agent was associated with significantly lowered odds ratios for the incidence of fever onset, except for saline water in model 2. In particular, gargling with green tea yielded an odds ratio of approximately 0.3. In contrast, no gargling agent had a clear effect on sickness absences.
