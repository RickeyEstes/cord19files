Only 6 out of 123 patients received PN (4.88 %). In 4 cases PN was started at day 8 after ICU admission in accordance to the new protocol. PN was started earlier in 2 patients suffering from an haematological-oncological disease complicated with neutropenic sepsis and a BMI less than 18 and already receiving PN on the ward. Since a caloric intake less than ¾ of the caloric target at day 3 after ICU-admission was considered a cut-off for starting PN in the old protocol, 88.62 % of the patients would have met the criteria for receiving PN according to that protocol. Of 308 admissions, 111 patients were audited, 27 excluded and 84 patients included within data analysis (n = 84). Mean protein provision was 0.87 g/kgBW/d. Mean protein percentage delivery was 78 %. Protein deficits became more pronounced when measuring against 'higher' disease specific recommendations. Feeding protocols were adhered to in 6 % of patients. At initial assessment the nutritional products met protein in 55 % of patients. On average, patients experienced 20 hours of enteral nutrition stoppages. Of the 116 critically ill patients, the prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency was 64.65 %. Patients with 25(OH)D deficiency were statistically significantly younger, had female gender, had higher blood glucose levels, higher rate of respiratory arrest 24 h prior to ICU admission and higher requirement of mechanical ventilator support. The 25(OH)D deficiency was not significantly correlated to the 28-day all-cause mortality. However, there was a trend toward increased in the vasopressor used, higher rate of ICU infection and longer hospital length of stay, among the deficiency group. A total of 11 RCTs (n = 2846 patients) met inclusion criteria. When the data from 4 trials were aggregated, n-3 PUFA had no effect on ICU LOS (WMD -4.43, 95 % CI -13.43, 4.48, P = 0.34, heterogeneity I2 = 43 %). However, n-3 PUFA were associated with a trend in the reduction of POAF (RR 0.89, 95 % CI 0.76, 1.05, P = 0.17; I2 = 34 %, P = 0.13). In addition, in those oral/enteral based trials, n-3 PUFA showed a tendency towards a reduction in POAF (RR 0.87, 95 % CI 0.74, 1.03, P = 0.11; I2 = 47 %, P = 0.07; Fig. 75 ). The test for subgroup differences on overall POAF showed a trend (P = 0.16). There was no effect of n-3 PUFA on MV days and hospital LOS. At baseline, no significant differences were recorded regarding serotonin plasma levels (243 ± 47.75 and 252.6 ± 38.59 μ g/l, P > 0.05) or age (55 ± 12.38 and 54.66 ± 12.11, P > 0.05), in both groups. After the first determination we observed a decrease in serotonin levels in the placebo group (184.46 ± 37.57) and in 5-HTP group (229.26 ± 39.35) (p < 0.001, T-value is 3.18). Delirium was present in 3 patients in the placebo group and 1 patient in 5-HTP group. After 14 days, serotonin levels were lower in the placebo group when compared to treatment group (P < 0.001), and delirium was absent in the latter. Mean end points for Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale were higher in placebo group when compared to treatment group (P = 0.006), at the same time. A total of 29 RCTs (n = 2737) met inclusion criteria, including 6 new trials since our last update. When the results of trials reporting infections were aggregated, probiotics were associated with a significant reduction in infections (RR 0.82, 95 % CI 0.69, 0.97, P = 0.02; heterogeneity I2 = 41 %), and particularly among patients with higher risk of death (RR 0.75, 95 % CI 0.61, 0.99, P = 0.04; I2 = 58 %; Fig. 76 ). Moreover, probiotics were associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of VAP (RR 0.74, 95 % CI 0.58, 0.96, P = 0.02, I2 = 29 %). Finally, probiotics had no effect on mortality, diarrhea, and hospital LOS Conclusions Probiotics are associated with a significant reduction in overall infections, as well as a reduction in the incidence of VAP. After controlling for age, gender, urbanization level, socioeconomic status, liver cirrhosis, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, malignancy, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obesity, history of alcohol intoxication, chronic renal insufficiency, biliary tract disease, chronic pancreatitis and Charlson Comorbidity Index score, the adjusted hazard ratio of pancreatic cancer was 2.48 (95 % confidence interval, 1.84¡X3.34) in patients with diabetes. In patients with history of hyperglycemic crisis episodes, the hazard ratio of pancreatic cancer was significant higher. (hazard ratio, 3.60; 95 % confidence interval, 1.15¡X11.25) Of 20 cases included, 12 cases achieved a good glycemic control. Among success subgroup, there were no BG level higher than mean glucose during RI more than 22.525 mg/dl. Only a mild hypoglycemia event was observed with spontaneously resolved. Otherwise among 8 participants in failure subgroup, half of them developed hyperglycemia at 8th hour. This research also found that median RI dose was different as 1.8 mg/dL among success cases and 2.5 mg/dL among failure cases. Results are showed in Table 42 . The mean age of patients with DKA was 50.4 ± 24.1 and 45.2 % (n = 14) of them were men and 54.8 % (n = 17) were women. Twelve (38.7 %) of patients had type 1 diabetes and 19 (61.3 %) had type 2. The mean serum lactate was 2.93 ± 1.81 mmol/L (0.89-9.20). Of 31 patients, 14 (45.2 %) had elevated serum lactate levels (>2.5 mmol/ L), and 6 (19.4 %) had high lactate levels (>4 mmol/L). No correlation was found between serum lactate levels and mortality, length of ICU and hospital stay. Besides, lactate levels were not correlated with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score, blood pressure, serum glucose and HbA1C levels. Between May and September 2014 there were 628 HAC activation patients admitted to the legacy sites of the London Chest Hospital and Heart Hospital. Following the merger there was an increase of 246 patients (39 %). Of the HAC activations at the legacy sites from May-September 2014, 282 (45 %) patients underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention, pPCI, compared to 254 (29 %) patients in the five months post-merger. ICNARC data was not collected at the Heart Hospital and therefore data is only available from one legacy site. The ITU admission rate at the London Chest was observed as 4.9 % compared to 6.4 % in the new Centre. The length of stay on Intensive Care increased following the merger from a median 3.9 days (IQR 2.1-8.0) to a median 2.9 days (IQR 1.6-7.0). The in-unit mortality decreased in May-September 2015 to 41.1 % from 45.2 % the previous year. Results are depicted on Tables 1 & 2 . The underlying diseases were as follows: sepsis (5), acute respiratory distress syndrome (3), lethal arrhythmia (2), ileus (1), suffocation (1), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (1), sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (1), unknown (4). The SOFA scores of the FP-group and PPgroup were 10}3 (10) and 14}3 (14) , respectively; the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). APACHE2 scores of the FP-group and PP-group were 34}7 (35) and 40}8 (44), respectively; however, there was no significant difference between the groups. Procalcitonin levels of the FP-group and PP-group were 9}13 (6) and 22}26 (15), respectively; again there was no significant difference between the groups. IL-6 levels of the FP-group and PPgroup were 1096}2851 (98.8) and 19,475}24,603 (11,305), respectively; the difference between the groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The EAA level of the FF-group was 0.41}0.16 (0.46), whereas the PP-group was 0.54}0.26 (0.49); however, there was no significant difference in EAA levels between the groups. Among 199 students assessed on the serious game, 72 had received the one-hour BLS session. Children's ages did not differ between the 2 groups (12 [11-12] vs 12 [11-12] years old, p = 0.7). The total game completion time was 169 (+/-28) seconds in the trained group versus 185 (+/-32) seconds in the non-trained group (p = 0.0006) (Fig. 80) . Knowledge of emergency call did not differ between the two groups (92 % in trained group vs 86 % in non-trained group, p = 0.2). Hands were more often properly placed during chest compression in the trained-group (92 % vs 73 %, p = 0.002). Electrodes of automated external defibrillator were more often properly placed in the trainedgroup (44 % vs 10 %, p = 0.0001). Initial ROSC rates were 10 of 14 animals in the dantrolene group vs. 5 of 14 animals in the amiodarone group (3 of 10 for saline group). However, persistence of ROSC until 120 min follow-up was shown in 6 animals of the dantrolene group, 4 animals in the amiodarone group and 2 animals of the saline (sham) group. However, results were not statistically significant between groups. Hemodynamic data and cerebral perfusion as well as cerebral oximetry were comparable between survivor animals. Of 51 patients treated with TH, 27 patients survived to hospital discharge. Seventeen of the hospital survivors were conscious: 6, 3 and 8 patients with CPC at discharge 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Five of them passed away later. Approximately 78.6 %, 76.9 % and 75 % of awake patients survived at 6 months, 1 and 2 years after discharge, respectively. The majority (3/5) of dead cases died within 6 months with severe functional disability (score 24-26). The patients' disability scores were shown in table. One-third of awake patients with CPC 2 and 3 who still survived at 6 months after discharge finally recovered to normal physical and cognitive function, while most of patients with CPC1 returned to normal function or minimal disability. The number of OHCA-PPCI and unplanned admissions during the study period were 51 and 630 respectively. Median length of ICU stay were significantly high for the PPCI patients (4.25 vs 3.70 days, P = 0.02). Furthermore, PPCI patients had higher ICNARC severity scores (29.3 vs 20; p < 0.0001). PPCI patients had significantly higher levels of dependency, evidenced by higher levels of organ support (3.2 vs 2 organs; p < 0.0001), greater level 3 care (4.1 vs 2.6 days; p = 0.012), more days ventilated (4 vs 2.4 days; p = 0.005), and higher requirements for advanced CVS support (1.6 vs 0.6 days; p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences between dialysis requirement or hospital length of stay. Overall ICU mortality rates were higher in the PPCI group (46.9 % vs 30.7 %, p = 0.02). Despite representing only 8 % of the total number of patients admitted during the study period, PPCI patients accounted for 12 % of total ICU level 3 bed days, 13 % of ventilated days and 19 % of advanced CVS days. Subjects comprised 147 patients in VF and 177 patients with pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole. The percentage of favorable outcomes was 42.2 % (62/147) in VF and 11.3 % (20/177) in PEA/asystole. The most important prognostic indicators of favorable outcome founded by MLR were age (p < 0.01), time from collapse to ROSC (TROSC) (p < 0.01), base deficit (p = 0.06), presence of by-stander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (p = 0.09) for VF and age (p = 0.05), TROSC (p < 0.01), and base deficit (p < 0.05) for PEA/asystole. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve were 0.866 for VF and 0.896 for PEA/asystole respectively. Duration of CPR was 40 min for G-A and until ROSC for G-B. Directly after CA, a rSO2 decrease was recorded, which remained for the whole resuscitation attempt (Table) . There weren't any statistical differences between the study groups. After ROSC, rSO2 remained decreased and increased gradually over time. There were 38 patients out of total 169 patients with OHCA who fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study and 16 patients were finally included. Total measurement points of these patients were 29 points. Median value of the patient age was 82 years old (IQR 71-87). Male patient number was 14 (88 %), and 81 % patients had witnesses at the time of cardiopulmonary arrest. Two types of coefficient of correlation between arterial pressure and rSO2 showed that the within patients f coefficient of correlation between MAP and rSO2 was 0.20 (95 % CI:-1.8-0.53), but the coefficient of correlation between patients was 0.82 (95 % CI:0.14-0.72). The stimulation protocol was executed 72 times in 29 patients, resulting in 1050 independently rated stimulus responses. 42 stimuli were excluded because of disagreement between raters. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.38. The response to 91 stimuli in 19 patients was found reactive. The stimulus inducing EEG reactivity most often was clapping, 29 %. Passive eye opening least often induced EEG reactivity, 16 %.  There was statistically significant negative correlation between EEG coma scale on day 1 and 7 with GOS ( p > 0.001). There was statistically significant negative correlation between NSE on day 1 and 3 with GOS (p > 0.001) (Table 44) . There was statistically significant positive correlation between EEG scale on day 1 and 7 with neuron specific enolase on day 1 and 3 (Table 45) . Baseline data indicated no consistent TTM strategy with documented TT ranging from 35 to 37°C, with no target documented in 50 %. Only 28 % were actively cooled, while 50 % were pyrexial (defined as >37.5°C) and all but one patient (94 %) exceeded the TTM target of 36°C by at least 0.5°C. Prior to intervention, the average time spent above 37.5°C was 5.8 hours and the average time above 36.5°C was 11.8 hours. Following the intervention, TTs ranged from 36-36.5°C with an increased proportion of patients (12, 63 %) having the desired TT of 36°C. A decreased proportion, 26 % regrettably still had no documented TT, however significantly more patients (13, 68 %) were actively cooled. Only 4 patients (21 %) were pyrexial, while 12 still exceeded 36.5°C (63 %). Encouragingly, after the introduction of the protocol, the average time spent above 37.5°C was 1.15 hours (80 % reduction) and the average time above 36.5°C was 4.2 hours (64 % reduction). Only 16 % of patients achieved target temperature within 4 hours, with 25 % still not achieving target within 16 hours of ROSC and 44 % were maintained at the target for 12-24 hours. The target was chosen as 32-24 degrees in 73 % of patients. Rewarming occurred at a a rate of <0.5 degrees per hour in less than 50 % of the patients. Despite these findings there was no correlation between neurological outcome and adherence or not to the current evidence based recommendations. Of 115 OHCA patients who completed TTM, median time to weaning from ventilation was 6 days (4-8: IQR Introduction c-Fos is well used to detect a pathogenesis in CNS disorders. We examined changes in c-Fos immunoreactivity in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVNT) and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus-(PVNT) after myocardial infarction (MI) in rats. The average infarct size of the left ventricle circumference was about 44 % after MI. Neuronal damage/death was not detected in both PVNH and PVNT after MI. c-Fos immunoreactive (+) cells were hardly found in both nuclei of the sham-group. However, c-Fos + cells were increased in both nuclei after MI and peaked in the PVNH and PVNT 3 days and 14 days, respectively, after MI. At 56 days after MI, c-Fos + cells were barely found in both nuclei. Patients were divided into two groups-discharged alive and died in hospital. The average age of patients was 75,27 ± 12,6 (SD) years.  In the (N + ischemia)-groups, a significant neuronal death was observed in the polymorphic layer (PL) from 1 day after ischemia-reperfusion. In the (H + ischemia)-groups, neuronal death was also observed in the PL from 1 day post-ischemia; the degree of the neuronal death was severer than that in the (N + ischemia)-groups. In addition, we examined the gliosis of astrocytes and microglia using anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1). GFAP+ and Iba-1+ glial cells were much more activated in the (H + ischemia)-groups than those in the (N + ischemia)-groups. On the other hand, immunoreactivities and levels of SOD1 rather than SOD2 were significantly lower in the (H + ischemia)-groups than those in the (N + ischemia)-groups. In the ischemia-group, we found a significant loss of pyramidal neurons in the stratum pyramidale (SP) of the hippocampal CA1 region at 5 days post-ischemia compared with the sham-group. In all of the ischemia + RIPoC-groups, the loss of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region at 5 days post-ischemia was not different from that in the ischemia-group. None of the patients' brain imaging was normal at the time of the diagnosis of neurological alterations including mostly delirium. Twelve patients showed white matter hyperintensity (leukoencephalopathy), three patients showed ischemic lesions and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome findings were evident in three patients. Unexpected findings of cerebral atrophy not relating to age were seen in seven patients. The lesions were correlated with disease severity and GOS. No unexpected events were encountered during transport and MRI scan. A total of 62 patients (34 in the standard group and 28 in the L-carnitine group) accomplished the inclusion criteria. L-Carnitine supplementation resulted in significant reductions in ammonemia (47.9 ± 6 vs. 61.9 ± 11.39 μ mol/L), determined after 24 hours, levels compared with baseline (P < 0.001), whereas this parameter remained still high in standard group. The trend was similar for plasma VPA levels (p < 0.05). Studied parameters were not influenced by gender, but were correlated with age (p = 0.01). In the training set and validation set, 190 and 163 stimuli of 13 and 7 patients, respectively, were included. The prevalence of a reactive response is 8.3 % in the training set and 3.1 % in the validation set. The non-parametric power spectral density with a difference of 30 %, in 5 second epochs, averaged over 5 channels was found to be the optimal method for automatic analysis. This resulted in a sensitivity of 92.9 % (95%CI 87.6-96. Conclusions Automatic analysis of EEG reactivity based on the differences in spectral characteristics detects reactivity. With further research we will optimize this method to increase objectivity of EEG reactivity testing. Totally 3,218 patients were included (1,238 in the development and 1,980 in the validation cohort). Both APACHE II and SAPS II showed good discrimination (AUC 0.84, AUC 0.85, respectively) but did not outperform the reference model (AUC 0.85; compared to APACHE II, p = 0.133; compared to SAPS II, p = 0.141). SOFA, however, displayed significantly poorer performance compared to the other models (AUC of 0.76). All models showed poor calibration (p < 0.05). Age was found to be a particularly strong predictor of death in patients with GCS 9-12, as the mortality for patients aged <40 was only 8 %, yet being as high as 43 % for patients aged >79. Multiple risk factors have been identified for SAH including: Loss of consciousness, family history, hypertension, polycystic kidneys, excessive alcohol intake and smoking. The aetiology of SAH in the majority (>85 %) of patients is an aneurysm in the "Circle of Willis" [2] . CT sensitivity within eligible studies ranged from 91-100 % [2] , the largest study was of a prospective design and included 3132 patients and reported 100 % sensitivity if CT is performed within 6 hours of symptom onset [1] . Recent work in the UK including 2248 patients who underwent an LP concluded that an LP to be of low diagnostic yield with the investigation of choice in patients equivocal LP findings or recurrent symptoms was CT Angiography [2] . The  One hundred and fourteen patients were included in the study (mean age 53. Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may affect the pharmacokinetics of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) leading to the potential for ineffective post-traumatic seizure (PTS) prophylaxis. Levetiracetam (LEV) is increasingly utilized for the prophylaxis of PTS. Recent studies suggest that neurocritical care patients may require higher LEV doses to achieve therapeutic trough levels of 12-20mcg/mL [1, 2] . The aim of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics of LEV in the early (less than or equal to 7 days after injury) post-TBI period and evaluate the incidence of seizures. Evaluation of 26 patients resulted in a median LEV trough of 9.7mcg/ mL (IQR 6.75-18.8) with only 19.2 % of patients within trough goal (57.6 % below goal, 23.1 % above goal). A subset of 15 patients had two consecutive LEV levels, which allowed for pharmacokinetic evaluation, resulting in median maximum concentration (Cmax) = 32.2mcg/mL, minimum concentration (Cmin) = 8.1mcg/mL, volume of distribution = 28.5 L, and half-life = 7.4 hours. The most common maintenance dose was 1 g twice daily (57.6 % of patients), followed by 1.5 g twice daily (23.1 %). Median duration of LEV therapy was 7 days. Seizures occurred in 7 patients during admission (26.9 %), with the majority of seizures occurring in the first 24 hours of admission. Median ICU and hospital LOS were 11 and 15 days, respectively, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 11.5 %. Algorithm 1 identified six outliers with distinct and extreme physiological trajectories and eGOS. (n = 149, eGOS 5; n = 3, eGOS 7; n = 2, eGOS 1; n = 1, eGOS 1). The patients in Algorithm 2 did not separate into clusters (n = 149, eGOS = 5). Algorithm 3 revealed three clusters (n = 65, eGOS 5; n = 58, eGOS 5; n = 26, eGOS 6) with similar physiological trajectories and outcomes. However, as well as having a slightly better outcome, the cluster with an eGOS of 6 was older than the other two clusters and had a higher CPP and mean BP. In ischemic tissue extravascular volume will decrease and we have cytotoxic edema. In case of microvascular and trauma damage we will have vasogenic edema and extracellular space will expand (Fig. 90) . By administrating HS we can monitor changes of intracellular and extracellular volumes. Conclusions BI is fast and rapid indicator to any volume changes in tissue level and is useful method to measure brain tissue status in icu as indicator of HS administration resultativity and rebound effect. Over the course of their hospital stay, 1991 patients (28.19 %; 95%CI 27.16 to 29.25)) received RBC transfusions among 7062 patients suffering from traumatic brain injury, with frequencies varying from 0 to 43 % between centers. Female gender, age 55-65 (in reference to patients aged < 55), anemia, coagulopathy, sepsis, bleeding, hypovolemic shock, presence of multiple other comorbidities, face, thoracic and abdominal, spine, lower extremities and skin injuries, as well as invasive interventions were associated with higher frequency of RBC transfusions. Trauma severity and invasive interventions explained 76 % of the observed variation. Mortality, complications and discharge elsewhere than home were increased in patients who received RBC transfusions. ICU length of stay and hospital length of stay were also longer in patients who received RBC transfusions. When stratified, patients who were anemic on admission showed neither benefit nor disadvantage on any outcome relative to RBC transfusions. Similar results were obtained for stratum of patients who were diagnosed with sepsis on admission. Conclusions RBC transfusion is common in patients with traumatic brain injury and is potentially associated with unfavourable outcomes. Important variation between centers was observed, and highlights the need for stronger evidence over optimal transfusion practices in this population. Considering the potential impact of RBC on brain oxygenation in this population, rigorous trials evaluating Hb triggers for transfusion are needed. We included 215 patients (78 % male; mean age: 45 years). A third of patients were transfused over their ICU stay (n = 66)). The median pre-transfusion hemoglobin levels in patients who were transfused were 81 g/L (IQR 67 to 100); and 110 g/L (IQR 93 to 123) in patients who did not receive red blood cells. Worse outcomes were significantly more frequent in patients who were transfused in adjusted models ( . A non-statistically significant trend toward higher risk ratios for unfavorable outcomes following transfusions in strata of patients with higher hemoglobin levels was observed. No significant modification of transfusion effect by age, presence of comorbidities, or traumatic brain injury severity was observed. In the period of the study, 1789 patients were admitted to the ICU and 13 PGWH patients were included. There were 10 male patients (77 %) and 3 female (23 %), with a mean age of 30 years (range 14-64). There were no self-inflicted lesions (all PGWH were results of aggression). Glasgow Coma Scale at admission was 8 or less in 10 patients. On admission, 7 patients were anisocoric, 8 presenting shock, 5 had associated body lesions from another gunshot wound (such as limbs or in the thorax). Mean SAPS 3 was 67 (range 35-94) and mean Apache II, 26 (range 8-37). The CT scan findings were: midline shift in 8 patients, 7 single lobe haemorrhages (such as frontal or parietal lobe), and 6 patients with bleeding in more than one lobe. Six patients had subarachnoid and 3 had intraventricular hemorrhage. Early surgical procedure was made to 10 patients (mainly decompressive craniectomy). The mean hospital length of stay was 21 days (range 2 to 136 days). Six patients had wound infection, and three, infection in other sites. The mortality rate for the entire group was 54 % (7 out 13). 4 patients progressed to brain death. Of the six patients discharged from the hospital, four had good outcome (defined as modified Rankin scores of 0-3), and two, bad outcome (modified Rankin of 4). Using a curriculum map, doctors' knowledge of specific curriculum learning increased from 42 % to 88 %, an increase of 46 percentage points. 100 % stated that a curriculum map was useful/very useful. 100 % found interacting with a live patient a positive learning experience. 92 % stated it improved realism and the learning experience compared to a high-fidelity mannequin. 100 % felt a live patient was superior for non-technical skills. A total of eight out of 15 planned sessions were delivered. Feedback on the scenarios indicate that participants 'Strongly Agree' (72 %) or 'Agree' (18 %) that the scenarios were useful and improved their understanding of the clinical subject (Strongly Agree 60 %, Agree 40 %). They also 'Strongly Agree' (50 %) or 'Agree' (50 %) that discussion of the non-clinical aspects of the scenarios was useful. When asked to identify one thing they learnt from each scenario, multiple respondents identified non-technical aspects such as the importance of communication within the team, situational awareness and closed loop feedback. A number of important logistical issues were identified through the simulation program. These included a lack of knowledge on the contents of the difficult airway trolley and a lack of familiarity on the correct procedure for activating the hospital's Massive Haemorrhage Protocol. Out of 1073 involved cases, there were only 208 patients with elevated serum Troponin-T levels, representing about 19.38 %, those whom were proved to have acute coronary syndrome were only 83, representing 7.7 % from the whole studied cases, (having a cardiac cause for their chest pain). Although patients who describe chest pain to the emergency physician represent an immediate challenge, but still we conclude that there is over utilization of Troponin test which increases workload and costs. In patients with syncope, echocardiography is an imaging modality with high sensitivity and specificity for clinically significant structural disease [3] . Current guidelines only recommend formal echocardiographic evaluation in patients with clinically suspected structural cardiac disease [3] . Clinical assessment tools including composite risk scores have repeatedly been demonstrated to be poor at identifying structural heart disease [3] . Syncopal events in such context are associated with significant increase in mortality [1] [2] [3] . Studies have demonstrated that emergency physicians can attain a high level of proficiency in echocardiography allowing diagnostic evaluation of complex systolic and diastolic dysfunction and in operators with > 250 examinations, accurate identification of structural disease [3] . Focused-echocardiography can be safely integrated into the clinical assessment process in the presence of an experienced operator and yields findings superior to clinical assessment alone [3] . Insertion of an uncapped 14G cannula resulted in a significant pneumothorax developing in <2 minutes. Each insertion (n = 3) resulted in the lung-point moving laterally by >10 cm in <2 minutes in all cases. At 2 minutes, swine were observed to develop a significant tachypnoea (respiratory rate >50/min) and showed signs of respiratory distress. Upon aspiration of 800 ml-1200ml of air, normal physiology was restored. During aspiration, the lung-point was observed to shift medially and apically over time, confirming lung re-inflation. [2] . Despite introductory training few use IO devices on a regular basis. There is increasing recognition that lifesaving technical skills used in emergencies but required infrequently, need regular practise to prevent 'psychomotor skill fatigue' [3, 4] . The EZ-IO® tea trolley was used to train a mixture of 36 consultants, juniors, nurses and ODPs. 97 % reported an increase in their confidence using the EZ-IO® system and 100 % found the 'tea trolley' a useful teaching method (mean Linkert 4.9, 5 = most useful). Following training 100 % of participants were correctly able to identify the locations of EZ-IO® devices for their clinical areas and identify the correct anatomical sites for IO insertion. The total number of cycling associated injuries that attended our ED in 2014 was 534, accounting for just over 1.  Data was collected from 47 of the 48 patients who attended the rehabilitation clinic (median age was 52 (IQR, 44-57) median ICU LOS was 15 (IQR 9-25), median APACHE II was 23 (IQR 18-27) and 32 of the patients were men (67 %)). Prior to admission to ICU 43 % of patients were taking analgesics and this increased to 81 % at the time of their clinic visit. The number of patients at step two and above on the WHO pain ladder also increased from 34 % to 56 %. Thirty three of the patients (66 %) was male. The mean age was 57.4 and the mean APACHE II score was 18.7. Glasgow Coma Score was equal or less than 8 in 66 % of all patients. A total of 100 assessments performed by a resident and an intensivist were recorded from 50 patients using the CPOT and the BPS. Scores of the CPOT and the BPS during the painful procedures were both significantly higher than those during the nonpainful procedures. The agreement between CPOT and BPS during painful and nonpainful stimuli was ranged as; sensitivity 66.7 % -90.3 %; specificity 89.7 % -97.9 %; kappa value 0.712 -0.892. The agreement between resident and intensivist during painful and non-painful stimuli was ranged from 97 % to 100 % and the kappa value was between 0.904 -1.0. There were 156 mechanically ventilated patients prescribed sedative agents, 66 and 90 patients in the prospective and retrospective group, respectively. The median duration of ICU LOS was reduced from 10.0 days in the retrospective group to 6.5 days in the prospective group (p = 0.002). The median hospital stay and ventilators days were significantly different between two groups. The median hospital stay was reduced from 30.50 days in the retrospective group to 17.50 days in the prospective group(p = 0.000). The ventilator days were 14 days and 8.5 days in retrospective and prospective group, respectively (p = 0.008). Mortality remained unchanged, 53.03 % in the prospective group compared to 46.67 % in the retrospective group (p = 0.432). One hundred and two patients (n = 102) were enrolled during the period of the study. Among those patients, forty six patients (n = 46) were agitated. Comparing the two groups of patient, agitated patients had higher incidence of infection (p < 0.02) compared to the non-agitated patients. In addition, there was a significant difference type of sedation used (p < 0.001), ventilators free days (p < 0.001) and length of stay. See Table 47 . Data on 92 patients was collected. There was no significant difference in these baseline characteristics and interventions known to increase the risk of delirium. Sedative drugs used in the two groups were similar apart from the fact that patients in the full moon group received more benzodiazepines (0 % vs. 10 %) and more haloperidol (0 % vs. 12 %). There was no statistical difference between the incidence of delirium during the new moon (CAM-ICU positive 20 %) and the full moon groups (CAM-ICU positive 14 %). Thirty-three (23 male) patients, mean age 64.5 (SD10.9) years had data with acceptable quality.CBFV step responses at T2 were markedly different from T1 and T3 (Fig. 96) with corresponding values of ARI (Fig. 97) Introduction: This study investigated risk factors for prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) in an elective surgical patient cohort. LOS is an important outcome as a marker of ICU resource consumption, and there is increasing pressure to use beds more efficiently. If we can estimate the common LOS for common ICU patient groups, such as elective procedure patients, and identify risk factors for prolonged LOS in these groups, then beds can be booked in a more prospective way. This could help improve the flow efficiency of these patients through intensive care beds. We recommend routine assessment of high risk patients in the recovery room to determine suitability for admission to CCU. We have introduced a proforma outlining peri-operative risk factors to allow consistent assessment of suitability for ward-based care.
