Hemodynamics and electrocardiograph. Arterial blood pressure trace in spontaneous breathing SPF animals showed significantly reduced pulse pressure (systolic pressure minus diastolic pressure) despite similar mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) compared to conventional rats (Fig. 1a,b) . Timing of oscillations in the blood pressure waveform during spontaneous breathing were similar between the two colonies. The ECG of SPF animals showed a range of abnormal cardiac rhythms including premature ventricular contractions (skipped beats), salvos and bigeminy episodes (Fig. 2a,b) . Arrhythmias were found in 85% of SPF animals (17/20) compared to no arrhythmias in the conventional rats (p < 0.001) ( Table 1 ). There were no differences in RR or QRS complex duration, however SPF rats had significantly prolonged QTc intervals (0.14 vs. 0.11 sec; p = 0.033) ( Table 1 for data. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Coagulation profile. ROTEM analysis showed no differences in EXTEM clot times or clot amplitude (maximum clot firmness) between SPF and conventional rats. However, both SPF animals were hyperfibrinolytic, indicated by EXTEM maximum lysis (ML) percentages >15 (26% and 24% vs. 8% and 6% in conventional rats) (Fig. 3 ). Hyperfibrinolysis in SPF rats was confirmed with APTEM test which showed correction of ML to 6% and 3% with the addition of aprotonin which inhibits plasmin activation of fibrinolysis. Blood counts. The baseline total blood counts for conventional and SPF rats is shown in Table 2 . The data indicate that the SPF rats had an overall aberrant hematology, a lower haemoglobin level and a 1.5-fold increase in platelet count compared to conventional rats. The number of white cells and lymphocytes were 1.4-fold higher than in conventional rats (p < 0.05), and monocyte counts 2.7-fold higher. Neutrophils were also 1.6-fold higher in SPF rats (p < 0.05). The hematological data of Said and Abiola 12 highlight the differences in the SPF and conventional animals, supporting the notion of an aberrant hematology ( Table 2 ). Health screening. The externally commissioned health screening for randomly selected rats from the SPF, conventional and SPF animals acclimated for 7 days in the laboratory are shown in Table 3 . The standout result is the presence of Proteus spp. in the two SPF groups and not the conventional rats. No animals had pinworms. One out of two animals from all groups had the presence of Entamoeba muris. One SPF animal had Staphylococcus aureus present, however this bacterium was not found in the 7-day laboratory acclimated SPF or conventional rats (Table 3 ). Viral screening using enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques confirmed all rats were negative for Kilham Rat virus, Parvovirus (rNS1), Pneumonia Virus of Mice, Rat Coronavirus, Rat Minute Virus, Rat Parvovirus Rat Theilovirus, and Toolans H-1.
