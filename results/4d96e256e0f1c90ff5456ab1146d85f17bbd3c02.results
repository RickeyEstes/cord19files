Study population. During the fall and winter 2012-2013, a total of 140 throat swabs were tested. Patients were from four different provinces: 68, 22, 24 and 26 individuals from Tehran, Alborz, Qom and Lorestan, respectively. All patients were hospitalized children less than two years of age with RTIs. 57% of all participants were male. This slight predominance in male participants was not statistically significant. HBoV Frequency. HBoV DNA was detected in 15 (10.7 %) of 140 respiratory samples (95% confidence interval, 5.6-15.8). The male: female ratio was 10:5 in the HBoV-positive patients which did not differ significantly from the HBoV-negative patients by using X 2 test (P> 0.05). During this 6-months study, low positive rate of 4.3% was detected in October 2012 while high positive rate of 15.1% was found in February 2013 in four provinces. The estimated prevalence of each province is given in Table 1 . Among the 15 HBoV positive samples, co-infection with RSV were found in two (13.3%) samples while all of them were influenza A and B negative. Phylogenetic analysis. In 15 positive samples only five were available for VP2 PCR which analyzed for identification of genotypes and comparison with HBoV reference sequences. Phylogenetic tree was drawn with VP2 genes by using the neighbor-joining method. In sequencing and phylogenetic analysis all five positive samples belonged to HBoV1 (Fig.1) .
