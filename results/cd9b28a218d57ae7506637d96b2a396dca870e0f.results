From 1 January 2008 through 30 June, 2013, 5,466 patients meeting a SARI case definition were enrolled, of which 94% (5,147/5,466) were tested for influenza virus (Table 3) . Among the SARI cases tested, 8% (423/5,147) were positive for influenza. Incidence estimates for influenza-associated SARI varied by influenza season and health care facility (Table 2 ). Annual incidence rates ranged from 0.5 to 15.4 cases per 100,000 population. Across all facilities, on average the 0-4 year age group had the highest incidence of influenza-associated SARI (range 32-42 cases per 100,000 population) followed by those aged 65 years and over (12-27 cases per 100,000 population). Influenza-associated hospitalizations ranged in age from < one month to 87 years of age, with a median age of 6 years (IQR 1-38 years). The median time from illness onset to hospital admission was three days (IQR 2-5) and the median length of stay was also three days (IQR 2-5 days). Preexisting chronic medical conditions were reported by 35% of influenza-associated hospitalizations; the most common condition reported among influenza cases was cardiac disease (10%). Of influenza-associated hospitalizations, 8% required admission to the intensive care unit (Table 3) . A higher proportion of those with influenza (4%) required intubation as compared to only 3% of those SARI cases who were influenza negative (p = 0.01). Over the surveillance period, 14 influenza-associated cases died; six deaths were in cases under five years of age and nine were among females. Chronic medical conditions were reported in 36% (5/14) of those who died compared to 44% (57/129) in non-influenza associated deaths (p = 0.54). Three of the influenza-associated cases who died were reported as admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and one was reported as ventilated. Among influenza-associated cases, 65% (273/423) were positive for influenza A and 36% (151/423) were positive for influenza B. Among Influenza A cases 4% were A(H1N1), 19% were A(H3N2), and 61% were A(H1N1)pdm09; subtyping results were not available for 46 influenza A cases. The median age of A(H1N1)pdm09 cases was 8.5 years (IQR: 1-35) compared to 24 years (IQR: 1-63, p = 0.047) for other influenza A cases and 4 years (IQR: 1-40) for all influenza types (p = 0.44). A smaller proportion (31%) of A(H1N1)pdm09 cases had underlying medical conditions compared to other influenza A cases (47%) (p = .01). On average the month with the lowest number of influenza cases over this study was July. Based on this, data were aggregated and plotted from July 1 st of one year through June 30 th of the following year. The peak of influenza activity varied across seasons (Fig 1) . Influenza activity peaked in November Influenza Burden in Oman SARI cases were due to influenza while in the other seasons the peak of activity ranged from 14% to 19% of SARI cases being positive for influenza (Fig 1) .
