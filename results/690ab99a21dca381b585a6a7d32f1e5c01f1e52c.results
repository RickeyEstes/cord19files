A. First series of experiments: PEEP = 2 cmH 2 O Lung mechanics. The first series of experiments was performed at a PEEP = 2 cmH 2 O, a PEEP level that is commonly used in animal studies that aim to study VILI (see Table 1 ). Ventilation with 8 mL/kg and no RM (lowV T noRM) caused a continuous decrease of pulmonary compliance (C) over more than two hours that reached a plateau at approximately 30% of the physiological baseline value (Fig. 1 ). Within this time pulmonary resistance (R) nearly tripled. Resistance and compliance showed less dramatic trends in mice ventilated with 16 mL/kg and no RM (highV T noRM). In this group C plateaued earlier (60 min) at about 60% of the baseline value and R increased to a lesser degree (,25%). R and C differed significantly between the lowV T noRM and the highV T noRM group (R: p,0.01; C: p,0.001). Respiratory input impedance revealed major alterations in the periphery of the lung. Tissue damping (G) and tissue elastance (H) were elevated in both highV T noRM and lowV T noRM mice, reaching significantly higher values in the lowV T noRM group (G: p,0.01; H: p,0.001). In the latter group, airway resistance (R aw ) was increased as well. The increase in G, H and R aw indicates that low V T ventilation without RM leads to closure of peripheral areas of the lung and causes a small degree of airway constriction. In consequence, hysteresivity (G/H = g) decreased slightly over time, but was in a comparable range in all groups. These findings indicate that ventilation without RM leads to impaired lung functions, which stabilize within two hours, though at a low level. We therefore examined the effect of repetitive RM (30 cmH 2 O) every 5 min. In both the lowV T RM5 and the highV T RM5 group, lung mechanics stayed in a physiological range and remained unchanged during the whole experiment. Depending on the different tidal volumes, C and H differed reciprocally between low-and highV T groups (p,0.05). The stability of the lung mechanics demonstrates that application of deep inflations of 1 s duration and 30 cmH 2 O are sufficient to prevent the deterioration of lung functions in healthy mouse lungs ventilated with 2 cmH 2 O PEEP and moderate tidal volumes. Further, we examined whether it would suffice to apply RM only every 60 min instead of every 5 min. This was studied in the low V T group (lowV T RM60) only. In this group, respiratory conditions were instable. R and C worsened comparable to the lowV T noRM group, but improved significantly after each RM. These alterations were reflected in changes in G and H. However, even though each RM was beneficial, after six hours tissue elastance had increased permanently, indicating that one deep inflation per hour is not sufficient to maintain lung volume at base line values. This is illustrated by the finding that H (p,0.001), R, C, G (all p,0.01) and R aw (p,0.05) were significantly different between the lowV T RM60 and the lowV T RM5 group. Heart frequency, blood pressure and oxygenation. Anaesthesia with pentobarbital sodium resulted in reduced heart frequency (300-400 min 21 ) and mean blood pressure (50-60 mmHg), compared to average data of unsedated mice. ECG (data not shown), HF and BP remained unchanged throughout ventilation and were not significantly different between the groups (Fig. 2 ). This demonstrates that ventilation and recruitment strategy did not affect the circulation. The fluid support with 200L NaCl per hour in all groups was adequate to keep blood pressure stable. Oxygen saturation, measured by pulsoxymetry, was over 90% in all mice at all times (data not shown). Blood gas analysis. Blood gas analyses revealed that infusion of saline and application of 3% CO 2 in the high V T groups were adequate to keep the acid-base status stable and that ventilation resulted in normocapnia in the lowV T RM5 and highV T RM5 group, with pCO 2 levels ranging from 35 to 40 mmHg ( Table 3) . The pO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was between 530 and 620 mmHg in both RM5 groups and in the highV T noRM group (Figure 3 ). Most mice ventilated with highV T noRM had physiological pCO 2 levels after six hours. The pO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was decreased significantly to around 200 mmHg in the lowV T noRM group, indicating acute respiratory failure. In this group, impaired gas exchange was further indicated by an increase in pCO 2 levels to about 60 mmHg, leading to respiratory acidosis with a mean pH of 7.22. Mice in the lowV T RM60 group showed very heterogeneous pO 2 /FiO 2 ratios between 260 and 570 mmHg and markedly increased pCO 2 levels as well as initiating hypercapnic acidosis. Bicarbonate (HCO 3 2 ) was only slightly reduced, resulting in negative values for standard base excess, but did not indicate metabolic imbalance. Pulmonary microvascular permeability. Total protein levels were increased in all ventilated mice, compared to unventilated controls. Protein levels were highest in the groups Figure 5 . Cytokine levels. Cytokines were quantified in blood serum or BAL supernatant with commercial ELISA kits after six hours of ventilation and in unventilated mice. (Unventilated: n = 5, lowV T RM5 n = 6, highV T RM5 n = 6, lowV T noRM n = 4 in BAL and n = 5 in serum, highV T noRM n = 4, lowV T RM60 n = 5). * p,0.05, ** p,0.01, *** p,0.001, 1 *** p,0.001 versus all other groups). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0024527.g005 without RM (Fig. 4A) . The BSA BAL/serum ratio confirmed that ventilation augmented microvascular permeability in the lung, particularly when inspiratory pressures were high, as in the groups ventilated without repetitive recruitment (Fig. 4B) . Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) were elevated in the BAL fluid and blood serum from all ventilated mice (Fig. 5A, B, E, F) . BAL fluid from mice ventilated with lowV T RM5 showed a less dramatic increase in these pro-inflammatory cytokines. In both RM5 groups serum levels of IL-6 and KC were clearly lower than in all other ventilation groups. Interestingly, Interferon-c induced protein (IP-10) and Tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) were not significantly increased in the BAL from ventilated mice, compared to unventilated controls (Fig. 5C, D) . Differential cell count in the BAL fluid. The only cell types found in BAL fluid of unventilated control mice were monocytes and macrophages. In contrast, all samples from ventilated mice also contained neutrophils (Fig. 6) . Numbers of neutrophils were highest in mice ventilated with high V T . Considerably less neutrophils were recruited to alveoli of lowV T mice, whereof the group lowV T RM5 had the lowest neutrophil count. Histopathology. Histopathological samples revealed that no severe lung injury was induced by the ventilation strategies applied (Fig. 7) . Nonetheless, significant histopathological alterations were present in all ventilated lungs and were most obvious in mice ventilated with high V T (Fig. 8) . Alveolar septal thickening was observed in most of the ventilated lungs, resulting in a score of one. A score of two was given, when neutrophils were observed additionally, as in most lungs from highV T mice. This is in line with the results from the differential cell count in the BAL fluid. Only some highV T noRM mice showed alveolar congestion, bringing the lung injury score up to three. Hyaline membranes were not observed in any sections, indicating that the applied ventilation strategies induced only moderate injury in the healthy lungs.
