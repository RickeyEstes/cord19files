Histological examination of the nasal mucosa revealed no evidence of concurrent rhinitis (cf., [11] ) in any of the animals studied. However, several animals of various ages exhibited one or two small adhesions between adjacent olfactory turbinates which were interpreted as indicating a prior history of rhinitis (see Discussion section, below). Over the 33 month range of ages studied, mean IGL volume increased in approximately linear fashion by a factor of 63%, from 6.0 mm 3 in the 3-month old animals to 9.8 mm 3 in the 36-month old animals. The effect of age on IGL volume was statistically significant (analysis of variance: F(3,12)=21.4, p<0.01). In Fig. 3 , group mean IGL volumes for the F344 rats of the present study are shown graphically along with mean IGL volumes for Sprague-Dawtey rats (Wisconsin strain) reported by Hinds and McNelly [6] . In comparison, the mean (-+s.e.m.) body w~ts of the animals. recorded on the day of surgery, were as follows: 3 months--197.5__4.7 g; 18 months--394.5+-10.3 g; 30 months---399.3-+ 16.1 g; and 36 months--323.5_+21.1 g. In contrast to the dramatic effect of age on IGL volume, none of the indices of mitral cell perikary-'al or nuclear size varied significantly across ages. In Fig. 4 , estimated crosssectional perikaryal and nuclear areas are shown as relative frequency histograms for each age group. Analyses of variance based on each animal's mean cross-sectional perikaryal and nuclear areas showed no statistically signif'mant age effect for either parameter. F(3,12)=1.461 and 2.550 respec- Fig. 5 . Neither parameter varied significantly as a function of age (analyses of variance; F(3,12)= 1.291 and 2.581, respectively; both p >0.10). It should be noted that the latter comparisons are not statistically orthogonal with the respective cross-sectional area comparisons in that the estimates of mean perikaryal and nuclear volume were derived mathematically from the area measurements. In Fig. 6 , group mean perikaryal volumes for the F344 rats of the present study are shown along with comparable data of Hinds and McNelly for two substrains of Sprague-Dawley rats [6, 8] . Between 3 and 24 months of age, mean mitrai cell perikaryal volumes increased by factors of approximately 100% and 200% for the CD and Wisconsin substrains of Sprague-Dawley rats, respectively. In comparison, the three oldest groups of F344 rats all exhibited mean mitral cell perikaryal volumes which were within 10% of the value for the youngest group. The pattern of strain differences was essentially the same for nuclear volume determinations (cf., [6] ). When perikaryal cross-sectional areas were grouped according to the quadrant of the MOB in which each cell lay, a small but consistent trend was evident such that profiles in the dorsal quadrant were, on average, slightly larger, profiles in the ventral quadrant were slightly smaller, and profiles in the medial and lateral quadrants were of an intermediate size. This observation is contrary to that of Hinds and McNelly, who noted slightly smaller profiles in the dorsal quadrant and slightly larger profiles in the ventral quadrant [6] . In view of the fact that their sections were cut in a plane "coronal to the long axis of the olfactory bulb" ( [6] , pp. 346-347), while in the present study, the plane of section was more nearly vertical, corresponding roughly to the coronal plane of Krnig and Klippel [13] , both observations likely reflect the influence of cutting angle relative to the long axis of the cells rather than true regional differences in mitral cell size. Figure 7 shows the mean numbers of mitral cells exhibiting two nucleoli in the plane of section for the four age groups. This pattern is similar to that observed by Hinds and McNelly [6] in Sprague-Dawley rats (Wisconsin strain), though they reported that the value of this parameter declined to zero by 30 months of age.
