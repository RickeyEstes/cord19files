Interest here lies in the relationship between the psychosocial scores and the frequency of colds with asthma. The mean number of colds/asthma episodes was 1.68 (s.d. 1.45; median: 1.0; range 0-7; 95% confidence limits: 1.38, 1.99). Over 20% of the volunteers did not report an episode of asthma associated with a cold. Initial analyses were conducted to determine whether this group had a different psychosocial profile from those who had one episode or more. The data for these two subgroups are shown in interaction did not have a significant effect. Similarly, introversion, smoking and age had no effect. The next set of analyses was restricted to those who reported at least one episode. An analysis of covariance was conducted to determine whether stress influenced the number of colds with asthma and whether this effect was modified by social support. The other variables were entered as covariates. Median splits were used to categorise the high/low negative life events groups (median=2) and high/low social support groups (median=97). The mean negative life events scores and the mean total ISEL scores for these four groups are shown in Table 2 . A significant interaction (F=5.9 d.f.1,62 PÏ½0.05) between negative life events and social support was observed (see Fig. 1 ). This reflected the greater number of episodes in the high stress low support group. None of the covariates had a significant effect on the number of episodes. The next set of analyses considered the severity of the episodes by distinguishing those that required a visit to the doctor and those which did not. Twenty-seven of the patients were either current or ex-smokers. While this group did not differ in the frequency of cold/asthma episodes they did have more severe episodes which resulted in them having to see their GP more frequently following the illness (chi square=3.84 d.f.1 P=0.05). This is shown in Table 3 . When a logistic regression was carried out including the other independent variables only the effect of smoking was significant (F1,70=3.94 P=0.05).
