Hct and muscle-derived cell transplantation protocol Bone marrow and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells were harvested from two normal donors and transplanted into two irradiated leukocyte antigen-identical cxmd recipients (Figure 1a , Materials and Methods). The hematopoietic cells of one cxmd recipient were all donor derived ( Table 1; G289; full chimera), whereas the second recipient had a mix of donor and recipient hematopoietic cells ( Table 1; G604; mixed chimera). Skeletal muscle-derived mononuclear cells isolated from the same donors were processed for injection immediately after isolation or cultured for 14 days to specifically expand myogenic cells before injection (Figure 1b , Materials and Methods). G289 underwent the myeloablative HCT at 5.5 months of age, followed by muscle-derived cell transplantation at 32 months of age. G604 underwent the nonmyeloablative HCT at 7 months of age, and muscle-derived cell transplantation at 18 months of age.
