The cumulative effects of pollutants and weather factors on the respiratory illnesses have been recognized by many researchers (Schwartz, 2000; Zeger et al., 1999; Dominici et al., 2003; Xia et al., 2002; Xia and Tong, 2006; Shao et al., 2010) . Relevant investigations on the situation were conducted by (Xia et al., 2002; Xia and Tong, 2006; Shao et al., 2010) . In our data analysis, the 'weekend-effect' and the change of hygiene habits, together with the environmental effect, are modeled by (3). Log-transformation is applied to the number of respiratory cases before model fitting. The cumulative effects are incorporated into the model by using lagged variables. For ease of implementation and interpretation, we use the same lags for all variables in our model (Xia et al., 2002; Shao et al., 2010) . That is, for each time point t, X = (X 1t , . . . , X p,t ) is the collection of all the environmental and weather factors with lag l, where X i,t = (x i,t , . . . , x i,t−l ) with x i,t being observed value of the ith variable at time t and l is an integer to be estimated. The long-term effect of changing hygiene habits is measured by the expected amount of change (jump) on the number of admissions after SARS epidemic. For a given lag l, the efficient dimension M and the optimal bandwidth h are determined by the cross validation criterion given in Eq. (10). We did all computations in Matlab (see http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/). The optimal results have lag l = 7 and M = 3, which are the same as those given before (Xia et al., 2002; Shao et al., 2010) . The parameter estimates for the SARS effect (modeled by a growth curve) and the weekly effect are given in Table 2 . The optimal bandwidth is h = 0.339. It can be seen from Table 2 that all the parameters in the growth curve part are statistically significant at the level of 0.05. The expected difference of the number of respiratory cases (after log-transformation) due to the change of public health measures is estimated asξ 1 = −0.4977 (the second term in the growth curve is very small in the beginning of the public health measures), which means that the number of total respiratory cases after the SARS epidemic reduces 39.21% in comparison with the expected number of respiratory cases (original data) before the SARS epidemic. The shape and 95% confidence limits of the growth curve which model the effect of SARS over time is given in Fig. 5 which clearly shows the significance of the public health measure due to the SARS outbreak on the number of administration. However, the impact eventually fades over time as modeled by the logistic growth curve. The impact is obvious as nearly all the parameter estimates are significantly different from zero at 95% of the confidence level (Table 2) . It can also be seen from Table 2 that the weekly effect is statistically significant, with an obvious lower number of administration during Saturday and Sunday but higher on Monday. The cross-validation CV = 0.0502. The root mean squared error between observed and fitted values is RMSE = 0.1414, which translates to the root mean squared error RMSE = 31.25 for the original number of the cases. Therefore, the model works reasonably well to capture the change of the number of hospital administrations. The residuals are plotted in Fig. 6 . This reduction in the number of respiratory diseases is not an accidental event. It has come from a combination of better public awareness and the efforts of the HKSAR government. A by-product of our model is the assessment of the weekend-effect and the impact of different factors on the number of admitted patients. The change of ratios of the total respiratory cases for each day of the week to that for Friday is given in Table 2 . We can see that the number of reported cases on Saturday is less than Friday and decreases a little further on Sunday, before a big increase on Monday. Tuesday and Wednesday are only slightly more than Friday before more cases on Table 3 Coefficients of the first efficient dimension reduction direction with Lag l = 7, M = 3 and h = 0.332. The coefficients of greater than 0.1 are highlighted by bold font. Thursday. Friday has the smallest reported cases in comparison with other weekdays, perhaps again due to the weekend effect. We do not tend to study the detailed holiday effect any further here. The impact of different factors on the number of admitted patients can be assessed by the coefficients B = (β 1 , . . . , β M ) of the index, which are given in Table 3 . We pay special attention to the large coefficients associated with the factors. Following (Xia et al., 2002; Shao et al., 2010) , we regard coefficients with absolute value greater than 0.1 as significant coefficients. With this rationale, a simple way to interpret the results is to look for coefficients larger than 0.1. Let us call these coefficients as large coefficients. Bear in mind that the first dimension accounts the most contribution to the model. We can see that SO 2 , temperature and humidity are important factors for diseases, compared with NO 2 and OZ which have moderate contributions. The RSP and NO x are less important to the respiratory diseases in Hong Kong. The second dimension is set to model the variance which is not included in the first dimension. We can see that for the second dimension, SO 2 , NO x and Humidity are the major factors and RSP still does not show its importance. For the third dimension, all the factors show similar importance except humidity which has no coefficient larger than 0.1. As a comparison, we report here the best model for λ = 0 (i.e., the change of hygiene habits does not affect the respiratory cases), with h = 0.2417 and CV = 0.05924. The root mean squared error between observed and fitted values is RMSE = 0.1802, which translates to the root mean squared error RMSE = 37.25 for the original number of the cases. To see the difference between the models with and without change, we provide the fitted errors (differences between the observed and fitted numbers of cases) in time series plots in Fig. 6 and summary statistics in Tables 3 and 4 . We can see visually from Fig. 6 that the model without change tends to under-fit the observed numbers for the data before SARS and over-fit the observed numbers for the data after SARS. This can be confirmed by the summary statistics in Table 3 . The model with change has smaller residuals with smaller standard deviation for the overall data, the data before SARS and the data after SARS. For the model with change, the summary statistics do not show any trend when the data are splitinto two part (before and after SARS). However, for the model without change, both the mean and median prediction errors are positive for the data before SARS but are negative for the data after SARS, reassuring the importance of incorporating change in the model in order to capture the change after the SARS outbreak.
