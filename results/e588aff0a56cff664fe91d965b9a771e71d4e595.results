General descriptive statistics Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of our Twitter samples. We retrieved MERS-related Twitter data in five languages: Korean (N Z 21,823), English (N Z 4024), Thai (N Z 2084), Japanese (N Z 1334) and Indonesian (N Z 1256) ( Table 1 ). The mean number of posts per user ranged from 1.05 to 1.49. However, the distribution for the number of posts per user is highly skewed, with the median being 1 for all 5 corpora (with interquartile range: 1, 1). The percentage of retweets ranged from 8% (Indonesian) to 96% (Thai). Across the five language corpora, as the proportion of tweets with URLs increased, the proportion of retweets decreased (r Z Ã€0.93, p Z 0.02).
