Prior to the virtual docking, the compounds were sorted into two groups based on their chemical characteristics. Both groups contain the ester function and the chloropyridine moiety inherited from the parent compound. In addition, group I compounds have a furan ring connected to a derivatized benzene moiety (Table 1) ; whereas the group II compounds have a derivatized, six-membered cyclic aromatic system that is linked to the central ester function (Table 2 ).
