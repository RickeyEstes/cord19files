There were no differences in sex distribution in either group. With regard to risk conditions for severity, 73.6% of cases and 38.1% of controls reported having at least one risk factor, with an OR of 4.49 (95%CI 3.09-6.60). When individuals with more than one of these conditions were assessed, the risk of death increased, OR 10.29 (95%CI 6.04-17.85). The following medical conditions were risk factors for death: obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney diseases, neurological diseases and delay in development, chronic liver diseases and immunosuppressive diseases. The immunosuppression-related diseases were: neoplasms (n = 18), HIV/AIDS (n = 8), organ transplants (n = 6), autoimmune diseases (n = 5) and use of immunosuppressants (n = 3). Of the 212 women of reproductive age (10 to 49 years) who were studied, 33.5% were pregnant and there were no differences in the frequency of pregnancy in either group. The use of antiviral treatment during hospitalization was a protective factor against death, with an OR of 0.67 (95%CI 0.45-0.98). When time between onset of symptoms and beginning of antiviral treatment was assessed, there was an 81% protection among individuals who received treatment within the first 48 hours, with an OR of 0.19 (95%CI 0.11-0.35), and 65% between 48 and 72 hours, with an OR of 0.35 (95%CI 0.16-0.74). After 72 hours, there was no significant protection. Median of days between date of onset of symptoms and date of hospitalization was 5.0 among cases and 2.0 among controls (p<0.001). Among patients with chronic pulmonary disease, median was 4.0 days among cases and 2.0 days among controls; among those with asthma, 4.5 days and 2.0 days; and among pregnant women, 4.0 days and 2.0 days, respectively. With regard to health professionals, the median between the date of onset of symptoms and that of hospitalization was three days for both cases and controls. Median between date of hospitalization and of death or hospital discharge was seven days among cases and four days among controls (Table 2) . According to medical charts, fever and cough occurred in 87.8% of cases and 79.3% of controls; and the proportions of dyspnea were 87% and 62.7%, respectively. The definition of cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -SARS (fever+cough+dyspnea) based on information obtained from medical charts occurred in 68.9% of cases and 56.5% of controls. Vomit and diarrhea were present in 8% of cases and 18% of controls. Treatment with antibiotics was used in 95.8% of cases and 73.1% of controls. The mean number of antibiotics used was 4.0 and 1.8 respectively. Among cases, there was a higher proportion of hospitalizations in intensive care units (83.4%x16.8%), use of mechanical ventilation (94.8%x10.8%) and dialysis (25.0%x2.3%). The proportion of complications was higher among cases than controls, with an emphasis on: respiratory distress syndrome (64.7%vs4.9%), shock (69.4%vs1.0%), sepsis (63.2%vs2.3%) and kidney complications (44.6%vs1.3%), respectively. Table 3 shows the laboratory findings of entry tests of patients in the hospital. Cases had lower numbers of leukocytes and platelets and higher values of creatine phosphokinase-CPK, lactic dehydrogenase-LDH, glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, urea and creatinine than controls, with statistical significance. In sub-group analysis, previous conditions of risk for severity and obesity were risk factors for death in univariate analysis for children younger than 18 years and women of reproductive age (10 to 49 years). Among children, presence of immunosuppression, chronic cardiovascular disease and neurological disease/delay in development were also risk factors, as well as diabetes mellitus among women. Treatment with antiviral administered within 72 hours after the onset of symptoms was a protective factor for women of reproductive age. Tables 4 and 5 show variables associated with death in the final models of multiple logistic regression, in all patients studied and in sub-group analysis of adults (aged 18 years and over). In patients in general, risk factors for death were: being aged between 18 and 59 years (reference: until 18 years), having one or more risk conditions for the severity of the disease, obesity, immunosuppression and having sought care prior to hospitalization. Although chronic neurological diseases/delay in development and chronic liver disease were highly associated with death, these variables were excluded from the final model because they had estimates with large confidence intervals. Private health insurance and antiviral treatment administered in the first 72 hours after the onset of symptoms were protective factors against death. Among adults aged 18 years and over, the risk factors for death were having more than one risk factor for severity of the disease, obesity and care prior to hospitalization. The protective factors were: antiviral drug administered in the first 48 hours after the onset of symptoms and being a health professional or health unit worker. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the severity of patients admitted during the study period. The proportion of ICU admissions and use of mechanical ventilation was estimated for epidemiological week of hospitalization, categorized as EW 26 to 28, EW 29 to 31 and EW 32 to 34. The results showed higher proportions of ICU admissions (50.0% x 16.8% x 7.7%) and mechanical ventilation (45.4% x 10.8% x 2.6%) in the three first weeks, among the controls. The cases showed high proportions in all periods analyzed: 89.7% x 84.0% x 76.9% for need of ICU and 89.7% x 97.6% x 89.7% for need of mechanical ventilation, in the 3 periods, respectively. The opportunity for antiviral treatment showed lower proportion of treatment in the first period of the study, in both cases (37.9% x 74.4% x 74.3%) and controls (59.1% x 74.1% x 89.7%). Sensitivity analysis to assess the opportunity for treatment of children and adults showed similar proportions for the groups: 73.9% and 74%, respectively.
