The PS-M method is tested on different datasets that range from small to medium size, as well as short to long genomes. In order to compare and analyze various genomic data, moment vectors are calculated and a matrix of Euclidean pairwise distances between those vectors is constructed. To cluster data into biological groups, a phylogenetic tree is built based on the distance matrix using the UPGMA method (Sokal, 1958) . The running time of our PS-M method is compared to three state-of-the-art methods. The first is the alignment-based method ClustalW (Larkin et al., 2007) implemented on MEGA 6 (Tamura (Katoh et al., 2002) , another alignment-based method using fast Fourier transform. The last method is the alignment-free k-mer method (Vinga and Almeida, 2003) which is implemented on Matlab by Vinga and Almeida (2003) . The running time is recorded in Table 1 . Even though reasonably accurate, ClustalW is significantly time consuming, as it aims to achieve the best possible results neglecting speed and efficiency. MAFFT runs much faster than ClustalW, but it sacrifices some accuracy in exchange. Moreover, errors occurred when we tested the datasets showing limitations of the MAFFT method. The errors are discussed in detail in the next section. Meanwhile, both k-mer and PS-M methods are alignmentfree, and both attempt to improve speed and efficiency with little sacrifice of accuracy. Thus, our phylogeny results are directly compared to the k-mer method in this study. Phylogenies of the ClustalW method are included in the supplementary materials for reference ( Figure S1-S4) . Phylogenies of our method and the k-mer method are drawn using Matlab and MEGA 6 respectively (Tamura et al., 2013) . Computations in this research are implemented on a PC with configuration of Intel Core i7 CPU 2.40 GHz and 8 GB RAM.
