We recovered data form Hospital Demission Sheet, regarding the 2014-2018 period, of all patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis for breast cancer (diagnosis codes 174*, 19881 or 2330) and who underwent to the relative specific surgery (intervention codes 852*, 8533, 8534, 8535, 8536 or 854*). Overall, 8,509 Ligurian patients underwent to 9,078 surgeries in regional or extra-regional hospitals. Patients were mostly female (9 males and 8,500 females) and had a median age of 65 (IQR: 53-75; min 16; max 99). Distribution of Ligurian patients operated in Liguria per LHA of residence and years of intervention was analyzed. The higher number of surgery for breast cancer was detected in 2016 and from the following years the number ranged between 1,435-1,484. Breast Units were constituted in 2016 2 . The number of surgery per hospital characteristics in terms of Breast Units and caseload was evaluated and a progressive centralization of cases operated in Breast Units was observed; it was particularly evident in the last years (2017 and 2018). The percentage of surgery underwent in centers with caseload equal or higher than 135 per year increased constantly from 2014 to 2018 varying from 64% in 2014 to 92% in 2018. The centralization model resulted optimal outcomes reaching the goal of 100% for San Martino hospital and LHA 2, 99% for LHA 3 and LHA 5 and 95% for LHA 1 respectively in the period 2015 versus 2018. About San Martino hospital, the proportion of interventions for malignant breast cancer performed in wards with volume more than 135 interventions per year increased from 35.8% to 98%. Analyzing the differences of percentages of new resection operations breast cancer excision within 120 days from conservative surgery for breast carcinoma between 2017 versus 2018, San Martino hospital, LHA 1, LHA 3, and LHA 5 revealed good performance (data not shown). One of the main consequence of operating in a center with a low caseload is the high probability of a secondary intervention within 120 days 6 , therefore we evaluated the cases of re-intervention in regional centers; in the period 2014-2015 (before the Breast Unit institution) re-intervention rates was 5.12% while in 2017-2018 was 4.97%. Overall passive mobility (as percentage of surgery that took place in other regions/total number of surgery) varied from 18.0% in 2014, had a peak in 2015 with 21.3% and decreased to 17.6% in 2018. LHA5 had the higher passive mobility with an overall score of 33.5% and a peak in 2015 with 43.4%. In Apulia region, VC estimated from 16 birth cohorts included 657,978 individuals aged 7-22 years in 2018: 537,737 have received two doses of measles vaccine and 120,241 were still unvaccinated. From October 2018 to March 2019, at least two outbreaks have occurred in Apulia, counting 10 confirmed cases of measles in the age group studied. By assuming unvaccinated individuals (n = 7), as a control of measuring background infectivity, and 2-dose vaccinated individuals (n = 3), the VE was estimated to be about 90%. For the median of the Bayesian posterior distribution we obtained VE = 0.9013 close to the maximum likelihood estimator of 90.4% and as upper 95%-CI boundary VE = 0.977. The lower boundary was 0.659. In the period 2013-2017, a total of 854 (58.1% males) varicella cases were reported among children <  In Apulia, a total of 866 preterm infants out of 936 (92.5%) received the first dose of hexavalent vaccine and 57.6% were vaccinated by the 3rd month of age as recommended. Out of 866, 80.8% received the DTaP2-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine. We interviewed the parents of 339 preterm infants vaccinated with the DTaP2-IPV-HB-Hib vaccine, 97.8% of whom received co-administration with PCV13 and 72.5% also with anti-rotavirus. The most common local reactions were: pain ( Compared to the expected frequency of AEs in term-born infants, in our preterm population the injection site induration, nodule and the rash were more frequent, while loss of appetite, vomiting and persistent crying were less frequent. An individual with a serum PFOA concentration of 46 ng/mL reaches the reference level of 30 ng/mL after 1.8 years if he drinks water with PFOA 10 ng/mL and after 2.8 years if he drinks water with PFOA 40 ng/L. The PFOA concentrations measured in some private wells used for drinking water are in the order of magnitude of hundreds/thousands ng/L. As for raw food consumption, the reference PFOA serum level of 30 ng/mL is reached after about 1.8 and 3.3 years, when the corresponding food daily intake is 0.35 and 2.30 ng/kg-day ng/Kg body weight-day (lower and upper bound estimates of mean intake among adults, Italy 2005 Italy -2006 , In a high-exposure scenario the latter intake may be reached and exceeded. We included 11 studies in the final analysis, of which 9 were RCTs, 1 was a controlled trial and 1 a before and after study. Most studies were conducted in the US (81.9%). Six studies had data on the uptake of influenza vaccination, three on HPV series completion, 1 on PPSV23, and 1 on vaccines recommended for adolescents. In 4 studies email reminders proved to be more effective in increasing vaccination uptake than no reminders. In other four studies, email reminders were compared to reminders delivered via traditional methods (phone call, mail, paper card) and they all failed to prove the superiority of email reminders. On the other hand, four studies compared the effectiveness of email reminders with reminders delivered via other communication technologies, also failing to prove their superiority. In one study a significantly higher increase in uptake was achieved when combining emails with Interactive Voice Response phone calls. Finally, we included four studies that analyzed the content of the email. Fifty-two people completed the questionnaire, a response rate of 71%. They are mostly medical doctors (86 %) working in Universities (56%) or Prevention departments (21%) and directly involved in vaccinations (71%). The vast majority of respondents is in favor of the Italian mandatory vaccine Law (85%) and 65% believes that it should not be removed. Moreover, 83% or respondents is against the recent Government's proposal of introducing a "flexible" obligation. Among the alternative strategies to mandatory vaccinations, the favorite are vaccination promotion and information campaigns for the general population and organizational interventions to strengthen vaccination services. Nevertheless, 67% of respondents consider their implementation to be very difficult. Concerning the epidemiologic impact of mandatory vaccination, the majority or respondents agree that mandatory vaccination is able to increase vaccination coverage and reduce morbidity from vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. Concerning the social impact, the majority of respondents believes that mandatory vaccination encourages hesitant parents to vaccinate their children but exacerbate the quarrel with no vax movements. Finally, regarding the economic impact, the majority of respondents agree that mandatory vaccination will overall save health and social costs for the National Health System. EU SHIPSAN ACT and HEALTHY GATEWAYS results in regard to the maritime transport sector are illustrated: 1) literature review identified 196 ship-associated infectious diseases outbreaks with > 24,000 cases and 19 deaths ; 2) information system used by MS to follow-up 61 events (including gastroenteritis, legionellosis, varicella, measles, dengue, tuberculosis, meningitis, TBC) onboard 54 ships; 3) training provided (on-line, face-to-face, on-the-job) for hygiene standards and preparedness/response to public health events at ports, 4) a total of 347 hygiene inspections conducted according to the European Manual for Health and Hygiene Standards; 4) guidance developed (Ebola, Zika virus, plague) and guidelines for risk assessment of chemical/radiological events. Overall, 6499 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 72 years (IQR: 57-81), a male:female ratio = 0.99:1 and a median HAI onset time of 15 days (IQR: 7-29). 50.0% of the patient had a Non-fatal McCabe score; 31.2% had an ultimately-fatal, 17.1% had a rapidly-fatal and 2.7% had an Unknown score. HAI prevalence resulted 15.5% in 2014, 16.27% in 2015, 13.24% in 2016 (I),13.73% in 2016 (II), 14.12% in 2018 and 11.22% in 2019 with a decreasing trend (p < 0.01). Despise antibiotic therapy prevalence varied very little over the years, resulting 46.2% overall the study period, the prevalence of use of carbapenems (J01DH) and fluoroquinolones (J01MA) decerased while penicillins plus beta-lactamase inhibitors (J01CR) increased (p < 0.01). Overall, bloodstream and low-respiratory tract infections were the most frequent HAI with a prevalence of 22.4% and 19.3% respectively. Staphylococcus aureus (12.4%) Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.0%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.0%) were the most frequent microorganisms isolated in bloodstream infections. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, ultimately or rapid Mc-Cabe score, surgery, hospitalization in intensive care unit, central line catheter use and urinary catheter use were associated with a higher risk of developing an HAI (p < 0.01). Six economic evaluations (two cost-effectiveness analyses; two cost-utility analyses; two combined cost-effectiveness and cost utility analyses) were included. All studies were of good quality and adopted the perspective of the healthcare system/payer; accordingly, only direct medical costs were considered. Of particular concern were the use of not recommended genes (i.e. BRAF, PTEN, ERBB2) as predictive biomarkers for response to anti-EGFR therapy, the lack of consideration of NRAS mutation status and of key parameters related to genetic tests and biological agents. Two studies were funded by Roche, a leading provider of genetic tests, and the source of funding was not declared in one study. Four studies presented testing strategies with a favorable ICER under the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (£20,000-30,000/QALY) and the US ($50,000-100,000/ QALY) thresholds. We retrieved 55 papers reporting data for selenium (588 cases  HL mean score of 98 completed questionnaires (47 men, 51 women) was 13.0 (SD = 3.5), with no sex difference; prevalence of persons with inadequate HL was 11.2%, problematic 26.5%, sufficient 62.3%. Sufficient HL level presents the highest prevalence (72%) of high educational level. Smoking habit decreases as HL level increases. The web portal provides over one hundred webpages about different topics concerning vaccination. The visibility of the website is clear: it is on top position among organic Google search results when using the keyword "VaccinarSì". In 2019, about 70.000 visits per month have been registered and over 1000 locations accessed to the portal showing a satisfying geographical diffusion. The mean duration of each session on the website is 1 min 18 sec (quite shorter compared to the mean duration in 2013: 2 min 41 sec), mean pages visited for each session fell from 2.93 to 1.67 with a bounce rate over 80%. Amongst the users, 72% are women aged between 25 to 44 years and the website is mostly visited during work hours. Most of the accesses to the portal are performed directly to a specific webpage achieved by Google (52%) and only 3% of visitors access it through social media. We observed that intake of wholemeal bread, cereals, olive oil, eggs, fish, fruit, vegetables, legumes, soup, potatoes, fries, rice, pasta and pizza positively correlated with LINE-1 methylation. By contrast, butter and margarine, vegetable oil, dipping sauces, and coffee negatively correlated with LINE-1 methylation. Next, we demonstrated that adherence to the prudent dietary pattern -characterized by high intake of potatoes, cooked and raw vegetables, legumes, soup and fish -was positively associated with LI-NE-1 methylation. Particularly, women in the 3rd tertile exhibited higher LINE-1 methylation level than those in the 1st tertile (median = 66.7% 5mC; IQR = 4.67% 5mC vs median = 63.1% 5mC; IQR = 12.3% 5mC; p < 0.001). Linear regression confirmed that women in the 3 rd tertile had higher LINE-1 methylation that those in the 1st tertile (β = 1.765; SE = 0.728; p = 0.016), after adjusting for age, educational level, use of folic acid supplement and total energy intake. By contrast, no differences in LINE-1 methylation across tertiles of adherence to the western dietary pattern were evident. According to MDS (mean = 4.2; range = 0-8), we identified 33.8% of women with low adherence to MD (MDS ≤ 3), 56.8% with medium adherence (3 < MDS < 7), and 9.4% with high adherence (MDS ≥ 7). Among social characteristics, medium and high educational levels were associated with ideal intake of alcohol (OR = 4.059; 95%CI = 1.311-12.570; p = 0.015; OR = 4.258 95%CI = 1.068-16.976; p = 0.040; respectively), living in couple with ideal intake of cereals (OR = 2.801 95%CI = 1.188-6.602; p = 0.018), and having children with ideal intake of fruits (OR = 3.149; 95%CI = 1.245-7.762; p = 0.015). With respect to behaviors, no smoking was associated with ideal intake of meat (OR = 2.227 95%CI = 1.091-4.548; p = 0.028) and dairy products (OR = 2.205 95%CI = 1.110-4.379; p = 0.020), while high physical activity was associated with ideal intake of vegetables (OR = 6.148; 95%CI = 1.506-25.104; p = 0.011) and legumes (OR = 5.832; 95%CI = 1.414-24.063; p = 0.015). Particularly, moderately or highly physically active women were more likely to show medium or high adherence to MD than those who performed less physical activity (OR = 6.024 95%CI = 1.192-30.440 ; p = 0.040; OR = 9.965 95%CI = 1.683-58.993; p = 0.011; respectively). In 2018 a pilot survey using the HLS-EU-Q16 questionnaire was administered to 100 adults in Reggio Calabria during the Health Examination Survey of the CUORE Project. The questionnaire has now been extended to 47 specific questions about HL and 32 about lifestyles and demographic characteristics. Results will be analysed in order to define a strategy for the implementation of actions for the improvement of HL in the Italian population in the next National Prevention Plan. The national survey will be periodically scheduled and conducted to monitor results. Policies about HL will be implemented at individual, community, organization and system level. A national steering committee of experts is working for the support of all HL policy initiatives. After screening 3688 article, 21 systematic reviews were selected for full text review and were included for further overview. Only 7 reviews were high quality (AMSTAR class 4), 2 were moderate quality (AMSTAR class 3), 11 were low quality (AMSTAR class 2) and 1 was very low quality (AMSTAR class1). The students attended Medicine (  Preliminary results suggested that adsorption could be the main removal mechanism for BIT and MIT. After their addition to the ML, bacteria and protozoa populations decreased, but the sludge rapidly acclimatized as reported by respirometric test curves. According to R. subcapitata and A. fischeri, BIT was more toxic than MIT. Main results showed that hypersaline brine caused a general biodiversity loss, with a benthic fauna mainly dominated by the phyla Mollusca, Arthropoda and Anellida. Scarce differences in the toxicity of water samples were detected with A. fischeri and P. tricornutum assays. Nonetheless, negative effects tended to significantly increase near the hypersaline discharge, especially in sediment samples. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa; ATCC 9027) and  Unadjusted models showed that a higher number of life events is asso-  HS-SPME-GC/MS allowed to use smaller sample volumes compared to traditional methods with no sample processing and the potentiality for its application on various food matrices for the detection of a wide variety of pathogens. Data analysis showed the identification of unique VOCs' profiles being possible markers of meat contamination due to their association to specific pathogens. Among singleton live births we observed a three-fold increase in risk of very preterm birth between the extra-urban area and the remaining low inhabitants density and unindustrialized areas for births whose pregnancies were in the third trimester (OR adjusted for maternal age and infant gender = 3.41; 95%CI = 1.04-11.16). There was an excess of very low birth weight singleton infants in the study group as compared to the reference group, which was limited to births of mothers exposed during peri-conception period (OR adjusted for maternal age and infant gender = 4.64; 95%CI = 1.04-20.6) and first trimester (OR adjusted for maternal age and infant gender = 3.66; 95%CI = 1.11-12.1). The association estimates were imprecise due to the small number of outcomes recorded. The articles reviewed report highly heterogenous results with regards to epidemiological data, estimating a prevalence of the online grooming phenomenon between 9% and 19%. Factors influencing adolescents' risk of being solicited, victimized or abused online included increasing age, gender, sexual minority orientation, diagnosis of mental disease, conflictual relationships with parents and risk-taking behaviors (eg. chat room and social networking site use). Laboratory tests for a subsample of 394 subjects (subcohort, with 12 CVD events occurred in 5.6 years; 5.4:1,000 person-years) and 41 CVD events (case group) were available for this preliminary analysis. Three SNPs (NMU rs62310886, NMUR1 rs3769987 and rs6754952) and three NMU CpG sites (CpG 3 and CpG 4 of 32 region, CpG 8 of 76 region) showed a statistically significant association with CVD (p from < 0.0001 to 0.037), independently from CVD risk factors. A total of eight genetic and epigenetic biomarkers were associated with the events at p < 0.10 and were included in the score. The HR for 1 score SD was 5.84 (95% CI: 3.17-10.76). A HR of 4.01 (95% CI: 2.37-6.78) was found comparing the 3 rd vs the 1 st tertile of the score. Many of 73 diabetic patients had to evacuate their houses because of the damages and find another accommodation (hotels and camping along the coast). The 75% are males and the remaining 25% females, 11% of them are aged between 38 and 59, 58% are aged between 60 and 79 and 28% are aged between 80 and 92. Even if a significant statistical association with the paired Student's t-test (at p < 0.05) has not be showed for all parameters before and after earthquake, the 45% of patients had their therapy changed with an increase in the dose, the 44% had their therapy unvaried and the 11% had their therapy changed with a decrease of the dose. The participants were 223 subjects (57% females) aged between 23 and 68 years. After adjusting for all the potential confounders, there was a significant increase of 20.0 (95% CI 0.8; 39.2) meters in the distance walked for an increase in 10 g/day of vegetable proteins and non-significant variations of -1.8 (95% CI -9.3; 5.7) meters for an increase in 10 g/day of animal proteins and of 0.5 (95% CI -6.8; 7.7) for an increase of 10 g/day of total proteins. During 2018 the HC reached 804 new patients: 57% were homeless, immigrants, 2% were Italian poor elderly and 41% were gypsies from Bosnia, Serbia, Montenegro, Romania and Bulgaria, living in regular or irregular camps in Rome and province. The HC is integrated in a bigger community center offering social, legal, hygiene and food assistance, this being the reason for a high number of accesses and for reduced barriers to healthcare. The program takes place two days/a week and includes an innovative figure, the "health facilitator", from the UOSD, who is helping migrants and vulnerable people in accessing both public and charitable health services. During 2018, a total of 1,894 interventions were classified as health assistance activities. Most common health requests were generalist clinical visits (n. 989) 52%, and free of charge drug distribution (n. 673) 35,5%. The HC assisted some children and adult TB cases, supporting them for the management and the adherence to the treatment. Growth control and access to free formula milk was provided for 171 babies, mainly gypsies. Prescriptions for access to public health facilities especially for diabetic and cardiologic care (n. 86) was 4,5% of the total activities. A relevant action was performed in October-December in order to prevent influenza pandemic: in agreement with generalist associations, more than 300 HTR people resulted vaccinated in the HC. A total of 143 patients were included in our study. The 80% of the strains were isolated from blood (115 cases), 7% from CSF (10 cases) and a 13% from both (18 cases). The most common clinical pictures were of bacteremia and sepsis. There is a constant trend of infection over the years: 19 cases of IPD in 2012, 18 in 2013, a low number of cases in 2014 (8), while a constant increase over the last few years. Results showed an increase in the trend of invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) over the last years and a seasonality trend as the disease is most common in colder months. Elderly people are the most affected by the disease, with an increased mortality risk. The most common circulating serotypes in our hospitals were serotypes 3, 8 and 14. 76% of the patients were not vaccinated, and at least 43% of the diseases could have been prevented with vaccinations. Erythromycin, Azithromycin, Clarithromycin and Tetracycline showed the highest trends in resistances, while pneumococcal strains were always susceptible to Vancomycin, Imipenem, Meropenem and Teicoplanin. A total of 5,139 articles were retrieved, after duplicates elimination 3,944 papers were screened. After a screening selection, 337 studies we-re included in the analysis. Most studies were cross-sectional (92.9%), followed by case-control (4.8%) and cohort studies (2.4%). The population interviewed was mainly parents, without any further details (73.3%); mothers were the only parent surveyed in approximately 20% of the studies, while only 1 study involved selectively the fathers. The sample size ranged from 7 to 59,897. Only 38% of the included studies reported both the number and type of items used. Regarding the type, more than half consisted of closed questions, followed by Likert scales, while open-ended questions were used in 14.8% of the surveys. Frequently, the survey was conducted using a self-reported questionnaire or interview. The questionnaires were mostly administered on paper, while online forms were used in 13.7% of the cases. However, 79.8% of the questionnaires were not attached to the paper. HPV vaccine was the most frequently investigated (39.2%), followed by influenza (13.4%) and measles (10.7%). While 22.6% of the articles referred to paediatrics vaccinations in general. Data about the immunization behaviours were reported in 297 studies: the subjects involved showed a behaviour defined as "acceptance" in 130 studies (38.6%), as "hesitancy/scepticism/ doubt" in 145 studies (43%) and as "refusal" in 22 studies (6.5%). This information was not reported in 11.9% of the studies. We noticed heterogeneous implementation's status between Tuscan Health Care Departments. The most frequently reported barriers influencing the success of the implementation process of this prevention strategy included: lack of accountability, lack of enabling instruments, financial constraints, logistics barriers, training deficiencies, attitudes of health care workers and lack of workers specialised in communication. In the systematic review of part I we extracted data from 68 RCTs assessing the use of ICT to improve immunization uptake and associated outcomes. Results were analyzed by vaccine type, type of ICT and target population. The findings showed that to be more effective the interventions must be tailored to target populations' specific characteristics and needs. The review's outputs will be used to build and inform part II of the EUVIS project. Data are insofar available for the first sampling of each selected OR. To avoid the largest possible number of biases, each OR should be primarily compared to itself in different periods if differences in air quality are recorded. Raw data of the first samplings show differences between different ORs both in terms of HAI frequency and air quality as related to PM and airborne microorganisms. We first pointed out controversial results in the associations of typical MD food categories and QoL: some MD recommendations (e.g. less than 1 serving of red meat per day or drinking 1 glass of wine per day) exhibited a positive effect, while others (e.g. using olive oil as main culinary fat or consuming 3 or more fish servings per week) reduced the QoL. In line with these findings, no differences in QoL across categories of adherence to MD were evident. Evidence from observational studies sustained the debate on the effect of diet on QoL in breast cancer survivors. However, some experimental studies suggested the improvement of QoL -especially in terms of physical and mental functioning -in women who completed healthy diet interventions. At baseline, 73 participants had depression and among those without depression at baseline, 195 participants developed depression over four years of follow up (mean age 60.1 ± 8.0 years; and 49.0% women). Lower levels of PA and higher levels of ST were statistically significantly associated with prevalent depression, in particular during the weekend and in the morning hours (for PA). Only higher levels of ST in the evening and on weekend days were statistically significantly associated with incident depression. The rules of the Regulatory Agencies we studied (regarding the production of API/SI) can be divided into three types: 1. CM is permitted only where adequate technical/organisational measures are used as well as adequate cleaning measures that can guarantee the safety of the method: Health Canada, EMA, PIC/S, FDA; 2. CM is permitted for the production of certain classes of API/SI only in exceptional circumstances: CFDA, WHO, ANVISA. CFDA and WHO allow CM only for the production of "certain" API and in exceptional circumstances (without defining in the regulations which circumstances can be defined as exceptional). ANVISA allows the use of CM only in the case of serious emergencies (i.e.: war, fires, floods); 3. CM is not provided or mentioned: COFEPRIS, CDSCO. Sleep symptoms of reduced quantity or quality or lack of sleep satisfaction are associated with reduced vitality and energy or motivation, impaired work performance, cognitive functioning, emotional regulation, social participation and relationship with colleagues, friends and family. Among the 476 patients enrolled (aged 11-77 years; 63.2% men), we observed that 21.8% of kidney transplant patients died after a median follow-up of 10 years. Overall, we reported incidences of 9.7% for cardiovascular, 9.0% for metabolic, 4.4% for infectious, and 1.5% for cerebrovascular complications, respectively. Notably, the risk of death increased among patients with neoplasia (OR = 3.570; 95%CI :1.927-6.615; p < 0.001) and among those with cardiovascular (OR = 3.168; 95%CI: 1.688-5.948; p < 0.001) and infectious (OR = 2.842; 95%CI: 1.163-6.944; p = 0.017) postoperative complications. By contrast, other postoperative complications -specifically cerebrovascular and metabolic complications -did not increase the risk of death. Of the 7,730 papers initially retrieved, 14 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were mainly conducted in Australia (5), USA (4), Asia (3) and Europe (2) . The chronic conditions studied were cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (6), COPD (3), diabetes (DM) (3) or unspecified chronic conditions (2) . Studied separately in the disease groups, the studies were quite homogeneous in terms of type of intervention and follow-up duration, and only four studies carried out an evaluation post-intervention. Globally, 21 tools have been used to assess behavioral changes, the greatest part of which were disease-specific. The interventions were effective in the CVD group, partially effective in DM patients, and completely ineffective in COPD and multichronic patients. Almost all the studies showed a high risk of bias (only two RCTs were at low risk of bias).
