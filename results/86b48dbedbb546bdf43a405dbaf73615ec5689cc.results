During the experiments, the animals were observed at five different levels of Fio 2 (18%, 16%, 14%, 12%, and 10%) under two different conditions (circuit off or circuit on). A total of 132 measurements were obtained, 69 when the oxygenation circuit was off and 63 when the oxygenation circuit was on. Table 3 presents the observed and fitted mean Pao 2 values for all groups. For the saline solution group, with the circuit off and saline solution dwelling in the abdomen, as the Fio 2 was lowered from 18 to 10% the mean (Ϯ SD) Pao 2 decreased from 65.9 Ϯ 9.7 to 26.6 Ϯ 2.8 mm Hg, respectively. This provided fitted means of 66.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI], 61.0 to 72.5 mm Hg) to 22.7 mm Hg (95% CI, 17.0 to 28.3 mm Hg), respectively. After obtaining data for the animals at an Fio 2 of 10%, the oxygenation circuit was started. As the Fio 2 of the animals was raised from 10 to 18%, the mean Pao 2 increased from 28.6 Ϯ 3.9 to 60.5 Ϯ 11.6 mm Hg, respectively. This resulted in fitted mean values of 25.6 mm Hg (95% CI, 20.1 to 31.1 mm Hg) to 55.9 mm Hg (95% CI, 49.0 to 62.7 mm Hg), respectively. These results are depicted as fitted means in Figure 2 . Saline solution perfusion with the oxygenation circuit running was then compared to perfluorocarbon perfusion with the oxygenation circuit running (Fig 3) . The data from animals that had oxygenated saline solution perfusion were compared directly to those of animals that underwent perfusion with oxygenated perfluorocarbon. As the Fio 2 of the animals was raised from 10 to 18% with the circuit running with oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfused, the mean Pao 2 increased from 36. 7 (Fig 2) . The average increase in fitted mean Pao 2 with oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusion compared to oxygenated saline solution perfusion ranged from 8.1 to 18.2 mm Hg. These differences represent the treatment effect comparing oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusion to oxygenated saline solution perfusion. All five differ-ences are statistically significant. A common treatment effect can be estimated across all Fio 2 values, representing the average mean difference in oxygen uptake between perfluorocarbon and saline solution when the oxygenation circuit was running, irrespective of the level of Fio 2 (Table 4 ). This average was 12.8 mm Hg (95% CI, 7.4 to 18.2 mm Hg; p Ͻ 0.001). The above difference between perfluorocarbon and saline solution perfusion, when the oxygenation circuit was running, should be put in the context of the same difference when the oxygenation circuit was off and the perfusate was dwelling in the abdomen (Fig 4) . As mentioned above, when oxygenation was on, oxygen uptake was significantly higher in the perfluorocarbon group by 12.8 mm Hg on average (average difference of fitted mean Pao 2 values between perfluorocarbon and saline solution perfusion at all Fio 2 levels) [Fig 2] . When the oxygenation circuit was off and the perfusate was dwelling in the abdomen, oxygen uptake was also statistically significantly higher in the perfluorocarbon group than in the comparable saline solution group. The average mean difference in oxygen uptake between the perfluorocarbon and saline solution groups, when the oxygenation circuit was off and perfusate was dwelling in the abdomen, was 6.4 mm Hg (fitted mean 95% CI, 0.6 to 12.2 mm Hg; p ϭ 0.034). When comparing the quantitative effects of the oxygenation circuit (ie, off vs on) between the groups (perfluorocarbon vs saline solution group) a positive group-by-oxygenation interaction effect was noted to be 6.4 mm Hg (95% CI, Ϫ1.2 to 14.0; p ϭ 0.095). The most clinically relevant increase in Pao 2 came at an Fio 2 of 14% (Fig 2, 3) . The observed effect of perfluorocarbon compared to that of saline solution with the oxygenation circuit on demonstrated an observed mean increase of 15.9 mm Hg with a fitted mean increase of 13.2 mm Hg (95% CI, 7.8 to 18.6 mm Hg) [ Table 4 ]. This resulted in a baseline mean For the observed means, this corresponds to an increase in arterial oxygen saturation (Sao 2 ) from 73% with oxygenated saline solution perfusing the abdomen to 89% with oxygenated perfluorocarbon perfusing the abdomen.
