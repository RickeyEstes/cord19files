In total, 62 of 103 (60.19%) of tonsil squamous cell carcinomas and 7 of 20 (35%) of chronically inflamed tonsils tested positive for HBoV DNA by the RespiFinder Smart22 PCR (Figure 1A) . In 66 of 103 (66%) tonsil tumors, but in none (0%) of the 20 chronically inflamed tonsils HPV DNA could be identified ( Figure 1B) . In 40 of 103 (38.8%) tonsil tumors there was a coinfection of HPV and HBoV. In 26 of 103 (25.2%) we could register a single HPV infection and in 19 of 103 (18.4%) a single HBoV infection ( Figure 1C ). All samples were negative for the other 21 airway pathogens tested by the RespiFinder assay. To ascertain whether HPV and HBoV DNA are present in the same cells of the tumor tissue an HBoV specific FISH assay was applied (Figure 2) . The HPV type 16 FISH assay established for routine diagnostic was in agreement with the results of the HPV PCR, too. In 24 of 40 co-infected tumor sections (60%) the fluorescent signals of HPV 16 and HBoV DNA could be detected in the same cells, implying that the two viruses infected the same host cell. In contrast we found virus persistence in different cells in 13 of 40 co-infected tumor samples (32.5%) which means that FITC signals (indicating HPV DNA) and rhodamine red signals (indicating HBoV 1 DNA) were spread as distinct separated signals all over the tumor sections. In 3 of 40 tumors (7.5%) we could observe a heterogeneous image with double infected cells and single infections in the same section. In 22 cases (35.4%) of all HBoV positive samples (single and co-infections) the presence of human bocavirus DNA could be determined. In accordance with the PCR based analyses HPV DNA was not detected in the chronic tonsillitis tissue sections. The signals were not always located in the nucleus, but appeared to be in the cytoplasm, as indicated by merging the different color channels. Moreover, multiple signals per cell were registered, indicating that multiple copies of HBoV DNA are present in the cells due to replication or, as a matter of speculation, due to persisting episomes. Furthermore we found a correlation between the presence of human bocavirus and the tonsil tumor stage. We noticed higher bocavirus prevalence in tumor sections with progressed tumor stages. By using the one-tailed t-test for two dependent means a trend for the increase in the number of HBoV-positives in higher tumor stages was observed (value of p = 0.09051 at p ≤ 0.10 in the HBoV positive group vs. p = 0.114027 at p ≤ 0.10 in the HBoV negative group) ( Table 1A) , whereas there was no higher HPV prevalence in higher tumor stages (Table 1B) . In addition, we analyzed 21 out of the 62 HBoV positive tumors (single HBoV infected and HPV coinfected) for MSI ( Table 2) , because only for these tumors a tumor-free control tissue was available to compare the microsatellite status of tumor and otherwise healthy tissue. Of those, only four tonsils displayed microsatellite instabilities in at least 1 of 10 microsatellite markers, as exemplarily shown in Figure 3 . Because it was postulated that HBoV is likely persisting in tonsillar tissue and that this kind of tissue is assumed to be the major replication site in vivo, we performed a series of cell culture experiments with primary tonsil cells, directly obtained after tonsillectomy. Routinely resected, chronic infected tonsils were brought to the laboratory immediately after surgery and fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and lymphocytes were prepared. To evaluate the most appropriate coating keratinocytes were cultured on laminin, fibronectin, and collagen coated plates and it turned out that collagen is the most effective coating for tonsillar keratinocytes. Nevertheless cultivating of tonsil keratinocytes was successful in solely 2 of 11 patients. These cells were infected with an HBoV inoculum with MOI 1 referred to Geq in triplicate and the amount of virus genome was determined kinetically up to day 12. Regarding the cell morphology of the isolated keratinocytes and fibroblasts, which is exemplarily shown in Figure 4 , no difference between infected and non-infected cells could be observed (not shown). In one infected well of one patient we observed a virus replication after 3 days in accordance with the typical virus growth curve ( Figure 5) . However, in the remaining three HBoV infected cultures of the other patient there was no virus replication measurable. Virus replication in fibroblasts and lymphocytes was not detectable, indicating that this cell types are not permissive for HBoV.
