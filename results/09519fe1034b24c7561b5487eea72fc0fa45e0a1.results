In this study, we did not observe cases of morbidity or mortality or signs that could be associated with the presence of N. caninum in these species during the experimental period. There was a significant (p < 0.05) difference in weight gain between the control group and the two infected groups from the end of the 3rd week of infection. The final average difference between the groups was over 30 g (Fig. 1) . The relative mean value of the weight of the infected quails' spleens was higher than that of the control group (p < 0.05) on the 3rd, 7th and 14th DAI, whereas a significant difference (p < 0.05) in liver weight was observed only on the 3rd DAI. The presence of N. caninum antibodies in the quails was observed beginning on the 7th DAI, and the titration peak occurred on the 14th DAI. After the 30th DAI, no quails were found to be positive for N. caninum. The dogs remain seronegative by N. caninum throughout the study. The bursa de Fabricius, brain, spleen, liver and lungs were the principal organs that tested positive for IHC and PCR, and they were the most positive during the first two weeks of infection. The histopathology was inconsistent, with the exception of the livers of three infected quails on the 3rd DAI (2 quails) and one on the 7th DAI (1 quail) in which we observed a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate associated with immunoreactivity by IHC (Fig. 2) . No oocysts were found in the dog stools examined during the experimental period. We also did not observe any amplification of parasite DNA using the dog stool samples.
