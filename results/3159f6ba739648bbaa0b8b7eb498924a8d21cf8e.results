Induction of pancreatitis, hepatitis or generalized inflammation robustly downregulated IFNAR1 in mice. This downregulation was not seen in the knock-in mice incapable of stimulating IFNAR1 ubiquitination. Importantly, these mice were highly susceptible to acute and chronic pancreatitis, toxic and autoimmune hepatitis and bacterial endotoxin-induced septic shock. Altered balance of pro-inflammatory/ anti-inflammatory cytokines and specific chemokines resulting in the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes was observed in pancreatic tissues of IFNAR1 ubiquitination-deficient mice. These mice displayed extensive damage and persistent immune infiltration of inflamed tissues, and, in the case of generalized inflammation, overwhelming mortality. Under conditions of chronic pancreatitis, these mice also exhibited a dramatically impaired ability to repair the pancreatic tissue and restore its anatomical and functional integrity. Experiments using bone marrow transplantation determined that inability to ubiquitinate and degrade IFNAR1 in hematopoietic compartment is responsible for excessive pancreatic and hepatic inflammatory phenotypes. Importantly, pharmacologic stimulation of protein kinases that stimulate IFNAR1 ubiquitination was protective against from toxic hepatitis and fulminant generalized inflammation in wild type but not in IFNAR1 ubiquitination-deficient mice.
