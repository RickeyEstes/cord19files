Tylophorine-based compounds interacted with TGEV viral RNA/RNP and inhibited TGEV RNA replication. Tylophorine compounds exert potent anti-coronavirus activities 11, 12 , but the mechanism of action remains unknown. Previously, we reported that tylophorine-based compounds exert anti-cancer activity predominantly by targeting the RNP complex containing caprin-1 protein/c-Myc mRNA in carcinoma cells 18 . Accordingly, we investigated whether the observed anti-TGEV activity arises from the targeting of viral RNP. First, we demonstrated that biotinylated tylophorine, not Biotin-X-SSE (see Fig. 1A -a for chemical structures), interacted with purified TGEV viral RNAs in a pull-down experiment using streptavidin beads (see materials and methods) ( Fig. 1A-b ). This interaction of biotinylated tylophorine and TGEV viral RNA was enhanced by addition of recombinant TGEV N protein, but not RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1A-c) . Moreover, a cellular colocalization of TGEV viral nascent RNA, N protein and fluorescent tylophorine compound surrounding the nuclei in TGEV infected cells was also observed (Figs S1 and S2). Secondly, through RT-qPCR, we also demonstrated tylophorine based compounds (Fig. 1B) profoundly inhibited TGEV viral replication by diminishing viral RNA copies by up to ~4 orders of magnitude (Fig. 1C) . Thirdly, using 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) labelled newly synthesized RNA, we clearly demonstrated that tylophorine compounds, either tylophorine or DBQ 33b, inhibited the nascent viral RNA synthesis and thus blocked the colocalization of viral nascent RNA with either N protein ( Fig. 1D-a) or RdRP ( Fig. 1D-b) around nuclei.
