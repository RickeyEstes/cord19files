The genotypic and allelic frequencies of healthy controls as well as the groups of patients divided in the clinical forms of ATL are shown in Table 1 . Both populations were found under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium for this locus. Analyses using the genotypic and allelic frequencies when comparing patients and controls demonstrated no association with susceptibility or protection to ATL per se (p = 0.59 for genotypes and p = 0.4735 for alleles). In the same way, no associations with the severe mucosal form were found when compared to CL cases (p = 0.561). Despite the lower frequency of TT genotype among ATL in comparison to AA or TA patients, no statistical difference was observed in comparison to controls or among the patient population. Indeed the low frequency of TT genotype is comparable to the one already expected in the general population (control individuals). The analysis of IFN-γ production upon Leishmania antigens stimulation showed, as expected, that differences in the IFN-γ secretion between CL and ML were very significant (p < 0.001). In order to evaluate the functional influence of SNP +874 in the production of IFN-γ (mean ± SD) observed in these clinical forms of ATL, a comparison of leishmanial induced cytokine levels produced in each genotype was carried-out ( Figure 1 ). In ML patients, similar levels of IFN-γ were produced independently of the IFNG +874 genotype (p = 0.09): AA = 9,504 ± 7,858 pg/ mL (median = 11,740 pg/mL; n = 11), TA = 9,522 ± 8,995 pg/mL (median = 5,582 pg/mL; n = 11) and TT = 2,406 ± 2,883 pg/mL (median = 1,884 pg/mL, n = 5). In addition, ML patients can be clearly (p < 0.0001) separated into two groups according to the levels of IFN-γ production: high (>10.000 pg/ml; 15,700 ± 5,866 pg/ml, n = 12) and low (<10.000 pg/ml; 2,191 ± 2,192 pg/ml, n = 15). This profile of IFN-γ producers was observed indistinctively among AA and TA genotypes. On the other hand, CL patients presented significant differences when IFN-γ production was compared among patients from the three IFNG +874 genotypes (p = 0.01). The detectable IFN-γ values were lower for +874AA individuals (844 ± 1,099 pg/ mL, median = 244 pg/mL, n = 10); moderate for +874TA (2,700 ± 1,818 pg/mL, median = 2,556 pg/mL, n = 08) and high in +874TT (4,162 ± 1,678 pg/mL, n = 2). Pos-test indicates that significant differences were observed between +874AA and +874TA (p < 0.05). In 11 CL and 2 ML the IFN-γ values were under the minimum detectable levels.
