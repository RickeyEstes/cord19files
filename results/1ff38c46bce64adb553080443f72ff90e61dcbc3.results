We employed nine SHIV-infected rhesus macaques, of which six animals were vaccinated by i.m. injection with a single dose of VSVDG/ZEBOVGP (Subjects #1-6) and the remaining three animals (Controls #1-3) received sterile saline. The animals were monitored closely for clinical symptoms and shedding of recombinant VSVs. None of the animals vaccinated with VSVDG/ZEBOVGP or treated with saline showed overt fever or any evidence of clinical illness during the 31 day vaccination period. Importantly, no evidence of reaction at the vaccine injection site was noted among any of the VSVDG/ZEBOVGPvaccinated animals nor was any change noted in activity or behavior during the vaccination phase of the study (day 0 to day 31 after vaccination). In addition, no changes were detected in hematology or clinical chemistry following vaccination. A mild VSVDG/ZEBOVGP viremia (,10 3 pfu/ml) was detected only on day 2 after vaccination by virus isolation (Figure 1 ) and RT-PCR (data not shown) in four of the six VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-immunized macaques (Subjects #1, 2, 3, 4) . Surprisingly, the two animals with the lowest CD4+ counts (subjects #5, 6) never showed any detectable level of VSV viremia. VSVDG/ZEBOVGP was undetectable in all analyzed swab samples (data not shown). Thus, vaccination led to a transient viremia from virus replication at as yet undetermined sites but no virus shedding of the vaccine virus. Following successful completion of the safety portion of the study all six of the VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated SHIVinfected monkeys and two of the three placebo control SHIVinfected monkeys were challenged 31 days after the single immunization by i.m. injection with 1000 pfu of ZEBOV (strain Kikwit). Four of the six VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated SHIVinfected monkeys and both of the placebo control animals started to show clinical signs of disease on day 6 after challenge including fever (Subject # 1, 2 and Control #1, 2) and lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia (Subject #2, 5, 6 and Control #1, 2) ( Table 3) . Disease progressed in two of the VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated SHIV-infected monkeys (Subject #5 and 6) and both of the placebo control animals with the development of additional evidence of clinical illness including increased levels of serum enzymes associated with liver function, depression, anorexia, and the appearance of macular rashes (Table 3 ). All four of these animals succumbed to the ZEBOV challenge with the two VSVDG/ ZEBOVGP-vaccinated monkeys expiring on days 9 (Subject #6) and 13 (Subject #5) and the placebo controls succumbing on days 9 (Control #1) and 10 (Control #2) after ZEBOV challenge (Figure 2 ). Disease did not progress in the two VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated SHIV-infected monkeys that were febrile (Subjects #1, 2) and had changes in hematology values on day 6 (Subjects #2) and both of these animals remained healthy and survived the ZEBOV challenge ( Figure 2 ). The remaining VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated macaques (Subject #3, 4) never showed any evidence of clinical illness and survived ( Figure 2) . Interestingly, the VSVDG/ZEBOVGPvaccinated macaques that succumbed were the two animals with the most significant reduction in CD4+ T cells (84%, 96%) (Table 1) , the lowest total CD4+ T cell counts (83, 42) (Table 1) , the highest SHIV viremia (Table 2) , and no evidence for VSV viremia (Figure 1) suggesting that CD4+ T cells may play a role in protection. Blood samples were analyzed after challenge for evidence of ZEBOV replication by plaque assay and RT-PCR. By day 6, both of the placebo control animals developed high ZEBOV titers in plasma as detected by plaque assay (.10 4.5 log pfu/ml) ( Table 4 ). In comparison, only one of the VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated monkeys (Subject #6) showed a ZEBOV viremia at day 6 by plaque assay (,10 2 log pfu/ml) ( Table 4 ). ZEBOV was detected in a second VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated monkey (Subject #5) by day 10 (,10 4.2 log pfu/ml). RT-PCR was more sensitive and showed evidence of ZEBOV in plasma of this animal (Subject #5) at day 6. In addition, RT-PCR was more sensitive in detecting ZEBOV in swabs which were positive on a number of samples derived from Subject #5 at day 6 and day 10 ( Table 4 ). In contrast, no ZEBOV was detected in the plasma by virus isolation or RT-PCR in the four VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated monkeys that survived ZEBOV challenge. Moreover, no evidence for reactivation of VSVDG/ ZEBOVGP was detected from any blood or swab sample from any animal after ZEBOV challenge (data not shown). Although we failed to detect ZEBOV viremia in the two surviving animals that were clinically ill (Subject #1 and 2) at days 3, 6, 10, and 14 after ZEBOV challenge we cannot exclude the possibility that these animals had low levels of circulating ZEBOV at time points not evaluated. The four surviving VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated macaques (Subjects #1, 2, 3, 4) were euthanized 28 days after the ZEBOV challenge to perform a virological and pathological examination of tissues. Organ infectivity titration from these four animals showed no evidence of ZEBOV in any of the tissues examined. In comparison, ZEBOV was recovered from tissues of both VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated animals that succumbed (Subject #5, 6) and both SHIV-infected control animals. Organ titers of infectious ZEBOV were consistent with values previously reported for immunocompetent ZEBOV-infected rhesus macaques [27, 28] . VSVDG/ZEBOVGP was not recovered in any of the tissues examined from any animal on this study. Pathological and immunohistochemical evaluation of tissues from the four VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated animals (Subjects #1, 2, 3, 4) that survived ZEBOV challenge showed no evidence of ZEBOV antigen. In contrast, ZEBOV antigen was readily detected in typical target organs (e.g., liver, spleen, adrenal gland, lymph nodes) of the two VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated animals that succumbed to ZEBOV challenge (Subject #5, 6) ( Figure 3 ) and the two placebo controls. Lesions and distribution of ZEBOV antigen in these macaques was consistent with results reported in other studies [27, 29] . While cellular immune responses against ZEBOV GP in macaques vaccinated with VSVDG/ZEBOVGP vectors have been difficult to detect before challenge in previous studies [7] , humoral immune responses have been more robust and consistent ( [7] ; TW Geisbert, unpublished observations). Therefore, we measured the antibody responses of the rhesus macaques vaccinated with VSVDG/ZEBOVGP before vaccination (day 27), after vaccination (day 14 and day 31), and after ZEBOV challenge (day 46 and day 59 after vaccination) by IgG ELISA. None of the six VSVDG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated macaques developed IgG antibody titers against the ZEBOV GP by the day of ZEBOV challenge ( Figure 4 ). Two animals (Subjects #1, 2) developed modest IgG antibody titers against ZEBOV by day 15 after ZEBOV challenge (day 46 after vaccination) while a third animal developed a titer by day 28 after ZEBOV challenge (day 59 after vaccination) (Figure 4 ).
