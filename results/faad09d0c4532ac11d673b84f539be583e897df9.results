We implemented a generic metapopulation model with arbitrary spatial resolution (see Methods) varying from approximately 1km 2 (300 by 300, the smallest unit representation) upwards (Fig. S1 ). We generated a theoretical population density in a region with total population just over 4 million and of size approximately 49km 2 (49649 pixels). The region had three 'urban' areas where population density was generated using a 2-dimensional bivariate Gaussian and a 'rural' area, generated from a uniform distribution, Fig. 1G . We used this formulation to simulate the spread of a pathogen representative of influenza, with an SIR-like natural history, assuming that the generation time was 2.6 days and the basic reproductive number R 0 was 1.8. The epidemic was seeded with 10 individuals in a central region (Fig. 1G ), simulations were repeated 25 times at each resolution. The within-pixel contact rate was fixed for all pixels. Mobility between pixels was represented by a kernel with an offset power function. A kernel defines the relative probability of travelling between two pixels. The offset power function is an adaptation of the gravity model. The gravity model states that an individual's probability of mixing in a pixel different to their home pixel is inversely proportional to the distance apart of the pixels, to some power. The offset power function adds in an offset distance parameter, which means that pixels closer together than this distance mix fully. See Methods for a full definition of the kernel and the resulting mobility model. Initially we considered three different kernels: we used an offset of 2 km and three different powers giving low, medium and high contact between pixels (the power, c, was 26, 24 and 22 respectively), Fig. S2 . The highest mobility kernel is in line with kernels fitted to commuter data in the UK and US [9] . However, our review of data on travel patterns found that only 15% of an average individual's journeys are commuting, making up just 19% of the total distance an average individual travels each year [22] ( Table S1 ). Commuting data also excludes key at-risk groups -the under 17 s and over 70 s -who have lower mobility travel patterns compared to the 18-69 population [22] . Therefore, we explored more restrictive kernels than those estimated using commuting data to reflect shorter distances travelled and lower frequency travel in the most at-risk populations and the regular non-commuting travel of the wider population. We confirmed that the overall cumulative attack rate (CAR) for our model was independent of the mobility kernel and the model resolution ( Fig. 1A-F) . This was by design: the model was constructed such that with the assumption of mass action mobility (the rate of contact between two groups is proportional to the size of each of the groups) the epidemic was identical at every resolution. This means that the next generation matrix at any resolution and for any mobility has the same spectral radius: R 0 was the same at all resolutions and contact levels and the local and global R 0 s were the same. A full proof that R 0 was constant with respect to resolution is given in the Text S1 in Supporting Information S1, and is similar to that in Ref [23] . Because R 0 was constant, if the mobility was such that there was contact between every pair of pixels, the final epidemic size was the same across all resolutions and in every pixel. If mobility was restrictive enough that some pixels were never infected the final CAR reflected this restriction. The full proof that attack rates were constant with respect to resolution is in the Text S2 in Supporting Information S1, and is similar to those in Refs [24, 25] . For the theoretical population density, the existence of a fundamental spatial resolution was apparent: at resolutions lower than this threshold, system-wide peak incidence was substantially over-estimated, obtaining a high peak incidence and fast spread similar to that obtained in a fully mixed model (the lowest resolution). However, at the fundamental resolution and above, consistent estimates of the peak attack rate were obtained (Fig. 1H) . This was increasingly evident as mobility became more and more restricted: for the most localised mobility assumptions (low power), peak incidence in the fully mixed case was nearly double that at the highest resolution. At high resolutions, multiple small pixels containing low numbers of individuals and with a high heterogeneity in population size slowed the epidemic spread; resulting in a long epidemic duration and a low peak incidence compared to low resolution model scenarios. Increased mobility reduced the effect of resolution on the epidemic trajectory. At medium mobility, peak incidence increased with decreasing resolution but there was no distinct Table 1 .
