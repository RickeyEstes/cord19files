After normal cells were treated with Jinchai, the fluorescence intensity ratio was (2.26Â±0.11). There was no significant difference when compared with control group (P>0.05, see Figure 1 ). The expression of HA mRNA increased significantly in the control group, while expressions decreased in Jinchai-treated groups. There were significant differences between the Jinchai-treated groups at both concentrations (1 and 2 mg/mL) and the control group (P<0.01), and inhibition rates of the two Jinchai-treated groups were 99.92% and 99.93% , respectively.
