Introduction of single amino acid substitutions into the IBV genome and analysis of their effect on the replication and infectivity of IBV Multiple alignment of the nsp9 sequences from IBV (accession No. NP-040829) and SARS-CoV (accession No. AY291315) shows that the two proteins share 70% similarity at the amino acid level (Fig. 1a) . were obtained from GenBank. The identical amino acid residues in all eight coronavirus species are marked in red, the residues for which conservation is above 70% are marked in blue and above 60% are marked in yellow. The amino acid residues chosen for mutational analysis in this study are boxed. (b) Diagram showing the mutations introduced into the IBV nsp9 protein. Also shown is the summary of virus recovery from wild type and mutant transcripts. Systematic mutagenesis of the IBV nsp9 protein was carried out to identify amino acid residues critical for the dimerization and the RNAbinding activity of the protein . The effect of these mutations on the  infectivity and replication of IBV was studied by using an infectious  IBV cloning system.  Nine point mutations, K10A, Y31A, K51A, Y87A, K90A, I95A, I95N , G98A and G98D (Fig. 1a) , were made and introduced separately into the infectious IBV clone. The in vitro transcribed full-length RNA derived from wild type and the mutant constructs were generated by in vitro transcription using the T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of a cap analog. Electroporation of wild type RNA transcripts together with an RNA fragment covering the N protein region into Vero cells showed the formation of massive cytopathic effect (CPE) at 2 days postelectroporation ( Fig. 1b and data not shown) . Similarly, typical CPEs were observed in cells transfected with mutant transcripts derived from K10A, Y31A, K51A, K90A, I95A, and G98A constructs at 2 days post-electroporation and recombinant viruses were recovered (Fig.  1b) . In cells electroporated with the I95N transcripts, a typical CPE was observed at 3 days post-electroporation (Fig. 1b) . Re-infection of fresh Vero cells with medium collected from total cell lysates prepared by freezing and thawing cells transfected with these mutant transcripts showed the formation of typical CPE, indicating that the mutant viruses rescued from the initially transfected cells maintain infectivity in subsequent passages. In contrast, no CPE formation was observed in cells transfected with transcripts derived from Y87A and G98D mutant constructs up to 5 days post-electroporation in four repeated experiments (Fig. 1b) . Subsequent infection of fresh cells with cell lysate preparations by freezing and thawing the initially transfected cells showed no sign of IBV infection, as judged by CPE formation and Western blot analysis (data not shown), suggesting that no infectious virus could be rescued from these mutant transcripts. These results indicate that Y87A and G98D mutations may abolish the infectivity of the in vitro synthesized full-length IBV transcripts. As the C-terminal domain may play an essential role in dimerization of nsp9 protein and dimerization was thought to be critical for its RNA binding activity, the effects of mutations in the C-terminal region were firstly characterized in the following studies. Characterization of the phenotypic and growth properties of the rescued I95A, I95N and G98A mutant viruses, and analysis of negative-strand RNA replication and subgenomic RNA transcription in cells transfected with G98D mutant transcripts The growth properties of I95A, I95N and G98A mutant viruses on Vero cells were tested by analysis of plaque sizes and growth curves of the passage 3 mutant viruses. As shown in Fig. 2a , very similarly sized plaques were observed in cells infected with wild type (rIBV) and the mutant viruses. Analysis of the growth curves of wild type and mutant viruses demonstrated that the I95A and G98A mutant viruses exhibited similar growth kinetics as wild type virus, reaching the peak at 16 h post-infection ( Fig. 2a) . At this time point, the titers of the two mutant viruses were approximately 2-3 fold lower than that of wild type virus (Fig. 2a) . The I95N mutant virus grew more slowly than wild type virus, reaching the peak at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 2a) . The titer of this mutant virus was approximately 100 fold lower than that of wild type virus (Fig. 2a) . As no infectious virus was recovered from cells transfected with G98D mutant transcripts, total RNA was extracted from cells electroporated with wild type and mutant full-length transcripts, and RT-PCR amplification of negative strand RNA was performed to check if RNA replication occurred in these transfected cells. The primer pair was chosen so that the IBV sequence from nucleotides 14,931 to 15,600 would be amplified by the RT-PCR reaction. If replication of viral RNA occurred, a 670 bp PCR fragment would be expected. As shown in Fig.  2b , RT-PCR fragments amplified from both positive (lanes 2 and 5) and negative (lanes 3 and 6) strand RNA templates were obtained from cells transfected with wild type and the mutant transcripts. The amount of negative strand RNA was approximately one third of the positive strand RNA (Fig. 2b) . RT-PCR amplification of subgenomic mRNAs was then carried out to check whether a low level of subgenomic mRNA transcription occurred in cells transfected with the mutant transcripts. The forward primer used in this reaction corresponds to the leader sequence from nucleotides 26-46 in the genomic RNA and the downstream primers covers IBV sequences from nucleotides 24,784 to 24,803. If transcription of subgenomic mRNAs did occur, a 415 bp PCR product corresponding to the 5′-terminal region of the subgenomic Fig. 2 . Analysis of the growth properties of wild type, and I95A, I95N and G98A mutant viruses. (a) Plague sizes (upper panels) and growth curves (lower panel) of wild type and I95A, I95N and G98A mutant viruses. Monolayers of Vero cells on a 6-well plate were infected with 100 μl of 1000-fold diluted virus stock and cultured in the presence of 0.5% carboxymethy cellulose at 37°C for 3 days. The cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% toluidine. Vero cells were infected with wild type and mutant viruses, and harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 30 and 36 h post-inoculation, respectively. Viral stocks were prepared by freezing/thawing of the cells three times and TCID50 of each viral stock was determined by infecting five wells of Vero cells on 96-well plates in triplicate with 10-fold serial dilution of each viral stock. (b) Analysis of RNA replication in cells electroporated with wild type and G98D mutant transcripts. Total RNA was prepared from Vero cells electroporated with in vitro synthesized full-length transcripts three days post-electroporation. Regions corresponding to nucleotides 14,931-15,600 of the positive (+) and negative (−) sense IBV genomic RNA were amplified by RT-PCR and analyzed on 1.2% agarose gel (lanes 2-3 and 5-6). The negative sense, subgenomic mRNA 4 was also amplified and analyzed (lanes 4 and 7). Lane 1 shows DNA markers. Numbers on the left indicate nucleotides in bases. mRNA4 and a 1010 bp fragment corresponding to the 5′-terminal region of the subgenomic mRNA3 would be expected. As shown in Fig.  2b , a dominant 415 bp band and a weak 1010 bp band were observed in cells electroporated with wild type full-length transcripts at two days post-electroporation (lane 4). However, the same PCR products were not detected in cells electroporated with the mutant transcripts at 72 h post-electroporation (Fig. 2b, lane 7) . Destabilization of the IBV nsp9 homodimer by introducing point mutations into the C-terminal region correlating with the defect of I95N and G98D mutant constructs in viral RNA replication and infectivity Biochemical analysis of the effect of I95A, I95N, G98A and G98D mutations on the dimerization and RNA-binding activity of the IBV nsp9 was then carried out to understand the detailed mechanisms of these point mutations on the replication and infectivity of IBV. For this purpose, wild type and mutant fragments with a 6-His tag at their N-terminus were cloned into a bacterial expression vector, expressed in E. coli and purified to near homogeneity. After removing the 6-His tag, the purified proteins were treated with 0-2% of glutaraldehyde, a short self-polymerizing reagent that reacts with lysine, tyrosine, histidine and tryptophan residues, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gradually increased detection of the homodimer was observed following cross-linking of wild type and mutant proteins with increasing concentrations of the cross-linking agent (Fig. 3a) . Interestingly, it was noted that G98D mutant protein showed much less, if any, dimer formation without cross-linking with glutaraldehyde (Fig. 3a) . The I95N mutant protein also showed significantly reduced dimer formation under the same conditions (Fig. 3a) . These results suggest that the I95N and G98D mutations may destabilize the IBV nsp9 homodimer. This possibility was further studied in the following two ways. First, the purified wild type and mutant proteins were analyzed by gel filtration after removing the 6-His tag. The results showed the detection of two peaks for wild type and the I95N mutant (Fig. 3b) . Analysis of the two peaks by mass spectrometry confirmed that they indeed represent the nsp9 monomers and dimers, respectively. However, only one peak was observed for the G98D mutant protein (Fig. 3b ). Once again, analysis by mass spectrometry confirmed that it represents the nsp9 monomers containing the right point mutation. Second, wild type, I95N and G98D mutant nsp9 were cloned into a mammalian expression vector with either a Flag or a Myc tag at the N-terminus. The Flag-tagged wild type nsp9 were coexpressed with the Myc-tagged wild type nsp9, I95N and G98D mutants, respectively. The association of wild type nsp9 protein with either wild type or mutant nsp9 proteins was analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation experiment with anti-Flag antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with either anti-Flag or anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 3c , Western blot analysis of total cell lysates showed the detection of similar amounts of wild type and mutant nsp9 proteins either expressed on their own or co-expressed with the Flag-tagged wild type nsp9 (Fig. 3c, top panel) . Analysis of the precipitates with anti-Flag antibody showed the presence of approximately equal amounts of the Flag-tagged wild type nsp9 either expressed on its own or co-expressed with the Myc-tagged wild type and mutant nsp9 (Fig. 3c, middle panel) . Analysis of the same precipitates with anti-Myc antibody showed that efficient G98A and G98D mutant IBV nsp9 protein after chemical cross-linking. The purified wild type and mutant nsp9 proteins were treated with 0-2% of glutaraldehyde, and analyzed by SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel. The monomeric (m) and dimeric (d) forms of the protein are indicated. Numbers on the left indicate molecular masses in kiloDalton. (b) Analysis of wild type and I95N and G98D mutant nsp9 proteins by gel-filtration. The purified wild type and mutant nsp9 proteins were analyzed by gel filtration assay using BioSuiteTM 250 HR SEC column (7.8 × 300 mm, Waters) on Shimadszu chromatograph (LC-10ATvp) equipped with a photodiode array detector (SPD-M20A). The column was equilibrated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with PBS buffer at room temperature. The protein samples (300 μl) were injected at a given concentration and detected. The first peak was formed by the nsp9 dimer (∼24 kDa), and the second peak indicated the monomer (∼12 kDa). (c) Analysis of the dimerization of wild type and I95N and G98D mutant proteins by co-immunoprecipitation. HeLa cells overexpressing the Flag-tagged wild type, Myc-tagged wild type and mutant nsp9 protein either on their own (lanes 1-4) or in different combination (lanes 5-7) were lysed, separated on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody (top panels). The same lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody, separated on SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by Western blotting with either anti-Flag (middle panel) or anti-Myc (bottom panel) antibodies. detection of the Myc-tagged wild type nsp9 was made only when it was co-expressed with the Flag-tagged nsp9 protein (Fig. 3c , bottom panel, lane 5). Interestingly, much reduced detection of the Myctagged I95N was observed when it was co-expressed with the Flagtagged wild type nsp9 (Fig. 3c , bottom panel, lane 6), demonstrating that this point mutation destabilizes the nsp9 homodimer. When the Myc-tagged G98D construct was co-expressed with the Flag-tagged wild type nsp9, the mutant protein was not detected in the coimmunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 3c, bottom panel, lane 7) . Taken together, these results confirm that the G98D mutation totally abolishes the nsp9 homodimer formation. Analysis of the effect of point mutations in the C-terminal region on the RNA-binding activity of IBV nsp9 protein The effect of these mutations on the single strand RNA-binding activity of IBV nsp9 was then investigated by Northwestern blotting. Approximately equal amounts of the purified wild type and G98D mutant proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE either before or after removal of the 6-His tag (Fig. 4a, top panel) . Once again, formation of reasonable amounts of dimer was detected in the purified wild type protein (Fig. 4a , top panel, lane 3). After transfer to a Hybond C extra membrane, the RNA-binding activities of wild type and G98D mutant proteins were analyzed by Northwestern blot with two probes corresponding, respectively, to the positive-and negative-sense 3′-UTR of IBV. The results showed that both wild type and G98D mutant proteins with the 6-His tag could efficiently bind to either probe (Fig.  4a, middle and bottom panels, lanes 1 and 2) . It was noted that efficient detection of the dimeric form of the two proteins was achieved when either probe was used (Fig. 4a , middle and bottom panels, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting preferential binding of the probes to the homodimer of the protein. After removal of the 6-His tag, both the monomeric and dimeric forms of the purified wild type protein could still efficiently bind to either probe (Fig. 4a , middle and bottom panels, lane 3). However, very weak, if any, binding of the G98D mutant protein to either probe was observed after removal of the 6-His tag (Fig. 4a, middle and bottom panels, lane 4) , suggesting that this point mutation abolishes the RNA-binding activity of IBV nsp9 protein. The other three mutant proteins showed similar RNA-binding activity as wild type protein, except that G98A mutant showed greatly reduced binding activity to the negative RNA probe (Fig. 4a, lane 7) . The binding efficiency of wild type and the four mutant proteins was then quantified by densitometry measurement of bands from three independent experiments. The relative RNA-binding efficiencies of the mutant proteins to wild type protein are shown in Fig. 4b . The results demonstrated that the G98D mutant protein maintained 0 and 4% binding efficiencies, and the G98A mutant showed 75 and 10% binding efficiencies to the positive and negative probes, respectively (Fig. 4b) . The I95A and I95N mutant proteins showed 80 to 100% binding efficiencies to both probes (Fig. 4b) . Biochemical and functional characterization of the effects of K10A, Y31A, K51A, Y87A and K90A mutations on dimerization and RNA-binding activity of IBV nsp9 protein Biochemical characterization of the effects of other five mutations (K10A, Y31A, K51A, Y87A and K90A) on the dimerization and RNAbinding activity of IBV nsp9 protein was then carried out. The K10A, Y31A, K51A and K90A mutant proteins were successfully expressed in bacteria and purified to near homogeneity. Efforts were made to express the Y87A mutant protein in the same system. However, very low, if any, expression of the mutant protein was consistently observed for some unknown reasons (data not shown). This mutant construct was not included in the subsequent studies. After removing the 6-His tag, the purified proteins were treated with 0-2% of glutaraldehyde and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, showing gradually increased detection of the homodimer following cross-linking of wild type and mutant proteins with increasing concentrations of the cross-linking agent (Fig. 5a) . Analysis of the purified proteins by gel filtration showed the presence of two peaks for wild type and the mutant proteins (Fig. 5a) . The relative binding activities of wild type and I95A, I95N, G98A and G98D mutant nsp9 proteins to either positive or negative sense probes were quantified by densitometry measurement of individual bands in three independent Northwestern blot experiments, as shown above. The binding activity of wild type nsp9 protein to both probes was treated as 100%. The RNA-binding activity of wild type and the mutant proteins was then analyzed by Northwestern blot in three independent experiments. As a representative gel shown in Fig. 5b , the K10A and K90A mutations greatly reduced the RNA-binding activity to either probe (lanes 2 and 5). The K51A mutant protein showed moderately reduced binding activity (Fig. 5b, lane 4) , and the Y31A mutant protein showed marginally reduced binding activity (Fig. 5b, lanes 3 and 6) . Quantification by densitometry measurement of bands from three independent experiments showed that the K10A and K90A mutants maintained approximately 10% binding efficiency to either probe, the Fig. 5 . Biochemical and functional analysis of the effects of K10A, Y31A, K51A and K90A mutations on dimerization and RNA-binding activity of IBV nsp9 protein as well as the growth properties of the recovered mutant viruses. (a) Analysis of dimerization of wild type mutant IBV nsp9 protein after chemical cross-linking (upper panels) and by gel-filtration (lower panels). The purified wild type and mutant nsp9 proteins were treated with 0-2% of glutaraldehyde, and analyzed by SDS-15% polyacrylamide gel. The monomeric (m) and dimeric (d) forms of the protein are indicated. Numbers on the left indicate molecular masses in kiloDalton. The purified wild type and mutant nsp9 proteins were also analyzed by gel filtration assay using BioSuiteTM 250 HR SEC column (7.8 × 300 mm, Waters) on Shimadszu chromatograph (LC-10ATvp) equipped with a photodiode array detector (SPD-M20A). The column was equilibrated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with PBS buffer at room temperature. The protein samples (300 μl) were injected at a given concentration and detected. The first peak was formed by the nsp9s dimer (∼ 24 kDa), and the second peak the monomer (∼12 kDa). (b) Analysis of the RNA-binding activity of wild type and mutant IBV nsp9 protein. Northwestern analysis of the RNA binding activity of wild type and K10A, Y31A, K51A and K90A mutant nsp9 proteins. The purified wild type and mutant nsp9 proteins without the 6xHis tag were separated on two SDS-15% polyacrylamide gels. One gel was directly detected by staining with Commassie blue (left column, top panel), and the second was transferred to Hybond C extra membrane. The RNA-binding activity was probed with either positive (left column, middle panel) or negative (left column, bottom panel) sense, digoxin-labeled RNA corresponding to 26,539-27,608 nucleotides of the IBV genome. The bands corresponding to the dimeric form without the His tag (d) and the monomeric form without the His tag (m) are indicated. Numbers on the left indicate molecular masses in kiloDalton. The relative binding activities of wild type and mutant nsp9 protein to either positive or negative sense probes were quantified by densitometry measurement of individual bands in three independent Northwestern blot experiments, as shown above (right column). The binding activity of wild type nsp9 protein to both probes was treated as 100%. (c) Plaque sizes (top panels) and growth curves (lower panel) of wild type and K10A, Y31A, K51A and K90A mutant viruses. Monolayers of Vero cells on a 6-well plate were infected with 100 μl of 1000-fold diluted virus stock and cultured in the presence of 0.5% carboxymethy cellulose at 37°C for 3 days. The cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% toluidine. Vero cells were infected with wild type and K10A, Y31A, K51A and K90A mutant viruses, and harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 30 and 36 h post-inoculation, respectively. Viral stocks were prepared by freezing/thawing of the cells three times and TCID50 of each viral stock was determined by infecting five wells of Vero cells on 96-well plates in triplicate with 10-fold serial dilution of each viral stock. K51A mutant protein approximately 35 and 55% binding efficiencies to the positive and negative probes, respectively, and the Y31A and I95N mutant proteins 80 to 100% binding efficiencies to both probes (Fig.  5c) . The growth properties of the recovered K10A, Y31A, K51A and K90A mutant viruses on Vero cells were tested by analysis of plaque sizes and growth curves of the passage 3 mutant viruses. As shown in Fig. 6c , very similarly sized plaques were observed in cells infected with wild type (rIBV) and Y31A and K51A mutant viruses. In cells infected with K10A and K90A and mutant viruses, plaques with slightly smaller size were observed (Fig. 5c) . Analysis of the growth curves of wild type and mutant viruses demonstrated that the Y31A and K51A exhibited similar growth kinetics as wild type virus, reaching the peak at 16 h post-infection (Fig. 5c ). At this time point, the titers of the two mutant viruses were approximately 5 fold lower than that of wild type virus (Fig. 5c) . The other two mutant viruses, K10A and K90A, grew slightly more slowly than wild type virus, reaching the peak at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 5c) . The titers of these mutant viruses were approximately 20 fold lower than that of wild type virus (Fig. 5c ).
