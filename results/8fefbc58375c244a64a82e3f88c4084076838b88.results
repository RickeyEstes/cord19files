The NSP4 membrane-destabilizing domain has structural similarities to known viroporins. One goal of these studies was to identify the NSP4 domain that induces ER calcium permeability and the PLC-independent elevation of [Ca 2ϩ ]cyto. Previously, an ER-proximal polybasic domain (amino acids [aa] 48 to 91) was shown to permeabilize both mammalian and Escherichia coli membranes (29, 30) . In BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli, NSP4 expression disrupts inner membrane integrity, leading to T7 lysozymemediated cell lysis (29) . Since other viroporins cause lysis in this assay (31) (32) (33) , we hypothesized that this domain of NSP4 functioned as a viroporin. We analyzed NSP4 for the following structural motifs common to viroporins: oligomerization domains, lysine-or arginine-rich basic regions, and amphipathic ␣-helices (6, 16) . Previous studies showed that NSP4 oligomerizes through a coiled-coil domain (CCD; aa 95 to 137) (34) . Next, based on the helical propensity of NSP4 aa 48 to 91 (NSP4 ), helical wheel models of the simian agent 11 (SA11) NSP4 putative viroporin domain were generated. The N-terminal helix is predicted to be amphipathic and contains a cluster of lysine residues on one face of the helix. The C-terminal helix is also predicted to be amphipathic, with distinct polar and nonpolar surfaces (Fig. 1A) . These subdomains were named the pentalysine domain (PD) and amphipathic domain (AD). To determine if the PD, AD, and CCD were necessary for membrane permeabilization, SA11 NSP4 truncation and deletion constructs were tested for membrane-destabilizing activity (MDA) using the bacterial lysis assay (Fig. 1B) . In the absence of IPTG (isopropyl-␤-D-thiogalactopyranoside), bacteria bearing an NSP4 47-146 expression vector continued to grow (Fig. 1C , black line), but induction of NSP4 expression led to rapid cell lysis (red line). Cell lysis was not directly caused by NSP4 because the optical density of BL21(DE3) E. coli (lacking lysozyme) expressing NSP4 47-146 remained stable (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Expression of NSP4 , which includes only the PD and AD, slowed the kinetics but not the extent of cell lysis (Fig. 1C , orange line). Deletion of the PD had no effect on MDA (Fig. 1C , blue line), but deletion of the AD abrogated lysis (green line). Immunoblot analysis showed that all four constructs were expressed, though detection of NSP4 47-90 required that 5-fold more cell lysate had to be analyzed, reflecting a lower level of expression (Fig. 1D ). The MDA of NSP4 suggested that the putative viroporin domain could oligomerize independently of the CCD. To test this, partially purified NSP4 47-90 was analyzed by immunoblotting following reducing or nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 1E ). In the absence of ␤-mercaptoethanol (BME), the major species detected had the fastest-migrating band of~18 kDa, and slower-migrating species were also detected, with their molecular masses increasing in~12-kDa increments. In the presence of BME, the fastest-migrating band was~10 kDa, and slower-migrating species increased in molecular masses of~6-kDa increments. These data indicate that NSP4 47-90 forms disulfide-stabilized dimers that further oligomerize into higher-molecular-weight species that are stabilized by the lipidmimetic SDS in the running buffer. The putative viroporin domain contains two conserved cysteine residues (Fig. 1A , arrowheads) that could support disulfide bond formation, and SDS-stabilized oligomers have been observed for other viroporins (35) (36) (37) . Together, these data show that the viroporin domain oligomerizes independently of the CCD and is sufficient for NSP4 MDA and that this activity is mediated by the AD amphipathic ␣-helix. PD lysine residues 62, 66, and 69 promote NSP4 MDA. The above-described results suggested that the PD is dispensable for MDA when this domain is deleted from NSP4, leaving the AD with a free amino terminus. However, clustered lysine residues are important for the activity of other viroporins (38, 39) , so we next sought to determine whether the five clustered lysine residues were important for NSP4 MDA in the context of the full viroporin domain. First, using site-directed mutagenesis, all five positively charged lysine residues (aa 55, 59, 62, 66, and 69) in the SA11 NSP4 47-146 truncation were replaced by glutamic acid, a negatively charged residue that would not disrupt the helical propensity. This mutation blocked MDA, indicating that one or more lysine residues were crucial for NSP4-mediated membrane disruption (data not shown). To determine which lysine residues were important, each lysine was replaced by glutamic acid individually or in combinations of two or three within the context of SA11 NSP4 . This slightly shorter construct was used to make the generation of multiple mutations easier, and no Lysine-to-glutamic acid mutants were tested in the E. coli lysis assay. The OD 600 of uninduced (ϪIPTG, black line) or NSP4-expressing cultures was determined at 10-min intervals for 90 minutes and presented as the percent optical density relative to the optical density at the time of induction. (Bottom) Immunoblot of NSP4 expression using monoclonal antibody B4-2/55. (B, top) Lysine-to-alanine and lysine-to-histidine mutants were tested in the E. coli lysis assay, as described above. (Bottom) Immunoblot of NSP4 expression using monoclonal antibody B4-2/55. difference in the rate or extent of bacterial cell lysis was observed between NSP4 47-146 and NSP4 (compare red lines of Fig. 1C and 2A). The MDA of wild-type (WT) NSP4 54-146 (red line) was equivalent to that of the single lysine-to-glutamic acid mutant K69E ( Fig. 2A , orange line) and the other single mutants (data not shown). Double or triple mutations of any combination of K55, K59, and K62 to glutamic acid also showed wild-type MDA (data not shown). Double or triple mutations of any combination of K62, K66, and K69 to glutamic acid (K62,66,69E) reduced NSP4 54-146 MDA ( Fig. 2A) , with the triple K62,66,69E mutation (gray line) showing continued growth similar to that of the uninduced negative control. Immunoblot analysis of total cell lysates showed expression of each mutant ( Fig. 2A, bottom) . These data indicate that the C-terminal lysine res-idues (aa 62, 66, and 69) within the PD were important for NSP4 MDA. Lysine is uniquely suited for membrane interaction because the positively charged -amine can form an electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged phosphate head group, bringing a protein in close proximity to the membrane (40) . Positively charged residues (lysine or arginine) are highly conserved within the PD among all serogroup A rotavirus NSP4 sequences (41) , suggesting that the charge may be functionally relevant. To determine whether the charges of residues 62, 66, and 69 were crucial for NSP4 MDA, we constructed lysine-toalanine (a nonpolar residue) and lysineto-histidine (an aromatic basic residue) mutants and tested them in the bacterial lysis assay (Fig. 2B) . While both the double (K66,69H) (Fig. 2B , maroon line) and triple (K62,66,69H) (blue line) lysine-tohistidine mutants showed wild-type MDA, the double lysine-to-alanine mutant (K66,69A) (Fig. 2B , gray line) showed impaired activity, and the triple lysine-to-alanine mutant (K62,66,69A) (purple line) had no MDA, similar to that of the K62,66,69E mutant (Fig. 2B ). Immunoblot analysis confirmed similar expression of the constructs (Fig. 2B , bottom). These data indicate that mutations that disrupt the positive charge of the PD also disrupt NSP4 MDA. Amphipathicity of the viroporin domain is necessary for MDA. In viroporins, the amphipathic ␣-helix forms the pore lumen upon oligomerization of the protein. Thus, disruption of NSP4 AD amphipathicity would be predicted to abolish MDA. To test this prediction, a six-residue mutant was constructed that changed aa 75 to 80 from IFNTLL to ASDASA and substantially decreased the amphipathic moment of the AD (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). As expected, the ASDASA mutant had no MDA (Fig. 3A , gray line). To identify residues on the polar and nonpolar sides of the AD crucial for MDA, we made point mutations in the context of SA11 NSP4 . Residues on the nonpolar side were replaced by either serine or asparagine (small polar residues), whereas residues on the polar side were replaced by either alanine or leucine (small and large nonpolar residues). The MDA of the AD mutants clustered into the following three groups: wild-type MDA (C71S, F76S, N77A, T78A, L80S, K81L, and N77A T78A) ( The importance of ␣-helical secondary structure was investigated by inserting a proline-glycine dipeptide (PG) at various places within the PD or AD (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material) within the NSP4 54-146 construct. Since PG disrupts helices, if the structure at the site of insertion is important, then the MDA would be reduced. PG insertion after lysine 59, which is not important for MDA, had wild-type MDA (see Fig. S3 , orange line, in the supplemental material). PG insertion after residues 62 or 67 reduced the rate, but not the extent, of MDA (see Fig. S3 , green and blue lines). PG insertion after residues 71 and 76 (within the AD) significantly impaired and abolished MDA, respectively (see Fig. S3 , dark blue and gray lines, respectively). Thus, the propensity of the viroporin domain to form a helical structure is important, though to differing degrees depending on the location. NSP4 bacterial cytotoxicity is mediated by the viroporin domain. While bacterial lysis in the above-described assays was mediated by T7 lysozyme, it remained unclear whether NSP4 was cytotoxic to cells. Since the optical density of cells lacking lysozyme upon induction of NSP4 47-146 expression remained unchanged (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), NSP4 expression may cause cell death in the absence of cell lysis. To determine if wild-type or mutant NSP4 proteins decreased cell viability, the number of CFU/milliliter plated in the absence or presence of 1 mM IPTG was determined (Fig. 4) . Wild-type NSP4 95-146 , which lacks the viroporin domain, was used as the negative control and showed a decrease of only 2 ϫ 10 8 CFU/ml. In contrast, the viability of wild-type NSP4 54-146 -expressing cells dropped by 7 ϫ 10 8 CFU/ml, a Ͼ99% decrease. The NTK mutant had a similar drop in cell viability, but expression of the K62,66,69E, F76S L79S, and ASDASA mutants showed a significantly attenuated loss of viability. Thus, these data show that NSP4 itself is cytotoxic to bacteria without causing cell lysis, and the putative viroporin domain is the primary mediator of this cytotoxicity. The NSP4 viroporin domain is inserted into membranes. Based upon the structure of the 2B viroporin, the NSP4 viroporin domain would be predicted to form a two-helix transmembrane hairpin. However, this predicted structure conflicts with the accepted topology of full-length NSP4, wherein aa 25 to 44 is an ER signal sequence that directs transmembrane insertion, and the viroporin domain is peripherally associated with the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane (42) . Thus, we sought to determine if, in the absence of the transmembrane domain encompassing aa 25 to 44, the viroporin domain is peripherally associated with membranes, as predicted by the current topology model, or inserted through membranes, as would be expected if NSP4 is a viroporin. A series of truncations (Fig. 5A ) that contain both the viroporin domain and the soluble CCD (NSP4 ), only the viroporin domain (NSP4 ), or only the CCD (NSP4 95-146 ), a soluble tetrameric coiled-coil domain (43) , were expressed in bacteria. The cells were separated into soluble, peripheral, or integral membrane fractions and analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5B ). Both NSP4 and NSP4 were found solely in the integral membrane protein fraction, but NSP4 95-146 was found predominantly in the soluble fraction, indicating the viroporin domain directed membrane insertion of the NSP4 47-146 and NSP4 truncations. To determine if the PD or AD mutants altered membrane insertion of the viroporin domain, we compared the membrane fractionation profiles of K55,59,62,66,69E and ASDASA with that of wild-type NSP4 (Fig. 5C ). As before, wild-type NSP4 was found entirely in the integral membrane fraction, as was the ASDASA mutant. The K55,59,62,66,69E mutant migrated slightly faster due to a greater net negative charge and was found primarily in the peripheral membrane protein fraction, with a minor amount detected in the integral membrane fraction. Thus, while disruption of both the positive charge of the PD and the amphipathic organization of the AD blocked NSP4 MDA, only disruption of the positive charge prevented transmembrane insertion of the viroporin domain. Together, these data point to a role for the PD in membrane insertion of NSP4. To assess whether mutations of the viroporin domain affected the expression or folding of full-length NSP4 expressed in mammalian monkey kidney cells, NSP4-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion proteins for WT or K62,66,69E,NTK and ASDASA viroporin mutants were tested by immunoblotting. WT NSP4-EGFP was expressed, and endo-␤-Nacetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) treatment, to remove N-linked carbohydrates, increased NSP4 migration, indicating that it was glycosylated (Fig. 5D ). Both the NTK and ASDASA mutants were expressed and glycosylated similarly to WT NSP4 (NTK data not shown). K62,66,69E was barely detectable by immunoblotting, migrated similarly to unglycosylated NSP4, and was not susceptible to endo H treatment; however, treatment with the proteosome inhibitor MG132 (50 M) increased levels of nonglycosylated K62,66,69E (Fig. 5D) , suggesting that it might be targeted for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) (44) . These data were confirmed by flow cytometry, as the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for K62,66,69E was significantly lower than that of the WT and increased 288% with MG132 treatment (Fig. 5E ). To ensure that K62,66,69E was still membrane associated, we sepa- rated cells into soluble, peripheral, and integral membrane fractions, marked by immunoblot detection of GFP, GM130, and STIM-1, respectively (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). In the absence of MG132, the WT and ASDASA were detected exclusively in the integral membrane fraction. In the presence of MG132, K62,66,69E was found primarily in the integral membrane fraction, but some protein was detected in the soluble and peripheral membrane protein fractions (Fig. 5F ). Together, these data suggest that NSP4 is initially targeted to the ER membrane via the noncleaved signal sequence (aa 28 to 44), but the lysine cluster directed translocation of the viroporin domain (aa 47 to 90) into the membrane. Altering the charge of the lysine cluster blocked membrane insertion of the viroporin domain in E. coli and targeted NSP4 for ERAD-mediated degradation in mammalian cells. Thus, the lysines facilitate proper NSP4 folding by directing viroporin domain insertion into the membrane. Viroporin mutants fail to elevate intracellular calcium levels in mammalian cells. Intracellular expression of fulllength NSP4 in eukaryotic cells leads to increased ER permeability and a significant increase in [Ca 2ϩ ]cyto (26, 28) . We tested the mutants characterized using the E. coli lysis assay to determine if the viroporin domain is responsible for the increased [Ca 2ϩ ]cyto using the fluorescent calcium indicator Indo-1. Using flow cytometry, we measured the mean [Ca 2ϩ ]cyto of cells expressing EGFP, the WT, or viroporin mutant NSP4-EGFP (Fig. 6) . Expression of WT NSP4-EGFP increased the ratio of calcium-bound to calcium-free Indo-1 fluorescence, shifting the EGFP-positive population to the right (Fig. 6A, blue) , but histograms for cells expressing NSP4-EGFP K62,66,69E or ASDASA remained clustered to the left (Fig. 6A , red and green, respectively). Cytoplasmic calcium levels (Fig. 5B) ]cyto causes rapid formation of the puncta, and in rotavirus-infected cells, NSP4 colocalizes with LC3 in these puncta that surround viroplasms, cytoplasmic inclusions where genome replication and progeny virus assembly occur (45) . Thus, assessment of NSP4 puncta formation acts as a surrogate for testing the ability of viroporin mutants to form the viroplasm-associated puncta. The subcellular localization and distribution of WT or mutant NSP4-EGFP fusion proteins were analyzed in normal medium (1.8 mM CaCl 2 ), which supports spontaneous puncta formation for wildtype NSP4. The extent of ER localization for EGFP, WT NSP4- EGFP, and the three NSP4-EGFP viroporin mutants (K62,66,69E, NTK, and ASDASA) was determined by colocalization with an ER-targeted DsRed2 fluorescent protein using confocal microscopy (Fig. 7A) . EGFP was found throughout the cell and did not localize to the ER or form puncta (Fig. 7A, first row) . As seen previously, WT NSP4-EGFP localized partially to the ER compartment and to distinct puncta that did not contain the DsRed-ER marker (Fig. 7A, second row) . In contrast, NSP4-EGFP viroporin mutants were localized primarily in the ER, with cells expressing K62,66,69E and ASDASA lacking puncta (Fig. 7A , third and fifth rows, respectively), with a few small discrete puncta that did not contain DsRed-ER being observed in cells expressing NTK. Next, we tested if changes in [Ca 2ϩ ]cyto directly regulated puncta formation by quantitating the number of NSP4-EGFPexpressing cells containing puncta (i) in normal DMEM, (ii) after treatment with the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA-AM, or (iii) after treatment with TG, a SERCA pump inhibitor that elevates cytoplasmic calcium levels. This experiment was designed to determine if BAPTA treatment to buffer the elevated [Ca 2ϩ ]cyto caused by the viroporin activity of WT NSP4 would decrease puncta formation and if TG treatment to pharmacologically elevate [Ca 2ϩ ]cyto would induce puncta formation of NSP4 viroporin-deficient mutants. In normal DMEM, WT NSP4-EGFP formed discrete puncta in 93.3% of cells, but the viroporin mutants formed significantly fewer puncta, with rates of 9.4% for K62,66,69E, 55.5% for NTK, and 10.7% for ASDASA (Fig. 7B , black bars) (P Ͻ 0.01). BAPTA-AM treatment of WT NSP4-EGFP-expressing cells reduced puncta formation to 53.7% (Fig. 7B) (P Ͻ 0.01 ). An overall decrease in the number of punctacontaining cells was also observed in BAPTA-treated viroporin mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 7B ) (P of Ͻ0.01 for NTK and AS-DASA). Finally, cytoplasmic calcium levels were elevated pharmacologically with TG to determine if exogenous calcium stimulation would induce puncta formation of the viroporin NSP4-EGFP mutants. TG treatment did not significantly increase the number of puncta-containing WT NSP4-EGFP-expressing cells (Fig. 7B) . In contrast, TG treatment increased puncta formation by 28.4% for K62,66,69E, 25.7% for NTK, and 39.5% for ASDASA (Fig. 7B,  light gray) . Thus, mutation of the viroporin domain decreased spontaneous puncta formation; however, pharmacological elevation of [Ca 2ϩ ]cyto induced puncta formation of the mutant proteins. Together, these data show (i) that the viroporin mutants were specifically deficient in the elevation of [Ca 2ϩ ]cyto but not in the ability to form puncta, (ii) that elevated [Ca 2ϩ ]cyto triggers the trafficking of NSP4 out of the ER and into cytoplasmic puncta, and (iii) that elevation of [Ca 2ϩ ]cyto and formation of puncta are separable steps within this process.
