The final database included 1187 articles (Fig. 1) . The articles collated in this study came from almost 100 different journals with publication years ranging from 1905 (#149) to 2006 (average publication year = 1991). Surprisingly, of the top 1000 most cited critical care articles, 662 were not found using any of the basic critical care search terms-critical care, intensive care, ICU, or critically ill/critical illness. These articles were discovered only after searching within a specific critical care journal (n = 227) or by specific critical care topics (Table 1 ) (n = 373). In fact, only 4 of the top 1000 articles could be found using any 1 of the 4 basic critical care terms listed above. Of these search terms, the most productive was "intensive care" (25 of top 100 articles), then "critically ill" or "critical illness" (19/100), "ICU" (11/ 100), and finally "critical care" (5/100). Sepsis/systemic inflammatory response syndrome was the most common topic (193 articles), followed by acute lung injury and mechanical ventilation (177 articles). Overall, 41% of the most cited articles came from critical care journals as designated by the JCR. The most articles were from Critical Care Medicine (23%) followed by American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care (7%), Journal of Trauma (5%), Intensive Care Medicine (4%), and Shock (1%). Among the non-critical care journals, the New England Journal of Medicine (11%) followed by JAMA (9%) provided the most articles.
