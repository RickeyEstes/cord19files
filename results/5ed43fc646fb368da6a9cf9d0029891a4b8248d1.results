To generate a probe which would detect the H,K-ATPase and not cross react with the Na,K-ATPase, we prepared a polyclonal antipeptide antibody (HK9) directed against the aminoterminal region of the H,K-ATPase ( Fig. 1 , amino acids 3-22). A detailed description of the production and full characterization of this antibody is provided elsewhere (Okusa, M., C. J. Gottardi, V. M. Rajendron, H. Binder, and M. J. Caplan, manuscript in preparation). As can be seen in Fig. 2 , immunostaining performed on 0.5 # sections of rat stomach reveals that this antibody reacts exclusively with the H,K-ATPase-rich parietal cells which line the gastric glands (Fig. 2 A) . This staining pattern is consistent with previous H,K-ATPase localizations (Smolka and Weinstein, 1986) . Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry employing this antibody demonstrates specific H,K-ATPase labeling of the cytoplasmic surfaces of tubulovesicular and apical canalicular membranes (Fig. 2 B) . This antibody does not label the parietal cell basolateral membrane (arrowheads), which is instead endowed with a high concentration of Na,K-ATPase (Soroka et al., 1992) . Thus, despite extensive sequence homology, the H,K-ATPase and Na,K-ATPase en-A ~,! coo. COOH Figure 1 . The catalytic subunit of the H,K-ATPase is 62% identical to the Na,K-ATPase. (A) The sequences of the Na,K-ATPase tx and H,K-ATPase ot were aligned according to . Putative transmembrane domains, as predicted by hydropathy analysis of both sequences (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) are represented as tightly packed helices. Cytoplasmic loop domains are not based on structural information. Each circle denotes a single amino acid, and each darkened circle represents an amino acid identity between the two proteins. Note that the region of greatest dissimilarity lies within the first 26 amino acids. Our HK9 antibody is directed against a peptide made from amino acids 3-22 of this H,K-ATPase cz sequence. The schematic in B represents the H519N chimera (see Methods for a complete description of the generation of this hybrid protein); darkened circles represent Na,K-ATPase-specific or shared amino acids, unfilled circles represent H,K-ATPase specific amino acids. The asterisk (*) marks amino acid 519, which is the glycine residue that is regenerated in the chimeric protein. zymes occupy distinct membranous domains within the gastric parietal cell.
