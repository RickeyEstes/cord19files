A total of 162 guano samples of bats were collected from seven bat colonies located at seven different sites around the city of Bourges in the central region of France, during the summer of 2014 (Figure 1 ). Guano collections were all carried out in July, except for colony 7, which was completed in August. CoV RNA was detected in five out of 162 samples. All the CoV-positive samples were detected from Pipistrellus pipistrellus. No CoV RNA was detected from Barbastella barbastellus, Myotis myotis and Eptesicus serotinus. Prevalence of CoV was estimated at 3.1% (CI95%: (0.4%; 5.8%)) in the whole sample, all positive sample being detected in Pipistrellus pipistrellus, leading to a prevalence for this species estimated at 4.2% (CI95% : (0.6%; 7.9%)), compared to 0% for the other species; however, this difference in prevalence was not significant (Fisher' exact test, p = 0.32). To characterize the overall diversity of CoV sequences, a phylogenetic analysis of bat CoVs was performed using the sequences of a 440 base pairs (bps) PCR amplicon of the RdRp gene from three positive samples. Two sequences, Ppip1_FR_2014 and Ppip2_FR_2014, were obtained from guano collected in a same bat colony. The third French sequence, Ppip3_FR_2014, was obtained from guano collected from another bat colony located 12 km from the first site. For the two remaining samples, we were not able to obtain the sequence of the fragment. Nucleotide sequence analysis shows that the bat CoV corresponding to the sequences amplified from French bats belong to alpha-CoV genera ( Figure 2) . Comparison of the RdRp-aligned sequences was carried out on 277 positions, including gaps, for a total of 48 taxa: three original sequences and 45 previously published ( Table 2 ). The beta-CoV and alpha-CoV sequences are clearly separated in two groups supported each by 100% bootstrap value ( Figure 2 ). Our analyses showed that genetic divergence between beta-and alpha-CoV sequences is up to 35%. Among the alpha-CoV group, sequences appear separated in two lineages: 1 and 2 ( Figure 2 ). Nucleotide divergence between groups 1 and 2 varies from 22.02% to 30% ( Figure S1 ). We also noticed that sequences of alpha-CoV are grouped according to the host species and independently of date or of the sampling location. Thus, lineage 1 includes several groups of sequences: (i) HKU8 sequences obtained from The other analyzed sequences appear highly differentiated with important levels of mutational steps among them (from 34 to 62). An exception is nevertheless observed for the sequences Pkuh2_ITA_2010, Ppip_NLD_2008, Ppip1_FR_2014, Ppip2_FR_2014, Nlas_SP_2007, and Mmyo_SP_2007, which appear more closely related with less than eight mutational steps among them. The topology of the minimal spanning network adopts the same configuration than the phylogenetic tree. Indeed, lineage 2 observed on the tree is characterized by short branches lengths suggesting a recent diversification for these sequences. They also appear closely interconnected in the network, with low levels of mutational steps among them. In contrast, lineage 1 of the phylogenetic tree is characterized by longer branches lengths, suggesting ancient separations among sequences of this lineage. Important levels of genetic divergence observed between these sequences corroborate this result. Phylogeographic and phylogenetic analyses therefore give congruent results, although the minimum spanning network sometimes give a better robustness for some groups, represented by lower bootstrap values in the phylogenetic tree.
