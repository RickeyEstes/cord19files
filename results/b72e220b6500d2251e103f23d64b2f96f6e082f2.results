Principles of the GenomeLandscaper method. To conduct landscape analysis of genome-fingerprints maps (GFM) and retrospectively assess the global architectures of assembled chromosomes, we establish the GenomeLandscaper method based on our GenomeFingerprinter algorithm 19 . The steps of working flow with key features are illustrated by using the primates mitochondria genomes (<17.0 Kbp, kilos of base pairs) including Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Macaca fascicularis and Macaca mulatta (Fig. 1) .
