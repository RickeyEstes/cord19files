The overall seroprevalence and ELISA titer of IBV antibodies revealed in this study were 54.5% and 4949, respectively. No clinical signs were observed in chickens at the time of blood sampling. The highest mean titer (7597) was observed in Sari, while the lowest (1373) was observed in Amol (Table 1) . According to real time PCR results, 31 samples from 75 were IBV genome-positive (Table 2) . For spike gene, RT-PCR, using degenerate primers, resulted in amplification of ~390 bp product. The phylogeny of the IBVs strains isolated in Iran and their relationship to other representative IBV strains were assessed based on sequence analysis of the S gene variable region. Their phylogenetic relationships were compared with IBV sequences available in GenBank and the representatives of the different genotypes. Fig. 1 . demonstrates the phylogenetic tree for representatives of each group of IBV isolates and some reference strains of IBV base Spike gene. We detected 3 genotypes: (1)
