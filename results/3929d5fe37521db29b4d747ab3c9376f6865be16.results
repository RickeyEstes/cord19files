Important characteristics of the procedure. The sample processing workflow as depicted in Fig. 2 and described in detail in Supplementary File 1, is applicable with RNA or DNA as input and has been proven with respect to diagnostic metagenomics in veterinary medicine 4, 5, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Here, the workflow was further tested for different sample types and pathogens as described below. The workflow starts with a sample disintegration followed by RNA extraction. With only a few exceptions, which are discussed later, the provided protocol is suitable for the extraction of RNA from a broad range of sample types. The protocol proceeds from purified RNA to the final sequencing library with only a single intermediate purification step. This ensures maximum preservation of the information content of the sample. Routinely, 500 ng (100-1,000 ng) purified total RNA are used for the synthesis of double stranded cDNA in a one-tube reaction, but the protocol is also suitable for extremely low input of RNA, even if the amount cannot be determined. Preferably, RNA solutions with concentrations lower than 10 ng/µl should be concentrated (option in Fig. 2 .; Supplementary File 1, Procedure, optional steps 31-38 and Troubleshooting). After cDNA synthesis, the DNA is fragmented without prior purification to avoid loss of material. Depending on the selected sequencing platform, we provide two possibilities for library preparation ( Fig. 2A) , one detailed manual procedure for sequencing with Ion Torrent (Supplementary File 1, Procedure, steps 59-77) and one automated procedure for sequencing with Illumina MiSeq (Supplementary File 1, Procedure, steps 78-92). For optimal sequencing results, the library fragment size should be within the specified range of the used sequencing platform and protocols. For both presented sequencing platforms, we apply a target peak size of 550 bp with a size range of 300-1,000 bp. This is achieved with a single two-step size selection procedure using solid-phase paramagnetic bead technology. Because the size of the bound DNA depends on the buffer concentration, calibration of the paramagnetic beads (Supplementary File 1, Reagent setup) is a prerequisite for a reproducible size selection. Sample disintegration to extract high quality nucleic acids. Since the availability of the nucleic acids for library preparation is the determinant for the prospect of success of the effort, we compared three different sample disintegration techniques for their suitability to ensure the release of the nucleic acids from the sample Figure 1 .

Scientific RePoRtS | (2018) 8:13108 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-31496-1 material. The applied methods were two bead-beating techniques, one usually conducted in lysis buffer at room temperature, here represented by the TissueLyser, and one conducted with deep-frozen samples, here represented by the Micro-Dismembrator. The third applied technique was cryofracturing using the cryoPREP device. These techniques were tested using a number of different sample matrices and hard-to-break target species. Figure 3A shows the RNA quality achieved with the three techniques in disintegrating suspensions of exponentially growing bacterial cells or hard-shelled Gram-positive endospores (Fig. 3A , see also Supplementary File 1, Fig. A1 ). Clear bands of small and large subunits of ribosomal RNA, suggestive of high quality nucleic acid, were observed using the cryoPREP impactor or the Micro-Dismembrator grinding mill. In addition, we found a statistically significant (Fisher's Exact Test, p ≤ 2.2E-16) increase in the proportions of mycobacterial reads in datasets derived from one tap water sample processed with cryoPREP compared to the dataset for the same sample without cry-oPREP treatment (compare graphs for library IDs 2093 and 2094 in Supplementary File 2). Likewise, comparing the same datasets, we found statistically significant increases of obligate intracellular Coxiella species (3-fold, p ≤ 2.2E-16), of Parachlamydia-related species of amoebae (2-fold, p ≤ 2.39E-12), of Legionella species (7-fold, p ≤ 2.2E-16), and of Gram-positive Bacillaceae (5-fold, p ≤ 2.2E-16). Like for pure bacterial suspensions shown above, in case of pig faeces, the TissueLyser-disintegrated sample also showed the strongest degradation of RNA i.e. very short RNA fragments (Fig. 3B ). In contrast, when pools of midges (insect vectors of orthobunyaviruses like Schmallenberg virus or orbiviruses like bluetongue virus) were disintegrated, cryoPREP and TissueLyser resulted in high quality RNA but not the Micro-Dismembrator (Fig. 3C) . Moreover, Mycobacterium-containing tissues (lymph nodes and intestine) were used to assess the effectiveness of disintegration using the cryoPREP in comparison with the TissueLyser. The Cq values obtained with DNA extracted after cryoPREP disintegration were for a number of samples substantially lower than those after TissueLyser treatment (Table 1 ). In summary, generally the best results were achieved for all tested matrices and pathogens with deep-frozen samples using either the Micro-Dismembrator or the cryoPREP device. Workflow verification with samples containing known verified pathogens. For the verification of the workflow, various routine diagnostic samples with pre-diagnosed pathogens were analysed. These samples comprised liquids, tissues, faeces, and foods. Table 2 summarizes results from 15 previously published and 12 new samples. We observed a substantial variation regarding the portion of reads representing the respective expected pathogen. Clearly, the observed variation is mainly caused by the strong background (see Supplementary File 2 for the 100 most abundant families found in each data set) naturally comprised in organ material and other samples (e.g., faeces or different foods) that reduces the pathogen signal in the dataset. Despite of this background, using the provided metagenomics sample processing workflow and a subsequent RIEMS 28 analysis, it was in all but two cases possible to detect the expected pathogens even if the pathogen load was rather low like in case of (Table 2 ). In the former case, the Cq for VSBV-1 was around 30 4 and 2 reads representing VSBV-1 were detected. In the latter, the Cq was around 27 after cryoPREP disintegration or nearly 41 after TissueLyser treatment and 0.001% of the reads represented MAP. The workflow works well not only for viral and bacterial pathogens but was also suitable for parasite detection (stool and wild boar in Table 2 ), albeit the proportion of parasite reads was very low. In case of ethanol-fixed stool samples, Blastocystis (0.04%) and Giardia (0.0009%) could be detected in a library generated from RNA template yielding little more than 230,000 reads. For the mycobacteria-containing samples (compare Table 1 ), we detected Mycobacterium reads only in the higher laded lymph node sample (Cq 26.7; 23 Mycobacterium reads in a total of 2.36E + 6 reads) in contrast to the intestine sample (Cq 36.8; 0 Mycobacterium reads in a total of 1.68E + 6 reads). For two samples presented in Table 2 (chicken liver with Sendai virus, library IDs 1949 IDs , 1950 IDs , 1951 and wild boar muscle with liver fluke, library IDs 2019 and 2043), technical replicates were processed and sequenced using the present workflow. In both cases, the results are congruent with regard to both the portion of pathogen and unclassified reads. Noteworthy, in all analysed samples, the proportion of unclassifiable reads was very low ( Table 2) . Determination of the reagent specific background. In order to determine the inherent background of the workflow originating from the used consumables, we extracted both DNA and RNA from selected consumables and prepared and sequenced libraries. With a single exception (library generated from DNA extracted from pooled enzymes of the cDNA synthesis kit, 2.2E +6 reads), sequencing of the libraries generated from the selected consumables resulted in only a few reads (428-4,777 reads) by sequencing the complete extracted material. In the RIEMS 28 analysed data sets, viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic reads were detected (compare Supplementary File 2) with the most frequently detected viral sequences belonging to the Retroviridae. All RNA-derived bacterial profiles were rather similar (Fig. 4 ). Bacterial groups with the highest read abundances were Enterobacteriaceae (7-21%) and Pseudomonadaceae (3-7%), followed by Burkholderiaceae (2-6%), Propionibacteriaceae (2-4%), Comamonadaceae (1-4%), Bradyrhizobiaceae (about 1%), and Staphylococcaceae (Fig. 4 ). In contrast, the profiles obtained for the DNA datasets differed substantially between the different reagents. Moreover, the bacterial profiles determined for the DNA and RNA derived data for both the DNase and the RNeasy column were clearly distinguishable. While in the RNA datasets sequences related to the Enterobacteriaceae and the Pseudomonadaceae clearly dominated, in both mentioned DNA samples, the highest proportion was found to be related to the Comamonadaceae (about 4%). Contrarily to the situation in DNase and RNeasy column, the DNA and RNA based bacterial profiles obtained for the pooled enzymes from the cDNA synthesis kit were similar, also resembling the RNA derived profiles obtained for the DNase and the RNeasy column, especially with regard to Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae. All datasets contained eukaryotic reads, mostly mammalian sequences indicating contamination probably from the production process and/or laboratory handling. Workflow assessment with various matrices with initially unknown pathogen content. Table 3 lists results obtained from various sample matrices with unrecognized pathogen content from 13 published and 15 new samples. A major group of samples are typical diagnostic materials like different tissues, faeces, and liquids. In a number of the presented examples, novel pathogens were detected using the presented workflow and subsequently confirmed by other methods. In the other cases, sequences putatively representing pathogens were detected (see Table 3 ); however, these were not confirmed yet. Arthropod vectors represent an individual type of sample matrix that might require a special treatment to ensure successful analysis (compare Fig. 3) . Therefore, alternative homogenization and extraction options are provided here for ticks and midges (see options A and B of the Procedure). Different tick species (Ixodes ricinus, Ornithodoros porcinus, and Rhipicephalus bursa) were subjected to the described procedure and in the generated datasets, Rickettsia spp. were re-detected (previously detected via PCR 29 ). In addition, the known tick-transmitted bacterial human and animal pathogens Anaplasma spp., Francisella spp. and Mycobacterium spp. were found (compare results for library IDs 1163 and 1164 in Supplementary File 2) . In addition to the aforementioned specimens, we also tested a number of highly processed food samples (Table 3 ). In all cases (meat loaf, pizza, crude ham), the resulting DNA libraries were of high quality, allowing the taxonomic classification of the vast majority (>98.5%) of the obtained reads. The proportion of unclassified reads ranged between 0.7% and 1.5%. As expected, in case of crude ham (see Table 3 ) we did not detect any sequences potentially representing pathogens within a dataset of roughly 600,000 reads (Supplementary File 2). Of these reads, RIEMS 28 classified the vast majority of the reads as mammalian sequences and most of the remainder (558 reads) as Lactobacillus spp. Roughly 99% of the viral sequences detected in the crude ham were eukaryotic rRNA sequences misclassified as Arenavirus sequences. Further putative viral sequences represented phages.
