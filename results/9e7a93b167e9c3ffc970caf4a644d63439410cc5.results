The study participants include 503 TB patients and 419 healthy controls. The TB patient group and the healthy control group exhibited no statistical significance difference (P > 0.05) in terms of sex, age, education background and alcohol drinking. Differences in marital status, BMI, tea drinking, smoking status, history of BCG vaccination and exposure to kitchen fumes was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The univariate analysis showed that genotype GC at rs7096206 and genotype TC at rs6695096 were closely associated with TB incidence (OR reaching 1.338 and 1.468, respectively). Multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis showed that rs7096206 of MBL genes and rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes were associated with susceptibility to TB. Both genotype GC at rs7096206 of MBL genes and genotype TC at rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes were more prevalent in the TB patient group than those in the healthy control group (P < 0.05), with OR 1.393, 1.302 and 1.426 respectively (Table 2) . Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed linkage equilibrium for rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes (For controls, D' = 0.029, r 2 = 0.01; for cases, D' = 0.013, r 2 = 0.00). Marginal Structural Linear Odds Models were used to analyze the impact of the interactions between MBL genes and MASP-2 genes on susceptibility to TB. Adjusting for the covariates of sex, age, marital status, educational background, BMI, smoking status, alcohol drinking, tea drinking, history of BCG vaccination, and exposure to kitchen fumes, the relative excess risk of interaction (RERI) between rs7096206 of MBL genes and rs2273346 and rs6695096 of MASP-2 genes was found to be 0.897 (95% CI: 0.282,1.513) and 1.142(95% CI: 0.755,1.530) respectively (P < 0.05), which suggests positive interactions (Tables 3 and 4 ).
