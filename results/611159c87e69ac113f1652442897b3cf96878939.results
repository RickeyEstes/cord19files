During the study period, 315 adult patients who fulfilled the CDC clinical criteria for confirmed H1N1 influenza virus infection [10] were admitted to the ED. In 209 of these patients (66%), serum CRP levels were measured within 24 hours of admission. Blood and urine cultures were obtained on admission in 110 (53%) and in 65 (31%) of these 209 patients, respectively. Eighteen patients (9%) were excluded from this study due to a concurrent acute illness on presentation. Consequently, the final study cohort comprised 191 patients whose serum CRP levels were obtained within 24 hours of admission and whose sole acute illness was a confirmed diagnosis of H1N1 influenza-virus infection. Patients' mean age was 43 ± 16 years (range 18-85). There were 95 (50%) female and 96 (50%) male patients. The most common background medical conditions were active smoking (n = 50, 26%), asthma (n = 37, 19%), diabetes mellitus (n = 24, 13%) and COPD (n = 22, 12%). The median time from symptom onset until presentation to the ED was 72 hours (IQR 48-120). The median time from admission until first serum CRP level determination was 1 hour and 17 minutes. One hundred sixty eight (88%) patients were hospitalized and 23 (12%) were discharged to their homes after the initial evaluation in the ED. The median length of hospitalization was 3 days [2] [3] [4] [5] . Seventeen (9%) patients were admitted to the ICU, of whom eight (4%) required mechanical ventilation and three died (2%). All 185 (98%) of the 188 surviving patients contacted through a follow-up telephone survey described an unremarkable clinical course of the disease in the thirty days since they presented at the ED. With the exception of one patient who was transferred directly from the ED to the ICU, all of the admitted patients were first transferred from the ED to a hospital ward. Sixteen patients were subsequently transferred to the ICU. The median time from admission to the ED to transfer to the ICU was 53 hours (IQR 23-65). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of background medical conditions among the patients who required hospitalization in the ICU and those who did not (data not shown). The median time between the onset of first symptoms until presentation to the ED was similar for both hospitalized groups (Table 1) . Low blood oxygen saturation (≤90%) on presentation to the ED and abnormal auscultatory findings over the lung fields (bronchial breath sounds or crackles) on admission were more common in the patients who were eventually admitted to ICU compared to those who remained in the wards ( Table 1 ). The same clinical observation was noted in regard to patients who required mechanical ventilation compared to those who did not; however, in this comparison, the difference was not statistically significant (data not shown). Seventy-four of the 177 (93%) patients who underwent chest radiography within 24 hours of admission had findings consistent with pneumonia. The prevalence of these findings was significantly higher among the patients who required ICU care compared with those who did not (Table 1) . Chest radiographic findings consistent with pneumonia were also more prevalent among patients who required mechanical ventilation than among those who did not, but this difference was not significant (6/8 (75%) vs. 68/170 (40%), respectively, p = .069). Among the evaluated laboratory parameters, serum CRP levels and neutrophil percentage in a complete blood count (CBC) obtained within 24 hours of admission comprised the only two factors that significantly differentiated between patients who needed to be admitted to the ICU and those who could remain on the ward (Table 1) . Unfortunately, we could not include the parameter of patients' blood gases in the current analysis, since such a sample was obtained from only a few of the patients. Serum CRP levels were the only laboratory parameter that significantly differentiated between patients who required mechanical ventilation and those who did not (112 mg/L [IQR 45-180] vs. 43 mg/L [IQR 22-89], respectively, p = .017). Figures 1 and 2 display box-plots of serum CRP levels, according to ICU admission and need for mechanical ventilation, respectively. The ability to consider serum CRP levels obtained during the first 24 hours of ED admission as a biomarker for predicting pandemic H1N1 influenza A patients' need for ICU care or mechanical ventilation was evaluated using ROC curve analysis. The small number of deaths in our cohort precluded the performing of ROC curve analysis for that outcome. The area under the curve (AUC) for ICU admission was 0.82 (95% CI = 0.73-0.91; p < .001). The AUC for mechanical ventilation was 0.75 (95% CI = 0.60-0.90; p = .017). The sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation of serum CRP at different cut-off levels are displayed in Table 2 . The Cox proportional hazard model was applied to assess the ability of the following factors to predict the need for ICU admission: low oxygen saturation (≤90%), abnormal auscultatory findings over lung fields, chest radiograph findings consistent with pneumonia, percentage of neutrophil in a CBC, and serum CRP levels. The first variable that entered the model was CRP (p = .001), followed by abnormal auscultatory findings (p = .028). None of the other three variables entered the model afterwards. The CRP hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) for transfer to the ICU was 1.09 (1.06-1.12) for each increase of 10 mg/L in CRP level. The hazard ratio (95% CI) of presence of auscultatory findings over the lung fields for being transferred to the ICU was 3.85 (1. 16-12.8) . The Cox proportional hazard model was applied to assess the ability of serum CRP level to predict the need for mechanical ventilation. The CRP level was the only variable that entered the model (p = .018), and the hazard ratio (95% CI) for mechanical ventilation was 1.09 (1.05 -1.13) for each increase of 10 mg/L in CRP level. A Kaplan-Meier estimate of the two main outcome measures, i.e., the need for ICU admission and for mechanical ventilation, was performed using tertiles of serum CRP levels (i.e., <28, 28-69, and ≥70 mg/L). At the 30-day time point since their presentation to the ED, none of the patients with a serum CRP level <28 mg/L (lower tertile) needed to be admitted to the ICU or required mechanical ventilation (Figures 3 and 4) . At the same time point, 19% of the patients with a serum CRP level ≥70 mg/L (upper tertile) needed to be admitted to the ICU and 8% required mechanical ventilation. The differences in the rates between the lower vs. upper tertile groups were significant (Log-Rank p < .001 for ICU and p < .024 for mechanical ventilation).
