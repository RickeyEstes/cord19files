ATA effect on HSV-1 yield in V27 cells To test whether ATA could increase the yield of rHSV-1 d27-1 (d27-1) vector in V27 cells, ATA was applied to the media during the infection (ATA@step1) or dilution steps (ATA@step2) (Figure 1a ). Interestingly, ATA treatment delayed HSV-1 plaque formation or cell lysis in V27 cell monolayers. Cytopathic effect at the time of harvest, 72 hours postinfection was between 20 and 60% as compared with 100% cytopathic effect in the absence of ATA (data not shown). To determine which concentrations and conditions for ATA addition have impact on HSV DNase resistant particles per milliliter (DRP/ml) and plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU/ml) titers, ATA was added at varying concentrations (0-60 µmol/l ATA) either in six-well plates in the first step (ATA@step1) (Figure 1b ) or in T150 flasks in both steps (ATA@step1 and ATA@step2) ( Figure  1c ). Both protocols show HSV yield increase, and the optimal conditions would be either with 50 µmol/l ATA during the infection step (50 µmol/l ATA@step1) that is further diluted to the final concentration of 20 µmol/l ATA or by adding ATA at dilution step (20 µmol/l ATA@step2) to achieve the final concentration of 20 µmol/l ATA (Figure 1b,c) . In this example, the supernatant titers were 2.7 ± 0.1 × 10 8 DRP/ml and 8.1 ± 0.7 × 10 7 PFU/ml in 50 µmol/l ATA@ step1 protocol, 2.0 ± 0.7 × 10 8 DRP/ml and 7.4 ± 1.4 × 10 7 PFU/ml in 20 µmol/l ATA@step2 protocol, as compared with 7.3 ± 0.6 × 10 7 DRP/ml and 2.9 ± 0.6 × 10 7 PFU/ml of untreated control (0 µmol/l ATA) (Figure 1c ). Results are expressed as means ± SD from two independent experiments (n = 2). Importance of serum presence in ATA-HSV protocol We tested the effect of serum-free media on DRP/ml and PFU/ml HSV-1 titers in the above-described ATA-HSV protocol, which used 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Figure 2 ). In this example of ATA@ step2 protocol, serum-free media resulted in d27-1 titer reduction from 3.2 ± 0.1 × 10 8 DRP/ml and 5.4 ± 0.3 × 10 7 PFU/ml (10% FBS) to 1.1 ± 0.2 × 10 7 DRP/ml (0% FBS), where PFU/ml titer value was below the detection limit ( Figure 2 ). Even more dramatic effect of serumfree media was seen in the ATA@step1 protocol when both DRP/ml and PFU/ml titer values were below the detection limit (data not shown). Effect of ATA on wild-type HSV-1 titers in culture The effects of ATA on DRP/ml viral titers of wild-type (wt) HSV-1 strains (KOS and McIntyre) were tested when propagated in HEK-293 or Vero cells using the 50 µmol/l ATA@step1 protocol (Figure 3a) . In Vero cells, one-way analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparison test have shown that ATA significantly increased (***P < 0.001; n = 4) only the KOS strain DRP/ml titers; from 1.7 ± 1.1 × 10 8 DRP/ml (−ATA) to 9.1 ± 2.1 × 10 8 DRP/ml (+ATA) (Figure 3a ). The McIntyre virus "+ ATA" titers were also elevated, from 2.6 ± 1.5 × 10 8 DRP/ml (−ATA) to 5.8 ± 1.1 × 10 8 DRP/ml (+ATA), but according analysis of variance, the difference was not significant (P > 0.05; n = 4); (Figure 3a ). On the contrary, in HEK-293 cells, only McIntyre strain titers were significantly increased (***P < 0.001; n = 4) by ATA, from 1.4 ± 0.8 × 10 8 DRP/ml (−ATA) to 1.2 ± 0.5 × 10 9 DRP/ml (+ATA) (Figure 3a ). The titers of KOS strain in HEK-293 cells, on the other hand, even dropped, from 1.1 ± 0.9 × 10 8 DRP/ml (−ATA) to 5.5 ± 4.9 × 10 7 DRP/ml (+ATA), but according analysis of variance, the difference was not significant (P > 0.05; n = 4) (Figure 3a ). In a larger study (n = 10) conducted in six-well plates, two-way analysis of variance and Sidak's multiple comparison test have shown that ATA significantly increased (**P < 0.01; n = 10) ICP27-deficient vector rHSV-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (d27-GFP) DRP/ml titers in V27 cells, from 5.4 ± 2.7 × 10 7 to 3.3 ± 1.2 × 10 8 DRP/ml and that DRP/ml titers of wtHSV-1 McIntyre strain in HEK-293 cells have significantly increased from 1.1 ± 0.5 × 10 8 to 1.0 ± 0.3 × 10 9 DRP/ml (***P < 0.001) (Figure 3b ). Effect of residual ATA in HSV stocks on the production of rAAV virions Because our ultimate goal is rAAV production, we investigated whether the presence of ATA in rHSV-1 stocks would influence rAAV yields. The rAAV-GFP vector was produced by coinfection of rHSV-rep2/cap2 and rHSV-EGFP vectors in HEK-293 cells using rHSV-1 stocks not containing ATA, or rHSV-1 stocks prepared under ATA@step1 protocol (see Materials and Methods). The effect of residual ATA in rHSV-rep2/cap2 stock (~3 µmol/l) resulted in a small 1.3-fold (statistically significant) increase in rAAV titer to 3.8 × 10 10 ± 2.4 × 10 9 DRP/ml (**P < 0.01) when compared with the rAAV DRP/ml titer made by using naive rHSV-1 stocks, 2.8 × 10 10 ± 2.8 × 10 9 DRP/ml (n = 4). As shown in Figure 4 , ATA also slightly increased rAAV yield (DRP/cell) when 10 µmol/l ATA was spiked directly into HEK-293 cell media during the rHSV-1 coinfection step. This effect was not observed when the ATA concentrations were higher than 15 µmol/l.
