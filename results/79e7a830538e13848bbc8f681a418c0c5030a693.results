Group 1 consisted of 145 cats; seizures were reported for 63 cats and other neurological signs were reported for 82 cats. Of the cats, 44 were from low flea risk states (Colorado and Montana) and 101 were from high flea risk states (Arkansas, California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin). There was no difference in B henselae seroprevalence rates (P ¼ 0.0662) between cats with seizures (37 of 63 cats; 59%) and cats with other neurological diseases (35 of 82 cats; 43%). When the analysis was expanded to include age and risk of flea exposure by logistic regression, neither of these additional factors were significant (P > 0.05) and the effect of seropositivity was still not significant (P ¼ 0.0707). However, the median titers of cats with seizures (median 1:64; titer range 0e1:1024) were significantly greater (P ¼ 0.0227) than cats with other neurological signs (median 0; titer range 0e1:2048). Group 2 (clinically ill cats without neurological disease) consisted of 163 cats. Of the cats, 67 were from low flea risk states (Colorado, Montana, and New Mexico) and 96 were from high flea risk states (California, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin). In the first evaluation, group 2 cats had a greater seropositive rate than group 1 cats (Table 1 ; P ¼ 0.0153). When the analysis was expanded to include age and risk of flea exposure by logistic regression, neither of these additional factors influenced the seropositive rate within group (P > 0.05) and the effect of group was still significant (P ¼ 0.0026). Median titers of cats were not significantly different (P ¼ 0.5682) between group 1 (median 0; titer range 0e1:2048) and group 2 (median 1:64; titer range 0e1:4096). Group 3 (healthy cats) consisted of 97 cats. Of the cats, 53 were from low flea risk states (Colorado and Utah) and 44 were from high flea risk states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin). When group 1 cats were compared to group 3 cats, group was included in the statistical model as the covariate instead of neurological manifestations. In the first evaluation, group 3 cats had a greater seropositive rate than group 1 cats (Table 1 ; P ¼ 0.0022). When the analysis was expanded to include age and risk of flea exposure (logistic regression), neither of these additional factors influenced the seropositive rate within group (P > 0.05) and the effect of group was still significant (P ¼ 0.0001). Median titers of cats were significantly different (P ¼ 0.0411) between groups with group 3 titers (median 64; titer range 0e1:8192) being greater than those for group 1 (median 0; titer range 0e1:2048).
