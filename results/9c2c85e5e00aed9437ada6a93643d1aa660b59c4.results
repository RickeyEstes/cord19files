A total of 2,738 malaria cases were identified in Zhejiang Province from 2005 to 2014, of which 2,018 were male and 720 were female. Of note, only 7% (183/2,738) of malaria cases were indigenous and the other cases were all imported. As shown in Figure 1 Of all cases, 68% (1,865/2,738) of reported cases contracted Plasmodium vivax, 27% (731/2,738) of reported cases contracted P. falciparum, and two cases contracted P. malariae, which were imported from Nigeria and Libya, respectively ( Table 1) . Because of the lack of diagnostic test in some counties before 2009, 140 cases were unclassified. Malaria cases were reported in every month; the majority (88%) of malaria cases during 2005-2011 occurred yearly between May and October ( Figure 2 ). However, the number of malaria cases of different months during 2012-2014 was similar. The median age of reported malaria cases was 33 (range: 1-84 years) and 1,892 (69%) cases occurred in persons aged 20-50 years ( Figure 3 ). Migrant laborers, farmers, businessmen, *Address correspondence to Wei Ruan, Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Binsheng Road 3399, Hangzhou 310051, China. E-mail: zjcdcrw@126.com and urban workers constituted 72% (1,965/2,738) of malaria cases ( Figure 4) . Moreover, the proportion of businessmen increased and the proportion of migrant laborers decreased in recent years. Malaria cases were reported in all 11 cities of Zhejiang Province from 2005 to 2014. However, malaria cases from Ningbo, Jinhua, Taizhou, Wenzhou, and Hangzhou accounted for 79% of cases, and these five cities reported 582, 494, 425, 345, and 308 malaria cases, respectively ( Figure 5 ). From 2005 to 2009, no information about the origins of imported cases was investigated, but these detailed data were collected from 2010 to 2014. Among 808 imported cases, 626 cases were from Africa, 117 from Asia, 59 from Chinese provinces, and only six cases from countries of other continents (Table 2) . Nigeria, Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Congo, and Cameron were the dominant origins of imported cases. Anhui Province where malaria was prevalent was the main origin of imported cases within China. The median time from illness onset to confirmation of all cases was 5 days (IQRs: 3-8 days; range: 0-332 days). In addition, the median time from illness onset to confirmation decreased from 2005 to 2014 as shown in Table 3 .
