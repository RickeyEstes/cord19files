We fit the weekly TCDC lab-confirmed case data by strain to the Richards model to pinpoint waves of circulating influenza strains in Taiwan during 2008-2012 (Fig 1) . The list of waves that are found to be statistically significant for each set of the influenza subtype data, along with the estimated turning point and effective reproduction number R with 95% confidence intervals (CI) obtained for each wave, are given in chronological order in Table 2 . For computation of the reproduction number, we use a generation time of T = 1.9/7 (95% CI: 1.30/ 7~2.71/7) which was obtained for the 2009 pH1N1 influenza pandemic [30] since the 2009 pH1N1 virus was found to be not significantly different from seasonal influenza in its transmissibility, although longer generation time has also been reported (see, e.g., [31] ). Note that the 95% CIs for r and t i , taken from SAS output, are measures of uncertainty for the nonlinear least-squared estimation, while the 95% CI for R 0 is computed, via the variances of r, also given in SAS output, and of T. To further elucidate the temporally varying nature of the waves of circulating influenza strains, we illustrate the timeline of the waves in Fig 2. For clarity, we group the waves into three groups: B, H3/AH3N2, and AH1/A(H1N1)pdm09. To illustrate the temporal changes in transmissibility of the strains, we provide the reproduction numbers of circulating influenza strains in timelines (Fig 3) . Fig 4 provides the percentage of each influenza strain among all lab-confirmed positive tests reported to Taiwan CDC by the contracted laboratories each week, which brings to light the dominating strain(s) during any time period.
