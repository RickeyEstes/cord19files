From 1990 through 2010, there was a decline in age-specific mortality in KSA ( Figure 1 ). The greatest reductions in all-cause mortality were among males aged less than 1 year (51%). Men aged 80 years or older had an increase in mortality (14%). During the same time, life expectancy increased from 72.5 to 75.0 for men and from 76.3 to 79.9 for women ( Figure 2 ). During the same time, healthy life expectancy increased from 61.8 to 63.9 for men and from 63.5 to 66.6 for women. Infant mortality declined from 23.8 per 1,000 to 11.9 per 1,000, and maternal mortality ratios declined from 30.0 to 15.0 per 100,000 live births. The main cause of death in 1990 was ischemic heart disease (IHD), accounting for 16.04% of total mortality (Table 1) . Road traffic injuries were the third leading cause of death in 2010, accounting for 11.75% of total mortality. The patterns in causes of death were different for males and females throughout the study period.
