Active monomer design. By comparing the active protomer (protomer A) of the wild-type SARS-3CLpro with both the inactive protomer (protomer B) of the wild-type SARS-3CLpro (PDB Code 1UK2) 6 and the inactive monomer R298A (PDB Code 2QCY) 12 , we found that the most distinguishable differences between the active and inactive structures were in the conformational changes of residues Ser139-Phe140-Leu141. Ser139-Phe140-Leu141 is the part of the oxyanion loop that participates in maintaining the correct conformation of the S1 subsite in the active enzyme. In contrast, in inactive enzymes, this short peptide forms a short 3 10 -helix that twists the oxyanion hole of the S1 subsite ( Fig. 1 ). This same conformational change is also observed in the collapsed 3CLpro of avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV-3CLpro) 5 . Formation of a 3 10 -helix in inactive structures implies that disruption of this 3 10 -helix will make the structure more flexible, and may produce an active monomer. Among the three residues in the 3 10 -helix, Leu141 is a strong helix former 18, 19 . We hypothesized that changing Leu141 to another residue with a lower helical tendency and strong β -structure tendency may destroy the 3 10 -helix. In the present work, we mutated Leu141 to Thr141, a residue with strong β -structure and low helix tendency. Simultaneously, we mutated Gly11, Arg298, and Gln299, which are residues at the dimer interface, to Ala 8, 11, 15 to generate a stable monomeric protein. The triple-mutant G11A/R298A/Q299A (GRQ) was confirmed to be a monomer, and the tetra-mutant G11A/L141T/R298A/ Q299A (GLRQ) was a monomer with enzyme activity as designed. Enzyme Activity of GLRQ. Both GRQ and GLRQ were incubated with a pNA substrate (Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA) at a concentration of 200 μ M at 37 °C. GRQ exhibited no enzyme activity. After introducing L141T, however, GLRQ was shown to have regained hydrolytic activity (Fig. 2) . To determine the amount of activity recovered in GLRQ, the reaction rates of equal amounts of GLRQ and wild-type 3CLpro (as a control) were measured (Fig. S1 ). Compared with 3CLpro, GLRQ regained 2% of proteolysis activity. We derived k cat and K m of GLRQ using the Lineweaver-Burk plot with a fixed enzyme concentration and a series of substrate concentrations. K m of GLRQ was 0.68 ± 0.04 mM and k cat was 0.09 ± 0.001 min −1 . In comparison, K m is 0.98 ± 0.36 mM and k cat is 6.4 ± 2.0 min −1 in the wild-type enzyme 20 . Thus, GLRQ and 3CLpro have similar binding affinity, whereas catalytic activity is 70 times lower and k cat /K m is 50 times lower in GLRQ compared with the wild-type enzyme. This finding demonstrates that introducing Thr at position 141 to disrupt the 3 10 -helix can indeed recover proteolysis activity in GLRQ. Oligomeric state of GLRQ. Analytical gel filtration and sedimentation velocity methods were used to check whether both the GRQ and GLRQ mutants maintain monomer structure. The same concentration of wild-type 3CLpro served as a control. The Superdex 75 HR 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was used for gel filtration analysis. A standard calibration curve was fitted according to the retention volume of known markers (Supplemental Table S1 , Fig. S2 ). GRQ and GLRQ appeared as a single peak, and the maximum retention volume did not change with the concentration, indicating that only one species was present in solution. For 3CLpro, the peak shifted to the high molecular weight side as the concentration increased, indicating the existence of subunit exchange (Fig. 3) . The retention volumes for GRQ and GLRQ were all approximately 12 ml at both high and low concentrations, corresponding to the molecular weight of a monomer (Table S2) . A sedimentation velocity experiment was conducted at 20 °C in PBS with 1 mg/ml concentrations for 3CLpro, GRQ, and GLRQ to further verify the oligomeric state of the GLRQ mutant. A single peak was observed for both GRQ and GLRQ at approximately 2.7 s (Fig. 4) , which corresponds to a monomer 10 . Two peaks were observed at the monomer and dimer positions, respectively, consistent with previous reports 10, 21 . Previous studies have shown that dimer formation can be induced or enhanced by either substrate or substrate-analogue (5f) binding 21, 22 . 5f has a similar binding pattern to the enzyme as the substrate, and was used as a probe to test whether the active pocket of the SARS-3CLpro adopts the correct conformation. Under our experimental condition, 18.5 μ M GLRQ was totally inhibited by 160 μ M 5f (Supplemental Fig. S3 ), which implies that the substrate binding pocket of the GLRQ mutant maintains the active conformation. In addition, when 10 μ M 5f was incubated with 5 μ M GLRQ in PBS and analysed using the sedimentation velocity experiment described above, no peaks were induced except for the monomer peak (Supplemental Fig. S4 ). This finding further supports that the GLRQ mutant is monomeric in solution and does not dimerize in the presence of the substrate or its analogue.
