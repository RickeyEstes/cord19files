We previously found that rhMBL bound Ebola (Zaire) and Marburg (Musoke) envelope GPs [2] . RhMBL effectively blocked Ebola GP interactions with DC-SIGN, and HIV particles lacking gp120/gp41 pseudotyped with Ebola or Marburg GPs were neutralized by the lectin complement pathway [2] . To develop an in vivo test of rhMBL effectiveness, we determined that 100 ng/mL of rhMBL was the minimum concentration needed to inhibit >90% infectivity of HepG2 cells using Ebola GP pseudotyped lentiviral particles and to inhibit >90% infectivity of Vero E6 cells using recombinant Ebola Zaire virus (Mayinga strain)-eGFP (data not shown). We had previously found that a single intraperitoneal dose of 75 lg of rhMBL reconstituted the lectin complement pathway in MBL-knockout mice [1] . We compared the pharmacokinetic parameters (Table 1) Intraperitoneal administration of 100 pfu of native Ebola Zaire virus (3000 3 LD 50 ) is uniformly fatal in mice. Treatment with 75 lg of rhMBL per dose every 12 hours failed to protect mice from that virus inoculum. Therefore, we increased rhMBL to 350 lg administered every 12 hours for 10 days starting either 1 hour before or 12 hours after Ebola virus challenge ( Figure 1A and 1B). When treatment was started 1 hour before virus infection, the supraphysiological dose increased survival to . 40% of mice in several trials ( Figure 1A) . We then started treatment 12 hours after viral infection. We compared survival in wild-type and complement component 3 (C3)-deficient mice as the inhibitory effects of MBL on Ebola virus are mediated by complement in cell culture [2] . Once again we saw an increase in survival from 0% to .40% in rhMBL-treated mice, and survival was dependent on an intact complement pathway, since C3deficient mice did not survive ( Figure 1B ). All inoculated mice showed signs of infection according to standardized observation scores and weight loss, and surviving mice had detectable Ebola virus-specific antibodies 28 days after infection (data not shown). We monitored the effect of treatment started 12 hours after infection on a variety of laboratory indices. Mean white blood cell counts were 9100 cells/mL in MBL-treated mice (n 5 5) compared with 4525 cells/mL on day 7 after infection in the surviving sham-treated mice (n 5 4). Average lymphocyte counts were also higher in MBL-treated mice compared with controls (5500 cells/mL vs 2800 cells/mL, respectively). A similar trend was seen for platelet counts, which averaged 726,000 cells/ mL in the treatment group and 239,000 cells/mL in the controls. These differences were statistically significant for platelet counts on day 5 (672,000 cells/mL vs 322,000 cells/mL, P 5 .014; Figure 1C ). In a separate experiment, spleens were harvested on day 5 after infection (4 sham-treated and 4 MBL-treated mice). Constituent cell populations were assayed by flow cytometry. Numbers of splenic CD3 2 CD19 1 cells (B lymphocytes) and CD11b 1 granulocytes were higher in MBL-treated mice (89.2% vs 85.1%, P 5 .019; 17.6% vs 12.8%, P 5 .04, respectively). The RNA viral loads as determined by RT-PCR in blood, liver, and spleen 5 days after infection were similar in sham-and rhMBL-treated mice (P . .05). Virus titers in blood were generally lower on days 1 and 3 in rhMBL-treated mice as determined by plaque assays (P . .05; Figure 1D ). Of 23 cytokines and chemokines tested in serum, liver, and spleen on day 5 after inoculation, lower values (fluorescence intensity units) for interleukin (IL)-1b (170 vs 253, P 5 .07), IL-5 (89 vs 112, P 5 .03), IL-10 (379 vs 518, P 5 .004), IL-13 (264 vs 384, P 5 .008), and IL-17 (120 vs 174, P 5 .028) were found in liver homogenates from rhMBL-treated mice ( Figure  1E ). We tested protective immunity in 5 seropositive mice that survived initial infection by rechallenging them with native Ebola virus 28 days after initial infection. It is noteworthy that all MBL-treated survivors also survived the second viral challenge. Similar or higher immunoglobulin G, A, and M antibody titers were seen 28 days after the second challenge with the virus ( Figure 1F ).
