One hundred crude methanolic extracts of plants, 96 of which were used medicinally by British Columbian native peoples were screened for antiviral activity against seven viruses. The botanical names of the plants tested are listed alphabetically by genus in Table 1 . Twelve plant extracts each demonstrated some antiviral activity against one virus. Scores of the degrees of inhibition of virus-induced Icytopathic effects caused by treatment with these extracts are presented in Table 2 . Results for vaccinia virus and VSV are not shown as none of the plant extracts were observed to inhibit the cellular cytopathology induced by these virus.es at the extract dilutions used.
