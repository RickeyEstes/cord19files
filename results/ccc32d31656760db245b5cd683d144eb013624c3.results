Trypanosomosis drastically delays the ongoing development of CIA As our group already reported that T. brucei infection alters B cell homeostasis, we investigated if trypanosomosis was also able to modulate the course of B cell-mediated CIA in DBA/1 prone mice [14, 17] . In order to avoid any interference between the parasite and the priming of the anti-CII immune response, mice were infected with T. brucei two weeks post-immunization with CII emulsified in CFA. The results demonstrated a significant delay in CIA development in the infected group, which is characterized by a significant lower mean of arthritic lesion score at day 42 ( Fig 1A) . Inflamed limb pictures taken at the same time points clearly confirmed the protective effect of T. brucei infection on the development of CIA (Fig 1B) . A delay in the incidence of arthritis defined by the number of arthritic limbs per mouse is also observed (Fig 1C) . Trypanosome infected DBA/1 prone mice started to succumb from uncontrolled parasitemia from 25 days post-infection (approximately 40 days post-immunization) onwards (Fig 1D and 1E ). Therefore we could not investigate CIA development in this particular group at a later time point. Together, these results demonstrate that trypanosomosis significantly delays the development of CIA in DBA/1 prone mice.
