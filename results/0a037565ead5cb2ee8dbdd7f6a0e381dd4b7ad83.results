Tissues sections from a total of 10 juvenile and 10 adult LBBs were subjected to lectin histochemistry for the detection of influenza virus receptors. No differences in SA receptor distribution between the juvenile and adult LBBs were found. Co-expression of both SA α2,3-Gal and SA α2,6-Gal receptors in LBB respiratory tract. Abundant co-expression of avian (SA α2,3-Gal) and human (SA α2,6-Gal) type influenza receptors was found throughout the LBB respiratory tract (Fig. 1) . The relative abundance of avian and human type influenza receptors were distinctly different in the upper and lower airway of LBB. While SA α2,3-Gal receptors were predominant on the mucosal lining of the trachea (Fig. 1A) , predominance of SA α2,6-Gal receptors was found in the alveolar epithelium, alveolar duct and visceral pleura of the lung (Fig. 1B) . Further, abundant expression of SA α2,6-Gal receptors was found in the lamina propria and submucosa of the tracheal tissue (Fig. 1A ).
