A total of 52 patients who attended with wheezing attack, at the ages of 12---60 months with a history of three or more wheezing attacks in the last year, and 54 healthy children were included in the study. Vitamin D level could not be studied due to insufficient blood sample taken of a child in the patient group and therefore was excluded from the evaluations related to vitamin D. Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics of patient and control groups. There was no significant difference in sociodemographic data of the patient and control groups (p > 0.05). Table 2 shows the comparison of patient and control group in terms of wheezing risk factors. The cesarean delivery rate was significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group (p = 0.011). The rate of breastfeeding for six months or less was found to be significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group (p = 0.020). The history of allergic disease in first-degree relatives was significantly higher in the patient group compared to the controls (p = 0.015). Exposure to cigarette smoke was significantly higher in the patient group than the control group (p = 0.012). The humidity of the air of the house in the patient group was significantly higher than the controls (p = 0.007). Comparison of vitamin D, Ca, P, ALP and PTH levels of the patient and control groups are given in Table 3 . Vitamin D levels were significantly lower in the patient group compared to the control group (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the patient and control groups in terms of Ca, P, ALP and PTH levels (p > 0.05). Results of forward stepwise logistic regression analysis for predicting risk of wheezing are given in Table 4 . When the patient group was evaluated by means of attack severity, two patients (3.8%) had severe attacks and 50 patients (96.2%) had mild attacks. Due to the low number of patients with a severe attack, no statistical data could be studied between the attack severity and vitamin D. Table 5 shows the comparison of the levels of vitamin D with the factors that may indicate the severity of the wheezing attack. There was no significant difference in vitamin D levels between hospitalized and not hospitalized patients and who received and did not receive oxygen and steroid treatment during the wheezing attack (p > 0.05). There was no statistically significant correlation between oxygen saturation and vitamin D levels in wheezing attack (r = 0,062; p = 0.665). Thirty-eight (73%) of the children were infected by viruses. Rhinovirus was detected in 24 (63.2%) children, HRSV A/B was found in nine (23.7%), and human bocavirus was found in six (15.8%). One virus was detected in 24 (63.2%) of the children infected, 14 (36.8%) of them were coinfected. Four patients were coinfected with three and 10 with two viruses. Of the viral coinfections, rhinovirus and then HRSV A/B were the most frequently detected ones. The distribution of viruses detected is given in Table 6 . When the relationship between the presence of virus and vitamin D level was observed, 10 of 13 patients with vitamin D deficiency, eight of 13 patients with inadequacy and 19 of 25 patients with normal vitamin D levels were infected with at least one virus. No significant difference was found between vitamin D levels and the presence of a virus (p > 0.05). The average vitamin D level in patients infected with one virus was 19.65 ± 8.18 ng/ml and in patients with multiple viruses was 20.22 ± 7.89 ng/mL. No significant difference was found in vitamin D levels according to the numbers of the viruses infected (p = 0.84).
