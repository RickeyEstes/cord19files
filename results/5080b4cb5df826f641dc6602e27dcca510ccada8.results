Inhibitory activity of GL and its analogues. To evaluate the inhibitory activities of GL, GA and CBX against KAT2, we measured half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) and estimated inhibition constants (Ki). GL (IC 50 , 4.51 ± 0.20 μM; Ki, 10.42 ± 1.62 μM), GA (IC 50 , 6.96 ± 0.37 μM; Ki, 6.92 ± 0.60 μM) and CBX (IC 50 , 3.90 ± 0.37 μM; Ki, 4.11 ± 0.37 μM) showed high inhibitory activity against human KAT2 (Figs 3 and 4) . In investigations of the selectivity of GL, GA and CBX for KAT isoforms, all three compounds showed inhibitory activity against mouse KAT2, but none inhibited the other 3 KAT isozymes (Table 1) , indicating selectivity for KAT2. Inhibitory mechanisms of the compounds against human KAT2. To investigate inhibitory mechanisms of GL, GA and CBX, we measured KAT2 activity in the presence of varying KYN concentrations and inhibitory compounds at close to their IC 50 (GL, 4.5 μM; GA, 6.0 μM; CBX, 3.5 μM). Additionally, we then compared inhibitory properties of these compounds with those of the KAT2 inhibitor PF-04859989, which binds PLP irreversibly. PF-04859989 was used at its IC 50 value of 300 nM, as determined in our assays. Because PF-04859989 binds to PLP, maximum reaction rates (V max ) varied but the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m ) did not change (Fig. 4a ). In contrast, K m values for GL, GA and CBX changed with substrate concentrations, whereas respective V max values did not vary under these conditions (Fig. 4b-d) . These results showed that GL, GA and CBX do not bind PLP, but act as competitive inhibitors of KYN. Computational docking of GL and its analogues to KAT2. Three-dimensional structures of KAT2-ligand complexes were obtained using the docking calculations shown in Fig. 5 . For comparison, we also present a crystal structure from the protein data bank (PDB; PDB ID, 2R2N) in Fig. 5a . All ligands were located in the ligand-binding pocket of two KAT2 molecules. To elucidate the interactions between KAT2 and these ligands, we magnified the structures of ligand-binding pockets (Fig. 6) , and identified residues that are involved www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ in hydrogen-bond formation and stacking, as shown in Fig. 7 . In these figures, the subunits A and B are shown in green and cyan, respectively. In the crystal structure of 2R2N, KYN forms hydrogen bonds with Asn202(B) and Arg399(B) (Figs 6a and 7a) , and the binding structure is stabilised by a π-π interactions between the aromatic ring of KYN and the Tyr74(A) side chain. Although GL formed a hydrogen bond with Ser77(A), no hydrogen bonds were observed between GL and Asn202(B) or Arg399(B) (Figs 6b and 7b ). Yet CH-π stacking interactions with Tyr74(A) may stabilise the binding structure. The hydrophobic moiety of GL was located on hydrophobic surfaces comprising Leu40(A), Tyr74(A), Pro76(A) and Gln73(A) and the carbohydrate chain of GL was located outside of the ligand-binding pocket. Similarly, the hydrophobic moiety of GA was located on the hydrophobic surface of Leu40(A), Tyr74(A), Pro76(A) and Gln73(A) (Fig. 6c) , and the binding structure of GA favours stabilisation by CH-π stacking interactions with Tyr74(A) (Fig. 7c) . Although GA formed no hydrogen bonds with Asn202(B), Arg399(B) or Ser77(A), hydrogen bonds with Gly39(A) and Tyr142(B) were observed. The docking pose of CBX, which had a similar IC 50 value to that of GL, was also similar to that of GL (Figs 6d and 7d) . Moreover, the residues required for stabilisation of ligand binding by hydrophobic effects and stacking interactions were conserved among GL and its analogues ( Table 2 ). In particular, Tyr74 is considered one of the most important residues for ligand binding.
