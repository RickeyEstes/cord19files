The study included a total of 992 sera representing seven selected districts of Southern Punjab, Pakistan for surveillance for brucellosis, PPRV and BTV (Fig. 1) . Overall, a varying rate of prevalence was observed for each of the study pathogen in the tested animals. Seroprevalence was found to be 6.65% (95% CI: 5.22-8.43) for brucellosis, 19.46% (95% CI: 17.07-22.09) for PPR, while it was found to be 70.26% (95% CI: 67.29-73.07) for BT. Rate of seroprevalence of brucellosis was more in camels originating from district Rajan Pur (13.16%, 95% CI: 8.42-19.83), while it was least in camels from district RY Khan (3.12%, 95% CI: 1.47-6.34). The proportion of seropositivity for PPR was more in camels originating from district RY Khan (35.04%, 95% CI: 29.25-41.29), whereas it was the least in camels from Rajan Pur district (5.26%, 95% CI: 2.47-10.45). None of the camels was seropositive from district Muzaffar Garh for both of brucellosis and PPR. Similarly, for bluetongue, all the tested animals were seropositive in Muzaffar Garh (100%, 95% CI: 77.08-100.0), while it was least in camels from district Rajan Pur (22.37%, 95% CI: 16.19-29.98) ( Table 1) . For seroprevalence to more than one pathogen, a maximum rate of seropositivity was observed for bluetongue and PPR infection (n = 140, 14%, 95% CI: 12.08-16.42), followed by bluetongue and brucellosis (n = 34, 4%, CI: 2.47-4.75), and PPR and brucellosis (n = 10, 1.0%, CI: 0.5-1.85). Percent positivity indicating a cumulative exposure to brucellosis, PPR and bluetongue infection was observed exclusively in 1.0% of the studied camel population (n = 10, CI: 0.5-1.85) (Fig. 2) . A district-wise distribution of percent positivity of each of the study pathogen either alone or cumulatively is indicated in the Fig. 1 . The tested sera representing 74 herds of camels were distributed from the selected districts as follows: district Taunsa (n = 17) RY Khan (n = 16), DG Khan (n = 15), Rajanpur (n = 11), Multan (n = 10), Bahawalpur (n = 3) and Muzaffar Garh (n = 2). Most herds were seropositive to bluetongue (n = 71, 95.95%, CI: 87.82-98.94), followed by PPR (n = 54, 72.97%, 95 CI: 61.19-82.33) and brucellosis (n = 31, 41.89%, 95% CI: 31.32-53.26). Herd-based prevalence for bluetongue was high (100%) in each of the district Bahawalpur (n = 3), DG Khan (n = 15), Multan (n = 10), Muzaffar Garh (n = 2), RY Khan (n = 16) and Taunsa (n = 17), while it was least (72.73%) in district Rajan Pur (n = 8). Herd-based prevalence for PPRV infection was high (100%) in each of the district Bahawalpur (n = 3), and RY Khan (n = 16), whereas it was least (36.35%) in district Rajan Pur (n = 4). Similarly, herd-based prevalence for brucellosis was high (63.64%) in district Rajan Pur (n = 7), while it was least (33.33%) in district Bahawalpur (n = 1). None of the herds was seropositive from district Muzaffar Garh for both of PPR and brucellosis (Table 2) . Univariate analysis was used to assess an association between different categorical variables and occurrence of seropositivity to each of the studied pathogens in camels. Excluding a few of the variables for each of the pathogen, all showed an initial association at p < 0.20 with the exposure to specific pathogen indicated by the seroprevalence. These few variables included feeding system (p = 0.888) and farmer's education (p = 0.585) for brucellosis, and gender (p = 0.399), type of farming (p = 0.521) and age group (p = 0.503) for PPR. Notably, all variables showed significant association with the occurrence of bluetongue infection (Table 3) . However, when further analyzed through M.Z. Shabbir, et al. Acta Tropica 205 (2020) 105435 multivariate logistic regression analysis, pre-determined initial association became degenerative and only a few of the variables had a significant association with the occurrence of seropositivity in camels. The odds of occurrence of seropositivity in brucellosis was more significant (p < 0.01) in animals with poor body condition (OR = 3.54, 95% CI: 1.92-6.54) and of Desi breed (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.09-4.40). For PPR, the odds of occurrence of seropositivity were more significant (p < 0.01) in animals that had mixed feeding system (OR = 2.75, 95% CI: 1. 79-4.22) . Similarly, the odds of BT occurrence were more significant (p < 0.01) in non-pregnant animals (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.86-5.63), intensive farming system (OR = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.56-4.29), Desi breed (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.28-4.03) and depending on farmer's education (OR = 3.17, 95% CI: 1.45-6.93) ( Table 4) . While genome-based identification and further subtyping of each of the study pathogen is concerned, only genome corresponding to Brucella spp. and BTV was identified. All the processed samples were found negative to genome corresponding to nucleoprotein gene of PPRV. Out of 74 camel herds, genome conforming to Brucella spp. and BT was detected among 19 (25.68%, 95% CI: 16.54-37.38) and 14 camel herds (18.92%, 95% CI: 11.09-30.04), respectively. Further multiplex-PCR based species identification revealed all of the Brucella spp. positive herds exclusively to be Brucella abortus. A maximum number of camel herds were positive from district Taunsa and Rajan pur each (n = 6, 8.11%, 95% CI: 3.34-17.43), followed by RY Khan (n = 4, 5.41%, 95% CI: 1.75-13.99) and Multan (n = 3, 4.05%, 95% CI: 1.05-12.18). Similarly, for BTV, a higher number of camel herds representing district Multan were found antigen positive (n = 8, 10.81%, 95% CI: 5.11-20.72), followed by Taunsa (n = 3, 4.05%, 95% CI: 1.05-12.18), Muzaffar Garh (n = 2, 2.70%, 95% CI: 0.47-10.30) and DG Khan (n = 1, 1.35%, 95% CI: 0.07-8.32). BTV serotype distribution was found to be district-specific, where serotypes 8 and 11 were detected from camel herds in district Multan, while serotypes 1 and 8 were exclusively detected from camel herds originating from district DG Khan, Muzaffar Garh, and Taunsa, respectively. important for control and eradication of disease/s across disease endemic settings worldwide (Klepac et al., 2015) . Therefore, for a number of infectious diseases, time-to-time antigen and antibody detectionbased surveillance has previously been conducted in small and large ruminants in Pakistan. Nevertheless, except for a few studies on brucellosis in camels (Shahzad et al., 2017; Baloch et al., 2017) , there is an absolute paucity of data on surveillance of PPR and BT, and subsequent necessary interventions in terms of evidence-based decision making to ultimately improve veterinary and public health, the environment and the society. An integration of animal health surveillance into an economic framework has indicated no or a very limited economic value; however, when combined with decisions on interventions, surveillance contribute to disease mitigation and therefore justify the resources used (Howe et al., 2013) . This can fairly be evidenced for Foot and Mouth disease in Pakistan where disease control and eradication strategies are taken as top-priority by national and international organizations (FAO/ OIE). With this background understanding, we conducted pathogenand antibody-based surveillance for selected veterinary and public health pathogens in the camel population of Southern Punjab, Pakistan. An indirect antigen-antibody interaction (iELISA) was employed for the detection of anti-Brucella antibodies, while competitive ELISAs were used for the detection of antibodies for PPR and bluetongue. The used assays are highly efficient, sensitive and specific for each of the selected pathogens and are considered reliable for sero-surveillance of brucellosis, BT and PPR (Paweska et al., 2002 : Biteau-Coroller et al., 2006 Bodjo et al., 2018) . Overall, a high seroprevalence (70.26%) to BT followed by PPR (19.46%) and brucellosis (6.65%) was found in the targeted camel population of Southern Punjab, Pakistan. Such a high level of seroprevalence of these pathogens is not surprising because of the reported endemicity of the studied pathogens in livestock populations of the Punjab province Abubakar et al., 2010; Aziz-ul-Rahman et al., 2016 Shabbir et al., 2018; T. Sohail et al., 2019) . As can be evidenced from the annual reports of Livestock and Dairy Development department of the Punjab province (http://www. livestockpunjab.gov.pk/dashboard/lndd_punjab), a frequent occurrence of clinical cases of PPR and brucellosis in small and large ruminants are not uncommon, while for bluetongue, it is conceived to be sub-clinical. Since the camels are not included for any vaccination program for prevalent infectious pathogens in the country, particularly Note: The significant variable is italic.
