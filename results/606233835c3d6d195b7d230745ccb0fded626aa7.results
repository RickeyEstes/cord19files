To obtain a general profile of the case distribution, we first analyzed all the available cases during this COVID-19 outbreak. [16] As shown in Figure 1A , the number of cases remained stable from January 11 to January 15, 2020, and the number of new and cumulative cases increased rapidly after January 16. The first death was reported on January 10, and the number of deaths began to increase rapidly from January 17 onwards, with the cumulative number of deaths reaching 213 on January 30 [ Figure 1B ]. [6] After the nucleic acid assay became available, suspected cases waiting for laboratory confirmation could be diagnosed rapidly. [17] After January 19, the number of suspected cases increased rapidly, and about 40-50% of these suspected cases were then confirmed [ Figure 1C ]. Before January 19, the number of severe cases remained low, but they increased steadily from January 20 onwards [ Figure 1D ]. Because Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei province and the virus spread throughout the province quickly, we also analyzed the changes in number of cases in Hubei province. On January 9, 41 cases were first reported, and by January 30, 5806 cases had been reported, accounting for 59.91% (5806/9692) of the total cases in China [ Figure 1E ]. The cumulative number of deaths in Hubei province was 204, accounting for 95.77% (204/213) of the total deaths in China [ Figure 1F ]. These data indicated that both the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 disease were the highest in Hubei province. [18] Before January 16, cases were mainly reported in Hubei province. From January 17 onward, the outbreak spread to many provinces and the number of cases increased rapidly. Therefore, our spatial and temporal analyses used data from January 17 to January 30, 2020. The location of each case was extracted from official reports and mapped onto the national map at the city level using ArcGIS. Of the 362 cities, 307 (84.8%, 307/362) had reported cases. In general, the core outbreak area, Wuhan, and its surrounding cities had the highest number of cases, followed by cities with a high population that are transportation hubs. Spatial distribution was then analyzed with a Bayesian model using WinBUGS. After nearly 100,000 iterations, the model converged successfully. After the model converged, it was iterated another 110,000 times to obtain parameter estimations. Generally, a ratio close to 1 indicates that the two chain iterative sequences are close, and that the model has a good convergence and is stable [ Figure 2A ]. Using the established model and parameters, hot and cold spots were identified. The results showed that Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hainan, and Taiwan were hot spots, and Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Chongqing, Hunan, and Guangxi were secondary hot spots. Generally, hot spots clustered in the midwest, and cold spots clustered in the southeast [ Figure   2B ]. The overall temporal trend was calculated using the time risk model (exp(b 0t *+v t )), which described the general incidence risk according to time between January 16 and January 30, 2020. Through the analysis, b 0 was estimated to be 0.4604, that is, the disease risk on the following day was found to be approximately 1.585 times higher than that on the previous day. The relative risk according to time increased steadily from January 20 onward and the upward trend continued as of January 30 [ Figure 2C ], indicating that the number of cases nationwide is on the rise. As shown in Figure 2D Figure 2D ]. Since Hubei province had the highest number of cases, we analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution in different cities of Hubei province. Wuhan had the highest number of cases, followed by Huanggang and Xiaogan city. Suizhou, Jingmen, and Xianning were part of the second group with a high number of cases. The spatial convergence analysis had 100,000 iterations [ Figure 3A ]. Hot spots were identified in the east regions and cold spots were identified in the west regions [ Figure 3B ]. The overall temporal trend in the change in the number of cases was calculated using the model. The average time trend coefficient b 0 was estimated to be 0.6727, indicating the time risk (occurrence probability in time) on the following day was 1.960 times higher than that on the previous day, suggesting that the daily number of cases in Hubei province is on the rise [ Figure 3C ]. Xiangyang, Suizhou, Yichang, and Ezhou showed the highest increase rates, and Shiyan, Shennongjia, Xiaogan and Huangshi showed relatively high increase rates [ Figure 3D ]. Other cities had a growth slower than the overall growth in the province [Supplementary The outbreak started from Wuhan, and nearly all early cases were derived from this city, which is located in Hubei province. Because the outbreak occurred just before the Spring Festival, large-scale population migration during this period influenced the subsequent epidemic. From January 1 to January 23, 2020, the population that migrated out of Wuhan city and Hubei province increased steadily, peaking on January 21 and 22 [ Figure 4A ]. Wuhan city was under lockdown on Jan 23, and after that, population migration was greatly inhibited. As observed in 2019, high population migration occurred on January 31; the timely city lockdown prevented a subsequent outbreak burst. We analyzed the migration into and out of Wuhan city and Hubei province. The top targets for emigration included Henan and Hunan provinces [ Figure 4B ]. More people migrated out of Wuhan than into the city [ Figure 4C ]. To analyze the correlation between the number of cases and the emigration in Wuhan city and Hubei province, population migration data were collected from Baidu Qianxi. The correlation coefficient between the provincial number of cases and emigration from Hubei province was 0.719 [ Figure 4D ] However, cities with high immigration were relatively scattered. Chongqing experienced the highest immigration, accounting for 1.50% of the total number of immigrants [ Figure 4 ]. As immigrants will be traveling back to work after the Spring Festival, the cities showing high "emigration" may be at a high risk of another wave of new cases owing to the return of the migrants.
