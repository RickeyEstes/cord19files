PH peptide fused to GFP form particles We developed a universal system to produce fusion proteins using as template the first 110 amino acids from AcMNPV polyhedrin protein. A transfer plasmid containing the strong polyhedrin promoter drives the expression of the PH followed by a poly-linker [29] , which allows the insertion of any sequence to generate the fusion protein ( Fig. 1a) . In this particular case we introduced the sequence from the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to produce the fusion protein PH (1-110) GFP [28] . This plasmid was utilized to produce recombinant baculovirus expressing the fusion protein in Sf9 insect cells. Sf9 insect cells infected with our recombinant baculovirus carrying the gene to expressed the fusion protein PH GFP were sonicated to release the particles. Particles were centrifuged at low speed and the protein purified in this manner was subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1b) . As control we utilized a pure soluble form of GFP. As illustrated in the figure, a simple centrifugation results in highly pure PH GFP protein, showing that the major component is the expected protein. Figure 1c illustrates an example of a Sf9 insect cells expressing PH GFP visualized by confocal microscopy (for a 3D reconstruction of the particles please refer to Additional file 1: Video S1). Notice that all particles were contained within the nucleus (labeled with DAPI in blue). Electron microscopy (transmission electron microscopy in panel D and scanning electron microscopy in E) shows that the PH (1-110) GFP particles are polydisperse, formed micro and nanoparticles. A capillary electroforesis analysis indicates that over 80% of the protein content is PH GFP (see the Additional file 2).
