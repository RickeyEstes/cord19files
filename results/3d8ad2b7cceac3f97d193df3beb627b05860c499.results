Humoral immune responses. The immunogenicity of the two formulations of DNA vaccine was investigated in pigs. As shown in Fig. 1A , anti-PRRSV GP5-specific antibodies in pigs vaccinated with pcDNA3.1-Syn-ORF5, pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5, BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 or commercial vaccine JXA1-R could be detected by ELISA at 14 dpi, and increased following a booster inoculation. At 14 and 28 dpi, no detectable GP5-specific antibodies were observed in pigs immunized with PBS. And at 35 dpi, BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 induced significantly higher GP5-specific antibody titers compared with pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 (P = 0.0269) or PBS (P = 0.0479). At each sampling point, there was no significant difference in the level of GP5 antibody between the group immunized with the BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 construct and JXA1-R. However, the titers of GP5 antibody in animals immunized with JXA1-R were significant higher than in those immunized with the pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5 or pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 construct at 14, 28, 35 and 42 days post inoculation (dpi) (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). The neutralization capacity of sera from pigs was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 1B , PRRSV-specific neutralizing antibodies in pigs vaccinated with pcDNA3.1-SynORF5, pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5, BPEI/ PLGA-SynORF5 or commercial vaccine JXA1-R were detected on the 14 th day after primary immunization and elevated by the 28 th day. Meanwhile, no neutralizing antibodies (< 1:2) against HP-PRRSV strain JSKM were detected in the PBS control group on the 14 th or 28 th days. Only at 14 dpi, was there a significant difference in the titer of neutralizing antibodies between the groups immunized with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5 and JXA1-R (P = 0.0011). Lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine detection in pigs. At 28 and 42 dpi, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and re-stimulated in vitro with purified PRRSV (20 μ g/mL) to analyze cellular immune responses. As shown in Fig. 1C , at 28 and 42 dpi, there was no significant difference in lymphocyte proliferative responses among the groups immunized with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5 or BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 constructs, or JXA1-R (P > 0.05). At 28 and 42 dpi, the stimulation index (SI) detected in the groups immunized with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5 or BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 constructs, or JXA1-R were numerically higher than the group vaccinated with PBS, but the differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). To profile the cytokine levels induced by the DNA plasmids, IFN-γ secretion in splenocytes restimulated with PRRSV protein was measured by ELISA. As depicted in Fig. 1D , at 28 and 42 dpi, there were no significant difference in the level of IFN-γ production among the groups immunized with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5 or BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 constructs, and JXA1-R (P > 0.05). And at 42 dpi, the IFN-γ production induced by BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 was significantly higher than that induced by pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 (P = 0.0105). At 28 and 42 dpi, the production of IFN-γ in the control group was the lowest one when compared with other vaccinated groups, and the differences were significant (P < 0.01 or P < 0.001). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was also performed to analyze the level of Th1 cytokine IFN-γ mRNA expression in the restimulated splenocytes. Consistent with the results of the IFN-γ ELISA assay, at 28 and 42 dpi, there were no significant difference in the level of IFN-γ mRNA expression among the groups immunized with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5 or BPEI/ PLGA-SynORF5 constructs, and JXA1-R (P > 0.05). And significant differences could be observed between the control group and other vaccinated groups (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 or P < 0.001) (Fig. 1E ). CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell subtype assays. Lymphocytes were isolated at 14, 28, 35 and 42 dpi, and analyzed for CD3 + CD4 + and CD3 + CD8 + T lymphocytes by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2 , all prepared formulations of DNA vaccine induced higher levels of CD3 + CD4 + and CD3 + CD8 + T cells after primary immunization. The percentage of CD3 + CD4 + T cells in the BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 group was significantly higher compared with the JXA1-R-vaccinated group at 28 dpi (P = 0.0007). And significant differences in the level of CD3 + CD8 + T cells could be observed between BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 and JXA1-R groups at 35 and 42 dpi (P = 0.0331 and P = 0.0047). At 28 dpi, there were significant differences in the percentage of CD3 + CD4 + and CD3 + CD8 + T cells between the groups immunized with PBS and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 (P = 0.003 and P = 0.0019). After challenge, the number of CD3 + CD4 + T cells decreased at 35 dpi before increasing slightly at 42 dpi in the pcD-NA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5 and BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 groups, which was in opposition to the results observed in the JXA1-R group. By contrast, the number of CD3 + CD8 + T lymphocytes in the pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5, BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 and JXA1-R groups increased at 35 dpi. But at 42 dpi, it decreased to a similar level to that detected at 14 dpi. Protective efficiency against PRRSV challenge. Clinical signs and body temperature change. After challenge with virulent PRRSV, all pigs in the PBS control group had high rectal temperature (≥ 40 °C) ( Fig. 3 ). At 35, 38 and 39 dpi, the temperature of the control group was as high as 41 °C and pigs displayed a range of clinical signs, including inappetence, lethargy, rough hair coats, dyspnea, periocular edema, eyelid edema and light diarrhea. Though pigs in the pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5 group had high rectal temperature during 37-40 dpi, the mean temperature at each point was lower than the group immunized with pcDNA3.1-SynORF5, and presented with only slight depression in terms of clinical signs. Pigs in the BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 group had high rectal temperature (≥ 40 °C) only at 37 and 38 dpi, and no obvious clinical signs were observed in this group. Throughout the observation period after challenge, no pigs in the JXA1-R group had high rectal temperature (≥ 40 °C), and no obvious clinical signs were observed. Furthermore, scores for clinical signs in the BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 group were significantly lower than those in the PBS and pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 groups (P = 0.0045 and P = 0.0104) ( Table 1) . Viremia and tissue viral loads after challenge. During the 21 days after challenge with JSKM virus, pigs inoculated with BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 showed a lower level of viremia in blood than that of the control PBS group (P < 0.05), and no significant difference when compared with pigs in the JXA1-R-vaccinated group (P > 0.05) (Fig. 4 ). However, a similar level of viremia in blood was observed between the groups immunized with pcD-NA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-SynORF5. Even the similar level of viremia in blood was observed among the groups vaccinated with pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5, pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 and PBS at 31 and 33 dpi, at other sampling times, the level of viremia in blood of pigs inoculated pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 showed numerically lower than that receiving PBS. At the end of the study, all pigs were necropsied, and viral loads in different tissues were determined. Tissues collected from pigs inoculated with pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5 exhibited much higher viral loads in the heart, spleen, lung, and mandibular lymph node (Fig. 5) . However, in the liver, inguinal lymph node and mesenteric Although virus could still be detected in the tissues of all pigs at the end of the experiment, the viral loads in the heart, liver, lung, kidney, inguinal lymph node and mesenteric lymph node from pigs of the BPEI/ PLGA-SynORF5 group were significantly lower than those from PBS group. And there was no significant difference in viral loads of the sampling tissues between the groups immunized with BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 and JXA1-R. Pathological examination. At 49 dpi, the lungs were examined for gross lesions in all lobes. As shown in Fig. 6 , macroscopic lesions were mainly found to occur in the lungs of pigs receiving PBS. The gross pathological changes were characterized by interstitial pneumonia with consolidation and hemorrhage. Interstitial pneumonia with consolidation was observed in the pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 group. However, no obvious pathological changes in the lungs of pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5, BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 or JXA1-R-vaccinated piglets were observed. On histological examination, lung lesions in control pigs were characterized by thickened alveolar walls, extensive infiltration of macrophages, and increased amounts of bronchiole exudate. Interstitial pneumonitis could be observed in the pcDNA3.1-SynORF5 and pcDNA3.1-PoIFN-λ 1-SynORF5 groups, which was much milder than that in the PBS groups. However, this interstitial pneumonitis was largely absent in the BPEI/PLGA-SynORF5 and JXA1-R-vaccinated animals (Fig. 7 ).
