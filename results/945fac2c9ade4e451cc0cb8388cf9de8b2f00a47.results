RSV was detected in 243 (11%) of 2257 encounters (representing 241 of 1832 individuals) for acute respiratory illness. RSV cases were equally represented by RSV A (n = 121) and RSV B (n = 122). Of the 243 RSV cases, 23 (9%) had an additional viral target identified. Influenza was detected in 519 (23%), and 5 (<1%) were positive for both RSV and influenza. There were 2 individuals with an episode of RSV during 2 different seasons; none of the study participants had 2 RSV episodes in the same season. Among 1495 encounters negative for RSV and influenza by RT-PCR, the most common viral pathogens were coronavirus OC43, NL63, HKU1, 229E (n = 210; 14%), human metapneumovirus (n = 184; 12%), human rhinovirus (n = 135; 9%), and parainfluenza virus types 1-4 (n = 74; 5%); 873 (39%) encounters were negative for all viral targets in the multiplex RT-PCR assay. Patients with RT-PCR-confirmed RSV were similar to those with non-RSV respiratory illness in terms of age, gender, number of ED visits, and hospital admissions in the prior 12 months ( Table 1 ). The mean (median) interval from symptom onset to study enrollment and swab collection was 4.0 (4.0) days for RSV-negative patients and 4.4 (4.0) days for RSV-positive patients (P = .006). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was present in 15% of those with RSV illness, 18% of those with other viral respiratory infection, and 27% of those with no virus detected. RSV prevalence among adults with acute respiratory illness varied from a low of 5% Common symptoms of RSV illness included sore throat, sputum production, cough, fever/feverishness, dyspnea, myalgia, and wheezing ( Table 2 ). The most common diagnosis codes on the date of enrollment for RSV-positive patients were cough (45%), acute upper respiratory infection (21%), acute bronchitis (13%), acute sinusitis (12%), and bronchitis, unspecified (12%). Fifty-nine patients (24%) met the criteria for RSV-msLRTD during the enrollment encounter. The presence of RSV-msLRTD on enrollment was associated with a 3-fold higher risk of serious clinical outcome (relative risk, 2.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.83-4.88) ( Table 3) . RSV-positive participants with msLRTD during the enrollment encounter had a higher prevalence of COPD and congestive heart failure (CHF) and a greater number of medical encounters in the 28 days after enrollment (median, 1 vs 2; P = .05). The clinical outcome for RSV illness was serious in 47 (19%), moderate in 155 (64%), and mild in 41 (17%). Nearly half of serious outcomes occurred in patients ≥75 years of age with RSV infection (Table 3) .

The 13 ED visits included 5 patients who were admitted and 8 who were discharged. Among 155 patients with a moderate outcome, 144 (93%) received a new antibiotic prescription, 45 (29%) received bronchodilator or nebulizer treatment, and 28 (18%) received new systemic corticosteroid therapy; 5 (3%) were treated with an antiviral drug. The risk of a serious outcome was approximately double for patients with COPD or CHF compared with patients without these conditions (Table 3) . Thirty-two participants with RSV infection were admitted to a hospital within 28 days. Three of these hospitalizations were for noncardiopulmonary conditions that were unlikely to be related to RSV infection, including incarcerated hernia, small bowel obstruction, and acute gastrointestinal illness. These 3 hospital admissions were excluded from the serious outcome group. Fifteen of the remaining 29 hospitalized patients were enrolled in the inpatient setting. Four of those were directly admitted from an outpatient clinic, whereas the remaining 11 were admitted from the emergency department. Seven patients were enrolled during an outpatient encounter on the same day as their hospital admission, leaving 7 with hospital admissions 1 or more days after enrollment. The median interval from symptom onset to admission for RSV-positive hospitalized individuals was 4 days. Preexisting chronic diseases were common among hospitalized patients with RSV, including COPD (n = 9; 31%), CHF (n = 8; 28%), asthma (n = 8; 28%), and diabetes (n = 9; 31%) ( Table 4 ). Twenty-one (72%) received a discharge diagnosis of respiratory tract infection (eg, pneumonia, bronchitis, exacerbation of COPD). Only 1 patient was recognized to have RSV at the time of hospital discharge. The mean (SD) duration of hospital admission was 3.5 (2.5) days. Twenty-seven (93%) were discharged to home, and 2 (7%) were transferred to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility; there were no deaths within 28 days. The hospital course was uncomplicated for most patients. None required mechanical ventilation or ICU admission. Twenty-five (86%) received antimicrobials; 4 (16%) were treated with antiviral drugs. To estimate the number of hospitalized RSV cases that were not included in this analysis, we extracted hospital diagnosis codes for community cohort members during periods of study enrollment. We identified an additional 20 individuals ≥60 years of age who were hospitalized during study enrollment periods with a diagnosis code for RSV but were not enrolled in the influenza vaccine effectiveness study. The median community cohort size for adults aged ≥60 years was 13 807 (range, 12 142-13 807) for the seasons from 2006-2007 through 2015-2016. The overall seasonal incidence of medically attended RSV illness was 139 cases per 10 000 (95% CI, 122-160). The RSV incidence was 196 cases per 10 000 (95% CI, 162-236) among persons with chronic cardiopulmonary disease and 103 (95% CI, 85-125) among those without cardiopulmonary disease (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.89; 95% CI, 1.44-2.48). There was a significant decline in the incidence of medically attended RSV from 2006-2007 through 2015-2016 for the entire cohort (P = .003, chi-square test for trend) and for those with cardiopulmonary disease (P = .014, chi-square test for trend). The incidence of medically attended RSV was also higher in women compared with men (IRR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.09-1.95). The overall incidence rates of medically attended illness caused by RSV A and RSV B were nearly identical (IRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.75-1.35), although 1 or the other subtype was often dominant during a single season. The temporal trend in RSV incidence suggests an overall reduction among adults ≥60 years of age after the 2011-2012 season (Figure 1 ).

These conditions were considered unrelated to the preceding RSV infection. c Wilcoxon test was used for differences in medians. d P-values not shown for characteristics which contributed to the msLRTD case definition. We compared the peak month for RSV and influenza positives during each season among study participants ≥60 years old. In 7 seasons, the RSV peak and the influenza peak occurred in the same calendar month. In 2 seasons, the RSV peak occurred before the influenza peak, and in 3 seasons, the RSV peak occurred after the influenza peak. We also compared the peak month for RSV detection among study participants with the peak month based on local clinical testing of children <24 months. In 5 seasons, the peak calendar month was the same for enrolled adults ≥60 years old and children; the pediatric peak occurred 1-2 months earlier in 5 seasons and 1 month later in 2 seasons.
