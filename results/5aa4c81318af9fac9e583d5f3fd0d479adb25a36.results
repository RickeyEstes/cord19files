Results of the filtration capacity of the devices are shown in Figure 1 . The median reduction in particle count for a single surgical mask was 2.7. This increased to 5.5 with five surgical masks. The difference in particle count reduction in a given subject between one and five surgical masks ranged from 1.6 to 4.2. The best particle count reduction with five surgical masks was 13.7 times, which is less than the required value of 100 for a half face respirator.
