A total of 417 nasopharyngeal samples were screened. Among these, 35 tested positive for human coronaviruses, displaying Ct values ranging from 21 to 39. Upon molecular typing the 35 positives, 14 (37 %) belonged to alphacoronaviruses and 21 (63 %) were betacoronaviruses. Amongst the alphacoronaviruses, 4 were HCoV-229E and 10 were HCoV-NL63. Betacoronaviruses consisted of 12 HCoV-OC43 and 9 HCoV-HKU1 species. Thus the prevalence of the various HCoVs was 1 % for 229E, 2 % for NL63, 3 % OC43 and 2 % for HKU1. HCoV-OC43 was detected in most months in 2009-2011, but was not detected in 2012. The peak circulation was observed in February 2011 (Fig. 1) affecting patients aged 5 months to 5 years. It was most commonly detected in Central Kenya but never in Northern Kenya (Fig. 2) . HCoV-NL63 was detected mostly from samples obtained in Northern and Western Kenya and amongst patients aged 3 months to 1.75 years (Fig. 1) . HCoV-NL63 predominated from February to June 2009, then disappeared and resurfaced in September 2012. HCoV-HKU1 was detected all over Kenya, but mostly in the warmer Western and Coastal regions, with peaks observed in June 2009, November 2010, February 2011 and December 2012 ( Figs. 1 and 2) . It was detected in patients aged 4 months to 6 years. HCoV 229E was only detected in the Western Kenya, from patients aged 9 months to 2 years with peaks detected in July and December (Fig. 2) . The range of ages of the patients in the study was between 2 months and 67 years, with a mean age of 1.5 years and median of 1.67 years. Overall, 94 % of the HCoV were from patients aged <5 years and; 4555 % of the patients were female and 55 % were male. All the patients from whom HCoVs were detected presented with a cough and runny nose, with 50 % of the patients reporting nasal stuffiness. We observed five coinfections with a HCoV. These included two triple coinfection involving HKU1 with influenza A (H3N2) & human adenovirus and NL63 with influenza A (H3N2) & human adenovirus. Three double co-infections were observed. They included HKU1 with RSV, OC43 with influenza A (H1N1)pdm and OC43 with influenza B (Brisbane-like). All the co-infections, except that consisting of HKU1 & RSV presented with vomiting as a symptom. One patient with HCoV-NL63 presented with neurological symptoms. Amongst the patients positive for HCoV-OC43, 90 % presented with vomiting and malaise. Characterization by cell culture showed that of the 35 positive samples, 12 (34 %) produced cytopathic effects (CPE) in cell culture after incubation for 10 days. PCR amplification of a 440 bp fragment using CoV-specific primers confirmed that the CPE was due to HCoVs. To determine whether there were any HCoVs in the supernatants of the 23 cultures that did not yield CPE, RT-PCR using HCoV-specific primers generated the expected 440 bp amplicon from 3 of these samples. Homology analyses of the partial nucleotide sequences of the RdRp (pol) gene of the Kenyan HCoV against the prototype strains ranged from 59 to 100 % (Table 1) . Nucleotide sequence homology within groups ranged from 99 to 100 % for HCoV-OC43, 97-99 % for HCoV-HKU1 and 98-99 % for HCoV-NL63. The Kenya HCoV-229E species had 99 % nucleotide sequence identity compared to the prototype strain. Phylogenetic analyses of the Kenyan isolates based on the nucleotide sequences with representative reference strains revealed separation of the viruses into the two α and β corona-virus groups with further resolution into four species, corresponding to HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1 (Fig. 3) . The majority (42 %) of the Kenyan isolates clustered within the HCoV-OC43 group, followed by HCoV-NL63 (26 %) and HCoV-HKUI & HCoV-229E (16 % each). All the Kenyan HCoV-OC43 isolates formed a cluster on their own except isolate HCOV-016 which grouped with the other HCoV-OC43 viruses from other countries across the globe. The Kenyan HCoV-NL63 isolates clustered with other HCoV-NL63 viruses. The Kenyan HCoV- HKU1 isolates grouped close to the French virus whose accession number is EF507794 and the Kenyan HCoV-229E isolates were identical to the reference strains used. In establishing the evolution rates of the Kenyan HCoVs, Tajima's test showed an overall value of Tajima's D statistic for the eight HCoV-OC43 pol gene segments as −1.31009 with p > 0.10 at 95 % CI. For HCoV-NL63, the overall value of Tajima's D statistic for the 5 sequences was −0.97256 with p > 0.10 at 95 % CI. The evolutionary rates of the Kenyan HCoVs were also analyzed using Fu and Li's D as well as Fu and Li's F tests as these can accommodate small sample sizes. The overall Fu and Li's D value for the HCoV-OC43 pol gene segments was −1.40980 and −0.97256 for HCoV-NL63, p > 0.10. The overall Fu and Li's F statistic was −1.51361 for HCoV-OC43 and −0.95440 for HCoV-NL63, p > 0.10.
