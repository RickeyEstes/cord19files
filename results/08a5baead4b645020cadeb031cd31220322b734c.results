From June 1 to August 31, 2007, bats were caught and classifi ed according to species, sex, age category, gravidity, and lactation status. Bat species were typed by morphologic criteria by experienced bat biologists who had worked in the habitat for several years. A total of 315 bats were sampled (Table 1) Spillover of bats between colonies was not seen, with one interesting exception. In location 2, one of 7 examined M. dasycneme bats was already banded. Its ring number showed that it had spilled over from another area. This bat was the only one yielding coronavirus in location 2. By tagging with a radio transmitter, its maternity roost could be traced to location 3, â‰ˆ10 km away. When location 3 was sampled, it yielded 45% positive bats (15 of 38 M. dasycneme tested), the highest rate of all locations sampled in the study period. Factors correlating with coronavirus infection were determined. Analysis was conducted on major physical properties. Approximately half of the bats (56%) were females, 30% of them lactating. Twenty-seven percent were juvenile, 12% subadult, and 61% adult. As shown in Table  2 , ANOVA analysis identifi ed that young age and ongoing lactation, but not a particular sex or existing gravidity, correlated signifi cantly positively with coronavirus detection. Among female bats, detection rates were signifi cantly higher in those bats associated with maternity colonies than in those caught in foraging habitats (2-tailed t test, p = 0.026) or swarming sites (2-tailed t test, p = 0.037). Differences between foraging and swarming sites were not signifi cant (p = 0.609). Sequences of PCR products from all coronaviruses were determined. As shown in Figure 2 , the northern German viruses clustered in 1 large monophyletic clade containing no other previously known virus. In a sister relationship was a clade of viruses from Chinese bats with prototype strains A701/2005, HKU6 and A821/2005 (18, 34) . These viruses were all detected in M. ricketti, which belongs to the same subgenus (Leuconoe Boie) as M. dasycneme and uses a similar ecologic niche (35) (36) (37) . Within the northern German bat-CoV clade, 4 different lineages appeared to be monophyletically associated with certain bat species. Lineage 1 was associated with M. dasycneme, lineage 2 with P. nathusii, lineage 3 with P. pygmaeus, and lineage 4 with M. daubentonii. As expected, the coronavirus from the stray bat from location 2 and the viruses from location 3 clustered closely together in lineage 1. Within the same lineage was 1 coronavirus from an M. dasycneme bat that had been sampled at a different site and at a different time (location 5), along with Pipistrellus bats that carried clearly distinct virus of lineages 2 and 3. Viruses therefore seemed to be more closely associated with (Figure 2 ). To appreciate the diversity of northern German bat-CoV, a nucleotide distance matrix of 30 major taxa of coronaviruses was set up, including established coronavirus species and novel bat-CoV taxa, as recently defi ned (online Appendix Figure, available from www.cdc.gov/EID/ content/14/4/625-appG.htm). Lineages 1, 2, and 3 had mutual nucleic acid distances between 6% and 8%. Distance of lineage 4 from the aforementioned was 12%-13%. Distance of northern German lineages 1-4 from the sister clade of Chinese M. ricketti CoV was 15%-17%. The Chinese and northern German Myotis-associated CoV and their common sister clade, represented by strain A512/2005, were 20%-22% distant. For comparison, among the established species of CoV the lowest degrees of nucleic acid distances were observed between mouse hepatitis virus, human CoV HKU1, and the hCoV-OC43/bovine CoV pair, at 16%-18%. The 2 established lineages within CoV group 2b (SARS-like CoV, bat-SARS CoV HKU3) were 10% distant.
