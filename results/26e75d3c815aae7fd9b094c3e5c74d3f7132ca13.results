PubMed search There were 9964 search results, 68 abstracts were screened, 50 were excluded as not including pregnant women or humans or being in-vitro studies. Eighteen relevant studies were identified, their full texts were reviewed and all 18 were included. It is highly likely that there were overlaps in cases reported to be affected by SARS. MedRxiv search 600 results, 39 abstracts were screened, no relevant studies identified. There was inconsistent reporting of maternal, perinatal and neonatal outcomes across case reports and series. All studies were case reports or series with varying levels of detail on the data and outcomes assessed, subjectively all were of low quality. A narrative review is presented. Where reported maternal morbidity and mortality (n=10), 1 woman required ICU and mechanical ventilation, all women had viral changes apparent on CT chest imaging and there were no maternal deaths (1, 2) . SARS Case fatality rate (CFR) was 15% for all reported cases of SARS in pregnancy (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . A casecontrol study comparing 10 pregnant and 40 non-pregnant women affected by SARS in Hong Kong reported 60% ICU admission and 40% CFR in the pregnant group compared with 17.5% and 0% in the non-pregnant group (7) . All women affected by SARS had CT or chest X-ray evidence of pneumonia. MERS In pregnant women affected by MERS, 7/11 (63%) were admitted to ICU and CFR was 3/11 (27%) (10-15). (6) . These 4 women all had ultrasound findings of 3-5 week pregnancies of unknown location or unknown viability in which ongoing pregnancy at 13 weeks would be expected in 38% and 50% respectively (acknowledging the complexity in this area (16, 17) ). Those with fetal heart activity recorded (n=2) did not miscarry, neither did a woman in whom the diagnosis was retrospective and did not undergo ultrasound scan. MERS a single case of a women with MERS has been reported in the first trimester. This woman was asymptomatic and went on to have a term delivery (18) .
