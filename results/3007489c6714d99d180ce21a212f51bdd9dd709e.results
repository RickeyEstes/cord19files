In this section we use the AEM model of bat rabies to investigate the influence of the immunological heterogeneity in bat populations on the disease and population dynamics. We consider several scenarios of rabies virus introduction into bat colonies with different initial population profiles and compare the resulting trends in the population size as well as the portions of infected and exposed bats. Effects of immunological heterogeneity: One of the main motivations to develop an AEM based on the diversity of the immune response comes from the serious differences in the intrahost dynamics observed during experimental rabies infections. Because the strength of the immune system of each individual bat determines its chances of survival then the disease puts different levels of pressure on each immunotype. The simulations of bat rabies in colonies composed of single immunotypes clearly distinguish three dynamical types of immunotypic populations (Fig. 5) . It is natural to expect that the introduction of the virus into a heterogeneous population will initiate a dynamic process of stressor selection eventually leading to a ''survival of the fittest immunotype''. However, the results of our simulations predict an alternative outcome. To illustrate the role of the immune response variations we consider bat populations composed of two distinct immunotypes and investigate how immune heterogeneity affects the dynamics of each immunotypic subpopulation and the colony as a whole. The graphs in Fig. 7 present AEM simulations of the disease dynamics of bat colonies that consist of combinations of Immunotypes #16, #113, and #125 as defined in Appendix A. The comparison of those graphs to simulations from Fig. 5 shows that the survival of the immunologically stronger immunotype is not necessarily at the weaker immunotype's expense. To the contrary, an existing infection slows down the growth of the stronger immunotype and improves the performance of the weaker immunotype. This effect is particularly significant in the combination between Immunotypes #16 and #113 where the ''endangered'' subpopulation turns into a growing ''reservoir'' type when combined with a stronger ''recovering'' immunotype. These unexpected dynamics can be explained by the frequencydependent transmission mechanism of the PDM (4). It implies that after the introduction of the virus into a bi-immunotypic population the portion of the colony belonging to the stronger immunotype increases, the disease pressure on the weaker subpopulation decreases and it is able to overcome the infection. Conversely, the disease pressure on the stronger subpopulation increases and therefore its growth slows compared to the immunotypic population scenario. In addition, the portion of exposed and infected bats is higher among the immunosuppressed subpopulation (Fig. 7b) , which supports a hypothesis (Constantine, 1988 ) that immunodeficient individuals maintain rabies viruses in colonial bat populations. Infectivity of surviving bats: The existence of an infectious period of bats surviving rabies exposure was discussed (Echevarria et al., 2001; Steece and Altenbach, 1989) . However, the vast majority of bat studies dismiss this possibility. A discussion was recently reopened after some experimental infections resulted in a temporal infectiousness tending toward survival (Aguilar-Setien et al., 2005) . An AEM allows us to analyze the effect of a possible infectious period on the disease dynamics in immunologically homogeneous and heterogeneous bat populations. For the purpose of that analysis we consider two different versions of the IDM (3) assume that the recovering bats can go through a brief infectious period while ''subclinical'' versions ignore the possibility that exposed individuals are able to initiate effective contacts, i.e., assume that q ij Â¼ 0. The two implementations of the IDM are identical for some ''endangered'' immunotypic populations, such as the one based on Immunotype #16, because the viral concentrations of all exposed classes never reach the transmission threshold. For some ''recovering'' immunotypic populations the disease dynamics for both versions differ in their epizootic distribution but do not express significant differences in the population dynamics ( Fig. 8a and b) . These colonies are immunologically strong, most exposed bats recover, and the colonies clear the disease after a short period. The temporal infectivity of surviving bats has a much stronger effect on the ''reservoir'' and some of the ''endangered'' populations. The comparison of simulations of the ''subclinical'' IDM ( Fig. 8c and d) for immunotypic populations #65 and #125 with the corresponding ''full'' version simulations from Fig. 5b and c shows substantial differences in the population dynamics. The additional infections initiated by recovering bats do not increase the disease pressure on the colonies. Conversely, populations benefit from these infections which contribute mostly to the immunized portion of the colonies. These effects do not change the qualitative disease dynamics, in that the long term fate of those colonies remains unaffected. Fig. 8e and f compare the disease dynamics caused by the introduction of the virus into heterogeneous populations simu-lated with the ''full'' and ''subclinical'' PDMs. In addition to the effects of the temporal infectivity of surviving bats on the population dynamics we observe differences in the immunological profile of the colony. Immunotypic subpopulations with intermediate immunocompetence such as #65 and #125 benefit from the increased amount of effective contacts because most of the additionally exposed bats survive and develop immunity. The growth of some subpopulations as a part of the population profile is supported only by the ''full'' PDM. Based on the calculated transmission coefficients q ij the average portion of effective transmissions caused by infectious recovering bats varies between 2% and 3% of all effective contacts. Our simulations show that even at such low levels they have a serious impact on the disease dynamics by increasing the immunocompetence of the exposed colonies. This fact emphasizes the need for additional investigation of this hypothesis and its significance to the association between rabies and bats.
