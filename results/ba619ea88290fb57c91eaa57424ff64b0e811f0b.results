Construction of a N. gonorrhoeae genomic phage display library Genomic DNA of N. gonorrhoeae was fragmented by sonication and cloned into pHORF3, resulting in three libraries with 1.3 x, 1.0 x and 1.2 x 10 7 independent clones with an average insert size of 190 bp, 290 bp and 174 bp, respectively. The libraries covered the theoretically required number of clones of 7.8 x, 5.1 x and 8.55 x 10 4 more than 100 fold. The insert rates and sizes were analysed by colony PCR (Fig 1A) and sequencing. Eight randomly picked clones of each library were used for colony PCR and an additional seven per library were picked for sequencing. All libraries had insert rates of more than 85%. The inserts ranged from 56 bp to 450 bp. The libraries were then pooled resulting in an average insert length of 218 bp and used for Hyperphage packaging. The packaged library was checked for the number of inserts by colony PCR ( Fig 1B) and for correct in-frame inserts by sequencing. While the cloned libraries had an in-frame insert ratio of approximately 5%, the in-frame insert rate was increased to 70% after Hyperphage packaging. The average insert size was 216 bp. Panning and screening of oligopeptide phage A polyclonal rabbit antibody to N. gonorrhoeae was used for the panning rounds. Individual clones were picked after two and three panning rounds. Clones were picked after two and three rounds of panning since binders with low affinities are removed during the panning process resulting in only the best binders after three consecutive panning rounds. This is advantageous for isolation of recombinant antibodies; however, in case of immunogenic proteins it would be ideal to identify all proteins with immunogenic character regardless of their affinity. In total, 276 oligopeptide phage clones were produced and analysed by ELISA. The average value of the negative controls was subtracted from all values and clones with higher signals than 0.3 were further analysed by sequencing. Twenty-one different genes were identified and checked for similarity by BLAST (Table 1) . Furthermore, phage particles presenting different parts of the same gene were identified (exemplary for NGO0592 see S1 Fig.) . Thirteen of the identified proteins have been described in the literature before. Eight oligopeptides exhibited no homologies to known antigens. One clone carried parts of two genes-NGO1656 and NGO1657-the last 92 bp of NGO1657, a non-coding part of 48 bp and 131 bp of NGO1656. Both genes were chosen to further characterise the immunogenic character of their encoded proteins. The eight potential immunogenic proteins and several controls were chosen for full-length protein production (Table 1) . Additionally, NGO1500 (glutamate racemase) was obtained through panning; however, it was dismissed after screening due to low signal intensities in ELISA and used as a negative control.
