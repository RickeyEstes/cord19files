From our model, the value of the constant reporting rate (r) was estimated at 0·46% using a minimum value of RSE. The bootstrapped 95% CI was between 0·28% and 0·69% when the estimated value of R 0 was 1·24 (Fig. 2, Table 2 ). The value R 0 remained steady when r was >0·1%. The figure demonstrated that an increasing reporting rate was associated with exponential decreases in R 0 ; thus, only fitting the surveillance data to the epidemic model would provide unreliable findings for the estimation of the r. Using these estimates, there was a 0·7% (95% CI 0·4-1·1) cumulative incidence in the Mexican population at the end of April 2009, which was the time that the pandemic phase 5 alert level was announced by the WHO. The reporting rate did not increase after enhanced surveillance in Mexico after mid-April 2009, when officials stepped up surveillance systems ( Table 2 ). The r min was 0·46% (bootstrapped 95% CI 0·27-0·68), whereas the r max was 0·47% (bootstrapped 95% CI 0·28-0·69). Reporting behaviour may not have been significantly affected during this short time-frame. In the study, we considered the sensitivity of missing 'detections' of imported cases in the estimation process. The entry-screening sensitivities of countries were found to be moderately sensitive to our results. If the entry-screening sensitivities were distributed uniformly between 30% and 100%, the constant r was estimated as 0·18% (95% CI 0·09-0·31) ( Table 2 ). The value was relatively lower due to a decrease in the average probability of detection. If a linear trend was assumed, a slight increase of the reporting rate was observed. The rate increased from 0·10% (95% CI 0·03-0·26) to 0·31% (95% CI 0·11-0·80). However, this increasing range was insignificant and did not deviate much from our initial estimates. The impacts of variation of latent period length and infectious period on our results were also tested. As shown in Figures 3 and 4 , the variation of lengths did not make any impact on the reporting rate estimation. The constant r was 0·44% (bootstrapped 95% CI 0·31-0·69) and the values of the linear reporting rates (r min and r max ) were both close to this value (Table 2) . However, the variations did affect the Fig. 4 . The effect of variations in the lengths of the latent and infectious periods given a linearly increasing reporting rate assumption. The impacts to r min , r max , and R 0 are shown by the box-plots from left, middle, and right panels, respectively. estimated value of R 0 ; the estimated median R 0 was 1·24 (range 1·11-1·44) given a constant assumption of r. Insignificant difference was observed for the range of R 0 given a linearly increasing assumption. The range of R 0 was consistent with other studies [20, 28, 29] . Given the estimates, the date of seeding for pH1N1 was exponentially interpolated from the date of the first confirmed case (i.e. 14 March 2009 with an estimate of about 400 infections). From the results, the date of seeding for pH1N1 was estimated as 24 December 2011 (95% CI 17-29 December 2011) in order to maintain a sufficient large epidemic size for exportation of cases. About 5500 Mexicans were infected by pH1N1 virus before the date of the first confirmed case in the surveillance data. When the minimum and maximum values (1·11 and 1·44, tespectively) of the range of R 0 were adopted in the estimation, the dates of seeding for pH1N1 were 26 September 2011 (95% CI 12 September 2011 to 7 October 2011) and 27 January 2012 (95% CI 23-30 January 2012), respectively.
