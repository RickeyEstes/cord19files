BLVRA treatment attenuated short-term neurological deficits and splenic contraction up to 3 days after GMH Brain morphology was evaluated by Nissl staining on day 3 after GMH. Ventricular volume was significantly increased in the vehicle group compared with sham animals, but BLVRA treatment decreased GMH-induced ventricular dilation (Fig. 1a) . 3 days post-GMH, developmental delay was observed in the vehicle group compared with the sham group, as demonstrated in both righting reflex and negative geotaxis. BLVRA administration attenuated neurological deficits after GMH (Fig. 1b, c) . Then we also observed that GMH induced significant splenic contraction on both day 1 and day 3 after GMH. BLVRA-treated animals had significantly less splenic contraction compared with the vehicle group (Fig. 1d, e) . Our data on the ratio of spleen weight over body weight and spleen volumes also indicated that GMH induced significant splenic atrophy on days 1 and 3 post-ictus and that BLVRA effectively attenuated this atrophic response (Fig. 1f, g) . The effect of GMH inducing splenocyte mobilization into the brain and splenic apoptosis were decreased by BLVRA treatment Neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer cells play a critical role in the innate immunity [25] [26] [27] [28] .

It is defined as cleaning cells, offering the first response to immune challenges [25] . In order to determine whether spleen-derived peripheral immune cells accumulated in the brain, we evaluated neutrophils in the spleen and the brain 1 day after GMH. Immunofluorescence showed that GMH reduced the number of neutrophils in the spleen on day 1 (Fig. 2a) . We further evaluated neutrophil infiltration into the brain 1 day after GMH. A larger number of neutrophils were observed in the peri-ventricular region of the brain (Fig. 2b) . This induction was attenuated by BLVRA administration (Fig. 2a, b) . Moreover, apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining in the spleen on days 1 and 3 after GMH. A moderate increase in TUNEL-positive splenocytes was found on day 1 after GMH (Fig. 2d, f ) . Moreover, 3 days after GMH, the number of TUNEL-positive splenocytes strikingly increased (Fig. 2e, f ) . These results indicated that the reduction of splenocytes after GMH was probably due to their mobilization into the circulation, rather than splenic apoptosis on day 1 after GMH.
