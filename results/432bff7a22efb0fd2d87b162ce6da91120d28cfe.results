In children < 2 years old, the age group eligible for free influenza vaccination, there was a significant reduction in seasonal AOM incidence after TIV Introduction Acute otitis media (AOM) is a common infectious disease among children, especially in the preschool-age population. The majority of studies regarding childhood AOM reported that the incidence peaked in children 6-12 months old, and decreased with age [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . AOM is also among the leading causes for children's visits to physicians and is the most common reason for prescription of antibiotics to children with respiratory conditions [9] . Moreover, otitis media with effusion (OME) can occur as a post-inflammatory response to AOM. The effusion in the middle ear could decrease sound transmission, resulting in conductive hearing loss [10] . Tympanostomy tube insertions are recommended for children with bilateral chronic OME (OME lasting for 3 months or longer) and recurrent AOM with middle ear effusion [11] . The resulting psychological burden on parents and substantial economic costs also demonstrate that AOM is a major public health concern [12] . There is evidence that viruses play a crucial role in the development of AOM [13] [14] [15] . AOM is usually accompanied with a preceding viral upper respiratory tract infection (URI), which may initiate a cascade of events that eventually leads to inflammation of the middle ear mucosa [13] . AOM may be regarded as a complication of this viral syndrome. The impact of influenza vaccination on childhood otitis media has been discussed worldwide, but no consensus has been reached to date. Since 2004, the Taiwan Center for Disease Control (CDC) launched a program to provide free influenza vaccine (traditional injectable trivalent influenza vaccine, TIV) for children aged 6-24 months. Additionally, pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) had not become popular in Taiwan until 2007. In this study, we used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to assess trends in the incidence of childhood AOM and tympanostomy tube insertion during the influenza season. The NHIRD contains claims data derived from the government-operated, single-payer National Health Insurance program, which was launched in 1995 and covers nearly all (99%) of the 23 million residents of Taiwan [16] . Every admission, operation, and outpatient visit record is included in this database. Our study aim was to assess the efficacy of influenza vaccine in preventing AOM over a 7-year period that encompassed the introduction of TIV in Taiwan, since October 2004. The study population comprised 803,592 children < 10 years old in influenza seasons between October 2000 and March 2007. There were 117,591 outpatient visits with AOM identified in 49,038 children. During the pre-TIV era (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) , the mean seasonal AOM incidence was 58.9 episodes/1000 person-seasons (95% CI: 55.6-62.1) in those <10 years old, with the highest incidence in those < 2 years old (98.4 episodes/1000 person-seasons; 95% CI: 96.4-100.5), followed by those 2-4 years old (61.7 episodes/1000 person-seasons; 95% CI: 60.7-92.6), and those 5-9 years old (28.6 episodes/1000 person-seasons; 95% CI: 28.0-29.1). After TIV introduction (2004) (2005) (2006) , the mean seasonal AOM incidence was 67 episodes/ 1000 person-seasons (95% CI: 63.4-70.6) in those < 10 years old, with the highest incidence in those 2-4 years olds (71.7 episodes/1000 person-seasons; 95% CI: 70.2-73.1), followed by those < 2 years old (66.1 episodes/1000 person-seasons; 95% CI: 64.0-68.1), and those 5-9 years old (33.8 episodes/1000 person-seasons; 95% CI: 33.1-34.4). The incidence of AOM in childen <2 years old declined by 32.8% after introduction of TIV. Additionally, the incidence of AOM in those 2-4 years old and 5-9 years old were both increased by 16.2% and 18.2%, respectively. In children < 2 years old, the age group that received free influenza vaccination, there was a significant reduction in AOM incidence after the introduction of the TIV in 2004 (Fig 1,  Table 1 ) Table 1 ). In addition, with the increased vaccine coverage (Table 2 ) [19] , the number of outpatient visits for AOM in children < 2 years old in the influenza season in 2005 and 2006 was significantly lower than that in 2004 (IRR = 0.85 and 0.80, respectively, p < 0.0001; Fig 2) . Furthermore, we identified 678 tympanostomy tube insertions in 538 children. The IRR for each influenza season between October 2000 and March 2007 was not significantly different in all three age groups (Table 3) . Data were adapted from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Taiwan. [19] a Patients who received two doses of vaccine in the primary year and one dose each subsequent year, or received at least one dose before and one dose in the particular season, were classified as fully-vaccinated. b Patients who received one dose of vaccine, but had never received a dose before were classified as partially vaccinated. c Patients who did not receive any dose of vaccine were classified as non-vaccinated. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0190507.t002
