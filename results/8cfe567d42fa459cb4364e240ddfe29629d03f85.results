On average, the elderly patients with asthma had significantly lower respiratory function, as well as less current asthma control according to GINA criteria and a lower ACT score, although both groups demonstrated similar disease severity based on the ATS Workshop 2000 criteria ( Table 1 ). The distribution of inflammatory cells in the induced sputum varied depending on the age: older patients had a higher mean percentage of eosinophils (p < 0.05) and lymphocytes (p < 0.05), and a lower percentage of macrophages (p < 0.05) in IS (Table 2 ). However, the elderly and non-elderly asthmatics had similar mean FeNO levels and concentrations of such eosinophilic inflammation markers as periostin in IS, ECP, and total IgE in serum (Table 1 ).
