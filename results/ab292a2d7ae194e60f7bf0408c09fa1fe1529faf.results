Primers were not tested against all 51 Ad serotypes, but were designed as broadly reactive as possible to detect all these serotypes. These primers were chosen by comparing the sequences of VA RNA regions in the Genbank database. These sequences included Ad 1-11 plus Ad 16, 18, 21, 30, 40, 41 and 46, which are representative of the seven species. One Ad from each species was amplified and the resulting products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. The (Fig. 1) . However, as large bands (>500 bp) migrate slowly, Ad species B1, C, D and E cannot be reliably differentiated on this basis, thus species-specific probes were also designed as shown below. The specificity of PCR Adenovirus Consensus ® was demonstrated by the fact that no amplified products were detected from nucleic acids extracted of cell cultures infected with other viruses and of bacterias that cause respiratory infections or are commonly found in the upper respiratory tract: influenza virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3, coronavirus 229 E and OC 43, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, herpes simplex virus type 1, herpesvirus varicellae, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, herpes virus type 6, parvovirus B19, BK and JC viruses, measles virus, mumps virus. The analytical sensitivity of PCR Adenovirus Consensus ® was further delineated by testing the DNA extracted from serial dilutions of MRC-5-infected cells. We used Ad prototype strains belonging to the main species and representative of those isolated from patients with respiratory Ad infections: Ad 12 (sp A), Ad 3 and Ad 7 (sp B1), Ad 11 (sp B2), Ad 1 (sp C), Ad 8 (sp D), Ad 4 (sp E). The numbers of genome equivalents per ml (GE/ml) were calculated using the end point dilution method and were compared to the 50% infectious dose per ml (ID50/ml) for each strain (Table 1 ). The mean GE/ml and ID50/ml for the Ad 12 A 10 2.0 10 3.5 10 4.5 10 5.5 Ad 3 B1 10 4.0 10 4.5 10 6.5 10 6.5 Ad 7 B1 10 3.2 10 6.5 10 6.5 10 7.5 Ad 11 B2 10 3.4 10 6.5 10 8.5 10 8.5 Ad 1 C 10 4.9 10 4.5 10 6.5 10 6.5 Ad 8 D 10 2.9 10 4.5 10 5.5 10 5.5 Ad 4 E 10 3.2 10 5.5 10 5.5 10 6.5 Mean 10 4.0 10 5.0 10 6.35 10 6.35 Serial dilutions of MRC5 cells infected with Ad prototype strains from the main species and representative of respiratory Ad infections: Ad 12 (sg A), Ad 3 and Ad 7 (sg B1), Ad 11 (sg B2), Ad 1 (sg C), Ad 8 (sg D), Ad 4 (sg E) were used to count the number of genome equivalents per ml (GE/ml) and the 50% infectious doses per ml (ID50/ml). seven serotypes, were 10 6.3 and 10 4 , respectively. The large difference between the titres of the Ad strains according to their ID/ml or GE/ml, is probably to be due to the fact that MRC cells are not the best culture system for the isolation of Ad and that higher GE values reflects the proportion of nonviable virus unable to initiate productive infection. As usual, the result was slightly higher with the hybridisation method than with the gel electrophoresis method (mean titres of Ad strains: 10 6.2 versus 10 5 , respectively). However, the titres obtained after hybridisation in the PCR Adenovirus Consensus ® technique did not differ according to whether the consensus probe or the sugbroup-specific probes were used. The clinical sensitivities of the PCR Adenovirus Consensus ® and PCR Ad hexon methods were compared to those of the immunofluorescence and culture methods, using 362 nasal aspirates. Ad were detected by immunofluorescence and culture in 97 cases (27%), by the PCR-Ad hexon method in 107 cases (29.5%) and by the PCR Adenovirus Consensus ® method in 113 cases (31.2%) ( Table 2) . Thirteen of the samples found to be positive by both PCR were found to be negative by the immunofluorescence and culture methods. Five samples were only positive according to the PCR Adenovirus Consensus ® method; these samples were re-extracted and still found to be Ad positive. Two of the samples found to be negative according to the PCR Adenovirus Consensus ® method were found positive by PCR in one case and by culture in the other case and the isolate was not tested by the PCR assay. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive value and predictive negative value of the PCR Adenovirus Consensus ® method and of the PCR-Ad hexon method were given in Table 2 . The PCR Adenovirus Consensus ® kit included probes specific for each species. The ability of this method to determine the species was assessed on 160 specimens which were randomly selected from November to February during winters 1998-1999 and 1999-2000. All samples were sys-tematically tested by immunofluorescence, culture methods and by the PCR-RE digestion method proposed by Allard et al. (2001) . Overall, 91 Ad-positive samples were identified (Table 3) . Their distribution was as follows: 1 Ad sp A, 44 Ad sp B, 42 Ad sp C, 3 Ad sp E, and 1 Ad sp F. In all cases, the PCR Adenovirus Consensus ® method gave positive results. Eighty five isolates were identified by the immunofluorescence or the neutralisation in culture method, and 86 by the PCR-RE digestion method. The PCR Adenovirus Consensus ® detected six positive samples that were negative according to the immunofluorescence and culture methods: two Ad sp B1, three Ad sp C and one Ad species F. It also, identified the precise species of nine immunofluorescence-positive and culture-negative nasal aspirates. The PCR Adenovirus Consensus ® method, was slightly more efficient than the PCR-RE digestion method, identifying five new positive samples: three Ad sp B1, one Ad sp C and one Ad sp F. All the other serotypes were a Thirteen specimens were positive in both PCR Ad consensus and PCR Ad hexon but not in according to the culture/immunofluorescence method. Five additional samples were only positive according to PCR Ad consensus, these samples were re-extracted and controlled as positive. identified as belonging to the same species by the two techniques.
