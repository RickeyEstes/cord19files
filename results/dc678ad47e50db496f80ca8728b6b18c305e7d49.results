Bacterial pathogens detected by culture and PCR Forty-seven patients (median age, 26 months; range, 4 months to 14 years) with ruptured tympanic membranes were included. Cultures were positive for a bacterial pathogen in 22 cases (47%), mainly S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae (Table 1) . Among the 25 pathogen-negative samples, 19 yielded skin commensals such as coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, or diptheroid rods, considered to be contaminants from the external ear canal. All culture-positive samples were also positive by PCR, except for one sample yielding S. pneumoniae in culture but not by PCR (Table 1) . Another sample yielded S. pyogenes in culture, but the PCR was not designed to detect this pathogen. In seven culture-positive samples, the PCR revealed not only the bacteria found by culture in each sample, but also an additional one or two bacterial pathogens. Among the 25 culture-negative samples, 21 were also negative by PCR. Thus, only a few additional pathogens were detected with PCR in the samples negative by culture. Dilution (1 : 5 and 1 : 25) to minimize the effect of possible inhibitors did not increase the detection rate, and admixed pneumococcal DNA was readily detected by PCR, ruling out the possibility that negative results were caused by the presence of inhibitory substances in the MEFs.
