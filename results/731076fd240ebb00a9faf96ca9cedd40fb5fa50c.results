We developed the study protocol, obtained WHO ethics approval, contacted the participants, delivered the survey, analysed the data, and presented the findings as part of the evidence-to-decision tables at the expert panel meeting where the recommendations were formulated in a period of 8 weeks. We invited 192 health workers (166 from MSF and 26 from WHO) to participate in the survey and 74 (39%) responded. Respondents from MSF included 30 logisticians and water, sanitation and hygiene experts who were excluded because they were not part of the sampling frame. Thus 44 participants (33 physicians and 11 nurses) were included in the final analysis and their characteristics are described in Table 1 .
