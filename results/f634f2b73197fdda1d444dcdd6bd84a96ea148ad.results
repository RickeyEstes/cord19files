Differences in viral fitness and host symptomatology. Table 1 shows relevant information about the seven TEV genotypes used for this study. The mutant genotypes differ from the wildtype (WT) TEV in a rather limited number of nonsynonymous mutations (1 or 2). However, their fitness values and the severity of symptoms induced differ widely. Significant differences existed among the fitness values of the seven viral genotypes chosen for this study ( Fig. 2A ; GLM likelihood ratio test: c 2 = 373.006, 6 df, P < 0.001) and among plants inoculated with the same viral genotype (c 2 = 2927.885, 14 df, P < 0.001). As a measure of the quality of data, the percentage of total variance for relative fitness explained by true genetic differences among genotypes was 70.56%, whilst differences among plants inoculated with the same viral genotype accounted for 29.16% of the observed variance. The remaining 0.28% of the observed variability was assignable to error measurements. A Bonferroni post hoc test classifies the seven genotypes into five groups (labeled as a to f in Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, the three genotypes with the lowest fitness values (AS13, CLA2 and CLA11) contain mutations in the multifunctional protein HC-Pro, whose most relevant role during infection is to serve as suppressor of the RNA-silencing (VSR) defense 40 . The two genotypes with mutations in the CI protein (PC55 and PC48), a helicase also involved in cell-to-cell movement 40 , have the mildest deleterious fitness effects. Mutant PC95, which contains a point mutation in the replicase NIb protein 40 Symptoms ranged from the asymptomatic infection or local chlorotic spots characteristic of mutant AS13, the mild etching of mutant CLA11 and the severe etching induced by the WT and the other mutants. No correlation exists between virus fitness and symptoms, a finding previously reported for this experimental system 32 . Differences in viral fitness are associated with differences in the magnitude of the perturbation over the host transcriptome. First, we sought to test whether differences in TEV fitness might be associated with differences in the gene expression profiles of the infected plants. We hypothesized that viral fitness results from a particular interaction between virus and host factors, assuming that the outcome of infection of a WT virus in its natural host results from an optimal (from the virus perspective) modulation of the host's gene expression profile. As viral fitness in the host is reduced, interactions are less optimal and, consequently, the gene expression profile of the plant will be more and more different from that resulting from the successful infection with the WT genotype. To test this hypothesis, we infected N. tabacum plants with each one of the seven TEV genotypes described above. Eight days post-inoculation (dpi) symptomatic tissues were collected for all mutants except for the very low fitness mutant AS13, for which tissues were collected 15 dpi because the delay in symptoms appearance and severity (Fig. 2B) . Total RNAs were extracted, its quality verified, concentration normalized and used to hybridize N. tabacum Gene Expression 4×44K Microarrays (Agilent). Slides were handled as described in the Methods section; intensity signals were normalized using tools in BABELOMICS 41 . Normalized expression data are contained in Supplementary Dataset S1. Fig. 3A shows the clustering (unweighted average distance method; UPGMA) of average expression data for those genes that significantly changed expression (±2-fold) among plants infected with the seven viral genotypes (1-way ANOVAs with FDR correction; overall P < 0.05) relative to the mockinoculated plants. Regarding individual genes, two major clusters can be distinguished, one corresponding to the over-expression of genes related to stress response and a second one corresponding to the underexpression of genes involved with metabolism and plant development. To further explore the similarity in the perturbation induced by each viral genotype into the plants' transcriptome, we computed all pairwise Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (r) between the mean expression values for all genes in the microarray. Then, these correlations were used as a measure of similarity to build a UPGMA dendrogram. The rationale for this analysis is as follows: the more correlated two expression profiles are, the more similar the effects induced in infected plants. When comparing expression profiles from a pair of infected plants, a significant correlation may indicate that genes that changed expression relative to the mock-inoculated plants, are exactly the same in both samples, showing a similar expression pattern. If this is the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/206789 doi: bioRxiv preprint case, the correlation coefficient is expected to be high. Conversely, if genes with differential expression do not match in the two samples being compared, then the correlation will be lower. Three clusters result from this analysis (Fig. 3B) show the most dissimilar gene expression profile. The heat-map is shown with viral genotypes ordered according to the UPGMA clustering. Obviously, it is symmetric, with the diagonal corresponding to the correlation between profiles from plants infected with the same viral genotype, thus being r » 1. Correlations decreased as the distance in the cladogram increases. Within clusters, r > 0.85, whilst between clusters the correlations ranged 0.65 < r < 0.75, except for plants infected with AS13, whose similarity with other infected plants was always r < 0.65. Next, to further investigate the similarity between expression profiles of plants infected with different TEV genotypes, we performed principal components analysis (PCA) of all the gene expression data. The percentage of total observed variance explained by the first three PCAs was ~93% (the first principal component, pc 1 , itself explained up to 81%). Fig. 3C shows the distribution of values in the space defined by the three first principal components. Results are equivalent to those obtained with the two previous clustering methods, as genotypes are classified into three groups. WT, PC55 and PC48 are closer in the space and characterized by positive values of pc 1 but negative values of the second (pc 2 ) and third (pc 3 ) components. CLA11, PC95 and CLA2 form a second group, with positive values of pc 1 and pc 2 but negative values of pc 3 . As before, AS13 effect on host' transcriptome is clearly different, and has negative values of pc 1 and pc 2 but positive of pc 3 . Interestingly, Fig. 3C shows that genotypes are located in this principal component space following a trajectory of increasing fitness values (indicated by the grey arrow in Fig. 3C ). Along this trajectory, pc's switch of sign but in different ways. This transition suggests that the over-or under-expression of a set of genes is associated with particular levels of viral fitness: low fitness AS13 is characterized by a positive pc 3 and a negative pc 1 while high fitness viruses are characterized by the opposite sign. That is, over-or under-expressed genes are not progressively accumulated as long as viral fitness changes. These genes will be evaluated in the following sections. Following from our working hypothesis, if the WT virus has evolved to optimize its interaction with the host, it is logical that small departures in viral fitness will be associated with small deviations between the transcriptomes of plants infected with the WT virus and with viruses whose fitness are close to the WT. Conversely, the less similar fitness between the WT and mutant viruses, the more dissimilar would be the transcriptional profiles of infected plants. To test this prediction, we have explored (i) the correlation between the similarity of transcriptional profiles of plants infected with the WT TEV and with each mutant (again using Pearson's r) and .

The results of these analyses are shown in Figs. 3D and 3E. As expected, both correlations were significant (r = 0.826, P = 0.005 and r = -0.857, P = 0.003, respectively; in both cases 5 d.f.) and of the expected sign. The number of altered genes depends on viral fitness. Next, following the same rationale than in the previous section, we sought to determine whether the number of DEGs also depends on the difference in fitness between WT and the mutant TEV genotypes. In this case, we hypothesized that the overlap in the lists of DEGs must be similar for WT and viruses of equivalent fitness (e.g., PC48 or PC55), whereas the magnitude of the overlap between DEG lists would decrease as differences in fitness exist. Of particular interest following all results presented above is the similarity between PC95, a mutant of the replicase NIb gene, and CLA11, a mutant of the VSR HC-Pro gene. These two mutations led to close fitness values ( Fig. 2A) , but also resulted in significantly similar gene expression profiles (Fig. 4B ). At first sight, one may argue that their impact in transcriptomic profiles should be different since these mutations affect virus proteins that are functionally unrelated. However, our results suggest that the effects on the overall virus-host interaction of each mutant are canalized in the same way. This clearly exemplifies that viral fitness, despite its incompleteness, is a figure that contains high information about the virus-host interaction.

Together, these results suggest that positively correlated DEGs play a role in the transcriptional regulation of host defenses. By contrast, DEGs with negative correlation between expression and TEV fitness participate more in catalytic and transport activities than genes with positive correlation, suggesting a redirection of resources by the host to face the viral infection, which is not independent of viral fitness. VQ29 is a negative transcriptional regulator of light-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation that likely promotes the transcriptional activation of phytochrome interacting factor 1 (PIF1) during early seedling development, participates in the jasmonic acid-mediated (JA) plant basal defense and the VQ proteins interact with WRKY transcription factors 43 .

FDM1 is an SGS3-like protein that acts in RNA-directed DNA methylation participating in the RNA silencing defense pathway 50 . GBSS1 is involved in glucan biosynthesis and responsible of amylase synthesis essential for plant growth and other developmental processes 51 . Relative expression data were calculated using the DDC T method normalized by each one of the two reference genes and then averaged. Finally, to make expression data by both methods (microarray readings and RT-qPCR) readily comparable, they were both transformed into z- For each gene, the right plot shows both expression z-scores as a function of TEV fitness; solid lines represent the best linear fitting between normalized expressions and TEV fitness. In this representation, the more overlap between the two regression lines, the better the agreement between both quantitative methods. In this representation, VQ29 and ADK2 show the largest departure between both regression lines, thought even in these extreme cases, the difference was not large enough as to be significant in a non-parametric Wilcoxon's signed ranks test (P ³ 0.499 in all nine cases) or in a Student's t-test for the comparison of regression coefficients (P ³ 0.285). Thus, we conclude that, at least for the sample of genes here analyzed, the observed correlations between host's gene expression and viral fitness are consistent for both experimental methods used to evaluate the levels of gene expression.

Plant-virus interactions result from the confrontation of two players with opposed strategies and interests. From the plant perspective, activation of basal defenses, immunity, hormone-regulated pathways, and RNA-silencing (some of which are not virusspecific) will result in an immediate benefit to control virus replication and spread. We found that there are plant's defense responses that are expressed upon infection regardless the fitness of the virus, and defense responses induced progressively as viral fitness increases. Consistent with the first mode, we observed the activation of the genes EDS1 and PAD4, components of R genemediated disease resistance with homology to lipases, in every infection studied in this work (Fig.   8A ). These are master regulators of plant defenses that connect pathogen signals with salicylic acid (SA) signaling 53 . SA is involved in resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogens, and in particular viruses 54, 55 . Consistent with the second mode, we observed the activation of many genes involved in defenses in an extent that is proportional to TEV fitness (Fig. 8A ). For example, the DCL2 and AGO1 genes -key for the RNA silencing response-, genes modulating resistance to pathogens such as the subtilisin-like protease (SBT1.9), or genes expressing proteins involved in hormone-regulated defenses such as GASA1 and VQ29, brassinosteroids (e.g., brassinosteroid However, these activations have a cost, mainly in terms of resources that can be invested into secondary metabolism and development. Consistent with this idea is the fact that many genes participating in metabolic processes (e.g., CYSC1, a cysteine synthase) are highly repressed upon infection (Fig. 8A ). There are also central genes for the plant metabolism whose repression correlates with viral fitness, such as GBSS1, photosystem components or assembly factors (e.g., HCF136) , Rubisco subunits and ATPases, catalases, transketolases, nucleotide and phosphate transporters, synthases involved in flavonoid, isoprenoid, ascorbate, or tryptophan biosynthesis, and GAPDH (Fig. 7) .
