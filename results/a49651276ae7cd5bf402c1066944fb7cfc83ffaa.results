An in vivo quantitative assay for TuMV intercellular movement A recombinant tobacco etch virus (TEV) (genus Potyvirus) engineered to express the reporter protein b-glucuronidase (GUS) allowed direct observation of virus spread in leaves [34] . Virus spread is influenced by the rates of virus RNA replication and virus intercellular movement. Hence, the use of the above TEV-GUS construct to fully interpret results from virus spread studies is limited since virus replication in live tissue cannot be quantitated through GUS staining. In order to discriminate initially infected cells from later infected cells in live tissue, we introduced within the T-DNA borders of a binary vector a gene cassette expressing the ER-localized GFP-HDEL adjacent to a TuMV infectious genome cassette expressing 6K 2 :mCherry (Fig. 1A) . Since both gene cassettes are delivered to the same cells and GFP-HDEL does not move between cells [28] , primary infected cells should display concomitant green and red fluorescence while secondary infected cells should display red-only fluorescence. This system also allows differentiation between virus RNA replication and virus intercellular movement. A single infiltration with an A. tumefaciens suspension containing the above plasmid was performed on leaves of three-week old N. benthamiana plants, resulting in an agroinfiltrated area of 5-10 mm in diameter (Fig. 1B) . Fluorescence emitted by GFP-HDEL was generally observed at approximately 36 hrs post infiltration (hpinf) and mCherry fluorescence resulting from TuMV replication was detected at approximately 60 hpinf. Systemic TuMV infection was observed at 4-5 days post infiltration (dpinf) in leaves above the infiltrated one by Western blot analysis using a rabbit serum against the CP of TuMV (data not shown). A similar systemic movement was obtained when more dilute agrobacterium suspensions (e.g. 0.01-0.001) were infiltrated, indicating the bacterial load did not elicit a plant defense response that might have affected virus infection rate. N. benthamiana cells displayed the expected green polygonal ER pattern and virus-induced 6K 2tagged red vesicles (Fig. 1C) . Virus intercellular movement was assayed by observing red and green fluorescence at the perimeter of the infiltrated area. At 72 hpinf, a majority of cells in the infiltrated area emitted both green and red fluorescence and just a few red-only cells were observed (Fig. 1D) , indicating that viral movement was just starting. Viral movement was followed in the same agroinfiltrated region at 4, 5, and 6 dpinf ( Fig. 1E-G) . At the end of the observation period, the surface area of green fluorescence did not changed, indicating that GFP-HDEL did not moved into neighboring cells. Intercellular movement of fluorescent signal was also followed by observing spread of green and red fluorescence for 17 consecutive hours starting at 72 hpinf in order to evaluate the rate of cell-to-cell movement. This was achieved by securing an infiltrated leaf still attached to the plant on the confocal
