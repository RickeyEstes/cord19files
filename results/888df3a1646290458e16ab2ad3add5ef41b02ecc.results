Twenty-five species of bats belonging to the Rhinolophidae (N = 8), Hipposideridae (N = 8), Emballonuridae (N = 1), Molossidae (N = 1), Megadermatidae (N = 2), Pteropodidae (N = 2), Miniopteridae (N = 1) (Table 1) , Craseonycteridae (N = 1) and Vespertilionidae (N = 1) families were sampled. Species were identified using morphological and acoustic characters. A total of seven samples among 552 (265 feces, 97 urine collections and 190 oral swabs), were positive using the RT-PCR on the RdRp region described in the material and methods section. This amount rose to 28 when the results from the second sampling at the study site 17 were included (Table 1 and Fig. 1B) . All of the positive samples came from two species: Hipposideros larvatus ( Fig. 2A) and Hipposideros armiger (Fig. 2B) . Two new viruses were detected in this study but the isolation trials on cell cultures remained unsuccessful: no cytopathic effect was observed after three passages on cell cultures and no viral material was amplified from the third passage supernatants with the semi-nested PCR described in material and methods.
