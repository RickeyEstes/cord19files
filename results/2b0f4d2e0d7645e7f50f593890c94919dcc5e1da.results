There were 922 children (56% male) with confirmed influenza during the study period. 557 had non-pandemic influenza A, 179 had influenza B, and 186 had influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, out of whom 93 belonged to the 2009-2010 pandemic. During all winter seasons there were influenza epidemics with varying severity. All but two influenza epidemics occurred during RSV epidemics after January 1 and there were then always more children with RSV during a given week (Fig. 1 ). The two largest outbreaks 2003-2004 and 2009-2010 peaked before January 1 and preceded the RSV epidemics. Influenza B was present in all but two seasons and dominated during three seasons, all of which occurred during the second half of the study period. Co-infections (with any simultaneously circulating respiratory virus) were identified in 11% of the patients. This is a minimum figure, since some children, for instance those with a positive point-of-care test for RSV, were not examined for additional viral etiology such as influenza. When the period comprising the first eight seasons was compared with the second period, excluding the pandemic and thus also comprising eight seasons, there were significantly more cases of influenza B during the latter period (p < 0.01). However, the overall rate of influenza cases in children <17 years remained unchanged at 22.5 (95% C.I. 20.1-24.9) and 24.2 (21.9-26.5) per 10 5 person years, respectively. The cumulative age distribution is shown in Fig. 2 . Children with influenza B were older (as also shown in Table 1 ) than those with influenza A. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 is presented separately for the pandemic year 2009-2010 and the post pandemic years, since the pandemic patients were significantly older (p < 0.001). The yearly incidence rates in different age groups varied considerably, with median (range) for children <5 years 59 (19- Previously known risk factors were found in 312/922 (34% ,  Table 1 ), the most important being neuromuscular disease (131 cases) and chronic lung disease (40 cases). The frequencies of recurrent wheezing (not included among risk factors) and preterm birth were comparable to their occurrence in the general child population at 6% and 2.6% (24/922), respectively. Complications were seen in 380/922 (41%). Most were related to the respiratory tract where pneumonia dominated (117) out of which half (58) were considered bacterial in origin. Other bacterial superinfections, such as sinusitis (including periorbital cellulitis) were diagnosed in 22 children. Approximately 50% of the children had a blood culture taken, which was positive in 12 (6 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 3 Staphylococcus aureus, 2 Streptococcus pyogenes and 1 Neisseria meningitidis). Neurological complication was the second most common with encephalitis (33) and primary or secondary seizures (104). Risk factors and complications were more common among children with influenza B than in those with influenza A in the univariate analysis (p < 0.05), but when included with age in the multivariate model, only age remained significant (p < 0.001, Table 2 ). Children with recurrent wheezing had a low rate (1/59) of PICU admission. Their median duration of hospital stay was 2 days, which is equal to that of other children without risk factors. Intensive care admission was required for 105/922 children (11%); 41/610 (6.7%) without risk factors and 57/171 (33%) with neuromuscular or chronic lung disease (p < 0.001). Two children were treated with ECMO. Six children (0.17/10 5 person years) died, 1 <1 year, 2 1-9 years, and 3 >10 years old. Three of these were previously healthy, whereof two had an influenza B infection. The causes of death were encephalitis, myocarditis and bacterial pneumonia in the previously healthy children, and non-specific complications in the three children with co-morbidity.
