Neuroimaging on a 3 T scan displayed noteworthy atrophy of the medulla and of the spinal cord (Fig. 1A ). Brain MRI also revealed a diffuse white matter disease (Fig. 1B) . Hyperintense white matter abnormalities on T2 and FLAIR sequences were present in the medulla and pons, in the pyramidal tracts and the medial lemniscus (Fig. 1B) . In the cerebral hemispheres, white matter lesions were symmetric and confluent, affecting the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital areas. The external capsule and the posterior limb of the internal capsule were also affected while the anterior limb was spared (Fig. 1B) . The abnormal white matter areas had normal or hypointense signal on T1-weighted images (data not shown). In addition, there was diffuse cortical and subcortical atrophy, mild vermian atrophy and thin corpus callosum (data not shown). None of the white matter lesion showed contrast enhancement. This pattern suggested APBD due to GBE deficiency. At autopsy, numerous PB were observed in the myoepithelial cells of the sweat glands, the cardiac and diaphragmatic myocytes, and in the sural nerve (Supplementary Figs. 1A, B, C and D) . Of note, PB were relatively more abundant in the diaphragm than in limb muscles. In the sural nerve, PB appeared surrounded by LFB, compatible with their localization in Schwann cells rather than in axons ( Supplementary  Fig. 2 ), but were not found in serial semi-thin sections. Externally, the cerebrum and brainstem were normal. By contrast, the spinal cord was severely and globally atrophic ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . Examination of the brain sections showed atrophy of the corpus callosum associated with grayish discoloration of the white matter with sparing of the U fibers, particularly in the frontal lobes. PB were present in all examined cerebral regions, within both the white and gray matters, central gray nuclei, cerebellum and brainstem. They were particularly abundant in the hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. 4) . PB were localized within the astrocytes, particularly in the astrocytic endings, as shown with anti-GFAP and anti-AQP4 immunostaining ( Figs. 2A and B) . By contrast, no PB were found in other cell types of the CNS, such as neurons (Fig. 2C) , oligodendrocytes (Fig. 2D ) or microglia (data not shown). PAS stain performed on NF immunolabeled sections confirmed the absence of PB in neurons (data not shown). Electron microscopy confirmed the exclusive astrocytic localization of PB (Fig. 3) . PB were associated with white matter pallor, diffuse microglial activation and astrogliosis. Axonal loss and swelling suggested degeneration rather than demyelination (Figs. 2C and D) . Likewise, the diffuse white matter disease hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI images seen in the patient reflected this concurrent myelin and axonal loss. Examination of the spinal cord showed many PB in the gray and white matter, but sparing of motor neurons ( Supplementary Fig. 5) . Enzymatic studies displayed a significant reduction of the branching enzyme compared to healthy controls. A concurrent normal control was also sampled and analyzed on that same day confirming a reduced GBE activity in the patient's leukocytes -1.01 U/g protein for the control vs 0.22 U/g for the patient. Molecular studies identified 2 compound heterozygote mutations in the GBE1 gene: (i) p.H319Y mutation (c.955C>T) in exon 7, a mutation already identified in an antenatal GSD IV presentation (R. Froissart, unpublished data) and (ii) p.G353A mutation (c.1058G>C) in exon 8, a missense mutation not previously reported. These 2 mutations were likely pathogenic since they affect conserved residues of the GBE protein, are predicted to alter protein function (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/) and are absent from control sequences (http://browser.1000genomes.org/index.html and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP).
