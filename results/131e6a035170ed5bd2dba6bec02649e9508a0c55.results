Overexpression of PTEN ameliorates CIA development. To determine whether PTEN had anti-arthritic effect, CIA induced mice were injected with either PTEN overexpression or mock vector once weekly. PTEN overexpression significantly downregulated the severity of arthritis in CIA induced mice (Fig. 1A) . The concentrations of total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a in the serum were significantly decreased in mice injected with PTEN overexpression compared to mock group (Fig. 1B) . PTEN overexpression significantly reduced the degree of inflammation, bone damage, and cartilage damage (Fig. 1C) . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that injection with PTEN overexpression vector significantly suppressed the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and osteoclastogenesis related factor such as RANKL and TRAP in joints compared to CIA mice treated with mock vector (Fig. 1D,E) . Our results suggested that PTEN overexpression could suppress CIA severity, thus reducing inflammatory response and osteoclastogenesis in joint.
