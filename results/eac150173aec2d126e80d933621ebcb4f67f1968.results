(a) Analysis of radiolabeled mouse hepatitis virus proteins MHV A59 was grown in the presence of 3H-labeled sugars or 14C-labeled protein hydrolysate, and purified virus preparations were analyzed by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 FIN:. I. Incorporat,ion of radioact~iw amino acids (14C) and sugars (3H) into coronavirus A59 polypeptides. Coronavirus A59 was grown in the 17 clone 1 line of spontaneously transformed RalbC3T3 cells in the presence of radioactive markers as indicated. Virus was harvested 30 h post infection. purified and analyzed on cylindrical SDS-containing lOo,b (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Gels were sliced and radioactivity of the resolved polypeptides (indicated in (a)) determined by liquid scint,illation counting. ( Fig. l(a) ). The periph era1 spike glycoprotein E2 (M, 180,000) and its proteolytic J& 90,000 cleavage products were poorly labeled. This is probably due to partial loss of spike peplomers during virus purification, which is a common observation with coronaviruses. The analqrsis of MHV labeled with the radioactive sugars 16-3H Iglucosamine. [ l-3H]galactose. [l-3H]fucose and 12-3H lmannose showed t'hat each of these sugars is present in E2. This was not' unexpected, since this carbohydrate pattern is found in many other viral glycoproteins. El, however, was not labeled with either fucose or mannose (Fig. l(d) and (e)). The absence of mannose is significant, since mannose is an essential constituent of the carbohydrat,e core structures of N-glycosidically linked side-chains. The radioactive band in Figure 1 (b) and (c) migrating faster than glycoprotein El is probably glycolipid. This is suggested by the observations that this material is not labeled by amino acids, mannose or fucose, and that it is removed from the gel after fixation with organic solvents, such as isobutanol (Fig. 2) . In order t)o investigate whether the presence of Fl with its abnormal labeling characteristics is unique for the murine coronavirus A59 or a general coronavirusspecific phenomenon. we have also analyzed the glycosylat,ion pattern of the enteropathogenic bovine coronavirus L9 grown in primary bovine fetal thyroid cells (Storz et al.. 1981a,6; Fig. 2) . A low molecular weight glycoprotein comigrating with the murine El in SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was present in the bovine virus preparations. This polypeptide readily aggregated to material of high molecular weight when boiled in the presence of reducing agents (data not shown), as does glycoprotein El of the murine virus (Sturman, 1977) . Metabolic labeling indicat'ed that El of the bovine virus could again be labeled only with galact'ose and glucosamine but not with fucose or mannose. (b) Labeling with ["H]palmitic acid In order to investigate whether glycoprotein El purified by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was possibly contaminated with tightly bound glycolipids, we analyzed A59 virus grown in the presence of [3H]palmitic acid. Figure 3 shows that El was not labeled under these conditions. Thus, glycolipid contamination could be excluded. However, significant amounts of label were incorporated into glycoprotein E2 and its proteolytic cleavage products. Therefore. it appears that E2 contains covalently bound fatty acids.
