Also in Fig. 1 , cocaine (10 mg/kg IP) simultaneously and significantly increased the in vivo electrochemical signal for 5-HT, F(2, 10) = 14.135,p < 0.0012,N = 6. Post hocanalysis further shows that there were statistically significant differences from baseline in the first hour of study (Fisher PLSD = 6.048, Scheffe F = 13.125 and 0.886, first and second hours respectively). 5-HT was significantly increased to 108°7o (p < 0.05, 95070 CL) over baseline (100070) within 10 rain and was maximally increased to 123070 (p < 0.05, 950 CL) over baseline within 40 min after cocaine administration. Moreover, cocaine's colocaiized effects on DA and 5-HT release in vlNAcc were significantly and positively correlated in the first hour of study (Pearson product: r<a) = 0.833, z = 1.1881, p < 0.01). Interestingly, exact coincident points occurred at the 10-rain and 40-min marks of the time course study after (IP) cocaine administration. Figure 2 shows the concurrent effect of cocaine (10 mg/kg IP) on the frequency (number) of ambulations (locomotor activity) in the same group of animals in which neurochemistry was assayed. Cocaine (10 mg/kg IP) significantly increased the frequency of ambulations, F(2, 10) = 27.502, p < 0.0001, N = 6). Post hoc analysis further shows that there were statistically significant differences from baseline in the first hour of the two hours tested (Fisher PLSD = 193.583, Scheffe F = 26.852 and 3.581, first and second hours respectively). Thus, cocaine's effects on hyperactive behavior progressively declined in the second hour of study with the exception of the 90-rain mark of the time course, at which time ambulatory behavior abruptly rose and then fell. Frequency of ambulations was significantly increased to 943 + 130 photobeam interruptions (p < 0.05, 95070 CL) from a baseline of 187 + 35 within 10 min, and maximally increased to 1070 + 124 photobeam interruptions (p < 0.05, 9507o CL) within 20 rain after cocaine administration. Figure 3 shows the concurrent effect of cocaine (10 mg/kg IP) on the frequency (number) of rearings. Cocaine (10 mg/ kg IP) significantly increased the rearing frequency, F(2, 10) = 15.749, p < 0.0008, N = 6. Furthermore, post hoc analysis shows that there were statistically significant differences Post hoc analysis further shows that there were statistically significant differences from baseline in the first hour of the two hours tested (Fisher PLSD = 10.532, Scheffe F = 18.402 and 2.486, first and second hours respectively). Cocaine's effects on stereotypy dissipated in the second hour of study with the exception of the behavior seen at the 90-min mark which abruptly rose and momentarily fell. Frequency of fine movements was significantly increased to 38 ± 4 photobeam interruptions (p < 0.05, 95%0 CL) from a baseline of 5 + 2 within 10 min and was maximally increased to 39 + 6 (p < 0.05, 95%0 CL) within 50 rain after cocaine administration. Figure 4 shows the concurrent effect of cocaine (10 mg/kg IP) on the frequency (number) of central ambulations. Cocaine (10 mg/kg IP) significantly increased the frequency of central ambulations, F(2, 10) = 8.074, p < 0.0082, N = 6). Post hoc analysis further shows that there were statistically significant differences from baseline in the first hour of the two hours tested (Fisher PLSD --2.751, Scheffe F = 7.949 and 1.216, first and second hours respectively). Cocaine's effects on central ambulations were completed during the second hour. However, at the 90-min point of the time course, central ambulatory behavior underwent a transient rise and fall, not unlike its previous pattern but very similar to the pattern of the ambulatory, rearing, and stereotypic fine movement behavior seen in Figs. 2 and 3 . Frequency of central ambulations was significantly increased to 3 + 1 photobeam interruptions (p < 0.05, 95%e CL) from a baseline of 0 + 0.04 within 10 rain and maximally increased to 9 + 5 (p < 0.05, 95% CL) within 50 min after cocaine administration. Increased DA release in vlNAcc after cocaine administra-tion was significantly and positively correlated with classically DA-dependent behaviors (first-and second-hour effects) (Pearson product: re,) > 0.651, zf > 0.7753, p < 0.01) and with the 5-HT-ergic behavior, central ambulations (Pearson product: r(,) = 0.606, zf < 0.7089, p < 0.01). Cocaineinduced 5-HT release was significantly and positively correlated with the 5-HT behavior (Pearson product: r(,) = 0.595, zf < 0.6931, p < 0.01). However, classically DA-dependent behaviors were significantly and more positively correlated with cocaine-induced 5-HT release in vlNAcc than with DA release throughout the two-hour period of study (Pearson product: r¢o) > 0.732, zf > 0.9287,p < 0.01). Provocatively, the noted abrupt rise and fall in each of the cocaine-induced psychostimulant behaviors occurred when 5-HT release underwent a divergence in direction from concurrent DA release. Interestingly, the Pearson product-moment coefficient of correlation tests show that DA and 5-HT release were highly and positively correlated with classically DA-dependent behaviors up to the 90-rain mark, r(,) > 0.697, zf > 0.8673,p < 0.01. Preliminary results from studies of the immediate aftereffects of acute (IP) cocaine show that 5-HT release continues to increase after the two-hour period of study at a time during which DA release begins to decrease and cocaine-induced psychostimulant behaviors have begun to reach completion. rons in At0 circuits are co-mediated by 5-HT. The data are consistent with a proposed 5-HT involvement in drug discrimination (15) , in self-administration (13, 39, 40, 49) , and in the endocrine effects of cocaine (38) . Importantly, vlNAcc is a neuroanatomicaUy specific site of NAcc, for which a reciprocal connection with the midlateral (i.e., the middle rostro-caudal VTA) has been shown with anterograde and retrograde tract tracing studies (19, 59, 60) . Using light microscopic immunocytochemistry and silver intensification procedures, with anterograde and retrograde tracing tract studies, we have found in vlNAcc a core which contains a dense terminal field of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)that is, TH-IR axons that have an extensive overlap with 5-HT-IR axons in the periphery within the core (45) . Thus, a DA-5-HT-ergic interaction may play a critical role in cocaine's manipulation of the compensatory negative feedback pathway between vlNAcc and VTA in the A10 circuit. A likely scenario mechanistically for enhanced 5-HT release in vlNAcc after (IP) cocaine, may be compensatory negative feedback due to decreased 5-HT cell firing in DR (16, 17) . Alternatively, a cocaine-induced 5-HT reuptake inhibition, combined with the increased release of 5-HT at vlNAc¢, may stimulate autoreceptors that act presynaptically at 5-HT somatodendrites to decrease DR cell firing. Interestingly, studies which have not tested cocaine effects on biogenic amines but have tested 5-HT-erglc effects on DA neurons per se have shown that 5-HT stimulates DA neurons in NAcc (14, 32, 43) and in VTA (1). In addition, interactive effects by 5-HT on NAcc DA neurons by VTA (28) and by dorsal raphe (DR) (27, 30) have been reported. Taken together, the present data suggest that cocaine reward and/or dysfunction may derive from a malfunctioning of this dual biogenic amine system. Whether or not reward-relevant synaptic contacts are made may actually be a separate consideration. Notably, the present results are different from the effects of (SC) cocaine on 5-HT release in vlNAcc, in the same para-digm (6) , and are similar to the effect of (IV) cocaine on 5-HT-ergic release in vlNAcc, in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized rat paradigm (9) . Thus, the present data demonstrate, consistent with others (37) , that the route of administration for cocaine administered acutely is a crucial factor in its consequent effects. Also, the data demonstrate that anesthesia does not significantly influence the 5-HT-erglc response to cocaine (9) . Real time detection of DA and 5-HT release in vlNAcc in the conscious animal provides an excellent tool for studying the nature of the "classically DA-dependent" and 5-HT-ergic psychostimulant behaviors induced by cocaine. Psychostimulant behaviors have been termed dysfunctional, nonadaptive, composite aggregates of subsystems which mediate movement along independent spatial dimensions (61) . In this view, psychostimulant behaviors occur as a result of the initial activation and then deactivation of DAerglc systems. However, in another view, the neurotransmitter DA functions in mesolimbic and nigrostriatal neuronal circuitry differentially; locomotor activity is primarily controlled by NAcc (ventral striatum) and stereotypic fine movements are primarily controlled by dorsal striatum (51) . Placing the present findings within the latter framework, cocaine induced an increase in DA release in vlNAcc that was correlated as expected with cocaine-induced increased locomotor activity. Correspondingly, cocaine-induced maladaptive rearing behavior and stereotypic fine movement behavior were correlated with increased DA release as well. This response too was expected (i.e., based on the postulated partial mediation of these behaviors by NAcc). Also, predictably, the behavioral profiles for the classically DA-dependent behaviors (running, rearing, and fine movement behaviors) are remarkably similar. Indeed, the behaviorai profiles for rearing and fine movement are superimposable, differing only in degree, thereby supporting the concept of rearing as a simple vertical extension of a maladaptive head movement (61) . Nonetheless, the present data show that the ebb and flow of each of the cocaine-induced classically DA-dependent behaviors were also dramatically correlated with the neurotransmitter 5-HT. Therefore, the present behavioral data further support a contributory role for 5-HT in the underlying mechanism of action of cocaine. That cocaine has the capability of showing anti-agoraphobic inhibitory characteristics in the "central ambulations" paradigm is also consistent with its 5-HT-ergic effects. In conclusion, the present studies show that 5-HT may signal or precede the DAergic events associated with the wellknown acute cocaine-induced DAergic dysfunction in Al0 neuronal circuits. Interpretation of these results appears to parallel the "modulatory model" of brain reward. More importantly though, the data may bear relevance to aspects of chronic cocaine abuse such as those described in the Opponent Process Theory (35, 36, 57) . Perhaps 5-HT may serve as a putative regulator during addictive and withdrawal processes.
