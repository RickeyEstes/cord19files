Of 358 papers identified after de-duplication (Fig. 2) , 25 (reporting on 25 studies) met our inclusion criteria with 97 % inter-reviewer agreement (Additional file 4: Appendix D). Studies investigated one or more of the following: the possibility of transmission regardless of direction (12 studies) [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] ; the direction of transmission (9 studies) [13, 14, 16, 18, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] ; the nature of TB recurrences (4 studies) [18, 24, 29, 30] ; within-host strain diversity in the context of transmission (7 studies) [12, 13, 18, 21, [29] [30] [31] ; and the emergence of drug Fig. 2 PRISMA flowchart. *Includes one additional study that was found through reference list screening. M.tb, Mycobacterium tuberculosis; TB, tuberculosis; WGS, whole genome sequencing resistance (6 studies) [23, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . These studies encompassed a wide range of populations (ages, ethnicities, comorbidities), countries with varying TB burdens and differing dominant lineage.
