Glycyrrhizinic acid induced potent cytotoxic effects and inhibited colony forming tendency MTT assay as well as clonogenic assays revealed that glycyrrhizinic acid (Figure 1 ) could induce significant cytotoxic effects as well as inhibitory effects against colony formation. The results, which are depicted in Figure 2 , showed that glycyrrhizinic acid led to concentration-dependent as well as time-dependent growth inhibitory effects in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Clonogenic assay showed that different doses of glycyrrhizinic acid had a tendency to inhibit or suppress the colony formation tendency of these MCF-7 breast cancer cells. It was also observed that this tendency of this naturally occurring compound was enhanced with increase of the dosage to which these cells were exposed (Figures 3 A, B) . Thus glycyrrhizinic acid has a dual effect -one on cell viability and another on colony formation.
