The mini-mRNA used in this study contains the initiation re,on of bacteriophage A gene cro and the p-independent terminator of transcription of fd phage [10] . Its secondary structure is shown in Fig. 1 . The predicted folding of the mini-mRNA has been confirmed by enzymatic probing (unpublished) and by chemical modification (this paper). The structure of this mRNA has several important features which, taken together, are not found in mRNAs used by other investigators. It starts by the AUG codon which is not functional under natural conditions of protein synthesis followed by a single-stranded sequence encompassing a very long (9 bp) SD-region. The true initiation codon (nt 19-21) is in the loop of the first short hairpin (nt 14-28) that is probably stabilized by a coaxial stacking interaction with the second longer hairpin encompassing positions 29-50. When using toeprint analysis [6] , cro-mini-mRNA reveals a normal stop at position + 16 from the natural initiation codon (+ 1 is the A residue of the initiation codon), in agreement with data of Hartz et al. [11] . This stop is not observed at all in the absence of tRNA, though the long SD-sequence of cro-mini-mRNA appears to provide rather stable binary binary complex is unclear and requires further investigations. Addition of tRNA to the 30S mRNA complex dramatically changes the pattern of chemical modification of bases situated downstream from the initiation codon. One can observe in this case the modification of U32, U38, U45, U46, U48 by CMCT (Fig. 3, lanes  3-4) , G43, G49 and, to some extent, G29 by kethoxal (Fig. 3, lanes 3-4) and C30 and A31 by DMS (Fig. 2,  lanes 3-5 ) . One should stress that the protection of the SD-sequence in the binary and tertiary complexes is similar (Fig. 2, lanes 2-5 and Fig. 3, lanes 2-4) and, hence, the amount of mRNA complexed with 30 S subunits cannot differ appreciably in these cases. Thus, all these data summarized in Fig.4 give a strong evidence that the helix 29-35/43-50 unwinds in the course of formation of the 30SmRNAtRNA complex. Unfortunately, we cannot judge with certainty about conformational changes within the initiation hairpin mRNA-ribosome complexes (see below). The only possible interpretation of this disagreement is that reverse transcdptase dislodges the 30 S subunit from mRNA in the absence of tRNA. As seen in Fig. 2 , lanes 2-5, addition of 30 S subunits to cro-mini-mRNA results in a considerable protection from DMS of SD-bases, particularly, that of A9 and A12. The same is true for the extent of modification by CMCT of U20 (Fig. 3, lanes 2-4) , the second base of the initiation codon. The modification of nucleotides downstream from the initiation codon and upstream from SD-sequence does not change for the 30S mRNA complex as compared to a free mRNA. Thus, only the accessibility of SD-sequence and the AUG codon decreases in the course of formation of the binary 30S mini-mRNA complex.
