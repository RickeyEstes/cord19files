Four separate multiplex PCR assays were designed to amplify selected genetic targets from BRDC-associated viruses, BRDC-associated bacteria, BED-associated viruses, and BED-associated bacteria and protozoa, respectively (Table 1) . Each assay was successfully validated using a panel of laboratory isolates of target (Table 3 ) and related nontarget pathogens (Supplementary Table 1 ). PCR using each primer panel specifically amplified intended size PCR products that ranged from 203-584bp (Fig. 1) . There was no detectable amplification when non-target pathogens were used as templates. In addition to the targetspecific primers, primers for DENV internal control were also included in each panel (Fig. 1) . Simultaneous inclusion of all relevant targets and the internal control in each assay generated multiple bands of expected sizes respectively (Fig. 1) . 2 Oliver Lung, unpublished. BVDV 1, 2, Hobi virus, pestivirus common and BCoV probes are present in both Respiratory and Enteric Virus panels.
