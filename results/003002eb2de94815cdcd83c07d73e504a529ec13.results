The study group comprised 6 men and 2 women, with a mean age of 50 years (range, 29 to 68 years). Seven patients were Asian, and 1 was Indian. One patient had diabetes mellitus (case 2). Clinically, all patients met the World Health Organization case definition for suspected or probable SARS. 8 Presenting symptoms included fever in 8 patients (100%), cough in 4 (50%), shortness of breath in 3 (38%), myalgia in 3 (38%), and diarrhea in 2 (25%). The time from the onset of symptoms to death ranged from 4 to 20 days (mean, 12 days). The Defense Medical Research Institute and Singapore General Hospital found SARS-CoV RNA in 7 of 8 cases. SARS-CoV was detected in 8 of 8 (100%) cases as tested by RT-PCR on postmortem formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung by the AFIP, Division of Molecular Pathology; 1 of these cases was determined to be negative in the Singapore laboratory. Histological features are summarized in Table 1 . Based on duration of illness, several patterns emerge. Cases of shorter duration (10 or fewer days) demonstrated histological features of acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), airspace edema, and bronchiolar fibrin. Cases of longer duration (more than 10 days) demonstrated features of organizing-phase DAD, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, multinucleated cells, and acute bronchopneumonia. The 1 exception to this pattern was case 2, who was a diabetic. In cases 1 through 4, cases of shortest duration, acute-phase DAD was present in all 4 (100%), airspace edema in all 4 (100%), and bronchiolar fibrin in 3 of 4 cases (75%). Characterized by hyaline membranes, interstitial and intra-alveolar edema, interstitial infiltrates of inflammatory cells, and vascular congestion (Fig 1) , acute-phase DAD involved 50% to 75% of the lung parenchyma and varied in grade from mild to marked. Moderate to marked airspace edema, evidenced by flocculent to solid patches of eosinophilic proteinaceous material within alveolar spaces, involved 50% to 100% of the parenchyma. Bronchiolar injury was demonstrated by collections of fibrin within lumens that were associated with loss of cilia, bronchiole epithelial denudation, and focal deposition of fibrin on exposed basement membranes (Fig 2) . Type II pneumocyte hyperplasia was present in only 1 of the 4 patients (25%) in this group. This light microscopy impression was supported by pancytokeratin immunostains, which demonstrated alveolar walls partially covered by hyaline membranes and lacking any type of epithelial lining cells. Hyaline membranes were pancytokeratin positive (Fig 3) . The course of illness was longer than 10 days in cases 5 through 8. Table 1 shows an inverse relationship between the features of early injury described above and those of organization/repair observed later in the course of illness. Organizing-phase DAD, characterized by interstitial and airspace fibroblast proliferation (Fig  4) , was accompanied by repair in the form of type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia in these 4 patients. Organizing-phase DAD was present in 3 (75%) patients, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia in 4 (100%), and squamous metaplasia in 4 (100%). Organizing-phase DAD involved 75% to 100% of the parenchyma and was graded as marked in the 3 cases affected. In contrast, only 1 patient (case 2) from the group with a shorter clinical course demonstrated organizing-phase DAD. In that instance, the percentage of parenchyma involved was 1% to 25%, and was mild. Some of the hyperplasic type II pneumocytes showed marked cytological changes, including cytomegaly, nucleomegaly, clearing of nuclear chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. Alveolar spaces contained a combination of macrophages, desquamated pneumocytes, and multinucleated cells. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of CD68-positive macrophages and pancytokeratin-positive/TTF-1-positive type II pneumocytes. Rare multinucleated cells appeared to be either macrophages with CD68 staining or type II pneumocytes with pancytokeratin and TTF-1 staining ( Fig  5) . No intranuclear or intracytoplasmic viral inclusions were identified. Whereas occasional pneumocytes and macrophages demonstrated fine cytoplasmic vacuoles, vacuolization was not a striking feature in these cases. The numbers of macrophages within alveolar spaces did not appear to be significantly different from the numbers typically seen in non-SARS organizing DAD. Hemophagocytosis was not identified. Acute bronchopneumonia developed in 4 (100%) patients with clinical courses longer than 10 days. Characterized by accumulations of neutrophils and macrophages within airways and alveoli (Fig 6) , the bronchopneumonia involved 50% to 75% of the parenchyma and varied from mild to marked. Sheetlike bacterial growth with areas of hemorrhage and vasculitis, characteristic of Pseudomonas pneumonia, was seen on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections in case 6. Brown-Hopps tissue gram stain demonstrated the presence of thin gram-negative rods, which correlated with postmortem cultures that grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Post-FIGURE 2. Loss of cilia, bronchiole epithelial denudation, and deposition of fibrin within the lumen and on exposed basement membranes signaled injury to small airways. Aspergillus formed a pseudomembranous and superficially invasive tracheitis (Fig 6) . However, these were the only foci of fungal infection in these cases. Immunohistochemistry for the viral agents adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein, and herpes simplex virus was negative in all 8 cases. The remaining histological features included parenchymal infarcts, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, and fi-brin thrombi. Although identified in this cohort, these features were present only in a small percentage of cases or were distributed without predilection for either a shorter or longer clinical course. Parenchymal infarcts were present in 2 of 8 (25%) patients, with both cases occurring in the group with clinical courses longer than 10 days. Intra-alveolar hemorrhage was present in 2 of the 4 (50%) patients with shorter illnesses and in 4 of the 4 (100%) patients with longer illnesses. Finally, fibrin thrombi, a common finding in DAD, were seen in the small pulmonary arteries of 2 of the 4 (50%) patients with shorter illnesses and in 3 of the 4 (75%) patients with longer illnesses.
