With the criteria of Enders', previously described, we found 29 viral respiratory infectious episodes in the patients with cystic fibrosis taken into the study. Infections with two different viral agents at the same time occurred twice: influenza A and adenovirus; influenza B and adenovirus. Multiple respiratory tract viral infections were found in seven patients with at least 5 months between the two episodes ( Table 1 ). An at least four-fold titer rise in the complement-fixation test was seen in 25 of the 29 viral infections, and in four cases the first serum samples showed significantly elevated antibody titers (Table 2 ). Influenza A virus was the most frequent serologically proven viral pathogen (11 x ), followed by adenovirus (8 x ), influenza B virus (5 x ), parainfluenza virus serotype 3 (3 x ), parainfluenza virus serotype 1 and RSV (each of 1 x ). We found no serological evidence for infections with influenza ,C virus, parainfluenza virus of the serotype 2, M. pneumoniae or C. burnetii. There was no significant difference between the age distribution of the cystic fibrosis group with and without viral infection of the upper airways (mean age 14.4* 5.4 compared with 16.0 f 5.6). Infections with parainfluenzae viruses seem to appear more frequently in younger children, whereas the prevalence of the other viral agents in the different age groups was similar to the age distribution of all cystic fibrosis patients (Table 3 ). There was no correlation between carriage of P. aeruginosa and viral infection. Viral infections in cystic fibrosis occur during the entire year (Table 4 ). Infections with influenza A and B viruses are most frequent in winter and spring in contrast to parainfluenzae viruses and adenovirus which peak during the summer period. Patients with cystic fibrosis and viral infections of the upper airways required more frequent hospital admission (P<O.OOl) and stayed there longer (P<O*OOl) than cystic fibrosis patients without proven serological conversion ( Table 5 ). The greatest part of the serologically proven viral infections (21/29) occurred at home (Table 6) and was accompanied by acute exacerbations of respiratory symptoms. Taking into account an incubation period of 1-7 days for the different viral agents and a period of l&20 days for serological conversion, 28% of the viral respiratory diseases may be hospitalacquired. Infections with parainfluenzae viruses and with RSV were seen only outside the hospital, while infections with influenza B virus and adenoviruses tended to occur in hospital. Three of the four adenovirus infections were probably nosocomial. Two of the three infections with influenza B virus in the hospital were seen at the same time in winter during an influenza B epidemic in Munich. Analysing the bacterial flora of the sputum in patients with cystic fibrosis we found S. pneumoniue to be as common in CF-patients with respiratory viral infections (l/l 8) as in those without any evidence of infection (5/57). In contrast to S. pneumoniae, H. in&enzae was more frequently detected in the sputum from CF-patients with viral infections of the upper airways (S/ 18 versus 3/57) (P < O-005). Deterioration of the clinical condition with pronounced cough, increased expectoration, loss of weight, reduction of lung function was observed in 78% of the cystic fibrosis patients during their viral infection ( Table 7) . The microbial flora of the sputum of the cystic fibrosis patients was unchanged, if the ratio of the number of colony forming units (cfus) per millilitre of the different bacterial or fungal species in the sputum after the viral infection to the number of cfus/per millilitre prior to their onset was smaller than 3.0 or greater than 0.33. At least a three- fold increase of cfus per millilitre of.sputum was found in 25/27 (93%) viral infections, mainly by P. aeruginosa (22/27; 82%) even in those cases without clinical deterioration (Table 7) . In two cases, as well as an increase of the number of cfus per millilitre of P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and H. influenzae appeared in the sputum, whereas in two other patients the only significant change was the detection of H. influenzae or S. aureus. In another case there was colonisation by a penicillin resistant strain of S. aureus. Where either S. aureus or H. infiuenzue was isolated from the sputum during the viral infections, this was most likely just prior to the acute exacerbation. The isolation rates of fungi in sputum samples during these acute exacerbations did not parallel the viral infection or the acute exacerbation. In 21/27 serologically evident viral diseases there was enough sputum to determine anti-P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide antibodies in paired sputum samples. O-Specific sIgA-antibodies showed an increase in 13 of the 21 (62%) viral respiratory tract infections. An increase of sIgA-antibodies in sputum was seen in both double infections in 2/2 infections due to parainfluenza virus serotype 3, in 4/5 (80%) infections with adenovirus, 214 (50%) infections with influenza B virus, and 317 (43%) with influenza A virus.
