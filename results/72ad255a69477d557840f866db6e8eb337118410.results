General characteristics and conditions during the outbreak Table 1 presents the study participants' general characteristics and conditions during the outbreak. There were 141 (45.1%) participants in the firsthand group and 172 (54.9%) in the secondhand group. Female nurses were predominant in both groups; only five male nurses were included in the study. The proportion of nurses aged !50 years was higher in the firsthand (7.1%) than in the secondhand (1.1%) group. While 12.8% of the secondhand group had two or more children, 29.8% of the firsthand group had two or more children. A significantly higher proportion of head nurses was included in the firsthand than in the secondhand group (15.6% vs. 2.9%, respectively, p < .001). Duty type differed significantly between the groups, with a lower proportion of 8-hour shift workers and a higher proportion of night-time only or full-time workers in the firsthand group. The hospital authorized type was significantly different between the groups (p ¼ .003). The proportion of participants who experienced isolation during the outbreak was significantly higher among the participants with close contact with MERS patients (p ¼ .031). The overall mean stress score of total study participants was 32.91. The mean stress scores of the firsthand and secondhand groups were 33.72 and 32.25, respectively (p ¼ .066). The overall mean professionalism score of all participants was 110.82 of 145. The overall mean scores for professionalism in nursing were significantly higher in the firsthand than in the secondhand group (103.00 vs. 98.99, respectively, p ¼ .001).
