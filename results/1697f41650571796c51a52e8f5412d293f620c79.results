Among 125 patients enrolled in this study, the multiplex panel was positive for at least one target in 28 (22%) NP specimens and 26 (21%) BAL samples. e majority (89%; (Tables 3 and 4 ). Twenty-seven (27%) of 100 ICH patients had at least one pathogen detected in the NP swab. Of these, 19/27 (70%) had the same pathogen(s) detected from the paired BAL specimen. e remaining 8 (30%) patients had a negative result in the paired BAL sample. e FARP was positive for at least one pathogen in 24 (24%) BAL specimens collected from ICH patients, and of these, 19/24 (79%) had the same pathogen detected in the paired NP swab sample. e remaining 5 (21%) patients had a negative result in the NP specimen (Table 3 ). In comparison with the FARP, the overall yield of other microbiology studies (e.g., routine bacterial, fungal and viral culture, and individual real-time PCR studies) on the BAL specimens was 29% (36/125) ( Table 5 ). In the ICH group, at least one microbiology study (not including FARP) was positive in 25% (25/100) of the BAL samples, compared to 24% (24/100) of BAL specimens being positive by the FARP. Among 32 ICH patients who had either a positive NP or BAL FARP, 10 (31%) had additional yield from routine (non FARP) microbiology studies. Among 68 ICH patients who had negative FARP results from both the NP swab and BAL, 16 (24%) had an organism identified by at least one of the routine microbiology tests (Table 5 ). In non-ICH patients, other microbiology studies were positive for at least one pathogen in 11/25 (44%) BAL specimens. e majority (92%; 23/25) of these patients had negative FilmArray results in both NP and BAL samples (Table 5 ). In the ICH group, the most common indication for bronchoscopy with BAL in our study was a radiographic infiltrate(s) on chest imaging (n � 83), followed by a diagnosis of pneumonia (n � 24), cough (n � 22), sepsis (n � 21),
