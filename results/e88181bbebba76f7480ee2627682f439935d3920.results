In vitro transcripts of HLSV full-length cDNA clones are infectious in Nicotiana benthamiana and the replication level of HLSV-7A is lower than that of HLSV-8A To study the replication of HLSV, a biologically active full-length cDNA clone has to be constructed. According to the HLSV complete genome sequence (GenBank Accession No. GI 113460144), primers were designated for construction of HLSV cDNA full-length clone. During cloning, we found that one of the clones, designated as pHLSV-7A, possessed a hepta-adenosine stretch, in contrast to an octoadenosine stretch of another clone at the position nt 2078, designated as pHLSV-8A (Fig. 1A) . The in vitro transcripts of HLSV-7A were able to replicate in Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts and infect N. benthamiana systemically by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1B ), although its RNA accumulation level was $ 5-fold lower than that of HLSV-8A, as determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis in transfected protoplasts (Fig. 1C) . Hepta-adenosine stretch in HLSV is the slippery sequence for À 1 PRF According to the deduced protein sequence of HLSV-7A, only a premature 78 kDa protein was translated from the 5′ replicase gene sequence. Since both replicase proteins of tobamoviruses are essential for efficient virus replication (Bao et al., 1996; Mizumoto et al., 2010; Ogawa et al., 1991) , we wondered how HLSV-7A was able to replicate without both functional replicases. Surprisingly, two additional bands, a clear 128 and a faint 184 kDa replicase proteins, were detected, in addition to the prominent 78 kDa protein in in vitro translation products using wheat germ extract. The level of the two additional proteins was much lower as compared to those generated from HLSV wild-type virions RNA (Fig. 2B ) and in vitro transcripts of HLSV-8A (Fig. 2C , first lane from the right). These two proteins must have been produced by À 1 PRF due to the absence of an adenosine residue at nt 2078 in HLSV-7A. To determine if the 7A stretch is the slippery sequence for À 1 PRF, two other HLSV mutated subclones pHLSV-AAGAAGA and pHLSV-AAGAAGAA, in which 7A and 8A stretches were mutated to nonslippery sequences AAGAAGA and AAGAAGAA, respectively, were constructed ( Fig. 2A) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The deduced À 1 PRF product 108 kDa protein was expected when pHLSV-7A was digested with BspHI (at nt 2940 of HLSV genome) (Fig. 2C , fourth lane from the right), as compared to the full-length 128 kDa protein produced in pHLSV-7A when digested with XhoI ( Fig. 2C , second lane from the right). If the 7A stretch is a slippery sequence, only a 78 kDa or a 108 kDa target protein will be produced from in vitro transcripts of HLSV-AAGAAGA or HLSV-AAGAAGAA. In vitro translation experiment showed that 78 kDa (Fig. 2C , second lane from the left) and 108 kDa proteins (Fig. 2C , third lane from the left) were detected from HLSV-AAGAAGAA and HLSV-AAGAAGA, respectively (Fig. 2C) . Therefore, we conclude that the 7A stretch is the slippery sequence for À 1 PRF in HLSV-7A. Immediate downstream pseudoknot of the 7A stretch in HLSV-7A is dispensable for À 1 PRF In most cases, slippery sequence and its immediate downstream RNA secondary structure are needed for efficient À 1 PRF (Brierley et al., 1989; Brierley and Pennell, 2001 ; Tsai et al., 1999). The immediate downstream 80 nt RNA sequence of the hepta-adenosine stretch of HLSV was analyzed with the online software KnotInFrame (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/kno tinframe) and a predicted 60 nt pseudoknot composed of 3 stems was obtained (Fig. 3A , the first panel from left). To investigate the function of the pseudoknot on À 1 PRF, the 3 stems were mutated partially or completely in pHLSV-7A (Fig. 3A ) and the pseudoknot structure was not detected using the software, when all three stems were mutated (data not shown). Similar level of À 1 PRF product, 128 kDa protein, was detected in each mutant, as compared to that in HLSV-7A, which indicates that the pseudoknot is not required for the À1 PRF in HLSV-7A (Fig. 3B , left panel). As expected, the 128 kDa protein was not detected in HLSV-7A-mS1 þmS2 þ mS3stop in which a stop codon was introduced into the third stem of the pseudoknot (Fig. 3B, right panel) .
