We identified 3619 records through literature search of which only 23 studies fulfilled our strict eligibility criteria (Figure 1 ) . Fifty-six studies were excluded for a variety of reasons including: no data specific to children under 5 years old (n=10), not fulfilling the case or control definitions (n=5), no applicable data reported for cases and controls (n=32) and other reasons (n=9). The 23 included studies were primarily conducted within developing countries (n=19) ( Table 1) . Among them, 4 unduplicated papers were from one research group in Thailand [20, 22, 24, 37] . And most of the studies have been conducted since 2003 (n=20). All included studies were case-control studies with an ALRI and asymptomatic/URTI groups; however some variations were still present. Of the case definitions employed, most used ALRI/ARI (n=13), while others used (severe) pneumonia (n=8), SARI (n=1) or bronchiolitis (n=1). All studies used control group which had no respiratory symptoms, of which 10 were considered otherwise "healthy", and 2 studies [23, 25] also reported URTI as control group. Of the case ascertainment used, all articles contained inpatient data. Among them, 3 studies also provided outpatient data [19, 21, 25] . Twenty controls were ascertained in hospital-based outpatient/clinic sites while 3 were identified in community [15, 17, 25] . Regarding to sampling methodology, most studies used nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) (n=10), nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) (n=6) and nasopharyngeal wash (NPW) (n=1) as specimen. Five studies used mixed specimens including NPA, NPS, lung aspirate and oropharyngeal swab (OPS). All studies used PCR as diagnostic testing except one study from Gambia [16] , in which case indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) was applied. Meta-analyses of virus-specific ORs were reported as well as the corresponding attributable fractions among the exposed ( Table 2) . RSV, IFV (including IFV A), PIV, MPV and RV were significantly more common in children hospitalized with ALRI than asymptomatic controls (OR (95% CI): 9.79 (4.98-19.27), 5.10 (3.19-8.14), 3.37 (1.59-7.15), 3.76 (2.45-5.78) and 1.43 (1.03-1.97), respectively). Thus, these viruses had statistically significant positive AFEs, which show clear associations between these viruses and ALRI hospitalization in young children. Therefore, this indicates the potential for substantive reductions in the number of ALRI cases were young children to be vaccinated against these viruses. In comparison, AdV, BoV and CoV were frequently detected in control children, and so did not have significantly positive AFEs. Therefore, their roles in ALRI hospitalisation were uncertain. Sensitivity analyses were also performed to investigate the effect of inclusion of symptomatic (URTI) controls, and of outpatient ALRI cases ( Table 2) . Data on inclusion of outpatient cases had little impact on the associations observed. However, this does not necessarily indicate similarity between the association of inpatient and outpatient ALRI patients. In comparison, the inclusion of symptomatic controls had a more substantial influence, which reduced the strength of association with every virus, except AdV and CoV-NL63.
