Nasal wash samples and clinical data were available for 893 children evaluated for a respiratory illness. Altogether, 776 of the samples (87%) were collected within 1 day of presentation. The majority of the children were hospitalized in the inpatient (n = 572, 64%) or the intensive care units (n = 111, 12%). An additional 23% (n = 205) were evaluated and discharged from the emergency room and 0AE6% from the outpatient clinics (n = 5). Three hundred and ninety-six (44%) children had at least one underlying chronic condition as identified by ICD-9 discharge diagnosis codes. The most common underlying condition was asthma (44%) followed by cardiac conditions (9%) ( Table 1 ). The median age in the study population was 16 months (interquartile range: 4-44 months). Children were evenly distributed among young infants experiencing their first respiratory virus season (0-5 months, n = 257), older infants and toddlers (6-23 months, n = 301), and preschool-aged and older children (24 months and older, n = 335). At least one virus was detected from 566 children (63% of study population). More than one virus was detected in 103 (18%) children, including 96 two virus infections and 7 three virus infections. Gender distribution was similar between children with single virus illnesses versus those with multiple virus illnesses. The majority of children with multiple virus illnesses were admitted to an inpatient, non-ICU ward (n = 64; 62%), followed by 37 children (36%) who were evaluated and discharged from the emergency room and 2 (2%) children who were admitted to the inpatient ICU. Prevalence of multiple virus illnesses was significantly associated with patient age in a non-linear fashion. Multiple viruses were more common in children aged 6-24 months (n = 58 ⁄ 301, 27%) compared with children 0-6 months of age (n = 18⁄ 257, 11%; P < 0AE001) and children aged 24 months or older (n = 27⁄ 335, 14%; P = 0AE001). RSV was the most frequently detected virus (n = 223; 25%) ( Figure 1 ). The most common combinations among the 96 dual viral infections were AdV ⁄ RSV (n = 24), RSV ⁄ CoV (n = 17), and AdV ⁄ Flu A (n = 14). CoV and AdV were most commonly detected simultaneously with other viruses (50% and 52%, respectively), while Flu A was the least likely to be detected with other viruses (20%) (Figure 1 ). PIV2, PIV4, and Flu B were not detected in any sample. AdV and PIV1 viral quantities (median log 10 copies ⁄ ml) were significantly reduced in samples from multiple virus illnesses compared with single virus illnesses, (4AE2 versus 5AE6, P = 0AE007 and 4AE2 versus 6AE9, P < 0AE001, respectively) ( Figure 2 ). In contrast, RSV, Flu A, PIV 3, and hMPV viral loads were consistently high whether or not another virus was detected. These results were generally not affected by adjustment for age and presence of chronic disease, with the exception of PIV3. In a subanalysis of children with underlying chronic conditions, PIV3 viral quantity was significantly lower in multiple virus illnesses than in single virus illnesses (5AE4 versus 8AE0, P < 0AE01) in this group. Children with single virus illnesses had higher rates of severe clinical disease compared with children with multiple virus infections. Children with multiple virus detections were less frequently admitted to the inpatient ward (OR = 0AE55; P = 0AE02) or to the intensive care unit (OR = 0AE22; P = 0AE04), required supplemental oxygen (OR = 0AE55; P = 0AE02), or required hospital stays longer than 3 days (OR = 0AE32; P = 0AE002) compared with the group of children with single viruses, controlling for age and the presence of an underlying chronic condition ( Table 2 ). These reduced risks among coinfected children were consistent among all three age groups evaluated (0-5, 6-23, 24 months and older), and age group did not significantly modify the effect of coinfection on patient outcome. Among children under 2 months of age, average respiratory rate in single virus illnesses was increased by 16 breaths per minute compared with children with multiple virus illnesses (95% CI: 7, 25; P = 0AE001). No differences were observed when comparing rates of antibiotic use, fever above 38°C, or abnormal radiographic findings. Virus-specific viral load was not associated with disease severity in this analysis.
