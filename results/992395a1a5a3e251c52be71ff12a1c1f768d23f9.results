Sixty-two animals completed histologic and physiologic testing (48 animals had some type of nerve repair or neurotization, 7 animals were left with unrepaired nerve transection, and 7 animals had skin incision only [sham]). One animal was euthanized because of a corona virus infection, and 2 animals expired during induction of anesthesia. These animals were from the initial 58 that were denervated, leaving 55 available for testing. Self-mutilation after denervation of the limb was observed in 1 rat and was treated with a restrictive neck collar for the first 2 days after surgery. There were no significant differences observed in weight gain between treatment cohorts. Electrodiagnostic characteristics observed demonstrated notable variability with placement of surface electrodes. This required repositioning of the recording electrode to yield an optimal CMAP with a definitive onset latency. Quantitative measurements of CMAP peak amplitude provided the most repeatable results. No muscle contraction or CMAP propagation after depolarization of the nerve was observed in 6 of 7 denervated control animals. One control animal demonstrated spontaneous axonal regeneration at the site of CP nerve transection despite use of suture ligature. Repair and neurotization animals both demonstrated decreased peak CMAP amplitude with increasing periods of denervation. On average, neurotization animals had significantly decreased peak amplitudes compared with those of repair animals (p ϭ .001). This difference was most notable at 8 weeks (8.8 mV Ϯ 1.5 vs 7.9 mV Ϯ 2.2, repair versus neurotization). With respect to contractile strength, animals in both neurotization and repair groups demonstrated significantly decreased force with prolonged periods of denervation (p Ͻ .001). Experimental limbs demonstrated peak contractile forces ranging from 0.8 N to 13.1 N. REPAIR animals had significantly improved motor strength recovery at 0 weeks denervation (94% Ϯ 30 vs 50% Ϯ 20, repair versus neurotization, p Ͻ .05; Fig. 2 ). The distinct advantage of repair over neurotization, however, was not observed after 8, 12, or 22 weeks of denervation. There was a significant effect of treatment group favoring the direct repair (p ϭ .001). A 2-factor ANOVA evaluating procedure ϫ time, however, demonstrated only a trend (p ϭ NS). Thus, our data suggest that both strategies have limitations, and although early direct repair appears to be more efficacious than is neurotization, this finding decreases with the chronicity of denervation. Additionally, we never encountered better than 50% muscle recovery of any of the specimens, indicating that an alternative interpretation of these results is that neither strategy is reliably or predictably effective. Comparisons of muscle mass tended to demonstrate similar results to both nerve conduction studies and contractile strength observations. Harvested TA muscles ranged from 0.4 g to 2.4 g. Muscle mass decreased with increasing chronicity of denervation (p Ͻ .001). On average, neurotized animals had decreased TA muscle mass compared with that of repaired animals, and there was a significant effect of treatment group favoring repair (p Ͻ .001). This difference was most notable at 8 weeks (68% Ϯ 3 versus 58% Ϯ 8, repair versus neurotization; Fig. 3 ). Muscle samples processed with hematoxylin-eosin stain revealed histologic evidence of chronic denerva-tion in the 8-, 12-, and 22-week groups. Samples demonstrated increased fatty infiltration, decreases in sarcomere size, and increased nuclear packing. The presence of acetylcholinesterase within neurotized individuals was confirmed by antibody staining of the TA muscle near the implantation site of the peripheral nerve graft. In addition, silver-based stain was used to confirm the presence of neurofilaments and the neuromuscular junction within neurotized individuals (Fig. 4) .
