Two hundred twenty children were evaluated in the emergency departments and enrolled into this study. A total of 144 children with inspiratory stridor and barking cough or hoarse voice formed the study group of croup children. Seventy-six control subjects had expiratory dyspnea caused by wheezing. There was no difference in sex, but the children with croup were younger than the control subjects (1.5 vs 1.9 years; t test P Ͻ .05). Children in both groups had elevated temperature at enrollment. In the emergency department, corticosteroid (Prednisolone, Leiras, Finland) was administered to 88% and inhaled racemic epinephrine (microNEFRIN, Bird comp. Palm Springs, Calif) to 87% of children with croup (Table I) . Overall 77% of the samples were found positive by PCR. The children with croup tested positive in 80% of the cases, the children with wheezing in 71% of the cases. The number of dual virus genomes in a single sample was as frequent among subjects with croup or wheezing (Table II) . For most of the tested viruses a seasonal difference was observed (Figure) . Rhinovirus and enterovirus genome was found more often in samples taken during the fall (September through November; 2 P Ͻ .01), influenza A and RSV were found in samples taken during the winter (December through February; 2 P Ͻ .01), and PIV was found in samples taken during the winter and spring (December through May; 2 P Ͻ .001). The croup cases appeared in 2 peaks; one from October through January and the other from March through April. During October and November, rhinovirus and enterovirus genomes predominated (Figure, B) . Overall, 40% of the samples taken during that period were positive for rhinovirus and enterovirus. This accounts for half of all rhinovirus-and enterovirus-positive cases of croup during the study period. During December, January, and February, several different viruses were associated with the disease. In March, April, and May, PIV was present in more than half of the croup cases (Figure, B) . During the study year, PIV types 1 to 3 genomes were detected in 41% of the children with croup (Table III) , compared with children with wheezing; children with croup had significantly more infections with PIV 1 ( 2 , P Ͻ .001) and PIV 2 (P Ͻ .05). For PIV 3 the observed trend was not statistically significant. Children with wheezing more often had RSV detected than children with croup (28% vs 15%; 2 , P Ͻ .001). Only 2 children tested positive for human metapneumovirus, both of whom had bronchitis (Table III) . Rhinovirus and enterovirus genome was found as often in the nasopharynx of children with croup (30/144) as in those with wheezing (19/76). This holds true for the whole year, as well as for late fall. In October and November, 39% of children with croup and 40% of children with wheezing harbored rhinovirus and enterovirus genome. Among children with croup, half of all rhinovirus-and enterovirus-positive findings appeared during these 2 months; the rest were evenly scattered throughout the year. Overall, 22% of children with croup and 16% with wheezing harbored more than just 1 pathogen (Table II) . Rhinovirus and enterovirus often were found in dual infections. In half (croup 46%, wheezing 57%) of the rhinovirusand enterovirus-positive samples, no other virus was detected. Thus, rhinovirus and enterovirus genome was the only positive finding in 11% of children with croup and in 15% of children with wheezing (difference not statistically significant). HBoV appeared equally frequently in both groups (Table  III) . HBoV tended to be found more often in summer and fall than in winter (Figure) . HBoV was frequently found in addition to other pathogens. Children with croup harbored bocavirus in 18 of 144 cases, but it was the sole pathogen in only 5 cases. HBoV was detected in 8 of 76 cases of bronchiolitis but was the sole pathogen in only 4 cases. Of the 35% of children with croup who were hospitalized, virus detected in the nasopharynx did not correlate with frequency of hospitalization.
