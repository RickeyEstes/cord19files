Stability of RNA transcription of reference genes in C. glabrata following azole stimulation In the present study, 16 reference genes were chosen from among commonly used reference genes in published studies with yeast and mammalian cells, paying close attention to selecting genes that belong to different functional classes; their full names, symbols, functions, and gene numbers are listed in Additional file 1. Our aim was to identify reference genes with minimal variability under our experimental conditions. To this end, RT-qPCR was used to measure the RNA transcription levels of 16 reference genes in C. glabrata cells following fluconazole treatment. To compare the different RNA transcription levels after azole exposure, the C T values of the reference genes were directly compared between the drug-treated (t) and untreated (ut) samples using the formula: The C T is defined as the number of cycles needed for the fluorescence signal to reach a specific threshold level of detection and is inversely correlated with the amount of template cDNA present in the reaction. Thus, a higher value of C T Change indicates lower stability of a reference gene, considering that the expression of a reference gene should not change significantly with azole treatment. As expected, the RNA transcription levels of the reference genes varied ( Table 2 ). The three ribosomal RNA subunits RDN5.8, RDN18, and RDN25 were the most stable reference genes, with C T Change values less than 0.5, while UBC13, PGK1, and UBC7 were relatively stable with C T Change values of only around 1.5. By contrast, the other 10 reference genes showed marked variation in response to fluconazole. Among them, the most prominent variation was found in the RNA transcription levels of SDHA, ACT1, and RPL13A; as seen in Table 2 , the C T Change values of these reference genes were as high as 5.03. To validate the stability of candidate RNA transcription under our experimental conditions, the levels were compared with the RDN5.8 RNA transcription level. We chose to use RDN5.8 as a normalizer because it meets the requirement for both stability and suitability as a reference. First, we calculated the ΔC T between the C T values of reference genes and RDN5.8 from fluconazoletreated (t) and untreated (ut) cells: In the second step, we subtracted the change in RNA transcription in untreated samples from the change in treated samples to obtain the ΔΔC T (t): ΔΔC Thus, ΔΔC T (t) indicates the change in RNA transcription caused by fluconazole treatment after normalization to RNA transcription changes in RDN5.8. A high ΔΔC T (t) value indicates a significant fluconazole-related change in the RNA transcription level of the tested gene. A positive ΔΔC T (t) value indicates down-regulation of transcription, whereas a negative ΔΔC T (t) indicates upregulation of a gene's transcription following azole treatment. We then transformed ΔΔC T (t) into a 2 -ΔΔCT value, which indicates the fold change in RNA transcription of a reference gene in response to fluconazole as compared with the level in untreated cells. The calculated ΔΔC T (t) and 2 -ΔΔCT values of the 16 tested reference genes in drug-treated samples are given in Table 2 . Following stimulation with fluconazole, the RNA transcription of SDHA, ACT1, and RPL13A was highly regulated in C. glabrata cells, with changes ranging from 13to 23-fold compared with transcription in the untreated cells. There was almost no regulation of RDN5.8, RDN18, and RDN25 RNA transcription, while PGK1, UBC7, and UBC13 RNA transcription were only approximately 2-fold induction in response to drug treatment ( Table 2) .
