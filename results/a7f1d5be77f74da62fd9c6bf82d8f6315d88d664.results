Of the first 138 patients with SARS infection in March 2003, 15 patients (10.9%) died. 19 Among the 123 survivors, 13 patients (10.6%) did not attend follow-up at 3 months and 6 months, 16 whereas another 13 patients (10.6%) defaulted the 12-month assessment. Of the 13 defaulters at 12 months, 11 patients had normal lung function indexes, whereas the other 2 patients had Dlco of 68% and 78% of predicted normal values, respectively, at 6 months. Thus, there were only 97 patients (78.9%) who had completed the three assessments; among these, 63 patients (65%) were HCWs (doctors, nurses, ward assistants, and medical students) and 58 patients (66%) were women. The mean age was 36.9 years (SD, 9.5 years) and body mass index (BMI) was 23.7 kg/m 2 (SD, 4.0 kg/m 2 ) during the visit at 12 months from illness onset. The hospital length of stay (LOS) for the group was 22.7 days (SD, 14.6 days). There were only three smokers (3.3%) among the whole group. There were 15 patients with medical comorbidities, which included COPD (n ϭ 1; 1.1%); ischemic heart disease (n ϭ 1; 1.1%); ischemic stroke (n ϭ 1; 1.1%); breast cancer (patient in stable clinical condition receiving tamoxifen) [n ϭ 1; 1.1%]; diabetes mellitus (n ϭ 3; 3.3%); cirrhosis (n ϭ 1; 1.1%), hypertension (n ϭ 4; 4.1%); and asymptomatic hepatitis B carrier (n ϭ 3; 3.3%). Among the 97 patients, 31 patients (32%; 17 men and 14 women) required ICU admission, with an ICU LOS of 13.5 days (SD, 15.6 days; median, 7 days; range, 2 to 64 days), whereas 6 patients (5.5%) required invasive mechanical ventilation. Based on our ICU admission criteria, 19 all 31 patients would have a Pao 2 /fraction of inspired oxygen ratio Ͻ 300 mm Hg, whereas the 6 patients who were intubated had a Pao 2 /fraction of inspired oxygen ratio Ͻ 200 mm Hg. Among these 31 patients, 6 patients had medical comorbidities, including ischemic heart disease (n ϭ 1; 0.9%), diabetes mellitus (n ϭ 1; 0.9%), hypertension (n ϭ 2; 1.8%), and asymptomatic hepatitis B carrier (n ϭ 2; 1.8%), but none had any history of smoking or pulmonary disease.
