genomes but contain three of four nucleotides mismatching at their 3 ends. Oligonucleotide M8 has two Design of strain-specific oligonucleotides adjacent nucleotide mismatches at the 3 end when compared to the same sequence in the Beaudette genome. In order to detect putative hybrid IBV RNAs it was first necessary to design oligonucleotides that could distin- The Beaudette-specific and M41-specific oligonucleotides were spaced 1210 and 970 nucleotides apart, re-guish between M41 and Beaudette using RT-PCR. For this, Beaudette and M41 sequences were analyzed for spectively. Embryonated eggs were infected with either M41 or regions with the highest number of contiguous mismatches. Apart from the Beaudette insert, in the 3-UTR, Beaudette and virion RNA, extracted from virions isolated from the allantoic fluid, was used for the synthesis of no differences were found of more than two consecutive nucleotides. Previously, Kwok et al. (1990) had shown cDNA using oligonucleotide 100, complementary to a sequence present within the 3-UTR in both strains of that oligonucleotides with only two mismatches can be specific, provided that the mismatches are at the 3 end IBV (Fig. 1) . PCR amplifications were carried out on either the Beaudette-or the M41-derived cDNAs using either of the oligonucleotide. Figure 1 shows the oligonucleotides that were designed for use in PCR amplifications the Beaudette-specific oligonucleotides B5 and B7 or the M41-specific oligonucleotides M6 and M8. As can be for the synthesis of products specific for either of the two IBV strains. Oligonucleotide B7 corresponds to a seen from Fig. 2A , lane 3 (Beaudette cDNA using oligonucleotides B5 and B7) and Fig. 2B , lane 2 (M41 cDNA sequence found only in Beaudette; oligonucleotides B5 and M6 correspond to the same position in the two IBV using oligonucleotides M6 and M8) the strain-specific oligonucleotides produced the expected 1210-and 970bp PCR products, respectively. In contrast, the strainspecific oligonucleotides did not produce any product when used in conjunction with the heterologous strain ( Fig. 2A , lane 2, M41 cDNA using oligonucleotides B5 and B7; Fig. 2B , lane 3, Beaudette cDNA using oligonucleotides M6 and M8). These results showed that the strain-specific oligonucleotide pairs were unable to generate DNA from the heterologous strain and were suitable for detecting hybrid RNAs derived from recombination events between the 3 ends of the genomes of the two IBV strains. M41. IBV virions were isolated from the allantoic fluid RT-PCR amplifications were also carried out on extracts from allantoic fluid from mock-infected embryonated eggs, to check whether any PCR products could have been produced from cellular RNA.
