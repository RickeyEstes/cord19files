The rat colony (N=36, 6 M:29 F) was diagnosed to be symptomatic (n=2) as well as asymptomatic (n=34) carrier of M pulmonis infection. Animals reported positive after pathological, serological, and Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.10/November-2017/16.pdf PCR-based molecular diagnosis were in similar age group (6-8 months) and kept under similar climatic conditions. All the animals were in the age group of 6-7 months. Based on clinical symptoms and postmortem lesions, MRM was classified as mild, moderate, and severe (Table-1 ).
