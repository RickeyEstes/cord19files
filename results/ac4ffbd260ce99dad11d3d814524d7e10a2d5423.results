Effect of 5-iodo-2'.deoxy ~. ri~:.?#ze (IUDR) Calf diarrhea coronav~r~ls was tested along with IBR and BE viruses. A group of tube cultures of ~;EK-1 cells were inoculated with virus at an input multiplicity of 0.1 TCID~ ~}ceU. After virus adsorption at 37 ° C for I h, ~me half of the inoculated cultures received 0.5-ml amounts of maintenance medium and the remaining half received maintenance medium containing 50 ~g/ml of IUDR. The cultures were incubated in a roller drum at; 34 ° C, and, at intervals, four cultures were taken f~t a each group. The fluid phase of the cultures was pooled and stored at -SjOC after clarification by tow-speed centrifugation. All the specimens were assayed for infectivity ~imultaneously. The results are illustrated in Fig. 1 . The replication of calf diarrhea coronavirus was not affected by IUDR, indicating that the virus is an RNA virus. The control viruses employed behaved as expected; BE viras was not affected by IUDR, but IBR virus did not multiply in the presence of IUDR.
