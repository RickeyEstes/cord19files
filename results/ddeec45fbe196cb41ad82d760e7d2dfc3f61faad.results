In human, the mRNAs of intron-containing genes are more stable In human HepG2 cells and Bud8 cells, the mRNAs of intron-containing genes have lower decay rates than those of intronless genes (Table 1 ). In human T lymphocytes stimulated with medium and T lymphocytes stimulated with antibodies anti-CD3 and anti-CD28, the mRNAs of intron-containing genes have longer half-lives than those of intronless genes (Table 1 ). In human T lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody, there is also a significant difference between mRNA half-lives of intron-containing genes and those of intronless genes (P = 0.045). Considered from the average value of mRNA half-lives, the mRNAs of intronless genes are a little more stable than those of the intron-containing genes. But if considered from the median value of mRNA half-lives, the mRNAs of intron-containing genes are more stable than those of the intronless genes. As the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test uses the ranks of the data rather than their raw values to calculate the statistic, the conclusion based on median value is stronger. That is, the mRNAs of intron-containing genes have longer half-lives than those of intronless genes in human T lymphocytes stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody. As a stable mRNA can be measured by lower decay rate or longer half-life, our analyses of different sources of data consistently showed that the mRNAs of intron-containing genes are more stable than those of intronless genes in human cells. We further tested the relationship between intron presence and human mRNA stability by controlling other biological characters to see whether the above relationship is the byproduct of other relationships. Some evidence suggested that short mRNAs may be more stable [20, 21] . But the intronless genes we analyzed have significantly shorter mRNAs than the intron-containing genes (Supplementary Table S1 ). So the difference in mRNA stabilities between intron-containing genes and intronless genes could not be attributed to the difference in mRNA lengths. Human intronless genes are not randomly distributed across molecular function categories [22] . Meanwhile, previous studies on yeast and human showed a strong relationship between physiological function and mRNA turnover rates [15, 16] . Could the difference in mRNA stability between intronless genes and intron-containing genes be attributed to functional differences? According to the observed mRNA decay rates, Yang and coauthors [16] divided the Gene Ontology (GO) categories into three groups: faster, slower, and no significant. We analyzed the distribution of intron-containing genes and intronless genes in the three GO groups by chi-square test. There are no significant differences in the genes analyzed in bud8 cells and those analyzed in T cells (P > 0.10). For the genes analyzed in HepG2 cells, intronless genes appear to be enriched in faster decay group (P = 0.046), but the P value is near the conventional significant borderline of 0.05. Furthermore, we designed a method to remove the effects of functional difference on mRNA stability. For each human intronless gene, we selected an intron-containing gene with similar function and similar mRNA length to pair with it. The functional similarity was defined as if they share two or more GO terms (http://www.geneontology.org/) and the mRNA length similarity was defined as if the length difference is below 30%. More stringent criteria result in much fewer pairs of genes giving too small a sample to study. In the cases that two or more intron-containing genes are paired with one intronless gene, we used the median value of the mRNA stabilities of the intron-containing genes in the pairwise comparison with the intronless gene. We found that the mRNAs of intronless genes are less stable (i.e. have higher decay rates or shorter half-lives) than the intron-containing genes with similar mRNA lengths and functions (Fig. 1) . But the differences are not significant in Wilcoxon signed ranks tests of the data from T lymphocytes with anti-CD3 and from T lymphocytes with both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (Fig. 1) . Some AU-rich elements in the 3 0 -untranslated region of mRNAs were found to decrease mRNA stability [5, 16] . But we found they are not more abundant in the mRNAs of intronless genes (Supplementary Table S2 ). On the contrary, they are a little more abundant in the mRNAs of intron-containing genes (Supplementary Table S2 ). The presence of introns seems to enhance mRNA stability in human. A further question is whether multiple introns have cumulative effect on mRNA stability in intron-containing genes. After controlling for mRNA length, we found significant negative correlations between intron number and mRNA decay rate in human HepG2 cells and Bud8 cells, and significant positive correlations between intron number and mRNA half-life in human T lymphocytes ( Table 2) . Controlling for mRNA length together with other potential factors like gene expression level and GC content gave similar results (data not shown).
