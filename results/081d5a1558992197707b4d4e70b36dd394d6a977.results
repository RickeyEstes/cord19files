A total of 241 excess nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were available for the study. Eight of them were excluded, as the mariPOC Assay inhibited in 3 samples and the PCR tests in 5 samples. The final study comprised 233 samples. A total of 139 (59.7%) samples had positive results, and 94 (40.3%), negative results by the PCR tests for the set of viruses of the mariPOC panel. Of the 139 samples with positive results by PCR, 102 (73.4%) also tested positive by the mariPOC Assay, and 37 (26.6%) tested negative. A number of 250 viral agents were identified by PCR. Viruses most frequently detected among 233 samples were RSV (n = 102, 43.8%) and RV (n = 61, 26.2%), whereas hMPV (n = 15, 6.4%), CoV (n = 13, 5.6%), BoV (n = 13, 5.6%), IFV-B (n = 11, 4.7%), and PIV-4 (n = 10, 4.3%) were found in lower rates. Presence of ADV (n = 8, 3.4%); EV (n = 8, 3.4%); IFV-A (n = 6; 2.6%); and PIV-1, PIV-2, and PIV-3 (n = 3, 1.3%) was minor in the sample collection. Viral co-infections were detected in 47 (20.2%) samples, and RSV was present in all co-infected samples. Table 1 records the distribution of all respiratory viruses detected by the PCR techniques. Overall sensitivity of the mariPOC Assay for the viruses included in its panel was 73.4% (95% CI 65.6-80.2). The assay had sensitivity of 78.4% for detection of RSV, but lower values were found for IFV-A (66.7%); IFV-B (63.6%); hMPV (60.0%); and, particularly, for ADV (12.5%). Overall specificity of the assay was 97.9% (95% CI 93.2-99.6) ). Measures of the mariPOC performance characteristics are detailed in Table 2 . Comparative analysis of the 2 subsets of specimens processed prospectively and retrospectively by the mariPOC Assay resulted in an overall sensitivity of 68.6% for samples analyzed prospectively versus 76.1% for those analyzed retrospectively (P = 0.20), while overall specificities for each subset were 97.5% and 98.1%, respectively (P = 0.62).
