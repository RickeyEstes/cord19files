The associations of WBGT, T, and AT with different health outcomes during warm season of the studied periods are shown in Fig. 2 of Appendix B. As can be seen, the health impacts increased linearly with the heat indicator after certain values in the right tails of these graphs. Fig. 1 (a)-(i) displays the associations of WBGT, T, and AT with different health outcomes in GAMs after confounder adjustments. Similarly, the right tails seen in Fig. 1 (a)-(i) also show linear exposure-response relationships of maximum WBGT, T, and AT with different health impacts above certain values. Such agreement in results obtained indicates the suitability of the GAMs for this analysis. Table 2(a)-(c) shows RRs estimated by the modified GAMs with different threshold candidates for WBGT, T, and AT, respectively. Whether stratified or not, RRs for all-cause mortality, heat-related hospital admissions, and heat-related emergency visits showed a rising trend with increase in threshold values for WBGT, T, and AT. The RRs for WBGT were statistically significant up to the cut-point of 32.5°C (RR = 1.06), 33.0°C (RR = 2.03), and 33.0°C (RR = 4.19) for allcause mortality, heat-related hospital admissions, and heat-related emergency visits, respectively. The RRs for T were statistically significant up to the cut-point of 33.5°C (RR = 1.11), 34.0°C (RR = 1.69), and 34.0°C (RR = 4.13) for the three health outcomes, respectively. The RRs for AT were statistically significant up to the cut-point of 36.0°C (RR = 1.05), 37.5°C (RR = 1.52), and 37.5°C (RR = 4.67) for the three health outcomes, respectively. The highest RRs for all three heat indicators occurred in heat-related emergency visits (RR = 4.13-4.67), followed by heat-related hospital admissions (RR = 1.52-2.03) and all-cause mortality (RR = 1.05-1.11). In general, males have higher RRs for these three health outcomes with all three heat indicators than females, with the few exceptions observed for emergency visits with the WBGT threshold set at 32.0°C, T thresholds at 32.0, 33.0, and 34.0°C, and AT thresholds at 36.0, 37.0, and 37.5°C. The differences in RRs between males and females became greater with increasing threshold values. In heat-related emergency visits, the highest RR for males was 4.29 for WBGT with threshold of 33.0°C, while that for females reached 7.45 for T with threshold of 34.0°C and 6.08 for AT with threshold of 37.5°C. The above estimates were all statistically significant. Differences in RR for health outcomes among the three age groups also widened with increasing threshold values of heat indicators. The following description focuses on results with statistical significance. For WBGT, the highest RR for all-cause mortality (1.06) occurred in the population aged above 65 years at threshold of 32.5°C; while that for both heat-related hospital admissions (2.61) and heat-related emergency visits (6.86) occurred among the age group of 0-14 years at threshold of 33.0°C and 33.0°C, respectively. For T, the population aged above 65 years had the highest RR for all-cause mortality (1.11) and heat-related emergency visits (5.29) at threshold of 33.5°C; while the age group of 0-14 had the highest RR for heat-related hospital admissions (2.20) at threshold of 34.0°C. Similarly, for AT, the population aged above 65 years had the highest RR for all-cause mortality (1.06) and heat-related emergency visits (5.12) at threshold of 36.0°C and 37.5°C, respectively; while the age group of 0-14 had the highest RR for heat-related hospital admissions (1.97) at threshold of 37.5°C. In short, the age group of either 0-14 or > 65 had the highest RRs for these three different heat indicators, with those for all-cause mortality consistently in the population aged above 65 and those for heat-related hospital admissions consistently in age group of 0-14. Moreover, for the age group of 0-14, the RRs for heat-related hospital admissions (1.97-2.61) and emergency visits (3.46-6.86) showed statistically significant increase with most of the threshold candidates for the different heat indicators; while those for all-cause mortality did not. The incremental changes in RRs of different threshold candidates compared with RRs of the reference, as shown in Fig. 2(a) -(c), show a rapid rising trend with increase in threshold values. For WBGT ( Fig. 2(a) ) with threshold of 33.0°C, the RRI of heat-related hospital admissions (73%) and heat-related emergency visits (242%) are numerically much higher than that of all-cause mortality (9%). The same pattern is observed for T ( Fig. 2(b) ) with threshold of 34.0°C and AT (Fig. 2(c) ) with threshold of 37.5°C. In addition, the rapid increase in RRIs for these three different health outcomes occurred between WBGT threshold at 32.0°C and 33.0°C. During the period of 2000-2014, WBGT of 32.0°C and 33.0°C correspond to 89.8 percentile and 99.6 percentile, respectively. For T, the rapid increase in RRIs occurred between thresholds of 33.0°C and 34.0°C for all-cause mortality and heatrelated emergency visits only. Temperature of 33.0°C and 34.0°C correspond to 94.1 percentile and 99.8 percentile, respectively during 2000-2014. For AT, the rapid increase in RRIs occurred between thresholds of 36.0°C and 37.5°C for all-cause mortality and heat-related emergency visits only, which correspond to 90.6 percentile and 99.9 percentile, respectively for 2000-2014. To further evaluate whether the identified thresholds are proper for a heat warning system, the number of days above different threshold values for WBGT, T, and AT between 2000 and 2017 are plotted in Fig. 3(a)-(c) , respectively. For better clarity in illustration, only the plots of several selected threshold values are presented. The threshold for a heat warning system can be chosen according to the RRIs and these historical health outcomes with different policy considerations in mind. If preventing increase in all-cause mortality is the policy target and the selected threshold needed to be supported by statistically significant evidence, the choice of threshold for WBGT, T and AT could be 32.5°C, 33.5°C and 36.0°C, respectively. However, it may result in frequent warnings issued. In the cases of WBGT at 32.5°C and AT at 36.0°C; there were 52 days in 2016 and 61 in 2017 above these thresholds, respectively. The warm season in Taiwan is usually hot and humid. Too frequent issue of heat warnings may cause the general public to pay no heed to them and pose burden on manpower and resources for supporting heat-health responsive actions associated with warnings. The aforementioned thresholds may be good for heat advisory but not for a heat warning, which should be accompanied with governmental emergency response actions. Thus, an effective heat warning system aiming to prevent increase in heat-related hospital admissions and emergency visits may pick a threshold for an extreme high heat-stress situation; for example, the choice of threshold for WBGT, T and AT could be 33.0°C, 34.0°C and 37.5°C, respectively. The numbers of days exceeding these thresholds in years of 2000-2017 were mostly 0-2 days, with two exceptions for WBGT and six for AT. The highest number of days, 14, occurred in the case of WBGT in 2016 (an El Niño year). For the whole period of 2000-2017, the average days above the thresholds for WBGT, T and AT at 33.0°C, 34.0°C and 37.5°C were 1.5, 0.4, and 2.0 days, respectively (see Table 2 of Appendix C). Thus, the heat-warning system with such thresholds can arouse the attention of the public for proper self-protection and trigger adequate responsive actions from the authorities to reduce causalities under extreme heat-stress events.
