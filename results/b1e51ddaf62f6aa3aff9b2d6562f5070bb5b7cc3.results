In order to evaluate the status of virus replication in CpG ODN pre-treated and PBS treated embryos, we analysed the expression of the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene in embryonic lungs at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, post IBV infection. Our data showed significantly lower levels of viral N gene expression in group of embryos treated with CpG ODN prior to infection (Fig. 1) . Our data showed equal levels of IFN-␣ and IL-12 (P40) genes up-regulation (∼4 fold increase in expression at 24 h, post infection) in CpG pre-treated and non-CpG treated infected groups (group A and B). In contrast, IFN-␥ gene expression in embryonic lung tissue treated with CpG ODN prior to IBV infection was significantly higher (>100 fold) compared with non-CpG treated infected group at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, post infection (Fig. 2) . IL-1␤ and IL-18 gene expression showed no significant differences between CpG ODN treated (group A) or PBS treated (group B) IBV infected embryos ( Fig. 3A and B) . Surprisingly, IL-6 gene expression was significantly upregulated in non CpG treated infected embryos (group B) at 72 h, PI. The IL-8 gene showed significantly higher expression in group of embryos pre-treated with CpG ODN (group A) compared with PBS treated (group B) embryos at 48 h, post IBV challenge ( Fig. 3A and B) . We analysed expression of two chemotactic cytokines macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1␤ and MIP-3␣. Out of both chemokines, the MIP-1␤ gene showed significantly higher expression in CpG ODN pre-treated infected embryos compared with PBS pre-treated infected embryos at 48 h, PI. However, there was no difference in MIP-3␣ gene expression in both (A and B) groups (Fig. 4) . In our experiments, there was non-significant difference in OASA gene expression in CpG ODN pre-treated and PBS pre-treated infected embryos (groups A and B, respectively) for first 48 h, PI. However, at 72 h, PI, OASA gene expression in embryonic lungs from the CpG ODN pre-treated group was significantly lower than in the lungs from PBS treated embryos (Fig. 5) . The analysis of lungs tissue collected from group D at 24 h, post CpG ODN administration showed substantial up-regulation (35 fold) of IFN-␥ gene expression While, moderate level of increase in IL-1(2.8 fold), IL-8 (5 fold), MIP-1␤ (2.8 fold) and OASA (5 fold) genes expression was observed. It is noteworthy, that 24 h, post CpG ODN administration time point is the time point when embryos in group A and B were challenged with IBV (Table 2) .
