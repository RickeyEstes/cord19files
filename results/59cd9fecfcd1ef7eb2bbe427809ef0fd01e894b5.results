Various BaMV/PVX chimera mutants of the structural elements in the 3′ UTR of the BaMV and PVX were created to examine the relationship between structure and function based on a full-length infectious cDNA clone (pBS2-8) of BaMV strain S (BaMV-S) [15] . The entire BaMV 3′ UTR was replaced with the 3′ UTR of PVX RNA in the BaMV-S/P mutant. The DE, E, D, ABC, and ABCD regions of the BaMV-S were replaced with the PVX 3′ UTR to generate BaMV-S/ABCP, -/ABCDP, -/ABCPE, -/PDE, and -/PE mutants, respectively (the replacement mutants) (Figure 1 ). The PVX 3′ UTR was inserted in the upstream and downstream of the 3′ UTR of BaMV to create BaMV-S/PABCDE and -/ABCDEP, respectively (the insertion mutants).
