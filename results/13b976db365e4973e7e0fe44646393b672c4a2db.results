Characterization of the HCoV-229E RBD interaction with hAPN. To define the limits of the HCoV-229E RBD, we expressed a series of soluble S-protein fragments and measured their affinity to a soluble fragment (residues 66-967) 39 of hAPN, the HCoV-229E receptor. The smallest S-protein fragment made (residues 293-435) bound hAPN with an affinity (K d of 0.43 ± 0.1 µM) similar to that of the entire S1 region (residues 17-560) ( Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 1A , B) and this fragment was used in the structure determination. To confirm the importance of the Table 1 Analysis of the hAPN ectodomain (residues 66-967, WT and mutants) interaction with fragments of the HCoV-229E Sprotein (WT and mutants) using surface plasmon resonance HCoV-229E RBD-hAPN interaction for viral infection, we showed that both the RBD and the hAPN ectodomain inhibited viral infection in a cell-based assay (Fig. 1a, b, c) . Crystals of the HCoV-229E RBD-hAPN complex were obtained by co-crystallization of the complex after size exclusion chromatography. The crystallographic data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table 2 . The asymmetric unit contains one hAPN dimer (and associated RBDs) and one hAPN monomer (and associated RBD) that is related to its dimeric mate by a crystallographic two-fold rotation axis. Both dimers (noncrystallographic and crystallographic) are found in the closed conformation and are essentially identical to that which we previously reported 39 for hAPN in its apo form (RMSD over all Cα atoms of 0.34 Å). Each APN monomer is bound to one RBD as shown in Fig. 2a . The HCoV-229E RBD-hAPN interaction buries 510 Å 2 of surface area on the RBD and 490 Å 2 on hAPN. The HCoV-229E RBD is an elongated six-stranded β-structural domain with three extended loops (loop 1: residues 308-325, loop 2: residues 352-359, loop 3: residues 404-408) at one end that exclusively mediate the interaction with hAPN (Fig. 2b ). Loop 1 is the longest and it contributes~70% of the RBD surface buried on complex formation (Figs. 2c and 3g). Within loop 1, residues Cys 317 and Cys 320 form a disulfide bond that makes a stacking interaction with the side chains of hAPN residues Tyr 289 and Glu 291 (Fig. 2c) . The C317S/C320S RBD double mutant showed no binding to hAPN at concentrations up to 15 μM (Table 1 , Supplementary Fig. 1D , and Supplementary Table 1), evidence of the importance of the stacking interaction and a likely role for the disulfide bond in defining the conformation of loop 1. Notably, loop 1 contains three tandemly repeated glycine residues (residues 313-315) whose NH groups donate hydrogen bonds to the side chain of Asp 288 and the carbonyl oxygen of Phe 287 of hAPN (Fig. 2c) ; mutation of hAPN residue Asp 288 to alanine leads to a~10-fold reduction in affinity ( (Fig. 2c) ; the importance of Trp 404 of loop 3 is evidenced by the fact that mutating it also ablates binding (Table 1 , Supplementary Fig. 1F , and Supplementary Table 1 ). HCoV-229E and PRCoV bind at different sites on APN. As with HCoV-229E, the porcine respiratory alphacoronavirus, PRCoV, also uses APN as its receptor 40 . As our complex shows, HCoV-229E binds at a site on hAPN (H-site) that differs from the site on pAPN (P-site) used by PRCoV (Fig. 3a, b) . Glu 291 in hAPN, a residue in the hAPN-RBD interface, is an N-glycosylated asparagine (Asn 286 ) in pAPN and attempts to dock the HCoV-229E RBD at the H-site on pAPN leads to a steric clash with the N-glycan ( Supplementary Fig. 3A ). Consistent with this observation, the HCoV-229E RBD cannot bind to a mutant form of hAPN (E291N/K292E/Q293T) that possesses an N-glycan at position 291, as we have shown ( 41 . Across species, the sequence identity at the H-and P-sites is only~60% ( Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 3C ) and the receptor-binding loops of these viruses must be accommodating the remaining APN structural differences on receptors from species that they do not infect. Together these results provide evidence that the extended receptor-binding loops of these alphacoronaviruses possess conformational plasticity. The observation that HCoV-229E and PRCoV bind to different sites on APN has important consequences. Among species, APN is found in open/intermediate and closed conformations and conversion between them is thought to be important for the catalysis of its substrates 39, 42 . The HCoV-229E RBD binds to hAPN in its closed conformation and structural comparison shows that the H-site does not differ between the open and closed conformations. This is to be contrasted with the P-site of pAPN that differs in the open and closed conformations. Indeed, the PRCoV RBD has recently been shown to bind to pAPN in the open conformation as a result of P-site interactions made possible in the open form 42 . These differences in binding and receptor conformation are reflected in the fact that enzyme inhibitors that promote the closed conformation of APN block TGEV infection 42 , but not HCoV-229E infection 8 , and the fact that the PRCoV S-protein 42 , but not HCoV-229E 43 , inhibits APN catalytic activity. The receptor-binding loops of HCoV-229E vary extensively. Sequence data from viruses isolated over the past 50 years provides a wealth of data on the natural variation shown by HCoV-229E ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). With reference to the HCoV-229E RBD-hAPN complex reported here, we now show that 73% of the amino acids in the receptor-binding loops and supporting residues vary among the sequences analyzed (52 sequences in total), while only 11% of the RBD surface residues outside of the receptor-binding loops show variation (Fig. 4a, b) . Moreover, for the eight variants where full genome sequences were reported, the receptor-binding loops represent the location at which the greatest variation in the entire genome is observed (Fig. 4c) . Analysis of the HCoV-229E RBD-hAPN interface further shows that of the 16 RBD surface residues that are fully or partially buried on complex formation, 10 of them vary in at least one of the 52 sequences analyzed and a pairwise comparison of the sequences suggests that many of these positions can vary simultaneously ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Finally, we show that the six invariant interface residues on the RBD (Gly 313 , Gly 315 , Cys 317 , Cys 320 , Asn 319 , and Arg 359 ) constitute only 45% of the viral surface area buried, the very region expected to be the most highly conserved from a receptor-binding standpoint.

The entire protein coding region of the viral genome was treated as a continuous amino acid string (8850 residues in total). Amino acid differences among the eight sequences were analyzed in 100 residue bins and for each bin the sum was plotted. Green-colored bins correspond to residues in the S-protein and purple-colored bins correspond to residues in the RBD. The horizontal dotted line denotes the average number of aminoacid differences per bin across the protein-coding region of the whole viral genome. d Alignment of the sequences selected for each of the six classes.

The nucleus is stained blue and green staining indicates viral infection. Magnification (×200) and scale bar = 10 µm. f Statistical quantification of the monoclonal antibody inhibition experiment. Error bars correspond to standard deviations obtained from three independent experiments remaining 55% (i.e., 279 Å 2 ) of the viral surface area buried is made up of 10 residues that differ in their variability and the role they play in complex formation (Supplementary Table 2 ). Loop variation leads to phylogenetic classes. Phylogenetic analysis of the HCoV-229E RBD sequences found in the database showed that they segregate into six classes ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Class I contains the ATCC-740 reference strain (originally isolated in 1967 and deposited in 1973) and related lab strains, while Classes II-VI, represent clinical isolates that have successively replaced each other in the human population over time since the 1970s. To characterize these classes, a representative sequence from each was selected; for Class I, the RBD of the reference strain, also used in our structural analysis, was selected. To simplify characterization, the RBDs of the other five classes were synthesized with the Class I sequence in all but the loop regions (Fig. 4d) . As observed for Class I, the other RBDs do not bind to the hAPN mutant that introduces an N-glycan at Glu 291 (Supplementary Fig. 4D) , an observation suggesting that they all bind at the same site on hAPN. The RBDs bound hAPN with añ 16-fold range in affinity (K d from~30 to~440 nM). These differences in affinity are largely a result of differences in k off with little difference in k on (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7) . Table 2 shows the identity of the loop residues that have shown variation. Of those buried in the RBD-hAPN interface, residues 314, 404, and 407 are particularly noteworthy as they undergo considerable variation in amino-acid character. Residue 314, for example, accounts for 9% of the total buried surface area on complex formation and changes from Gly to Val to Pro in the transition from Classes I to VI. Variation of this sort provides insight into how changes in receptor-binding affinity might be mediated during the process of viral adaptation. Each of the six RBD classes were also characterized using a neutralizing mouse monoclonal antibody (9.8E12) that we generated against the HCoV-229E reference strain (Class I). As shown in Fig. 4e, f, 9 .8E12 inhibits HCoV-229E infection of the L132 cell-line. This antibody binds to the Class I RBD with a K d of 66 nM (k on = 6.3 × 10 5 M −1 s −1 , k off = 0.041 s −1 ) and as shown by a competition binding experiment, it blocks the RBD-hAPN interaction ( Supplementary Fig. 8A, B) . In contrast, 9.8E12 shows no binding to the other five RBD classes at a concentration of 1 μM (Supplementary Fig. 8C ), strong evidence that the receptorbinding loops of the Class I RBD are important for antibody binding and that loop variation can abrogate antibody binding. Consistent with this observation, non-conserved amino-acid changes both within and outside of the RBD-hAPN interface are observed across all classes (Supplementary Table 2 ).
