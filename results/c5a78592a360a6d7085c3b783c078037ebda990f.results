From December 4, 2014, to March 6, 2015, the ED admitted 211 patients with a diagnosis of CAP (Fig. 1) . Of the 99 patients randomized to the Standard group, 31 patients were non-evaluable, due to inadequate evidence of pneumonia in 26, incomplete diagnostics in 3, and transition to comfort care within a day in 2 patients. Inadequate evidence of pneumonia was attributable to patients with bronchitis or COPD exacerbation (8), sepsis from another source (7), CHF (5), cystic fibrosis (2), metastatic cancer (2), MAI (1) and chemical aspiration (1). Of the remaining 68 evaluable patients, 1 or more pathogens were identified in 47 (69%). Of the 111 patients randomized to the FilmArray group, 52 patients were non-evaluable, due to inadequate evidence of pneumonia in 40, incomplete diagnostics in 3, and transition to comfort care in 9 patients within a day. Inadequate evidence of pneumonia was attributable to patients with bronchitis or COPD exacerbation (13), sepsis from another source (12), CHF (6), metastatic cancer (6), asthma, pulmonary embolism, or chemical aspiration (1 each). Of the remaining 59 evaluable patients, 1 or more pathogens were identified in 43 (73%). Non-evaluable patients were otherwise similar to those evaluable with respect to demographics, comorbidities, and other features listed in Table 1 .
