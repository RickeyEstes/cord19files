Of the 15 emitters sampled using both the Coriolis and PTFE cassettes, 12 had influenza A and 3 had influenza B. The average age was 77.0 years (range 42-98 years). Eight participants (53.3%) were female, including 1 pregnant emitter. Thirteen patients (86.7%) had co-morbidities, including diabetes, malignancy, underlying cardiopulmonary or other disorders. The average duration of admission was 6.4 (range 2-15) days. Fourteen participants (93.3%) received oseltamivir, and 13 (92.9%) of these individuals began treatment within 48 h of MT swab collection. The majority (72.2%) of air samples were obtained within 24 h of MT swab collection. Of the 12 patients infected with influenza A, viral RNA was recovered from PTFE filters proximal to 11 patients at a distance of 0.5-1 m, 9 patients at a distance of 1.1-1.5 m distance, and in 1 of 5 cases where sampling was performed outside the room. In 2 cases, the air sampled at the 0.5-1.0 m point alone was positive; no viral RNA was recovered in one case. No viral RNA was detected from the air emitted by the 3 patients infected with influenza B. In most cases, the quantity of viral RNA found per liter of air sampled was lower for the Coriolis than the PTFE filter membranes (Fig. 1 ). Viral loads from MT swabs did not positively correlate with the amount of viral RNA recovered from air (for influenza virus at 0.5-1 m and 1.1-1.5 m, rho was 0.13 (p = 0.68) and âˆ’0.52 (p = 0.08)) respectively. Personal sampling of HCWs' breathing zones began midway through the influenza season. Five HCWs consented to participate, four of whom completed sampling. Influenza virus RNA was detected from one of these four HCWs' air samples. This was not quantified since the sampling period was not equal to the exposure period, considering that HCWs continued to care for other patients. All of the baseline MT swabs from HCWs were negative.
