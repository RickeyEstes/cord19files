3.1. The 2 mAbs were active against IBV N protein Two hybridomas, 6D10 and 4F10, were found to secrete mAbs specifically against the IBV tl/CH/LDT3/03 N protein (Fig. 2) . The mAbs recognized recombinant N protein and the native IBV tl/CH/LDT3/03 antigen according to Western blotting ( Fig. 2A) . The reactivity and specificity of the 6D10 and 4F10 mAbs were confirmed using a commercial ELISA and an ELISA where whole IBV tl/CH/LDT3/03 virus particles were used as the coating antigen (Fig. 2B ). In addition, the 2 mAbs, 6D10 and 4F10, showed no reactions with other respiratory viruses, such as NDV, ILTV and H9 subtype AIV, using Western blotting. The 2 mAbs were determined to be IgG1 (К) and IgG2b (К).
