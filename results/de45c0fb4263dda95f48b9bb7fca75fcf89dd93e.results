Characterization of the RNA probe used for determining the RNA binding of WhNV protein A To determine whether WhNV protein A could bind to RNA directly, we first determined which RNA sequences can be used as the RNA probe. Previous study reported that nodaviruses contain the conversed sequences in the 5 0 -proximal region of RNA1 that exhibit a stem-loop structure and are responsible for RNA recruitment (Van Wynsberghe and Ahlquist, 2009 ). According to WhNV, its RNA1 nt ] exhibited a similar secondary structure (Fig. 1B) . To examine whether these sequences are responsible for WhNV RNA1 recruitment/stabilization in cells, we constructed two RNA1 derivates and examined their recruitment in the presence of WhNV replication-incompetent protein A GAA (Fig. 1A) . The plasmid pAC1E, in which an (enhanced green fluorescent protein) EGFP open reading frame (ORF) is inserted at the 3 0 end of RNA1 sequence , is a functional template for RNA1 replication (the transcribed and replicated products are labeled as "RNA1E"), but the ORF of protein A is closed by the mutation of the start codon . WhNV Protein A GAA is provided by the plasmid pA GAA . The RdRp activity of Protein A GAA is nulled by mutating the GDD replication site to GAA as previously described Wang et al., 2013) . Protein A GAA retained its RNA1 recruitment activity despite losing its RNA replicase activity . We determined the sequences required for RNA1 recruitment in Pr-E cells, which are derived from Pieris rapae larvae, the natural host of WhNV . Thirty-six hrs after transfecting with the pA GAA and the indicated plasmids, cells were collected and total RNA was analyzed by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 1C , the presence of protein A GAA supported the recruitment of wild type (wt) RNA1E (compared lane 2 to lane 1; Fig. 1D ). While destroying the stem-loop by either deleting (Fig. 1B , "Del") or mutating the stem structure (Fig. 1B , "Mut") of RNA1E resulted in the decrease in RNA1E recruitment (Fig. 1C , compared lane 4 or 6 to lane 2; Fig. 1D ). These results indicate that WhNV RNA1 nt 50-118 is needed for RNA1 recruitment. We sought to determine the sequences required for RNA2 recruitment in cells. The analysis of RNA2 sequence using RNA mfold showed that RNA2 nt ] exhibits a stable stem-loop structure (Fig. 1E ). We then examined whether this sequence is required for RNA2 recruitment by protein A in cells. Deletion of RNA2 nt 1-180 ( Fig. 1F ) resulted in a significant reduction in RNA2 recruitment in the presence of protein A GAA (Fig. 1G , compared lane 4 to lane 2; Fig. 1H ). On the other hand, RNA2 nt 1-180 was sufficient to support protein A-mediated RNA2 recruitment (Fig. 1G , compared lane 6 to lane 5; Fig. 1H ). Furthermore, deleting the stem-loop region (Fig. 1E ) resulted in a significant decrease in RNA2 recruitment (Fig. 1G , comparing lane 8 to lane 2; Fig. 1H ). These results indicate that WhNV RNA2 nt 123-164 is required for RNA2 recruitment. Together, both RNA1 and RNA2 can be used as the RNA probes for the gel mobility shift experiments. The characterization of the RNA1 binding behavior of protein A revealed its cooperative RNA binding Maltose-binding protein (MBP)-tagged full-length (FL) protein A (MBP-protA) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified (Fig. 1A) . Standard gel mobility shift experiments with a DIG-labeled RNA1 were performed to determine the RNA binding ability of MBP-protA at 27 1C, and the samples were subject to 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 2B , MBP-protA did bind to RNA efficiently (lane 5), whereas the negative controls (MBP alone, bovine serum albumin [BSA] , and boiled MBP-protA) exhibited no RNA binding ability (lanes 2-4). Moreover, RNA probe competition assays were performed to test whether MBP-protA specifically bound to RNA1 (Fig. 2C) . Briefly, the same amounts of DIG-labeled RNA probe and MBP-protA were used in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled competitors, such as RNA1 wt, Del or Mut, and yeast tRNA (Fig. 2C ). Only RNA1 wt efficiently competed with DIGlabeled RNA1 , showing that protein A binds to RNA1 specifically. We also revealed that protein A can directly bind to RNA2 by the gel mobility shift experiment in the presence of MBP-protA and DIG-labeled RNA2 (Fig. 2D, lane 2) . Moreover, increasing the amount of unlabeled RNA2 competitor resulted in the gradual reduction of the bound RNA probe, indicating that RNA2 is specifically bound to protein A as does RNA1 (Fig. 2D , lanes 3-5). We used RNA1 as the RNA probe for the subsequent assays. To further characterize the behavior of protein A when it binds to RNA1, we incubated progressively increasing amounts of MBP-protA (0.1-6 μM) with 20 nM of DIG-labeled RNA1 (50-118) (Fig. 2E ). In the presence of a small amount of MBP-protA, the RNA probe was found mostly in free form, while increasing the amount of MBP-protA resulted in a rapid transition of the RNA probe to bound form (Fig. 2E) . The minimal ratio of protein A to RNA probe for RNA binding is about 10:1 (Fig. 2E, ( þ )RNA1E expression. RNA1E templates with authentic viral 5 0 and 3 0 termini of WhNV RNA1 and an inserting EGFP sequence were generated from pAC1E by precisely placing the Ac5 promoter start site and a hepatitisδribozyme (Rz), respectively, and by mutating the start codon at the indicated location to disrupt translation. The Ac5 promoter and SV40 polyadenylation signal (SV) flanking the protein A ORF in pA GAA thereof disrupt its activity as a viral RNA replication template and mutating the replication GDD sites into GAA but maintain its activity to recruit RNA . pA GAA -derived protein A GAA subsequently directs ( þ)RNA1E recruitment from ( þ) RNA1E template transcribed from pAC1E.

Pr-E cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids, including pAC1E wt, Del or Mut (as shown in B) in the absence or in the presence of pA GAA (protein A GAA ).

After transfection for 36 h, total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blot with the probes against EGFP and 18S rRNA, respectively. (H) The levels of ( þ )RNA2 were determined from three experiments after normalization to 18S rRNA and are expressed as the level of protein A-stimulated (þ )RNA2 accumulation relative to wt ( þ )RNA2. 1.9 μM for protein A at an RNA probe concentration of 20 nM ( Fig. 2F) . Moreover, the RNA binding data were quantified, and a Hill transformation was applied to determine whether the binding of protein A to RNA1 is cooperative [i.e., that the binding of protein A to RNA increased the affinity of protein A to bind to additional RNA molecules; a 41 Hill coefficient indicates positive cooperativity (Rajendran and Nagy, 2003) ]. Interestingly, protein A at low concentrations (0.1-2 μM) had a Hill coefficient value of $ 1.433, whereas high protein concentrations had a higher value of $ 2.429 (Fig. 2G ). These results indicate that protein A binds to RNA1 in a cooperative manner, and higher protein A concentrations (42 μM) yield higher cooperativity. , in a binding buffer at 27 1C for 30 min and then analyzed in 1% agarose gel.
