Preparation and characterization of CD8 + -SAPN and empty-SAPN The SAPN constructs were expressed, purified and folded to form nanoparticles ( Fig. 1c-e) . The protein has a relative molecular weight of about 48 kDa on a Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 1c , e). Transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1d) showed a relatively uniform distribution of non-aggregated nanoparticles of about 30 nm in diameter. In vivo immunogenicity of CD8 + T cell-eliciting SAPNs HLA-A*1101-transgenic mice were immunized intramuscularly with CD8 + T cell-eliciting SAPNs combined with GLA-SE. Mice were immunized three times intramuscularly at 2 week intervals. Empty-SAPNs plus GLA-SE or PBS were used in sham immunizations of control mice. CD8 + -T cell-eliciting SAPN-GLA-SE vs. Empty-SAPN-GLA-SE were compared in HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice as described. Spleen cells were obtained from immunized HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice 2 weeks after final immunization. IFN-γ produced by splenocytes cultured with the pool of peptides was measured. Figure 2 shows IFN-γ secretion is high in mice immunized with CD8 + -T cell-eliciting SAPN plus GLA-SE when stimulated with PADRE or the GRA6 peptide. The other peptides also elicited IFN-γ production. In our earlier work, 25 and herein, effects of the separate peptides were additive (Figs. 2b and 3). The polyepitopes elicited the best response earlier 25 and herein (Fig. 3) . Figure 3a and b indicate that IFN-γ secretion in cultures with the SAG1, GRA6, GRA3, and SRS52A peptides was significantly enhanced by immunization with these peptides but not Empty-SAPN or PBS. Significantly more IFN-γ secretion was observed when cells were stimulated with these pooled peptides plus PADRE. Thus, the association of CD8 + T cell-and CD4 + T cellrestricted peptides contributes to IFN-γ production in HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice. In vitro TLR5 stimulation The SeaPorter TLR5 cell-line was exposed to varying concentrations of the SAPNs. The SAPN included: Empty-SAPN that do not contain the CD8 + epitopes but still have flagellin; CD8 + -SAPN containing the polypeptide with the five restricted CD8 + epitopes; recombinant polypeptide; and recombinant flagellin (as control). The concentrations of SAPNs used were 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml. Fold increase in SEAP expression for each protein sample over non-treated controls reflected level of TLR5 stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4a -c, TLR5 activity was Fig. 1 Assembly of CD8-SAPNs. a Phylogenetic tree showing 62 genetic isolates of Toxoplasma analyzed herein. These are in the multisequence alignments of proteins, and peptides derived from them, utilized to create our artificial immunogenic ("smart") protein. b Flagellin is used as a scaffold into which epitopes are intercalated from Toxoplasma. Earlier logic for inclusion of flagellin as adjuvant and scaffold came from work with malaria (http://www.internationalinnovation.com/build/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/David_Lanar_Intl_Innovation_ Infectious_Diseases_Research_Media_LR.pdf), 19 as well as with influenza. 24 Computer model of the prototype. The core particle composed of the pentameric and trimeric coiled coils is shown in green and blue, respectively. The following are attached to the trimeric coiled coil: the TRL5 agonist flagellin (D0 and D1 domains) (purple) with the A11 epitopes (yellow) and a CD4 epitope string (magenta). c SDS-PAGE of the purified protein. Lanes are as follows: Lane 1: MW (molecular weight markers). Lane 2-5: Elution fractions were from 19 to 22. Samples derive from the same experiment and the gels/blots were processed in parallel. d Transmission electron microscopy of the nanoparticle preparation. e SDS-PAGE 4-20% of the purified protein. Lane 1: MW (molecular weight markers). Lane 2: CD8-SAPN. Lane 3: Empty-SAPN. Samples derive from the same experiment and the gels/blots were processed in parallel significantly enhanced by the Empty-SAPNs and the CD8 + -T celleliciting SAPNs, but not the control polypeptide. Surprisingly, flagellin in Empty-SAPN particles have higher TLR5 activity than recombinant flagellin alone. SAPNs with GLA-SE adjuvant confer robust protection against T. gondii in HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice In the results shown in Fig. 5 , we had immunized mice with either CD8 + T cell-eliciting SAPN with GLA-SE adjuvant, or Empty-SAPN with GLA-SE adjuvant, or adjuvant alone, or PADRE alone, or PBS. We then challenged 2 weeks after the last immunization with Type II strains of T. gondii expressing luciferase. Brains from these mice were imaged with a Xenogen camera 21 days after challenge with 2000 Me49-Fluc tachyzoites. Figure 5a and b show that luminescence from T. gondii in mice immunized with CD8 + T cell-eliciting SAPN plus GLA-SE was significantly lower than in mice immunized with control Empty-SAPN plus GLA-SE, GLA-SE alone, PADRE alone, or PBS. This finding correlates with a reduction of the number of cysts per brain in mice that received CD8 + -T cell-eliciting SAPN plus GLA-SE adjuvant (Fig. 5c ).
