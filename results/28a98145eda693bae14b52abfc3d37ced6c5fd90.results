A combination of structural and biochemical approaches has established a critical role for CoV NSP16 in 2=O-MTase activity (Fig. 1A) . Stabilized by interactions with NSP10 (orange), NSP16 has been identified as a structurally conserved AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase (11) ; despite divergence in protein sequence across organisms, an invariant KDKE motif (red) within the methyltransferase core is required to mediate its activity (12) . This KDKE motif is highly conserved within all of the NSP16 sequences examined in the CoV family (Fig. 1B) . Importantly, mutation of any of the KDKE residues has been shown to ablate 2=O-MTase activity (11) . In addition, previous alteration of this motif in both group 2b SARS-CoV (10) and group 2a MHV (9) disrupted 2=O-MTase activity and attenuated various aspects of infection. On the basis of high conservation in the CoV family, we hypothesized that disruption of the KDKE motif would also attenuate other emerging CoV families, including group 2c MERS-CoV. Utilizing a MERS-CoV reversed genetic system (13), we disrupted the KDKE motif by mutating two nucleotides to produce a D130A change (Fig. 1A) . The resulting disrupted-NSP16 (dNSP16) mutant had no significant defect noted in stock titer generation (not shown); similarly, infection of both Vero cells and Calu-3 2B4 cells, a respiratory epithelial cell line, at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) demonstrated only modest attenuation at late time points (Fig. 1C and D) . Together, these results indicate that NSP16 activity is not required for replication. Similar in vitro host responses of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV dNSP16 mutants. Having established replication competence in both Vero and Calu-3 2B4 cells, we next evaluated the induction of host pathways following infection. Calu-3 2B4 cells infected at an MOI of 5 demonstrated no differences in replication (not shown) and only modest differences in host induction (zero genes with a log 2 change in expression of Ï¾1.5-fold), similar to observations with NSP16 mutant SARS-CoV compared with wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV (10). However, unlike in studies with SARS-CoV, a rapid cytopathic effect (CPE) by 24 h limited the analysis to early time points with WT and dNSP16 mutant Shown is NSP16 (gray) highlighting the conserved KDKE motif (red) required for 2=O-MTase activity. Also shown is the NSP10 scaffold required for MERS-CoV (orange). The inset displays conserved KDKE (left) and the D130A mutation (right) that disrupts function. Homology models were created with Modeler in the Max-Planck Institute Bioinformatics Toolkit. The known crystal structure of the NSP16-NSP10 complex (3R24 in the RCSB Protein Data Bank) was used as the template structure (38) . Homology models were then manipulated with MacPyMol. (B) Heat maps were constructed from a set of representative CoVs from all four genogroups by using alignment data paired with neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees built in Geneious (v.9.1.5) and visualized in EvolView
