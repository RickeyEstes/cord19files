Out of 114 studies related to HGS in the general population we extracted 330 study groups involving 90,520 subjects. For RA, 102 study groups were extracted from 71 studies involving 10,529 subjects (Fig. 1) . In the general population, HGS was measured using a hand-held dynamometer in 99.7% of the study groups and a sphygmomanometer in 0.3%, compared to 61.7% and 38.3%, respectively of the study groups in the RA population. Standard deviation of the mean HGS was reported in 82.1% and 79.4% of the study groups for the general and RA population, respectively. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the extracted study groups for the two populations apart. The median number of subjects per study group was 50.5 in the general population and 47.0 in the RA population. The age range of subjects within all study groups in the general population was 20-100 years (median 65.0) and in the RA population 31-65 years (median 55.1). Clinical parameters (VAS and HAQ scores) and inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR) were reported more frequently in the RA population compared to the general population. The RA population had higher pain score, poorer general health and elevated inflammatory markers compared to the general population. RA disease duration was reported for 86% of the RA study groups. Table 2 shows the mean HGS values according to age for the general and RA population for males and females separately. In the general population, HGS diminished gradually with age, with a change point at age 50 years after which there was a steeper decline in HGS (Table 3 and Fig. 2) . The annual decline of HGS loss was 0.06 kg from age 20 years to 50 years and 0.37 kg from 50 years onwards. In the RA population, HGS values were much lower compared to that of the general population of similar age range. In fact, they were comparable to that of the oldest old in the general population. No association was noted between chronological age and HGS in the RA population (Table 3 and Fig. 3a) . However, RA disease duration was significantly associated with a decline in HGS over time, with an annual rate of loss of 0.34 kg at age 55.6 years (95% CI: −0.58 to −0.10) (Fig. 3b) . The availability of additional characteristics, such as anthropomorphic measurements and inflammatory markers was too small to adjust for in the final analysis for the general and RA population. However, when the adjustment was performed on height and weight in the general population, results did not change significantly (data not shown).
