To examine the role of RNA sequences surrounding the M-MuLV gag amber codon in suppression, we set up an in vitro translation system for analysis of the products of gag and pal genes. An M-MuLV DNA fragment containing the corresponding sequences [nucleotides 567 to 4894 (according to the sequence of Shinnick et a/., 1981) ] was inserted in the polylinker site of pSP64, downstream to the SP6 promoter. The clone, designated pSPgp, served as a template in the SP6 RNA polymerase transcription system (Melton et al., 1984) . The DNA templates were linearized at the BarnHI restriction site (nucleotide 3229) within the pol gene, and transcribed. The run-off BAM-RNA (2662 bases long) was translated, using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system. 35S-labeled translation products were immunoprecipitated with anti-p30 rabbit sera and fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Laemmli, 1970) . The clearly discernible 65-kDa protein band represents the predicted product of the gag gene (G) (Fig. 1 A, lane 1) . In addition, a 94-kDa protein band was observed when BAM-RNA was translated. This translation product corresponded in size to the expected runoff Gag-Pol fusion protein, as calculated from the M-MuLV DNA sequence (Shinnick et a/., 1981) . To verify the identity of the runoff protein product, the DNA template pSPgp was linearized at the SalI restriction site (nucleotide 3705) within the pal gene and transcribed into SAL-RNA of 3138 bases long. The translation products of this RNA ( Fig. 1 A, lane 2) corresponds to the 65-kDa Gag protein and to the readthrough product of 110 kDa. The SAL-RNA readthrough product is larger than the BAM-RNA product by 16 kDa as expected from the difference in the size of the two RNAs. Thus, both the immunoprecipitation reaction and the translations of two related RNAs indicated that the runoff product represents the Gag-Pol polyprotein. In repeated experiments BAM-RNA appeared to serve as a more efficient template for synthesis of the Gag-Pol runoff fusion protein compared to longer RNAs with 3' ends located further downstream in the pal gene. The Gag-Pol translation products of the later RNAs were distributed between the runoff proteins and a shorter 92-kDa protein which probably represent a premature termination product. We, therefore, used the BAM-RNA in all subsequent experiments. In a translation mixture without exogenous RNA none of the M-MuLV translation products was immunoprecipitated, indicating the specific-ity of the antiserum for M-MuLV p30 (Fig. lA, lane 3) . We conclude that authentic suppression of the UAG termination codon occurs in the in vitro translation system, giving rise to Gag-Pol and Gag polypeptides, with molar ratio of 1:20-l :50, as determined by densitometry measurements, in the range observed previously in vitro and in viva (Jamjoom et al., 1977; Murphy et a/., 1978) . The pattern of low molecular weight proteins observed in Fig. 1 A, lane 1 , is similar to that obtained prior to immunoprecipitation (data not shown). These Gag containing polyproteins could result either from internal translation initiation of the Gag protein or premature termination and they are typical by-products of in vitro translation systems (Philipson eta/., 1978; Feng et a/., 1989a) . To determine whether the level of translation level through the amber codon located between the gag and pal genes is unique, or may represent a general infidelity of the reticulocyte translation system, we converted, by site-directed mutagenesis (Morinaga et a/., 1984) a glutamine codon (CAG) within the gag gene (nucleotides 1623-1625) to a UAG codon (pSPg). Screening of the mutants was carried out by differential colony hybridization, and the mutations were verified by DNA sequencing (Sanger et al., 1977) . Translation of the RNA transcribed from pSPg (g-RNA) was expected to terminate at the UAG codon and yield a 40-kDa truncated Gag product. Suppression of the inserted amber codon would have produced, in addition, a full-size 65-kDa Gag protein. Only the 40-kDa viral specific protein was observed, even after long exposure periods of the autoradiograms (Fig. lB, lane 4) . The additional 47-kDa translation product represents an endogenous reticulocyte protein as it also appears in the control without viral RNA (lane 5). This result indicates that unique signals which control the amber codon suppression may be present at the gag-pal junction. Scanning the sequences of different retroviruses at the gag-pol or gag-pro junctions revealed a common five nucleotide long purine-rich stretch (mostly G's) adjacent to the gag termination codon (Weiss et a/., 1984) . To test the function of this consensus sequence in translation readthrough, we substituted the nucleotide sequence GGAGG following the amber codon with ACGCG, giving rise to plasmid pSPgp1 ( Fig. 2A) . Translation readthrough of the gag termination codon was completely abolished when RNA transcribed off pSPgp1 (gpl-RNA) served as a template (Fig. 2B , lane 2) demonstrating the importance of this nucleotide sequence in M-MuLV suppression. Ribosomal frameshifting mechanism in several retroviruses appears to involve an RNA stem and loop DNA sequence analysis of M-MuLV and the related AKV and FeLV revealed a putative secondary structure flanking the gag-pal amber codon (Shinnick et al., 1981; Herr, 1984; Laprevotte et al., 1984;  Fig. 2A ). To investigate the role of this structure in suppression we destabilized the stem by creating four-nucleotide changes within the sequence indicated as (a) region or the (b) region (pSPgpA and pSPgpB; Fig. 2A ). As shown in Fig. 2B , suppression efficiency directed by SPA-RNA (lane 4) was equal to wild-type levels (lane l), indicating that this putative stem and loop RNA structure does not play an important role in the suppression process. However, suppression was abolished in pSPgpB (Fig. 2B, lane 3) . In light of this observation, we considered the following possibilities: either the mutated sequence (b) which is adjacent to the GGAGG sequence represents an extended primary signal essential for suppression, or an additional interaction may occur between the mutated nucleotides in the (b) region and nucleotides downstream in the mRNA to create an alternative secondary structure to that discussed above. Sequences within 100 nucleotides of the suppression site were analyzed, and a potential stem and loop structure downstream to the amber codon was identified (Fig. 3A) . Furthermore, close examination of the sequence revealed a stretch of 6 guanosine residues, 16 nucleotides downstream to the predicted stem and loop, which could potentially base-pair with a stretch of cytosine residues in the singlestrand loop region of the second hairpin, to create a pseudoknot. Based on this observation, we sought a direct evidence for interaction between the (b)-(c) sequences in the proposed stem and loop, by introducing destabilizing mutagenic changes within the (c) region (Fig. 3A) . A significantly reduced suppression efficiency was observed with gPC RNA (Fig. 3B, lane 4) . Since residual readthrough was so low with this RNA, densitometric analysis could not be applied to quantitate the Gag-Pol product. Finally, to examine the importance of the proposed secondary RNA structure (b)-(c) in the readthrough process, complementary mutagenic changes were made both in (b) and (c) sequences of the same plasmid, restoring the potential for stem and loop formation by a different sequence (pSPgpBC). Suppression efficiency was not restored in the double-mutant gpBC-RNA (lane 3) compared with gpB-RNA (lane 2). Thus, mutations at sequences extending at least 50 bases 3'to the amber codon affect the translational readthrough. Sequences immediately distal to the UAG codon (mutations pSPgp1, pSPgpB) are of major importance for the event whereas further downstream sequences (mutation pSPgpC) may have a somewhat smaller effect on the readthrough frequency.
