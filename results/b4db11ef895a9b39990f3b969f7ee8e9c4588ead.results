The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients enrolled in the study are detailed in Table I . There were no significant differences among the 4 groups in terms of age and sex distribution. The average 20-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test score, computed tomographic grade, and endoscopic score are also summarized in Table I . Respiratory viruses were detected in 3 (14.28%) of 21 mucosal scraping samples from control subjects, 6 (16.67%) of 36 samples from patients with CRSsNP, 7 (18.42%) of 38 patients with CRSwNP (noneosinophilic), and 4 (11.42%) of 35 patients with CRSwNP (eosinophilic). The respiratory virus detection rate was not significantly different among the 4 groups (Table I) . To determine whether the interferon-mediated antiviral responses are active in inflamed sinonasal mucosa, transcripts and protein levels of IFN-b, IFN-l1, IFN-l2, OAS, Mx1, and viperin were measured in normal and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue. Compared with normal mucosal tissue, IFN-b, IFN-l1, IFN-l2, OAS, Mx1, and viperin mRNA and protein levels were reduced in inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue of patients with CRSsNP or those with CRSwNP (Fig 1, A and B) . However, there were no significant differences in expression levels among patients with CRSsNP, patients with noneosinophilic CRSwNP, or patients with eosinophilic CRSwNP (Fig 1, A and B) . Because the sinonasal epithelium is the first line of defense against respiratory tract viruses, we investigated levels of antiviral factors in cultured epithelial cells from normal sinus mucosal tissue and inflammatory epithelial cells from sinus mucosal tissue of patients with CRSwNP and patients with CRSsNP. The results also showed reduced levels of IFN-b, IFN-l1, IFN-l2, OAS, Mx1, and viperin in cultured inflammatory epithelial cells from patients with CRSwNP and those with CRSsNP compared with levels seen in normal epithelial cells (Fig 1, C-E) . Additionally, levels of these factors were not different among inflammatory epithelial cells from patients with CRSsNP, patients with noneosinophilic CRSwNP, or patients with eosinophilic CRSwNP (Fig 1, C-E) . To date, however, the mechanism involved in the reduction of these antiviral factors in patients with CRS has not been described. Therefore we investigated whether CRS-related cytokines regulate levels of antiviral factors in the sinonasal mucosa. Cultured normal and inflammatory epithelial cells were incubated with T H 1 and T H 2 cytokines, and levels of antiviral factors were then determined by means of ELISA and Western blotting. Compared with unstimulated control cells, IFN-b levels were decreased in cultured normal epithelial cells treated with IL-4 or IL-13 (Fig 2, A and B) . OAS levels were downregulated in cells incubated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-a, and TGF-b, whereas IFN-l1 and IFN-l2 levels showed no change (Fig 2, C-H) . Mx1 levels were downregulated in cells treated with IL-4 and IL-5 (Fig 2, I and J) . Additionally, viperin levels were reduced in cells stimulated with IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, or TNF-a (Fig 2, K and L) . 1.

Subsequently, we assessed whether antiviral factors are upregulated in the sinus mucosal tissue of patients with CRSwNP and those with CRSsNP after macrolide therapy, which is frequently used to treat CRS. Cultured epithelial cells from normal sinus mucosal tissue of control subjects and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue of patients with CRSwNP and those with CRSsNP were treated with various concentrations of clarithromycin or azithromycin, and cell viability was assessed by using the MTT assay. The macrolide concentrations used did not affect cell viability (data not shown). After stimulation with macrolides for 24 hours, levels of antiviral factors were measured by using real-time PCR, ELISA, and Western blotting (Figs 3 and 4) . mRNA and protein levels of IFN-b were upregulated, both in normal epithelial cells and in inflammatory epithelial cells differentiated from patients with CRSsNP who were treated with 1, 10, or 50 mmol/L clarithromycin (Fig 3, A and B) . However, IFN-b levels in inflammatory epithelial cells from patients with noneosinophilic and those with eosinophilic CRSwNP increased at 1 and 10 mmol/L clarithromycin treatment (Fig 3, A and B) .

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 144, NUMBER 6 with CRSsNP, IFN-l1 levels increased with 10 and 50 mmol/L clarithromycin treatment, whereas inflammatory epithelial cells from patients with CRSwNP showed IFN-l1 upregulation with 10 mmol/L clarithromycin treatment (Fig 3, C and D) . Thus clarithromycin-treated cells exhibited differential increases in levels of antiviral factors compared with nontreated cells (Fig 3) , depending on the type of cultured epithelial cells (normal or inflammatory), type of antiviral factors, or clarithromycin concentration. Similar findings were observed in epithelial cells treated with azithromycin (Fig 4) . Cultured normal and inflammatory epithelial cells were treated with various dexamethasone concentrations (1 3 10 23 mmol/L-5 mmol/L) and cell viability was assessed by using the MTT assay to study the effect of dexamethasone on the expression of antiviral factors. Cell viability was not affected based on the dexamethasone concentrations used (data , and viperin (K and L) in supernatants and cells harvested from cultured normal epithelial cells derived from normal sinus mucosal tissue and inflammatory epithelial cells derived from patients with CRSsNP and those with CRSwNP, respectively, which were incubated with 1, 10, and 50 mmol/L azithromycin for 24 hours.

Increased OAS levels were also detected in dexamethasone-treated inflammatory epithelial cells derived from sinus mucosal tissue of patients with CRSwNP or patients   FIG 6.

Mx1 levels were not altered in normal and inflammatory epithelial cells treated with dexamethasone (Fig 5, I and J) . Viperin levels in normal epithelial cells increased with approximately 1 3 10 22 to 10 21 mmol/L dexamethasone treatment, whereas in inflammatory epithelial cells from patients with CRSsNP or those with CRSwNP, viperin levels increased with 1 3 10 21 or 1 3 10 23 mmol/L dexamethasone treatment, respectively (Fig 5, K and L) . Expression levels of TLR3 and TLR7 were evaluated with real-time PCR and Western blotting. No significant differences were found between normal and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue (Fig 6, B-E) . Both types of receptors were commonly distributed in superficial epithelial cells, submucosal glands, and blood vessels in both normal and inflammatory sinus mucosal tissue (Fig 6, A) . In addition, IFN-b, viperin, Mx1, and OAS in mucosal tissue were commonly localized to the superficial epithelial layer and submucosal glands (see Fig E1 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Cultured normal and inflammatory epithelial cells were incubated with the TLR agonists to investigate whether viral infection can induce expression of antiviral factors in the sinus mucosa. Levels of all evaluated antiviral factors increased in both normal and inflammatory epithelial cells treated with poly (I:C) but not R848 (Fig 7) .
