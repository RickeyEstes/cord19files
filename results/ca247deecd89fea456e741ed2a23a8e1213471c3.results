Between August 2015 and March 2019, there were a total of 1,995 FVHH observations with an average of 49 observations/month. There were ~3,300 family members and visitors/month. Assuming that each person touches the child once (some touch the child more than once and some not at all), we estimate that we captured about 1.5% of the FVHH opportunities. Figure 1 shows the annotated run chart of FVHH compliance in the NICU by month. Baseline compliance was around 27%. During the FVHH pilot project (October-December, 2015), FVHH increased to 79% in the 3 test pods. There was a lag between the expansion of FVHH observations across the NICU in February of 2016, and the spread of improvement interventions (July 2016), resulting in a brief drop in FVHH. With the addition of just-in-time education during visitor screening in May 2017, FVHH increased to a median of 85%. Data for staff reminding families and visitors to perform hand hygiene were available starting July 2016. Observers were able to intervene 54% of the time. When staff intervened, the reminders were well received, and families and visitors performed hand hygiene 99% of the time. Visitor screening data for the NICU were available from January 2016 to March 2019. During this time, there were 128,837 family members and visitors screened before entry into the NICU, including 11,132 children. Unfortunately, Unit Secretaries did not document symptomatic visitors, who were asked to defer visitation, limiting our ability to quantify the impact of screening. Between January 2013 and March 2019, there were 74 HARVIs identified in the NICU, including 2 clusters (May 2013 and December 2014). Rhinovirus/enterovirus caused 80% of the HARVIs, and RSV caused 6%. No HARVIs were caused by influenza. The baseline rate of HARVIs in the NICU was 0.67 infections/1,000 patient days. Coinciding with an increase in FVHH to 85% in May 2017, the HARVI rate decreased to 0.23/1,000 patient-days (Fig. 2) . Figure 3 shows the monthly number of RPP tests ordered in the NICU. Test utilization remained fairly consistent over time. Figure 4 shows the monthly distribution of respiratory viruses detected by the RPP panel. We observed the typical seasonal fluctuation with peak utilization and virus detection in the winter months. Rhinovirus/enterovirus and RSV were detected most frequently (Fig. 4) . For the most part, NICU HARVIs occurred sporadically throughout the year. Etiologies paralleled the most frequently detected viruses in the hospital-wide data.
