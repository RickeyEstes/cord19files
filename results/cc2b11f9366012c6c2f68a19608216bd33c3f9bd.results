A total of 117 children aged 15 days to 24 months hospitalized for ALRTI were recruited for the study between 21 December 2010 and 1 April 2011, which represented 23% of children under 2 years of age hospitalized during the same period. The majority of patients (92.3%) came from the province of Blida. The maximum number of samples was taken during weeks 52, 06 and 07, and 10, corresponding respectively to the last week of December and mid-February, and the first week of March. These 4 weeks represent more than one third (36.7%) of the samples (Fig. 1 ). Most children underwent nasal swabbing (59%); just over one third (39%) underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing. One or more respiratory tropism viruses were identified in 97 children (82.9%) (Fig. 2 ). In 19 children (16.2%), no respiratory virus among those tested was detected. In 25 children (21.4%), several respiratory viruses were identified as virus coinfection. In 72 children (62%), the viral infection was attributable to a single virus (Fig. 2) . Positivity rates exceeded 80% in all age groups and reached 100% in those over 18 months of age. However, it should be noted that the numbers were very low in these age groups ( Table 1 ). There was no difference by sex (p 0.99). Of the nine viruses searched for, only six were identified: RSV (n = 56), rhinovirus (n = 27), metapneumovirus (n = 26), adenovirus (n = 9), influenza virus (n = 6) and parainfluenza type 3 (n = 3). No parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2 and 4 were identified; and no coronavirus was isolated (Fig. 3 ).
