A total of 54 databases were identified, 37 from citations in articles found on MEDLINE and 18 from informal searches. Twenty-four of these databases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Those databases which were excluded are detailed in Appendix 1, 42-82 no Spanish DID was excluded. Of the selected DIDs, 6 were edited in Spain, 14 in the United States, 3 in the United Kingdom, and 1 in France. Among the Spanish databases, 1 was recovered from MEDLINE and the remaining 5 from grey literature. Nine DIDs met the minimum quality criteria (Table 2) , whereas 15 did not and, therefore, the remaining quality criteria were not applied to these. Table 3 28-41 summarises the characteristics of these unevaluated DIDs. Among the databases which did not fulfil the minimum criteria, 3 did not meet any of the 4 criteria, 2 failed to meet 3 criteria, 5 did not meet 2 criteria, and 5 failed to meet just 1 criterion. With regard to structural quality, the values obtained for the different DIDs which exceeded the minimum criteria were: Bot-plus 11 and Medinteract 12 (100%), Gu√≠a de la SEFH, 13 Lexi-interact 14 and Medscape 15 (89%), Hansten 16 (83%), Micromedex 17 and Stockley 18 (78%), and Drug Interaction Facts 19 (67%). Table 4 summarises the degree of compliance with each criteria for all of the analysed DIDs. The stratification of the degree of severity is the most common criterion overall. The Spanish DIDs have more of a tendency to include a description of severity, bibliographical reference, and description of clinical management, whereas the DIDs of other countries more frequently include classification of the level of evidence.
