During nearly 9 years, we included 3,214 children out of 3,932 (81.7%) with acute RTI into our main study cohort (Fig 1) . Among the 56.5% (1816/3214) of hospitalized children with LRTI, HMPV was detected in 9.4% (171/1816) and RSV in 47.3% (859/1816), while 0.6% (11/1816) had both HMPV and RSV (Fig 1) . In total, 1,041 HMPV-and RSV-infected children were included in the present study (Fig 1) . Their median age was 8.7 months (range 0.3-189.1 months) and the majority was younger than 5 years old (97.9%, 1019/1041). NPA were collected from 85.7% (892/1041) of these children within 24 hours after presentation, and within 48 hours in 96.0% (999/1041).
