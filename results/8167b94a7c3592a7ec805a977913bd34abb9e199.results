The panellists agreed that a fi ve category disposition classifi cation system was optimum, for the intended task (table 1) . Consensus was reached on the understanding and wording of the categories. The upper limit of risk tolerance for a consequential medical event for the fi rst category was less than 4%. This category represented patients who the panellists judged to be at low risk of a consequential medical event if discharged early; on the assumption that no skilled medical care was available outside the hospital setting. An example would be a patient admitted for intravenous antibiotics for uncomplicated cellulitis, who could readily be discharged and switched to oral medication. The next categories had upper limits of risk tolerance of about 12%, 33%, 60%, and 100% respectively. The panellists agreed that category 2 represented those patients who, although at some risk of a consequential medical event, might nonetheless warrant discharge if surge capacity was needed for victims of a disaster; especially if incoming victims are at higher risk of consequential medical event than those patients considered for discharge. Panellists also agreed that this category of patients could warrant discharge in certain biothreat or other contagion situations in which spread of disease in hospitals would present a substantial added risk. An example would be a patient with acute coronary syndrome with no evidence of high risk for adverse events. Category 3 represented patients who were potentially suitable for transfer to another medical facility. As a group, the risk was judged too high for simple discharge home. An example would be a stable elderly patient who is progressing well 3 days after hip-fracture surgery. Category 4 patients were those at substantial risk and judged likely to need continued acute-hospital resources. Examples of such patients include those in need of emergency surgery, those in need of pressors, and those in active labour. Finally, category 5 patients were those who might be too unstable or critically ill even for transfer to another appropriate facility. Most of these patients would require specialised medical care. Most patients in intensive-care units would be in this category. Table 2 shows the consensus list of critical interventions that if withdrawn would result in a consequential medical event. Less than half the critical interventions were assessed as 7 or higher (on a scale of 1-10). Only two-thirds were ranked higher than 5. For every situation, panellists' scoring for critical interventions that were withdrawn compared with those that were not available or withheld was much the same as that for critical interventions that were withheld.
