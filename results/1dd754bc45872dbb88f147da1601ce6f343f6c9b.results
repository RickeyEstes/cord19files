The experiment was originally planned for 42 d; however, it was terminated on d 35 due to increasing mortality of control broilers. Mortality was the result of a natural challenge occurring in the facility. Broilers were necropsied by a trained pathologist and confirmed to have necrotic enteritis and cultured positive for Escherichia coli and Salmonella. Furthermore, the broilers were exhibiting rickets as a result of malabsorption from severe necrotic enteritis and had litter in the gizzard. No interactions (P > 0.10) between duration of feeding (continuous or not) or form (powder vs. granular) of SDP were noted (Table 3) . Compared with that of control broilers, the addition of SDP improved (P < 0.05) average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed effi- Figure 1 ). Compared with that of broilers consuming powdered SDP, granulated SDP improved (P < 0.05) ADG and feed efficiency from d 0 to 14 and improved (P = 0.10) ADFI from d 15 to 28 (Table 3) . Overall (d 0 to 35; Table 3 ), no differences (P > 0.10) were noted in ADG, ADFI, and feed efficiency due to different plasma forms (granular vs. powder). Granulation improved BW of broilers when measured on d 14 (P = 0.04), 21 (P = 0.09), and 35 (P = 0.08) compared with broilers consuming powder SDP (Table 4) . Continuous feeding of SDP improved (P < 0.05; Table 3 ) ADG, ADFI, and feed efficiency for each period (d 15 to 28, 29 to 35, and 0 to 35) compared with that of broilers when SDP was removed from the diet on d 14. Body weight was also improved (P < 0.05; Table 4 ) on d 28 and 35 when broilers continued to consume SDP compared with broilers when SDP was removed from the diet on d 14. Average daily feed intake of control broilers was lower than that of SDP-fed broilers (P < 0.05) by d 9 and began to plateau by d 14 ( Figure  2) . Additionally, the removal of SDP from the diet on d 14 (discontinued treatments Powder/ D and Granular/D; Figure 2 ) resulted in ADFI Values represent the mean of 8 replicates per treatment with 6 broilers per pen. ADG = average daily gain; ADFI = average daily feed intake. NS = nonsignificant at P > 0.10. Powder = spray-dried powder plasma (AP 920) [7] ; Granular = spraydried granular plasma (Appetein) [7] . 2 Contrasts were as follows: 1) control (treatment 1) vs. SDP (treatments 2, 3, 4, and 5); 2) Powder (treatments 2 and 3) vs. Granular (treatments 4 and 5); 3) SDP continuous feeding (treatments 2 and 4) vs. SDP discontinued feeding (treatments 3 and 5); 4) interaction of feeding duration and form of SDP (treatments 3 and 4 vs. 2 and 5). plateauing by d 20 but remaining significantly greater (P < 0.05) than control broilers.

Mortality of control broilers began to increase by d 15 of the experiment and continued through- out the experiment (Figure 1 ). Spray-dried plasma improved (P < 0.05) liveability, and the effect was independent (P > 0.10) of SDP form (powder or granular) or duration of feeding (continuous or not).
