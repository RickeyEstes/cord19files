Six students were excluded because of absence on two consecutive visits. There was no difference in the gender ratio of these six students (n Z 6, 4 boys and 2 girls) with that of the groups who participated. However, these six students were a little older than their counterparts (Z of Mann Whitney U test Z Ã€2.645, p < 0.01). In total, 271 students (97.8%) completed all questionnaires and the interview. Among them, 124 (45.8%) were boys and 147 (54.2%) were girls. Their mean age was 13.4 years (standard deviation Z 1.0 years, range: 12e15 years). Of the 271 students, 70 (25.8%) met the PTSD diagnostic criteria in relation to Typhoon Morakot. The mean of the total scores of the IES-R was 16.9 (standard deviation Z 16.2) with a range from 0 to 82. Factor analysis yielded three factors with eigenvalues exceeding unity, and these accounted for 58.1% of the total variance. Six items (Item 1, 3, 6 According to the meanings of the items making up each factor, the three factors were labeled as intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance, respectively (Table 1) . Based on the items making up the newly extracted factors, the analyses of internal consistency revealed Cronbach's alpha values of 0.89, 0.85, and 0.88 for the intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal subscales, respectively. The overall Cronbach's alpha for the total IES-R was 0.94. The criteria validity of the IES-R for PTSD was examined using ROC analyses (Fig. 1) . The area under the ROC curve was 0.92 (95% confidence interval Z 0.88e0.96), which indicated excellent criteria validity for the IES-R in relation to a diagnosis of PTSD. Table 2 shows the criteria validity of the IES-R in terms of sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and overall misclassification rate (OMR) at various different cutoff points. As the IES-R is treated to be used as a screening tool, which suggests a requirement for greater sensitivity, we suggest that the optimal cutoff point for the IES-R should be 19 of 20, which gives a sensitivity of 85.7%, a specificity of 84.1%, a PPV of 65.2%, a NPV of 94.4%, and an OMR of 15.5%.
