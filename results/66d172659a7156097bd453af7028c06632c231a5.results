Fourteen hundred telephone numbers were called and 821 interviews completed. There were 166 refusals; 111 respondents did not meet the eligibility criteria; and 302 were unable to be contacted; a participation rate of 83%. Follow-up interviews were completed with 39% (49/127) of respondents who stated that they had previously handled bats. The median age of respondents was 58 years. The study population was compared with the NSW general population (Table 1 ). There were more females (63%) than males and the age distribution was older in the study group. Participants living in lower socio economic postal areas were over-represented in the study group (64.3% vs 54.6% in the general population) (data not shown). Sixty-eight respondents indicated that they worked with animals, including two veterinarians, four animal volunteer carers, one bat handler and 47 farmers.
