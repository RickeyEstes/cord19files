Epidemiological characteristics of A(H7N9) patients and poultry workers. A total of 102 laboratory-confirmed A(H7N9) patients were included in this study (Table 1) . Among these patients, 98% When compared to those who survived, patients who died were significantly older, with more incidence of chronic pulmonary diseases and significantly higher levels of urea, creatinine, bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, C-reactive protein and d-dimer, as well as the higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, but significantly lower levels of hemoglobin. A total of 106 healthy poultry workers were included as controls. These healthy poultry workers were intentionally recruited since they were the most comparable population to A(H7N9) patients in terms of the virus exposure, the key determinant for human A(H7N9) infection. There was no significant difference in the proportion of female between the A(H7N9) cases and poultry worker controls (34% (35/102) vs 35% (37/106), P 5 1.000). However, the A(H7N9) patients were significantly older than the poultry worker controls (median age: 61 years [interquartile range, 50 , 68 years] vs 48.5 years [interquartile range, 46 , 53 years]; P , 0.001). Our attempt to recruit age-comparable controls for the patients was unsuccessful due to the job requirement for poultry workers; since poultry trafficking and transaction involve numerous physicallychallenging labors, which would be too demanding for people at their sixties.
