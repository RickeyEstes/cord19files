Of 805 Inner Mongolia (6) Heilongjiang (4) Jilin (3) Liaoning (6) 45 types of pathogens were detected in participants: 18 respiratory pathogens (19 662 cases), ten gastrointestinal pathogens (189 cases), seven vector-borne pathogens (831 cases), seven blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted pathogens (1531 cases), and three mucocutaneous pathogens (584 cases; figure 2A) . The most frequent respiratory infection was influenza virus, followed by rhinovirus ( figure 2A) . Dengue was the most common vector-borne disease, hepatitis B virus infection was the most common blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted infection, and hand, foot, and mouth disease was the most common mucocutaneous infection ( figure 2A) . 16 237 (83%) respiratory infections, 76 (40%) gastrointestinal infections, 553 (67%) vector-borne infections, and 346 (85%) of the 406 cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease were detected by fever screening (figure 2B). 9812 (43%) of participants arrived from a different country (140 countries represented), whereas 12 985 (57%) came from Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan. The types and distribution of infection differed substantially between these two groups (figure 3). 12 126 (93%) of the 12 985 cases arriving from Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan were respiratory infections. Influenza was the most common infection in both groups, accounting for 6738 (69%) cases in the international group and 10 749 (83%) cases in the Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan group ( figure 3) . However, hepatitis B and C virus infections, syphilis, HIV, malaria, and dengue were substantially more common in the international group, whereas respiratory infections with rhinovirus, para influenza virus and metapneumovirus, and hand, foot, and mouth disease were more common in travellers from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan ( figure 3) . In the international travel group, infection was acquired in the Western Pacific region by 5153 (53%) people, in the South-East Asia region by 2666 (27%), in the European Taiwan region by 838 (9%), in the American region by 432 (4%), in the African region by 448 (5%), and in the Eastern Mediterranean region by 275 (3%). Influenza accounted for more than two-thirds of cases among travellers who acquired infections in the Western Pacific, South-East Asia, European, American, and Eastern Mediterranean regions (appendix p 7). People with gastrointestinal infections mainly travelled from countries in the South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions ( figure 4B ). Vector-borne diseases, including dengue and malaria, were predominantly diagnosed among travellers from countries in western and central Africa and the South-East Asia region (figure 4C). Cases with mucocutaneous infections mostly come from countries in the Western Pacific region and eastern Europe (figure 4). We noted seasonal patterns of travel-related infections, which differed between the international travellers (infection peak in November and December) and those who travelled from Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan (respiratory infections peak in February and June, mucocutaneous infection peak in May and July; appendix p 8).
