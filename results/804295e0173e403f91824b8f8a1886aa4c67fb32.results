Normal rectal temperatures (38.0-39.5Â°C) and no respiratory signs were observed in any of the calves throughout the study. The 'experimental' calves from the vaccinated dams had higher body weight gains, lower morbidity index and improved feed conversion ratios when compared to the control group, but no clinical differences were observed. The colostrum of unvaccinated cows specific gravity ranged from 1.045 to 1.050 which correlates to an Ig concentration of 47.2-62.5 mg/ml. However, the specific gravity in the colostrum derived from the vaccinated dams was more than 1.050 (>62.5 mg/ml of Ig). In the experimental group the M. haemolytica specific antibody levels were >12.6 (2LOG) for the first 3 weeks compared to 10.2 (2LOG) in the control group. These values declined slightly but the experimental group titres remained higher than the control groups throughout the experiment (Table 1) . The BRSV and PI3V antibody titres were significantly higher in the experimental calves throughout the study (Figs. 1 and 2 respectively). For adenovirus type 3 in the experimental calves titres were generally higher than control values until the eighth week, however after that the control levels rapidly increased and remained higher than the experimental values until the end of the study (Fig. 3) . With the exception of the fourth and seventh week the antibody titres to BHV1 in the experimental calves was higher than the control values throughout the study (Fig. 4) . With the exception of the second, third, seventh and ninth week when antibodies titres to BVDV were higher in the control group, similar titres were observed for both groups throughout the study (Fig. 5) . The gamma globulin concentration was stable and had comparable values in both groups until week 7 when the experimental group showed a steady increase in levels, however by week 9 in the control group the gamma globulin concentration rapidly increased and remained higher than the experimental groups until the end of the study (Fig. 6) . The IgA levels in the experimental group were very high at week 1 compared to the control group but dropped by week 2. However they were slightly higher throughout the study when compared to the control, with the exception of week 9. Statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed at the first, sixth and seventh week (Fig. 7) . The IgM levels in the experimental group were very high at week 1 and then decreased but remained higher than the control group until week 8 with the exception of week 5. From the ninth week until the end of the study IgM levels in the control group were higher than experimental values. Statistically significant differences between the two groups were observed at the 1st, 2nd, 11th and 12th weeks (Fig. 8) . The levels of IgG in the control calves remained stable throughout the study. In contrast, the experimental group had very low values at week 1 and then were consistently higher when compared to the control group until the end of the study at week 12. Statistically significant differences between the groups were observed throughout the study (Fig. 9 ). In the experimental animals Hp concentration increased in 10week-old calves but returned to the background level 1 week later (Fig. 10) . However, in the control animals an increase in Hp concentrations occurred at week 9 and continued to a maximum value of 1.14 mg/ml by the end of the experiment in week 12 (almost six times higher than seen in the experimental calves). The SAA concentration was significantly higher in the experimental calves compared to the control values at different time points until the ninth week. Then the concentration increased in the control group while the experimental group declined giving a statistically significant differences until week 12 (Fig. 11) .
