HSct recipients and control group characteristics. During the study period, 27 HSCT recipients were recruited. Their main characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . The median age of patients was 7.7 years (IQR 9.2). All HSCT were allogenic. Twenty-five patients underwent HSCT for the first time (93%) and two received their second HSCT (7%). Eighteen healthy children were included in the control group, 10 male (56%) and 8 female (44%), with a median age of 8.7 years (IQR 9). There were no significant differences regarding age and sex between HSCT recipients and healthy controls.
