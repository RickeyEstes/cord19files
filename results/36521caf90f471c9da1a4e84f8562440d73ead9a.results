By February 8 th there were 37,198 confirmed cases nationally, with 27,100 of these cases in Hubei (72.9% of all cases), and 14,982 in Wuhan (40.2% of all cases). All models applied to these data estimated the basic reproduction number effectively. Basic reproduction numbers for all fives methods for the entire time period, the pre-closure period and the post-closure period, are shown in Table 1 . The best-fitting method in the entire period was the method based on time-dependent reproduction numbers, while the pre-closure and post-closure period were best fitted by the exponential growth model. The weighted average estimate of the basic reproduction number shows that the epidemic slowed down after the closure of Wuhan city, dropping from 4.38 (95% CI 3.63 -5.13) before the closure to 3.41 (95% CI 3.16 -3.65) after. The 95% confidence intervals for the exponential growth estimate of post-closure " do not overlap the point estimate for the pre-closure period, indicating that there was a significant reduction in the basic reproduction number after the closure of Wuhan. Figure 1 shows the model predictions from all five models plotted against the observed cases for the pre-closure period (top left panel), post-closure period (top right panel) and entire period (bottom panel). A similar figure, with only the best-fitting model shown, is given in Supplementary Figure S2 . From figure 1 it is clear that models that estimated low values for the basic reproduction number in the pre-closure period or the entire period, such as the Sequential Bayesian model, produced very poor predictions that under-estimated the epidemic, and the bestfitting models were those that identified basic reproduction numbers over 4 in the preclosure period, and over 3 in the entire epidemic period.
