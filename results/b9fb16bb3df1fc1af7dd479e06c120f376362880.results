The results reported among the 47 diarrhoeic samples analysed include representatives of 12 virus species corresponding to 8 genera of RNA viruses (Additional file 1): Kobuvirus, Rotavirus (RVA, RVB and RVC), Sapovirus (SAV), Mamastrovirus (Porcine Astrovirus types 3 -AstV3 -, 4 -AstV4 -and 5 -AstV5 -), Alphacoronavirus (PEDV), Enterovirus (Enterovirus G, EntVG), Pasivirus (PasiV) and Posavirus (PosaV). The most commonly reported RNA virus was KobuV, followed by RVA, RVC, SAV, RVB and AstV3 (N values in Fig. 1 ). Among the 9 diarrhoeic samples where a single virus was detected, RVA was present in 5 samples and KobuV was present in 4. Thirty-eight samples (81%) presented more than one virus and in one sample seven RNA viruses were identified: KobuV, RVC, AstV 3, 4 and 5, SAV and PEDV. Rotavirus (either RVA, RVB or RVC) plus KobuV was the combination present in 12 out of the 14 (86%) samples infected with 2 viruses. RVA, RVB, RVC or a combination of two or three Rotavirus were also present in 41 out of the 47 (87%) diarrhoeic samples analysed. For the 6 Rotavirus-negative samples KobuV was present in all 6; being the single virus present in 4 of them. In the other two samples Astrovirus 3, 4, and 5, SAV, PasiV, PosaV and EntVG were detected (Additional file 1). The NGS approach used allowed the comparison of the relative frequencies of each viral species in the examined samples. Thus, when the number of reads for a given virus was compared to the total number of reads attributable to a mammalian RNA virus in the sample, it was evident that Rotaviruses, particularly RVA and RVB, clearly outnumbered any other virus that could be present (Fig. 1 ). In only nine cases, KobuV or SAV reads were predominant among viral reads (8 and 1 cases, Fig. 1 The box-and-whisker plots show, for the 47 samples from diarrhoeic animals, the distribution of the proportion of reads for a given mammalian viral species over the total number of mammalian viral reads (viral reads in a sample/total viral reads). Minimum, maximum, median, 25 respectively). In all 47 cases, one virus represented at least 45% of the total viral reads. Interestingly, when mixed rotavirus infections were detected (RVA-RVC or RVB-RVC), the proportion of one virus clearly predominated against the other. When coupled with the viral load, the relative frequencies per virus (Fig. 2) showed that for a majority of cases (40/47, 85 .1%), the predominant virus in the sample represented read proportions higher than 0.5 and viral reads figures larger than 10E3. Nearly all of them (36/40, 90 .0%) corresponded to Rotaviruseither RVA (21), RVB (6) or RVC (9) -, with KobuV and SAV being much less frequent (3 and 1 cases, respectively). Besides, few cases (4 KobuV and 1 RVA) represented simultaneously high proportions with viral reads below 10E3. In the four non-diarrhoeic samples, the number of viral reads obtained and indexed was lower compared to those of the diarrhoeic samples, none of the mammalian virus detected surpasses 10E0 to 10E1 reads (Additional file 1). In contrast, a large number of reads were indexed against RNA viruses of plants (i.e. Fabavirus, Bromovirus, Fijivirus, Luteovirus) and fungi (i.e. Hypovirus, Alphapartivirus). The filtering results included both whole genome (complete) and partial (less than 90% of the genome covered) sequences of the virus listed above (Additional file 1). Despite KobuV was more commonly reported than RVA, the number of full-length genome sequences obtained was higher in RVA (n = 23) than in KobuV (n = 17). The full-length sequences obtained -17 KobuV, 23 RVA, 11 RVC, 8 RVB, 4 SAV and 2 AstV3were deposited in GenBank with the Accession Numbers MH238075 to MH238338, MK936372 to MK936426, MK953017 to MK953236, and MK962320 to MK962342. Considering the segmented nature of the Rotavirus genome, every segment for every genome was uploaded separately. For the remaining RNA viruses, every complete genome was uploaded in a single file. Regarding the phylogenetic analysis of KobuV (Fig. 3 ), all Spanish sequences formed a monophyletic cluster where a Hungarian sequence was also included. The average nucleotide identity among Spanish isolates was 90.0%. It is worth noting that the depth of the terminal branches in the phylogenetic tree was very high compared to the inner branches, indicating a low number of shared mutations. The genotyping of the 23 RVA genomes obtained indicated that the most common combination was G9P [22] (12 cases; 52%), with G4P [22] (3 cases; 13%) and G3P [7] (2 cases; 9%) being much less frequent. The genotypes G3P [13] , G3P [19] , G4P [7] , G5P [13] , G5P [22] and G4P [6] were reported only once (Fig. 4) . The nucleotide identities reported for the RVA segments compared to the existing GenBank sequences ranged between 89 and 98%. In contrast, for the 8 RVB complete genomes characterized in this work (Fig. 5) , the overall nucleotide identities (among the 11 segments of the RVB genome) with the closest GenBank sequences ranged from between 74 and 90%. In fact, according to the proposed nucleotide cut-off values for For RVC (Fig. 6) , the nucleotide identities with the sequences available in GenBank ranged between 83 and 91%. The most common genotype was G6P [5] (8 samples), while the remaining 3 genomes would present two new RVC VP7 genotypes in combination with P [4]one with GX1P [4] and one with GX2P [4] and one GX2P [5] . For other viruses, nucleotide identities with the closest sequences deposited were low: AstV3 (91%), AstV4 (89%), SAV (87%), EntVG (82%) and PasiV (86%) except for PosaV (96%), AstV5 (97%) and PEDV (99%) which were very similar to other European sequences reported. Figures 7 and 8 show the phylogenetic trees for SAV and AstV3, respectively. The de novo assembler and virus detection analyses performed did not detect contigs that could be related to the presence of an unknown RNA virus, as all of them where positively indexed against the Reference RNA sequences dataset and/or the RefSeq Genome Database available at the BLAST resource of the NCBI website.
