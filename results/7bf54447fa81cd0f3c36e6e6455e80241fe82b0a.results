Characteristics of the children, nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization and viral detection rates are shown in Table 1 . Bacterial colonization rates in the present study were similar to results of the main trial [11] [12] [13] . Respiratory viruses were detected in almost 70% of samples, with 29% of samples showing evidence of multiple viruses. Human rhinoviruses were detected most frequently, ranging from 31% to 50% of samples ( Table 1) . Results of univariate analyses are shown in detail in the supporting information ( Figures S1 and S2 ). To summarize, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were positively associated with each other (Figure S1A-C), whereas each of them was negatively associated with S. aureus ( Figure S1D ). Day care attendance and presence of siblings in the household were associated with an increased risk of colonization with all bacteria except S. aureus ( Figure S1 ). Recent use of antibiotics was associated with a significant decreased risk of pneumococcal colonization as was PCV-7 vaccination, which corresponds to previously described results [11] . In general, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. catarrhalis were more likely to be present in the nasopharynx in combination with (multiple) respiratory viruses ( Figure S2A -C). In multivariate analyses, we observed persistent positive associations between S. pneumoniae colonization and the presence of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, the presence of siblings, day care attendance, human rhinoviruses, and enteroviruses ( Table 2 ). S. aureus carriage, recent antibiotic use, and PCV-7 vaccination remained inversely related with pneumococcal colonization in multivariate analysis. We found no major differences between the risk of co-occurrence of the most prevalent respiratory viruses with pneumococcal vaccine or non-vaccine serotypes. Likewise, we found no differences upon stratification of the analyses for vaccination status. H. influenzae colonization was positively associated with the presence of S. pneumoniae, human rhinoviruses and respiratory syncytial viruses, the presence of siblings, and day care attendance. M. catarrhalis colonization remained positively correlated with the presence of S. pneumoniae, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and the presence of siblings. A negative association was found between M. catarrhalis and S. aureus, with an adjusted odds ratio being even more profound than that between S. aureus and S. pneumoniae colonization (0.42 vs 0.56, respectively). The positive association between the presence of S. aureus and the pooled group of influenza viruses persisted in the multivariate model ( Table 2) . Multivariate models for independent associations with the most frequently detected viruses are shown in Table 3 . Human rhinoviruses were positively associated with the presence of siblings as well as with enteroviruses, and negatively associated with coronaviruses. In addition, enteroviruses were positively associated with the presence of human bocavirus, WU polyomavirus, parainfluenza viruses and human parechovirus. Human bocavirus was also associated with day care attendance and the presence of WU polyomavirus ( Table 2 ). Figure 1 graphically summarizes the results of partial correlation network analysis. All significant associations shown by multivariate analysis persisted in partial correlation network analysis ( Figure 1A ). When simultaneously adjusting for driving risk factors ( Figure 1B ) all correlations remain, except for those between H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis (P = 0.17), and between M. catarrhalis and coronaviruses (P = 0.064).
