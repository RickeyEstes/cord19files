In this report, we describe a case of pneumonia and severe wheezing associated with HBoV DNA in the pharyngeal swab sample from a child. Informed consent was obtained from the parents of the child who provided specimens. The child had been hospitalized at the age of 1 year due to rhinitis, airflow obstruction and acute wheezing. He was treated with corticosteroids and inhalative bronchodilatators to control bronchocostriction. No antibiotics were administered. No causative agent was found in nasopharyngeal swab or serological tests and no sign of chronic lung disease was present when he was released. During the following year, he frequently suffered from respiratory tract infections associated with bronchoconstriction. In order to understand the cause of bronchoconstriction, total and specific IgE were measured and high values were reported for egg proteins. He was 3 years old when admitted for the most recent episode of respiratory distress. Clinical examination revealed a weakened general condition, a body temperature of 38 • C, tachycardia (pulse rate 140 per min), tachypnea (respiratory rate 52 per min), dyspnea, subcostal retractions, wheezing and left apical fine rales upon lung auscultation. Laboratory tests showed a leukocyte count of 22.0 × 10 9 l −1 , and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Chest radiography, interpreted by a paediatric radiologist, revealed hyperinflation and pneumonic infiltrates of the upper left lobe. Transcutaneously measured oxygen saturation was decreased to 82% while breathing ambient air and the patient required oxygen supplementation (8 l/min) and inhalative adrenaline. Oxygen was given for an additional 3 days along with intravenous corticosteroids and salbutamol by inhalation for persistent bronchoconstriction. The child improved and was dismissed from hospital after 7 days. To assess the aetiology of this respiratory disease, blood and nasopharyngeal swab were drawn from the patient upon admission and tested for the presence of viral, bacterial and fungal pathogens. No infectious agent was detected by bacterial or fungal culture. The nasopharyngeal swab was also tested by PCR for Chamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and Legionella pneumophila, respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B), metapneumovirus, influenza viruses (types A-C), parainfluenza viruses (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3 and PIV-4), rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus (HcoV-OC43, HcoV-229E, NL63 and HKU11) and human bocavirus. The only positive result was obtained for HBoV, using the primers described by Simon et al. (2007) . Briefly, 5 l of DNA (extracted from 200 l of sample by using QIAamp mini kit; QIAGEN, Milan, Italy) was amplified using the forward primer 5 CCCAAGAAACGTCGTCTAAC 3 (HBoV nt 2301-2320) and the reverse primer 5 GTGTTGACT-GAATACAGTGT 3 (HBoV nt 2681-2700), producing a fragment of 399 bp, partly overlapping the NP1 gene. The cycling conditions were: an initial step at 94 • C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 94 • C for 40 s, 48 • C for 40 s and 72 • C for 1 min; and a final incubation at 72 • C for 5 min. The sensitivity of this PCR was very high, detecting up to 10 copies of HBoV genome (Fig. 1) . Virus detection was confirmed by sequence analysis of the PCR product. Another specimen drawn from the child one month after he was discharged from the hospital was negative for HBoV by PCR.
