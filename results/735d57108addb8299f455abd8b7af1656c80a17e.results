As shown in Table 1 , the raw values of risk perceptions and one of the protective behaviors were around the midpoint of a 5-point scale in all 25 waves (risk perception: Ms = 1.75 to 2.04, SDs = 0.81 to 0.93 and discussing with healthcare practitioners: Ms = 2.16 to 3.02, SDs = 1.41 to 1.74). The correlation analysis suggested no significant association between risk perceptions and protective behaviors, r = .41, p = .0997, indicating that these two responses to the media were relatively independent (Fishbein et al., 1995) . The results suggested that separate Granger causality tests with risk perceptions and protective behaviors as an outcome variable were appropriate. Post-hoc correlation analyses showed only continuous positive weak correlation coefficients between risk perception and protective behaviors from wave 13 to 25, rs = .06 to .17, ps â‰¤ .05.
