3.1. ps20 À/À mice have high circulating levels of neutrophils At the outset we undertook to characterize the abundance and relative proportions of immune cell populations in the peripheral blood (PB) of ps20 +/+ and ps20 À/À mice. In contrast to ps20 +/+ mice, we observe a significant increase in the number of GR1 + neutrophils circulating in the PB of ps20 À/À mice (ps20 +/+ = 21%; ps20 À/ À = 32%) (Fig. 1A, B) . Analysis of other PB leukocyte populations, including F4/80 + macrophages, CD3 + CD4 + and CD3 + CD8 + T cells, B220 + B cells and NK1.1 NK cells, revealed no statistically significant differences between ps20 +/+ and ps20 À/À mice (Fig. 1B) . Next, we examined the spleen, LN and BM compartments in the ps20 À/À and ps20 +/+ mice, aged 6-8 weeks. Spleen, LNs, and BM were processed as described in Section 2.3. The proportion of cells isolated from each of the compartments examined was indistinguishable between ps20 +/+ and ps20 À/À mice ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). In contrast to what we observe in the PB, we did not detect any differences in the percentage of leukocyte/lymphocyte populations between ps20 +/+ and ps20 À/À mice for spleen, LN or BM (Fig. 1C-E) . Similarly, our analysis of the structural architecture and cellularity in the LN and the spleen did not reveal any differences in tissue morphology between the ps20 +/+ and ps20 À/À mice ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ).
