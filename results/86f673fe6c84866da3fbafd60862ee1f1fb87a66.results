One hundred and sixteen adults fulfilled the entry criteria for the study. All patients gave their consent and were entered into the study. Of these, 21 (18%) were found to be HIV-seronegative, three (3%) had equivocal HIV serology and 17 (15%) either had inadequate clinical information recorded or inadequate samples collected to enable any useful analysis to be performed; all were excluded. Results are presented for the remaining 75 patients.
