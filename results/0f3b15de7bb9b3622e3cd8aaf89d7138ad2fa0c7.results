In the present study, out of the examined 220 diarrheic calves, 193 E. coli isolates were identified, 20 of them were ETEC K99 (10.36%), (Table 2; Fig. 1 ). Salmonella spp. were identified using PCR in nine cases (4.09); six isolates were S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and two isolates were S. enterica serovar Enteritidis whereas one isolate was not typed (Table 2 and Figs. 2 and 3). Three cases were confirmed to have mixed infection with ETEC K99 and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. After the construction of a multivariable model, Hosmer and Lemeshow's goodness of fit test statistic revealed that the model adequately fit the data for the risk factors associated with E. coli (v2 = 7.911; P = 0.261) and Salmonella spp. (v2 = 4.521; P = 0.17) infection. Age, vaccination of dams with combined vaccine against rotavirus, coronavirus and ETEC K99 (Scour Guard 3), colostrum feeding practice, rotavirus infection, and administration of vitamin E/selenium to pregnant dams were found to be significantly associated with ETEC K99 infection in diarrheic calves (Table 3) . Animal age was found to affect significantly the prevalence (P < 0.01; OR: 1.812; CI 95%: 0.566-1.769). Thus, 100% of the cases were found to be at the first week of age. Vaccination of dams with Scour Guard 3 (Pfizer, Egypt) significantly reduce the infection rate with ETEC K99 (P < 0.001; OR: 4.753; CI 95%: 2.124-10.641). Thus, 14 out of 20 infected calves were born from non-vaccinated dams. The prevalence of ETEC K99 was also found to be significantly affected by the hand feeding of colostrums (P < 0.01; OR: 5.525; CI 95%: 2.025-15.076); 16 infected calves were fed manually, whereas 4 cases only were naturally fed. Infection with rotavirus recorded significant association with infection by ETEC K99 (P < 0.001; OR: 2.220; CI 95%: 0.273-1.251). Thus, 13 infected calves with ETEC K99 were also found to be infected by rotavirus. Vitamin E and selenium supplementation of pregnant dams significantly affected the prevalence of ETEC K99 (P < 0.01; OR: 3.933; CI 95%: 0.703-1.248). 16 of infected calves were found to born from dams those did not receive combination of vitamin and selenium injection. On the contrary, Mastitis, season, Cryptosporidium spp. infection, hygiene, herd size, parity, and coronavirus infection showed no significant effect on the prevalence of ETEC K99 infection. Infection with Salmonella spp. was found to be significantly affected by the animal age (P < 0.05; OR: 0.376; CI 95%: 0.511-1.369) (Table 4 ). Thus, seven cases were found at the fourth week of age, whereas two cases were at the first week. Significant association was also found between the hygiene and infection with Salmonella (P < 0.05; OR: 0.628; CI 95%: 1.729-5.612); six calves infected with Salmonella spp. were found to be raised in unhygienic places. Also, the region of the farm was found to affect significantly on the prevalence of infection with Salmonella spp. (P < 0. 01; OR: 0.970; CI 95%: 0.841-1.624). Thus, seven cases were isolated from farms in governorates lie in Delta of Nile River (Kafr El-Sheikh, Dakahlia and Damietta) versus two cases in farms lie in semi arid area of Behera governorate. On the other hand, including mastitis, season, herd size, E. coli, Cryptosporidium spp. infection, parity, rotavirus infection, and coronavirus infection significantly did not affect the Salmonella spp. infection in the present investigation.
