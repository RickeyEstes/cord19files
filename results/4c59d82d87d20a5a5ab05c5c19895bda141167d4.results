On December 10 2009, the seven sperm whales were found stranded alive in shallow waters, parallel to the shore or beached, spread over a distance of 3,8 km on the Northern side of the Gargano Promontory (Fig. 1) . The meteorological and the logistic conditions at the stranding site did not allow any refloating effort, so that the three animals died within 48 hours.
