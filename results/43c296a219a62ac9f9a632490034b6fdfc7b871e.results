Our study included 18 patients with CF and 13 healthy controls with a median age of 20.5 and 25.0 years, respectively (NS) ( Table 1 ). As consequence of our inclusion criteria, sweat chloride values distinguish patients with CF from healthy controls (p < 0.001). Although the mean sweat chloride differed between CF-PS and CF-PI patients (p = 0.003), an individual overlap occurs (Table 1, Figure 1 ). The mean NPD CFTR response significantly discriminated between CF patients and healthy controls (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS versus PI (Table 1 ). Four healthy controls had an average Δ0Cl − + Iso of > −7.7 mV. Three out of four controls had a repeatable average NPD CFTR response in the CF-range for Δ0Cl − + Iso > −7.7 mV (23% of all healthy controls) (Figure 1 ), and two additional controls when using the Wilschanski score (15% of all healthy controls) (Figure 2 ). All these healthy controls were smokers. CFTR genotyping was offered to these three healthy controls as part of clinical routine and none had two CF-causing mutations (Table 1) . For ICM a median of 6 (5-7) rectal biopsies were sampled per patient without severe adverse events. The mean ICM CFTR response was significantly different between CF patients and healthy controls (p <0.001), but not between patients with CF who were PS versus those who were PI (Table 1) . We could not detect any age-dependency of the response to Isoproterenol/Forskolin. In contrast to NPD, there was no overlap between CF-patients and controls (Figures 3  and 4 ). Using the best instead of the average NPD, the CFTR response overlap did not change (Additional file 1). Using the best instead of the average ICM, the CFTR response resulted in one overlap (Additional file 2). In healthy controls, smoking had no influence on sweat chloride (NS), but decreased CFTR function as measured by NPD (p = 0.049) ( Table 2 and Figure 5 ), Figure 3 Correlation between the average ΔIsc (forskolin/IBMX + carbachol + histamine) (ICM) and average Δ0Cl − + Iso (NPD). The normal range is shown left of the dotted line. The intermediate range is shown between the solid and dotted lines. A higher ΔIsc (forskolin/ IBMX + carbachol + histamine) represents a better CFTR response. and resulted in intermediate or even abnormal NPD results, but not ICM or sweat chloride results. There is a trend in ICM measurements indicative that smoking might not only affect CFTR in the respiratory tract, but also in the intestine (Table 2 and Figure 6 ).
