Five hundred and seven patients with severe influenza were admitted to ICUs at one of the 33 U.S. hospitals participating in the SHIC study in 2013-2014. In this cohort influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 caused 311 (61.3%) infections, and influenza A virus that were not subtyped caused 170 (33.5%) additional infections. Other influenza strains caused 5.2% of infections (Table 1) . There were 444 adult and 63 pediatric subjects. Baseline characteristics are displayed in Table 1 . Bacterial co-infection was present in 114 (22.5%) subjects, comprising 23.2% of adult and 17.5% of pediatric subjects. Sixty two (12.2%) subjects developed community-acquired bacterial co-infection and 52 (10.3%) subjects developed hospital-acquired bacterial co-infection. Of the patients who developed community-acquired and hospital-acquired bacterial co-infections, 15/62 (24.2%) and 14/52 (26.9%), respectively, had no significant comorbid conditions. There were 129 total bacterial isolates cultured from the 507 patients in our cohort ( S. aureus was the most prevalent species among both community-(43.7%) and hospital-acquired (27.6%) pathogens (Table 3 and Fig. 2 ). The prevalence of S. aureus was lower among hospital-acquired co-infections as compared with communityacquired co-infections. In contrast, the prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas sp. was higher among hospital-acquired bacterial co-infections (19.0% and 19.0%, respectively) as compared to community-acquired bacterial co-infections (12.7% and 9.9%, respectively). S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and S. pyogenes were not isolated among hospital-acquired pathogens but were present among community-acquired co-infections (9.9%, 4.2%, and 2.8%), respectively. Patient characteristics associated with development of bacterial co-infection among adults (>17 years of age) in bivariable analyses are shown in Table 4 . The number of children in our cohort who developed a bacterial co-infection was too small to assess for risk factors for co-infection. Of the patients co-infected with a bacterial pathogen, 34 (29.8%) died, and of the patients not co-infected with a bacterial pathogen, 63 (16.0%) died. Bacterial co-infected patients were significantly more likely to die (OR 2.2 [1.4-3.6], p = 0.001) than patients not coinfected with a bacterial pathogen in univariable analysis. When controlling for disease severity by the SOFA score, patients coinfected were still more likely to die (OR 1.8 [1.1-3.1], p = 0.024).
