A viral etiology could be determined in 486 of the 817 (59.5%) patients. Multiple viral infections were detected in 113 (13.8%) patients (94 with two pathogens, 18 with three pathogens, and one with four pathogens) ( Table 3 ). Among 486 virus-positive cases, 346 (71.2%) were diagnosed by clinicians as bronchitis, 135 (27.8%) as pneumonia, and 5 (1.0%) were diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infection. Overall, 618 viral pathogens were detected: RSV was the most frequent pathogen (n = 120, 19.4%). The second to the fifth most frequent pathogens were HBoV (n = 119, 19.3%); IV (IAV and IBV) (n = 108, 17.5%); PIV1, 3 or 4 (n = 77, 12.5%), and HRV (n = 73, 11.8%). HMPV (n = 44, 7.1%), ADV (n = 43, 7.0%), HCoV-OC43, 229E, NL63 or HKU1 (n = 24, 3.9%). HEV (n = 11, 1.8%) were also detected occasionally. Among the 113 patients diagnosed with a multiple viral infection, the most frequent pathogens were HBoV, RSV, HRV and ADV (data not shown).
