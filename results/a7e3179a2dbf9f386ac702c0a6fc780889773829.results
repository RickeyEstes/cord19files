Lithium chloride promoted host resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis: To determine the potential role of LiCl in PA keratitis, B6 mice were subconjunctivally injected with LiCl and NaCl (an appropriate control). Clinical score data showed that the LiCl-treated B6 mice exhibited less disease severity at 1, 3, and 5 days p.i. (Figure 1A , p<0.05, p<0.05, and p<0.05, respectively). Representative photographs of the LiCl-treated B6 corneas ( Figure 1C) show less opacity than the NaCl-treated corneas ( Figure 1B ) at 5 days p.i. We also enucleated the infected eyes at 5 days p.i. from LiCl-versus NaCl-treated B6 mice for histopathology. H&E staining data indicated that LiCl-treated B6 corneas ( Figure 1E ) were much thinner and less swollen, with fewer infiltrated inflammatory cells in the stroma and anterior chamber, in contrast to the NaCl-treated corneas ( Figure 1D ). Bacterial plate counts were used to detect viable bacteria in the infected cornea of the LiCl-versus NaCl-treated mice at 1 and 5 days p.i. The results showed that LiCl treatment decreased the bacterial load at 5 days p.i. (Figure 1F , p<0.01), while no change was shown between the two groups at 1 day p.i. The efficacy of in vivo use of LiCl was confirmed with western blot ( Figure  1G ). The results showed that subconjunctival injection of LiCl dramatically upregulated the protein levels of P-GSK3β and β-catenin, indicating the efficacy of LiCl. These results together demonstrated that LiCl promoted host resistance to PA corneal infection.
