Quality assessment of the isolated RNA was made by agarose gel electrophoresis exhibiting non-fragmented RNA with sufficient quantity for reverse transcription and subsequent processing. After RT-PCR procedures, samples were processed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the amplicons of the chemokines were measured and adjusted to the relative G3PDH signal strength, comparative anal-ysis was initiated. All data followed normal distribution and are displayed as mean Â± SD in the following. Four cohorts were examined: patients with tonsillar hyperplasia (n = 21), adenoids (n = 25), chronic tonsillitis (n = 16) and chronic tonsillitis with histological proof of acute inflammation (further in the text referred to as "acute tonsillitis") (n = 27).
