During the period of the study, viruses were detected by electron microscopy-in the stools of 592 patients with gastroenteritis. 39 (6-6%) cases were associated with calicivirus excretion. (A separate report on other features of this study is being prepared.) Questionnaires were completed for 28 (72%) of the patients with calicivirus. The data presented are based on these responses except in respect of age and sex of patient and month of infection, which are based on 39 cases. OUTBREAK STRAINS OF CALICIVIRUS was reported in a third of the cases.9 Failure to thrive and malabsorption was reported in only 3 cases. 5 children had fever. The duration of symptoms ranged from two to eleven days with most illnesses lasting about four days. 13 (46%) of the affected children had siblings and, of these, 5 had at least 1 sibling with similar symptoms of illness. In 1 case the brother attended a school where there was a concurrent outbreak of diarrhoea and vomiting. The duration of excretion of viruses is shown in table I; the finding that the chances of detecting virus diminishes after the fourth day emphasises the need to obtain specimens during the symptomatic phase of illness."5 Serology (immune electron microscopy [IEM] .-Four strains of virus found in sporadic infections were tested against sera from three reported outbreaks2,4,6 (table II). There is little evidence of serological relations between the sporadic strains and strains associated with two of the outbreaks, but there is some evidence for a relation with the third.2 DISCUSSION Viruses morphologically identical with caliciviruses have recently been detected in animals',8 and people9-1 with gastroenteritis. The study of outbreaks in man in the U.K.,2,4,12 Japan,6 and Canadal3 has provided evidence that these viruses can cause diarrhoea and vomiting in all agegroups other than neonates. The apparent absence of cases in neonates may be due to predominantly asymptomatic infection or be associated with immunity due to maternal antibody. In the series of sporadic cases reported here, diarrhoea was the most frequent symptom, whereas, in children aged four to six years, vomiting was more common.2 It has been suggested5 that these differences in symptoms may be agerelated. However, since vomiting has been reported as the commonest feature in infected infants aged nine days to two years, age does not appear to be the sole determinant. 13 Other clinical features, such as fever and upper respiratory tract infection, have been reported infrequently. Thus the clinical features of calicivirus gastroenteritis are not distinguishable from those due to rotavirus infection. Several cases of calicivirus infection associated with failure to thrive have led us to consider the possibility of an aetiological relation. However, the results of this small survey do not provide much support for this view. Diarrhoea developed ten or more days after admission to hospital in 3 out of 26 infants, indicating that caliciviruses, like rotaviruses, can be a cause of nosocomial infection. Little is known about the range of human calicivirus serotypes. Results from this and a previous study4 provide evidence for at least three distinct serotypes which have been associated with outbreaks. The limited data obtained on the sporadic cases from North West London suggest that they may be associated with strains from one of these outbreaks.2 Whether strain differences, as reflected by IEM serology, have any implications for susceptibility to repeated infection with calicivirus or are, in any way, related to geographical distribution, remains to be established. Caliciviruses have been identified as a cause of gastroenteritis only in countries where electron microscopy facilities are readily available. Surveys of viral gastroenteritis in these areas indicate that calicivirus accounts for a proportion of gastroenteritis cases (Japan 2%,'&deg; Scandinavia 5%,' and U.K [present study] 6' 6%). Caliciviruses OPPORTUNITIES for specialist physicians wishing to work in tropical developing countries have diminished in recent years. It is still possible to obtain a post in Papua New Guinea, although the positions available now will be filled within the next few years by local graduates. Surprisingly little is known in Europe about the country,* and it is difficult to obtain accurate information about existing work. The work of junior medical officers in Papua New Guinea has, however, been the topic of several recent articles. 1,2
