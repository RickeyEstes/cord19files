In vitro addition of DEC resulted in detection of antibody to FOCMA (I : 10' dilution) in five of five serum samples from FeLV-infected cats, whereas all five samples tested negative (< 1: 10 dilution) without DEC. Antibody to FOCMA was not detected in serum samples from FeLV-naive cats, with or without addition of DEC to the serum diluent. The addition of DEC to the serum diluent did not alter the HIV-I serologic profiles or background upon testing serum samples of seven AIDS patients by Western blot. However, the gp 160 bands on the Western blot strips yielded by four of the seven samples were slightly more intense with the addition of DEC. Some of the results regarding the addition of DEC to serum diluent during testing of antibody to HIV by EIA appear in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Samples from 65 persons testing positive for antibody to HIV by RIP-SDS/PAGE all tested positive by ETA with or persons and seven from patients with AIDS-related disease) yielded absorbance values > 2 (the upper limit of positivity recorded by the Quantum II Analyzer) with and without addition of DEC to the serum diluent, and were omitted from these statistical analyses. The remaining 43 samples consisted of 25 samples from asymptomatic persons and 18 samples from patients with AIDSrelated diseases. The "DEC difference" for a given sample is the number obtained by subtracting the absorbance value yielded by a sample without DEC from the absorbance value generated by the same sample with DEC. The DEC differences were positive for 12 of the 25 asymptomatic cases, and negative for the remainder. The null hypothesis, that the median of the distribution of the DEC differences = 0, was tested against the alternative hypothesis that the median was > 0 by means of a one-tailed sign test (using the normal approximation with continuity correction and level of significance of 0.05). The null hypothesis was not rejected. The DEC differences were positive for 16 of the i8 AIDS-related patients, and negative for the remainder; the corresponding sign test for this group (using the binomial distribution) rejected the null hypothesis (P < 0.0007). These 43 serum samples included 25 patients who tested positive for antibody to HIV-1 PUV glycoproteins but negative for antibody to gug gene-encoded p24 by RIP-SDS PAGE. The DEC differences were positive for 18 of the 25 patients, and negative for the remainder; the corresponding sign test for this group rejected the null hypothesis (P ~0.03). The DEC differences were positive for six of the 18 remaining samples that tested positive for both antibody to HIV-l gag and err\! proteins; the null hypothesis was not rejected. Also included among these 43 serum samples were 14 samples from patients with > 500 T-helper/inducer lymphocytes per mm' blood. The DEC differences were positive for 11 of the 14 samples; the corresponding sign test for this group using the binomial distribution rejected the null hypothesis (P < 0.03). The remaining 29 patients had > 500 T-helper/inducer lymphocytes per mm' blood; the DEC differences were positive for I3 of the 29 samples and negative for the remainder; the null hypothesis was not rejected. Among 75 persons testing negative for antibody to HIV by RIP~SDSPAGE. I7 tested positive by EIA without DEC and 15 tested positive with DEC. The DEC differences were positive for 37 of the 75 and negative for the remainder; a one-tailed sign test of the null hypothesis that the median was = 0 did not reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level of significance.
