All years for the review were represented, except for 1985, 1990, and 1991 as there were no publications that were sourced for these three years. There were a total of 8 resources in 1995 (4%) and 43 in 2009 (21.5%). The year 1998 began a continuous presence of one health resources annually. The year 2006 began a continued increase in one health resources for the period of review. The years 2010 to 2012 were the most productive for publications on one health as 71% of publications occurred during this period of time. An overall increase in the number of published one health scholarly works was found for the review with a marked increase in the most recent years ( Figure 1 ). Journal articles, presentations, WHO reports, and books or book chapters were included in the analysis. Grants and funding allocations were not represented in the data gathering process. Of the resulting resources, peer-reviewed journal articles took precedence (85%) of all publications, while presentations and books accounted for 8.0% and 6.5%, respectively; only one WHO report was recorded. Evaluation of scopes, covered in the 737 scholarly resources (Figure 2 ), revealed that the predominant topics were global health, with 247 scopes (33.5%), and environmental health, with 232 total scopes (31.5%). In terms of geographic distribution of the scholarly resources, most of the resources focused their objectives within or towards countries that were already developed (70%) (Figure 3 ). An assessment on how one health initiatives were distributed by country size and GDP was achieved by mapping and measuring the burden of zoonoses and its distribution across the world ( Table 1) . Events of zoonoses were found to be disproportionately distributed as a result of the poverty and emerging market interface. Outbreaks or epidemics of emerging zoonoses were also noted to be sporadic in temporal and spatial distribution and appeared in developed countries where emerging zoonoses had not previously been reported but are increasing in incidence or geographical range. Data on zoonoses extracted from the global burden of diseases noted that endemic zoonoses were concentrated among the developing countries of India, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, China, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh, whereas emerging zoonoses events were reported in the developed countries of the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, France, Brazil, Canada, Germany, and Japan (Table 1 ) [8] . For data analysis, chi-square was conducted to determine if, in the resulting reviewed years, one health resources themselves, scopes, and country locale differed significantly from the averages expected. Analysis revealed values of less than 0.05 ( < 0.05), meaning that the resources, scopes, and country locale were all statistically different ( Table 2) . Further analysis employed linear regression, using each focus, year, one health resource, scope, and country as the dependent variables and comparing them against independent variables of themselves. This showed whether the relationship between the independent and dependent variables was predictive or dependent on one another [9] . In the case of using year as the dependent variable, the regression shows that it was dependent on the initiative ( = 0.021), scope ( = 0.003) and the country locale ( = 0.021) ( Table 3) . Since all the values were < 0.05, the null hypothesis was rejected and it was concluded that the years selected for the study showed a dependent relationship on the one health approach conducted, the scope topic areas and the represented country in the scholarly work. The same linear regression was performed, this time using the initiative as a dependent variable against the other variables (Table 4) . For this analysis, the initiative showed it to be dependent on the year ( = 0.022), as also noted in Table 3 , but not dependant on scope ( = 0.643) nor on the country's locale ( = 0.465). The null hypothesis failed to be rejected because no complete dependency relationships were formed between all the variables from the regression test that was conducted, as compared to the regression testing done with year. Next, scope was selected as the dependent variable against the year, initiative, and country. The linear regression showed that the scope was dependent on the year, as seen before ( = 0.003), but not dependent on the initiative ( = 0.643) nor on the country ( = 0.481) ( Table 5 ). The null hypothesis thus failed to be rejected. The country locale was used as the dependent variable against the others in the last linear regression. It was demonstrated that the country, whether developed or developing, was dependent on the year ( = 0.021) but not on the initiative ( = 0.445) nor the scope ( = 0.481) ( Table 6) . Again, the null hypothesis failed to be rejected for the whole dependency of scope on all other variables. The only rejected null was the dependency displayed between the year of the initiative and the initiative itself, its scope, and the country covered from within the initiative.
