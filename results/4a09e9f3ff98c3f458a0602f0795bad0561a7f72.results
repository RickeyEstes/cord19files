3.1. Suckling pigs had more severe clinical signs, earlier fecal PEDV RNA shedding and higher serum PEDV RNA titers compared to weaned pigs The suckling pigs showed severe diarrhea and vomiting at PID 1, whereas the weaned pigs showed milder clinical signs starting only at PID 3 ( Table 1 ). The fecal consistency scores were significantly higher in suckling pigs compared to weaned pigs at all time points examined (P < 0.05) ( Table 1 ). The fecal shedding PEDV RNA titer was high in suckling pigs starting from PID 1, whereas the weaned pigs started shedding PEDV RNA at PID 3 and shed at significantly higher titers at PID 5 compared to the suckling pigs (P < 0.05) ( Table 1 ). The serum PEDV RNA titers were significantly higher in suckling pigs at all time-points sampled ( Table 1 ). The higher severity of disease in suckling pigs coincided with the higher serum PEDV RNA titers in suckling pigs compared to weaned pigs. The MEM only inoculated control pigs had no detectable PEDV RNA in either serum or feces.
