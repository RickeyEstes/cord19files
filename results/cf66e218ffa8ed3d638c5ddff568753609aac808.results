From 1994 to 2010, a total of 5999 Shigella isolates were collected from 372 inpatients and 5627 outpatients with diarrhea. All patients acquired diarrheal infection in the community, most likely through the ingestion of contaminated food and water. Cases for which the diarrheal infection was acquired through travel or via sexual contact were excluded from the analysis. Among the 5999 Shigella isolates, 12 were of an unknown subgroup (i.e., either not reported, not further typed, or untypeable); a final total of 5987 isolates were further analyzed in this study.
