The results showed that 12 flocks (48.00%) were positive for IBV (Fig. 1) . The nucleotide sequences of four isolates were submitted to the GenBank sequence database and were given the accession numbers IRIBVb: KP751243, IRIBVc: KP751244, IRIBVe: KP751245 and IRIBVf: KP751246. A phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2) , based on the hypervariable region of S1 gene sequences of four IBV isolates from the present study and other strains of IBV retrieved from GenBank, was generated. Based on the Phylogenetic analysis, these four isolates were clustered with QX-like viruses. The results demonstrated the occurrence of QX-like serotype/genotype in Ahvaz, Iran. The IBV isolates were closely correlated to PCRLab
