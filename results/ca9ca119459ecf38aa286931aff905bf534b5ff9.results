Altogether 78 subjects were admitted with the first episode of AECOPD with concomitant pneumonia. The demographic characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 . Lung function results were available for 64 patients. Twelve patients died before the scheduled appointment for spirometry whereas two refused to return for lung function assessment. Among the 64 subjects with lung function assessment, 5, 13, 23 and 23 patients had mild, moderate, severe, and very severe COPD according to the GOLD classification. 16 Forty-two patients (53.8%) were using ICS before hospitalization. The mean (SD) dose of ICS was 1345 (679) mcg beclomethasone-equivalent per day. There was no difference in the demographic characteristics (including the mean lung function value) between subjects who were on ICS and those who were not. In addition, by stratifying subjects on ICS into two subgroups of high (>1000 mcg beclomethasone-equivalent per day) and lowmedium ( 1000 mcg beclomethasone-equivalent per day) dose of ICS, no difference in their demographic data was observed (Supplementary Table 1 ). The mean (SD) dose of the group on high dose and low-medium dose ICS were 2050.0 (223.6) and 836.4 (283.8) mcg beclomethasoneequivalent per day, respectively. Among our subjects, 28 (35.8%), 11 (14.1%), 7 (9.0%), 5 (6.4%), 5 (6.4%), 7 (9.0%) had history of hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure and malignancy, respectively. All patients were managed on the general medical wards and none required invasive mechanical ventilation. There were no significant differences in mortality in the same admission, mortality at 12 months, and NPPV usage when comparing subjects on ICS against those who were not, or when comparing subjects who were on low-medium dose of ICS against those on high dose ICS (Supplementary Table 1 ). The clinical presentations of the subjects are summarized in Table 2 . In 10 episodes, subjects had taken antibiotics within 7 days before hospitalization. All subjects had pneumonic changes on CXRs. Among them, 7 episodes had bilateral CXR changes whereas 13 episodes had pneumonic changes involving more than 1 lobe of the lungs. Three subjects developed pleural effusion. All patients were treated with antibiotic therapy on admission after sputum and blood culture had been collected in the hospital. The sputum culture results are shown in Table 3 . Overall, 40.8% and 3.0% of the episodes had positive sputum bacterial and mycobacterial culture, respectively. Two out of the 8 patients (25.0%) related to Streptococcus pneumoniae were resistant to penicillin whereas none of the Haemophilus influenzae isolates showed beta-lactamase activity. None had more than one bacterium isolated from the sputum. There was no difference in the rate of positive sputum bacterial culture in the group that had received antibiotic in the previous week when compared to those who did not ( There was also no difference in the rates of positive influenza A or B viruses (using the combined method of NPA PCR, NPA viral culture and blood serology) among those subjects who had received influenza vaccination within 12 months before the admission compared to those without ( Among those with bilateral pneumonia (n Z 7), 3 had micro-organisms identified (1 H. influenzae and 2 influenza A). For those 13 cases with pneumonic changes involving more than 1 lobe (7 of them had bilateral pneumonia also), 4 had bacteria (2 H. influenzae, 1 S. pneumoniae and 1 Serratia sp.) and 3 had viruses identified (2 influenza A and 1 metapneumovirus). None of these subjects had both bacterial and viral etiologies identified at the same time. The identification of the organisms in relation to the lung function of the subjects is shown in Table 5 . There was a trend towards a higher rate of positive sputum bacterial culture among the subjects with FEV 1 < 50% predicted than those with FEV 1 ! 50% predicted (19/45[42.2%] vs 2/ 14[14.3%], p Z 0.04). However, the rate of positive sputum bacterial culture was not different among patients with FEV 1 < 30% predicted from those whose FEV 1 was !30% predicted (8/20[40.0%] vs 13/39[33.3%], p Z 0.61). Similarly, the rate of positive viral etiology was not statistically different between the COPD subjects with different disease severity based on their lung function. The hospital length of stay, need for NPPV support, death rates in the same admission and at 12 months, and re-admissions to hospital in 12 months were assessed in relation to the bacteriology and virology results ( Table 6) . Patients with a positive viral etiology had a higher chance of requiring NPPV support than those without viral identification by either NPA or serology (41.7% vs 11.5%, p Z 0.01). The age, sex, presence of co-morbid medical illness (such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure or malignancy) and admissions for pneumonia in the previous 12 months had no association with the presence of bacteria and viruses from the respiratory specimens. In addition, the presence of co-morbidities (as defined above) had no effect on the death rate and the length of hospital stay when compared to the subjects without co-existing medical illness.
