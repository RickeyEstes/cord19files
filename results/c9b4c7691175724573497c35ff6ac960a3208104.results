This survey was performed in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Imam Reza University Hospital of Kermanshah in the west of Iran. From 76 newborns with sepsis, 41 were males (53.9%) and 35 were females (46.1%); also, 43 had an early-onset sepsis (56.6%) and 33 had a late-onset sepsis (43.4%). Nine species of bacteria were isolated during the study, the number and frequency of each species being shown in Table 1 . The frequency of isolated gram-negative compared to the gram-positive bacteria was higher ( Table  2) . The most frequent isolated bacteria in both groups of patients with and without G6PD deficiency was Staphylococcus aureus. Blood cultures, in which coagulase-negative Staphylococci were not isolated for more than once or separated from the mixture of bacteria, were considered a contamination and excluded from the results. There was a statistically significant correlation between the prevalence of G6PD deficiency and sepsis in the neonates (p=0.03) ( Table 3 ) in this study. As Table 3 shows, the prevalence of G6PD deficiency compared in the two groups of female neonate patients and female neonate controls, were not statistically significant (p=0.39), but were statistically significant (p=0.03) in male neonates. The mean WBCs in the G6PD-deficient patients and the G6PD normal patients were 11.6 and 10.7 cells/ mcL respectively (p= 0.77); also, the mean neutrophil percentages in G6PDdeficient patients and G6PD normal patients were 54.86% and 53% respectively (p=0.86).
