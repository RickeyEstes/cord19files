3.1. Absolute counts of peripheral blood CD14 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , CD21 + cells early after CB/05 infection Acute lymphopenia has been described to occur after CB/05 infection. In order to determine if monocytes were also altered during the course of the infection, peripheral blood from ten dogs infected with CB/05 was subjected to flow cytometry analysis and absolute counts of CD14 + cells (i.e., monocytes) were measured 3 and 5 days p.i. As shown in Fig. 1A , CD14 + cells increased significantly by day 3 and augmented even further (although with a greater level of variability) by day 5 p.i. As expected, lymphocytes were significantly reduced by day 3 (average reduction 44%, range 11-60%) and remained at this level by day 5 p.i. (average reduction 45%, range 20-71%). The CD4 + and CD8 + T cell absolute counts were also quantified in the infected dogs and Fig. 1B shows that the CD4 + T cell population was significantly reduced by day 3 (average reduction 63%, range 52-73%) and remained low at day 5. A similar trend was observed for the CD8 + T cells; in particular, they dropped to approximately 50% of their initial counts on day 3 (range 12-61%) and remained low at day 5 p.i. (Fig. 1C ). The B lymphocytes (i.e., CD21 + ) showed a 36% reduction by day 3 p.i. (range 32-62%) followed by a rapid recovery by day 5 (Fig. 1D) . The three control dogs (not infected) did not show any significant difference in any cell population during the study period (data not shown). 3.2. Absolute counts of peripheral blood CD14 + , CD4 + , CD8 + , CD21 + cells at later time points after CB/05 infection To investigate the dynamics of both the lymphocyte depletion and the monocyte increment, dogs were monitored for a longer period of time and the absolute counts of CD4 + , CD8 + , CD21 + and CD14 + cells were measured until day 24 p.i. (four dogs) or until day 60 p.i. (two dogs). While the CD8 + subset returned to basal level at day 7 and did not undergo any further change (Fig. 2B) , the CD4 + subset remained significantly depleted until day 24 ( Fig. 2A ). In addition, the CD21 + B cell population which returned to basal level on day 5-7 did not change at later time points p.i. (Fig. 2C) . Finally, two dogs were studied until day 60 p.i. to monitor in particular the CD4 + and CD14 + cell populations (Fig. 2D) . The CD14 + monocytes and the CD4 + T cells returned to basal levels at day 14 p.i. and 60 days p.i., respectively.
