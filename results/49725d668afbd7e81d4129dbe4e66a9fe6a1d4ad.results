Our initial analysis was performed using as a query set, all proteins predicted to be encoded by all species and isolates in both the chordopoxvirus and entomopoxvirus subfamilies of the Poxviridae. This query set was used to probe three protein databases: all proteins encoded by eukaryotes, all proteins encoded by bacteria, and all virus-encoded proteins except those encoded by poxviruses. The results from the viral protein database were plotted against results from eukaryote proteins (Fig. 1A ) and against results from bacterial proteins (Fig. 1B) , and results from the eukaryote and bacterial protein databases were plotted against each other (Fig. 1C) . Overall, the resulting plots show that chordopoxvirus proteins tend to exhibit greater similarity to eukaryotic proteins than to bacterial or viral proteins, suggesting that many poxvirus proteins may share a common evolutionary origin with proteins of their eukaryotic hosts. The plots in Fig. 1 distinguish between chordopoxvirus and entomopoxvirus subsets of poxvirus proteins. Although entomopoxviruses share several of the host-like genes present in chordopoxviruses, entomopoxvirus proteins do not show the same general skew towards greater similarity with eukaryotic proteins in comparison to other viral proteins. This could be due to the relative shortage of insect sequences in GenBank or to a bias of entomopoxviruses towards trading genes with other insect viruses over acquiring them from hosts.
