A total of five cases of recrudescence were identified ( Figure 1 ): three occurred in Liberia and one each in Guinea and Sierra Leone (World Health Organization, 2016; Sheri, 2015; Farge and Giahyue, 2015; Dahl et al., 2016; Dakaractu, 2016; Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, 2016) . Two were male and three were female ( Table 1) . One of the three cases in Liberia was caused by inter-country migration, and therefore may be better stated as recurrence rather than recrudescence (World Health Organization, 2016; Dakaractu, 2016) . That case was associated with viral exposure at a funeral in Guinea (Dakaractu, 2016) . Sexual transmission involving survivors was suspected for three cases (World Health Organization, 2016; Sheri, 2015; Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, 2016) . Of these, one in Liberia was documented as linked to a survivor who had recovered 164 days before confirmation of the recrudescent case (Dahl et al., 2016) . Similarly, the recrudescent female case in Sierra Leone is believed to have been due to sexual transmission (World Health Organization, 2016; Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, 2016). In Guinea, three probable unconfirmed deaths considered as consistent with EVD were observed in advance of the confirmed recrudescence on March 17, 2016 (World Health Organization, 2016 Dahl et al., 2016; Dakaractu, 2016) . Virologically, the causative virus of the recrudescence event was demonstrated to be closely related to the virus isolated previously in the same country (Dahl et al., 2016; Dakaractu, 2016) . The route of transmission in a 15-year-old male in Liberia remains unknown, but intra-household transmission during the mother's pregnancy from the immunocompromised mother to the 15-year-old boy was suspected (World Health Organization, 2016; Farge and Giahyue, 2015) . The time interval from laboratory confirmation of the perceived last case to confirmation of the recrudescent case ranged from 101 to 140 days (Table 1 ). All observed intervals were longer than the mean serial interval; i.e., the time from illness onset in the primary case to that in the secondary case, estimated at 15.3 days (WHO Ebola Response Team, 2016) . From the latest date of either burial or second negative test result, it took 92-122 days to confirm the cases of recrudescenceall more than double the 42-day waiting period. Recrudescence events occurred 51-79 days after the declaration of the end of the outbreak. The time lags from declaration to recrudescence were all within the 90-day period of heightened surveillance. The three sexual transmission events involving survivors-the first two in Liberia and one in Sierra Leone-required 164 days, >150 days, and approximately 180 days, respectively, from discharge of survivors to confirmation of the recrudescent case.
