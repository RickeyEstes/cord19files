Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the knowledge and practice items, calculated on the pretest, were 0.723 and 0.897, respectively, demonstrating the reliability of the test items. Of the 29 students, 34.4 % were in their fourth year, 24.1 % in their fifth year, and 41.4 % in their sixth year. Demographics of the participants (age, sex and academic year) are presented in Table 2 . To assess the gain in knowledge from the course, the pre-test and post-test results were compared (Fig. 1) . The overall mean score was 41.0 % ± 6.29 SD on the pre-test and 67.7 % ± 7.70 SD on the post-test (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between the mean scores of males and females on the pre-test or on the post-test (Fig. 1) . Given that the students were from three different years of medical school, we wondered whether the one or two years' difference in medical school education might affect the scores. But comparison of the pre-test mean scores of students in the fourth, fifth and sixth years showed that there was no significant difference between them (39.2 % ± 6.20 SD, 43.4 % ± 7.80 SD and 41.0 % ± 5.44 SD, respectively; p = 0.317). Likewise, there was no significant difference between them on the post-test (data not shown). Finally, we looked at how the students evaluated the course ( Table 3 ). Most of them (76 %) found it interesting and stated that their personal goals were met by the program (72.4 %). On a Likert scale measuring satisfaction with various aspects of the course (Table 2) , the statement "Overall, the instructors were effective and responded to questions in an informative, appropriate and satisfactory manner" received the most positive answers (93.1 % agree or strongly agree). The statement receiving the least positive answers (58.6 %) was "The workshop was scheduled at a suitable time of year." Many students commented that the course was appropriate and relevant to their medical education. Some students complained about some technical difficulties during videoconferencing or suggested that more time should be given for the community education session. In response to open questions concerning improvement of the curriculum, 4 of 29 students (14 %) expressed interest in an additional week of simulation sessions. In conversation after the simulation sessions, all of them expressed strong interest in XVR and ISS. We also followed up the students by email and telephone one and a half years after the course to get some understanding of their attitudes and experience with disasters after the course. Only 18 students of the 29 (62 %) could be contacted. Half of them were working as interns or residents in the Jazan area, while the rest had transferred to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In December 2015, a fire broke out in the maternity ward at Jazan General Hospital, killing 25 and injuring 123, and though none of these 18 students were working at that hospital, they helped prepare their hospitals and participated in receiving the victims and discharging stable cases. They said that the course had changed their attitude and that they have become less stressed and more confident when faced by emergencies at their hospitals. Overall, they said they feel that they had benefited from the course and, for example, could distinguish what was being done improperly during drill evacuations at their hospital.
