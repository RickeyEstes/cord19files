Probable SARS patients were regarded as laboratory confirmed if they had at least one of the following: SARS-CoV IgG and/or IgM antibody detected by IFA three or more weeks after the onset of the illness, and/or SARS-CoV RNA detected by RT-PCR during the first two weeks of illness. In this study, 271/304 (89.1%) patients were laboratory confirmed as having SARS, including 148 (55%) with SARS-CoV detected by RT-PCR on respiratory tract or fecal samples. Of the 148 SARS-CoV RT-PCR positive samples, SARS-CoV IgG was detected in 145 (98%) and SARS-CoV IgM in 117 (79%) using IFA. 12 There were 33/304 (10.9%) that were negative on SARS testing. An alternative laboratory diagnosis was made in 27/33, of which the most common were acute influenza B (13 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae infection (nine cases). The mean age of the 271 laboratory-confirmed SARS cases was 36 AE 16 years, with 51 (18.8%) over 50 years of age and nine (3.3%) under 18 years. There were 157 (57.9%) females and 114 (42.1%) males. There were 92 (33.9%) health care workers, including 51 nurses, 30 physicians and 11 others in the cohort. Thirty-two patients had underlying health problems, including diabetes (18 cases), cardiac disease (eight cases), malignancy (four cases), chronic airways disease (one case) and chronic renal failure (one case). One hundred and twelve individuals (41.3%) acquired SARS in the hospital setting as health care workers, inpatients, or visitors, mostly in the wards of the hospital. A further 62 cases were infected following home exposure, when family members or friends of hospital-associated cases had come into close contact with affected individuals.
