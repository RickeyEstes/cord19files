Tranexamic acid was applied according to the protocol in 67 of 329 patients. TABLE 1 shows the characteristics of patients who did and did not receive tranexamic acid. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in mean age, sex, size and volume of hematoma, spot signs on hematomas, BP, medical history (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, stroke, alcohol), and drug use (antiplatelet or anticoagulant), except smoking status and CKD. Although there was no significant difference in the characteristics of the patients between the 2 groups, the use of tranexamic acid did not show a significant reduced incidence of hematoma expansion. Hematoma expansion was observed in 7 patients (10.4%) in the tranexamic acid group and 38 patients (14.5%) in the control group. We further analyzed risk factors involved in hematoma expansion. TABLE 2 compares the 2 groups who experienced hematoma expansion. There was a significant difference in the maximal diameter of the hematomas and the presence of spot sign between the 2 groups. Although there was no statistical significance, there seemed to be an association of initial hematoma volume, smoking, and need for pain control with a hematoma expansion. Therefore, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the risk factors of hematoma expansion including these variables. TABLE 3 shows the results. The maximal diameter of the hematoma and the presence of spot sign were found as significant risk factors for hematoma expansion. Hematoma volume and maximal diameter were 17.8±14.6 cm 3 , 38.6±12.2 mm in the hematoma expansion group and 31.9±14.6 mm, 12.8±15.1 cm 3 in the non-hematoma expansion group, respectively. Based on the ROC curve, the optimal cut points to achieve the maximal sensitivity and specificity of the maximal diameter and hematoma volume were 40.5 mm and 10.1 cm 3 , respectively. Of the 45 patients with hematoma expansion, 17 patients underwent conservative management, 17 patients received hematoma aspiration, and 11 patients received craniotomy and ICH removal.
