207 (30%) of the 700 children enrolled in the main cohort were diagnosed with recurrent troublesome lung symptoms during the fi rst 3 years of life; between Nov 17, 2010, and Jan 28, 2014, we randomly allocated 158 episodes for trial treatment (79 [50%] to azithromycin and 79 [50%] to placebo; fi gure 1) from 72 (35%) of these children. Before analyses, we excluded ten (6%) episodes from the analysis (fi ve [6%] in each group), nine (6%) because of missing diary information (azithromycin four [5%]; placebo fi ve [6%]) and one (1%; in azithromycin group) because the treatment was never given to the child. Mean age at randomisation was 2·0 years (SD 0·6). The mean number of randomisations for each child was 2·2 treatments (SD 1·5). In 121 (82%) of the 148 episodes analysed (62 [84%] in the azithromycin-treated episodes and 59 [80%] in the placebo-treated episodes), the child received concurrent treatment with inhaled corticosteroids. In 89 (60%) episodes, the child received concurrent treatment with montelukast (47 [64%] in the azithromycin-treated episodes and 42 [57%] in the placebo-treated episodes). Treatment was complied with in 154 (97%) of 158 episodes: one (1%) azithromycin treatment was never given and three (2%) treatments were discontinued after initiation; one (1%) in the azithromycin group and two (1%) in the placebo group. 71 (99%) of 72 children had complete clinical followup from inclusion in the study until age 3 years. Baseline characteristics did not diff er signifi cantly between participants in the trial and other children diagnosed with recurrent troublesome lung symptoms from the COPSAC 2010 cohort who did not participate in the ; table 1 ). The mean total duration of respiratory episodes was 13·7 days. The episode duration after randomisation was unrelated to sex, mother's smoking status, allergic sensitisation to inhalant or food allergens at 6 months or 18 months, atopic dermatitis, or 17q21 genetic risk variant (appendix). Figure 2 shows the proportion of symptomatic children day-by-day during the 30 days after treatment, showing a shortening of the symptomatic period after treatment with azithromycin. The average number of symptom days after azithromycin treatment was 3·4 days versus 7·7 days after placebo, corresponding to a calculated reduction in episode length of 63·3% (95% CI 56·0-69·3; p<0·0001) within a child due to azithromycin treatment (table 2) . Restriction of the analysis to the fi rst randomised treatment in each child substantiated a signifi cant reduction of symptom duration by 44·4% (30·9-55·2; p<0·0001) after treatment with azithromycin, corresponding to a mean duration of 4·0 days after azithromycin versus 7·1 days after placebo. The eff ect of azithromycin was increased when the duration of symptoms before treatment was shorter, showing a reduction in episode duration of 83% if treatment was initiated before day 6 of the episode compared with 36% if initiated on or after day 6 (p<0·0001). Figure 3 shows the reduction of episode duration after azithromycin treatment as a function of episode duration before treatment (less than or more than the median value of 6 days). We noted no diff erential eff ect for episodes presenting with fever of ≥38°C or with increased CRP concentration of ≥76·19 nmol/L (≥8 mg/L), and treatment was equally eff ective in episodes with and without objective wheeze during examination in the research clinic (table 2) . Presence of any pathogenic bacteria did not signifi cantly modify the treatment eff ect compared with episodes without detection of bacteria, but azithromycin was more eff ective in episodes positive for H infl uenzae (table 2). Presence of any virus did not modify the treatment eff ect of azithromycin. None of the detected viruses signifi cantly modifi ed treatment eff ects (table 2) . Concurrent treatment with inhaled steroids (p value for interaction=0·57) or montelukast (p value for interaction=0·69) did not signifi cantly modify the treatment eff ect, and responses were equal (appendix). We noted no diff erences between treatment groups during the 30 days after treatment with respect to serious or any adverse events, gastrointestinal symptoms, or other infections, as documented by daily diary cards and hospital records (appendix).
