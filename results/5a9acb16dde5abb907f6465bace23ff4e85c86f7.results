The mean numbers of patients attending the ED with a principal diagnosis of upper respiratory tract infection, or suicide attempt via drug overdose, were greater during the peak-epidemic stage than all other epidemic stages; however, these differences were not statistically significant (Table 2) . For the peak-versus pre-epidemic SARS stages, statistically significant decreases (p < 0.05) were noted in the mean numbers of patients attending the ED with the following principal diagnoses: cardiovascular disease, -12.6 (95% CI, -8.9, -16.4); inflammatory or functional bowel disease, -15.6 (95% CI, -9.9, -21.4); endocrine disease, -2.5 (95% CI, -1.9, -3.1); dizziness or vertigo, -4.5 (95% CI, -2.0, -7.9); and trauma, -26.0 (95% CI, -22.1, -30.6). Nevertheless, the total percent of patients in each diagnostic category who attended the ED did not change significantly across the various stages of the SARS epidemic (Table 2 ).
