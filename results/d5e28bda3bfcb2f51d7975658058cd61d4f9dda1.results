The recent epidemic emergence of this resistance mechanism in Klebsiella spp., E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Providencia rettgeri in geographically distant areas of India and the UK is a major cause for concern. This project was initiated to determine the genetic vehicle(s) responsible for the rapid emergence and dissemination of the blaNDM-1 MBL in enteric organisms. Methods: Species identification and antibiotic susceptibility profile of 67 blaNDM-1 harbouring enteric isolates collected from Chenai (south India) and Haryana (North India) was performed using the Phoenix machine. Isolates were typed by pulsed field Gel electrophoresis after Xba1 digestion. Plasmids were visualized by ethidium bromide staining following PFGE of S1 partially digested plugs. Plasmids carrying blaNDM-1 were further identified by probing of the same gels using a 32P labelled blaNDM-1 and A/C rep probes. Transconjugants were selected following matting with J53 on MacConkey plates containing azide and 0.5 mg/L meropenem. Plasmid analysis on A subset of transconjugants (20) was performed by replicant typing and S1 PFGE and subsequent probing. A/C plasmid analysis was further performed using a set of 12 primers designed to amplify sections of the backbone of A/C plasmids and DNA probing with A/C probes. Results: All isolates from the North of India were Klebsiella pneumoniae and carried A/C plasmids of size 50kb (9), 80âˆ’90kb (2), or 118kb (11). However, in the south of India isolates were of various enteric species and gave numerous different pulsed field gel restriction types. Furthermore plasmids found in the isolates from the south were of many different sizes ranging from 100kb to 375kb in size. Probing indicated that most plasmids carrying blaNDM-1 were of rep A/C type (19/20) only 1/20 tested were found to be carried on the F plasmid. Transconjugants were selected for all strains except the small plasmids from the North of India. Transconjugants gave plasmids of mostly the same size but examples were found of size changes following transconjugation including both increasing and decreasing size. PCR on transconjugants and parents indicated differences in the A/C plasmid backbone. Conclusions: blaNDM-1 emergence in enteric organisms in India is linked mostly to A/C plasmid types of varying sizes ranging from 50kb to 375kb.
