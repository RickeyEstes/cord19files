Sequencing reads and phylogenetic clustering. An average of 18.6 Gigabytes (Gb) (ranging between 14.8 and 25.7 Gb) of raw Illumina paired end sequence data was generated. The sequencing reads were cleaned, trimmed and mapped against reference sequence databases (Tables S1-4 ). An average of 106,839 (0.06%) reads were assigned to resistance genes, while on average 48.7%, 9.0%, 0.17% and 0.24% were assigned to MetaHit draft genomes, complete bacterial genomes, plasmids and human, respectively. An average of 41.8% of the reads could not be assigned to any reference sequence. Rarefaction of the reads mapping to complete bacterial genomes showed a strong degree of saturation in the sequence data suggesting that sufficient amount of data has been generated ( Figure S2 ). Clustering of samples based on bacterial abundance profiles showed separation of the airplane samples into several clusters, but with an overall association according to geography ( Fig. 2A) . Tetracycline, macrolide and beta-lactam resistance genes were the most abundant in all samples (Fig. 2B ) and clustering according to resistance gene class abundance was also to some degree associated with geography. At the individual gene level ( Figure S3 ) clustering also indicated an overall association according to geography. As expected the strA and strB genes, normally being genetically linked, clustered together, while clustering of floR and sul1 genes can be explained through the association with class I integrons. The grouping of tet(M), tet(O), tet(Q) and tet(W) is likely due to the general high abundance of these genes across all samples. Abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes. Compared to North America we found significantly higher abundance of antibiotic resistance genes among samples from South Asia, North Asia and all Asian samples combined (p-values 0.003; 0.005; 0.001) (Fig. 3A) . Additionally the resistance gene richness was higher in samples from South Asia and all Asian samples combined, compared to North America (p-values 0.04 and 0.03) (Fig. 3A) . In general an association between resistance gene abundance and richness was observed (Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.69, Fig. 3B ). These observations suggest a general independence of the individual genes and gene classes and an overall selection of a higher prevalence and diversity of resistance genes in mainly South Asian compared to American samples. In-depth analysis of the abundance of individual resistance genes showed that in total 31 resistance genes were found to have significant differences (FDR < 0.05) based on geographical origin (Table S5) (florphenicol/chloramphenicol resistance), sul2 and sul3 (sulphonamide resistance), bla OXA and bla TEM (beta-lactam resistance) and tet(A) and tet(B) (tetracycline resistance) in samples from South Asia. Additionally, the abundance of erm(A) and erm(C) (macrolide resistance) was significantly higher in North Asia compared to South Asia and of erm(B) significantly higher in North Asia compared to North America. Abundance of selected pathogens. Unique reads mapping to the human pathogens S. enterica, C. difficile and C. jejuni were observed in all samples (Table S6 ). No regional differences could be observed for C. jejuni, but the abundance of S. enterica was higher among samples from South Asia compared to both North Asia (P = 0.053) and North America (P = 0.031). In contrast, C. difficile was less abundant in samples from South Asia compared to North America (P = 0.0067) and North Asia (P = 0.089). Quantitative real time PCR was used to detect and quantify human noroviruses genogroup (G) I and II (Supplementary materials). Ten and 14 samples were positive for GI and GII, respectively. Significantly higher values were observed for GII norovirus in South Asian compared to North Asian and North American samples, whereas no differences were observed for GI (Table S7 ).
