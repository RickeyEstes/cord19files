Prior to testing the main hypotheses, the study conducted a number of preliminary analyses to ensure the validity and reliability of the data. First, by using AMOS 18, a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to evaluate the discriminant validity of risk perception, perceived benefit, perceived harm, and support for the relevant policy. One-factor and four-factor models were performed to test which model provided the best fit for the data (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988) . The hypothesized four-factor model yielded a better fit than the single-factor model (see Table 4 ) with a change in the chi-square of 275.98 (Ddf Â¼ 10, p < 0.001). Second, all variables in the study had an acceptable Cronbach's a value greater than 0.6 and were considered reliable (Hair, Anderson, Tatham, & Black, 1998) . Descriptive statistics, correlations, and reliability for all study variables are shown in Table 5 . These results indicate that the scales of the variables possessed adequate reliability and validity for use in the hypotheses tests. After statistically controlling for gender, age, and education, the villagers' ratings of their risk perception differed significantly Table 3 Indicator variables used for testing the causal model.
