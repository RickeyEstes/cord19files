In total, 11,533 deaths (6324 males, 5209 females) were registered in this region between 1998 and 2003. Table 1 shows age-adjusted mortality rates and YLL in the study region for 1998-2003. Both mortality rate and YLL increased between 1998 and 2000, and decreased between 2001 and 2003. The rates were higher in males than females across these 6 years. hand, Group II conditions, which accounted for over 80% of the total YLL throughout the observed period, increased by 2.7%. Most of the top 10 causes of death were Group II and Group III conditions (Table 3) . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) were the top three causes of death in each of the study years, while the ranking of the 10 leading causes of death varied slightly in the same period. Tables 4 and 5 and Figs. 1 and 2 should be considered together to determine the trends in these diseases by sex. Among the top three causes of death, COPD showed a steadily declining rate in both sexes (with a sharper decline in males); the steadily increasing trend in IHD was consistent in both sexes with a slightly higher rate in males; and stroke reached its peak in 1999/2000 followed by a decline in males and a slight increase in females. Two (male-dominant) causes of death, drug use and road traffic accidents (RTAs), had a steadily declining trend in males but a less marked decline in females. The mortality burden from self-inflicted injuries was higher among females, although the rates in both sexes fluctuated. The 6-year study period was probably too short to show any trend in major cancers. Lung cancer and liver cancer were predominated by males. The rate fluctuated for lung cancer but showed a slight upward trend for males. Stomach cancer and other malignant neoplasms had relatively steady rates throughout the study period.
