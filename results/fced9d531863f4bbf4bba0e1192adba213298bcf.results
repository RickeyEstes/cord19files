The spike glycoprotein of the mouse hepatitis virus A59 binds the MHV receptor (recently renamed CEACAM 1a), the host cell receptor for the virus, and promotes fusion of the viral envelope and the host cell membrane. Fusion occurs with the plasma membrane in a pH-independent fashion (Frana et al., 1985; Gallagher et al., 1991; Nash and Buchmeier, 1997; Sturman et al., 1985; Ven-nema et al., 1990) . Coronavirus spike proteins are unusual in at least two aspects. First, they contain a cys domain approximately 20 amino acids in length and containing 40 to 50% cysteine. The cys domain bridges the putative border between the hydrophobic membranespanning domain and the cytoplasmic tail ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, four of the cysteines present in the A59 cys domain are highly conserved, suggesting that these amino acids contribute to spike function. Second, the transmembrane anchor is one of the most highly conserved regions of the protein. To address the role of these domains in spike function, we have examined the fusion activity of spike proteins with defined mutations in these regions. To express the spike, we cloned the A59 spike coding sequence downstream of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMC) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence. The T7 transcriptional terminator closely follows the spike coding sequence. Expression of the spike protein was achieved by infection of murine DBT cells with vTF7.3, a recombinant vaccinia virus that produces T7 RNA polymerase (Fuerst et al., 1986 (Fuerst et al., , 1987 , followed by transfection with plasmid DNA encoding the spike gene. Using this expression FIG. 1. CLUSTAL alignment of the transmembrane anchor and cytoplasmic tail of the spike glycoprotein from nine different coronaviruses (Abraham et al., 1990; Binns et al., 1985; Delmas et al., 1992; Kunkel and Herrler, 1993; Luytjes et al., 1987; Mounir and Talbot, 1993; Parker et al., 1989; Raabe et al., 1990; Rasschaert and Laude, 1987) . Shown on the top is a diagram of the A59 spike protein from amino acid 1 to amino acid 1324. The position of the proteolytic cleavage site that divides the S1 and S2 subunits is also shown. The carboxyl-terminal region of the A59 spike (amino acids 1263 to 1324) that contains the transmembrane anchor (tm) is enlarged below and is aligned with the spike sequence from viruses belonging to antigenic group II [mouse hepatitis virus strains A59, JHM, and MHV2, bovine coronavirus (BCV), and human coronavirus OC43 (OC43), antigenic group I (human coronavirus 229E (229E), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)] and antigenic group III [infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)]. The solid black bar below the sequences indicates the boundary of the cysteine-rich domain of the A59 spike protein, and the dashed region above the sequences indicates the region of the cysteine-rich domain that is potentially membrane-spanning. The shaded residues are those that are conserved in at least eight of the nine sequences shown, and the asterisks above the A59 sequence indicate four nearly perfectly conserved cysteine residues found within the cysteine-rich domain. system, we can visually observe fusion of cells as early as 3 to 4 h posttransfection, and by 10 h posttransfection fusion is nearly confluent (data not shown). ␤-Galactosidase-based fusion assay. We have adapted the indirect fusion assay used initially in studies of receptor binding and fusion by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; Nussbaum et al., 1994) to measure the relative fusion activities of spike proteins containing defined mutations. Effector cells are prepared by infecting DBT cells with vTF7.3 and then transfecting these cells with the cloned spike gene. Reporter cells are prepared by infecting DBT cells with wild-type vaccinia virus (strain WR) and then transfecting with a plasmid containing the lacZ gene cloned downstream of the T7 promoter and the EMC IRES. Following transfection, the cells are mixed in a 1:1 ratio and incubated for 1 to 4 h to allow for cell-cell fusion. Fusion results in the production of ␤-galactosidase, which can be measured by monitoring the hydrolysis of chlorophenol red-␤-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG) in a spectrophotometer at 570 nm. The kinetics of fusion using the wild-type spike gene were rapid. Figure 2A shows the kinetics over a 4-h period, which is the time course for all assays described below. Significant fusion activity was seen as early as 3 h after the addition of the ␤-galactosidase reporter cells and continued to increase for several hours. In contrast, cells transfected with pTM3, the expression plasmid lacking the spike gene, do not undergo fusion. The basal optical density (OD) shown for pTM3 in Fig. 2A is due to the absorption characteristics of the ␤-galactosidase substrate CPRG. We verified that this assay can discriminate between wild-type and fusion-defective spike proteins by expressing a cloned copy of the spike gene from B11, a fusiondefective mutant of A59 isolated from a persistent infection of primary glial cells (Gombold et al., 1993) . Assay of ␤-galactosidase activity 4 h after the addition of reporter cells showed no significant difference in the levels of fusion induced by the B11 spike protein and the negative control, pTM3 (Fig. 2B ). In contrast, fusion in cells transfected with the wild-type spike protein was significantly greater than B11 or that in cells transfected with pTM3 (Student's t test, P Ͻ 0.05). Again, the optical density shown for lysates from cells transfected with pTM3 (and B11 as well) is due to the absorption characteristics of CPRG and not to ␤-galactosidase activity. For all subsequent figures, OD values were corrected for this background and normalized to wild-type. Role of the cytoplasmic tail in membrane fusion. This colorimetric fusion assay was used to examine the fusion activity of spike proteins with mutations in the transmembrane anchor and the cytoplasmic tail. Extensive identity in amino acid sequence in these domains is apparent upon comparison of the protein sequences of a number of different coronaviruses (Fig. 1) , which led us to hypothesize that the carboxyl-terminus of the spike protein was important in the function of the protein. To test this hypothesis initially, we used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mutagenesis procedure (Chen and Przybyla, 1994; Li and Wilkinson, 1997) to construct three C-terminal truncation mutants that removed increasing amounts of the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 3A) . We found that removing up to 17 amino acids (⌬17) from the C-terminus had no detrimental effect on cell-cell fusion (Fig. 3B ). In fact, removal of either 8 or 17 amino acids increased the spike fusion activity 50 and 100%, respectively. However, when the complete cytoplasmic tail was removed (⌬25), cell-cell fusion was decreased approximately 40% relative to that of the wild-type spike. These data argue that the cytoplasmic tail has the capacity to modulate spike fusion activity but is not absolutely required for activity. Requirement for the A59 transmembrane anchor in membrane fusion. To further examine the role of the carboxyl-terminal domain of the spike protein in membrane fusion, we made a chimeric spike protein (YS24) containing the A59 spike ectodomain and the transmem- Wild-type spike (F) was expressed in DBT as described in the text, and the level of fusion was quantitated at 1-h intervals from 1 to 4 h after the addition of reporter cells. Control cells were transfected with pTM3, the expression plasmid lacking the spike gene (s). Plotted is the mean optical density (Ϯ standard deviation) measured as described under Materials and Methods.

Transfection of vTF7.3-infected cells with YS24 failed to induce any visible syncytia in cultures. Quantitation of the fusion activity of YS24 verified that this A59:HSV chimera was unable to induce detectable levels of fusion (Fig. 4B ). The inability of the A59:HSV chimeric spike protein to mediate membrane fusion was unexpected since the gD-1 domains had previously been reported to support fusion when cloned into the VSV G protein (Odell et al., 1997) . The previous experiments suggested that the loss of fusion activity was most likely due to substitution of the transmembrane anchor and not the cytoplasmic tail. This hypothesis was tested by constructing two additional chimeras: KC23, which possesses the native A59 transmembrane anchor and the amino-terminal 11 amino acids of the cys domain joined to the gD-1 cytoplasmic tail; and KC22, which has the gD-1 transmembrane anchor joined to the A59 cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 4A ). Fusion activity correlated with the presence of the A59 membranespanning domain and the upstream portion of the cys domain in KC23 (Fig. 4B ). The level of fusion observed with KC23 was reduced approximately 40% relative to that of wild-type spike, which is nearly identical to the reduction in fusion observed in the absence of the A59 cytoplasmic tail (⌬25, Fig. 2) . The cys domain is required for membrane fusion. Since deletion of the cytoplasmic tail from the spike did not prevent fusion activity while the substitution of the transmembrane anchor in chimeric protein KC22 was fusion-defective, we concluded that the transmembrane domain contains one or more regions that are critical for fusion. The obvious candidate is the cys domain that overlaps the junction between the hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain and the cytoplasmic tail. To ascertain whether a requirement for the cys domain was responsible for the fusion phenotypes of the A59:HSV chimeras, we produced a spike protein that was entirely A59 in origin except that the first 11 amino acids of the cys domain (all amino acids lying upstream of the cytoplasmic tail) were removed. This construct, KC25, retains the hydrophobic portion of the membrane-spanning domain adjoined to the A59 cytoplasmic tail, including the last 7 amino acids of the cys domain (Fig. 5A) . We also constructed an additional chimera based on the fusiondefective chimera KC22, in which the missing 11 amino acids of the cys domain were inserted between the end of the gD-1 transmembrane anchor and the A59 cytoplasmic tail, thus restoring the entire cys domain (Fig.   FIG. 4 . Spike fusion activity requires the A59 membrane-spanning and cys domains. (A) Diagram of the chimeric transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Shown are the transmembrane anchors (tm) from the A59 spike (s) and gD-1 (2), the cysteine-rich domain (cys, po), and the cytoplasmic tail (ct) of the spike protein (ᮀ) and gD-1 ( ). The cys domain is shown as two boxes to indicate the putative border between the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail. (B) Fusion activities (mean Ϯ standard deviation) of the spike chimeras quantitated using the ␤-galactosidase-based fusion assay. The data have been normalized to the fusion activity of the wild-type spike protein and show the activity measured 4 h after addition of reporter cells.

The data have been normalized to the fusion activity of the wild-type spike protein and show the activity measured 4 h after addition of reporter cells. 5A). The rationale for analysis of this mutant was that if the fusion phenotype of KC22 was due to loss of the cys domain rather than to substitution of the transmembrane anchor, the replacement of the cys domain should restore fusion activity to the chimera. The fusion activity of these two mutants, as well as KC22, is shown in Fig. 5B . Removal of the majority of the cys domain from the wild-type spike reduces fusion activity over 99%, as shown by the lack of detectable activity by KC25. However, the restoration of the cys domain in KC22cys failed to even partially restore fusion activity. Together, these results clearly show that the cys domain is necessary for the wild-type spike to function properly in membrane fusion, but is not sufficient to restore activity to fusion-defective A59:HSV chimeras. We conclude that fusion requires the cys domain and all or part of the transmembrane domain. In this regard, Bos et al. (1995) demonstrated that the spike protein of A59 loses syncytial activity if the entire cys domain and cytoplasmic tail are replaced by the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein cytoplasmic tail. These investigators hypothesized the need for flexibility in the transmembrane anchor and suggested that the cys domain might provide this property. Mutation of conserved cysteines in the transmembrane anchor and cytoplasmic tail. To examine the role that the cys domain might have in either the structure or the syncytial activity of the spike protein, we made a series of point mutations at each of the four conserved cysteine residues present in the domain (amino acids 1287, 1292, 1296, and 1304; Fig. 1 ). Since more than half of the cys domain may constitute part of the membranespanning domain and, therefore, may potentially interact with the hydrophobic environment of the membrane (Bos et al., 1995) , we made three independent mutants for each conserved cysteine in an attempt to control for changes in hydrophobicity. Based on the normalized consensus hydrophobicity scale of Eisenberg (1984) , a mutation from cysteine to tyrosine is expected to result in little change (Ϫ0.03) while changes to serine and tryptophan decrease (Ϫ0.47) and increase (ϩ0.52) local hydrophobicity, respectively. These 12 mutants were examined in two independent experiments for their ability to induce cell fusion using the ␤-galactosidase fusion assay described previously. Table 1 shows the level of fusion induced by each of the mutants normalized to the activity of the wild-type spike protein. We found that mutation of any single cysteine residue diminished the level of fusion, but in only a few instances was fusion reduced to nearly undetectable levels. Cysteine 1287 (C1287) was the most sensitive to hydrophobic substitution and less affected by neutral or hydrophilic changes. Substitution of C1287 to a tryptophan nearly inhibited cell fusion, though the level of activity was still greater than that of the negative control (Student's t test, P Ͻ 0.05). In contrast, C1292 and C1296 were least sensitive to the neutral or hydrophobic substitution of tyrosine or tryptophan, respectively. Mutation of either residue to a more hydrophilic serine reduced fusion over 90%. Finally, mutation of C1304 reduced the level of fusion by a comparable amount with all three substitutions. Of the four cysteines that were targeted, C1304 was affected the least by mutation, and the levels a Cysteines (C) were mutated to serine (S), tyrosine (Y), or tryptophan (W). b Percentage activity relative to wild-type spike.
