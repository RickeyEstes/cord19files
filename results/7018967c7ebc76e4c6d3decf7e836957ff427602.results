Totally, 93 patients with a diagnosis of septic shock were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 72.53 ± 13.03 and 63 cases (67.7%) were male. The mean Shock Index was 0.79 ± 0.30 before fluid administration and 0.82 ± 0.74 after (normal range ¼ 0.5e0.7). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the sample patients including vital signs, VBG parameters, AG, and CVP before and after fluid administration and their changes in details. Bivariate analysis Pearson correlation tests revealed that pH and AG had significant negative correlation (r ¼ À0.21 and À0.18 respectively; %95 CI) with CVP, while HCO3 had significant positive correlation (r ¼ 0.35; %95 CI) with CVP (P value < 0.05), as shown in Fig. 2
