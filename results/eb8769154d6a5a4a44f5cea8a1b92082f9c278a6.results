Airway epithelial cell characteristics Cells were cultured under ALI conditions for 30 days, and R t was measured daily (Fig. 1) . The cells generated high epithelial resistance similar to that reported previously in NHBE cultures grown using ALI conditions (Lin et al. 2007 ). The cells reached a maximum R t on day 30 (1792 AE 87 OÁcm 2 ), and averaged an R t of 1204 AE 66 OÁcm 2 from day 10 onward. The NHBE cells grew into a well-differentiated airway epithelium resembling that of in situ tissue. H&E staining ( Fig. 2A ) revealed that cells differentiated into a pseudostratified epithelium with the presence of cilia on the apical membrane. The production of mucus was confirmed using alcian blue staining (Fig. 2B ). The formation of cilia was confirmed using SEM (Fig. 2C) , TEM (Fig. 2D) , and immunofluorescence for b-tubulin, a marker for cilia (Fig. 2E) . The TEM imaging revealed the presence of a 9 + 2 doublet in cilia, indicating that the structures were not microvilli. After 21 conditions displayed a V t value of À7.1 AE 3.4 mV. Basal I sc was 5.9 AE 1.0 lA/cm 2 (average of 4 donors). Preliminary NGF concentration-response curves (0.001-100 ng/mL) were generated to investigate whether NGF could elicit bioelectrical responses in airway epithelial cells (data not shown). The addition of NGF to the apical membrane resulted in a reduction in I sc . NGF did not evoke responses at any concentration after being applied basolaterally. The concentrations used to generate these NGF concentration-response curves are clinically relevant and reflect levels found in both the blood and BAL-fluid samples of infants experiencing respiratory infections and after surgery (Tortorolo et al. 2005) . Based on the concentration-response analysis, 1 ng/mL of NGF applied to the apical membrane was used routinely for the remaining experiments as this concentration provided the maximum response.
