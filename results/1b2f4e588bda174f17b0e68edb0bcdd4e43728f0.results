At days 4 through 10 p.i. mice infected with JHMV alone were compared to JHMV-infected mice which were protected via the adoptive transfer of 10 6 virus-specific DTH-inducer T cell clones (JHMVT) administered on the same day as the infection. All mice in the unprotected group succumbed to infection by 10-12 days p.i. ). Therefore, control mice were examined only at the early time points in infection. At day 4 p.i. a very slight periventricular and perivascular infiltrate was seen in both the JHMV and JHMVT groups. The degree of inflammation was more pronounced at day 5, with mild perivascular cuffing present in both groups (Fig. 1A) . The infiltrate, which consisted of both polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells, penetrated into the parenchyma of both gray and white matter and also involved the leptomeninges. Surprisingly, no differences between the 2 groups were noted at day 4 or 5 p.i. even though maximum virus replication is found at day 5 ), which should provide maximum antigenic stimulation to the JHMV-specific DTHinducer T cell clones. Meningoencephalitis reached its peak intensity at day 7 p.i. with the presence of thick perivascular cuffs (Fig. 1B) . The meningoencephalitis was still prominent at day 10 (Fig. 1C) , although less dramatic than at day 7. At both days 7 and 10, perivascular cuffing was more pronounced in the JHMVT group (Fig. 1D ) than in the JHMV group, indicative of the induction of a DTH response. Besides showing a severe inflammatory infiltrate, the parenchyma also showed an increased number of microglia and foci of necrosis. No difference in the types of inflammatory cells was seen between the groups. These data suggest that the adoptively transferred T cell clone was able to induce the migration of additional cells into the parenchyma, consistent with the biological and cell surface phenotype of DTH inducer cells. Moderate to mild encephalitis continued in the surviving JHMVT mice from days 12 to 18 p.i. Perivascular cuffing was generally less marked than at the earlier time points, consistent with the transient nature of a DTH response (Liew 1982) . Inflammatory cells were still present in the parenchyma at days 25, 32, 40 and 50 p.i.; however, perivascular cuffing was minimal. Ongoing periventricular white matter demyelination was seen at days 25, 32 and 50 p.i. (Fig. 2A) . At these later time points many subarachnoid space (SAS) plasma cells were found (Fig. 2B) , possibly indicating a continuing immunologic response to viral antigens. At day 97 p.i., mild perivascular cuffing by mononuclear cells was still found, though very rarely.
