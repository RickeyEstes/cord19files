Sixty veterinary practices distributed throughout the Netherlands signed up for this study and received sampling materials and information; 49 of these practices submitted samples. In total 195 samples and related questionnaires were collected; 169 (86.6%) of these samples met the inclusion criteria, whereas 26 were discarded because the puppies had diarrhoea for more than 10 days. Of the 169 enrolled samples 113 (66.8%) originated from puppies with acute diarrhoea (cases) and 56 from asymptomatic puppies (controls). There was no evidence of clustering in the data (i.e. lack of independence of observations) at the veterinary practice level for any of the outcomes studied (LR test, p > 0.05). Median age of the puppies was 91 days (range: 29-333 days). Median age of the cases was 88 days (range: 30-314 days) and that of the controls was 99 days (range: 29-304 days). Of all enrolled puppies 53.3% were male, 42.6% were female, and 4.1% were undefined (litter samples). Cases and controls did not differ significantly from one another regarding age (p = 0.330) and gender (p = 0.710). Pathogens were analyzed for their association with diarrhoea; results are presented in Table 2 . Diarrhoea in puppies was shown to be significantly associated only with CPV (OR 3.03, 95%CI 1.09-8.41, p = 0.027) and CCoV (OR 3.80, 95%CI 1.67-8.99, p = 0.001) infection. Association between the presence of agents and the occurrence of diarrhoea may depend on the severity of the disease, and cooccurrence of pathogens might influence the clinical outcome. The co-occurrence of pathogens and the association between pathogens and specific clinical signs was therefore further analyzed.
