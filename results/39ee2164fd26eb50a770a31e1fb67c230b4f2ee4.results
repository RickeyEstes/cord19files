From had chest x-ray evidence of pneumonia and were classified as probable case-patients. Eight case-patients (2%) were confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV, 206 (52%) were confirmed to be negative for SARS-CoV by serologic testing, and 184 (46%) had undetermined SARS-CoV status because of the absence of convalescent-phase serum samples. Cases were reported from 41 states and Puerto Rico, with the highest case counts in California (74), New York (51), and Washington (30) ; no cases were reported from 9 states or the District of Columbia (Figure 2 ). Of the eight confirmed SARS-CoV-positive casepatients, all had radiographic evidence of pneumonia and six were identified in the first month of surveillance (Table  4 ). Five traveled to Hong Kong, two to Toronto, and one to Singapore. Further case details have been presented elsewhere (18) (19) (20) (21) . Among the eight confirmed SARS-CoV-positive case-patients, seven had illnesses that were associated solely with travel to an affected area. Although the eighth case-patient traveled with her spouse (subsequently confirmed as a case-patient) to an affected area (Hong Kong, where both stayed in a hotel in which intense local transmission occurred [22]), the epidemiologic link was classified as close contact because the onset of illness occurred 13 days after the couple's return to the United States (18, 20) . The median age of all suspect and probable casepatients was 39 years (range 3 months to 91 years), and 53% were male ( Travel to an affected area was the most commonly reported epidemiologic link (83% of cases). Mainland China was the most frequent destination (39% of travelers), followed by Hong Kong (38%), and Toronto (18%); 22% of case-patients traveled to more than one affected area. The frequency of travel to China, Hong Kong, and Toronto among SARS case-patients is shown by date of illness onset in Figure 3 ; the periods during which these areas were considered SARS-affected for surveillance purposes are also shown. No healthcare workers with suspect or probable SARS (n = 31) were confirmed to be SARS-CoV positive; 17 (55%) were confirmed SARS-CoV negative, and the remainder had undetermined SARS-CoV status. The only possible case of recognized secondary transmission was between the married couple described above.
