During the study period, 175 patients with COVID-19 were included, consisting of 92 women and 83 men ( Table 1 ). The median age was 46 (IQR, 34-54) years. Fifty-seven (33%) patients had a history of exposure to the epidemic area. The patients consisted of 39 patients with severe hypokalemia (<3 mmol/L), 69 patients with hypokalemia (3-3.5 mmol/L), and 67 patients with normokalemia (>3.5 All rights reserved.

Only 10 patients had a plasma K + concentration of >4 mmol/L. No statistical difference was identified in demographic features and the prevalence of a history of exposure to the epidemic area between three groups. Seventy-one patients had underlying diseases, including 28 patients with hypertension, 12 patients with diabetes, and 31 patients with other conditions. The prevalence of underlying diseases was associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.05). the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is Among a series of laboratory examinations (Table 2) , creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transferase, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly associated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.01). Collectively, these attributes with elevated values were generally related to myocardial injury. A total of 108 patients with hypokalemia exhibited moderate decreases in sodium, white blood cells, and lymphocyte than the 67 patients with normokalemia. Among these 108 patients, 39 patients exhibiting gastrointestinal symptoms had a mean plasma K + of 3.22 (SD, 0.22) mmol/L, which was not statistically different from the mean value of 3.26 (SD, 0.28) mmol/L in 69 patients without gastrointestinal symptoms. Regarding the urine K + output, 20 patients with hypokalemia had a mean K + concentration of 32 (SD, 11) mmol/gram of creatinine, which was statistically higher than the corresponding mean of 18 (SD, 7) mmol/gram of creatinine for 20 patients with normokalemia (P<0.01). In the part of CT and ECG examinations, nearly all patients had pulmonary ground-glass opacities, in trast, abnormal ECG results were significantly correlated with the severity of hypokalemia (P<0.01) as the prevalence of abnormal ECG results was 77%, 33%, and 15% for patients with severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, and normokalemia, respectively.

Severe and critically ill patients had higher occurrence of severe hypokalemia, hypokalemia, abnormal ECG presentations, as well as elevated CK, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP (all P<0.01). Among these abnormal indices, hypokalemia was most common as 93% of severe and critically ill patients had hypokalemia. In contrast, elevated BUN and creatinine were rare. Abnormal ECG presentations were usually representative of hypokalemia and improved with K + supplement treatment. Elevated CK, CK-MB, and LDH often came to normal level within 3-6 days ( Figure   1 ). Elevated ALT and AST were generally mild and came to normal level after liver support therapy (Table 2 and Table 4 ). Most patients with intermittent abnormal oxygen saturation were improved after oxygen inhalation except for three critically ill patients who were given invasive mechanical ventilation. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
