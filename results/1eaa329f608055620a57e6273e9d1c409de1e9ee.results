The structure of Chd1 nucleosome complexes As Chd1 functions on transcribed genes, it is of interest to understand the interplay between Chd1 and histone modifications observed in coding region chromatin. As a result nucleosomes were prepared in which histone H3 K36 was alkylated to mimic trimethylation ( The overall organisation of Chd1 is similar to that observed previously by cryo EM (Farnung et al., 2017; Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017) and directed crosslinking (Nodelman et al., 2017) . The ATPase domains are bound at the SHL-2 location. Of the two SHL2 locations within nucleosomes, the bound site is in closest proximity to SANT-SLIDE domain bound linker DNA in physical space, but distal on the unwrapped linear DNA sequence (Figure 1 ). Chd1 predominantly contacts the nucleosome via contacts with DNA, via the DNABD in the linker and ATPase lobes at SHL2, contacts with histones are limited to the histone H3 and H4 N-terminal regions discussed below. We previously showed that Chd1 binding results in nucleotide-dependent unwrapping of nucleosomal DNA resulting from the interaction of the DNABD with linker DNA (Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017) . The higher resolution of the current structure shows that precisely two turns of nucleosomal DNA are . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

The extent of DNA unwrapping observed here when Chd1 is bound to nucleosomes flanked by a 14 base pair linker DNA is identical to that observed when Chd1 is bound to the opposite surface of the 601 nucleosome positioning sequence with a 63 base pair linker (Farnung et al., 2017) . As the interaction of histones with the two sides of the 601 positioning sequence differ quite dramatically (Chua et al., 2012; Hall et al., 2009; Levendosky et al., 2016; Ngo et al., 2015) , this suggests that the extent of unwrapping is dominated by the properties of Chd1 rather than the affinity of DNA for the octamer. The path of this unwrapped DNA is oriented away from the plane of the wrapped DNA gyre and is kinked at the location where contacts are made with the SANT-SLIDE domains ( Figure 1 ). Other than DNA unwrapping we do not detect additional changes in the organisation of DNA on Chd1 bound nucleosomes at this resolution. The orientation of the DNABD is critical in determining the extent of DNA unwrapping. The only contacts detected between the DNABD and the remainder of Chd1 are contacts with the chromodomains (Figure 2 ). The first of these is the interaction between K329 of chromodomain II and D1201 off two turns of nucleosomal DNA, a process that likely requires substantial force (Hall et al., 2009; Meng et al., 2015) . As a result it is somewhat surprising that the area of contact between the chromodomains and DNABD is so small. It is possible that additional regions of Chd1 including the Nterminus that is not resolved in the density map also contribute to this interaction as suggested by previous studies of Chd1 proteins (Liu et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2018 )(Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017 . .

The position of chromodomains is determined by each of the four contacts made with other components of the complex (Figure 2 ). When not bound to nucleosomes, the tandem chromodomains of Chd1 are observed to impede DNA binding to the ATPase domains (Hauk et al., 2010) . This gave rise to the prediction that these domains would be rearranged in the nucleosome bound state (Hauk et al., 2010) . This is indeed the case as the chromodomains undergo an 18 degree rotation when compared to the orientation observed in The repositioning of ATPase lobe II enables contacts to be made with nucleosomal DNA (see below), the histone H4 tail and the histone H3 alpha 1 helix ( Figure 2 -figure supplement 4) .These are the only direct contacts with histone components of the nucleosome. The contact with the H4 tails is conserved in mtISWI and Snf2 (Liu et al., 2017; Yan et al., 2016) . D729 and E669 are conserved across all classes of remodelling enzyme but D725 is not as well conserved in Snf2 related enzymes (Figure 2 -figure supplement 4B ). The conservation of this contact in Chd1 enzymes is consistent with the H4 tail playing an important role in regulating Chd1 activity; deletion or mutation of the H4 tail has been shown to reduce nucleosome sliding and ATPase activity (Ferreira et al., 2007) . The additional helices that make up the protrusion 2 region of ATPase lobe 2 in Chd1 are conserved in chromatin remodeling ATPases, but not within all SF2 DNA translocases. Within this region residues 638-642 interact with the alpha 1 helix of histone H3 ( Figure 2 -figure supplement 4A). The residues participating in the interaction are progressively less well conserved in ISWI and SNF2 related proteins ( Figure 2 -figure supplement 4C). A loop from Phe1033 to Leu 1045 in an equivalent region of the yeast Snf2 protein is not assigned in the Snf2-nucleosome structure, but this region is positioned such that a related contact with histone H3 could be made. The structure, also provides clues as to how these conformational changes are driven. A central event is likely to be the closure of the cleft between The partial repositioning of the chromodomains observed in free Chd1 is likely to be stabilised by additional favourable interactions formed when this repositioning occurs within the context of nucleosome bound Chd1. These include the formation of contacts between chromodomain I and DNA at SHL1, between ATPase lobe II and the H3 alpha 1 helix, between ATPase lobe II and the histone H4 tail and most significantly the formation of a substantial interaction interface between ATPase lobe II and nucleosomal DNA at SHL2. The repositioning of the chromodomains in turn acts as a lever to reposition the DNA binding domain. In the context of nucleosomes this results in nucleotide dependent unwrapping of two turns of nucleosomal DNA (Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017) . Conversely, the interaction of the DNABD requires linker DNA to be accessible. In order to investigate how the ability of the DNABD to interact with linker DNA is affected by the presence of an adjacent nucleosome, interactions between dinucleosomes with different separations were modelled. With a linker length of 19 bp Chd1 can be modelled binding the linker between adjacent nucleosomes ( Figure 5 ). However, as the linker between nucleosomes is reduced, steric clashes become increasingly prohibitive. The requirement for a 19bp linker is likely to provide a limit below which engagement of the DNABD will be less stable. As this lower limit is set by clashes between the DNABD and the adjacent nucleosome, it is different from the length of linker required to occupy the DNA binding surface of the SANT and SLIDE domains on a mononucleosome with a free DNA linker. In this latter case 7 base pairs of DNA make contact with the DNABD (Figure 1 ). The c19 bp separation below which access of the DNABD to linker becomes progressively more difficult resonates with the average inter-nucleosome spacing of 19 bp observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Tsankov et al., 2010) . As the conformation of the DNABD is connected via the chromodomains to the ATPase domains, the structure of Chd1 provides molecular connectivity between the availability of nucleosomal linker DNA in excess of 19bp and the generation of closed nucleotide bound motor domains. This potentially provides a mechanism via which linker DNA length regulates the rate of nucleosome movement (Yang et al., 2006) .
