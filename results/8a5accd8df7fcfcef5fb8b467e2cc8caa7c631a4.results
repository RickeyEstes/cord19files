Defining the key residues on the HCV E2 protein for the binding of 1H8 We developed a panel of mAbs by immunizing mice with a recombinant HCV E2 protein (residues 384-661 based on the amino acid sequence of the HCV genotype 1a H77 strain), which was fused with a human IgG1 Fc moiety. Among them, mAb 1H8 was found to be a neutralizing antibody because it reduced the infectivity of HCV genotype 2a virus in vitro in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 1) . The key residues involved in the binding of 1H8 were mapped initially by screening random peptide phage display libraries for 1H8-binding phages (Fig 2) . The antibody selected preferentially the phages that displayed peptides containing a W residue in a linear consensus sequence of APT(S)Y(S,T)SW. Based on our analysis of the sequence's homology to the E2 protein, we predicted that 524 APTYSW 529 in the E2 protein was likely to be the binding site of 1H8. To verify further the location of the predicted binding site of 1H8, we generated three C-terminal truncated forms of the E2 protein, which lack the putative transmembrane domain between residues 662-718 ( Fig 3A) . Our Western blot analysis showed that the E2-16Fc protein (residues 384-661) could be recognized by 1H8. The removal of residues 571-661, as demonstrated with the E2-14Fc protein, did not affect the binding of 1H8. However, a further deletion of the residues between 510 and 570, i.e., as seen with the E2-12Fc protein, resulted in a loss of binding by 1H8 ( Fig  3B) . These results suggest that the segment between residues 510 and 570, where the sequence of 524 APTYSW 529 is located, is involved in the binding of 1H8. The residue specificity of 1H8 was determined by replacing each of the key contact residues predicted by phage display with an alanine or glycine in the E2-16Fc construct (Fig 3C) . A Western blot analysis was then performed to test the specific effect of the substitutions on the binding of 1H8 (Fig 3D) . The T526A and S528A mutations did not significantly affect the binding of 1H8, whereas mutations of A524G, P525A, Y527A and W529A reduced the binding. These data were consistent with the prediction from the phage display analysis that residues A524, P525, Y527 and W529 were the direct contact points for the antibody. We also wanted to know whether the predicted binding site could be recognized by 1H8 in a linear fashion. Several ''binding site'' peptides containing residues 520-533 were chemically synthesized with or without alanine substitutions at the position S528 or W529 (Fig 4A) . The ELISA results showed that the peptide containing the S528A mutation could be recognized by the antibody equally as well as the wild-type peptide. However, the antibody no longer bound the peptide when W529 was replaced by an alanine (Fig 4B) . These results confirm that the stretch of 16 .67 mg/mL of antibody 1H8 was collected and used in neutralization assay in a 3-fold dilution series [15] . Monoclonal mouse anti-E2 antibody 2C1 supernatant was used as a positive control. Percent neutralization was calculated based on an irrelevant mouse anti-CD4 antibody GK1.5 supernatant [15] . doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0084346.g001 residues 520-533 forms a linear epitope for neutralizing antibody 1H8.
