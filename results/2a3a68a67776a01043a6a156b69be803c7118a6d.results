Confirmation of SGTA as a Vpu-interacting protein by Y2H Screening. To identify cellular factors involved in Vpu function, we carried out yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening using full-length Vpu as bait (for details, see experimental procedures). We identified five Vpu-interacting proteins, including SGTA, which was previously reported to bind Vpu 25 . Callahan et al. previously observed that SGTA overexpression inhibited HIV-1 release, but the mechanism of action was not established. Also, this previous study was performed before tetherin was identified as the key cellular protein counteracted by Vpu to stimulate virus release. Thus, in this study, we investigated the role of SGTA in Vpu-mediated tetherin degradation and HIV-1 release. Knockdown of SGTA has no effect on HIV-1 release. To investigate whether endogenous SGTA plays a role in HIV-1 release, we carried out knockdown experiments in HeLa cells. We used single or pooled siRNAs from three different sources (Sigma, Ambion, and Qiagen). An SGTA knockdown efficiency of up to 80% was achieved (Fig. 1A,C) . Under these conditions, there was no significant effect on virus release for HIV-1 molecular clones either expressing (WT) or not expressing (delVpu) the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu (Fig. 1A,B) . The Scientific RepoRts | 6:24934 | DOI: 10.1038/srep24934 knockdown of SGTA also had little or no effect on the expression of tetherin and no obvious toxicity to the cells was observed as determined by unchanged levels of tubulin expression (Fig. 1A) .
