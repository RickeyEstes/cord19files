Identification of a new HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope from HBV core protein HBV core protein is the most conservative and immunogenic component of HBV proteins. We used an overlapping 9-mer peptide pool covering the whole length of core protein (aa 1-150) and its variants (totally 191 peptides) for T2 binding assay to screen genotype B-and C virus-derived HBcAg-specific T cell epitopes , as shown in Fig. 1A . Several peptides were found to have high affinity for binding to HLA-A*0201 molecules, as evidenced by the FI (0.72 for HBc183-191, 2.41 for HBc141-149, 2.64 for HBc60-68 (V60), 2.47 for HBc18-27, and 0.04 for HBc82-90), as shown in Fig. 1B . HBc141-149 spanning from HBc aa 141 to 149 was chosen as the focus of this study due to its high binding affinity among the top hits from screening. To determine the minimal sequence length of the epitope, panels of N-or C-terminally truncated or extended peptides of HBc141-149 were synthesized. The FIs of truncated peptide HBc141-148 (STLPETTV) and HBc142-149 (TLPETTVV) were only 0.124 and 0.151, respectively (Fig. 1C) . The FIs of decapeptides HBc140-149 (LSTLPETTVV) and HBc141-150 (STLPETTVVR) were only 0.033 and 0.005, respectively (Fig. 1D ). All HBc141-149 truncated and extended peptides displayed little binding to HLA-A*0201, which indicates that the 9-mer peptide HBc141-149 is the optimized epitope in length. In addition to T2 cell binding assay, the capability of HBc141-149 to bind to HLA-A*0201 was observed in the refolding assay (Fig. 1E ). The structure of HLA-A*0201/HBc141-149 complex Next, the complex of HLA-A2 and HBc141-149 was prepared for crystallization to characterize the binding features of HBc141-149. The crystal structure of the HLA complex was determined to 2.3 Å resolution (Table 1 ). The structure of HLA-A*0201/HBc141-149 shows that HBc141-149 possesses a typical conformation of an HLA-A2-restricted 9-mer epitope ( Fig. 2A and 2B ). The unambiguous electron densities of HBc141-149 clearly show that position 2 (T2) and position 9 (V9) are buried in pockets B and F, respectively (Fig. 2C ). Compared to the typical HLA-A2-restricted epitopes which have an anchor residue Leu or Met at position 2, HBc141-149 has Thr at position 2. The side chain OH of Thr does not disrupt its inserting into the hydrophobic pocket B properly (Fig. 2D) . Instead, the side chain OH of Thr can form a strong hydrogen bond interaction with H atom of Glu on the α1 domain of the heavy chain, which helps HBc141-149 binding to the HLA-A2 heavy chain and stabilizes the entire complex. The side chains of amino acids P4, E5, and V8 protrude out from the HLA-A2 surface and may be involved in T cell receptor (TCR) attachment and recognition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first structure showing the binding features of HLA-A2 to HBc141-149 with an unconventional P2 anchor Thr. HBc141-149 peptide generates specific CTL response in HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice Then, the immunogenicity of HBc141-149 epitope was determined in vivo. Female HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice were immunized with HBc DNA-prime/HBc141-149 peptide boost regimen three times, using heat shock protein gp96 as adjuvant (Li et al., 2011) . HBc141-149-specific CTL was detected by ELISPOT assay 1 week after the last immunization. As can be seen in Fig. 3A , similar to the HBc18-27 peptide-immunized mice (positive control), a strong CTL response was observed in splenocytes from HBc141-149 peptide-immunized mice (SFC, 145.4 ± 58.6) . No peptidespecific CD8 + T cell response was detected from HBc82-90 peptide-immunized mice (negative control). Similar results were observed in the killing assay using HBV plasmidtransfected 293T cells (Fig. 3B ) or HBc141-149 peptidepulsed T2 cells (Fig. 3C ) as target cells.
