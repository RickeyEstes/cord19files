The systematic review, covering over 28,830 articles, discovered 50 event-based Internet systems, including subsystems, described in 99 articles (see Fig. 2 for the flowchart of these results and methodology). Thirty-two of the 50 systems have been evaluated in the literature in some capacity. Table 2 includes a list of all identified systems. The data extractions of individual systems and analyses that are more detailed can be found in Appendix B (in Supplementary mate- rial), which should serve as a database for other researchers in this field for future studies.
