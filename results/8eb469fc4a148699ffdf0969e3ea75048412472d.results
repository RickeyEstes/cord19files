The YXXΦ motif of the 3a protein is required for its trafficking to the plasma membrane Several motifs are present within the amino acid sequence of Orf3a that may be crucial for its intracellular localization. The 274 amino acids (aa) long 3a protein contains three potential transmembrane regions between residues 34-56, 77-99 and 103-125, followed by a cytoplasmic domain of~150 aa ( Figure 1 ). The cytoplasmic domain of 3a also contains a tyrosine-based sorting motif, YXXΦ (aa 160-163) and a di-acidic motif, EXD (aa 171-173). We compared the amino acid sequences of SARS-CoV 3a protein from several human and bat isolates available in NCBI database (Table 1) . YXXΦ motif is conserved in all the isolates studied where as the EXD motif is mutated in all the seven bat isolates and one out of 21 human isolates. The EXD motif was proposed to be an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export signal whereas the YXXΦ motif was shown to be crucial for endocytosis from the cell surface [19] . The topology of the 3a protein is such that the N-terminus is exposed to the outside of plasma membrane [11] . To study its cell surface distribution, we made expression constructs for the 3a protein and its mutants with a N-terminal Myc-tag. The 3a protein was expressed in four different cell lines -COS-7, HT29, MDCK and Huh7 and showed intracellular as well as surface localization in all cell types (Figure 2A ). This result is consistent with previous reports showing the membrane distribution of the 3a protein [11] . To study the subcellular distribution of the 3a protein we performed immunofluorescence staining of cells transfected with wild type and mutant constructs. The cell surface distribution was observed in non-permeabilized cells with the antibodies against the N-terminal Myc-tag. Staining of permeabilized cells with antibodies against the cytoplasmic region (aa 126-274) of the 3a protein was used to see its total expression and intracellular distribution. The wild type 3a protein was found to localize to the plasma membrane as well as to intracellular regions that appeared to be perinuclear and showed a punctate distribution ( Figure 2B ). The Cyto3a protein that lacks the transmembrane domains showed similar intracellular distribution, but was expectedly not found on the plasma membrane ( Figure 2B) . Surprisingly, the ΔYXXΦ protein with mutations in the tyrosine-based sorting motif was mainly localized in the perinuclear compartment ( Figure 2B ). On the other hand, the ΔEXD protein with the mutations in the diacidic motif distributed similar to the wild type protein. Since an N-terminal myc tag was present on all the proteins and was likely to be exposed extracellularly, staining non-permeabilized cells with the anti-myc antibodies confirmed the plasma membrane localization and proper topology of the 3a proteins. Only the wild type and ΔEXD proteins stained with anti-myc antibodies in non-permeabilized cells. These results showed that the 3a proteins are expressed with the correct topology of extracellular N-terminus and cytoplasmic C-terminus. The ΔYXXΦ mutant protein saturated in the intracellular compartment, but was not found at the plasma membrane, showing this tyrosine-based sorting motif to be important for its trafficking to the cell surface. The di-acidic motif, which is a canonical ER export signal, did not show any role in the intracellular trafficking of the 3a protein. The YXXΦ motif in 3a protein is responsible for its Golgi to plasma membrane sorting The subcellular distribution of the ΔYXXΦ protein was very different from that of the wild type 3a protein. To further characterize the compartments to which the mutant 3a proteins localize, we expressed them in Huh7 cells together with markers for the ER and Golgi compartments. The wild type and ΔEXD proteins were distributed to the cell surface and punctate structures that are likely to represent trafficking vesicles; these also showed minor colocalization with the Golgi compartment ( Figure 3A ). However, the ΔYXXΦ mutant protein was localized exclusively to the Golgi compartment ( Figure 3A ). Two subcellular distribution patterns were observed for the proteins. While the first consisted of a predominantly dispersed cytoplasmic and plasma membrane localization with a minor fraction of the protein in the Golgi compartment, the other showed a Golgi-saturated pattern. These distribution patterns for the proteins were quantified in multiple cells using the Golgi marker. An overwhelming majority of cells expressing wild type 3a or its ΔEXD mutant showed the first pattern, while all of the cells expressing the YXXΦ mutant showed the second pattern of localization ( Figure 3B ). The wild type 3a and ΔEXD proteins appear to be rapidly sorted from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane. These results suggest that the di-acidic motif does not function as an ER export signal in this protein; if this was the case, the ΔEXD mutant protein would have been retained in the ER. None of the proteins showed any significant localization with Amino acid sequences were obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The YXXΦ (where X is any amino acid and Φ is an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic side chain) and EXD motifs are shown in italics whereas mutated motifs are highlighted in bold letters. the ER marker. The ΔYXXΦ mutant protein was retained in the Golgi complex but not in the ER region or at the plasma membrane, suggesting that the tyrosine-based sorting motif is crucial for the sorting of the 3a protein from Golgi to the plasma membrane. Increased Golgi retention of the 3a protein leads to increased targeting to lipid droplets Cytoplasmic lipid droplets have been proposed to act as storage vesicles for proteins [40] . Increased Golgi retention of Caveolin-2 is reported to result in targeting of the protein to lipid droplets [41] . We investigated whether this was also the case with Golgi-saturated 3a proteins. To visualize lipid droplets we used the specific dye Nile Red to stain transfected cells grown in culture media containing free fatty acids. On costaining with Nile Red,~50% of the wild type 3a protein was found to be associated with lipid droplets, but the Cyto3a protein did not show any significant colocalization, indicating that the transmembrane region of the 3a protein was required for its targeting to lipid droplets ( Figure 4) . Presuming that these act as storage vesicles for excess or unfolded proteins, Golgi overload would cause increased targeting to lipid droplets. Expectedly, over 90% of the ΔYXXΦ mutant 3a protein localized to lipid droplets ( Figure 4 ). Reduced levels of the ΔYXXΦ 3a protein are due to increased lysosomal degradation In multiple transient transfections, we observed that the ΔYXXΦ mutant protein was expressed at much lower levels as compared to the wild type 3a protein ( Figure 5 A left panel). To investigate this, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed, which showed the mRNA levels of the wild type and mutant 3a proteins to be similar ( Figure 5A right panel) . This indicated that the mutant protein was either unstable or was actively degraded in the transfected cells. To explore this, we performed an in vitro transcription-translation experiment and found similar levels of the wild type and ΔYXXΦ mutant 3a proteins ( Figure 5B ), which supported the intracellular degradation model. Since the mutant protein was retained in lipid droplets, we hypothesized that this would lead to increased autophagy or lysosomal degradation. In fact, the ΔYXXΦ mutant protein localized with late endosome/ lysosomal marker Rab7 ( Figure 5C ). To further confirm lysosomal degradation of the mutant protein, we used two inhibitors -Brefeldin A, which blocks ER-to-Golgi transport and Aprotinin A, which inhibits lysosomal proteases. Both of these led to 3 to 5 fold increased levels of the ΔYXXΦ mutant protein ( Figure 5D ). These findings clearly demonstrate that mutation of the tyrosine-based sorting motif causes abnormal trafficking of the 3a protein leading to increased accumulation in the Golgi compartment and lipid droplets and subsequent degradation in the lysosomal compartment.
