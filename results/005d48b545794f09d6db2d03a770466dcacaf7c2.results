C-Cvd was-evaluated in comparison with the two broad-spectrum antiviral agents. C-c"Ado [22] and ribavirin [24] , against a wide variety of RNA and DNA viruses (Table 1) . C-Cyd showed marked activity against the following viruses: vaccinia, vesicular stomatitis, reo, parainfluenza. Sindbis, Semliki forest, measles, corona, TK-herpes simplex, influenza and SSPE. It was virtually inactive against TK+ herpes simplex, polio, Coxsackie. rhino and respiratory syncytial virus ( Table 1) . As compared to C-Cyd. C-3Ado was more active against vaccinia. vesicular stomatitis (in PRK) and parainfluenza but less active against the other viruses. Ribavirin was less active than C-Cyd against any of the viruses tested, except for polio, Coxsackie and respiratory syncytial virus. Against influenza. ribavirin proved equally effective as C-Cyd (Table 1 ). Neither C-Cyd nor C-c3Ado or ribavirin were active against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 at concentrations that were below the concentration required to inhibit growth of the host (MT-4 lymphocyte) cells by 50% (0.06. 1.2 and 26pg/mL, respectively) (data not shown). As the antiviral potency of antiviral agents in general, and anti-herpes drugs in particular. may differ considerably depending on the choice of the cells [27. 281, C-Cyd was further evaluated for its activity against vesicular stomatitis virus in a wide variety of cell lines (Table 2 ). Whereas C-Cyd inhibited virus-induced cytopathogenecity in PRK, HeLa. EhSM. Vero, CV-1. BHK-21 and BALB/ 3T3, it failed to do so in other cell lines (i.e. HEp-2, RK13, BSC-IA). The antiviral activity of C-c3Ado and ribavirin also varied considerably from one cell line to another. Moreover, the cell-dependence pattern of the antiviral effects of C-Cyd. C-c3Ado and ribavirin also differed from one to another (Table  2) : i.e. C-c3Ado was very active against vesicular stomatitis virus in HEp-2 cells where C-Cyd did not show much activity, whereas C-c3Ado was inactive in CV-1 and BHK-21 cells where C-Cyd proved effective. Ribavirin was inactive against vesicular stomatitis virus in PRK cells where both C-Cyd and C-c3Ado showed activity, whereas ribavirin was quite active in HK and RK13 cells where C-Cyd failed to show activity. That the inhibitory effect of C-Cyd on virusinduced cytopathogenicity (Tables 1 and 2) reflected inhibition of virus multiplication was ascertained by following virus yield in HeLa cells which had been infected with vesicular stomatitis virus and treated with varying concentrations (0, 1,lO and 100 pg/mL) of C-Cyd. The compound effected a dose-dependent reduction in virus yield, whether the virus content was determined at 24,48 or 72 hr after infection (Fig.  2) . The maximum reduction in virus yield (4.5 log,,) was achieved with a concentration of lOOpg/mL at 24 hr post infection. As shown in a variety of cells (Table 3) , C-Cyd proved inhibitory to host cell DNA and RNA synthesis (as monitored by the incorporation of [methyl-3H]dThd and [5-3H]Urd, respectively) within the range of concentrations (0.5-5 pg/mL) exhibiting antiviral activity (Table 1) . While inhibitory to DNA and RNA synthesis, C-Cyd did not affect protein synthesis in any of the examined cell lines (Table 3) . The dose-response curve for the inhibitory effect of C-Cyd on host cell RNA synthesis in Vero cells is presented in Fig. 3 . To establish whether C-Cyd effected a comparable inhibition of viral RNA synthesis, Vero cells which had been infected with either Sindbis virus or reovirus were treated with actinomycin D (30 pg/mL) so as to completely block host cell DNA-directed RNA synthesis. The remaining viral RNA-directed RNA synthesis was inhibited by C-Cyd at concentrations which were only slightly (at the most 3-to lo-fold) higher than those required for inhibition of host cell RNA synthesis (in uninfected cells that were not treated with actinomycin D) (Fig. 3) .
