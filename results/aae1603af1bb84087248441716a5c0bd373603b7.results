Two-hundred and fifty six patients were randomized, 129 received two single doses and 127 received two double doses ( Figure 1 ). All 256 patients received the first dose of the vaccine, and 95.3% (244) received the second dose. Withdrawals were due to clinical conditions detected after recruitment (1 patient) and missed appointments (11 patients). Among the 71 controls, there were 3 missed appointments for health-unrelated reasons. Patients showed a balanced distribution of baseline demographic and clinical variables (Table 1) including pre-vaccination antibody levels (Table 2 and Figure 2 , ''Day 0'' plot). Patients were predominantly middle-aged adult men, whereas among controls younger females prevailed. At enrollment, almost 80% of the patients were on HAART, CD4 cell counts surpassed 300 cells/mm 3 for more than 75% of them and approximately 65% had undetectable HIV RNA viral load (Table 1 ). Approximately half of the patients had a nadir CD4 cell count below 200 cells/ mm 3 . At baseline, more than 1/3 of the patients and 1/5 of the controls had seroprotective antibody levels (i.e. $1:32, Table 2 ). Antibody levels and the proportion seroprotected were slightly higher in the subgroup aged .40 years. Twenty one days after the first dose, the proportion seroprotected, antibody levels and geometric mean titer (GMT) rose substantially in all groups (Table 2 and Figure 2 , Day 21). Among patients, the rise implied approximately 50% seroconversion (slightly higher among recip-ients of double doses) ( Table 2 ). Seroconversion and antibody levels were much higher among controls, despite the modest seroprotection (Table 2 and Figure 2 , Day 21). In all groups seroconversion rates and GMT following the first dose were somewhat higher among participants aged .40 years. After the second dose, patients experienced a substantial rise of seroprotection and seroconversion, which exceeded that of controls. Antibody levels among those receiving double doses far exceeded that of controls (Table 2 and Figure 2 , Day 42). Participants aged .40 years showed higher seroconversion rates and higher GMT, compared to younger participants, particularly among controls and patients who received double doses. Six months (140-196 days) after recruitment, seroprotection rates among patients decreased slightly and GMT fell to half the level on day 42. Among controls, seroprotection rates increased substantially but the GMT decreased about 30% compared to day 42 levels ( Table 2) . Seroconversion rates and GMT were consistently lower in the single dose group, at all times, and the confidence limits of the difference in proportions of seroconversion and GMT ratios did not provided evidence to reject the hypothesis of inferiority of the single dose (Table 3 ). In fact, superiority of two double doses is suggested by a GMT exceeding the upper 95% confidence limit of the GMT after two single doses (Table 2) Compared to HIV-negative controls, seroconversion after the second dose occurred 1.82 times more often among two double doses recipients but the association lacked statistical significance (Table 4 ). Older age (.40 years) also increased the odds of seroconversion, being the only statistically significant predictor after adjustment of covariates. Consistently, the differences in antibody titers between HIV-infected groups and HIV-negative controls 42 days after vaccination adjusted for antibody titer before vaccination and for age were not statistically significant (data not shown). Among patients, seroconversion provided by two double doses was higher for those aged .40, women, those with nadir CD4 cell count ,200 cells/mm 3 , with undetectable viral load, and on HAART (Table 5 ). Seroconversion among women and those with nadir CD4 cell count ,200 cells/mm 3 was significantly higher when two double doses were used. The average reduction in CD4 cell counts 21 days after the first dose was more pronounced among participants who received two double doses, but the difference was not statistically significant nor clinically relevant (Table 6 ). After the second dose, a small average increase in CD4 cell counts was observed for the single dose group while the double dose group showed a negligible difference. In groups, small and similar percentages of patients showed increased and decreased HIV viral load. The most frequent local adverse reaction was pain, reported after the first dose, in 72% and 91% of the patients who received single and double doses, respectively ( Figure 3 ). In these same groups, after the second dose, 52% and 66% of the participants reported pain. Eighty-six percent of the controls also reported pain. The most frequent systemic adverse event was fever, which was reported, after the first dose, by 7% and 12% of the patients who received single and double doses, respectively. A total of 43 participants presented with ILI within 6 months of the first vaccine dose: 14 and 17 ILI events in patients receiving single and double doses, respectively, and 10 ILI events among controls. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected for 22 participants (Table 7) . No H1N1pdm09-related ILI was identified. In six patients seasonal influenza A H3N2 (2 patients) or influenza B (4 patients) viruses were detected, which is in line with the influenza season that occurred during the period of study. Of note, one patient that received double doses was co-infected with both rhinovirus and influenza B.
