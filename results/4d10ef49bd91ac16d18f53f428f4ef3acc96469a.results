Phylogenetic Analysis of Hepaciviruses ML phylogenies of the hepaciviruses ( fig. 2 and supplementary figs. S1 and S2, Supplementary Material online) indicated the presence of ten distinct lineages (A-J), almost all of which are supported by high bootstrap scores in the phylogeny of the genome-wide alignment ( fig. 2 ) but by lower bootstrap scores in trees estimated from the more conserved and shorter NS3 and NS5B alignments (supplementary figs. S1 and S2, Supplementary Material online). Lineage A contains equine and canine hepaciviruses. Lineage B contains the HCV (from humans) while lineage C comprises viruses isolated from Kenyan bats. Lineages D, E, and I all contain viruses from rodent host species. Lineage F contains hepaciviruses from colobus monkeys and lineage G contains a single virus found in African bats. Lineage H corresponds to the GB virus B which was isolated from captive tamarins (Simons, Leary, et al. 1995; Simons, Pilot-Matias, et al. 1995) . Finally, lineage J represents the recently discovered hepacivirus lineage in cattle. The phylogeny of the genome-wide hepacivirus alignment ( fig. 2) shows two distinct monophyletic clades (upper and lower; defined by the most basal well-supported split), comprising lineages A-D and E-J, respectively. Only viruses from bats and rodents are found in both the upper and lower clades. As expected, HCV is a sister lineage to the equine and canine hepaciviruses. The new cattle hepacivirus lineage (J) is an outgroup of the lower clade. Taxa within most lineages are genetically relatively similar, with the exception of the bat viruses in lineage C, the rodent viruses in lineage E, and HCV (lineage B). The lowest bootstrap scores are observed for lineages E and I, which are separated by a short internal branch ( fig. 2 ). Comparing the genome-wide hepacivirus phylogeny shows further topological differences from the genome-wide tree. Most notably, lineage G now appears as an outgroup to lineages A and B (bootstrap score = 94%) whereas C is most closely related to lineage F (bootstrap score = 86%). Other topology changes are present in the partial NS5B tree but none are supported by bootstrap scores >80% (supplementary fig. S1 , Supplementary Material online). Some differences between the genome-wide and subgenomic phylogenies may be due to random error or long-branch attraction. However, the well supported rearrangements seen in the partial NS5B tree suggest that detailed analysis of potential recombination in the hepaciviruses is warranted. We also examined the host species location of viruses in the hepacivirus genome-wide phylogeny; taxa were labeled by continent of the host species from which they were isolated ( fig. 2 and supplementary figs. S1 and S2, Supplementary Material online). HCV was ignored because its global distribution is highly complex and the result of recent anthropogenic factors (Messina et al. 2015) . The same may also be true for the equine and canine hepaciviruses, as their sequences exhibit a scattered spatial distribution despite showing little genetic divergence. Domesticated horses, especially racehorses, are transported worldwide, and this may have disguised any previous geographic pattern that arose from natural processes. The other hepaciviruses lineages are, in general, isolated from hosts from the same continent, except for lineages E, I, and J. Lineages E and I contain diverse viruses found in African, European, and North American rodents whereas lineage J contains viruses isolated in African and European cattle.
