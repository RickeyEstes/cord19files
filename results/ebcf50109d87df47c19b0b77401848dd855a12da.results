Demographic, health, and burden characteristics of caregivers are presented in Table 1 . Half of the participants (N = 220, 56.7%) had less than or equal to 9 years of education. About one-third (N = 113, 29.1%) finished senior high school and 14.1% (N = 55) had college or higher education. The mean ages of care receivers were 72.6 AE 12.8 and 69.6 AE 16.4 years for males and females, respectively. Most of the caregivers were females (72%). Over half of male caregivers were sons of the care receivers. One-third of female caregivers were daughters-in-law of the care receivers, and another 30% were spouses (data not shown). The correlations among the variables are presented in Table 2 . Age was positively related to the number of chronic diseases and negatively related to SPH. That meant as age increased, number of chronic diseases increased, and SPH worsen. Number of hours per day devoted to caregiving was negatively related to emotional support and SPH but positively related to mental health and burden scores. As caregivers devoted more time in caring, they had less time to use emotional support. Their SPH got worse, and mental health declined. Emotional support was positively associated with functional support but negatively related to mental health score and number of illness symptoms. Physical support was positively associated with mental health and burden scores, number of illness symptoms, and number of chronic diseases but negatively associated with SPH. Similar patterns were found for mental health and burden scores. Even though several correlations reached statistical significance, most of them were small in magnitude with coefficients less than 0.5. The exceptions were the correlations between mental health score and burden score, mental health score and number of illness symptoms, and burden 23.9 AE 9.3 23.6 AE 9.7 24.0 AE 9.2 Number of illness symptoms (0-7) 2.0 AE 1.7 1.6 AE 1.5 2.1 AE 1.7 Number of chronic diseases (0-4) 0.5 AE 0.8 0.6 AE 0.8 0.5 AE 0.8 Sum of SPH (3-9) 5.2 AE 1.3 5.5 AE 1.0 5.1 AE 1.4 a Including face-to-face counseling, telephone counseling, caregiver groups, or other support groups. Scores ranged 4-8. b Including, e.g., day-care and home-care providers. Scores ranged 6-11. c Including transportation, emergency support, and telephone consultation. Scores ranged 3-7. score and number of illness symptoms. This is also the case for the correlation between number of illness symptoms and SPH. The standardized regression weights for the significant variables are listed in Table 3 , and Fig. 1 illustrates the structural equation model for the physical health of caregivers. The model indicated that hours per day of caregiving, and the use of emotional, functional, and physical support systems were explanatory variables for mental health; and the hours per day of caregiving and use of physical support were explanatory variables for burden. The health measures were significant predictors of actual health problems. The negative coefficient between health problems and SPH was due to the scoring of SPH status, with a higher score representing better health. Mental health and burden were significantly associated with health problems.
