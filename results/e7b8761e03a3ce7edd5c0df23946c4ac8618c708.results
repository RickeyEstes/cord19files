LOD and linearity of standard curves using synthesized DNA: Standard curves were constructed using mean Cq values from duplicate 10-fold serial dilutions of synthesized DNA that included the target region of amplification (Fig. S1 ). Although the PCR efficiency for Salmonella Enteritidis and Eimeria bovis was slightly low (81.6% and 84.0%, respectively), the PCR efficiency in all detection assays was more than 80%, which was sufficient to quantify the target copy number. Furthermore, each assay had a wide dynamic range of at least 5 orders of magnitude. Sensitivity and accuracy of Dembo-PCR: Table 2 shows the results for LOD numbers and CVs of run-to-run variants. A total of 6 bacteria and 5 viruses were used for optimization and validation of Dembo-PCR. Isolated strains of Salmonella Dublin, Salmonella Enteritidis, MAP, Clostridium perfringens and Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) were obtained from the National Veterinary Assay Laboratory in Japan. BVDV, bovine herpes virus 1 (BoHV-1) and BToV, which were isolated from field samples, were also used. The test had high sensitivity and steady reproducibility in the spike test, with an LOD of at least 1.6 TCID 50 or PFU/reaction for viruses spiked into feces. The LOD of bacteria was at least 13 CFU/reaction. For the BLV provirus, the LOD was equivalent to 10.8 copies/reaction of the Tax gene. The assay using synthesized DNA as a template had an LOD of 10-100 copies/reaction. The coefficient value was 0.1-6.5%. Clinical performance: Table 3 shows the information of clinical samples and the results of the Dembo-PCR assay. BCoV was detected in 6 diarrheal fecal samples. In addition, BEV was detected in clinically healthy cattle and in sample No. 5. BToV was detected only in the calf feces. To confirm these results, gel-based PCR assays were conducted on all samples for each pathogen according to previous reports [13, 24, 27] . The gel-based PCR products were subsequently subjected to direct sequencing to compare them with the corresponding NCBI database nucleotide sequences. Gel-based PCR results for BEV, BCoV and BToV were in agreement with the Dembo-PCR results.
