The characteristics of this sample of 131 nondepressed female hospital workers are described in Table 1 . Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance were significantly associated with impairment in global sleep quality ( Table 2) . Attachment anxiety was associated with depressive symptoms, physical symptoms and sick days. Attachment avoidance was associated with physical symptoms. Fig. 1 illustrates the clinical significance of the relationship between attachment insecurity and impaired global sleep quality in terms of the proportion of subjects having global sleep quality above the cutoff, which distinguishes between normal adults and those with depression or sleep disorders. Impairment in global sleep quality was significantly associated with physical symptoms (Spearman's ρ=.42, Pb.001), perceived general health (ρ=.33, Pb.001) and sick days (ρ=.33, Pb.001). Depressive symptoms were also significantly associated with physical symptoms (Spearman's ρ=.67, Pb.001), perceived general health (ρ=.43, Pb.001) and sick days (ρ=.44, Pb.001). Table 3 presents the results of a series of regression analyses designed to test global sleep quality as a mediator of the relationship between attachment anxiety and the two physical health outcomes with which it had a significant (Table 3, Step 2b). In the final regression equation (Table 3, Step 3), only depressive symptoms made a significant contribution to explaining physical symptoms or sick days. A regression analysis of the relationship between attachment avoidance and physical symptoms is not presented because attachment avoidance was essentially noncontributory (R 2 =.02).
