Out of 96 faecal samples collected from diarrhoeic lambs, 24 samples revealed the presence of group A rotavirus by sandwich ELISA and PAGE. Age wise distribution of rotavirus in diarrhoeic calves is shown in Table 1 . From Table 1 it is clear that rotavirus incidence was more in 3-month-old lambs (55.55%) as compared to other age groups. Farmwise distribution revealed higher incidence (30.64%) of rotavirus infection in SBF, Goawbal followed by SBF, Dachigam ( Table 2 ). The monthwise distribution of rotavirus in three sheep breeding farms is given in Fig. 1 . From the figure it is evident that the peak prevalence of rotavirus infection in sheep breeding farms was in the months of April and May. The minimum and maximum temperature and humidity in these months ranged between 7.34 and 28.9 â€¢ C and 34.28 and 82.58%, respectively. Out of 24 rotavirus positive diarrhoeic faecal samples, 21 were positive by sandwich ELISA of which seven were positive by PAGE as well. Three samples positive by PAGE could not be detected by sandwich ELISA. Migration pattern of ovine rotavirus in RNA-PAGE is shown in Fig. 2 . The electropherotypic pattern of all the rotavirus isolates was typical of mammalian group A rotaviruses, i.e. 4-2-3-2 migration pattern and the bands co-migrated with that of bovine rotavirus. None of the faecal samples from healthy lambs was found positive for rotavirus. Ninety-six diarrhoeic and 33 non-diarrhoeic faecal samples on bacteriological examination revealed presence of 56 and four strains of E. coli, respectively. Out of 56 strains from diarrhoeic samples five (8.92%) were untypable, four (7.14%) strains were rough and remaining 47 strains were identified as belonging to 25 different antigenic groups (Table 3) . O26 and O113 E. coli serogroups were found most prevalent (7.14% each) followed by O21, O25, O82 and O157 (5.35% each). O25, O26, O30, O43, O75, O76, O102, O113, O132, O153 and O157 serogroups were isolated from diarrhoeic lambs positive for rotavirus infection while as O8, O20, O21, O26, O39, O43, O45, O69, O75, O82, O104, O107, O113, O120, O127, O139, O141, O143, O153 and O157 serogroups were isolated from diarrhoeic lambs without rotavirus infection. Only 15 strains belonging to O8, O21, O43, O82, O104, O113, O120, O127, O132 and O139 serogroups were found positive for congo red dye binding activity while majority, i.e. 41 (73.21%) were found negative for congo red binding activity. From non-diarrhoeic faecal samples four strains of E. coli belonging to O88, O113, O157 and O168 serogroups were isolated from four non-diarrhoeic faecal samples, out of which O88 and O168 serogroups were found positive for congo red dye binding activity. O113 and O157 serogroups were isolated from both diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic lambs.
