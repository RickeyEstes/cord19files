On the basis of analyses conducted on the prototypical EMC/2012 strain, we previously demonstrated that the MERS-CoV spike contained furin cleavage motifs at both S1/S2 and S2′ cleavage sites, 8 which are consistently observed in the many other MERS-CoV genome sequences subsequently derived from both human and camels. 10, 11 However, Chu and colleagues have reported the nearly complete genome of a camel MERS-CoV isolate, NRCE-HKU205 (referred to as HKU205) from an infected animal located at a Cairo slaughter house, but imported from Sudan or Ethiopia. 12 HKU205 has a spike protein containing 12 amino-acid substitutions and a deletion of 1 amino-acid, compared with EMC/2012. Intriguingly, while its S1/ S2 site is identical to the one found in EMC/2012 spike, the S2′ cleavage site was found to contain two substitutions: S886A and S888I. To contextualize this finding with more recent sequencing data and to identify other possible variants, we performed comprehensive sequence alignments of MERS-CoV spike S2′ sequences available on GenBank (Supplementary Figure S1) . We identify HKU205 S2′ as the only reported variant sequence in an otherwise invariant site for the 386 sequences analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein sequence reveals that HKU205 is divergent and forms a basal sister relationship with clade A and B MERS-CoV sequences ( Figure 1A ). The sequence for HKU205 S2′ was analyzed and compared with those of representative coronaviruses from all four genera ( Figure 1B ). While S2′ cleavage motifs show a high degree of variability amongst coronaviruses, the sequence immediately downstream of it, recognized as being the coronavirus fusion peptide, 9, [17] [18] [19] is extremely well conserved. However, HKU205 is the only known coronavirus that contains an isoleucine instead of a serine at the residue position immediately following the cleavage site, corresponding to the P1′ position of the furin cleavage motif. The unusual features of HKU205 S2′ among MERS-CoV isolates and coronaviruses in general prompted us to investigate further the implications of such variation on spike protein activation. Despite still containing two paired basic arginine residues, which are typically found in furin cleavage sites, the HKU205 S2′ sequence is not predicted to be cleaved by furin according to PiTou 2.0 cleavability scoring algorithm (Table 1) . 15, 20 Furthermore, the MEROPS protease database indicates that of the 208 known furin-cleaved substrates, none contain an isoleucine at the position immediately after the scissile bond (P1′). 16 To validate these predictions, we performed fluorogenic peptide cleavage assays and demonstrate that while furin was able to proteolytically process EMC/2012 S2′-derived peptide (V max = 7.3 ± 0.2 relative fluorescence units (RFU)/min), the HKU205 S2′ peptide could not be cleaved by the protease (V max = 0.6 ± 0.3 RFU/min) (Figure 2A and Table 1 ). To specifically assess the effect of introducing the S2′ mutations, we generated by site-directed mutagenesis a full-length EMC/2012 spike protein harboring the S886A and S888I substitutions (EMC 205-S2′ S) and performed a western blot analysis on MLV-based pseudovirions harboring either wild-type (EMC wt ) or mutated (EMC 205-S2′ ) S proteins ( Figure 2B ). In the non-treated condition (lane 1) EMC wt S migrated with the same band pattern as shown previously, 8 with full-length (uncleaved) protein and S1/S2 cleavage product due to furin processing during S protein maturation in producer cells. Treatment of EMC wt S with recombinant furin (lane 2) generates a new band (above 65 kDa marker) corresponding to proteolytic processing at the S2′ site. Although the EMC 205-S2′ S band pattern is identical to the one observed for EMC wt in the non-treated condition (lane 1), mutating the S2′ site abrogates furin cleavage, as no S2′ band was observed for EMC 205-S2′ S (lane 2). These results confirm that the HKU205 substitutions within the S2′ cleavage site block furin cleavability. We examined the functional consequence of the abrogation of furin processing in the HKU205 S2′ spike cleavage site by performing a cell-cell fusion assay in transfected Huh-7 cells expressing either EMC wt or EMC 205-S2′ spike proteins ( Figure 3A ). Expression of EMC wt S is accompanied by the formation of spontaneous large syncytia (non-treated condition). Furin overexpression or treatment with exogenous recombinant furin increase the average size of syncytia (from an average of~114 nuclei to~140-150 nuclei). Furthermore, inhibition of furin activity by treatment with 75 μM of the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK abrogated syncytia formation. In contrast, expression of EMC 205-S2′ S was not accompanied by syncytia formation in all conditions tested, including when furin is overexpressed or present exogenously. These data confirm that the HKU205 S2′ mutations abrogate furin-mediated fusion activation. Next, the luciferase gene reporter-containing MLV pseudovirions harboring either EMC wt or EMC 205-S2′ S were further analyzed. Quantification by nanoparticle tracking analysis of the concentration of both types of pseudovirions shows that the introduction of the 205-S2′ mutation did not significantly alter particle concentration produced compared with EMC wt S-pseudotyped particles (Supplementary Figure 2A) . EMC wt or EMC 205-S2′ S-pseudotyped particles were used to infect Huh-7, Vero-E6 and MRC-5 cells ( Figure 3B ), along with control-pseudotyped particles: 'bald' or no envelope particles (Δenv), and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped particles or VSV-G (Supplementary Figure 2B) . For the three cell lines, Δenv particle infectivity was close to background levels observed in the non-infected (NI) control conditions (~10 2 range of relative luciferase units or RLU). When positive control VSV-G particles were assayed, infectivity measurements rose to~10 6 (Vero-E6) and~10 7 (Huh-7 and MRC-5) RLU levels, confirming that this system allows measurement of heterologous viral envelope protein-mediated entry and infectivity. For the MERS S-pseudotyped particles, in all cell lines tested, a significant drop in infectivity was observed for EMC 205-S2′ S-pseudotyped particles compared with EMC wt S-pseudotyped particles, but the most pronounced effect was in Huh-7 cells (4.4-fold decrease) that naturally express high levels of furin. 8 Since there were no significant differences in viral concentrations between EMC wt and EMC 205-S2′ S-pseudovirions (Supplementary Figure 2A) , we attribute the drop in infectivity to the mutation of the S2′ site in the EMC 205-S2′ S protein. These results suggest that while HKU205 S2′ can still be activated by other host cell proteases, the loss of furin cleavability decreases its fusogenic activity. Previous studies have shown that MERS-CoV S could be proteolytically activated by various host cell proteases, including furin, cathepsins and trypsin-like proteases. [5] [6] [7] [8] To test whether HKU205 S2′ could still be cleaved by proteases other than furin, we performed fluorogenic peptide cleavage assays of both EMC/2012 and HKU205 S2′ peptides with either trypsin or cathepsin L ( Figure 4 and Table 2 ). Trypsin cleaved both EMC/2012 and HKU205 S2′ peptides, with the EMC/2012 peptide still retaining a higher cleavage rate (EMC/2012 V max = 220.5 ± 3.4 RFU/min, HKU205 V max = 67.6 ± 1.3 RFU/min). Cathepsin L cleavage was detected for the EMC/2012 peptide (V max = 5.8 ± 0.2 RFU/min), and to a much lesser extent for HKU205 S2′ (V max = 2.2 ± 0.1 RFU/min). V max data for the proteases tested in this study are summarized in Table 2 , and along with western blot data, suggest that HKU205 S has a more restricted range of activating proteases than EMC/2012, being unable to utilize furin and likely more dependent on trypsin-like proteases. As furin proteolytic processing of MERS-CoV S S2′ was suggested to add an extra layer of proteolytic activation, we analyzed the effect of introducing the EMC/2012 S2′ furin site within full-length HKU205 S ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 2) . Wild-type HKU205 S (205 wt ) protein, and a HKU205 S variant containing the EMC/2012 S2′ cleavage site (205 EMC-S2′ ) were synthesized, incorporated into MLV pseudovirion and analyzed by western blot ( Figure 5A ). Although 205 wt S is not cleaved at S2′ upon furin treatment (205 wt lane 2), the Furin cleavage prediction scores were calculated using PiTou 2.0 software. A positive score indicates prediction of furin cleavage, while a negative score indicates that furin cleavage is not predicted. The sequences were also compared with known furin cleavage substrates found in the MEROPS database. A + sign indicates that residues in the sequence fit with known furin substrates, while a − sign indicates that at least one residue in the cleavage site is not compatible with furin cleavage. The average values of the rate of furin proteolytic processing of fluorogenic peptides (V max ) are indicated and expressed as RFU per minute. introduction of EMC/2012 S2′ in the HKU205 S background allows for detection of the S2′ cleaved product. We next performed a cell-cell fusion assay on Huh-7 cells expressing either 205 wt and 205 EMC-S2′ S ( Figure 5B ). 205 wt S displayed low fusogenicity in all conditions tested, a situation reminiscent of the EMC 205-S2′ S condition in Figure 3A . The introduction of the EMC/2012 S2′ site in the HKU205 S background allowed for the formation of spontaneous syncytia upon expression (average of~60 nuclei/syncytium), which increased in average size when furin was overexpressed or when exogenous furin was present (~70 and~77 nuclei/syncytium, respectively). Furin inhibitor treatment abrogated the formation of 205 EMC-S2′ S-induced syncytia. These results confirm that switching the HKU205 S2′ site to the EMC/2012 S2′ site in the HKU205 S background allows for enhanced furin-mediated fusogenicity of the fusion protein. The 205 wt and 205 EMC-S2′ S-pseudotyped particles were subsequently assayed for particle concentration by nanoparticle tracking analysis (Supplementary Figure 2A) . These measurements showed that there were no statistically significant differences in concentration of particles produced between 205 wt and 205 EMC-S2′ S-pseudotyped particles and between these particles and the EMC wt and EMC 205-S2′ S-pseudotyped particles. The pseudovirions were then assayed for infection in Huh-7 cells ( Figure 5C ). 205 wt S-pseudotyped particles displayed low infectivity (2.65 × 10 2 RLU) close to NI and Δenv conditions (Supplementary Figure 2B) . However, a significant~2 log 10 increase of infectivity is observed when EMC/2012 S2′ furin cleavage site is present (2.21 × 10 4 RLU), confirming that the furin-cleaved S2′ site enhances fusion activation and infectivity. These analyses confirm that the narrow spectrum of activating proteases capable of processing HKU205 S2′ decreases viral infectivity and suggest that this strain may have a reduced cell and host tropism range.
