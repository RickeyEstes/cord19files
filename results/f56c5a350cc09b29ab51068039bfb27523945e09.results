Theoretical SIR model vs. simulated data This simulation (synthetic) study assumes an initial distribution of infected population fraction, X s,0 , in a gridded domain of size 20620 square cells with unit area. Subsequently, the space-time distributions of X s,t , Y s,t , and Z s,t are generated in terms of Monte-Carlo simulation using the SIR model in Eqs. (1a-c). In this study, the sptial variability of X s,0 is described by a covariance function of the exponential form p X (r)~p 0 e {3r=ar , where r denotes physical distance, p 0~1 and a r~5 . To describe population movement, we used a Gaussian kernel function, k s , with bandwidth b~0:5. In this simulation, the population portion that resides at a certain location and does not migrate is estimated as where r ij is the distance between grid points i and j. Equation (7) gives k ii~q~0 :682, i.e. approximately 70% of the population at each unit cell of the grid has residence time equal to the time step of the simulation. In this case, the recovery and transmission rates are assumed to be 0.1 and 0.4, respectively. The simulated spacetime distributions of the infected, X s,t , susceptible, Y s,t , and recovered, Z s,t , population fractions are plotted in Figures 1a-d for t = 5, 10, 20 and 30 (note the changing color scales). Figure 2 shows how the expected value of the ratio R c between the right-and left-handsides of Eq. (S2) (see File S1) varies with the distance Ds{s'D at different times t = 2, 8, 10 and 30. One sees that for all times t and distances Ds{s'D, R c is close to 1 and, hence, the constraint in Eq. (S2) is satisfied to a good approximation. That said, the SIR model in Eqs. (1) can be accurately described using a spatially homogeneous Q t -function. Similar results have also been obtained for different values of the parameters p 0 , a r and b in the corresponding space-time disease covariance models [19] . As noted earlier, Q t is a monotonically decreasing function of time t. In addition, Q t should include at least two parameters that allow variation at t~0 and produce different rates of decay as t increases; and a third parameter so that at t~0, Q 0 [(0, 1), and at t??, Q ? ยง0. For example, one may choose the function Q t~l exp({ct e ), where the parameters l[(0,1) and c,ew0. Other possibilities also exist. Figure 3 shows empirical estimates of the function w t calculated in terms of 300 synthetic realizations of the SIR model in Eqs. (1ac). One sees that the obtained estimates are fitted well by the functional form Q t~l exp({ct e ) with parameters l~1:0006, c~6:6777|10 -6 , and e~3:7237. The theoretical covariance of the infected population fraction is calculated from Eq. (S5) (see File S1) using Q s, t~Qt~l exp({ct e ) with l~1:0006, c~6:6777| 10 -6 , and e~3:7237. Figure 4 compares the theoretical spatial correlation function of the SIR model at times t = 2, 8, 10, 20, and 30 and the associated empirical correlations calculated directly from the simulated infected distributions. Calculation of the former is based on the theoretical covariances obtained from Eq. (S5) (see File S1) using the aforementioned exponential form of the Q-function. The latter are empirical estimates of the normalized to max-1 covariance function at different times t, obtained through Monte Carlo simulation. For small times t,10, one observes a very good fit between the empirical and theoretical covariances across space. However, as t increases and for large distances Ds{s'D the deviations between simulated and theoretical covariances become larger. We have investigated the matter to some extent and found that this is due to tiny differences in the initial condition c X ;s,0;s',0 , which propagate over time.
