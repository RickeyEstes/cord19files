CD4 expression and gpl 20 binding of CD4' cell lines CD4' cell lines of various mammalian species were prepared as described under Materials and Methods . Figure 1 shows the flow cytometry analysis of Leu 3astained mink cells before and after CD4 introduction, and also the fluorescence microscopy of the same cells . A wide range of CD4 expression is apparent on uncloned CD4' mink cells . CD4 expression by each Mink cell type was then measured quantitatively by radiolabeling each cell line . Figure 2a shows the level of anti-CD4 mAb 318 binding detected on selected cell lines compared to CD4-parental cells . CD4 expression varied from cell type to cell type and between individual clones (not shown) . In general, mink cells expressed the most, and human TE671 and Daudi cells, the least . The transfected cell lines, XC, CHO, and 2H3, also expressed significant levels of surface CD4 (data not shown) . The ability of surface CD4 to bind recombinant gp120 derived from HIV-1/Ill B was also measured . levels roughly proportional to the amount of CD4 expression measured by anti-CD4 mAb binding . It may be noted that surface CD4 expression was detectable on TE671 cells both by anti-CD4 mAb binding and by gpl 20 binding, yet it was barely above the background, nonspecific level of CD4 -parental TE671 cells . CD4 -U87 glioma cells bound more gp120 than did CD4 -TE671 cells (Fig . 2b) . Whereas CD4 -TE671 cells are weakly permissive to HIV-1 infection by a CD4-independent entry route, U87 cells are resistant (Clapham et al., 1989) . There was thus no apparent relationship between the amount of gpl 20 bound to CD4 -cells and susceptibility to HIV infection by routes independent of CD4 . Susceptibility of CD4+ cell lines to HIV-1 infection and cell fusion CD4' non-human cell lines (from four taxonomic orders of mammal) were exposed to 10 5 or more TCID of HIV-1 /RF or III B, and the cells were split twice weekly and monitored for virus replication . Reverse transcriptase activity was not detected in the supernatant on any occasion, nor could infectivity be rescued by cocultivation with the highly permissive human T-cell line, C8166 . Supernatant samples from XC-CD4+, CHO-CD4+, and 2H3-CD4+were negative for p24 antigen, 1 and 2 weeks postinfection . In contrast, each of the CD4+ human cell lines, constructed in parallel using the same CD4 expression vector, were readily infected with HIV-1, with the exception of U87 glioma cells (Table 1) . Each CD4` cell line was also tested for susceptibility to HIV-1-induced fusion by cocultivation with a "high" HIV-1 producer cell line (H9/RF or H9/IIIB) . No syncytia were observed in CD4+ non-human cell lines after overnight or more prolonged cocultivation with either H9/RF or H9/1118 (Table 1) . These producer cells both caused massive syncytium induction after cocultivation with the CD4+ human cell lines C8166, Daudi-CD4', HeLa-CD4+, and TE671-CD4`. No syncytia were apparent in U87-CD4+ cells and only moderate cell fusion occurred in HOS-CD4+ cells . VSV(HIV-1) pseudotypes are phenotypically mixed virus particles that bear the envelope glycoproteins of HIV and require a functional HIV surface receptor for attachment and membrane penetration (Dalgleish et at, 1984 ; Clapham et al., 1987) . After cell entry and uncoating, the VSV genome replicates to release viral progeny and cause cell death within a few hours . VSV(HIV) pseudotypes can thus be used as a plaqueforming assay specific for HIV penetration and envelope uncoating (Dalgleish et al., 1984 ; McClure et al., 1988) . Table 1 shows that VSV(HIV-1) pseudotypes failed to produce plaques (above background) on the CD4* non-human cell lines . Titers ranging from 103 to >1 0Â°P FU/ml were recorded on CD4+ human cells, except U87-CD4' . Proteolytic cleavage of gpl20 in the V3 loop has been implicated in the entry of HIV-1 (Hattori et al., 1989 ; Stephens et al ., 1990) . Cleavage of gp70 of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV-E) occurs after cell uptake, probably in the endosomes (Andersen, 1985 (Andersen, , 1987 . MLV-E infection of mouse fibroblasts is pH dependent, whereas infection of fusion-sensitive rat XC cells is pH-independent, suggesting that a pH-independent protease might be active on the surface of XC cells (McClure et al., 1990) . CD4* rat XC cells were therefore constructed and included in tests for HIV infection as well as the rat leukemic basophil line, 2H3, which degranulates after activation to release histamine and many proteases . However, no evidence of infection of XC-CD4* or 2H3-CD4' cells by HIV-1 was obtained (Table 1) , even after activation . Recombinant gpl20 derived from aging hamster CHO cells was shown to be cleaved in the V3 loop (Stephens et al., 1990) , so CHO-CD4' cells were also constructed and tested for HIV infection . As described above, these cells, like the other CD4' non-primate cells, were not infectible by HIV-1 (Table 1 ) . Since our CHO cells generated a background level of spontaneous syncytia during culture, it was difficult to assess precisely whether further fusion occurred after HIV infection . For this reason, proviral evidence of HIV infection was sought . DNA was extracted from CHO cells exposed to HIV-1 and subjected to PCR analysis using gag-specific primers . While PCR amplification of DNA gag sequences yielded bands of the predicted size on an agarose gel (Fig . 3) using DNA from infected human CD4* cells (confirmed by Southern blot), none was detected in CD4' CHO or mink cells . The lack of proviral DNA in these cells provides further evidence that the restriction to infection occurs early in the HIV replication cycle . Taken together, these results show that CD4 expression on the non-human cell lines studied was not sufficient to render these cells permissive to HIV-1 infection or cell fusion . Syncytium induction in CD4' cells by chronically infected, HIV-1 producer cells occurs within a few hours and does not require HIV replication . The failure of the CD4 4 non-primate cells to form syncytia indicates that the block to infection occurs at or before membrane fusion . The lack of VSV(HIV-1) pseudotype infection provides further evidence that the site of the restriction occurs before viral penetration and uncoating, as all cell types were fully permissive for VSV replication . Since gpl20 bound to CD4 on transfected non-human cells, but the cells were not permissive to cell fusion or VSV(HIV-1) infection, we assumed that an essential step in infection was lacking aftervirion binding but before uncoating . We therefore investigated whether bound HIV-1 virions would functionally infect cells after treatment with the membrane fusigen, PEG, as the infection of env Rous sarcoma virus has previously been reported by a similar technique (Weiss et at, 1977) . HIV-1 (RF strain, 10 6 TCID) was adsorbed to mink-CD4' cells, which were subsequently exposed to PEG . HIV-1 infection was detected by p24 antigen and by rescue of progeny virus upon cocultivation with the permissive cell line, C8166 . The results (Table 2) demonstrate that mink-CD4' cells are permissive to low-titer replication of HIV-1, provided that entry is mediated through PEG fusion . Thus cell penetration appears to be the block to infection in CD4* nonpermissive cells .
