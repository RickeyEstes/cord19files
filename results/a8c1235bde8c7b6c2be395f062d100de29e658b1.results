Experiment no. 1 disease and behavioral motor deficits ZIKV-infected animals began losing weight by 7 DPI and started succumbing to the disease by 11 DPI (Fig. 1) . By 16 DPI, all ZIKV-infected animals had died or been humanely euthanized. The onset of hindlimb motor deficits in ZIKV-infected mice ranged from 8 to 13 DPI (Fig. 2a, b) . Initial symptoms included tail weakness (tail not in the up position during walking) and subtle hindlimb lateral skidding and weakness (as indicated by a limp or wobble). Disease progressed quickly after the onset of motor deficits and morbidity occurred within 2-3 days. The severity of motor deficits generally increased rapidly, with VPS scores reaching as high as 5 or 6 before death (hindlimb dragging with little to no joint movement). Mice were grouped into early (8-11 DPI) and late (12-13 DPI) onset groups in Fig.  2c , d so that scores from later onset mice would not mask the progression of disease in the early onset mice. Deficits were more severe on the right side compared with the left, corresponding to the side of virus inoculation. Forelimbs were rarely affected. Seizure-like activity was also observed in ZIKV-infected mice (Fig. 3) . Six of 10 ZIKV-infected mice had some seizurelike activity, and 4 mice were scored as severe (Fig. 3a) . Seizure-like activity did not correlate with VPS score (Fig.  3b) . Half of the mice in which severe seizure-like activity was noted had no to only subtle hindlimb deficits after seizure activity had subsided. Additionally, there were mice with complete paralysis (VPS score of 6) that were never observed to have seizure-like activity. Two other disease phenotypes, walking in circles and extreme mobile activity (not shown), were also observed (data not shown). Interestingly, the severity of hindlimb paralysis and seizure-like activity did not correlate well with changes in body weight ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), suggesting that mechanisms affecting neuroinvasion might operate independently from those affecting systemic infection and body weight changes.
