3.1. Clinical observations and histologic lesions in conventional 9-day-old nursing pigs inoculated orally with PEDV Watery diarrhea (9/9 pigs) and vomiting (7/9 pigs) were first detected at PID 1 in PEDV-inoculated piglets. At PIDs 3-5, however, all the inoculated piglets exhibited watery diarrhea, lethargy, and dehydration, but not all showed vomiting, whereas none of the mock-inoculated pigs showed clinical signs. In PEDV-inoculated piglets, histologic lesions were limited to the jejunum and ileum, and included diffuse, severe atrophic enteritis at PIDs 1-5. The duodenum showed only mild villous atrophy at PIDs 1-5. No histologic lesions were evident in the large intestine and other organs of the inoculated nursing pigs and negative controls.
