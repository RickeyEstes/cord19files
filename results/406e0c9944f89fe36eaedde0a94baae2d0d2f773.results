Were recruited 316 newborns. The 1,865 phone calls made (median 4 for every child), produced 106 visits, and the illness confirmed in 89 illness. Rhinitis (91 %) and cough (69 %) were the most common symptoms. Upper respiratory infection was the principal clinical diagnosis (84.5 %), and 17 of the 72 samples (23.2 %) were positive. Most common viruses were RSV (41.1 %) and rhinovirus (35.2 %). Of the children visited, 17 out of 106 (16 %) (5.3 % of the cohort) were admitted to hospital. Diagnoses were febrile syndrome and bronchiolitis. We did not find any epidemiological factor associated with viral respiratory infection in positive cases.
