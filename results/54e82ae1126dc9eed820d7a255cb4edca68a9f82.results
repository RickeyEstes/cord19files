Expression of the PEDV N protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig 1a) . The binding affinity calculated by SPR analysis of mAb 3B12-1A6 and mAb 1H12-1C6 were KD: 4.91E-09 M (ka: 1.97E+05 1/Ms; kd: 9.67E-04 1/s) and KD: 5.09E-09 M (ka: 6.00E+04 1/ Ms; kd: 3.05E-04 1/s), respectively. The kinetics of the mAbs to bind PEDV were similar in the examination. A competition ELISA was performed to test whether the mAbs recognise different epitopes of PEDV. As shown Table 1 , recognition level of mAb 3B12-1A6 to its epitope was not blocked either alone or in combination with different mAb, and binding of mAb 1H12-1C6 to its epitope was also not blocked. These results indicate that both mAbs recognise different epitopes on PEDV. Cells infected with PEDV and stained with mAb 3B12-1A6 or mAb 1H12-1C6 showed typical cytoplasmic fluorescence of PEDV on the IFA, while the other cells infected with TGEV, PRCV and porcine rotavirus did not show fluorescence for both PEDV mAbs (Fig  1b) . The best result for detecting the PEDV detection threshold was obtained using the optimised concentration of the monoclonal antibodies in the ICA kit. We applied 0.60±0.12 µg mAb anti-PED 3B12-1A6 to a nitrocellulose membrane. The maximum intensity of test line colouring was detected when the mAb anti-PED 1H12-1C6 conjugated with 0.1±0.02 µg colloidal gold of coated on a glass fibre membrane for immobilisation. Further increasing the mAb concentration did not increase test line intensity. Positive results for PEDV-DR13, PEDV-KNU1309, PEDV-KNU1303 and PEDV-KNU1402 strains were demonstrated by the visualisation of two red-purple bands at the test line and control line on the ICA kit. However, TGEV, PRCV and porcine rotavirus were considered negative when only one band appeared in the control line, such as the cell culture medium. In the determination of the sensitivity of the ICA kit, real-time RT-PCR showed a sensitivity of up to 10 2.0 TCID 50 /ml of PEDV, while the detection limit of the ICA kit was 10 4.0 TCID 50 /ml (Table 2) . Of the 130 swab samples tested, 58 were positive for PEDV and 72 were negative according to the ICA kit, whereas 60 were positive and 70 were negative according to real-time RT-PCR (Table 3) . Thus, three samples were positive (threshold cycle value of 29.5, 30.2 and 31.7) by real-time RT-PCR, but not detected in the ICA kit test. The relative sensitivity and specificity of the ICA kit compared with those of real-time RT-PCR were 95.0 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval: 86.08-98.96) and 98.6 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval: 92.30-99.96), respectively. Piglets inoculated with the PEDV strain experienced moderate to severe diarrhoea starting on 1 dpi. Most infected piglets showing clinical signs died between 2 and 9 dpi except for one piglet, which recovered from clinical signs at 9 dpi and survived during the experimental challenge (Table 4 ). In a comparison of the diagnosis methods, examination with the ICA kit using swab samples showed consistent results with real-time RT-PCR in identifying PEDV.
