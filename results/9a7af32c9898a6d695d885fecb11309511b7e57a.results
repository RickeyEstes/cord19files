Immune recognition of E1 SPs, rEIBV, and RV strains M33, RA27/3, and HPV77 by cytotoxic T-cell clones. T-cell clones ATRVC2 and AT177C5 were determined to be CD4Ã·CD8-T cells by flow-cytometric analysis (data not shown). Both clones were tested in cytotoxicity assays for recognition of recombinant E1 protein, wildtype RV (M33) and attenuated RV vaccine strains (RA27/3 and HPV77). Both clones exhibited strong cytotoxicity for autologous EBV-BL targets sensitized with the SP E1(273-291) and, to a lesser extent, also killed the same targets sensitized with rE IBV or the three strains of UV-inactivated whole RV ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). In the latter case, the weakest cytotoxicity was observed with the RA27/3 vaccine strain (Fig. l) .
