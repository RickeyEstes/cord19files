Based on information identified in the literature review, a response algorithm for airborne infection isolation patient management and placement was developed (see Fig 1) . This algorithm can be used by all health care facilities that need to manage safely and isolate patients with diseases or conditions that can be transmitted via airborne droplet nuclei. For entities that do not have adequate numbers of properly functioning negative-pressure rooms, this algorithm provides guidance for temporary solutions regarding room selection and creation of safer environments for staff, patients, and visitors. Droplet nuclei are small airborne particles (#5 m in size) that are expelled when infected patients sneeze or cough. 5, 17, 19 Eventually, these particles will settle to the ground, but they can remain suspended in the air for hours unless they are removed by ventilation or filtration. 19 As long as droplet nuclei are airborne, they remain a risk to nearby susceptible people, who can inhale the particles and become infected. Airborne precautions encompass a category of measures needed to prevent the spread of organisms that can be transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei. 4,5 See Table  1 for a list of diseases and conditions that require airborne precautions and how long they are needed. The first group of infection control measures related to airborne precautions involves engineering controls to redirect, remove, or filter infectious particles from the air. This is accomplished by the use of ventilation and filtration or a combination of these measures. 10, 20 The second group of airborne precautions infection control measures involves protection of susceptible persons. Precautions include wearing appropriate 5, 20 having immune staff care for infected patients when applicable (eg, staff immunized against the patient's disease), limiting patient transport, and restricting the number of staff going into airborne isolation rooms. 4, 5 Protective measures for airborne precautions, such as appropriate respiratory protection, have been well delineated in the literature. 4, 5, 18, 20 The algorithm in Fig 1 outlines response steps needed to address both groups of airborne precautions infection control measures: decreasing the bioburden of infectious particles in the air and reducing the risk to susceptible people. The results from the literature review are summarized in the order depicted on the response algorithm, starting with the most protective measures and working toward the least. The algorithm and the results section delineate the appropriate order in which the steps should be instituted to provide the best protection by reducing the risk of secondary spread.
