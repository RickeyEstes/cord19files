Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Kaohsiung is a 2,435-bed general hospital with 384 attending physicians, 337 residents, 58 interns, 1,775 nurses, 830 technicians, and 567 administrative personnel. The occupancy of the hospital bed is approximately 90% and there are more than 7,000 out-patients a day and approximately 3,700 operations a month. It is one of the major teaching hospitals in southern Taiwan. Even with the outbreak of SARS in Taipei, there were still 4,000 outpatients a day and 1,200 in-patients in the early May. On April 26, the index patient, a 52-year-old woman from southern Taiwan was admitted to Ward 11A, Bed 1102A of the hospital with fever, myalgia, and pneumonitis. Prior to that, only seven sporadic suspect SARS patients visited the hospital. Two other patients in Bed 1102B and 1102C shared the same room with the index patient. A few days earlier, the index patient had been to a small community hospital a couple of times while visiting her son in Taipei. This hospital was a block away from the city hospital rattled by SARS; it also developed an outbreak of SARS that forced closure of the hospital on April 28, 2003. Two days after admission, the index patient was intubated and nebulized bronchodilator given for her respiratory distress. However, the diagnosis of SARS was not made until April 30, four days after the patient was admitted. All of the three patients in the same room were transferred to the negative pressure room for isolation. In addition, a total of 57 persons were quarantined, including 2 physicians, 34 nurses, and 2 respiratory therapists. The patients on this ward were quarantined in separate individual rooms of the same ward. However, a few patients were discharged against medical advice; these patients were reported to the health authority for follow-up surveillance. On May 1 -3, the two physicians and the one nurse who attended the intubation of the woman developed fever and evidence of lung infiltration on their chest-X-ray. By May 11, 26 people including 4 physicians, 1 nurse, and 21 patients, their families or care-takers of this ward developed fever and lung infiltration. The leaders of the hospital were however unaware of the impending crisis and took no special measures. The Office of Steering Committee was not informed about the situation. At noon on May 11, the CEO of the group learned about the situation through a third party and immediately sent two investigators to evaluate the situation. When the report confirmed the impending crisis of a major in-hospital outbreak, he quickly ordered the evacuation of patients from Ward 11A as well as Wards 10A and Ward 12A; all possible or suspect SARS patients were transferred to Ward 13A, which was equipped with individual negative pressure rooms as well as a negative pressure corridor outside the patient rooms. Entrance to these wards was sealed with access gained by a specific elevator designated only for this floor. A specific car was used for the transportation of physicians, nurses, and other health workers working on the SARS ward to their individual rooms on a specific floor in the dormitory while off duty. They worked for 1 -4 weeks and underwent a 10-day quarantine observation followed by a week of vacation. The main building of the hospital is an H-shaped structure; it was divided into A, B, C, D (4 areas). There are 18 elevators lined in 4 rows in the middle part of the building that connected the front and the back part of the building. The children's hospital is a separate building connected to the main hospital through the emergency room. Connections between the main hospital and the children's hospital were sealed as well as the connections between A, B, C, D areas. Thus, the hospital was sorted into five areas as well as different floors; health workers were not allowed to visit each other in order to avoid potential cross infection. Patient admission was limited to those with an acute condition; elective surgery was temporarily withheld. The patients were triaged into those with fever, those with contact with potential SARS patients, and those with no fever and no history of contact with SARS patients. The last group of patients could be discharged from the hospital for quarantine at home if their condition was stable; the list of these patients was submitted to the health authority for follow-up surveillance. Entrance to the hospital was controlled; visitors were limited and each was required to have their body temperature measured and to fill out a health card. The administration office was moved from the 6th floor in area C and D of the main hospital to the children's hospital, which was considered to be clean, and the staff was divided into two groups. An outpatient renal dialysis unit was located in Ward 3A; a standard operation procedure was implemented for dialysis. Dialysis patients were required to use a designated elevator. Patients with fever but no evidence of SARS underwent dialysis in a negative pressure room; SARS patients were dialyzed in their negative pressure rooms using a portable dialysis unit. In the following three days, many newly diagnosed SARS patients were identified as either being previous patients of Ward 11A or these patients' families or health care workers. The news media and public heavily criticized the hospital for negligence and cover-up; they demanded that the government contain and take over the hospital the same way as the city hospital in Taipei. Hospital employees lost confidence in the hospital; 128 nurses and 7 physicians resigned. On May 13, the CEO of the group brought a team of four physicians, four nurse leaders, and four experienced administrators from the headquarters to assist in the control of the situation and promised help should it became necessary. He visited all working stations, making himself visible, encouraged the house staff, and stimulated the morale. On May 15, the CEO of the group closed down the outpatient clinics as well as the emergency room, held a news conference explaining the whole event and the actions implemented, assured the public that the situation was controllable. The shopping mall in the basement of the hospital was closed. An open-tent outdoor clinic was set up for the screening of potential SARS patients and to serve patients of the hospital with an emergency condition. There had been no new SARS patients reported from the in-patient or health care workers group after May 17, although there were already 46 possible SARS patients related to this outbreak and still 8 more new SARS patients developed outside the hospital between May 19 and May 24. On May 20, the CEO of the group held a second news conference announcing full control of the situation and reassured the public that the outpatient clinic and the emergency service would be open again 2 weeks later. Pharmacy service for refill of prescription to patients was open in the children's hospital. The angry news media and public gradually calmed down. On June 2, the outpatient clinic and the emergency service resumed but was limited to chronic old patients of the hospital or those with an emergency condition; elective operation was prohibited. There was only one clinic for each subspecialty with a maximum of 40 patients a day. Previously implemented operation pro-cedures were maintained. The outpatient and the inpatient service gradually resumed in the following weeks and the hospital crisis was over.
