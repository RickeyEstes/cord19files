Of the 3078 faecal samples received, a total of 2568 were processed for EM. A virus was seen in 506 (19.7%). The positivity rate increased with consistency ( Requests with text strings indicating gastroenteritis accompanying faeces processed for EM were present in 223 (54.8%) of the liquid faeces, 794 (57.4%) of the semisolid faeces and 465 (59.8%) of the solid faeces. These differences were not significant (Chi-squared for linear trend = 2.937, P-value = 0.09). In contrast, text strings indicating gastroenteritis were present in 357 (70.5%) requests accompanying EM positive faeces and in 1125 (54.5%) requests accompanying EM negative faeces (Chi-squared=225.8, P-value <0.0001).
