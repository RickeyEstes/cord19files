In order to assess the immunotherapeutic potential of the Leishmune ® vaccine on canine visceral leishmaniasis, formulated with an increased adjuvant concentration (from 0.5 to 1 mg of saponin), 24 mongrel dogs were infected with 2 × 10 8 amastigotes of L. (L.) chagasi BH46 obtained from hamsters spleens. The animals were monitored monthly for their anti-FML IgG antibodies ( Fig. 1A and B). Until month 5 after infection, no antibodies were detected; between month 5-6 (150-180 days of infection), all animals started to give positive results in the FML-ELISA assay (cut-off Abs 492m = 0,450) and in month 6, the first clinical signs were noted. At this point, the enriched-Leishmune ® vaccine was injected in the immunotherapy group (months 6, 7 and 8), while the control group received only saline. Starting from month 7, soon after the first vaccine dose, and as expected for a saponin-containing vaccine, a rapid increase of IgG anti-FML antibodies was observed in vaccinees, while control dogs showed lower and stable titters (Fig. 1A) . The ANOVA analysis revealed significant differences both between times (p < 0.0001) and between treatments (p < 0.0001). Differences started in month 5 (Student-Newman-Keuls method-SPSS for windows). In Four control dogs (number 1,2,3 and 10) turned to seronegative at month 7, indicating the control and spontaneous resolution of infection. We further determined the isotype of the antibodies produced against the FML antigen in each group of dogs. Fig. 1C shows the IgG2 (TH1 Tcell response) and IgG1 (TH2 T-cell response) absorbencies with regard to anti-FML antibodies. The animals vaccinated with the enriched-Leishmune ® vaccine, that induced high levels of specific IgG antibodies (Fig. 1A ) also showed increased IgG2 and IgG1 responses over the saline control. Both groups showed the same antibody levels by the time of infection (month 0). While immunotherapy treatment induced a higher and stable IgG2 response in vaccines (TH1 type of immune response), the IgG2 response decreased in the untreated controls with the progression of infection. On the other hand, the IgG1 antibodies diminished after vaccination and showed a mild trend to increase in the untreated infected animals (TH2 immune response) (Fig. 1C) . The cellular immune response was first assayed by the analysis of the DTH response against the L. (L.) donovani lysate. The individual DTH reactions were monitored at month 9 and 11 and are summarized in Fig. 2 . The immunotherapy treatment leads to a protective effect showing more positive reactions in vaccinated dogs than the untreated controls. In month 9, just after complete vaccination, 75% of the vaccinees (9/12) and only 50% of the controls (6/12) showed positive DTH responses (above 5 mm diameters) ( Fig. 2A) . Also, at month 11, reactions were positive in 84% of those which received the vaccine (10/12) and 75% of controls (9/12) (Fig. 2B) . Neither the differences in percentages of positive reactions (χ 2 square test) nor in the size of skin swelling were significant (ANOVA; p = 0.778 for differences between treatments and p = 0.09 differences in times) and this is probably because of the heterogeneity of the reactions (5-15 mm). The control dogs 1,2 and 3 that spontaneously lost the antibody response ( Fig. 1B) showed, as expected, high IDR values (12 mm), confirming their resistant condition to infection and natural protection. The cellular immune response was also evaluated by means of the relative proportions of PBMC lymphocyte subsets at month 12, after infection. The T cell immunosuppression and reduction of CD4+ and CD21+ lymphocyte populations are expected to occur in severe kala-azar and are positively related to the infective status of dogs for the insect vector [40] . (Table 1) . The increase in clinical signs is correlated with the increase in anti-FML antibodies of the saline treated group (p < 0.0001, Pearson Two Tailed Correlation coefficient), indicating that the experimental infection reproduced the development of the natural disease. Dogs were asymptomatic at the beginning of the assay and until six months after infection, when the vaccination treatment begun (Table 2) . While an increase in the number of symptoms was noted in both the vaccinees and untreated controls throughout the experiment, the differences in number of clinical signs were highly significant, both between treatments (ANOVA, p < 0.0001) and between times (ANOVA, p < 0.0001). The number of clinical signs was higher in saline controls. The difference in number of signs, between treatments started at month 8 (Table 2) , when vaccination was completed (p < 0.05, Student-Newman-Keuls test and Tukey's honestly significant difference, SPSS for windows). Also, little difference was seen between total scores of treated and untreated animals soon after vaccination (month 6,7 and 8) while stronger differences were noticed in month 11 and 15 (scores of 42 and 60 for untreated and 30 and 45 for vaccinated dogs, respectively). We also described the evolution of clinical signs of visceral leishmaniasis using a score that quantifies the number of signs and discriminates slight from sever symptoms ( Table 2) . Three levels of lymph node enlargement were discriminated: 0 for no detection, 1 for small (SL; up to 1 cm); 2 for medium (ML; 1-1.5 cm) and 3 for large lymph nodes (LL; ≥2 cm). Loss of weight was also considered as level 2 for mild loss (MW) ranging from 0-2 kg, and level 3 for Animals were clinically evaluated monthly for: alopecia (A); onycogryphosis (O); skin lesions (S), oedema (OE), popliteal and cervical lymph node enlargement and loss of weight. Three levels of lymph node enlargement were discriminated: 0 for no detection, 1 for small (SL; up to 1 cm); 2 for medium (ML; 1-1.5 cm) and 3 for large lymph nodes (LL; ≥2 cm). Loss of weight was also classified as 2 for mild weight loss (MW) when ranging from 0-2 kg, and 3 for severe weight loss (SW) when ranging from 2-5 kg. Detection of alopecia; onycogryphosis or skin lesions or oedema were considered of value = 1. severe loss (SW) ranging from 2-5 kg. Detection of alopecia (A); onycogryphosis (O) skin lesions (S) or oedema (OE) was considered of value = 1. No death or severe kala-azar cases were detected during the study period. Only dog 7 died, in month 15 by the end of experiment, but due to an accident apparently not related to the disease. The average of the scores of total clinical signs, which expresses the number and severity of visceral leishmaniasis symptoms of saline controls (17.83), falls outside the 95% confidence interval of the Leishmune ® immunotherapy-treated dogs 15.75 (CI95% 13.97-17.53) confirming the protection induced by the Leishmune ® immunotherapy treatment, that reduced the number and severity of the symptoms. The number of clinical signs is correlated with the decline in Leishmaniaspecific CD4+ lymphocyte proportions (p = 0.035, Pearson Two Tailed Correlation coefficient), which points out the onset of the kala-azar immunosuppresion. Fig. 3 On the other hand, untreated controls number 1,2, and 3 which spontaneously lost their antibody response (Fig. 1) , sustained normal CD4+ counts and showed strong IDR reactions, displayed the lowest scores of clinical signs (Table 2 and ily E), despite their common genetic backgrounds are highly protected (Fig. 3) . In Table 3 , we further summarized the results of parasite evidence from each dog at month 6, 9 and 11 after infection, and the results of parasite detection in liver, spleen and lymph nodes obtained after autopsy in month 15. No positive results were seen at month 6, in the in vitro culture analysis of blood and bone marrow samples (results not shown). On the other hand, the in vivo parasite amplification of blood, Signs  4  4  7  6  5  1  4  4  5  3  6  3  3  1  3  4   Total  12  12  12  12  12  11  11  11  12  12  12  12  12  12  12  12 The bone marrow and lymph node samples in hamsters (months 6 and 11), and the bone marrow PCR analysis (month 9) showed higher sensitivity ( Table 2) . We recorded as positive, hamsters infected with dog samples 90 days before that either died of visceral leishmaniasis or had parasites in spleen or liver. Taking into the account the proportion of positive results among the total of evaluations, the saline treated group showed a higher percent of parasite evidence (35/93; 37.6%) than the Leishmune ® treated group (28/96; 29.2%) ( Table 3) indicating that for the saline treated animals the disease was in progress, whereas the vaccinated animals controlled their parasitaemia and probably their potential infectiousness to insects. This difference however, was not statistically significant. Of note, dogs 1,2,3 from the saline control and dogs 4 and 5 from the vaccinated group which did not show any parasite evidence belong to the same family and litter suggesting a possible genetic background for the resistance of these animals. A significant positive correlation was found between the evolution of the number of symptoms and the number of parasitological evidences with time (p = 0.038), starting from month 9 after infection, soon after complete vaccination. This confirms the protective potential of the enriched-Leishmune ® vaccine that reduced the clinical symptoms, parasite evidence and infectiousness of vaccinated dogs, modulating the outcome of the infection. The safety and reactogenicity of the 1 mg saponin-Leishmune ® vaccine were also assessed. The incidence of adverse effects in dogs vaccinated with 1 mg-Leishmune ® vaccine was quantified as the percentage of dogs showing any sign of pain, local swelling, apathy, anorexia, diarrhoea or vomit (Table 4 ), recorded after one or more injections of the vaccine. The number of dogs showing pain (25%), significantly increased from the 1st to the 3rd dose (p < 0.001, ANOVA). The pain after each vaccination dose only lasted for 48 h (p = 0.006). Local swelling was the most commonly noticed adverse effect (63%), and although the number of reactive dogs was apparently increased after the first dose (Table 4) , no significant differences between doses 1,2 and 3 were noted. Also, in 92% of the animals, the swelling reaction was transient, declining after the first 24 h after each dose and completely disappearing fourth days after injection (Table 4) . Apathy reactions (11%), significantly decreased (p = 0.039) after the first 24 h hours after each dose (p < 0.05; Tukey's honestly significant difference method, SPSS for windows). No deaths, anorexia, vomit, diarrhoea, allergy or anaphylactic effects were registered indicating that the adverse effects were mild and that the vaccine was very tolerable. The results of evolution of: anti-FML IgG antibodies, IDR to L. (L.) donovani lysate, CD4+ Leishmania-specific lymphocytes counts in blood (in vitro), parasite or DNA evidence and clinical signs point to the positive immunotherapeutic potential of the 1 mg saponin-Leishmune ® vaccine on the development of canine visceral leishmaniasis and its potential effect on dog's infectiousness to phlebotomines. The toxicity analysis revealed that the vaccine was safe and with acceptable reactogenicity.
