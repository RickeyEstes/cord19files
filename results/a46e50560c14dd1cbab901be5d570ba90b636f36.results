The culture fluid from 25 undiluted passages was assayed for infectivity at each passage ( Fig. 1) . From passages 1 to 5, a constant level of infectious viruses was produced. During passages 6 to 8, however, the yield of infectious viruses was significantly reduced. At passage 9, infectivity of the culture supernatant increased, but it was again reduced from passages 10 to 12. These cyclic increases and decreases in infectivity were observed until passage 25. Severe syncytial formation was observed in all 25 passages. To determine if the reduction in the yield of infectious virus was due to the presence of DI particles, a'n interference analysis was performed with several culture fluid samples at different passage levels. As shown in Table 1 , the multiplication of the standard JHM virus was specifically in- hibited by passaged virus stock samples at passage levels 10, 15, and 20. A slight inhibition was observed with a sample at passage 5. However, the growth of VW was not interfered with by passages 10 and 20 virus samples. To test whether this interference was mediated by DI particles or another agent, such as interferon, passage 1 and 10 viruses were first metabolically labeled with [3Hjuridine and centrifuged to equilibrium. Infected culture fluid (400 ml) from passages 1 and 10 was then precipitated with ammonium sulfate, as described under Materials and Methods, and this unlabeled material was mixed with the partially purified labeled virus from the corresponding passage level. These mixtures were then applied to a 20 to 60% continuous sucrose gradient. As shown in Fig. 2 , a single radioactive peak, corresponding to the infectivity peak, appeared in both virus preparations at a buoyant density of 1.196 g/cm3. The activity of interference with standard JHM virus was detected in the virus preparation of passage 10 but not in that of passage 1. This interference activity coincided with the peak of radioactivity and infectivity. The results indicated that the agent causing interference could not be separated from standard infectious virions by this sucrose equilibrium centrifugation. "DBT cells (3 X 106 cells) in 24-well plates were infected with 50 pl of standard JHM or VSV and 100 pl of test samples. After 60 min at 3'7" inoculum was removed and eelIs were washed once with MEM. The cells were cultured with 1 ml of MM for 13 hr at 37" and medium was harvested, centrifuged, and assayed for infectivity. b JHM virus titer. c VSV titer. Virus was labeled for 13 hr p.i. with mImidine (100 &i/ml) and partially purified by a discontinuous sucrose gradient (60,30, and 20% sucrose). Then the partially purified virus was mixed with unlabeled virus of the same passage level, prepared by precipitation with ammonium sulfate, and then this mixture was applied to a 20 to 60% continuous sucrose gradient and centrifuged at 27,000 rpm for 18 hr at 4" by Beckman SW 23.1 rotor. Then the gradient was fractionated into 25 X 0.35 ml portions. Portions of each fraction were analyzed for radioactivity (0) and PFU (0). The interference activity (A) was measured by the use of 1:6 dilution of the sample with GM and selected fractions were also examined for density (X).
