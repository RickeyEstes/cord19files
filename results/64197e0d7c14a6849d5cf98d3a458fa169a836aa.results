The serological profiles prior to ND were similar on each farm. All samples collected from breeding animals were IFA negative. All the pigs tested within one week after weaning (25 to 29 days old) were negative, but 80 to 100% of the pigs tested at eight to nine weeks old had IFA titers ranging from 1:64-1:1024. The seroprevalence in finishing pigs ranged from 25 to 50% and titers ranged from 1: 16-1:64. The results from farm 3 indicated that only nursery room 4 and the grower building contained IFA positive pigs: all the pigs tested in nursery rooms 1, 2 and 3 were IFA negative. After the repopulation of the nurseries, no IFA positive animals were detected in the nurseries on any of the farms. Samples collected from the grower building on farm 3 were also negative. All samples analyzed throughout the six month testing period were negative as well. Improvements in nursery pig performance were recorded in all 3 farms. Growth rates improved from 0.14 to 0.36 kg in farm 1 and from 0.12 to 0.34 kg in farm 2. Mortality levels averaged 0.28 and 1 .O%, respectively. Results from farm 3 indicated no change in daily growth rate (0.41 kg); however, mortality levels decreased from 4 to 2%.
