Generation of ds DNA template from synthetic oligos After 5 PCR reaction cycles, the products from paired synthetic long oligos were run on 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and viewed under UV light. The dsDNA products were clearly visualized at the size~170 bp (Figure 1 ), demonstrating a successful production of long ds DNA templates from synthetic oligos.
