One hundred-twenty five nose-throat samples (83.3%) and 25 (16.7%) BAL samples were obtained from 150 immunocompromised patients who underwent respiratory pathogen testing for symptoms of upper or lower respiratory tract infection. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Table 2 shows the performance characteristics of DFA, Simplexa™ and TAC testing for RSV, Flu A and Flu B. As expected, the overall sensitivity was significantly lower for DFA testing than for the two molecular methods, even when the 42 inadequate samples were excluded from the analysis (p = 0.0044). These 42 samples were uninterpretable by DFA due to insufficient cells derived from the respiratory sample. However, when considering results for each patho- * lung + kidney (n = 2), lung + heart (n = 2), kidney + heart (n = 1), lung + kidney + heart (n = 1). gen separately, the difference in sensitivity between DFA and molecular methods was only statistically significant for Flu A. The Simplexa™ direct test missed one RSV, one Flu A and two Flu B positive samples in comparison to the TAC assay and verification PCR. The amplification curves of these Simplexa™ results were completely flat. One sample was found strongly positive for Flu A by Simplexa™ (Ct 15), but was negative by DFA, TAC and verification testing. Unfortunately, there was no sample left to repeat Simplexa™ testing. Nevertheless, the difference in individual and overall sensitivity and specificity was not significant compared to TAC testing (p > 0.1). Two samples tested as invalid using Simplexa™ due to internal control failure. Since this could be due to presence of an inhibitor, the samples were diluted and rerun, giving valid results. For BAL samples, the sensitivity and specificity of the Simplexa™ assay was 100%. In total, DFA identified 10 samples (6.7%) with one pathogen each among 150 samples. The Simplexa™ testing found 24 (16%) and TAC 27 (18%) samples positive with one pathogen each. For nose-throat swabs only, DFA, Simplexa™ and TAC testing were positive in 5.6, 15.2 and 17.6%, respectively. For BAL samples, this was 12, 20 and 20%, respectively. An additional objective of the study was to evaluate these different methods for the detection of respiratory pathogens in terms of diagnostic yield. When considering not only Flu A, B and RSV but all results for the TAC, the method identified 93 samples with one or more respiratory pathogens (62%). TAC testing was positive for other pathogens than RSV, Flu A and B in more than half (54%) of Simplexa™ negative samples. Detailed results are shown in Figure 2 (Supplementary file). A co-infection rate of 15.3% was found by TAC (21 samples positive for 2 pathogens, 2 samples positive for 4 different pathogens). Those most frequently involved in co-infections were Coronaviruses (n = 12), HSV (n = 11), Flu A (n = 8) and CMV (n = 5). Out of 24 Simplexa™ positive samples, TAC found 7 samples positive for 2 pathogens (all positive for Flu A plus rhinovirus (n = 1), coronavirus (n = 2), HSV (n = 1), CMV (n = 1), Aspergillus species (n = 1), P. jirovecii (n = 1)). Furthermore, the estimated costs and turn-around-time of DFA, Simplexa™ and TAC testing were evaluated and are shown in Table 3 . Important to note is that these costs are valid for our laboratory, but not necessarily for another lab since this depends greatly on activity and can vary from one country to another. Remarkably, the TAC technology is the most expensive method in terms of cost per sample, but it is the least expensive in terms of cost per parameter. Even though the technical TAT of the different methods is comparable, the true timeto-result can vary greatly depending on organizational aspects. Based on our results, performing a molecular method such as the Simplexa™ or TAC method instead of DFA would be necessary to obtain an acceptable overall sensitivity, albeit at a higher cost generated in the * 42 of 150 samples tested by DFA were reported as inadequate but were counted here as DFA negative because no results were generated; seven DFA-inadequate samples were positive by Simplexa™, 9 were positive by TAC for RSV, Flu A or Flu B. Reference method was consensus of two molecular tests, and multiplex real-time PCR assay FTD Flu/HRSV (Fast-track Diagnostics) for discordant results. laboratory. Performing the TAC would increase the diagnostic yield and detection of co-infections significantly.
