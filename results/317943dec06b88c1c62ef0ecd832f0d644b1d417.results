Based on rescaled real time domestic migration data, the population outflow from the city of Wuhan differed significantly from its historical pattern in 2019. The net outflow between the day the first COVD-19 case was confirmed and when Wuhan was quarantined shows an exponential increase pattern (Figure 4) . During this period, the overall outflow was 15% more than the same period (according to Lunar Calendar) in 2019. At its peak (days before Wuhan was quarantined), over millions of individuals were leaving Wuhan on a daily basis. Two days after Wuhan was quarantined, the net outflow reserved signs and stays at a relatively low level. Both the SEIR and SEAIR models were fitted to the infection data, and SEIR model has better performance than the SEAIR model based on WAIC (Table 1) . However, the difference in WAIC between both candidate models is small, i.e., 3.12. Based on the estimated null distribution of the Δ WAIC from parametric bootstrap samples, the p-value for WAIC 3.12 Δ = is c. 0.06, slightly larger than the 5% .

Technically, the SEAIR model is not statistically significant at the 5% level; however, due to the relatively small sample size of the infection data with respect to the number of residents in Wuhan, it is inconclusive whether the disease dynamics show evidence for the SEAIR model. In the following, parameter estimates from both the SEIR and SEAIR models are presented. The SEIR model produced an R 0 with a mean of 2.12 and a 95% credible interval author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . estimated to be on average 37,115 individuals with a 95% credible interval of [31354, 43099] individuals. The cumulative number of infected individuals in Wuhan on Feb. 7, 2020 is estimated at 80,084 on average with a 95% credible interval of [63060, 98567] individuals. Due to the elevated population outflow since Jan. 1, 2020, the number of cumulative infected individuals in Wuhan is approximately linear between day 31 and day 51, then appears to stabilize afterwards, and then increases exponentially after the date Wuhan was quarantined (Figure 9 ). The predicted pattern closely resembles the trend of the cumulative number of officially confirmed cases in Wuhan with a time lag of approximately 3 days (Figure 1) . Assuming a constant time lag of 3 days, the confirmation rate of this disease has been low, i.e., less than 10%, in January 2019 but has steadily increased ever since ( Figure 10 ). On Feb. 10, 2020, the overall case confirmation rate is estimated at 23.37% on average with a 95% credible interval of [18.72%, 29.26%]. The time lag between the onset of symptoms and official confirmation of the case probably have decreased with time due to people's increased awareness of this disease and also the reduced procedural burden to confirm a case with newer versions of the case definition from the Chinese CDC. To evaluate other time lags, the estimated case confirmation rate was calculated with lags between 1 and 5 days. These time lags produced similar results on the case confirmation rate on Feb. 10, 2020 (Table 2) .
