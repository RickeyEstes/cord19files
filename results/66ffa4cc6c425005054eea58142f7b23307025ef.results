We performed metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples to detect the bacterial microbiome and virome composition of healthy one-year-old rhesus monkeys housed at the IMBCAMS (Fig. 1) . The rhesus monkeys were monitored by blood cell analysis, which is the examination of blood condition and disease by observing the number and distribution of blood cells during the course of antibiotic treatment [32] , and we found no obvious differences between the normal monkeys and those treated with antibiotics (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ).
