In BALBrc mice, BRB breakdown, assessed by the immunolocalization of extravascular albumin, was not demonstrated in uninjected or mock-injected eyes or in JHM-injected eyes for the first 5 days after inoculation of Ž . coronavirus Table 1 , Fig. 1A .

By 10 days after virus inoculation, the inflammation had subsided and the integrity of the BRB was restored. The retinal architecture appeared normal and infiltrating cells were not observed. Some focal staining for extravascular albumin was demonstrated in two of eight eyes at 20-21 days post-inoculation, one showed staining in the outer retina and one in the inner nuclear layer, but in the Ž . remaining eyes, the BRB was intact Fig. 1F . BRB breakdown was not seen in BALBrc mice that were uninjected or received mock injections of saline. Focal positivity for extravascular albumin was seen in 1 of 11 untreated CD-1 mice and 1 of 13 CD-1 mice receiving mock saline injections. VEGF staining in the retinas of coronavirus-injected BALBrc mice was negative or weak and diffuse throughout the retina and did not differ from control or mock-injected animals from 1 to 8 days after virus inoculation. At 10 days after virus inoculation, focally intense staining for VEGF was demonstrated in the outer segments of the photoreceptors in one of two mice. By 20 days, focally intense areas of VEGF positivity were evident in the nerve fiber layer, outer plexiform layer, outer nuclear layer, and Ž . the outer segments of the photoreceptors Fig. 6A . In control BALBrc mice, VEGF staining was limited to the inner retinal surface and Muller cell processes with somë Ž . weak staining in the outer plexiform layer Fig. 6B . In CD-1 mice, constitutive staining for VEGF was somewhat stronger than in BALBrc mice, but except for one of two animals that showed more intense areas of positivity in the retina and RPE 10 days after virus inoculation, the virustreated animals did not show an increase in VEGF staining Ž . compared to the controls Fig. 6C ,D . In BALBrc mice, staining for the VEGF receptor, flk-1, was negative in the retina and RPE in normal and virus-treated animals. Immunoreactivity for the other isotype of VEGF receptor, flt-1, was either absent or very weakly demonstrated in the inner plexiform layer and in the outer segments of the photoreceptors, but there was no correlation with the course of viral infection and no differ- .

In addition, staining for TGFb2 was weak or absent in the retinas of BALBrc and CD-1 mice with no differences relating to the course of the virus infection or to the presence or absence of virus.
