We first tested the effects of chloroquine on low-pathogenic (LP) A/Ck/It/9097/97 (H5N9) virus, isolated from poultry in Italy. We found that chloroquine dose-dependently inhibited the viral cytopathic effect with a 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 14.38 μM, in cells infected with the H5N9 virus at approx. 10 4 50% tissue culture infecting doses (TCID 50 )/ml (Fig. 1a) . Although this value was rather high, some of the inhibitory concentrations matched the blood concentrations reported in individuals under acute antimalarial treatment (1-15 μM) . The inhib-itory effects were confirmed using quantitative reverse transcritptase real-time PCR (qRRT-PCR) (Fig. 1b) . Ooi et al. (2006) [15] recently reported that chloroquine inhibited human H3N2 and H1N1 viruses with EC 50 values in the range of 0.84 -3.60 μM. To investigate whether the discrepancies with the inhibitory values reported above were due to the type of virus or to the different conditions and methods adopted, we tested the effects of chloroquine on replication of recent human H3N2 and H1N1 viral isolates under conditions similar to those adopted for the H5N9 avian influenza virus. Using the test of inhibition of viral cytopathogenicity, we found that chloroquine inhibited the H3N2 virus (10 4 TCID 50 /ml) with an EC 50 of 1.53 μM (Fig.1c) . Inhibition was confirmed using qRRT-PCR, both under similar conditions and at lower MOIs (Fig.1d) , thus confirming the results of Ooi et al. (the assay adopted by these authors employs a lower MOI than routinely used by our group). Results obtained with H1N1 viruses (10 4 TCID 50 /ml) showed a similar drug susceptibility for the human strain (EC 50 = 1.26 μM), in full agreement with Ooi et al. [15] , but no response to clinically achievable drug concentrations in an avian strain (IC 50 > 20 μM; data not shown). These data suggest a more pronounced inhibitory effect of chloroquine on human H3N2 and H1N1 viruses than on avian H5N9 virus replication. Since 1) chloroquine is thought to interfere with pHdependent steps of the life cycles of several viruses [9] , and 2) some of us reported different pH requirements in influenza A viruses infecting different avian species [15] , we investigated whether response of influenza viruses to chloroquine might depend on the different pH requirements of the human and avian viruses. Thus, we analysed the response of human H3N2 virus (good chloroquine responder) and avian H5N9 virus (poor chloroquine responder) to ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl; 40 mM), a lysosomotropic agent known to increase the pH of intracellular vesicles. Results showed a good response of the chloroquine-sensitive H3N2 virus to NH 4 Cl inhibition of viral cytopathogenicity (100% inhibition under conditions described above). Conversely, the lower chloroquine-sensitivity of H5N9 virus was associated with lack of response to NH 4 Cl (data not shown). This observation raised the hypothesis that cellular pH might be a critical factor for chloroquine inhibition of influenza virus. To explore this possibility, the action of chloroquine was tested on two avian H7N3 viruses whose haemagglutinins (HAs) differ in two amino acid positions (i.e. residue 261 in the HA1 subunit and residue 161 in HA2, the latter being the HA subunit mediating the fusion process), and which display different pH requirements [16] . The two viral strains showed a marked discrepancy in the response to chloroquine. In particular, A/Mallard/It/43/01 (H7N3) virus, which had been shown to be relatively more independent from pH increase than A/Ty/It/220158/02 virus [16] , was insensitive to clinically achievable chloroquine concentrations (EC 50 > 20 μM). In contrast, chloroquine exerted some inhibitory effect on A/Ty/It/220158/02 replication (EC 50 = 14.39 μM), although the response of this virus to chloroquine was lower than that of H3N2 virus. The different pH requirements of the two viruses were confirmed by the different responses to NH 4 Cl (0% inhibition for A/Mallard/It/43/01; 30% inhibition for A/Ty/It/ 220158/02). This result raises the hypothesis that chloroquine inhibits pH-dependent events involving HA. To further explore this possibility, the isoelectric point was calculated for HAs of all viruses used in the present study, and the electrostatic potential was mapped on the protein surfaces of 3D models obtained by homology Figure 1 Inhibition of H5 and H3 influenza A virus replication by CQ in MDCK cells. Cells were incubated with chloroquine (CQ) after virus inoculation or mock-infection and tested for cell viability and viral RNA copies at 24 h post-infection. A) Viability of cells infected with A/Chicken/Italy/9097/97 (H5N9) and treated with increasing concentrations of CQ as detected by colorimetric test. Assays were performed as described in the text. The dotted line indicates inhibition of uninfected cell viability, the solid line indicates inhibition of infected cell viability. Results are presented as the curves that best fit the data points. B) Results of one representative experiment showing inhibition by CQ of A/Chicken/Italy/9097/97 viral RNA production. Virus infected MDCK cells were incubated for one day in the presence of 0, 5, 10, 20 or 25 μM chloroquine. Cell supernatants were used for viral RNA extraction and subjected to a quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRRT-PCR) assay. Oseltamivir (OS; 20 nM) was used as a positive control. C and D) as in A and B), respectively, using A/Panama/2007/99-like (H3N2) virus. In D) both results obtained with inocula containing 10 4 and 10 3 TCID 50 /ml are reported. Results in B) and D) are displayed for purely representative reasons to show that there is inhibition of virus production, and cannot be compared with each other or with those in A) and C), due to the high intra-and inter-assay variability of the qRRT PCR assay (see Ref. [29] ). Fig. 2 ). Instead, no correlation was found with the isoelectric point of HA1 (P > 0.05; data not shown). Although the viruses studied here belonged to different subtypes, chloroquine-resistant viruses, independently of the subtype, showed a more marked negative surface potential of HA2 than chloroquine-sensitive viruses (Fig. 2) . Viruses with intermediate drug sensitivity showed intermediate characteristics (Fig.   2 ). We conclude that structural determinants in HA2 are associated with response of influenza A viruses to chloroquine.
