A total of 35 veterinary practices participated in this study, enrolling 831 herds with 327,686 female dairy cattle (preweaned female calves, heifers, and adult cows). Median herd size was 180 female dairy cattle (range: 20-5,241). Free-stall housing was found on 454 (54.6%) farms (this was the exclusive form of housing on 418 of these farms), while barns with individual stalls for each cow (either tie-stall or stanchion) were utilized on 355 (42.7%) farms; the remaining 2.7% of farms used some other form of housing. Use of a commercial gram-negative vaccine was reported among 337 (40.6%) herds (Endovac-Bovi, Immvac Inc., Columbia, MO; J-Vac, Merial, Duluth, GA; J-5 Bacterin, Pfizer Animal Health, New York, NY). There were 59 (7.1%) herds that had reportedly experienced at least one Salmonella case during the previous 12 mo. During the study period, fecal samples from 2,565 female dairy cattle on 412 farms were submitted for Salmonella culture because of suspicion of clinical disease. Of these, Salmonella was isolated from 576 (22.5%) samples representing 93 herds. Sixteen herds accounted for 72% of the positive samples, whereas 40 herds had only one laboratory-confirmed case of salmonellosis each. Twelve of the 40 herds had their single case diagnosed during the 2 wk immediately following herd enrollment, and those animals were not regarded as incident cases in any of the calculations. The herd-level incidence rate was 8.6 positive herds per 100 herd-years. Fecal samples were submitted from 866 preweaned female calves, 168 heifers, and 1,531 adult cows for Salmonella culture. The organism was isolated from 152 (17.6%) female calves, 7 (4.2%) heifers, and 417 (27.2%) cows. The animal-level incidence rates for preweaned female calves, heifers, and adult cows were 8.1, 0.04, and 1.8 cases per 1,000 animal-years, respectively. For herds within high-enrollment practices, the animal-level incidence rates for preweaned female calves, heifers, and adult cows were 9.9, 0.09, and 2.0 cases per 1,000 animal-years, whereas herds within low-enrollment practices had incidence rates of 7.4, 0.03, and 1.8 cases per 1,000 animal-years, respectively. The within-herd incidence rates among all positive herds ranged from 0.2 to 119.3 cases per 1,000 animal-years, with a median of 4.8 cases per 1,000 animal-years (Figure 1) . The predominant serotype was Newport, accounting for 41% of the cases, followed by Typhimurium (including the Copenhagen variant), Infantis, 4,5,12:i:-, Agona, Muenster, and Kentucky. These 7 serotypes comprised 87% of the total, and 11 other serotypes made up the remainder ( Table 1 ). The serotype most frequently isolated from calves was Typhimurium (40.1%, 61/152), whereas the primary serotype among cows was Newport (46.8%, 195/417). The most common serotypes were also widespread among farms, with Typhimurium being isolated from 36 herds and Newport from 30 herds (Table 2 ). There were 71 (76.3%) herds that had only one serotype identified during the study period, 18 (19.4%) herds had 2 serotypes, and 4 (4.3%) had 3 serotypes. A total of 395 (68.6%) isolates were MDR. Only 114 (19.8%) isolates were pan-susceptible, not displaying resistance to any of the 11 antimicrobial drugs in our panel. Resistance to individual antimicrobial agents (Table 3 ) ranged from 0% (enrofloxacin) to 79.3% of all isolates (sulfadimethoxine). Chi-squared testing revealed that the proportion of multidrug resistance was significantly higher (P = 0.006) among isolates obtained from calves (77.0%, 117/152) than among those from cows (65.2%, 272/417). Calf isolates were also more likely to be MDR than cow isolates in a logistic regression model that controlled for herd as a random effect (P = 0.01). In addition, 6 of the 7 isolates from heifers were MDR. Cattle harboring MDR isolates represented 60 (64.5%) of the Salmonella-positive herds in our study. There was considerable variation in antimicrobial resistance across serotypes (Table 4 ). For instance, 97.0% (229/236) of the Newport isolates were MDR, whereas only 2.1% (1/47) of the Infantis isolates were MDR. Chi-squared testing showed that the proportion of multidrug resistance was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) among serotypes that are also the most important human pathogens (Newport and Typhimurium; 89.0%, 308/346) than among all other serotypes (37.4%, 86/230).
