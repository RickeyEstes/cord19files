The mechanism of injury was a fall, road traffic accident, and sports injury in 33 (45.83%), 28 (38.89%), and 11 (15.28%) patients, respectively. Of the 72 patients, 19 (26.39%) presented with a pure syndesmotic disruption and 53 (73.61%) had associated malleolar fractures. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society scale score had improved significantly from 31.2 AE 4.2 preoperatively to 88.5 AE 5.3 at an average of 24 months postoperatively (p < .0043). A total of 4 superficial wound infections (5.56%) were documented postoperatively and were treated successfully with antibiotics. In addition, 3 patients (4.17%) required treatment of deep venous thrombosis and 2 (2.78%) for pulmonary embolism. Revision was undertaken as a result of implant failure in 4 ankles (5.56%). Two revisions (2.78%) were required in 2 ankles because of early weightbearing in the first 2 weeks after surgery. The early weightbearing resulted in subsidence and pull through of the small plate into the bone and was attributed to the osteoporotic nature of the patient. Additionally, this was 1 of the earliest cases we performed, and the failure could have been attributed to probable inadequacy in the technique. Both revisions were performed using the same construct to achieve anatomic reduction, and both healed completely, with no other surgery required. The third patient (1.39%) underwent revision at 5 weeks postoperatively. This syndesmotic reduction failure was attributed to failure of the threads noted at the second surgery. The revision included repair of the soft tissue envelope (including the deltoid ligament), hardware removal, and fixation with a syndesmotic screw. The fourth patient (1.39%), a 66-year-old male, underwent revision at 5 months because of persistent infection. Pain was persistent over the anterior ankle. At exploration, the construct was found to be loose, with evidence of infection, which was proved by culture and sensitivity. The symptoms resolved after removal of the construct, and further revision was not required. Postoperative 18-month ankle radiographs were available for all patients. The medial clear space had decreased significantly, from 8.2 AE 3.1 mm preoperatively to 3.5 AE 2.2 mm postoperatively (p < .0344). Likewise, the tibiofibular clear space had decreased significantly, from a mean of 8.8 AE 2.7 mm preoperatively to mean of 3.7 AE 2.2 mm at 18 months postoperatively (p < .0322).
