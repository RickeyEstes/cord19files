Nucleic Acid Standard Design. Theoretically, there are two options for how to integrate a second hydrolysis probe into the TaqMan assay: (i) in opposite orientation, i.e. downstream of the second primer, thus creating a second effective unit (primer-probe pair), the two units then each bind on one template strand; or (ii) in tandem or serial orientation, where the probes bind consecutively downstream of one of the primers. To test both options, a synthetic NA standard was designed (Fig. 1) . The standard sequence starts with a short tag, followed by a pair of primers delimiting the amplicon. The amplicon encompasses six probe-binding motifs, three located downstream of the forward primer and three located downstream of the reverse primer. The probe sequences (Fig. 2) were selected from the previously published assays so as to enable the testing of simple and LNA and MGB modified probes in various combinations, all labelled with a FAM reporter dye. So, each The 162 nucleotides-long sequence starts with a four-nucleotide tag, followed by a pair of primers (in black, underlined). The amplicon contains six probe binding motifs, three located downstream of the forward primer and three located downstream of the reverse primer. For abbreviations and further details, please refer to Fig. 2 . The designed NA standard sequence enabled nine different assays with the probes in opposite orientations to be set up: 1. simple-simple, 2. LNA-LNA, 3. MGB-MGB, and simple-LNA, simple-MGB, and LNA-MGB pairs, each in two permutations. In addition, it was possible to set up six probes in tandem orientations (simple-LNA, simple-MGB, and LNA-MGB, each in two permutations). This provided numerous testing opportunities, with only the combinations most likely to be applied being further evaluated. Evaluation of Reaction Parameters of Dual-probe TaqMan qPCR Assay. Six combinations of probes in opposite orientation: 1. simple-simple, 2. simple-MGB, 3. simple-LNA ( Fig. 3 Panels a-c) and 4. MGB-MGB, 5. LNA-LNA, and 6. LNA-MGB ( Supplementary Information 1, Fig. S1 .1, Panels a-c), were selected to test Fig. S2 .1, Panels a-c). Dilution and calibration curves covering a quantitative range of six magnitudes (from 1e2 to 1e7 NA standard copies per μl of template), were prepared to evaluate the reaction parameters. The dilution curves showed a parallel course for the particular dual-probe and the corresponding single-probe subsets in the early exponential phase of amplification. This resulted in highly similar Cq values, supported by low standard deviation (SD) across the entire dilution gradient, irrespective of the combination of the hydrolysis probe modifications or the tested orientations thereof. The close Cq values were also reflected in the parallel and overlapping calibration curves, where the corresponding assays had comparable amplification efficiencies (Fig. 4 , Panels a-c and Supplementary Information 1, Calibration (a-c) curves of the simple-simple, simple-MGB and simple-LNA dual-probe assays in opposite orientations. The curves were prepared for a dilution gradient from 1e2 to 1e7 NA standard copies per μ l of template in triplicates. The dualprobe assays are highlighted in red and the corresponding single-probe counterparts in probe-specific colours. The probe sequences and their schematic representation and colouring are shown in Figs 1 and 2. The Δ Cq curves (d-f), representing the Cq differences between the dual-probe versus the corresponding A and B assays at each concentration point, were coloured in green and grey, respectively. For the data regarding additional dual-probe assays, either in opposite or tandem orientations, please refer to Supplementary Information 1, Figure S1 .2 and Supplementary Information 2, Figure S2 Fig. S1.2, Panel f), which, though small, is still higher than the 0.1 threshold. However, the observed deviation was attributed to experimental imperfections and did not contradict the general findings of the study. Taken together, the calibration curve and Δ Cq slope data clearly proved that the second identically labelled probe did not significantly influence the TaqMan qPCR assay. The dual-probe assays stably showed highly similar parameters, in comparison with the single-probe counterparts, independently of the probe modifications, orientations or combinations tested.
