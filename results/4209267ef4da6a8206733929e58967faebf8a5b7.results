An outline of the results section is shown in Figure 1 . This section first summarises relevant aspects of global environmental change. It then discusses physical, social and "eco-social" thresholds and effects, including the relationship between current energy prices and the global recession. It then discusses global change, including how climate change has increased food prices (see Figure 2 ). Rising food prices impair nutrition, harm immunity and thus increase vulnerability to infectious diseases and some chronic diseases. The paper then analyses, critically, one of the most important recent analyses of EIDs, that by Jones et al. [7] , focussing especially its causal classification ( Figure 3 ). The paper then becomes more speculative, discussing the characteristics of infectious diseases that have the potential to have a high burden of disease, including a discussion of influenza, Nipah virus and HIV. It challenges the conventional focus on exotic fevers as the major risk of EIDs (Figure 4 ), and also discusses the ecological characteristics which may influence the evolution of highly pathogenic avian and human influenza ( Figure 5 ). The paper then challenges more conventional wisdomthe current state of global per capita food supply (Figures 6, 7) . The paper then concludes with an appeal for greater systemic thinking to reduce the potential of GEC to create a milieu for EIDs with a high burden of disease, using two scenarios, one pessimistic ( Figure 8 ) and one optimistic ( Figure 9 ). In the course of this analysis, the paper uses several datasets: FAO food price data ( Figure 2
