All 5 patients with severe disease, but only 2 (33%) of 6 with mild disease (p = 0.06 by Fisher exact test), had PRNT 90 antibody titers >40 at the 1-year follow-up ( Figure, panel A). PRNT 90 antibody titers of patients C and F, who had acute-phase antibody titers of >320, declined >4-fold 1 year later. Patients D, G, K, and N who had acute phase peak antibody titers in the range of 80-160 only had <2fold declines in titer. Patients C, D, F, G, I, K, and N (the 5 patients with severe disease and 2 of the 6 with mild disease who had PRNT 90 antibody titers of >40 in their acute-phase serum samples [collected 21-50 days after disease onset]) continued to have detectable antibodies by PRNT 90 (titer >1:40), ppNT (titer >1:40), microneutralization assay (titer >1:20), and S1 ELISA (ratio >1.1) 1 year after illness onset (Table; Figure, panel B). MERS antibody titers waned during the first 6 months after disease onset, especially in patients who had had high antibody titers. The waning of antibody titers between 6 months and 1 year after disease onset was less steep. At 1 year after infection, the 4 patients who had mild disease (or who did not require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation) all had negative results by microneutralization assay and S1 ELISA, but 1 was positive by ppNT (titer of 10) and 2 by PRNT 90 (titer 1:10) (Table) . Although designated as having mild disease, all of these patients, with 1 exception (patient P), had chest infiltrates on x-ray, indicating lung parenchymal pathology. The kinetics of antibody production seen with the PRNT 90 , ppNT, microneutralization test, and S1 ELISA were comparable (Table) , suggesting that any of these tests could be used for detection of MERS-CoV antibodies in patients with past infection. One year after infection, all patients who had antibody titers of >20 by PRNT 90 also had antibodies detectable by ppNT, microneutralization assay, and S1 ELISA. One patient (L) with a marginal PRNT 90 titer of 1:10 was not positive by ppNT, microneutralization assay, or ELISA. At 1 year after infection, the correlation coefficients were 0.89 between PRNT 90 and ppNT titers, 0.94 between PRNT 90 and microneutralization assay titers, and 0.96 between PRNT 90 and S1 ELISA titers. The virus we used for serologic testing was the prototype MERS-CoV EMC clade A virus, and the virus that patients were exposed to (and that caused the outbreak in South Korea) was a clade B virus. To confirm that the neutralizing antibody titers against the clade A and B viruses were not significantly different, we tested 10 paired serum samples (from 5 MERS-CoV patients who had various levels of microneutralization antibody responses to EMC) by microneutralization assay using the clade A virus and a clade B virus from the outbreak in South Korea. The titers were similar (within a 2-fold dilution), confirming that the neutralizing epitopes of MERS-CoV are antigenically conserved (online Technical Appendix Table 2 ). The peak viral loads in sputum did not correlate with PRNT 90 antibody titers or S1 ELISA OD ratios at the acute phase of illness, at ≈6 months after illness, or at ≈12 months after illness (online Technical Appendix Table 3 ). However, we found strong positive correlations between duration of virus detection and antibody titers (as measured by the PRNT 90 and S1 ELISA) at these time points (online Technical Appendix Table 4 ). We defined the duration of virus detection as the day from symptom onset to negative PCR conversion. The median duration of virus shedding was 19 days (interquartile range 16.5-27.5 days). Only 2 of the patients (D and F) received corticosteroid therapy, and both had robust antibody responses (Table) . However, because of the small number of patients given this treatment, evaluating its quality with a statistical analysis was not possible.
