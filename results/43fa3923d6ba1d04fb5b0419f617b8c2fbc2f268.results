Participants were 25 DSNOs and assistant DSNOs including 11 (44%) males and 14 (56%) females. Their mean age was 39.7 years (SD, 7.8 years) with ages ranging from 25 to 57 years. They had been employed for an average of 3.6 years (SD, 2.4 years). Most (88%) of the participants were married. Only about a third has had relevant working experience prior to this job. The mean pretest score was 34.0% (SD, 2.1), which increased to 56.3% (SD, 2.3) at posttest. The mean paired difference in score between post-and pretest of 22.3% (SD, 10.4) was statistically significant p 00.000. There was also a statistically significant difference between the proportion of participants who passed the posttest but failed the pretest [16 (69.6%)] and the proportion who passed the pretest but failed the posttest [0 (0%)]; p 00.000. The mean score of male participants was higher at the pretest (35.6% vs. 32.0%) while the females performed better at the posttest (57.3% vs. 55.6%), although this difference was not statistically significant. The ages of participants and the number of years of employment were also not statistically associated with their performance in the pre-and posttests.  ESSENCE created visualizations on average 89% faster than previous methods, requiring 43% fewer computational steps. For the production of reports ESSENCE was 86% faster, requiring only 4.55 minutes compared to 27.83. For tasks relating to PH responses, initiating ad hoc ED surveillance was 96% faster through ESSENCE without comparing resource savings during follow-up monitoring. However, conducting QI reviews was faster using previous systems with modules designed for such tasks. ESSENCE also reduced the need for staff training, as one system was used for most tasks instead of five (Excel, ArcGIS, Access, SAS/SPSS and Merlin). Two heatmaps are provided as examples of our visualization approach (see Fig. 1 ). Since applying this visualization to our syndromic data, PHSKC has identified several data quality errors that are likely to have gone undetected or been slow to detect otherwise, including out of range ages and sudden data drop-offs. Consequently, we have adopted the methodology to other nonsyndromic data sources, including notifiable condition reporting to the health department. In 2008, the PHSKC system (which searches through admission and discharge diagnoses) identified 180 patients hospitalized with influenza, compared with 161 patients identified by CHARS (which is based on discharge diagnoses exclusively). Thus far, PHSKC has reviewed 46 charts from 8 hospitals to validate system accuracy; review of data from the remaining hospital is pending. We identified 3 hospitals that were transmitting incorrect data to PHSKC and requested correction and resubmission of historical data from these hospitals. Preliminary analysis revealed that 35 of the 180 influenza hospitalizations captured by the PHSKC system (19%) were missed by CHARS; however, 15 of these patients (43%) were admitted with presumptive diagnoses of influenza but were determined not to have influenza by the time of discharge. Also, 28 of 161 influenza hospitalizations (17%) captured by CHARS were missed by the PHSKC system; however, we had no means of reverse-identifying CHARS records and, therefore, could not evaluate the validity of these data by chart review. A platform of data investigations utilizing the 'Wisdom of the Crowd' focusing on biosurveillances aspects as follows: 1. PharmacovigilanceÁbrand monitoring and safety alerts: Crowd trial provides a dashboard of parameters on medications, their side effect profile, interactions and drug's comparative advantage. 2. Social Health at a glance: Temporal overview of prevalence and statistics of the most engaging health issue discussed across the social web, represented by aggregation of the reports (citations) generated by the e-patients (Table 1 ). 3. Health trends detected by harnessing the social web: This public feedback exists in real-time, large scale and enables ongoing observational studies by tapping into the health reports involving a massive sample size (Fig. 1) . President's Day and Labor Day were associated with the highest 4-year average increases (12% each). Decreases in the 4-year average only occurred around two of the holidays, Independence Day ((7%) and Memorial Day ( (5%). Age groups 0Á4 and 5Á 17 had their largest 4-year average spikes around Labor Day (' 24% among 0Á4 and '30% among 5Á17), right after the beginning of classes as well as around President's Day (12% and 13%). The 18Á64 age group had its largest 4-year average increases during Christmas (19%) and Thanksgivings Days (15%). As for the 65' age group, Christmas (15%) and President's Day (14%) showed the largest increases. The span was much wider when analyzing year-specific holidays, from ' 40% after Martin Luther King Day in 2010 to (17% after Independence Day on the same year. Factors other than holidays could have also influenced the increases in ED visitors, such as the beginning of classes in August of each year and the H1N1 influenza epidemic in 2009. This research hinges on the comparison of the holiday period to a 28-day background. Future tracking of VDG should also be based on comparing the current holiday period to its mean of previous years to control for seasonal or day-specific effects. The availability of only 4 years of data prevented us from removing the seasonal effect in this research. ILI surveillance source: Analysis of the relationships between the signals for PAN, ED and CC are heavily influenced by a strong day of the week effect in the PAN data. Considering all of the data, including periods of high and low ILI activity, the correlation between ED and PAN shows a stronger relationship when the ED signal lags the PAN by 1 day (r 00.653 vs. r 0 0.617). There is a less clear relationship between ED and CC with the strongest correlation occurring when CC lags ED by 2 days (r 00.669 vs. r 00.659). The relationship between CC and PAN is unclear. These relationships are also all valid when just considering the period of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, but interestingly not the last strong seasonal influenza in 2008. For the 2008 season, for which we do not have ED data, the signal for CC clearly lags the signal for PAN with a peak correlation at a lag of 6 days (r00.561 vs. r00.413). ILI and climate: There are significant negative correlations between all three signals and daily temperature, e.g., CC and Tmin (r0(0.265, df 02004, p B 0.0001), but not precipitation, e.g., CC (r 0(0.011) when considering all data. There are no clear relationships between temperature or precipitation and CC or PAN during the 2008 seasonal outbreak, but there is a clear negative correlation between temperature and CC, PAN and ED during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, e.g., ED and Tmin (r0(0.366, df 0 119, pB 0.001). There was no clear correlation with precipitation. Zoonotic reports: There are some very strong correlations between the signals, such as the correlation between daily minimum temperature and patients seeking treatment for insect bites (r 00.602, df0821, pB0.0001), with a less strong correlation between precipitation and insect bites peaking with a bite lag of 24 days (r00.163, pB0.0001). Not as expected is the correlation between animal bites and Tmin (r 00.178, pB0.001). In 2010, there were very small numbers (nB5) of both ED visits and PCC calls for bath salts. In 2011, ED visits and PCC calls related to bath salts increased dramatically. ED visits for bath salts totaled 166 and PCC calls totaled 480 through July 2011. A time-series chart of these data, analyzed by month, as shown in figure 1 . Pearson correlation analysis showed a strong relationship between ED visits and PCC calls for bath salts (r 00.83, p 00.02). Dengue generated over a million Google search queries every month. Some queries showed that the user was looking for more information about the disease, while others were looking for symptoms or treatments. Model-fitted 'expected' epidemic curves matched official case counts 'observed' epidemic curves quite well for all 5 countries in most countries (Fig. 1) , with validation correlations ranging from 0.82 to 0.99. Dengue queries were not as influenced by mass panic-induced searching. Initial findings from fusion using severity concepts in CAPER data yielded sharp alerting reduction from pure algorithmic methods, with a timeliness loss of 1 day in 2 known outbreaks, no days in 4 others. The alert reduction was dramatic in datasets from small facilities, typically reducing the alert rate from 20 per year to below 5. In larger facilities, the reduction was less dramatic but often over 50%. Time series chosen from the laboratory test and GCN groupings were tested using additional known outbreaks. Results of fusing all algorithmic output streams will be presented. The full set of unfiltered ESSENCE alerts at levels of high and moderate significance, applied for 8 syndrome groupings to all medical centers, CBOCs and other facilities sending outpatient and emergency department data, was on average 410 per day (539 per week day). Table 1 illustrates the sharp drop in alerting using filters developed to present only sets of records selected for investigation at each level. Additional results will show the sensitivity of the resultant hierarchical system to documented outbreaks at the various levels. Alcohol-related ED visits for college-age patients have increased since 2003. When analyzed with respect to holidays and days of week, college-age specific trends begin to emerge: college-aged ED visits differ from the general population by day of week (Fig. 1) . Additionally, college age groups can be distinguished from other ages on certain days of the year. Most notably, early summer and early fall show these age-specific increases, and this age group drives some holiday spikes, such as New Year's Day/ Eve. Our methodology was evaluated by means of a numerical case study. We constructed artificial clusters using a map consisting of 203 hexagonal cells arranged in a regular grid, 15 of which are structural zeros. An example can be seen in Fig. 1 . Gray regions indicate the ''true'' cluster while the )'s indicate structural zeros. We compare the Poisson, ZIP and ZIP'EM scans in terms of power, sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). The Scan-ZIP and Scan-ZIP'EM methods presented systematically and significantly better results when compared to the Scan-Poisson, as shown in Table 1 for the given cluster of Fig. 1 . More examples and a real data application will also be presented. Daily symptoms can report into database, with time-spatial information. Statistic methods (e.g., CUSUM) were built in server (Fig. 1) . The real-time data, with cloud-computing, can be calculated online. Also the system can gain a better feedback and sharing timely information among decision makers, health workers and citizens. User-interface (UI) of system, including main home page with Map-API, reporting entrance and latest news, was user-friendly. Using the 2009 pandemic influenza, results of evaluation are shown (Fig. 2) . Except the pattern of 'ILI' (Fig. 2C ), other curves, using our easily understood definitions, show similar increase trend in week 34 with the gold standard (NNRS) ( Fig. 2A) , the first outbreak signal NNRS had detected. With CUSUM, case numbers did increase in week 34Á35 and fell out thresholds in week 35Á38, except 'Fever'Cough'. A project charter including project mission, proposed solution, guiding principles, project scope, critical risk factors, communication plan and project team was approved in 2008. Regular project team meetings were conducted, and functional requirements and software specification documents were completed in 2009. A diagram of data flow is shown in Fig. 1. An incident screen with create, update and search utilities was designed and completed in May 2011. The incident screen collects incident, disease-and event/facility-specific data, case definition and coordinator/investigator information. Web services were applied to create basic reports (Fig. 2) , including case counts by case status, county, age group and a de-identified line list extracting from the Communicable Disease Electronic Surveillance System (CDESS). User acceptance testing was completed in July and webinar trainings to all users were completed in September 2011. The content and structure of food and waterborne outbreak investigation forms have been developed. The prototype of user interface for entering forms currently is under development. Pandemic influenza (pH1N1) was the first health condition targeted for surveillance in 2009. Through an iterative process, a combination of ICD-9 codes and measured fever at the time of visit yielded the highest sensitivity and specificity using the case definition for influenza-like illness (ILI) found in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) ILInet surveillance system. Formal evaluation of ILI surveillance using review of local medical records (electronic and paper) in one region of the country found that the system had a sensitivity of 96.4% and specificity of 97.8%. IHS is expanding EHR surveillance to capture cases of chlamydia, syphilis, HIV, invasive pneumococcal disease, measles, Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib), meningococcal disease, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and tuberculosis. In 2008, the number of deaths for which P&I was listed as the underlying cause in the national mortality statistics was 8,665; of these, 6,795 (78%) were reported through the NDCS. The weekly surveillance-based P&I mortality estimates had a consistently strong correlation with those obtained from mortality statistics data (correlation coefficient 0.85, p B0.0001). Eighty seven percent of the reports were received within 7 days after death (median 2 days). During the 2010Á11 influenza season, an increase in mortality was observed in January 2011, with the highest weekly number of P&I deaths to be 421 (week 5 of 2011) (Fig. 1) . From 2010 through 2011, consecutive alarms were generated for week 26Á27, 31Á32 and 36Á39 of 2010, and week 2Á15 of 2011 ( Fig. 1) . Implementation of the electronic surveillance system was feasible after initial staff training, purchasing necessary equipments for communication and standardizing data formats. The protocol for data sending, receiving and analyzing were stable. Data transfer procedures were simple and acceptable according to the school and CCAF staff's feedback. Data quality was monitored by occasional onsite school visits by the investigators. A total of 430 students (47.4% female) from 17 preschools have absenteeism data recorded since November 27, 2010. From March 1, 2011 onward, a total of 1437 students (47.6% female) from 47 preschools (including 30 public preschools) have absenteeism data recorded. The mean weekly overall absenteeism rate from November 27, 2010, to July 12, 2011, was 23.2% (maximum 32.4%, minimum 13.6%, standard deviation 4.5%), whereas the mean weekly absenteeism rate due to sickness was 2.3% (maximum 4.0%, minimum 0.7%, standard deviation 1.0%). We are currently seeking reference disease surveillance data to evaluate the accuracy of this system and negotiating with the village chiefs to set up disease surveillance data dissemination points for risk communication with the villagers. Global Tweets regarding a disease outbreak include concern from family or friends, local happenings and reiteration of news reports. Fig. 1 illustrates example Tweets and distribution of Twitter Updates in this study. The HL test yielded p-values of Â 1 and 0.185 (updates and mentions models). Large p-values indicate that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected and the model fits the expected distribution of values well, in this case, better for the updates model. Both models output a low probability (mentions: 0.04, updates: 6e-11) of an outbreak in Puerto Rico within 100 days, and there was no actual outbreak. One hundred forty-six true laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were identified (Fig. 1 ). By including records with a flu diagnosis or a positive flu lab result (excluding records with a negative flu lab), the sensitivity of the HIE was 90% and the PPV was 94%. In comparison, the sensitivity of NC reporting was 91%. HIE cases were detected a median of 5 days after admission versus 2 days through the NC system. Data for influenza hospitalizations from the HIE did not differ signifi-cantly from data collected through the NC system with regard to sex, age, pregnancy status and mortality. The time series of influenza-related hospital admissions from the HIE and NC system were highly correlated (r 00.99). As September 5, 2011, 24 people have participated in the survey, with 14 completing all the questions. Although providing personal information was optional, half the respondents supplied biographical details. Most of the respondents were based in North America, typically from state or county public health departments, although three were based outside North America (one from Taiwan and two from the UK NHS). Apart from one assistant professor, all the respondents had either 'public health', 'epidemiologist' or 'syndromic surveillance' in their job titles. Strong disagreement was expressed by a minority of respondents on 7 of the 279 ESSO concepts (see Table 1 ). Only 2 concepts*'hoarseness' (respiratory syndrome) and 'concussion' (neurological syndrome)*elicited disagreement (or strong disagreement) with ESSO syndrome definitions among a majority of respondents. We are currently developing a strategy to 'flag' concepts with high levels of disagreement in order to better inform ESSO users. We analyze weekly emergency room discharges for acute upper respiratory infections, influenza, acute bronchitis, asthma and pneumonia in 2009. The data are available by county for the 46 counties of South Carolina. The use of a shared component model accounting for correlation across diseases provides a better overall fit. In addition, the use of the multivariate SCPO increases the statistical power for detection of outbreaks. The following before/after contingency Table 1 illustrates the results for two syndromes: one common, influenza-like illness (ILI), and one rarer syndrome, neurological (Neuro). Additional results will show effects of the CC noise removal on alerting using datasets with documented outbreaks. We will report the principle observations from the conference. All participants were keenly aware of the complexity of developing an InGBSV, passionate about and committed to pursuing biosurveillance and supportive of the initial focus on application of existing information technology tools. It was largely agreed that: Á Scientific understanding of pathogen and pathogen-humanenvironment interaction is the foundation for integrated InGBSV; Á Emerging technology being developed by the R&D community for basic and applied life science advancement provides tremendous support for InGBSV; Á InGBSV can be 'jump started' with initial focus on information science and technology applications and integration; Á Challenges were recognized as multidimensional, but opportunities for developing a GBSV exist and are invigorated by international health security policies; Á Formulating unconventional partnerships and establishing an advanced concept demonstration is an effective near-term path forward. Data base already contained administrative data about all the soldiers present in Djibouti; and in case of illness symptoms in cause with date of onset and rapid antigenic tests results. Fiftyone cases of tonsillitis were declared during 4 days on 646 soldiers (attack rate 08%), with 18 positive streptotests on 25 performed (72%) (Fig. 2) . Epidemic curve had only one peak as if it was one source of contamination. A retrospective cohort study found one meal at risk (RR 012.8, IC95% 0[7.9Á20.6]), prepared by a local food provider. Performance is evaluated by the following criteria: average detection delay and probability of correct detection in space, given that an outbreak really exists. We present simulations with artificial data and applications for thyroid cancer in New Mexico and hanseniasis in children in the Brazilian Amazon. We found a nonsignificant increase in vaccinations following the phone campaign, with fewer than 1000 estimated additional vaccinations (results not shown). The association between weather conditions and vaccination was strong and significant when controlling for variation between MVC (Table 1) . We found no evidence of day-of-week effect. The MCPHD sister's agency is the area hospital that accepts medically underserved patients. With this access to the patient system, the electronic medical records of 21 people meeting the search criteria and seeking care at this emergency department between June 1, 2011, and July 29, 2011 were reviewed. An extended time period was reviewed to see if there were obvious differences in the counts of patients or terminology used in the chief complaint once the heat wave was upon the city. Five (24%) sought care in June 2011, 16 (76%) in July. Fifty percent of those seeking care for heat-related issues were seen in a 2-day period in July. Six people (29%) developed symptoms while at work. Work-related tasks included roofing, painting, working in metal tanks and driving trucks without air conditioning. Two homeless persons (10%) sought care during the 2-day time frame when half of the cases were identified as well as four of the six who developed symptoms while at work. Alcohol and drugs may have been a contributing factor for three (14%) of those seeking care. Nine individuals (43%) were treated for medical conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections or pneumonia. From March 17 through April 11, 2011, the BioSense Team created daily reports for the CDC's Emergency Operation Center and DoD counterparts. Reports included time series graphs for each of the 10 health conditions. Fig. 1 shows an example of a time series for diarrhea and total visits in the 20 DoD facilities. During this surveillance period, no clusters or radiation exposure coded visits were detected in Japan-based DoD facilities. In the United States, no ED-visit clusters associated with KI intoxication were found in nonfederal US EDs. A comparison of 7,592,039 raw messages and 16,365 enhanced messages revealed a number of differences with respect to data completeness. Data field completeness within the ELR messages varied from 0.01% to 84.6% across the two samples. Completeness was generally higher in the enhanced message sample as shown in Table 1 . A FITS was created in accordance with the project charter, timeline, user specifications and budget and included but was not limited to the following technologies: CentOS, Ruby and Excel. An innovative feature of the FITS system is the live lookup of national drug codes (NDC) hosted on the FDA's website, which autopopulates the FITS vaccination database with up-to-date information (2) . FITS allows flu immunization records to be accurately captured at the county level, resolving the dilemma created by the PREP amendment. County health professionals were invited to a system users training to orient them with the system, record management and downloading/ uploading of data. After an initial rollout of FITS at the county level, it is expected to be promoted statewide to increase accurate reporting of immunization administration. Numerical experiments are made showing that the proportions of rejections of the null hypothesis differ noticeably, by employing the usual critical value, compared with using the data-driven critical values. It is also shown that the computational cost of estimating the data-driven critical value may be reduced through the use of a simple interpolation. Our method was tested on several different simulated maps partitioned into different numbers of components (ranging from 2 to 4). The relative risks for each component were chosen as 3 sigma, (3 sigma and 0 sigma, corresponding respectively to high-, low-and neutral-risk spots. We evaluate the power of detection and matching (a measure of overlap between the real and detected partitions) for each set of 1000 Monte Carlo replications. The average power varies from 0.686 to 0.803, and matching varies from 0.566 to 0.850 for the several sets of simulations. We also applied the method on a case study of dengue fever in a small Brazilian town in 2010 (1). Fig. 1 shows the MST linking the 57 cases (small circles) distributed among 3929 controls. The optimal partition consists of three components: two high-risk regions (red and blue) and a low-risk region (white). We conducted numerical simulations showing that GDScan has good power of detection, sensitivity and positive predicted value. An application is shown for the dataset of Chagas' disease cases in the population at risk of puerperal women in Minas Gerais state, Brazil, in 2006 (5). Fig. 1 shows the nondominated sets of solutions obtained by GDScan for neighborhood sizes of 5, 20, 40 and 90. As an application, we find clusters of dengue fever for Lassance City, in southeast Brazil, 2010 (5). Fig. 1 shows the three significant clusters found, displayed as the three green patches. Between September 7 and December 23, 2009, statewide overall school absenteeism ranged from 0.0% to 29.3% and statewide ILI-related absenteeism ranged from 0.0% to 14.2%, both of which peaked the week of November 1Á7, 2009. The observed peak of school absenteeism was consistent with data observed in other ILI surveillance systems such as over-the-counter sales of cough and cold medications and visits to emergency departments ( Fig. 2) . At the peek of absenteeism, 346 of 479 (72%) of all elementary, middle and high schools in New Hampshire were reporting into the system. NH DHHS identified 103 outbreaks using the school absenteeism reporting system; a state public health nurse investigated each outbreak. Timeliness of outbreak detections were within 24 hours due to daily reporting. GFT correlated with both number of positive influenza tests as seen in Figure 1 (adult ED r 00.876, pediatric ED r 00.718) and number of ED patients presenting with ILI (adult ED r00.885, pediatric ED r 00.652). Pediatric but not adult crowding measures such as total ED volume (r 00.649) and left without being seen (r 00.641) also had good correlation with GFT. Adult crowding measures for low acuity patients such as waiting room time (r00.421) and length of stay in discharged patients (r00.548) had moderate correlation with GFT. Since mid-2008, NKIDHD receives electronic disease reports and surveillance support for what is now the 18 most prevalent disease conditions in the community. SEMC (6 facilities) has realized 75%Á90% reduction in public health reporting effort as a result of the capabilities provided by HealthSIS. Since mid-2009, LFCHD receives syndromic surveillance data from ambulance runs, initially to support preparations for the 2010 Alltech-FEI World Equestrian Games; LFCHD began receiving electronic disease reports for 9 prevalent disease conditions in mid-2010 from CBH and UKMC. Since late 2009, LMPHW receives electronic disease reports for 5 prevalent disease conditions from BHE and notifications of same from JHSMH; in 2011, NHC began participating in the disease-reporting process. Data are presented for January 1, 2011, through July 31, 2011 (212 total days). Between the ED chief complaint data, the poison control data, the OTC medication sales data and the pharmaceutical transaction data, there are a total of 50 data points on any given day in the Maryland ESSENCE system. This amounts to a total of 10,600 possible data points that can be in the ESSENCE system during this time frame. Using the data tracking application, OP&R has managed to acquire and consume 10,527 data points or 99.31% of all possible data points for this time period. The poison control data are complete for this time frame, as is the pharmaceutical transaction data, and one of the major pharmacy chain's data. The other major pharmacy chain whose data are not complete is only missing 2 data points (99.10% complete). Twenty-five of the 46 EDs have transferred 100% of the possible data points to the ESSENCE system. All other EDs contributing data to the ESSENCE system are at least 95.75% complete. Considering outbreak intensity, we show that sites chosen by our approach outperform the sites used by the IDPH. In other words, we can provide a more accurate representation of disease burden during an influenza season. However, our approach does not provide a substantial difference in the detection of the start, peak and end of the influenza season. In addition, when using the noise values generated by the EM algorithm to analyze the minimal number of sites needed to estimate the timing of the influenza season, our results were highly influenced by both the number of different ICD-9 codes considered and the number of cases considered. Of the 894 outbreaks documenting year of occurrence, 72% occurred between 2000 and 2010. More than 90% of outbreaks occurred in the northern hemisphere and 45% took place during the winter. In general, we found the number of primary cases and persons at risk was significantly lower in outbreaks related to food and waterborne transmission as well as foodservice and healthcare settings. The attack rates were significantly higher in outbreaks related to food, water and those that occurred in the winter. Attack rates were also lower in healthcare-related outbreaks, perhaps on account of proper infection control practices and active surveillance by healthcare facilities to limit the spread of disease. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that higher attack rates were significantly associated with foodservice (b 0 14.70, p00.02) and winter outbreaks (b09.81, p0B0.01). A combination of strains was most common among food and waterborne outbreaks. Waterborne outbreaks were also significantly associated with GI strains (odds ratio [OR] 00.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 00.03Á0.41 where the odds of an outbreak being caused by a GII strain are less than the odds of the outbreak being caused by a GI strain), while healthcarerelated (OR 040.42, 95% CI 02.09Á783.15 where the odds of the outbreak being caused by a GII strain are greater than the odds of the outbreak being caused by a GI strain) and winter outbreaks (OR 05.56, 95% CI 01.97Á15.69) were associated with GII strains (Table 1) . We conducted evaluations using the MIMIC II data (5). We used ECG and respiratory rate as input vitals in an attempt to predict heart failure alarms. The results shown in Table 1 were obtained per-patient, by subsampling, using data from the patients held out of the training set. The proposed approach brings the AUC metric (area under the receiver operating characteristic diagram) to 0.66 on average, the patient-specific model offers an improvement, and the inclusion of treatment information provides further benefits. The average within-cluster distance for the nine census regions is 5205 units. Ignoring geography, we found that our nine largest clusters held 85 of the cities (87.6% of the total cities observed) and maintained an average within-cluster distance of 4918 units. This amounted to a 5.5% reduction in the within-cluster distance. The largest of these clusters held 33 cities from all but one census region and had a within-cluster distance of 4295 units, meaning that its within-cluster distance was 17.5% smaller than that of the mean within-cluster distance of the nine census regions, the largest of which only held 17 cities. The first output of the project was the adoption of the definition of human and animal syndromic surveillance. The initial results from the inventory of syndromic surveillance systems and the geographical distribution of identified systems will be presented. As a result of the literature review and the responses to the brief questionnaire for human systems, 19 active systems, 11 pilot or planned systems and 4 systems for past mass gathering events since 2000 (e.g., Olympic games) have been identified to date. For veterinary systems, only 5 systems were identified by the literature review, whereas 16 active, 7 pilot and 2 expired systems have been identified by the brief questionnaires. The first 4-day site-visit took place in the United Kingdom (Birmingham and Glasgow) in June 2011, where there are several systems based on different data sources: emergency departments, general practitioners (Q-surveillance, Piper and SISRS), phone calls to help lines (NHS Direct, NHS24), out-ofhours primary care and pharmacy prescription data. By December 2011, four site visits have been conducted. The synthesis of the first visited systems, including their main characteristics and the experiences and lessons learned through those visits, will be presented. The projects's final guidelines will provide scientific and technical guidance and tools for the development and implementation of syndromic surveillance systems for both human and animal health, according to the needs and expectations of the different EU member states taking into consideration the different data sources available and the different aims of syndromic surveillance systems. An additional outcome of the project is to build a sustainable network of organizations, which can provide support and advice on tasks related to syndromic surveillance: management, partnership with data providers and users, statistical methods, definitions of syndromes and dissemination. For this, the triple S project will develop links with different projects in the USA and Canada. For organizations planning to start or reestablish a syndromic surveillance system in their own country, this network could help raise awareness of opportunities and of pros and cons of the anticipated syndromic surveillance system. Based on the descriptive analysis, a linear yearly trend, the days of the week, the period of school holidays, a seasonal effect and the unusual days (day-off) have a marked effect on the daily fluctuations of ED visits. The pattern of the daily visits during the summer periods has been modeled using a quadratic function. The day-of-week effect has been differentiated by seasonal period of the year. The final model based on the combination of variables explains 78% of the daily variations of the ED attendances and shows a good predictive performance on 2010. The performance of each authority method, measured as threads recommended by each model and evaluated over all messages from January 2003 to March 2009 (Table 1) . The information graphics are to be assembled and annotated as an annual reference resource, Cuyahoga County Hospital Emergency Department Service Utilization Profile (HEDSUP). This output of localized biosurveillance data analysis summarizes the facility admissions, catchment demographics and symptoms using various visualizations, which aim to be understandable by an audience of nonstatistical experts. Facility specific sections will be made available to hospital infection control practitioners and emergency department managers to evaluate patterns of service utilization and to improve data quality. Local health departments are considered to be the primary users through daily epidemiology and surveillance requiring decision support during disease outbreak investigation and response activities across all hospital emergency departments within a health jurisdiction. Fifty-three different patients have been on the alert list since activation. Only one notification has occurred in the 13 months of activation. On December 1, 2010, the TB program reported that a provider had seen one of the suspect cases and the alert prompted the provider to order a chest x-ray and notify the MCPHD staff. A review of a hospital patient management system revealed that 12 other patients were seen in the emergency departments while on active alert lists. Some patients were seen more than once while on the list. Some cases showed that the chest x-rays were performed as requested but the patient records did not indicate if the procedure was prompted due to the alert or because the patient presented with symptoms of TB. A review of the process is underway to better understand why these encounters did not provide a notification to the MCPHD. Several MCPHD staff work in local homeless shelters daily looking for the suspect patients. If a staff member prompts an individual to go to the ED, that encounter is not recorded in the MCPHD Patient Management System. Therefore, the provider may ignore the TB alert on these patients since the patient was already suspected for TB. In some instances, the patients were seen at the MCPHD TB clinic within a couple of days of being seen at the hospital ED. Again, the records do not indicate if the patient was prompted to go to the TB clinic. Interestingly, no new TB cases among this population were reported for the month of August. Future attempts at locating patients: Since many of the identified cases have known psychiatric issues, outreach workers in the TB program are hoping to partner with the mental health community to reach some of the suspect cases. MCPHD is working with a local mental health clinic to create a similar alert in their patient management system. Also, RI may help develop another alert that includes contacts of cases, rather than suspect patients in hopes of completing the first initial screening for that segment of the population. Wavelet power spectral analysis of the inpatient and outpatient time series identified statistically significant oscillatory modes across different years and at all periodic scales examined* indication of the endemic nature of dengue in PR. Crossspectral analysis of the two time series revealed three distinct areas of significant coherence as seen in Fig. 1 . At the 1-year period, the two time series have strong association during 2004Ápresent, with waves of outpatient cases lagging behind those of inpatient cases by an average lag time of 7 days (not shown). At the 1.5-year period, the two time series cohere during 1999Á2003, indicating that dengue outbreaks did not occur yearly in the VHA population prior to 2004. At the 3.5Á4-year period, they cohere across all years in the data, an indication of a multiyear interepidemic period. The prototype was populated with real world data and used to visualize a gastrointestinal disease outbreak caused by cryptosporidium and respiratory virus outbreaks including influenza and RSV. The prototype was well received by regional epidemiologist practicing in the state and local health departments of Utah. We performed the process outlined above for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), because its similarity to influenza presents the largest challenge of all of the diseases in GUAR-DIAN's current knowledge base. Even with this challenge, the area under the ROC curve was 0.929 and was optimized to 0.962 through hill-climbing. Gaussian decomposition showed good fidelity using 5 risk categories (Fig. 1) . Females represented 53.4% of the sample. The percent of positive influenza cases based on PCR results was 9.2% (i.e., 245 cases). The majority of positive influenza cases (55.9%) occurred below 50 years of age. Positive influenza patients with fever, cough or sore throat were 207 (84.5%), 218 (89%) and 56 (22.9%), respectively. Based on x 2 test, fever, sore throat, cough, myalgias or body aches, chills or rigors, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion or sinusitis or nasal symptoms, dyspnea, upper respiratory infection symptoms or viral illness, rash and age groups were statistically significant. Apart from fever and cough, myalgias and rhinorrhea were significant associated symptoms of influenza based on multivariate analysis (Table 1) . Literature scan yielded 34 articles with 4265 cases and 90 unique signs, symptoms and confirmatory features (frequency data068 and continuous data022) for SARS. After combining the data and assigning the assumptions, there were 18 representative, 63 conditionally independent and 9 confirmatory features. Applying the BTA methodology for SARS, the positive predicted value, negative predicted value, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy based on 10-fold cross-validation were 55.7%, 94.6%, 74.8%, 88.1% and 85.8%, respectively. An ROC curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.929. The main features contributing toward identifying the positive SARS cases were fever, chills/rigors, nonproductive cough, fatigue/ malaise/lethargy and myalgias. The identified features were in agreement with clinicians' judgment. With each implementation of a new form of data collection and more advanced analysis, the response rate increased (see Fig. 1 ). In addition, the time involved for surveillance activities decreased for DHSS staff since increased automation led to fewer errors and a reduced need for follow up. We found that both Infrastructure as a Service and Software as a Service cloud computing service models can help reduce barriers to effective use of sydromic surveillance methods. Easy provision of many computers allowed us to speed up the computational times by an order of magnitude. The creation of integrated software services to perform disease surveillance is the easiest way to deliver complex functionality. Ice storm: Piloted the use of 'keyword' surveillance in our jurisdiction. Local hospitals were asked to include the word 'weather' in the chief complaint of patients presenting to the ED. The major trauma hospital in the Austin area implemented keyword surveillance within 4 hours of the request. Keyword surveillance provided insight into the impact of injuries during the ice storm. This approach was essentially resource neutral, both for the health department and the hospitals. The RODS system was also used to track chief complaints of hyperthermia and exposure. Data were reported twice a day during the ice event. Drought/heat: This is an ongoing surveillance effort. We will present RODS data and EMS data from May through September 2011 which describe the pattern of heat-related illness over time. The pattern of heat-related illness diverged over time from the heat index. These data were reported to emergency management daily during the most extreme heat index days and weekly for the rest of the summer. Wildfires/smoke incident: We were asked to provide an estimate of the impact of air quality from the wildfires. We examined ED chief complaint data, OTC medication sales and EMS data. These data are still being analyzed. On May 23, a surge in EHEC infections was reported at hospitals mainly in northern Germany; the outbreak was unusual in that it caused atypically severe symptoms in adult females. By May 26, state health authorities had identified over 600 EHEC cases, including 214 severe cases with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and confirmed the causative agent as a highly virulent HUS-associated EHEC 41 strain belonging to serotype O104:H4. Faced with a rapidly growing number of cases, health authorities notified the EU of a potential public health emergency of international concern and implemented new surveillance systems (2) . Media reports suggested that the public health infrastructure was strained to a breaking point, as hospitals in northern Germany issued appeals for blood donations and transferred cases to hospitals in neighboring states. These problems were compounded by the lack of an effective HUS treatment, causing health officials to resort to an emergency experimental treatment instead. As the outbreak continued to spread, up to 130 cases primarily associated with travel were detected in 13 other European countries (3). The EU responded by implementing a new case definition twice over the course of 1 month, to allow for effective surveillance and treatment of cases (3, 4) . By June 29, an investigation launched by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) had determined that contaminated fenugreek seeds imported from Egypt were the most probable source of the outbreak (3, 5) . Previous efforts to locate the source of infection had failed, resulting in strained trade relations and major economic losses among EU member states (3). On July 26, Germany's Robert Koch Institute (RKI) declared the outbreak over and reported a cumulative total of 4321 EHEC cases, including 852 HUS cases and 52 fatalities (6) . PHSS epidemiologists or analysts from 87.5% (35 out of 40) of the Distribute-contributing health authorities completed the survey. Within the respondent group, 9 cover local jurisdictions, 25 state jurisdictions, and one was from CDC BioSense. Combined, the 35 agencies captured EHR data from 1344 ED. Survey results revealed that 97% of participants receive ED patient CC data in free-text (Fig. 1) . ED triage staff presumably capture these data in an EHR, based on a patient's presenting condition as an open-ended, unstructured memo. Some survey participants also reported receiving ED CC in coded formats, either as ICD-9 codes (34%) or as text from a drop-down menu (20%). A majority of survey respondents (74%) reported having used free-text CC to monitor public health in over 17 different emergencies over the past 2-3 years. Most frequently, free-text CC was used to monitor the impact of H1N1, heat waves, infectious disease outbreaks, and winter storms. The dashboards are organized by tabs; current tabs include Overview (Fig. 1) , Hot Topics, Heat, Animals/Vectors, Hurricane, Foodborne, PHE Weekly Report summary and users comments on signals and events investigations. The tabs will change in subject in the fall and winter months, e.g., including a Flu tab. The average number of LHD logins into the NC DETECT Web application has not increased significantly since the release of the dashboards (Fig. 2) . Fourteen outbreak weeks were identified to evaluate the detection ability of the six methods. The The SPs did not vary much across six methods while the SE of the PO method was higher than the rest. The PPV ranged from 11% to 63%, and the NPV did not vary greatly. The total numbers of signals generated from the PO and NBC methods were higher than the rest. PHIM-WG includes physician, epidemiology, program management, policy and planning, IT, quality improvement and project management representatives. IM, composed of the integration of program, processes, policy and technology, was the selected framework. An initial informatics lexicon was developed. Using CBSC, identified strategic destinations were aligned with PHAB-ES objectives, which were then adapted and aligned with the IM framework. An IM vision and strategy map, including strategic objectives and destinations, were produced. Public health IM desired state, objectives, and activities were linked to the PHAB-ES within four major community perspectives; health status, implementation, process and learning, and assets. PHIM-WG is working to produce a more-fully developed strategy and implementation plan, including engaging internal and external partners, defining associated performance metrics to measure progress to the desired state and aligning with NYSDOH strategic planning efforts. Two hundred and thirty-eight ED visits met the meningitis syndrome definition; however, there was no substantial increase ( Fig. 1 ). Within the same zip code catchment area, there were no ED visitors with mention of homelessness or shelter residence in their CC. There was no overall increase in the total number of homeless coroner deaths. Two of 45 deaths took place in shelters*one death in January from 'cardiomyopathy' that occurred at the homeless shelter of interest, and another nonspecific shelter death in March from 'strep pneumonia'. Forty-one 911 ambulance calls were made from the homeless shelter associated with the confirmed meningitis cases. While there was no overall increase in call volume, one call matched a confirmed case fatality. The RiskScape presents a timely, clinically rich picture of the health of large populations using EHR data that is refreshed nightly. Examples of RiskScape views and report options are shown in Fig. 1 and 2. Fig. 1 maps the rate of nutrition referrals by zip code amongst women with gestational diabetes. Fig. 2 stratifies these results by age and race/ethnicity within the greater Boston area and compares them to statewide averages. ILI rates from public outpatient clinics and the estimated influenza level from the multivariate model had the highest correlations with laboratory isolation data before the 2009 pandemic (r00.57 and 0.58, respectively) but the former was interrupted during the pandemic period due to activation of the DFC. The estimated influenza level from the multivariate model captured the influenza level well during the pandemic period (r00.76), significantly better than the best surveillance data in the same period (p-value 00.03). The inferred influenza activity index is able to reflect the influenza activity (Fig. 1) . During the time period that the CDC Emergency Operations Center (EOC) was activated for this response (March 11 to April 18), there were 404 calls nationally regarding the Japan radiological incident. Three hundred and forty (84%) were calls requesting information about KI, iodide/iodine containing products or radiation associated with the Japan radiological incident. The remaining 64 calls (16%) were potential incidentrelated exposure calls. Of these, KI (n020), other iodidecontaining products (n017) and radiation (n 015) were reported most frequently. The number of information calls peaked on March 16 (n054), and the number of exposure calls peaked on March 17 (n09). Thirty-four (53%) of exposure calls were confirmed KI and iodide/iodine containing product exposures, 23 (36%) were calls regarding incident-related exposures, which were unable to be confirmed, and 7 (11%) were determined to be nonexposures. The  We present a robust framework for using highly detailed simulations to provide the foundation for evaluating and designing a surveillance system's ability to detect outbreaks. A small demonstration study shows that detection rates varied from 17% to 80% across the different surveillance systems. Increased coverage did not linearly improve detection probability for all surveillance systems. Surveillance systems with uniform coverage of the population did not perform better than one based on a real-world system with nonuniform coverage. Higher coverage improved the timeliness of detection but, for most cases, by only 1 or 2 days on average. Additional results can be found online (http://ndssl.vbi.vt.edu/insilicoSurveillance/). In this case, FLR detected the mentioned FDA alerts and related clinical manifestations prior to the official alert by 'listening' to the 'crowd trial', in that case, the Singulair users.  Findings by ONC S&I LRI PH WG demonstrated that there are significant gaps in development of (a) functional requirements for PH-R and (b) interoperable standards-based specifications that support PH-R electronic data exchange from clinical care to public health and within public health. In order to strengthen PH-R, the S&I PH-R activity defined the following priorities: (1) Compile the full picture of all aspects of PH reporting; (2) Review and define public health and patient safety business processes and functional requirements and develop Á HIT interoperability specifications; (3) Align public health objectives in MU Stage 1 with the needs of other public health domains and programs that were not explicitly mentioned in MU Stages 1; (4) Develop a roadmap for aligning public health, patient safety and clinical objectives in MU with regards to HIT standards, development, harmonization, testing and certification; (5) Develop a roadmap for deploying standard-based certified HIT applications in PH agencies and for patient safety reporting. Compared to paper-based records, EHR-based tracking reduced time and manpower requirements by the automation of data acquisition from each practice and improved capabilities for determining ILI incidence by reporting a patient denominator along with the number of ILI cases. Proper training and selecting the right practice played a large role in that success. Some initial challenges included providers overlooking the symptomology associated with ILI in the CDC guidelines, which led to failing to identify ILI cases and unfamiliarity with the electronic template. This was especially an issue in a larger practice that had a large number of rotating staff. The results of PCR testing for influenza subtypes evolved from almost exclusively H1N1 in 2009Á2010 to the cocirculation of H1N1, seasonal H3 and influenza B in 2010Á2011. Luminex testing was only performed in 2010Á2011, and we found that rhinovirus and MPV were most common and were present over most of the season. Other viruses showed peaks at certain times of the year. The prototype website operated for a pilot period of 1 month starting April 11h, 2011. A total of 473 unique occurrences worldwide were captured, of which 29% are located in Mexico (138/478) and 52% in Colombia (244/473). Early research for this project has already shown the need to redesign aspects of the ESSENCE system to support the additional meaningful use data fields. These changes involved modifications to the database design and the utilization of a more flexible configuration system. We fully expect additional modifications to be made to better support the cloud environment. These findings and the results of the public health evaluation of the system will be presented. The results of this process have pointed out a number of inconsistencies with general assumed knowledge and actual truth related to many standards. The HL7 standard is just one example of a standard that is misunderstood in many aspects. Many believe that HL7 is a transport protocol, others believe that is a file format, others believe that it defines specific locations for data elements and still others believe that HL7 'set the language, structure and data types required for seamless integration from one system to another' (1). Each of these beliefs has nuggets of truth in them but do not explain the full story of HL7. Those that believe an HL7 message from one hospital can be fully read and understood in the exact same way as a second hospital may also be mistaken. Even though this is the hope of a standard, to have a standards-based tool that can be used over and over in different situations, real world experience tells us a different story about this so-called standard. Similarly, each topic has beliefs that are partially true, but by not understanding the whole truth, the standards can lead to complications. Public health user needs and preferences have strongly influenced and prioritized the growth of ESSENCE, sometimes in unforeseen directions. Conversely, the evolving domain of syndromic and disease surveillance has broadened the situational awareness, perspectives and sometimes the responsibilities of public health monitors. The ESSENCE system has provided those monitors with the tools to help detect and investigate public health situations in their communities. Alerts for influenza were observed on multiple consecutive days during the fall wave of the H1N1 pandemic as well as during the peak of the 2010Á2011 influenza season. Peaks in weekly influenza hospitalizations appeared to correlate well temporally between the VA and CDC's AHDRA data (Fig. 1) . From October 1, 2009 to July 31, 2011 more than 12,500 CDI codes were identified among nearly 1.13 million hospitalizations with a calculated mean CDI rate of 11.1 per 1000 discharges (Fig. 2) . The CDI rate for FY10 was 78/100,000 population. Malawi has 29 district hospital laboratories of which only 12 (41%) are currently able to perform culture procedures. Only four (14%) of the laboratories performing culture procedures are able to perform drug sensitivity cultures, which should inform prescription practices. There is lack of demand and reliance on drug sensitivity tests by the prescribing clinician. Clinicians sited the lack of laboratory capacity and also the delays that go with culturing procedures. Inadequate laboratory performance of drug sensitivity tests coupled with syndromic clinical diagnosis are the culprits of antimicrobial resistance and treatment access in Malawi. There is no laboratory-based data forming sensitivity profiles of most antibiotics used to treat common infectious diseases. For the years 1972Á1988 and 1996Á2008, annual influenza epidemics needed an average of 7.9 weeks to spread across the country and lasted an average of 22 weeks. Seasons where H3N2 was the dominant influenza subtype (N013) were, on average, significantly shorter (20.3 vs. 26.7 weeks p00.0049) and spread quicker (time to death: 10.3 weeks vs. 13.8 weeks, p 00.0053) than seasons with H1N1 as the dominant subtype (N03). There was also a significant difference in the average time to national spread between H3N2-dominant seasons and H1N1-dominant seasons (6.1 vs. 13 weeks, p 00.0253) ( Table 1) . Moreover, an average seasonal traveling wave of influenza began in the East North Central region then took two routes: (1) eastward then southward along the Atlantic coast and (2) westward to the Pacific coast. Disease awareness questionnaires, educational materials and further details of our study design will be presented at the conference. The anticipated increase in knowledge about risk practices associated with the transmission of brucellosis from animals in at-risk populations should lead to a reduction in human cases of brucellosis in the intervention group, compared to control groups. The literature demonstrates the many diverse, yet successful, syndromic surveillance efforts being implemented at the national and regional levels. Existing systems utilize a variety of data sources, data transmission techniques and analysis methodologies, ranging from low-tech, highly manual systems to automated, electronic systems. Frequently, syndromic surveillance systems are a coordinated effort among several partners, supplement existing systems, incorporate both specific and nonspecific disease detection and are used in conjunction with laboratory-based surveillance. Data analysis confirms that, following the ordinance, the proportion of arrests involving out of town patrons to in town patrons was significantly reduced (Fisher's exact test, p 5 0.0001). Similar results were obtained for only under 21 arrests (Fisher's exact test, p0 0.0095) and over 21 arrests (Fisher's exact test, p 0 0.0058), suggesting that the campus bars were equally attractive to all age groups prior to the ordinance. This effort has been successful at building a regional surveillance system. In the 2010, three pilot hospital sites were enrolled to conduct severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance. These patients were tested for viral, bacterial and important fungal infections that cause respiratory disease. Fig. 1 includes results of the 74 hospitalized SARI patients who were enrolled in the 2010Á2011 influenza season. The SARI patients were 54% (n040) male and had a median age of was 62.5 years (range, 0Á 87 years). The expansion of this surveillance system requires additional sentinel hospital-sites and additional syndromes. A syndrome of acute diarrheal illness will be the focus of surveillance at one new pilot sentinel site, with potential to expand in the future. One hundred twenty-four indicators were identified that measured 16 elements that defined 7 domains of country-specific opportunities and challenges: political will, stakeholder involvement, culture, public health functionality, healthcare, laboratory and communication infrastructure. Thirty (24%) of the 124 indicators were chosen from the reporting requirements of the 2005 International Health Regulations. In the pilot, we found various positive and negative implementation characteristics in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan. In our evaluation, no single system was found to meet the needs of all the surveillance requirements. Mobile technology standards and guidelines were searched for, with none being found. An open-source, end-to-end software solution that is readily available and able to meet the needs of health surveillance was not identified, although several systems were deemed promising and have garnered significant use. Key features of an end-to-end mobile surveillance system would include the following: . easily adoptable; . open source or public domain; . able to support multiple mobile platforms; . form design environment; . enumeration, case selection and case management; . multilingual and Unicode functionality; . client-server deployment (local and cloud based); . SMS enabled; . rational database system data storage; . data extraction to statistical file formats; . embedded analysis and report capability; . GIS/GPS enabled, with global mapping capability; . geospatial analytic capability; . data visualization. As the rate of recovery following treatment (t) increases relative to screening and treatment costs, the DU's best response curve transitions from an inverted-U pattern to one that is monotonically decreasing (Fig. 1) . Additionally, the equilibrium screening value is monotonically decreasing in the number of DUs (Fig. 2) . Here the best response curves intersect the line of equal screening values. We found that forecasting states using less than 10 states as covariates is better than using more or the state itself as covariate (ARIMA), as shown in Fig. 1 . An example of out of sample prediction is shown in Fig. 2 , for New York City. We also found that the 10 most frequent states in models with two covariates are California, Virginia, Florida, New York City (treated as state), Alabama, Ohio, Tennessee, North Carolina, New Hampshire and New Mexico. The first 5 are covariates of 40 states, and the amount increases to 50 when adding the later. From the time period specified, media reported on a human plague outbreak in northern Peru where all 3 clinical forms of plague were identified (septicemic, pneumonic and bubonic); in one area, bubonic plague was registered for the first time in over a decade while pneumonic plague was reported for the first time ever in the country, according to an official (2) . The first human case of bubonic plague was reported in April, followed by a 2-month reporting lull from May to July. Subsequently, new media information revealed ongoing human plague cases, including nosocomial pneumonic infections which had spread from one patient to medical staff and one relative, as well as a severe lack of biosafety personal protective and laboratory equipment (3) . Retrospective review of Argus reports later identified 3 key factors that limited the effectiveness of disease management in the region: (1) a lack of government leadership and accountability, (2) poor sanitation leading to an inability to decrease the vector population and (3) an inadequate regional healthcare infrastructure (4) . Media sources recognized discrepancies in medical information provided by health officials and the medical community, and as the outbreak continued, protests erupted over poor sanitary conditions and insufficient medical resources as observed by healthcare workers. In August, the Minister of Health (MOH) declared that the outbreak had been 'controlled'; however, the media continued to report human plague cases and noted concern regarding the potential danger of plague spreading to urban markets. Travel restrictions were applied and reports later speculated that the World Health Organization (WHO) would close ports and issue a national quarantine if plague extended into coastal export areas (5, 6) . Further, officials declared a latent risk of disease transmission to bordering countries. At the end of the study reporting timeframe, media continued to identify the confirmation of new human bubonic plague cases, the implementation of vector control efforts, and the ongoing risk to residents despite attempted disease management efforts. We compared the three semantic scan methods to the standard, prodrome-based spatial scan using synthetic disease outbreaks injected into real-world emergency department data from Allegheny County, PA. We first considered 55 different outbreak types, corresponding to all distinct ICD-9 codes with at least 10 cases, which were mapped to one of the existing prodromes. For each outbreak type, we generated spatially localized injects with chief complaints sampled from the cases with that ICD-9 code (Fig. 1) . The static, dynamic and incremental methods required an average of 7.7, 7.1 and 6.9 days, respectively, to detect and were able to precisely characterize the outbreak based on the detected topic (e.g., top keywords for ICD-9 code 569.3 were 'rectal', 'bleed', and 'bleeding'). The prodrome method achieved more timely detection (5.0 days to detect) but with much less precise characterization (e.g., 'hemorrhagic' for ICD-9 code 569.3). Next, we considered both randomly selected, unmapped ICD-9 codes and synthetically generated unprecedented events, such as an outbreak that makes the patient's nose turn green. The prodrome method required 10.9 days to detect these outbreaks, while the semantic scan was able to achieve much faster detection. For example, for the green nose outbreak, the static, dynamic and incremental methods detected in 6.4, 5.3 and 5.6 days, respectively. The dynamic and incremental methods correctly identified the emerging topic (keywords 'green', 'nose', 'nasal', etc.), while the static method did not, since the outbreak did not correspond to any of the topics learned from historical data. As a case study, we use a recent measles outbreak in Harare, Zimbabwe, as our basis. At outbreak onset, we assume 20,000 susceptible individuals ( Â1% of total population in accordance with vaccination coverage rates) and 20 infected individuals. Priors for outbreak parameters are vague but informative, e.g., a 95% interval for infectiousness is 4 to 11 days. Relative to the base-case scenario where immediate sampling is performed on both newly infected and recovered individuals, the following results are observed. Eliminating recovered sampling increases average costs by 5%, a one-period delay between transitions and control action increases costs 6%, a two-period delay increases costs 14% and eliminating all sampling increases costs by 34%. When allowing increased sampling as a possible outbreak control measure, the optimal decision was to utilize sampling of infected and recovered individuals about 20% of the time. Evacuation site surveillance started in Fukushima prefecture on March 25, 2011, and in Miyagi prefecture on May 8, 2011. About 400 sites in Miyagi prefecture were covered until the end of May. When the surveillance found an aberration, the public health center investigated the site and started taking an action for control. We found less variation between jurisdictions in weekly ratios using the common ILI definition (mean 2%; range 1.5Á3.1%) than locally preferred syndromes (mean 4.9%; range 1.8-8.4%), and influenza epidemic signal-to-noise ratios were comparable for most jurisdictions during the study period. The findings suggest that the common syndrome improves comparability without an overall cost in terms of epidemic signal discrimination. All jurisdictions submitting AGE data to Distribute presented seasonal trends with predominant winter peaks. Across the pilot jurisdictions, seasonal peaks from 2003/04 to 2005/06 occurred during MarÁApr, while 2006/07 to 2009/10 seasonal trends peaked predominantly in DecÁFeb. Overall, epidemic timing was similar across age groups; however, the shifting pattern in impact after the 2006/07 season presented a greater drop among young children. (Fig. 1) . Gossamer uses code developed at UW and additional open source components. Most components are distributed under the '3-clause BSD license', permitting free use, modification and redistribution. Automated modules include (1) HL7 message receipt, processing and storage, (2) compilation of line listing data from HL7 Minimum Biosurveillance Data Set (MBDS) and Meaningful use (under development) messages, (3) classification of cases into syndromes and compilation of syndrome data into indicators, (4) receipt, storage, aggregation and management of indicator data, and (5) analysis, visualization and reporting (AVR) of indicator data. Modules may be deployed locally or in the EC2 cloud and communicated using standard protocols to let deployment strategies be mixed across the system to support both sharing and shared use of components, as well as load balancing and optimization. This presentation will talk about the goals of the open source system and give underlying details of the technical implementation using virtual machines. As an example, we will discuss an application of the Gossamer system instance developed to let a state public health agency disseminate summarized laboratory test results for multiple (14) respiratory viruses (see Fig. 1 ). The expanded data model has now been used to support the ILI standardization effort through comparison of newly contributed 'ILI-S' syndrome data. Distribute was also used to develop a site to allow Washington State DoH to share specific syndromic data with British Columbia during the 2010 Olympics. An instance of Gossamer demonstrated sharing laboratory results for 14 viral isolates between two states. In addition to community-driven comparisons of ILI and GI syndromes, the data model has been applied at the design level to two additional syndrome types for ad hoc data sharing: alcohol intoxicationrelated visits and heat exposure-related ED visits. While built around similar data models, each system has strengths and weaknesses for ad hoc sharing of data. Advantages of the Distribute system for sharing additional data include making use of the existing trust and community that is based around the system, which reduces many barriers to sharing data and facilitates adding more community members. In addition, data feeds and administrative details are already in place. Disadvantages of using Distribute include limitations in the common data transmission format, limitations in stratifiers and limitations in compartmentalization. The implementation of the very similar data model in Gossamer is able to address some of these issues by various strategies including virtualization and modular architecture, while extending the flexibility which supports new applications of the data collection, quality and analysis methods developed for use with influenza syndromes in Disribute. Considerable variability was seen between sites in terms of timeliness and completion, and completion rates did not necessarily correlate with accuracy. In our talk, we will present results comparing the quality of data between sites (sites will be unidentified), in particular comparisons between timeliness, completion and accuracy. We will also examine the types of observed relationships between timeliness, completeness and accuracy exhibited across the sites. The purpose of this talk is to facilitate discussion between Distribute participants around data quality and the role that the ISDS can play in ensuring data quality. We will show prototypes of two features that could be hosted on the Distribute restricted site. The first feature would allow each site to compare the quality of their data (identified only to them, with site linked to the id of the user) with the remaining sites (each unidentified). The second feature would allow each site to see time series of their data together with prediction intervals for the accuracy of the ILI ratio for recent dates where the data are incomplete (see Fig. 1 ). In our talk, we will present these visualizations and demonstrate how they can be used to discover several common and some unusual data quality patterns and issues. We will also discuss the underlying architecture that allows us to reconstruct prior views and discuss the importance of examining data quality in terms of prior data views. We analyzed 8925 patient encounter records entered into the EMR between January 18 and February 22, 2010. Of those records, 4612 (51.8%) were coded as female, 3995 (44.8%) as male and 303 (3.4%) were not specified. Additionally, 1444 (16.2%) of the encounters were coded as less than 6 years old, 1638 (18.3%) were coded as 6Á18 years old, 4352 (48.8%) were coded as 19Á49 years old, 1004 (11.2%) were coded as 50Á65 years old, 283 (3.2%) were coded as more than 65 years old and 204 (2.3%) were not specified. Mean age was 27.1 (SD 019.1) years with a minimum of 1 day and a maximum of 100 years. Additionally, 6575 (75.1%) records were coded as nonurgent, 1889 (21.6%) as urgent and 295 (3.3%) as emergent. Daily surveillance of the records resulted in the identification many of suspected or confirmed symptom and disease occurrences. They included 8 cases of chicken pox/herpes zoster, 46 cases of conjunctivitis, 1 case of hemorrhagic fever, 23 guns shots wounds, 15 cases of malaria, 1 case of measles, 3 cases of meningitis, 2 cases of mumps, 53 cases of acariasis (including scabies), 1 case of typhus, 3 cases of tetanus, 3 cases of tuberculosis and 7 cases of pneumonia. We also detected 714 instances of fever and 550 instances of diarrhea. With clustering, the HIV incidence due to IDU and sexual intercourse were mostly identical in the 1994Á1999 and 2000Á 2004 periods. However, three spatial clusters of sexually acquired HIV emerged in the 2005Á2009 period (RR 0 3.44, p 0 0.0005; RR 0 10.60, p0 0.011; RR 0 2.18, p 0 0.0265), which did not correspond to an increased RR of IDU-acquired HIV (see Fig. 1 ). Proportion of Radas, simultaneously included in the clusters of both types of HIV transmission, decreased from 64.58% in 2000Á2004 to 48.33% in 2005Á2009. To test the effectiveness of the method, we compared the number of Radas where HIV cases were registered due to sexual transmission only and were not detected due to IDU. In the 2005Á2009 period, we observed an increase in the number of Radas reporting sexually acquired HIV cases but not IDUacquired HIV cases. We developed an informative packet of materials for a variety of audiences that is both appealing and concise. Oregon's hospitals come in all shapes and sizes, each with unique approval processes for engaging in data sharing, prioritization of voluntary public health projects, coordination of Meaningful Use efforts and IT support. Therefore, we expect that the breadth and depth of the marketing materials will be a critical component to successful recruitment of hospitals. OPC data are available within the ESSENCE application to OHA syndromic surveillance staff. Sending OPC data into ESSENCE allows OHA staff to monitor timely OPC data in an automated, routine manner. When alerts are generated within the ESSENCE system, they are first assessed by syndromic surveillance staff. Those that require follow-up trigger a call between OHA and OPC. Oregon is the first state to use the NPDS web service to upload poison center data into ESSENCE. The average proportion of encounters for ILI at urgent care centers was 0.298 in comparison with 0.125 for ED visits during the 2009 Fall Novel H1N1 influenza outbreak. Graphical trends in illness were comparable. Initial search results indicate many studies that can be classified as Type 2 evidence along the continuum of emerging, promising, effective and evidence-based smart home interventions. Initial findings are that Type 3 evidence is lacking and public health policy makers are underrepresented. Over the study period, a total of 4510 ED visits were classified as BRIs (0.22%). The percentage of BRI visits increased from 0.18% in 2007 to 0.27% in 2010. The majority of injuries (69%) occurred between May and September (Fig. 1) and likely corresponds to increased bicycling activity during those months. Seventy-five percent of persons presenting with BRIs were male and 60% reported race/ethnicity as white. Persons aged 18Á 25 years represented 28% of visits and those aged 6Á17 years accounted for 17%. Boston residents accounted for 52% of BRI visits; 15% were from bordering communities. One Boston neighborhood with the highest BRI rate by patient residence also has a large college student population. Throughout the entire study period (2007Á2010), nearly one quarter (1082) of BRI visits were associated with fractures and dislocations; whereas less than 10% of visits were for sprains or strain injuries. Head injuries were associated with 84 (1.9%) of BRI visits. In 2010, 149 (11%) of the 1411 BRI visits resulted in admission, most commonly for fractures and dislocations. Twenty-two percent were among individuals aged between 50 and 59 years; 21% were among persons aged 18Á24 years. Fiftyfour percent of all BRI admissions were associated with fractures and dislocations. Thirty-one (2.2%) BRI visits in 2010 were associated with head injuries; of which 11 (35%) were admitted for care. For BRI visits involving falls, 8% were admitted versus 17% for BRI visits associated with a motor vehicle. Review of Animal Bite Keyword Report data revealed several additional case definition inclusion and exclusion keywords. This knowledge has led to continued development of keyword reports. The Animal Bite ICD-9-CM Code Report indicated a total of 33,294 ED visits for animal bite from 2008 to 2010. For each year, the highest proportion of ICD-9-CMÁcoded animal bite ED visits to total ED visits were for 5Á9 year olds (Fig. 1) . Across all 3 years, males had a slightly higher proportion of animal bite-coded ED visits to total ED visits (0.28%) compared to females (0.23%). Ninety-seven events of interest (of 2365 events captured in MLI syndromes) were identified: 32 rash, 58 febrile rash, 1 prodrome, 12 case definition and 8 measles/testing (14 were categorized in ! 1 syndrome). Eighty-four events of interest were ruled out based on chart findings. Thirteen events of high suspicion for measles required further investigation. Twelve events were ruled out based on negative measles IgM results, evidence indicating other diseases (fifth disease and Kawasaki syndrome), vaccine reaction or inaccurate documentation of clinical symptoms. One event was found to be confirmed by positive measles IgM (Fig. 1) . We studied approximately 14,000 visits during the discrete year and 32,000 visits during concomitant years. Viral results were unavailable for approximately 75% of respiratory visits and multiple imputation was used to impute values. During the discrete year, sensitivity and specificity were 0.49 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.30, 0.68) and 0.72 (CI: 0.70, 0.74) respectively, for the ''Febrile'' definition and 0.29 (CI: 0.13, 0.54) and 0.89 (CI: 0.87, 0.90) for the ''ILI'' definition. ILI sensitivity was 2.05 (CI: 1.08, 3.91) times greater and its false positive fraction 44% (CI: 37%, 49%) lower in concomitant years compared to the discrete year. Greater sensitivity and false positive fractions (1-specificity) tended to be produced by the febrile definitions than by the ILI definitions; and by definitions derived from CC or diagnoses as compared to those from CC alone. The false positive fraction of all syndrome definitions was higher in younger children compared to older children. Generally, jurisdictions with the highest populations also had the highest number of ILI ED visits and the highest numbers of antiviral prescription medication transactions. These results did not vary based on type of antiviral medication. There was one exception to the general trend: County 14 had the lowest percent of ILI ED visits (0.45%) but the highest percentage of antiviral prescription medication transactions (1.26%). Spatial analysis showed that the highest number of ILI ED visits were in the National Capital Region (NCR) and Central Maryland while the highest numbers of antiviral prescription medications were in the NCR Region. Together with the staff of the Sardjito Hospital (teaching hospital of the GMU SM), local D/MHOs and the GMU MS Department of Public Health, the CHSM developed Standard Operating Procedures for S-R core and support functions of MNCH priority diseases (e.g., postpartum bleeding, preeclampsia/eclampsia, LBW and pneumonia) as well as of other major diseases (e.g., malaria, TB, DM and hypertension). The training sessions and consultations were effectively executed in the target districts and municipalities. Based on the performance of the electronic bulletins, however, only one DHO has a functioning S-R support unit. Efficacy of the S-R Systems strengthening approach used by the CHSM could not be evaluated by way of on-the-spot interviews, observation and review of S-R records/ reports due to financial constraints. The web survey identified 20/38 (53%) organizations which use at least one syndromic surveillance system; key informant interviews identified another 2 organizations, for a total of 22/38 (58%) syndromic surveillance 'users'. Mirroring routine surveillance, traditional surveillance systems, specifically laboratory and reportable disease data (iPHIS) and school absenteeism data were the most frequently used sources during the pandemic (Fig. 1) . Laboratory data were considered the most useful data source for monitoring the epidemiology (71% of organizations perceived it as 'essential') and informing decision making (76%), while emergency department screening data were considered the most useful syndromic surveillance source (52% and 70%). Syndromic data were found to support two specific public health actions taken during the pandemic: influenza assessment centers and communications, including recommendations to the public. Informants felt that syndromic data provided confidence to decide whether and when to open/close influenza assessment centers and when/what to communicate to the public. Nonsyndromic users utilized stakeholder consultations and traditional surveillance data to support these decisions. Syndromic surveillance did not appear to have a role in supporting decisions around immunization clinics, school closures or recommendations to health care professionals; rather vaccine availability and ministerial guidance acted as drivers for these decisions. The two instances where H1N1 met inclusion criteria both resulted in average numbers of daily events significantly lower than similar periods before, after and parallel to the time period in question (Fig. 1) . See Table 1 for more results. On average, the greatest number of daily events occurs on Thursdays, least on Sundays. The outbreaks of cholera in Haiti and E. coli in Germany showed no significant crowdout effect at both global and regional levels. A reduction in the average events per day during the December holiday period was not significant. Of the 52 case-seeking reports posted on Epi-X during calendar year 2010, all were posted with the intent of seeking cases of illness caused by infectious disease. One report was broad based and also sought cases of illness caused by injury. These reports were categorized by type of infectious agent, depending upon commonality of symptoms and routes of transmission. Epi-X contributors posted case-seeking reports for 19 individual confirmed or suspected infectious agents in 2010. The top four infectious agents for which case-seeking reports were posted on Epi-X in 2010 were Salmonella (10 reports), Legionella (9), hepatitis A virus (4) and measles virus (4) . Other infectious agents included Influenza, Bordetella, Cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli and Listeria. Three reports were posted for which the infectious agent was unknown. The 52 reports were contributed by 44 contributors. Epi-X staff were able to elicit feedback from contributors for 30 reports. In regards to usability, the system was considered practical for 28 of the 30 reports for which feedback was elicited. In regards to case-seeking usefulness, 2 of the 30 case-seeking reports for which feedback was elicited were considered not successful; eight were considered moderately successful, and 15 were considered fully successful. For five reports, the contributor was unable to rank the success. Of the 30 respondents, 28 stated their intent to use Epi-X for this purpose in the future. The SNF were found for only 15% of reported HAV from Health Directorate in 2009. All the selected reporting sites had commitment in reporting. The sensitivity of reporting from reporting sites to health directorate was 96%; nevertheless, 38% of the reporting sites reported zero cases. HAV surveillance in Mafraq was evaluated upon application of CDC criteria for evaluation of surveillance system (as demonstrated in Table 1 ). We analyzed a 5-week subset of the data (September 11, 2010 through October 26, 2010) consisting of 3 million record intervals from 165,000 users. We display intrastate travel by aggregating each user's consecutive records within each state and plotting only transitions between states (Fig. 1) . The denser edges represent more frequent transitions, illustrating the pattern of travel on a national scale. We also constructed a heat map representation of Manhattan (Fig. 2) by aggregating users' check-ins with 500 m resolution. A larger bubble represents a denser set of records in that geographic area. By linking each individual users' consecutive location records together, we computed the statistical distribution of time interval and distance traveled between records. About half of the checkins are less than 6 hr and no more than 1km apart from each other. Both the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the negative binomial model indicate that Google Insight more readily detected common ADEs compared to the other ADEs. The Wilcoxon rank sum test indicated a shift toward more complete detection for the common ADEs compared to other ADEs (pB 0.001). The negative binomial had similar results. The marginal increase in the number of ADEs detected by Google at the median for both the common and other ADEs was similar at 1.27 and 1.29, respectively. However, the median values were 7 and 39, respectively. Only 40% (59/149) of drugs with a REMS approval demonstrated a change in slope with 90% confidence. The remaining 60% (90/149) indicated no significant change in interest over the time frame. The mobile phone-based system was being used only by 20 to 60% of the reporting units. Since the start of the system, there was an increase of 10 to 25% in completeness of IDSP reports. There were significant gains (12Á30%) in timeliness of reports. The system was saving time and money on logistics when compared to paper-based reporting. Public health workers in the field were enthusiastic about the system but were not using it as widely or extensively as was possible, because of lack of clear directives for implementation; lack of guidelines for usage and lack of systematic training of workforce for using the system. A review of these post-Amerithrax incidents revealed that all the cases were identified by astute clinicians using improved laboratory techniques. The time required to suspect and confirm the diagnosis of anthrax decreased with each subsequent incident, with increased awareness of animal sources of anthrax combined with improved compliance with laboratory reporting protocols. While syndromic surveillance systems did not identify the initial patients, these systems were used to search for additional cases. These efforts were enhanced when they were well coordinated among all jurisdictions. Three examples from our simulation study are shown in Table 1 . Data are generated from three different sets of parameters (CWS (8) and CBS (r)), and the aim is to detect a shift in mean of 2s.d. Dataset 1 has no CWS and CBS (800 and r 00). Dataset 2 includes CWS (8 00.4), while dataset 3 presents both CWS and CBS (8 00.4 and r00.3). For all datasets, the parallel method gives longer delays compared with other methods. In the case of dataset 1 (no CWS and CBS), the last three methods perform similarly. When CWS is present (dataset 2), the proposed method performs better than the others with slightly lower delay and much lower FAR. This pattern is repeated when CBS is incorporated (dataset 3). We generated simulated disease outbreaks that spread based on the zip code adjacency graph with additional edges added to simulate travel patterns and injected these outbreaks into real-world hospital data. We evaluated detection time and spatial accuracy using the learned graphs for these simulated injects (Fig. 1 ). This figure also shows the detection performance given the true (adjacency plus travel) graph, the adjacency graph without travel patterns and the average performance given randomly generated graphs. We observe that the learned graph achieves comparable spatial accuracy to the true graph, while the adjacency graph has lower accuracy. Additionally, the learned graph is able to detect outbreaks over a day earlier than the true graph and 1.5 days earlier than the adjacency graph. Thus, our method can successfully learn the additional edges due to travel patterns, substantially improving detection performance. From 858 reports collected, elephants (n0107, 12.5%), rhinoceros (n0103, 12.0%), tigers (n068, 7.9%), leopards (n054, 6.3%), and pangolins (n045, 5.2%) were among the most commonly intercepted species (to include live animals and wildlife products). Zoonotic diseases associated with these species include rabies, cowpox, echinococcosis, anthrax, and tuberculosis. Countries with the most illegal wildlife product interceptions included India (n 0146, 15.6%), the United States (n0143, 15.3%), South Africa (n075, 8.0%), China (n041, 4.4%), and Vietnam (n037, 4.0%). Vomiting and diarrhea were each highly correlated with the combined GI syndrome (r 00.99, p B0.0001; r 00.93, p B0.001, respectively), although vomiting has a greater magnitude than diarrhea. ED GI visits were correlated with GI hospital admissions (r 00.73, p B0.0001). Similar results were also seen when comparing HEDSS GI data to the number of total reported outbreaks (r00.76, pB0.0001) and facility outbreaks (r00.71, p B0.0001) but not community outbreaks alone (r 0 0.09, p00.23). The combined GI syndrome was inversely correlated with laboratory confirmed cases of Giardia (r0( 0.18, p 00.02), Campylobacter (r 0(0.45, p B0.0001), STEC (r0(0.32, p B0.0001), Listeria (r0(0.23, p 00.004), Salmonella (r0(0.41, p B0.0001), Shigella (r0(0.19, p 00.01), Vibrio (r 0(0.36, p B0.0001). No significant positive correlations were detected when controlling for seasonality or using a narrower syndrome definition. There was no significant geographic variation in GI illness by region. Children younger than 5 years had a proportion of ED visits for GI illness that was consistently higher than all other age groups. The median and mean asthma LOS over the period of study were 2 and 3 days, respectively. Admissions increased over the years from 8308 (2001) to 10,554 (2006) , but LOS declined within the same period. Fewer males (48%) than females (52%) were admitted and, the latter had longer LOS compared to males. Only 5% were primarily diagnosed as predominantly allergic, whilst >94% were classified as 'asthma, unspecified'. Younger people were more likely to be admitted than elderly, but the latter had higher LOS (p B0.001). The secondary diagnosis and method of admission were important diagnostic determinants of length of stay, with very marginal differences between the two statistical models ('I' & 'A'). Again, all the temporal factors were significant determinants of LOS. Overall the patient cluster model (AIC=239394.8) outperformed the area model (AIC=247899.9). The penalized subset scan was evaluated using emergency department (ED) data from 97 Allegheny County zip codes. We compared detection power and spatial accuracy, with and without compactness constraints, on synthetic, spatially localized outbreaks injected into the ED data. Our results show that including compactness constraints allows the penalized subset scan methods to detect outbreaks earlier and improve spatial accuracy, as compared to the unpenalized fast localized scan and circular scan, over a wide range of neighborhood sizes (Fig.  1) . Without compactness constraints, the method averaged 7.6 days to detect and an overlap coefficient of 54.9% for neighborhood size of k 010, but detection performance degraded rapidly for smaller or larger values of k. Performance of the compactness-constrained methods was less dependent on neighborhood size, requiring 7.4 days to detect and achieving an overlap coefficient of 59.3% for well-chosen parameter values. Several products or tools specific to biosurveillance, disease detection and investigation were created through the APC Program methodology. Highlighted in this talk will be the Building a Public Health Community of Practice*A Biosurveillance Resource Compendium is a CD toolkit intended to help public health agencies implement an effective, comprehensive biosurveillance program. Providing approximately 40 resources, the CD includes a series of articles on implementing biosurveillance initiatives, materials defining and discussing the development of a public health community of practice, specific examples of real-world tools and resources that have proven beneficial in North Texas (including system response protocols) and a research report on biosurveillance system efficacy. The CD can help public health agencies strengthen partnerships with stakeholders at the federal, state and local levels and with the medical community, law enforcement, first responders and schools; it details how Tarrant County Public Health accomplished those goals and shares tools that were instrumental to the agency's success. During the third week of July 2011, Ohio experienced a heat wave with multiple heat advisories throughout its various cities. The total ED visits related to HRI peaked on July 21 (n0170, 107 males, 63 females), which was also the day with the highest maximum temperature (97.4 F). A time-series chart of these ED visits by age group is shown below. The data show that the most sensitive populations (ages 0-5 and 65 and older) were the least affected and likely were adhering to the heat advisories. The 18Á 39-and 40Á64-year-old age groups were most affected by the heat. Pearson correlation showed a strong relationship between HRI visits and mean temperature and dew point (r00.76 and r00.66), p B0.0001. Multiple linear regression analyses were completed to determine which weather variables were the best predictors with HRI. The best model showed that for every 1 unit increase in ED visits, there was a 3.88 unit increase in mean temperature, independent of mean humidity and wind speed, p B0.0001. The addition of mean dew point caused the model to have a high colinearity and was removed from the model. This MU project generated more hospital participation than was realized prior to initiating the Rhapsody integration. Negligible syndromic surveillance processing time degradation was realized with the added Rhapsody processing. This processing allowed NH DPHS to implement its last acute care hospital into the existing syndromic surveillance application (using Rhapsody mapping), filter existing hospital syndromic surveillance transmissions on specific patient types (preventing unwanted types), receive MU ELR and immunization data prior to expected timelines, increase hospital MU certification reimbursement without additional MU expenditure and decrease the hospital laboratory staff reporting burden, which previously was manual. Conclusions NH DPHS was able to take advantage of opportunities and resources beyond the State of NH. The brokered Orion Health Rhapsody MU certification solution provided a lower cost certification solution to hospitals (as compared to purchasing Rhapsody or certifying their EHR). NH DPHS was able to build an expandable public health MU infrastructure easily integrated with the NH HIE. The MU REC website provided guidance, FAQs, state rules and allowed NH DPHS to communicate effectively with hospital partners and the NH REC, to take advantage of REC expertise, and keep all partners informed. Over the past 10 years, the usefulness of NH's surveillance systems has been demonstrated repeatedly. STEMS detected influenza and school norovirus outbreaks (3), and AHEDD tracked H1N1 and acute respiratory illness during the flu season, detected anthrax exposures during a gastrointestinal anthrax investigation and identified reportable disease occurrences (i.e., Lyme disease) and nonreportable clusters (i.e., carbon monoxide). These narrowly defined chief complaint queries have been found to be more useful than broad-based queries in detecting daily illness and heath risks. Results of individual surveillance systems assessed together validate individual system detections (i.e., increased sales of OTC antiviral medication and increased school ILI absenteeism validate ED flu spikes). Recent ILI was reported by 3.37% (95% CI: 3.02Á3.73%) of responders. 67.7% (95% CI: 66.8Á68.6%) reported receiving the influenza vaccine in the past year. After adjusting for sociodemographics, health behaviors, and chronic disease diagnoses, receipt of influenza vaccination was significantly associated with recent ILI, with vaccine recipients being more likely to report ILI (aOR 01.50, 95% CI: 1.01Á2.24). Persons who are underweight (BMIB18.5, compared with normal weight) (aOR 03.21, 95% CI: 1.19Á8.65), and those diagnosed with asthma (aOR 02.45, 95% CI: 1.65Á3.62), coronary heart disease (aOR 01.77, 95% CI: 1.17Á2.65), and stroke (aOR 0 1.75, 95% CI: 1.07Á2.87) were also more likely to report ILI. Maps of cases (per 100,000) in NC show that the disease has spread into rural counties and is no longer concentrated along the highway (see Fig. 1 ). In Florida, along with the overall decrease in syphilis incidence, the distribution of cases becomes more concentrated from 1990 to 1998. When, in 1999, syphilis incidence rates begin to increase again, the distribution again widens and spreads to more rural communities (see Fig. 2 ). The time series of national state-level syphilis distribution indicates an increase in the number of states at the extremes of the distribution (i.e., with very high or very low case counts). However, at the same time, the national county-level distribution remains stationary. This indicates that counties with high case counts are clustering in states with high case counts and similarly counties with low case counts are clustering in states with low case counts. We currently have 31 data requests in our online tracking system. Each data request represents multiple e-mails and phone calls, iterative revisions to the data request and multiple data pulls from the NC DETECT database. Requests can be delayed when researchers request data elements that are not collected by NC DETECT, submit unclear requirements, change requirements, do not understand the challenges of processing free text data and/or add/change researchers who will be accessing the data. Requesters have used NC DETECT data to publish manuscripts on topics including the health effects of wildfires, ED visits for cancer patients, tick-borne illness and asthma, and comparison of NC ED visit data to national data, among others. Because the ED visit data are collected under a state mandate and in collaboration with the NCHA, their release and use for research is thoroughly evaluated by the DOC. The complexity of the data requests over time has resulted in changing of data use restrictions, as well as revisions of the DUA wording. We do not have enough resources to closely monitor the use of the data once they are provided to researchers. However, researchers are expected to abide by all provisions detailed in their DUA and by signing acknowledge the potential penalties for violation of the terms the agreement. Retrospective analysis done during the past 30 days before the event was officially reported showed that EDE Alerts were already triggered as early as 30 days (median of 27.5 and range 14Á30 days) prior to the date of the NEC report. The number of days associated with EDE 'alerts' out of the 30 days prior to the NEC official report date had a median of 9.5 days (range of 3Á14 days). A total of 17 municipalities had reported dengue cases above the alert or epidemic threshold with 8/17 of these municipalities having at least 1 day in the previous week with a case count of more than 5 while 9/17 had case counts of 5 or less for all 7 days in the past week. For municipalities with at least 1 day with a case count of 5 or more for the previous 7 days, the median of the number of days with associated EDE alerts was 5 (range 0Á7 days). For municipalities with case counts of 5 or less for all 7 prior days, no alerts were usually generated (median 0 and range 0Á2 days). The data covered 72% of the population of Réunion Island. Over the surveillance period, 11,048,739 consultations were recorded with an average of 82,453 consultations per week (min: 56,682; max: 120,432). An illustration of the results obtained with the historical limit method is presented in Fig. 1 . The first alarms that occurred on week 34 to week 36 of 2009 corresponded to the influenza A(H1N1) epidemic with a peak in week 35. Statistical alarms observed on week 8 of 2010, and week 7 to 9 of 2011 were related to the season circulation of respiratory syncytial virus. These results were confirmed by the laboratory data. During the austral winter of 2010, one alarm was obtained in week 39 corresponding to the influenza epidemic. Currently, two existing syndromic surveillance oriented ontologies* Biocaster and ESSO*have been loaded into the cKASS triple store and can be used as a basis to construct new syndrome definitions. Both KBs can be queried using SPARQL and SQL. Conclusions cKASS offers public health professionals and clinicians an environment to support the extension and modification of existing KBs, without the need to use complex ontology editing environments and formalisms, allowing the user to rapidly develop or augment existing syndrome definitions and react quickly to the changing surveillance landscape. Keywords Syndrome surveillance; knowledge authoring; ontology (1). Producers were informed of the problem by their swine processing facility. Tissue samples from affected producers were culture-positive for Mycobacterium avium. In the spring of 2010, USDA Veterinary Services (VS) began monitoring weekly ADRS STB carcass condemn data after a VS Staff Officer was made aware of unusual increases in STB condemns in another region. By June 2010, STB condemn rates in both of the affected areas decreased to typical seasonal levels; however, beginning January 2011, rates again rose beyond baseline seasonal highs, exceeding those seen in the 2010 outbreak. Mean weekly swine TB condemn rates, which seasonally ranged from 5.7 to 21.4 per 100,000 between 2007 and 2009 (mean 010.7, SD03.0), increased above typical levels beginning January 2010 and rose even higher beginning January 2011 (Fig. 1) . Most of the increase was due to condemns in Basin 3, which experienced 670/ 100,000 weekly STB condemns at the height of the 2011 outbreak. Summary data for Basins 1, 2 and 4 indicate that condemn profiles remained at nonoutbreak levels over the 4-year data series. Retrospective analysis by individual facility suggests that while condemns in Basin 1 appeared to coincide with typical seasonal STB rates, the pattern of alerts for one facility may have signaled STB outbreaks in both outbreak periods. Of 2538 TuAnalyze users, 608 (24% response rate) completed two complementary surveys on hypoglycemia and diabetes care. Of these, 169 (27.8%) reported ]1 severe low in the past 12 months. Harms were high; one in seven reported an accident or serious injury; over 40% reported high daily worry, and the frequency of reported withdrawal behaviors ranged from 20 to 50%. Experience of ]1 past 12-month severe low was associated with added risk for each of the six harms, and for experiencing multiple harms. (Tables 1 and 2) . An aberrant proportion of out-of-catchment zip code ILI encounters signaled an out-of-control process (or alert) on July 23, 2009, 2 days later than the beginning of the influenza outbreak at the facility (Fig. 1 ) on the date when the majority of affected participants were evaluated for flu symptoms. (The alert on July 26, 2009, was a part of this same outbreak.) Using this algorithm, there were two other days in the 7-month period during which the chart signaled that the process was out-of-control: March 21, 2009, and September 6, 2009 . Investigations are being conducted to determine the nature of these other signals. Surveillance for sCAP began in December 2008, prior to the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic. Six facilities representing all areas of the state, both rural and metropolitan were included. The website, www.kyflu.net was developed for study coordination. From December 1, 2008, through August 2011, 458 cases of sCAP were identified. There were multiple areas of specialcause variance on the SPC charts, though there were no unusual clusters upon spatial evaluation of the maps. The most common virus identified in patients with sCAP was rhinovirus (n039, 20%), followed by 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (n034, 18%). These viruses were cultured in chicken eggs, genetically analyzed and further studied in mouse and ferret models to determine viral evolution and virulence mechanisms. One influenza virus was found to be hypervirulent compared to other strains. Both search strategies, with and without full text, were able to find the particular drug/ADE pair mentioned in letters before the corresponding Micromedex reference. However, using fulltext search outperformed title/MeSH-based search, not only based on the number of drug/ADE pairs found but also on the time of detection. The percentage of letters in the dataset that are not related to specific articles is 0.6% using title/MeSH, 2.1% using title/full-text. Furthermore, we found that MeSH terms are not always reliable. For example, some of the letters had MeSH terms like ''Adverse Effect'' but no mention of adverse effects in the letter. Not surprisingly, since MeSH is a controlled vocabulary, some of these terms do not appear in the full text of the letters. These findings are shown in Table 1 . Using NEISS-AIP, we calculated an estimated 5946 (95% confidence interval [CI]04194Á7698) ED visits for sports-and recreation-related heat illnesses occurred annually from 2001 to 2009. Incidence was highest among males (72.5%) and among persons aged 15Á19 years (35.6%) and occurred most commonly during football (24.7%) and exercise (20.4%). Using RIO TM , we calculated an estimated 9237 (95% CI 08357Á10,116) heat illnesses resulting in time lost from participation occurred during high school sports annually from 2005 to 2009, most commonly during football (70.7%). The methodology has some nice features including timely detection of outbreaks, robust inference to model misspecification, reasonable prediction performance as well as attractive analytical and visualization tool to assist public health authorities in risk assessment. Based on extensive simulation studies and synthetic data generated from a dynamic SIR model, we demonstrated that the model is capable of capturing outbreaks rapidly, while still limiting false positives. One hundred and eight veterinarians from 28 livestock clinics contributed data to the surveillance project between April 2009 and June 2011. No clinics withdrew from the study. Fig. 1 illustrates the timeliness of reporting before and after the PM incentive. Veterinarians participating in OFSP submitted a sample to the AHL 11% of the time they completed a disease-related farm call. A comparison of 20 OFSP clinics revealed that 458 more cases were submitted to the AHL while those clinics were participating in the OFSP than the year prior to participation. OFSP clinics represented 19% (28/147) of the clinics submitting pathology samples during the time period the PM incentive was offered. OFSP pathology submissions represented 36% (712/ 1984) of the total pathology livestock submissions for the same time period. For the same period, the previous year (pre-PM incentive) OFSP pathology submissions accounted for 7.7% (141/1822) of the total pathology submissions. The proportion of laboratory submissions from OFSP clinics positive for a zoonotic disease increased from 4.3% prior to participation in the project to 7.7% while part of the OFSP.
