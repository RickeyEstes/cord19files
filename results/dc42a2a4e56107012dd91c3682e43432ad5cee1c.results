A total of 2374 patients were seen at our clinic during the study period ( Table 1 ). The mean age of patients was 35 ± 14 years, with 918 people female (39%). Of the 2374 included patients, 2251 (95%) were Japanese, 120 (5.1%) were born in foreign countries (2 Japanese) and 87 (3.7%) lived abroad (57 Japanese). The most frequently traveled region before clinic visit was Southeast Asia (n ¼ 1050, 44%), whilst 102 patients (4.3%) had traveled to multiple regions. The median duration of overseas travel was 8 days (0e27480 days). The predominant reasons for overseas travel were tourism (n ¼ 1302, 55%), business (n ¼ 684, 29%), and VFR (n ¼ 209, 9%). The highest number of patients seen per year was in 2007, with the lowest number seen in 2010. The number of patients has increased since 2012 (Table 2 ). Of the 2399 diagnoses made in our clinic, the most frequently affected organ system was the gastrointestinal system, followed by skin and soft tissue, and systemic febrile diseases. Acute and chronic diarrhea were the most frequently observed gastrointestinal diseases, with fewer cases of enteric fever, esophagitis, and gastritis (Table 3 ). Causative agents identified in cases of gastrointestinal disease included Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and diarrheagenic E. coli, with Giardia intestinalis being the most frequently observed parasitic infection (Table 3 ). Three cases of irritable bowel syndrome and one case of drug-induced (atovaquone/proguanil) diarrhea were also observed. The majority of skin/soft tissue diseases were caused by animal exposure with or without post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies, insects bite, and lymphadenitis ( Table 4 ). The predominant sources of animal exposure were dogs, monkeys, and cats, with squirrels, sheep, lions, donkeys, bats, and boars identified as less frequent sources. Systemic febrile diseases are shown in Table 5 . A total of 81 cases of dengue fever, 76 cases of malaria, 4 cases of measles, 4 cases of chikungunya fever, 4 cases of leptospirosis, and 1 case of murine typhus were diagnosed. Respiratory diseases were predominantly unspecified upper respiratory infections or influenza (Table 6 ). Bronchitis and pneumonia were observed in 34 and 26 cases respectively. Frequent causative agents identified in cases of pneumonia included Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Cases of genitourinary diseases included 10 cases of urinary tract infection and 2 cases of prostatitis (Table 7) . There was one case of a foreign doctor developing acute pseudomonas prostatitis. Hepatobiliary diseases included hepatitis and biliary infection (Table 8 ). Hepatitis A virus was the most frequent cause of hepatitis. The predominant neurological disease was aseptic meningitis (Table 9 ). The case of rabies developed right shoulder pain, cough, anxiety, and confusion 3 months after a dog bite in the Philippines. He was diagnosed with rabies and provided with intensive care, although eventually died. Data pertaining to infrequent diseases, such as endocrine, bone/ joint, ophthalmological, otological, and other diseases, are shown in Table 10 . There were 2 cases of newly diagnosed HIV infection. Diseases rarely diagnosed in Japan but observed in the present study included rabies, cutaneous leishmaniasis, melioidosis, and murine typhus. The most frequent regions of exposure were Southeast Asia (n ¼ 1014, 43%), South Asia (n ¼ 377, 16%), Africa (n ¼ 259, 11%), East Asia (n ¼ 225, 9.4%), and "unspecified" (n ¼ 106, 4.5%; Table 11 ). Outcomes were generally good in the present study, with only one fatal case of rabies and 220 (9.5%) patients admitted to hospital. Pre-travel vaccination or anti-malarial chemoprophylaxis was performed in 394 (25%) and 13 (0.8%) patients, respectively. Vaccine-preventable diseases were diagnosed in 127 cases, including influenza (81), typhoid fever (17), hepatitis A (7), rubella (6), varicella (5), measles (4), pneumococcal pneumonia (3), tuberculosis (2), mumps (1) and rabies (1).
