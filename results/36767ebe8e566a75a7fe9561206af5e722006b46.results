The study included a total of 463 subjects who were randomly assigned to receive either inosine pranobex (n = 231) or placebo (n = 232), and 98.5 % of subjects completed the study (Fig. 1 -Flow chart) . There were 7 subjects who discontinued the study; the reasons included protocol noncompliance (n = 2), AEs (n = 2; rhinopharyngitis and pleuropneumonia), and withdrawal of consent (n = 2). Overall, 137 subjects (29.6 %) had positive nasopharyngeal swab test results and were included in the mITT analysis set (inosine pranobex, n = 71; placebo, n = 66).
