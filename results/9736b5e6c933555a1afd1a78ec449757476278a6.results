Of the 350 persons contacted, 302 (165 women and 137 men) agreed to participate. Their ages ranged from 18 to 67 years (mean = 27.18 years, standard deviation: 4.21). Forty per cent selfidentified as Muslim, 39% as Christian, 16% as Animists and 5% as atheists. They had completed at least an elementary-school education. More detailed demographic information is shown in Table 1 . Rates of literacy and elementary school attendance among the participants were higher than those of the general population of Guinea (which were in 2013, 25.3% and 83.5%) [43] . No reliable statistics are available for the other demographic characteristics considered in the study. The patterns of data that correspond to four of the five clusters are shown in Figure 1 , and the distribution of participants in each cluster is shown in Table 1 . Mean ratings for each scenario, overall and for each cluster, are available from the corresponding author. The first cluster (N = 55, 18% of the sample) was called Never Acceptable because the mean rating was 0.30; that is, extremely close to zero. The impact on ratings of the factors involved in the scenarios was weak. Females (24%), younger people (21% of ages 18-20 and 27% of ages 21-30), Muslims (26%), Animists (34%) and participants with an elementary-school education (39%) were significantly more likely to belong to this cluster than other participants.
