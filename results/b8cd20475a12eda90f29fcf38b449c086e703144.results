The total DALYs of communicable diseases were 445 per 100,000 in 2012. Overall, 29.0% of DALYs were from YLLs (129 per 100,000) and 71.0% of DALYs were from YLDs (316 per 100,000). The total DALYs in men were 468 per 100,000 and in women were 422 per 100,000. The proportion of YLLs in men was 34.2%, which was higher than that seen in women (23.5%) ( Table 1) . The 40-49 years old age group had the highest number of DALYs and the ≥ 80 years old age group had the lowest number of DALYs. On the other hand, the ≥ 80 years old age group had the highest proportion of DALYs per 100,000 at 1,249 DALYs per 100,000, followed by the 70-79 years old age group at 799 DALYs per 100,000, the 0-9 years old age group at 552 DALYs per 100,000, and the 60-69 years old age group at 488 DALYs per 100,000. The proportion of YLLs and YLDs in DALYs varied by age group. With increasing age, the proportion of YLLs increased for all groups except for the 0-9 years old age group (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). We classified communicable diseases into 4 categories according to GBD 2010 study (2): (i) HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, (ii) diarrhea, lower respiratory infections, meningitis, and other common infectious diseases, (iii) neglected tropical diseases and malaria, and (iv) other communicable disorders. The largest proportion of DALYs was for diarrhea, lower respiratory infections, meningitis, and other common infectious diseases, comprising 59.7% of the total DALYs, followed by HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis at 33.8%, other communicable disorders at 6.1%, and neglected tropical diseases and malaria at 0.4% (Table 2). In 2012, lower respiratory infections were responsible for the highest proportion of DALYs at 143 DALYs per 100,000, followed by tuberculosis at 121 DALYs per 100,000, upper respiratory in-fections at 69 DALYs per 100,000, HIV/AIDS at 30 DALYs per 100,000, and hepatitis at 22 DALYs per 100,000. The top five communicable diseases accounted for approximately 86% of the total DALYs (Table 3) . Tuberculosis was responsible for the highest proportion of DALYs in men (148 DALYs per 100,000), followed by lower respiratory infections, upper respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, and hepatitis. In women, lower respiratory infections were responsible for the highest proportion of DALYs (154 DALYs per 100,000) followed by tuberculosis, upper respiratory infections, hepatitis, and otitis media (Table 4) . Lower respiratory infections were responsible for the highest proportion of DALYs in the 0-19 years old age group, the 30-39 years old age group, and the over 80 years old age group. On the other hand, tuberculosis was responsible for the highest proportion of DALYs in the other age groups. HIV/AIDS ranked fourth in all age groups between the ages of 20-69 years old. Otitis media was the third leading cause of DALYs in the 0-9 years old age group and the fourth leading cause of DALYs in the 10-19 years old age group (Fig. 2 ). In addition, as age increased, DALYs per 100,000 for otitis media decreased. The DALYs per 100,000 for upper respiratory infections also decreased as age increased. In S181 https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2016.31.S2.S178 the case of diarrheal disease, the DALYs per 100,000 increased rapidly in the over 70 years old age group (Fig. 3) . The disease with the highest YLLs was tuberculosis at 43 per 100,000, followed by lower respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrheal disease and meningitis. On the other hand, the disease with the highest YLDs was lower respiratory infections at 104 per 100,000 followed by tuberculosis, upper respiratory infections, hepatitis, and otitis media (Table 5) .
