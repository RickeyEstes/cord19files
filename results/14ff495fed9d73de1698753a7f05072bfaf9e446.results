At the beginning of the study all animals were healthy according to the results of the clinical examination. The mean weight was 194.9 kg (S.D. 62.6) and 189.3 kg (S.D. 59.2) at the start and end of the investigation, respectively. Apart from the occasion where the faeces of one animal tested positive for Salmonella spp., samples tested negative for both Salomenlla or Coronavirus. According to the clinical examinations, no indication of C. perfringens was apparent. The clinical examinations indicated that the calves were not suffering severely from the infections, with the exception of one calf which was given Stullmisan S 1 (Essex) to treat the observed excessive diarrhoea. Diarrhoea was found in 130 (79.3%) of the 164 study animals. Diarrhoea was already present in a few animals at, or around, turnout. The percentage of animals showing diarrhoea increased from Day 3 and peaked at Day 6 post turnout (Fig. 1) . For a period of another 4 days, between 40 and 50% of the study animals showed diarrhoea. The percentage of calves with diarrhoea then decreased, but remained at levels between 20 and 40% until the end of the study. The pattern of development of diarrhoea at the herd level is shown in Fig. 2 . This graph illustrates that more than three quarters of the animals in several herds were affected. Oocysts belonging to the species of the genus Eimeria were found in all 164 calves. At the beginning of the study the mean Eimeria herd prevalence was already above 70% followed by the peak prevalence of 100% at 9 days post turnout (Fig. 3) . As the most prominent species, E. alabamensis was identified in 936 (83.3%) of a total of 1124 samples (Table 1) . At turnout, a mean of 55.6% of the animals on all farms showed E. alabamensis-positive faeces. This increased to 99.0% on Day 9 post turnout, then decreased to 60.0% at the study's end (Table 2) . During the course of the study, 79 (48.2%) calves showed opg counts >100,000 for Eimeria spp. Among these, all animals had E. alabamensis, and only one calf showed E. bovis opg counts of more than 100,000 (at Day 11 post turnout). For the complete study period, an average of 43.6% (S.D. 23.3) of the calves on the 14 sites had more than 100,000 Eimeria opg at least once. The relative peak of samples with such high counts for E. alabamensis was reached at Day 9 post turnout (Fig. 4) . One week later the number of calves shedding over 100,000 E. alabamensis oozysts per gram fell to zero (Fig. 4) . The number of E. bovis and E. zuernii positive calves peaked at Days 12 and 9 post turnout, respectively (Figs. 5 and 6). Both the mean E. bovis and the mean E. zuernii opg counts remained below 500 during the course of the study (data not shown). The statistical examination of the data revealed that calves which showed signs of diarrhoea were significantly more often excreting over 100,000 E. alabamensis oocysts per gram faeces (0.28; p = 0.0002) than those without diarrhoea. Of the 130 animals for which diarrhoea was recorded, 72 were found to shed more than 100,000 E. alabamensis oocysts per gram. Also, the number of days on which animals showed diarrhoea was correlated with high oocyst shedding (0.39; p = 0.0001). Among the group of animals with high oocyst counts, this was particularly true for 24 animals where persistence of diarrhoea for more than 1 week up to the end of the study was observed, compared to a total of nine with lower counts. Within the latter group, only two animals showed diarrhoea later than 8 days post turnout. Accordingly, the number of days where animals showed high E. alabamensis oocyst counts correlated with the number of days when diarrhoea was present (0.28; p = 0.0003). Out of a total of 79 calves showing faeces with more than 100,000 oocysts per gram for at least 1 day, 72 had diarrhoea.
