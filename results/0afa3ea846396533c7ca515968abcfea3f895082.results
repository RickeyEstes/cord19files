Cohousing Charles River (SFB ؉ ) and Jackson mice (SFB ؊ ) protected Jackson CBA mice from E. histolytica infection. To test if alteration if the intestinal microbiota could alter susceptibility to E. histolytica infection, mice from two different animal vendors, Charles River and Jackson Laboratories, were cohoused (31, 32) . The SFB status of mice after 3 weeks of cohousing was measured via qPCR and Gram stains. The cohoused mice were then challenged with E. histolytica trophozoites (2 ϫ 10 6 ) via intracecal injection. Seven days later, E. histolytica and SFB burden were measured by qPCR. Cohousing mice transferred SFB (Fig. 1A) , and potentially many other bacteria, and provided protection against E. histolytica infection (Fig. 1B) . Segmented filamentous bacteria specifically protect against E. histolytica and induce increased IL-17A, IL-23, neutrophils, and dendritic cells in the intestine and SAA in the blood. As cohousing of mice both transferred SFB and was protective against E. histolytica infection, we sought to determine if SFB specifically provided protection against the ameba. We directly colonized CBA/J mice from Jackson Laboratories with SFB by orogastric gavage with SFB-monoassociated feces resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), provided by the Yakult Central Institute for Microbiological Studies, 1 week prior to E. histolytica infection. Mice became colonized with SFB following gavage ( Fig. 2A) and were protected from infection with the ameba (Fig. 2B) . Additionally, there was increased IL-17A and IL-23 expression before ( onized mice after E. histolytica infection. We also observed increased SAA in serum in SFB-colonized mice after ameba infection (Fig. 2G ). BMDCs derived from SFB-colonized mice have an increased capacity to produce IL-23 that is partially recapitulated with SAA treatment. IL-23 is a key cytokine in the generation and maintenance of IL-17A-producing cells (33) . SAA can directly induce IL-23 from both DCs and macrophages (20, 34) and is known to upregulate an epigenetic mediator, JMJD3 (33) , that specifically increases IL-23 production in a macrophage cell line. Thus, as SFB increased frequency of intestinal DCs, IL-23, IL-17A expression, and circulating serum SAA, we examined the capacity of bone marrow DCs from SFB-infected mice to produce IL-23 in response to trophozoites. BMDCs were generated from SFB-free and SFB-infected mice and treated with trophozoites for 24 h. BMDCs and trophozoites were cocultured in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) under aerobic conditions rather than in ameba culture medium under anaerobic conditions, as both DCs and trophozoites were viable after 24 h in these media; however, some cell death had occurred, as observed via trypan blue. Cytokines in the supernatants were then determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (IL-23; R&D Systems). BMDCs derived from mice that were colonized with SFB produced significantly more IL-23 in response to trophozoites (Fig. 3A) . These data suggested that SFB altered bone marrow cells in such a way as to favor increased IL-23 production. We hypothesized that SAA induced in the serum by intestinal SFB colonization could influence BMDCs to produce increased IL-23. Therefore, we wanted to test if the presence of SAA during the differentiation of SFB-free BMDCs might alter them in such a way that they also would produce more IL-23. Thus, SAA (10 g/l) was added for the first 4 days of bone marrow DC culture. Addition of SAA to BMDC culture from SFB-free mice partially recapitulated the increased IL-23 seen in BMDCs derived from SFB ϩ mice (Fig. 3B ). This suggested that SAA might be at least partially responsible for alteration of bone marrow DCs in this model. BMDCs from SFB ؉ but not SFB ؊ mice migrated to the intestine. To test if the increase in DCs in the gut of SFB ϩ mice was due to a direct effect on the bone marrow, BMDCs from SFBcolonized and SFB-free mice were adoptively transferred to SFB Ϫ mice. For in vivo transfers, day 6 BMDC from SFB Ϫ and SFB ϩ mice were matured with LPS (1 g/ml), and 16 h later, cells were stained with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE; 10 nM), and 5 ϫ 10 5 cells were administered via intraperitoneal injection. CFSE ϩ BMDC were detected in the lamina propria but only from SFB ϩ mice (Fig. 4) . The ability of SFB ϩ BMDCs to home to the gut may help explain the increased numbers of DCs seen in the lamina propria of SFB-colonized mice during E. histolytica infection (Fig. 2E) . These results were consistent with other studies that have shown that adoptive transfer of LPS-matured BMDCs results in DC trafficking to the intestine (28, 29, 35) . Adoptive transfer of BMDCs from SFB colonized mice was sufficient to provide protection against infection in an IL-17Adependent manner. We hypothesized that BMDCs from SFBcolonized mice may provide protection against amebiasis and that the mechanism of this protection might be via downstream induction of IL-17A. To explore this idea, we adoptively transferred BMDCs (5 ϫ 10 5 cells) from SFB Ϫ or SFB ϩ mice to SFB Ϫ mice prior to E. histolytica infection. Indeed, we found that BMDCs from SFB ϩ mice were sufficient both to confer protection (Fig. 5A) and to recapitulate the increase in neutrophils (Fig. 5B ) observed with SFB colonization alone. Blockade of IL-17A during transfer abrogated protection (Fig. 5C ) and neutrophil influx (Fig. 5D ) and led to a decrease in IgA induction (Fig. 5E ). We concluded that IL-17A and downstream innate and perhaps adaptive immune responses underlie the protection observed during adoptive transfer of BMDCs from SFB ϩ mice.
