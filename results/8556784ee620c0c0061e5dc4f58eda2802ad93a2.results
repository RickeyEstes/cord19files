The vaccinated cows, including the controls, did not have local reactions or general changes. The gestation and parturition were normal, followed by birth at the end of term and the milk production was within the average of the herd. Of the 45 calves born alive and viable from vaccinated mothers only 3 presented slight depression and water diarrhea in the second and third day of age. The 4 control calves died, one at 24 h and the others at the third-fourth day with profuse diarrhea, serious dehydration with insufficient peripheral circulation (Table 1 ). In the vaccinated and the control cows the hematomorphological examination showed hypochromic anemia and neutrophilic granulocytosis during the whole period of observation, let alone a decrease, statistically significant, of the eosinophils in the third and fourth samples (Tables 2 and 3 ). In the calves from vaccinated cows the hemogram performed within 24 h from birth revealed anemia and neutrophilia; further checks showed the persistence of the anemia and the inversion of the granulocyte/lymphocyte relationship ( Table 4 ). The results of the serological tests with K99 antigen and the acapsular mutant are shown in Tables 5 and  6 , Figs 1 and 2.
