By combining information derived from the phylogram of bat CoVs, together with data on the geographic origin of viruses, we were able to describe the phylogeographic distributions for known CoVs from bats in China (Figures 1, 2 ; Table) . Bat SARS-like CoVs formed a monophyletic clade. Species-specifi c host restriction was found for CoVs in 4 of 7 bats species (Myotis ricketti, M. magnater, P. abramus, and T. pachypus) sampled from >1 geographic location, and these clustered with high Bayesian posterior probability. Overall phylogenetic relationships between virus lineages were similar across our analyses, and well-supported genetic structure was observed within some CoV lineages. For example, CoVs isolated from M. magnater were monophyletic but formed 3 well-supported clades with no evidence of geographic structure (Bayesian posterior probability [PP] = 1.0 for each). A similar pattern was apparent in CoVs from Myotis ricketti, which formed 2 geographically overlapping independent clades (PP = 0.99 and 1.0, respectively). One T. pachypus was infected by a virus that clustered with moderate statistical support (PP = 0.91) within the larger clade associated with P. abramus, which indicated a potential interspecies transmission event or recent evolutionary host shift (defi ned as interspecies transmission followed by establishment and long-term persistence in the new host species [18] ) (Figure 1) . Phylograms of host sequences were also constructed and were essentially of the same topology with high support whether derived by using MrBayes version 3.1.2 or MEGA3 (data not shown). When we mapped host phylogram to virus, virus phylogeny did not always track host phylogeny (Figure 3 ). When separate host-virus phylograms were constructed for the 2 bat families (Verspertilionidae and Rhinolophidae), different corresponding relationships were evident. Verspertilionids and their CoVs showed phylogenetic congruence, and rhinolophids and their CoVs showed incongruous phylogenies (Figure 4) . We found evidence for evolutionarily divergent relationships for some vespertilionid viruses and their hosts when analyzed at the family scale (Figure 4, panel A) . For example, divergence between viruses harbored by P. pipistrellus and P. abramus is congruent with their hosts. The divergence among other viruses was incongruent with divergence of host species, e.g., those from S. kuhlii and Myotis ricketti. Rhinolophid bats and their viruses were analyzed at a different taxonomic scale (within genus). In this co-phylogeny, viral host shifts were the evident virus-host feature (Figure 4, panel B) . Except for R. macrotis, all rhinolophidae bats had 2 distinct lineages of CoVs, and host shifts were found among viruses carried by R. ferrumequinum, R. pearsoni, and R. sinicus. Genetic diversity of CoVs harbored by rhinolophids and vespertilionids was similar (vespertilionids π = 0.27 ± 0.13; rhinolophids π = 0.25 ± 0.13). In contrast, genetic diversity of cyt b sequences from bats was much higher among the vespertilonids (π = 0.17 ± 0.007) than among the rhinolophids (π = 0.09 ± 0.006).
