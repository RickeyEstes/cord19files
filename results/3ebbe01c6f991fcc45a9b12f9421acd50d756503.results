During the study period, 126,315 patient-days and 275,067 device-days were evaluated, and 2,054 NIs and 833 DAIs occurred in 14,734 patients admitted to MS ICUs with a mean APACHE II score of 23.6 ± 7.2. The crude mortality rate was 14.4% during the study period. Those patients who were admitted to MS ICUs had a mean age of 69.5 ± 16.9 years, and male gender accounted for 71.8%. The length of ICU stay was 9.6 ± 7.5 days in average. Most patients were admitted due to major medical conditions (59%), such as neoplasms (22.2%), digestive system problems (20.7%), and respiratory system problems (17.8%). Patients with serum albumin <2.5 g/dL were 44.4% and blood creatinine >1.5 mg/dL were 67.1%. There were 13.2% patients undergoing hemodialysis during their ICU stay. The overall rates of NIs and DAIs were 16.26 episodes per 1000 patient-days and 3.03 episodes per 1000 device-days, respectively. The most common DAI type was CAUTI (mean 3 Figure 1) . A total of 1,290 pathogens were isolated from clinical specimens ( Table 2) . Acinetobacter baumannii (23%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.2%), and Staphylococcus aureus (17.4%) were the three most common pathogens associated with VAP, while S. aureus (20.4%), A. baumannii (14.9%), and Candida albicans (14.6%) accounted for the majority of CLABSIs. In contrast, non-albicans Candida (NAC) spp. (31%) rather than bacteria were the most common CAUTI pathogens, followed by Enterococci (10.1%) and Escherichia coli (9.9%). The rate of antibiotic resistance every year is presented in Table 3 (Figures 3 and 4) . DAI was an independent factor for 30-day mortality (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.99-3.17, p = 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (OR 2.61, 95% CI 2.10-3.25, p < 0.001) by multiple regression analysis. Other significant prognostic factors (p < 0.001) for mortality included APACHE II score, service, length of stay after the onset of infection, serum albumin, blood creatinine, neoplasms and hemodialysis (Table 4 ).
