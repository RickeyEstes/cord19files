Expression and Purification of Rv0888. The SignalP server revealed a signal sequence (1 to 31 residues) in the Rv0888 amino acid sequence and, as this hydrophobic sequence might increase the difficulty of expression, the fragment of rv0888 from M. tuberculosis H37Rv was cloned without the predicted signal sequence. In order to purify the protein, Rv0888 was expressed as a 6 Ã— His-tagged protein in E. coli. Though it was expressed in inclusion body form, Rv0888 was renatured and purified via a Ni 2+ affinity chromatography resin (Fig. 1A) . Then, the eluted Rv0888 protein was loaded onto an anion exchange chromatography column (Fig. 1B) and subsequently passed through a gel filtration chromatography resin, subsequently resulting in greater than 98% protein purity (Fig. 1C ). Rv0888 protein identity confirmation. The purified Rv0888 protein was analyzed by mass spectrometry and peptide mass fingerprinting results were submitted to Mascot and used to search the SwissProt database. The analysis returned 10 results, with a score of 78 assigned to the expected protein Rv0888 (GeneBank Accession No. NP_215403.1) from M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Fig. 1D ). Rv0888 nuclease activity specificity. To verify the nuclease activity, purified Rv0888 was incubated with different nucleic acids, including linear dsDNA (PCR production), circular plasmid DNA (pGEX-6p-1 vector), chromosomal DNA (E. coli DNA) or RNA from baker's yeast. Surprisingly, all of the nucleic acids were degraded by the Rv0888 protein ( Fig. 2A,B) . These results indicated that Rv0888 is a non-specific nuclease.
