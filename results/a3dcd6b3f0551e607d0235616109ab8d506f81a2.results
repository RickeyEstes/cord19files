Approach 4 corrects this bias by converting the risk-based analysis into a rate-based analysis (18, 23 ). The interval censored Cox proportional hazards models (Approaches 5-6) return estimates approximately equal to the VES input into the model. These approaches require fewer resources than would be necessitated by the Cox model with perfect knowledge of infection time (Approach 1) because they use only three or one serologic tests, respectively, rather than frequent monitoring for infection throughout the period of follow-up. Approach 6, the interval censored Cox model with testing only at the end of the trial, yields the same results as Approach 5, testing three times, without substantial difference in coverage probability or power in the .

Thus, both Approaches 4 and 6 yield accurate estimates with testing only required once at the end of the trial. Even a single serologic test could be resource-intensive. Approach 7, which only requires testing 10% of the trial participants at the end of the trial, results in accurate estimates of VES ( Figure 2 ) for all values of R0 considered and of VEP (Table 3) for R0 values of 1.25 or 1.50. Only testing 10% of the trial participants once at the end of the trial substantially reduces required resources. However, when the number of cases is very low (Supplementary Table 2 ), the sample does not accurately estimate VEP, and this approach is less efficient than others in many of the settings considered (i.e. wider confidence intervals, see Supplementary Table 3 These approaches work in both trials conducted in one large community and trials conducted in disconnected communities, such as the recent malaria trials (24). In trials with more communities or increased heterogeneity, the bias from heterogeneity in hazard rates will likely be more pronounced (16) . Methods to account for this heterogeneity, such as stratification, metaanalyses, or incorporation of random effects, should therefore be used; although when the number of cases is very low, some of these methods may be imprecise.
