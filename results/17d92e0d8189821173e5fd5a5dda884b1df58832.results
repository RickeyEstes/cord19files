Among the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, Uganda, Ghana, and Mali had a malaria incidence rate greater than 100 per 100,000 travelers (see Table 1 ). The rate in Nigeria was two to threefold less than in these countries. High rates were noted in the Central African Republic and Chad, however, there was only one case of malaria from each of these countries. Rates could not be calculated for the West African countries of Burkina Faso, CÃ´te d'Ivore, Senegal, or Cameroon due to a lack of denominator data, although cases of malaria were imported from these countries (7, 5, 5, 5 cases, respectively). The lowest rates were from South Africa and Kenya. Plasmodium falciparum malaria accounted for all, or the majority of infections from the African countries, except for Ethiopia where the infections were split almost equally between those due to P. falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Incidence rates in Asia were much lower than in African countries. Myanmar had the highest rate, followed by India and Pakistan. Indonesia yielded the highest number of imported malaria cases, but with a large number of travelers to this country, the incidence rate was low. Fewer malaria cases were imported from Thailand and with a higher volume of travel than Indonesia, the incidence rate was lower. Overall, P. vivax was the dominant species, accounting for 84%, 77%, 71%, 64%, and 57% of infections from India, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, and the Philippines, respectively. In Oceania, Papua New Guinea was the only country that could be analyzed and where a high incidence rate was found, comparable to some African countries. However, unlike the African countries, P. vivax infections predominated (70%). Six travelers acquired malaria in the Solomon Islands, two infections were due to P. falciparum and four due to P. vivax; however, denominator data for this country were incomplete. Brazil was the only Latin American country to be analyzed and this revealed a low incidence rate which was comparable to those in medium-risk Asian countries, with the majority of cases being due to P. vivax.
