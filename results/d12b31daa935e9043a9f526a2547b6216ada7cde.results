Patient 7, a 31 years old female without any urinary irritation, had positive results of SARS-CoV-2 in both urine and oropharyngeal swab on the 7 th day after symptom onset. Patient 1 and 5 had negative results in oropharyngeal swab, on the 10 th and 15 th day after onset. Patient 8 had three positive results in blood, anal swab and oropharyngeal swab on the 3 rd day after onset. Viral load was roughly higher in anal swab than oropharyngeal swab in patient 9 (Table) . Eight of nine patients had an obvious history of epidemiological exposure to SARS-CoV-2. All patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms were cough, sore throat, fatigue and diarrhea. Four patients had a lymphopenia. Elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were found in 6 and 5 cases respectively. All patients had normal serum levels of procalcitonin, alanine transaminase, creatinine, myocardial enzyme and arterial partial oxygen pressure. All rights reserved.
