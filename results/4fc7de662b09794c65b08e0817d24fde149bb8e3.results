Five thousand simulations combined to produce the ERC, shown as the dark, solid line in Fig. 2 . The dashed lines are 95th percentile-t simultaneous confidence bands. Also shown in Fig. 2 are 100 randomly selected realizations of the ERC from the 5000 generated. The scale on the left axis is the risk (per million) of SARS-CoV transmission from transfusion of a single unit of blood. For results displayed in Fig. 2 , estimation was based on the estimates obtained from Woo et al. Results from the secondary analysis are reported in Table 1 , using the given values of R and A.
