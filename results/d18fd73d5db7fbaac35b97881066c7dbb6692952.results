We conducted 12 focus groups (Table 1) . Across the focus groups, we identified 73 discrete stories about RPE use, which we organized into 5 categories: 1) participants knew their sites' RPE policies and protocols. They described visual cues, such as signs resulting from these policies encountered during work routines that promoted RPE use. 2) Sociocultural norms reinforced RPE use, particularly during unexpected events. 3) HCWs used their clinical experiences to determine use, sometimes opting to wear more RPE than required. 4) Additionally, risk perceptions varied by rural and urban contexts. In urban areas, for example, HCWs who perceived exposure to many high-risk patients reported limited access to RPE. Finally, 5) perceived underuse in the ED was attributed to the constant presence of patients with incomplete or delayed diagnoses. Further descriptions of each category are in the following paragraphs.
