We ). Urbanization level, length of hospital stay, and length of ICU stay were positively associated with mortality. Whether patients were treated in medical centers had no effect on the in-hospital mortality rate. The mean duration of IABP treatment was 3.86 Â± 7.39 days. Patients who died in the hospital had been treated with IABP for a longer time (p < 0.0001) ( Table 1) . A baseline clinical history of the patients who had been treated with IABP showed HTN (n = 2696; 27.09%), DM (n = 2381; 23.92%), and a prior MI (n = 1538; 15.45%), prior CVA (n = 706; 7.09%), prior heart failure (n = 1904; 19.13%), prior CABG (n = 92; 0.92%) surgery, and prior PCI (n = 22; 0.22%) ( Table 2) . Moreover, only a history of PCI showed a significant (p = 0.0145) difference between in-hospital mortality and survival. IABP use in Taiwan has been increasing annually since 1998, but the in-hospital mortality rate per IABP has been decreasing annually since 1999, except for a spike because of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (Fig 1) . The annual in-hospital mortality rate of patients treated with IABP in a particular year fell from 10.49% in 1999 to 7.25% in 2008. There were two in-hospital mortality trends (Fig 2) , one for patients who underwent CABG +IABP (p trend = 0.7501) in each particular year, and one for patients who underwent PCI +IABP (p trend = 0.1767) in each particular year. In addition, the in-hospital mortality of patients treated with IABP did not differ significantly between genders at 3 months (log-rank test p = 0.0717) (Fig 3) . However, patients < 35 years survived for a mean of 3 months longer than did those in other age groups (log-rank test p < 0.0001) (Fig 4) . The in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI and CS was 24.18% (Table 3 ). All the patients with AMI and CS treated with IABP were retrospectively divided into three groups: IABP-only, PCI+IABP, and CABG+IABP. In-hospital mortality rates were not significantly different between the three groups: IABP-only was 7/35 (20.00%); CABG+IABP was 114/453 (25.17%); and PCI+IABP was 12/62 (19.35%). The in-hospital mortality of patients who had been treated with CABG and IABP in the same admission was 12.27%. Patients who had been treated with CABG and IABP for 1 vessel in the same admission had a higher in-hospital mortality rate of 16.53%. The mortality in patients who had been treated with IABP and PCI for 1 vessel, 2 vessels, or 3 vessels in the same admission was not significantly different. The in-hospital mortality of patients who had been treated with PCI-only plus IABP was 15.45%. Based on their first two ICD-9-CM discharge diagnosis codes, six major comorbid diseases for hospitalized patients treated with IABP were identified: acute coronary syndrome (ACS),
