In Illinois, Missouri, and Colorado, respiratory illness reports for August and September were higher in 2014 compared with the same period in 2013 and 2012 (fi gure 1; appendix p 3). In northern Illinois, chief complaint data indicated increases in both paediatric emergency department visits and hospital admissions for respiratory illness during this period (fi gure 1) Overall, 927 patients tested positive for EV-D68 by molecular sequencing between August, and October, 2014, and were reported to CDC. Demographic and clinical data were available for 764 patients, whose specimen date or symptom onset date was between Aug 1, and Oct 31, 2014. Those with no reported respiratory symptoms (n=52), those who were not known to be admitted to hospital (n=89) and, if known, those whose specimen date was more than 7 days before or after hospital admission (n=9) were excluded; data were analysed for 614 patients ( (table 2) . Patients with a history of asthma or reactive airway disease were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (p=0·0004) and were more likely to require ventilator support (p=0·039) than those without. These fi ndings remained signifi cant when stratifying individually for sex or prematurity. When stratifi ed by age group, patients with a history of asthma or reactive airway disease were more likely to require intensive care than those without (p=0·0019), but there was less evidence for an association with ventilator support (p=0·059). Females were more likely to require ventilator support than males (p<0·0001), although there was no diff erence in intensive care unit admissions between sexes. This fi nding remained signifi cant when stratifying individually for a history of asthma or reactive airway disease, age group, or prematurity. Among cases for whom survival outcome was reported, fi ve (1%) of 499 were reported as fatal. The contribution of EV-D68 to the deaths of these individuals is unknown. Ages of fatal cases ranged from 5 months to 21 years. One individual had a history of asthma or reactive airway disease, one had Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and one had sickle cell trait. Sequence analyses of the EV-D68 strains collected in the USA in 2014 showed major and minor lineages cocirculating at the time of the outbreak; a representative summary of these data is provided in fi gure 3. Most patients (560 [92%] of 606) had strains in the major lineage. The major lineage viruses were closely related to strains identifi ed in the USA, Asia, and southern Europe in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Minor lineage strains accounted for 7% of EV-D68 cases. The minor lineage was closely related to strains identifi ed in southern Europe in 2012. Both the major and minor lineages were detected across many US states, and were not localised to a given region. Patients with severe illness, including the need for intensive care, were part of both lineages. One patient was infected with an EV-D68 strain that was distantly related to some strains from the Philippines, Japan, the USA, and New Zealand isolated during 2008-10. All cocirculating 2014 EV-D68 outbreak strains identifi ed at CDC are represented in the seven EV-D68 genomes previously described. 20
