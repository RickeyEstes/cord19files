One patient with allergic rhinitis was excluded from the study because of airway infection. Otherwise, all individuals complied with the protocol. Nasal administration of TNFα did not produce any nasal symptoms: score 0.8 ± 0.3 post sham challenge and score 0.8 ± 0.2 post TNFα (range 0-9). Nasal lavage fluid levels of MPO recorded 24 hrs post TNFα challenge were increased in healthy subjects (p = 0.0081) and in patients with allergic rhinitis (p = 0.0081) (c.f. sham challenge) (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, α 2 -macroglobulin was increased in both these study groups (p = 0.014 and p = 0.0034, respectively) (Fig. 2) , indicating plasma exudation. ECP and IL-8 were not affected by TNFα challenge (Figs. 3 and 4) . TNFα increased the numbers of subepithelial neutrophils in the study material as a whole (p = 0.0021) (Fig. 5) : a subgroup analysis revealed that this change reflected a statistically significant increase in the healthy group (p = 0.0015), but not in the allergic rhinitis group (p = 0.204) (Fig. 6) . Nasal biopsy numbers of eosinophils were unaffected by the TNFα challenge (Fig. 7) . (Note, a non-significant difference 24 hours post sham challenge between healthy subjects and patients with allergic rhinitis also for eosinophils (p = 0.06, Mann Whitney).) Fig. 8 shows micrographs of nasal mucosal neutrophils and eosinophils 24 hours post TNFα and sham challenge, respectively.
