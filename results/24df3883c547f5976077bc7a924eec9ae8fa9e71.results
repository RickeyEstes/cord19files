N-terminal processing defines nsp8 multimerization and nsp(7+8) complex formation SARS-CoV nsp7 and nsp8 were previously reported to interact and form a hollow ring structure that is composed of an intricate nsp8 octamer supported by  eight copies of nsp7 (13,17) ( Figure 1B ). Based on the large diameter, positive charge of the hexadecamer's channel and in silico docking, it was proposed to be able to encircle dsRNA ( Figure 1B) . However, the functional significance of the compound interactions between nsp7 and nsp8 is poorly understood, as are the polymerase activities associated with monomeric nsp8 or nsp8-containing multimers. So far, strategies for the purification of recombinant nsp8 have involved the use of affinity tags [e.g. His 6 or glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (12, 13) ] that were fused to one terminus to facilitate protein recovery. Inadvertently though, such tags or other exogenous sequences may significantly impede the correct folding of enzymes and thus alter their stability or activity, as exemplified by studies of the poliovirus (3D pol ) and SARS-CoV (nsp12) RdRp subunits (10, 14, 18) . To circumvent this issue, we developed a protocol in which SARS-CoV nsp8 was expressed as a ubiquitin (ub) fusion protein carrying a C-terminal His 6 -tag (ub-nsp8-His), which was subsequently processed at both termini in two steps. The first step was co-translational and involved the release of the N-terminal ub fusion partner by the co-expressed ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1 (Upb1, Figure 2A ) (10, 14) . The second proteolytic step, catalysed by a recombinant form of the SARS-CoV nsp5 main protease (15) , removed the C-terminal His 6 -tag and was performed either in solution (Figure 2A and B) or when nsp8-His was immobilised to Talon beads. This procedure yielded SARS-CoV nsp8 with its exact natural Nand C-terminus (replicase residues Ala-3920 and Gln-4117, respectively; Figure 2A ), the product that is normally liberated by the nsp5-driven autoprocessing of the SARS-CoV replicase polyproteins (19) . In accordance with the octameric state observed in cross-linking experiments using glutaraldehyde (Supplementary Figure S1 ) or ethylene glycolbis (13) , the hydrodynamic profile of the untagged nsp8 corresponded to a mass of $160 kDa ( Figure 2D ). To identify and explain differences with previously published observations, we also produced and characterised N-and C-terminally tagged forms of nsp8 ( Figure 2C ). Importantly, under the same assay conditions, the N-terminally His 6 -tagged nsp8 (His-nsp8) that was used in the original nsp8 RdRp activity study (12) showed a marked difference in multimerization behaviour ( Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure S1 ). On the other hand, little difference was observed between untagged nsp8 and a C-terminally His 6 -tagged version of the protein (nsp8-His; Figure 2E ). To investigate whether nsp7 could influence the change in multimerisation behaviour, we next added separately purified and C-terminally processed nsp7 to the different nsp8 preparations. Interestingly, we found that nsp8 and nsp8-His could both associate with this protein, in accordance with published data (13) , but that His-nsp8 was unable to do so within the frame of our experimental conditions ( Figure 2F ). Consequently, although various lines of evidence support the observation that nsp7 and nsp8 can form a hexadecamer, it now appears that the correct N-terminal processing of nsp8 is a significant factor in determining the final oligomeric state of the protein.
