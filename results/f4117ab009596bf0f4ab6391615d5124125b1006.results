EMCV-induced membrane rearrangements with different morphologies arise over the course of infection. We first set out to determine the relationship between EMCV replication and the emergence of ROs. Samples for quantitative PCR (qPCR), viral titer determination, immunofluorescence analysis, and electron microscopy (EM) (chemical fixation) were generated within a single experiment. HeLa cells infected with EMCV (strain Mengovirus) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 were processed every hour up to 9 h postinfection (hpi) for qPCR of viral RNA and for the determination of viral titer. Samples for immunofluorescence and electron microscopy (EM) analyses were fixed between 3 and 9 hpi. While data from these chemically fixed EM samples were assessed to quantify the emergence of ROs, representative images are presented from a subsequent experiment using an improved sample preparation method (highpressure freezing and freeze substitution) that more faithfully preserves RO morphology. The exponential phase of RNA synthesis spanned 3 to 6 hpi, while the increase in viral titer lagged by~2 h (Fig. 1A) . These RNA replication dynamics aligned well with increasing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) immunofluorescence signal, which provides a secondary indication of viral replication. The first fluorescent signal was detected at 4 hpi, and levels increased steadily each hour before reaching a plateau at 7 hpi. Between 4 and 5 hpi, dsRNA signal was found at small foci distributed throughout the cytoplasm, which became larger and more clustered as infection progressed (Fig. 1B) . The first virus-induced membrane modifications were detected in EM cell sections of cells fixed at 5 hpi, revealing a complex but sparse assortment of virus-induced single-membrane structures ( Fig. 2A, arrowheads) and, very occasionally, double-membrane structures ( Fig. 2A , asterisk). From 6 hpi, membrane modifications became increasingly clustered into large regions that dominated the cytosol, and the abundance of double-membrane structures increased (Fig. 2B , asterisks), although singlemembrane structures persisted (Fig. 2B, arrowheads) . Late in infection, doublemembrane vesicles became more dominant (Fig. 2C , white asterisks), and multilamellar structures were also found (Fig. 2C , black asterisks and inset). Between 5 and 8 hpi, the RO density in the cytoplasm greatly increased (from 0.11 to 0.63 ROs per m 2 ), and the proportion of DMVs (as a percentage of total ROs) grew from less than 1% to an average of 35%, although in some cells DMVs rather than single-membrane structures were the predominant RO morphology (Fig. 2D) . A number of cells with evident signs of lysis (e.g., disrupted plasma membrane and extracted cytosolic content) could also be found later in infection, which may explain the lack of immunofluorescence labeling in some cells by 7 hpi. Electron tomography reveals the 3D architecture and transformation of ROs. One drawback of 2D EM cell section analysis is the similarity in cross section between vesicles and tubules running perpendicular to the section plane. Additionally, features like membrane connections or small openings may be obscured by the superposition of structures in a 2D projection image. To more unambiguously characterize the morphology of EMCV ROs, cells at early and late stages of infection were prepared for electron tomography (ET). Tomograms from serial cell sections of the same region of interest were combined to form large 3D volumes. Encephalomyocarditis Virus Replication Organelles ® Single-membrane structures identified in the 2D analysis at early times postinfection were found to comprise a mixed population of single-membrane vesicles (SMVs) and single-membrane tubules (SMTs) (Fig. 3A , red and blue, respectively; see also Movie S1 in the supplemental material). Unlike the tubules formed during enterovirus infections, EMCV SMTs did not form tightly packed clusters. Both SMVs and SMTs were smooth-membrane structures and were frequently found connected to rough ER (green) by neck-like membrane connections ( Fig. 3B and C, arrowheads), like the ER-derived ROs of nidoviruses (27) (28) (29) and HCV (30) . In contrast, DMVs, which were predominantly found at late stages of infection, appeared in all instances as separate compartments, with no membrane connections to other structures (Fig. 4A , yellow; Movie S2). Some DMVs seemed to be partially enwrapped by additional cisternae late in infection (Fig. 4B , purple), to form multilamellar structures. Virus particles were also detectable in the EM data as dense hexagonal profiles of~25 nm (Fig. 4C , arrowhead), which were frequently found in the cytosol within 30 nm of ROs (Fig. S1 ). These particles (Fig. 4D , black arrowhead) were distinguishable from ribosomes (Fig. 4D , white arrowheads) by their symmetry and well-defined edges. A closer spatial association was found between virus particles and RO membranes (SMVs, SMTs, or DMVs) than between randomly generated coordinates and RO membranes (Fig. S1 , P Ͻ 0.001). This could reflect localized clustering of virions following their formation or a spatial connection between RNA synthesis and virion assembly. Ultrastructural investigations of enterovirus ROs have revealed putative transition structures that may represent the transformation of SMTs into DMVs. This process appears to involve the pairing of membrane tubules to form flattened cisternae, which curve to enwrap a small volume of cytosol, ultimately forming an open DMV in a vase-like configuration. The opening then seals to form a complete, closed DMV (21, 22) . Similar structures were found in tomograms of EMCV-infected cells, including paired and highly curved tubules (Fig. 5A , i and ii, white arrowheads), which could represent an early stage of DMV formation from SMTs, and DMVs with small openings (Fig. 5A, iii, arrowhead) . Tubular extensions of the outer membranes of DMVs were also found (Fig. 5B , indicated by white arrowheads in consecutive sections) that could represent the partial transformation of SMTs to DMVs. Supporting this idea, similar electron-dense material was observed both in the lumen of single-membrane structures (Fig. 5A , black arrowheads) and within the intermembrane space created by these tubular extensions (Fig. 5B, black arrowhead) . To further examine the possibility of a single-to double-membrane structure transformation, the surface areas of SMVs, SMTs, and DMVs were estimated using the measured average sizes for each structure (Fig. 5C,  top) . These figures provide a guide as to whether SMTs or SMVs are likely candidate precursor structures for DMVs (as described in reference 21) as, unless other lipid sources contribute to DMV membranes, any precursor structure should have at least Encephalomyocarditis Virus Replication Organelles ® the same surface area as the DMV that forms from it. The estimated surface areas generated allow for a scenario where DMVs are formed by SMTs (Fig. 5C , bottom) and are compatible with the possibility that some (smaller) DMVs could also be derived from SMVs. In this scenario, the multilamellar vesicles seen at late time points may arise from SMTs that enwrap or partially enwrap existing DMVs, rather than enwrapping the cytosol to form a new DMV. DMVs were occasionally found to contain virions in samples analyzed at 7 hpi (pooled data from four tomograms; example shown in Fig. 5D ) but at a low frequency (7% of 68 DMVs), and particles within DMVs represented a small fraction of total virus particles detected (2% of 339 particles). An enwrapping mechanism of SMT-to-DMV transformation could explain the presence of virus particles within a subset of DMVs, as virions may be enclosed by chance during the process. RNA synthesis occurs at virus-induced single-and double-membrane structures. To investigate whether all or some of these virus-induced membrane modifications support RNA synthesis, metabolic labeling and EM autoradiography (31) were performed. Cells were infected with EMCV and fixed at 5 or 7 hpi. During the 2 h prior to fixation, cells were incubated with 10 g/ml dactinomycin to limit cellular transcription. During the 45 min prior to fixation, cells were additionally treated with tritiated uridine to label newly synthesized RNA. After chemical fixation and preparation for EM, sections were processed for autoradiography. While only larger clusters of electron-dense grains are good indicators of underlying viral RNA synthesis given the limited resolution of EM autoradiography (32), substantial autoradiography signal could be found clustered around areas containing exclusively single-membrane tubules and vesicles (Fig. 6A ). This demonstrates their ability to support viral RNA synthesis. Newly synthesized RNA was also evident at RO foci comprised predominantly of DMVs at later stages of infection (Fig. 6B) , indicating that the transformation from single-membrane structure to DMV does not impede continued genome replication. PI4KA inhibition of a PI4K-resistant EMCV mutant does not alter RO development or morphology. While there may be divergence in the origins of enterovirus and cardiovirus ROs, the development of SMTs that transform into DMVs appears to be a common feature of both. We next investigated whether common requirements for RO biogenesis might also exist between enteroviruses and cardioviruses. Specific roles for the enterovirus host factor PI4KB, a PI4P-generating kinase, have recently been iden- Encephalomyocarditis Virus Replication Organelles ® tified. In addition to facilitating efficient polyprotein processing (20, (33) (34) (35) , PI4KB accelerates the formation of enterovirus ROs (20) . To investigate possible roles during EMCV RO formation of PI4KA, an essential PI4P-generating kinase for cardiovirus replication, we utilized the 3A-A32V mutant (26) . This mutant, generated through serial passaging of wild-type (wt) EMCV in cells with a stable knockdown of PI4KA, is capable of establishing replication even in the presence of the PI4KA inhibitor A1. At a concentration of 10 nM, this compound potently inhibits wt EMCV replication in HeLa cells, with no effect on cell viability (26) . In the absence of A1 treatment, infections by the EMCV 3A-A32V mutant in HeLa cells produced ROs whose morphology was indistinguishable from those of wt EMCV (Fig. S2) . SMTs and SMVs predominated at earlier time points, while DMVs were found only occasionally (Fig. S2A, asterisk) . Later in infection, DMVs proliferated and ROs became more clustered (Fig. S2B, DMVs indicated by asterisks) . Together, these results indicate that the 3A-A32V substitution does not affect RO development or the RO general architecture. PI4KA inhibition under A1 treatment led to a more clustered, perinuclear dsRNA signal compared to uninhibited infections with EMCV 3A-A32V or wt EMCV (Fig. 7A) (26) . Despite this different staining pattern under PI4KA inhibition, the morphology of ROs and time postinfection at which ROs were first detected were not affected. EMCV 3A-A32V infection under PI4KA inhibition produced single-and doublemembrane cardiovirus ROs (Fig. 7B , left, white arrowheads and asterisks, respectively), typically in proximity to the ER (black arrowheads). Importantly, while the clustered dsRNA signal found under inhibition partially localized in the perinuclear Golgi region (Fig. S3) , connections between single-membrane ROs and the ER were still found (Fig. 7B , right, white arrowheads), and ROs produced under PI4KA inhibition also retained their ability to support RNA synthesis (Fig. 7C) . Taken together, our data demonstrate that, while PI4KA/PI4P availability may govern the subcellular location of EMCV ROs, it does not significantly affect their emergence, morphology, or ability to serve as platforms for viral RNA synthesis.
