Four cases with active infection developed extensive bilateral lung infiltrates and respiratory failure ( Figure  1) . Three patients required ventilatory support, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy. All 3 patients requiring ventilator support expired due to multiorgan failure. The diagnosis of MERS CoV and treatment with ribavirin and IFN-a2b was delayed in these patients by an average of 14.7 days. Case 4, who tested positive for MERS CoV (and who survived), had bilateral lung infiltrates on chest x-ray with respiratory failure requiring noninvasive ventilator support. This patient was started on ribavirin and IFN-a2b, along with broad-spectrum antibiotics and methylprednisolone pulse therapy on the day of admission. He recovered without developing other organ system failures or hemodynamic compromise, and was discharged from the hospital in stable condition. Case 5, who was a close contact of Case 4, was empirically started on ribavirin and IFN-a2b after developing symptoms (Figure 2 ). She recovered with complete resolution of the lung infiltrate. Case 6 was a close contact of case 2, who tested positive for MERS CoV. He was asymptomatic, but showed a solitary infiltrate on CT scan of the chest (Figure  3 ). He was given empirical therapy with ribavirin and IFN-a2b. The patient remained asymptomatic, and a follow-up CT scan of the chest (Figure 3 ) was performed after 2 weeks, showing almost complete resolution of the lung infiltrate. Twenty-six family members of active MERS CoV cases and 28 health care workers who came in close contact with the active cases were screened for MERS CoV. Only 2 out of 54 persons screened (3.7%) were positive for MERS CoV. None of the positive contacts were health care workers.
