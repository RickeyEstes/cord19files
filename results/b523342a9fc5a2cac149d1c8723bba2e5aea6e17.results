Overall description of the recombinant PRRSV 3CLSP used in this study As a member of the Arteriviridae, PRRSV shows substantial similarities in genome organization to EAV-the prototype virus of this family. [13] [14] [15] Accordingly, whole genome bioinformatics analysis predicts that the PRRSV nsp4 domain should be the main protease responsible for processing most of polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. 15 Previously, we reported on the successful expression of a gene construct encoding this putative serine protease in Escherichia coli as well as the crystallization of the protein. 16 As shown in Fig. 1a , after removal of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag, nine additional amino acid residues were still left at the N-terminus of the protein. The in vitro peptide cleavage assay in this study was performed using this recombinant enzyme with the nine extra residues present, while for the cis cleavage assay, even more additional Nterminal residues were present (Fig. 1b) . In both cases, the recombinant protein displayed proteolytic activity in vitro, thereby confirming the identity of nsp4 as the main protease in PRRSV replication (see results below). Structure determination and quality of the refined structure Although the sequence identity between PRRSV and EAV nsp4s is more than 34%, we failed to solve the structure of PRRSV 3CLSP by molecular replacement (MR) using the structure of EAV nsp4 as a search model. The presence of two methionine residues in the recombinant PRRSV 3CLSP suggested that selenomethionine (SeMet)-based multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion 17 could be used to solve the phase problem. The unit-cell dimensions of the crystals (a = 112.4 Å, b = 49.2 Å, c = 42.9 Å, β = 110.3°; space group C2) indicate that there is only one molecule per asymmetric unit, and we successfully located both of the two crystallographically independent selenium sites. Based on the obtained phases, a final model with good stereochemistry was built (for details, see Materials and Methods). As shown in Table 1 , the structure was refined to 1.9 Å resolution, with R c r y s t = 19.6% and R free = 24.6%; 89.5% of the residues lie in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and 10.5% lie in the additionally allowed regions. 18 The quality of the electron density map of the recombinant protease at 1.9 Å is excellent, with an overall temperature factor of 22.2 Å 2 , and allowed us to model the positions of the main chain, most sidechain atoms, and 208 solvent molecules unambiguously. At the polypeptide chain termini, electron density is visible starting from residue 3 and ending at residue 199, but loop 136-140 is not seen in the maps due to disorder. The overall structure of PRRSV 3CLSP and comparison with EAV nsp4 The PRRSV 3CLSP is folded into three domains, including two antiparallel β-barrels and an extra Cterminal α/β domain ( Fig. 2a and b) . The Nterminal β-barrel (domain I) consists of six β-strands (aI to fI) and a short α-helix (helix A) that closes the barrel like a lid, whereas the middle β-barrel (domain II) comprises seven β-strands (aII to gII) and is connected to domain I via a very long loop (amino acids 69-89) (Fig. 2a) . The catalytic site is located at the opening of the cleft between domains I and II and consists of residues Ser118, His39, and Asp64 (Fig. 2a) , which are totally conserved among members of the Arteriviridae (Fig. 2c) . The extra Cterminal domain (domain III) comprises residues 157-199 and consists of two pairs of short antiparallel β-sheets (strands aIII-cIII and bIII-dIII) and two α-helices. The crossing angle is ∼ 90°between helix B and helix C (Fig. 2a) . A long N-terminal loop extends over domain II to the vicinity of domain III. The orientation of this loop is stabilized by the three hydrogen bonds Arg4 N…Glu100 OE1, Thr5 N… Val99 O, and Thr5 OG1…Val99 N (Fig. 2a) . The phenyl ring of Phe3 is directed into the hydrophobic interface between domains II and III and, therefore, also helps to stabilize the orientation of the Nterminal loop (Fig. 5a, left image) . (a) Overview of the proteolytic processing of PRRSV replicase. The rapid autocatalytic release of nsp1α, nsp1β, and nsp2 after translation of the ORF1a or ORF1ab is indicated. The rest of the junction sites are processed by nsp4. All the predicted cleavage sites are listed above the schematic boxes representing nsp1 to nsp12. Three of the putative cleavage sites were confirmed by our work. The rest of them were not evidenced to be processed in our study and therefore are labeled with a question mark on the top. The numerals indicated in each cleavage site are based on the genomic information of PRRSV strain JXA1 (GenBank accession no. EF112445). The recombinant protein for crystallization trials and in vitro peptide cleavage assay was produced using the GST fusion expression system (GE Healthcare). Nine extra N-terminal amino acid residues remained after removal of the GST tag. (b) The translational fusion proteins used in the cis cleavage assay. The red-colored portion indicates the additional residues introduced by the pET-28b vector. The eight N-terminal amino acid residues of nsp5 are colored pink and the Myc epitope is highlighted in blue. A Dali search 19 of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database gave a variety of proteins with significant structural similarities to our structure, among which the EAV nsp4 expectedly had the highest Z score (21.7). As the prototype structure of nsp4s in Arteriviridae, the EAV 3CLSP also folds into three domains. 12 Superposing domains I and II of PRRSV 3CLSP onto those of the EAV nsp4 (copy A of the four copies in the asymmetric unit) yielded an r.m.s.d. of 2.04 Å for 122 equivalent (out of 134 compared) C α pairs (Fig. 3a) , while domain III alone exhibited an r. m.s.d. of 0.52 Å for 30 (out of 38) C α pairs (Fig. 3d) , indicating that the two enzymes share great structural similarity at the tertiary level. However, the steric arrangement of the domains in the two proteases is quite different. An ∼8 Å shift of domain III relative to domains I and II was observed in our structure, when compared to EAV nsp4. This shift causes the whole domain III to move away from the cleft where the catalytic triad is located (Fig. 3a) . Clear electron density for the loop Asn153-Ile157 that connects domains II and III, as shown in Fig. 3c , leaves no doubt about the chain tracing of the loop and verifies the 8-Å shift of domain III, compared to EAV nsp4. The shift may also account for our failure to solve the structure by MR using EAV nsp4 as the search model. Further discrepancies were also observed in two loop regions. One is the loop connecting strands cII and dII (Cys111-Pro121 in PRRSV nsp4). In EAV nsp4, this loop is much like a tadpole with its head lying next to the catalytic nucleophile Ser120 (Fig.   3b ). However, the corresponding loop in our structure is approximately "⨼" shaped with a protuberance pointing to domain III ( Fig. 3a and b ) on which the hydrophobic side chain of Phe112 resides. This residue is conserved in PRRSV and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus 3CLSP but not in EAV nsp4, where it is substituted by Trp (Fig.  2c) . The phenyl ring of Phe112 protrudes into the hydrophobic interface between domains II and III (Fig. 5a , left image) and thereby causes the "⨼"shaped conformation of the cII-dII loop. Another loop of great variance is the one connecting strands eII and fII. In PRRSV 3CLSP, this loop is eight residues in length, from Gly135 to Gly142, and is highly flexible as proved by the total lack of electron density for residues 136-140. However, in EAV nsp4, the corresponding region is mainly a βstrand with a much shorter loop, indicating that the conformation of this part is relatively rigid (Fig. 3b) . Interestingly these two regions showing significant variance are actually believed to cover, respectively, the S1 specificity pocket and the oxyanion hole in EAV nsp4, 12 two highly important features involved in substrate recognition and catalysis by 3CL proteases. The S1 specificity pocket In 3CL proteases, the S1 specificity pocket accommodates the side chain of the substrate P1 residue and therefore determines the enzyme's  where I i is the observed intensity and 〈I〉 is the average intensity from multiple measurements. where F o and F c are the structure-factor amplitudes from the data and the model, respectively. R free is the R-factor for a subset (5%) of reflections that was selected prior to refinement calculations and was not included in the refinement. d Ramachandran plots were generated by using the program PROCHECK. The catalytic triad is indicated by red arrows, and the three residues that are believed to constitute the S1 specificity pocket in EAV nsp4 are marked with blue stars. The Phe residue, which is thought to lead to the atypical oxyanion hole in PRRSV 3CLSP, is labeled by a dark triangle. Cys111 and Cys115, which have been referred to in the text, are marked with black squares. LDVC and LDVP, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus neurovirulent type C and strain Plagemann, respectively; PRRSVAS and PRRSVES, PRRSV American strain and European strain, respectively. preference for specific amino acid residues at this position. To identify the possible residues that may be involved in the formation of the S1 pocket in PRRSV 3CLSP, we used the structure of Streptomyces griseus proteinase E (SGPE) in complex with a tetrapeptide as the reference structure for superposition. SGPE is another chymotrypsin-like proteinase that has a substrate preference for Glu at the P1 position. 20 Both the EAV nsp4 (copy A) and our structure were aligned. As shown in Fig. 4a , the S1 specificity pocket of both the SGPE and EAV nsp4 is composed of three residues, with a conserved His (His134 in EAV nsp4 and His213 in SGPE) lying at the bottom of the pocket and one Ser (EAV nsp4: Ser137; SGPE: Ser216) lining one side and another Thr/Ser (EAV nsp4: Thr115; SGPE: Ser192) located on the opposite side. However, only the histidine (His133) could be found in our structure. The first serine involved in the S1 subsite is conserved in PRRSV 3CLSP (Ser136) (Fig. 2c ), but we cannot define its position due to the absence of electron density for the loop 136-140 as mentioned before. Nevertheless, there is no residue in PRRSV nsp4 to match the Thr/Ser (Thr115 in EAV nsp4, Ser192 in SGPE) on the other side of the pocket. Thr113 of PRRSV nsp4, which is also highly conserved among members of Arteriviridae (Fig. 2c) , is too far away to contact the substrate P1 residue (Fig. 4a ). An atypical oxyanion hole without the signature helix-like turn Both EAV nsp4 and SGPE form a canonical oxyanion hole that is characterized by a helix-like turn preceding the nucleophilic serine. As shown in Fig. 4b , the backbone amides of Ser195 and Gly193 in SGPE can form hydrogen bonds with and therefore stabilize the carbonyl oxyanion in the tetrahedral intermediate during catalysis. Although, in EAV nsp4, only copy B has the normal active oxyanion hole geometry while the other three copies only form collapsed ones, this difference is mainly caused by flipping of the peptide bond between Ser117 and Gly118 rather than a big change of the orientation of the signature turn. 12 However, in PRRSV nsp4, this oxyanion-specific turn is missing. Instead, a much more stretched loop leaves only the amide group of the catalytic nucleophile (Ser118) in contact with the oxyanion. We term this rare property an atypical oxyanion hole.
