A total of 703 HCWs were recruited; 104 HCWs who reported receipt of pH1N1 vaccine were excluded from the following analyses. Among the 599 HCWs who reported that they had not received pH1N1 vaccine, 74 (12%) had pH1N1 antibody titre !1:40 by VN. In a random sample of 59/599 tested by HAI, 9 (15%) had antibody titre !1:40. There was a significant difference in the proportion of HCWs with antibody titre !1:40 by age, with greater proportion among younger HCWs, and by occupation, with greater proportion among doctors compared with nurses (Table I) . In a multivariate analysis, age remained significantly associated with an antibody titre !1:40 and HCWs working in the emergency room had a marginally significant higher probability of antibody titre !1:40 (P ¼ 0.06) (Table II) . Among the 599 HCWs, 19 (3.2%) reported laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 infection during the first wave, and 58% (95% CI: 34e80) of those 19 had antibody titre !1:40 by VN, and 74% (95% CI: 49e91) had antibody titre !1:40 by HAI. Among the 574 HCWs who did not report laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 infection, 11% (95% CI: 8.5e14) Table III shows the comparison of pH1N1 antibody seroprevalence in HCWs versus blood donors at the Hong Kong Red Cross involved in a separate community study. 4 There was no statistically significant difference in seroprevalence by age between HCWs and the community population in March 2010 apart from a marginally significant difference in HCWs aged 25e34 years (P ¼ 0.09). In a multivariate logistic regression model for the HCW and community data combined (assuming that none of the community blood donors were HCWs), the probability of antibody titre !1:40 varied significantly by age, but not by HCW status (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 0.94e2.08; P ¼ 0.09).
