ZNA probe-based real-time PCR amplification and the limit of detection Tenfold serial plasmid dilutions (10 1 to 10 6 copies/μl) were tested and used to construct the standard curve by plotting the logarithm of the plasmid copy number against the measured quantification cycles (Cq) values. The generated standard curve covered a linear range of six orders of magnitude of the standard plasmid DNA. The linear correlation (R 2 ) between the Cq and the logarithm of the plasmid copy number was 0.996 (slope = −3.91) (Figure 1 ). To assess the limit of detection of the assay, 10 0 to 10 6 copies/μl of standard plasmid DNA per reaction were tested in 10 replicates. At more than 100 copies, 100% of the replicates were positive, and at 10 copies, 6 (60%) of the replicates were positive (Table 1) . Reproducibility and specificity of the ZNA probe-based real-time PCR The coefficient of variation of the mean Cq values in the within-run and between-run for standard plasmid DNA precision experiments ranged from 0.52 to 1.87% and from 0.85 to 1.98%, respectively ( Table 2 ). The CV values in the within-run and between-run for clinical specimens that spanned the whole ranged from 0.43 to 4.70% and from 2.11 to 4.45%, respectively (Table 3) . We analyzed other swine viruses to test the specificity of the ZNA probebased real-time PCR. No specific amplifications were detected for any of these samples (data not shown).
