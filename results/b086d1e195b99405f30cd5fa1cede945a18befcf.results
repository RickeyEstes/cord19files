When using the consecutive method more animals were found negative for antibodies to BRV2 or had low blocking percentages (Table 1 ) . A higher P/N ratio was also noted between positive and negative reference sera, when tested in the consecutive ELISA method (4.431+0.426) as compared with the simultaneous method (4.021 + 0.513); this difference is significant (P< 0.001, n--30, Student's t-test). The correlation coefficient between the blocking percentages and the serum titers in the consecutive ELISA was 0.86 (P< 0.0001, Pearson's test; Fig. 1 ). As can be seen from Fig. 2 , the sera with blocking percentages of < 10 and > 90 do not follow the normal distribution pattern. Expressed in serum titers,
