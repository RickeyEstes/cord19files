One hundred eighty-six referrals were received during a 36-month period. Twenty-two patients were not admitted either because they refused care, their application was withdrawn, or they were not believed to be suitable for rehabilitation (Fig 1) . Of those not believed to be suitable for rehabilitation, 8 had ongoing acute medical problems, 2 were believed to have no rehabilitation goals, and 1 was known to the program from a previous admission and believed to have no motivation to improve. One patient was refused admission on the basis of infection control during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in Toronto. A total of 164 patients were admitted from 8 secondary or tertiary-care nephrology units in Toronto and 15 patients (9.1%) were admitted from home, whereas the remaining patients were admitted from acute care institutions (Fig 1) . The largest proportion was admitted after acute hospi-talization. Of these, 36 had required intensivecare therapy (eg, for calciphylaxis with sepsis requiring inotrope therapy, pneumonia with sepsis requiring inotrope therapy, end-stage liver cirrhosis with actively bleeding varices, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and deep-vein thrombosis, fungal peritonitis with bowel obstruction requiring surgical care, and vascular or cardiac bypass surgery with postoperative complications). Only 23 patients had "simple" reasons for Note: Values expressed as mean Ϯ SD, number (percent), or median (quartiles).

These included patients with vasculitis (n ϭ 3), myeloma (n ϭ 1), joint arthroplasty (n ϭ 1), tuberculous peritonitis (n ϭ 1), uncomplicated fungal peritonitis (n ϭ 2), and more common conditions, such as catheter sepsis, nausea and vomiting, fluid overload, and pneumonia. Patients had a mean age of 74.5 years (range, 58 to 92 years) at the time of admission. Most (51.2%) were women, 51.2% had diabetes, and 17.7% were not fluent in English (Table 1) . Thirty-four percent of patients had started hemodialysis therapy within 6 months of admission for rehabilitation. Before admission, 96.5% of all patients lived in a private home or apartment, and 3.6% lived in either an assisted-living or long-term-care setting. All patients had multiple comorbidities, with a mean of 7.9 Ϯ 2.4 comorbid conditions and Charlson comorbidity score of 7.8 Ϯ 2.5 (Table 1) . Serum chemistry test results suggested a high incidence of malnutrition and/or inflammation because 42.1% of patients had ferritin values of 223 ng/mL (g/L) or greater, 25.6% had a C-reactive protein level greater than the laboratory normal range (Ն13 mg/L), 20.1% had a serum albumin level of 3 g/dL or less (Յ30 mmol/L), and 17.1% had a hemoglobin level less than 9.5 mg/L (Ͻ95 g/L) despite therapy with an erythropoietic agent and iron. Median length of stay (LOS) was 48.5 days (quartiles, 32 to 72 days). Rehabilitation outcomes are listed in Table 2 . Admission FIM scores were available for all patients (mean score, 76.4 Ϯ 19.6; median, 77; range, 37 to 121; Table  3 ). To our surprise, admission scores did not change over time (Fig 2) . Discharge FIM scores were available for all except 2 individuals who had a planned discharge. Of 20 patients who were transferred to and did not return from acute care, FIM scores were available for only 9. Discharge FIM scores followed a skewed distribution, suggesting possible ceiling effects, 35 with a median score of 101.5 (quartiles, 81 to 114; range, 15 to 124). Mean change in FIM score was 21.5 Ϯ 16.1 (range, Ϫ24 to ϩ64). Eleven patients had no change in or worsening of their functional status despite rehabilitation therapy. Forty individuals were transferred to acute care, on 46 occasions. Thirty-six transfers were attributable to an acute medical illness (eg, myocardial infarction, sepsis, or gangrene) requiring hospitalization, 8 were for treatment of a dialysis access-related complication (eg, bleeding, thrombosis, or stenosis), and 2 patients were transferred to await palliative care. Eighteen patients did not return to rehabilitation after transfer. Of those who returned, median time in acute care was 7.5 days (quartiles, 3.3 to 12.0). One patient was kept in acute care for 79 days before his or her return.
