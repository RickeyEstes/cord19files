From 3702 CAP patients enrolled in the GLIMP study, 553 (14.9%) were tested for viruses (median age: 66 years; 57.3% males), (Table A1 in the data Appendix A and Fig. 1 ). A total of 157 patients out of 553 (28.4%) had at least one isolated virus ("swab positive" group). Influenza virus was isolated in 127/157 (80.9% of viral CAP) and formed the "Influenza CAP" group ( Fig. 1 ).
