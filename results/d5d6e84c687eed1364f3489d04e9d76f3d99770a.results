We detected FCoV in a purebred population of cats that had experienced a high rate of FIP over a 2-year period, with 12 cases of FIP in six litters. The FCoV infecting the population was analyzed, focusing on the 7a/7b ORF. This genomic region was chosen for analysis because of its speculated role in virulence (Vennema et al., 1992; Herrewegh et al., 1995; Vennema et al., 1998) . Amplification of FCoV RNA was successful in samples from nine cats. Seven of these were resident adults and included the sire and queens of affected offspring. Two were from kittens that died from FIP. Two distinct virus variants were found, one with an intact 7a ORF and one with two deletions in the 7a ORF (Fig. 1) . The deletions encompassed nucleotides 20-120 and nucleotides 164-226 of the 7a gene. Four additional nucleotides (TCTT) were present in all of the deletion mutants at the position corresponding to nucleotide 227 of the undeleted virus. The protein predicted from the nucleotide sequence contains different amino acids in the 3 0 one-half of the predicted protein due to the altered reading frame caused by the second deletion (Fig. 2) . It is not known if the 7a protein predicted from the nucleotide sequence is expressed in the deletion mutant virus. The remainder of the 7a/7b ORF was highly conserved among all isolates, including the region encoding the 7b ORF (Fig. 3) . Interestingly, amino acid residues 202 and 203 of the predicted 7b protein were histidine and lysine. This is contrary to the findings of Vennema et al. (1998) that FIP viruses contained tyrosine and lysine at these positions whereas putative avirulent FCoV contained histidine and arginine. Both virus variants were identified in one cat, the sire ''Dan'', as sequence analysis of clones from a single PCR from this animal revealed the presence of the 7a deletion mutant as well as the intact isolate (Dan 1 and 2 in Fig. 2 ). This cat was PCR-positive for virus in multiple samples and may be persistently infected with FCoV. He was also the sire of all the FIP victims in the first 18 months of the study. Litters resulting from the breeding of this sire to his daughters from previous litters experienced morbidity and mortality of 75-100% within the litter (n ¼ 4). During the last 6 months of the FIP outbreak, a new sire was used and bred to the original sire's daughters. Morbidity and mortality has since decreased to 0-25% within litters (n ¼ 4), with the last case occurring in spring of 1999. Amplification of FCoV 7a/7b ORF from the most recent cases of FIP (n ¼ 4) have not been successful. Fig. 4 shows the phylogenic relationship among the virus isolates resulting from nucleotide sequence alignments. The two distinct variants are clearly delineated. The deletion mutants show a very close similarity to one another and form a closely related cluster.
