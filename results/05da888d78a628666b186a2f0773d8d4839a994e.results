The number of pens on each farm varied from two to five (Table 1) . Pens on each farm had broilers of different age groups. Median numbers of broilers on study farms in Santa Cruz and San Cristobal were 1950 (minimum = 1300, maximum = 5200) and 3000 (1050, 6400), respectively. Median duration of the production cycle on study farms was 42 days on Santa Cruz (42, 42) and 42 days on San Cristobal (42, 60). Median mortality (%) per cycle on study farms was 1.5% on Santa Cruz (0.9, 2.4) and 3.0% on San Cristobal (0.9, 5.0). The main causes of mortality in broilers reported by farm managers were dehydration during the first week of age or heat stress after the first three weeks of age (2/6 farms on Santa Cruz and 2/7 farms on San Cristobal) and heart attack during the fifth and sixth weeks of age (2/6 farms on Santa Cruz and 3/7 farms on San Cristobal). All study farms had ! 1 broilers classified as seropositive to IBDV (Table 2) . Overall, the frequency of broilers with positive antibody titers to IBDV was 26/60 or 43% (95% CI = 32, 56%) on Santa Cruz and 48/70 = 69% (57, 78%) on San Cristobal. In addition, three of six farms on Santa Cruz and one of seven farms on San Cristobal had ! 1 broilers classified as seropositive to IBV; the frequency of broilers with positive antibody titers to IBV was 22/60 or 37% (26, 49%) on Santa Cruz and 5/70 = 7% (3, 16%) on San Cristobal. One of six farms on Santa Cruz had one broiler classified as seropositive to NDV (S/P ratio = 0.25). All broilers tested negative to MG antibodies. Overall, two of six farms on Santa Cruz and six of seven farms on San Cristobal had evidence of exposure to Eimeria spp (Table 3 ; Fig 1) . In addition, two of 26 harvested broilers had intestinal tract lesions. On Santa Cruz (Farm A), one of two broilers examined contained mild lesions of the proximal duodenal mucosa (i.e., petechiae, white spots); however, no oocysts were observed on fecal flotation. On Farm F, one of two broilers examined had presence of blood and mucus in the cecum.
