The lower detection limit of pH1N1 ELISA for viral isolates Seven pH1N1 viral isolates were two-fold serially diluted and tested by pH1N1 ELISA. The lower detection limit was determined as 10 3.0 ± 0.4 tissue culture infective dose (TCID) 50 /mL (or 0.009 ± 0.005 HA titer) ( Table 2 ). Evaluating the cross-reactions of pH1N1 ELISA Seventy-eight strains of influenza A virus (non-pH1N1, H1-H13 subtypes), 20 strains of influenza B virus and 15 types of other common respiratory pathogen were tested by pH1N1 ELISA; all were negative except for one bird strain of influenza A/H1N9 (A/WDK/Shantou/520/2000), for which the viral titre was higher than 16 HA (approximately 1800-fold higher than the lower detection limit of the assay) (Tables 3 and 4 ).
