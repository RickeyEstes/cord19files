Clinical and laboratory data were available for 252 children; we estimate that this represents approximately 95% of all children seen in the school clinic who met the criteria for AFI. We identified 223 AFI cases per 1000 child-years of observation, which is marginally less than the 235 cases per 1000 child-years that was observed in 2012-2013 [11] . Eighty-two children had a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of CHIKV infection. Among these, 8 were infected with multiple viruses, including 6 with dual CHIKV-ZIKV, 1 with dual CHIKV-DENV2, and 1 with dual CHIKV and Mayaro virus (MAYV) infection (previously reported in [19] ). Other infections identified included DENV1 (n = 24; 2 dual infections), DENV4 (n = 32), ZIKV (n = 9; 6 dual infections with CHIKV, as noted above, and 1 dual infection with DENV1 [13] ), MAYV (n = 2; 1 dual infection with CHIKV, as noted above, and 1 dual infection with DENV1 [14] ), coronavirus NL63 (n = 4 [15] ), and enterovirus D68 (n = 1 [12] ). As shown in Figure 2 , major AFI peaks were seen in June 2014, October and November 2014 and January 2015. CHIKV infections accounted for virtually all of the May-July AFI cases, consistent with the time that the CHIKV epidemic was known to be moving through Haiti. The staff at the school clinic initially assumed that the October-November AFI peaks reflected recurrence of CHIKV. However, at laboratory analysis we identified a cluster of DENV1 cases, followed by a small ZIKV cluster in December [14] . However, we were not able to find an cause for the majority of AFI cases in this time period, despite the use of viral culture techniques; work on identification of other possible etiologic agents for AFI cases in this time period continues. Finally, the January 2015 peak seems to have been due largely to an outbreak of DENV4 infection. Study population demographics, including age, sex, school location, and grade are presented in Table 1 , along with demographic-specific ARs for AFI. Students in kindergarten had an AR of 39% (95% CI, 33%-44%), which was significantly greater than those in primary school students (15%; 12%-18%), and secondary school students (20%; 15%-26%). Kindergarteners also represented >45% of the students with AFI, but only 21% of the total cohort. Pathogen-specific ARs along with their associated 95% CIs are presented in Table 2 by demographic categories. Of note, students in school A (AR, 9%; 95% CI, 7%-11%) had a significantly higher AR for CHIKV than those in school D (1%; 0%-2%). The proportion of positive cases of each pathogen with specific symptoms is presented in Table 3 . By definition, all children in the study had a history of fever; those with a measured temperature of >37Â°C when seen in the clinic were included in the category of "fever at visit. " Compared with patients with CHIKV, a significantly greater proportion of patients who tested positive for "any DENV" experienced abdominal pain, whereas patients with CHIKV had significantly higher rates of arthralgia and myalgia than those with any DENV. Supplementary Table 1 presents the localization of arthralgias by infection outcome for patients with confirmed CHIKV only and dual CHIKV-ZIKV infection: arthralgias in CHIKV-only patients were most common in the knee (48.9%), wrist (44.7%), and ankle (36.2%). Table 4 shows the results from the 4 stepwise logistic regression models that were performed for variable selection for each of the 4 outcomes of interest. Of note, no single variable was included in every model. Individuals aged 10-14 year or older had significantly greater odds of CHIKV infection than 3-4-year-olds (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4-9.8). In addition, patients with AFI who had arthralgia had 16.2-fold increased odds of CHIKV infection (95% CI, 8.0-34.4) compared with patients with AFI who did not present with arthralgia, after adjusting for age category and sex. Although the number of cases was small, the presence of myalgia was significantly associated with increased odds of dual CHIKV-ZIKV infection (odds ratio, 6.5; 95% CI, 1.2-47.6), compared with the absence of myalgia The variables selected for each pathogen model were then used in additional logistic regression models for each outcome Table 2 ). The mean area under the ROC curve was 0.80 (SD, 0.05; IQR, 0.7-0.83; Supplementary Figure 1 ). In an additional model that predicted the binary CHIKV outcome as a function of presence of arthralgia without any demographic covariates, the PPV was 56% (SD, 0.05; IQR, 0.53-0.60; data not shown). Results from the K-means cluster analysis for all symptoms with 4 clusters are shown in Supplementary Figure 2 , and the cluster assignments by participant infection status are presented in Supplementary Table 3 . All patients in cluster 1 experienced arthralgia, leg pain, and ankle pain, and >75% experienced myalgia. Twenty-eight of the CHIKV cases were grouped into cluster 3, which also contained the vast majority of "no pathogen identified" patients and all with DENV4; patients in this cluster experienced low rates of all symptoms except abdominal pain (approximately 40%) and headache (approximately 25%). Eighteen of the 23 patients grouped into cluster 4 had CHIKV only. Patients in this cluster experienced a wide variety of clinical symptoms, including very high rates of arthralgia, leg pain, knee pain, and myalgia.
