"LbSapSal" immunization induced increased levels of IFN-γ before and after experimental L. chagasi-challenge Aiming to verify whether the immunization protocols were able to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we evaluated the profiles of TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-12 in CC or upon VSA or SLcA-stimuli in vitro. No significant differences were observed amongst the experimental groups at baseline (T 0 ) ( Fig 1A, 1B and 1C, upper panel) . Data analysis performed at (T 3rd ) post-vaccination did not show any differences in the TNF-α levels amongst the experimental groups, regardless the culture conditions. Analysis of IL-12 demonstrated that the "LbSapSal" group displayed increased levels (P<0.05) upon VSAstimulation as compared with the same cultures in the "Control", "Sal", and "LbSal" groups ( Fig 1B, middle panel) . Moreover, the "LbSal" group showed reduced IL-12 levels (P<0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared with the "Control" group ( Fig 1B, middle panel) . Interestingly, the analysis of IFN-γ showed that "LbSapSal" group presented increased levels (P<0.05) in CC as compared to the "Control" group ( Fig 1C, middle panel) . Additionally, "LbSapSal" group displayed increased IFN-γ levels (P<0.05) upon VSA and SLcA-stimuli in comparison with "Control", "Sal", and "LbSal" groups ( Fig 1C, middle panel) .

In addition, the "LbSapSal" group displayed higher levels of TNF-α (P<0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared with "LbSal" group ( Fig 1A, bottom  panel) . No differences in the IL-12 levels were observed amongst the experimental groups, regardless the culture conditions. Interestingly, the analysis of IFN-γ revealed that "LbSapSal" and late (885 days-T 885 ) after experimental L. chagasi-challenge. The groups are represented as follows: C ("Control"; white bars); "Sal" (Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary glands; light gray bars); "LbSal" (antigen of L. braziliensis plus Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary glands; dark gray bars); and "LbSapSal" (L. braziliensis antigen plus saponin and Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary glands; black bars). The x-axis displays the different experimental groups ("Control", "Sal", "LbSal", and "LbSapSal") according to the in vitro stimuli (control culture [CC], VSA or SLcA). The y-axis represents the cytokine levels (pg/mL) for TNF-α (A), IL-12 (B) and IFN-γ (C). Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviations. The connecting lines represent significant difference (P <0.05) between the CC, VSA or SLcA-stimulated cultures. The symbols C, Sal and LbSal indicate significant differences in comparison to the "Control", "Sal" and "LbSal" groups, respectively. group showed higher levels (P<0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared with the "Control", "Sal" and "LbSal" groups ( Fig 1C, bottom panel) . "LbSapSal" induced lower levels of IL-4 and TGF-β but while unvaccinated dogs presented higher amounts of IL-10 after L. chagasichallenge Aiming to evaluate whether the immunization protocols would induce regulatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines, we further quantified the levels of IL-10, IL-4, and TGF-β upon VSA or SLcA-stimuli in vitro. No significant differences were observed amongst the experimental groups at baseline (T 0 ) (Fig 2B, upper panel) . The results observed at the post-vaccination period (T 3rd ) demonstrated that the "LbSal" group showed a significant reduction in the IL-10 levels (P<0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared to the "Sal" group ( Fig 2B, middle panel) . No differences in IL-4 and TGF-β levels were observed amongst the experimental groups, regardless the culture conditions. Data mining performed early after L. chagasi-challenge (T 90 ) revealed no differences in the IL-10 production amongst the experimental groups, regardless the culture conditions. However, "LbSapSal" group showed a significant reduction of IL-4 levels (P<0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared to the "Sal" group (Fig 2A, middle panel) . Interestingly, "LbSapSal" group also presented a significant reduction of TGF-β levels (P<0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared the "Control" group (Fig 3, middle panel) . Analysis carried out late after L. chagasi-challenge (T 885 ) did not differences in IL-10 levels amongst the experimental groups, regardless the culture conditions. The results showed that the "LbSal" group presented a significant reduction in the IL-4 levels (P<0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared with the "Sal" group ( Fig 2B, bottom panel) . Interestingly, "LbSapSal" group displayed a significant reduction of TGF-β levels (P<0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared with the "Control" group (Fig 3, bottom panel) . The hallmark of the cytokine network in the "LbSapSal" group is a balanced immune response regarding positive correlation between proinflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α) and regulatory cytokines (IL-10) Aiming to identify the overall balance of the evaluated cytokines, we have applied machinelearning approaches to analyze the cytokine network for all immunization protocols generated upon SLcA and VSA-stimuli in vitro (S1 Fig and Fig 4) . The cytokine balance was calculated as the IFN-γ/IL-4 and IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio for all experimental groups and culture conditions and data provide in the S1 Fig. The results re-enforce that ability of "LbSapSal" vaccine to induce a long lasting IFN-production over the synthesis of both IL-4 and IL-10, regardless the antigen-stimuli (S1 Fig). Data mining by system biology tools were used to generate biomarker networks for each experimental group using both VSA and SLcA-stimuli. The results demonstrated that upon VSA-stimulation, the "Control" group presented negative correlations between IL-4 with TNFα and IL-10 (VSA stimulus). Positive correlation was also observed between TNF-α and IFN-γ. Upon SLcA-stimulation, positive correlation was observed between IL-12 and IFN-γ along with a negative correlation between TNF-α and IL-4 (Fig 4, upper left panel) . The "Sal" group presented, upon VSA-stimulation, a range of positive correlations, including TNF-α with IL-12, IFN-γ and IL-10 along IL-12 with IL-10. In addition, negative correlation was observed between IFN-γ and IL-4. Analysis upon SLcA-stimulation demonstrated Data were analyzed at baseline before vaccination (T 0 ), 15 days after third immunization dose (T 3rd ) as well as early (90 days-T 90 ) and late (885 days-T 885 ) after experimental L. chagasi-challenge.The groups are represented as follows: C ("Control"; white bars); "Sal" (Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary glands; light gray bars); "LbSal" (antigen of L. braziliensis plus Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary glands; dark gray bars); and "LbSapSal" (L. braziliensis antigen plus saponin and Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary glands; black bars). The x-axis displays the different experimental groups ("Control", "Sal", "LbSal", and "LbSapSal") according to the in vitro stimuli (control culture [CC], VSA or SLcA). The y-axis represents the cytokine levels (pg/mL) for IL-4 (A) and IL-10 (B). Data are presented as mean values ± standard deviations. The connecting lines represent significant difference (P <0.05) between the CC, VSA or SLcA-stimulated cultures. The symbol Sal indicates significant differences in comparison to the "Sal" group. positive correlations amongst the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-12) along positive correlation of them with IL-10 (Fig 4, upper right panel) . Analysis of the "LbSal" group upon VSA-stimulation demonstrated a single negative correlation between TNF-α and IL-4 (Fig 4, bottom left panel) . "LbSapSal" (L. braziliensis antigen plus saponin and Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary glands; black bars).The xaxis displays the different experimental groups ("Control" and "LbSapSal") according to the in vitro stimuli (control culture [CC] and SLcA).

The connecting lines represent significant difference (P <0.05) between the CC or SLcA-stimulated cultures. The symbol C indicates significant differences in comparison to the "Control" group. Data analysis demonstrated that upon VSA-stimulation, the "LbSapSal" group showed strong positive correlation among TNF-α and IFN-γ along with positive correlation between TNF-α and IL-10. Negative correlations were also observed amongst TNF-α and IFN-γ with IL-4 (Fig 4, bottom right panel) . Moreover, upon SLcA-stimulation, positive correlation was observed between IL-12 with IFN-γ and IL-10 (Fig 4, bottom right panel) . A sustained prominent reduction in spleen parasite load was observed in "LbSapSal" group later on after L. chagasi-challenge The parasitological analysis performed in spleen samples later on (T 885 ) following L. chagasichallenge and reported as number of L. chagasi organisms/20ng of total DNA in spleen samples and presented in Table 1 . Data analysis demonstrated that all vaccination protocols were able The groups are represented as follows: "Control"; "Sal" (salivary glands of Lutzomyia longipalpis); "LbSal" (antigen of L. braziliensis plus Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary glands) and "LbSapSal" (antigen of L. braziliensis plus saponin and Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary glands). The letter "a" indicate significant difference in relation to the Sal, LbSal and LbSapSal groups. Reduction (%) in parasite load was calculated as the proportion of number of amastigotes organisms/20ng of total DNA observed in "Sal", "LbSal" and "LbSapSal" groups in relation to "Control" group. No clinical signs and mortality were observed throughout the experimental design. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0161169.t001 to induce a reduction in the splenic parasite load as compared to the "Control group". Indeed, "Sal" and "LbSal" groups yielded 74.6% and 66.5% of reduction in the spleen parasite load (1.56 and 2.06 amastigotes/20ng of total DNA, respectively) as compared to the "Control" group (6.14 amastigotes/20ng of total DNA). "LbSapSal" groups showed the lowest parasite load (1.30 amastigotes/20ng of total DNA), leading to 78.9% of reduction rate in relation to the "Control" group (Table 1) . Moreover, no clinical signs and mortality were observed throughout the experimental design (Table 1) . "LbSapSal" group showed after L. chagasi-challenge enhanced NO production with negative association with the spleen parasite load The levels of nitric oxide produced by PBMCs were evaluated upon VSA or SLcA-stimuli in vitro early (T 90 ) and late (T 885 ) after L. chagasi-challenge. Data analysis carried early (T 90 ) after L. chagasi-challenge, demonstrated that the "LbSap-Sal" group presented upon control culture condition enhanced NO levels (P<0.05) as compared to the "Sal" group ( Fig 5, upper left panel) . Additionally, "Sal", and "LbSapSal" groups showed increase in the NO levels (P<0.05) upon VSA-stimulation as compared to the "Control" and "LbSap" groups ( Fig 5, upper left panel) . The analysis performed late (T 885 ) after L. chagasi-challenge showed the "LbSapSal" group displayed higher NO levels (P<0.05) upon SLcA-stimulation as compared to the "Control" group ( Fig 5, upper right panel) . Additional analysis revealed that the NO production at T 885 displayed a negative correlation with the spleen parasite load selectively upon SLcA-stimulation (Fig 5, bottom right panel) . Interestingly, it was observed that in the "LbSapSal" group, four out of five animals (80%) showed simultaneous high NO production and low spleen parasite load, compatible with a protection profile (Fig 5, bottom right panel) . In contrast, in the "Control" group, only one out of five (20%) showed high NO production but all animals presented high spleen parasitism (Fig 5, bottom right panel) .
