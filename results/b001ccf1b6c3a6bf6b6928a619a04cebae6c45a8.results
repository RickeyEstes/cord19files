Mice Deficient in cGAS, STING, MDA5, MAVS, or IRF3 Are Resistant to YM Infection Since the role of TLRs in defending against different malaria species remains controversial (Baccarella et al., 2013; Gowda et al., 2012; Togbe et al., 2007) , we first investigated whether TLRs and their downstream signaling molecules play a role in controlling lethal YM infection. We infected Tlr2 À/À , Tlr3 À/À , Tlr4 À/À , Tlr7 À/À , Tlr9 À/À , Ticam1 À/À (coding for TRIF), Myd88 À/À , and WT mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of YM-iRBCs. We found that WT and genetically deleted mice died within 8 days after infection ( Figures 1A-1C and S1A-S1D). Notably, Tlr7 À/À and Myd88 À/À mice showed increased parasitemia and died sooner after infection than WT mice, suggesting that TLR7 and MyD88 may play a role in the control of parasitemia and host mortality. To test whether RNA and DNA sensor-mediated type I IFN signaling plays a role in host immune responses to YM infection, we infected Mb21d1 À/À (coding for cGAS), Tmem173 gt (coding for STING), Ifih1 À/À (coding for MDA5), and Mavs À/À mice with YM. We found that these genetically ablated mice remarkably reduced parasitemia compared with WT mice. Tmem173 gt , Ifih1 À/À , and Mavs À/À mice were completely resistant to YM infection, whereas Mb21d1 À/À mice showed partial protection ( Figures 1D-1G) . Furthermore, YM infection was completely cleared in Ifih1 À/À , Mavs À/À , and Tmem173 gt mice within 4 weeks ( Figure S1F ). However, mice with ablation of the Ddx58 gene (coding for RIG-I) showed no difference in malaria parasitemia and host death, compared with WT mice ( Figure S1E ). IRF3 is a key factor for stimulating type I IFN signaling for IFN-b production in almost all cell types, whereas IRF7 is responsible for activating type I IFN signaling to produce IFN-a/b only in pDCs (Liu, 2005; Wang et al., 2011) . Infection of Irf3 À/À and Irf7 À/À mice with YM revealed that Irf3 À/À mice, but not Irf7 À/À mice, remarkably reduced parasitemia and were resistant to YM infection ( Figures  1H and 1I ). Collectively, these results suggest that activation of cGAS-STING and MDA5-MAVS-mediated IRF3-dependent type I IFN signaling leads to a lethal phenotype of YM infection. Identification of cGAS as a Malaria DNA Sensor and Robust Production of IFN-a/b in cGAS-, STING-, MDA5-, or MAVS-Deficient Mice To understand how cGAS-, STING-, MDA5-, and MAVS-deficient mice were resistant to YM infection, we first determined whether cGAS and MDA5 functioned as DNA or RNA sensors for detecting YM genomic DNAs (gDNAs) or RNAs. We found that both purified YM gDNA and RNA could induce IFN-b mRNA expression in RAW264.7 cells ( Figure S1G ), which is in agreement with other studies showing that malaria RNA can be detected by a MDA5 sensor (Liehl et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014) . As expected, in vitro stimulation with YM gDNA or RNA showed impaired or completely abolished activation of IFN-b mRNA and protein in bone-marrow-derived conventional DCs (cDCs) from MDA5-, MAVS-, and STING-deficient mice compared to cDCs from WT mice ( Figure S1H ). Although STING has been shown to play an important role in the host response to AT-rich malarial DNA (Sharma et al., 2011) , it is not clear which DNA sensors are responsible for recognizing YM gDNA and activating STINGmediated type I IFN signaling. To this end, we transfected 293T-STING stable cells with plasmids containing the gene encoding one of four putative DNA sensors (cGAS, DAI, DDX41, or IFI16) followed by YM gDNA stimulation. Ectopic expression of Mb21d1, but not Zbp1, Ddx41, or Ifi203, induced IFN-b mRNA expression after YM gDNA treatment ( Figure 1J ). Consistently, silencing of Mb21d1, but not Zbp1, Ddx41, or Ifi203, by specific siRNAs in RAW264.7 cells markedly reduced IFN-b mRNA and protein after YM gDNA treatment ( Figures 1K, 1L , and S1I), suggesting that cGAS functions as a DNA sensor for detecting YM gDNA and inducing STING-mediated type I IFN signaling. Previous studies showed that type I IFN signaling inhibits type II IFN (IFN-g) or adaptive immune responses upon malaria and viral infection (Haque et al., 2011; Palomo et al., 2013; Teijaro et al., 2013; Teles et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2013) . To this end, we examined the serum amounts of IFN-a/b, IL-6, and IFN-g in WT mice during YM infection and found that these cytokines were increased and peaked at 24 hr post infection and then completely disappeared in WT mice ( Figure S1J ). However, the serum amounts of IFN-a/b, IL-6, and IFN-g in MDA5-, MAVS-, STING-, and cGAS-deficient mice were much higher than in (M) WT and indicated deficient mice were infected with YM. Serum amounts of IFN-a/b, IL-6, and IFN-g were determined by ELISA. Data are representative of three independent experiments and are plotted as the mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus corresponding control. NS, not significant. See also Figure S1 . WT mice at 24 hr after YM infection ( Figure 1M ), suggesting that MDA5, MAVS, STING, or cGAS deficiency enhances type I IFN production in vivo after YM infection.
