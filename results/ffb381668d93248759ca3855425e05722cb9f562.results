HCoV-NL63 was detected in 28 (9.3%) of the 300 samples evaluated from November 2002 to April 2003. Twenty-two samples were positive for HCoV-NL63 by both simple and multiplex RT-PCR (Figure 1 ). Discordant results were found for the remaining 6 samples: 3 were positive only in simple RT-PCR, and 3 were positive only in multiplex RT-PCR. These discordant samples were controlled by using the same methods from the RNA extraction product; the results obtained were identical. The specificity of the RT-PCR products under UV was confirmed by hybridization. Multiplex RT-PCR identified 3 samples with HCoV-OC43 and 1 sample with both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43. The 28 HCoV-NL63-positive samples were obtained from 18 patients <2 years of age (65%), 4 patients 2-5 years of age (14%), and 6 patients 6-15 years of age (21%). The age distribution of the patients infected by HCoV-NL63 was identical to the age Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 11, No. 8, August 2005 distribution of the sample. Positive specimens were collected throughout the study period; no epidemic was observed. The temporal distribution of HCoV-NL63 infection is shown in Figure 2 . All patients included in this study had a respiratory tract illness. The medical reports of 18 patients with HCoV-NL63-positive samples were retrospectively examined, and the following symptoms were noted: fever (61%, n = 11), rhinitis (39%, n = 7), lower respiratory tract illness (bronchiolitis, pneumonia [39%, n = 7]), digestive problems (diarrhea and abdominal pain [33%, n = 6]), otitis (28%, n = 5), pharyngitis (22%, n = 4), and conjunctivitis (17%, n = 3). One patient had severe underlying disease (congenital immunodeficiency) and had upper respiratory tract illness with fever, another had a family history of atopic allergy, and pneumonia was diagnosed. Overall, more than one third of the patients infected by HCoV-NL63 had severe lower respiratory tract infection (6 bronchiolitis and 1 pneumonia). All of them recovered completely. To determine if the isolates from France contain different genetic markers, we sequenced a part of the S protein gene of 12 isolates for molecular analysis. The phylogenetic analysis shows that the isolates from France are a divergent group containing sequences with different markers. One isolate (23034101) had characteristics of an outlier ( Figure 3A) . The phylogenetic analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence also shows that this isolate is an outlier ( Figure 3B ). However, the branches of this tree are based on only 1 amino acid difference. Care should be taken because of the limited informative sites in the sequence.
