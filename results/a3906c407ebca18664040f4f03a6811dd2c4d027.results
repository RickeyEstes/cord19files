Expression and purification of recombinant proteases. To obtain an adequate amount of proteases for enzymatic characterization, we expressed the TV and a NoV (the Norwalk virus) proteases as the GST or histidine (His) tagged fusion proteins, as suggested by Zeitler et al. (Zeitler et al., 2006) . Both the GST-and His-tag proteins were soluble and readily purified using nondenaturing affinity purification methods. The purified enzymes appeared homogeneous by the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and FPLC analyses (Fig. 1 ). Purified proteases with the His-tag or after removal of the GST tag appeared as monomers in solution for both TV and Norwalk virus proteases by comparison with the chymotrypsinogen A standard (molecular weight of 20.4 kDa) in the FPLC analysis (data not shown). Proteolytic cleavage between the helicase and 3A-like protein. To facilitate the proteolitic analysis of TV polyprotein, recombinant protein fragments containing different regions of the polyprotein were produced. To analyze the cleavage site between the helicase and 3A-like protein, the coding region for amino acid residues 495 to 795 was expressed as a MBP fusion protein (79.7 kDa; Fig. 2A, F2 ). Proteolytic cleavage of this protein by the TV protease yielded four major bands at approximately 54 kDa, 45 kDa, 30 kDa, and 16 kDa respectively. Two of which were readily detected by a TV 3A-like protein specific antibody in a Western blot analysis: a $30 kDa fragment was likely to contain the 3A-like protein-VpG, while the 16 kDa fragment was the 3Alike protein (Fig. 2B , lane 5). The identity of the 3A-like protein-VpG fragment was further confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The resulting amino acid sequence ''SDEYP'' was identical to the expected N-terminus of the functional 3A-like protein. Proteolytic cleavage between the 3A-like protein and Vpg. Due to a small size upon the cleavage by protease, the Vpg protein (10.8 kDa) is difficult to isolate from a PAGE gel for N-terminal sequencing analysis. Hence, a double fusion protein containing a protein fragment from amino acid residues 632 to 779 with the predicted cleavage site flanked by the MBP and GST at the N-and C-termini, respectively ( Fig. 2A, F3 ) was expressed. Proteolytic cleavage of this protein by the TV protease yielded a 42 kDa band that was expected to be the MBP, a 32 kDa protein of the VpG-GST fusion protein, and an unknown band of $ 19 kDa (Fig. 2C) . The N-terminal sequencing of the 32 kDa protein revealed a sequence ''AKGKT'' that was the expected N-terminal sequences of the VpG-GST fusion protein. Proteolytic cleavage between Vpg and the protease. The TV polyprotein fragment containing the cleavage site between Vpg and protease was fused to MBP at the N-terminus ( Fig. 2A, F4 ). To prevent potential auto-cleavage of the protease, we replaced residue C134 with an A134 at the catalytic site of the protease. Since the cleaved protease fragment from F4 would be the same size as the active protease in trans, we fused GST to the C-terminus of the protease. Upon cleavage, two cleavage products, the 52.2 kDa MBP-VpG C-terminus and the 44.7 kDa protease-GST, were produced. N-terminal sequencing analysis of the 44.7 kDa fragment resulted in a perfect match to all of three amino acid residues detected with the predicted N-terminal sequence of TV protease (Fig. 3A) . Proteolytic cleavage between the protease and RdRp. The TV polyprotein fragment containing the cleavage site between the protease and RdRp ( Fig. 2A, F5 ) was fused to GST at the N-terminus. The cleavage of the 96.9 kDa F5 fragment was expected to generate at least five smaller fragments: the 52.9 kDa RdRp, the 18 kDa protease, the 70.9 kDa protease-RdRp, the 44 kDa GST-protease, and the 26 kDa GST. The N-terminus sequencing of the 52.9 kDa fragment (RdRp) showed a perfect match of the first five amino acid residues GKTTY ( Fig. 3B) with that of the predicted RdRp. Proteolytic cleavage between the NTP and helicase proteins. We have also attempted to express a protein fragment containing the protease cleavage site between the N-terminal protein and helicase protein using similar fusion expression strategies ( Fig. 2A, F1 ). Unfortunately, despite tremendous efforts, we were unable to express any protein fragment containing the C-terminal portion of the N-terminal protein in either GST-or MBP-fusion, or his-tagged forms. Characterization of the enzymatic activities of the TV and Norwalk virus proteases with fluorogenic peptide substrates. As demonstrated in the above polyprotein cleavage analysis, E.coli-expressed proteases remain active upon purification, which makes possible to develop an in vitro antiviral screening system. To this end, we evaluated the Norwalk virus protease activities and the TV protease activities using synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrates NVS1 and TVS2 (Fig. 4A ). In the presence of 2 nM NVS1, as shown in Fig. 4 (B), a dose response of enzyme activities was observed in the reactions containing less than 5 mM of protease, which was followed by a plateau at protease concentrations between 5 and 20 uM. A similar fluorescence emission profile was also observed when the fluorogenic peptide substrate TVS2 was hydrolyzed by TV protease (Fig. 4C ). These results indicate that Hylite Fluor 488/QXL520-labled peptide substrates are ideal for measuring recombinant Norwalk virus and TV protease activities. To determine the optimal reaction conditions for Norwalk virus protease activity assay, we also performed the assays at various pH, salt, glycerol and DMSO concentrations. At a constant ionic strength (50 mM NaCl), the optimal pH for proteolytic cleavage of Norwalk virus protease was found to be pH 8.5 (Fig. 5A ), similar to that reported previously for NoV and for the NS3 protease of Dengue-2 virus (Leung et al., 2001) . The Norwalk virus protease activities decreased significantly as the NaCl concentration rose (from 50 mM to 300 mM, Fig. 5B ). In contrast, glycerol in the reaction solution seemed to promote protease activities (Fig. 5C ). Based on these observations, we used this buffer condition (50 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 20% glycerol, and 1 mM DTT) for all of our protease activity assays. DMSO at concentrations less than 10% did not affect either the Norwalk virus or TV protease activities. The TV and Norwalk virus proteases can partially cleavage heterologous substrates. Although the TV and NoV proteases share less than 27% amino acid sequence identity, the catalytic triads are highly conserved (Fig. 6A) , indicating that the TV and NoV proteases may be able to process each other's polyprotein substrates. To test this hypothesis, we incubated the TV and Norwalk virus proteases with each other's substrates, and found that both enzymes were able to cleave each other's substrates, although the relative enzymatic activities were around 30-40%, compared with that on their native substrates (Fig. 6(B) and (C)). Inhibition of the Norwalk virus protease activities. Since CV proteases are cysteine proteases that display a trypsin or chymotrypsin-like serine protease specificity, we tested whether common cysteine and serine protease inhibitors could inhibit the enzymatic activities of the Norwalk virus protease (Fig. 7A ). Among five inhibitors tested: E64, leupeptin, phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluroride (PMSF), 1-Chloro-3-tosylamido-4-phenyl-2-butanone (TPCK), and 1-Chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone HCl (TLCK), four -leupeptin, TPCK, TLCK, and PMSF -revealed suppressive effects on NoV protease activities, with an IC 50 of 18.8 mM for TPCK (Fig. 7B ) and 175.1 mM for TLCK (Fig. 7C ). These results are consistent with a report by Blakeney et al. (Blakeney et al., 2003) .
