To identify small-molecule hit candidates that block the myxovirus life cycle through a host-directed mechanism, we analyzed the results of a high-throughput cell-based anti-MeV screen of a 137,500-entry library of the NIH diversity set that we recently reported [19] . The primary screening agent, serving as the myxovirus representative, was the wild type MeV isolate MVi/ Alaska.USA/16.00 (MeV-Alaska). It was chosen based on its ease of growth and readily quantifiable cytopathic effect in the automated system [19, 20] . In search of candidates with a hostdirected antiviral profile, we anticipated three distinct features of desirable compounds: a) potent inhibition of virus replication at the screening concentration (3.3 mM); b) a primary screening score, representative of the selectivity index (CC 50 /EC 50 ), close to the cut-off value for hit candidates due to some anticipated hostcell interference ( = 1.9); and c) a broadened viral target spectrum in counterscreening assays that extends to other pathogens of the myxovirus families.
