The median time from contact symptomatic case to illness onset, which is called the incubation period, was 6.7 days, from illness onset to visit hospital was 4.5 days, from visit hospital to defined confirmed case was 2.1 days. Of the 262 patients, 176 (67.2%) were cluster cases, 133 (50.8%) were family cluster cases, 43 (16.4%) were other cluster cases. The median number of cluster infection was 3 cases, at least 2 cases, at most 5 cases. By the end of Feb 10, 2020, 45 (17.2%) of 262 patients were discharged and 214 (81.7%) remained in hospital.

Beijing was the fourth most affected city or province in China for accumulative confirmed cases of the COVID-19 infection at the end of Jan 23, reduced to the 8th in Jan 25, to the 10th in Jan 27, and out of the top ten later.
