To recruit a sample of 218 participants, a total of 284 HCWs were randomly approached during a study period, giving a response rate of 76.7%. Majority of the participants aged less than 30 years (47.2%, n = 103), followed by 30-39 years (32.1%, n = 70) and 40-49 years (20.7%, n = 45) respectively. Laboratory staff formed the major proportion of the selected sample (32.5%, n = 71), while other orderlies were the least in numbers (5.6%, n = 12). HCWs with 3-6 years of experience were relatively large number in numbers (31.7%, n = 69) than those with 7-9 years of experience (17.4%, n = 38). The demographic information is summarized in Table 1 . Television was the main source of information of HCWs about JE as depicted in Fig 1. The mean knowledge score of HCWs about JE was 11.02±2.39 (out of 17). Overall, 40.4% (n = 88) participants exhibited good knowledge of JE. HCWs were highly knowledgeable about JE (98.2%), its mode of transmission (97.7%), symptoms (92.7), prevention (93.1%) and its fatal consequences (94.9%).However, a large proportion of participants (89%) were not aware of the seasonal abundance and potential of JE. The numbers of incorrect answers were also high when participants were asked about the management of JE. 70.7% respondents incorrectly answered that antibiotics are the first line treatment of JE. Similarly, participants falsely answered that antivirals are highly effective against JE (67.4%). The results were not much different when HCWs were asked about the precautions need to be taken when dealing with JE patients as 63.3% respondents incorrectly replied to this question. The complete response of HCWs towards knowledge questions are presented in Table 2 . The association of demographic characteristics and mean knowledge score is expressed in Table 3 . Although males showed lower knowledge than females (31.1% vs 44.7%), the results were not statistical significant (OR = 0.81, p>0.05). In contrast, age and experience of participants were significantly associated with their knowledge of JE. Older participants (40-49 years) were more likely to have good knowledge (68.3% vs 35%) than respondents with less than 30 years of age (OR = 3.04, p<0.05). Similarly, the knowledge of experienced HCWs (>10 years) was also higher than those with less than 3 years of experience (86.5% vs 35.8%, OR = 17.33, p<0.001). No significant difference was observed between the knowledge of pharmacists and laboratory staffs with physicians (p>0.05); however, knowledge of nurses (OR = 0.06, p<0.001) and other orderlies (OR = 0.01, p<0.001) was significantly lower than physicians. The mean attitudes score of HCWs towards JE was 43.16±2.47 (ranging from 13 to 52). Overall, 74.3% (n = 162) participants displayed positive attitudes towards JE. The response of HCWs was mostly positive for all the attitude questions. However, the most negative attitude was observed when HCWs favoured intensive and emergency treatment for patients diagnosed with JE (62.4%). Likewise, 25.2% participants disagreed to the statement that residents of an area where viral transmission is high should be vaccinated. Moreover, slightly less than one quarter of the respondents (22.4%) agreed or strongly disagreed that protective equipments should be used by HCWs when dealing with JE patients. HCWs response towards attitudes questions is presented in Table 4 . The association of demographic characteristics and mean attitudes scores is tabularized in Table 5 . Like knowledge, gender difference did not affect the attitudes of HCWs towards JE (p>0.05), while old age participants had significantly positive attitudes than younger respondents (OR = 4.95, p<0.001). Not much difference was observed between the attitudes of physicians, pharmacists and laboratory staff, however, the attitudes of nurses were more negative than physicians (OR = 0.33, p<0.05). Similar results were obtained when attitudes of other orderlies were associated with the physicians (OR = 0.24, p<0.05).
