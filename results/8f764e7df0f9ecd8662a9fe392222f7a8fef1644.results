10 of the 28 patients with HCV complained of xerostomia, in 5 of whom symptoms were severe. No patient complained of xerophthalmia but of the 6 patients randomly assigned to ophthalmological examination, 3 had a positive Schirmer test, 1 of whom also had a positive rose-bengal test. Antinuclear antibody titres and the results of histological examination of labial salivary-gland biopsies are shown in table 1. 16 of 28 (57%) patients with chronic HCV liver disease had histological evidence of Sjogren's syndrome compared with 1 of the 20 (5%) controls (p < 001). (Biopsy results for controls were: grade 0, 3; grade 1, 7; grade 2,9; grade 3, 0; and grade 4, 1.) When the 12 patients with labial biopsy grades 1 or 2 were compared with the 16 who had labial biopsy grades 3 or 4, there were no statistically significant differences with regard to sex, age, mode of contamination, y-globulin concentration, Knodell's score, or response to interferon (table 11). 6 of the 10 patients with
