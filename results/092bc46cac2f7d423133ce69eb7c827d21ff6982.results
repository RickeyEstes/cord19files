There was no significant difference in the pass rate on the preexercise fit test between N95 and P100 FFRs (c 2 ¼ 0.2526, P ¼ .61). Of subjects who passed both pre-exercise fit tests, a significant number failed the postexercise fit test with the N95 FFR (P > .99), but not with the P100 FFR (P ¼ 1.0) ( Table 2) . There was no significant difference in mean values between controls and respirators for rectal temperature ( There were also no significant differences for these same variables when comparing the N95 FFR with the P100 FFR. There was a significant difference with FFR wear in the temperature of the facial skin covered by the FFR (F ¼ 7.460, P ¼ .009) and breathing comfort (F ¼ 8.634, P ¼ .002) when compared with controls. Time approached statistical significance for tcpCO 2 (P ¼ .05) and had a significant effect (P ¼ .02 for SpO 2, P < .001 for all other variables) on measured subjective and physiologic parameters (Tables 3-5) .
