Several isolates of SARS virus have been reported [3, 4] . The current analysis is based on the 11 protein sequences of BJ01 strain as well as the 15 protein sequences of the Tor2 strain (Table 1 ) from NCBI protein database (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/). Structural and functional domains have been annotated for three sequences, polyprotein 1a (pp1a), polyprotein 1b (pp1b), and S protein. For other sequences, very little sig-niÂ¢cant homology has been found with any known structural templates and the sequence analysis results are similar to previous reports by others in the analysis of the Tor2 [3] and CDCP [4] strains. The analysis based on the BJ01 strain and the Tor2 strain using the DS GeneAtlas pipeline resulted in the same annotation for all the SARS protein sequences. All predicted structural domains and functional domains are mapped to the genome sequence of Tor2 ( Fig. 1 ) for subsequent discussion.
