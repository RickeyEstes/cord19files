When the genome of C7/183 was compared on 6% polyacrylamide gels with that of the UKtc strain of bovine rotavirus, the absence of a band migrating in the position of RNA segment 11 and the presence of an additional band (segment X) migrating between RNA segments 6 and 7 originally reported by Pocock (1986) was confirmed (Fig. 1) . When the fractionated RNA segments of these two viruses were transferred to DPT paper and hybridized with a c-DNA probe derived from segment 11 of UKtc, as expected the positive control gave an appropriate hybridisa-MSLSIDVTSLPSISSSIY GGCTTTTAAAGCGCTACAGTGATGTCTCTCAGTATAGACGTGACGAGTCTT~~CTTCTATTTCTTCTAGTATATAT7$ **************** ******** ********* *********************************** x** GGCTTTTAAAGCGCTAAAGTGATGTATCTCAGTATTGACGTGACGAGTCTTCCTTCTATTTCTTCTAGTATTTAT,, MVLSIDVTSLPSISSSIY MNBLQQRQLFLENLLVGVNN~FHQ KNESSSTTSTLSGKSIGRSEQYLSP AAAAATGAATCGTCTTCAACAACGTCAACTCTCTTTCTGG~TCTATTGGTAGGAGTG~C~TACATTTCACCA=5o **i-k******* ********* ********~****x**?c*******************x**~~~~ ******** AAAAATGAATCATCTTCAACAGCGTCAACTCTCTTTCTGG~TCTATTGGTAGGAGTG~C~TATGTTTCACCA~,~ KNESSSTASTLSGKSIGRSEQYVSP MNHLQQRQLFLENLLVGVNNMFHQ MQBRSVNTCCQSLQKILDHLILyQT DAEAEGKYMLSKSPEDIGPSDPeSN GATGGAGAGGCGTTCGGTATACATGTTGTCAAAGTCTCCAG~GATATTGGACCATCTGATCCTCGTTC~C~25 *****x** **** * **x******** **** *********************tX******* s-k ******* GATGCAGAAGCGTCCAGTATACATGCTGTCTC DAEASSKYMLSKSPEDIGPSDSASN MQKRPVNTCCRSLQKILDHLILLQT IHSPAFRLDEMQLRQMQTLAkLWIH DPLTSFSIRSNAVKTNADAGgPMDS GATCCACTCACCAGCTTTTCGATTAGATCGAATGCAGTTATGCAGACGCTGGCGCTCCTATGGATTCA~oo ***************************** *****************t**~*~~*~~~~~~ ****eke**** GATCCACTCACCAGCTTTTCGATTAGATCAAATGCAGTTAOO DPLTSFSIRSNAVKTNADAGVSMDS IHSPAFRLDQMQLRQMQTLACLWIH QYNHDHQAMLGAIKWISPLIKELK* SIQSRPSSNVGCDQVDFSFNKGIKV TCAACACAATCACGACCATCAAGCAATGTTGGGTGCGATC~GTGGA~TCTCCTTT~T~GG~TT~GTG~'5 *** ****************** ** *****************************************~~~~~~~ TCAGTACAATCACGACCATCAAGTAACGTTGGGTGCGATC SVQSRPSSNVGCDQVDFSFNKGIKV QYNHDHQVTLGAIKWISPLIKELK* NANLSSSISLSTNSREIKSKSGHKS AATGCGAACCTTAGTTCATCAATATCTATCTATATC~CT~TTC~G~GGACG~TCC~GTGGC~T~GT~'o ******s-a*** id**** ***** * *-kc%** ******d-a** * *** ******* ** * ******** AATGCGAACCTAGATTCATCTATATCAGTGTCAACAAATTC~G~GGAG~GTCC~TGACCAT~GT~,~ NANLDSSISVSTNSRKEKSKNDHKS RKHYPEIEAESDSDDYVLDDSDSDD AGGAAACACTACCCAAAAATTGAAGCAGAATCTGATTCTGATTCAGATGACTATGTACTTGATGATTCTGATAGCGATGAT'=' ************** * ****x********** ** ******** ** ******** ***** ** ** ****** AGGAAACACTACCCTAGAATTG~GCAGAATCCGACTCAG RKHYPRIEAESDSDDYVLDDSDSDD GKCKNCKYKRKYFALRMRMKQVAMQ GGCAAATGCAAGAACTGTATATAAAAGGAAGTATTTCGCACT~G~TGAG~TG~C~GTTGC~TGC~soo ******s-k *x ************************-******** *d-k*********** t******* ****** GGCAAATGTAAAAACTGTATATAAAAGGAAGTATTTCGCACTGAG~TGAG~TG~GC~GTTGCCATGC~~~~ GKCKNCKYKRKYFALRMRMKQVAMQ LIEDL* TTGATCGAAGATTTGTGA=l' =*93GTCTAACCTGAGAGGTCACTAGGGAGCTCCCCACTCCCGTTTTGTGACC==~2 ***4+-k********** **** ***********xx**************************x~~~~ TTGATCGAAGATTTGTAGex, LIEDL* dlsGTCTGACCTGAGAGGTCACTAGGGAGCTCCCCACTCCCG~TTGTGACC~~, Fig. 3 . Comparison of the RNA and Protein sequences of the unique sequences of RNA segment X (top lines) and the corresponding sequences from the UKtc bovine rotavirus RNA segment 11. Positions of sequence identity are denoted by asterixes. The protein sequence of both VP11 and that derived from translating the shorter open reading frame are both shown. Differences in amino acid sequence are underlined for the segment X-derived translation product. tion signal (Fig. 1) . This probe also hybridized to segment X of C7/183, indicating that in this virus only this RNA segment contained sequences derived from the normal segment 11 RNA (Fig. 1) . When the converse hybridisation analysis was carried out using a full length c-DNA probe obtained by cloning segment X of C7/183 (see later), it hybridized to its homologous RNA as expected (Fig. 1) . When hybridising to the UKtc profile this probe only gave a signal with segment 11 (Fig.  1) . The failure of the full length c-DNA probe of segment X to give a hybridisation signal with any rotavirus RNA segment other than itself or segment 11, indicated that it only contains sequences from segment 11 and is not composed of a mosaic of sequences derived from a number of rotavirus RNAs. This result did not exclude the possibility that the extra sequences present in segment X compared to the normal segment 11 which it replaced, were not derived from something completely unconnected to rotaviruses. To obtain a definitive picture of the precise structural rearrangement involved in generating segment X, full length c-DNA clones of it were isolated using a cloning strategy developed for cloning dsRNA molecules. Sequencing of a full length clone showed (Fig. 2) that segment X is 1242 base pairs long and is made up of a head to tail partial duplication of the normal segment 11. The sequence of gene 11 from the UKtc strain has been determined (Ward et al., 1985) and therefore the sequence of segment X can be compared with it. If the duplication is disregarded and the two sequences compared (Fig. 3 ), then at the nucleotide level there is 92% sequence conservation. This translates at the protein level to there being 17 amino acid changes (91% conservation) in VP11 and 11 changes (88% conservation) in the putative protein encoded by the shorter open reading frame in the gene (Fig. 3) . The only clustering of changes that is evident is a 135 nucleotide stretch extending from
