The mean pre-induction WBC count was 15.1 ± 12.2 x 109 L; 91.7 % of patients experienced a decrease in WBC count after induction with a mean maximal decrease in white cell count of 9.15 x 109 L. The incidence of leucopenia and neutropenia were 34.7 % and 2.8 %, respectively. Procalcitonin levels were generally raised as early as first day of BCT. The incidence of clinical infections was 46.2 %. Pneumonia (n = 15) and blood stream infections (n = 9) accounted for majority of the infections. The main causative organisms causing pneumonia were Klebsiella pneumonia (n = 4), Staphyloccus aureus (n = 2) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2). The main cultured organisms from blood stream infections were Pseudomonas aeruginosia (n = 3), Klebsiella pneumonia (n = 1), Enterococcus cloacae (n = 1) and Acinetobacter baumannii with Staphyloccus aureus (n = 1). Out of 40 positive cultures, Klebsiella pneumonia (n = 14, 1 was multiresistant) and Staphyloccus Aureus (n = 9, 4 were methicillin-resistant) constituted the commonest bacteria isolated. Conclusions Leucopenia and infections (predominantly pneumonia) are common complications in patients on BCT for refractory intracranial hypertension. Introduction Stroke is a disease with high morbidity and mortality, it constitutes a main medical cause of permanent disability in adulthood, and in Spain it is one of the leading causes of death. The intravenous thrombolysis is an approved treatment in selected patients that with the new recomendations this group could be bigger. Advances in imaging studies for acute ischemic stroke are largely due to the development of new efficacious treatments carried out in the acute phase. The computed tomography (CT) perfusion studies and CT angiography facilitates the selections of patients who are likely to benefit from appropriate early treatment. In total, 30 patients were included. Diagnosis admission were severe sepsis/septic shock (22), brain injury (4) and post operative (4). Sixty five percent of patients were ventilated and 45 % required vasopressor support. There was no difference between responders and non responders. Fourteen patients (45 %) were volume responders. Dc100 increased by 32 % +/-24 % in the responders compared with 10 % +/-8 % in the non responders (p < 0.001). ΔDc100 was strongly correlated with ΔCO500 (r 0,78 ; p < 0,001). The best threshold of ΔDc100 was 14 % with a sensitivity and specificity of 93 % and 82 % respectively. The areas under the ROC curve of ΔDc100 was 0,91 +/-0,01. After bootstrapping (1000 resamples) a grey zone ranging between 11 and 20 % was observed in up to 29 % of patients. Background Sepsis-related acute circulatory dysfunction is a life threatening condition. Peripheral perfusion as a marker of hypoperfusion could be used to trigger initial fluid resuscitation (FR). The response of peripheral perfusion to FR in patients with abnormal perfusion could potentially identify high-risk patients. Objective Our aim was to study the effects of the first protocolized FR on capillary refill time (CRT) and other perfusion parameters, and the relationship of the response with outcome. Methods Prospective observational study including patients with sepsis and acute circulatory dysfunction just admitted to the Emergency department (ED) and in whom an initial FR was indicated according to standard care. Peripheral perfusion and laboratory assessments were performed before and after protocolized FR. Follow-up of patients until hospital discharge. CRT responders were defined as patients who were able to maintain normal CRT or to normalize abnormal CRT values after FR. Results One hundred consecutive patients were included. Of 30 patients with an abnormal CRT at admission, 23 (77 %) normalized CRT after initial FR. CRT responders showed a significant decrease in heart rate and lactate, presented less organ dysfunction and requirement of mechanical ventilation. Hospital mortality was significantly lower in CRT responders when compared to non-responders (9.6 % vs. 55.6 %; p < 0.001). In logistic regression analysis only CRT was significantly related to hospital mortality. This association was maintained after adjusting for baseline severity. Conclusions Patients with sepsis-related acute circulatory dysfunction that exhibit normal CRT after early FR have low mortality rates. In contrast, failure to improve peripheral perfusion in response to initial FR is a strong predictor of mortality. This finding could be very important for the ED or limited-resource settings since it could help to decide on additional diagnostic and treatment options. Methods Data used in this study came from the MIMIC II MIT database (n = 326). Arterial pressure waveforms from these patients were processed through FloTrac (Edwards Lifesciences) for calculation of mean arterial pressure (MAP), CO, SV, SVV, Ea dyn, dp/dt, and SVR. All data was annotated for events as defined previously. Events were then classified into 4 groups based on % change from 15 to 0 minutes prior to event: 1) Decreased preload (decrease in SV, CO, and increase in SVV); 2) Decreased afterload (decrease in Ea and SVR); 3) Decreased contractility (decrease in dP/dt); and 4) Uncertain (did not meet any criteria). Any events that met more than 1 group criteria were not used in the analysis to avoid any overlap. After classification of events, % changes of SV, CO, SVV, Ea dyn, SVR, and dP/dt from 15 to 10 minutes prior to event and 15 to 5 were evaluated to assess if an event's underlying cause could be identified early on. A t-test was used to assess significant difference (p < 0.05) in mean % changes by group. Results / conclusions There were 25,419 total hypotensive events. Group 1 contained 1,200 events, 2 had 2,066, 3 had 7,290, and 4 had 5,283. 9,560 events were not used in analysis due to data outliers or meeting more than 1 group criteria. Overall, each group's 5 minute % change profile was different at 5 and 10 minutes (Fig. 75) . % change in CO, SVV, and SV were significantly different when comparing Group 1 to 2, 3, and 4 at 10 minutes. % change in Ea dyn and SVR were significantly different when comparing Group 2 to 1, 3, and 4 at 10 minutes prior to event. % change in dP/dt were all significantly different when comparing Group 3 to 1, 2, and 4 at 10 and 5 minutes prior to event. In conclusion, the underlying cause of a hypotensive event can potentially be classified into 1 of 4 prescriptive groups up to 10 minutes prior to the start of an event. Introduction The dynamic arterial elastance (EaDyn) is used to predict the rising of mean arterial pressure (MAP) from fluid challenge in fluid responders. However, according to ventricular-arterial coupling, arterial resistance (Rart), not arterial elastance should be a predictor for MAP responsiveness Objectives Our study aimed to understand the relationship between arterial resistance variables and arterial elastance variables, and analyzed their performances to predict MAP responders in septic shock patients received fluid challenge (FC). Methods The Rart was MAP divided by cardiac output. The EaStat was pulse pressure (PP) divided by stroke volume (SV) and the EaDyn was pulse pressure variation (PPV) divided by stroke volume variation (SVV). We obtained these parameters at baseline and at the end of fluid challenge (FC Introduction In high-risk surgical patients arterial catheterization is needed to monitoring blood pressure and perform blood gas analysis, both in the operating room and ICU. The Seldinger technique is considered the gold standard, but many catheters are recently proposed to be as effective and safe. Objectives Evaluate effectiveness and safety of BBraun Introcan Safety 3 for arterial catheterization in adult high-risk surgical patients scheduled to postoperative ICU stay, compared to Seldinger devices. Methods BBraun Introcan Safety 3, Vygon Leader-Cath and Arrow Arterial Catheterization Set were analysed for arterial cannulation in adult high-risk surgical patients scheduled to postoperative ICU stay, for the follow parameters: adequate size, easy recognition of the vascular space, easy Introduction, traumaticity, cannula fixation, efficacy in blood pressure monitoring and taking blood samples for the first 96 hours, safety. The catheter was placed in the operating room before induction of general anesthesia and maintained during ICU stay. A questionnaire was administrated to the physician after arterial cannulation and each parameter was score as poor (2 points), middling (4 points), sufficient (6 points), good (8 points) or excellent (10 points); the maximum score was 70/70 points. Failures and complications were recorded. Appropriate statistical analysis was performed to compare effectiveness and safety of the three devices and p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. The non-inferiority margin was defined as 5 %. Results 100 arterial cannulations for each device were performed by 10 medical doctors with a mean experience in arterial catheterization of 8 years. Seldinger kits obtained the best score (56/70 points), but Introcan Safety 3 resulted to be non-inferior (54/70 points), with a 4 % of failure rate. No statistical differences were founded for adequate size, easy recognition of the vascular space, easy Introduction, traumaticity, cannula fixation, efficacy in blood pressure monitoring and taking blood samples during the first 96 hours. Introcan Safety 3 emerged to be the safer device, due to its anti-reflux and antipuncture systems (p < 0.05). No severe complications were reported during and after procedures. Conclusions BBraun Introcan Safety 3 resulted a safe and effective device to perform arterial catheterization in adult high-risk surgical patients scheduled to postoperative ICU stay. Introduction The transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) technique of cardiac output monitoring which applies the Stewart Hamilton principle is well established in terms of cardiac output accuracy.(1) However, it is an invasive procedure that involves various risks. (2) . Researchers are continuously exploring potential less invasive alternatives. Transthoracic echocardiographic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) measurements is a recognized tool for assessing the cardiac output noninvasively. However, there is paucity of definitive data concerning its accuracy. Objectives We aimed to validate the noninvasive transthoracic echocardiographic estimates of the stroke volume against the stroke volume measurements obtained invasively by the TPTD technique. Methods Twenty successive critically ill patients in whom a PiCCO™ cardiac output monitor (9 female; 11 male; mean (SD) age 66 (12.9) years) were the subject of this study. We compared 20 pairs of stroke volume (SV) readings obtained simultaneously from the TPTD component of the PiCCO™ cardiac output monitor and from transthoracic echocardiography (LVOT diameter and velocity time integral). The averaged values of SV measurements from Echocardiography compared to the TPTD were 61 (20) vs. 67 (28) ml. The SV measurements from Echocardiography and TPTD showed a significant correlation (p = 0.015), the mean bias was 6.1 ml and the 95 % limits of agreement (mean difference ± 1.96 SD) were 47.04 to -34.79 ml. Conclusions Monitoring of the cardiac output noninvasively using transthoracic echocardiography is a reproducible feasible option. Background Traumatic Hemorrhagic Shock (THS) is a leading cause of preventable death following severe traumatic injury. The microcirculation is the ultimate structure concerned with tissue perfusion, and is therefore of primary importance during THS. The microcirculation was examined in a large animal model of THS, in order to investigate the effects of microcirculatory dysfunction during resuscitation. Methods Baseline standard microcirculatory parameters were obtained for 22 large white pigs using sublingual Incident Dark Field (IDF) video-microscopy. All animals were subjected to a standardized hind-limb injury followed by a controlled haemorrhage of approximately 35 % of blood volume (shock phase). This was followed by 60 min of fluid resuscitation with either 0.9 % saline or component blood products and a target SBP of 80 mmHg (early resuscitation phase). All animals were then given blood products to a target SBP of 110 mmHg for 120 min (mid resuscitation phase), and a further 100 min (late resuscitation phase). IDF readings were obtained at the mid point of each of these phases. Cardiac output was measured using a pulmonary artery catheter. Animals were divided into above average (A) and below average (B) perfused vessel density (PVD) groups based on the lowest recorded PVD measurement taken during the shock and early resuscitation phases. Results During shock and early resuscitation Group A (n = 10) had a mean PVD of 10.5 (SD ± 2.5) mm/mm 2 , and Group B (n = 12) 5.5 (SD ± 4.1) mm/mm 2 . During the later resuscitation phases, Group A maintained a significantly higher PVD than Group B. Group A initially had a higher cardiac output but the difference between the groups narrowed as resuscitation progressed. At the end of resuscitation group A had significantly lower plasma lactate, higher lactate clearance, lower standard base deficit, and smaller mixed venous -arterial CO 2 gradient. There was no significant difference in blood pressure between the two groups at any stage. There was a wide spread of PVD for a given blood pressure, especially during the shock and early (hypotensive) resuscitation phases (Fig. 78) . The choice of initial resuscitation fluid appeared not to produce differing effects in terms of microcirculatory perfusion (Figs. 79 and 80) . Note: This abstract has been previously published and is available at [1] . It is included here as a complete record of the abstracts from the conference. Conclusions Early changes in microvascular perfusion are key determinants in subsequent tissue perfusion following fluid resuscitation, and appear unrelated to pressure based parameters. Choice of initial resuscitation fluid appears to have little impact on microcirculatory perfusion during resuscitation from traumatic haemorrhagic shock. Microcirculatory parameters may be more reliable markers of physiological insult than global haemodynamic parameters, and are potential targets for goal-directed resuscitation. Table 58 . Radial arterial pressure waveforms were recorded with a FloTrac™ sensor (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). The waveforms were passed to the algorithm to calculate the hypotension probability. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess algorithm performance. Results 16,078 hypotensive events were registered, on average 34 events per patient with a duration of 11 (±89) minutes per event. The algorithm was able to predict hypotension with a sensitivity and specificity of 90 %, 87 % and 86 %, for 5, 10, and 15 minutes prior to the event, respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) is 0.96, 0.94, and 0.93, for 5, 10, and 15 minutes prior to the event, respectively (Fig. 81) . Conclusions These data suggest that HPI™ is capable of predicting hypotensive events with high sensitivity and specificity in ICU patients, up to 15 minutes prior to event. Introduction Machine learning is an emerging technique that enables computers to learn from data without been explicitly programmed [1] , in the medical field has been used for classification and prediction analysis in both supervised and supervised fashion [2] . Cardiomechanics determinants end-systolic and arterial elastances and ventricular arterial coupling (VAC) in the critical care patient treated for hemodynamic derangement has been recently investigated [3] . Objectives In this study we aimed to identify the possibility of a machine learning approach to classify hemodynamic data in the intensive care unit. Methods We used three non linear supervised machine learning approaches (multilayer perceptron neural network, decision tree and gaussian support vector machine) to classify responders vs non responders from a dataset of 115 patients using Matlab R2015b software. The classification models were run three times with respect to independent variables: mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial elastance (Ea), VAC. Results Best performance of the classification models was carried out by decision trees, in all runs. With accuracy of 86.7 % with respect to MAP increase, 96.8 % with respect to VAC decrease and 80 % with respect to Ea increase. Conclusions In this analysis we demonstrated the feasibility of a machine learning approach to hemodynamic data analysis in the intensive care patient. Decision tree was found to be the most effective technique in analysing hemodynamic data. The models Introduction Evaluating and monitoring contractile cardiac function is a key element in hemodynamic management of critically ill patients. However, evaluation of intrinsic contractile cardiac function is difficult in a clinical setting. Objectives Aim of the study was to evaluate a novel approach of assessing load-independent left-ventricular contractility based on pulse contour analysis (rate of aortic maximum pressure rise (dP/ dt Ao )) and estimation of end-diastolic volume (VED) by transcardiopulmonary thermodilution (TCPTD) in an experimental animal model in pigs. Methods 16 domestic pigs were studied. dP/dt Ao as evaluated by pulse contour analysis was related to VED by TCPTD. Direct measurement of rate of maximum pressure rise in left ventricle (dP/ dt LV ) related to VED (cdP/dt LV ) served as experimental reference of preload independent contractility. [1] Measurements were carried out in normal cardiac function and experimentally impaired cardiac function (continuous infusion of verapamil) during a wide modification of cardiac preload (withdrawal of blood 20 ml kg -1 bodyweight). Results While impairment of contractile cardiac function by continuous infusion of verapamil resulted in significant changes of cdP/dt Ao and cdP/dt LV (p < 0.05), neither in normal as well as in impaired cardiac function did cdP/dt Ao and cdP/dt LV present significant changes during preload modifications (p > 0.05). Conclusions Estimation of cdP/dt Ao by means of pulse contour analysis and thermodilution provides reliable assessment of preloadindependent left ventricular contractility and its changes in an experimental animal model. (1), with correlation demonstrated between derangement in muscle tissue oxygenation and mortality (2) . Human skin has an exquisite microcirculatory blood supply which can be visualized by means of infrared thermography. Thermography may therefore be a potentially useful non-contact, real-time monitor of microcirculatory function. Objectives To investigate the thermal infrared profile of the palm during a VOT in healthy volunteers. Methods Participants were recruited from faculty and students at the University of Leicester. Room temperature was confirmed between 19-21oC throughout data acquisition and participants were allowed a period of acclimatization prior to measurement. Baseline blood pressure was measured in the left forearm. The right forearm was then placed on a bench with a blood pressure cuff placed around it. A FLIR T650sc thermal imaging camera was placed at a distance of 1 meter from the participant. Thermal video recording was commenced and the blood pressure cuff was inflated to 50 mmHg above the previously measured systolic pressure for a total of 3 minutes. Recording continued for 5 minutes following deflation of the cuff. Average palm temperatures were measured using a 100 x 100 pixel sample. Data were extracted using FLIR Tools + software and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and R-Studio. Conclusion From these results it can be concluded that the rate of reheating per second measured using infrared thermography following a vascular occlusion test in healthy volunteers is 0.015 + / -0.009°C .s -1 . It is our hypothesis that this gradient will be prolonged in patients with sepsis. If demonstrated to be true, this technique could be used as a non-invasive diagnostic technique in sepsis. Introduction Focused Intensive Care Echo (FICE) is becoming an increasingly important tool in the intensivists' arsenal of haemodynamic assessment. It has the ability to diagnose structural and dynamic problems, is non-invasive, and inter-user variability is limited. Rigorous training and CPD is essential in order to prevent mismanagement based on incorrect findings. In the UK the Intensive Care Society administers FICE accreditation with this becoming compulsory for critical care trainees in future. Methods Every patient who undergoes diagnostic FICE has the result documented in their notes and in an audit folder. This follows a standardised "sticker". All results documented in this folder, ranging between December 2014 and January 2015, were collated and analysed in a spreadsheet. The aim was to assess how FICE impacts on care at a district general critical care unit. Results 57 patients underwent documented FICE 37 % of these scans occurred during the weekend Indications for scan: Haemodynamic Instability (5/57), Haemodynamic Instability -Post Operative (9/57), PE (1/57), Post Cardiac Arrest (8) Conclusion It is clear that FICE echo has had a significant impact on the management strategies of a significant number of patients, however the impact of this on morbidity/mortality is impossible to assess. It is also interesting to see that a disproportionate number of scans were performed during the weekend, when formal cardiac investigations aren't always as available as during the week. Documentation was generally good but some gaps in documentation were found and require improvement. We suggest that this data, although limited in number, supports funding of expanded FICE training and availability at district general critical care units. The population group had a mean age of 59.2 years (range 19-84) and a mean APACHE II score of 23.7 (range 7 -61). Causes of low CO state included myocardial infarction (n = 14, 22.5 %), after cardiac arrest (n = 6, 9.7 %), after cardiac surgery (n = 7, 11.3 %), septic cardiac dysfunction (n = 5, 8.1 %), acute cardiomyopathies (n = 7, 11.3 %) amongst other causes (n = 23, 37 %). Levosimendan was received at a variable point during their ICU treatment (mean day 3.7, range 0 -14 days) and was usually the 3rd inotrope (range 0-5) commenced. Treatment with levosimendan resulted in significant improvements in CI (p = 0.013) and acidosis (p < 0.0001) . There was a trend towards improved lactate clearance and oxygenation. Overall length of stay (LOS) in ICU was 12.7 days (range 1 -60), 30day mortality was 59.7 % and survival to discharge was 38.7 %. Commencing levosimendan within 48 hours after admission resulted in decreased duration of ventilation (p 0.013) and ICU LOS (p 0.0009), with a trend towards a reduction in length of renal replacement therapy (p 0.06) (Table 64) . Similar benefits were not demonstrated if levosimendan was introduced as a first or second vasoactive agent compared to a third or fourth agent. However survival to discharge was improved (41.5 % vs 33.3 % respectively). Conclusions When levosimendan was used early in the disease process ICU LOS and duration of ventilation were reduced. When used as a first or second inotrope, rather than a third or fourth, survival to discharge was higher. More research is required to determine the optimum timing of therapy. Table 66 . Conclusions In three periods study there was significant differences between mortality and thrombolysis place in STEMI. Early thrombolysis in prehospital and emergency hospital areas showed decreased in mortality ICU. Introduction The Killip class classification for heart failure it is used to predict short-term mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) Objectives To determine the contemporary long-term prognosis of ACS with acute heart failure graded according to the Killip classification. Methods Cohort study of consecutive hospitalized patients with ACS diagnosis from 2004 to 2009. Follow-up was done by clinical review or telephone contact and death or cardiovascular events were recorded, as well as the cause of death Results 5070 patients were included with a complete follow up after a mean of 5.8 ± 2.6 years. The clinical characteristics were analyzed in relation with Killip class at admission (shown in Table) . A stepwise gradient in the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was observed with increasing Killip class: class > I HR 4.35 (95 % CI 3.81 to 4.97) unexpectedly, in a landmark analysis excluding deaths < 30 days after admission, patients in Killip class IV had a lower adjusted long-term mortality than those in class III (shown in Figure) . Conclusions The heterogeneity in early versus late risk in patients with Killip class IV heart failure it is present in our contemporary cohort highlighting the importance of an appropriate early treatment in cardiogenic shock patients. Conclusions Type 2 MI reveals rather common and frequently misdiagnosed in ICU patients. This lead to management delay and errors. Patients are rather young, without underlying cardiovascular risk factors. They exhibit a myriad of clinical conditions in which the common factor is oxygen supply-demand mismatch. They have less cTn I levels but relatively high mortality related to the associated illness severity. Background HAS-BLED scoring in assessment of bleeding risk among patients with atrial fibrillation has been proven effective in risk stratification. This helps in anticoagulation management as well as in assessing morbidity and mortality of patients with atrial fibrillation who are on anti coagulants. Objective This study aims to show if HASBLED scoring is also useful in bleeding risk assessment among patients without atrial fibrillation admitted in the medical intensive care unit. Study design This is a single centered retrospective cross sectional Study. Methods Descriptive statistics will be reported as mean ± SD, median (IQR) or proportion (%) as applicable and presented in tables or graphs. Cox regression analysis was used to determine association of Introduction As myocardial infarction can result in permanent ischaemic damage, early revascularization is vital to spare myocardium. However, the downside of this treatment is reperfusion injury, and this in itself will contribute to long-term ventricular dysfunction. Strategies attenuating reperfusion injury have, to date, proved unsuccessful. As reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) are the main cause of reperfusion injury, modulation of oxidative phosphorylation (peri-revascularization) may confer benefit. Sulphide donors reversibly inhibit complex IV of the ETC so this approach offers putative benefit. Objectives To test the slow-release sulphide donor, MGC-0109, in a cell (cardiomyocyte) model of ischaemia/reperfusion injury. Methods H9C2 cells were subjected to 24 h hypoxia followed by 2 h reoxygenation (in room air). Cells received MGC-0109 (0.005-5.5 mM) or vehicle (cell medium) at the beginning of the reoxygenation period. In separate experiments, normoxic cells were treated with the ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) 500 microM for 4 h with MGC-0109 (5.5.mM) added to half the wells after 1 h. Cell viability was assessed by flow cytometry using an Annexin V/PI assay. One-way ANOVA and Tukey posthoc testing (SPSS v20) was used to test for statistical significance. Results Ischaemia/reperfusion reduced cell viability from 94 % to 79 % (Fig. 86) . MGC-0109 adminstered at the onset of reperfusion increased cell survival in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest concentration survival was similar to cells that did not undergo I/R. Protective effects were also seen with addition of MGC-0109 to H 2 O 2 -treated normoxic cells (data not shown). Conclusions MGC-0109 reversed cell death related to reperfusion injury. Further studies are ongoing to confirm if its mechanism of action is via mitochondrial ETC inhibition. Introduction Rapid revascularisation is the treatment of choice to minimize ischaemic injury in acute myocardial infarction. However, this procedure can itself induce reperfusion injury that may further damage the myocardium [1] . Experimental models of myocardial infarction and reperfusion involve temporary ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). This model, though representative of the clinical scenario, is associated with infarcts of variable size, and, consequently, insult severity [2] . However, periprocedural haemodynamics are not well described. The ECG implementation rate increased from 0 % in preinterventional to 62.2 % in post-interventional group (p < 0.001). Total 66 patients with STEMI was detected in 1205 chest pain patients received ambulance ECG exam. In these STEMI patients, average door to balloon time was 51 minutes, average ischemia to balloon time was 125 minutes and in-hospital mortality was 0 %. In 2014, 672 patients were discharged from ICU, with 21 readmissions and only 2 within 48 hours (0.3 %). The time of re-admission ranged from 14 to 48 hours. Following readmission, the length of stay ranged from 10 days to 17 days. In 2015, there were 702 discharges with 30 readmissions. 14 of these were within 48 hours (2.0 %). The time of readmission varied from 9 to 48 hours (median = 25 hours). Cardio-respiratory failure was the most common cause for readmission. The length of the readmission stay on ICU ranged from 1 day to 68 days (median = 8 days). Over the two year period the ICU mortality rate remained unchanged at 16 % however patients readmitted within 48 hours showed considerably higher hospital mortality rates of 50 % in 2014 and 42 % in 2015. We have reviewed over 4200 patient-days of data in a rolling audit of the effectiveness of our project. Fig. 88 demonstrates the percentage of patients for whom an IBW was recorded and for whom a target oxygen saturation was prescribed each month. Our latest results (April 2016) showed that 88 % (75/85) of patients on our unit had their IBW recorded and 100 % (14/14) of those receiving controlled ventilation had an appropriate tidal volume prescribed. Ventilation matched the prescription in 71 % (10/14) of cases. Routinely knowing the IBW of every patient on the unit has also been useful for the safe prescribing of haemofiltration and critical care drugs. 76 % (65/85) of patients had target oxygen saturations prescribed although only 38 % (25/65) were 'on target' at the time of data collection. Most importantly, prescribing an oxygen saturation target has empowered our nursing staff to wean inspired oxygen concentrations without waiting for an arterial blood gas. The result showed differences in specialized nurse/patient ratio of 0,5:1 to 1:1 ratio and Care burdened measurement (VTS) despite similarities in admission rate. Differences in cause of admission (surgicalv.s medical) and in the amount of unexpected surgery patients were found. Differences were also found in mean time on noninvasive ventilation and mean time on ventilator. Complications during critical care was measured by readmission and unplanned reintubation and showed that unplanned reintubation varied between 2.4-1.6 percent. ICU mortality showed differences with the lowest ICU mortality in the hospital with lower nurse/patient ratio. However, 30 days mortality was lower in the hospital with higher nurse/patient ratio. Further analysis is needed. Nearly all of the correlation coefficients between the items of each construct were > 0,5, which meant, therefore, that all constructs had convergent validity. The three regression models performed to evaluate the predictive validity showed high determination coefficients (78,2 %. 94,9 % and 75,4 %). The evaluation of the items of all dimensions were high, with mean values around 6, except dimensions "empathy with family needs" and "waiting room", with scores < 5. Most prevalent microorganisms were: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumonia, 33 % of all microorganisms identified were resistant to more than one class of antibiotics (RM2) and 17 % of the patients had a RM1.Resistance was statistically significantly (p < 0,05) associated with:Previous stay in wards -in particular patients coming from surgical wards or Emergency;Number of days from admission in hospital to ICU admission -patients with RM2 had a mean hospital stay before ICU admission of 12 days;Number of previous surgeries in the same hospital event -RM2 were identified in patients with an average of two previous surgeries;Admission type -mainly patients coming from urgent surgery and medical causes;Number of days in ICU -patients with RM2 stay in average at least 5 days more in ICU than patients with microorganisms with no resistance;Antibiotic treatment previous to ICU admission (for at least 5 days before ICU admission), more than 30 % of patients with RM2 were submitted to antibiotic treatment before ICU admission.After the implementation of the antibiotic protocols we verified that the ICU length of stay was reduced in almost 3 days; the number of agents isolated increased 33 %; microbiological analyses increased 53 % which allowed us the practice of de-escalation consumption of antibiotics, by category, decreased by 82 % for the carbapenems, 33 % for antifungals and 35 % for antipseudomonal beta-lactams.There was a significant decrease in mortality, from 31,8 % to 26,8 %;There was a 22 % reduction in antibiotics consumption, with a total saving of 65,862€ in one year. Eighty-six critical ill patients admitted for sepsis-associated ARDS (n = 36), severe TBI (n = 29), SAH (n = 21) were studied.  Seventy lung transplant recipients were included. Patients who developed severe primary graft dysfunction had better right ventricular function, as estimated by cardiac index (3.5 ± 0.8 vs. 2.6 ± 0.7 l/min*m 2 ; p < 0.01) and basal longitudinal strain (-25.7 ± 7.3 vs. -19.5 ± 6.6 %; p < 0.01). Regression tree analysis provided an algorithm based on the combined use of three variables (Basal longitudinal strain, pulmonary fibrosis disease and ischemia time), allowing accurate preoperative discrimination of three distinct subgroups with low (11 to 20 %), intermediate (54 %) and high (75 %) risk of severe primary graft dysfunction (AUROC 0.81). Critical illness occurred in twenty patients with confirmed influenza; 12 A(H1N1) (60 %), 1 A(H3N2) (5 %), 4 A(non-subtyped) (20 %) and 3 B (15 %). The median age was 50 years (42.5-66.5); 14 patients (70 %) were under 65; 11 (55 %) were male. Thirteen (65 %) had comorbidities, including respiratory disease 5 (25 %), morbid obesity 3 (15 %) and malignancy or immunosuppression 3 (15 %). One was pregnant (5 %) and 8 (40 %) had a smoking history. Nine (45 %) were retrieved from outside the Ireland East Hospital Group. The mean APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II Score and the mean SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score, on day one, were 17.85 ± 5.78 and 9.85 ± 3.33 respectively. Twenty (100 %) were mechanically ventilated, for a median of 17.5 days (9.5-32). Eighteen (90 %) satisfied the criteria for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, with a mean PaO2/FIO2 ratio on day one of 13.35 ± 6.46. Fifteen (83.3 %) required rescue therapies for severe hypoxaemia, including extracorporeal life support (ECLS) in five (25 %), prone ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide. Sixteen (80 %) received vasopressors, and 12 (60 %) required renal replacement therapy. The median ICU length of stay was 18.5 days (11-42) and as of 31st March 2016, three (15 %) had died. Four (20 %) had documented early secondary infection, at less than 48 hours; streptococcus pneumoniae was the sole isolate (100 %). Seven (35 %) were treated for presumed late (greater than 48 hours) secondary infection; aspergillus fumigatus (28.6 %) and pansensitive staphylococcus aureus (42.9 %) were the most prevalent. All patients received a neuraminidase inhibitor: oseltamivir was prescribed in 19 (95 %), for a median of 7 days (7-9.75), with 3 (20 %) patients receiving the higher, 150 mg twice daily, dosing regime. Conclusion Seasonal influenza is a major public health concern. It is associated with severe morbidity, resulting in significant economic consequences, as well as a substantial burden on tertiary ICUs. In keeping with national trends, the predominant circulating virus was influenza A(H1N1) and secondary coinfection was common. Although traditional teaching emphasises S.aureus as a common coinfection in viral illness, our results highlight the importance of considering a broad spectrum of bacterial, viral and fungal microorganisms when prescribing empirically in the critically ill patient. We included 690 patients with a 90-day mortality rate of 23 %. During the first 3 days in ICU, 65 % of the patients received respiratory support, 57 % circulatory support and 13 % renal replacement therapy (RRT (Fig. 96) . Carbon dioxide levels raised from (mean (SD)) 5.6 kPa (0.40) to 9.2 kPa (0.47) during hypercapnia. The bias (limits of agreement, LoA) for ELV at normocapnia was 303 (131 to 476) ml, and percentage error (PE) was 31 %. During hypercapnia, bias (LoA) decreased to -75 (-188 to 39) ml, and PE to 20 %. The hemodynamic interventions resulted in significant changes in CO, i.e. a decrease by 41 % (caval occlusion) followed by a 59 % increase (dobutamine inf.). ELV and FRC remained stable throughout these changes (Fig. 97) . Conclusions ELV showed good performance during hypercapnia. The Method shows good stability during severe changes in cardiac output. This indicates that it would be interesting to further evaluate if the Method could be suitable for monitoring lung function in the ICU for instance during protective lung ventilation with permissive hypercapnia or in septic patient with hyper dynamic hemodynamics. Data was collected from 45 PT assessments. These assessments most frequently included neurological status, Rapid Shallow Breathing index (RSBi), occlusion pressure during initial 100 ms of inspiration (P0.1), Negative Inspiratory Force (NIF), peak cough flow (PCF) and secretion load. Range of values for the assessed parameters are shown below. When providing opinion regarding suitability for extubation, PTs gave more weight to neurological status, PCF and secretion load than other weaning parameters (see image below). They were more likely to recommend against extubation in the presence of low PCF, inappropriate neurology and large secretion load. Of 7,784 patients, 693 patients had ARDS of which 164 patients with mild ARDS and on invasive ventilation were included in the analysis. Table 75 shows outcomes per group at the moment mild ARDS was diagnosed, and after 24 hours. Reclassification after 24 hours showed an improved prognostication with regard to hospital mortality, ICU-and 90-day mortality and the number of ventilator-free days and alive at day 28. Of 59 enrolled patients, 39 had samples available for baseline and day 2. The log-transformed values of IL-6, vWF-A2, IL-8, RAGE, and ICAM-1 decreased on day 2 with the observed decreases being greater in the treatment arm. However, the differences were not statistically significant: IL-6 p = 0.16, vWF-A2 p = 0.9, IL-8 p = 0.68, RAGE p = 0.27, ICAM-1 p = 0.1. Interestingly, IL-10 also decreased in the treatment arm while slightly increasing in the placebo arm, although differences were not significant (p = 0.28). The concentration of SP-D increased on day 2 in both arms with a non-significant greater increase in the placebo arm (p = 0.5).  A total of 904 adult patients were admitted to the ICUs during the study period and 16 patients met ARDS criteria, using the Berlin definition. Based on this, the unadjusted incidence of ARDS in Singapore is 5.49 cases per 100,000 population and 1.76 % of all ICU patients. Most patients belonged to Medical ICUs (56 %), were male (75 %), Chinese (62 %) and had pneumonia (73 %). Management strategies varied across all ICUs. Our survey results showed that the majority of physicians thought that it was useful to study ARDS prevalence but that they believed overall mortality and prevalence was decreasing. Our 28 day in hospital mortality was 15 % and median length of stay was 7 ± 3 days. During the study period, 22470 receiving invasive mechanical ventilation patients admitted to adult ICUs with PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mmHg were screened. Totally, 945 ARDS patients were included for analysis. The mean age and hospital mortality were 63.2 ± 16.1 years and 56.9 %. Of these 945 ARDS patients, 463 (49 %) patients were older than 65 years. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, factor associated with hospital mortality included body mass index (odds ratio 1.07, 95 % confidence interval 1.04-1.11; p < 0.001), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (odds ratio 0.88, 95 % confidence interval 0.81-0.95; p = 0.002), Lung Injury Score (odds ratio 0.68, 95 % confidence interval 0.46-1.00; p = 0.05) and PaO2/FiO2 (odds ration 0.995, 95 % confidence interval 0.991-1.00; p = 0.04). The hospital mortality in ARDS patients younger than 65 years was significantly lower than ARDS patients older than 65 years patients (50.2 % vs. 63.9 %, p < 0.001). For ARDS patients older than 65 years, we classified the patients as the young-old (65~74 years, n = 194, 41.9 %), middle-old (75~84 years, n = 189, 40.8 %) and old-old (≥85 years, n = 80, 17.3 %). The hospital mortality were not significantly different between these three group (63.9 % vs. 65.6 % vs.60 %, p = 0.682). We enrolled 13 ARDS patients, admitted to the Padova University Hospital ICU [median age 58 years (IQR 53-61); median SAPSII 45.5 (IQR 33-52)]. V-LUSS between P0 and P1 correlated with changes in compliance (r = 0.690; p < 0.05) and P/F (r = 0.70; p < 0.02) between S0 and Sfin. V-LUSS P0-Pfin also correlated with changes in P/F (r = 0.61; p < 0.05) and compliance (r = 0.60; p < 0.05) between S0 and SFin. Conclusions LUS is feasible in ARDS patients in prone position and V-LUSS correlates with changes in compliance and P/F. Moreover, the V-LUSS at 1 hour after initiation of prone position may predict the change in compliance and P/F at the end of a pronation cycle, after returning the patient in supine position. There were 199 influenza-infected patients hospitalized in ICU during the study period. Seventy-three patients were confirmed influenza A (H1N1), and 54 (82 %) patients developed to ARDS, including 36 (67 %) with severe ARDS and 14 (26 %) with moderate ARDS by Berlin definition. Compared with non-ARDS influenza A (H1N1) patients, age was younger (50 ± 14 vs. 62 ± 16 years, p = 0.016) and body mass index (BMI) was higher (26.7 ± 4.7 vs. 23.7 ± 4.0 kg/m 2 , p = 0.045) in ARDS patients. The duration of oseltamivir therapy in ARDS patients was longer (7.2 ± 2.6 vs. 4.9 ± 0.7 days, p = 0.010) than no ARDS patients. Despite significantly prolonged mechanical ventilation support (20.7 ± 18.5 vs. 9.6 ± 9.8 days, p = 0.013) and intensive care unit stay (21.7 ± 16.0 vs. 8.7 ± 8.2 days, p = 0.003) in ARDS patients, there were no significant difference in the mortality rate of ICU (18.5 % vs. 33.3 %, p = 0.256) and hospital (37 % vs. 33.3 %, p = 0.809) between ARDS and non-ARDS patients. The results of the demographic and clinical variables are shown in Table 76 . Regarding the evaluation of HRQL by SGRQ, the mean scores were slightly higher in all domains with regard to the reference values from Spanish population by age and sex, indicating subjective respiratory problems with an impact on daily life. Only 7 of our 31 patients (22.6 %) had scores normal in all domains and in the total scores. 18 patients (58.1 %) had higher scores in all domains. The other 6 patients (19.3 %) had a higher score in some of the domains. Table 77 Conclusions · ARDS has a negative impact on the quality of life of survivors detectable even beyond two years after the acute episode. · Domains of activity and symptoms are the most affected in patients who survive ADRS. There were no differences in optimal PEEP titrated with fast and slow titration Method (13,20 ± 3,58cmH 2 O versus 13,40 ± 3,37cmH 2 O, p =0,727). The mean difference between two Method was 0,20 ± 1,75cmH 2 O with limits of agreement of -3,23 to 3,63cmH 2 O. Analysing the amount of collapse during entire titration, there was no significant differences between the fast and the slow titration (p = 0,401), however there were differences between each PEEP steps (p < 0,001) and there was no interaction between the fast and the slow titration groups and PEEP steps (p = 0,997). There was a good correlation between collapsed tissue provided by the EIT and CT (R 2 = 0,97). Between T1 and T2, VT and TPP increased from 6.0 ± 0.1 to 49.4 ± 2.9 ml/kg and from 9 ± 2 to 38 ± 4 cmH 2 O, respectively. Between T1 and T2, global 11 C-PK11195 SUV and global dynamic strain increased significantly from 1.83 ± 0.58 to 2.97 ± 0.53, and from 0.36 ± 0.03 to 2.06 ± 0.23, respectively, whereas static strain did not change significantly. Regional 11 C-PK11195 SUV significantly increased between T1 and T2, without significant inter-regional differences, while regional dynamic strain increased after VILI, with significant inter-regional differences between antero-caudal and postero-caudal regions. Regional static strain differed neither between T1 and T2, nor between regions. In multivariate analysis, regional dynamic strain was independently associated with regional SUV (p = 0.04). Histologic analysis showed greater alveolar damage in the caudal regions (p < 0.01). SUV was positively correlated with macrophages recruitment (p = 0.03). Conclusions 11 C-PK11195 is a macrophage-specific PET radiotracer whose lung uptake is independently associated with dynamic strain and macrophage lung recruitment in a high-volume VILI model. IMV was applied in %49 of 180 patients. While the age had no impact on the need of IMV(p = 0.407), frailty defined by Edmonton FS was an independent factor for IMV; increasing the need approximately 3 times (p = 0.023). The presence and the degree of frailty according to all FSs and CGA parameters had no impact on weaning and mortality in patients with IMV(p > 0.05). In the whole study group, when the patients with and without fraility according to the Edmonton FS were compared, disease severity scores (APACHE and SOFA scores), duration of weaning were similar in both groups (p > 0.05), but the comorbidities in the ICU such as development of infection and septic shock, frequency of renal replacement therapy and and mortality were higher in the frail patients (p = 0.03, p = 0.04, p = 0.02 and p = < 0.01, respectively). During a median follow-up of 15 years, 1840 persons had at least one episode of BSI, and 396 experienced a fatal BSI. In age-and sexadjusted analyses, BSI risk was increased among participants with indices of iron deficiency, either low SI (HR  The median (min-max) age of 52 patients was 68 (19-88). 25 of these patients were male. The median APACHE II score was 28.  Eighteen patients (age 56 ± 16 years, 12 male, APACHE II 20 ± 5) were included. During the ICU stay (17 ± 12 days), muscle mass assessed by skin folds and by PhA at 50 Hz decreased from 26.8 ± 5.4 kg to 25.6 ± 5.4 kg (p < 0.003) and from 4.0 ± 1.6 to 3.4 ± 1.4 (NS), respectively. Likewise, force evaluated with MRC score decreased from 52 ± 2 to 42 ± 5 (NS). There was a correlation between the percentage change in mass and in force (r =0.57, p < 0.01), between the percentage change in mass and length of ICU stay (r = -0.79; p < 0.0001) and between the durations of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay (r = 0.89; p < 0.0001). The APACHE II score was negatively correlated with force measured using the handgrip test (r = -0.67; p = 0.002), with the MRC score (r = -0.765; p < 0.0001) and with muscle mass evaluated by PhA (r = -0.665; p = 0.004). A total of 74 patients (38 men) mechanically ventilated septic patients having a mean(±SD) age of 68.4 ± 18.4 years were studied. All patients met the consensus criteria for sepsis. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. APACHE II and SOFA at study entry were 22 ± 4 and 8 ± 4respectively.The mean height of the patients was 164.0 cm. The mean(±SD) BMI was ≈ 21.5 ± 3.4 kg/m 2 . Obese patients were excluded from the study. During the study period, the permissive-underfeeding group received fewer calories than did the standard-protocol feeding group (962 ± 314 kcal per day vs. 1308 ± 513 kcal per day) achieving caloric requirements of 51 ± 14 % vs. 82 ± 11 %, respectively (P < 0.001). Protein intake was similar in both groups (57 ± 24 g per day and 59 ± 25 g per day, respectively). The 28-day mortality was lower in the permissive-underfeeding group (18.4 %) than in the standard-feeding group (28.9 %). There were no significant differences among the groups with respect to feeding intolerance, diarrhoea or serious adverse events. In this study, a total of 503 patients were enrolled. The hospital mortality which is based on 28 days after admission was 28.2 %. TC levels derived at specific point of time showed negative correlation with APACHE IV score (initial TC, r = -0.231, p < 0.001; second week TC, r = -0.361, p < 0.001; third week TC, r = -0.327, p < 0.001) TC level of the second week, C-reactive protein level and status of ARDS were the independent risk factor for mortality in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio (HR) =0.98, p < 0.001; HR = 1.05, p = 0.02, HR = 8.24, p = 0.001, respectively) Conclusions Lower TC level is a prognostic indicator of hospital mortality in medical patients admitted in ICU. Following up TC level regularly has the advantage of managing critically ill patients. A total of 36 patients, 12 in each group, were included in the study. Age, sex, day of admission to hospital, APACHEII scores, smoking status were similar across the groups. Lipid profiles, liver enzyme levels, CRP levels were also similar. Although initial (prenutrition) plasma native thiol, total thiol and disulfite levels were different across groups; on follow-up no difference was observed between the groups on the basis of PON1, stPON1, ARE, plasma thiol, total thiol and disulphide levels. We observe a larger variation in the expression of p62 induced by the patients' serum compared to the variation induce by the serum from healthy volunteers. p62 expression in myotubes incubated with the serum from 66 patients (ICU group) was similar to the healthy group (131 ± 4 vs. 122 ± 9 % of control; ICU vs. healthy). Interestingly, the serum from 29 ICU patients (ICU+ and  ICU Conclusion Serum from ICU patients was able to activate or block the flux of autophagy in human primary myotubes. Interestingly, even if the serum was collected during the first 24 h of admission we observed differences in the length of stay between our groups. The group inducing a block in autophagy corresponded to the long stayers patients. Ninety pH tests were done and 21 tests missed, for 12 patients. The overall mean pH was 5.2 and median pH 5.7. Stratification by drug therapy results can be found in Table 81 . A cumulative percentile chart of pH with acid inhibitor Method is reported in Fig. 103 . All patients received EN. The mean calorie deficit observed was 1513 calories, for all reasons, not the gastric pH test alone. EN was held for 1 h before the test. The lab reported results usually in 30 minutes. Length of the feeding tube to insertion point was recorded for 1 patient. All staff agreed to participate in this small study with the assurance of anonymity. Staff were observed to perform the test correctly if they a) waited 10-60 seconds prior to reading the strip; b) did not wipe the strip after immersion in the test solution. 100 % acheived accurate testing procedures. The majority of staff (approximately 80 %) correctly interpreted the pH of solutions between 1 and 4 but demonstrated slightly less accuracy with pH of 5.8 (75 % accurate), erring on the lower value on the pH indicator strip of 5.5 When challenged with a pH solution which was know to be 7, only 1 out of ten staff they could not identify the pH value since the colour change was out of range of the pH indicator strip. The remaing staff (9-90 %) incorrectly interpreted the solution as having a pH of 6). We analyzed 128 consecutive patients, with an average age of 64 years (SD 15,6), a mean APACHE II 20 (SD 8) and a mean SOFA score of 8,3 (SD 3,4). The average value of the maximum dose of NE was 0,94 μg/Kg/min (SD 0,84) and the median time to achieve it was 1 day (range 0-22). ICU mortality was 30 % and hospital mortality was 34 %. In the multivariate analysis, the maximum dose of NE was independently associated with ICU mortality (14,6 95 % CI: 6,1-34, 8; p < 0,001) and hospital mortality (9,2 95 % CI: 4,0-19,3; p < 0,001). ROC curve of the maximum dose of NE showed a high discriminative ability for ICU mortality with a r = 0, 93 (95 % CI 0,88-0,97; p < 0,001) and for hospital mortality with r = 0,87 (95 % CI 0,81-0,94, p < 0,001), with a cut-off point of maximum sensitivity (0,82) and specificity (0,83) on 1 μg/Kg/min. In-hospital mortality of patients with dose maximum of NE > 1 μg/Kg/min was 72 % versus 10,3 % in patients with lower doses and it was 100 % in the patients with septic shock with doses greater than 2 μg/Kg/min (20 cases). Baseline characteristics were similar in the HES-and the Ringer's groups. By day 2, 13 (11 %) patients in the HES group had died vs. 11 (10 %) in the Ringer's group (P = 0.91). Plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 decreased from baseline to day 2 in the HESand the Ringer's groups, but mean delta cytokine concentrations did not differ between the groups (Table 82) . Also, no associations were observed between changes in the cytokine plasma concentrations and 90-day mortality (TNF-α: odds ratio for 1-unit increase, 1.000 (95 % Confidence Interval, 0.998 -1.003), P = 0.87; IL-6: 1.001 (0.999 -1.002), P = 0.32; IL-10: 1.000 (0.999 -1.001), P = 0.89). We included 48 patients, aged 75 in average. The peak BNP concentration followed the maximum daily fluid balance by 0.57 day (SD, 2.36). In multivariate regression analysis, the delay of maximum BNP concentration after the maximum daily fluid balance was associated with older age (β 0.08, p = 0.03), but was not associated with net daily fluid balance or sites of infections. Among forty two patients enrolled in the study, demographic data and patients´characteristics were comparable among both groups. After 6 hours from resuscitation, no difference arose in the Sublingual microcirculation parameters between both groups, mean flow index after resuscitation in gelatin group (1.65 ± 0.65) which was not superior to saline group (1.74 ± 0.65). No difference was noticed in acute kidney injury nor acid base disturbance, but there was significantly greater net cumulative fluid balance in saline group 2726 (1429) ml compared to gelatin group 930 (2450) ml (P = 0.006) which indicates more fluid need for the first 24 hours in the saline group. Mean age was 65.3 ± 16 years. Sex-ratio (M/F) was 1.7. Eleven patients (31.4 %) had severe sepsis and 24 patients (68.6 %) had septic shock. Spearman's correlation coefficient between ScvO2 and SpvO2 was 0.497 (p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis of patients with severe sepsis and patients with septic shock showed a Spearman's rho coefficient of 0.727 (p = 0.011) and 0.422 (p = 0.065) respectively. In sublingual, there was a significant reduction in vascular density of animals with sepsis only after 3 hours of sepsis compared to the sham group. (Fig. 104) . This suggests that reducing the density in sepsis is only noticeable during periods of increased severity of sepsis. The comparison between the periods of sepsis showed that only the first two hours had a higher density compared to other periods of sepsis. These results have shown that in sepsis, the density of the microcirculation decreases with the severity of sepsis, however, AVA-3.0 Method was able to show differences only between extreme stages (almost normal with the stages of extreme severity), indicating a low sensitivity of the Method to differentiate small changes in density. In the gut, no changes were detected between groups and between periods, showing that the jejunum density is not variable in sepsis. These data showed that the dynamic microcirculatory is organ-specific and independent of embryological origin. In short, the evaluation of microcirculatory dysfunction is site-dependent and appears to require assessment Method also organ-specific to the kinetic measurement of microcirculatory dysfunction in sepsis.  We analyzed a series of measured parameters in six patients.  We enrolled 15 pediatric patients with septic shock of whom 5 (33 %) patients were discharged and 10 (66 %) died. Heart rate was similar between survivor and non-survivor. Note: This abstract has been previously published and is available at [1] . It is included here as a complete record of the abstracts from the conference. The response rate was 87.2 % (n = 82  This study increased moderately positive correlation exists between the perception of workers ICU patient safety, and the total score of the atmosphere of safety (r = 0.623, p < 0.000). There is a positive medium correlation between the perception of icu workers of corporate policies and departmental and between process and Methodology (r = 0.568, p < 0.01), while in the ICU General (r = 0.626, p < 0.01), compared to intensive care Cardiology (r = 0.508, P < 0.01). Two RCTs [1, 2] and one quasi-RCT [3] meeting the inclusion criteria were identified (one using a pneumatic device [1] and two using an electronic device for continuous P cuff -control [2, 3] ). All studies were single-center; none of the trials was blinded for the intervention. 465 patients were allocated to the intervention arm and 455 to the control arm. 50 VARI episodes occurred in the intervention group and 91 in the control group. The pooled Odds Ratio for the incidence of VARI was 0.45 (random effects model, 95 % confidence interval, 0.30-0.69; z = 3.68 p < 0.001). Patients were divided into two groups (those who did not develop AKI and those who did develop AKI). The incidence of acute kidney injury was 86 %. We did not observe diference between the groups in relation to males (70.0 % vs. 66.7 %, p = 0.834), age (43 ± 13 years vs. 46 ± 12 years, p = 0.493) and EuroSCORE (8.2 ± 1.6 vs. 7.4 ± 2.2, p = 0.289), respectively in no AKI and AKI group. When we compared clinical characteristics before the transplantation, we found significant differences in relation to in inotropic dosis (18.6 ± 5.1 mcg/kg/ min vs. 14.2 ± 5.9 mcg/kg/min, p = 0.037) and the use of intra-aortic balloon pump (88.9 vs. 46.7, p = 0.012), respectively in no AKI and AKI group. The outcomes length of stay and mortality were greater in the postoperative period in the group of patients who did develop AKI when compared with the group who did not develop AKI. A total of 182 nurses and other clinicians completed a pre-post assessment of self-reported levels of stress. Before the massage, clinicians rated their own level of stress as being, on average, 6 out of ten (moderate). After the 10 minute massage, stress ratings were found to decrease, with over one third of respondents reporting low levels of stress [0 or 1], and 30 % of respondents reporting "no stress". The number of clinicians reporting high levels of stress [9 or 10] decreased from 11 to 3 after the massage intervention. An independent samples T-test was used to compare the pre (mean = 6.15, standard deviation 2.02) and post (mean = 2.25, standard deviation 2.14) stress ratings. The change in self-reported levels of stress was found to be a statistically significant decrease (t-statistic = 12.5, df 181, p < .000). Thirteen patients attended prehabilitation, with improvements seen for all outcomes on completion (see Table 86 ). Post operatively, patients who attended prehabilitation were more mobile at ICU discharge (MMS 7 vs 6) and quicker to mobilise 30 m (3.2 vs 4.7 days). A reduction in LOS was also seen for prehabilitation patients in comparison to those receiving ERAS alone (14.7 days vs 17.5 days). Overall there was no difference in total task execution time between the central (M = 421 ± 107 seconds) and conventional system (M = 405 ± 119), p = 0.78. Fewer clicks were needed to execute the tasks with the centralized system compared to the conventional system (40 ± 3 and 73 ± 20 clicks respectively), p = 0.001. Fewer errors were made with the centralized system compared to the conventional system (0.9 ± 1 and 2.9 ± 2 errors respectively), p = 0.031. Questionnaire results indicated an overall preference towards the centralized system (4.6 ± 0.3 vs. 4.1 ± 0.5), p = 0.033. All patients were male, with a mean age of 74 ± 12 (55-89). 3 patients died. The most common diagnosis was community acquired pneumonia (50 %), and second was acute on chronic cardiac failure (25 %). At admission they were all classified in the very high risk group. Also, the 8 patients had one or more mayor chronic criteria. The most frequent risk factors were hypertension history or hypotension at admission (75 % respectively), age and sepsis (62.5 % respectively). All patients had early elevation of serum creatinine (sCr) of at least 0.1 mg/dl. Average days between admission to the ICU and beginning of CRRT was 3. Over 6 month period, 431 cardiac surgical admissions occurred in CTICU of those 9.28 % (n = 40) sustained AKI using the KDIGO classification. Of those 4.87 % (n = 20) sustained stage I, 1.62 % (n = 7) sustained stage II, and 2.78 % (n = 12) sustained stage III. 12.5 % (n = 5) died. 10 % (n = 4) were re-admitted to ICU and 44 % (n = 15) of those surviving, the AKI had resolved prior to hospital discharge. At baseline, there were no volumetric differences between the 3 groups (GOSE 3-5; GOSE 6-7; HV). At 5 years, patients with TBI demonstrated a significant volumetric reduction of the whole white matter (-10 ± 4 %; P < 0.01), and of the deep grey matter structures (-13 ± 10 %; P < 0.03). In contrast, HV did not present any significant change over the same period. Specifically, direct comparisons between patient groups revealed that over time GOSE 3-5 showed greater atrophy than GOSE 6-7 in the parietal lobe (-5 ± 2 vs. -3 ± 5 % respectively; P < 0.001), brain stem (-12 ± 6 vs. -6 ± 7 %; P < 0.006), corpus callosum (-19 ± 19 vs. -10 ± 15 %; P < 0.01), and cingulate (-7 ± 5 vs. -2 ± 6 %; P < 0.023). This was associated with higher depth mean on sulci data. Furthermore, FA was lower at the first MRI in GOSE 3-5 group in the same regions.Finally, neuropsychological score (Z-score) correlated significantly with the volume loss in these anatomical regions. The incorporation of time-depended (different between two occasions) PK parameters improved the model. The typical value of the volume of the central compartment (V 1 ) scaled to 70 kg was 52 L, whereas the volume of the peripheral compartment was slightly higher (V 2 = 70 L). The typical systemic clearance (CL) of DEX and the distribution clearance (Q) were 41.6 L/h and 56.8 L/h for a patient with a weight of 70 kg. The IIV estimated for the CL, Q, and V 1 and V 2 , were 56 %, 83 %, 152 %, 68 % with a strong correlation (0.7) between Q and V 1 . Those values are consistent with literature parameters in children and adults and are very close to the priors used. It was observed that volume of distribution and clearance is 1.5-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively higher during the second occasion. Conclusions Population PK model was successfully developed to describe the time course and variability of dexmedetomidine in PICU patients using allometric principles and clearance maturation model. More data is needed to fully confirm clinical significance of the phenomenon of an increase in the volume of distribution and clearance after infusion cessation. The disease status described by PRISM score, the duration of infusion, gender, body weight and age were not found to be independent significant covariates in this study. Of the 1829 patients admitted to level 3 areas at Harefield Hospital during 2015, 229 (12.5 %), required CRRT during their admission. 134 (58.5 %) of those patients were initiated on CRRT due to refractory metabolic acidosis. The median age of this group was 61 years: 70.1 % were male, 47.8 % hypertensive and 19.4 % diabetic. Most patients (113 patients, 84.3 %) were haemodynamically unstable, defined as the need for one inotropic drug at a high dose or the combination of two or more vasoactive drugs. The reason for admission also differed from the general CRRT group, with a higher frequency of heart transplantations and OOHCA, as shown in Table 87 and Fig. 113 . Time from admission to ITU to initiation of CRRT was shorter at 1 day in the refractory metabolic acidosis CRRT group vs. 4 days in the general CRRT group. The ITU mortality in the study group was 42.5 % vs. 36.2 % in the general CRRT group. Over the study period, 1,857 patients were admitted in our unit after a resuscitated OHCA. The event was related to a non-cardiac and a cardiac cause in 526 (30.7 %) and 1,057 (61.8 %) patients, respectively. The main cause of cardiac related OHCA was ischemic heart disease (78,4 %) while non-structural cardiomyopathies accounted for only 2,2 %. No diagnosis was evidenced in 127 (7.4 %) patients. In these SUD patients, baseline characteristics and one-year survival of patients under 35y were similar to those with identified non-structural cardiomyopathy. In both groups the percentage of the initial dose of norepinephrine was reduced 96 hours septic shock onset, higher in group 2 (61 %) than group 1 (54 %). ICU mortality in the series of patients globally was 19 %, higher percentage in group 1 (23 %) than in group 2 (16 %). Hospital mortality showed an increase of 8 points in group 1 and 10 points in group 2; the global hospital mortality was 29 %. Median age was 64 y.o., 61 % of patients were male. Median value of serum NGAL was 83 ng/mL. The value of serum NGAL was significant difference between the groups of eGFR > 40 ng/mL and eGFR < 40 ng/ mL (80 ng/mL v.s. 163 ng/mL, P = 0.045). Serum NGAL and CRP were significantly correlated in the group of eGFR > 40 ng/mL (R = 0.650, P < 0.001). Among the 110 patients comprehensive TnT measurements were available from 51 xenon patients (median age 63) and 53 control patients (median age 60). Complete echocardiographic data was available on 18 xenon and 20 control patients. The number of STelevation myocardial infarction and primary coronary intervention, time for return of spontaneous circulation, cardiovascular medication among other baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups.  The location of the aorta could be detected by EIT in all animals, showing a mean offset of 15 ± 7.5 mm when compared to the center of the true anatomical location identified by CT (Fig. 121) . Conclusions It is possible to detect the aorta by EIT using an intraaortic bolus of hypertonic saline. There is a misalignment between the location of the aorta identified by EIT and CT. The significance of this offset for an accurate measurement of fluid responsiveness needs to be determined in further studies. Table 100 for all values) and the concordance rate was 100 % (see Fig. 122 ). Conclusions CO EPBF performed well during hypercapnia, both during different types of low minute ventilation and increased dead space. The performance was maintained during major changes in cardiac output and trending was excellent. These results indicate that the capnodynamic method should be tested during lung protective ventilation with permissive hypercapnia and even in laparoscopic surgery. Introduction Echocardiography in the setting of the critically ill patient might be hindered due to poor transthoracic acoustic window. The modified subcostal window, which is obtained from an extrathoracic region, gives us a short-axis parasternal-like view, at the level of the great vessels. Objectives To address the consistency of cardiac output values, measured from the modified subcostal view as compared with those obtained from a transthoracic approach. Methods In 54 consecutive critically-ill patients undergoing transthoracic ecocardiography (Philips Sparq) for both initial diagnosis of shock or subsequent hemodynamic monitoring, velocity time integral of pulsed wave Doppler of the left ventricular outflow tract (VTI LVOT ) and the pulmonary flow (VTI Pu-Ps and VTI Pu-Ms ) were measured from the apical four-chamber view, the short-axis paraesternal and modified subcostal views respectively. Results were analyzed with predictive performance test and the consistency analysis. Interobserver reproducibility analysis was assessed in 20 patients with repeated measurements by two experienced physicians using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC Introduction Transcranial cerebral oximetry is a non-invasive method to monitor the changes in the cerebral oxygen metabolism. It is a near-infrared spectroscopy method that uses multi-wavelength radiation between 690-1100 nm spectrum. This photons can pass skin, bone, brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Objectives The aim of the study is to analyze the association of monitoring transcranial cerebral oximertry with morbidity and mortality in patients with postresuscitation syndrome. Methods In this study we retrospectively analyzed the data of 23 patients with postresuscitation syndrome. Introduction Classically, central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures (PAOPs) have been used as surrogates for volume measurements.However dynamic preload variables like as pulse pressure variations (PPV) and stroke volumen variations (SVV) could be very useful in hepatic postresection phase to optimize the volumen needed for the patients. Objectives The aim of this study is to assess if is better to reduce postoperative complications, optimizing hemodynamic situation after hepatic resection guided by dynamic variables preload (PPV and SVV) versus using liberal fluid management. Methods Experimental clinical trial, controlled, randomized, single blind, in patients undergoing hepatic resection. In both groups perioperative fluid restriction was done (5 ml/kg/hour of Ringer Lactate) until removal of the surgical specimen was performed. Affer that, two randomized groups were established. In the control group fluids (colloids) were administered until hemodiámica stability was achiveved and standard pressures were got (MAP > 65 mmHg CVP 8-14, urine output > 0.5 ml / kg / h). In the other group volume was administered until a SVV < 12 and a PPV < 14 and MAP > 65 mmHg were achieved. In both groups the volume administered to achieve quantified objectives and postoperative complications (nausea and vomiting, respiratory and infectious complications) was registred. Results 9 patients were enrolled in the GDT group and 10 patients in the control group. There were no statistically significant differences in preoperative variables. A statistically significant difference in the volume administered after resection in both groups (1290 +/-375 vs 128 +/-485.55, p < 0.01) was found. In the surgical time we found no correlation between VPP and CVP (r = 0,172, p = 0.656) and between the VSS and CVP (r = 0,243, p =0.492). We found very good ability to predict the Introduction Incidence of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients increases with chronic diseases, nephrotoxic drugs, and the use of contrast in diagnostic/therapeutic techniques. Contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) is strongly predictive of adverse outcomes. Objectives To build a statistical predictive model to evaluate the probability of developing contrast-associated acute kidney injury in critical patients. Methods This study has been endorsed by the Spanish Society of Intensive Critical and Emergency Care Medicine (SEMICYUC). Data were obtained in a prospective multicenter study in 33 Spanish Intensive Care Units, with a total of 1009 patients. The criteria used to define CA-AKI was the AKIN criteria: a rise of serum creatinine of ≥0.5 mg/dl or a 50 % relative rise in creatinine at 48-72 hours after contrast exposure. The predictive model has been developed employing a binary logistic regression using the software R. The ROC curve was obtained (Fig. 126 ) and the model was calibrated using this graph. From the model, we have generated a graphical nomogram (Fig. 127) to facilitate its use in a clinical environment. The nomogram includes the 4 variables shown to have prognostic value. Results 12 % of the patients developed CA-AKI. Predicting factors were elevated APACHE II test score, hemoglobin and baseline serum creatinine, shock or acute myocardium infarct at admission, vasoactive drugs and diuretics at the moment of the contrast administration, and the following comorbidities: chronic heart failure and chronic kidney failure. Significant risk factors in the univariate analysis were selected for the predictive model (Table 102) . A bootstrap method was used to select the best subset of risk factors to avoid overfitting the data. The corresponding ROC curve of the model (Fig. 126) has an area under the curve of AUC = 0.75 (range 0.71-0-79). Conclusions A predictive model of CA-AKI has been developed. Predicting variables with prognostic value are the hemoglobin content, the APACHE II test score on admission and the use of vasoactive drugs and of diuretics. The corresponding nomogram allows for easy evaluation of the probability of developing CA-AKI in critical patients. Note: This abstract has been previously published and is available at [2] . It is included here as a complete record of the abstracts from the conference. , log rank p = 0.0009 (Fig. 130) . CVVH blood flow was higher and more stable throughout sessions in the E group (p < 0.001) (Fig. 131) . Median heparin dose used for anticoagulation was higher in the C group (p < 0.001) (Fig. 132 ) but without effect on the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) all over the session. Conclusions In our experience, connection of CVVH lines to ECMO is associated with an increased lifespan of the CVVH circuit, the direct connection of CVVH circuit to ECMO allowing higher blood flow. Introduction Volume resuscitation is the mainstay of treatment in most types of shock, especially in hypovolemic, hemorrhagic and septic shock [1, 2] . Although there has been an increasing amount of research within the last decade in order to evaluate the optimal amount and composition of fluids for volume resuscitation (e.g. colloids, crystalloids, red blood cell transfusion, albumin, fresh frozen plasma), results remain inconclusive and to some extent contradictive. Objectives To evaluate the impact of amount and type of fluids administered on the use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and outcome. Methods Single-centred retrospective observational study analysing patient charts on the medical and surgical ICU of the University Hospital Basel from 2011 until 2015. Results We retrospectively analysed type and amount of fluid administered within the first 72 hours after ICU admission to patients receiving continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (RRT) or hemodialysis in the surgical or medical ICU at Basel University hospital during a 5-year period. A total of 343 ICU patients underwent RRT from 1st January 2011 to 31st December 2015 (median duration of 3 days, interquartile range (IQR) 1-7 days). We found a significant difference comparing patient survival and patient death among age (p < 0.001), SAPS II score, total volume within the first 72 hours on the ICU, fluid balance in the second and Introduction High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) is a non-invasive respiratory support that positively modifies clinical outcomes of hypoxemic Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) patients [1] . Available data suggest that HFNC support induces a number of physiological benefits over conventional oxygen therapy, however little is known about the correlation between physiological effects of HFNC and flow rates. Objective Aim of this study was to disclose whether physiological effects of HFNC linearly or non-linearly follow increased flow rates. Methods We performed a prospective randomized cross-over study on 10 hypoxemic ARF patients with PaO 2 /FiO 2 ≤ 300 mmHg while on non-invasive oxygen support. FiO 2 was set to obtain SpO 2 of 90-95 % by facial mask and left unchanged throughout the study. Patients underwent four randomized steps, lasting 20 minutes each: facial mask (gas flow 12 L/min) vs. HFNC at 30, 45 and 60 L/min. During all phases we assessed gas exchange, lung volumes by electrical impedance tomography and inspiratory effort by esophageal pressure. Data measured during the 4 steps were compared using one-way ANOVA while best fitting of linear vs. non-linear correlations was assessed by lower Akaike´s information criterion (AIC) value. Results Patients were 61 ± 10 year-old, five were female and PaO 2 / FiO 2 at enrollment was 171 ± 44 mmHg. At higher flow rates (Table 107) : PaO 2 improved (p < 0.001) while pH and PaCO 2 didn't vary; end-expiratory lung volume (ΔEELV) increased (p < 0.05) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) decreased (<0.05) suggesting positive expiratory pressure effect by increased expiratory resistance and/or improved respiratory system compliance; respiratory rate (RR) decreased (p < 0.001) and tidal volume (Vt) didn't change (p > 0.05), anyway yielding decreased minute ventilation (MV) (p < 0.01) and corrected minute ventilation (MV corr = MV*PaCO 2 /40 mmHg) (p < 0.01), indicating enhanced CO 2 removal; finally, esophageal pressure swing (ΔPes) and pressure-time product (PTPes) decreased (p < 0.01 for both). AIC for linear correlation with flow rates was lower for PaO 2 , RR, ΔEELV and PEF, as if improved aeration and its effects on oxygenation constantly increase with flow; while non-linear AIC was lower for MV, MV corr , ΔPes and PTPes, possibly suggesting that most of the improvement in CO 2 wash-out from upper airway dead space and its consequences on patient's effort is already obtained at 30 L/min. Conclusions HFNC induces multiple beneficial physiologic effects that might delay respiratory decompensation and improve clinical outcomes. However, not all effects linearly increase with HFNC flow so that its selection might be personalized to target the most clinically relevant physiologic derangement. Introduction CIP appears frequently in ICU and can occur in up to 25 % of patients. After extubation CIP causes poor airway clearance due to respiratory muscle weakness and can lead to respiratory failure and reintubation. Reintubation, which increases severity of illness, is an independent risk of nosocomial pneumonia, increased hospital stay and mortality. Currently, standard treatment includes respiratory physiotherapy with manual assisted cough. However respiratory failures still occurs in 30 % of patients within 48 hours after planned extubation. Though we conducted a study evaluating, in patients with CIP, the efficiency of MI-E device in the prevention of respiratory failure during 48 hours after extubation. MI-E is a non-invasive technic to assist respiratory physiotherapy which aims to suction tracheal mucus. MI-E has been evaluated for neuromuscular disease patients, and it has been shown to increase peak expiratory flow and to improve airway clearance. Objectives Primary outcome: Incidence of respiratory failure after extubation Secondary outcomes: reintubation rate mean length of stay in ICU mortality at day 28 Methods In a medical ICU of a university hospital we conducted a prospective randomized open study in two parallel groups. All intubated patients were screened with a Medical Research Council (MRC) muscular test. Patients were diagnosed CIP if the MRC score was equal or under 48/60. All patients with CIP and without exclusion criteria were randomized in the study. During the treatment period, patients received two daily session of MI-E plus manually assisted coughing or standard treatment (manually assisted coughing). Results 123 patients were included in three years, 62 in the standard group, and 61 in the MI-E group. There was no difference between the two groups at baseline. The results show no difference for the primary outcome (p 0,6022): 7/62 respiratory failures in the standard group (11,5 %), 10/61 in the MI-E group (16,4 %). For the secondary outcomes, we found no statistical difference concerning reintubation (3.6 % vs 7 %), mean length of stay in ICU (6,5 vs 7,9 days) and mortality at day 28 (14.8 % vs 18.3 %) Conclusions The study demonstrated no superiority of the MI-E device in the prevention of post-extubation respiratory failure for ICU patients with CIP. Introduction The noise is associated with morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients, related to sleep fragmentation and delirium primarily (1-3). The ventilation devices can generate noise, with further impact on the effectiveness of the technique. An example is the noninvasive CPAP devices and high nasal flow, widely used in ICU (4) . Objectives To evaluate the intensity of the noise level as perceived by the patient and to compare the difference in noise intensity between several different devices for non-invasive respiratory support at different levels of assistance. Methods Made in patients with acute respiratory failure, and pulmonary dummy-simulator with spontaneous breathing, were connected to differents device CPAP with 5, 10, 12.5, and 15cmH2O, as high flow system 35-110 L/min. We studied 3 models of noninvasive CPAP (Wisperflow/Vital Signs; Ventumask® HF, Starmed, Intersurgical; valve-Boussignac®, Vigon); device of high flow: Optiflow®-MR850 with Whisperflow high flow generator, and Airvo2® Fisher & Paykel. The flow is measured with Ohmeda 5410 Volume Monitor. The intensity of sound is measured at ear level using Speedlink SL-8691-SBK-01 microphones. The audio signal is recorded for 60 seconds in wav format (22,050 KHz). Three measurements were performed for each level of assistance and devices. The noise intensity was obtained from the spectral power (PSD) of sound pressure waves, hanning windows and fast Fourier transform was used. PSD is reported in decibels sound pressure level (dB SPL)/KHz, where: dB SPL = 20 log(P/P0), P is intensity of the stimulus, and P0 the reference's intensity at the threshold of human hearing at the frequency of 1 kHz. Analysis was perfomed with software Matlab R2008a of the maximum and mean (SD) spectral power/frequency of each signal. The comparisons are performed by analysis of variance for multiple samples. After propensity score matching (23 HNFC patients vs 23 MV patients), no significant differences were observed in RAGE, SP-D, ANG-2, IL6, IL8, IL33 and ST2 between matched patients who were treated with HFNC at ARDS onset and those who were intubated. After matching, no differences in mortality or length of stay were observed. All biomarkers with the exception of IL33 were higher in both groups of matched ARDS patients than in both control groups. Conclusions Acute hypoxemic patients with bilateral infiltrates treated with HFNC present a similar pattern of biomarkers of inflammation and injury compared with those ARDS patients who were directly mechanically ventilated. The results suggest that these HFNC patients may be considered as ARDS patients. Changes in mean blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and PaO2/FiO2 values induced by the procedure did not reach significance (P > 0.05). Over one year 87 patients were eligible for the study; the measure of PCEF was impossible to achieve because of lack of understanding in 14 patients (16 %). Among the 73 patients included for the analysis, there was a significant correlation between the measures obtained with the Piko-1 and the Servo i (r s = 0.831; p < 0.01) (Fig. 135) . The linear regression line obtained predicts a cut-off value of PCEF on the Servo i at 60 l/min, corresponding to the value at 35 l/min previously determined with the Piko-1 [1] . Conclusions The measure of PCEF just before extubation on the screen of the ventilator Servo i is easy to perform and well correlated with the measure performed by an electronic flowmeter Piko-1. This allows to propose a cut-off value of 60 l/min with the ventilator, below which the cough strength may be judged as weak. Objectives To compare HFNC vs. NIV induced changes in inspiratory work of breathing assessed by the thickening fraction of the diaphragm (TFdi), and breathing pattern, hemodynamics, dyspnea and comfort. Methods CF patients with acute exacerbation requiring ventilator support were ventilated with HFNC and NIV for 30 minutes in random order. TFdi was measured using ultrasound at baseline and at 25 minutes with each device. Pulse oximetry (SpO 2 ), transcutaneous CO 2 (PtcCO 2 ) were continuously recorded and respiratory rate, tidal volume (V T ) and minute ventilation (MV) measured by bio-impedance techniques; hemodynamics, dyspnea and comfort assessed by visual analog scales were also recorded. Results were compared using a Mann Whitney, 2 tailed test, and are expressed as mean (SD) with each intervention compared to baseline conditions. Results 12 patients were enrolled (mean age 31.3 years, mean FEV 1 / FVC 49.9 %, mean FEV 1 28.4 % predicted). TFdi was similar with the two techniques, but HFNC, compared to NIV, resulted in a significant decrease in respiratory rate (-20.2 % (18.0) vs -0.2 % (18.7), p = 0.024) and a lower mean arterial pressure (0.3 % (5.6) vs 5.8 % (4.9), p = 0.017). No significant differences were found in heart rate, SpO 2 , PtcCO 2 , V T , MV, comfort and dyspnea (Table 111) . Conclusions HFNC was not inferior to NIV with respect to diaphragmatic work in CF patients who had an indication for ventilator support. These preliminary data suggest that HFNC may confer physiological benefits by decreasing respiratory rate, and constitute an interesting alternative to NIV. Introduction The washout effect of HFNC has not been well evaluated. Our prior study, presented at the ESICM congress 2014, evaluated the reduction of P ET CO 2 with HFNC using a tracheal intubation trainer and a test lung. Although we concluded that the washout effect is most effective with a relatively low flow, the model had a large upper airway dead space of 200 mL, which was thought to have influenced P ET CO 2 . We also were not able to measure PEEP, which is also thought to have interaction between HFNC flows. Therefore, we developed a more sophisticated artificial respiratory model using a 3D printer, and used a lung model equipped with a pressure sensor to quantitatively evaluate the washout effect of HFNC and the interaction with PEEP. Objectives To quantitatively evaluate the washout effect and interaction with PEEP using different levels of HFNC flow. Methods The airway model was made by a 3D printer using the craniocervical CT data of a healthy 32-year-old male. The total anatomical dead space was adjusted to 180 mL (3 mL/kg). The model lung (LUNGOO : Air water safety service Inc., Kobe, Japan) had the following settings: normal (Compliance (C) 50 ml/cmH 2 O, resistance (R) 5 cmH 2 O/L/s, tidal volume (Vt) of 500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) 16 /min), obstructive (C 70, R 20, Vt 700, RR 10), restrictive (C 30, R 5, Vt 300, RR 30) with inspiratory time at 1 second, and residual volume of 1000 mL. CO 2 was infused into respiratory lung models to reach P ET CO 2 of 40 mmHg without HFNC. After setting P ET CO 2 with each lung model, HFNC with flows of 10 to 60 L/min were applied and the change in P ET CO 2 in the subglottic area and the inlet of the lung model was measured. PEEP inside the model was also recorded. Conclusions The washout effect of HFNC is thought to reduce the P ET CO 2 enough to have a clinical effect. Contrary to the relation of HFNC flow and generated PEEP, the HFNC reduced P ET CO 2 with a relatively low flow in open mouth models. HFNC required more flow to reduce P ET CO 2 with a closed mouth model, which is thought to be due to a less efficient washing out of the dead space than in the open model. Grant acknowledgment Nothing to Declare. Introduction Clinical frailty is increasingly used and recognised to predict mortality and functional dependence following critical admission 1 although less is known regarding its impact on specific patient groups. Bilevel noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is frequently used to treat acute respiratory failure (ARF) of various aetiologies. Whilst NIV is known to be beneficial in exacerbations of COPD 2 , acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema 3 and other presentations of ARF, there is scarce data available on the impact frailty may have on the success of NIV in this patient group. Objective We examined the impact of frailty score on outcomes in patients receiving NIV for mixed aetiology of ARF within our critical care (CC) unit. Methods Case notes and electronic patient data records (Metavision,iMDsoft,MA,USA) were retrospectively reviewed for adult patients with ARF who received NIV between December 2011 and April 2013. Patients who received continuous positive airway pressure and those with a primary surgical problem were excluded. Patient frailty score was recorded on admission using the Rockwood frailty index in on 55 consecutive patients. Demographic data, body mass index (BMI), primary cause of ARF and hospital mortality were recorded.Patients were divided into two groups according to their frailty score: below 4 (very fit to vulnerable) and 5 and above (frail to severely frail). Results 55 patients were identified. 44 % were male, mean age 63 years. Presenting diagnosis was pneumonia in 32 patients (58 %) and acute exacerbation of COPD in 13 patients (23 %). The overall CC survival rate was 84 % with 73 % surviving to hospital discharge. 31 patients had a frailty score of 5 or above (77 % male, mean age 66 years) and 24 patients had a frailty score of 4 or less (50 % male, mean age of 62 years). Patients with a lower frailty score had a higher overall survival rate (91 % on CC and 83 % to hospital discharge) compared to those with a higher frailty score (70 % on CC and 51 % to hospital discharge). The mean BMI for both groups was identical (30.5 kg/m 2 ). There were no differences in the mean length of stay in CC or in hospital or duration of NIV use between the two groups. Conclusion Our data suggests that a Rockwood frailty score of 5 or above is associated with reduced CC and hospital survival in patients with ARF requiring NIV. Use of a frailty index may be a useful predictive marker in patients admitted to critical care and further work is warranted to define the prognostic value of frailty scoring. Introduction The use of high flow therapy in the critical care units for adults is becoming more common from few years on. This therapy approaches the patient with acute respiratory failure from a new way of treatment. Objectives Our goal is to analyze the impact and the results of the application of high flow therapy in an intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital. Evaluate if the use of such a therapy has avoided the use of mechanical ventilation in the patients. The questionnaire contains 271 questions. It is currently being tested in a pilot study with 650 patients, recruited six months to three years after discharge from the ICU, and 200 controls, matched for age and gender. The questionnaire is sent by mail after an invitation letter followed by a phone call, and returned in a pre-stamped envelope. Returned questionnaires are being scanned and data digitally imported into SPSS, where additional clinical data will be added. After comparison with controls, item reduction will follow, resulting in an ICU-specific PROM questionnaire. Conclusions A patient-centred, ICU-specific questionnaire will be available for long-term follow-up in the post-ICU clinic. Being a postal document, the patients do not have to return to the hospital to provide their information, making it and suitable for large-scale studies. Introduction Approximately 2000 oesophagogasterectomies are performed each year, with a 5 year survival of 25 % and 30 day mortality of 10 % 1 . Secondary analysis of ICNARC data has shown the median length of stay to be 2.8 days, and a readmission rate of 12.2 % 2 . We conducted a retrospective review of all post Oesophagogastrectomies ICU admissions in our hospital between Jan 2014-15, as part of a quality improvement project to reduce morbidity and length of stay (LOS). Objective To analyse the electronic record and chest Xray of every oesophagogastrectomy in order to compare our own LOS, patient characteristics and identify factors affecting LOS and unit morbidity. Conclusion Epidural disconnection rate was very high, contributing to a longer unit LOS than national average and higher pain scores. We have introduced a training package on epidural care for our nurses and encouraged the use of tunnelled epidurals in combination with paravertebral catheters. The incidence of CXR changes after surgery in this cohort has not been studied previously. A large proportion of our patients had radiologically apparent collapse and even consolidation on arrival on ICU. This may contribute to the development of pneumonia in this setting if analgesia is imperfect as CPAP is relatively contraindicated due to the oesophageal anastomosis. We now encourage a longer period in recovery, with lung toilet and recruitment manoeuvres at the end of one-lung ventilation. Introduction Pancreatitis is a common precipitant of critical illness and intensive care admission. Mortality from pancreatitis overall should be under 10 % and in severe pancreatitis under 30 % (1). Mortality risk is mulit-factorial but those at high risk are co-morbid, elderly, develop SIRS or progress to pancreatic necrosis. We sought to look at all of our pancreatitis admissions to ICU over a 21 year period and identify the average demographics and difference between survivors and non survivors. Objectives To identify patients admitted to ICU with a primary diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, and to compare predicted demographics and features of systemic inflammatory response between survivors and non survivors. We hypothesised that if you required Intensive Care for the management of severe pancreatitis, death is likely to occur at the beginning of your ICU stay due to overwhelming organ failure. If you were to survive the initial insult, it was hypothesised that you may survive to hospital discharge, although the length of hospital stay would be prolonged. We sought to test this theory with our patient group. Methods A retrospective audit of patients admitted to ICU in the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary, Southern General and Queen Elizabeth University hospital from 1994 to 2015. Patients were identified on Wardwatcher via a search of APACHE II diagnosis including pancreatitis. Data was collected from patient profiles on the Wardwatcher and TrakCare CIS. Results 182 patients were identified with an admission diagnosis of pancreatitis from 12704 patients admitted giving an incidence of 1.4 % of all ICU admissions. Other results are as demonstrated below with with all data being presented as mean and 95 % confidence intervals with p-values from Student´s unpaired t-test where applicable. Conclusions As could be predicted, pancreatitis is a diagnosis of the older male population in ICU, likely as a result of the concomitant problem of alcohol abuse in the West of Scotland. These patients have a higher than normal APACHE-II score and predicted mortality compared with unit averages. All SIRS criteria were met when looking at average data, hence why their likely admission to ICU. When comparing survivors to non-survivors, survivors were significantly more likely to be younger, with lower APACHE-II scores and predicted mortality. There was no difference in length of stay between groups nor degree of derangement of any of the SIRS criteria. Conclusions Though there were not many SCI patients admitted in the unit compared to other patients. SCI patients stayed longer by 5 days on average. Three main reasons were identified why they stayed longer; one was because of ISCoPE research, the other one was their dependency on advance organ support and lastly, the delayed discharges because of shortage of ward beds. The delayed discharges could indicate that the hospital needs to increase the bed capacity. The patients' outcome appears encouraging with their improved outcome. A further audit is necessary to see any changes. Introduction Emergency laparotomy is associated with a high risk of mortality and morbidity, which leads to significant financial expenditures for the NHS. In a recent study, the Emergency Laparotomy Pathway Quality Improvement Care (ELPQUIC) program has shown that a set of sequential interventions have the potential to improve clinical outcome; however related costs or savings remain unknown. Objective This economic evaluation aims to evaluate costs and the cost-effectiveness of a clinical pathway for patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, compared to a historical cohort receiving standard care. Methods 299 consecutive patients in the control group were compared with 427 patients directed into a predefined pathway. To assess costs and cost-effectiveness, two decision models were constructed; the first model took hospitals management perspective, the second model took a societal perspective and evaluated lifetime costs and quality adjusted life years. Results One time implementation costs of £23,406.7/hospital (£1,399.0-£31,793.0) for training, supervision, purchase of equipment and pharmaceuticals can be expected. However, these costs were offset after treating 26 patients, mainly due to reduced LOS and lower complication rates. The long-term model showed that the intervention is both more effective (2.4 month) and leads to lower costs to society (cost savings of £899.6/patient). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is £-4,015.9, meaning the new pathway is the dominant strategy and should be recommended to decision makers. Conclusion A bundled pathway to improve clinical care for patients undergoing emergency laparotomy has shown to reduce mortality, seems cost-effective and has the potential to improve clinical outcome and lower costs for society. Decision makers need to adopt a long-term vision and be prepared to make one off investments to lower future costs. the ED with ICU mortality (OR = 1.01; p = 0.73). This result was not altered after adjusting for SAPSII, age, gender, trauma, acute kidney injury or year of admission. Of relevance, there was also no association with ICU mortality and an excess of 12 hours in the emergency department. Finally, there was no association between time spent in the ED and hospital mortality (OR = 1.2; p = 0.13), ventilation time (p = 0.6) or nosocomial infection (p = 0.8). Conclusions Unnecessary time spent in the ED has the potential to adversely affect the care and to overwhelm crucial ED resources. In our single-center retrospective study we did not find any association between the absolute time spent in the ED and ICU mortality, and we cannot recommend any clinically relevant specific time frame. Meanwhile, patients should be transferred to the ICU from the emergency department as soon as possible and further research is needed to develop potential quality indicators. Objectives Several studies have demonstrated a decrease of mortality under mechanical protective ventilation with low tidal volumes (6-8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight) not only in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but also in ICU patients without criteria of pulmonary injury, The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility of a daily checklist applied to all the patients under mechanical ventilation (MV) admitted to an ICU as well as to identify the factors influencing the achievement of the goal to keep the tidal volume at 6-8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight Methods A prospective study including all the patients admitted to an ICU during a four-months study period. A daily-based register was implemented for all the ICU patients under MV during the morning, the afternoon and the night shifts. We analyse the degree of compliance with the checklist, as well as the influence on the achievement of the goal for tidal volume of the following factors: height, sex, type of MV (Continuous Mandatory Ventilation-CMV, Pressure Control Ventilation-PCV, Bi-level positive airway pressure-BiPAP, Synchronized Intermittentmandatory Ventilation-SIMV, Pressure Support Ventilation-PSV), gaseous exchange (relation paO2/FiO2), pulmonary mechanics (plateau pressure). Results We registered 883 measurements (36 % in the morning shifts, 31 % in the afternoon and 33 % in the night shift) for all the patients with MV (either with ARDS or without criteria of pulmonary injury). No patient developed ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). The percentage of measurements outside the established goal of tidal volume was 28,7 % (CI 95 % 23.9-33.9 %) without differences between the shifts. The average tidal volume was of 443.9 ml (range 431-457) that corresponds to 7.5 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (IC 95 %: 7,35-7,66). In univariate analysis the factors associated to being outside of the goal for tidal volume were: female sex, height and the Pressure Support Ventilation-PSV as opposite to mandatory modes with no influence of the shifts of work, the relation paO2/FiO2 and the plateau pressure. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the factors independently associated with being outside of the goal for tidal volume were female sex and the Pressure Support Ventilation-PSV. Conclusions In almost 30 % of the ICU patients under MV the goal of low tidal volumes is not achieved, especially in female patients and in those under Pressure Support Ventilation. The establishment of a daily checklist for patients under VM is feasible and could influence in a low frequency of VILI in patients with ARDS and also in those without criteria of pulmonary injury.
