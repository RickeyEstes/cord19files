During the study period, 4638 respiratory specimens were processed for viral culture (Fig. 1 ). Of those, 196 (4.2%) specimens were culture +/PCR-and 144 (3.1%) specimens were included in the analysis. Excluded specimens included 39 duplicate samples and 13 sold service specimens (medical record unavailable). Subjects were mostly male (63.2%) and 118 (81.9%) were hospitalized (Table 1) . Sixty-two patients (43.1%) were previously healthy and without known comorbidities. The mean age was 2.35 Â± 3.4 years. Most specimens were nasopharyngeal samples (95%). The working diagnoses that most frequently prompted respiratory virus testing were unspecified febrile illness (30.6%) and lower respiratory tract infection (24.3%). There were 14 specimens (9.7%) that were processed for viral culture without clear indication. The mean turnaround time for a positive viral culture result was 9 days ( Table 2 ). Viruses that were not part of the PCR assay comprised 53.5% of culture-positive specimens. The most frequently isolated viruses were cytomegalovirus (33.3%) and enteroviruses (19.4%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, factors independently associated with recovering a respiratory virus in cell culture (compared to other viruses) were a working diagnosis of upper or lower respiratory tract infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.88, 95% CI 1.87-12.76), malignancy comorbidity (aOR 5.71, 95% CI 1.38-23.71) and lymphopenia (aOR 2.91, 95% CI 1.13-7.52). Cell culture results prompted a change in management in only 5 patients (3.5% of positive cultures, 0.1% of all cultures done), all of whom had acyclovir initiated for localized HSV-1 infection. Four of these had skin or mucosal lesions that could have been or were sampled to establish a diagnosis. One of the 5 patients was immunosuppressed (receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy), and none were neonates. Moreover, mumps, a reportable disease, was isolated in one patient in which mumps infection was not suspected. Communication with a patient's family regarding culture results was documented in 4 instances where management had not been otherwise affected. No instances of cessation of antibiotics, discharge from hospital or initiation of antivirals for influenza or other respiratory viruses were observed in association with positive viral culture results.
