Expression of SOX2 in BCC tissues and cell lines. BCC tissue samples (12 patients) and BCC cell lines were used to analyze the expression of SOX2. It was demonstrated that SOX2 was overexpressed in BCC tissue samples when compared with normal basal tissue, as determined by IHC staining (Fig. 1A) . As shown in Fig. 1B , it was demonstrated that SOX2 expression was upregulated in BCC tissue compared with normal tissue. SOX2 gene and protein expression levels were also upregulated in BCC cell lines as compared with the normal basal cell line ( Fig. 1C and D) . These results suggested that SOX2 expression levels were upregulated in BCC tissues and cells. SOX2 knockdown inhibits BCC cell migration and invasion in vitro. The role of SOX2 in BCC cells was next analyzed. It was observed that SOX2 knockdown by siRNA-SOX2 transfection markedly downregulated the expression of SOX2, while SOX2 overexpression by pSOX2 transfection markedly upregulated SOX2 expression in BCC cells, indicating that the transfections were successfully performed ( Fig. 2A and B) . The results then demonstrated that SOX2 overexpression promoted the cell migration and invasion ( Fig. 2C and D) , while SOX2 knockdown inhibited the migration and invasion of BCC cells (Fig. 2E and F) . These results suggest that SOX2 expression is associated with BCC cell migration and invasion.
