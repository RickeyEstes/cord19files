The PGYD training institutions consisted of two groups: the single and joint groups. The role and responsibility of the single training institutions were that they served as the main training institutions; while the joint training group comprised of one main training institution along with several collaborating ones. The upper limit of the joint training group was 30 and it required training institutions with different types such as hospital and clinics. The PGYD projects could be mainly divided into 4 groups by differentiating whether the main training institution was hospital or clinic. The four PGYD project types were: hospital as the single training institution (project A), clinic as the single training institution (project B), hospital as the main training institution in the joint training group (project C), and clinic as the main training institution in the joint training group (project D). Moreover, each individual training institution could participate in at most three projects and could only apply to be as a main training institution for one of the projects. For example, if the one training institution participated in three projects, one served as the main training institution while the other two should be the collaborating training institutions. By the analyses of the qualified name lists of the PGYD training projects and institutions from 2010 to 2018, the change of the project and institution numbers and geographical distribution of the PGYD training institutions were described as follows: The year-by-year shift of the number of PGYD training projects from 2010 to 2018 Since the PGYD policy had been implemented, the total number of training project grew from 119 in 2010 to 195 in 2018. The most common type of PGYD training project was the project B (307 projects, 41.8%), followed by the project A (249 projects, 33.9%), the project D (101 projects, 13.7%), and the project C (78 projects, 10.6%) ( Table 1 ).
