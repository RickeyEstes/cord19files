The study group was 67% female, with a mean age of 20.56 years (standard deviation 6 4.71; range, 18 to 55 years). The ethnic breakdown was 51% white, 32% Hispanic, 3% American Indian or Alaska native, 3% Asian or Pacific Islander, 2% black, and 9% mixed or other. The college year breakdown was 51% freshmen, 21% sophomores, 18% juniors, and 10% seniors. The mean annual income was $12,403 6 $1,195 (range, $0 to $130,000). Before reading the WHO fact sheet, each participant answered the questions about familiarity with the avian flu. The distribution of responses to the ''how familiar are you with the avian influenza?'' were 16% for ''never heard of it,'' 55% for ''heard of it but cannot recall details,'' 28% for ''generally familiar and can recall some details,'' and 1% for ''knowledgeable and can recall many details.'' The correct responses to the 3 true/ false questions were 71% for ''avian flu refers to a large group of different influenza viruses that primarily affect birds,'' 71% for ''H5N1 is a particularly virulent form of avian influenza for which there is no vaccine,'' and 28% for ''the H5N1 virus jumps easily to humans and spreads readily and sustainably among humans.'' After reading the WHO fact sheet, the participant was asked questions regarding expectations related to an avian flu outbreak. Although these questions were partially addressed in the WHO fact sheet, no definitive answers were given, leaving room for individual participants to respond differently. Our goal was to provide the most current information relevant to these questions and then see how the participants interpreted it. Table 1 displays the results. First, the participants were asked how likely they thought that bird-to-bird, bird-to-human, or human-to-human transmission of H5N1 was outside the United States, within the United States, and within New Mexico. For each type of transmission, there was a significant decrease in perceived likelihood when comparing transmission outside the United States to within the United States and transmission within the United States to within New Mexico. For each location, there was a significant decrease in perceived likelihood when comparing bird-to-bird with bird-to-human transmission and bird-to-human with human-to-human transmission. Figure 1 shows these changes. Second, the participants were asked questions about how severe he or she thought that a human-to-human outbreak in New Mexico would be, and whether the public health response would be adequate. Most of the participants indicated that it was at least ''likely'' that there would be a high fatality rate (72%), patients would suffer permanent physical damage (69%), and family members would contract the infection (64%). The majority also thought it would be at least ''likely'' that there would be inadequate vaccine supplies (86%), medicine and treatment (79%), and infection control measures in hospitals (74%). Next, we conducted principal components analyses (PCAs) with an oblimin rotation for the behavioral items. We used an oblimin rotation because it is preferred when the components are correlated. 25 We expected the components to be correlated, and found that most of the resulting behavior scores were correlated in our path analysis model. Table 2 displays the results of these analyses. For each scenario, there were 4 components, with the same items composing each component. These components were termed ''avoidance,'' ''helping,'' ''illegal,'' and ''sacrifice.'' We computed avoidance, helping, illegal, and sacrifice scores for scenario 1, scenario 2, and both scenarios combined using the items identified in the PCAs. We used the items rather than component scores so that our results could be compared with other studies using the same items. Cronbach's alphas for avoidance, helping, illegal, and sacrifice were 0.884, 0.725, 0.837, and 0.906 in scenario 1 and 0.897, 0.641, 0.836, and 0.882 in scenario 2. We used the scores for scenarios 1 and 2 for cross-scenario and cross-sex comparisons and used the average of both scores for the correlation and path analyses. Table 3 shows the cross-scenario and cross-sex means and standard deviations for the emotional and behavioral responses. We used a Bonferroni correction to adjust for the 18 t-tests represented in Table 3 , changing the alpha value to 0.0028 (P , .05/18). 26 Females scored lower on positive emotion than males in both scenarios 1 and 2, and females scored higher on negative emotion than males in scenario 2. For the sample as a whole, all of the emotional and behavioral responses demonstrated significant increases from scenario 1 to scenario 2. We also compared behavioral responses within each scenario using paired-sample t-tests. Once again, we used a Bonferroni correlation to adjust for the 12 t-tests, changing the alpha value to 0.0042 (P , .05/ 12). All differences were significant; the most likely behavior for each scenario was sacrifice, followed by helping, avoidance, and illegal behavior. For the whole sample, the mean normal levels of positive and negative emotion were 3.46 6 0.65 and 1.72 6 0.55, respectively. We compared these normal levels of positive and negative emotion with the emotions during scenarios 1 and 2 using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, with a 5 0.0125 (P , .05/4). Positive emotion for scenarios 1 and 2 was significantly below the normal level (t 5 19.621, P , .001, d 5 1.210 and t 5 20.764, P , .001, d 5 1.350, respectively). Negative emotion for scenarios 1 and 2 was significantly above the normal level (t 5 -13.030, P , .001, d 5 .901 and t 5 -20.047, P , .001, d 5 1.420, respectively). These differences are displayed in Fig 2. Table 4 presents the descriptive statistics and correlations for the individual differences and the emotional and behavioral responses averaged across both scenarios. The first hypothesis was that the protective factors (income, optimism, resilience, spirituality, and social support) would predict greater positive emotion. This hypothesis generally was supported, in that 3 of 5 possible correlations were significant in the expected direction. The second hypothesis was that the risk factors (neuroticism and social strain) would predict greater negative emotion. This was supported, in that both correlations were significant in the expected direction. The third hypothesis was that emotion would predict behavioral responses. This generally was supported, in that 4 out of 8 possible correlations were significant.
