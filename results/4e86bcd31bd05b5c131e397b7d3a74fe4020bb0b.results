A total of 88,956 HALYs (729 per 100,000 population) were estimated to have been lost annually due to the 51 infectious agents and associated syndromes studied; 74,297 (83.5%) years of life were lost due to premature mortality (YLL) and 14,668 (16.5%) were due to YERF (table 1) . There was modest correlation between YLL and YERF (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.56). The ten highest burden pathogens were HCV, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, HPV, HBV, HIV, Staphylococcus aureus, influenza virus, Clostridium difficile, and rhinovirus. YLL exceeded YERF for most pathogens. Nearly 50% of the burden was attributed to five pathogens. The top ten pathogens accounted for approximately 67% of total HALYs and the top 20 pathogens accounted for 75%. We estimated that these infectious diseases accounted for 5390 deaths (44.2 per 100,000) and 7,196,349 incident cases (58,987 per 100,000) annually in Ontario (table 2) . E. coli, S. pneumoniae, HCV, HBV, and C. difficile accounted for the greatest numbers of deaths, while rhinovirus, influenza virus, S. pneumoniae, coronavirus, and E. coli accounted for the greatest number of incident cases. Among the 20 leading pathogens, the overall burden was comparable between the sexes. However, we observed a number of sex-specific differences (figure 1); HCV, HBV, and HIV had a greater impact on males, while HPV, E. coli, gonorrhea, and chlamydia had a greater impact on females. The top three selected infectious disease syndromes (pneumonia, septicaemia, and urinary tract infections) accounted for 74% of the total syndrome HALYs lost. Among these syndromes, pneumonia accounted for the greatest proportion of total HALYs (figure 2). For most syndromes, YLL accounted for a greater burden than YERF. The exceptions were acute bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, pharyngitis, and conjunctivitis. The ranking of infectious diseases using the GBD methodology was generally similar (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0.88), but the GBD methodology indicated a greater proportion of the burden attributable to premature morbidity (51.2%) versus mortality (48.8%; table 3).
