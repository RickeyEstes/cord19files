In this work, we have recruited a total of 100 patients with flu symptoms from November 2014 to May 2015 (their information is shown in Table S1 ). Among them, throat swabs were collected from all patients (IDs: 1-100), and 50 of them (IDs: 1-36 and 87-100) were further asked to collect their EBC samples using the PKU BioScreen. The EBC volume for each of the patients was more than 100 ÂµL, which was adequate for further LAMP analysis. Overall, we have shown that certain bacterial pathogens can be exhaled out, and the developed pathogen screening protocol that integrates EBC and LAMP can be used as one non-invasive rapid respiratory pathogen screening method.
