In the study period of 14 months (March 2014-April 2015), we randomly selected and examined a total of 67 healthy rodents of various breeds, housed in the AAALAC-certified facility at the Animal Experimental Unit, University of Malaya. This was performed as part of the health monitoring program to ensure that the rodents are free of specific pathogens that could affect scientific experiments. A total of 13 commensal E. coli strains were recovered on MacConkey agars, from the gastrointestinal tract, liver and, the trachea and lung of laboratory rodents (Table 2) . Accession numbers for the partial 16S rDNA sequences of the 13 commensal E. coli strains include, LT009415-LT009427. All 13 commensal E. coli strains in this study were recovered from female rodents. These 13 strains were cultured from 10 different, individual female rodents and, we did not manage to isolate E. coli from the remaining 54 rodents. E. coli was isolated mainly from the gastrointestinal tract (n = 6) and, the trachea and lung (n = 5), with the remaining 2 strains from the liver. A majority of the commensal E. coli strains were found in ICR mice (n = 8). Meanwhile, C57BL/6 mice harbored 2 strains and, the BALB/c mouse, Sprague-Dawley and Wistar Kyoto rats, each harbored 1 strain. Two E. coli strains were isolated from the different organs of 3 individual ICR mice. Strains UM-AEU197 and 198 were isolated from the liver and, the trachea and lung of ICR mouse #1, respectively. Strains UM-AEU202 and 203 were isolated respectively, from the liver and, the trachea and lung of ICR mouse #2. The trachea and lung, and the gastrointestinal tract of ICR mouse #3 sheltered strains UM-AEU213 and 214, respectively ( Table 2) . Analysis of the commensal E. coli strains by MLST revealed 13 strains with 4 novel and 1 common STs ( Table 2) . The E. coli strains recovered from ICR mice, were designated into ST748 and ST749. Strains recovered from Sprague-Dawley and Wistar Kyoto rats were designated into ST746 and ST747, respectively. In addition, ST747 was also found in a C57BL/6 mouse. The sole common E. coli ST357 was recovered from the gastrointestinal tract of another C57BL/6 mouse. The gastrointestinal tract was found to harbor all 5 different STs (ST357, ST746, ST747, ST748 and ST749) in this study. The liver and, the trachea and lung however, only harbored ST749 and it was also the most frequent ST encountered. Analysis into the phylogroups of the commensal E. coli strains by the quadruplex PCR method revealed that all 13 strains belonged to phylogroup A ( Table 2 ). The alignments of all eight E. coli MLST loci relative to the respective reference Allele 1 are shown in Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The multiplex PCRs to detect the most common clinically significant Shiga toxin-producing E. coli serotypes showed that all 13 commensal E. coli strains in this study did not belong to any of the serotypes (Additional file 9). Similarly, we observed negative ESBL activity in the 13 commensal E. coli strains when tested using the ESBL phenotypic confirmatory method (Table 3) . Negative ESBL activity however, does not necessarily mean that the E. coli strain is negative for ESBL encoding genes, therefore a series of nucleic acid amplifications for the detection of ESBL encoding genes was performed. However, no ESBL encoding gene was amplified from the commensal E. coli strains recovered in our study (Additional files 10, 11, 12). Testing of the animal housing environment, feed and drinking water of the laboratory rodents for the presence of E. coli showed that only the wash basin sample resulted in positive E. coli culture. The cultured E. coli strain belonged to phylogroup B1 and no ESBL genes (Table 4 ).
