Across both surveys, 3034 people were enrolled of which 830 (27%) were able to be traced back to their compounds and included in the analysis. Those that could not be traced were mainly due to running out of time and inaccurate information provided at the facility. The participants that could not be traced were evenly distributed between years and facilities.
