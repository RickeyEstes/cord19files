A schematic diagram of inclusion/exclusion criteria used for the selection of study/reference populations is depicted in Fig. 1 . According to the HDRs database of Sicily, a total of 3,141,936 admissions were recorded during the study period, of which 67.1% (n ¼ 2,104,609/3,141,936) were regular hospital admissions and about one-half (54.0%; n ¼ 1,138,092/ 2,107,609) were through Emergency Departments (EDs). On the whole, ICU hospitalizations in Sicily accounted for 3.1% (n ¼ 35,672/1,138,092) of total ED-related admissions and about 1.7% (n ¼ 622/35,672) included ICD9-CM codes suggestive of ILI/ARTI in their health records. During the same period, a total of 253 respiratory samples were collected from ICU patients with ILI/ARTI. Of these, 233 patients (92.1%) were retrospectively found to match the inclusion criteria and were included in the final study group. Therefore, we estimate to have included in the analysis about 40% (n ¼ 233/622) of all Sicilian hospitalized critically ill patients showing an ILI/ARTI presentation. Age ranged between 1 day and 88 years (median 52.9 years, IQR ¼ 36.6 years). Patients with laboratory-confirmed viral aetiology were significantly younger than negative subjects (46.0 years vs. 58.3 years; p < 0.01), but with no significant age-difference between groups with single and multiple infections (44.6 years vs. 49.4 years; p ¼ 0.59, respectively). Although non-pediatric subjects covered more than 80% of all ILI/ARTI cases in Sicily during the study period, higher positive rates of infection were observed among younger individuals (63.4%), and the proportion of positive subjects significantly decreased with age ( p < 0.01). Length of hospital stay differed neither between negative and positive patients ( p ¼ 0.79) nor between subjects showing single or co-infections ( p ¼ 0.96). Pneumonia was the prevalent adverse outcome (n ¼ 162/ 233; 69.5%), followed by respiratory failure (n ¼ 105/233; 45.1%), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n ¼ 59/233; 25.3%). Sepsis and/or septic shock was documented in clinical records of 12/233 (5.2%) ICU-patients. Eighty-four patients with ILI/ARTI presentation deceased and no difference was observed in relation to the aetiology ( p ¼ 0.56; 44 vs. 40 deaths among negative and positive subjects, respectively). In general, ILI/ARTI cases were reported throughout the study period, with seasonal influenza confirmed infections mainly detected during the period OctobereMarch, while other different viral aetiologies were also found from August to September and from April to May (for more details see Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Supplementary Fig. 2 depicts the proportions of laboratory-confirmed samples, according the aforementioned three different age-groups and microorganisms. Study population with laboratory-confirmed positivity was stratified according to a single or a multiple detection ( Table  2 ). About half of all subjects with mono-infections (n ¼ 41/ 79; 51.9%) were adults. In general, influenza viruses were the most common aetiologic agents (n ¼ 44/79; 55.7%), and influenza A(H 1 N 1 )pdm09 prevailed, especially among adults (n ¼ 32/44; 72.7%). Human parainfluenza viruses and enteroviruses had similar detection frequencies (13.3% and 11.4%, respectively), six out of 79 patients (7.6%) were infected with human respiratory syncytial viruses, while in four patients (5.1%) human coronaviruses (n ¼ 2, hCoV-NL63; n ¼ 1, hCoV-HKU1; and n ¼ 1, hCoV-OC43) were found. Finally, 2/79 subjects (2.5%) were positive for human rhinovirus, as well as for human bocavirus type 1; only one patient (1.3%) was positive for human KI polyomavirus. AdV, hPeV and WUPyV were not detected at all. Most of ICU-patients with laboratory-confirmed polymicrobial aetiology (n ¼ 20/26; 76.9%) were adults and elderly (Table 2b) .
