Egr-1 binds at least two different sites within the ORF50P Egr-1 is said to bind a GC-rich DNA template (such as GCGC(G/T)GGGCG, GCGGGGGCG, and CGCCCATGC) on the promoter and initiate gene transcription [15, 16] . Eight possible GC-rich Egr-1 binding sequences have been identified by us in the promoter region of KSHV ORF50. In order to determine the sites where Egr-1 bound ORF50P, EMSA experiments were performed using 8 different DIG-labeled probes, referring to identified locations on ORF50P, (Table 1) and Egr-1 in vitro transcribed and translated (IVT) proteins. IVT of egr-1/ pcDNA3.1(+) construct yielded a protein of roughly 78 kda (data not shown) [6] . Of all the probes tested, IVT-synthesized Egr-1 proteins were able to bind and form separate protein:DNA complexes with the ORF50P3 and ORF50P8 probes, respectively; displaying distinct band shifts when compared to controls using the probes alone ( Fig. 1A ; lanes 6 and 16). It is important to note that the sequence for ORF50P3 is the same for the probe used in earlier study [6] . Band shifts were not observed when ORF50P probes were incubated with IVT-synthesized KSHV glycoprotein L (gL) (data not shown). Additionally, experiments using the ORF50PNP probe (does not contain the GC-rich binding domain) did not form a complex with Egr-1 protein, thus confirming the specificity of Egr-1 binding (Fig. 1A, lane 18) . Finally, competition experiments using unlabeled ORF50P probes reduced band shifts by preventing Egr-1 binding to DIG-labeled probes (data not shown). A second set of EMSA studies were conducted using ORF50P probes carrying mutations (ORF50P3m and ORF50P8m; Table 1 ) in the putative Egr-1 binding region to further confirm the binding ability of Egr-1 proteins. Briefly, ORF50P3 and ORF50P8 were mutated to carry the 5 bp ATATA sequence in the GC-rich binding domain and then incubated in binding buffer alone or with IVT-synthesized Egr-1. Samples consisting of wildtype (wt) or mutated probes alone did not display a shift in the respective ORF50P3 and ORF50P8 probes ( Fig. 1B ; lanes 1, 3, 5. and 7). Following incubation of wt probes with Egr-1, complexes were formed producing separate band shifts (Fig. 1B , lane 2 and 6). Interestingly, Egr-1 did not bind ORF50P3m or ORF50P8m probes that displayed mutations in the Egr-1 binding domain, thus confirming the necessity for the consensus GC-rich binding domain mediating Egr-1/ORF50P interactions (Fig. 1B, lanes 4  and 8) . Finally, gel shift assays were performed using the nuclear extract from KSHV-infected cells to verify the ability of Egr-1 to bind ORF50P3 and ORF50P8. As expected, there was no hindrance in the migration of ORF50P probes without the addition of cell lysate ( Fig. 1C; lanes 1 and 5) . However, the presence of the lysate in the samples resulted in the formation of protein:DNA complexes indicated by a band shift (Fig. 1C , lanes 2 and 6). Egr-1 binding to ORF50P was confirmed by incubating lysates with specific Abs and performing a supershift. Samples that were incubated with nonspecific IgG Abs displayed band shifts that were similar to samples containing only Egr-1 and the respective probes (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 7) . Alternatively, a supershift occurred exhibiting a discrete band when nuclear lysates were pre-treated with Egr-1 specific Abs (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 8). Taken together, these experiments provide support for the ability of Egr-1 to specifically bind to two separate locations on KSHV ORF50P. IVT-synthesized Egr-1 binds to ORF50P probes. EMSA studies were performed using IVT-synthesized Egr-1 products and DIGlabeled ORF50P probes (see Table 1 ). (B) Mutations in the putative Egr-1 binding domain inhibit Egr-1 binding. EMSA experiments were performed using wt ORF50P3 and ORF50P8 probes as well as corresponding probes displaying mutations in the suspected Egr-1 binding domain (ORF50P3m and ORF50P8m). (C) Nuclear lysates from KSHV-infected cells formed a complex with ORF50P probes. BCBL-1 cells were synchronized in S phase of cell cycle according to earlier protocols [28] , treated with 20 ng/ml TPA for 8 h, and lysed. Nuclear extracts containing Egr-1 proteins were used to perform EMSA studies using ORF50P3 and ORF50P8 probes. Specific Egr-1 binding was confirmed by performing supershifts using specific antibodies to Egr-1 (lanes 4 and 8) or nonspecific IgGs (lanes 3 and 7).
