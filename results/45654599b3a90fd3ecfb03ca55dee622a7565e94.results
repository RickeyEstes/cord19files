We will describe the perspectives of those involved in the bed allocation decisions, showing their perceptions of the lines of communication, its usual methods and content. When communicating with end-users, Critical Care Physicians discussed reasons for being unable to agree to a request for an ICU bed. They included program-based prioritization, (e.g. surgical oncology would have precedence over surgical services not identified as high priority), lack of capacity, and anticipated or approaching lack of capacity. Some physicians communicated reasons for denying a bed directly to end-users, while others noted that they might communicate indirectly via house staff or by leaving a message with the receptionist at the operating room desk for the surgeon. between the critical care physician and end-users resulted in unofficial "parallel tracks" of allocation decision-making (see below and Fig. 1 ). The lack of direct communication between the critical care physician and end-users could result in each being unaware of the other's bed allocation decisions and rationales.
