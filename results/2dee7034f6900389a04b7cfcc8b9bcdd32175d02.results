Out of the 46 tested samples, 45 were negative for MERS-CoV and one sample was found MERS-CoV positive. The positive result was validated by the Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU) laboratory, located in Cairo-Egypt, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO). All other results were validated with a CAP accredited referral laboratory in Germany and the concordance rate was 100%. Fig. 1 represents a graph of the amplification of the MERS-CoV RNA and the endogenous ACTB in the MERS-CoV positive sample. Positive and negative controls were used and signal detection was done on the FAM channel. The graph in Fig. 2 represents the detection of the internal RNA extraction control (IEC) in the fluorescence channel VIC, for the same positive sample. IEC was only added to the sample during extraction and not to the positive or negative controls. An acceptable Ct value of the IEC ranges between 28 and 34.
