Only slight differences were noted between treatment and control liver enzyme and hemogram values. Alkaline phosphatase levels were somewhat lower (p < 0.05) in the FOX group (154.5 f 18.8 IU/L) (mean -t Standard deviation), than in the COX group (200.6 + 35.7 IU/L) at 43 days post-treatment and were similarly lower (102.4 + 13.3 IU/L) than CRA (140.6 f 28.5 IU/L), or COX (144.6 * 16.0 IU/L) groups at 92 days post-treatment. A difference (p < 0.05) in SGOT levels between CR4 (96.1 + 22.3 IU/L) and FOX (62.0 + 13.5 IU/L) groups was seen at 43 days post-treatment. There were no differences between treatment and control SGPT values. White blood cell counts for FRA and FOX (16.1-17.0 X 103/mm3 at 43 days and 14.6-16.7 X 103/mm3 at 92 days post-treatment) were slightly elevated (p < 0.05) over CRA and COX values (11.1 X 103/mm3 for controls at 43 days and 10.2-12.0 X 103/mm3 at 92 days post-treatment). The reason for this elevation is unknown, but counts resolved with no observable effects on the animals. Serology results showed only low level mycoplasma titers in some animals from both treatment and control groups. PFC analysis revealed marked FTPA and FDC accumulation in the spleen and liver of FRA and FOX animals at 24 days post-treatment (Table 1 ). PFC accumulation was most pronounced in the spleen, with 146.41 f 30.79 mg/gm of FTPA and 152.40 If: 33.01 mg/gm of FDC recovered from FOX animals and similar PFC amounts recovered from FRA animals at 24 days post-treatment. Less than 1.5 mg/gm of total PFC's was recovered from lung tissues. The PFC content of tissues decreased over time, with FDC clearing more rapidly than FTPA in all organs. At the end of the study, measurable FDC (0.15 mg/gm) remained only in spleen. FIPA was recovered from both spleen (61.63-94.76 mg/gm) and liver (4.55-4.75 mg/gm) at 183 days post-treatment. However, both FDC and FTPA clearance was essentially complete from lung tissues by six months post-treatment. Fluosol accumulation in the cell, were observed in the RES of the spleen and liver in Fluosol treated animals. In the spleen, there was marked accumulation of foamy macrophages throughout the red pulp at 24 days posttreatment (Fig. 1) ; accumulation was also observed in the lymphoid germinal follicles of some samples. These changes remained prominent at 43 days post-treatment, but by 183 days, there remained only mild to moderate focal accumulation of foamy macrophage in the red pulp and no accumulation in the germinal centers (Fig. 2) . At 24 days post-treatment, the livers of animals in both treatment groups contained moderate numbers of large foamy Kupffer cells and enlarged foamy hepatocytes (Fig.  3 ) reflecting the accumulation of Fluosoi in these cells. These cells decreased in number gradually until only scattered foamy cells were observed by 183 days post-treatment (Fig. 4) . Scattered foamy macrophages were observed in the alveoli and interstitium of lung tissues from treatment animals at 24 days, but by 183 days post-treatment, only occasional foamy cells were observed. Control tissue samples were histologically normal, except for evidence of mycoplasmosis observed in the lungs of some control and treatment animals. Light microscopic examination revealed no tissue damage although, foamy macrophages, indicative of Whole body weights increased and relative organ weights decreased over time for all groups, reflecting the growth of the animals. There were no differences in whole body weights between FRA animals and control animals during the study. However, in the FOX group, weight gain was depressed (p < 0.05) both at 24 days (0.9 times control) and 92 days (0.8 times control) post-treatment, but had returned to control levels by the termination of the study. The etiology of this weight change was not examined. As expected, both liver and spleen weights were initially elevated after Fluosol treatment (Table 2) . Animals receiving Fluosol had relative liver weights about 1.6 and 1.7 times the relative weights of their corresponding controls at 24 days post-treatment (p < 0.05). In the spleen, increases of 2.0 and 2.1 times over control weights were observed for the FRA and FOX groups, respectively (p < 0.05). These differences resolved gradually over time and were almost completely normalized at 183 days posttreatment. There were no differences in organ weights, attributable to the inspiration of high oxygen, in either control or treatment groups. No differences in lung weights were observed between treatment and control groups.
