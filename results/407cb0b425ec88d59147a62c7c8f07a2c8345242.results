Of the 160 participants who were randomized and assigned to the CDSMP or Tai-Chi groups, 12 (7.5%) dropped out of the study. Of these, four did not complete the CDSMP program, resulting in a 5% drop-out rate. Eight participants dropped out of the Tai-Chi group, resulting in a 10% drop-out rate. An analysis of their gender, age, and medical history did not reveal obvious differences between those who completed the interventions and those who did not. Thus, the biases in the results attributable to the drop-out rates were deemed insignificant. Of those who completed the programs and all assessments (N = 148), 111 (75%) were female and 37 (25%) were male. More than half (58%) of the participants were between 45 and 55 years old. About half (54.1%) had received a secondary education (equivalent to grade 6 or above) or higher. A majority of participants (72%) were married. About half (48.8%) had a family income lower than the median family income in Hong Kong. Most participants (90.7%) were not members of self-help or mutual-help organizations. No significant differences were found in age (t = 1.77, P = .77), education level (t = .37, P = .71), gender (x 2 = .25, P = .87), and history of disease (t = 1.53, P = .05) between participants in the CDSMP group and those in the Tai-Chi group.
