Based on the initial BLASTN and BLASTX analysis of the next generation sequencing (NGS) reads, 3 viruses of interest were identified and became the focus for further analysis: canine astrovirus and canine parvovirus from the pooled faecal sample and canine papillomavirus from the pooled and individual saliva samples. A few reads of canine astrovirus were also obtained from each of the individual saliva samples. However, significantly more reads were obtained from the pooled faecal sample and the near complete genome was able to be constructed from this sample alone. Molecular and phylogenetic characterization of canine astrovirus. The near full-length sequence of a canine astrovirus was obtained from the pooled canine faecal sample DF-1-2-AUS-2017. The obtained sequence DF-BC15-CAV-AUS-2017 was 6612 nucleotides long and was derived from reads mapped to the canine astrovirus reference sequence KP404149-CAV-Gillingham-UK-2012 15 with a coverage depth ranging from 22 to 6375 and a mapping quality threshold of 32 and above. The assembled genome included 39 nucleotides of the 5′ untranslated region (UTR), missing only 6 nucleotides from the very 5′ end, a 2670 nucleotides long open reading frame 1a (ORF1a), a 1530 nucleotides long ORF1b, a 2505 nucleotides long ORF2, an 82 nucleotides long 3′UTR and a 17 nucleotides long polyA-tail. For phylogenetic analysis of our near full-length canine astrovirus sequence, we initially selected the seven most closely related near full-length canine astrovirus sequences from dogs and one mamastrovirus sequence from a fox available in the NCBI Genbank summarized in Table S1 . KY765684-CTAV-BRA-2015 16 from a fox did not fall in any cluster with the astroviruses from domestic dogs and was therefore not included in the phylogenetic analyses shown. The generated maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree ( KX599351-CAV-115-HUN-2012 17 appeared to fall somewhat in between these two clusters (Fig. 1) . The SimPlot analysis (Fig. 2 ) did largely agreed with the clustering of sequences mentioned above. The majority of differences between sequences were located in the ORF2 (capsid) region downstream of nucleotide 4009 and may have involved recombination or possibly evolution/selection of different capsid genotypes/serotypes. Table S1 because some of the HUN-2012 sequences had what appear to be insertions/deletions, or possibly sequencing artefacts that would make phylogenetic inference unreliable. Consequently, for the ORF1a we only compared our sequence DF-BC15-CAV-ORF1a-AUS-2017 to five other related canine astrovirus sequences. This analysis suggested that in this part of the genome our Table S2 ).
