Ninety-eight patients with radiographically documented pneumonia were included in the data analysis. The male/ female ratio was 1.3:1, and 59 (61%) of the patients enrolled were younger than 2 years of age ( Fig. 1) . Although patients were enrolled in the study in all months of the year, the majority were enrolled in the winter and early spring. In addition to the urine and viral culture specimens collected for all patients, 75 (77%) patients had a blood culture done and 50 (51%) had paired sera available for analysis, Etiologic diagnoses. Thirty-eight (39%) of the 98 patients had a documented viral infection (Table) . Twenty-five (66%) of the 38 infections were diagnosed by virus isolation or antigen detection only, five (13%) by serologic study only, and eight (21%) by both serologic study and virus isolation or antigen detection. Twenty-seven (71%) of the 38 patients with viral infection were infected with RSV. Two patients with RSV infection had a concurrent infection with another virus, one with influenza B and one with coronavirus,229E. Bacterial infection was detected in 19 (19%) of the 98 patients (Table) . Seventeen patients had a pneumococcal infection, and two were infected with HIB. The diagnosis of bacterial infection was made by detection of bacterial antigenuria in 17 patients. Three patients had pneumococcal bacteremia, including two patients who did not have detectable antigenuria. No etiologic diagnosis was established in 51 (52%) of the 98 patients. Ten (53%) of the 19 patients with bacterial pneumonia Clinical and laboratory findings. The patients with a viral infection only were compared with those patients with a bacterial infection either alone or combined with viral infection, to determine whether clinical, laboratory, or x-ray finding would reliably detect patients with bacterial infection. The patients with viral pneumonia had a mean age of 2.1 years compared with 3.1 years in patients with bacterial pneumonia. The mean duration of illness before seeking medical care was 3.8 days in both the viral and bacterial infection groups. No difference was found in the proportion of patients in each group who reported ill family members, rhinorrhea, cough, myalgia, headache, respiratory distress, anorexia, abdominal pain, or vomiting. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the proportion of patients in each group who had high fever (temperature >__ 40 ~ C), decreased air exchange, rales, or associated otitis media on physical examination. The only difference noted between the two groups was the incidence of wheezing, which was present either by history or on physical examination in 12 (43%) of the 28 patients with viral infection alone, compared with three (16%) of the 19 patients with bacterial infection (P = 0.05). Two of the three patients with bacterial pneumonia associated with wheezing had a concurrent viral infection. Thus no histor- increased percentage of total neutrophils (>75%) or bands (>15%) was not different in the two groups. Serum was available for determination of CRP concentration for 97 (99%) of the patients. The mean + SD CRP concentration in the patients with viral infection was 2.5 _+ 1.9 mg/dL, compared with 5.7 + 6.1 mg/dL in patients with bacterial infection (Fig. 3) . Fifteen (56%) of -27 patients with viral infection had a positive CRP (>1.5 mg/dL), compared with 12 (63%) of 19 patients with bacteria! infection. The differences in the mean CRP concentration and in the proportion of patients with a positive CRP were not statistically Significant.
