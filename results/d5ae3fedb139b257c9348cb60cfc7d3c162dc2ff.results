Ten adult patients were identified with a physician discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis. Of these, three had a definitive diagnosis of M pneumoniae-associated bronchiolitis. All three were previously healthy adults who presented with acute small airways disease due to M pneumoniae but without the radiographic features of lobar or patchy alveolar infiltrates that are characteristic of M pneumoniae pneumonia. One patient had BOOP and two had an acute inflammatory bronchiolitis. All had significant restrictive lung disease and gas exchange abnormalities. Two were treated with corticosteroids and had a favorable response. Case Report Case 1 A previously healthy nonsmoking 39-year-old man complained of 10 days of progressive dyspnea and a productive cough. He also reported nausea, one episode of vomiting, and watery diarrhea for 3 days. On examination, his temperature was 37.7°C, pulse rate was 87 beats/min, BP was 120/70 mm Hg, and respiratory rate was 22 breaths/min. Physical examination was notable for moderate respiratory distress and bilateral crackles. The chest radiograph demonstrated a fine nodular interstitial pattern (Fig 1) . A room air arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.43, Pco 2 of 36 mm Hg, Po 2 of 41 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 78%. The peripheral WBC count was 9.4 ϫ 10 9 /L, with 61% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, and 12% monocytes. Treatment with IV erythromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was initiated. Sputum culture revealed mixed flora. Blood cultures were negative. On hospital day 3, due to the lack of improvement, he underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy of the left lower lobe and lingula. This revealed extensive proliferative (exudative) bronchiolitis with organizing pneumonia consistent with BOOP (Fig 2) . Microbiological staining and cultures of the tissue were negative. The acute serum cold agglutinin titer was 1:512 and the M pneumoniae IgG (complement fixation) was 1:64. The IgM antibody for M pneumoniae was 1:2,560. Convalescence titers for cold agglutinin and IgM were negative. A regimen of IV methylprednisolone was started, 250 mg every 6 h, and the regimen of erythromycin was continued. The patient was discharged from the hospital on hospital day 11 to complete a 3-week course of erythromycin, 500 mg four times daily, and prednisone, 80 mg once daily. Pulmonary function at hospital discharge revealed an FEV 1 of 2.03 L (54%), FVC of 2.74 L (59%), FEV 1 /FVC of 74%, thoracic gas volume of 2.26 L (66%), residual volume of 1.05 L (66%), and total lung capacity of 3.57 L (56%), consistent with severe restrictive lung disease. After 1 month, a chest radiograph revealed only minimal linear scarring at the left lung base. At 5 months, the FEV 1 improved to 2.67 L (69%), FVC to 3.52 L (68%), and FEV 1 /FVC was 76%. Prednisone dosage was tapered over 9 months, guided by improvement in the patient's symptoms and reduction of oxygen requirements.
