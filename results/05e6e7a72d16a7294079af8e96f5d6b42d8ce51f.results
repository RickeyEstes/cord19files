Development and optimization of the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay. At the commencement of this study, we used a real-time turbidimeter enabling observation of primer kinetics to determine the optimal primer sequences, primer concentrations, incubation temperature, as well as incubation time of the multiplex RT-LAMP reaction. The results showed that the optimal multiplex RT-LAMP reaction was obtained with primer sequences shown in Table 1 and the primer concentrations described in Materials and Methods. At 63 °C, the best amplification efficiency was observed for all the three HA subtypes (A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1), and thus 63 °C was considered to be optimal temperature for the multiplex RT-LAMP reaction (data not shown). According to the amplification curves obtained by real-time turbidimeter, 50 min was selected as the optimal incubation time. In mRT-LAMP-IRNH, the multiplex RT-LAMP amplicons were further identified by cascade invasive reaction and nanoparticle hybridization in separate target-specific detection tubes. A schematic of the principles of cascade invasive reaction and gold nanoparticle hybridization is shown in Fig. 1 . In the positive reaction, the cleaved hairpin probe cannot trigger the aggregation of AuNPs, leading to a red color of the reaction. Conversely, in the negative reaction, the intact hairpin probe leads to the aggregation of AuNPs, and then the reaction mixture becomes colorless (Fig. 1) . Analytical sensitivity of the mRT-LAMP-IRNH. The analytical sensitivity of the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay was determined by testing ten-fold serial dilutions of viral RNA transcripts (ranging from 10 4 to10 0 RNA copies) on two separate days. After 50 min of amplification, diluted RT-LAMP products were added into the invasive reaction mixture to perform cascade invasive reactions for each target, then the AuNPs were added for hybridization. The detection limits for all the three HA genes (A/H5, A/H7 and 2009A/H1) were 10 1 copies of synthetic RNA by presenting red color in the reaction tubes as shown in Fig. 2a -c. Identical results were obtained on both days indicating that the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay was both robust and reproducible. To further evaluate the sensitivity of cascade invasive reaction and nanoparticle hybridization (IRNH) for LAMP product detection, the multiplex RT-LAMP amplifications were also monitored by a real-time turbidimeter. As shown in Fig. 2d -f, the detection limits for A/H7 and 2009A/H1 were both 10 1 copies of synthetic RNA, which were equivalent to their detection limits obtained by mRT-LAMP-IRNH. However, the detection limit for A/H5 was 10 2 copies of synthetic RNA, which was an order of magnitude lower than that obtained by mRT-LAMP-IRNH, indicating the sensitivity of cascade invasive reaction coupled with nanoparticle hybridization was higher than real-time turbidity detection for RT-LAMP product analysis. Analytical specificity of the mRT-LAMP-IRNH. To assess the potential for the mRT-LAMP-IRNH assay to cross-react with other genetically or clinically related viruses which could cause similar symptoms, a specificity test was conducted using viral RNA extracts from various control viruses. As shown in Fig
