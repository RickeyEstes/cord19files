a2NTD binds and enters monocytes in a dose-and temperature-dependent manner. The binding of a2NTD was investigated in PBMCs using a fluorescently labeled variant of the peptide. a2NTD bound monocytes in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 1A) . At the highest concentrations of a2NTD, approximately 90% of monocytes were found to interact with a2NTD ( Fig. 1B) . Lymphocytes were also examined, exhibiting minimal binding of a2NTD, though at the highest concentration of a2NTD tested approximately 30% of lymphocytes were positive (Fig. 1B) . Binding specificity was tested in a competition assay. Unlabeled a2NTD was able to compete out the binding of fluorescent a2NTD in both monocytes ( Fig. 1C and D) and lymphocytes (Fig. 1D) . Many cellular functions including receptor-mediated internalization are inhibited at 4°C, implying that these conditions Recently, we have demonstrated a novel role for the a2 isoform of V-ATPase (a2V) in tumor progression. Thus, the N-terminal region of a2V expressed at the plasma membrane of human tumor cells can be cleaved, resulting in the release of a peptide that activates immune cells. 16 When incubated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), this peptide (a2NTD) causes monocytes to produce IL-1β. 17, 18 A more detailed investigation revealed that a2NTD induces primary monocytes to develop an IL-12 low IL-23 low IL-10 high M2-like phenotype. 16 Thus, a2NTD was the first cytokine-like factor described to induce the alternative activation pathway in macrophages. In the present study, we examined the interaction of a2NTD with human monocytes. In particular, we determined binding specificity, which particular monocyte subset is targeted, the mode of cellular entry and the receptors involved. a2NTD bound to monocytes and binding could be competed out with unlabeled peptide. a2NTD was internalized by monocytes and THP-1 cells, though the latter demonstrated slower uptake (A and B) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pBMcs) fixed with paraformaldehyde were incubated with 0.1-10 μg/mL a2NTD conjugated to alexa Fluor 488 (a2NTD-aF488). cell populations were gated based on forward/side scatter. Representative histograms showing a2NTD-aF488 binding in monocytes are presented in (A); the black peak refers to unstained cells. In (B), the percentage of a2NTD binding to monocytes and lymphocytes is shown (means ± seM, n = 4). (C and D) pBMcs fixed with paraformaldehyde were incubated with 0.1-10 μg/mL unconjugated a2NTD and then with 2 μg/mL a2NTD-aF488. a representative histogram showing competitive inhibition of a2NTD binding to monocytes is reported in (C); the black histogram refers to unstained cells. In (D), the percentages of monocytes and lymphocytes positive for a2NTD binding after competitive assay are shown. Values were normalized to cells that did not receive unlabeled a2NTD. (means ± seM, n = 4). (E) pBMcs were incubated with a2NTD-aF488 for indicated time at 4°c and 37°c. some of the samples were then treated with 0.1% trypsin-eDTa (dashed lines) for 5 min to remove surface bound a2NTD. cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry, upon gating on cD14 + events. (means ± seM, n = 8). The percentage of positive monocytes (black lines) or lymphocytes (gray lines) after a2NTD-aF488 incubation is reported. were pre-incubated at 4°c or 37°c for 30 min, followed by the addition of 10 μg/mL a2NTD conjugated to alexa Fluor 488 (a2NTD-aF488) for 1 h and staining with an anti-cD14 pe-Texas red antibody for 30 min. some of the samples were treated with 0.1% trypsin after a2NTD-aF488 incubation to remove surface bound a2NTD. cells were then placed on slides using a cytospin and imaged using a Nikon fluorescent microscope. Representative images from three independent experiments are shown: pBMcs incubated at 4°c, followed (A) or not (B) by trypsin treatment; pBMc incubated at 37°c, followed (C) or not (D) by trypsin treatment. maintained at 4°C displayed reduced surface fluorescence (Fig. 2B) . In comparison, trypsin-treated cells cultured at 37°C exhibited a reduced surface staining but maintained the punctuate intracellular staining (Fig. 2D) . To eliminate non-specific phagocytosis as a mechanism of cellular uptake, neutrophils were separately examined. Neutrophils demonstrated much less endocytosis of a2NTD than monocytes, but slightly more than lymphocytes (Fig. S1) . Finally, the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was also examined. While the uptake trend is similar in THP-1 cells and monocytes, the kinetics are much slower for the former. Indeed, after 2h at 37°C, only 17% of THP-1 cells were positive as compared with almost 75% of monocytes ( Fig. 1E and Fig. S2 ). Endocytosis of a2NTD is energy-dependent and requires structural proteins. In general, filamentous actin is required for receptor-mediated endocytosis. 20 The requirement for microtubules depends on the specific receptor that is involved. For example, the inhibition of microtubules blocks complement receptor-mediated, but not Fc receptor-mediated, particle internalization. 21, 22 Moreover, the addition of microtubule-depolymerizing agents such as nocodazole slows down adsorptive and fluid-phase endocytosis. 23, 24 In order to determine if actin or microtubules are important for a2NTD internalization, PBMCs were cultured with a2NTD in presence of cytochalasin D (CytoD), to inhibit F-actin filaments, and colchicines, to inhibit microtubules. Monocytes demonstrated a greater uptake of a2NTD as compared with a negative control peptide. The pretreatment of PBMCs with inhibitors of actin and microtubules resulted in decreased fluorescence, demonstrating an inhibition of a2NTD uptake (Fig. 3A) . Both inhibitors significantly reduced a2NTD entry by approximately 80% as compared with control cells ( Fig. 3B and C) . Actin and tubulin monomers are in the active state for polymerization when bound to ATP and GTP respectively. The pretreatment of PBMCs with metabolic inhibitors such as sodium azide and 2-deoxyglucose (that deplete the intracellular ATP pool) or mycophenolic acid (that depletes the pool of GTP) also decreased the uptake of a2NTD (Fig. 3D) . Uptake of a2NTD by monocyte subsets. To determine if different monocyte subsets preferentially internalize a2NTD, monocytes were stained for the surface markers CD14 and CD16 after incubation with a2NTD. CD14 ++ CD16 − cells constitute the majority of all monocytes, while CD14 ++ CD16 + and CD14 + CD16 ++ represent two minor subpopulations. 25 We were able to retrieve these three populations by flow cytometry ( Table 1) . Of note, nearly 100% of CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes were positive for a2NTD endocytosis, as compared are ideal for studying binding in the absence of internalization. Conversely, both binding and internalization can occur at 37°C. 19 The temperature-dependent binding of fluorescent a2NTD to PBMC was determined at 4°C and 37°C, to confirm an internalization mechanism. There were more a2NTDpositive monocytes, as assessed by flow cytometry, at 37°C (75%) than at 4°C (15%) (Fig. 1E) . Cells were then treated with trypsin to remove any a2NTD bound to the cell surface. Thus, while trypsin reduced the number of a2NTD-positive cells in both temperature conditions, an increased number of fluorescent cells persisted at 37°C. Lymphocytes, which showed minimal binding to a2NTD, also exhibited minimal peptide uptake (Fig. 1E) . Endocytosis was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. After incubation with fluorescent a2NTD, monocytes were examined by fluorescence microscopy, showing a2NTD-dependent surface staining at 4°C ( Fig. 2A) and a more intense and intracellular punctate staining at 37°C (Fig. 2C) . Similar to what was observed with flow cytometry, trypsin-treated monocytes incubated with a control peptide, a2NTD conjugated to alexa Fluor 488 (a2NTD-aF488) alone, or a2NTD-aF488 after the indicated inhibitors. cell populations were analyzed by flow cytometry, upon gating on cD14 + event. (B and C) pBMcs were pre-treated with actin and microtubule inhibitors for 1 h followed by the exposure to 10 μg/mL a2NTD-aF488 for 1 h. Representative histograms for each inhibitor are shown in (B). Dashed line depicts cells incubated with a2NTD-aF488 alone, while solid lines refer to cells exposed to inhibitors plus a2NTD. (C) Bar graph values in c illustrate the percentage of a2NTD-positive cells after inhibitor treatment. (means ± seM, n = 5, **p < 0.001, compared with a2NTD alone). (D) pBMcs were cultured in glucose-free media with or without NaN 3 and 2-deoxyglucose (to deplete aTp) or mycophenolic acid (to deplete GTp) for 2 h at 37°c, followed by the administration of a2NTD-aF488 for 1 h. columns report mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values (means ± seM, n = 5, *p < 0.05, compared with a2NTD alone). To determine if a2NTD enhances macropinocytosis, PBMCs were incubated with a fluid-phase macropinocytosis marker, 10 kDa neutral dextran, in combination with increasing concentrations of a2NTD. Consistent with the observation of others, 27 dextran was efficiently taken up by macropinocytosis at 37°C. Of note, a2NTD induced a significant dose-dependent increase in the uptake of fluid-phase dextran (Fig. 5D) . DMA pre-treatment significantly reduced dextran internalization as triggered by a2NTD. As THP-1 cells exhibited slower kinetics of a2NTD uptake, we investigated whether THP-1 cells bear a defective macropinocytosis machinery. When THP-1 cells were incubated with fluorescence 10 kDa dextran, cell fluorescence at 37°C with approximately 45% of CD14 ++ CD16 − monocytes. The CD14 + CD16 ++ population showed a a2NTD uptake profile similar to that of CD14 ++ CD16 − cells (Fig. 4A) . a2NTD stimulates IL-1α and IL-1β production. It has previously been shown that a2NTD stimulates monocytes to produce the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β. 17, 18 We examined whether a particular subset of monocytes is responsible for the production of inflammatory cytokines following a2NTD stimulation. To this aim, monocytes were incubated with a2NTD and then stained for surface CD14 and CD16 expression, followed by staining for the intracellular cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β and TNF-α. Only CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes showed a statistically significant increase in IL-1α, production when compared with cells maintained in control conditions (Fig. 4B) . Both CD14 ++ CD16 − and CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes produced significantly higher amounts of IL-1β (Fig. 4C) . There was no significant difference in the production of TNFα by cells treated with a2NTD and control cells (Fig. 4D) . Of note, the CD14 ++ CD16 + subpopulation invariably produced higher amounts of IL-1α, IL-1β and TNFα than the other two subpopulations. In addition, the intracellular levels of IL-1α and IL-1β were greater than those of TNFα. This finding is consistent with our previous data demonstrating that monocytes produce more IL-1 than TNF. 16 LPS contamination of the recombinant peptide is always a concern when investigating inflammatory cytokines. A multiexperimental approach was used to investigate the presence of LPS contamination, including the Limulus assay and polymyxin B neutralization tests. The results (which have previously been published) demonstrated negligible levels of LPS and that cytokine secretion could not be inhibited by pre-treatment with polymyxin B. 16 Endocytosis of a2NTD occurs via macropinocytosis. To study the mechanism by which a2NTD is internalized, we examined three common pathways of cellular entry: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. 26 To rhis aim, PBMCs were pre-treated with distinct compounds that inhibit each of these pathways, followed by incubation with a2NTD. Chloropromazine (CPZ) and dynasore were used to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Neither of these inhibitors had an effect on a2NTD uptake (Fig. 5A) . Filipin and nystatin were used to inhibit caveolin-mediated endocytosis. Similar to the inhibitors of clathrinmediated endocytosis, filipin and nystatin did not affect a2NTD entry (Fig. 5B) . Rottlerin and dimethylamiloride (DMA) were used to inhibit macropinocytosis. In contrast to the other inhibitors, both DMA and rottlerin significantly inhibited the uptake of a2NTD. In particular, rottlerin inhibited a2NTD uptake by 63% and DMA by 83% (Fig. 5C) . unknown. There is evidence suggesting that scavenger receptors utilize macropinocytosis as one mode of cellular entry. 29, 30 Scavenger receptors recognize macromolecules with negative charges 31 as well as lipoproteins. 32 Previous findings indicate that a2NTD is associated with lipids 33 and the amino acid sequence of a2NTD carries a net negative change. We therefore examined whether scavenger receptors play a part in the endocytosis of a2NTD. Polyinosinic acid (polyI), a polyanionic nucleotide, is a commonly used scavenger receptor ligand. PBMCs were pre-treated with polyanionic inhibitors before the addition of a2NTD and polyI significantly reduced a2NTD uptake by 80%, as compared with untreated samples (Fig. 6A) . Polyadenylic acid and polycytidylic acid, structural homologs of polyI, did not inhibit a2NTD uptake. Endocytosis is not required for cytokine production by a2NTD. We have previously shown a2NTD to upregulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We wanted then to determine if the internalization of a2NTD is required for cytokine production or if a2NTD binding is sufficient. After preincubation with trafficking inhibitors and a2NTD stimulation, monocytes were stained for intracellular IL-1β. None of the inhibitors had a statistically significant effect on IL-1β production (Fig. 6B) . This indicates that the binding of a2NTD to monocytes is sufficient to stimulate a pro-inflammatory secretory response.
