The study interval from 1999 to 2007 included 19,732 patients, of whom 10,281 (52%) were male. The average age was 63.3 (standard deviation [SD] ¼ 13.2; range, 18-94) years. The average Charlson comorbidity index was 2.26 (SD ¼ 1.30). The average Charlson comorbidity index increased over the study interval from 1.9 to 2.3. The number of procedures performed per year increased over the study period from 2120 to 2561, as shown in Figure 1 . Preoperatively, 82.8% of patients had a diagnosis of cancer. A decrease in lobectomies in 2003 is thought to be attributable to the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. IHM per year is shown in Figure 2 . The unadjusted analysis revealed a 45% relative risk reduction (95% confidence interval [CI], 21-61; P ¼ .001) in IHM over the study period and a 19% reduction in LOS (95% CI, 12-25; P < .0001). The IHM yearly rate decreased over the study period from a peak of 3.1% in 1999 to 1.95% in 2007. Similarly, LOS yearly rates decreased from 10.4 days (SD ¼ 12.2) in 1999 to 8.9 days (SD ¼ 10.1) in 2007. When we examined the effect of volume on mortality, we found that hospitals performing fewer than 10 lobectomies per year had the highest mortality at 4.8%, whereas those performing more than 100 lobectomies per year had the lowest mortality at 1.8% ( Figure 3 ). The risk-adjusted models for IHM and LOS are shown in Table 1 . Both lower IHM and lower LOS were associated with institutions with higher volumes. After adjusting for age, gender, and Charlson index, there was a 15% relative risk reduction (95% CI, 9-19; P < .0001) for IHM and a 5% relative decrease (95% CI, 3-7; P < .001) in LOS for every 20 additional cases performed per hospital. Table 1 shows that male gender and increasing age are
