One hundred sixty-seven patients with pulmonary ARDS were admitted to the medical ICU. Figure 1 shows flow of patients with ARDS during the period. One hundred and twenty-six patients with pulmonary ARDS (75.4%) underwent multiplex RT-PCR to evaluate the presence of respiratory viral infection, which was identified in 46% (58/126) subjects. Community-acquired respiratory viral infection was identified The mean age of patients was 67.6±13.3 years and the proportion of men was 70.7%. In all cases, the risk factor for pul- Table 2 compares laboratory results and radiologic scores of patients with influenza and those with other viruses. There was a trend toward higher hemoglobin and CRP levels in patients with influenza than in those with other respiratory viruses. No significant difference was observed in other parameters between the two groups. Transthoracic echocardiography was done in 75.9% (44/58) patients on admission of medical intensive care unit to evaluate acute heart failure. The mean ejection fraction was 59.2%±7.76%. Stress induced cardiomyopathy and right ventricular dysfunction were featured in three (6.7%) and five (11.1%) patients, respectively. Table 3 enlists the types of respiratory viruses and corespiratory pathogens in patients with pulmonary ARDS. Influenza A was the most common virus (21 cases) and other respiratory virus infection (10 coronavirus, 5 RSV, 4 parainfluenza virus, 4 rhinovirus, 3 adenovirus, 3 metapneumovirus, and 1 bocavirus) were isolated. Overall 43.1% co-respiratory Table 4 . Patients with influenza virus were treated with neuraminidase inhibitor such as oseltamivir or peramivir but those any antiviral agent was not administered in those with other respiratory viruses. Overall ICU mortality and hospital mortality rates were 51.7% and 55.2%, respectively. There were no significant differences in extubation success, duration of mechanical ventilation, mortality, and length of stay in the ICU and hospital. Multivariate analysis associated with 30-day mortality was performed and has been shown in Table 5 . APACHE II score at admission was associated with ICU mortality. Influenza virus and co-bacterial infection were not associated with ICU mortality. Factors associated with 30-day mortality are shown in Table  5 . In univariate analysis, APACHE II, SOFA and low partial pressure of oxygen/fractioned inspired oxygen ratio were associated with 30-day mortality. APACHE II only was associated with a 30-day mortality in multivariate analysis. Fourteen patients were treated with steroid. The reasons of use of steroid were treatment of concomitant exacerbation of airway disease (n=4, 6.9%), refractory septic shock (n=4, 6.9%), and adjunct treatment of ARDS (n=6, 10.3%), which might not affect mortality in ARDS patients with respiratory viral infection.
