The partial S gene primers flanking the CO-26K equivalent (COE) domain were used to initially screen all samples for PEDV. COE domain is one of several epitope regions with high variations, which may affect viral neutralization and reflect PEDV genetic diversity. In all, 153 out of 769 samples tested positive for the PEDV S gene. Among these, 95 samples yielded sufficient amplification products for further sequence analysis of the partial S, ORF3, and N genes. PEDV-positive samples were derived from animals aged between 3 days and 8 weeks. A 15-week old pig and two lactating sows were the only three exceptions. PEDV was most prevalent in the central part of Thailand where many pig farms are located ( Fig. S2 ; Table S3 ).
