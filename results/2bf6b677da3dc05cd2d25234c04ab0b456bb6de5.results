In brains from control rats there was some staining for MHC class I antigens in the leptomeninges and in the choroid plexus. Also the luminal surface of the endothelial cells in the intracerebral vessels showed immunoreactivity (Figs. 2B and 3B). In the circumventricular organs, i.e. the median eminence, the area postrema, the pineal gland, the subfornical organ and the neurohypophysis, there was a weak diffuse immunoreactivity in the tissue (Fig. 3B ). The rest of the brain parenchyma showed no staining with MHC class I antibodies. At 13 days after injection of the trypanosomes a very strong, diffusely distributed, staining with MHC class I antibodies was seen in the circumventricular organs. In addition, there was marked staining of the neurons in the PVN and SO (Figs. 1 and 2A), whereas none, or only a faint immunoreactivity was discerned in these areas in control rats (Fig. 2B ). The immunoreactivity occurred in the cytoplasm of the nerve cell bodies ( Fig. 2A) . A strong immunoreaction for MHC class I was observed in the circumventricular organs also at 22 and 30 days after inoculation (Fig. 3A) , and from the median eminence the immunoreactivity had extended dorsally into the surrounding neuropil. An intense staining was seen around the subfornical organ. The strong immunoreaction encountered in the two hypothalamic nuclei was evident also at these later time points, and could easily be seen even at the macroscopical level. In addition, there was a marked generalized increase in immunoreactivity in endo- thelial cells both in intracerebral vessels and vessels in the leptomeninges and choroid plexus (Fig.  3A) . Antibodies against MHC class II antigens labelled only a few perivascular cells in the control brains. This was also the case for the circumventricular organs in these brains. After infection, the number of MHC class II-positive perivascular, macrophage-like cells had increased somewhat in the whole brain. The number of positive cells was especially large in the choroid plexus and in the circumventricular organs ( Fig.   2C-E) . The hypothalamic nuclei showed no more increase in the number of labelled macrophage-like cells than the rest of the brain parenchyma. There was no staining of neurons. Lymphocytes of the suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype had appeared in the choroid plexus and the circumventricular organs 13 days after inoculation (Fig. 3C ). They were more numerous after 22 and 30 days, and had now also to a limited extent infiltrated the rest of the brain parenchyma. A few such lymphocytes occurred also in the two hypothalamic nuclei. The W3/25 antibody labelled macrophages similar to the Ox6 antibody, but only an occasional lymphocytic cell.
