Prophylactic efficacy of MERS-CoV RBD-specific human monoclonal antibody, m336. We established a Tg mouse model which is profoundly sensitive and susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, as determined by high viral titers in the lungs, as well as a high rate of morbidity and mortality 34, 38 . Equipped with this small animal model of human MERS-CoV, we investigated the protective efficacy of mAb m336. To accomplish this, each group (n = 6) of mice was treated via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route with two different doses: 0.1 mg and 1 mg per mouse diluted in 100 μ l PBS, and challenged intranasally (i.n.) at 12 h post treatment with 10 4 TCID 50 (i.e., 1,000 LD 50 ) of MERS-CoV in a volume of 60 μ l 38 . Challenged mice were monitored daily for clinical manifestations (weight loss) and mortality. As shown in Fig. 1 , the group treated with 1 mg mAb survived viral infection without showing any clinical symptoms. These mice initially showed either no weight loss or recovered from mild weight loss within three days (Fig. 1A) . On the other hand, the group treated with 0.1 mg mAb showed a gradual weight loss (15-20%) until day 13 just before starting to recover (Fig. 1A ). All surviving mice (one died on day 13 in mice treated with 0.1 mg of m336) continued to recover and appeared well up to 21 dpi when the experiment was terminated (Fig. 1B) . All MERS-CoV-challenged mice pretreated with a high dose (1 mg) of irrelevant mAb m102.4 exhibited profound weight loss (> 15%) and succumbed to infection with 100% mortality by day 8 p.i. (Fig. 1A,B ). Therapeutic efficacy of MERS-CoV RBD-specific human monoclonal antibody, m336. To determine the therapeutic potential of this human monoclonal m336 antibody, groups of mice (N = 6 per group) were challenged (i.n.) with 10 4 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV (i.e., 1,000 LD 50 ) in a volume of 60 μ l and then treated (i.p.) 12 hours later with a single dose of either 1 mg or 0.1 mg of m336 or 1 mg of m102.4 antibody (control) in 100 μ l per mouse, followed by monitoring daily for wellbeing (weight loss and other clinical manifestations) and mortality of mice. We noted that whereas treatment with 1 mg of m336 antibodies was effective in the protection against the lethality caused by MERS-CoV infection, it failed to protect mice fully from the onset of clinical illness (weight loss). Specifically, all of the challenged mice treated with 1 mg of m336 antibody suffered an attenuated (< 10%), and transient weight loss until day 9, and gradually recovered to day 21 when the experiment was terminated (Fig. 2) . Similarly, challenged mice treated with a low dose of 0.1 mg of m336 antibodies suffered from attenuated and transient weight loss until day 7 p.i. and gradually recovered. However, we noted a single death at day 9 in this low dose treatment group (Fig. 2) . As expected, all mice treated with a single dose of 1 mg of control m102.4 antibody exhibited profound weight loss (> 15%) and succumbed to MERS-CoV infection with 100% mortality by day 8 p.i. (Fig. 2) . Taken together, these results indicate that this MERS-CoV RBD-specific human m336 antibody can be highly effective as prophylactic or therapeutic modalities in protecting highly permissive transgenic mice against MERS-CoV infection and disease. We also investigated the protective mechanism of m336 against MERS-CoV by determining the lung virus titers in challenged mice at day 2 after treatment. Specifically, we sacrificed two mice (out of 6) in each group, as described above for Figs 1 and 2 and their lung specimens were harvested for determining viral titers by using via Vero E6 cell-based infectivity assay and quantitative PCR (Q-PCR)-based assay targeting the upstream E gene of MERS-CoV. As shown in Fig. 3A we were unable to recover infectious virus from any mouse treated with 1 mg of m336 antibody either before or after challenge with MERS-CoV. However, we were able to detect a barely detectable infectious virus, with the limit of detection (LOD) of 2.3 log TICD 50 /g, from a single mouse receiving 0.1 mg of m336 prior to viral challenge. These results indicated that mAb m336 most likely confers protection from lethal challenge by restricting viral replication within the lungs, thereby preventing viral infection in the brains and other organs. Titers of viral RNA copy number, as shown by qRT-PCR assays, were also compared among groups having different doses of mAbs. Lungs of infected mice were harvested on day 2 post-and pre-virus challenge group. All groups exhibited detectable viral RNA. Titers were significantly lower than those in the control group in all m336-treated groups. In the pretreatment group, mice treated with 1 mg of m336 showed a 2-log reduction in viral RNA detection, while a ~1 log reduction in viral numbers was seen in mice treated within 0.1 mg m336 when compared to mice receiving control mAb m102.4. In the post-treatment group, a smaller (~1 log) difference in viral RNA copy number (compared to that in the pretreatment group) was observed between mice treated with 1 mg antibody compared with those receiving control antibody, while a more than 1 log reduction in viral RNA number was seen in mice treated with 0.1 mg m336 when compared to mice receiving control mAb (Fig. 3B) . These data indicate that m336 confers significant protection to mice when administered pre-or post-viral challenge. Taken together, these results suggest to us that the epitope targeted by this exceptionally potent RBD-specific m336 antibody has a great potential for further development as a potent preventive and therapeutic agent in the future. Treatment with m336 attenuates lung pathology associated with MERS-CoV infection. The effect of m336 antibody treatment on the pulmonary pathology associated with MERS-CoV infection was evaluated by using formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded, and hematoxylin/eosin (H&E)-stained lung specimens harvested at day 2 p.i. Pulmonary pathology was noted in all mice that were treated with different doses of m336 or control m102.4 antibodies either before or after viral infection. On a severity scale of 0 to 3 (none, mild, moderate, severe), H&E-stained samples from mice pretreated with 1 mg and 0.1 mg of m336 antibody were graded 0 and 1, respectively, for perivascular and intra-alveolar infiltration of mononuclear cells, including lymphocytes, macrophages/monocytes (Fig. 4, Middle panel) , whereas those obtained from mice that received post-infection Lung specimens collected at day 2 after viral challenge were processed for assessing the viral titers by using both Vero E6-based infectivity assay and qRT-PCR targeting upstream E gene of MERS-CoV, and expressed as log 10 TCID 50 /gram and log 10 TCID 50 equivalent (eq.)/gram, respectively.
