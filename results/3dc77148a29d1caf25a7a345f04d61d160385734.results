Summary statistics for all variables used in the statistical analysis for FCV-suspect and healthy cats are presented in Table 1 . This includes the PCR results for URTDassociated pathogens. FCV infection was detected in 45 % (95 % CI 38-52 %) of the FCV-suspect cats and in 8 % (95 % CI 4-15 %) of the healthy cats. Among the 200 FCV-suspect and 100 healthy cats, 40 % (95 % CI 33 -47 %) and 14 % (95 % CI 8 -22 %) respectively, were co-infected with any of the tested URTD-associated pathogens. In summary, among the co-infected FCVsuspect cats, 77 % were positive for two, 21 % for three and 3 % for four pathogens. Among the co-infected healthy cats, 93 % were positive for two and 7 % for three pathogens. For details see Additional file 1. In 26 % (95 % CI 20-33 %) of the FCV-suspect cats, none of the tested URTD-associated pathogens were detected. Five cats (four FCV-suspect and one healthy cat, 1.7 %, 95 % CI 0.4-5 %) tested positive either for FeLV or for FIV. Because of the low prevalence, FIV and FeLV infections were not considered in the statistical analysis. Approximately two thirds of the cats lived in a group with other cats ( Table 1) ; details of the numbers of cats per group and the frequency of FCV infection are shown in Additional file 2. The majority of the FCV-suspect (76 %, 95 % CI 69-82 %) and healthy cats (80 %, 95 % CI 70-87 %) were vaccinated; of these 92 % of the FCVsuspect (95 % CI 86-96 %) and the healthy cats (95 % CI 83-97 %) had received a primary immunization defined as a minimum of two vaccinations two to six weeks apart with the same vaccine strain (Table 1 ). In both groups of cats, the vaccine strain most frequently used for primary immunization was FCV F9 (FCV-suspect cats: 81 %, 95 % CI 73-88 %; healthy cats: 86 %, 95 % CI 75-93 %) followed by FCV G1/431 (FCV-suspect cats: 10 %, 95 % CI 5-18 %; healthy cats: 11 %, 95 % CI 5-22 %). Because of the small number of cats vaccinated with a vaccine strain other than F9, vaccine strain was not considered in the statistical analysis. Based on univariable regression models, in FCVsuspect cats intact reproductive status, living in a group of at least four cats, co-infection with M. felis and both vaccination and primary immunization were found to be significantly associated with FCV infection ( Table 2 ). The former three predictors were found to be risk factors by approximately doubling the chance of a FCV infection (if being intact versus neutered, if living in a group of at least four cats and if being co-infected with M. felis). Being vaccinated at all or having received a primary immunization were found to be protective factors by reducing the chance of a FCV infection by approximately 50 %. In contrast, amongst the clinically healthy cats, the vaccination predictors were not significantly associated with FCV infection (Table 2) . Similarly to the FCV-suspect cats, intact reproductive status and living in a group of at least four cats were found to be risk factors, albeit with higher odds ratios and considerably larger confidence intervals than in the FCV-suspect cats. Details on missing values, univariable regressions with complete case and imputed data sets are presented in Additional file 3. Whereas p-values obtained with the original data and the imputed data are similar, p-values from complete case analyses differ slightly. Based on multivariable regression models, in FCVsuspect animals only intact reproductive status, living in a group of at least four cats and co-infection with M. felis remained in the final model with all odds ratios being reduced by at least 10 % compared to the univariable results (Table 3) . Based on the stepwise regression with all predictors, outdoor access was additionally found to be a risk factor for FCV infection (data not shown). None of the variables describing vaccination were found to be significant in the multivariable models. Regarding the clinically healthy cats, intact reproductive status and living in a group of at least four cats remained in the final model with higher odds ratios and larger confidence intervals than in the FCV-suspect cats. Stepwise regression was not possible for this group of cats due to lack of convergence. The clinical signs in the 200 cats chosen by the veterinary practitioners because of FCV-related symptoms are shown in Table 4 . In approximately half of the FCVsuspect cats, gingivitis or classical signs of URTD, such Primary immunization was defined as two subsequent vaccinations within 2 to 6 weeks with the same vaccine strain. e Positive by real-time qPCR/RT-qPCR as nasal discharge, ocular discharge, conjunctivitis and sneezing were present. Approximately one third of the cats exhibited stomatitis or caudal stomatitis, about 10 % demonstrated oral or lingual ulceration and only a few were found with swollen joints, lameness, skin ulcerations or cutaneous edema. Gingivitis, stomatitis, caudal stomatitis, salivation and oral and lingual ulcerations were significantly associated with FCV infection (Table 4 ). In contrast, nasal and ocular discharge and sneezing were significantly less common in the FCV PCR-positive than in the FCV PCR-negative cats. When the FCV load in the sample material was compared between FCV-positive diseased and FCV-positive healthy cats, the FCV loads were higher in the diseased cats, although statistical significance was not reached (FCV S1 RT-qPCR; p MWU = 0.07; Fig. 2 ).
