As shown in figure 7 , the maximum difference of outdoor air velocity between coarse, medium and fine meshes in range of 0 -180 and 0 -30 m where building is located, were both 0.15 m s 21 which was not significantly large. However, maximum difference of indoor velocity of the three meshes showed a difference. Coarse mesh and fine showed a maximum velocity difference of 0.1 m s 21 and medium mesh and fine mesh showed 0.06 m s 21 difference. Therefore, medium mesh with 6 million cell was considered independent and was selected for the simulation. Figure 8 shows the pressure distribution at the height of the patient's mouth on the eighth floor. In the case of the wind blowing from the west, when the wind direction was more perpendicular to the surface of the building, a positive pressure (greater than 3 Pa) was formed that was higher than that formed when the wind direction was less perpendicular to the building surface. Positive pressure was also formed on the west-southwest outer surface of the building, and a relatively high positive pressure (greater than 4 Pa) was observed in the angular part of the centre of the west side of the building. When the wind was blowing from the west-southwest direction, high positive pressure (greater than 3 Pa) was created on the west-southwest outer surface of the building, and the highest positive pressure (greater than 4 Pa) was formed in the west angular part of the building, which is similar to the case in which the wind was blowing from the west. In all the cases, in the side part of the building, a negative pressure was formed and a vortex was generated making the airflow separate and reattach to the side of the building. In the case of the west wind, air mainly flowed through front (a) window to rear (a) windows. In the case of the west-southwest wind, compared to the west wind, the airflow through the front (a) window decreased and the airflow through the front (b) window increased. The air mainly flowed in through front (b) and flowed out through the side windows and rear (a) windows. Figure 9 shows the results of the indoor passive tracer distribution. The analysis results for the west wind airflow indicated that the outdoor air mainly flowed in through the west-facing windows and flowed out through the rear windows. The passive tracer from the lying patient's mouth in ward 8104 mainly spread to wards 8111 and 8112. In the case of the west-southwest wind, compared to the west wind, the air mainly flowed in through west-southwest windows and flowed out through the side and rear windows. The passive tracer spread to ward 8109, 8110 and some portion spread to adjacent ward 8105. Figure 10 shows the volume-averaged concentration of the passive tracer in residential area which is 0-1.8 m in each room. In all the cases, no contaminants were detected in the maternity ward department, where no MERS infection cases were reported. Among all the wards, index patient ward (8104) had the highest concentration of the passive tracer in all the cases. It is difficult to directly relate the reported infected cases with the concentration of the passive tracer in wards because the wind does not continuously blow in one direction. However, in case WSW-1, which represents the actual situation when the index patient was hospitalized and the wind was blowing from the west-southwest, ward 8109, where the highest infected cases were reported, showed the highest concentration. In the case of ward 8107, where four infected cases were reported, the highest passive tracer concentration was only 0.02% compared to ward 8014 (100%). However, in a situation where the west or west-southwest wind was blowing and the east wind was blown after the passive tracer was spread, the passive tracer could re-spread to the west-facing wards. The concentration in each ward is shown in table 2, and the highest concentration in ward 8104 (case W-2) is considered to be 100%. In case W-1, where the wind was blowing from the west, relatively high concentration was observed in ward 8111 (10.7%) and 8112 (11.4%); both wards had three infected cases. Comparing with case W-1T, which is non-isothermal simulation, concentration difference of ward 8014 was not significant. However, wards 8111 and 8112 showed 3.64 and 2.47% lower concentration. This is due to buoyancy effect which forms upper air movement; the concentration is extracted at the occupied zone (0-1.8 m). In case WSW-1, the highest concentration was observed in ward 8109; 3.69% where most of infected cases were reported. In cases W-2 and WSW-2, where all ventilation system was not in operation, higher passive tracer concentration was observed in every contaminant-detected ward compared with other cases. In cases W-3 and WSW-3, which represented the full operation of mechanical ventilation conditions, the concentrations in ward 8104 were 4.90%, 45.4% lower than those of cases W-1 and WSW-1, respectively. In case W-3, the reduction rate of the concentration in ward 8104 was relatively low compared to case WSW-3. This is because the direct airflow from the west-facing window to the corridor was disturbed by the air supplied from the supply vent, which was located near the window and the patient. It is known that the supply of fresh air dilutes pollutants, but in the case of typical conditions, where the window is near the source, mechanical ventilation can counterbalance the reduction in pollutants. The ACH was calculated by using the concentration of the passive tracer in the ward with the passive tracer generation rate. In cases W-1, W-2 and W-3, the ACH was 21.5, 21.1 and 22.6, respectively. No significant increase in the ACH was observed by operating mechanical ventilation in ward 8104. In cases WSW-1, WSW-2 and WSW-3, ACH was 31.0, 26.9 and 40.0, respectively. ACH increased by approximately 6 when machine ventilation was operated in ward 8104. In case WSW, most of the air flowed through the side opening of the awning window to ward 8104; therefore, the air from outside did not disturb the airflow from the supply vent and more volume of air was passing through the windows compared to case W. In case W, air mostly flowed through the under part of the awning window and less air volume of air was passing through the window due to window shape and disturbed air flow from the supply vent.
