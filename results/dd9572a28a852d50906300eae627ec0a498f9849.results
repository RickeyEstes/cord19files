The first isolate of influenza C virus in France (G/Paris/145/91) since the isolation of C/Paris/l/67 was obtained from an adult during the 1990 to 1991 winter season and was studied. All manipulations were carried out with A/PR/ 8/34(HlNl), C/JHB/1/66 and G/Paris/145/91. All experiments on influenza C virions were carried out with freshly harvested virus immediately or after having been frozen at -80째C upon harvesting; otherwise most results were negative. The HA titre of each stock of virus used was 32 or diluted to this titre. Initially, we used the universal primer Unil which can be utilised to synthesise cDNA from all segments of influenza A and B viruses. The full length of C/ JHB/1/66 HEF RNA segment is 2073 nucleotides (Pfeiffer and Compans, 1984) and that of C/California/78 is 2071 (Nakada et al., 1984) . The sequences of the primers specific for the HEF segment of INF-C were based on C/JHB/1/66 and G/California/78. Using Seqaid ver 3.7, analyses were carried out to calculate the number of mismatches between the primers and the sequences of all available HEF genes from human INF-C (Table 1 ). The positions of the first nucleotide of each primer within the targeted gene are indicated. The numbering of each strain starts with the first nucleotide sequenced as no. 1. As shown in Table 1 , most strains have not been sequenced from the very first nucleotide at the 3' end of the gene. As expected, the extent of mismatch (number of mismatches/length of the respective primer) between A/5/1, A/l 117/2 and HEF gene sequences was very high, varying from 40 to 83%. On the contrary, EnzC/ 19 1 S/2 completely matched with all the HEF gene sequences, the 7 or 8 mismatches being due to the insertion of 2 stop codons and 1 restriction site. EnzC/2032/2 matched perfectly at the expected position with 7 strains out of the 11 analysed. However, the score of mismatches was high, between 33% and 52% (depending on the restriction site built into the primer), with 4 strains C/Nara/82, C/Mississipi/80, C/Kyoto/41/82 and C/ Hyogo/83. C/2046/2 matched perfectly and at the expected position with 8 strains including the 7 strains mentioned above for EnzC/2032/2 plus C/ Mississipi/80 (Table 1 ). The score of mismatches was high (46%) with C/Nara/ 82, C/Kyoto/41/82 and C/Hyogo/83. As shown in Figure 1 , lane 5 and Table 2 Sizes of PCR products Expected and observed sizes of PCR products are summarised. The sizes of the expected fragments were calculated according to the published sequences of C/JHB/l/66 (Pfeiffer and Compans, 1984) and A/PR/8/34 (Winter et al., 1981) . 18/2 pair of primers (Table 3) (Fig. 1, lane 6) . A band of 1908 bp was expected ( Table 2) . As a positive reaction control (Fig. 1, lane l) , A/PR/ 8/34 RNA segments were transcribed into cDNAs with Unil and the cDNAs were then amplified with the A/5/1 and A/l 117/2 primers specific for the HA1  target: A/PR/8/34 Reverse transcription was performed with A/5/1 or C/10/1 specific for the HA or the HEF RNA segment of influenza A and C viruses respectively (as described in Material and Methods). cDNAs were then submitted to PCR using different primers and various combinations of them as indicated in Table 4 for each lane. The target gene was segment 4 of the strains A/PR/8/34, C/JHB/1/66 and C/Paris/l45/91. The molecular weights indicated by arrowheads in the margins are 2320, 2020 and 560 base pairs. coding region of A(HlN1) segment 4 (Table 3) . A band of 1129 bp (sd = 30 bp) was detectable against a theoretical size of 1112 bp (Table 2) . On the contrary, these A/PR/8/34 cDNAs were not amplified when the pair of primers specific for influenza C HEF RNA segment was used (Fig. 1, lane 2) (Table 3) . A band around 1000 bp was not detectable when INF-C cDNAs were first synthesised with Unil and then amplified with the A/5/1-A/1117/2 pair of primers (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4) (Table 3 ). All negative controls were negative as shown in Fig. 1, lanes 8 and 9. The synthesis of cDNA was also carried out with the C/10/1 primer designed for the 4th segment of influenza C virus genome (Table 4) . No amplification could be detected when A/PR/8/34 cDNA primed with C/10/1 was submitted to PCR with the A/5/1-A/1 117/2 pair of primers (Fig. 2, lane 1) (Table 4 ). As expected no band was visualised when the cDNA of HA RNA segment of A/ PR/8/34 was amplified with the C/10/1-C/2046/2 pair of primers (Fig. 2 , lane 2) ( Table 4) . On the contrary, the cDNA of the HEF RNA of C/JHB/1/66 and C/ Paris/145/91 were both amplified when the reaction was primed with C/10/l-C/ 2046/2 (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4) (Table 4 ). All negative controls were negative as shown in Fig. 2 , lanes 9 to 14 (Table 4) . When 30 cycles of 94째C for 0.48 min, 55째C for 0.48 min and 72째C for 1.5 min were applied, amplification of INF-C was not observed, whereas amplification Combinations of reverse transcription and PCR primers used to amplify HEF cDNAs synthesised with A/5/1 or C/10/1 The numbers of the lanes correspond to the numbers of the lanes of the gel shown in Fig. 2 . For each lane, the combination of reverse transcription and PCR primers are indicated by + and -signs. Restriction sites analysis of HEF genes The restriction sites analysis has been computer-assisted with Seqaid ver 3.7 and performed for all the sequences of the HEF gene of human TNF-C published so far. They were obtained from Genbank and their names are followed by their accession number and the references of publication. of A/PR/8/34 was successful (data not shown). These results led to using the conditions described in Material and Methods. According to the results in Figs. 1 and 2, specificity was not affected by a lower temperature of annealing (45"C), although rare extraneous bands were present. The products of amplification of the full length HEF cDNA (from position 10 to 2046) obtained for G/Paris/145/91 can be used for direct sequencing. The products of the PCR primed with backward primers into which restriction sites had been built, such as HindIIIC/1918/2, XbaIC/1918/2, XbaIC/2032/2 and S&C/2032/2 (Table 4 ) were used to prepare DNA fragments (Fig. 2 , lanes 5-8) for cloning purposes in the sequencing vector: bacteriophage M13mp19 (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and also in the shuttle expression vector: plasmide pSV-SPORT1 (Gibco/BRL, USA). The occurrence of HindIII, SacI, ,S&I, SmaI and X&I restriction sites was assessed for all the sequences of INF-C HEF cDNA published so far, obtained from Genbank, and also in purified PCR products. As shown in Table 5 , the existence of a Hind111 restriction site, which was predictable from the published sequence of C/JHB/1/66, was confirmed for the PCR product. Occurrence of Hind111 restriction sites varies from strain to strain. As shown in Table 5 , the number of sites varies from 0 to 2. The strains C/California/78 and G/England/892/83 have no Hind111 site, whereas C/Taylor/ 1233/47, C/Nara/82, C/Mississipi/80, C/Kyoto/41/82 as well as C/JHB/1/66 have 2 sites and C/Yamagata/l0/83, C/Ann Arbor/l/SO, C/ Great Lake/1167/54 have 1 site. The positions of Hind111 restriction sites are 986, 994 or 1052 and/or 1562, 1570 or 1628. When cDNA of C/JHB/ l/66 was submitted to PCR with C/10/1-C/2046/2, the length of the undigested PCR product was 2029 bp (sd = 12.5 bp), which is in accordance with the sequence data (Table 2 ). After digestion, 3 bands were generated: 1069 bp (sd = 12.5 bp), 559 bp (sd = 12.5 bp) and 367 bp (sd = 12.5 bp) instead of 1052 bp, 576 bp and 445 bp we expected as indicated in Table 5 . The electrophoreses were carried out on a submarine mini-gel and this may account for a lack of accuracy of measurement. As shown in Fig. 2 , lane 4, when HEF cDNA from G/Paris/145/91 was the template for PCR ( Table 4 ) the length of the undigested product was 2035 bp (sd = 20 bp) ( Table 2) . After digestion by HindIII, there were three bands of 1101 bp (sd = 20 bp), 561 bp (sd = 20 bp) and 362 bp (sd = 20 bp) as shown in Table 5 , the total of which being 2024 bp (k 60 bp). These findings are close to those for C/Hyogo/l/83, C/Kyoto/41/82 and C/Nara/82 (all Japanese strains) by analysis of their sequence as shown in Table 5 . No SacI, s&I, SmuI and X&I restriction sites existed in the full length HEF gene of C/JHB/1/66 as expected from the sequence as well as in any HEF gene of any INF-C sequenced so far including G/Paris/145/91 (Table 5) . As a consequence, the DNA amplified with the C/10/1-XbuIC/1918/2, C/10/1-XbuIC/2032/2 or C/10/1-S&C/2032/2 pairs of primers can be used for oriented cloning experiments in the polycloning sites of bacteriophage M 13mp19 and pSV-SPORT1 with little risk of encountering undesired restriction sites in an unknown strain. Digestions of bacteriophage M 13mp19 and pSV-SPORT1 with SmuI and XbuI can be carried out in the same incubation buffer and generate one blunt end and one cohesive end in the correct orientation. The DNA amplified with the C~lO~l-~~~C/2032/2 pair of primers (Fig. 2, lanes 67,  8) can also be cloned in both types of vectors using SmaI and Salf for digestions. The DNA amplitied with pairs of primers containing HindHI restriction sites such as HindIIIC/1918/2 cannot be used for cloning because of internal Hind111 sites in the gene of interest in C/Paris/l45/91.
