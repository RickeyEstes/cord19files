The baseline socio demographic and clinical profiles were similar in both the intervention and control groups (Table 1) . Most participants were in the critical phase of dengue infection, with slightly more participants in the recovery phase in the intervention group. However, there were more participants who had a documented body temperature > 38ËšC in the control group than the intervention group. More than half of the participants were confirmed to have dengue fever. The pilot study found a positive trend towards a reduction in the need for hospitalization and intravenous fluid treatment for the participants in the intervention group compared with those in the control group (Table 2) . Among the 138 participants who were included in the final analysis, there were fewer hospital admissions in the intervention group (n = 7, 10.0%) than the control group (n = 12, 17.6%) (p = 0.192). Similarly, fewer patients in the intervention group (n = 9, 12.9%) required intravenous fluid compared to the control group (n = 15, 22.1%) (p = 0.154). The mean peak haematocrit, the difference in haematocrit values between the first two clinic visits, cut off points reached and the haematocrit fluctuation ! 20% for both groups were similar. The mean nadir platelet count and the mean difference in platelet levels between the first two clinic visits were also similar between both groups. The average daily fluid intake was higher in the intervention group (about 3,000 ml) compared to the control group (about 2,500 ml), but the difference did not reach statistical significance.
