Nonparticipants (lost to follow-up) and participants were similar in terms of preoperative function, number of comorbidities, and body mass index, but nonparticipants were older. All participants completed baseline preoperative assessments and had at least one assessment during the 4 months postoperative period with 50.7%, 26.4%, and 5.6% assessed 2, 3, and 4 times, respectively. As can be seen in Figs. 1-4 , pain and disability declined and 6MWT increased fairly steadily between 1 and 9 to 12 weeks. Site of arthroplasty (Fig. 1) was a significant predictor of the estimated WOMAC pain score at 1 week after surgery. Fig. 2 illustrates the impact of preoperative scores by plotting each curve based on the preoperative WOMAC pain score for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile scores for the patients. Interactions of the predictors with time were tested but were not significant, indicating that these variables did not affect change over time. In terms of the WOMAC pain scores, there was significant variation between individuals in pain at 1 week postsurgery, but thereafter, the subsequent rate of change was similar among patients. Therefore, patterns of improvement of WOMAC pain were similar for patients with TKA and THA and for individuals with different preoperative pain levels. A model with similar parameters provided the best fit for the WOMAC physical function subscale scores. The only difference was that site of arthroplasty was not a significant predictor. During model development, gender was a predictor of 1-week score until preoperative baseline score was added, at which time, it was no longer significant ( P = .084). The interaction of the predictors with time was not significant, indicating that these clinical variables did not affect change over time. Preoperative 6MWT score, gender, and site of arthroplasty were all significant predictors of 6MWT distances at 1 week after surgery (Figs. 3 and 4). Fig. 3 shows that patients with higher preoperative 6MWT distance scores had higher function at 1 week postoperatively than patients with lower preoperative scores. A significant interaction was found with baseline preoperative 6MWT score and weeks after surgery, such that patients with higher preoperative scores are predicted to have a faster rate of improvement than those beginning with lower scores (ie, shorter distances). The interaction of the growth parameter with site of arthroplasty indicates that the instantaneous rate of change differs for patients after THA and TKA at 1 week after surgery, with individuals undergoing TKA showing a slower gain in distance over time (Fig. 4) . Although women begin with lower 6MWT scores, their rate of improvement is similar to men. Predictors for the TUG model included gender, site of arthroplasty, baseline TUG function, and an interaction between time and arthroplasty site. One week after surgery, women have worse TUG function than men, and patients post-THA are slower than those post-TKA. Similar to the 6MWT model, there was an interaction between time and site of arthroplasty, with patients after THA demonstrating a faster rate of recovery than patients post-TKA. As in the other models, the TUG model indicated that patients varied according to their initial score, 1 week after surgery, but the pattern of growth was the same among patients. Comorbidities and age were not predictive variables for any of the models.
