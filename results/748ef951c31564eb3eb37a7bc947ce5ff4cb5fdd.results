Free Fluorescein Does Not Interact with RNA Single Strands or Duplex. To test for binding between free fluorescein and RNA, the fluorescence of free fluorescein titrated into standard melting buffer (buffer/fluorescein) was compared to the fluorescence of free fluorescein titrated into RNA single strand (5 0 GAACAAACGG3 0 ) or duplex (5 0 GAACAAACGG/ 3 0 CUUGUUUG) (buffer/oligonucleotide/fluorescein) at 100 nM. Presumably, intercalation of the dye would change the emission profile or the intensity of emission. In titrations with 2, 20, 100, and 1000 nM fluorescein, however, the fluorescence from the buffer/fluorescein solution was always within experimental error of the fluorescence from the buffer/oligonucleotide/fluorescein solution. Fluorescein Attached to an Oligonucleotide Interacts with the RNA. The fluorescence of fluorescein covalently linked to the 5 0 end of an oligonucleotide is quenched upon duplex formation ( Figure 2B and 2D) . Evidently, fluorescein interacts with the helix, presumably by stacking and possibly forming hydrogen bonds. UV melting experiments reveal that covalently linked fluorescein stabilizes a duplex (Table 1) , which also indicates interaction between fluorescein and the helix. A fluorescein-quencher pair also stabilizes a duplex (Table 1) . These interactions must be taken into account when the free energy for the reference structure with a pseudoknot is calculated. Values and increments from T m -1 versus ln([C] T /4) plots in Table 1 were used for the calculation of pseudoknot free energy. FCA/DA and FCA Methods Give Similar Results. Panels C and D of Figure 2 show fluorescence titrations for FCA/DA on PSK 1 and FCA on PSK 2, respectively, along with the fitted curves for each experiment at pH 7.0. The free energy diagrams including free energy change calculations are shown in panels A and B of Figure 4 , respectively. To compare with previous measurements on 437D PSK (44, 45) , the predicted free energy increment (62) for the two 5 0 dangling G residues on 437D PSK ( Figure 1B) was included in the predicted ΔG 37,HP 0 for the FCA experiment, and for the FCA/DA experiment, the total free energy of the pseudoknot was made less favorable by the free energy increment for the 3 0 dangling GCF in PSK 1 (see the Supporting Information, II). The table in Figure 4 These results agree with expectations from the BWYV pseudoknot crystal structure (PDB entry 437D). In the crystal structure, there is a quadruple-base interaction with a hydrogen bond between protonated C8 and G12 at the joint of stems 1 and 2 ( Figure 1C ). An increasing pH will weaken this interaction and destabilize the pseudoknot. The FCA/DA results, however, give a destabilization of 1.2 ( 0.6 kcal/mol between pH 6.0 and 8.0 at 37°C, whereas previous measurements by DSC and optical melting at temperatures between 49 and 82°C gave destabilizations of 3.4 ( 1.1 and 2.6 ( 1.1 kcal/mol, respectively, when extrapolated to 37°C (44) . FCA Measurements of the Sequence Dependence of Pseudoknot Stability. Free energies of BWYV PSK 2 mutants in the stem 2-loop 1 region were measured by FCA. Figure 5 summarizes the mutations. Except for PSK-CG, 5 0 FGUUU-GUUC3 0 was the competition strand, i.e., the same as for PSK 2. For PSK-CG, the competition strand was 5 0 FCGUUUGUUC3 0 , to allow saturated binding at convenient concentrations of the pseudoknot. Table 2 lists the measured ΔG 37 0 values for the transition from pseudoknot to hairpin (PSK-HP) and from unfolded RNA to pseudoknot (PSK), along with predictions by the statistical polymer model (SPM) of Cao and Chen (42) and the NUPACK model (33) . The value of ΔG 37,PSK-HP 0 shows the relative stability of the pseudoknot to the stem 1 hairpin, which is important for the function of many pseudoknots (18, 27, 30, 31) . Some mutations make the free energy of the pseudoknot more favorable, but it may not make the pseudoknot more stable relative to the corresponding hairpin and vice versa. Table 2 also lists the changes (ΔΔG 37 0 ) of ΔG 37 0 for the transitions due to mutations to PSK 2. This provides insight into the effects of different factors on pseudoknot stability.
