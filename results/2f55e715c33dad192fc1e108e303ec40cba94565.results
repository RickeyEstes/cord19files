In this study, there were 237 patients in the control group and 227 patients in the studied group. The demographic and clinical data between control and studied groups are summarized in Table 1 . There were no significant differences between the 2 groups except for more surgical patients were enrolled in the control group. VAP occurred less frequently in the studied group (6 of 227, 2.6%) than in the control group (26 of 237, 11.0%; P Ͻ 0.001) ( Table 2) . Similarly, the incidence rate of VAP was significantly lower in the studied than in the control groups (2.04 versus 6.51 per 1000 ventilator days, P ϭ 0.002). The onset of VAP ranged from 3 to 7 days with a median of 4 days in the control group and 4 to 7 days with a median of 5 days in the studied group. Of note, the duration of mechanical ventilator was significantly reduced in the studied group. The length of ICU stay also decreased in the studied group, however, the difference did not reach statistic significance. To determine the independent factors responsible for the reduction of VAP in the studied group, the variables with a P value Յ0.1 listed in Table 1 and the intervention, intermittent suction of oral secretions before each positional change were analyzed. After stepwise logistic regression analysis, intermittent suction of oral secretions before each positional change was the only independent factor for the reduction of VAP (OR ϭ 0.250, 95% CI ϭ 0.101-0.624, P ϭ 0.003). Comparisons of demographic and clinical data of VAP patients between the control and studied groups are shown in Table 3 . Compared with control group, the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay were significantly reduced in the studied group. The potential pathogens of VAP yielded from cultures of endotracheal aspirates in control and studied groups are shown in Table 4 . No growth was found in 1 of 26 cases in the control group and in 2 of 6 in the studied group. The microorganisms yielded from the culture of endotracheal aspirates from VAP patients in this study were those appeared to be the pathogens of late-onset VAP, although none of VAP occurred 7 days after endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.
