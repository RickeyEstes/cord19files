3.1. Donor T cells, but not macrophages and DCs, traffic to the spinal cord in infected RAG1 −/− recipient mice J2.2v-1-infected RAG1 −/− mice that receive splenocytes from MHV-JHM immune B6 mice develop demyelination, while demyelination is absent in infected mice that receive splenocytes depleted of CD4 and CD8 T cells (Wu et al., 2000) . Thus, T cells are necessary for induction of demyelination in J2.2v-1-infected RAG1 −/− mice. However, since demyelination is characterized by dense infiltration of F4/80 + and CD11c + macrophages/microglia and DCs, it is possible that transferred phagocytic cells play a role in myelin destruction. Therefore, in the absence of an activating factor such as IFN-γ responsiveness in recipient mice, donor IFN-γR + phagocytic cells may be able to compensate in the presence of T cells to mediate demyelinating disease. To rule out the presence of donor F4/80 + and CD11c + macrophages as a contributing factor in the diseased spinal cord of chronically infected RAG1 −/− mice, we transferred donor splenocytes from MHV-JHM immune mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 1) . At 8 days post-transfer, the spinal cords of infected RAG1 −/− mice exhibited infiltration of GFP + cells, many of which were positive for the T cell markers CD4 and CD8 (Fig. 1A,  B) . However, F4/80 + macrophages were uniformly GFP − (Fig. 1C, D) . Furthermore, CD11c + cells were also GFP − , and were clustered in the spinal cord near GFP + cells (Fig. 1E, G) or appeared in a circular, perivascular arrangement (Fig. 1) . Therefore, F4/80 + and CD11c + cells in the MHV-J2.2v-1infected spinal cord were not donor-derived.
