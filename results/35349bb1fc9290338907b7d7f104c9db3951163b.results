Plasma samples were obtained from clinically healthy young-adult (< 2 years-old) intact female cats by collecting 1 mL of blood into tubes containing citrate and then centrifuged at 1,800 x g for 8 min. Urine samples were collected by ultrasound-guided cystocentesis and immediately centrifuged at 1,000 x g for 8 min. Every cat was given a baseline complete history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation. All had normal complete blood count, serum chemistry, and urinalysis. Lipids were analyzed using liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In total, 212 lipids were characterized in feline plasma and urine samples. The origin of these metabolites was mainly from food and endogenous compounds. In plasma, glycerophospholipids showed the higher number of chemical species detected (n=101) followed by sphingolipids (n=35), glycerolipids (n=23), fatty acyls (n=22) and sterol lipids (n=3). In urine, the highest structure diversity was observed for polar lipids, namely, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, with 15 and 7 chemical species identified within each category, respectively. Figure 1 shows the relative abundance of each lipid category based on signal intensity found in the feline plasma and urine samples. Of note, 150 out of 212 lipids identified in this study have not been reported previously in cats. This is the first study describing the lipid composition in plasma and urine of healthy cats comprehensively. Many of the lipids found in this study have been used as biomarkers in human medicine for different pathologies including linoleic and arachidonic acids for kidney diseases; SM(38:1) and SM(42:1) for insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; LPC(16:0), LPC(18:0), PC(34:1), PC(34:2), PC(36:4) and cholesterol for hepatocellular carcinoma, among others. Thus, the novel information generated in this study could lead to the discovery of novel biomarker candidates for detecting and studying feline diseases and individualized treatments for cats.
