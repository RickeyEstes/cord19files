Sequence and structure analyses of Drosophila XendoU homologs. Sequence analysis highlighted the occurrence of two Drosophila proteins homologous to X. laevis XendoU, encoded by CG2145 and CG3303 genes (www.flybase.org). The CG2145 product is assigned an endoribonuclease activity, whereas the CG3303 product is annotated as putative serine-protease by the UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/), NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov) and GO (http://gowiki.tamu.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) databases. Comparison of Drosophila and XendoU protein sequences showed significant differences in length (592 amino acids for CG2145 and 322 residues for CG3303), which are mostly contributed by the N-terminal regions (Fig. 1a) . The C-terminal regions, instead, have similar length (281 and 276 amino acids, respectively) and high sequence identity (41%). The multiple sequence alignment of CG3303 and CG2145 with XendoU and human PP11 homologues, shown in Fig. 1b , highlighted that the 1-250 region of XendoU, comprising most of the residues previously reported to be involved in catalytic activity 2 , was well conserved in both Drosophila isoforms and PP11. Conversely, the 251-292 region is more variable in both length and sequence. This region contains several residues, including N270, H272, G277, T278 and Y280, involved in binding the RNA substrate based on the experimentally determined XendoU structure 3 . The high sequence variability in this region indicates that the mode of RNA substrate binding is likely to be different between the two Drosophila proteins. The same conservation pattern shown in Fig. 1b is also observed in a multiple sequence alignment extended to over 700 XendoU homologs (Supplementary Table 1 ). Here, the three XendoU residues whose point mutation abolished catalysis (i.e., H162, H178, K224) are 100% conserved, most of the other residues whose mutation affects catalysis being conserved in > 90% of the sequences (see Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1) 2 . Conversely, in the 251-292 variable region, only two of the RNA binding residues are conserved in > 50% of the homologous sequences. These data indicate that the XendoU regions involved either in the catalytic mechanism alone or in both catalysis and RNA binding are more conserved among family members than those responsible for RNA binding only. Biochemical characterisation of CG2145 and CG3303 activities. Due to their poor solubility as recombinant enzymes, CG2145 and CG3303 proteins were in vitro translated, together with luciferase as control ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). To investigate RNase activity, RNA processing assays were performed in the presence of Mn 2+ as described 1 . Oligoribonucleotides P1 and P2 were used as substrates. P1 contains a natural XendoU cleavage site comprising a 3 U stretch; P2 is a P1 variant where the 3 U stretch is replaced by 2 Us 1 . The time course in Fig. 2a shows the CG3303 RNA cleavage products. As defined by densitometric analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1b) "a" and "b" molecules (long arrows in the scheme) are the major products deriving from cleavages between U residues in P1. Products "c", "e" and "f " are less abundant (short arrows) deriving from cleavages between CU, UC and AU respectively; "d" and "g" products (arrowheads), are visible only after prolonged incubation. A similar cleavage pattern was observed on P2. Altogether, these results indicate that CG3303 preferentially cleaves at oligo(U). RNA processing assays with in vitro translated CG2145 (Fig. 2b ) clearly show that preferential cleavage occurs between A and C nucleotides ("g" products, long arrows in the scheme). The other products derive from less efficient cleavages ( Supplementary Fig. 1c ). To analyse ion-dependence of cleavage, P1 processing reactions were performed in the presence of Mn 2+ or different cations. Figure 2c shows that only Mn 2+ triggered CG3303 and CG2145 specific activities, whereas Co 2+ induced unspecific cleavages as in luciferase control (lanes Co). These results indicate that the two Drosophila enzymes are Mn 2+ -dependent endoribonucleases. Finally, the chemistry of the reaction was determined by analysing the 3′ ends of the P1 products generated by CG3303 or CG2145. Unlabelled cleavage products "a", "b" and "g" (indicated aside each gel of Fig. 2d) , and full-length P1 as control, were conjugated with 5′ -[ 32 P]pCp upon differential enzymatic treatments. Specifically, alkaline phosphatase treatment (lanes P) removes phosphate only from linear ends, whereas kinase treatment removes 2′ -3′ -cyclic phosphate (lanes K) 1 . As shown in Fig. 2d , the "a" and "b" cleavage products generated by CG3303 are labelled only after kinase treatment, indicating the occurrence of cyclic phosphate termini (panel CG3303); conversely, CG2145 generates products with linear 3′ ends that are labelled upon both treatments (panels CG2145). These results indicate that the two enzymes act through different catalytic mechanisms. Based on biochemical features, we assigned CG3303 product to the Eukaryotic EndoU ribonuclease family and named it DendoU (Drosophila endoribonuclease U-specific). CG2145 and dendoU expression profiles and loss-of-function analyses. We analysed temporal expression of CG2145 and dendoU at specific Drosophila developmental stages (Fig. 3a) . CG2145 and dendoU mRNAs progressively accumulated throughout development, and showed a 25-and 8-fold increase in adults compared to embryos, respectively. Spatial expression profiles in adult somatic and germinal tissues revealed that CG2145 and dendoU mRNAs were highly expressed in Drosophila's head (Fig. 3b) . To delve into CG2145 and dendoU function, we analyzed their mutant phenotypes. For CG2145, we exploited the insertional mutant P{EP}CG2145 G605 11 . It produced 80% lower mRNA levels and undetectable protein levels compared to wild type ( Supplementary Fig. 2a,b) . Mutant flies were viable and fertile, without noticeable behavioural or developmental phenotypes (Supplementary video 1). Since no mutant alleles were available for dendoU, we exploited the GAL4/UAS binary system 12 to induce dendoU silencing in vivo by transgenic double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) 13 . Scientific RepoRts | 7:41559 | DOI: 10.1038/srep41559 Ubiquitous dendoU dsRNA expression, driven by actin-GAL4, induced dendoU mRNA decrease by about 60% in the interfered larvae compared to control ( Supplementary Fig. 2c ) and resulted in late pupal lethality. This finding indicates that dendoU is an essential gene in Drosophila. Therefore, we deepened our analyses on DendoU. and CG3303 compared to XendoU. Sequence numbering indicates starting and ending residues of XendoU and the CG2145 and CG3303 regions homologous to XendoU (see panel b). These regions comprise a highly conserved segment (EndoU-like, white boxes) and a variable segment (striped boxes). The N-terminal regions of CG2145 and CG3303 comprise additional segments not present in XendoU. The N-terminal region of CG2145 is significantly longer and comprises a signal peptide (black box), a long disordered and prolinerich region (gray box), and a short glycine-rich segment (light gray box). The N-terminal region of CG3303 comprises a disordered segment (dotted box) and a predicted trans-membrane region (horizontally-striped box). (b) Multiple sequence alignment of CG3303 and CG2145 products with human PP11 and X. laevis XendoU. Residues that are not visible in the experimental XendoU structure are lower-case. Identical residues at the same alignment position have a black background. Positions where all residues are identical are indicated by black triangles. XendoU_SS: secondary structure elements detected in the 3D XendoU structure; α -helices and β -strands are indicated with α and β and a number indicating their progression along the amino acid sequence. XendoU_FR: XendoU residues (i) with a key functional role, i.e., those reported to diminish (d) or abolish (C) catalysis if mutated; affect RNA binding (R); in contact with the phosphate molecule in XendoU 3D structure (P); and (ii) shown to interact with XendoU key-residues in the 3D structure (O). XendoU_%: conservation of XendoU residues in a multiple sequence alignment comprising over 700 family members (see Supplementary Table 1) ; numbers 0, 1, 2, … , 8, 9 indicate conservation in the ranges: < 10%, 10-19%, 20-29%, … , 80-89%, 90-99%, respectively; catalytic residues, which are 100% conserved in the extended multiple sequence alignment, are indicated by * . Unfortunately, reiterated efforts for generating specific antibodies against DendoU protein were not successful, likely due to the shortness of the region diversifying DendoU from CG2145 (see Fig. 1a ). Neuronal silencing of dendoU expression severely impairs fly lifespan, development and motor performance. Since eyes and brain are the major components of Drosophila's head, where dendoU is predominantly expressed, we used the developing eye-specific GMR-GAL4, or the pan-neuronal elav-GAL4 drivers for dendoU tissue-specific silencing. GMR-GAL4 mediated dendoU RNAi in vivo did not produce any significant eye Unprocessed RNAs were run in lanes U. 1 bp-step ladders, derived from P1 or P2 hydrolysis, are fractionated in lanes L. Letters "a-g" point to cleavage products. Bottom: schemes of P1 and P2 sequences and cleavage site positions. Long arrows, short arrows and arrowheads point to preferential cleavage sites, sites cleaved less efficiently and minor sites, respectively (quantification in Supplementary Fig. 1b Table 2 ). Besides pupal lethality (17%) and eclosion defects (3%), a drastic reduction in median lifespan was observed (the median lifespan was 32.07 ± 0.43 days for control flies vs 2.05 ± 0.01 days for elav-G4 > dendoU RNAi flies) (Fig. 4b) . Moreover, adult flies displayed several abnormalities (Fig. 4c) . They appeared as immature animals bearing unexpanded wings, soft cuticle, unretracted ptilinum, dimpled dorsal thorax, and misoriented scutellar bristles. Remarkably, immature-looking flies also showed severe locomotor defects and marked uncoordination. Compared to control flies (Supplementary video 2), pan-neuronal interfered flies were quite unable to walk or stay upright, and usually became stuck in the culture medium immediately after eclosion. Impaired body posture and overall weakness were so severe that standard climbing assay could not be performed. Therefore, locomotor activity of these flies was assessed by evaluating voluntary locomotion on a horizontal surface (Supplementary video 3). As shown in the video, walking assays revealed substantial impairment of motor capacities. Flies were unable to move and promptly restore themselves to an upright position after being knocked down to the bottom of a dish by gentle agitation. The same immature phenotype and locomotor defects were observed in an independent RNAi line, upon exclusion of any off-target effect ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ,b and Supplementary video 4).
