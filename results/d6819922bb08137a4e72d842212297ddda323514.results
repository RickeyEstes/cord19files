Four separate experiments were performed and results of each were similar. A representative experiment, utilizing the a-Class I clone C2-11 is shown in Fig. 1 . This clone proliferated when stimulated with one-, two-, three-and four-week-old cultures of DNA glial cells but not when cultured with syngeneic B6 glial ceils. Proliferative responses of equivalent numbers of C2-11 cells to 5 x 106 allogeneic DBA spleen cells were usually 3-to 5-fold less than those observed with DBA glial ceils. Therefore, it is unlikely that the proliferation noted with glial cells was the result of contamination of these cultures by large numbers of hematopoietic ceils. Class I MHC antigens, as defined by induction of clone proliferation, thus could be detected very early in culture and remained detectable thereafter. Clones C2-15 and BD6-6, reactive with Class II (presumably Ia d) antigens, did not proliferate when cultured with untreated DBA glial ceils of any age. A representative experiment with Clone BD6-6 is shown in Fig. 2 . This clone did respond to aUogeneic spleen cells (data not shown). Clone C2-16, responsive to background, non-H2-linked antigens also did not proliferate when stimulated with DBA glial cells (data not shown). When glial cells were cultured for three days with medium containing 30% 2 ° SN, marked changes in the patterns of T cell clone proliferation were observed (Figs. 1 and 2). Proliferation of a-Class I clone C2-11 was markedly decreased in one-, twoand four-week cultures. In contrast an a-Class II-specific clone (BD6-6) response could now be detected but only with treated glial cultures that were one week post-explantation (Fig. 2) . Proliferative responses of BD6-6 cells to 5 × 106 allogeneic mouse spleen cells were equivalent to those noted with 2 ° SN-treated, allogeneic glia. After two weeks of in vitro growth the ability of treated DBA glia to stimulate BD6-6 cell proliferation was lost (Fig. 2) . Supernatant-treated glia of any age did not induce proliferation of the a-non-H2, background clone. Thus, based on the limited numbers of clones tested, the effects of 2 ° SN on clonal proliferation were specific for clones responsive to MHC antigens. To determine whether the a-Class II-proliferative response resulted from 2 ° SN passively bound to gtia, cells from an 11-2 indicator line were added to glial cultures that had been exposed to 2 ° SN for three days and then washed. No proliferation was observed. Thus, passive binding of functionally detectable amounts of 11-2 to cultures of 2 ° SN-treated glia cells was not noted.
