The parameters in the model, such as the quarantine rate, are time varying, and thus we divided data into different stages (according to the changes of measures during the epidemic), and we assumed the parameters within each stage are relatively stable. We defined time before Jan 30, 2020 as stage Ⅰ, and after Jan 30th, 2020 as stage Ⅱ. To guarantee enough data points within the two stages, the start and end of the stages may vary by one or two days. Wuhan has recently undergone stricter measures of quarantine and transmission limiting, and clinical diagnosis was adopted after Feb 12th, we thus further did a stage III analysis of the dynamics in Wuhan using data after Feb 13th. Figure 1 shows the inference and prediction of epidemic dynamics of Wuhan using stage Ⅰ, Ⅱ and Ⅲ data respectively. The first 15 daily data points (from Jan 28th to Feb 11th) of stage Ⅱ were used to fit the model and infer parameters. The following 10 daily data points were used as test data for evaluating the performance of the model.
