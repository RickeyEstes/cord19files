Decline of TGEV positive cases from 2008-2016. Between January 2008 and November 2016, 29,397 porcine enteric cases, distributed across 41 states in the US and Mexico, were tested for TGEV by real time RT-PCR, and 2.3% of the cases (n = 667) were positive for TGEV ( Table 1 ). The percentage of TGEV positive cases was 4.0% in 2008, increased to 6.8% in 2010, and decreased to 0.4% in 2014 (Table 1) . After the introduction of PEDV in the US, the prevalence of TGEV decreased further to less than 0.1%. Positive TGEV cases were detected in the main pig raising regions (Midwest, South-central, and Southeast) of the US (Fig. 1A) between January 2008 and November 2016. Most of the cases (n = 13,190) were from Minnesota where 2.7% (n = 356) were positive for TGEV. The percent of positive TGEV cases per state ranged between 0.4-20.6%, with the highest percentage found in Tennessee. A seasonality trend occurred with the positive cases between winter and spring (November to April) compared to summer and fall (May to October) (Fig. 1B) . Genomic characteristic, entropy and recombination analyses. The genomic nucleotide sequence alignments of the 37 TGEV and 3 PCRV strains revealed two main genotypes (traditional and variant genotypes) ( Fig. 2A) There were 8 major regions of insertion or deletion (INDELs) between the traditional and variant TGEV strains. In the variant group, 3 deletion regions occurred within NSP3, 2 deletion regions occurred between the S and ORF3a genes, 1 deletion regions occurred in ORF3a genes, 1 deletion region occurred between the ORF3a and ORF3b genes and a single deletion occurred in the M genes ( Table 2 and Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, the same ORF3a and ORF3b deletions were present in some of the historical TGEV strains. However, these deletions were not present in the TGEV strain Purdue, which was used to create the attenuated TGEV vaccine in the US. The variant TGEV strain Illinois139/2006 had a 128-nucleotide deletion in ORF3a, which resulted in the truncated protein compared with our variant TGEV strains. The traditional TGEV strains Z/1986, HB/1988, and Mex/145/2008 shared the same 6 nucleotide deletions in the S gene that were present in the TGEV strain, Purdue. Surprisingly, the PCRV strains contained an assortment of these deletions in their genomes, and compared to the historical TGEV strains, the TGEV strains from our study (excluding Z/1986, HB/1988 and Mex/145/2008) contained 8 deletions and 119 amino acid changes similar to the recently reported PRCV strain OH7269 and the single PRCV strain Minnesota155/2016 from our study. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ To determine the level of nucleotide or amino acid variation across the TGEV genomes, entropy analysis was conducted with an alignment of the complete genomes and concatenated amino acid sequences (Fig. 3) . Based on the level of diversity in the dataset and previous work 43 , entropy values greater than 0.7 were considered highly variable for the nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments. The ORF1 and S genes had the highest number of nucleotides with entropy levels above 0.7 (n = 20 and n = 12, respectively) while the ORF3b, E and, ORF7 genes lacked diversity in nucleotide positions (Fig. 3A ). Within ORF1, the NSP2 and NSP3 had the highest number of nucleotide positions with entropy values greater than 0.7 (n = 4 and n = 6, respectively) while a single position was identified in NSP4, NSP6, NSP8, NSP12, NSP14, and NSP15. Within the amino acid alignment, the M, N and ORF7 genes lacked positions with entropy levels above 0.7 while ORF1 and S proteins (n = 10 and n = 9, respectively) had residues with entropy values higher than 0.7 (Fig. 3 ). There were 7 high-entropy positions at ORF1b www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ gene in the nucleotide sequence entropy value analysis while entropy value higher than 0.7 were lacking in the amino acid sequence entropy value analysis. Recombination analysis was performed with the 37 TGEV and 3 PRCV strains. A single recombination event was detected by Chimera, BootScan, MaxChi, and SiScan and RDP within the dataset between the recently identified variant TGEV strains and the novel PRCV strain Minnesota155/2016 (Fig. 4) . The TGEV variant Oklahoma147/2012 shares a high nucleotide identity of the first 19,941 nucleotides (breakpoint) with PRCV strain Minnesota155/2016 while the remainder of the genome shares a high nucleotide identity with TGEV strain Minnesota141/2007, indicating a complex nucleotide relationship between PRCV and TGEV. Phylogenetic analyses of TGEV and PRCV strains. Phylogenetic trees of complete genome sequence (n = 40) and complete S gene (n = 56) revealed two distinct genotypes, representing the traditional and variant TGEV strains from the US (Fig. 5A,B, respectively) . In the complete genome and S gene phylogenetic trees, the traditional genotype contained historical strains from the US, the recent strain from Mexico, and historical and recent strains from China. From our study, the 16 recent TGEV strains from the US formed the variant TGEV group, which share a common ancestor with the PRCV strain Ohio-OH7269/2014. Also, the variant TGEV strains were identified in the three main swine production regions of the US (Midwest, South-central, and Southeast) indicating substantial geographical distribution. Interestingly, whole genome phylogenetic analysis of PRCV strain Minnesota155/2016 clustered within the variant genotype and not with historical PRCV strains, indicating significant genetic diversity within PRCV strains circulating in the US. Since additional partial S gene sequences (first 1383 nt) were available from geographically different locations, a partial S gene phylogenetic tree was constructed to further investigate the global evolutionary relationship between TGEV and PRCV strains (Fig. 5C) . The traditional TGEV group consisted of TGEV strains isolated from the US, China, Japan, South Korea, England and Mexico. The variant TGEV group consisted our 16 US TGEV (Fig. 6A) . The different amino acid between traditional and variant TGEV strains were highlighted in the predicted crystal structure of RBD ( Fig. 6B-D) . Four of eight amino acid substitutions within the RBD (L626F, F628L, V642A, and D649E) were exposed on the viral protein while two of the four amino acid changes in pAPN (D600E and T602A) were exposed on the viral protein ( Fig. 6B-D) .
