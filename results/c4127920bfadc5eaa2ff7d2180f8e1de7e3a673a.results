Following devastating losses suffered by U.S. commercial beekeeping operations in 2006-2007, we initiated a prospective study monitoring a typically managed, large-scale (.70,000 hives), migratory commercial beekeeping operation over 10-months. Honey bees from 20 colonies were consistently sampled beginning with the introduction of a new queen in April 2009 (Mississippi (MS), through transport to summer foraging grounds in South Dakota (SD), and transfer to California (CA) for almond pollination (Figure 1 ). During our study, these colonies were exposed to antimicrobial treatments, transportation stress, different pollen and nectar sources, and three distinct geographic locations: MS, SD, and CA, (U.S.A.). A molecular analysis pipeline consisting of custom microarray, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative PCR (qPCR) and ultra deep sequencing was employed to characterize the honey bee microbial flora. Pathogen screening was performed using the ''Arthropod Pathogen Microarray'' (APM) built on the same design principles used for human pathogen microarray screening [44, 45] . The array's design couples highly-conserved nucleic acid targets with hybridization-based detection to identify previously uncharacterized organisms [46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51] . Specifically, the APM was designed to detect virtually all known microbial parasites of insects. Endpoint PCR provided sensitive detection while qPCR documented abundance of select pathogens. Ultra deep sequencing facilitated the discovery of novel and highly divergent microbes. Together the results from our monitoring study provide insight regarding the incidence of virus and microbe infections in honey bee colonies.
