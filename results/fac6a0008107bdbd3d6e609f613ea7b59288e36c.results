A search of the KNHIS database identified 59,584 patients with newly diagnosed ESRD during 2004-2013 (the dialysis cohort), and a corresponding number of individuals were selected for the control cohort. The individuals' characteristics are summarised in Table 1 . Individual matching resulted in comparable distributions of age, gender, household income, and comorbidities between the dialysis and control cohorts. The observation periods were 212,417 person-years in the dialysis cohort and 278,960 person-years in the control cohort. The mean durations of follow-up were 3.6 ± 2.7 years in the dialysis cohort and 4.7 ± 2.8 years in the control cohort. Newly diagnosed active TB was detected for 457 patients in the dialysis cohort (0.8%) and 125 individuals in the control cohort (0.2%) ( Table 2 ). The incidences were 215/100,000 personyears in the dialysis cohort and 45/100,000 person-years in the control cohort. Compared to the controls, the patients with ESRD had a significantly elevated risk of active TB (IRR, 4.80; 95% CI, 3.95-5.87). The subgroup analyses revealed similarly elevated risks of active TB among patients with ESRD for most subgroups, with the exception of the ≥ 80 years age group. The average interval from the initial enrolment to the diagnosis of active TB was 2.0 years (1.7 years for the dialysis cohort and 3.1 years for the control cohort). The cumulative active TB incidence was significantly higher in the dialysis cohort than in the control cohort (P < 0.001; log-rank test) (Fig. 2) , and subgroup analyses revealed similar results for both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis (both P < 0.001; log-rank test). However, there was no significant difference in the risk of active TB between the haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis subgroups (P = 0.67; log-rank test
