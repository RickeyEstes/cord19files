The length of the prepatent period in experimentally infected calves was 3 days in one animal, 4 days in seven animals and 5 days in two animals ( Table 1) . Onset of watery diarrhoea was observed in all infected animals at the beginning of the patent period. Faeces of most of these animals contained clumps of mucus, sometimes with blood visible by naked eye. This severe diarrhoea, in most animals followed by apathy and inappetence, lasted 2-5 days. Maximal counts of oocysts were observed between the 6th and 7th day p.i. Presence of blood in faecal samples, as determined with the guaiac test, was recorded in all infected animals in the acute stage of infection. On day 7 p.i. all C. parvum inoculated animals shed oocysts and had profuse watery diarrhoea. In contrast, on day 14 p.i. all faecal samples were free of C. parvum (Table 1 ) and the consistency of faeces in C. parvum inoculated animals was normal. No other enteropathogens were detected in any of the control Table 1 Intensity of infection in calves orally inoculated with 5 Â 10 5 Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts on day 0 The change in D-xylose concentration in plasma over time, as well as AUC 0-3.5 values, showed that the intestinal absorptive capacity in the infected animals was lower on days 7 and 14 p.i. in comparison with the control animals ( Figs. 1 and 2) . The results of the vitamin A test followed the same trend as observed with D-xylose (Figs. 3 and 4) . The indexes of intestinal permeability were significantly affected by the infection on days 7 and 14 p.i., whereas values recorded on day 21 p.i. suggest that intestinal permeability in the infected group had returned to a normal range as seen in the healthy controls ( Table 2 ). The infection strongly affected growth of the animals. Daily weight gain in C. parvum inoculated and control animals was 107 AE 49 versus 204 AE 55; À15 AE 187 versus 355 AE 28 and 111 AE 98 versus 395 AE 30 g during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd week of the experiment, respectively.
