Both linear peptides and tetra-branched, multiple antigenic peptide MAP27 bind to antibody specifically Both of the two linear peptides, SP27 (Biotin-SASPHHHSRLRSESGG) and SP27' (Biotin-SPHHHSRLRSESSAGG), contain the same core sequence SPHHHSRLRSES, flanked by 2-4 amino acids at N-and C-terminus ( Fig 1A) . The core sequence is derived from one of the positive phage clones we previously identified by using an anti-PGN mAb as the target [21] . As shown by ELISA, both SP27 and SP27' can bind to anti-PGN in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, a non-specific peptide L2 (Biotin-HSGHWDFRQWWQPSGG) did not bind to the anti-PGN mAb ( Fig 1B) . Moreover, neither SP27 nor SP27' could bind to an unrelated anti-Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) mAb ( Fig 1C) . These results indicate that the core sequence (SPHHHSRLRSES), but not the flanking amino acids (SA, GG in SP27, or SAGG in SP27') might mimic the epitope of PGN. Compared with a linear peptide, a multiple antigenic peptide (MAP) has more advantages: it is more stable upon enzymatic degradation; it has bigger size that is sufficient for immunization without crosslinking with any carrier protein; moreover, MAP enhances molecular recognition by immune cells and induces stronger immune responses [26, 27] . Therefore, MAP has been used as an immunogen for developing experimental vaccines against various pathogens [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Based on this fact, we synthesized a MAP, named MAP27 using standard Fmoc chemistry. MAP27 contains four copies of SP27, with C-terminus of each peptide linked with the non-immunogenic, lysine-based dendritic scaffold (Fig 1D) . The predicted molecular weight of MAP27 is 7137.7, big enough for immunization according to our previous work [21] . Compared with the attaching backbone (MAPctrl), MAP27 specifically bound to anti-PGN mAb ( Fig 1E) and anti-S. aureus polyclonal antibodies (Fig 1F) . These results indicate that a similar antibody-binding epitope as PGN was remained in MAP27. Last boost with heat-inactivated bacterium produced low titer antibody against S. aureus in MAP27-immunized mice We then evaluated the immunogenicity of MAP27. Serum samples from mice immunized with MAP27 or MAPctrl were used for binding assays by indirect ELISA. The titer of antibodies against MAP27 in MAP27-immunized mice reached to 10 4 after the third time of vaccination, whereas no detectable antibodies were produced in MAPctrl-immunized mice (Fig 2A) . We also found that serum from MAP27-immunized mice weakly reacted with PGN after the fifth MAP immunization (Fig 2B, at the 1/200 dilution) . In contrast, antibodies to S. aureus were not detected in the same samples (data not shown). As shown in previous studies, boosting with natural antigens after immunization with peptide could significantly enhance the immune response [33, 34] . Therefore, we boosted all of the three groups of mice with heat-inactivated S. aureus for only one time. Anti-S. aureus IgG from MAP27-immunized mice could be detected with a dilution of 1/200. Conversely, the serum samples from either MAPctrl-immunized mice (P = 0.016) or blank control mice (P = 0.002) produced no detectable antibodies (Fig 2C) . These results indicate that S. aureus boosting specifically augmented the immune responses triggered by MAP27 immunization.
