HERC5 inhibits HIV-1 particle production by an E3 ligase-independent mechanism The E3 ligase activity of HERC5 was previously shown to contribute to the inhibition of Pr55Gag particle production [1] . To examine the contribution of the RCC1-like domain to inhibition of infectious HIV-1 particle production, we generated flag-tagged HERC5 constructs lacking the RCC1-like domain (HERC5-ΔRLD) or lacking E3 ligase activity (HERC5-C994A) ( Figure 1A ). Cysteine 994 is essential for HERC5-induced ISGylation [18] . Quantitative Western blot analysis of cell lysates showed that all HERC5 constructs exhibited similar levels of intracellular protein expression ( Figure 1B) . The HERC5 constructs were also analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and found to be localized in the cytoplasm of U2OS cells, similar to wild type HERC5 ( Figure 1C ). Similar localization was observed in 293T and HeLa cells (data not shown). We then tested the ability of these HERC5 constructs to inhibit HIV-1 replication. 293 T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding full-length, replication-competent HIV-1 (pR9) and either empty vector, wild type HERC5, HERC5-ΔRLD or HERC5-C994A. Forty-eight hours after transfection, infectious virus released into the supernatant was measured using an infectious HIV-1 release assay ( Figure 1D ). The expression of HERC5 and HERC5-C994A significantly reduced the amount of infectious virus released into the supernatant compared to the control cells (P < 0.0001, student's paired t test). In contrast, HERC5-ΔRLD failed to inhibit infectious virus release compared to the control cells (P > 0.05, student's paired t test). Quantitative Western blot analysis of viral particles released into the supernatant and of producer cell lysates revealed that inhibition of HIV-1 particle production by HERC5 and HERC5-C994A resulted in a substantial reduction in total intracellular Gag protein and in HIV-1 particles released into the supernatant ( Figure 1E and F). Cells expressing HERC5-ΔRLD produced similar levels of intracellular Gag protein as the empty vector control cells; however, these cells did not exhibit a full rescue of released HIV-1 particles into the supernatant. Notably, HERC5-C994A inhibited infectious HIV-1 particle production significantly better than wild type HERC5and yielded substantially less intracellular Gag protein compared to wild type HERC5 and the control cells (P < 0.01, student's unpaired t test) ( Figure 1E and F). This enhanced activity correlated with the loss of slowly migrating species of HERC5 protein ( Figure 1G ). We used a standard ISGylation assay to determine if these slowly migrating forms of HERC5 represented ISGylated HERC5 protein [1] . To enhance detection of ISGylated species, wildtype HERC5 was expressed in the presence of the ISG15 conjugation system consisting of E1 activating enzyme Ube1L, E2 conjugating enzyme UbcH8 and ISG15. As shown in Figure 1H , slowly migrating forms of HERC5 were observed. When wildtype HERC5 was expressed in the presence of the ISG15-specific deconjugating enzyme Figure 1 HERC5 inhibits HIV-1 particle production via an E3 ligase-independent mechanism. A, Schematic of HERC5 domains and the various mutant constructs generated (not to scale). B, Western blot analysis of 293T cells transfected with either empty plasmid or a plasmid encoding flag-tagged HERC5, HERC5-C994A or HERC5-ΔRLD. Anti-flag was used to detect HERC5 and anti-β-actin was used as a loading control. Numbers above bands represent densitometric quantification relative to wildtype HERC5 after normalization to β-actin. C, U2OS cells were transfected as described in panel B. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were analyzed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-flag. Scale bars = 10 μm. D, 293T cells were co-transfected with pR9 and either empty plasmid, pHERC5, pHERC5-C994A, or pHERC5-ΔRLD. Forty-eight hours after transfection, infectious virions released into the supernatant were quantified using GHOST(3) indicator cells. The averages +/− SD from at least three independent experiments are shown. E, Forty-eight hours after 293T cells were transfected as described in panel D, virions released into the supernatant and Gag within cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-p24CA or anti-β-actin. F, Densitometric analysis of the indicated bands relative to the empty vector control from at least three independently generated experiments similar to that shown in panel E. Values were normalized to β-actin. ****P < 0.0001; **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05; n.s. P > 0.05 (student's paired t test). G, Western blot analysis of 293T cells co-transfected with pR9 and either empty plasmid, flag-tagged pHERC5 or pHERC5-C994A. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cell lysates were analyzed using anti-p24CA, anti-flag or anti-β-actin. H, Cells were co-transfected with pUbe1L, pUbcH8 and myc-tagged ISG15 and either empty vector, pUbp43, flag-tagged pHERC5 or pHERC5-C994A. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-flag or anti-β-actin. Data shown is representative of at least three independent experiments. Ubp43 [32] , substantially less slowly migrating forms of HERC5 were observed. Cells expressing HERC5-C994A, which is defective for ISGylation, also did not yield slowly migrating forms of ISGylated HERC5-C994A protein. These data indicate that the slowly migrating forms of HERC5 are modified with ISG15. Endogenously expressed HERC5 inhibits intracellular Gag protein production To assess whether endogenously-expressed HERC5 inhibits intracellular Gag protein expression from infectious HIV-1, we knocked down endogenous HERC5 RNA using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and examined the influence of reduced HERC5 expression on intracellular Gag protein production, compared with cells expressing scrambled shRNA. Western blot analysis of cell lysates from transfected 293T cells, before or after treatment with IFN-β, revealed that HERC5 shRNA-expressing cells exhibited substantially more intracellular Gag protein than cells expressing scrambled shRNA (Figure 2A and B). A similar effect was observed in primary human macrophages from two different donors ( Figure 2C ). Cells expressing HERC5 shRNA exhibited an average of 3.2-fold less HERC5 RNA than control cells expressing scrambled shRNA, as determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). As a control for specificity, we similarly measured the effect of the scrambled and HERC5 shRNA on HERC3 RNA levels and found them to be equivalent. Together, these data suggest that endogenously expressed HERC5 provides a significant barrier to intracellular Gag protein production with and without IFN pre-treatment.
