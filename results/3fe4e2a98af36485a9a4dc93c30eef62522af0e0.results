Forty patients, comprising 32 SFTS cases confirmed by RT-PCR and eight by ELISA were admitted from hilly areas of Northeastern China; six (15.0%) of whom died. The mean age of the patients was 55.7614.7 years (range, 18-89 years), and 11 (27.5%) were female (Table 1) . Fever, fatigue, anorexia, diarrhea, nausea and myalgia were the most frequent symptoms in all patients. The major clinical symptoms in critical cases were disturbance of consciousness, arrhythmias, pancreatitis, serious pneumonia, capillary leakage, hypotension and shock, in addition to fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. Hemorrhagic-feverlike symptoms were also observed in the patients. All the patients suffered fever during the course of the disease. The median interval between the onset of illness and the day in which serum samples were obtained at admission was 5.5 days (range, 1-10 days). The mean length of hospital stay was 9.765.2 days (range, 1-22 days). Six (15.0%) of 40 patients died of acute left ventricular failure, multiorgan dysfunction or aplastic anemia within 4-18 days of admission, while the remaining 34 patients (85.0%) survived. Nine (22.5%) of 40 patients met the criteria for severe disease. Pleural and pericardial effusions were observed in eight (20.0%) and three (7.5%) patients, respectively. There was a significant difference in the interval between onset and admission between severe and non-severe cases (median, 7.0 vs 5.0 days, respectively; p = 0.016) ( Table 2) ; however, age, sex ratio, duration of fever, and length of hospital stay were similar between the severe cases with SFTSV infection and those with non-severe infection (p.0.05). Apart from the patient who died from aplastic anemia, who had coexisting hypertension and coronary heart disease, the other patients with severe disease had no evidence of pre-existing comorbidity. All of the patients had thrombocytopenia, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Of the clinical laboratory parameters tested, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine phosphokinase (CK) and LDH levels were significantly higher; platelet count, calcium and albumin levels were significantly lower in the patients with severe SFTSV infection, compared with those with non-severe infection ( Table 2) . Serum levels of TNF-a, TGF-b, IL-6, IP-10, IFN-c and RANTES on admission are shown in Table 3 , Figure 1 and Figure 2 . Levels of TNF-a, IL-6 and RANTES were significantly higher in patients, and levels of IFN-c were significantly lower in patients than those in healthy individuals. Levels in the patients with severe and non-severe SFTSV infection were compared. Median TNF-a levels were 43.3 pg/mL (range, 21.3-97.9 pg/ mL) and 26.4 pg/mL (range, 10.2-240.1 pg/mL) in the patients with severe and non-severe SFTSV infection, respectively, and the difference was significant (p = 0.020). Median IFN-c levels were 236.4 pg/mL (range, 105.0-2216.1 pg/mL) and 35.4 pg/mL (range, 0.3-1530.8 pg/mL) in the patients with severe and nonsevere SFTSV infection, respectively, and the difference was significant (p = 0.001). Median IP-10 levels were 369.7 pg/mL (range, 78.3-640.4 pg/mL) and 209.9 pg/mL (range, 60.9-361.5 pg/mL) in the patients with severe and non-severe SFTSV infection, respectively, and the difference was significant (p = 0.024). Levels of IP-10 in patients with pneumonia (n = 20) were significantly higher than those in patients without pneumonia (n = 20) (p = 0.024). There were no significant differences in IL-6, Range
