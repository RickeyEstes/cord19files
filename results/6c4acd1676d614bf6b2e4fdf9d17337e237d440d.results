Details on the study population is given in Fig 1. Initially, the prevalence of respiratory health symptoms and allergies at baseline were compared between nonparticipants (N = 141) and participants (N = 436) ( Table 1) . Nonparticipants had a higher prevalence of current wheeze and nonspecific hyperreactivity, but for other health variables there were no significant differences between nonparticipants and participants. Nonparticipants were 3 years older (p = 0.001) and had worked 3 years longer at SAS (p = 0.02). When comparing work factors, nonparticipants reported less work satisfaction at baseline and less exposure to ETS at work, especially on short haul flights, as compared to participants ( Table 2 ). The prevalence of long haul flights during last 3 months was 25.9%. For home environment factors, there were no significant differences between nonparticipants and participant, but a tendency of more furry pet keeping among nonparticipants (p = 0.06) ( Table 3) . Moreover, the nonparticipants were on average older and had worked longer time with the airline company. Them mean age was 45 y (SD = 10) among nonparticipants and 42 y (SD = 8) among nonparticipants (p = 0.001). The number of years employed at the current airline company was 15 y (SD = 11) among nonparticipants and 12 y (SD = 8) among participants (p = 0.02). When comparing changes in prevalence of health factors between baseline and follow up, no significant net-changes were observed (Table 1) . However, most of the psychosocial work conditions had improved during the three year follow up period, except for the demand variable which was not changed ( Table 2 ). The pilots tended to move from multifamily houses to single-family houses and had less ETS and less furry pets at home during follow up (Table 3) . Further calculations of number of new cases and the 3-year incidence of the health variables are presented in Table 4 . At baseline, totally eleven pilots (2.5%) reported that they had ever had asthma (lifetime incidence) and six of them had the asthma diagnosed by a doctor before the study started. Six of the eleven persons with asthma at baseline (55%) reported that their first asthma attack occurred when they were 1-10 years old (childhood asthma). Two of the eleven pilots with asthma at baseline got his asthma diagnosed by a doctor during the follow up period and three other pilots without asthma at baseline got a new asthma diagnosis by a doctor during follow up (incidence cases).The prevalence of doctors' diagnosed asthma at baseline and during follow-up were 1.4% and 2.5% respectively and the incidence of doctors diagnosed asthma was 2.4 per 1000 personÁyears. Totally 5.3% were females. Prevalence of current smoking at baseline was 9.9%, and the prevalence of current smoking at follow-up was 8.4%. There were 10 new smokers and 16 pilots had been giving up smoking. In total, 17 pilots developed atopy during follow-up, and the incidence rate of atopy was 16.6 per 1000 personÁyears. The prevalence of exposure to personal, work and home environmental factors at baseline and follow-up were published in our previous study [4] . Table 5 presents the cross-sectional analysis for the baseline data. Women reported more nonspecific hyperreactivity (p = 0.013), while smokers reported more bronchitis (p = 0.027), but less nonspecific hyperreactivity (p = 0.033). Older pilots reported less airway infections (p = 0.004) and less atopy (p = 0.004). Pilots with atopy reported more nonspecific hyperreactivity (p = 0.026). Pilots who reported dampness/mould at home in last 12 months reported more asthma symptoms (p = 0.006) and more airway infections (0.013). Pilots who kept furry pets at home reported less atopy (p = 0.018). Psychosocial work conditions or ETS exposure in the aircraft at baseline were not significantly associated with any of the four investigated health variables. The longitudinal analysis is presented in Table 6 . Older pilots (p = 0.011) had a lower incidence of airway infections. The baseline exposure of window pane condensation (p = 0.015) were positively associated with the incidence of asthma symptoms. The variable of "ever had window pane condensation" (p = 0.030) either at baseline or during follow-up were included in the model for the incidence of asthma symptoms and change of exposures, and it was positively associated with the incidence of asthma symptoms. Pilots who changed type of flight during follow-up (p = 0.002), either from long-haul to short-haul or from short-haul to long-haul, had a higher incidence of airway infections than those who continued with the same type of flight. Pilots reporting low psychosocial support at work at baseline had lower incidence of atopy, though the significance level is on the border (p = 0.06). Pilots who reported lower control at work (p = 0.039) during follow-up had more onset of atopy. Pilots living in newer dwellings at baseline (p = 0.012) had a higher incidence of airway infections. ETS at home at baseline (p = 0.010) was positively associated with new onset of atopy. The variable of "ETS at home ever" either at baseline or during follow-up (p = 0.005) was positively associated with new onset of atopy. There was no association observed for incidence of bronchitis and nonspecific hyperreactivity. There were no association between ETS exposure in the aircraft at baseline and incidence of any of the four health variables.
