A strategy previously reported for production of MVA-CR19 virus at high cell densities in shake flasks (Vazquez-Ramirez et al. 2018 ) was transferred to a controlled stirred tank bioreactor with an ATF2 system for cell retention. The method transfer was investigated for production of MVA and influenza A virus.
