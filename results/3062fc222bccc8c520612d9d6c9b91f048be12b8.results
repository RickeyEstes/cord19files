SNUhES32 and H1 were cultured for up to 10 passages while maintaining the undifferentiated state using hAFCs as feeder cells. During these 10 passages, the cultured hESCs maintained their own properties. For hAFCs used as feeder cells, only the fibroblast types shown in Fig. 1 (A) were cultured and used. Both SNUhES32, which were established from human foreskin fibroblasts, and H1, which were established from MEFs, adapted well to hAFCs without complications, and round single layers, typical of hESC colonies, were observed ( Fig. 1B and C) . In this study, we attempted to replace materials that were generally used for hESC cultures with humanized materials in order to minimize exposure of hESCs to animal derived components during culture. Thus, hAFCs For characterization of SNUhES32 and H1 cultured on hAFCs, we tested that SNUhES32 and H1 at 8 passages, had AP activity, as determined using an AP staining kit. These data indicated that the undifferentiated state was maintained (Fig. 2f, i) . In addition, immunocytochemistry Oct-4 or SSEA-4 were detected between the two experimental groups, with positive responses of up to 100% (Fig. 3) .
