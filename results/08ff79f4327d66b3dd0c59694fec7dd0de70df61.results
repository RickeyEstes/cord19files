Morphometric Anal.vsis ofthe Proximal Alveolar Region Table 3 lists the body weights and lung volumes as well as the cumulative exposure concentrations of the groups of rats exposed for 13 weeks, 13 weeks plus recovery, 78 weeks, and 78 weeks plus recovery to air and 03.

An acute increase in tissue volume after 1 week of exposure (+32%) returned toward baseline at three weeks (+4%), and then entered a phase of progressive increase through 13 (+ 19%) and 78 weeks (+23%) of exposure. Many of the changes induced by the subchronic and chronic exposures were reversed when rats were placed in clean air. Epithelium and interstitium were the major compartments of the septal wall tissue involved in these reactions. Analysis of variance indicated that there was a significant pollutant (p < 0.01) and time (a < 0.01) effects in the volumes of epithelium and interstitium.
