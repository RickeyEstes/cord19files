Liposome therapy appears to result in enhanced tumor immunity in several species (Hart et al., 1981; Sone and Fidler, 1981; Key et al., 1982) . Because young swine develop costly episodes of pneumonia, we were interested in developing a protocol to activate porcine alveolar macrophages with the known biological response modifier MDP. In experiments done to establish baseline information on alveolar macrophages, alveolar macrophages from 12 individ-ual pigs were incubated with several concentrations of MDP for various time intervals. Activation was measured by assessing macrophage cytotoxicity of the tumor cell E8. The data in Table 1 illustrate that macrophages from 75% of the swine tested, were activated before culture in MDP. When freshly harvested porcine macrophages were cultured with tayget cells _+ MDP (for the length of the 18-h cytotoxicity assay), there was no significant difference in the amount of killing between macrophages incubated with or without MDP (See Fig. 1 for two representative animals) . If macrophages were incubated + MDP for 24 or 48 h before target cells were added, alveolar macrophage cytotoxicity diminished to 10 % or less (See Fig. 1 for two representative swine ). Neither 2 nor 20/~g/ml concentrations of MDP maintained macrophage cytotoxic activity better than incubation in culture medium alone. Interestingly, even macrophages that expressed very low levels of cytotoxicity when first harvested, also could not be stimulated to become more cytotoxic (data not shown). These data contrasted the results obtained with murine peritoneal macrophages which were tested simultaneously. The data in Fig. 2 show that freshly harvested murine peritoneal macrophages were not cytolytic in the absence of MDP. These data indicate that our culture conditions were not stimulating the alveolar macrophages to become cytotoxic. Furthermore, macro- phages incubated with target cells in the presence of MDP were cytotoxic for E8. Therefore, our MDP was biologically active. Fig. 2 shows that murine macrophages cultured for 24 h in media without MDP did not become cytotoxic. In contrast, they became cytotoxic when incubated in MDP. Only murine macrophages incubated for 48 h were not cytotoxic, even when incubated in MDP (Fig. 2) .
