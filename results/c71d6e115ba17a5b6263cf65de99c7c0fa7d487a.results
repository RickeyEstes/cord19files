From the 4,012 articles identified in the search, 2,547 were identified as duplicates and rejected, resulting in 1,465 articles which went forward for title and abstract screening (Figure) . A further 1,130 were rejected at this stage as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 335 articles were selected based on their title and abstract and read in full. From these, 223 were rejected: the majority (n = 87) did not contain airline data, 73 were deemed not relevant (did not contain at least two required criteria, such as airline data and model) and 20 used no model. An additional 19 were country-specific, 17 were inaccessible (no access to journal or language barrier), five were reviews and two were not focused on human disease movement. After reading the articles in full, 112 were selected as relevant to this review. Finally, 24 additional articles, not detected by the search but through reading the bibliography of accepted articles, were included after being read in full to determine relevance. The publication year of the 136 articles selected ranged from 1985 to 2017, with the largest number of articles (n = 17) published in 2016 (Table 2 ). In the 20 years following the publication by Rvachev and Longini in 1985, the oldest article relevant to this review, only seven relevant articles were published [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . A wide range of data sources have been used for modelling passenger flow between countries; in total 45 distinct sources were identified (Table 3) . Commercial or industry data sources were most often used (14 sources, used in 131 articles), followed by governmental data (14 sources, used in 30 articles). Of the commercial data sources, those most often acknowledged were from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) (61 articles) and OAG, an airline industry company specialising in data provision and analysis (38 articles). Some articles used the airline data directly, however, two articles [17, 20] used data from one or more articles (see Table 2 ) and therefore were also thought of as using industry data. Where a database was named from IATA or OAG sources, OAG MAX was the most common (5 articles). A range of other industry-orientated data sources were cited, including Diio (airline market information), Amadeus (travel reservations database), Feeyo (a Chinese flight scheduler) and OpenFlights.org (an open-access database of flight records contributed by members of the public). Four articles used passenger surveys such as TravelPac from the United Kingdom's (UK) Office for National Statistics (ONS), and nine articles used tourism surveys (Table 3 ). Eleven articles used information published by airports, and four other sources were reported (the social media site Twitter, two aircraft manufacturers and EuroStat). Most data sources contained information about origin and destination (n = 91, 67%) or passenger numbers (n = 73, 54%) ( Table 4 ). Data pertaining to direct flights only were used more often than data pertaining to full passenger itineraries: n=33 and n=27, respectively. Of the 62 studies using IATA as a data source, 15 used information of direct flight only [10, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] and of the 38 using OAG, 11 used information of direct flight only [2, 23, 24, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Finally, eight articles [21, 22, 24, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] indirectly used IATA data by using the online modelling tool GLEAMviz [47] , and two [10, 48] by using BioDisapora (now Bluedot.global [49] ). According to the set of standards we had established to determine an article's reproducibility (see Table 1 , part B), no article was considered fully reproducible. Eight (6%) articles were deemed partially reproducible (score of 3 or above), where some information regarding the description and use of passenger data was reported [13, [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . Of the 45 total data sources identified, 26 were open source, 11 were closed source, and 8 were not publicly available. The date range of the
