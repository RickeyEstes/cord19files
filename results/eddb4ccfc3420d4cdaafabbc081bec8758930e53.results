SosV-RBP Lacks Hemadsorption and Neuraminidase Activity. The RBPs of SosV and other pararubulaviruses exhibit the highest level of sequence conservation with the RBPs of orthorubulaviruses (e.g., MuV-RBP) (10), a group of viruses with HN activity (43) . Interestingly, while the RBP of SosV and other pararubulaviruses retain all seven residues of the sialidase catalytic site, which are conserved among the sialidase protein family more widely (35) (36) (37) (38) , the glycoproteins retain only the two C-terminal amino acids (Cys−Ser) of the hexapeptide motif known to be necessary for paramyxovirus RBP HN functionality (Fig. 1A) . The absence of these crucial residues has also been observed in other recently classified parabulaviruses, including Menangle virus (MenV), Teviot virus (TevPV), and Tioman virus (TioV), with experimental data confirming that sialic acid is not integral to infection of permissive cells (7, (44) (45) (46) . We performed hemadsorption (47) and neuraminidase activity (48) assays to assess whether the absence of the hexapeptide motif found in HN RBPs impairs the ability of SosV-RBP to bind and hydrolyze sialic acid. In line with previous studies, which demonstrate that disruption of this key motif in NDV-RBP compromises neuraminidase activity (40) , human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells presenting full-length SosV-RBP exhibited no detectable neuraminidase and minimal hemadsorption functionality ( Fig. 1B ) when compared to a WT NDV-RBP control. The absence of SosV RBP neuraminidase functionality, in respect to an NDV-HN control, was further confirmed by the Warren method (49) , where the concentration of free sialic acid was measured following incubation of SosV-RBP with the heavily sialylated protein, fetuin, which presents both α2,3-linked and α2,6-linked sialic acid ( Fig. 1C ) (50) (51) (52) (53) . To assess whether the introduction of the residues missing from the hexapeptide motif would enable SosV to interact with sialic acid, we compared the neuraminidase activity of a recombinantly engineered SosV-RBP (termed "eSosV-RBP") bearing the full hexapeptide motif "Asn−Arg−Lys−Ser−Cys−Ser" (Fig. 1A) with WT SosV-RBP and control NDV-RBP. Similar to WT SosV-RBP, eSosV-RBP was properly folded yet exhibited no neuraminidase activity with respect to the NDV-HN positive control and a mock-transfected negative control ( Fig. 1C and SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ), supportive of the hypothesis that the local environment surrounding the hexapeptide motif also plays a role in supporting HN functionality. The Structure of SosV-RBP Is Most Closely Related to Paramyxoviral HN Glycoproteins. We sought to assess whether the functional independence of SosV-RBP from paramyxoviral RBPs with known HN functionality was reflected at a structural level. A soluble construct of SosV-RBP was engineered to include a portion of the N-terminal stalk region (residues 125−157) and the receptor binding β-propeller domain (residues 158−582) ( Fig. 2A ). SosV-RBP was crystallized and the structure was determined to 2.50-Å resolution using the structure of MuV-RBP (PDB ID code 5B2C) (43) as a molecular replacement search model (SI Appendix, Table S1 ). Two near-identical molecules of SosV-RBP were observed in the asymmetric unit (root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] of 0.5 Å over 366 aligned Cα atoms). Residues ranging from 158 to 582 correspond to the canonical six-bladed β-propeller of the paramyxoviral attachment glycoprotein (25) , with each blade (β1 to β6) composed of four antiparallel β-strands ( Fig. 2A) . Residues in the N-terminal stalk region (residues 125−155) and loops β3L23 (344-373) and β5L01 (464-479) were disordered and directed toward solvent channels in the crystal ( Fig. 2A) , suggestive that they may be intrinsically flexible in the absence of neighboring RBP and fusion proteins, as presented on the virion surface. Consistent with the widely observed role of β-propeller-displayed N-linked glycans in protein folding, virulence, host immune evasion, and activation of host-cell fusion cascades (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) , the SosV-RBP β-propeller is highly glycosylated, encoding six N-linked glycosylation sequons (NXS/T, where X≠P). Electron density corresponding to N-acetylglucosamine moieties were observed at all predicted sequons (Asn201, Asn265, Asn340, Asn403, Asn416, and Asn455) ( Fig. 2A) , suggestive that these sites may be occupied on the native virion. Overlay analysis reveals that SosV-RBP shares the greatest level of structural conservation with orthoavula-, orthorubula-, and respirovirus HN RBPs (1.7−2.1 Å RMSD upon superposition of equivalent Cα atoms), when compared with proteinbinding morbilliviral H RBPs (3.1 Å RMSD upon overlay with measles virus RBP; MV-RBP) and henipaviral G RBPs (2.2−2.3 Å RMSD) (Fig. 2B) . The relatively close structural correspondence of the SosV-RBP β-propeller scaffold with other paramyxoviral RBPs with HN functionality is also reflected upon structure-based phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2C) (59, 60) . Indeed, in line with our previous investigations, which demonstrate that paramyxoviral RBPs structurally classify according to receptor usage (23, 61, 62) , the relatively close proximity of SosV-RBP to other RBPs with HN functionality, with respect to henipaviral and morbilliviral RBPs, may reflect that SosV-RBP only recently diverged from sialic acid-binding functionality. Unique Dimeric Assembly Supports Sialic Acid-Independent Functionality. Two molecules of SosV-RBP were observed in the asymmetric unit of the crystal and form a putative homodimer through the interaction of the first (β1) and sixth (β6) blades of the β-propeller (Fig. 3) . Although we cannot preclude the possibility of preferential crystallization, we note that the formation of such higher-order oligomers has precedent in other dimeric and tetrameric paramyxoviral RBP structures, including NDV-RBP (19, 36) , PIV3-RBP (63), PIV5-RBP (18, 20, 64) , HeV-RBP (22) , and MuV-RBP (43) . In addition, the formation of this putative homodimer does not occlude N-linked glycosylation, as expected and consistent with previous analysis of paramyxovirus RBPs (22) . The interaction between SosV-RBP protomers occludes (21) . Evolutionary distance matrices were calculated through pairwise superposition of RBP structures using SHP (60) , and the unrooted tree was plotted in PHYLIP (92) . RBPs are shown with surface representation. Relevant receptors are represented using ribbon (protein) or sphere (carbohydrate) (yellow). Known receptor binding sites are colored red on the glycoprotein surfaces. Calculated structure-based evolutionary distances are indicated beside the branches. (67) . Interface area (Å 2 ) and hydrogen-bonds (H-bonds) were calculated using the PISA server (65) . Each structure is annotated with receptor type, if known. Structures are shown in cartoon representation and monomers colored as a rainbow from the N terminus (blue) to the C terminus (red). (Fig. 3) . Interestingly, the interaction area in the SosV-RBP homodimer is less than that observed in NDV-RBP, PIV3-RBP, PIV5-RBP, and MuV-RBP structures (average of ∼1,790 Å), an observation that may be attributed to the absence of contributing contacts from blade one, strand four (β1S4) of the six-bladed β-propeller. Additionally, the angle of association between SosV-RBP protomers (31°) is substantially less than that observed in NDV-RBP (36), PIV3-RBP (63), PIV5-RBP (64) , and MuV-RBP (43) (average of 57°) structures. Deviations in association angle have been similarly observed in crystallographically observed HeV-RBP (40°) (22) and MV-RBP (66, 67) (117°) homodimers (Fig. 3) . These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the evolutionary departure of RBPs from sialic acid-binding functionality is accompanied by changes in protomer association angle and interface area to accommodate more bulky, often proteinous receptors (18, 22) . (36), localizes to a cavity at the top center of the β-propeller fold (Fig. 4A ). Structural and functional analyses have comprehensively detailed the conserved RBP−glycan interactions facilitated by the seven conserved sialidase residues and hexapeptide motifs, which are essential for HN activity (20, 35-38, 43, 63) . In addition to our hemadsorption and sialidase activity analysis (Fig. 1 B and C) , we collected crystallographic data on SosV-RBP crystals soaked with (3-sialyllactose, 30 mM) and cocrystallized in the presence of sialyllactose (3-and 6-sialyllactose, at a 5 times greater molar concentration than protein). However, consistent with our hemadsorption and neuraminidase activity assays ( Fig. 1 B and C) , we could find no evidence for glycan binding at the sialic acid cavity (38) , nor at the region equivalent to the secondary sialic acid binding site on NDV-RBP (41) . Examination of our unliganded SosV-RBP structure provides a molecular rationale for the absence of this interaction. Indeed, while the glycoprotein presents some features that are conserved with paramyxoviral RBPs with known HN functionality, including a conserved cation binding site (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ) (36, 63, 64, 68) and residues that would contribute to recognition of the glycerol moeity of sialic acid (Fig. 4 A and B) , the overall configuration of the putative active site is incompatible with known modes of sialic acid recognition. First, we observe that SosV-RBP hexapeptide residues Leu243 SosV-RBP and His245 SosV-RBP impede into the region where the O 4 of sialic acid is positioned in other paramyxovirus RBP−sialic acid complex structures (Fig. 4 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3) . Second, analysis of the electrostatics in the SosV-RBP cavity reveals dramatically different surface charge properties when compared to paramyxoviral RPBs with HN functionality, where the SosV-RBP presents an extended acidic patch, which is unlikely to be favorable for binding of sialylated glycoconjugates (Fig. 4C) . Third, the β5L23 loop in SosV-RBP, which encodes Arg514 (R 5 ) of the triarginyl motif, does not fold inward, as observed in other sialic acid-binding paramyxoviral RBPs, but peels outwards away from the toroidal axis of the β-propeller toward a small external cavity. This dramatic difference in loop conformation results in a ∼14-Å distance between the equivalent Cα atom of Arg 5 in SosV-RBP and the typical liganded and unliganded HN RBP (Fig. 4A and SI  Appendix, Fig. S4 ). We note that the equivalent region in the HN RBPs is structurally conserved and remains unchanged upon ligand recognition (20, 38, 43, 63) . Such a large local structural difference in the β-propeller fold may be, in part, attributed to the presence of a disulphide bond in SosV-RBP between residues Cys522 and Cys527 of β5S3 and β5S4 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 ), respectively, which is not present in other paramyxoviral RBPs with HN functionality, and may contribute to an open conformation of the β5L23 loop (Fig. 4A) . Combined, the dramatic overall structural and physicochemical differences observed between SosV-RBP and paramyxoviral RBPs with HN functionality is consistent with our hemadsorption and neuraminidase activity analysis (Fig. 1  B and C) , and provides a structural rationale for why the replacement of the hexapeptide motif alone does not result in SosV-RBP obtaining the capability to hydrolyze sialic acid (Fig. 1C ).
