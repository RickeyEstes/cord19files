Human IFITM1 inhibits the replication of HIV-1 BH10 but not HIV-1 We have previously shown that IFITM1, 2 and 3 inhibit the replication HIV-1 strain BH10 in SupT1 cells [10] . When we tested another HIV-1 strain called NL4-3, IFITM1 did not exhibit any inhibitory effect (Fig. 1A) , which was in contrast to the marked suppression of HIV-1 NL4-3 replication by IFITM2 and 3 (S1 Fig.) . This observation was further confirmed by the resistance of an HIV-1 NL4-3 -derived virus called NLENY1-IRES to IFITM1 (Fig. 1A) . Human IFITM1 has a relatively long C-terminal region than IFITM2 and 3. We previously showed that IFITM1 mutants lacking this C-terminal sequence still strongly inhibit HIV-1 BH10 (Fig. 1B and 1C ) [10] . Given the resistance of HIV-1 NL4-3 to the wild type human IFITM1, we expected that HIV-1 NL4-3 would also be refractory to the C-terminus truncated IFITM1. Surprisingly, IFITM1 mutants Δ(117-125), Δ(112-125) and Δ(108-125) all strongly inhibited HIV-1 NL4-3 replication ( Fig. 1B and 1C) . These data suggest that the C-terminal sequence of IFITM1 negatively modulates the anti-HIV-1 function of IFITM1. Deleting the C-terminal sequence of IFITM1 leads to inhibition of HIV-1 entry We have previously shown that, in contrast to IFITM2 and 3, human IFITM1 does not affect the entry of HIV-1 BH10 [10] . Similarly, no inhibitory effect of IFITM1 on HIV-1 NL4-3 entry was observed ( Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, the C-terminal truncated IFITM1 mutants, Δ(117-125), Δ(112-125) and Δ(108-125), diminished HIV-1 NL4-3 entry by 2 to 3-fold ( Fig. 2A and 2B) . This inhibition appears to be specific to HIV-1, since neither the WT IFITM1 nor its C-terminal truncations affected entry that was mediated by the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) ( Fig. 2A and 2B) . In order to understand how the C-terminal sequence of IFITM1 might regulate its ability to impair HIV-1 entry, we examined the cellular localizations of IFITM1 and its C-terminal deletion mutants by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. The wild type IFITM1 exhibited a predominant intracellular distribution and showed co-localization with the early endosome marker Rab5 (Fig. 3A) . Removing the last 9 or 14 amino acids from C-terminal sequence re-localized the majority of IFITM1 to the cell periphery (Fig. 3A) , indicating that these C-terminus truncated IFITM1 mutants are mostly positioned at the plasma membrane where HIV-1 entry occurs. It was also noteworthy that the Δ(18-125) deletion mutant exhibited an intracellular localization similar to the wild type IFITM1 (Fig. 3A ), yet Δ(18-125) markedly diminished HIV-1 entry (Fig. 2 ). This suggests that the Δ(18-125) mutant may employ a distinct mechanism to deter HIV-1 entry. We next asked how the C-terminal sequence of IFITM1 modulates protein subcellular distribution. No apparent endocytic sorting signals are present within the sequence 117-QII-QEKRGY-125 of IFITM1, which was deleted in Δ(117-125). One possibility is that this sequence may serve as a retention signal to sequester IFITM1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi [26] . This hypothesis is refuted by the results showing that blocking endocytosis with the dynamin inhibitor dynasore caused relocation of IFITM1 to the plasma membrane, as opposed to a IFITM1-KDEL variant that had the ER retention signal KDEL inserted at the Cterminus and exhibited ER localization even in the presence of dynasore (Fig. 3B) . These data suggest that IFITM1 is an endocytic protein and that removal of its C-terminal sequence causes its relocation to the plasma membrane where it interferes with HIV-1 entry. Mouse IFITM1 diminishes HIV-1 entry IFITM1 orthologs from different species are highly conserved, except for mouse and rat IFITM1 that have shortened C-termini (Fig. 4A ). These two IFITM1 proteins are 19 and 16 amino acids shorter at their C-termini compared to the human IFITM1. This prompted us to test whether they would act like C-terminal truncations of human IFITM1 and inhibit HIV-1 deletion mutations are indicated. Both the wild type and mutated IFITM1 have a Flag tag attached to the N-terminus. Levels of the wild type and mutated IFITM1 in stably transduced SupT1 cells were examined by western blotting. An amount of 500 μg/ml doxycycline was used to induce IFITM1 expression. Levels of tubulin were probed as internal controls. (C) Replication of NL4-3 and BH10 in SupT1 cells stably expressing IFITM1 mutants Δ(117-125), Δ(112-125) or Δ(108-125). Virus production was determined by measuring levels of viral RT activity in culture supernatants. A representative result of three independent infections is shown. Fig. 4B show that mouse IFITM1 suppressed HIV-1 replication in SupT1 cells. Further, mouse IFITM1 markedly decreased the entry of HIV-1 but not the entry that was mediated by VSV G protein ( Fig. 4C and 4D ). These data further highlight the importance of the C-terminal sequence of IFITM1 in modulating its antiviral function and also suggest the greater antiviral potential of mouse IFITM1.
