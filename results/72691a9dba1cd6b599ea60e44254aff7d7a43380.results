Parotid cells from aged rats show a small decrease in general protein production compared to cells obtained from young adult animals. The incorporation of [~4C]leucine into CC13 COOH insoluble material was ~20°/0 lower (Table I) . These data are similar to results reported previously by Kim and colleagues [27, 28] . The incorporation of [3H]mannose into parotid gland protein, which over a 1-h time period represents assembly of N-linked oligosaccharides [16, 17] , was also reduced in cells from aged animals but to a greater extent than seen with leucine incorporation (~35%). The ratio of [3H]mannose/[~4C]leucine incorporation, a useful index of parotid N-linked glycosylation status [16] , was ~25% lower in cells from aged rats (Table I ). These data suggest the possible reduction of basal N-linked protein glycosylation in the aged rat. Earlier studies in our laboratory have shown that /3-adrenergic receptor stimulation of rat parotid cells can considerably enhance N-linked glycosylation of parotid glycoproteins [16, 17] . We also have reported that the fl-adrenergic receptor signal transduction coupling system is functionally intact in parotid cells from aged animals [20] . Accordingly, we next examined the ability of fl-adrenergic receptor stimulation to modulate N-linked glycosylation of parotid glycoproteins in aged cells. As can be seen in Table I , treatment of cells from both young adult and aged animals with the fl-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol resulted in a 2-fold enhancement of protein N-glycosylation (Table I , ratio of mannose/leucine incorporation). /3-Adrenergic receptor stimulation elicits a modest increase in protein production in these cells but a marked increase in N-linked glycosylation [16] . Although absolute levels of tracer incorporation are lower in aged cells, the proportional effects in the two groups are essentially identical. Thus the /3-adrenoreceptor stimulated response remains stable with age, much like /3-adrenoreceptor coupled protein exocytosis [20] . Only basal glycosylation was altered in aged rats. We next decided to more specifically evaluate basal N-linked protein glycosylation in parotid cells from aged rats. We chose to study the ability of microsomal membranes from these cells to synthesize mannosylphosphoryl dolichol, a key saccharide-lipid intermediate in the N-glycosylation pathway. Formation of this saccharide-lipid is catalyzed by the enzyme Man-P-Dol synthase and Blondal et al. [15] have reported reduced activity of this enzyme in aged fibroblasts. As can be seen in Table II , microsomal membranes from young adult parotid glands synthesize *2-fold more mannosylphosphoryl dolichol than comparable membranes from glands of aged rats. When incubations were performed in the presence of exogenous dolichol phosphate, a condition which will promote more saccharide-lipid formation [18] , membranes from both age groups showed increased synthesis of mannosylphosphoryl dolichol (~2-fold). Importantly, the proportional difference between young adult and aged samples remained the same (~2-fold) as seen with incubations without exogenously added dolichol phosphate. This suggests that any differences in saccharide-lipid formation seen with membranes from aged rats are not due to levels of endogenous dolichol phosphate, but are more likely related to the status of the enzyme Man-P-Dol synthase. Therefore, we directly examined kinetic characteristics of the enzyme in membranes from both age groups of animals. These results are shown in Table III . Enzyme activity in all membrane preparations followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics. No differences were detected in the K m for GDP-mannose of the enzyme between young adult and aged preparations. Conversely, a marked difference in the Vna × of the enzyme was seen. Membranes from young adult rats showed ~2-fold higher Vax for Man-P-Dol synthase compared to that seen with membranes from aged rats.
