A total of 288 patients under 5 years old with a probable diagnosis of B. ertussis were studied thouroughly for specific etiological identification. More than 80% of our study population were infants between 1 to 5 months old with a slightly higher number of males (56.3%). The group of infants between 29 days -2 months-old (27.4%) and the group between 3 and 5 months-old (27.4%) were the most predominant, closely followed by the group between 2 and 3 months-old (26.4%) (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). From our previous study, 118 cases of Bordetella pertussis were confirmed via PCR, leaving potentially 59% of samples without etiological identification. Thus, all 288 were analyzed for the presence of Influenza-A Table S1 -A). The identification of these infectious agents has made it possible to establish remarkably that coinfections were present at 58% (167/288) of patients. Thus, cases of infection due to a single infectious agent were 28.8% (80/288), and where the presence of ADV was 10.2% (25/80) and for B. pertussis was 9.8% (24/80), followed by M. pneumoniae with 6.1% (15/80). Furthermore, the prevalence of these infectious agents were accumulated in children under 5 months of age (Additional file 1: Table S1-B). As indicated above, in infected children (247 cases) coinfections stand out considerably (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). The coinfections found involve 2 to 6 different infectious agents, being the most frequent the coinfections of 2 agents with 39.6% (97/247) and those involving 3 agents with frequency of 23.2% (57/247). The most frequent association was the bacterial-viral coinfection, and the combination between Bordetella-ADV and Mycoplasma-ADV were the most common involvement reported with 12.2% (30/247) y 6.5% (16/247), respectively. However, the Bordetella-Mycoplasma association was very reduced (Additional file 2: Table S2 ), In addition, it is interesting to note that the associations in coinfections increase the frequency of infectious agents such as Chlamydia, Flu-B and RSV-A as observed in Additional file 1: Table S1 (compare 1A with 1B). Regarding vaccination status, 65.25% (77/118) of the positive cases were unvaccinated. However, the majority of these children (40/77) were under two months of age. An unknown vaccinated status was observed in 5.93% (7/118) of patients positive for B. pertussis. A marked decrease was observed in children who had received at least one dose of vaccination, with a prevalence of 18.64% (22/118) (Additional file 3: Table S3 ). In our population, the most common clinical symptoms registered at admission were vomiting (47.2%), whooping (46.5%) and shortness of breath (43.1%), followed by fever (35.4%) and cyanosis (28.8%). A wide spread distribution of symptoms distribution was observed when patients symptoms were individually assessed based on etiological group. Only 6 pathogens had symptoms that were present in more than 50% of each group. For example, vomiting was more commonly reported among children with Flu-A, RSV-A, Parainfluenza-1 and B. pertussis (Additional file 4: Table S4 -A). However, the difficulty in establishing clear clinical symptoms associated with infectious causal agents is due to the high frequency of coinfections. Therefore, Additional file 4: Table S4 -B has recorded the clinical symptoms of cases of infection with a single agent, and the association of these clinical symptoms are shown in Fig. 2 . Thus, a clear non-association can be observed between Mycoplasma and Flu-B, ADV or Bordetella; the same happens for Flu-B and Bordetella or ADV. This non-association means that the only infectious agent could be identified taking into account the clinical symptoms of the children as shown in Additional file 4: Table S4 -B. The most common complications were acute bronchial obstructive syndrome (ABOS) and pneumonia in 56.6 and 28.1% of our population respectively. ABOS was the most frequent complications among patients with positive samples for RSV-A, Flu-A, ADV, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and B. pertussis. (Additional file 5: Table S5 -A). However, when the complications of children affected by a single infectious agent are analyzed, it is clearly demonstrated that ABOS is also a complication of Flu-B. In addition, it is noteworthy that ABOS occurs in 61% (25/41) of the negative cases (Additional file 5: Table S5-B) . Finally, a seasonal distribution was described for each specific microorganism. Positive samples for ADV and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were observed across the whole study period. On the contrary, most of the B. pertussis cases were detected from May 2011 to March 2012. RSV-A and Chlamydia were mostly detected from March to May 2010; however, the same distribution was not observed in the following year (Fig. 3 ).
