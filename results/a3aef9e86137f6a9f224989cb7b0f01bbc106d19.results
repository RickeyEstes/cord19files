Karyotyping and FISH from leukemic cells displayed extensive and varied forms of genomic anomalies involving chromosomes 3, 7, 11, 13, 14, 18, and 19 (Fig. 2) . Of these abnormalities, involvement of 7q, 13q, 14q, and i (18) has been indicated to be specific for T-cell leukemias/lymphomas including ATLL. In the sideline karyotypes further anomalies such as abnormalities of 3q, 7p, 12p, 14q, 17q, abnormality of chromosome 19 were observed indicating these anomalies may be additional changes reflecting disease evolution. In the peripheral blood cultures only 3 normal metaphases were detected and the remaining metaphases displayed multiple numerical anomalies such as monosomy 13 and additional 18, hypotetraploidy as well as multiple structural anomalies. Among them, chromosome 3, 7q and 11q abnormalities, del(14)(q11q13), an additional isochromosome 18 and monosomy 13 were observed in the majority of examined metaphases. Bone marrow studies revealed similar cytogenetic pattern, however the proportion of normal metaphases was higher than in the peripheral blood sample (10 normal metaphases out of 20 examined were found) ( Table 1) . Applying the LSI IGH/BCL2 probe on PB interphase cells we detected in 80% of cells 2 signals for the IGH gene without IGH/BCL2 rearrangement and 4 signals for the BCL2 gene indicating the presence of 4 copies of 18q in 80% of cell confirming the formation of an extra isochromosome 18(q) in 80% of cells (Fig. 3A) . Applying the LSI Rb probe on PB interphase cells we detected in 40% of cells only 1 signal for Rb gene indicating the loss of Rb gene from 40% of cells indicative of monosomy 13 and confirming the karyotyping result. 7q and 11q rearrangements were confirmed with the LSI 7p/7q and MLL probe ( Fig. 3B and C) . Hybridization with LSI MLL gene revealed normal signal pattern indicating that MLL is not rearranged but 11q is involved in chromosome rearrangement resulting in a der(11) chromosome. The green signal of the rearranged chromosome 7 hybridizing to 7p10 appeared double sized compared with the signal on normal chromosome 7 (Fig. 3D ).
