From January 2010 through December 2012 we enrolled 785 children <5 years of age hospitalized with SARI into the influenza surveillance program, of which 742 (94 %) tested negative for influenza virus. Of these, 160 (21 %) were randomly selected for our study. The age, sex and symptom duration distribution did not differ significantly among selected and non-selected children (including those that tested positive for influenza). However, among the selected group there was a significantly lower proportion of specimens collected during the cold season, when the majority of influenza-positive cases were detected and excluded from randomization (Table 1) . Among the selected children, 56 % (90/160) were <1 year of age (median age among children age <5 years: 9 months), 46 % (73/160) were female and 78 % (125/ 160) had a duration of symptoms ≤3 days. Most patients presented with a recorded temperature >38°C (58 %; 93/160), cough (96 %; 155/160), dyspnea (69 %; 111/160) and chest indrawing (76 %; 122/160). Few patients presented with tachypnea or had difficulty in breastfeeding (15 %; 25/160). Overall, 138/160 (86 %) of children included in the study tested positive for at least one pathogen (viral or bacterial). At least one respiratory virus was detected in 126/160 (78 %) samples and at least one bacterium was detected in 102/160 (64 %) samples. Among the 138 samples positive for any pathogen, 22 (16 %) were positive for a single pathogen. Of these 8 (36 %) were positive for S. pneumoniae, 4 (18 %) for RSV and 4 (18 %) for RV, while HMPV, CV, PIV and Hib each accounted individually for <10 % of the single organisms detected (Fig. 1) . Among the 116 children in whom ≥2 organisms were detected, both viral and bacterial pathogens were detected in 90 samples (78 %). Among the 160 samples tested, RSV (n = 56; 35 %) was the most frequently detected virus, followed by RV (n = 47; 29 %) and PIV types 1-4 (n = 39; 24 %) ( Table 2) . CV, HMPV, HBV, EV and AV were detected individually in <15 % of the specimens. No PV was detected in our study. Of the 20 samples that tested positive for CV, 13 (65 %) were type OC43, 9 (45 %) were type 229E, 6 (30 %) were type NL63 and 4 (20 %) were type HKU1. Of the 39 samples that tested positive for PIV, 9 (23 %) were type 1, 3 (8 %) were type 2, 31 (79 %) were type 3 and 21 (53 %) were type 4. Even though we selected Co-detections with different subtypes were detected in 6 (30 %) and 20 (51 %) of the CV and PIV positive cases, respectively. RSV, PIV and HMPV were detected more frequently in infants <1 year of age compared to children 1-4 years of age (Table 2) . RSV, PIV and HMPV were detected more frequently during the hot season (October to mid-December); while RV and HBV were detected more frequently during the rainy season (June to September). The other viruses were detected with similar frequencies across seasons (Table 2) . Among the 160 samples tested, S. pneumoniae (n = 90; 56 %) was the most frequently detected bacteria, followed by Hib (n = 20; 12 %), S. aureus (n = 18; 11 %) and C. pneumoniae (n = 4; 2.5 %) ( Table 3) . M. pneumoniae was not detected in our study.
