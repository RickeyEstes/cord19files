When viewed as a set, the singleplex assay detected virus in 100% of the extracts, in comparison to only 33% of samples using the nested assays. Both outperformed the control-nested assay Lu.et.UL30, which detected viral sequences in only 17% of the cases as shown in Table 2 and in detail per each DNA extract in supplementary Table S1 . The detection sensitivity for CFPHV DNA varies considerably by PCR assay. Among the individual singleplex assays UL22 yielded positive results for 70.5% of the samples, UL27 for 57.6% and UL18 for 43.9% (Table 2 ). All singleplex primer sets outperform nested PCR assays, with nested UL22 being the highest in viral detection (28%). Moreover, there were only three positive viral samples that were detected uniquely positive by only one nested and singleplex primer sets. All other nested positive detections were confirmed simultaneously by at least two of the singleplex primers (Table S1 ).
