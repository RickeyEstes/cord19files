In order to develop an activity assay that is more specific for caspase-6 than available methods relying on the cleavage of the VEID peptide, we decided to investigate the cleavage of known caspase-6 substrates. To be useful for the measurement of caspase-6 activity, a substrate would ideally be as specific as possible. In particular it should not be cleaved by other proteases activated during apoptosis and be cut by caspase-6 in detectable quantities. The protein substrate should be easy to purify and thus available in larger amounts, and existing neo-epitope antibodies allowing for the specific detection of the cleavage fragment would be an advantage. The nuclear lamin proteins were among the first caspase-6 substrates characterized [25] , and knockdown studies strongly suggest that their cleavage during apoptosis is highly dependent on the presence of caspase-6 [24] . Furthermore, purified lamin A as well as a variety of neo-epitope antibodies against the cleavage fragments are readily available, and high stability of the cleavage fragments without further degradation during the apoptotic process has been described [26] , which should facilitate their detection. The VEID peptide sequence commonly used in caspase-6 substrates and inhibitors is derived from the lamin cleavage site, but since protein context is known to change the kinetics and specificity of proteolytic events, we decided to compare the cleavage of the VEID peptide to that of the full-length lamin A protein. The lamin A protein is a more specific substrate than its VEID peptide We therefore decided to investigate whether lamin A is a specific substrate for caspase-6. In particular, we were interested in the ability of other executioner caspases to cleave lamin A, since these are likely to show high activity in apoptotic extracts where accurate quantification of caspase-6 activity will be of interest. We first subjected the Ac-VEID-AFC substrate to digestion by caspases -3, -6 and -7, respectively. The amount of active enzyme used in each reaction was normalized to the concentration of active sites in the sample as determined by titration against the irreversible inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Fig. S1 ). As expected, the VEID peptide substrate, although it is best processed by caspase-6, still shows significant cleavage by caspase-3 and -7 (Fig. 1A ) at high substrate concentrations (100 mM). Lower substrate concentrations can be used to achieve greater specificity, however, the difference in kcat/Km for VEID is less than 3 fold between caspase -3 and -6 [4] . This results in a small concentration window that can be exploited to achieve selectivity for caspase-6, if the same amounts of active caspase-3 and -6 are present. However, this window will be lost if the sample contains a higher concentration of active caspase-3 than caspase-6. As shown in Figure 1B , an 8 fold molar excess of caspase-3 over caspase-6 is enough to lead to a significantly higher signal from the non-specific caspase-3, making VEID-based assays problematic for the use in apoptotic samples or other cell and tissue lysates with high levels of active caspase-3. Lamin A, on the other hand, only showed proteolytic processing when incubated with recombinant active caspase-6, not with the corresponding amounts of caspases -3 and -7 at concentrations up to 300 mM (Fig. 1C) . We therefore focussed on lamin A as a substrate for the development of a specific caspase-6 activity assay. To confirm the selectivity of lamin cleavage by caspase-6, we made use of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells generated from wild-type and caspase-62/2 (C6wt and C6ko) mice [27] . These cells only differ in their expression of caspase-6 ( Fig. 2A) , making them an ideal system to study the specificity of caspase-6 substrates. Apoptosis was induced by the addition of 50 nM staurosporine to the culture medium, and the activation of caspase-6 was monitored over time by assessing the cleavage of endogenous lamin A via Western blotting (Fig. 2B ) or with the Ac-VEID-AFC peptide substrate (Fig. 2F ). The antibody used to detect full length lamin A at 70 kDa cross-reacts with the closely related lamin C protein (60 kDa, [28] ), and the N-terminal fragments of both cleaved lamin A and C are detected at the same size of 28 kDa (Fig. 2B+E) . Furthermore, using a cell line that does not express caspase-3 but expresses caspase-6 ( Fig. 2C ), we found that the lamin proteins are still processed after the induction of apoptosis with camptothecin ( Fig. 2D ), confirming the requirement of caspase-6 but not caspase-3 for this process. An increase in VEID cleavage over time was observed for both C6wt and C6ko cell lines (Fig. 2F ). For C6wt cells, significant increases over baseline were observed at all time points, whereas the C6ko cells show lower VEID processing initially with a nonsignificant increase in the first 2 h of treatment. However, at later timepoints C6ko cells exhibit similar levels of VEID cleavage as C6wt with a highly significant increase over non-treated controls (Fig. 2F) , suggesting that other proteases make up for a large proportion of the VEID cleavage activity in apoptotic extracts. These results indicate that the lamin protein substrates are much more specific for cleavage by caspase-6 than the VEID peptide. Development of an electrochemiluminescence-based ELISA method for the quantitative assessment of cleaved lamin A In order to accurately quantitate the amount of cleaved lamin A generated by caspase-6, we turned to an ELISA-based assay format using the MesoscaleH platform, which allows for a fast and sensitive detection with minimal background using electrochemi-luminescence [29] . To determine whether cleavage of lamin A is more sensitive than cleavage of the VEID peptide substrate in detecting low levels of active caspase-6, we incubated different concentrations of the enzyme in parallel either with Ac-VEID-AFC or purified lamin A protein and determined the amount of cleavage after 30 min by measuring the fluorescence in the sample (for Ac-VEID-AFC) or by subjecting the sample to an ELISA using the lamin A neo-epitope antibody (for lamin A cleavage). Comparison of the results showed that both assays perform at least equally well in detecting active caspase-6 concentrations down to 10 nM, with the lamin cleavage assay showing a linear concentration-response relationship down to the lowest caspase concentrations tested (Fig. 3A) . Signal-to-noise ratios were at or above 3 for the ELISA assay for as low as 10 nM caspase-6, whereas the signal-to-noise dropped below 3 for the VEID-based assay at this concentration (Fig. 3B ). Using a peptide inhibitor for caspase-6, VEID-CHO, both assays furthermore arrived at a similar IC 50 value (lamin-based ELISA: 64620 nM, VEID-based assay: 5666 nM), indicating that the ELISA method is suitable to assess the inhibition of caspase-6 by small molecules or peptides. Overall, our method shows a slight increase in sensitivity over commonly used VEID cleavage methods and is able to reliably detect caspase-6 concentrations down to 10 nM. Next, we wanted to assess whether the lamin cleavage assay shows higher specificity than the VEID-based system for caspase-6 over other proteases that are activated after induction of apoptosis. To this end, we tested lysates derived from staurosporine-stressed C6wt and C6ko MEFs with our newly developed ELISA and found a linear increase in signal over time in wt samples, whereas the signal from C6ko samples remained stable at background levels that were similar to the background seen in untreated C6wt (Fig. 3D ). This indicates that the amount of intracellularly cleaved, Figure 1 . The lamin A protein is a more specific substrate than its VEID peptide. A: 100 mM VEID-Afc was incubated with different amounts of caspase -3, -6 or -7 for 1 h at 37uC. Fluorescence generated by cleavage was monitored over time, and the initial, linear portion of the curve was used to calculate the reaction velocity. VEID is preferentially cleaved by caspase-6, but also cross-reacts with caspases -3 and -7 at higher concentrations. Error bars are the SEM of N$3 of 3 independent experiments. B: 5 mM VEID-Afc was incubated with 0.5 mM caspase-6 or different amounts of caspase-3 for 1 h at 37uC. The reaction velocity was calculated as in A. Even at this low concentration of VEID-Afc, the peptide substrate can be cleaved by caspase-3, and an 8 fold higher molar concentration of caspase-3 than caspase-6 results in a higher signal for VEID cleavage by caspase-3 than caspase-6. Error bars are the SEM of N = 3 independent experiments, statistical significance was assessed by 1-way ANOVA and posthoc Dunnett comparisons: *** p,0.0001. C: Pure lamin A protein was incubated with different amounts of caspase -3, -6 or -7 for 30 min at 37uC. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and both fragments of cleaved lamin A was detected by Western blotting with antibodies #2031 (full-length lamin A and N-terminal fragment) and #2032 (C-terminal fragment). No cleavage was observed with caspases -3 or -7, while caspase-6 generated lamin A fragments in a dose-dependent manner. A representative image of 3 independent experiments is shown. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0027680.g001 endogenous lamin A protein is a highly specific readout for the quantification of caspase-6 activated during staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Kinetic measurements of either Ac-VEID-AFC or lamin A cleavage by fluorescence or our newly developed ELISA allowed comparison of the kinetic parameters of caspase-6 for the two substrates. We find that the full-length lamin A protein has a more than 1000fold lower Km than its cleavage site peptide VEID (Table 1) . Although the kcat value is also decreased, the kcat/Km is still more than 10fold higher for lamin A (Table 1 ). This indicates that the binding between lamin A and caspase-6 is tighter, which might be mediated by domains outside the cleavage site. Such binding sites could also be responsible for the observed specificity of caspase-6 for the full-length protein substrate. The Km and kcat values for VEID are furthermore in good agreement with previously reported data [4] .
