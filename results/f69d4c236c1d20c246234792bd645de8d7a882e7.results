The anti-FcrR 2.462 recognizes an epitope of S expressed by vaccinia virus recombinants (2) infected with wt MHV-JHM (lanes e, f, g, h, and i); (3) infected simultaneously with two recombinant viruses vTF3 and W-E2 (lanesj, k, I, m, and n); (4) infected with recombinant VVE2 only(lanes o, p, and q); (5) infected with wt vaccinia virus (lanes r, s, and t); or (6) infected with recombinant vTF3 only (lanes u, v, and w). Infection with vaccinia viruses was normalized for the overall m.o.i. Thus m.o.i. of 5 was used for infection with single virus (vTF3 or VV-E2) and m.o.i. of 2.5 was used for cells infected with these two recombinant viruses (vTF3 and W-E2). Construction of the recombinant vaccinia viruses is described under Materials and Methods. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared. Aliquots (10 ~1) of cell extract were immunoprecipitated with goat anti-S antibody (lanes a, h, i, j, o, r, and u), mouse anti-S monoclonal antibody 1.38.1 (lanes c, f, and m); mouse anti-S monoclonal antibody 1.43.2 (lanes b and g); the anti-FcyR 2.4G2 monoclonal antibody (lanes d, e. I, q, t, and w); goat anti-rat IgG (lanes k, p, s, and v); or goat anti-mouse IgG (lane n). lmmunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using an 8% gel. The molecular weight standards (kDa) are shown on the left margin. vaccinia virus, vTF3, which provides the T7 RNA polymerase needed to transcribe the S gene. Radioactively labeled cell lysates were prepared from uninfected DBT cells; MHV-JHM-infected DBT cells; DBTcells singly infected with wild-type vaccinia virus, W-E2, or vTF3; or DBT cells coinfected with VV-E2 and vTF3. In agreement with our previous results (Oleszak and Leibowitz, 1990 ) the anti-FcyR 2.4G2, two monoclonal antibodies specific for S (1.38.1 and 1.43.2) and a goat anti-S antibody immunoprecipitated a polypeptide of 180 kDa (Fig. 1) from MHV-JHM-infected DBT cells. This polypeptide was not immunoprecipitated from control, uninfected DBT cells (Fig. 1) . Cells simultaneously infected with vTF3 and W-E2 synthesized a 165-kDa polypeptide corresponding to recombinant S protein (Fig. 1) which was immunoprecipitated by goat anti-S antibody and by the anti-FcyR 2.462 monoclonal antibody. The recombinant protein precipitated by the anti-FcyR 2.4G2 monoclonal antibody had a mol wt identical to that precipitated by goat anti-S antibody. This recombinant S protein was 15 kDa smaller than wt MHV S protein (Fig. 1 , compare lanes j and I with lanes h and i). This difference in size has been noted previously and reflects a deletion in the S gene of the virus from which these clones were derived (Schmidt et a/., 1987; Parker et a/., 1989) . The 1.38.1 and 1.43.2 anti-S neutralizing monoclonal anti-bodies, which immunoprecipitated the 180 kDa wt MHV-JHM S protein (Fig. l) , did not recognize the recombinant vaccinia virus synthesized S protein ( Fig. 1 and data not shown). The inability of these anti-S monoclonal antibodies to recognize recombinant S may be due to deletions of certain epitopes in the recombinant S or due to conformational differences between wt and recombinant S which are a result of this deletion. Precipitation of recombinant S protein expressed by vaccinia virus was not via the secondary goat anti-rat IgG antibody. This antibody as well as goat anti-mouse IgG did not precipitate any protein of this size from DBT cells infected simultaneously with vTF3 and VV-E2 (Fig. 1 ). In addition these results demonstrate that irrelevant goat IgG does not immunoprecipitate recombinant S, in agreement with our previously published findings with wt MHV S. As expected, the 165-kDa polypeptide could not be detected by immunoprecipitation from lysates of cells infected either with recombinant vTF3 alone, with W-E2 alone, or with wt vaccinia virus (Fig. 1) . Recombinant 165 kDa S protein was also immunoprecipitated by a purified rabbit IgG specific for M. lysodeikticus (but not F(ab), fragments) and by an irrelevant rat monoclonal antibody specific for lung surfactant (data not shown). To demonstrate beyond any doubt that the FcR activity we observed in MHV-infected cells was mediated by abcdefghijkl FIG. 2. lmmunoprecipitation by the anti-FcrR 2.462 monoclonal antibody of MHV-S peplomer protein expressed in HeLa cells using recombinant vaccinia virus. HeLa cells were infected with recombinant vTF3 only (lanes a, b, and c), wt vaccinia virus (lanes d, e, and f), single recombinant W-E2 only (lanes g, h, and i), or simultaneously with both recombinant vaccinia viruses vTF3 and VV-E2 (lanes j, k, and I). Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared. Aliquots (10 pl) of cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with goat anti-S antibody (lanes a, d, g and j), goat antirat IgG (lanes b, e, h, and k), orwith the anti-FcrR 2.4G2 monoclonal antibody (lanes c, f, i and I). lmmunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using an 8% gel. S protein rather than mouse FcR associated with S, we infected cells of human (HeLa) and rabbit (RK-13) origin with recombinant viruses vTF3 and VV-E2 and immunoprecipitated cell lysates with goat anti-S antibody and the anti-FcyR 2.462 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2) . Goat anti-S antibody and anti-FcyR 2.4G2 monoclonal antibody immunoprecipitated a 165-kDa protein from both HeLa (Fig. 2) and RK-13 cells (data not shown) infected with recombinant vTF3 and VV-E2 viruses. Goat anti-rat IgG, which was employed as secondary antibody, did not immunoprecipitate any polypeptide chains from these cells. Goat anti-S and anti-FcyR 2.462 monoclonal antibody did not immunoprecipitate any polypeptides from cells infected separately either with vTF3 or W-E2 or wt vaccinia virus (Fig. 2) . Since the anti-FcyR 2.462 monoclonal antibody did not react with rabbit or human FcR, these results demonstrate that the site recognized by this antibody resided on the S peplomer protein.
