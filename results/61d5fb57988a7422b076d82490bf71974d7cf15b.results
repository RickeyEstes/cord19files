Demographic, clinical, microbiological and therapeutic characteristics of ALRIPS Among 2351 patients aged 15 years and above included in the surveillance project, 1831 cases with abnormal chest radiographs matched the ALRI definition ( Fig. 1 ). Among TB and ALRIPS patients, 20 had sequelae in association with TB and were excluded from analysis ( Fig. 1) . A total of 1800 patients were finally eligible: 426 ALRIPS (18%), 878 ALRIHL (37%) and 496 TB (n Z 21%). Demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients are summarized in Table 1 . Of the 426 ALRIPS cases, 47 (11%) reported current or previous tobacco use. More than a half (n Z 264, 62%) received treatment prior to admission; only 25 (6%) patients said they had taken antibiotics. While most (n Z 372, 87%) of the patients had a productive cough on admission, 68 (16%) had hemoptysis. Chest radiographs showed major sequelae in 367 (86%) patients. Eleven patients (3%) were severe on admission. In the three groups, blood cultures and sputum samples were obtained for 1649 (92%) and 890 (49%) patients, respectively. The main pathogens identified are presented in Table 2 . In the ALRIPS group, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 91 (83%) of the 109 positive sputum and one blood culture. Of the 51 H. influenzae strains with antibiotic susceptibility testing results, 23 (45%) produced a penicillinase, but all of those remained susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate. All the isolated strains of S. pneumoniae were susceptible to amoxicillin. P. aeruginosa presented no resistance, except to ciprofloxacine in two (13%) strains. Concurrent virus detection was noted in 15 (3.5%) patients. Four chest radiographs were highly suggestive of aspergilloma but fungal culture of sputum samples could not be performed. The first-line antibiotic prescribed in ALRIPS was penicillin A for 283 (66%) patients, in combination with aminoglycosides for 47 (11%). Only 33 (8%) patients received amoxicillin-clavulanate, which was not available at hospital pharmacies, and 15 (3.5%) ceftriaxone. Treatment was correctly adapted to subsequently available antibiotic susceptibility testing results for 198 (61%) patients, including 58% (30/52) of patients with H. influenzae, 74% (17/23) with S. pneumoniae, none (0/15) with P. aeruginosa, and 42% (5/12) with Klebsiella pneumoniae. The median duration of treatment was seven days (IQR 5e10 days). The median length of stay at hospital was ten days (IQR 7e14 days). In total, six (1%) patients died in hospital; 350 (82%) went home with or without medical discharge. According to experts' review, ALRIPS were recognized by local clinicians in 108 (25%) patients, while 56 (13%) were misdiagnosed as TB cases including 29 (52%) who were transferred to another hospital and 8 (9%) to another ward (mainly TB ward).
