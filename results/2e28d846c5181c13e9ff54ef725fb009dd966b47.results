During the 12-month study period, 82,388 women were screened. Of these, 9555 had criteria for severe maternal morbidity. Among these 9555 women, only 485 (5 %) had severe respiratory disease. However, in this group with respiratory illness, symptom severity progressed more rapidly, if compared to other causes of severe morbidity ( Fig. 1 ), such as bleeding or hypertensive disorders, and may be 40 times more lethal. Among the total number of women with respiratory disease, patients with suspected H1N1 influenza A virus infection had more severe disease (55.2 % MNM and 23.3 % MD) than those without suspected H1N1 influenza A virus (prevalence of MNM: 21.3 %, MD: 14.1 %) ( Fig. 1) . About 60 % of cases of suspected H1N1influenza A were tested. Women who tested positive (49 cases) for H1N1 had more severe disease, with a higher prevalence of SMO. Figure 2 shows the distribution of cases with severe respiratory disease, according to progression of severity during the study period, based on date of admission in participating centers. There was a higher incidence of cases in the first months considered, especially July, August and September 2009. National guidelines and availability of vaccination during pregnancy were instituted in March/2010. Considering health indicators, disease was more severe among cases tested and positive for H1N1 (Table 1) . Mortality rate was higher than 50 % among positive cases for A(H1N1)pdm09. The death rate was about 36 % in cases testing negative for H1N1 and 27.5 % in non-tested cases. In contrast, the mortality rate was only 7.4 % in morbid disorders due to other causes. The maternal near miss to mortality ratio was 0.93:1, 1.80:1 and 2.39:1, among positive, negative and non-tested groups for A(H1N1)pdm09, respectively, compared to a value of 12.43:1 for other causes of severe maternal morbidity. More than 55 % of patients with severe respiratory disease had three diagnostic criteria for near miss: laboratory, clinical and management, while for the remaining causes of severe maternal morbidity, around 24 % of patients only had criteria for laboratory or management diagnosis ( Table 2 ). All procedures for management of severity were associated with a worse outcome in both groups, women with severe respiratory disease and those with severe maternal morbidity due to other causes ( Table 3) . Analysis of sociodemographic and obstetric characteristics ( there was an association to SMO and non-white color, history of diabetes, low weight and substance abuse (use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol and illicit drugs), in addition to delay in care. In contrast, the group of cases due to other causes of morbidity, low maternal age, first pregnancy, history of maternal obesity and lack of a partner were identified as having lower association to SMO, while hospitalization in a non-public institution, parity, history of caesarian section, drug abuse, complication occurrence at an earlier gestational age and mainly in the postpartum period, in addition to any type of delay in obstetric care, were associated with SMO. Concerning characteristics of pregnancy and perinatal results (Table 5) , the group with severe respiratory disease had a higher rate of early preterm births, between 22 and 33 weeks of gestation, low birthweight (<2500 g), Apgar < 7 at five minutes of life, stillborn and the need for hospital admission/transference of the newborn infant, compared to the group with severe maternal morbidity due to other causes. Neonatal death increased threefold in women with severe respiratory disease. A statistically significant difference was observed in the groups compared, when the mode of delivery and onset of labor were taken into consideration (p < 0.001). The number of women who did not undergo pregnancy resolution and remained pregnant during the severe morbid event was much higher in the respiratory disease group. Around 35 % were "still pregnant" compared to 5 % in the group with severe maternal morbidity due to other causes.
