From January 2008 to February 2014, a total of 2891 cases met a SARI surveillance case definition and all had swabbed samples tested for influenza by rtRT-PCR. Of these, 257 (9%) were positive for influenza. A total of 192 samples (7%) were positive for influenza A, and 65 samples (2%) were positive for influenza B. Of the 192 influenza A samples, 47% were subtyped as seasonal A/H3N2, 46% were subtyped as A/ H1N1pdm09, and 7% were subtyped as seasonal A/H1N1. No unsubtypeable influenza A specimens were identified. Four co-infections of influenza A and B were recorded as influenza A for analysis (two of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 and B and two of influenza A/H3N2 and B), and no other coinfections were detected. The age groups of SARI patients by viral influenza result are presented in Table 1 . Fifty-seven percent of influenza cases (146/257) were under 5 years of age. Influenza-positive patients were less likely than influenza-negative patients to be under 2 years of age (P < 0Á0001), and more likely to be within the age groups of 2-4, 5-14, 15-49, and 50-64 years (all P < 0Á05). The median age of influenza cases was 3 years (range 0-85, interquartile range 0-21) compared with 1 year (range 0-103, interquartile range 0-4) for non-influenza SARI cases. Males comprised 60% of patients with influenza-positive samples and 59% of patients with influenza-negative samples (P = 0Á92). Ten (4%) of those with influenza were admitted to an intensive care unit and eight (3%) died. Seven of eight (88%) influenza deaths were among children less than 5 years of age, all were among children less than 15 years of age, six (75%) were female, and four (50%) had a chronic medical condition. There were no significant differences between patients having influenza-positive and influenzanegative SARI specimens regarding preexisting chronic conditions (16% and 15%, respectively) and mortality (3% and 2%, respectively). Of 11 pregnant women with SARI, one (9%) had an influenza-positive specimen and zero died. Across all SARI cases, the median duration from symptom onset to hospitalization was 3 days (interquartile range 2-4 days). Of the 6 years of the study having available results for all 12 months, a nadir of influenza activity occurred in July and September in five of those years, more than any other month. July had the lowest influenza activity over the study period, with two influenza cases from 2008 to 2013. Consequently,
