Of 1,074 children (62.3% male) recruited, 43.6% (468/ 1,074) were >2-5 years old (Table 1 ). At least one virus was identified in 82.3% (884/1,074) of the patients, with single virus in 43.7% (469/1,074) and multiple viruses in 38.6% (415/1,074). hPeV was not detected. Compared with virusnegative patients, virus-positive patients were less likely to have fever (OR: 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5-1.0, p = 0.05). Patients with multiple viruses were more likely to have rhinorrhea than those with single virus (OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.9, p < 0.05, Table 1 ). hCoV (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.4) and PIV4 (OR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.0-2.4) were more prevalent in the >5 year age group than in the ≤5 year group (all p ≤ 0.05), while hBoV (OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.7) and RSV (OR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-1.0) were less frequently found in the >5 year group (all p < 0.05). Chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that cough was positively associated with HRV and RSV, and negatively with EV; rhinorrhea was positively associated with HRV, PIV3, and hBoV, and negatively with EV; fever was positively associated with EV, and negatively with HRV and PIV3; and nasal congestion was positively associated with RSV, and negatively with EV and hCoV (all p < 0.05, Table 2 ). Viruses detected alone or co-detected with other viruses are shown in Table 3 . The most frequently detected virus was EV (42.3%, 374/884), followed by HRV (39.9%, 353/884), and hCoV (17.5%, 155/884). EV and HRV were most commonly co-detected with other viruses (Table 3 ) and also the most commonly co-detected pair of viruses (23.1%, 96/415, see the distribution pattern of viruses in Additional file 2). Screening with HRV-v1 identified 298 cases co-positive for HRV and EV, and subsequent confirmation with HRV-v2 primers/3 probes [15] resulted in only 96 positive cases (32.2%, 96/298).
