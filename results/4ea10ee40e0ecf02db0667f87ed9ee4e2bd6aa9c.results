A cell-based model for screening TLR5 agonists targeting TLR5-mediated NF-κB pathway Following the cloning of human TLR5 gene into pcDNA3.1-V5/HisB (BamHI/ApaI site) (Fig. 1A and B) , the stable expression of pcDNA3.1-V5/HisB-hTLR5 was confirmed in HEK 293T cell by western blot analysis, indicating that the molecular weight of the expressed protein was 96 kD (Fig. 1C) . Twenty-four hours after transfection of pcDNA3.1-V5/HisB-hTLR5 and NF-κB-luciferase into HEK 293T cells, these cells were treated with flagellin ranging from 0.1 to 10 μg/ml for 6 h to examine hTLR5 gene activation. Our results showed that NF-κB-luciferase activity was significantly activated by flagellin, especially at concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 μg/ml (Fig. 1D) , indicating that a cell-based model was established with the potential for screening of TLR5 agonists targeting the TLR5-mediated NF-κB pathway. Our data demonstrated that the TLR5 receptor-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway was specifically activated with the positive TLR5 ligand of flagellin in a dose-dependent manner, and the cell-based system has potential application for screening of new TLR5 agonists that target the TLR5-mediated NF-κB pathway. Polyethylenimine (PEI) is a novel TLR5 agonist activating the hTLR5-mediated NF-κB pathway First, the cytotoxicity of PEI was assessed at concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 5 μmol/l by MTT assay. We found that there was no significant toxicity observed on HEK 293T cells as the concentrations of PEI were below 0.5 μmol/l ( Fig. 2A) . Then the above cell-based model was used to assess whether PEI is a novel TLR5 agonist that targets the hTLR5-mediated NF-κB pathway. Twenty-four hours after co-transfection of pcDNA3.1-V5/HisB-hTLR5 and NF-κB-luciferase into HEK 293T cells, these cells were treated with PEI at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 μmol/l or flagellin at a concentration of 1 µg/ml for 6 h. We found that TLR5 was significantly activated by PEI in a dose-dependent manner as luciferase activity of the downstream NF-κB reporter was increased just like the TLR5 agonist, flagellin (Fig. 2B) . These results suggested that, similar to flagellin, PEI is a novel agonist of TLR5 that activates the hTLR5-mediated NF-κB pathway.
