No cross-protection against M. haemofelis and earlier onset of infection in "Cand. M. turicensis"-recovered cats At the start of the study, the blood from all ten cats was PCR-negative for M. haemofelis and "Cand. M. turicensis". However, all cats became M. haemofelis PCRpositive after subcutaneous M. haemofelis exposure, and no cross-protection against M. haemofelis was observed in cats previously infected with "Cand. M. turicensis". "Cand. M. turicensis" was not detectable by qPCR analysis of the blood samples from any of the cats. The cats in group A became M. haemofelis PCR-positive between days 9 and 16 after exposure, while the naïve control cats in group B became PCR-positive between days 20 and 34 ( Figure 1 ). Thus, cats that had experienced "Cand. M. turicensis" infection became M. haemofelis PCR-positive significantly earlier than the naïve cats (p MWU = 0.008). The maximum M. haemofelis blood loads were similar in both groups and reached >10 9 copies/mL of blood. The cats in group A displayed fairly consistent high copy numbers (>10 7 copies/mL) starting between days 21 and 31, which persisted until days 49 to 56 after M. haemofelis exposure. High bacterial loads (>10 7 copies/mL) were observed later during infection and less consistently in cats in group B (starting between days 28 and 49 after exposure). Copy number fluctuations throughout the course of M. haemofelis infection were observed in all cats but were more pronounced in the cats in group B; the copy number fluctuations were particularly marked in cat ZKA2 in group B (up to a four-log fluctuation within four days; Figure 1G ). Clinical signs of hemoplasmosis in naïve and "Cand. M. turicensis"-recovered cats Two cats in group A (FIA1, FIA2) and three cats in group B (KCY2, ZKA2, JCT2) exhibited transient clinical signs of hemoplasmosis within the first nine weeks after subcutaneous exposure with M. haemofelis. The most severe outcome was observed in cat JCT2 in group B ( Figure 1I ); this cat was the last cat to become PCRpositive in the present study. The severe clinical signs, which necessitated antibiotic treatment, were described previously [19] ; briefly, the cat had an enlarged abdomen and exhibited pale mucous membranes, apathy, anorexia and increased salivation. The other four cats (cats FIA1, FIA2, KCY2 and ZKA2) were depressed and exhibited pale mucous membranes and a reduced appetite over a period of a few days, but no treatment was required. No significant deviations in body temperature or body weight were observed in any cat during the course of the experiment. Early development of macrocytic hypochromic anemia after M. haemofelis exposure in "Cand. M. turicensis"recovered cats All five cats in group A and four of five cats in group B developed anemia (hematocrit <33%) in the present study ( Figure 1 ). The cats in group A that previously had undergone "Cand. M. turicensis" infection displayed onset of anemia at 16 to 27 days post M. haemofelis exposure (6 to 13 days after PCR-positivity at times of maximal bacteremia in these cats), although one cat (FHT1) was previously slightly and transiently anemic with a minimum hematocrit of 30 on day 1 to 16 after exposure ( Figure 1C ). Interestingly, in the four of five naïve cats in group B that developed anemia, the onset of anemia occurred significantly later than in the cats in group A (34 to 62 days post M. haemofelis exposure; p MWU = 0.0159). The lowest single hematocrit value among all cats was 13% ( Figure 1I ). The cats in groups A and B exhibited significant differences over time in hematocrit (Additional file 2A; marked by an asterisk) and RBC (data not shown). The decreased red blood cell values coincided with maximal bacteremia. Overall, the hematocrit was significantly correlated with the M. haemofelis load (p S < 0.0001; r = −0.46, CI −0.55 to −0.36). The cats in group A also displayed significant differences over time in erythrocyte volume (MCV; Additional file 2B) and the hemoglobin concentration of the erythrocytes (MCHC; Additional file 2C). The altered erythrocyte indices (increased MCV; decreased MCHC) coincided with maximal bacteremia and anemia and were indicative of macrocytic hypochromic anemia. The erythrocyte indices returned to pre-exposure values more slowly than the hematocrit (data not shown). The cats in group B exhibited increased MCV and decreased MCHC similar to the cats in group A but at slightly later time points (Additional files 2E and F). None of the cats tested positive in Coombs' test at the time point tested (late after infection; >300 days after M. haemofelis exposure). Decreased leukocytes, lymphocytes and eosinophils and increased monocytes in "Cand. M. turicensis"-recovered cats at times of maximal M. haemofelis bacteremia The white blood cell (WBC) counts were not significantly different between groups A and B at day 0. Significant differences over time were observed in WBC counts in the cats in group A but not in the cats in group B (Figures 2A and E ; low WBC counts in A marked with an asterisk). However, all four anemic cats in group B exhibited leukopenia at several time points throughout the study. Neutropenia was observed in several cats in both groups throughout the experiment but occurred most frequently and more severely in cat JCT2, which had to be treated due to severe clinical outcomes (minimal neutrophil count: 1.0 × 10 3 /μL on day 105). Remarkably, the cats in group A had higher lymphocyte counts than the naïve cats in group B at the start of the experiment (days 0 to 6 and 9; p MWU = 0.0159; Figures 2B and F). Significant differences over time in lymphocyte counts were observed in group A ( Figure 2B ; decrease at maximal bacteremia, marked with an asterisk). Due to this decrease in lymphocyte counts in group A, there was no difference between the two groups from days 16 to 41 post exposure; thereafter, the cats in group A had higher lymphocyte counts than the cats in group B. In addition and parallel to the decrease in WBC and lymphocyte counts, a significant increase in monocyte counts ( Figure 2C ) and a decrease in eosinophil counts ( Figure 2D ) were observed in the cats in group A. In group B similar alterations but less pronounced were observed; these included increased monocytes ( Figure 2G ) and decreased eosinophils ( Figure 2H ). Early increase in T cells and decrease in several lymphocyte subsets at times of high bacteremia in M. haemofelis-exposed "Cand. M. turicensis"-recovered cats Although the cats in group A had higher total lymphocyte counts on day 0, no significant differences in lymphocyte subsets were observed at that time point (Figure 3) . However, the cats in group A had significantly higher T cell counts, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts, activated CD4+ T cell (CD4+CD25+) and B cell counts than the cats in group B at several time points throughout the study: T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ cells were higher in group A than in group B already within days after M. haemofelis exposure, while B cells were significantly higher in group A compared to group B later during the course of infection after maximal bacteremia ( Figure 3A , B, C and E; all differences marked by asterisks). Significant differences over time were observed in T cell counts in both groups with increased values in group A within days after M. haemofelis exposure ( Figure 3A ; marked by arrows). In addition, cats in group B exhibited significant differences over time in activated CD4+ T cell (CD4+CD25+) counts also within days after M. haemofelis exposure ( Figure 3E ; marked by arrows). Significantly decreased CD8+ T lymphocyte counts were observed in group A at the onset of maximal bacteremia (day 20) compared with later time points ( Figure 3C ; marked by arrows), while B cells were decreased at times of maximal bacteremia in group A (days 20 to 41) and rebounded thereafter ( Figure 3F ; marked by arrows). Finally, the CD4+/CD8+ ratio significantly fluctuated over time, but no clear pattern was recognized ( Figure 3D ). Serum proteome in "Cand. M. turicensis"-recovered cats: polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia at maximal bacteremia When comparing the two groups, the cats in group A had significantly higher protein, albumin and globulin concentrations than the cats in group B prior to M. haemofelis exposure (day 0, p MWU < 0.05; Figure 4A and Additional files 3A to C). The cats in group A exhibited a significant increase in total serum protein and globulin and a decrease in albumin particularly at 3 to 8 weeks after M. haemofelis exposure, consistent with maximal bacteremia in these cats (Additional files 3A to C). The cats in group B exhibited tendencies that were similar but less pronounced than those of group A (Additional files 3F to H). Globulin concentrations were significantly higher in group A than group B on days 23, 30 and 37, and the albumin concentration was lower on day 37 post exposure (p MWU < 0.05; Additional file 3). Serum protein electrophoresis prior to M. haemofelis exposure revealed that the cats in group A had significantly higher ɑ2-, βand ɣ-globulin values than the cats in group B (p MWU < 0.05; Figure 4B ). Significant differences over time were observed when all ten cats were analyzed in combination ( Figure 4C and D) . Albumin concentrations were significantly lower and ɣ-globulin concentrations significantly higher at the tested time points after M. haemofelis exposure compared to pre-exposure values ( Figure 4D ; Additional files 3B and G). Nine of the ten cats had ɣglobulin concentrations above the reference range (>16 g/ L) at days 44, 56/58 or 69 ( Figure 4D and data not shown). The albumin to globulin ratio was significantly decreased at all three tested time points after M. haemofelis exposure compared with pre-exposure values (p W ≤ 0.0137; data not shown). Moreover, on day 44 after M. haemofelis exposure, the β-globulin fraction was significantly higher compared with the preexposure values (P W ≤ 0.0091; data not shown). The electrophoretogram on day 44 post exposure indicated polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia ( Figure 4F ).
