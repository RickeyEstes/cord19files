In this study, the percentages of animals with antibodies against H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 SIV were 26Á23% and 1Á57%, respectively, considering the 3000 samples tested. The percentages of seropositive herds for both viruses were 96Á6% and 13Á2%, respectively. The HI results per area and virus are summarized in Table 1 . The number of pigs with anti-H1N1pdm09 antibodies varied between the farms. Serological profiles against this antigen in each studied area are shown in Figure 2 . One farm (F16) from area 3 had a higher mean antibody titer in the farrowing crate group than in breeding animals (female group) ( Figure 2 ). This situation also occurred at two farms from area 2. The serological profiles from areas 1, 3, and 4 followed a characterized pattern of antibody profiles in which the antibody titers were higher in the female group and decreased through 8-14 weeks of age when seroconversion by natural infection normally occurs. In contrast, the serological profiles from area 2 varied greatly, and in some farms, seroconversion occurred earlier (4-7 weeks) in the production system ( Figure 2 ). In addition, some farms had detectable antibody levels throughout all ages, and the means of the antibody titers did not reach negative values, suggesting that the virus had recently circulated in all groups at these farms. Furthermore, F10 showed relatively constant mean antibody titers throughout the production cycle, suggesting virus circulation in all categories. Additionally, one farm (F8) had no anti-H1N1pdm09 antibodies at all ages, suggesting that the H1N1pdm09 virus was not circulating in the herd at that moment. The percentage of antibodies in each category of the production cycle also varied between the farms and studied areas (Figure 3 ). At one farm (F30), only the females demonstrated anti-H1N1pdm09 antibodies, and all other categories were seronegative for this virus. Additionally, 28 of 30 farms (93Á3%) had at least one piglet from the farrowing crates cycle with at least low antibody titers against the pandemic virus. Grower and finisher pigs from 17 farms were all seronegative for H1N1pdm09. A total of 98Á33% of grower pigs in areas 1 and 3 were seronegative for H1N1pdm09 virus, and the percentage of seronegative animals in the finisher pig cycle was lower than that in the grower pig cycle for all studied areas. Overall, the percentage of pigs seronegative for H1N1pdm09 virus increased with age, and the highest values were observed in nursery pigs (areas 2 and 4) and grower pigs (areas 1 and 3) (Figure 3 ). Interestingly, one area 1 farm (F6) and two area 3 farms (F21 and F22) had respiratory outbreaks, with influenza virus confirmed as a primary causative agent, a few months prior to sample collection. At that time, clinical disease occurred mostly in nursery and grower pigs, thus corroborating our findings demonstrating susceptibility at these ages. Figure 4 shows the antibody distribution at all four farms with animals that were seropositive for H3N2 SIV virus. The most varied profile of antibodies against H3N2 SIV virus was observed at Farm 27 (area 4), at which the pigs showed low to medium antibody levels. Farms 7 (area 2) and 29 (area 4) had only two and one females, respectively, with anti-H3N2
