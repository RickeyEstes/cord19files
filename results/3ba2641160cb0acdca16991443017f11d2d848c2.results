Local immune responses to MVA Intranasal (i.n.) application of MVA vaccine can rapidly induce robust protection against lethal respiratory orthopoxvirus infections [41, 43] . However, the mechanisms of protective immunity still need to be elucidated. In particular, only limited information about local immune responses in the respiratory tract is available. Recent data suggest that in the vaccinated host MVA is recognized via multiple sensor pathways, which results in the activation of innate immunity, including the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) and chemokines. These innate responses will trigger attraction of immune cells to the site of immunization, which might be responsible for the rapid development of protective adaptive immunity [44] [45] [46] [47] . In agreement with these data, our histopathological analysis of C57BL/6 mice two days after i.n. inoculation with MVA revealed a marked peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltrate of leukocytes in the infected lung sections compared to lung sections of mock inoculations with PBS ( Figure S1 ). Histopathological inspection at higher magnification clearly showed neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages among the infiltrate ( Figure S2 ). We further characterized the infiltrated leukocytes by bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) at different time-points after i.n. administration of MVA. During the first 72 hours post infection (h p. i.) the infiltrates mainly consisted of monocytes, dendritic cells (DC), neutrophils, and NK cells ( Figure S3 ), suggesting that the lung environment is highly favorable for antigen presentation and induction of adaptive responses. Indeed, we were able to observe increasing amounts of T and B cells in the BAL fluids of MVA exposed animals at later time points of infection ( Figure 1 ). We detected CD4 and CD8 positive (+) T cells starting 48 h p. i., which increased in numbers to 20.5% (CD4+) and 41.5% (CD8+) of total BAL cells on day 6 p. i. ( Figure 1A ). To monitor VACV-specific CD8+ T cell responses we used the K b -restricted immunodominant determinant TSYKFESV from the VACV B8 protein being referred to as B8R [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [48] The immunodominance of B8R [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] has been shown to be conserved for various orthopoxviruses including ECTV and VACV, and even in mice lacking IFN-c or perforin [48, 49] . In MVA, the B8R open reading frame lacks some nucleotides compared to the B8R gene sequence of conventional VACV strain Lister/Elstree and encodes for a truncated B8 polypeptide. Importantly, MVA is expected to produce a fully conserved N-terminal part of the B8 protein containing the peptide epitope B8R 20-27 and very similar expression levels of this specific B8R product were found for MVA and conventional VACV strain Elstree ( Figure S4 ). When performing intracellular cytokine staining for interferon gamma (IFN-c) we found proportionally high numbers of activated VACV (B8R 20-27 epitope)-specific CD8+ T cells in BAL liquids by day 5 p. i., but comparatively lower numbers of VACV-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen. This pattern was also observed by day 7 p. i., with about three times higher numbers of specific CD8+ T cells in BAL than in the spleen ( Figure 1B ). When determining B220+ CD3-B cells in the BAL cell population we could detect the presence of substantial numbers of B cells at day 6 p. i. ( Figure 1C ). Additionally, we also monitored for the presence of MVA-specific
