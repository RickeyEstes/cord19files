Infection by PRCoV and SIV H3N2 or SIV H1N1 of PCLS and NPTr cells was analyzed to determine potential differences in mono-and coinfection. In every experiment uninfected PCLS were evenly analyzed, to eliminate potential contaminations of the animals or cells by PRCoV or SIV (data not shown). Contamination of swine PCLS led to complete exclusion of the data obtained by respective animals. The ciliary activity of PCLS was reduced due to the infection of the bronchi and their epithelial cell layer by PRCoV, SIV H3N2, SIV H1N1 and their co-infection groups. Mono-infected PCLS showed only slight reduction of the ciliary activity when infected by PRCoV (Figs. 2, 3) . However, a higher decrease in ciliary activity was found for SIV H3N2 as well as in all co-infection groups at all time points tested (Fig. 2) . Differences in ciliary activity reduction between mono-infection of PRCoV and co-infection with SIV H3N2 were visible already after 48 h (Fig. 2) . There was no measureable difference between the mono-infected slices by SIV H3N2 and the other co-infection groups. Comparison of PRCoV and SIV H1N1 showed similar differences of the coronavirus compared to all co-infection groups as were found for SIV H3N2 (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, the SIV H1N1 and the co-infection groups did not show any difference in reduced activity of the ciliated cells at any time point (Fig. 3) . This supported the tendency that PRCoV is able to induce ciliary activity reduction after 4 days, but on a much lower level than SIV H3N2 or SIV H1N1 and all co-infection groups. Whereas PRCoV infection after 72 h showed still round about 80% ciliary activity, mono-infection by SIV H3N2 or SIV H1N1 and all co-infection groups reduced the ciliary activity of the PCLS after 72 h by > 50% (Figs. 2, 3) . Supernatants of PCLS harvested 3 days post infection was analyzed by endpoint dilution on two different cell types. On NPTr cells monoinfection of PRCoV was compared to co-infection groups (Fig. 4) . NPTr cells were susceptible to PRCoV infection, but only low cytopathic effect were seen by SIV infection of NPTr. There were significant differences between mono-infection with PRCoV and co-infections of the slices, especially with SIV H3N2 (Fig. 4) . However, the titer of PRCoV was higher than the ones of co-infected slices. In co-infection only 1.PRCoV + 2.SIV H3N2 showed a significant higher titer than PRCoV + SIV H3N2 (p = 0.0108). All other combinations in co-infection with SIV H3N2 or SIV H1N1 did not reveal any significant differences between the titers of the PCLS supernatants (Fig. 4) . PRCoV is not able to invade MDCKII cells, therefore these cells were used for titration of the same PCLS supernatants (Fig. 5) . While excluding PRCoV titers from the analysis of co-infected PCLS, varying titer of the influenza viruses were measured. Virus in the PCLS supernatant at 3 days post infection showed no significant different amount of infectious SIV H3N2 or SIV H1N1 compared to any co-infection group (Fig. 5) . NPTr cells served as an additional model to analyze differences in mono-and co-infection by the coronavirus and SIVs. NPTr infection was done using an MOI of 1 and was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy 3 days post infection. Already fluorescence microscopy analysis of the mono-infection showed that SIV H3N2 was able to infect more cells than PRCoV (Fig. 6A/B) . Furthermore, less SIV H3N2 viral nucleoprotein was visible in cover slips co-infected by both viruses (Fig. 6D , E, F). Here, no obvious differences between co-infections were visible. Equal tendencies were shown by cells co-infected with SIV H1N1 (Fig. 7D , E, F). However, simultaneous infection of NPTr cells with PRCoV and SIV H1N1 indicated similar amounts of SIV H1N1 nucleoprotein compared to mono-infection (Fig. 7D) . Finally, NPTr cell supernatants were titrated to compare mono-and co-infection by PRCoV and SIV H3N2 or SIV H1N1 with the infection of PCLS at 3d post infection. Interestingly, also the supernatant of the NPTr cells showed a higher virus titer of cells infected solely by PRCoV compared to co-infections (Fig. 8) . This difference was significant for all co-infection groups with SIV H1N1 (Fig. 8) . In SIV H3N2 co-infection groups this difference in titer only was significant for PRCoV + SIV H3N2 compared to PRCoV mono-infection (Fig. 8) . Differences in virus titers between the groups of SIV H3N2 in NPTr cell co-infections were determined for 1.SIV H3N2 + 2.PRCoV vs. 1.PRCoV + 2.SIV H3N2 (p = 0.0051) and PRCoV + SIV H3N2 vs. 1.SIV H3N2 + 2.PRCoV (p = 0.0039). In contrast to this, co-infection groups of SIV H1N1 did not show any difference on NPTr cells. Additionally MDCKII cells were used to measure SIV titers. Here, SIV H3N2 mono-infection showed the highest measured titer of 5.56 Ã— 10 7 TCID 50 /mL compared to all coinfections as well as SIV H1N1 mono-infection (Fig. 9) . Cells infected by SIV H1N1 demonstrated again a significant higher virus titer compared to the corresponding co-infections (Fig. 9) . Only 1.SIV Fig. 4 .
