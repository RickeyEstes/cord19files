Comprehensive phylogeny of RNA virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases: overall structure of the tree and the 5 major branches. Amino acid sequences of RdRps and RTs were collected from the nonredundant National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database and analyzed using an iterative clustering-alignmentphylogeny procedure (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) (see Materials and Methods for details). This procedure ultimately yielded a single multiple alignment of the complete set of 4,617 virus RdRp sequences (see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material) and 1,028 RT sequences organized in 50 ϩ 2 clusters (50 clusters of RdRps and 2 clusters of RTs; see Materials and Methods for details). This sequence set did not include RdRps of members of the families Birnaviridae and Permutatetraviridae, distinct groups of RNA viruses that encompass a circular permutation within the RdRp Palm domain (46) and therefore could not be confidently included in the alignment over their entire lengths. The phylogenetic tree of RdRps and RTs ( Fig. 1 ; see also Data Set S2) was assembled from a set of trees that represent three hierarchical levels of relationships. At the lowest level, full complements of sequences from each cluster were used to construct clusterspecific trees. At the intermediate level, up to 15 representatives from each cluster were selected to elucidate supergroup-level phylogeny. At the highest level, up to 5 representatives from each cluster were taken to resolve global relationships (Data Set S3A and S4). The final tree (Data Set S2) was assembled by replacing the cluster representatives with the trees from the previous steps. The large number and immense diversity of the viruses included in our analysis create serious challenges for a systematic, phylogeny-based nomenclature of the identified evolutionary lineages of RNA viruses. Many such lineages consist of viruses newly discovered by metaviromics and are not yet formally classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and therefore cannot be assigned formal names. For the purpose of the present work, we adopted a semiarbitrary naming scheme using the following approach. (i) We use taxon names that had been fully accepted by the ICTV as of March 2018 (47) whenever possible. These names are recognizable through their capitalization and italicization and rank-specific suffixes (e.g., -virales for orders and -viridae for families). As is the common practice in virus taxonomy, the officially classified members of each ICTV-approved taxon are referred to via vernacular designations (recognizable through their lack of capitalization and italicization). For instance, the members of the ICTV-approved order Bunyavirales are called bunyaviruses, whereas those of the family Tombusviridae are called tombusviruses. However, in this work, both taxon and vernacular terms are to be understood sensu lato: if our analysis indicates certain viruses to be members of or very closely related to an ICTV-established taxon, we consider them members of that taxon despite the lack of current ICTV recognition. As a result, the order Bunyavirales has more members in our analysis than in the official taxonomy. (ii) We use vernacular names in quotation marks for viruses/lineages that are clearly distinct from those covered by the official ICTV framework. Whenever possible, we use names that circulate in the literature (e.g., "hepeliviruses," "statoviruses"). In the absence of such unofficial names, we name the lineage reminiscent of the next most closely related lineage (e.g., "levi-like viruses" are a clearly distinct sister group to Leviviridae/leviviruses). (iii) Monophyletic clusters that transcend the currently highest ICTV-accepted rank (i.e., order) are labeled according to terms circulating in the literature (i.e., "alphavirus supergroup," "flavivirus supergroup," and "picornavirus supergroup"). (iv) Lineages represented by a single virus are labeled with the respective virus name. Rooting the phylogenetic tree, generated using PhyML (48) , between the RTs and RdRps resulted in a well-resolved topology of RNA viruses in which the tree splits into 5 major branches, each including a substantial diversity of viruses (Fig. 1) . Branch 1 consists of leviviruses and their eukaryotic relatives, namely, "mitoviruses," "narnaviruses," and "ourmiaviruses" (the latter three terms are placed in quotation marks as our analysis contradicts the current ICTV framework, which classifies mitoviruses and narnaviruses as members of one family, Narnaviridae, and ourmiaviruses as members of a free-floating genus, Ourmiavirus). Branch 2 ("picornavirus supergroup") consists of a large assemblage of ϩRNA viruses of eukaryotes, in particular, those of the orders Picornavirales and Nidovirales; the families Caliciviridae, Potyviridae, Astroviridae, and Solemoviridae, a lineage of dsRNA viruses that includes partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses; and several other, smaller groups of ϩRNA and dsRNA viruses. Branch 3 consists of a distinct subset of ϩRNA viruses, including the "alphavirus supergroup" along with the "flavivirus supergroup," nodaviruses, and tombusviruses; the "statovirus," "wèivirus," "yànvirus," and "zhàovirus" groups; and several additional, smaller groups. Branch 4 consists of dsRNA viruses, including cystoviruses, reoviruses, and totiviruses and several additional families. Branch 5 consists of ϪRNA viruses. Each of these 5 major branches of the tree is strongly supported by bootstrap replications (Fig. 1 ). Assuming the RT rooting of the tree, branch 1, which consists of leviviruses and their relatives infecting eukaryotes, is a sister group to the rest of RNA viruses; this position is highly robust with respect to the choice of the phylogenetic method and parameters. This tree topology is compatible with the monophyly of the RdRps and, by inference, of RNA viruses and the origin of eukaryotic RNA viruses from a prokaryotic RNA virus ancestor shared with leviviruses. The deeper history remains murky. We have no information on the nature of the common ancestor of retroelements and RNA viruses, let alone on whether the ancestor was an RNA virus or a retroelement. However, parsimony considerations suggest that a retroelement ancestor is more likely given that capsids first appeared in the virus part of the tree rather than having been lost in retroelements. The next split in the tree occurs between branch 2 and the short stem that formally joins branches 3, 4, and 5. However, the unification of branch 3 with branches 4 and 5 is weakly supported and might not reflect actual common ancestry. Arguably, the most striking feature of the RNA virus tree topology is the paraphyly of ϩRNA viruses relative to dsRNA and ϪRNA viruses. Indeed, according to this phylogeny, ϪRNA viruses evolved from within dsRNA viruses, whereas dsRNA viruses are polyphyletic (Fig. 1 ). One major group of dsRNA viruses that includes partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses is firmly embedded within ϩRNA virus branch 2, whereas another, the members of a larger dsRNA virus group that includes cystoviruses, reoviruses, totiviruses, and viruses from several other families comprise a distinct branch, branch 4, which might be related to ϩRNA virus branch 3 (Fig. 1 ). This placement of the two branches of dsRNA viruses is conceptually compatible with the previous evolutionary scenarios of independent origins from ϩRNA viruses. However, the presence of a strongly supported branch combining 3 lineages of dsRNA viruses that infect both prokaryotes and eukaryotes suggests a lesser extent of polyphyly in the evolution of dsRNA viruses than originally proposed (15, 32) . An alternative phylogenetic analysis of the same RdRp alignment using RAxML yielded the same 5 main branches, albeit some with weak support (Data Set S3B). Furthermore, although the dsRNA viruses are split the same way using RAxML as in the PhyML tree, the nested tree topology, in which branch 4 (the bulk of dsRNA viruses) is lodged deep within ϩRNA viruses and branch 5 (ϪRNA viruses) is located inside branch 4, is not reproduced (Data Set S3B). Instead, branches 4 and 5 are separate and positioned deep in the tree, immediately above the split between branch 1 and the rest of the RdRps. Given the poor resolution of the RAxML tree and a strong biological argument, namely, the absence of identified ϪRNA viruses in prokaryotes or protists (with the exception of the "leishbuviruses" infecting kinetoplastids [49, 50] ; see also Discussion below), we believe that the tree topology presented in Fig. 1 carries more credence than that shown in Data Set S3B. Nevertheless, these discrepancies emphasize that utmost caution is due when biological interpretation of deep branching in trees of highly divergent proteins is attempted.
