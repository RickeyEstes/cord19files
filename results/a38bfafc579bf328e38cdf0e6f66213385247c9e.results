3.1. IL-2 and IL-10 synergistically increased the survival of activated, but not quiescent, CD8± T cells CD8 + T cell is considered the main effector cell in antitumor immune responses (Kilinc et al., 2009 ). Both IL-2 and IL-10 demonstrated anti-apoptotic function in CD8 + T cells (Liu et al., 2010; Oft, 2014) . We first found that breast cancer patients presented elevated serum IL-2 and IL-10 levels than healthy individuals (Fig. 1A) . To compare and contrast the roles of IL-2 and IL-10 on CD8 + T cell survival, CD4-depleted PBMCs from breast cancer individuals were unstimulated or stimulated through the T cell receptor (TCR) with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies, in the presence of no additional cytokine (None), additional IL-2 (+IL-2), additional IL-10 (+IL-10), or additional IL-2 and IL-10 (+IL-2 + IL-10). CD4 + T cells were depleted because they could secrete high amount of IL-2 and IL-10 and produce confounding results. The survival of CD8 + T Fig. 1 . IL-2 and/or IL-10 addition significantly improved the survival of TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells. (A) Serum IL-2 and IL-10 levels in age-matched healthy controls and breast cancer (BC) patients, measured with ELISA in triplicate experiments. The statistical differences between the healthy and the BC groups were examined by t-test with Welch's correction. (B) Non-apoptotic cells were gated as annexin V-negative cells in CD8 + T cells. Cells shown were gated as live CD3 + CD4 − CD8 + cells in TCR-stimulated sample. (C) The percentage of viable CD8 + T cells (annexin V-negative) after 24 h (black bar) or 72 h (gray bar) in unstimulated media or after TCR-stimulation (anti-CD3/CD28 at 3 g/mL each). The statistical difference between each experimental group and the corresponding None control group was examined using two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. Bars represent SEM. ns: not significant. **P < 0.01. ***P < 0.001. cells was then examined (Fig. 1B) . After short-term (24 h) incubation, no significant differences in the apoptosis level of CD8 + T cells among various treatment conditions were observed (Fig. 1C) . However, after longer-term (72 h) incubation, in TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells, the addition of either IL-2 or IL-10 had suppressed the level of apoptosis, compared to those with no additional cytokine (Fig. 1C) . When both IL-2 and IL-10 were added, the increase in the survival rate of TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells was higher than the increases in IL-2 alone and IL-10 alone combined. Interestingly, this effect was only observed in TCR-stimulated, but not unstimulated CD8 + T cells, as the viability in TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells presented lower viability than unstimulated CD8 + T cells when no additional cytokine was added (Fig. 1C) . 3.2. IL-2 and IL-10 synergistically increased the level of CD8± T cell cytotoxicity, likely due to improved proliferation of activated CD8± T cells Next, we examined the effect of IL-2 and IL-10 in CD8 + T cell-mediated cytotoxicity through chromium release assay. In short-term (24 h) TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells, no significant differences in cytotoxicity among None, + IL-2, + IL-10, and + IL-2 + IL-10 treatments were found ( Fig. 2A) . However, in long-term (72 h) TCRstimulated CD8 + T cells, the None group presented significantly reduced cytotoxicity compared to the short-term TCR-stimulated None group, whereas the +IL-2 and +IL-10 groups demonstrated comparable cytotoxicity with corresponding short-term groups (Fig. 2B) . The long-term +IL-2 + IL-10 group demonstrated significantly elevated cytotoxicity compared to the short-term +IL-2 + IL-10 group. To investigate the increase in long-term cytotoxicity in +IL-2 + IL-10 T cells, we examined the proliferation of TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells in various cytokine treatments (Fig. 3A) . IL-2 alone promoted the proliferation of TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells. While IL-10 alone did not significantly increase the proliferation of TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells, the IL-2 and IL-10 combined resulted in the highest frequency of dividing CD8 + T cells (Fig. 3B) . Indeed, the +IL-2 + IL-10 group contained the highest number of CD8 + T cells after 72 h of TCR-stimulation (Fig. 3C ).
