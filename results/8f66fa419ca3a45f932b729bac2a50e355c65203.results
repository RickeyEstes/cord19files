Bioinformatic analysis of the SARS-CoV S2 domain flanked by cysteine residues C822 and C833 A common feature of regions within a viral glycoprotein that are required for entry is that they show a high degree of conservation within a virus family. We therefore performed a multiple sequence alignment of the spike protein of representative coronaviruses, with a focus on the domain flanked by cysteine residues C822 and C833. This bioinformatic analysis confirmed a high degree of conservation in the region (Fig. 1) . Indeed, residues C822, D830, L831, and C833 of the SARS-CoV S represent some of the most conserved residues in that region and across the Coronaviridae.
