A total of 403 nonduplicate S. marcescens isolates were identified and tested for susceptibility during the 8-year study period of 2002e2010. Table 1 summarizes the source breakdown of the 403 isolates from each run of TSAR. Isolates were mostly recovered from respiratory samples (157 isolates, 39.0%), followed by the urinary tract (90, 22.3%), and blood (77, 19.1%). Most isolates (345, 85.6%) were from inpatients, including 93 (23.1%) from the intensive care unit (ICU) and 252 (62.5%) from non-ICU patients. Isolates from northern Taiwan comprised the largest proportion (154, 38.2%). Among the 390 isolates whose patient age was known, the mean age was 65.4 AE 20.5 years and 60.25% were from those aged !65 years. The in vitro susceptibilities, MIC 50 , MIC 90 (MIC at which 50% and 90% of isolates were inhibited), and MIC range of the isolates to various antimicrobial agents are shown in Table 2 . Overall, 99.3% of isolates were susceptible to imipenem, 93.8% to ceftazidime, 86.0% to piperacillin/ tazobactam, 72.7% to levofloxacin, 63.8% to ciprofloxacin, 60.8% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), and 59.6% to gentamicin according to the CLSI criteria. By contrast, susceptibility of 10% for each round of TSAR was observed for ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, and tetracycline. The MIC 50 and MIC 90 of tigecycline were 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL, respectively. The susceptibility rate of S. marcescens from different patient locations was compared (Table 3) . Isolates from the ICU had higher rates of nonsusceptibility than isolates from other locations for amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, and TMP/SMX, but the differences were not significant. The susceptibility rate to ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin was lower in northern Taiwan than other regions (p Z 0.025 and p Z 0.002, respectively). Fig. 1 illustrates the comparison of susceptibility rate for selected antibiotics from different specimen sources. We found that isolates from urine had the lowest susceptibility rate for the various antibiotics. Isolates from urine were significantly less susceptible than those from nonurine sources for amikacin ( a Others: one from ascites, one from joints, two from bile, four from ears, seven from catheter tips, four from eyes/conjunctiva/ corneas, one from urethra, and one from discharge. b Included six isolates from respiratory care center/respiratory care ward.
