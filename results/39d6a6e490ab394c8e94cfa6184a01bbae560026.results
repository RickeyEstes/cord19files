3.1. The nucleotide count of the RNA genome differs per coronavirus Table 1 lists the nucleotide count of the human coronavirus RNA genomes, ranked from highest C-count (MERS, 20.3%) to the lowest (HKU, 12.9%). We included 3 HKU isolates (1A, 1B, 1C) to demonstrate conservation of these nucleotide characteristics among virus isolates of a particular coronavirus. Strain-specific trends are also conserved for different isolates of the other coronaviruses (not shown). MERS and SARS, which represent two recent zoonotic transmissions into the human population, are both present on the same end of the spectrum. SARS is quite extreme with a C-count of 20.0% and in fact the lowest U-count of 30.7%. The highest count of 40.3% U is apparent for the 1B isolate of HKU. These numbers seem quite dramatic. For instance, the extremely biased HIV-1 RNA genome reaches a maximal A-count of 36.7% (van der Kuyl and Berkhout, 2012) . Some intriguing patterns become apparent by inspection of the nucleotide counts of the human coronaviruses. A few general coronavirus rules are observed. The first relates to the pyrimidines: the U-count is above average and the C-count is below average. The second rule applies to the purines and is less prominent, but A is preferred over G. There are also species-specific trends. In particular, the C/U ratio differs profoundly per coronavirus type, and these nucleotides seem to behave as communicating vessels. To illustrate that C and U seem to be competing for sequence space, we plotted the nucleotide composition per coronavirus (color coded) in Fig. 1 . This picture also nicely illustrates that most variation occurs in the C/U and not the A/G section. The A/G ratio is rather stable among different coronaviruses, with minor fluctuations in the Acount (ranging from 26.2% for MERS to 28.5% for SARS) and the G-count (ranging from 19.0% for HKU-1A to 21.7% for OC43). For the more detailed follow-up analyses, we selected the two extremes MERS (32.5% U) and HKU (the 1B isolate with 40.3% U, simply called HKU hereafter).
