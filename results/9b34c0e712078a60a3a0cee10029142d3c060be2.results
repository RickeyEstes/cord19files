The ELISA value was expressed as a percentage of the result obtained with a negative control serum calculated from net optical densities (optical density of positive antigen wells minus that of negative ones) . The threshold value for the test was established using 279 VNT negative (titre < 2) sera from 64 farms, all of which had no history of TGEV/ PRCV infection . Subtracting three standard deviations from the mean of these results (Savigny & Voller, 1980 ) gave a cut-off value of 50 .21% . VNT positive sera from field cases (n=167) and from pigs experimentally infected with TGEV or PRCV (n=35) all scored positive in ELISA (values : 1-49%) . Despite the good qualitative agreement between ELISA and VNT, no significant correlation was detected (coefficient=0 .072) between ELISA values and VNT titres for positive sera . Sera collected at abattoirs during 1989, from 231 sows, were examined by ELISA and 160 (69 .25%) were positive . A recent serological survey of British pigs by TGEV-specific ELISA indicated a seroprevalence of only 0 .6% (Brown & Paton, 1991) , suggesting that most TGEV/PRCV antibody positive samples reflect PRCV infection and that such infections remain common .
