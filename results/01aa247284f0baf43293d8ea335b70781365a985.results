According to Murray and Washington's grading system [9] , among the 48 sputum samples tested, 18 (37.5%) belonged to group 1, 6 (12.5%) belonged to group 3, 2 (4.2%) belonged to group 4, 5 (10.4%) belonged to group 5, and 17 (35.4%) belonged to group 6. Thirty-two samples (66.7%), including 20 from groups 1-3, harbored a detectable quantity of ciliated columnar epithelial cells. Seventeen samples (35.4%) harbored identifiable proteinaceous mucous threads (viewed via light microscopy). The efficacies of the three homogenization methods tested with NPA samples are summarized in Table 1 . For DNA respiratory viruses (such as adenovirus and human bocavirus), PK-DNase treatment caused a slight increase in Ct values compared with PBS or NALC treatment. When we additionally tested six adenovirus-positive NPAs and five bocavirus-positive NPAs, the Ct values obtained following PBS preparation were 1.50-6.18 (median 5.42) and 1.60-7.61 (median 3.4) lower, respectively, than those obtained following PK-DNase preparation. Among the 10 samples derived from RNA respiratory viruses, the minimum Ct values resulted from PK-DNase treatment of three samples, PBS treatment of five samples, and NALC treatment of two samples. Using identical volumes of sputum and inactivated viral culture diluted 1:10 or 1:1,000, the effects of each homogenization method on the MERS-CoV rRT-PCR results were evaluated (Table 2). Using a 1:10 dilution of inactivated viral culture, all samples treated with PK-DNase exhibited lower Ct values than those subjected to PBS or NALC treatment. The differences in Ct values between samples treated with PK-DNase or PBS were 5.4-7.8 for upE and 4.4-6.8 for ORF1a, while those for samples treated with PK-DNase or NALC were 4.7-5.8 for upE and 4.4-5.6 for ORF1a. Using the same volume of a 1:1,000 dilution of inactivated viral culture, one purulent sputum sample showed a false-negative result after PBS treatment. The Ct values of the other two sputum samples were similar following PK-DNase, PBS, and NALC treatments. Using a one-tenth volume of a 1:1,000 dilution of inactivated viral culture (to simulate conditions comparable to those of real clinical samples), the effects of each method on the MERS-CoV rRT-PCR results were evaluated (Table 3) . Among the three sputum samples, false-negative results were detected in two samples following PBS treatment and in three samples after NALC treatment (Table 3) . Although the Ct values after PK-DNase treatment tended to be lower than those following PBS or To assess statistical significance, we tested 15 additional spiked samples, which were prepared by adding a one-tenth volume of 1:1,000 diluted viral culture (Table 4 ). Among the 15 spiked sputum samples prepared in duplicate (30 total samples), false-negative results were detected in five samples (16.7%) using the PBS method and in four samples (13.3%) using the NALC method. The ranges of Ct values for upE from sputum samples were 31.1-35.4 using the PK-DNase method, 34.7-39.0 using the PBS method, and 33.9-38.6 using the NALC method. Compared with the control, which were prepared by adding a one-tenth volume of 1:1,000 diluted viral culture to PBS solution, the ranges of Ct values following the PBS and NALC methods significantly differed from the mean Ct value (33.2) of the control (both P < 0.0001).
