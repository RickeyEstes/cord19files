Nineteen extended family members had evidence of MERS-CoV by rRT-PCR or presence of MERS-CoV antibodies ( Figure 1 ). Seventy-nine relatives were interviewed and tested for MERS-CoV by both rRT-PCR and (unless already positive by rRT-PCR or <14 years of age) serology. These persons comprised 50 (96%) of the 52 relatives living in the 4 original households (including 13 children <14 years of age); 26 relatives visiting those households (including 6 children <14 years of age); and 3 ill adults identified in a separate branch of the family tree (J, K, and O; Figure 1 ) after the household investigation. All 26 visiting relatives were MERS-CoV-negative by both rRT-PCR and (for adults) serology.
