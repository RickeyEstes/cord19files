Twenty-four cats met the study inclusion criteria. Clinical findings are summarized in Table 1 . The median age was 8 months, with a range of 5-120 months. Eighteen cats were male (12 neutered), and 6 were female (5 neutered). Affected breeds included 13 domestic shorthair cats, 3 Birmans, 3 Ragdolls, 2 Sphynx, and 1 each of Burmese, Siberian, and Russian Blue. Information regarding household environment was available for 17 cats, 15 of which were from a multicat household. The median duration of clinical signs before referral was 14 days, with a range of 1-112 days. Presenting complaints included ataxia (15) , inappetence (14) , lethargy (9), paraparesis (5), head tilt (5), failure to thrive (4), weight loss (4), tetraparesis (3), abnormal behavior (2), head tremors (2), and a seizure event (1) . Notable physical examination findings included a thin body condition score (9), hypothermia with a rectal temperature <37.0°C (2), pyrexia with a rectal temperature >39.2°C (2), cranial uveitis (2), abdominal distension (2), tachypnea (2), dehydration (1), and pale mucous membranes (1). Neurologic examination findings included altered mentation (16; obtunded in 15, stuporous in 1), pathological nystagmus (13; vertical positional nystagmus in 9, rotatory positional nystagmus in 2, and horizontal resting nystagmus in 2), nonambulatory tetraparesis (9), vestibular ataxia (7), ambulatory tetraparesis (5), ambulatory paraparesis (4), head tilt (3), head tremors (3), head turn (1), and bilateral head excursions (1) . The clinical presentation of the 24 cases consisted of 3 distinct neurologic syndromes. Three cats presented with a T3-L3 myelopathy with no detectable brain involvement. Seven cats presented with central vestibular syndrome, including altered mental status, pronounced vestibular ataxia, and pathologic nystagmus. The remaining 14 cats presented with multifocal CNS disease with tetraparesis (14) , obtundation (13) , cervical hyperesthesia (6), decreased to absent menace response (6) , decreased facial sensation (3), facial paresis (2), anisocoria (2), absent vestibulo-ocular reflex (2) , and stupor (1) . Acute clinical deterioration to a nonambulatory status was documented before referral in 7 cats, all of which had multifocal CNS disease. Hematology and biochemistry results were available for 22 cats. In 15 (68%) cats, results of hematology, biochemistry, or both were within reference intervals (normal hematology and biochemistry parameters in 7 (32%) cats, normal hematology in 7, normal biochemistry in 1 cat). Notable abnormalities included a mild neutrophilia in 3 cats, mild leukocytosis in 2, mild lymphopenia in 1, and increased serum globulin concentrations in 4 cats (with albumin: globulin ratios of <0.8). The presence of antifeline coronavirus antibody in the serum was assessed in 9 cats (5 by ELISA, 4 by indirect immunofluorescence antibody), and found to be positive in 8, with titers ranging from 1:640 to 1:>10240. Nineteen cats underwent MRI of the brain, 4 of the brain and spinal cord, and 1 of the spinal cord only. Abnormalities were detected in all 24 cats. Ventriculomegaly was detected in 20 (86.9%) of the 23 brains imaged (Fig. 1) . Enlargement of all ventricles was present in 7 cats, enlargement of the lateral, third and fourth ventricles in 7, enlargement of the lateral ventricles, third ventricle and mesencephalic aqueduct in 3, and enlargement of the lateral ventricles only in 3 cats. An enlarged quadrigeminal cistern was present in 1 cat. Fifteen of the 19 cats (78.9%) for which FLAIR sequences were available had periventricular T2W hyperintensities, consistent with interstitial edema There is a failure of suppression of the CSF signal (asterisk) and periventricular hyperintensity (arrows). The maximum height of the lateral ventricles (white line) at the level of the interthalamic adhesion was recorded on transverse T2W images as a percentage of the brain height at that level (black line). ( Fig. 2) . Thirteen cats had full suppression of the CSF on FLAIR, whereas 6 showed failure of CSF suppression (Fig. 2 ). Contrast enhancement was detected after gadolinium administration in all 24 cats and was typically bilateral and symmetrical (Fig. 3) . Meningeal contrast enhancement was detected in 22 cats and was multifocal or generalized in 10, affecting the brainstem and cervical spinal cord in 5, the brainstem only in 2 and the spinal cord only in 2 cats. Ependymal contrast enhancement was present in 20 cats. It was observed in localized regions of the ependyma in 13 cats and was generalized throughout the ependyma in 7 cats. The ependyma of the third (17) and fourth (16) ventricles was most commonly affected. Magnetic resonance images were evaluated for evidence of mass effect. Abnormalities noted included foramen magnum herniation of the caudoventral aspect of the cerebellum in 14, cerebellar compression by the dilated fourth ventricle in 9, compression or distortion of the interthalamic adhesion in 7, dorsal compression of the brainstem by the dilated fourth ventricle in 4, and caudal transtentorial herniation in 3 cats (Fig. 1) . A portion of the cranial cervical spinal cord could be evaluated in 23 cats. An intramedullary T2W hyperintensity, consistent with syringomyelia, was evident in the cranial cervical spinal cord in 17 (73.9%) cats ( Fig. 1C,D) . The T3-L3 myelopathy group had mild (2) or moderate (1) MRI severity gradings; the central vestibular syndrome group had mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (4) gradings; and the multifocal CNS disease group had moderate (4) or severe (10) gradings (Table 2) . Cats in the T3-L3 myelopathy group had a median lateral ventricle height of 7.4% (range, 4.7-15.4) of brain height, compared with 15.4% for the vestibular group (range, 6.8-22.9) and 29.6% (range, 12.5-47.7%) for the multifocal CNS disease group. The median fourth ventricle height for cats in the T3-L3 myelopathy group was 5.9% (range, 5.6-6.2), compared with 13.2% for the vestibular group (range, 4-22.4) and 12.5% (range, 4.2-26.5%) for the multifocal CNS disease group. Thus, ventriculomegaly was more severe in cats in the central vestibular syndrome and multifocal CNS disease groups. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was performed in 11 cats. Ten samples were collected from the cerebellomedullary cistern and 1 sample by lumbar puncture. Total protein concentration was increased in all 11 (mean, 9.4 g/L; median, 3.6 g/L; range, 0.85-28.8 g/L) as was total nucleated cell count (mean, 196/lL; median, 171/lL; range, 15-479/lL). Neutrophilic pleocytosis was present in 7 cats, lymphocytic pleocytosis in 2, and mixed pleocytosis in 2 cats. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis by polymerase chain reaction for feline coronavirus antigen was performed in 5 cats and was positive in all 5. All 24 cats were euthanized because of the severity of their clinical signs and poor prognosis. Median survival time from the onset of clinical signs to euthanasia was 14 days (range, 2-115) for all cats, 16 days (range, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] for the T3-L3 myelopathy group, 18 days (range, 6-115) for the central vestibular syndrome group, and 11 days (range, 2-60) for the multifocal CNS disease group. Median survival time from referral to euthanasia was 2 days (range, 1-16), regardless of the clinical syndrome on presentation. Each cat underwent postmortem examination. Gross pathologic abnormalities were reported in 14 cats and included ventriculomegaly in 10, flattening of cerebral gyri in 4, meningeal congestion in 4, and white matter edema in 3 cats. Histopathologic abnormalities were detected in all 24 cats. Perivascular neutrophilic and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates affected the leptomeninges in 16 cats, the choroid plexus in 16, the periventricular space in 13, the spinal cord parenchyma in 8, and the brainstem parenchyma in 5 cats (Figs 4, 5) . Pathologic abnormalities were most commonly detected in the caudal cranial fossa, particularly affecting the caudoventral brainstem. Immunohistochemistry was performed on brain tissue in 10 cats; all showed positive intracellular staining for the feline coronavirus antigen. The T3-L3 myelopathy group had mild (2) or moderate (1) pathologic lesion grades, the central vestibular syndrome group had moderate (3) or severe (4) grades, and the multifocal CNS disease group had moderate (4) or severe (10) grades ( Table 2 ). The histopathologic lesion grade and MRI lesion grade were equivalent in all cats, with the exception of 1 cat that was graded mild on MRI findings but moderate on histopathologic findings. This cat was euthanized 6 days after the MRI was performed, during which time lesion progression could have occurred. Of the 10 cases from the RVC, pathologic samples were available for review in 9 cats (2 with a T3-L3 myelopathy, 3 with vestibular syndrome, and 4 with multifocal CNS disease). The 2 cats with a T3-L3 myelopathy had perivascular infiltrates 0-6 cells in thickness, the 3 cats with vestibular syndrome had infiltrates 1-14 cells in thickness, and the 4 cats with multifocal CNS disease had infiltrates 3-20 cells or more in thickness. Extension into the adjacent neuropil surrounding the mesencephalic aqueduct and fourth ventricle was evident in none of the T3-L3 myelopathy group, 2 of the vestibular syndrome group, and 3 of the multifocal CNS disease group. Extension into the neuropil adjacent to the lateral ventricles was evident in 1 cat in the multifocal CNS disease group. Therefore, histopathologic lesion severity was most marked in the multifocal CNS disease group.
