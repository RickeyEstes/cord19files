Recently we demonstrated that the European and North American strains of P. destructans were equally pathogenic for hibernating M. lucifugus [24, 25] . During these experiments histological sections from wings and other tissues were examined and graded for the presence of hyphae, edema, necrosis, bacteria (epidermal or invasive), neutrophil infiltration and inflammation. We also preserved samples which were then used in this study. We determined levels of transcripts for several immune and stress response genes (Table 1) in lungs from infected and control bats. Only those qRT-PCR reactions that yielded unambiguous results were considered. There were significant differences for transcripts for the interleukins (IL) 10 and 23, the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), and the anti microbial and immunoregulatory peptide Cathelicidin (Figure 1 ). In Figure 1a lower DCt of one indicates approximately a two-fold higher concentration of RNA. Infected bats as a group had lower DCt values (on an average 8 to 14 fold higher concentrations of RNA, histograms in Figure 1 ) for the four genes. While the group of infected hibernating bats had higher levels of transcripts for IL10, IL23, Cathelicidin and TNFa than hibernating uninfected bats, the levels varied over a wide range with some infected bats having levels comparable to (or lower than) those of uninfected animals. Since the level of fungal infection and pathology varied considerably among infected bats, we attempted to correlate transcript levels with scores for fungal infection, fungal hyphae and bacterial infection in wings and neutrophil accumu- Myotis homologues for innate response genes were identified by scanning the Myotis genome for sequences that matched those of well-characterized reference organisms. Where qRT-PCR primers for reference organisms d had been validated in the literature b,c , we used the corresponding Myotis sequences as primers. Myotisspecific substitutions in these primers are in bold a . For other genes (HSP70, TNFa, NOS2, IL-10, GRP78) Myotis-specific primers were designed from potential Myotis exon sequences using parameters for optimal use in PCR reactions. In all cases the identity of PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. Primers were used in qRT-PCR at a final concentration of 1 mM. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0112285.t001 lation in lungs (Table 2 ). IL23 and Cathlicidin levels correlated with all four parameters of disease and inflammation. IL10 correlated with level of infection, and hyphae and bacterial scores in the wing, and TNFa correlated with level of infection and wing hyphae score. There was an inverse relationship between transcript levels and DCt. The correlation coefficients are therefore negative.
