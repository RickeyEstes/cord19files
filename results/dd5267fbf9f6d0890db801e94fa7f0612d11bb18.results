There was no significant difference in age and the sex ratio between the CAP and the control groups By comparison of inflammation markers between CAP and control groups (Fig. 1 ), we found that the value of WBC, percentage of neutrophils, neutrophil count, and ESR in CAP group were 10.13 (7.22, 15 .34) Â 10 9 /L, 64.4 (49.9, 76.9)%, 6.12 (3.66, 10.16) Â 10 9 /L, and 14 (6, 25) mm/h, respectively, whereas the 4 indexes in control group were 6.30 (4.48, 7.66) Â 10 9 /L, 49.7 (45.1, 56.5)%, 3.22 (2.14, 4.02) Â 10 9 /L, and 6 (4, 17) mm/h, indicated that the 4 inflammation markers in CAP group were significant higher than values in control group (all P < 0.05). The PA of CAP group was significantly lower than that of the control group (134 [111, 162]vs 159 [145, 170] mg/L, The ROC curve of WBC, percentage of neutrophils, neutrophil count, ESR, and PA for the diagnosis of CAP was shown in Figs. 2 and 3; the parameters obtained from ROC curve were shown in Table 1 . Multivariate logistic regression analyses using multiple variables (WBC, percentage of neutrophils, neutrophil count, ESR, and PA) which were statistically significant based on univariate analysis was used to examine the impact of multiple independent indicators on the diagnosis of CAP as a dependent variable. PA was the only significant protective factor (odds ratio: 0.974; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.956-0.993; P = 0.008) ( Table 2) . Comparison of general status between mild CAP and severe CAP ( Table 3 ). The IgM antibody test for 155 patients with CAP showed that 38 patients with MP positive, 108 patients with MP negative, and 9 patients who declined to detect. There was no significant difference for MP positive rate between 2 groups (25.6% vs 28.6%, P = 0.774). By comparison of general status, it was shown that the RR in severe CAP group was significant higher than mild CAP group at the admission (P < 0.05). If considering the age, the criteria for tachypnea are as follows: ≥60 bpm (<2 months), ≥50 bpm (2 months-1 year old), ≥40 bpm (1-5 years old), ≥30 bpm (old than age 5 years). There was significant higher rate of tachypnea for severe CAP group (13.6%) than mild CAP group (1.5%) (x 2 = 5.439, P = 0.020). In addition, there were only 2 cases of pleural effusion and 1 case of myocardial damage in the severe CAP group. By comparison of the laboratory indexes in different CAP group (Fig. 4 ), we found that PA level was 104 (74, 136) mg/L in severe CAP group, which was significant lower than in mild CAP group (136 [118, 163] mg/L) (P = 0.001). The ROC curve of PA for the assessment of CAP severity was shown in Fig. 5 , the area under the curve was 0.728, P = 0.001, 95% CI was 0.604 to 0.853. The best cutoff value was 125 mg/L, the sensitivity was 0.714, and the specificity was 0.703.
