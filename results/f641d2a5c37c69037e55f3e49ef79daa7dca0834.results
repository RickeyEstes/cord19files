This work surveyed 439 cats: 224 males and 215 females. Of those analyzed, 209 were healthy and 230 showed clinical symptoms. With regard to their living conditions 196 were strictly house confined, 144 were house kept but with courtyard access and 99 were strays. A significant fraction (12.5%) of cats was FIV seropositive using ELISA (Table 1 (a)); 15.3% of cats presenting clinical illness were seropositive as opposed to 9.3% of the apparently healthy cats. In Tables 1 (a) and 1 (b) characteristics of ELISA seropositive and seronegative cats are shown. All cats in Table 1 (b) were also seronegative for FeLV antigen. The peak of FIV infection appeared in cats between the ages of 1 and 5 years. The mean age of the FIV positive cats was 5.6 years. OfFIV seropositive cats, 74.5% were males and 25.5% were females (Table 1 (a)); 73% of the male positive cats were entire and 27% neutered, whilst 93% of the FIV infected female cats were sexually intact. Of the 99 stray cats examined, 19 (19%) showed antibodies to FIV. Cats kept in houses but with courtyard access had a similar prevalence (18%). On the contrary, only ten (5%) out of the 196 cats strictly house confined were FIV seropositive by ELISA. A wide range of clinical signs was present in the sick cats that were proven to be FIV infected. The most frequent clinical signs were stomatitis, gastroenteric disorders, respiratory abnormalities, otological and ocular disorders and body weight loss as indicated in Table 2 . A score based on the classification of oral cavity lesions of the seropositive cats is reported in Table 4 . The prevalence of the FeLV antigenemia in the tested animals was 2%. Forty-one out of 55 ELISA positive sera were still available for the Western blot analysis. The specificity of the Western blot had been previously evaluated on sera from FIV infected cats and on sera of specific pathogen free (SPF) animals (data not shown ). All but one of these sera showed specific antibodies to FIV polypeptides. In all the sera positive by Western blot, antibodies to p24 and p 10 of FIV were always detected. In Fig. 1 some of the sera patterns analyzed with Western blot are visible. Attempts to correlate the Western blot patterns and the stage of the pathology were made. The serological status of the FIV positive cats tested in Western blot and their clinical stage are shown in Table 5 . The results of statistical analysis by logistic regression are shown in Table  6 . The maximum likelihood analysis of variance (Table 6) shows that the proposed model fits (likelihood ratio, 92.31; P = 0.64 ). The factors sex, age, living conditions and breed have a significant influence on the variance model, whilst clinical signs and the integrity of reproductive apparatus are not significant. However, these two latter factors have a positive contribution in the model fitting and so they were retained. The risk estimates show that strays and males of domestic breed have the highest risk of being FIV positive, and the risk is three times higher during the first 5 years of life, while decreasing in older cats.
