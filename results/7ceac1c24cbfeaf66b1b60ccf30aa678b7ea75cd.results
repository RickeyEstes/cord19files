We identified a total of 1106 articles from database searches, reducing to 1083 after the removal of duplicates. Eleven additional papers were identified via citation tracking. After screening, 27 articles remained within protocol eligibility criteria ( Fig. 1 1 ) ; one of the included articles [25] presented two separate studies and data from both were extracted and presented separately. Thus, 28 studies from 27 articles were included in the systematic review , and 21 from 20 in the primary meta-analysis [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] . When examined as full-text articles, seven studies did not present sufficient quantitative data for inclusion in the primary meta-analysis [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] (Fig. 1 ).
