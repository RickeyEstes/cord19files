Programmed +1 and Ã€1 frameshifting events occur during translation of SARS-CoV ORF 3a variants SARS-CoV ORF 3a encodes a minor structural protein of 274 amino acids. Over the course of cloning and expression of the gene, a mixed population of clones with six, seven, eight and nine T stretches located 14 nt downstream of the initiation codon was found. The existence of these ORF 3a variants was confirmed recently in SARS patients (21) . To examine the expression of 3a variants, full-length clones covering the 3a and 3b regions with six (pSARS-3a/6T), seven (pSARS-3a/ 7T) and eight (pSARS-3a/8T) Ts were constructed (Figure 1a) . In vitro expression of pSARS-3a/6T in the transcription coupled translation reticulocyte lysate system showed the detection of a dominant product of $31 kDa, representing the full-length 3a protein (Figure 1b, lane 1) . In addition, a minor band (3a*) of $27 kDa was expressed, which represents the initiated product from an internal AUG (22) . Interestingly, the 31 kDa full-length 3a protein was also detected when constructs pSARS-3a/7T and pSARS-3a/8T were expressed in the same in vitro expression system (Figure 1b, lanes 2 and 3). The efficiencies of the 31 kDa 3a protein expressed from these two constructs are $32 and 20%, respectively, compared with that expressed from pSARS-3a/6T ( Figure 1b, lanes 1-3) . These results reveal that frameshift events may occur during translation of ORF 3a variants with seven and eight Us. The expression of these ORF 3a variants was then tested in bacteria. Three constructs, pET3a-His/6T, pET3a-His/7T and pET3a-His/8T, were made and transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL-21 ( Figure 1a ). After induction with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), the expression of the His-tagged 3a protein was analyzed by western blot with anti-His antibody. The 32 kDa His-tagged 3a protein was detected in bacterial cells transformed with all three constructs ( Figure 1c , lanes 1-3). The efficiencies of the protein expressed from pET3a-His/7T and pET3a-His/8T are $35 and 18%, respectively, of that expressed from pET3a-His/6T ( Figure 1c) . Examination of the expression of these three ORF 3a variants was finally carried out in mammalian cells. Expression of the Flag-tagged 3a from pF-3a/6T in Cos-7 cells showed very efficient detection of the 32 kDa 3a protein by western blot with anti-Flag antibody ( Figure 1d , lane 2). The full-length 3a protein was also detected in cells expressing the two ORF 3a variants with seven (pF-3a/7T) and eight (pF-3a/8T) Ts ( Figure 1d, lanes 3 and 4) . The expression efficiencies of the full-length 3a protein from these two constructs are $28 and 10%, respectively, as compared with that expressed from the construct with six Ts (Figure 1d , lanes 2-4). The detection of the full-length 3a protein expression from these ORF 3a variants in all three expression systems confirms that the hepta-and octo-uridine stretches could direct efficient frameshifting during translation elongation process. The hepta-uridine stretch functions as a slippery sequence in an ORF 3a variant The construct with seven Ts was then used to characterize the slippery sequence. Point mutations of T to C at every individual T position were made, giving rise to pF-3a/7TM1 to M7 (Figure 2a ). Studies on HIV frameshifting mechanisms led to the identification of U UUU UUA as a slippery sequence, but mutation of the nucleotide A immediately downstream of the six T stretch did not significantly affect the frameshifting efficiency (15) . Accordingly, mutation of the nucleotide A immediately downstream of the seventh T was made, giving rise to pF-3a/7TM8 (Figure 2a) . In vitro expression of pF-3a/7T showed, once again, the detection of the Flag-tagged full-length 3a protein (Figure 2b , lane 1). In addition, the internally initiated 3a* product was also detected (Figure 2b , lane 1). However, the full-length 3a expression was significantly decreased to an undetectable level when mutants M1 to M7 were expressed (Figure 2b , lanes 2-8). The detection of similar amounts of 3a* expression from these constructs confirmed that the absence of the full-length 3a protein expression is due to the point mutations introduced into the seven T stretch. Mutation of the nucleotide A immediately downstream of the seven T stretch did not affect the expression of the full-length 3a protein (Figure 2b , lane 9). Expression of these mutant constructs in Cos-7 cells showed similar results to the in vitro expression system. Western blot analysis with anti-3a and anti-Flag antibodies led to the detection of the full-length 3a protein in cells transfected with pF-3a/7T and pF-3a/7TM8, respectively (Figure 2c, lanes 2 and 10). The 3a protein was not detected in cells expressing M1-M7 mutants (Figure 2c, lanes 3-9) . These results confirm that mutation of any T in the seven T stretch totally abolishes the frameshift event. To rule out the possibility that other events, such as RNA editing and transcriptional slippage that might lead to deletion of the extra nucleotide, could account for the expression of the full-length 3a protein from pF-3a/7T, RT-PCR and sequencing analysis of RNA extracted from Cos-7 cells transfected with wild type and mutant pF-3a/7T constructs were performed. The results confirmed that there was no deletion and reversion of the mutations back to wild-type 3a at the mRNA level (Figure 2d ). Sequences upstream and downstream of the heptauridine site do not affect the frameshifting efficiency Deletion of sequences upstream and downstream of the slippage site was carried out to search for stimulators that are essential for efficient frameshifting in most of the frameshifting signals identified so far. To facilitate deletion analysis of the upstream sequence, a cDNA fragment covering ORF3a with seven Ts was fused in frame to the 3 0 end of the EGFP, giving rise to construct pEGFP-3a/7T (Figure 3a ). Expression of this construct was expected to produce a 29 kDa protein, representing the EGFP product terminated at a UGA codon 61 nt downstream of the initiator AUG for 3a (Figure 3a ). If frameshifting did occur during translation of this construct, a 55 kDa product terminated at the original UAA codon for 3a and representing a fusion of EGFP and 3a would be expressed ( Figure 3a ). As expected, expression of this plasmid in RRL in vitro showed the detection of a major 29 kDa protein (Figure 3b, lane 1) . In addition, a minor band of $55 kDa, representing the frameshifting product, was also detected (Figure 3b, lane 1) . The frameshifting efficiency is $32%. Three deletion constructs with deletion of various upstream sequences were made ( Figure 3a ). As can be seen, sequences deleted in these constructs are in the EGFP coding region, and are not directly related to the original ORF 3a. Nevertheless, expression of these constructs in vitro showed the detection of a comparable level of frameshifting efficiency (Figure 3b, lanes 2-4) . Expression of these constructs in Cos-7 cells showed the detection of the frameshifting product by western blot with polyclonal anti-3a antibodies (Figure 3b, lanes 6-9) . Analysis of the sequences downstream of the seven Us using the MFOLD program predicated two potential stem-loops forming from nt 39 to 56 (starting from AUG for 3a) and from nt 62 to 88. The loop regions could partially base pair with the downstream sequences and form a potential pseudoknot interaction. Deletion of sequences covering this region as well as other sequences upstream and downstream of the seven T stretch was made based on pEGFP-3a/7T. Five constructs (pEGFP-3aD1 to pEGFP-3aD5), containing deletions of various regions in ORF 3a, were constructed and expressed in Cos-7 cells (Figure 3a) . The results obtained showed that these deletions did not have significant effects on the expression of the frameshifting product (Figure 3c, lanes 2-7) , suggesting that stimulatory elements may not exist in the surrounding sequences. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the hepta-uridine stretch alone may function as an efficient frameshift signal.
