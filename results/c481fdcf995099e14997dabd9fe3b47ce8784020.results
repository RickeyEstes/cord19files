The 112 patients in the ICU with A(H7N9) infection were predominantly male (n 5 75, 67.0%), aged 14-65 years (n 5 78, 69.6%) ( Table 2) . Their underlying medical conditions, described in Table 2 , included hypertension (n 5 54, 48.2%), coronary heart disease (n 5 12, 10.7%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n 5 6, 5.4%), cerebrovascular disease (n 5 5, 4.5%), chronic liver disease (n 5 7, 6.3%), chronic renal disease (n 5 4, 3.6%), diabetes mellitus (n 5 17, 15.2%), rheumatoid arthritis (n 5 3, 2.7%) and cancer (n 5 7, 6.3%). The proportion of patients with liver impairment was lower on admission than during the hospital stay (n 5 27 (24.1%) vs. n 5 51 (45.5%), P , 0.001). Antiviral therapy was performed in all 112 patients, while antibiotic therapy was performed in 91 (81.3%) and glucocorticoid therapy in 63 (56.2%) ( Table 2 ). An ALT level of .20-fold the ULN was found in only two patients, not only on admission but also during the hospital stay. The extent of Hypoxic hepatitis in A(H7N9)-infected patients Y Zhang et al 2 ALT elevation was considerably higher in HH patients than in non-HH patients with liver injury (on admission, 1079.50 6 41.72 U/L vs. 79.50 6 56.34 U/L, P , 0.0001; hospital stay, 1109.00 6 243.24 U/L vs. 102.90 6 86.11 U/L, P , 0.0001) ( Table 2 ). These two cases were diagnosed as HH. The incidence of HH in our single-centre cohort of ICU patients with A(H7N9) infection was 1.8% (2/112). Both cases exhibited respiratory, renal, circulatory and cardiac failure. In addition, viral hepatitis and autoimmune diseases were excluded based on the negative results of serum marker tests. DILI was excluded based on no history of drug intake (such as acetaminophen, Chinese herbs, etc.) suspected to induce DILI prior to admission. Liver ultrasound excluded surgical biliary tract diseases and space-occupying lesions. Details of the two patients are reported below.
