Sociodemographic characteristics of participants. The sociodemographic characteristics of participants are listed in Table 2 . Sampled consumers and live-poultry workers had an average age of 25 years (SD 13.0) and 41 years (SD 9.0), respectively. For consumers sampled, over 30% resided in Guangzhou and 77.5% lived in the Pearl River Delta region, but most reported being native-born Cantonese (80.0%). As for the sub-groups of live-poultry workers, most live-poultry traders sold chicken (97.2%) and ducks (84.0%) and their sales volume in median was 30 per day. Over a half (64.8%) of the live-poultry traders surveyed worked in the Pearl River Delta region. Most poultry farm workers bred chicken for commercial trading (89.6%) and some bred ducks (10.4%). Also, participating poultry farm workers reported that their cities had once reported confirmed cases of the avian influenza virus (36.8%), and that their farms had a trade volume of 100,000 or more per year (77.0%) and a business history of over 5 years (58.9%). A total of 64.7% of surveyed farm workers worked in the non-Pearl River Delta region. Perception and acceptability of the CSLPP. This study found that 58.5% of consumers knew about the CSLPP. (Additional file 1: Table S4 ) Among those who had heard of the policy, 57.1% expressed support for the policy, 26.5% were indifferent to the policy, and 16.4% disapproved of the policy. This study also summarized policy acceptability of consumers across cities. (Additional file 1: Table S5 ) Over half (52.4%) of consumers in Guangzhou supported the policy. Univariate a Statistical significance was found in group comparison between items in the Pearl River Delta and those outside the Pearl River Delta using the method of the chi-squared test. Age distribution of live-poultry workers from the Pearl River Delta was statistically different from that of those outside the Pearl River Delta (P = 0.02) **P value was equal to or lower than 0.01. The chi-squared test was used in the statistical analysis. Gender distribution was statistically different for consumers living in the Pearl River Delta region and those outside the region (P = 0.002). Age distribution was statistically different for consumers living in the Pearl River Delta region and those living outside the region (P = 0.003). Income status and the status of being a Cantonese were statistically different between regions (both P values were lower than 0.001). Gender distribution was statistically different for live-poultry workers in the Pearl River Delta region and outside the region (P = 0.007). Live-poultry traders and poultry farm workers were statistically different between regions (P = 0.002) analysis of concerning factors (Additional file 1: Table  S6 ) showed that consumers who raised an objection to the CSLPP might possess the following traits: nativeborn Cantonese, (family) preference to purchase live poultry slaughtered on site, not believing in the food safety of chilled poultry products, etc. For live-poultry workers, while most knew about the policy (92.6%) and also understood its purpose (96.7%), acceptability differed within sub-groups. For live-poultry traders, 37.9% supported the policy but 45.4% disapproved of the policy. For poultry farm workers, 62.6% supported the policy and 11.1% disapproved of the policy. The remaining were indifferent to the policy (16.6% and 26.3% for live-poultry traders and poultry farm workers, respectively). A total of 69.5% of livepoultry traders complained about the inconvenience caused by the CSLPP where only 24.2% of poultry farm workers complained about inconvenience (Table 3) . Univariate analysis was used to explore lower acceptability among live-poultry traders, and significant factors include: being an employer, loss in trading volume, given subsidies, inconvenience induced by the CSLPP, and low scores on knowledge of avian flu, etc. (Additional file 1: Table S7 ).
