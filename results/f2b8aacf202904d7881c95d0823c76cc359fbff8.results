Fifteen morphologic categories of normal or damaged cells were distinguished ( Table  1) . The undamaged ciliated, serous, basal, brush, and migratory cells were identified by standard criteria (Jeffery and Reid, 1975; Plopper et al., 1983; Pearsall et al., 1984) . Damaged ciliated cells were categorized as damaged-cilia, degenerate, or necrotic cells, and damaged serous cells were categorized as degenerate or necrotic. These categories of cells, as well as the identification of the intermediate cells, unidentified cells, necrotic unidentified cells, and sloughed cells, were based on criteria previously described (Nikula et al., 1988) . The intermediate cells in this study are similar to those observed previously in rat respiratory epithelium and appear to represent immature cells, mostly preciliated cells (Jeffrey and Reid, 1975; Breeze and Wheeldon, 1977) . The metaplastic cells were polyhedral, their longest axis was parallel to the basal lamina, and they were located in the middle stratum of stratified epithelia. The most prominent cytoplasmic feature of these cells was the presence of numerous cytoplasmic tonofilaments. Numerous desmosomes attached these cells to neighboring cells. These cells had few profiles of endoplasmic reticulum and lacked secretory granules. The cytoplasmic electron density was greater than that of typical serous or ciliated cells. Metaplastic cells were distinguished from serous cells by their lack of secretory granules, presence of numerous tonofilaments but few profiles of endoplasmic reticulum, stratification, and lack of a columnar shape with orientation perpendicular to the basal lamina. The tracheal organ cultures exposed to filtered air had pseudostratified, columnar, ciliated, epithelia (Fig. IA) . The predominant cell types were serous cells, basal cells, and ciliated cells (Fig. 2A) . These cells were well differentiated and could be readily distinguished from one another. The epithelia from the cultures exposed to air/O3 were also pseudostratified and columnar, but they were nonciliated or sparsely ciliated (Fig. 1B) . Damaged-cilia cells and intermediate cells were evident (Fig. 2B) . Rarely, the basal cells appeared mildly enlarged. The 95% O,-exposed epithelia were thicker than those from the air-or air/03-exposed groups (Fig. 1C) .

The next stratum was composed of one to three layers of metaplastic cells. The most superficial layer consisted of columnar or cuboidal serous cells and rare ciliated cells (Fig.  2D) . These epithelia were nonciliated or very sparsely ciliated. The predominant cell types were serous cells, metaplastic cells, and basal cells. Focal aggregates of adherent necrotic cells (categorized as sloughed cells) were located in areas where the superficial columnar layer was missing and the metaplastic cells extended to the epithelial surface. Sloughed cells were attached to each of the 95% 02/03 epithelia. Quantitation of cell densities revealed several differences among the four groups in the response of the tracheal epithelium to the various experimental atmospheres (Table 1 ). The 95% 02-exposed group exhibited a significant increase in the total cell density and a concomitant increase in total serous cell density compared to the air-and air/03-exposed groups. The intermediate cell density was also significantly increased in the 95% 02-exposed group compared to the air-exposed group. The total cell density increased in the 95% 02/03 group compared to the air and air/O3 groups, but this difference had not quite reached the statistical significance level. The undamaged ciliated cell population was significantly decreased in the 95% OZ/03-exposed group compared to the two groups that had not been exposed to ozone. The densities of degenerate serous cells and sloughed cells were significantly increased in the 95% O,/ 03-exposed group compared to the other three groups. The basal cell population was significantly smaller than that of the filtered air group, while the metaplastic cell population was significantly larger in the 95% O,/ 03-exposed group compared to the other three groups. In the air/OS-exposed group, the total ciliated cell population decreased compared to the two groups not exposed to ozone, and a third of the ciliated cell population exhibited damaged cilia, but the density changes did not quite reach the statistical significance level. When calculated as a proportion of the total ciliated cell population, the proportion of undamaged ciliated cells in the air/Orexposed group (40.4%) was significantly decreased (p < 0.05) compared to the air-exposed group (97.4%).
