Uninfected Sf x) cells did not fuse to each other at any pH. After Sf9 cells (36 h post-infection with wild-tylm baculovirus) were exposed to acidic media, syneytia formation ensued (Fig. I A-E). First syneytia formation was ob~rved 2 rain after the low pH treatment, and was maximal at one hour. Syneytia formation was graded below pH 5.5, and was maximal at pH 5.2 ( Fig. 2A) . The efficiency of fusion increased with cell density ( Fig.  2A) , probably due to increased cell--cell contact. Syncytia formation was also dependent upon viral inoc-
