During the study period, there were around 860,000 and 112,000 people older than 65 years living in Hong Kong and Brisbane, respectively (Tables 1 and 2 ). Compared to Hong Kong, during the study period Brisbane had higher mortality rates for all-cause (81.7 vs 66.5 per 100,000 population), cardiorespiratory diseases (CRD, 42.1 vs 33.8), stroke (9.5 vs 6.5) and ischemic heart diseases (IHD, 17.0 vs 7.5), but a lower rate for pneumonia and influenza (P&I, 2.8 vs 9.9), and a comparable rate for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 3.9 vs 4.2) (Additional file 1: Appendix 3). All the cause-specific hospitalization rates were much lower in Brisbane than in Hong Kong (233.6 vs 411.7 per 100,000 population for CRD, 21.7 vs 69.5 for P&I, 39.7 vs 79.9 for COPD, 19.4 vs 73.8 for stroke), with the only exception of IHD (65.1 vs 76.6) (Additional file 1: Appendix 4). Hong Kong and Brisbane have opposite seasonal climate patterns; the former is located in the Northern Hemisphere and the latter in the Southern Hemisphere. Mean temperature and relative humidity of Brisbane were lower than those of Hong Kong (Additional file 1: Appendix 5). Compared to the pre-SARS period, average number of hospitalizations in Hong Kong was lower in the post-SARS period for most disease categories, with the exception of a three-fold increase in P&I hospitalizations. This significant increase is likely due to the change in coding practice after the SARS outbreak (Table 1 ). Average number of hospitalizations was higher in the post-pandemic period for all the disease categories. Weekly figures for mortality and hospitalization in Brisbane did not obviously differ across the pre-SARS, post-SARS, and post-pandemic periods ( Table 2) . Due to negative estimates in the annual excess rates for mortality, the post-SARS RR could not be estimated for IHD hospitalizations in Hong Kong, and P&I mortality, stroke, and IHD hospitalizations in Brisbane. Similarly, the post-pandemic RR could not be estimated for P&I and IHD hospitalization in Hong Kong, and stroke and COPD hospitalization in Brisbane (Additional file 1: Appendix 6). Influenza-associated all-cause mortality rates were found increased after SARS in Hong Kong (post-SARS vs pre-SARS RR = 1.22) but decreased in Brisbane (RR = 0.87). The post-SARS COPD mortality increased in both cities (1.04 and 1.03 in Hong Kong and Brisbane, Table 3 ). Decreased excess rates of mortality in Hong Kong were observed for CRD, stroke, and IHD mortality (RR = 0.90 and 0.74), while the corresponding RRs in Brisbane were 0.79 and 0.33, respectively. Only IHD mortality had a greater reduction observed in Hong Kong than in Note. Weekly positive percentage (%) is defined as the percentage of positive specimens among annual total specimens Brisbane (RR = 0.45 vs 1.09). None of RR estimates for the control disease injuries were significant (data not shown). Compared to the pre-SARS period, excess rates of CRD hospitalizations in the post-SARS period decreased in Hong Kong, but increased markedly in Brisbane (RR = 0.86 vs 26.82). Influenza-associated hospitalizations for P&I and COPD increased more in Brisbane than in Hong Kong (RR = 3.49 vs 2.79 and 1.33 vs 1.04). Compared to the pre-SARS period, excess mortality rates increased in Hong Kong for all the disease categories except for IHD, but only all-cause and COPD mortality increased in Brisbane. Difference between Hong Kong and Brisbane was found statistically significant for all-cause and stroke mortality. Annual excess rates of all-cause mortality increased in Hong Kong to a lesser extent than in Brisbane (RR = 1.41 vs 2.39), whereas an opposite trend was observed for stroke mortality (RR = 1.26 vs 0.29). Subset analysis with peaks seasons only, or vaccine matched years only, generally derived larger RR estimates ( Table 3 ). The estimates for CRD became significantly higher than one, and the Brisbane estimates were much greater than the Hong Kong ones. Many outcomes could not be estimated due to negative values of excess rates.
