Three cohorts of army recruits undertook basic military training at the two camps during the study period, in May 2014-July 2014, November 2014-January 2015, and May 2015-July 2015. In total, 933 recruits undertook training during these three periods. Of these, 867 (93%) were enrolled in the study. Of the 867 participants, five participants withdrew from the study and 44 participants recruited in November 2014 were transferred out of the camp to complete their training elsewhere. The remaining 818 (94%) completed the 10-week follow-up and were included in the analysis. All participants were male and the median age was 21 years (range: 20-29 years). Details of recruitment and follow-up completion for each cohort are given in Supplemental Figure 1 . Rates of illness. There were a total of 248 episodes of URI and 8,063 person-weeks of follow-up, yielding an overall URI rate of 3.1 per 100 person-weeks. Upper respiratory illness rates ranged from 2.6 to 4.6 per 100 person-weeks across cohorts, with the exception of the camp A May 2014 cohort, in which no URI episodes were reported ( Figure 1 ). There were 160 ILI episodes, giving an overall ILI rate of 2.0 per 100 person-weeks, ranging from 0 to 4.1 per 100 person-weeks across cohorts. Symptoms and time off work. Fever was present in nearly two-thirds of URI episodes. Cough and sore throat occurred in > 90% of URI episodes, nasal congestion and headache in > 80% of episodes, and malaise and breathing difficulty in > 60% of episodes. All these symptoms were significantly more common in ILI compared with non-ILI episodes ( Table 1) . Influenza-like illness cases were also more likely to take time off work than non-ILI cases (57.5% versus 13.6%, P < 0.001), although the length of time taken off work was short (median 1 day). There was one hospitalization in an individual diagnosed with pneumonia who was off work for 7 days. Disease etiology. Among the 134 URI and ILI samples tested by multiplex PCR, a pathogen was detected in 128. A single pathogen was detected in 26% of samples, two pathogens in 31%, three pathogens in 26%, and four pathogens in 12%. Among URI pathogens, the most common viruses detected were rhinoviruses (22.4%), influenza B (11.9%), coronavirus 229 (5.2%), adenovirus (3.0%), and influenza A/H3 (3.0%). Other viruses accounted for < 3% of URI cases each. Of 133 samples tested for influenza by both RT-PCR and the Fast Track multiplex assay, 20 (15%) tested positive by at least one assay, and all of these were also positive by RT-PCR. Of the 20 RT-PCR positives, four were positive for influenza A/H3, of which one was also positive by the multiplex assay. Of the remaining 16 positive for influenza B by RT-PCR, 14 were also positive by the multiplex assay. There were no samples that tested positive by the multiplex assay and negative by RT-PCR. Among the bacteria, the most commonly detected species were Haemophilus influenzae type B (62.7%), H. influenzae non-type B (58.2%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.4%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (16.4%). However, these were commonly found in combination with other pathogens. When considering only samples in which a single organism was found, H. influenzae type B was found in 13.4% of samples, H. influenzae non-type B in 9.0%, and S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila in 0.7% each. There was little evidence to suggest that etiological agents differed between ILI and non-ILI cases, with the exception of H. influenzae non-type B and coronavirus 229, which occurred more frequently in non-ILI cases, and influenza A/H3 and coronavirus HKU1, which occurred more frequently in ILI cases ( Table 2) . Analysis of URI cases by time since the start of follow-up indicated strong temporal clustering of cases, with each cluster involving several respiratory pathogens (Figure 2 ). For example, the single cluster in Camp A during the November 2014 cohort resulted in identification of both rhinovirus and coronavirus 63, as well as numerous colonizing bacteria. In other clusters, rhinovirus was also identified in combination with parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, and influenza B virus ( Figure 2) . Influenza vaccination and seroconversion. At enrollment, 2.4% of recruits reported having received influenza vaccination in the previous 12 months. In the serology subset, Table 3) . Thirteen of 169 (8%) recruits seroconverted over the 10-week training period. Seroconversion was most common against influenza B/Massachusetts (N = 7) and influenza A/H3 (N = 3) (Table 3) Colonization. At baseline, 82.3% of recruits were colonized with H. influenzae type B and 31.5% with H. influenzae non-type B. Other common colonizing bacteria were K. pneumoniae (14.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (8.5%), and S. pneumoniae (8.5%). At the end of follow-up, colonization with H. influenzae non-type B had increased to 74.1%, and S. pneumoniae to 33.6%, whereas colonization with H. influenzae type B and K. pneumoniae had decreased to 67.2% and 8.4%, respectively. In addition, Moraxella catarrhalis was found in four (3.1%) and L. pneumophila in two (1.5%) end of follow-up samples. No change in S. aureus colonization was found. In a subset of paired baseline and end of follow-up samples initially negative for H. influenzae non-type B (N = 89), the risk of H. influenzae non-type B acquisition was 70.1% (95% CI: 54.4-90.6%). Among those negative for S. pneumoniae at baseline (N = 119), the risk of acquiring S. pneumoniae during the follow-up period was 31.9% (95% CI: 22.6-43.8%). Use of medications. Of 248 URI episodes, 39.1% were prescribed antibiotics. Of these, all but one were prescribed amoxicillin or azithromycin. In multivariable logistic regression, cases were more likely to be prescribed antibiotics if they presented with tonsillitis (OR = 5.10, 95% CI: 2.35-11.10), chills (OR = 3.91, 95% CI: 1.44-10.62), and swollen lymph nodes (OR = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.07-6.04). Antibiotic prescription was less likely if patients presented with nasal congestion (OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.12-0.54). There was no difference in prescribing between ILI and non-ILI patients. Of 35 URI cases prescribed antibiotics and with available multiplex PCR results, 16 (45.6%) had viral pathogens detected and eight (22.9%) had a bacterial target detected in the absence of other pathogens.
