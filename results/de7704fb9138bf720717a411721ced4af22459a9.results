The present study included 54 patients 26 males and 28 females with SCAP. From 54 there were 28 patients 15 males and 13 females with comorbidities and 26 patients 11 males and 15 females without comorbidities. The most common comorbidities was diabetes mellitus and hypertension (13%), chronic bronchitis (11.1%) and bronchial asthma (7.4%) ( Table 1) . As regards clinical presentation, fever was present in 85.7% of patients with comorbidities compared to 100% in patients without comorbidities, cough 100%, shortness of breath 92.5%, hypoxemia was 82.1% in patients with comorbidities compared to 76.9% in patients without comorbidities, expectoration was 78.6% in patients with comorbidities compared to 73.1% in patient without comorbidities, confusion was 25% in patients with comorbidities compared to 7.7% in patients without comorbidities. Low systolic blood pressure (BP) was 39.3% in patients with comorbidities compared to 11.5% in patients without comorbidities, low diastolic BP was 35.7% in patients with comorbidities compared to 7.7% in patients without comorbidities, differences were statistically significant. Complication in form of renal failure occurred in 7.1% and septic shock in 14.3% in patients with comorbidities compared to septic shock in 7.7% in patients without comorbidities, the difference was statistically non significant (see Table 2 ). Table 3 showed initial laboratory investigation, complete blood picture, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, serum sodium, serum potassium and blood gas analyses. The difference between both groups was statistically significant as regards hemoglobin which was low in patients with comorbidities, high neutrophils count, high blood urea and serum creatinine in patients with comorbidities, compared to patients without comorbidities. Low PH and PaO 2 with high PaCo 2 in patients with comorbidities compared to patients without comorbidities the differences was statistically significant. Table 4 showed chest X-ray finding. Bilateral patchy infiltrate in 35.1%, bilateral patchy infiltrate with cavitations in 3.7%, bilateral lower lobes infiltrate in 16.6%, bilateral lower lobes consolidation with pleural effusion in 3.7%, right lower lobe consolidation in 14.8%, left lower lobe consolidation in 11.1%, right upper lobe consolidation with cavitations in 3.7% and right lower lobe consolidation with cavitations in 3.7% and right lower lobe consolidation and pleural effusion in 7.4%. Table 5 showed sputum culture results, S. pneumoniae was the most common organism, it occurred in 18.5%, S. aureus in 11.1%, Influenza H1N1 in 12.9%, Klebsiella pneumonia in 7.4%, H. influenzae in 9.2%, Moraxella catarrhalis in 3.7%, Legionella species in 1.8%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 5.5%, Acinetobacter baumannii in 3.7%, and Mycobacterial tuberculosis in 1.8%. No bacterial growth occurred in 24%. Table 6 showed blood culture result of both groups, organism isolated only in (31.5%), the organisms isolated were Escherichia coli in 7.4%, S. pneumoniae in 5.5%, S. aureus in 5.5%, K. pneumonia in 5.5%, P. aeruginosa in 1.8%, and A. baumannii in 3.7%. Table 7 showed that 42.9% from patients with comorbidities needed invasive mechanical ventilation compared to 23.1% for patient without comorbidities, and 21.4% from patients with comorbidities needed non invasive mechanical ventilation compared to 19.2% for patients without comorbidity. Inotropic support needed in 21.4% of patients with comorbidities compared to 7.7% in patients without comorbidities. ICU stay was 7 ± 1.2 days for patients with comorbidities compared to 4 ± 0.9 days for patients without comorbidities. Hospital stay was 13 ± 1.5 days for patients with comorbidities compared Mortality was 100% in patients with A. baumannii multidrug resistant (MDR) pneumonia, (66.6%) in patients with P. aeruginosa pneumonia, 50% in patients with K. pneumonia, 33.3% in patients with S. aureus pneumonia, 28.5% in patients with Influenza H1N1 pneumonia, and 33% in patients with S. pneumoniae (see Table 8 , Figs. 1-4 ).
