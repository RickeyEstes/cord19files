Amino acid position 216 in PB1 of influenza A/H1N1 is a species-associated position that distinguishes between human and avian influenza viruses after the emergence of pdmH1N1 By entropy-based computational approach to characterize avian-human signatures, we have previously identified several human-associated positions on pandemic H1N1 2009 virus genome that were all within the internal genes of RdRP complex [19] . In fact, this pandemic 2009 virus strain had subsequently become a human seasonal influenza A/H1N1 strain currently circulating worldwide. We were interested in monitoring the characteristic change in amino acids that may be attributed to the emergence of pandemic 2009 virus and its current offspring of human seasonal A/H1N1. From our previous study, PB1-216 was one of the species-associated positions identified for its exclusively human-like residue Gly found in all pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses and yet, before this pandemic episode, most human influenza A/H1N1 deposited were an avian signature Ser at PB1-216 as their coexisting avian A/ H1N1 influenza viruses [19] . In contrast, regardless of pandemic impact, we observed PB1-336 of pandemic H1N1 2009 virus still remained human-like residue Ile while avian influenza H1N1 were almost an avian-associated Val [19] . This observation implies there may be a major transitioning pattern from avian to human occurred amongst different influenza A virus populations during pandemic 2009 outbreak. To further understand the significance of the point mutations PB1-S216G and PB1-V336I in pdmH1N1, we first investigated the chronological changes at these nucleotide positions between A/ H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses collected from different hosts of avian, swine, and human deposited in the Influenza Virus Database. We found that most of the avian A/H1N1 viruses contained PB1-216S and PB1-336 V both before and after 2009 (Fig. 1a) . Most of the human A/H1N1 viruses also contained the avian-associated residue, serine, at PB1-216 before 2009. However, with the emergence of pdmH1N1 in 2009, most of the human A/H1N1 viruses primarily had PB1-216G likely via genome reassortment, which thereafter remained the most prevalent residue glycine at that position. By contrast, most human A/H1N1 viruses contained the mammalian-associated residue, isoleucine, at PB1-336 both before and after 2009. Swine A/ H1N1 viruses exhibited frequent substitutions between the avian-and mammalian-associated residues at both PB1-216 and PB1-336, reflecting the susceptibility of swine to both avian and human influenza viruses and humans on the other hand can be also infected by swine influenza viruses. In A/H3N2 viruses, some substitutions between avian and mammalian signatures were readily observed at PB1-216 and PB1-336 collected from avian and swine viruses (Fig. 1b) , with essentially none of the human A/H3N2 viruses exhibiting such changes before or after the emergence of pdmH1N1. Indeed, PB1-216G was most prevalent among human A/ H3N2 viruses long before 2009. Given that the PB1 genomic segment of pdmH1N1 virus was recently acquired from a human seasonal A/H3N2 virus [3] , we examined sequences deposited before 2006 to determine whether an avian to mammalian substitution had previously occurred in human A/H3N2 viruses. We found that the PB1-S216G point mutation indeed occurred in 1993, after which PB1-216G remained the most prevalent signature in PB1 in human A/ H3N2 viruses (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). These observations suggested that the substitution from the avian-associated residue, serine, to the human-associated residue, glycine, at PB1-216 at the onset of the 2009 pandemic was the result of robust evolutionary adaptation that has impacted currently circulating seasonal human A/H1N1 viruses worldwide.
