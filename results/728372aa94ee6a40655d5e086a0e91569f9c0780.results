In total, 34 relevant sources were identified from the peer-reviewed literature and Internet search. Many authors described the infectious disease impact of mass casualty incidents and infection prevention interventions that will be required for an effective disaster response but did not specify the role an IP will play in emergency management. 6, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Although it may seem that identifying the infection prevention interventions for a disaster is the same as outlining the role an IP will play in emergency management, they are different. Some interventions that can help prevent and contain infection transmission during a disaster, such as diagnosing infectious diseases rapidly and ordering confirmatory laboratory testing, will not be performed by an IP. However, many of the strategies to prevent infection transmission in health care and community settings following a disaster will be implemented and/or coordinated by the IP. There is a lot of crossover between the role of the IP in emergency management and the components of an infection prevention program for mass casualty events. This document focuses solely on the role or tasks of an IP in emergency management, which have been divided into themes or domains.
