IFIT2 knockout mice have improved survival of disseminated C. albicans infection. To determine the role of IFIT2 during C. albicans infection, we generated mice that lack expression of the IFIT2 gene with the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) Repository. The gene targeting scheme and expression of IFIT2 in ifit2 ϩ/ϩ (WT), ifit2 ϩ/Ϫ , or ifit2 Ϫ/Ϫ (knockout [KO]) mice are shown in Fig. S1 in the supplemental material. Previous studies with an independently generated IFIT2 KO strain reported the mice are susceptible to viruses with a negative-sense RNA genome (26) . Likewise our IFIT2 KO strain displayed a decreased survival of infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Fig. S1 ). However, in contrast to their response to VSV, the IFIT2 KO mice had a different response to disseminated C. albicans relative to their WT counterparts (Fig. 1A) . IFIT2 KO mice receiving a bloodstream C. albicans inoculum of 2.5 ϫ 10 5 CFU were better able to survive the infection. Ten days postinfection (p.i.), 95% of WT animals succumbed to infection, whereas nearly 50% of IFIT2 KO mice were alive. Thirty days postinfection, only 4% of WT mice were alive in contrast to 12% of the IFIT2 KO mice. Because renal insufficiency and kidney fungal burden correlate with lethality in this sepsis model, we evaluated kidneys of WT and IFIT2 KO mice (31, 38) . Measurement of C. albicans titers in mice showed a decreased fungal burden in IFIT2 KO mice in comparison to WT mice at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection (hpi) ( Fig. 1B ; see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material). Reduced kidney fungal burden in the IFIT2 KO mice appears to be predictive of survival. Western blot analyses demonstrated a clear induction of IFIT2 protein expression in WT kidneys during C. albicans infection (Fig. S2B) . Although the average kidney weights in WT and IFIT2 KO mice were similar (Fig. S2C) , fungal growth in IFIT2 KO mice was attenuated. The initial fungal burden was similar, but by 72 hpi, prior to signs of illness, the kidneys from IFIT2 KO mice had significantly reduced C. albicans CFU by 10-fold (Fig. 1B) . C. albicans can grow as yeast or as invasive filamentous pseudohyphae and hyphae (39) . To visually compare the forms of C. albicans in infected kidneys of WT and IFIT2 KO mice, histology was performed with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining (Fig. 1C) . Although the fungal staining appeared modestly reduced in IFIT2 KO mouse kidneys 72 hpi, the filamentous forms were similar to those in WT kidneys. Immunohistochemistry with antibodies to CD45 (common leukocyte antigen) showed the inflammatory re- Four independent experiments were carried out with 3 to 4 WT and KO mice in each, and results were combined. P value determined by the log-rank test using with GraphPad Prism software. Four independent experiments were carried out. (B) C. albicans titers were measured in the kidneys of infected mice at 48 and 72 hpi and represent combined data from three independent experiments with 4 to 5 WT and KO mice. P values were determined using Student's t test (mean Ϯ standard error of the mean [SEM]).
