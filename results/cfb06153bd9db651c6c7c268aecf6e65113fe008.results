The PLP2 domain of MHV-A59 nsp3 deubiquitinates TBK1 We have previously reported that PLP2 of MHV-A59 nsp3 deubiquitinated and inactivated IRF3 to inhibit cellular IFN induction [31] . Because multiple regulatory molecules upstream of IRF3 in the IFN pathway are involved in ubiquitination and deubiquitination, especially due to the fact that TBK1 can be ubiquitinated by a cellular E3 ligase Nrdp1 [19] , we were tempted to ask whether PLP2 could target TBK1 to suppress the antiviral IFN signaling. Ubiquitination of TBK1 seemed an efficient tactic to activate IFN response because the endogenous TBK1 was K63linked poly-ubiquitinated at 8 h post Sendai virus (SeV) infection (Fig. 1A , top panel) and accompanied with phosphorylation of IRF3 and STAT1, the indications of the IFN production (Fig. 1A , panels [4] [5] . On the other hand, co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that PLP2 and its enzyme-dead mutant PLP2-C106A [31] formed a complex with TBK1 (Fig. 1B) . Further ubiquitination assay demonstrated that overexpressed TBK1 became K63-linked poly-ubiquitinated, which was effectively inhibited by a co-expressed PLP2 but not PLP2-C106A (Fig. 1C) . This was also supported by result of ubiquitination assay in MHV-A59 infection system. Using SeV as a control, MHV-A59 infection resulted in no marked K63-linked ubiquitination of TBK1 in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (Fig. S1) . Moreover, the luciferase reporter experiments showed that TBK1-driven IFN-b promoter activities were reduced by PLP2 in a dose-dependent manner, but not by PLP2-C106A (Fig. 1D) . These results indicated that PLP2 retarded the activation of TBK1 through its DUB activity. Targeting TBK1 by PLP2 is sufficient to block IFN induction PLP2 is a potent deubiquitinase that has a broad spectrum of cellular substrates as shown in Fig. 1C as well as in our previous report [31] . To exclude the potential non-specific effect by PLP2 on IFN induction, especially on those regulatory molecules upstream of TBK1 in the IFN signaling pathway, we firstly tested whether PLP2 would still inhibit TBK1-driven IFN-b promoter activities in Traf3 2/2 MEF cells. Overexpression of TBK1 in Traf3 2/2 cells could still efficiently activate IFN-b promoter, suggesting that autonomously activated TBK1 could bypass the requirement of the upstream receptor-adaptors signaling. TBK1driven IFN-b reporter activity, however, was effectively inhibited by the co-expressed PLP2 but not PLP2-C106A ( Fig. 2A) . Decreased IFN-b promoter activities correlated well to the reduced poly-ubiquitination level of TBK1 by PLP2 in Traf3 2/2 cells (Fig. 2B) . These results therefore suggested that deubiquitination of TBK1 and/or IRF3 by PLP2 would be sufficient to reduce IFN-b promoter activities. Paradoxically, PLP2 can also reduce the ubiquitination level of IRF3 to diminish its ability in IFN induction [31] . Because IRF3 activation requires TBK1 [11] , it is therefore desirable to delineate which factor, TBK1, IRF3 or both, is the primary target for PLP2. PLP2 action on IRF3 was apparently independent of TBK1, as PLP2 but not PLP2-C106A specifically inhibited IRF3-driven IFN-b promoter activities in Tbk1 2/2 cells (Fig. 2C ). This was also correlated with the reduced poly-ubiquitination level of IRF3 by PLP2 in Tbk1 2/2 MEF cells (Fig. 2D ). The apparent explanation for these results would be an advantageous strategy for coronavirus to evade the anti-viral line of defense through destructing multiple innate signaling components, e.g., TBK1 and IRF3. To determine which step of deubiquitination is causative, we first measured whether the kinase activities of TBK1 would be directly affected by PLP2 by in vitro kinase assays. Flag-TBK1 ectopically expressed in HEK293T cells in the presence of co-expressed PLP2 (WT or C106A) was affinity purified. The subsequent measurement of kinase activities using the purified C-terminal domain of IRF3 (GST-IRF3 131-426 ) as substrate showed that the presence of PLP2 but not PLP2-C106A robustly inhibited the kinase activity of TBK1 in its autophosphorylation and IRF3 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A) . The kinase activity of Flag-TBK1 immuno-purified from Traf3 2/2 MEF cells exhibited the similar dependence on PLP2 (Fig. 3B) . Therefore, deubiquitinating TBK1 was sufficient for PLP2 to down-regulate IRF3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we mixed the recombinant human TBK1 purified from insect cells with PLP2 (WT or C106A) immunopurified from HEK293T cells. Surprising enough, the recombinant TBK1 purified from insect cells was already ubiquitinated (Fig. 3C , the third panel), suggesting a conserved post-translational modification of TBK1. Pre-incubation of PLP2 reduced ubiquitination level of TBK1 and remarkably inhibited its kinase activity on IRF3 (Fig. 3C , the second panel). In contrast, addition of PLP2-C106A to the reaction did not interfere with TBK1 in phosphorylating IRF3. These results therefore suggested that deubiquitination of TBK1 by PLP2 would be sufficient to suppress type I IFN induction. PLP2 stabilizes the inactive TBK1-IRF3 complex in the cytoplasm IRF3 is directly phosphorylated by TBK1 for transcription activation [11] . We have previously reported that IRF3 forms a complex with PLP2 [31] . In this study, we further demonstrated that PLP2 also formed a complex with TBK1. Therefore a tripartite complex containing TBK1/IRF3/PLP2 would exist in cells after infection of MHV-A59. To test this hypothesis, we co-expressed a fixed amount of Flag-IRF3 and Myc-TBK1 with elevated levels of Myc-PLP2 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4A, WCL panel) . Co-immunoprecipitation using Flag antibody showed that these three components formed an immuno-complex, and increasing amounts of Myc-PLP2 recruited more Myc-TBK1 into the complex (Fig. 4A , top two panels). Intriguing enough, anti-phospho-IRF3 antibody detected a decreasing phosphorylation of IRF3 (Fig. 4A , the fifth panel). It is therefore reasonable to speculate that the presence of PLP2 deubiquitinated and inactivated TBK1, which consequently decelerated the phosphorylation of IRF3 in the complex. Hypo-phosphorylated IRF3 would have a higher affinity to TBK1 as evidenced by more TBK1 associated with unphosphorylated IRF3. The presence of PLP2 likely stabilized the complex of TBK1 and IRF3 by inhibiting the dissociation of IRF3 from TBK1. To clarify if there would be any artifact in the abovementioned co-immunoprecipitation, we then mixed the enzyme and the substrate in trans. Immunopurified Flag-TBK1 co-expressing with Myc-PLP2 (WT or C106A) was incubated with purified GST-IRF3 131-426 . Immunoprecipitation with Flag antibody (Fig. 4B ) demonstrated that GST-IRF3 131-426 interacted with hypo-ubiquitinated TBK1 (coexpressed with wild type PLP2, lane 2) more efficiently than with hyperubiquitinated TBK1 (coexpressed with PLP2-C106A, lane 3). Similarly, if immunopurified Flag-IRF3 co-expressing with Myc-PLP2 (WT or C106A) was incubated with the recombinant TBK1 (Fig. 4C ), TBK1 had a tendency to interact with hypo-ubiquitinated (coexpressed with wild type PLP2, lane 2) more efficiently than with hyper-ubiquitinated IRF3 (coexpressed with PLP2-C106A, lane 3). The above results identified a trimeric complex of overexpressed PLP2 domain with TBK1 and IRF3. To investigate whether such a complex existed in MHV-A59 infected cells, we used a MHV-A59 permissive cell line 17Cl-1 and an engineered HEK293T cell line stably expressing MHV-A59 receptor (HEK293T-mCEACAM-1) to repeat the experiment mentioned above. Immunoblotting showed that antiserum directed against PLP2 domain could detect a 60 kD protein band as early as 2 h post MHV-A59 infection, indicating most likely the appearance of a cleavage product of nsp3 that contains PLP2 domain (Fig. 5A) . To address if this PLP2 domain containing protein was also in the complex of TBK1-IRF3, we then overexpressed Flag-IRF3 in HEK293T-mCEACAM-1 cells or 17Cl-1 cells before MHV-A59 infection. Co-immunoprecipitation using Flag antibody yielded the results of Flag-IRF3 associating with the endogenous TBK1 and a viral protein positive for PLP2 antiserum in HEK293T-mCEACAM1 cells (Fig. 5B ) and 17C1-l cells (Fig. 5C ). Intriguing enough, although overexpressed IRF3 could recruit TBK1 ( Fig. 5B and C, top panel lane 2) , infection with MHV-A59 led to enhanced association of endogenous TBK1 with the complex (Fig. 5B and C, top panel  lane 4) . These results therefore strongly suggested that PLP2 domain that associated with TBK1/IRF3 complex may contribute to the suppressed IFN response via inactivation of TBK1/ IRF3 by its DUB activity in MHV-A59 infected cells. Therefore, by tempering the ubiquitination of both TBK1 and IRF3, and subsequent phosphorylation of both, PLP2 would provide a favorable steric conformation for inter-molecular interaction between inactivated TBK1 and IRF3. Such a stabilized complex would hinder the nuclear translocation of IRF3, thereby inhibit IFN induction. These results therefore provided a tentative model to explain why MHV-A59, in a broader sense for SCoV as well, fails to provoke robust IFN response either in vivo or in vitro.
