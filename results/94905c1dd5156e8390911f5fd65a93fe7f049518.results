RSV L Co-expressed with RSV P Is Biochemically Active Human RSV L was co-expressed with RSV P in Sf9 cells. The purified protein was analyzed by size exclusion chromatog-raphy, and SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the presence of both L ($250 kDa) and P ($40 kDa) in the final sample (Figure 1A) . Densitometric analysis and known oligomeric states of the proteins suggested a stoichiometry of 1:4 (L:P). To verify that the L-P complex was functional, RdRp activity was measured in an RNA template-dependent primer-extension assay. In the presence of GTP, ATP, and a 33 P-CTP, L-P incorporated 67-fold more a 33 P-CTP into the growing primer than what was detected in the control reaction ( Figure 1B ). L-P activity was also measured in a nucleotide-incorporation assay. When incubated with 33 P-GTP, the polymerase incorporated one 33 P-GMP (+1) into the primer ( Figure 1C , lane a). With the addition of 33 P-GTP and ATP, the enzyme extended the primer by three nucleotides (+3), GAA, complementary to the RNA template ( Figure 1C , lane b). When incubated with 33 P-GTP, ATP, and CTP, the enzyme extended the primer by seven nucleotides (+7), GAACAAA ( Figure 1C , lane c). As a control, RSV L-P added only four nucleotides (+4) when incubated with 33 P-GTP, ATP, and ALS-8112-TP, the active form of a known RSV polymerase nucleoside inhibitor that causes chain termination ( Figure 1C , lane d) . The nonprocessive, abortive pattern of nucleotide addition and the chain termination property of ALS-8112-TP observed with RSV L-P was consistent with results reported previously , indicating that the recombinant RSV L-P has RNAdependent RNA polymerase activity. Because the L protein harbors multiple enzymatic domains, we sought to further validate the recombinant RSV L-P protein by measuring its MTase activity. The transfer of tritiated methyl groups from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to synthetic RNA molecules derived from the 5 0 end of RSV mRNA was measured using a filter-binding assay. The L-P protein exhibited MTase activity for three synthetic GpppG RNAs of different lengths, with activity 7-to 10-fold higher than a control reaction lacking the synthetic RNAs ( Figure 1D ). Collectively, these results indicated that the recombinant L-P complex was functionally active and suitable for structural analysis by cryo-EM. Molecular weights (in kilodaltons) of the ladder are shown on the left, and the L and P bands are labeled on the right. (B) RNA synthesis activity of the RSV L-P complex was tested in a primer extension assay using an 11-mer RNA template and biotinylated 4-mer RNA primer. Primers were captured on streptavidin-coated plates, and extension was measured by incorporation of a 33 P-CTP.

Determination of the 3.2-Å Cryo-EM Structure of RSV L in Complex with Tetrameric P The L-P complex was plunge-frozen on UltrAuFoil 1.2/1.3 grids (Russo and Passmore, 2014) , and a dataset was collected using a Titan Krios equipped with a K2 Summit detector ( Figure S1 ; Table 1 ). After motion correction, contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation, 2D classification, and iterative rounds of heterogeneous 3D refinement, a total of 241,669 particles remained. Homogeneous 3D refinement of this particle stack resulted in a 3.4-Å map. After initial building of the L model and docking of the closely related human metapneumovirus (hMPV) P oligomerization domain structure into the map (Leyrat et al., 2013) , it was possible to identify the portions of the density that corresponded to the P monomers. We then generated a map in which these regions were deleted. A low-pass filter was applied to this new map as well as to the original map, and both were used as input volumes for a final round of heterogenous 3D refinement to remove particles in which the tetrameric P had dissociated. The resulting stack of 196,720 RSV L-P particles was subjected to a homogeneous, non-uniform 3D refinement that yielded the final 3.2-Å map. The low sequence identity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) L prevented use of the VSV L structure as a starting model, but this structure was used to guide manual building of RSV L. Although the sharpened map was used for the majority of model building, the C-terminal portions of two P monomers were difficult to place in this map because of over-sharpening. However, these regions were visible in the unsharpened maps; therefore, both maps were used in combination to build these regions of the polymerase complex. A total of 1,361 residues of L (residues Asn11-Leu133, Thr184-Gly618, Arg627-Ser658, and Asn690-Glu1460) were built into the 3.2-Å map ( Figure 2 ). Based on homology with the VSV L structure, residues 1-968 belong to the RdRp domain, and residues 969-1460 belong to the PRNTase (capping) domain. Although the MTase domain, connector domain (CD), and C-terminal domain (CTD) of our construct were present when analyzed by SDS-PAGE after size exclusion chromatography, and the protein exhibited MTase activity in vitro, these domains were not visible in our map ( Figure S2 ). This finding is not unexpected, however, given that the related VSV L is known to sample multiple states in which these three domains display various degrees of association with the RdRp and PRNTase domains (Rahmeh et al., 2010) . In addition to the L core, we could build portions of four discrete monomers of P, ranging in length from 53-98 residues. The longest monomer of P spans residues 131-228, corresponding to the oligomerization domain and most of the C-terminal region of P. The RSV P Tetramer Grips L Using an Unusual Tentacular Arrangement As expected from previous experiments, residues 131-151 of RSV P formed a tetrameric coiled coil (Castagné et al., 2004; Llorente et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2017) . Historically, regions outside of this oligomerization domain have not been structurally well characterized because of their intrinsic flexibility (Longhi et al., 2017) . However, the interaction of P with L stabilized ordered conformations of the C-terminal regions of P, allowing them to be resolved for the first time. Perhaps the most striking feature of the tetrameric P structure is the large degree of variation in the conformation of each of the four P monomers ( Figure 3 ) (P 1 , P 2 , P 3 , and P 4 ). These different conformations allow P to wrap around the RdRp of L in a tentacular fashion ( Figure 4 ). Although P 1 and P 4 make extensive contacts with L, P 3 makes minimal contacts with L, and P 2 interacts almost exclusively with the other P monomers. The unique organization adopted in this complex allows a relatively small region of P (less than 100 residues) to contact more than 11 regions of the primary L sequence and bury more than 4,000 Å 2 of surface area on L ( Figures 4A and 4B ). The interaction of P with L is driven by a number of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions ( Figure 4B ). The majority of electrostatic interactions are made between residues 167-179 of P 1 and the RdRp domain of L. Two positively charged P 1 residues, Arg167 and Arg174, form salt bridges with L residues Asp718 and Glu722 ( Figure 4C ). In addition, two negatively charged residues on P 1 , Glu176 and Glu179, form salt bridges with Arg523 and Lys529 on L. We predict that mutation of these residues would disrupt the L-P interaction and decrease the activity of L. Consistent with this hypothesis, two of these charged P residues (Arg174 and Glu176) have been shown previously to be critical for the activity of L in a minigenome assay (Lu et al., 2002) . In addition, a temperature-sensitive virus with an E176G substitution in P reverted the glycine to a negatively charged residue when the virus was passaged at physiological temperatures (Lu et al., 2002) . The RSV L-P structure thus provides a molecular explanation for the decreased activity of L because of these substitutions in P. The P 4 monomer, for which the largest number of residues could be built, contacts a completely different set of L residues than P 1 . Two residues on P 4 (Ile181 and Leu198) form a hydrophobic cap above Phe452 on the b6 strand of L ( Figure 4D ). Additionally, a region of P 4 forms a b-hairpin that hydrogenbonds with b6 of L to form a small b sheet ( Figure 4D ). In P 1 and P 2 , these same residues are within an a helix, and in P 3 , they are disordered, indicating that the conformation of this region of P is particularly malleable. Furthermore, at the base of the loop connecting the b strands of the P 4 hairpin, Arg163 forms a salt bridge with Glu765 of L, and the main chain of Gly165 forms a hydrogen bond with Tyr772 of L ( Figure 4D ). The C-terminal region of P 4 makes additional contacts with L, including hydrogen bonds between Asn217 of P and Asn362 and Thr365 of L, as well as hydrophobic interactions between Leu223 of P and surrounding hydrophobic residues on L ( Figure 4E ). Leu223, along with Leu216 and Leu227, are three hydrophobic residues on the C terminus of P shown previously to contribute to L binding. Mutation of these residues disrupts polymerase activity , demonstrating that these interactions between L and P, which are critical for function of the polymerase, can be explained by the structure presented here. In addition to the contacts made between P and L, extensive interactions between P monomers are also present. Contacts within the oligomerization domain were expected (Castagné et al., 2004; Llorente et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2017) , but the structure reveals that interactions between P monomers also occur outside of the oligomerization domain. The C-terminal a helices of P 2 and P 3 rest on top of P 1 to form a three-helix bundle ( Figure 4A ). In this arrangement, Ala169, Ile173, and Ile178 of P 1 are capped by hydrophobic residues on P 2 and P 3 . To validate the importance of these residues as well as of those described above, we generated a panel of 37 variants of P in which one or two residues were mutated to alanine and tested these variants in a minigenome replication assay. Variants with substitutions of residues between position 131 and 189 as well as position 205 showed less than 20% of the activity observed for wild-type P ( Figure S3 ). For the P variants with reduced activity, 16 of the substitutions mapped to regions involved in formation of the coiled coil in the oligomerization domain, 8 were in regions involved in the interaction between P and L, and 8 mapped to residues involved in the interactions between P 1 , P 2 , and P 3 that lie outside of the oligomerization domain. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the multifaceted interactions of P identified here are critical for its function in viral replication.
