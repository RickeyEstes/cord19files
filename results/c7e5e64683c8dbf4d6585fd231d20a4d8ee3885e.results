MHV packaging signal mutants are attenuated in vivo. Previously, we inserted the RNA sequence encoding a hemagglutinin (HA) tag within the PS of the nsp15 locus (shown in Fig. 1A and B). This virus, termed rA59 Nsp15-HA , replicated like wild-type virus but had increased levels of packaged sgRNA, indicating that selective packaging of gRNA was disrupted (11) . Based on these observations, we next investigated the effect of selective packaging on virulence. B6 male mice were infected with rA59 Nsp15-HA by intracranial injection and monitored for morbidity and mortality for 12 days postinfection (dpi). rA59 Nsp15-HA -infected mice had decreased weight loss and increased survival (D to F) Five-to 8-week-old male B6 mice were infected with 3 ϫ 10 4 PFU of rJHMV Nsp15-HA or rJHMV WT by intranasal inoculation. Infected mice were monitored for survival (D) and weight loss (E) for 14 dpi (rJHMV WT , n ϭ 10; rJHMV Nsp15-HA , n ϭ 15). (F) Infected brains were harvested from mice at the indicated day postinfection. Brains were homogenized in PBS, and titers of infectious virus were determined by plaque assay on HeLa-MHVR cells. (G to I) Five-to 8-week-old male B6 mice were infected with 3 ϫ 10 4 PFU of either rJHMV PSϪ or rJHMV WT by intranasal inoculation. Infected mice were monitored for survival (G) and weight loss (H) for 14 dpi (rJHMV WT , n ϭ 15; rJHMV PSϪ , n ϭ 20). (I) Infected brains were harvested from mice at the indicated day postinfection. Brains were homogenized in PBS, and titers of infectious virus were determined by plaque assay on HeLa-MHVR cells.

Coronavirus Selective Packaging Limits IFN Responses ® compared to wild-type rA59 (rA59 WT ) (see Fig. S1A and B in the supplemental material). To test whether this phenotype was strain specific, we introduced the HA sequence into nsp15 of the rJHMV strain of MHV (rJHMV Nsp15-HA ), using a previously described full-length pBAC-based reverse genetics system (12) . rJHMV Nsp15-HA had growth kinetics in vitro equivalent to that of rJHMV WT (Fig. S2A) , as previously described for rA59 Nsp15-HA-infected cells (11) . Mice infected with rJHMV Nsp15-HA had substantially decreased weight loss and increased survival ( Fig. 1D and E). While these data suggest that selective packaging is important for MHV virulence, we cannot rule out subtle effects of the HA tag on the function of nsp15 endoribonuclease, a known IFN-I antagonist. Further, addition of the HA sequence resulted in a 31-bp double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stem, which could conceivably induce an innate immune response (13, 14) . To separate the roles of nsp15 protein and of the PS in virulence, we constructed a second set of viruses with packaging defects in the context of both rA59 and rJHMV (termed PS Ϫ ), as previously described (8) . These mutants have synonymous mutations throughout the PS, which are predicted to alter the stem-loop structure of the PS without changing the amino acid sequence of nsp15 (Fig. 1C) . The growth kinetics of two independent rJHMV PSϪ clones (3.2 and 4.2) was nearly identical to that of rJHMV WT in vitro (Fig. S2B ). These data are consistent with previous results using rA59 PSϪ and indicate that the PS has few, if any, effects on replication in vitro (8) . After confirming the fitness of rJHMV PSϪ in vitro, we next assessed the virulence of rJHMV PSϪ in infected mice. B6 mice were infected intranasally with either rJHMV WT or rJHMV PSϪ and monitored for morbidity and mortality for 14 dpi. Intranasal infection of rJHMV WT resulted in nearly 100% mortality (Fig. 1G ) and substantial weight loss (Fig. 1H ). Mice infected with rJHMV PSϪ had significantly increased survival (Fig. 1G ) and reduced weight loss (Fig. 1H ). In agreement with results using rJHMV, mice infected with rA59 PSϪ also had decreased weight loss and increased survival compared to mice infected with rA59 WT (Fig. S1C and D) . We next measured the viral load of rJHMV WT , rJHMV PSϪ , and rJHMV Nsp15-HA in the brains of infected mice. Both rJHMV WT and rJHMV Nsp15-HA invaded the central nervous system (CNS) within 3 dpi and replicated to similar levels up to 5 dpi (Fig. 1F ). By 7 dpi, titers in rJHMV Nsp15-HA -infected mice were decreased in the CNS compared to those in mice infected with rJHMV WT . rJHMV Nsp15-HA was cleared by 9 dpi. rJHMV PSϪ also invaded the CNS, albeit with a delay, and reached similar peak titers as rJHMV Nsp15-HA but not rJHMV WT (Fig. 1I ). rJHMV PSϪ titers decreased on 9 dpi and were cleared by 11 dpi (Fig. 1I ). Thus, both PS mutant viruses did not reach the same peak viral titers as, and were cleared more rapidly than, wild-type JHMV. These data, utilizing two distinct PS mutant viruses, indicate that selective packaging of viral genomic RNA is essential for optimal virulence in multiple models of MHV infection. rA59 PS؊ and rA59 Nsp15-HA have increased sgRNA and cellular RNA packaged into virions. We next assessed the degree of the selective packaging defect observed in rA59 PSϪ and rA59 Nsp15-HA virions (Fig. 2 ). To accomplish this goal, the levels of positive-and negative-strand sgRNA7 (ϩsgRNA7 and -sgRNA7, respectively) and positive-strand gRNA (gRNA) were determined using concentrated virus samples prepared by velocity centrifugation of infected-cell supernatants. In agreement with previous publications (8, 11) , both rA59 PSϪ and rA59 Nsp15-HA virions had higher levels of packaged ϩsgRNA7 than gRNA compared to rA59 WT virions ( Fig. 2A) . Furthermore, the ratio of ϩsgRNA to gRNA in rA59 PSϪ and rA59 Nsp15-HA virions was nearly equivalent to the intracellular ratio in rA59 PSϪ -infected and rA59 Nsp15-HA -infected cells. This enrichment of ϩsgRNA7 to gRNA in rA59 PSϪ and rA59 Nsp15-HA virions contrasts with rA59 WT , where the ϩsgRNA7-to-gRNA ratio was dramatically decreased compared to the intracellular ratio ( Fig. 2A ). An increased ratio of ϪsgRNA7 to gRNA was also observed in rA59 PSϪ and rA59 Nsp15-HA compared to rA59 WT virions ( Fig. 2B ) but was not equivalent to the intracellular ratio of these RNAs. Finally, these increases in sgRNA7 incorporation had little effect on the levels of gRNA (Fig. 2C) , as neither rA59 PSϪ nor rA59 Nsp15-HA virions had more than an~2-fold decrease in packaged gRNA compared to rA59 WT virions. In retroviruses, the loss of gRNA packaging results in robust packaging of cellular RNA (10) . To determine the extent of cellular RNA incorporation by MHV selective packaging mutants, we measured the ratio of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) RNA to gRNA in concentrated virus and intracellular RNA samples. We found a significant increase in the HPRT-to-gRNA ratio in both rA59 PSϪ and rA59 Nsp15-HA (Fig. 2D ) compared to rA59 WT virions. However, the ratio of HPRT to gRNA in rA59 PSϪ and rA59 Nsp15-HA virions was not equivalent to the intracellular ratio of HPRT to gRNA. These data establish that rA59 PSϪ and rA59 Nsp15-HA were similarly defective in selective packaging and suggest that cellular RNA can be packaged into virions at increased levels in selective packaging mutants. rA59 PS؊ induces increased levels of IFN-I in BMMs. Because the two selective packaging mutants have similar phenotypes in vivo and similar packaging defects, we utilized only rA59 PSϪ and rJHMV PSϪ to further investigate the mechanism of PS-mediated virulence. The elevated levels of sgRNA, especially -sgRNA, in virions may act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which may be sensed during entry, replication, or packaging of PS mutants. To initially test this hypothesis, we utilized bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) because they are easily culturable, are highly susceptible to MHV, and are known to express IFN-I following infection (15) . Virions were pelleted by ultracentrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion, and viral RNA was isolated. Intracellular RNA was isolated from the 17Cl-1 monolayers using Trizol. The levels of ϩsgRNA7, ϪsgRNA7, and gRNA in concentrated virus and intracellular RNA were measured using RT-qPCR standard curves. The ratios of ϩsgRNA7 (A) and ϪsgRNA7 (B) to gRNA were calculated and plotted for viral and intracellular RNA. (C) The number of gRNA units per milliliter was calculated and plotted for each sample. (D) HPRT and gRNA were measured by RT-qPCR. Six biological replicates from two independent experiments are plotted; each experiment is plotted as either red or black. The ratio of HPRT to gRNA was calculated and plotted for viral and intracellular RNA. *, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01 by Mann-Whitney test. Coronavirus Selective Packaging Limits IFN Responses ® BMMs infected with rA59 PSϪ had an~2-to 3-fold increase in beta interferon (IFN-␤) at 12 h postinfection (hpi) compared to rA59 WT -infected BMMs (Fig. 3A) . The increased IFN-I response was not due to increased replication of rA59 PSϪ as rA59 PSϪ infection resulted in a small (~1.5-to 2-fold) reduction in gRNA (Fig. 3B ). In agreement with previous reports, we found that IFN-I production was dependent on MDA5 for both rA59 WT and rA59 PSϪ (Fig. 3C) . Furthermore, there was still a small difference (~1.5-fold) in replication of rA59 PSϪ in MDA5 Ϫ/Ϫ cells (Fig. 3D) . These results indicate that alteration of the packaging signal in MHV can lead to an enhanced innate immune response and perhaps a modest defect in replication in primary cells. IFN-I signaling is required for rJHMV PS؊ attenuation. Increased levels of IFN-I in BMMs following rA59 PSϪ infection and the well-established protective role of IFN-I signaling in MHV infection (16) suggested that IFN-I signaling would be important for rA59 PSϪ or rJHMV PSϪ attenuation. Since rJHMV was more virulent than rA59, rJHMV PSϪ was used to test this hypothesis. IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ mice were infected with rJHMV PSϪ or rJHMV WT and monitored for morbidity and mortality for 14 dpi. rJHMV WT -infected IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ mice had substantial weight loss and succumbed to infection earlier than rJHMV WT -infected wild-type mice ( Fig. 4A and B compared to Fig. 1D and G) . IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ mice infected with rJHMV PSϪ at the standard dose of 3 ϫ 10 4 PFU succumbed to infection in a manner similar to infection with rJHMV WT (Fig. 4A and B) . However, at a low dose of virus, 1 ϫ 10 3 PFU, the virulence of rJHMV PSϪ was not completely restored (Fig. S3) . The increased levels of IFN-␤ in rA59 PSϪ -infected BMMs and rescued virulence of rJHMV PSϪ in IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ mice suggest that IFN-I signaling plays an important role in the attenuation of rJHMV PSϪ . Additionally, other factors, such as delayed neuroinvasion, may also be important for the attenuation of PS Ϫ viruses. Previous work has demonstrated protective roles for MDA5 and Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) during coronavirus infection (15, 17) . Next, we utilized MAVS Ϫ/Ϫ mice to determine the role of MDA5-mediated signaling in attenuating rJHMV PSϪ . rJHMV WT caused a lethal infection in MAVS Ϫ/Ϫ mice, but rJHMV PSϪ remained attenuated, causing moderate weight loss and no decrease in survival ( Fig. 5A and B) . MHV induces significant levels of IFN-I in plasmacytoid dendritic cells via TLR7 signaling, contributing to protection (17) . To determine the role of TLR7 signaling in protection, we infected Ϫ/Ϫ mice with rJHMV PSϪ . Since the TLR7 Ϫ/Ϫ mice that were used were on a BALB/c background, we first confirmed that BALB/c mice were protected from rJHMV PSϪmediated lethality. rJHMV WT infection caused complete lethality and substantial weight loss, while rJHMV PSϪ -infected BALB/c mice had a phenotype similar to that observed in rJHMV PSϪ -infected B6 mice, with increased survival and less weight loss ( Fig. 5C and D) . TLR7 Ϫ/Ϫ mice infected with rJHMV WT succumbed to infection, while we observed no increase in weight loss or lethality after infection with rJHMV PSϪ (Fig. 5E and F) . These results suggest that neither signaling through MAVS nor that through TLR7 is solely responsible for attenuation of packaging signal mutants and suggest that initiation of IFN-I signaling occurs via alternate sensors or is multifactorial. While neither TLR7 nor MAVS signaling was solely responsible for rJHMV PSϪ attenuation, it is possible that a protective level of IFN-I was still produced in infected MAVS Ϫ/Ϫ or TLR7 Ϫ/Ϫ mice. IFNAR Ϫ/Ϫ mice are incapable of IFN-I signaling and therefore lack expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In contrast, MDA5 Ϫ/Ϫ mice infected with MHV had decreased but detectable levels of IFN-I, and the expression of many ISGs was not altered during MHV infection of MDA5 Ϫ/Ϫ mice (18) . Next, to determine if IFN-I signaling during infection was responsible for protecting mice or if basal levels of ISGs were playing a significant role, we treated MAVS Ϫ/Ϫ mice with an IFNAR-blocking antibody (19) . In these experiments, IFNAR-blocking antibody was injected intraperitoneally 6 h prior to infection and again 3 days later. Control MAVS Ϫ/Ϫ mice administered rat IgG remained protected from rJHMV PSϪ ; conversely, MAVS Ϫ/Ϫ mice administered IFNAR-blocking antibody displayed increased weight loss and succumbed to infection (Fig. 5G and H) . These data suggest that IFN-I signaling during infection is important for the attenuation of rJHMV PSϪ .
