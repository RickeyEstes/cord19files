Whole genome sequencing of HTNV using multiplex PCR-based NGS. To obtain whole genome sequence of HTNV from the patient samples, HTNV tripartite genomes were amplified by performing HTNVspecific multiplex PCR. The coverage of HTNV tripartite genomes from ROKA13-8, ROKA14-11, US8A14-2, and US8A15-1 is shown (Fig. 1) . The genomic sequence of HTNV L, M, and S segments from ROKA 13-8 was recovered up to 85.9%, 98.2%, and 100% based on full-length of the prototype HTNV 76-118 tripartite genomes, respectively. For ROKA14-11, 97.2% of HTNV L segment was obtained and the consensus sequence of HTNV M and S segments was completely obtained. The coverage of HTNV L segment from US8A14-2 was 96.1% whereas the HTNV M and S segments were completely sequenced. The genomic sequence of HTNV from US8A15-1 was acquired by 87.4%, 98.2%, and 100% for L, M, and S segments, respectively.
