Previously, overexpression of Pax3 or Pax7 was been shown to reduce the toxicity of DUX4 to C2C12 mouse myoblasts (Bosnakovski et al. 2008) . To see to what extent inhibiting p53 could similarly reduce DUX4 toxicity, we transduced iC2C12-DUX4 cells, which are immortalized mouse myoblasts engineered for doxycycline-inducible DUX4 expression, with retroviral vectors expressing several constructs known to interfere with p53: a dominant negative p53 (R175H All rights reserved.

Overexpressing cell lines were established and cells were exposed to two different doses of doxycycline, both of which resulted in significant cell killing in the absence of overexpression (empty vector control). Notably, although the positive controls, Pax3 and Pax7, protected substantially at 24 hours, cells transduced with the three p53 inhibitors did not show a reduced death rate compared to empty vector (Fig. 1 ). This indicates that in this system, p53 is not a relevant player in the cell death phenotype. We have previously generated a mouse model with a doxycycline-inducible 2.7 kb DUX4 transgene (Dandapat et al. 2014; Dandapat et al. 2016) , referred to as iDUX4[2.7]. One of the interesting features of this mouse is that the very low basal level of expression from the Tet-on promoter in the absence of doxycycline leads to various non-muscle phenotypes, especially in males, where 80% die as embryos, with the remaining 20% being severely runted and all dying before 6 weeks of age. Females are less severely affected and can thus propagate the strainbecause the transgene is X-linked, X-inactivation diminishes the phenotype in females. We reasoned that if p53 were necessary for the pathological effects of DUX4 on embryonic cell types, then on a p53 knockout background, males ought to be born at normal ratios, and ought to be relatively healthy compared to siblings with a functional copy of p53. We therefore crossed the iDUX4[2.7] transgene onto the p53 knockout background. Female carriers were obtained that were homozygous for the p53 knockout and these were bred to male p53 heterozygotes. We genotyped 65 progeny from this backcross and obtained no DUX4+ males, neither on the p53 knockout nor on the heterozygous background (Fig. 2) . Thus, absence of p53 has no effect on the pathological effects of DUX4 on development in the iDUX4[2.7] strain. Although no males were produced from the backcross described above, we did eventually obtain live born p53 iDUX4[2.7] knockout males from F1 crosses to Rosa-rtTA p53 double All rights reserved.

Thus p53 is not necessary for the pathological effects of DUX4 on non-muscle tissues. To determine whether DUX4 would be cytotoxic to muscle cells in the absence of p53, we established primary cell cultures from muscle tissue of these iDUX4[2.7] ; p53 KO animals. Primary muscle cells were sorted into myogenic and fibro-adipogenic fractions by flow cytometry for VCAM/Itga7 and PDGFRÎ±, respectively. These sorted primary cultures were then exposed to doxycycline over a series of doses to induce DUX4 expression to different levels. DUX4 expression was clearly cytopathic (Fig. 3A) and caused a dose-dependent loss of cellular viability in myoblasts (Fig. 3B) . The same was observed for fibroadipogenic progenitors (Fig.   3B ) on the p53 knockout background. Thus, in the absence of p53, DUX4 is still cytotoxic, to both myogenic and fibroadipogenic progenitors.
