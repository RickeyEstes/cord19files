Demographic characteristics of study populations are shown in Table 1 . There were no significant differences between cases and controls in age, sex, or smoking status. C. pneumoniae was isolated from the nasopharynx from 2 (1.2%) asthma patients and none from controls. C. pneumoniae was detected by PCR from 9 (5.4%) cases and one (0.9%) control. Culture positive specimens were all positive by PCR. Antibodies against C. pneumoniae are shown in Table 2 Other respiratory tract pathogen including viruses and M. pneumoniae were identified in 21 (12.5%) patients by serologic test. Fourteen (8.3%) were found to have infections with viruses (seven influenza A, three parainfluenza 3, three respiratory syncytial virus, one dual infection with influenza A, and adenovirus) and seven (4.2%) with M. pneumoniae. Dual infections of C. pneumoniae and viruses or M. pneumoniae were not observed. The results of laboratory tests and treatment of nine culture or PCR-positive patients are summarized in Table  3 . Five of nine patients who were culture or PCR positive had serologic evidence of acute infection. Three patients had stable IgG antibody titer, all of them had IgA. One had no IgG and IgA antibody. These four patients, however, had clinical and laboratory evidence of infection. All had symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection and elevation of inflammatory signs, CRP, and ESR. C. pneumoniae was successfully eradicated from the nasopharynx of all infected patients following antibiotic therapy. Five patients were treated with new macrolide antibiotics (clarithromycin in four and roxithromycin in one) and four patients with levofloxacin for 14 to 21 days (Table 3 ). All nine patients were treated with combined therapy with intravenous theophylline (in all nine patients) and 5 to 7-day courses of oral prednisone (in six patients) and antibiotics because of severe asthma attacks and achieved remission. moniae respiratory infection and acute exacerbation of asthma, and antibody titers and wheeze. In our study, exacerbations of asthma associated with C. pneumoniae were seen more often in older age groups, while exacerbations of asthma not associated with C. pneumoniae antibody were seen more often in young adults. Seroepidemiologic studies showed older patients were more likely to be having reinfections with C. pneumoniae, while younger patients were more likely to be having a primary infection. 20 In our study, most patients with acute C. pneumoniae infection had no IgM antibody titers suggesting a reinfection in these patients. The sample size in our study is too small to confirm the epidemiologic observations.
