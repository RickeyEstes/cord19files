Overall there were 1561 outbreaks filed in the Outbreak Database, in 194 of which some kind of closure had been performed as an infection control measure. The exact duration of closure was described in 32 outbreaks. In these outbreaks the median closure time was 14 days (range: 3e56 days). The distribution of the main affected medical departments and corresponding CR are shown in Table I in more detail. Highest CRs were reported from geriatric patient care (30.3%), and from orthopaedic departments (22.5%). Table II shows the CR with respect to different nosocomial pathogens. Viral infections especially, such as norovirus (44.1%) and influenza/parainfluenza virus (38.5%), were associated with closure of the unit. Only 135 of the 194 analysed outbreaks provided detailed information on the degree of closure in the particular outbreak setting. In the vast majority (94 of 135 outbreaks; 69.6%), the entire unit was closed during the epidemic. Entire facilities had been closed in outbreaks due to influenza virus (three outbreaks), SARS coronavirus (two), S. pneumoniae (two), norovirus (one), Shigella spp. (one), and rotavirus (one). Besides closure of the ward, several additional infection control measures were described. The most frequent interventions were isolation of infected or colonized patients (66.0%), screening cultures and surveillance of patients (58.0%) and staff (49.5%), as well as enforced hand hygiene (43.3%) and reprocessing of devices (sterilization or disinfection; 43.3%). Other less common infection control measures comprised education of healthcare workers (24.2%), restriction of the work load (16.5%), or vaccination if available (4.7%), e.g. for the prevention of infection by hepatitis B virus or by S. pneumoniae. Tables IIIeV summarize the data on the source of the outbreak, the mode of pathogen transmission, and the distribution of nosocomial infections that finally led to closure of the ward. CR was high especially when patients had been the source of the outbreak (16.7%; Table III ) and when the pathogen had been acquired by inhalation or by contact (18.7 and 16.5% respectively; Table IV ). The highest CR were recorded when infection of the central nervous system (24.2%) or infections of eye, ear, nose, throat or mouth (22.0%) occurred (Table V) . Apart from these two classes of infection, there was no significant difference between the average CR (12.4%) and that of any other class.
