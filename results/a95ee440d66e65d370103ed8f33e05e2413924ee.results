The human A H7N9 viruses Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 replicated effi ciently in ex-vivo cultures of the human bronchus and lung (fi gure 1). Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/ H7N9 viruses replicated similarly in bronchus, but Sh1/H7N9 replicated to signifi cantly higher titres than Sh2/H7N9 in the lung. Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 virus titres in the bronchus and lung were higher than those observed with H5N1 virus. Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 virus titres in bronchus were similar to that observed with the H1N1pdm virus, but Sh1/H7N9 replicated to higher titres in the lung. Sh1/H7N9 replicated to higher titres than NL/219/H7N7 virus, and NL/219/H7N7 replicated to higher titres than H5N1 virus, in bronchus and lung. Limited experimental replicates of ex-vivo nasopharyngeal (n=2) and tonsil (n=1) cultures restrict statistical analysis, but there was a trend suggesting productive replication of Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 in nasopharynx (appendix). Duck/H7N9 failed to replicate in any of these tissues. Sh2/H7N9 replicated in nasopharyngeal tissues at 33°C (appendix). Immunohistochemistry showed that Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses extensively infected bronchial epithelium, infecting both ciliated and non-ciliated bronchial epithelial cells (fi gure 2C, E), the extent of infection being greater than that seen with H5N1 (fi gure 2G) and other avian viruses (table 1). In the lung, Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 infected mainly type II pneumocytes (fi gure 3) and alveolar macrophages (fi gure 3 and appendix). There was no evidence of infection of vascular endothelium in the blood vessels of the lung. The duck/H7N9 virus, which diff ers in its genetic origin from the viruses causing the current human H7N9 outbreak, failed to infect or replicate in any of the human tissues tested, with the exception of occasional cells expressing viral antigen seen in the bronchial epithelium (table 1) . Treatment of turkey red blood cells with a sialidase that specifi cally cleaves the α-2,3-linked sialic acid with galactose did not have any eff ect on haemagglutination of either Sh1/H7N9 or Sh2/H7N9, whereas it completely abolished haemagglutination of H5N1 virus (table 2) . As a control, DAS181, a sialidase that cleaves both the α-2,3 and α-2,6 links of sialic acid, abolished the haemagglutination of human and avian infl uenza viruses including that of Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9. In human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages, infl uenza viral matrix ( . In parallel, H5N1 virus elicited more CCL5 and TNFα protein secretion compared with H1N1pdm (fi gure 5). Overall, the induction of proinfl ammatory cytokines by Sh1/H7N9 or Sh2/H7N9 appeared to be intermediate between those induced by H5N1 and H1N1pdm viruses. Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses both induced signifi cantly higher concentrations of CCL5 and CXCL10 mRNA than did H1N1pdm virus, but less interferon β and TNFα compared with H5N1 (fi gure 4). The mRNA expression of genes related to interferon and interferon receptor signalling in human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages after Sh1/H7N9, Sh2/H7N9, H5N1, and H1N1pdm virus infection was investigated by cDNA PCR array and expressed as foldchange over mock infected cells (appendix). Only genes that were three or more fold changes overexpressed or underexpressed relative to H1N1pdm were noted. The interferon stimulated genes MX1, ISG15, IFI35, IFI44, IFIH1, and OAS1 were eff ectively upregulated by Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 infections (data not shown). Expression of IL20RB, IFNAR1, IL20RA, IL22RA2, IL2RB, IL9R, and IRF4 were overexpressed by either Sh1/H7N9 or Sh2/H7N9 infection compared with H1N1pdm infection. IL10RB and IL4R were more downregulated by Sh1/H7N9 or Sh2/H7N9 compared with H1N1pdm. In primary human pneumocytes, replication of Sh1/ H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses (multiplicity of infection of two) were similar, as assessed by viral M-gene quantitation at 1, 6, and 24 h after infection, whereas Sh2/H7N9 had a signifi cantly higher M-gene level compared with H5N1 (p=0·05) and H1N1pdm (p=0·0346) at 24 h after infection (fi gure 6A). As expected, H5N1 virus induced signifi cantly more levels of interferon β, interleukin 29, CCL4, CCL5, and CXCL10 mRNA than did H1N1pdm virus infection. Sh1/H7N9 and/or Sh2/ H7N9 elicited signifi cantly more interferon β, interleukin 29, CCL5, and CXCL10 mRNA than did H1N1pdm virus infection. However, Sh1/H7N9 and Sh2/H7N9 viruses both elicited less interferon β, interleukin 29, and CCL5 mRNA than did H5N1 virus (fi gure 6). In virusinfected cell supernatants, H5N1 virus induced signifi cantly more CCL5 protein than did H1N1pdm, Sh1/H7N9, and Sh2/H7N9 viruses and more CXCL10 protein than did H1N1pdm (fi gure 7).
