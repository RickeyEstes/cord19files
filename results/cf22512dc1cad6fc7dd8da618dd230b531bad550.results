: All of the drugs tested produced a reduction in the number of cells eluted from the biofilms with both methods of exposure. Overall, the constant concentration method of antibiotic exposure was more effective than the exponentially decreasing concentration exposure in reducing the number of bacteria eluted from the staphylococcal biofilms. With both methods of exposure, TD-6424 was more effective than the established glycopeptides vancomycin and teicoplanin: 1.0-1.5 log 10 reduction at the end of the experiment vs. 0-0.5 log 10 reduction, respectively, in the exponentially decreasing concentration method. Conclusions: TD-6424 was the most efficient agent among those tested against both the non-GISA and GISA strains by both methods of exposure. It can be concluded that TD-6424 appears to be a promising antibiotic for the treatment of multi-drug resistant staphylococcal biofilm associated infections. Pyomyositis is a subacute bacterial infection of skeletal muscle. We report a case of pyomyositis of the right thigh and iliopsoas muscle in an intravenous drug user and present a review of the literature revealing few reported cases of community acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) pyomyositis. Methods: At the time of surgery 1 cm 3 specimens were collected by aseptic technique from deep within the tumour. Surface decontamination of tissue specimens was performed by immersion in Betadine. Specimens were subsequently bisected: Half of each was aseptically macerated, resuspended in PBS and cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on nonselective media. The remainder of each specimen was digested with proteinase K, subjected to DNA extraction, and analysed by a nested PCR-DGGE technique using universal primers. Bacteria detected by both methods were identified by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Results: A diversity of bacterial species including gram positive and negative, facultative and anaerobic species were isolated and identified using both methods. The PCR-DGGE approach detected the presence of additional species over and above those isolated by culture. Negative results from cultural and PCR analysis of washes of the tumour specimens signified that surface decontamination was successful and that the bacteria detected were from within the tumour tissue. Conclusions: A diversity of bacterial groups has been isolated from within the tissue of oral squamous carcinoma by culture and molecular means. The significance of these bacteria within the tumour tissue warrants further study. Results: A total of 394 sets of blood cultures were received in the laboratory from the liver unit during the study period. 31 (8%) were positive with 36 different organisms isolated. The most frequent isolate was coagulase-negative staphylococci (20/36, 55%) with gram-negative bacilli being next most common (13/36, 36%). Just over half (53%) of the isolates were deemed to be clinically significant. Sources of the significant organisms were intra-abdominal (11/19, 58%), catheter-related (7/19, 37%) and wound infection (1/19, 5.3%). Of the gram-negative isolates, 12/13 were considered clinically significant. Nine of these isolates (67%) were resistant to cefuroxime. Conclusions: As expected in a cohort of patients with liver disease, the most common sources of significant blood culture isolates were intra-abdominal and catheter-related. Of particular concern, two-thirds of the gram-negative organisms were resistant to cefuroxime, which is routinely prescribed in these patients. Clinical details are being reviewed with a view to possible change of the antibiotic policy in the unit. Results: Over a one month period there were 2065 hospital presentations, of which 1466 (71%) were referred to physicians, of which 1340 (91%) were due to gastroenteritis, of which 975 (73%) required hospital admission. Rates of admission for gastroenteritis were initially high at 92%, but reduced with time to 13%. Average length of stay for gastroenteritis patients was 1.65 days, which led to 1605 bed-days being occupied and bed occupancy rates in the hospital reached .90%. Hospital staff accounted for 36% of all gastroenteritis cases. The epidemic curve of all gastroenteritis cases showed a rapid increase followed by a biphasic reduction, whereas that for hospital staff cases showed a more rapid decrease. 43% of cases amongst non-hospital staff came from just 3 local units. Risk factors for gastroenteritis amongst these patients included having affected colleagues (83%), eating fresh fruit (52%), using centralised catering (47%), poor hand-washing facilities (45%) and eating pasteurised yoghurt (43%). Units with the most cases had higher than average exposure to these risk factors. Stool investigations revealed the presence of caliciviruses only. Conclusions: Gastroenteritis was a major cause of morbidity during this operation and may have had an impact on the operational effectiveness of those units affected. Further studies and changes to working practices have been initiated to prevent and control similar outbreaks in the future. Twelve patients, 12/283 (4.2%) were infected with B. cepacia complex, of these eight were BCC genomovar II, one genomovar IIIb and one genomovar IV and in two the type was unknown. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that molecular fingerprinting by PFGE is a useful and reliable epidemiological tool for investigation of outbreaks caused by multi-resistant E. cloacae. It also highlights that acquisition of ESbLs may be one of the alternate mechanisms of multi-antibiotic resistance in E. cloacae strains in addition to chromosomally encoded cephalosporinases. Methods: Retrospective analysis of presumptively infected prosthetic joints undergoing radiological biopsy to aid diagnosis in patients managed in a specialist musculoskeletal infection unit. Data were obtained by cross-referencing the Microbiology database (Sunquest, Persoft Inc.) with prospective Radiology and Histology databases. Histology was used as the criterion standard for diagnosing infection. Conclusions: Prosthetic joint biopsy is more specific than sensitive for the diagnosis of PJI. Taking multiple samples, and using prolonged culture techniques may improve sensitivity, as the sensitivity of an individual sample is only approximately 20%. We advocate taking at least two biopsy samples for culture, using prolonged incubation, and sending material for histology. The study also highlights difficulties in evaluating diagnostic tests when robust consensus definitions of infection are lacking. This study was carried out to determine accurately the incidence of sternal wound infections and permit their early diagnosis in patients following cardiothoracic surgery. Methods: A prospective observational study involving assessment of sternal wounds following cardiothoracic surgery for a three-month period was carried out. Wound assessment was based upon a wound scoring system modified from the original scoring system devised by Wilson et al., which included erythema, pain/tenderness, serous discharge, purulent discharge, wound dehiscence and positive microbiology as wound infection criteria. Each criterion was given a score of 5 except purulent discharge and positive microbiology from deep swabs or fluid/tissue, which carried a score of 10. Patients were assessed until they developed wound infection or were discharged from hospital. Risk factors were not investigated because this study was to determine the crude wound infection rate. Results: 186 patients had cardiothoracic surgery during the above period. 148 had Coronary Artery Bypass Graft operation (CABG) and 27 patients had aortic or mitral valve replacement. One patient had ventricular septal defect closure and one had aortic root replacement. The remaining patients had a combination of procedures. Nine patients were found to have wound infection giving a crude infection rate of 4.8%. The average stay in hospital following surgery was 10 days while mean duration of stay in those who developed wound infection was 32 days. The mean time to diagnose wound infection was 11 days. The microorganisms isolated were methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA), coagulase negative staphylococci and Enterococcus spp. Case Report: A 26 year old Indian man was referred to our infection unit with a one week history of fever, cough, diarrhoea and rash. He had returned from India two weeks previously. On admission he was noted to have an erythematous throat, cervical lymphadenopathy, fever and a widespread maculopapular rash on his face, arms, trunk and legs. The rash had initially appeared on his face 24 hours prior to admission. Investigations showed abnormal liver function, a CRP of 59 mg/L, a normal chest X-ray and negative malaria films. There was spontaneous resolution of fever and rash over the next 4 days. Serology for measles showed a positive measles IgM and negative measles IgG and PCR was positive for measles. Convalescent serum showed positive measles IgM and IgG. Nine days after discharge, and prior to the serological diagnosis of the initial patient, his flatmate was admitted with a similar history and clinical findings. Measles was diagnosed serologically. Both patients were students staying in halls of residence. Although a program of screening and vaccination with MMR was employed by public health one further student was admitted with serologically diagnosed measles. The cohort of students currently in higher education was born in the early 1980 s and therefore did not receive the Measles Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine, which was introduced in 1988. These students are, however, particularly susceptible to the mumps virus, as the introduction of the vaccine reduced herd immunity due to naturally circulating virus. Early in the epidemic an outbreak meeting was called, and a decision was made to offer MMR vaccination to all students. More than 7000 students were vaccinated over 4 separate days in 2 vaccination centres. No severe complications arose as a result of vaccine administration. We present an overview of the outbreak, with brief clinical vignettes of the more severe complications, plus graphs of the epidemiology of the epidemic. Background: Hepatitis A (HAV) outbreaks in the UK in the last 2 years have frequently involved injecting drug users (IDU) and active immunization of all IDU has been proposed to protect the general public health. Hepatitis A (HAV) poses extra risks when it causes superinfection in chronic hepatitis C (HCV) carriers. In Merseyside, where IDU is a common problem, HCV prevalence has been found to be as high as 67%. However little was known about HAV, making it difficult to plan vaccination guidelines for the region. Aim: To assess the rates of HAV screening in IDU in hospital based services. To document rates of natural immunity to HAV. Method: A retrospective review of laboratory databases of IDU seen in our services with positive HCV antibody tests between 1996-2003. Tabulation of HAV, Hepatitis B (HBV), and HCV was undertaken. Results: HAV serology was only performed in 381 of 2235 (17%) HCV positive IDU overall. However, the population tested rose to 112 out of 155 (72%) in those screened since 2001, when a screening policy was adopted. HAV IgG serology was positive in 219 of 381 (57.5%). Hepatitis B surface antigen was positive in 40 of 315 (13%) of those tested for both HAV and HCV. Conclusions: Hepatitis A screening rates were low before 2001 and still need to be improved. Over half of HCV positive IDU already have immunity to HAV, and this might affect cost calculations for immunization programmes that include pre-vaccination screening. Although these results are subject to ascertainment bias, the overall conclusion is likely to be similar in a prospective study. Diarrhoea is the most common infection in children resulting in the death of up to 6 million children every year. Human Rotavirus (HRV) is responsible for between 20% to 25% of these deaths. Diarrhoea is one of the main health problems in Iran, although there is no information on the pathogens involved. This study describes the aetiology of viral diarrhoea and the characteristics of HRV in Shahrekord, Iran. 259 Children ,5 ys admitted to Hajar Hospital, 245 attending primary health centres in Shahrekord, with acute diarrhoea and 114 children hospitalised for elective surgery were selected from October 2001 to August 2002. Stool samples were collected for ELISA, EM, RT-PCR and electropherotyping. 186 viruses were identified of which 146 were HRV. Ten (8.4%) HRV were identified in children without diarrhoea. The second most frequent virus was coronavirus with 16 cases, followed by calicivirus (9). Other viruses included adenovirus (8), astrovirus (6) and parvovirus (1). HRV was more frequently identified in children ,2 years old. The RT-PCR successfully typed 139 of the 146 (95%) HRV G types and 124 (85%) P types. The most frequent P type was P[8*], 61 (42%) samples, P[8] in 48 (33%), P [4] in 16 (11%) and was non P-typeable in 22 (15%). Among the G types, G1 was identified in 78 (53%), G1* in 42 (29%), G2 in 19 (13%) and was non-G-typeable in 7 (5%). HRV is the most important pathogen causing severe diarrhoea in Shahrekord and has a marked seasonal variation, being most frequently isolated from November to February (50% of HRV recovered). These results are in agreement with studies reporting a peak of HRV in the winter months ( A 29 year-old asymptomatic male intravenous drug user of six years was under the ongoing care of an addiction team when routine screening tests revealed significant elevation of liver transaminases; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was particularly elevated. Despite no known exposure to a definite HCV positive contact, there was a high index of suspicion for acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Additional risk factors were recent tatooing and recent episodes of unprotected sexual intercourse. Upon admission to hospital, hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening IgG antibody was non-reactive. However, a specimen taken on day 11 was weakly reactive, although a supplementary assay, the recombinant immunoblot assay-3 (RIBA-3), was negative. By day 15 both IgG and the RIBA-3 had become positive. Retrospective real-time, quantitative, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of RNA extracted from all of the specimens referred to above was carried out. PCR positivity 10 days prior to seroconversion was observed in this case. The patient was followed up at an outpatient clinic and after 8 weeks of remaining HCV RNA positive it was decided that he should receive combination antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Conclusions: Although this is not a controlled study, this targeted approach to antifungal prophylaxis appears to have been effective in reducing the incidence of both non-invasive and invasive FIs in children after LTx. However, the influence of changes in antibacterial policy-that may have affected both fungal colonisation and FI-are acknowledged and will be discussed. ) and desferrioxime therapy. The incidence of zygomycoses is rising due to an increase in the number of susceptible patients. Disease can be rhinocerebral, pulmonary, cutaneoarticular or disseminated. Rapidly overwhelming sepsis with a high mortality rate is usual. Survival is associated with early diagnosis, aggressive surgical debridement, high dose Amphotericin B and immunostimulation.
