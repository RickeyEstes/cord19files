The demography and characteristic profiles of the study population are summarized in Table 1 . Initial screening for anti-MERS-CoV antibodies using IgG rS1-ELISA revealed 10/4719 (0.21%) and 1/135 (0.74%) reactive samples from BD (three borderline and seven positive samples) and CC, respectively. On the other hand, 3/4 CP (75.0%) were reactive with IgG rS1-ELISA assay ( Figure 1 ; Table 2 ). Since CC samples were collected within the first week of primary case identification, samples were also tested by IgM-IIFT and all were negative. As recommended by the WHO, borderline and reactive samples were then tested for the presence of anti-MERS-CoV IgG using whole-virus and recombinant (r) S1-IIFT. Analysis with whole-virus IgG-IIFT confirmed only two (2/10) samples from BD as well as three (3/4) samples from CP. Interestingly, none (0/10) of the above BD reactive samples tested positive with neither rS1-IIFT nor ppNT assay. The positive IgG rS1-ELISA CC sample was only tested by ppNT and it was positive. All of the randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA negative BD samples were also negative by whole-virus and rS1 IgG-IIFT (Tables 3 and 4) . To determine the status of infection (recent versus older), all IgG rS1-ELISA reactive samples were further evaluated for the presence of IgM antibodies as an indication for recent infections using whole-virus IIFT (IgM-IIFT), and only one was marginally reactive and that was from a CP (Table 4 ). Strikingly, one of the 13 randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA IgG-negative BD samples from the initial screening was found reactive for IgM antibodies (using IgM-IIFT) with a titer of 320. Positivity of this sample was further confirmed with ppNT, with EC50 titer of 500 (Table 3 ). The sample was obtained from a 35-year-old Syrian citizen residing in Qatar. Discrepancies in the results obtained from different binding assays could be due to cross-reactivity with other viruses. Hence, we evaluated the cross-reactivity of rS1-ELISAreactive samples for IgG antibodies against all currently known human coronaviruses. All tested BD samples including the negative controls from the initial screening exhibited reactivity to at least 3 of 4 human coronaviruses. All rS1-ELISA-reactive samples were reactive to the four seasonal coronaviruses: 229E, HKU1, OC43-CoV, and NL63 ( Table 5 ). The reactivity was also high in the negative controls from the initial screening reaching 100% (13/13) for 229E, 92% (12/13) for HKU1 and OC43, and 84% (11/13) for NL63 (partial data is shown in Table 5 ). None of the tested BD samples were reactive to SARS-CoV using whole-virus or rS1-IIFT IgG. Similarly, all samples from CP were also highly reactive with other human coronaviruses. Interestingly, two of the CP samples had considerable reactivity to SARS-CoV with titers of 320 and 3200 using IgG rS1-IIFT (Table 5 ). Discrepancies in cross-reactivity were also observed among different serological tests for human coronaviruses. For example, one sample from CP tested negative with whole-virus IIFT IgG for HCoV-229E, but it was reactive with recombinant S1 protein of the same virus using similar assay. Similarly, two samples from CP showed reactivity to SARS-CoV in the IgG rS1-IIFT, whereas only the sample with higher antibody titer reacted with the whole-virus IgG-IIFT assay. Further, all samples from CP reacted with HKU1 spike protein in rS1-ELISA, but only two samples yielded positive reaction with the IgG rS1-IIFT (Table 5) .
