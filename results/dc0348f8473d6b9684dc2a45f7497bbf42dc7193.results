Fifty-six individuals(age≥18years) were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 13, 2020. Recent research has reported that 4 , 82·1% and 36·2% of patients had lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Overall, leukopenia was observed in 33.7% of patients. Most patients demonstrated high levels of C-reactive protein, but high levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase and D-dimer were less common. Similar characteristics were observed in all patients. Furthermore, we found that stools of 25(45%) in 56 patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2's test by RT-PCR. In addition to that, 50% of patients' counts of peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells were reduced by flow cytometric analysis. Baseline characteristics were generally similar between patients who received oral arbidol and LPV/r therapy, and those who received oral LPV/r only (Table 1) , with the exception that organ dysfunction was present in four patients who were admitted and transferred to the ICU，ten patients treated with other antiviral drugs(the data are not yet public )and no abnormal radiological findings was present in nine patients(Figure1). After excluding ineligible patients, 33 patients were included in the study. The mean age of all 33 patients was 44·56 years (SD 15·73), and 17 (52%) were men ( Table 1) An overall lung "total severity score" was reached by summing the five lobe scores. Each of the five lung lobes was assessed for degree of involvement and classified as none (0%), minimal (1 -25%), mild (26 -50%), moderate (51 -75%), or severe (76 -100%). None corresponded to a lobe score of 0, minimal to a lobe score of 1, mild to a lobe score of 2, moderate to a lobe score of 3, and severe to a lobe score of 4 [9, 10] . 5(31%) of 16 patients reached a lobe score of 4 in the combination group and 6(35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group in baseline characteristics, and there is no statistically significant differences between two groups (Table 1) . However, 1(6%)of 16 received corticosteroid therapy in the combination group compared with 7 (41%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p<0·05)( Table 2) . But, no other statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics or support measures were noted between the two groups (Tables 1, 2) . After treatment for7 days，12(75%) of 16 patients' nasopharyngeal specimens were negative for SARS-CoV-2's test by RT-PCR in the combination group , compared with 6 (35%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p<0·05, Figure 2 ). After 14 days, 15 (94%) of 16 and 9 (53%) of 17, respectively, coronavirus could not be detected (p<0·05, Figure 2 ). Furthermore, the chest CT scans were improving for 11(69%) of 16 patients in the combination group after seven days, compared with 5(29%) of 17 in the monotherapy group (p<0·05, Figure 3 ). However, three patients in the monotherapy group were still positive for the stools' test and one in the combination group (p＞0·05, Figure 3 ). No other significant differences in laboratory indices between the two groups were noted during the treatment period. During the treatment period, 68·7% of patients demonstrated elevated levels of bilirubin, mean of top bilirubin was 25·26 μmol/L (10·61 μmol/L)( Table 2 ). 43·7% of patients demonstrated digestive upsets, such as mild diarrhea and nausea, but all patients had no premature discontinuation secondary to adverse effects. Depression or acute confusion was not diagnosed in any of the patients in either group.
