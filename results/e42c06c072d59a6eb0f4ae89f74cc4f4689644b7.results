Disease status of piglets infected by HP-PRRSV was enhanced after treatment with RU486 or DEX Group A (2 mg/kg b. w. DEX) maintained a high fever (40-42Â°C) from 2 DPI (Fig. 1a) and showed symptoms of severe HP-PRRS disease, reaching 100% mortality at 14 DPI (Fig. 1b) . Similar results were observed in Group B (RU486 1 mg/kg b. w.), reaching 100% mortality at 7 DPI (Fig. 1b) . Group C showed symptoms typical of HP-PRRS infection including high fever and one piglet died as a result of HP-PRRS infection at 9 DPI. During the experiment, Groups A and Group B exhibited more severe disease than Group C, which was infected with HuN4 alone. Group D showed no symptoms during the experiment.
