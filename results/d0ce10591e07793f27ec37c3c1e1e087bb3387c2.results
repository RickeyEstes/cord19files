There were 48 people in this study. Thirty-seven (77%) of participants were female. All participants used a Kimberley Clark P2 (N95) respirator. At the threshold testing stage, four participants (8.3%) did not taste any solution. They did not proceed onto the next stage of fit testing. Of the remaining participants, at the threshold testing stage, eight (16.7%) people could taste the placebo, 43 (89.6%) could taste the commercial solution, and 44 (91.7%) could taste the homemade solution. All persons who could taste the commercial solution could taste the homemade solution. Of all who passed the threshold testing stage and who were subsequently fit tested, 40 (91%) passed the fit test. Of the four persons who failed the fit test, three could taste both the homemade and commercial solution. One person could taste the commercial product but passed using the homemade product.
