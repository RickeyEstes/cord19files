Initial search identified 62 articles: 52 articles were from Medline, 6 articles from Embase, and 4 articles from Science Direct. Of those, 32 studies were excluded: review studies (n = 16), drug synthesis and extraction (n = 3), supplemental therapy (n = 1), drug therapy in Coronavirus in general (n = 4), and site of action of different drugs modalities (n = 8). Based on the inclusions and exclusions criteria, only 30 articles were included in the final review: 13 studies were conducted in vitro, 8 studies were done in animal models, 8 studies were done in humans, and one study included both in vitro and animal model (Fig. 1 ).
