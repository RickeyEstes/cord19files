A total of 224 patients were studied. The average age of the patients was 32.4 months with a range of 3.4 months to 9.4 years. The majority of patients presented fever 87.0% and respiratory symptoms 64.8%, but only 10.5% of children requiring hospitalization. A chest radiograph was performed for 44.8% of the patients. Abnormalities were diagnosed in 25.5% of patients, including perihilar infiltrates in the 10.6% and a focal infiltrate consistent with pneumonia in 19.2%. Other symptoms reported were vomiting (28.6%), and diarrhea (12.4%). However, clinical signs, such as conjunctivitis and rash, commonly associated with adenovirus infection were relatively infrequent in our patient population. Conjunctivitis was present in 23.8% of patients, and rash was noted in the 9.5% of patients (Rocholl et al., 2004) . All specimens were assayed by culture, multiplex PCR and IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest. A specimen was considered to be a true positive when it was positive by culture or by molecular tests. Comparing the results between the viral culture and IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest, 146 patients (106 negative and 40 positive) had the same results, 68 patients were shown to be positive on IC only and ten patients were shown to be positive on viral culture only (Table 1) . McNemar 2 -test showed p < 0.0001, suggesting that these two methods had extremely statistically significant difference on the test results. In addition, consistency test showed k = 0.290 (p < 0.001), suggesting that IC Adeno Respiratory Letitest had strength of agreement to be "fair" with the virus culture in detecting Adenovirus. Comparing the results between the PCR and that IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest, 169 patients (95 negative and 74 positive) had the same results, 34 patients were shown to be positive on that IC Adeno Respiratory Letitest only and 21patients were shown to be positive on PCR only (Table 2) . McNemar 2 -test showed p = 0.1056, suggesting that two methods has no statistically significant difference on the test results. Consistency test showed k = 0.506 (p < 0.001), suggesting that IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest has moderate consistency with PCR in identifying adenovirus disease. Using PCR as the reference standard, the overall sensitivity was 77.9% and the specificity was 73.6%. The negative predictive values and the positive predictive values were for PCR 81.9% and 68.5%, respectively. Taking viral culture as the reference, the IC Adeno Respiratory Card Letitest sensitivity and specificity values were 80.0% and 60.9% and the negative predictive values and positive predictive values were 91.4% and 37.1%, respectively (Table 3) Clart Pneumovir identified 95 patients with adenovirus, 31 with bocavirus, 19 with influenza virus A (17 H3N2 and 2 H1N1), 19 with enterovirus, 20 with rhinovirus, 16 with respiratory syncytial virus (7 RSV-A and 9 RSV-B), 6 with parainfluenza virus type 3, 3 with human metapneumovirus, 3 with parainfluenza virus type 1, and 1 with parainfluenza virus type 2. The presence of viral coinfection was 44.2% (42/95): three cases of co-infection with adenovirus/rhinovirus, four with adenovirus/bocavirus, three with adenovirus/influenza A (H3N2), four with adenovirus/respiratory syncytial virus, seven with adenovirus/enterovirus, two with adenovirus/parainfluenza virus type 1, two with adenovirus/parainfluenza virus type 2, three with Adenovirus/parainfluenza virus type 3 and three with adenovirus/metapneumovirus.
