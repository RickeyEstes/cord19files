Because variation in ACE2 has been shown to act as a host species barrier [10] , we first tested if WIV1 spike could interact with Egyptian fruit bat ACE2. Single-cycle VSV luciferase reporter particles were generated with FLAG-tagged MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV or WIV1 spike ( Figure 1A ). All three coronavirus spike proteins incorporated into VSV reporter particles ( Figure 1B) . While MERS-CoV spike could only mediate entry into cells expressing DPP4, both SARS-CoV and WIV1 spikes mediated entry into cells expressing human and Egyptian fruit bat ACE2 ( Figure 1C ). Furthermore, transfection of BHK cells with either human or Egyptian fruit bat ACE2 and subsequent infection with WIV1-CoV resulted in virus replication as measured in supernatant at 48 h post infection (hpi), whereas no virus replication could be found in BHK cells not transfected with ACE2 ( Figure 1D ). Taken together, these data show that WIV1 spike can effectively utilize ACE2 from Egyptian fruit bats for entry and infection. To confirm ACE2 expression in the organs of the Egyptian fruit bats, specific staining for ACE2 was performed on nasal turbinates, trachea, lung, kidney, stomach, and intestinal tissues. ACE2 expression was identified multifocally within the nasal turbinates, apical olfactory epithelium, serous submucosal glands, and pars nervosa of the pituitary gland. Cytoplasmic endothelial cell immunoreactivity was found in lung and stomach tissue. The kidney showed expression multifocally within interstitial capillaries and parietal epithelium. Intestinal tissue showed a bright diffuse immunoreactivity at the brush border ( Figure 2 ). Together, the staining suggests necessary receptor expression to produce infection with WIV1-CoV in Egyptian fruit bats.
