The correlation between the two readers was 0.95 (P<0.001) and so an average of the two readings was used for the remainder of the calculations. Only three samples were scored as positive by one reader and negative by the other (with no consistent pattern). The average reading in all three cases was positive and so this was the result that was recorded. Seventy samples were positive by both the IFA and the Immunocomb, 24 were negative by both tests (see Fig. 3 ). Five samples with IFA titres of 10 or less (i.e. negative) gave positive Immunocomb results. Four Immunocomb negative samples had positive IFA titres. Of these four, three had an IFA titre of 20 and one had an IFA titre of 40. No sample with an IFA titre of over 80 was missed by the Immunocomb. The sensitivity was calculated to be 95% and the specificity to be 83%. Two of the three samples in which the readers disagreed were found to be false positives when tested by IFA. A comparison of the IFA titres and the Immunocomb results is shown in Fig. 4 . The Pearson correlation coefficient between the average results of the Immunocomb test obtained by the readers and the logarithm of the IFA test was 0.89 (P<0.001). No formal statistical analysis was undertaken with the six samples of ascitic fluid as there were too few samples, however, the results appeared to be very similar to those found with blood (see Fig. 5 ).
