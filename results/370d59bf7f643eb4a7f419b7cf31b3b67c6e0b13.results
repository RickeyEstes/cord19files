Replication of HRV-C15 in different culture systems for sinus epithelium Following inoculation of sinus organ cultures with purified HRV-C15 virions, the mean quantity of cell-associated HRV RNA 48-72 h post-inoculation (PI) increased by 1-1.5 log units (P¼0.078; Fig. 2A ). However, when these cells were grown in undifferentiated monolayers, viral attachment was lower and remained low over the next 48 h (P¼0.244; Fig. 2B ). Next, we tested HRV-C15 replication in epithelial cells from human sinus epithelium (HSEC) differentiated under ALI conditions. Approximately two-thirds supported HRV-C15 replication (0.5-2 logs increase in HRV RNA, Po0.05; Fig. 2C ). HRV-C15 infection did not cause notable cytopathic effects or changes to ciliary beating (data not shown).
