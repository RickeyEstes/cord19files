The majority of the newly weaned pigs suffered for at least one day from diarrhoea; but this was not related to colonization with the inoculated bacterial strain. The faecal scores for the shedding of the inoculated strain rose but this was slower compared with colonization of newborn pigs with enterotoxigenic E. coli (Fig. 1 ) . In some pigs, the increase of the faecal scores was delayed until close to the end or, exceptionally, beyond the period of housing in individual cages (Fig. 2 ) . Antimicrobial treatment had to be given to 147 pigs (Table 1 ). Fifteen pigs died or were killed with advanced signs of oedema disease. Four of these were found dead before treatment could be started, and most of the others died or were killed before the second injection. Both amoxycillin and enrofloxacin led to a rapid fall of the E. coli scores below the level of detection (Fig. 1 ) . In many pigs, the scores rose again after termination of treatment, and some pigs needed a further course of treatment. Infections by other strains of pathogenic E. coli occurred rarely and each time shortly before termination of the test period. Of the boars used in the experiment, 5 were classified as genotype ss, 1 was classified Ss, and 2 classified SS ( Table 2 ) . Nine of the sows used were classified ss, 8 were classified Ss, and 4 classified SS. From 50 matings a total of 406 pigs were weaned. Two pigs died after weaning from causes not related to the experiment and so are not included in this figure or shown in the tables. Ninety two pigs were born after ssX ss matings, of which 89 (97%) were resistant to colonization (Table 3 ) . Of 168 pigs resulting from SsXss matings 83 (49%) were found to be resistant. Of the 146 pigs originating from matings with at least one SS parent, 13 (9%) were classified resistant. The frequency histogram of the mean peak shedding scores shows some overlap between descendants from matings of different genotypes (Fig. 3 ) . No antimicrobial treatments were necessary, and no deaths occurred with the progeny of ss X ss parents (Table 1 ) . Mortality in Ss Ã— ss litters was lower than in litters from SS X .. matings.
