Of the 124 infants selected, 94 were studied after the exclusion of 30 cases (infants with clinical diagnoses or suspicion of infection by bacteria or other agents as well as those who received antibiotics). The mean age of the infants was 2.4 months (SD = 1.6) and 48% were male. The mean length of hospital stay was 4.4 days (SD = 3.6) and 14% were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Figures 3 and 4 . The HRSV A isolates formed three clusters (NA1, NA2, and ON1 genotypes); most of the HRSVA isolates were found to cluster in the ON1 genotype. The ON1 cluster included 40 isolates, the NA1 cluster included 2 isolates, and the NA2 cluster included 4 isolates. They showed a 0.004-0.113 sequence p-distance at the nucleotide level, but there was a 0.000-0.175 p-distance at the amino acid level compared to the ON1 prototype strain (JN257694). The sequenced HRSVB isolates were found to cluster in the BA genotype. The HRSV B isolates formed two subclusters, identified as the BA-9 and BA-10 genotypes. The BA-9 cluster included 10 isolates, and the BA-10 cluster included 3 isolates. They showed a 0.026-0.052 sequence p-distance at the nucleotide level, but there was a 0.045-0.084 p-distance at the amino acid level compared to the BA prototype strain (AY333362). The comparative clinical analyses included 32 infants with a HRSV single infection (22 AON1 and 10 other genotypes) and showed no significant differences between these subgroups (Table 1 ).
