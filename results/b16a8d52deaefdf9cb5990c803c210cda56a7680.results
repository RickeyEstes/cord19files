3.1. In vitro expression of pVAX1-(PEDV-S), pVAX1-(PEDV-S1) and pVAX1-(IL-18) Sequence analysis of the subcloned pVAX1-(PEDV-S), pVAX1-(PEDV-S1) and pVAX1-(IL-18) showed 100% identity with GenBank accession numbers AF353511.1 (S and S1) and U58142 (IL-18), respectively. We demonstrated by immunofluorescence assays that the pVAX1-(PEDV-S), pVAX1-(PEDV-S1) and pVAX1-(IL-18) plasmids were successfully transformed into the BHK-21 cells and expressed (Fig. 1) .
