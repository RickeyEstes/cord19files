Substrate requirements for CHIKV nsP2 protease are similar to those of SFV nsP2. CHIKV nsP2 readily cleaved GFP-10:5-Trx substrates containing short P10-P5′ sequences originating from the 1/2 and 3/4 sites but not from the 2/3 site. Consistent with the requirement of nsP3 macro-domain for 2/3 site cleavage, the longer substrate GFP-10:170 was efficiently cleaved (Fig. 1a) . Another critical determinant for 2/3 site cleavage, revealed in studies of SFV nsP2, is a requirement for the intact native N-terminus of nsP2 12 . It was found that the removal of just two amino acid residues from the N-terminus of CHIKV nsP2 almost completely abolished the processing of GFP-10:170. However, in contrast to SFV nsP2, the addition of two extra amino acid residues (Gly-Ala) to the N-terminus of CHIKV nsP2 had only a minor effect on the cleavage of GFP-10:170 (Fig. 1a) . Next, experiments were performed using fluorogenic peptide substrates. It has been demonstrated that residues P6 to P1 have a clear impact on the cleavage in the context of protein-based substrates and, most importantly, in the context of infectious virus 11, 15 . Accordingly, peptide substrates used previously have been sub-optimal, as they contained only three or four P-side residues [31] [32] [33] . Based on the above considerations, peptide substrates representing the P6-P2′ regions of 1/2 and 3/4 sites were designed. However, due to problems in peptide synthesis, we could not obtain a peptide representing the 1/2 site with required (> 90%) purity. Therefore only the substrate with the sequence LDRAGG↓ YI (designated as Short), representing the 3/4 site, was used in subsequent experiments. This substrate was processed by CHIKV nsP2, but the reaction velocity could not be saturated (Fig. 1b) . This indicated that the Short substrate was still sub-optimal. Previously, we observed that SFV nsP2 cleaves a substrate having 10 amino acid residues from the P-side more efficiently than substrates having only 6 P-side residues (our unpublished data). Therefore a longer substrate, spanning positions P10 to P5′ (DELRLDRAGG↓ YIFSS; designated as Long), was used 36 . This substrate was processed more efficiently than Short (compare Fig. 1b,c) . Importantly, the reaction velocity reached a plateau (Fig. 1d) indicating that Long peptide represents a preferred tool for functional studies. The protease domain of SFV nsP2 is capable of hydrolysing a 400-fold molar excess of a protein-based substrate in 5 min indicating a cleavage rate of ≥ 1.3 s −1 or ≥ 78 min −1 10 . This is largely comparable with data observed for many virus-encoded proteases 37 . In contrast, Saisawang and colleagues determined a k cat for CHIKV nsP2 as 0.0016 s −1 or 0.096 min −1 33 . Using a previously described assay 10 it was found that in 3 min CHIKV nsP2 was able to process approximately 1.8-fold molar excess of a substrate corresponding to the 1/2 site and approximately 14.5-fold molar excess of a substrate representing the 3/4 site (Fig. 1e) . Thus, similar to SFV nsP2, the CHIKV enzyme prefers the 3/4 substrate for cleavage in trans. However, in CHIKV the difference in cleavage efficiencies for these two substrates was considerably smaller than previously observed for SFV 10 , probably because both 1/2 and 3/4 sites of CHIKV have preferred P4 Arg residues 15 . The cleavage rate for 3/4 substrate was ≈ 0.08 s −1 or 4.8 min −1 . This activity is very similar to that observed for VEEV protease domain using similar substrates 23 and approximately 50-fold higher than reported by Saisawang and colleagues using peptide substrates 33 . Reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min and reaction products were resolved using 12% SDS-PAGE. Substrates contained either short (10:5) peptides originating from 1/2, 2/3 and 3/4 sites (left side of the panel) or a longer (10:170) region representing 2/3 site and macro domain of nsP3 (right side of the panel). Enzymes used to perform cleavage are shown above the panel. (b) Processing of Short peptide substrate. The concentration of nsP2 was kept constant (78 nM) while concentration of the substrate ranged from 1 to 50 μ M (shown above graphs); in the control reaction 15 μ M of substrate was incubated without the enzyme. The fluorescence resulting from cleavage is shown as the function of time. (c) Processing of Long peptide substrate. The experiment was performed as in panel b. (d) Enzyme kinetic constant K m was derived by plotting the initial reaction velocity on vertical axis against increasing Long peptide substrate concentration (0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 50 μ M) on horizontal axis. Inset: representative plot of EDANS fluorescence generated by treating increasing concentrations of Long peptide substrate with proteinase K (50 μ g per reaction). (e) Processing kinetics of wt nsP2 revealed using recombinant protein based substrates. Wt nsP2 was mixed with substrates corresponding to 1/2 (left panel) and 3/4 (right panel) sites using molar ratio 1:100. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C; aliquots were collected at 0 (before adding enzyme), 1, 3, 6, 15, 30, 60 and 90 min, and analysed using 10% SDS-PAGE. ImageJ program (NIH, USA) was used to quantify substrate band intensities. The values were further analysed using MS Excel software and expressed as pmol of processed substrate per pmol of nsP2 as indicated at the bottom of the figure. All experiments were repeated at least twice; data from one of reproducible experiment is shown. Finally, we performed estimation of K m and k cat using Long substrate and CHIKV nsP2 with a native N-terminus. By carrying out a protease assay with increasing concentration of Long substrate, the apparent K m was found to be 2.5 ± 0.1 μ M (Fig. 1d) . In order to estimate k cat for this reaction an approach used for SARS coronavirus 3C protease 38 taking into account secondary quenching of EDANS (5-[(2′ -aminoethyl)-amino] naphthalenesulfonic acid) fluorescence, was used. The treatment of Long peptide substrate with 20, 30 or 50 μg of proteinase K reproducibly generated comparable intensity of fluorescence indicating that the substrate was cleaved close to 100% and that proteinase K itself doesn't affect the fluorescence (Fig. 1d) . Using this calibration, the k cat of CHIKV nsP2 for cleavage of Long substrate was found to be ≈ 2.5 min −1 , similar to that observed using recombinant protein substrates. Taken together this data also indicates that unlike sub-optimal peptides, a properly designed one (such as Long) does represent a suitable substrate for CHIKV nsP2 protease. Substitution of catalytic Cys478 residue blocks the ability of nsP2 to cleave substrates corresponding to 1/2 and 3/4 sites. We mutated the proposed catalytic Cys478 residue of CHIKV nsP2 to Ala (C478A), the Ser482 residue, reported to be able to substitute for Cys478 residue 33 to Ala (S482A), and combined these mutations (C478A + S482A). We also mutated the Trp479 residue, adjacent to catalytic Cys478, to Ala (W479A). To obtain purified mutant nsP2 proteins, we first took advantage of the ability of CHIKV nsP2 to tolerate N-terminal tags. Using this approach recombinant wild type (wt) His-nsP2, His-nsP2 C478A , His-nsP2 S482A and His-nsP2 C478A+S482A were all obtained at high purity (Fig. 2a) . The identities of all of recombinant proteins were confirmed using mass-spectrometry. The purification of His-nsP2 W479A turned out to be difficult; the protein contained a substantial amount of a faster migrating contaminating protein (Fig. 2a) . No major E. coli derived protein was revealed by mass-spectrometry in His-nsP2 W479A indicating that the faster migrating protein represents truncated form(s) of His-nsP2 W479A . Next, the CD-spectra of all purified recombinant proteins were obtained and compared to each other. This analysis revealed that all these proteins were folded similarly with no detectable structural deformity from nsP2 or His-nsP2 (Fig. 2b,c) . However, His-nsP2 W479A exhibited a CD spectrum with abnormally high ellipticity (Fig. 2c ). Together with altered size-exclusion chromatography profiles (not shown) this indicates that His-nsP2 W479A most probably forms high molecular weight aggregates. Next we compared the abilities of His-tagged nsP2 proteins to cleave recombinant protein-based substrates. None of the enzymes was able to cleave recombinant protein containing a short version of the 2/3 site with detectable efficiency. His-nsP2 S482A was, however, capable of cleaving substrates containing 1/2, 3/4 and 2/3 (long) sites with efficiency similar to that of wt His-nsP2 (Fig. 3a) . His-nsP2 W479A was completely inactive, with the caveat of formation of inactive aggregates. Importantly, His-nsP2 C478A and His-nsP2 C478A+S482A were both also completely unable to cleave 1/2 and 3/4 substrates (Fig. 3a) . Surprisingly, both of these mutants were able to cleave, albeit with much reduced efficiencies (compared to wt His-nsP2), 2/3 (long) substrate (Fig. 3a) . This result highlights the unique nature of 2/3 site cleavage. Peptide substrates led to results that were identical to those obtained for the corresponding (3/4) recombinant protein based substrate: His-nsP2 C478A , His-nsP2 C478A+S482A and His-nsP2 W479A were all defective in cleavage of both Long and Short substrates while His-nsP2 and His-nsP2 S482A had similar activities (Fig. 3b) . As His-tag alters several enzymatic and non-enzymatic properties of nsP2 29 it was important to compare the activities of His-tagged nsP2 with those of non-tagged protein. Direct comparison of wt nsP2 and His-nsP2 confirmed that both proteins are active. Using recombinant protein substrates, we were unable to detect significant differences between these two enzymes (Fig. 3c) . The assay using peptide substrates revealed that His-nsP2 was slightly (< 2-fold) but reproducibly less active than wt nsP2 (Fig. 3e) . Thus, the N-terminal His-tag has a small influence on protease activity of CHIKV nsP2. Next, we introduced the S482A mutation into pET-nsP2 vector designed for production of nsP2 with authentic N-terminus via removal of the N-terminal tag by the protease activity of the protein itself 29 . NsP2 S482A was successfully purified (Fig. 2a) . This approach was not applicable for other mutant nsP2 proteins, which were clearly unable to process 1/2 and 3/4 substrates (Fig. 3a,b) . Comparison of nsP2 and nsP2 S482A in the same experiment revealed no differences in the cleavage of recombinant protein based substrates. Expectedly, both enzymes were also capable of cleaving peptide substrates; in these assays nsP2 S482A was slightly, but reproducibly, less active than wt nsP2 (Fig. 3e ). Cys478 and Trp479 residues of nsP2 are required for processing of CHIKV P1234 polyprotein. Our analysis carried out using recombinant proteins and different types of substrates shows that unlike reported recently 33 , Cys478 residue is indispensable and irreplaceable for the ability of CHIKV nsP2 to process any substrate corresponding to 1/2 and 3/4 sites. However, the used systems are artificial: in alphavirus infection the polyprotein context may affect both the activity of the enzyme and the presentation of its substrates 11 . To analyse the effects of mutations in the nsP2 active site region on the processing of CHIKV P1234 polyprotein C478A, W479A, S482A and C478A + S482A substitutions were introduced into T7-P1234 plasmid (Fig. 4a) 39 . The plasmids, together with wt T7-P1234 and T7-P1234 GAA polymerase mutant controls 39 , were transcribed/translated in vitro, CHIKV ns proteins were precipitated using antibodies against nsP1, nsP2, nsP3 and nsP4 and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The only specific translation product of T7-P12 CA 34, T7-P12 WA 34 and T7-P12 CA+SA 34 was a large polyprotein; precipitation by all four antibodies confirmed that it was P1234 (Fig. 4b) . We could not reliably detect products that could correspond to P12 and P34 polyproteins that would result from the residual processing of 2/3 site by mutant proteases. Thus, it should be concluded that protease present in P12 CA 34, P12 WA 34 and P12 CA+SA 34 polyproteins were completely inactivated. This data confirms that Ser482 cannot substitute for Cys478. The lack of processing of T7-P12 WA 34 encoded polyprotein indicates that Trp479 is also crucial for nsP2 protease activity. In contrast, all mature ns proteins were detected among the products obtained from T7-P1234, T7-P12 SA 34 and T7-P1234 GAA (Fig. 4b) . The amounts of P1234 polyprotein were typically too low Scientific RepoRts | 6:37124 | DOI: 10.1038/srep37124 to be detected; however, several processing intermediates (P123, P12, P34) were clearly identified (Fig. 4b) . Thus, the S482A substitution had no detectable effect on P1234 processing.
