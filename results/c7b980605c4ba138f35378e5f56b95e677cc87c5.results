Knockdown of USP15 results in upregulation of type I IFN. By using reporter assays in HEK293T cells to screen a pool of 162 siRNAs targeting 54 human USPs genes for the capabilities to modulate SEV-induced activation of the ISRE promoter, we found USP15 is a potential candidate in previous study 24 . To dissect the specific mechanism by which USP15 plays a role in regulating the antiviral innate immune response, we continued to knockdown cell-endogenous USP15 in HEK293T cells to explore the physiological relevance. Since siRNA pools (three siRNAs per gene) were used to conduct the selection in previous study, we firstly evaluated the knockdown effect of each siRNA. As shown in Fig. 1a , siUSP15-1 was found to have a higher efficiency to block USP15 transcription, and the protein level of USP15 was inhibited by siUSP15-1 confirmed through immunoblotting. Thus, siUSP15-1 was used in the following experiments. As displayed in Fig. 1c , the activity of IFN-β report plasmid (342.5 vs 574.5, p = 2.28E-05), transcription of endogenous IFNB1 gene (321.5 vs 660.0, p = 1.22E-05) and the production of IFN-β proteins (162.4 vs 298.9, p = 2.95 E-05) were higher in the USP15-knocked-down cells than in the control-siRNA-treated cells with Sendai virus (SEV) being the stimulus, under the condition that SEV infection had no effect on USP15 expression (Fig. 1b) . Next, we measured the effect of USP15 knockdown on ISRE, an important response element in triggering the expression of ISGs after the activation of IFN 25 . Note that knockdown of USP15 resulted in upregulation of SEV-induced activation of ISRE (207.4 vs 340.9, p = 6.78E-04) (Fig. 1d) . Further supporting the notion that USP15 impacts the downstream cascade that amplifies type I IFN expression are the data shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 , which suggest that knockdown of USP15 potentiated the SEV-induced expression of ISGs (ISG15, ISG20,  ISG54, ISG56, IP-10) . It is well known that the induction of type I IFN requires the coordinated and cooperative actions of NF-κ B and IRF3 10 . Therefore, we investigated whether USP15 is involved in the SEV-induced activation of NF-κ B and IRF3. As shown in Fig. 1e and 1f , knockdown of USP15 increased the activation of NF-κ B The mRNA and protein level of USP15 after viral infection. HEK293T cells were infected with SEV or mock infected for 16 h. And the endogenous USP15 mRNA and protein were assayed by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting. (c) Effects of USP15 knockdown on SEV-induced activation of the IFN-β promoter, IFNβ mRNA and protein levels. HEK293T cells were transfected with the IFN-β -Luc reporter plasmid (0.1 μ g) and pRL-TK plasmid (0.02 μ g), together with plasmid encoding the USP15-specific siRNAs. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were further infected with SEV or mock infected for 16 h before luciferase assays were performed. Meanwhile, the supernatants were collected for ELISA, and the total RNA was then extracted and the expression of IFNB1 was evaluated with SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR. Data are means ± SD from three independent experiments. ** indicates p ≤ 0.01. (d-f) Effects of USP15 knockdown on the activation of ISRE and the NF-κ B and IRF3 promoters. The experiments were performed as in (c), except that the ISRE-Luc, NF-κ B-Luc, and IRF3-Luc reporter plasmids were used. Data are means ± SD from three independent experiments. (g) Effects of USP15 knockdown on SEV-induced phosphorylation of NF-κ B subunit p65 and IRF3. HEK293T cells were transfected with USP15-specific siRNAs or control siRNAs for 24 h. Cells were further infected with SEV or mock infected for 16 h before immunoblots with the indicated antibodies were performed. (5.9 vs 12.9, p = 1.92E-04) and IRF3 (15.6 vs 26.5, p = 1.04E-03) through reporter assays. To further confirm the results, SEV-induced phosphorylation of NF-κ B subunit p65 and IRF3 were enhanced by the knockdown of USP15 (Fig. 1g) . Overall, these data showed that knockdown of cellular USP15 has an enhanced effect on the type I IFN signaling pathway. Overexpression of USP15 suppresses the virus-induced type I IFN signaling pathway. The observation that depletion of USP15 resulted in upregulated production of IFN prompted us to further examine the effects of USP15 overexpression on type I IFN signaling pathway. To this end, HEK293T cells were transfected with an expression construct encoding USP15, together with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the IFN-β promoter and pRL-TK and cells were further stimulated with SEV. The result showed that USP15 caused the dose-dependent inhibition of IFN-β promoter activity (Fig. 2a) . Coincident with knockdown experiments, overexpression of USP15 blocked SEV-induced transcription of endogenous IFNB1 gene (323.8 vs 135.4, p = 1.0E-04) and the production of IFN-β proteins (178.2 vs 120.6, p = 3.52E-04) (Fig. 2b) . Similarly, we observed that increasing quantities of USP15 caused the inhibition of SEV-induced activation of ISRE (Fig. 2c) , NF-κ B (Fig. 2d) , and IRF3 (Fig. 2e ) promoters, additionally, the expression of ISGs ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). We also determined whether USP15 is involved in regulation of virus-induced IFN signaling in other cell type. As observed in HEK293T cells, ectopic expression of USP15 inhibits SEV-induced IFN-β promoter activation, while knockdown of USP15 by siRNA results in upregulation of the activation of IFN-β , NF-κ B and IRF3 promoters in A549 cells, as well as the production of IFNB1 and ISGs ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Decrease of SEV-induced phosphorylation of NF-κ B subunit p65 and IRF3 (Fig. 2f) were also observed in USP15 overexpression cells. These overexpression experiments results together with those of knockdown results highlight that USP15 is involved in virus-induced type I IFN signaling by serving as a potent inhibitor. Identification of USP15 DUB activity site His286. Most DUBs exhibit a high degree of amino acid homology, predominantly in the two regions known as the cysteine (Cys) box and the histidine (His) box, which surround the catalytic Cys and His residues, respectively, and have been reported to be essential for the catalytic properties of the USPs 26 . We chose eight USPs with previously documented DUB activity [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] , and a sequence alignment showed that Cys269 and His862 of USP15 are highly conserved among all nine USPs (Fig. 3a) . Since the DUB activity of C269 has been identified 34, 35 , we tried to test whether the deubiquitinase activity of USP15 is dependent on intact catalytic residues H862, with C269 being the positive control. As shown in Fig. 3b , mutations at both sites abrogated the deubiquitinase activity of the mutant proteins. Fig. 3c presents data that further support the notion that the USP15 mutants had no deubiquitinase activity for Lys48-or Lys63-linked ubiquitin in vitro. Therefore, the catalytic activity of USP15 is dependent on His862. USP15 specifically deconjugates the ubiquitination of RIG-I. RIG-I-dependent signaling pathway plays a vital role in the recognition of virus-derived double-stranded RNAs and the induction of type I IFN 36 . During the innate antiviral immune response, ubiquitination of essential signaling components is pivotal in signal transduction 37 . Therefore, we determined whether USP15 acts as a DUB targeting RIG-I-like receptor-mediated IFN signaling. Toward this objective, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Flag-tagged RIG-I, IPS-1, TRAF3, TBK1 and hemagglutinin (HA)-USP15-WT or a catalytic mutant (USP15-C269A or USP15-H862A), and the endogenous ubiquitination of proteins were assessed with an anti-Ub antibody. The overexpression of USP15-WT, but not of the deubiquitinase-deficient mutants (USP15-C269A and USP15-H862A), significantly decreased the ubiquitination of RIG-I ( Fig. 4a ) and did not block ubiquitination of IPS-1 (Fig. 4b) , TRAF3 (Fig. 4c ) and TBK1 (Fig. 4d) , illustrating that USP15 has deubiquitination activity for RIG-I.
