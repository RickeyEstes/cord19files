The percentage of calves with adequate passive immunity transfer exceeded 90% (Table 3) and was not significantly different either between farms (P > 0.05) or among groups (P > 0.05). On average, the serum total protein concentration was not significantly different between groups (mean ± SE: 65.4 ± 1.7 and 61.6 ± 1.7 g/l for groups Eco and Conts, respectively; P > 0.05). The infectious agents related with neonatal diarrhea syndrome that were detected at repeated fecal samplings are presented in Table 3 . The percentage of animals found positive in RVA and Cryptosporidium spp. was not significantly different between groups (P > 0.05) or farms (P > 0.05). BCoV was detected only in Farm 1 and the percentage of positive animals was similar among groups (P > 0.05). Fecal shedding of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts was not significantly different between groups at any sampling day (P > 0.05). Friedman repeated measures analysis revealed that fecal shedding of oocyst was significantly reduced on days 6 and 10 compared to day 3 in Eco group (mean ranks: 2.60, 1.88 and 1.52 for days 3, 6 and 10, respectively; x 2 = 19.79, P < 0.001), whereas the reduction was not significant in the control group (mean ranks: 2.16, 2.00 and 1.84 for days 3, 6 and 10, respectively; x 2 = 1.29, P > 0.05). Average Ct values obtained from Rotavirus real-time RT-PCR were not significantly affected either by oregano oil administration (mean ± SE: 37.43 ± 1.64 and 34.53 ± 1.52 for groups Eco and Conts, respectively; P > 0.05), or by sampling day (P > 0.05), or their interactions (P > 0.05). Fecal shedding of E. coli was also not significantly affected by group (mean ± SE: 7.84 ± 0.09 and 7.92 ± 0.08 log cfu/ml for groups Eco and Conts, respectively; P > 0.05) or day of sampling (P > 0.05), or their interactions (P > 0.05). Diarrhea was recorded in 73 out of 91 calves (80.2%) that were used in the experiment ( Table 3 ). The incidence of diarrhea was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in calves receiving oregano oil (Eco group) compared to the controls (P < 0.05; Table 3 ). Within farms, the incidence of diarrhea in Farm 1 was also significantly lower in Eco group than the Conts one (P < 0.05: Table 3 ), whereas in Farms 2 and 3 no significant difference was recorded among groups (P < 0.05; Table 3 ). Thirteen out of 73 (17.8%) diarrheic calves had two episodes of diarrhea during the experimental period, without, however, the percentages being significantly different between groups (25% and 12% for Eco and Conts groups, respectively; P > 0.05). The average age of diarrhea onset was not significantly different between groups (mean ± SE: 5.89 ± 0.43 and 6.07 ± 0.45 days for groups Eco and Conts, respectively; P > 0.05). In Eco group all diarrhea cases started before day 10 and no new case was recorded between days 10 and 15 of the study. The combinations of infectious agents detected in diarrheic calves are presented in Table 4 ; the percentages of positive animals at each agent were not significantly different among groups (P > 0.05; Table 2 ). As it is shown in Table 5 , average fecal score recorded in calves throughout the experiment, average number of days that calves had diarrhea and average diarrhea index were significantly affected only by the daily administration of oregano oil and were significantly lower in Eco group compared to the controls (P < 0.05). However, fecal score on days with diarrhea was not significantly affected by the group of animals. The percentage of calves that needed treatment was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in Eco group than the controls (Table 6) . Significantly lower was also the percentage of animals that needed IV fluids and antibiotic treatment in Eco group than the Conts (P < 0.05; Table 6 ). The survival curves depicting the time until recovery at diarrhea episodes in both groups are presented in Fig. 1 . The analysis revealed that the median time until recovery was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in Eco group (3 days) compared to the controls (5 days). No death was recorded in any experimental group.
