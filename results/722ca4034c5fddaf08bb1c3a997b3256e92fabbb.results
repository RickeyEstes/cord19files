An ex-vivo experiment with marmoset lung and kidney primary cultures found that these tissues could support MERS-CoV replication; this suggested that common marmosets might be developed as a suitable animal model for MERS (Fig. 1) . Therefore, we sought to determine if intratracheal inoculation of marmosets would result in disease presentation similar to human disease. The experimental design is shown in Fig. 2 . Two pre-inoculation baseline CT's were performed to establish normal lung volumes and any pre-existing anomalies. MERS-CoV-Jordan-n3/2012 virus (MERS-JOR, Genbank KC776174) and MERS-CoV-EMC/2012 virus (MERS-EMC, Genbank JX869059) were obtained and propagated as described in Materials and Methods. To ensure that no gross cross-contamination of the MERS-CoV stocks used for the marmoset experiments occurred during preparation, the spike protein of each stock was sequenced and compared to reference sequences (Cotten et al., 2013; Frey et al., 2014) . The spike region was chosen for comparison due to high diversity associated with viral glycoproteins. Strain-specific differences found in MERS-JOR and MERS-EMC reference sequences were maintained in our stocks (Table 1) , indicating that no gross cross-contamination occurred. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were seen in our stocks, two in MERS-EMC and one in MERS-JOR. BLASTX alignments indicate that two of these SNPs lead to changes in the S2 protein sequence. The MERS-JOR stock had a T to C change at position 2636 which induced an I839T change in S2. Two changes were observed in MERS-EMC C to T at position 2604 that did not alter amino acid sequence and a C to A change at 3044 which resulted in a N1016T change in S2. Changes in the S2 region seen here are likely a result of serial passage in cell culture (Frey et al., 2014) .
