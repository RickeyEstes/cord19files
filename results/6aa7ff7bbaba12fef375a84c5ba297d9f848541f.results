Twenty-two Bulgarian and Serbian BEN patients were analyzed by NGS exome sequencing for 22 000 genes. Using the Softgenetics NextGene Software (version 2.3.3) the sequencing data were analyzed. Mutation prediction was performed by software Provean and PolyPhen-2. We discovered in total 3666 missense variants with possible deleterious/damaging effect in our patients' groups. Among them, 1849 (50%) were not annotated. In total, 980 nonsense and frameshift variants were detected in our study. Among them, 541 (55%) variants have not been annotated in human genome data base of genetic variations or no information about their frequency was available. Among the annotated variants with possible deleterious/damaging effect we did not find statistically significant difference in the frequency between BEN patients and European populations. From nonannotated variants, we selected the variants with frequency of more than 40% in BEN patients-HSPG2, CELA1, and KCNK5 (Table 1) . These mutations, alone or in combination, occur in 77% of BEN patients. The probable contribution of each of the nominated genes to the pathogenesis of BEN (according to their mutation frequency) is represented in Figure 1 . The frequencies of each of the nominated mutant genes for Bulgarian and Serbian BEN patients are given in Figure 2 . All selected variants occur with similar frequency in the Bulgarian and Serbian groups of BEN patients. The nominated variants are classified according to their function-genes involved in the constitution of basement membrane/extracellular matrix (ECM) (HSPG2 and CELA1) and gene for renal potassium transport and membrane potential (KCNK5). Figure 3 represents the distribution of the three mutant genes in all BEN patients. KCNK5 variant c.1397A>C occurs only in combination with one or two of the other variants (HSPG2 c.5239A>C and CELA1 c.9 10delC), while CELA1 variant is present as a single aberration in 6 out of 10 positive cases. In 5 of BEN patients none of these variants were found. This is probably due to the presence of other rare mutations, which did not pass the threshold criteria in our study (presented in more than 40% of the patients).
