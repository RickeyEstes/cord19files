The expression of a7 exhibits distinct spatiotemporal patterning in developing cochlear structures. Previously, we demonstrated the earliest expression of a7 in the developing embryo to be in rhombomeres 3 and 5 of the E9.0 embryo ). Thus, we initiated studies of a7 GFP staining at this time. From E9.5 through approximately E12.5, the otic and cochlear structures did not express detectable a7 GFP ( Fig. 2A and not shown, see . The earliest detected expression of a7 GFP in the cochlear structures was at E13.5 in cells of the spiral prominence (SP; Fig. 2B ). The SP retains a7 GFP expression throughout embryonic and post-natal development (see below). By E14.5 ( Fig. 2C and D) , a7 GFP expression extends to cells in the sensory domain of the lesser epithelial ridge near the site of the presumptive outer hair cells (OHC) and Deiters' cells (Morsli et al. 1998; Lanford et al. 1999; Kiernan et al. 2005a,b) . Light staining of the greater epithelium ridge was also present from E14.5 and thereafter, although this staining is inconsistently observed (Fig. 1B and C and not shown). Coincident with this expression was strong staining of pioneering efferents that become separated into individually distinguished processes as they progress through the spiral ganglion (SG) to reach the external face of this sensory domain ( Fig. 2C ; see below). The staining of the epithelial cells of the lesser epithelial ridge intensifies thereafter (e.g., E15.5 in Fig. 2E ). At this stage, expression of a7 GFP by cells of the SG was in general only weakly observed in scattered cells (Fig. 2E ). By E16.5, a7 GFP expression continues to increase in cells of the lesser epithelial ridge of the prosensory domain where OHC and Deiters' cells can now be distinguished (Fig 2F and G and insert) . Cells throughout the SG were also revealed by expression of a7 GFP by this developmental stage. Pillar cells do not express a7 GFP and there were no identifiable efferent processes labeled by the expression of this receptor at this stage or thereafter (see the following sections). the a7 gene (Chrna7) was modified using homologous recombination to add a C-terminus epitope tag (hemagglutinin [HA] ) and inserted into the 3â€² terminus of Chrna7 a reporter bicistronic internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES)-tau fusion to enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fusion protein cassette (a7 GFP ; see Methods and ). This construct was subsequently altered by replacing the tau:GFP cassette with the Cre-recombinase gene (a7 Cre ). (B, C) The visualization of the Chrna7 transcription using immunological detection of GFP compared with background. Shown are sagittal sections of the cochlear sensory structures of an E16.5 a7 GFP embryo in (B) and at greater magnification in (C). The panels on the left are stained for GFP expression (see Methods), whereas the image on the right shows an adjacent serial section that received the same staining treatment, only primary antibody was omitted. Photographs were collected at the same gain and exposure. The asterisk identifies cochlear ducts and the arrow points to the spiral prominence and the arrow head points to cell giving rise to the outer hair cells and Deiters' cells. Abbreviations are SG, spiral ganglion; and tg, trigeminal ganglion. In (B), the bar = 100 lm and in (C), the bar = 400 lm. (D) Examples of colabeling for a7 GFP (green) and anti-HA (HA) in cells associated with the spiral ganglion at E16.5. Examples of double-labeled cells are identified by with arrows. Some processes are also colabeled (arrow head). Bar = 50 lm. The pattern of a7 GFP expression in the E18.5 cochlear structure undergoes significant remodeling as both sensory hair cells and the associated supporting cells complete their differentiation ( Fig. 2H and I). This includes a decrease of a7 GFP expression by OHCs and underlying Deiters' cells that progresses away from the inner hair cells and proceeds in a basal-to-apical direction (next section). This is coincident with the appearance of signal in Hensen's cells that are most proximal to the outer line of OHCs (returned to below). Ganglionic afferent fibers ending at the base of the inner hair cells are also detected (see subsequent sections). In the postnatal mouse, as shown in the P6 cochlear sensory structure ( Fig. 2J and K), the expression of a7 GFP becomes limited to Hensen's cells immediately adjacent to the most distal OHC. Cells of the spiral ligament also acquire a7 GFP expression, while the spiral prominence remains unchanged. In the SG, the expression of a7 GFP is well established and the projections from these labeled cells can be followed to the vicinity of the inner hair cells (IHC) where their terminals appear to surround the base of the inner hair cell (IHC; Fig. 2J and K). A summary diagram illustrating the expression of the a7 GFP during these major developmental stages is shown in Fig. 2L . Remodeling of a7 GFP in the cochlear structure after E16.5 is in a basal-to-apical direction The remodeling of the sensory cell region of the cochlear structure between E16.5 and E18.5 as suggested by the progression in changing a7 GFP expression was examined further. Through E16.5, all otic structures exhibit a similar a7 GFP expression pattern (Fig. 3A) . This was not the case in the E18.5 cochlear structure where the loss of a7 GFP expression by OHC and Deiters' cells and acquisition of staining by Hensen's cells was first observed in the most basal structures and it then appears in the more apical structures successive developmental stages ( Fig. 3B and C and not shown). This generates a striking contrast in a7 GFP expression between cochlear structures at the apex relative to the base with intermediary turns, exhibiting the progressive stages of this change in a7 GFP expression (Fig. 3B ). By P4, this gradient was not evident (not shown) and the mature a7 GFP expression pattern first observed in the E18.5 basal cochlear structures was present across the entire structure. In Fig. 3D , a diagram depicts the remodeling of a7 GFP expression seen in the E18.5 developing cochlear structure. Nonsensory cells of the cochlear structure express a7 GFP As suggested by the preceding discussion, there was expression of a7 GFP by both neuronal and non-neuronal cells (Fig. 4) . This is particularly clear in the postnatal mouse (e.g., P6-P12), where the predominant expression of a7 GFP in neuronal cells was by cells of the SG (Fig. 4A) . The strongest labeling of cochlear structures was restricted to Hensen's cells and the spiral prominence ( Fig. 4A-E) . Evident at the P6 stage was a7 GFP signal in individual cells of the spiral ligament ( Fig. 4C and D) . Also evident were the extended branching that is characteristic of the morphology of type II fibrocytes located in this region (Fig. 4D ; Spicer and Schulte 1991; Sun et al. 2012 ). In the P12 cochlear structure, the branches were more abundant and form a 'feathered' structure that emanates from cell bodies defined by a7 GFP expression (Fig. 4E) . Cells of the stria vascularis or other members of the cell family composing the structures of the lateral wall and surrounding cochlear duct were not observed to express a7 GFP in these later stages of development (Fig. 4) . The expression of a7 GFP during innervation of the developing cochlear structure Innervation of cochlear sensory cells follows a series of distinct steps that were in part revealed by a7 GFP visualization (Fig. 5 ). As noted, the first detection of a7 expression was in the prominently labeled efferent processes that appear to form bundles upon entering the SG and then disperse into small solitary fibers (E14.5; Figs. 5A and 2C,D). These solitary processes exhibit a beaded structure as they proceed to the base of the developing sensory cells (Fig. 5B) . The origin of these efferent fibers was examined in serial sections of the E14.5 hind brain. These fibers appear to originate from a cell grouping in the basal brain stem caudal to trigeminal nucleus V that could be distinguished by their transient a7 GFP expression (Fig. 5C ). These cells occur in clusters (Fig. 5C insert) and their prominently labeled processes can be followed using serial section sets to the cochlear structure where they give rise to the fiber bundles and the point of dissemination associated with the SG (Fig. 5C and insert) . The anatomical location of these cells suggest that these cells are within the forming olive complex, which is consistent with the reports of pioneering fibers that originate from the developing olive complex and extend to the developing cochlea (Zuo et al. 1999 ). These fibers were not detected after E15.5. During the E15.5-16.5 period, there was essentially no labeling of neuronal processes by a7 GFP (Fig. 5D-F) . However, ongoing innervation of cochlear sensory cells was identified using peripherin labeling ( Fig. 5E ; see Simmons et al. 1996; Hafidi 1998; Huang et al. 2007) or for olivocochlear efferents that were identified by labeling for calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP; Fig. 5F , Fritzsch 2003). By E18.5, the SG a7 GFP signal was present in afferent processes that extend to the base or near vicinity of the IHCs (Fig. 5G) . At birth and thereafter (P0-P12 analyzed), the expression of a7 GFP was strongly detected in SG afferent fibers where they terminate near or at the base of IHC sensory cells ( Fig. 5H and I) . This basic pattern of a7 GFP expression was reinforced during the remaining postnatal period as fibers continue to form a dense plexus that appears to surround the base of the IHCs. The other efferent fibers not detected by a7 GFP continue to be trimmed and also associate with their final targets (Merchan-Perez and Liberman 1996; Simmons et al. 1996; Hafidi 1998; Huang et al. 2007 ). The outcome of this remodeling was evident by P12 when the SG1 afferent terminals surrounding the IHC were distinguished by strong a7 GFP staining of the terminal clusters ( Fig. 5I and inset) . This was approximately the same time hearing onset occurs in mice (~P10; Kros et al. 1998 ). Processes originating from SG cells identified by peripherin expression that were not colabeled with a7 GFP form distinct efferent terminals on or very near OHCs cells and on the terminals that end on the IHC afferent terminals identified by a7 GFP labeling ( Fig. 5I ; Huang et al. 2007 ). While not entirely evident from the images shown, not all SG cells at P12 expressed a7 GFP , suggesting this could identify a functionally distinct subpopulation ( Fig. 5I ; Happe and Morley 1998) . Again, no a7 GFP labeling of olivocochlear efferents was detected. A diagram summarizing these findings is shown in Fig. 5J . Ablation of the a7 Cre -expressing cell lineage confirms a7 GFP expression during cochlear development Although a7 GFP expression was not detected in the developing cochlear structures until E13.5 (Fig. 2B) , as reported previously the earliest a7 expression we have defined is at P9.0 in rhombomeres 3 and 5 . Because cochlear morphogenesis includes signaling from rhombomere 5 (Liang et al. 2010) , the possibility of a7 GFP contributing to the development of this structure was examined. This was done using embryos from a7 Cre mice crossed with mice harboring the conditional ROSA26-loxp (diphtheria-A toxin (DTA; termed a7 Cre: DTA ; . In these embryos, a7 Cre: DTA -expressing cells and their direct lineages were ablated, thus revealing expression that could have been be missed by a7 GFP measurements ). An example of the cochlear structure at E16.5 taken from a7 Cre:DTA crosses is shown in Fig. 6 . Because there is only occasional overlap with a7 GFP (see Fig. 5E ), we used peripherin expression to aid in examining the fate of non-a7-expressing cells (Fig. 6A and B) . The overall patterning of the cochlear structure and the formation of major boney structures of the cochlea inclusive of the otic capsule and modiolus were intact, albeit somewhat distorted. The cochlear ducts were collapsed (Fig. 6B) , probably due to the absence or severe thinning of the distal lateral wall. Also absent was the sensory cell domain Figure 5 . The a7 GFP expression during cochlear innervation. Innervation of the developing cochlear structure is revealed by a7 GFP labeling. (A) An E13.5 sagittal section shows a group of efferent processes (arrow) that distribute to solitary fibers that are strongly labeled for a7 GFP expression (arrow heads). Cells of the putative sensory region (sr) and the spiral prominence (SP) are identified. (B) At greater magnification, these fibers (arrow heads) have a beaded appearance and project towards the base of sr. (C) The possible origin of the pioneering efferent fibers is suggested by the intense expression of a7 GFP in the E13.5 cell groups (arrow) located caudal to the trigeminal sensory nucleus (V) consistent with the early olive in this horizontal section through the posterior brain stem. At increased magnification (Insert), the cell clustering (arrow) and their projections (arrowhead) are identified. Serial sections (not shown) reveal continuity between these cells and those entering the cochlear structures (arrow heads). (D) E15.5 a7 GFP expression and colabeling with other neuronal process markers (red). The processes that express peripherin (arrow) end mostly in the vicinity of the inner hair cells (IHC). Occasional solitary fibers (arrow) extend towards the base of the outer hair cells (OHC) at the dorsal boarder of the Deiters' cells (D). (E) The E16.5 cochlear innervation pattern looks much the same as E15.5, although the peripherinlabeled fibers (arrow) are more distinct. These processes lack detectable a7 GFP expression. (F) Olivocochlear efferents identified by calcitonin generelated proteins (CGRP; arrows). (G) The E18.5 embryo exhibits afferents detected by a7 GFP expression (arrows). These extend from SG cells that are not colabeled with peripherin (not shown). (H) At birth (P0), there are distinctly labeled a7 GFP afferents (arrowhead) and peripherin-labeled efferents that extend to the Deiters' cells (D) and then turn (arrows) to contact the base of the OHCs. Hensen's cells are noted (H). (I) The P12 innervation pattern is similar to the P0. In this merged image of a7 GFP expression (green) and peripherin (red), many spiral ganglion (SG) cells and processes are labeled, but the labels only rarely overlap in the same processes (see insert). The a7 GFP identify mostly processes reaching the IHCs (arrow). Peripherin-labeled processes mostly terminate at the base of the outer hair cells (OHC) or onto the a7 GFP -labeled afferent fiber near the base of the IHC. Hensen's cells expressing a7 GFP is identified (H). The inset shows the sensory cell region at increased magnification. The arrows identify the a7 GFP -expressing afferent ending at the base of nonlabeled IHC, whereas the double arrow heads point to the peripherin-labeled terminal. Other peripherin processes extend to the base of the OHCs (individual arrow heads). (J) Diagrams as in Fig. 2 depicting the basic innervation patterns observed in this study. Green is a7 GFP and red is peripherin. Afferent (af) and efferents (ef). Bars = 50 lm containing presumptive OHCs and Deiters' cells ( Fig. 6C and D), as expected from results of a7 GFP expression (Figs. 2, 5) . The SG of a7 Cre:DTA embryos is reduced in size and the majority of cells remaining give rise to mostly peripherinlabeled efferents (see Fig. 5E ). These fibers also appear to be more densely aggregated relative to the a7 GFP control mouse ( Fig. 6A and B) . While peripherin-identified processes still project to the presumptive sensory cells (both IHC and OHC), they were less branched and those that did project to the former OHC target fields often turn and proceed backwards towards the vicinity of IHCs ( Fig. 6C and D) . These results are consistent with the earliest expression of a7 being after major cochlear structures are determined, and there was the expected selective ablation of OHCs and Deiters's cells. The necessity of the presence of the target sensory cell to coordinate the innervation process is also suggested by these findings.
