Non-periodicity of recurrent influenza data. Figure 1(a,b) show the weekly consultation rates of influenza-like illness (per 1000 consultations) collected from the sentinel points involving General Practitioners (GP) ( Fig. 1(a) ) and General Out-Patient Clinics (GOPC) ( Fig. 1(b) ) under the sentinel surveillance system in Hong Kong 44 , where the data from 2009/6/13 to 2010/5/23 in (a) was not collected by the Centre. The value of C in (b) is from 0 to 150. These two sets of data are highly correlated, see Fig. 1 in SI. It means that the weekly consultation rates of influenza-like illness can well reflect the overall influenza-like illness activity. However, limited by the records, the data in Fig. 1(a,b) did not distinguish the types of influenza viruses. Fortunately, the Department of Health of Hong Kong made a classification of the influenza viruses in recent years. The Table-I Table we see that they are mainly concentrated on three kinds of typical viruses, indicating that the influenza data in Fig. 1(a,b) can represent the features of a typical influenza virus. From Fig. 1 (a,b) we interestingly find that the peak of the weekly consultation rates of influenza-like illness fails to appear in some years and the intervals between two consecutive peaks are not very regular, in contrast to the regularity of annual outbreaks reported in refs 35-41. To make it clear, we select the maximum weekly consultation rates in each year from Fig. 1(a,b) and plot them in Fig. 2(a,b) , respectively. From Fig. 2(a,b) one can easily find that the points are not distributed only in the weeks of winter or spring but distributed in most of the 52 weeks of a year, indicating the feature of non-periodicity. Is this a specific phenomenon only in Hong Kong? To figure out the answer, we have checked a large number of other recurrent influenza data and found that such phenomenon also shows up in other cities. Figure 1 (c,d) show two such examples of measles infective cases I in New York and Baltimore, respectively. It is easy to see that their outbreaks are also non-periodic, indicating that this non-periodicity is generic in recurrent influenza data. On the other hand, we find that the average of Fig. 1 (a,b) over the whole 16 years is an oscillatory behavior but not an unimodal distribution, see Fig. 2 in SI, supporting the feature of non-periodicity again. A network model to reproduce the non-periodic epidemic patterns. Epidemic spreading is usually studied by the classic epidemic models 46 such as the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model and the susceptible-infected-refractory (SIR) model. In an isolated SIS model, a susceptible node may be infected by an infected neighbor at rate β. In the meantime, each infected node will become susceptible again at rate μ at each time step. After the transient process, the system reaches a stationary state with a constant infected density I, i.e. having no decreasing process and thus no oscillatory behavior. Thus, the SIS model cannot be used to describe the recurrent epidemic patterns. Similarly, in an isolated SIR model, a susceptible node may be infected by an infected neighbor at rate β. At the same time, the infected node will decay into a refractory one with probability μ at each time step. The infection process will be over when there is no infected I, implying that the refractory density R monotonously increases but never drops down. Thus, the SIR model cannot be used to describe the recurrence of influenza data. To successfully reproduce the recurrent outbreaks, ref. 36 considered a specific SIR model with a time-dependent infected rate β ( ) t , i.e. a sinusoidal function of time t, where both the birth rate and mortality rate are included. As the mortality rate will make the refractory R decrease and the birth rate will make the susceptible S increase, thus this SIR model is in fact equivalent to the susceptible-infected-refractory-susceptible (SIRS) model 47 . This work is significant in revealing the regular outbreak of epidemic, but it fails to explain the non-periodicity observed in Figs 1 and 2. To understand the mechanism of the non-periodicity in the recurrent influenza data, we here propose a SIRS model to reproduce the epidemic patterns with non-periodicity. Figure 3 shows its schematic figure. In this model, we have included two characteristic features: one is the time-dependent infected rate β ( ) t from one year to another, i.e. piecewise constants (see Methods for details), and the other is a small natural infection rate p 0 . The former comes from the observation in Table- I in SI that the components of viruses are different from one year to another. It is well known that different viruses have different infection rates. If we use a single infection rate β to represent the comprehensive effect of all the components of viruses in one year, the value of β will be thus different from one year to another, indicating that β depends on time t and can be taken as different constants in different years. This is different from the sinusoidal function in ref. 36 . The latter comes from the fact that there is always a small fraction Fig. 1(a,b) , respectively. of naturally infected people in our society, which may come from the environment. That is, there is a small probability p 0 to generate infected seeds at each time step, in contrast to the previous models with only initial seeds. We let the network be the uncorrelated configuration model (UCM) with a power-law degree distribution ( ) Fig. 4(a) with (b) we find that the infected density ρ I cannot be sustained in (a) but can be sustained in (b), indicating that the threshold for the case of constant β is in between . , . [0 1 0 2], i.e. β . < < . 0 1 0 2 c . From Fig. 4 (c) we see that ρ I decays to zero much faster than that in Fig. 4(a) with the same β . This point can be understood as follows. Because of the fluctuation of σ = . 0 1, β ( ) t in Fig. 4 (c) will be changed around β . Once it is located in the range , . [0 0 1], ρ I will decay faster than the case of β = . 0 1 in Fig. 4(a) , resulting in the fast decaying observed in Fig. 4(c) . However, Fig. 4(d) shows a totally different picture where the recurrent behaviors of non-periodic epidemic patterns can be regenerated by a small but nonzero = . and refractory states, respectively. The parameters β, μ and δ represent the infection, refractory and recovery rates, respectively. p 0 represents the probability for a susceptible person to be naturally infected by the environment and other factors. When β is small, the infection probability of a susceptible person is proportional to both the infected neighbors I and the infection rate β. Thus, the total probability for a susceptible person to be infected is approximately β + p I 0 . At the same time, an infectious person will have a probability μ to become refractory and a refractory person will have a probability δ to recover to the susceptible. Mechanism of non-periodicity in recurrent epidemic patterns. To reveal the mechanism of the recurrent outbreaks in our network model, we show the corresponding relationship between β ( ) t and the susceptible, infected, refractory densities in Fig. 5 where the parameters are taken as β σ = . , = . 0 1 0 1 and = . p 0 01 0 . Very interestingly, we find that the largest infection rate β does not always induce the epidemic outbreak. Instead, the outbreak in Fig. 5 (c) usually occurs at those relatively larger β, see the red dashed lines in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5(a,b,d) we notice that all the red dashed lines correspond to those points with both a larger β and a larger ρ S (or a smaller ρ ) R . This is reasonable as a larger ρ S will provide enough population source for the epidemic to grow up and a larger β satisfies the condition of β β ( ) > t c . Therefore, a larger infection rate and a larger susceptible density are both the necessary conditions for the recurrent epidemic patterns with non-periodicity. Its theoretical explanation will be given in the section of Methods. Influence of network structure. One more key question is how the network topology influences the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic. To answer this question, we first consider the influence of the average degree k . Figure 6(a,b) show the numerical results of two typical cases, i.e. approximately half average degree of Fig. 4 in (a) and approximately double average degree of Fig. 4 in (b) . Comparing them with Fig. 4(d) , it is easy to see that there is much less outbreaks in Fig. 6 (a) but more outbreaks in Fig. 6(b) , indicating that larger k is in favor of the recurrent outbreaks. Secondly, we consider the influence of degree distribution, i.e. replacing the UCM network with a power-law degree distribution by an Erdös-Rényi (ER) networks with a Poisson distribution 49 . We let the constructed ER network have the same size = N 1000 and the same average degree = . k 6 5 as in Fig. 4 . Fig. 6 in SI shows the result. Comparing it with Fig. 4(d) , we see that they are similar, except that the recurrent outbreak in UCM network is slightly easier to be observed than in ER network. Furthermore, we have also checked the influence of k on ER network. Figure 6 (c) and (d) show the numerical results, corresponding to Fig. 6(a,b) . Comparing Fig. 6(a,b) with (c) and (d), respectively, we see that both (a) and (c) have only a few outbreaks while both (b) and (d) have frequent outbreaks, indicating the robustness to network topologies.
