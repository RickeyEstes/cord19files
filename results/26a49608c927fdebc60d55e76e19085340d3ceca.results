A total of 51 cases were enrolled in the study meeting the inclusion criteria, of which 7 cases were negative for viruses by PCR, while 44 children were positive for virus. Epidemiological data and co-morbid diseases were recorded in Table II. Of the 44 cases 32 (72.7%) needed PICU admission due to severe respiratory symptoms and 12 (27.3%) were admitted in hospital ward. All cases needed supplemental oxygen, while 22 (50.0%) were severe enough requiring mechanical ventilation. Of the positive cases, mortality occurred in 12 cases (23.5%). (Table II) . The prevalence of respiratory viruses is shown in (Fig. 1 ) 12 respiratory viruses were isolated. The most common respiratory virus detected was Rhinovirus (RV) in 32 patients (72.2%), then parainfluenza virus (PIV) in 12 (27.3%), of which subtypes PIV1 were 2 (4.5%) PIV3 were 5 (11.4%) and PIV4 were 5 (11.4%) cases. The third common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 9 (20.5%) cases of which 3 (6.8%) were RSVA and 6 (13.6%) were RSVB and Adenovirus in 9 cases (20.5%). Boca virus was found in 8 (18.2%) patients, corona virus 2 (4.5%) patients, influenza A virus 2 (4.5%), enterovirus 2 patients (4.5%) and finally human metapneumovirus 1 case (2.3%). The 2 cases that tested positive for influenza A virus were further subjected to influenza A sequencing and characterization and were There was no statistical significance between virus type, coinfection and comorbidity with length of hospital stay, PICU admission, mechanical ventilation or outcome of the patients. There was no significant association between coinfection (p value 0.501) and length of hospital stay, PICU stay (p value 0.487), MV (p value 0.531), nor outcome (p value 1.000). Again there was no significant relation between comorbidity and length of hospital stay (p value 0.644), PICU admission (p value 0.457), MV (p value 0.728), nor outcome (p value 0.701). There was no correlation between each virus type and parameters of disease severity (Table. III) as length of hospital stay, PICU admission, MV and death as outcome.
