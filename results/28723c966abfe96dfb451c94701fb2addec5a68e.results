lmmunoprecipitation of MHV-A59-infected cells with ORF la antisera A59-infected cells were labeled for 2 hr at late times of infection (6-8 hr). Whole-cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antisera (up28p, 81043, or 600A (see Materials and Methods) and also with monoclonal antibodies to structural proteins N ((YN) and S ((YS) (Fig. 1) . The nucleocapsid and spike proteins were easily detected at this time pi, consistent with the presence of virus-induced syncytia formation in the cell monolayer and increasing titers of MHV-A59 in the supernatant media. The polyclonal antiserum directed against a synthetic oligopeptide within the sequence coding for p28 ((~p28p) ( Table 1 ) precipitated a 28-kDa polypeptide, which migrated with the same mobility as p28 synthesized during in vitro translation of A59 genome RNA. The 28-kDa band which was detected in infected DBT cells was not precipitated by preimmune serum, LYN, or &, nor was any band of similar mobility detected by (-up28p cells. Antisera are as described in Table 1 (01p28p, 81043, and 600A). Controls include preimmune sera (Pre), Protein A-Sepharose beads without antibody (PrA), and anti-N (aN mAb) and anti-S (c&mAb) monoclonal antrbodres. Molecular mass markers are to the left of the gel and sizes of specific precipitation products are to the rrght of the gel, with arrows Indicating these products. long labeling period (2 hr) and the intensity of the label (200 &i/ml of [35S]met), only p28 was detected. No potential precursors to p28 were detected, with all larger bands being nonspecific products also precipitated by preimmune serum from infected and uninfected DBT cells. Neither antiserum 81043 nor 600A detected ~28. This was expected since they were directed against sequences encoded downstream of p28 (Table 1 , see also Fig. 6) , and indicated that none of the downstream ORF la products was a p28 containing precursor. This was in contrast to the results from in vitro translation of A59 genome RNA, in which p28-containing precursors from 160 to 250 kDa were easily detected by ap28p (Denison et al., 1991) . These results suggested that p28 was more rapidly cleaved in viva than in vitro. Antisera 81043 and 600A both detected major products with molecular masses of approximately 290 kDa (p290) and 240 kDa (~240) as well as a large, heterogeneous accumulation of radioactivity with electrophoretie mobility of greater than 400 kDa (Fig. 1) . The sizes of these proteins were determined as described under Materials and Methods, with a mean error of 10%. Antiserum 81043 detected a variety of smaller bands of approximately 168, 125, and 100 kDa. Neither cup28p nor 600A detected these polypeptides. Finally, anti-serum 81043 precipitated a polypeptide at 50 kDa (~50) which was not precipitated by cup28p. This product was variable in amount and migrated immediately above a nonspecific band between 46 and 50 kDa which was precipitated by all antisera utilized, including 81043 and 600A. P50 could only be detected as a discrete band by 8 1043 as is most clearly delineated in Figs. 3 and 5A. The detection of p50 by 81043 but not 600A suggested that p50 was either located 5'to ~240 or was a N-terminal cleavage product of a larger polyprotein spanned in part by 81043. Time of appearance of ORF la products DBT cells were infected at a high m.o.i. (50 PFU cell) at 4" for 1 hr to ensure complete, synchronous, and single cycle infection and were labeled with [35S]Met in the presence of actinomycin D for serial 1.5-hr periods from 0 to 9 hr. Syncytia were first observed on the infected cell monolayer at 6 hr pi and progressed to 90-l 00% confluency by 8 hr pi. The first products specific to ORF la were contained in a diffuse region of increased incorporation at the top of the gel, immunoprecipitated by antiserum 81043 (Fig. 2B ). This heterogeneous band was also detected using antiserum 600A, but was not precipitated by aN, or (up28p (Figs. 2A and 2C) , nor by CUS (data not shown), supporting the conclusion that this was not nonspecific aggregation of structural proteins. By 3-4.5 hr pi, this heterogeneous band of >400 kDa had increased significantly, and ~28, p290, and ~240 were readily detected. One additional polypeptide of approximately 170 kDa was precipitated by c~p28p ( Fig. 2A, 4 .5-6 hr). This band was also precipitated by preimmune rabbit serum in infected cells, at the same time point and from the same lysate (Fig. 2D ), indicating that it was a nonspecifically precipitated product, possibly S, rather than a p28 containing precursor. Additionally, it was not seen at subsequent time points, nor in any other experiments using (up28p antisera. Nucleocapsid was also observed by 3-4.5 hr pi, well before the presence of virus-induced syncytia formation. All of the MHV-specific products increased in amount during subsequent labeling periods, until 7.5-9 hr pi, when the amount of precipitated products was diminished. At this latter labeling period there was decreased cell viability and loss of syncytia from the cell monolayer. Precursor-product relationships of ORF 1 a products In order to more completely define the precursorproduct relationships among the ORF la products, pulse chase labeling of infected DBT ceils was performed at late times of infection, when synthesis of ORF 1 a products was maximal (50-600/o of monolayer involved in syncytia formation). A59-infected cells were labeled with [35S]met for 20 min and then chased with excess cold methionine for O-l 20 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with antisera (~p28p, 81043, or 600A (Fig. 3) . As in Figs. 1 and 2 , ap28p precipitated only p28 with no detectable precursors. The amount of p28 detected remained constant up to 120 min of chase, with no evidence of processing or degradation. All three antisera detected a band migrating at 278 kDa, just below the 290-kDa virus-specific ORF la product (Fig. 3, 15 min, 600A) . This was a nonspecifically precipitated cellular polypeptide, detected in infected and mock-infected cells by all antisera including preimmune serum (see also Fig. 1) . At the end of the 15-min labeling period (0 min lane), a majority of the labeled products precipitated by both 81043 and 600A were in the heterogeneous band of greater than 400 kDa. The 290-kDa band was first detected by both antisera at 15 min of chase. Subsequently, the 240-and 50-kDa products were first detected at 30 min of chase. Antiserum 600A detected the 290-and 240-kDa products, but not the 50-kDa product, consistent with the results in Figs. 1 and 2 . The sizes of these products, as well as the late, simultaneous appearance of the 240-and 50-kDa products, suggested that they were derived from the 290-kDa polypeptide by a delayed cleavage reaction (50-90 min), with p50 as the amino terminal product and ~240 as the carboxy terminal. The 168-, 125-, and lOO-kDa polypeptides detected by 81043 appeared simultaneously at O-l 5 min, suggesting that they were products of premature translation, which were not processed.
