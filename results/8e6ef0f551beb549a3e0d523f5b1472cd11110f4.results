Diversity and host range of astroviruses. The screening by pan-astrovirus RT-PCR of all 406 cloacal samples retrieved 20 individuals positive for astrovirus, representing a prevalence of 4.9%. Although our samples included birds of six different orders (Apodiformes, Columbiformes, Coraciiformes, Falconiformes, Passeriformes and Piciformes), all positive individuals were passerines. Most of the infected birds belonged to the family Thamnophilidae, but other families such as Cardinalidae, Conopophagidae, Furnariidae, Tyrannidae and Turdidae were also positive for viral infection (Table 1 ). Attempts to isolate the novel astroviruses detected here were not possible due to very limited availability of the amount of samples. Identity matrices (Fig. 1 ) showed high divergences of the four novel astroviruses from French Guianan passerine birds, compared to previously known astroviruses. Amino acid sequence identity of capsid protein (ORF2) varied from 35% to 93% within the genus Avastrovirus, but we found lower identities when we compared these four novel genomes to one another (24-29%), or when we compared them to other avastroviruses (15-36%). An ORF1b and ORF2 amino acid distance matrix analysis generated with heatmaps confirmed the clear demarcation between passerine avastroviruses and relatives of other Avastrovirus genus (Fig. 1) . Genetic distance analysis also indicated that the passerine avastroviruses can be further subgrouped into four supported clades: Passerine astrovirus 1 (PasAstV-1), Passerine astrovirus 2 (PasAstV-2), Passerine astrovirus 3 (PasAstV-3) and Passerine www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ astrovirus 4 (PasAstV-4), since distance values among these four astroviruses double the values found within the other Avastrovirus groups ( Table 2 ). The sequences of the complete genomes of the four PasAstV were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MK096773-76. The closest relative to all four PasAstV in databases was the only one passerine astrovirus described, found in a black-naped monarch. Its genome is partially sequenced and no data related to ORF2 is available, but it shows a 59-63% amino acid identity in ORF1b (RdRp) with the four PasAstV. Genomic characterization of the four pasAstV. The genomic organization of the four novel PasAstV complete genomes showed that each ORF is in a different reading frame for PasAstV-1 and PasAstV-3. ORFs 1b Each coloured cell represents the percentage identity score between two sequences. A colour key indicates the correspondence between pairwise identities and the colours displayed in the matrix. The Avastrovirus strains are colored according to the ICTV current species and our proposed new classification (see Fig. 4 ). Difference in size between the two heatmaps is due to the different availability of sequences for both ORFs in Genbank. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and 2 of PasAstV-2 are in +1 frame, while PasAstV-4 has ORF1a and ORF2 in the same frame and the ORF1b on +1 frame ( Fig. 2A) . None of them have exhibited the conserved genomic RNA promoter sequence at 5′ UTR 19 as based on the Interprosan analyses results using Geneious v11. PasAstV-2, PasAstV-3 and PasAstV-4 preserve the stem-loop structure followed by the ribosomal frame-shift heptameric signal (AAAAAAC) at the 3′ end of ORF1a like the rest of Avastrovirus. However, the setting of the ORF1a stop codon in PasAstV-1, between the stem-loop structure and the heptameric signal, shows a typical Mamastrovirus structure 19 (Fig. 2B) . Distinctive sgRNA promoter sequences (5′-AUUUGGAGNGGNGGACCNAAN-3′) were found at the 3′ end of the four ORF1b 19 . A structure similar to the stem-loop 2-like (s2m) described for astroviruses 19 was also observed at the 3′ end of PasAstV-1, PasAstV-2 and PasAstV-3, but not in PasAstV-4. Several conserved protein domains were found in each PasAstV ORF (Table S1 ) except for a hypervariable region in ORF1. The VPg sequences, with some amino acid variations, were conserved in all four novel astroviruses (Fig. 3) .
