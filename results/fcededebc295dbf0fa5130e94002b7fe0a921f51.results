We fit the Richards model to time series data of Zika case number from Yap Island (2007) Table 1 , show that only six of these 13 time series data, namely, French Polynesia, Colombia, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin and Suriname, can provide good fit with the Richards model with at least one distinct wave of cases. In particular, only Colombia and Guatemala have two waves of cases while all other data fitted only result in one wave. The model fits for these six countries/territories are given in Fig. 1 . The 95% CI from model fitting by SAS is provided, except those of the basic reproduction number R 0 , which are computed from the expression for R 0 using the 95% CI range of the estimate for r and the range of [10, 23] for T . We also give the adjusted R 2 (see, e.g., Theil, 1961) as a measure of the goodness of fit. For the purpose of comparing temporal trends and the level of synchronicity of these six countries/territories, the timelines of the waves of outbreaks are given in Fig. 2 . For a closer look at Zika outbreak in island populations, we also fit the Richards model to the weekly number of suspected Zika cases in the six main archipelagos in French Polynesia, namely, Tahiti, Iles sous-le-vent, Moorea, Tuamotu-Gambier, Marquises, and Australes, from October 30, 2013 to March 28, 2014 (Centre d'hygiène et de Salubrité publique, 2014) . The results of the fittings are given in Table 2
