In 4-week-old rats inoculated subcutaneously in the hind footpad, HEV antigen was detected initially at day 3 p.i. in the lumbar ganglia on the ipsilateral side. Positive neurons were scattered throughout the ganglia, ranging in diameter from 25 to 60 m ( Fig. 1) . Among them, about 80% showed a mediate to large size (30-50 m in diameter). HEV-infected neurons of various sizes were examined by electron microscopy for ultrastructural localization and analysis of virus particles. Since no apparent differences were found between different neuronal groups in our preparations, the results were presented together for the convenience of description.
