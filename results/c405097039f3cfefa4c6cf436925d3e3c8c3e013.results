Over the four years of the study, a total of 663 badger captures with release was made in the culling (n = 481) and non-culling (n = 182) study areas, involving 423 individual animals. The overall rate of recapture was 29.7%, being approximately equal for males and females (28.3% and 30.1% respectively). Recapture rates were also consistent between study areas, being 30.1% in the culling area and 29.1% in the non-culling control area. Over the course of the study, the estimated overall density of badgers varied between 1.2 and 6.9 badgers per km 2 in the culled population and between 3.9 and 7.1 badgers per km 2 in the control population. Culling in the treatment study area took place in November 2002 (38 animals removed from 12 setts), January 2003 (six animals removed from three setts), and August 2003 (33 animals removed from 13 setts). The estimated population density in the treatment area fell to its lowest level of 1.2 badgers per km 2 following the August 2003 cull, compared with approximately 6 badgers per km 2 in the control site and approximately 5 badgers per km 2 in the treatment site during the same season in the previous year. From our trapping records, the 77 badgers killed during culling operations amounted to between 34-43% of the badgers resident in the targeted social groups, based on the estimated number of animals within each group from our capture records.
