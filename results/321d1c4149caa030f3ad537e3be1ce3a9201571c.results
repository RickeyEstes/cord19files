The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR and the real time LightCycler assays have been reported (9, 11, 12) . A total of 3,611 respiratory, fecal, and urine specimens and 1,699 serum samples were tested for SARS-CoV RNA and antibody, respectively, from 1,048 patients for whom an initial clinical suspicion of SARS was considered. The laboratory results were retrospectively correlated with the clinical diagnoses of these patients. Clinically, 590 of these patients were considered to have clinical SARS, 79 to have suspected SARS, and 379 not to have SARS. The third group included patients hospitalized with febrile respiratory illnesses, many with radiologic changes, in whom SARS had been initially considered in the differential diagnosis. Overall, 948 (91%) of the patients had one or more specimens tested for SARS-CoV RNA by RT-PCR, and 454 (43%) had acute-and convalescent-phase serum samples available for serologic analysis, with a convalescentphase serum taken at least 21 days after onset of illness. While specimens for RT-PCR were available from similar proportions (89%-91%) of patients in each clinical category, paired sera were more frequently available from patients clinically categorized as having SARS (417 [71%] from 590) than from patients in the not SARS category (25 [7%] from 379) ( Table 1) . Of the patients clinically diagnosed as having SARS, 322 (60%) of 537 patients had evidence of SARS-CoV RNA in clinical specimens. In contrast, 2 (0.6%) of 341 of those clinically diagnosed as the "not SARS" category had RT-PCR evidence of SARS-CoV infection (Table 1) . To assess the extent of circulation of SARS-CoV in the gener-al population, 184 fecal specimens (submitted for investigation of diarrheal illnesses from patients thought not to have SARS) and 148 nose and throat swabs (from patients visiting a general practice for nonrespiratory illnesses) were tested for viral RNA by RT-PCR. None of 148 control throat swab specimens and 1 of 184 control stool specimens had evidence of detectable SARS-CoV RNA. Of 417 patients with clinical SARS for whom paired sera were available, 383 (92%) had a >4-fold rise in antibody titer to SARS-CoV. None of 45 controls had seroconversion to SARS-CoV. Two (8%) of 25 patients clinically diagnosed as the "not SARS" category seroconverted ( Table 2 ), but a further 47 convalescent-phase sera from patients in this group failed to show any more seropositive patients (data not shown). Neither of these two patients had a history of contact with other patients with SARS. However, one had a left mid-zone consolidation confirmed by high-resolution computed tomography scan and had a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia of unknown cause. The other had a mild febrile illness of unknown cause without radiologic evidence of consolidation. The profile of SARS-CoV RNA detection in the 386 patients with serologically confirmed SARS-CoV infection was analyzed (Figure) . Viral RNA was detectable in the respiratory tract of a proportion (11%-42%) of patients within the first 4 days of illness but was not detectable in stool or urine specimens until days 5 and 7 of the illness, respectively. The proportion of respiratory and stool specimens positive for viral RNA progressively increased and then peaked at approximately day 11 of the illness. While the nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat and nose swabs were the most productive specimens in the first 4 days of disease, stool samples were more useful after the 5th day of illness. Although the rate of detection in clinical specimens gradually decreased from day 16 onward, viral RNA could still be detected after 30 days of illness in samples from the nasopharynx, feces, and urine in a small proportion of patients (Figure) . Smaller numbers of saliva, endotracheal aspirate, and sputum specimens were available for testing (Table 3) . Since confirmation of a laboratory diagnosis of SARS within the first 5 days of illness is the greatest clinical need, we studied the diagnostic yield from different specimens in patients with serologically confirmed SARS-CoV infection during this period (Table 4 ). Sputum appeared to be a good clinical specimen in the early stage of the disease, although the number of specimens tested was small. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and throat and nose swabs appear to be of comparable sensitivity (30% and 28%, respectively), while stool specimens are less useful specimens in the first 5 days of illness (sensitivity 20%). Saliva and endotracheal aspirates are alternative specimens (Table 3 ), but we could not assess their usefulness because of the lack of specimens collected in the early stage of the illness. In patients whose first specimen tested negative, 25 had a second specimen (of any type) collected within the first 5 days of illness. Three of these 25 were positive; the additional diagnostic yield from a second specimen was approximately 12% (data not shown). Virus was isolated retrospectively from stored clinical specimens that were RT-PCR positive for viral RNA (Table  5 ). Virus was more readily isolated from the respiratory tract than from stool specimens. Furthermore, virus isolation was most successful during the first 2 weeks of the illness and was generally negative after day 22 of illness, even though virus was detectable in these specimens by RT-PCR.
