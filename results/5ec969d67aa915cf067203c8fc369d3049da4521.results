␤-Haemolytic streptococci were isolated from both study populations, and isolation from the BAL of household pets was markedly different from the kennelled dogs (1.4% household, 23.9% kennel, χ 2 analysis * * * P = 0.000). All ␤hS isolates were found to be S. canis or S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. Mixed infections with differing Lancefield Groups or species were not found, furthermore all individual plates yielded colonies of uniform morphology. Both S. canis and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus were isolated from the kennelled dogs, whereas only a single isolate of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus and no S. canis were isolated from the household pets. Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus was found to be the predominant ␤hS species in the kennelled dogs (92.0%). The carriage of both S. canis and S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus was examined in the kennelled dogs within each grade of clinical respiratory score (Fig. 1) . S. canis was present in dogs both with and without clinical scores, and isolation did not increase with disease severity. By contrast, healthy dogs were less likely to have S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus in the lower respiratory tract than diseased animals (χ 2 analysis, * * P = 0.004) and the isolation of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus increased dramatically with increasing clinical respiratory score, from 9.7% in dogs with no symptoms to 87.5% in those dogs with suppurative bronchopneumonia (χ 2 analysis, * * * P = 0.000). Dogs with higher respiratory scores were also more likely to have a greater mean S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus bacterial growth score than clinically healthy dogs (one way ANOVA analysis * * * P = 0.000. R 2 = 0.194, F = 22.265). The age and clinical condition of the animal on entry to the kennel had no affect on the isolation of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus (χ 2 analysis, age P = 0.341, clinical condition on entry P = 0.295). The percentage of dogs with CIRD in the kennel increased dramatically from 21.1% in week 1 to 70.1% in week 2, and CIRD did not decrease in the population until after the fourth week (Fig. 2) . Although no significant difference was detected, the number of dogs with S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus in the lung increased by 20.6% with time in the kennel from 16.7% in week 1 to 34.4% in week 3 (Fig. 2) , whereas no such trend was seen with S. canis. Histological analysis revealed that dogs with S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus were more likely to have intra-alveolar neutrophils than those without S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus (χ 2 analysis, * * P = 0.006). In dogs with higher bacterial scores, acute suppurative or necrotizing pneumonia with moderate to marked macrophage aggregation was often noted, similar to the findings of Garnett et al. (1982) in dogs with S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus induced haemorrhagic streptococcal pneumonia (HSP). No bacterial cells were apparent on H and E stained sections.
