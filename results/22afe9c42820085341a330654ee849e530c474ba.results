The median age and birth weight of the patients was 30 weeks (range: 25-35) and 1300 g (range: 720-1980) respectively. All of the RSV-positive infants were below gestational week 35 and the median age at diagnosis was 22 (range: 6-51) days. Patient characteristics are given in Table I. Among 50 preterm infants, 15 were diagnosed with RSV and five died (33%). Ten of the 15 infected patients were treated with ribavirin 15 mg/kg for 3-5 days. All except one received a combination of supportive treatments including salbutamol, caffeine, budesonide, inhaled nitric oxide, systemic corticosteroids and clarithromycin. One infant, who had mild upper respiratory symptoms, received oxygen without any other medication and recovered within a few days. Those patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (N Â¼ 5) received surfactant as rescue treatment. The five patients who died had a median treatment duration of 8 (4-12) days after the diagnosis of RSV infection. The gestational age of these infants was 30 weeks and one had bacterial sepsis in addition to RSV infection. Tests for other viruses were negative. The similar clinical course of all the infants who died, i.e. rapid deterioration with increased oxygen demand, development of pneumonia and ARDS, suggested that the deaths were associated with superseding RSV infection. The protection rate of palivizumab from overt clinical RSV infection was 94.6% (35/37 cases). Two cases (4 and 7) developed RSV infection after the implementation of preventive measures and administration of palivizumab. Among the 14 patients who tested positive for RSV by Respi-Strip, all tested positive with PCR, yielding a positive predictive value for Respi-Strip of 100%. Sensitivity and specificity of Respi-Strip could not be determined since not all of the infants who tested negative were subsequently tested by PCR.
