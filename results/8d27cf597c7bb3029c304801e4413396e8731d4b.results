(a) Spatial expansions underlie a recent doubling of rabies spillover to livestock In total, 1146 (51%) of 2265 suspected outbreaks between 2003 and 2014 were confirmed rabies positive using the fluorescent antibody test, making VBR the most common notifiable disease in Peruvian livestock (electronic supplementary material, figure  S5a ). Cattle were infected in 91% of the confirmed outbreaks, followed by horses (4%), goats (2%), sheep (1%) and other assorted species (2%, 11 pigs, four buffalos and one camelid). Outbreaks were widespread across the Andes and Amazon, with 14 of 25 governmental regions reporting at least one suspected outbreak in livestock, and 12 regions reporting from 7 to 470 laboratoryconfirmed outbreaks (figure 1a). Temporal autocorrelation analysis revealed no seasonality in VBR spillover to livestock at either the national or the regional level. At the national level, the number of VBR outbreaks began a consistent increase in 2011, with a near doubling of outbreaks by 2014 ( figure 1b) . This increase is unlikely to be caused by changes in reporting: the 56 other livestock diseases tracked by the same surveillance system increased from the establishment of the system in 2003 until 2008, but remained stable in later years when rabies reports intensified (electronic supplementary material, figure S5b). Furthermore, in a linear model including the effects of the number of other diseases reported and year on the annual number of rabies outbreaks, year (F 1,9 ¼ 11.1, p , 0.01), but not outbreaks of other diseases Increases in VBR outbreaks were not geographically ubiquitous. Outbreaks declined or were stable in the Amazon, but became more frequent in the Andes, particularly in three regions characterized by valleys with high agricultural production surrounded by high elevation peaks: Apurimac (470 outbreaks, 41% of the national total), Ayacucho (197, 17%) and San Martin (128, 11%) (figure 1a; electronic supplementary material, figure S6 ). The national increase in rabies outbreaks occurred concurrently with spatial expansions into historically uninfected areas. The cumulative number of districts with confirmed cases more than tripled between 2003 and 2014, such that on average VBR spread into 12 (standard deviation, s.d. figure S2 ). The consistency of wavefront speeds within each valley suggests that VBR spreads predominately by short distance dispersal through a continuously occupied landscape, rather than by punctuated spread driven by long distance flights of infected bats. Census data showed no significant difference between valleys in the number of towns per 5 km grid cell (Chalhuanca: mean + s.d.: 12.9 + 11.5; Rio Apurimac: 12.5 + 12.2; Wilcoxon test, W ¼ 838, p ¼ 0.6) or in the percentage of surveyed communities reporting animals bitten by bats (Chalhuanca: 71% (36/51 communities) and Rio Apurimac: 78% (92/118); electronic supplementary material, figure S4 ). The two valleys had equivalent prevalence of bat bites (W ¼ 267, p ¼ 0.
