Dissecting In Vivo Influenza Infection Using Combined Single-Cell Mapping of Host and Viral Transcriptome To simultaneously study, in an unbiased way, both host and viral transcriptional states after influenza infection, we used singlecell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of cells from mouse lungs (female C57BL/6J mice aged 5.5-6.5 weeks) obtained 2 days after influenza infection. We first used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate immune (CD45 + ) and non-immune (CD45 À ) cells derived from the lungs of influenza-treated and PBS (''control'')-treated mice. Next, we used a massively parallel single-cell RNA-seq approach (MARS-seq; Jaitin et al., 2014) that profiles all polyadenylated mRNAs (STAR Methods, Figure 1A) . A total of 2,034 and 2,146 cells were analyzed from influenza-treated and control mice, respectively. To evaluate the quality of the data, we identified genes that are differentially expressed in cells isolated from the influenza-treated mice compared with the control (binomial test, STAR Methods). As expected, these genes (P binomial <10 À5 ) were overrepresented in antiviral-related signaling pathways, such as IFN signaling (P hg <10 À8 ) and Irf7 signaling (P hg <10 À7 ). Clustering of single cells enabled us to distinguish between different cell types while taking into account the possible confounding effect of antiviral-related programs. We did this by first excluding genes that correlated strongly with the top two prin-cipal components (top 1.5% of principal-component-correlated genes), which were strongly enriched for antiviral, anti-proliferative, and inflammatory processes ( Figure S1A ). Next, we applied the expectation maximization clustering algorithm as previously described (Paul et al., 2015) , and manually annotated each cluster based on the expression of canonical markers. The analysis produced nine robust clusters with a total of 4,064 cells, which comprised four clusters of non-immune cell types: epithelial cells (EP), lymphatic and blood endothelial cells (LEC and BEC, respectively), and fibroblasts (FIB), and five specialized immune cell types: granulocytes (GN), T cells, B cells, NK cells, and a joint cluster of dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages collectively termed the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) (Figure 1B,  Table S1 , STAR Methods). To determine whether cells were indeed clustered by cell type rather than by treatment or by intracellular viral gene transcription, each individual cell was annotated according to its best match with the global expression of previously sorted bulk cell subsets. As shown in Figures S1B and S1C, the annotation of individual cells based on the bulk transcriptome data was in agreement with the marker-based annotation of these clusters. We further used t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to project the different cell subpopulations onto a 2-dimensional space. As expected, cells annotated with the same cell type formed a separate t-SNE cluster independently of treatment (influenza-treated versus control) ( Figures 1C and 1D ). Since the viral mRNA (vmRNA) is polyadenylated, MARS-seq captures both viral and host mRNAs within each individual cell ( Figure 1A ). We inferred the viral load within a cell from the amount of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that are aligned with viral segments. Specifically, the viral load was defined as the proportion of viral UMIs (that is, UMIs aligned with one of the viral segments) in the total UMI content of a given cell. Accordingly, we defined three groups of cells: (1) ''infected cells,'' cells whose viral load is higher than a certain selected viral-load cutoff; (2) ''bystanders,'' cells that are derived from the influenzatreated mouse but do not detectably express any vmRNA (viral load is zero); and (3) ''unexposed cells,'' cells derived from a control mouse that was never infected ( Figure 1A ). Utilizing a model that takes cross-contamination and various technical artifacts into account, we showed that infected cells can be recovered with high precision over a range of viral-load cutoffs (Supplemental Information and Figures S2A-S2C ). For example, among the inferred infected granulocytes we correctly predicted 99% by using a strict viral-load cutoff of 1%, and 88% by using a more permissive (0.01%) cutoff. Utilizing a reporter model of in vitro infection (Shnayder et al., 2018) , we were able to assess how . In each single cell, the host and the vmRNA were simultaneously measured, allowing identification of infected as opposed to bystander cells as well as retrospective annotation of cell types based on transcriptional identities. (B) Transcriptional signatures of single cells associated with nine major cell types. Gene expression of annotated cell-type-specific genes (rows) is shown across 4,064 single cells (columns). The expression matrix displays the clustering of cells into nine cell-type groups (first row), where each cell type consists of cells derived from different treatments (light/dark gray respectively denote control/influenza-treated animals; second row) and shows heterogeneity of cell infection states (white/yellow/brown respectively denote unexposed/bystander/infected cells, third row). (CÀE) Visualization of single cells across different cell types, treatments, and intracellular infection states. t-SNE plots show the cell-type annotation of single cells (C); the mouse to which the cell belongs (D), and the intracellular infection state (E). Color-coding is as in (B). See also Figure S1 and Table S1 . well vmRNA detection recapitulates the actual infected cells (see details in Supplemental Information). We observed that our cell grouping correctly predicts a high fraction of bona fide infected cells ( Figure S2D ): using viral-load cutoffs of 0.05%, we correctly recovered 79% of the infected cells. Infected cells that were not identified were those with low viral loads that lead to dropout events; it should, however, be possible to identify many of those cells by increasing the RNA-seq coverage.
