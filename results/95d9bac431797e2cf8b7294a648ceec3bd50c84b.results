Thirty-two provincial CDCs (including Production and Construction Corps of Xinjiang) and 445 prefectural CDCs were divided into three regions (east, central and west) based on the basic coding manual of the Chinese Disease Control and Prevention Information System (Table 1 ). Only 7.4% (33/445) of prefectural CDCs were not involved in this survey. The main reason for non-participation was the lack of an information centre, which made it difficult to identify PHI practitioners. One hundred and sixty staff from provincial CDCs and 1121 staff from prefectural CDCs were contacted and completed the online questionnaire. Table 2 presents the demographic characteristics of the respondents by region. There were significant differences in age, educational level and academic major between the regions. A large proportion of staff in the eastern region staff (39.5%) were aged 30e39 years, which was much younger compared with the other regions (P ¼ 0.0012). Most staff with a Master's degree or a higher level of education were in the eastern region (18.7%) (P < 0.0001). There were more staff with IT-related academic majors in the eastern region (31.8%) compared with the other regions (P < 0.0001). Only 34 respondents (2.7%) had academic majors in both health and IT. Table 3 shows the respondents' score percentages in Parts 2e4. In Part 2, there were significant differences between regions, job roles and educational levels of the respondents. In the eastern region, staff in leadership positions and with a higher level of education were more knowledgeable about PHI strategy compared with other staff. In Parts 3 and 4, in the eastern region, staff in leadership positions and with a higher level of education were more inclined to report satisfaction with their personal work and training compared with other staff. Prefectural CDC staff reported a higher level of satisfaction with their work and training than staff in provincial CDCs. Overall, comparing Parts 2e4 of the questionnaire, the average satisfaction score was lowest for training (51.6%) followed by personal work (57.4%). Parts 5e7 of the questionnaire focused on recruitment, job role, evaluation standard and outflow of the workforce. Table 4 presents the differences between the three regions. In the eastern region, 34.9% of staff were hired competitively, which was significantly higher compared with the other regions (P < 0.0001). Regarding description of their current job role, 57.8% of respondents reported they had detailed information about their responsibilities, particularly in the eastern region (62.1%, P ¼ 0.004). When asked about the type of evaluation standard that CDC used to assess their work, most respondents reported that evaluations were based on quantity (70.7%) and quality (75.6%) of work. In addition, CDCs in the eastern region were most satisfied with services (45.1%, P ¼ 0.0005), and CDCs in the western region were most satisfied with economic benefit (11.4%, P ¼ 0.013). Regarding outflow of the workforce, staff in CDCs in the western region were most likely to leave if a better job became available (37.7%, P ¼ 0.0116).
