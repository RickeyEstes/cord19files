An initial series of experiments were carried out with pools of heads and bodies of S. ochraceum s.l. (a major Latin American vector of onchocerciasis). Pools containing varying numbers of heads of bodies were spiked with a single O. volvulus L3, and DNA prepared from the pools using either the conventional method of organic extractions followed by adsorption to a silica matrix, or by oligonucleotide capture of O. volvulus genomic DNA followed by magnetic purification of the captured oligonucleotide-DNA complexes. The conventional method consistently produced a positive signal in pools containing up to 50 heads (Table 1) . Pools containing greater than 50 heads were not positive in the assay. All (Table 1 ). In contrast, positive signals were obtained in all pools containing up to 200 heads or bodies in the assays performed on the oligonucleotide capture purified DNA samples ( Table 1) . The preliminary experiments suggested that the oligonucleotide capture method was capable of detecting one L3 in pools of up to 200 heads or bodies. To further explore the sensitivity of the assay, the experiment was repeated using 10 separate pools containing 200 heads or bodies spiked with a single L3. All pools were found to be positive, suggesting that the oligonucleotide capture assay was capable of consistently detecting a single L3 in pools of up to 200 heads or bodies of S. ochraceum s.l. (Table 2) . Previous studies had demonstrated that the conventional silica adsorption method was capable of detecting a single infected S. damnosum s.l. (the major African vector of onchocerciasis) fly in a pool containing up to 99 uninfected flies [7] . To determine if the performance of the oligonucleotide capture assay was similar when applied to S. damnosum s.l., the spiking experiments were repeated employing pools containing 200 S. damnosum s.l. heads or bodies. All spiked pools were found to be positive ( Table 2 ), suggesting that the capture assay preformed equally well on both African and Latin American vectors of onchocerciasis. For the capture assay to be cost effective, it should be competitive with the cost of the conventional silica adsorption assay. The two assays require roughly the same amount of technical time, so labor costs may be assumed to be equivalent per sample for the two assays. However, because it will be possible to increase the size of the pools 2-4 fold when using the capture assay, a reduction in labor costs of between 50% and 75% would be realized when costs are considered on a per-fly-tested basis. Similarly, the per-sample cost of carrying out the conventional assay is roughly $2.22 per pool, while the cost of the magnetic bead assay is $3.81 per pool. However, because the magnetic bead permits more flies to be tested per pool, cost savings in reagents are realized when the costs are amortized on a per fly basis (Table 3) .
