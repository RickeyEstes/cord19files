Based on results from July of 2001, 2002, and September of 2003, seropositivity was identiWed for the following pathogens (number positive/total examined, %): infectious bursal disease (22/58, 38%), M. gallisepticum (14/38, 37%), Avian adenovirus type I (46/57, 81%), Marek's disease (10/23, 43%), avian encephalomyelitis (10/24, 42%), infectious bronchitis virus -Massachussetts strain (4/24, 17%), infectious bronchitis virus -Connecticut strain (2/24, 8%), and C. psittaci (1/10, 10%). Chickens from this sample pool were serologically negative for avian cholera, avian inXuenza, avian adenovirus II, Newcastle disease (Avian Paramyxovirus-1), avian paramyxovirus 2 and 3, S. pullorum, S. typhimurium, and infectious tenosynovitis virus (Table 1 ). In subsequent serologic tests of chickens from farms on San Cristobal Island in November 2003 using a diVerent diagnostic laboratory and test than the previous samples, seroreactivity for Newcastle disease was detected on three out of Wve farms with 16 out of 72 birds positive (22.2%). Seropositivity for M. gallisepticum was detected in 5 out of 12 chickens on one farm from the November 2003 samples; the other farms were negative. Regarding other serologic tests from chicken farms from November 2003, seropositivity was detected for infectious bursal disease (30/72, 41.7%), infectious bronchitis virus (33/72, 45.8%), and infectious tenosynovitis virus (49/72, 68%). Antibodies for avian inXuenza were not detected in any of the broiler farms (Table 1) . On histopathology, fowlpox was identiWed in 6% (6/ 100) and Macrorhabdus sp., a fungal enteric pathogen (Tomaszewski et al., 2003) , in 10.5% (6/57) of chickens examined. A systemic infection with T. gondii was also identiWed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry in the one chicken we tested. No hemoparasites were detected on examination of blood smears. Parasites identiWed grossly or histologically include the following (number positive/total number examined, %infected): the conjunctival nematode Pathogens detected in this study, documented pathogenicity in wild birds, and native Gal√°pagos species at risk are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
