The diagnostic performance of the competitive ELISA for anti-PEDV antibody detection was evaluated by testing 829 swine sera, which were classified as positive or negative according to their known origin. Only when all the validation criteria were fulfilled. The results of ELISA test were considered valid and used for further analysis. Thus, the ROC curves were calculated based on previous classification of the sera into positive and negative groups. The ROC curves permitted both to select the optimal cut-off values and to estimate the diagnostic sensitivities and specificities. The shape and the relevant AUC values demonstrated the highly accuracy (AUC = 0.992 at the 1/4 dilution, 95% IC 0.983-0.997) of the competitive ELISA for anti-PEDV antibody detection, that has nearly 100% sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp). By using the first serum dilution, the cut-off value representing the optimal balance of Se and Sp (Se: 97.8-95% CI 95.8-99.1; Sp: 97.69-95% CI 95.7-98.9) was 56% (percentage of inhibition). Considering the test performances, a cut-off value easily applicable in routine activity corresponding to 60% (Se: 96.5-95% CI 94.1-98.1; Sp: 98.2-95% CI 96.3-99.3), that still allows working with high levels of Se and Sp, was selected (Fig. 1) . The 1/4 serum dilution was selected as the screening one since it provided the best diagnostic Se and Sp values, as well as the highest discrimination window between positive and negative sera. In addition, 1/8 or even more serial dilutions could be used to estimate the antibody level (i.e., the serum titre could be expressed as the dilution closer to the cut-off value). The interactive dot diagram (Fig. 2) displayed the accuracy of a diagnostic test. The horizontal line placed in the selected cut-off (60%) showed a very good discriminating power of the test with a best separation (minimal false negative and false positive results) between the two groups (positive-1 and negative-0). Both sets of 24 and 11 experimental samples, respectively positive for TGEV and HEV, yielded negative results in the competitive PEDV ELISA. Thus, heterologous positive sera were clearly differentiated from the PEDV-positive sera, suggesting that a satisfactory analytical Sp was achieved.
