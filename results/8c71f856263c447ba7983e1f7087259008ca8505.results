Nearly half of the G gene of SCSKV and RRV is inherited from a carnivore RABV. Sequences of SCSKV and RRV G genes were collected from several previous reports (n = 148, see Additional File 1) and reference RABVs from GenBank (n = 450, see Additional File 2). As previously reported 6, 14 , phylogenetic analysis suggested that they fell in the bat clade (see Additional File 3A). We also retrieved worldwide RABV G genes from GenBank in order to identify their positions in the RABV phylogenetic tree (see Additional File 3B). Next, we further investigated the G gene sequences from three representatives of the SCSKV variant, the carnivore lineage, and the bat lineage: A09-0255, an American wolf isolate belonging to the SCSKV genotype; CA, isolated from a North American skunk of the cosmopolitan clade virus; and LAH60, isolated from a North American bat (Lasiurus borealis/cinereus), which shares the highest similarity to SCSKV among available bat RABVs. We initially compared all of the variable sites in the A09-255, CA, and LAH60 G genes and discovered two crossover sites. Between the two crossover sites, A09-255 shared higher similarity with the carnivore virus, while outside of this region, A09-255 exhibited higher sequence identity with the bat RABV (Fig. 1A ). Comparison of a complete RRV genome with the bat and carnivore RABVs also demonstrated a similar G gene pattern (see Additional File 4). Bootscan analysis of the G gene with an outgroup (Lagos bat viruses 8619NGA and 0406SEN) indicated that this discordant sequence likely derives from HR. Two crossover sites were also identified in the bootscan analysis (Fig. 1B) . Between the two crossover sites, A09-255 was found to be homologous to carnivore RABVs, while it was more similar to bat RABVs outside of this region. Taken together, these results suggest that the G gene of SCSKV likely underwent a recombination event, resulting in the two breakpoints. Using the three representative isolates, the recombination event was further examined through seven recombination analysis methods implemented in the RDP software package, which properly allows for statistical analysis of the probability of recombination (Fig. 1C) . To determine the two putative breakpoints, we next analyzed informative sites using Fisher's exact test (Fig. 1D ). Two putative breakpoints were discovered at positions 600 (χ max 2 = 11.2, P < 0.0005) and 1347 (χ max 2 = 3.0, P < 0.05) of the G gene open reading frame (ORF), suggesting that over half of the G gene (747/1575 nucleotides = 47.4% of the SCSKV G gene) may be derived from an American carnivore RABV. The gold-standard approach for confirming the presence of recombination is a set of statistically incongruent phylogenetic trees 34 . Inside the breakpoints, they were nested within the clade of carnivore RABVs with 91% (of 1000 replicates) bootstrap support ( Fig. 2A) . Outside of the two breakpoints, however, SCSKV and RRV clustered into the American bat lineage with 96% (of 1000 replicates) bootstrap support (Fig. 2B) . The topologies of these two trees were significantly different (Shimodaira-Hasegawa test, P < 0.0001).
