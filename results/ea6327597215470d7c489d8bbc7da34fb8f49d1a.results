The polyprotein encoding sequence (GenBank #GQ323774) of HRVC-QCE, a new member of the species Human rhinovirus C, spanned 6423 nt; shorter than all HEVs and HRVs except HRV-NY074. 14, 20, 21 It had a G + C content of 43% and 2140 predicted amino acids terminating in an HRV-C-specific isoleucine. 11 The HRVC-QCE polyprotein shared 54% average amino acid identity with HRV-A strains, 50% with HRV-Bs and 79% with other HRV-Cs. Ten protease cleavage sites were predicted to reduce the HRVC-QCE polyprotein into typical picornavirus structural (VP1-4) and non-structural proteins (2A-C and 3A-D 17, 22, 23 ). HRVC-QCE shared a translation initiation site (MGAQVS) with most other HRVs and three motifs crucial for RNA polymerase binding (YGDD, TFLKR and SIRWT) shared by HRVs, and HEVs 24,25 but lacked two of three exposed VP1 motifs previously conserved among HRV polyproteins 26 were absent in HRV-QCE. Phylogeny inferred from a discontinuous alignment of 10 amino acids in VP3 and VP1 which comprise the predicted intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 footprint 27 in major group HRV strains, placed HRVC-QCE amongst other HRV-Cs on a branch with HRV-1 (a minor group HRV which employs a different receptor) but distinct from the known major (employing the ICAM-1 molecule as receptor) or remaining minor group HRV strains (Fig. 1) . Key residues on the VP1 BC loop involved in receptor contact with the VLDLR 19 are missing in HRVC-QCE and there are differences in the HI loop compared to the classical strains. Antigenic site A 28 is absent in HRVC-QCE and the sequence at site B is unique to HRVC-QCE. As with other HRV-C strains identified to date, 18 the conserved loop sequence motif constituting a cre, R 1 NNNA 1 A 2 R 2 NNNNNNR 3 was identified (GCUCAAGCAAAUCA) in 1B of HRVC-QCE in the context of an appropriate predicted RNA stem-loop structure (not shown). All classical HRV-A strains and 18/25 HRV-B strains are susceptible to the antiviral compound, pleconaril. Among the 25 key contact residues lining the antiviral binding pocket, there were 11 or 12 HRVC-QCE-specific differences compared to HRV-A or HRV-B consensus sequences, 29 respectively (Fig. 2) ; 11 differences exist between HRV-As and Bs and two differences between the consensus sequence of HRV-B sensitive versus resistant strains. Changes at two HRVC-QCE residues historically important for identifying naturally resistant strains were identified as Tyr 152 (in resistant strains) to Phe 152 and Val 191 to Thr 191 . His 245 , conserved in nearly all other classical HRV strains, varied in HRVC-QCE and among other HRV-Cs. Other conserved HRV residues including Ile/Leu 106 and Tyr/Phe/Ala 150, differed in HRVC-QCE (Fig. 2) . To examine whether HRVC-QCE was a variant of a previously identified HRV strain, we first compared the full polyprotein against public sequence databases. The nearest matches were HRVC-C026 (93.5% identity, 2003 identical amino acids) and HRVC-QPM (92.9%, 1991 amino acids). The inferred amino acid sequences from complete 1D regions of eight HRVC-QCE-positive extracts (variants 001-004, 006, 009, 010, 012; intra-strain amino acid identity, 99.5%; GenBank accession number GQ323774 and bankit numbers, 1304337, 1304336, 1304343, 1304341, 1304344, 1304335, 1304320) were compared to those from known HRV and HEV serotypes and to previously described HRVC-QPM variants (n = 17; intra-strain identity of 99.8%; Fig. 3 ). The amino acid identity between variants of the HRVC-QPM and HRVC-QCE strains (91.2%) was lower than among variants of the two strains (≥99.5%). At least 93% polyprotein-length pairwise identity is also shared by 80% (n = 60) of antigenically distinct and officially recognised HRV-A strains (60 strains occur in at least one pairing in which sequence identity is ≥93%; HRV-8 and 95, HRV-1A and 1B and HRV-82 and sc were not considered discrete viruses). The HRVC-QCE VP1 (272 aa) is 9-24 amino acids shorter than that of other HRV serotypes. The HRVC-QCE residues aligning with the 10 residue ICAM-1 footprint differed by one from those of the most similar strain (HRVC-C026). In VP1, two of 6 amino acids from antigenic site B, four of 20 from the EF loop, one of 3 from the FG loop, two of 32 from the GH loop, three of 8 from the HI loop, one of 24 constituting the binding pocket and two of 48 nt in the 1B cre differed from the most similar HRV-C strain. Since DQ875928 = NY60). The complete polyprotein of most of these strains has not been described and for the one that has (HRVC-NAT001), no additional variants were sought and only preliminary clinical studies were performed. HRVC-QCE RNA was detected in 1.0% (n = 13) of 1247 specimen extracts collected from January to December 2003 using a 1B targeted RT-rtPCR and confirmed by an assay targeting the 2C region. No control patients were sampled in 2003. HRVC-QCE prevalence was bimodal with the major peak in summer when 3.5% of specimens were positive (7.6% of 119 specimens from February were positive representing 76.9% of all HRVC-QCE positives and 16.1% of all virus detections (n = 56) that month). HRVC-QCE was the only HRV detected in January. The remaining 23.1% of HRVC-QCE positives were detected in winter (0.8% of specimens, peaking at 3.8% of all viral detections in June). No other viruses were detected in 61.5% (n = 8) of HRVC-QCE positives (Table 1 ) leaving five extracts in which another viral sequence was identified. Respiratory picornaviruses were the most frequently detected virus at 40.9% of detections (n = 351) followed by HBoV (11.8%, n = 101), HRSV (8.3%, n = 71) and HMPV (7.7%, n = 66). No viruses were found in 46.0% (n = 574) of extracts. Isolation of HRVC-QCE in culture was not attempted because of the age of the clinical specimens. Chart review of the 13 HRVC-QCE positive cases revealed presentation with lower respiratory tract illnesses (6/13; 46.2%), most commonly involving wheeze and administration of bronchodilators (Table 1) . Antibiotics were not usually given to wheezers compared to non-wheezers. Eleven of the 13 cases (84.6%) were admitted to hospital and HRVC-QCE was the sole detection in 61.5% (8/13) of patients. The average severity score among single HRVC-QCE detections was higher (1.6) than that for co-detections (1.2) and was higher in summer (1.6) than in winter (1.0). Average scores were highest among lower respiratory tract presentations (1.8) and scores of 0 were obtained from an upper respiratory tract illness and a cystic fibrosis patient with an HRSV co-detection. There were no adult cases, despite adults comprising 15.8% of the screened population. Most (84.6%) patients were 2 years of age or younger.
