Twenty-six of 47 samples showed positive result to S1 gene of IBV by RT-PCR. These samples were isolated from three different farms in West Java; therefore, we choose three positive samples only, one viral isolate from each farm for further nucleotide sequencing analysis. These three isolates are Indonesia/ K4A9/17 and Indonesia/P3/17 from Sukabumi, while Indonesia/K233A31/18 from Bogor. Nucleotide sequencing of 352 nucleotide partial gene S1 indicates that isolates Indonesia/K4A9/17 and Indonesia/K233A31/18 have 100% homology with IBV vaccine strain 4/91, while isolate Indonesia/ P3/17 has 100% homology with IBV vaccine strain 233 A. Among these three IBV isolates, the deviation between Indonesia/K4A9/17 and Indonesia/ K233A31/18 was 0%, while Indonesia/K4A9/17 and Indonesia/K233A31/18 deviate 0% to Indonesia/ P3/17. Difference of S1 gene sequence between these three IBV isolates with other vaccine strain was 2-29% (Table-1 ). There was no deletion or insertion occurred inside the S1 genes. Point mutation throughout nucleotide sequences was not detected either ( Figure-1 ). There are 11 nucleotide differences within three IBV isolates (Table-1) . Differences between three samples located in nucleotides: 749, 790, 808, 824, 988, 1008, 1097, 1103, 1131, 1133, and 1137. There are no changes in amino acid residue -304 that correlated with nucleotide -894. There are no changes in nucleotide order A-ACA-G from cytosine to timina and amino acid histidine from the three samples or vaccine strain. XCE primers used in this study only able to amplify third quarter part of hypervariable regions 3 (HVRs 3) in S1 gene, whereas HVRs 3 located at amino acid residue 274-387. Amino acid residue indicates no deletion, insertion, or mutation at position 298 (Histidine) (Figure-1) . The phylogenetic tree ( Figure- 2) of the aligned nucleotide of partial S1 gene was constructed using maximum likelihood of the general time reversible model of MEGA 7 (www.megasoftware.net) [14, 15] , the tree showed a close relatedness of two IBV isolates (Indonesia/K4A9/17 and Indonesia/K233A31/18) with reference IBV strain 793 (Accession No. Z83979), strain 793B (Accession No. KF377577), strain 793B (Accession No. AF093793), strain 793B (Accession No. AF093794), and strain 491 (Accession No. JN1921541) isolated in the United Kingdom (UK), while other isolate Indonesia/P3/17 has close relatedness to reference IBV strain 233A (Accession No. JQ946056), Variant 1 (Accession No. AF093795), and strain 1/96 793B (Accession No. AF093795) isolated from Israel, the United States of America (USA), and the UK, respectively. Based on genetic characterization on S1 gene sites, isolates Indonesia/K4A9/17 and Indonesia/K233A31/18 were likely belonged to IBV close to vaccine strain 4/91, and isolate Indonesia/ P3/17 likely belonged to IBV close to vaccine strain 233A.
