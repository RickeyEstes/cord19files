The principle of the novel real-time RT-PCR mediated by high-fidelity DNA polymerase. Highfidelity DNA polymerase has a 3′-5′ exonuclease activity to remove the mismatched bases from the 3′-end of a newly synthesized DNA strand or primer. Various chemical modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, amination, and dideoxy nucleotide) at 3′-end base or the 3′-OH of the primer do not influence the removing (proof-reading) activity of the HF DNA polymerase 34 . A fluorescent probe (e.g. TaqMan probe) often contains a fluorophore and quencher group at 5′ and 3′ end of an oligonucleotide, respectively. The fluorophore-or quencher-modified base can be removed from the probe by HF DNA polymerase when the 3′-base forms a mismatch with the template (Fig. 1 ). In fact, some HF DNA polymerase can non-specifically remove the 3′ modified or unmodified base and start extension even though no mismatch occurs 35 . The removal of the fluorophore or quencher group from the probe results in the release of the fluorescent signal. Therefore, a probe can be used directly as a primer to initiate PCR amplification under the HF DNA polymerase and the emitted fluorescence during the amplification can be monitored during a real-time PCR amplification (Fig. 1) . We call the new method as HF DNA polymerase mediated real-time PCR and defined the probe as HFman probe or fluorescent primer (Fig. 1) . Compared with the conventional qPCR that requires a pair of primers and a probe, the new method needs only one HFman probe and one corresponding primer. (a) When the HFman probe fully matches with the template, the high-fidelity DNA polymerase can non-specifically recognize 3′ fluorophore-modified base and remove the 3′-base to initiate primer extension. (b) When the HFman probe forms a mismatch with the template at the 3′-end, the high-fidelity DNA polymerase recognize the 3′ mismatched base and remove the mismatched base to initiate extension. The removal of 3′ fluorophore-labelled base will emit the fluorescent signal. To prove the viability of the new method, we designed an HFman probe (N9-probe-1) and a primer for amplification of neuraminidase (NA) gene of H7N9 virus, and performed the new RT-qPCR assay. The N9-probe-1 has a fluorophore group at the 5′ end. As expected, an S-shape amplification curve was observed in the positive reaction but not in the negative control (data not shown), indicating the new method works. In the conventional qPCR, because the cleavage of TaqMan probe is from 5′ to 3′ by Taq DNA polymerase, the fluorophore group is usually labelled at the 5′ end of the probe to increase the emission of fluorescence. For HFman probe, fluorophore group is allowed to be labelled at either 5′ end or 3′end. However, because only bases at the 3'-end of HFman probe can be removed by HF DNA polymerase, a 3′ fluorophore labelling is thought to be more efficient than a 5′ fluorophore labelling. To prove this hypothesis, we designed N9-probe-2 that has a fluorophore group at the 3′ end, and performed a comparison between N9-probe-1 and N9-probe-2. The result showed that the reaction with N9-probe-2 had an earlier amplification curve with stronger fluorescence signal than that with N9-probe-1 (Fig. 2a) , supporting a HFman probe with a 3′-fluorophore group is more efficient than that with 5′-fluorophore group. RT-qPCR can be carried out in singleplex or multiplex formats. Multiplex RT-qPCR has more widespread application than a singleplex format in molecular diagnostics of infectious diseases (especially for co-infection and multiple infections). To test the possibility of using the new qPCR method in a multiplex format, we designed a β-actin-specific HFman probe that was labelled individually with four different fluorescent dyes at 5′ end. Four fluorescent dyes HEX, FAM, CY5, and Texas Red were labelled at 5′ end with four quenchers BHQ1, TAMRA, BHQ3, Eclipse at 3′end, respectively (Supplementary Table S1 ). The four dyes can emit fluorescence signals at different wavelengthes that are monitored in different fluorescent channels, and are widely used in the Multiplex RT-qPCR assay. Four good amplification curves were observed in different fluorescent channels (Fig. 2b) , indicating that HF DNA polymerase recognize HFman probe labelled with different fluorophore and quencher groups. These results imply that the new qPCR can be developed into a multiplex format. Optimization of the reaction system. To assess the performance of various HF DNA polymerases and select the best one for the new qPCR method, we tested seven different commercially available HF DNA polymerases. Although various enzymes have different fidelities, all seven HF DNA polymerases worked in the new qPCR system ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The Q5 enzyme was selected for subsequent experiments because of more rapid amplification ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). To obtain the best performance of the new qPCR, we first optimized the concentrations of MgCl 2 by adding 0 to 4 mM of MgCl 2 . The results showed that increasing amount of MgCl 2 enhanced the total fluorescence signal intensity at the amplification plateau period, but did not improve the amplification efficiency (Supplementary Flexibility of the new qPCR method to probe and/or primer mismatches. RT-qPCR has a very wide use especially in diagnostics of infectious diseases. About 70% infectious diseases are caused by viruses that have higher mutation rates than bacteria and other non-viral pathogens. Therefore, it is difficult to find absolutely conserved genomic regions of some viruses (e.g. HIV-1) for primer and probe design. The presence of mismatch between primer/probe and template reduces the amplification efficiency and sensitivity of RT-qPCR, although the use of degenerate primers can slightly improve the assay. The principle of the new qPCR method mediated by the HF DNA polymerase requires the presence of mismatch to initiate the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of HF enzyme for removing the 3′ fluorophore-or quencher-modified base from the probe. Therefore, the new RT-qPCR is essentially resistant to mutations existent in templates. To address this hypothesis, we designed and constructed several mutant β-actin RNA templates that form mismatches with the 3′-end of the HFman probe or primer (Supplementary Table S1 ). All mutants and wild-type can be amplified with a slightly different efficiency (Fig. 3a) . The template without mismatch and with one mismatch at the 3′-last base of the probe showed slightly higher amplification efficiency than those with a mismatch at the second last 3′-base of the probe. The templates forming mismatch with HFman probe have slightly higher efficiency than those forming mismatch with the reverse primer, possibly due to the mismatch between reverse primer and RNA templates which limits the speed of reverse transcription. To further test the effect of various mismatches between HFman probe and template on amplification efficiency, we synthesized four HFman probe with different bases at 3-end (Probe-A, -G, -C, and -T), and constructed four RNA templates that completely match to each of the probes ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The probe has HEX and BHQ1 in the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. The templates carrying C and G at the position corresponding to 3′-end of HFman probe have slightly lower amplification efficiency (higher Ct values) than templates carrying A and T ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ) for four probes. To further demonstrate the flexibility of the new RT-qPCR method to variants, we performed a comparison between the new method and the conventional (TaqMan probe-based) RT-qPCR method. To increase the comparability, the forward primer of the conventional method shares identical sequence with the HFman probe, and an additional TaqMan probe was designed for the conventional method. For the wild template, although the curve of the new method appeared slightly earlier and had stronger fluorescent signal than that of the conventional method, the amplification curves produced by both methods are close to each other (Ct: 23.56 vs. 27 .58), supporting the idea that both methods are comparable. When the mutant template was used, the curve (Ct = 17.98) produced by the new method was obviously earlier and the fluorescent signal was substantially stronger than that by the conventional method (Ct = 26.35) (Fig. 3b) . In particular, the new method produced similar curves between wild and mutant templates (Ct: 17.11 vs 17.98), while the conventional method produced an obviously later curve (Ct = 26.35) with lower fluorescent signal for mutant template than for wild template (Ct = 18.77) (Fig. 3b) . These results suggest that the amplification mediated by the new method was less affected by variants in target genes, implying a promising application in detection of highly variable pathogens. On the other hand, since larger amplicon will reduce the sensitivity of the conventional qPCR, the amplicon length is generally recommended to be about 100 bp (50-150 bps) 2 . To evaluate the flexibility of the new qPCR method to amplicon lengths, we designed a series of reverse primers to generate various lengths (from 55 to 250 bps) of amplicons with the HFman probe (Supplementary Table S2) , and compared the amplification efficiencies. The results showed the amplification curves of different lengths of amplicons cluster together with a small difference in Ct values (16.32 to 19.04), indicating that the amplicon length has less influence on the sensitivity of the new qPCR method (Supplementary Fig. S4 ).
