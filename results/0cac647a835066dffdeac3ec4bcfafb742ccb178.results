Ninety-five questionnaires (32%) were completed and returned. The average age of respondents was 32 years. Fifty-six respondents (59%) were male, 57 (60%) were married, and 41 (43%) had children younger than 18 years of age. Participants were asked whether they would remain on duty to care for patients with smallpox in a variety of scenarios. Protective gear was defined as gloves, eye protection, and an N95 mask. Table 1 depicts the results. If no vaccine was available and paramedics had no protective gear, 4 (4%) answered that they probably would remain on duty. In this scenario, no respondent definitely would remain on duty. If they were guaranteed that vaccine would be available within 4 days and protective gear were available, 42 paramedics (44%) definitely would remain on duty and 37 (39%) probably would remain on duty. If protective gear but no vaccine were available, 8 paramedics (8%) definitely would remain on duty and 29 (30%) probably would remain on duty. If protective gear were not available, even if they were guaranteed that vaccine would be available within 4 days, 7 (7%) definitely and 23 (24%) probably would remain on duty. If vaccine were available but there was no guarantee that it would arrive on time, 2 (2%) definitely and 12 (13%) probably would remain on duty. Eighty-six (91%) probably or definitely would remain on duty if they were prevaccinated and knew they were protected from infection. That number decreases to 56 (59%) if their families were not also protected with vaccine. Younger age, male gender, single status, and having no children younger than 18 years were associated with a greater likelihood of remaining on duty. . 91% probably or definitely would remain on duty if they were prevaccinated and knew they were protected from infection. That number decreases to 59% if their families were not also protected with vaccine.
