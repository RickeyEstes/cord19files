CCR5 is essential for protection against JE but dispensable for control of viral replication The chemokine receptor CCR5 is believed to play a critical role in recovery from flavivirus encephalitis via efficient leukocyte trafficking to the brain [16] [17] [18] . CCR5 is also a key mediator to recruit CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs known as regulatory CD4 + T cell subset to dampen exacerbated inflammation such as viral encephalitis [21] [22] [23] [24] . Although the role of CD4 + Foxp4 + Tregs in flavivirus encephalitis remains elusive, CCR5-dependent recruitment of CD4 + Foxp3 + Tregs may play certain roles in the control of encephalitis progression caused by flavivirus infection. To address this issue of CCR5 in flavivirus encephalitis, we first confirmed the role of CCR5 in JE progression using CCR5-deficient (Ccr5 −/− ) mice. After Ccr5 +/+ and Ccr5 −/− mice were infected with JEV, surviving mice were monitored until 15 dpi (Fig. 1a) . Mice in both groups showed similar clinical signs, starting with generalized piloerection, paresis, and rigidity and followed by progression into severe neurological signs such as postural imbalance, ataxia, and generalized tonic-clonic seizure from 4 to 6 dpi. However, CCR5 ablation resulted in marked increases in mortality after showing neurological disorders, with a mortality rate of 100 % for Ccr5 −/− mice vs. 54 % for Ccr5 +/+ mice after JEV infection (3.0 × 10 7 pfu). Likewise, Ccr5 −/− mice showed a rapid increase in the frequency of neurological disorder starting from 3 to 4 dpi after JEV infection (3.0 × 10 7 pfu) with greater body weight loss, compared to Ccr5 +/+ mice (Fig. 1b, c) . However, the viral burden in the extraneural lymphoid tissue (spleen) and CNS (brain and spinal cord) of Ccr5 −/− mice was not increased compared to that of Ccr5 +/+ mice (Fig. 1d) . Therefore, these results indicate that CCR5 ablation could result in an increased susceptibility to JE progression irrespective of viral replication.
