Statistical summary of transcriptome analysis. To profile gene expression after infection of three pathogens (VHSV, Streptococcus parauberis, and Miamiensis avidus), transcriptome analysis was conducted using gill tissues of olive flounders, respectively. We prepared twelve olive flounders (three un-infected individuals as control, three virus-infected, three bacteria-infected, and three parasite-infected individuals) to raise confidence. To gain the sufficient number of transcripts, twelve independent RNA samples acquired from normal and pathogen-infected olive flounder gill tissues were employed for construction of cDNA library. Then, these cDNA libraries were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq2500, generating the numbers of approximately 78.4 million, 65.2 million, and 45.7 million raw reads from three control samples, 44.0 million, 56.9 million, and 62.0 million raw reads from bacteria-infected samples, 41.2 million, 62.4 million, and 40.0 million raw reads from virus-infected samples, 39.6 million, 41.6 million, and 53.1 million raw reads from parasite-infected samples, respectively (Table 1) . After trimming of low-quality reads and adaptor sequences, the number of clean reads acquired from control samples were average 62.3 million reads from control samples, average 53.5 million reads from bacteria-infected samples, average 48.0 million reads from virus-infected samples, and average 44.3 million reads from parasite-infected samples, respectively. Then, we checked gene coverage whether the reads that we acquired are sufficient for quantitative gene expression analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The clean reads were assembled into 120,880 transcript sequences acquired from transcriptome analysis, we identified total 40,100 genes involving novel 19,560 genes from transcript sequences using InterProScan database and non-redundant protein database in the NCBI ( Table 2 ).
