We sampled 334 camels from nine herds (Table 1 ). All nine herds had at least two animals seropositive for C. burnetii (Table 2) . Based on an intraclass cluster correlation (q) of 0.11, there was noted a very weak cluster correlation. Univariate analysis of exposure variables revealed that herd, age group and TS were significantly associated with C. burnetii seropositivity (Table 3) . Older age group and increased TS were associated with seropositivity for C. burnetii. The final linear mixed model for C. burnetii seroprevalence was generated with 'age group' as a significant factor ( Table 4 ). The serostatus of Q fever among the three age groups is as follows: 7% young (n = 56), 14% juvenile (n = 81) and 24% adult (n = 197).
