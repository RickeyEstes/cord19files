The data set included clinical findings, viral PCR, and Mycoplasma and aerobic culture results for 2,030 calves. All calves enrolled in the study were Holsteins and were between 23 and 69 days of age when sampled. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus was detected in the upper respiratory tract of 169 (8.3%) calves. Bovine coronavirus was detected in 168 (8.3%) of calves. No calves tested positive for BVDV or BHV-1 virus. Pathogenic aerobes were cultured from the pharyngeal recess swabs of 911 calves, and Mycoplasma spp. were cultured from the pharyngeal recesses of 1,234 calves. At least one pathogen (BRSV, Mycoplasma spp., Histophilus somni, Pasteurella multocida, Bibersteinia trehalosi or Mannheimia haemolytica) was detected in 811 (87.2%) enrolled calves. A total of 932 calves (45.9%) had a WI BRD score of 5 or greater. Eight hundred sixty-nine calves were classified as cases and 1,161 calves were classified as controls using the algorithm in Fig. 1 . Only 809 pairs of the pairs enrolled contained both one case and one control and were valid to be included in the conditional logistic regression analysis. Twenty-eight pairs contained 2 cases and 166 pairs contained 2 controls. Twenty-four calves were not assigned to a pair in the data set. Depression was noted in 530 (61.0%) cases, and 54 (4.4%) controls and the crude pair-matched OR for depression was 171.7 (95% CI: (55.2, 534.0), p < 0.0005). Diarrhea was observed in 26 cases and 3 controls, however, a pair-matched OR could not be estimated since no pairs had a control with and control without diarrhea. Six cases and zero controls were emaciated. A pair-matched OR for emaciation could not be estimated since no emaciated controls were sampled. Tachypnea was noted in 455 (52.4%) cases and 51 (4.4%) controls. The crude pair-matched OR for tachypnea was 218.5 (95% CI: (54.5, 876.4), p < 0.0005). Dyspnea was noted in 172 (19.8%) cases and 12 (1.0%) controls. The crude pair-matched OR for dyspnea was 164 (95% CI: (23, 1171), p < 0.0005). Abnormal respiration was noted in 467 (53.7%) cases and 52 (4.5%) controls. The crude pair-matched OR for abnormal respiration was 224.5 (95% CI: (56.0, 900.4), p < 0.0005). Diarrhea and emaciation were not further considered as candidates to be included in the model since pair-matched ORs could not be estimated. Upon arrival to the facility, 332 (38.3%) cases and 329 (28.3%) controls had serum total protein concentrations equal to or less than 5.2 g/dl, which is consistent with failure of passive transfer of maternal antibodies. The crude pair-matched OR for FPT was 1.6 (95% CI: (1.3, 2.1), p < 0.0005).
