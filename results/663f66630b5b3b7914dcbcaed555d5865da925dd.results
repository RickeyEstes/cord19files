The first EQA materials were distributed to 51 laboratories and 46 results were returned (78.4% response rate), and the second EQA materials were distributed to 53 laboratories and 47 results were returned (88.6% response rate). Most of the participants used commercial rRT-PCR kits; of these, PowerChek MERS Real-Time PCR kit (KogeneBiotech, Daejon, Korea) was the most common, followed by DiaPlexQ MERS Virus Detection kit (SolGent, Seoul, Korea), and AccuPower MERS-CoV Real-Time RT-PCR kit (Bioneer, Daejon, Korea) (Tables 1 and 2) . Only two participants in the first phase and one participant in the second phase of EQA used in-house rRT-PCR methods. All participants reported both upE and ORF1a results in a semiquantitative manner (CT value). Different cut-off values were employed, depending on the kit used: 39, 35, and 38 for Accu-Power, PowerChek, and DiaPlexQ, respectively.
