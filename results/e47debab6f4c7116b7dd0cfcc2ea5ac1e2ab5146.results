C. parvum was not detected in the seven lambs in the uninfected, untreated control group. All six neonatal lambs from the experimentally infected, untreated group (treatment control) began excreting C. parvum oocysts at age 5 days. The intensity of oocyst shedding was highest at age 7 days, with a mean score of 3.8 AE 0.4. The patent period ranged between 10 and 14 days (11.3 AE 2.0 days). All animals developed persistent diarrhoea that lasted for 5-10 days (7.0 AE 1.7 days) and the onset of diarrhoea coincided with the start of oocyst shedding (Table 1) . Similar results were obtained in the excipient control group. All six neonatal lambs showed persistent diarrhoea for 5-10 days (7.3 AE 2.1 days). The onset of diarrhoea coincided with the start of oocyst shedding, at age 5 days. The patent period in this group lasted between 8 and 14 days (11.0 AE 2.6 days). Oocyst excretion reached a peak 3 days after it began, with a mean score of 3.0 AE 0.6 (Table 1 ). There were no significant differences between treatment control and excipient control groups in terms of the criteria studied. In contrast, in the group that was treated prophylactically/therapeutically with Bobel-24 (50 mg/kg of body weight), three of the lambs did not develop diarrhoea, and two animals had diarrhoea that lasted for only 1 and 3 days, respectively. Moreover, in five of the six lambs that acquired the infection, the mean prepatent period (7.8 AE 1.4 days) lasted significantly longer (P < 0.05) than in the other groups. The patent period lasted between 1 and 7 days (5.0 AE 2.4 days) and was significantly shorter (P < 0.05) than in control groups (treatment control and excipient control) and in the therapeutic treatment group. The mean score for oocyst shedding was 1.2 AE 0.5, which was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in the two control groups. In the group that received prophylactic/therapeutic treatment with Bobel-24 (500 mg/kg of body weight), diarrhoea lasted for a maximum of 4 days, one lamb did not develop diarrhoea and in the five remaining lambs the diarrhoea stopped before the end of the treatment. The onset of oocyst shedding was confirmed between 5 and 7 days of age (Table 1 ). The mean score was 1.8 AE 0.8, and the maximum score was recorded at 7 days of age and was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than the maximum score for the control groups (treatment control and excipient control). Oocyst shedding lasted between 3 and 8 days (6.0 AE 1.7 days) and was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in control groups (treatment control and excipient control) and in the therapeutic treatment group. During the experiment, one of the lambs died at age 18 days. At this moment, the lamb was not excreting oocysts, did not have diarrhoea, and no other enteropathogens associated with neonatal diarrhoea (rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium, or Salmonella) were detected in its faeces. All of the lambs treated with Bobel-24 (500 mg/kg of body weight) for 6 days following confirmation of infection continued to excrete oocysts for between 8 and 12 days (10.0 AE 1.5 days). Only two lambs developed diarrhoea that lasted between 2 and 6 days, respectively ( Table 1) . None of the lambs became reinfected throughout the study. Significant differences in weight gain were only observed between age 0 and 15 days ( Table 2) . During this period, the prophylactically/ therapeutically treatment 1 group (Bobel-24 at 50 mg/ kg) gained significantly more weight than the prophylactic/therapeutic treatment 2 group, the therapeutic treatment group and the treatment control group. However, it did not gain significantly more weight than the two other control groups (uninfected/untreated and excipient).
