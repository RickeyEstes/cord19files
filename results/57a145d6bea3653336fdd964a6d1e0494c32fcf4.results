From 31 December 2016 to 8 February 2017, the Ngogo chimpanzee community of Kibale National Park, Uganda ( Figure S1 ), experienced an outbreak of severe respiratory disease. During the same period, the nearby Kanyawara community ( Figure S1 ) also experienced a respiratory disease outbreak. At the onset of the epidemics, Ngogo community consisted of 205 chimpanzees from <1 year to 67 years old, and Kanyawara community consisted of 55 chimpanzees from <1 year to 51 years old. Epidemic curves ( Figure 1) show that the Ngogo and Kanyawara outbreaks each occurred in a single phase, with most cases occurring in January 2017. At Ngogo, 43.8% of chimpanzees observed between 3 December 2016 and 28 February 2017 exhibited respiratory signs. At Kanyawara, 69.1% of chimpanzees observed during the same period exhibited respiratory signs. At Ngogo, 25 chimpanzees (12.2%) died during the outbreak period (Figure 1 ). In contrast, no chimpanzees at Kanyawara died during the outbreak period, with the exception of a female recovering from disease who died following conspecific aggression (see below). Respiratory signs consisted of coughing, sneezing, dyspnea, and nasal exudate; other signs included lethargy, immobility, and dramatic loss of body condition ( Figure S2 ). Epidemiologic modelling of the Ngogo and Kanyawara outbreaks (Table 1 and Figure S3 ) yielded daily transmission rate estimates of 1.13 and 0.338, and durations of infectivity of 1.12 and 4.55 days, respectively. These parameters yielded basic reproductive numbers (R 0 ) of 1.27 and 1.48 for Ngogo and Kanyawara, respectively. These are similar to values estimated from an outbreak of rhinovirus C in Kanyawara in 2013 (Table 1 ) during which 8.9% of chimpanzees died, and to published values for the human "common cold" [10] . However, 95% confidence limits around these estimates were non-overlapping for daily transmission rates of all three outbreaks and duration of infectivity and R 0 in Ngogo (both lower than in Kanyawara in 2013 or 2016/2017). Risk factor analysis (Table S2) showed that age significantly predicted morbidity at both Ngogo (χ 2 = 10.097, DF = 3, p = 0.018) and Kanyawara (χ 2 = 12.154, DF = 3, p = 0.007). In both communities, respiratory signs were least frequently observed among infants and increased through successive age categories. Sex did not affect morbidity or mortality at Ngogo, but females were significantly more likely to exhibit respiratory signs at Kanyawara than were males (χ 2 = 6.310, DF = 1, p = 0.012). At Ngogo, age predicted mortality (χ 2 = 19.153, DF = 3, p < 0.001), with mortality highest among infants (OR 5.01, 95% CI: 1.53-19.56) and individuals ≥30 years old (OR 3.86, 95% CI: 1. 16-15.15 ), compared to intermediate ages. At Ngogo, the carcass of a 20-year-old female chimpanzee was recovered immediately after the onset of respiratory signs and subsequent death. Post-mortem analysis of this individual revealed consolidation of the dependent lobes of both lungs and a serosanguinous pericardial effusion but no other gross pathologic abnormalities ( Figure S4 ). At Kanyawara, the carcass of a 22-year-old female chimpanzee was recovered approximately 10 days after having recovered from respiratory signs (but still remaining weak), immediately after having been attacked by conspecifics (for unclear reasons). Post-mortem analysis of this individual showed severe, diffuse pleuropneumonia with fibrinous adhesions to the thoracic wall and severe consolidation of all lobes of both lungs, as well as a serosanguinous pericardial effusion ( Figure S4 ). Analysis of paired fecal samples (prior to and during the outbreak period) using a Luminex assay that tests for a suite of human respiratory agents revealed different viral etiologies for each community ( Table 2) . Metapneumovirus (MPV, Pneumoviridae: Metapneumovirus) was detected in 7 of 11 individuals (63.6%) from Ngogo chimpanzees exhibiting clinical signs during, but not before, the outbreak period (Fisher's exact P = 0.0030). Human respirovirus 3 (HRV3; Paramyxoviridae; Respirovirus, formerly known as parainfluenza virus 3) was detected in 5 of 14 individuals (35.7%) from Kanyawara chimpanzees exhibiting clinical signs during, but not before, the outbreak period (Fisher's exact P = 0.0005). Adenoviruses (Adenoviridae) were present in samples from both Ngogo (36.4%) and Kanyawara (78.6%) but showed no association with the outbreak period (Fisher's exact P = 0.4545 and 0.5291, respectively) and have been previously characterized in this population at comparable frequencies [10] . Enteroviruses (Picornaviridae) were also present at low frequency in samples from both communities, similarly showed no association with the outbreak period (Fisher's exact P = 1.000 in both cases), and have also been previously characterized in this population at comparable frequencies [10] . Metagenomic analysis of respiratory tract swab samples from the chimpanzee examined postmortem at Ngogo yielded 16,107,924 reads after trimming, of which 27,393 assembled to yield a coding-complete MPV genome of 13,230 bases with average coverage of 196, consistent with the Luminex results described above. This genome (GenBank accession number MH428626) was most similar (98.69%) to a 2010 human-derived variant from Brazil (GenBank accession number MG431250). Intriguingly, the virus was nearly as similar (98.67%) to a variant from a mountain gorilla from Rwanda in 2008 (GenBank accession number HM197719) detected during a lethal outbreak [21] . MPV RNA was present in all sections of the respiratory tract, including the lung parenchyma, with the proportion of viral sequence reads declining monotonically from the upper to the lower respiratory tract ( Figure S5 ). Sequencing of a 480 nucleotide portion of the viral F gene from fecal samples was successful for three other Luminex-positive chimpanzees at Ngogo (AB, MI and WI; Table 2 ), yielding identical sequences within this variable genomic region (Gen-Bank accession numbers MH428628-MH428630). By contrast, neither HRV3 nor any other virus was detected in the respiratory tract of the chimpanzee that died at Kanyawara, likely reflecting prior infection and viral clearance. A coding-complete HRV3 genome (15,407 bases) was therefore reconstructed from a fecal sample from this same individual collected when she was coughing approximately 2 weeks earlier, using PCR with virus-specific primers and Sanger sequencing (Table S1 ). This genome (GenBank accession number MH428627) was most similar (99.38%) to a 2009 human-derived variant from the USA (Gen-Bank accession number KY674929). Sequencing of a variable and epidemiologically informative 348nucleotide portion of the viral F gene from fecal samples was successful for three other Luminex-positive chimpanzees at Kanyawara (AL, AN and AZ; Table 2 ), yielding identical sequences within this genomic region (GenBank accession numbers MH428631-MH428633). Re-analysis of respiratory tract metagenomic data from this individual and the individual from Ngogo revealed that a small proportion of reads in the upper respiratory tracts of both animals (0.05% and 0.16%, respectively) mapped to the reference genome of Staphylococcus pneumoniae (GenBank accession number NC_003098), which can infect chimpanzees secondarily during viral respiratory disease outbreaks [9, 22] , indicating the presence of this or a related bacterium; however no reads mapped to this organism in the lungs of either animal. Phylogenetic analysis revealed MPV from the Ngogo outbreak to sort within a sub-clade of subtype B2 [23] viruses from Brazil, Peru, Rwanda and the USA ( Figure 2 ). This sub-clade contains recently collected viruses (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) , including the mountain gorilla variant from Rwanda. The MPV variant from Ngogo belongs to a different subtype than a previously reported B1 virus from a chimpanzee outbreak in Tanzania [7] , and it is less closely related to a previously reported B2 subtype from a chimpanzee outbreak in Cote d'Ivoire [1] than to other variants within its subclade, including the gorilla-derived variant, based on the available 867 nucleotide region of the viral P gene (GenBank accession numbers EU240454-EU240456; not shown). Phylogenetic analysis revealed HRV3 from the Kanyawara outbreak to sort within a sub-clade of highly similar human-derived viruses from Peru and the USA collected between 2006 and 2015 (no more recently than other sub-clades; Figure 2 ). Notably, HRV3 from Kanyawara was divergent from viruses from other non-human primates, including viruses from wild Zambian baboons (Papio cynocephalus) [24] and simian agent 10, originally isolated from a blue monkey (Cercopithecus mitis) in South Africa [25] .
