Potentiating Activity ofPolyclonal Antibodies. The effect of complexing antigen with specific polyclonal antibodies on presentation by macrophages to a specific T hybridoma clone is illustrating in Fig. 1 . Exposing T cells to antigen alone results in detectable stimulation only when antigen concentration is >3 Ag/ml (Fig. 1 a) . In contrast, in the presence of rabbit anti-GZ (RaGZ) polyclonal antibodies at 1 :250 and 1 :50 dilution, antigen concentration of 0.3 htg/ml is stimulatory (b and c) . Higher antibody concentration inhibits potentiation (d) and also prevents presentation of a stimulatory dose of antigen (e) . When appropriate complexes are used (1 :50 RaGZ, 1 Ftg/ml GZ ; (c), the peak production of IL-2 is higher than in the presence of optimal concentration of free antigen at 10 Ag/ml. This suggested that we explore more accurately the effect of antigen/antibody ratio in the system . Effect ofAntigen/Antibody Rutia GZ was mixed with increasing concentrations of RaGZ. The precipitation curve (Fig.  2 , solid line) was determined, and the macrophage-mediated stimulatory effect of the various complexes on T cells was evaluated as shown in Fig. 2 a. The dashed line indicates IL-2 production by T cells in the presence of immune complexes at the same ratios as used for the precipitation experiment . Similar curves were obtained with three additional T hybridoma clones (data not shown) . In all cases, optimal stimulation was obtained with complexes in moderate antibody 39 Manca et al. To eliminate any potential interference of serum proteins other than antibodies, the experiment was repeated with affinity-purified antibodies. Fig. 2 b confirms that in this case also, complexes with extreme antibody excess are no longer effective for potentiation, and that potentiation occurs with complexes at optimal ratio (equivalence or moderate excess) . Figure 3 . T cells respond to antigen complexed at optimal ratio at a 2-log lower dose than antigen alone. Complexes corresponding to optimal ratio (solid circles) and to extreme antibody excess (open circles) in Fig . 2 were prepared with GZ and with RaGZ . After incubation for 1 h, the complexes were serially diluted and tested for capacity to induce T cell activation. Final concentration of complexed or free antigen (squares) is on the abscissa. As little as 0 .015 t~g/ml GZ induces a detectable stimulation of T cells . GZ at stimulatory concentration when in free form (8 tug/ml) no longer stimulates when complexed in extreme antibody excess . Fig. 3 shows a titration curve ofcomplexes at different ratios. Complexes were prepared by mixing the reactants and were diluted after incubation . As little as 15 ng/ml antigen can be detected in complexes with optimal ratio. In contrast, complexes with excess antibodies were nonstimulatory even when final antigen concentration was stimulatory by itself. This indicates that antibody excess blocks potentiation in the first case and inhibits presentation in the second case.
