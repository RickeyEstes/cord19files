Results of the literature review are summarized in Table  1 , with details on study design, population sizes, and major findings provided in Table 2 . The search for hand hygiene studies yielded 12 studies (eight on handwashing with soap and water, 17-23 one on hand antisepsis with antimicrobial handwipes, 24 and three on both handwashing and hand antisepsis through hand rubs, gels, or handwipes). [25] [26] [27] Two of the 12 studies were conducted in elementary schools, 17, 18 five in child daycare settings, 19 -21,25,26 one in a senior daycare center, 27 and four at military recruit training sites. [22] [23] [24] Ten were intervention trials, 17-22,24 -27 and two were observation studies. 22, 23 Four of the intervention trials tested the effect of care givers' hand hygiene on the disease rates of care receivers, 21, [25] [26] [27] while the remainder evaluated reduction in respiratory symptoms and related absences post-intervention. The intervention trials were limited in that compliance and quality of handwashing were not quantified, and two of the trials did not have concurrent control groups, but rather compared disease rates with the previous years' rates. 22, 27 The observation studies were limited by their reliance on self-administered questionnaires to determine the extent of handwashing. 22, 23 Overall, nine of the 12 hand-hygiene studies reported that hand hygiene reduced the occurrence of respiratory diseases. 18 -24,27 Three of the hand hygiene studies that showed a convincing effect among young adults were conducted at military recruit training centers. Two were done at the Naval Recruit Training Center, Great Lakes IL and published as a single paper. 22 The third was an Air Force study. 24 The two Navy studies evaluated the same intervention. 22 The intervention included training given to recruits and their training staff, a mandatory policy of handwashing at least five times a day, encouragement of sink use, and emphasis on hand hygiene as a criterion for personnel inspections. The first study found that respiratory disease rates decreased by 45% compared to the previous year. A sustained effect was seen for an additional year after the study ceased. In the second study, a cross-sectional survey of a subset of recruits, self-reported respiratory illness and hospitalization rates were higher among recruits who did not wash their hands more than three times daily. The Air Force study was a randomized, double-blind clinical trial of antimicrobial handwipes. 24 Recruits were given packets of handwipes and instructed to use them four times daily. 24 Intervention handwipes con-tained parachlorometaxylenol (PCMX) and alcohol. Control handwipes contained water and lemon juice. These were assigned randomly to training groups during the same time period. The training groups were similar in all respects but had very little contact with each other during their 6-week training period. Initial clinic visits for ARD were 33% lower (p ϭ0.021) and clinic visits for sore throats were 40% lower (p ϭ0.009) in the intervention groups. Although evidence regarding masks as a personal protective measure is lacking, senior military preventive medicine officials reported that surgical masks had been used as a NOVARDI for military recruits. A newspaper article reported that the use of masks was associated with declining ARD rates at Fort Benning GA, and Fort Jackson SC; however, no reports were found to document or quantify the effect. 28 Literature regarding administrative NOVARDIs was found on cohorting (limiting contact between defined training groups to reduce disease transmission) and reducing crowding. Five observational studies contained data that supported cohorting. However, these studies had no comparison groups and the degree of cohorting was not measured. 29 -32 Five studies-one that included data collected at Fort Humphreys VA, 33 during the influenza pandemic of 1918 -1919, three studies of children in other countries (including developing countries), 34 -36 and one from a recruit ARD outbreak 32 -found an association between respiratory disease rates and crowded conditions. The study from Fort Humphreys had incomplete controls of confounders and incomplete density assessment. Due to the poor living conditions, the studies of children may not be generalized to all populations. Despite these flaws, the conclusion from these studies was that reducing crowding would have a favorable impact on the occurrence of ARD. Medical literature queries on "head-to-toe" sleeping arrangements to increase the distance between personal breathing zones yielded no studies. The aforementioned study at Fort Humphreys discussed the use of cloth barriers/curtains (also called "sneeze sheets") to form "cubicles" for separate beds; the authors attribute one group's low incidence of influenza to the use of separation curtains. However, there was inadequate controls of other factors to assertively conclude a positive effect. Literature regarding engineering NOVARDIs was found on indoor air exchanges, dilution ventilation, dust suppression, and air sterilization. Two studies addressing indoor air exchanges by dilution ventilation were identified. A study at Fort Benning GA, published in 1988, noted that modern, energy-efficient Army barracks had significantly higher ARD rates than drafty, older barracks at the same Army post (adjusted relative riskϭ1.51; 95% confidence intervalϭ1. 46 -1.56) . 37 This study, however, had little quantification of barracks' ventilation. During an ADV type-4 outbreak at Fort Benning in 2000, lack of mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with infection in univariate analysis; however, since no cases slept in areas with operating air handlers, mechanical ventilation could not be included in the multivariate analysis. 31 No population-based studies on the impact of air filter efficiency on the occurrence of respiratory disease were found. Five studies evaluating the impact of dust suppression were identified. 38 -42 Oiling of floors and blankets were associated with a reduction in respiratory disease in four studies. 38 -40,42 Oiling failed to prevent ARD outbreaks in the fifth study. 31 One population-based study demonstrated a positive effect from air sterilization using glycol vapors. 43 Ten population-based studies of air sterilization using ultraviolet (UV) lights were identified 41,44 -52 : Three were conducted in schools, 44, 47, 51 four in military training settings, 41, 46, 48, 49 one in an entire community, 50 one in a dormitory, 45 and one in office buildings. 52 Seven studies supported UV lights as a means to reduce ARD rates, 41,44,46,48 -50,52 although the measured effects in two studies were small. 44, 50 It was concluded from the four military studies 41, 46, 48, 49 that larger effects were observed only with high UV irradiation, and the effect was considered to be too low to recommend its use. 48
