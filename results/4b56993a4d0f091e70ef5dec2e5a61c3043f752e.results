In order to gain a better understanding about the performance of the Deep-Tracer we will apply it to a test set of 30 experimental density maps and evaluate the predictions using different metrics. Additionally, we will compare its performance against Phenix, as well as the C-CNN backbone prediction method. We measure the accuracy of a predicted protein structure by comparing it to its corresponding solved structure using the following metrics. First, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) value describes the average distance between atoms of the predicted and solved protein structure. This gives us an idea how close the predicted atoms are to their correct counter parts. However, this does not give us any information about the percentage of atoms that we have correctly identified. For this purpose, we calculate the coverage value, which expresses the percentage of atoms in the solved structure that lay within 3Å of a predicted atom. Finally, we evaluate the false-positive percentage which is the number of atoms that were predicted further than 3Å from any atom in the solved structure, divided by the total number of predicted atoms. In addition to the metrics that we use to compare the other methods to the DeepTracer, we also calculate the secondary structure and amino acid type accuracy. We cannot evaluate these for the other methods as they utilize the U-Net confidence maps rather than the predicted protein structure. The secondary structure accuracy is defined as the percentage of atoms from the solved structure whose secondary structure type equals the one predicted by the U-Net for its location. The amino acid type accuracy is calculated in the same way. In Table 1 , we can see the test results for all 30 density maps. 2 Number of Cα atoms in the solved protein structure 3 Percentage of atoms that were predicted further than 3A away from any atoms in the solved structure 4 Percentage of atoms from the solved structure that lay within 1A of a predicted atom 5 Percentage of atoms from the solved structure for which the U-Net correctly predicted the secondary structure 6 Percentage of atoms from the solved structure for which the U-Net correctly predicted the amino acid type (missing entries indicate that the solved structure did not contain amino acid type information) .

We can see in the highlighted areas that the DeepTracer incorrectly connected amino acids in two cases. However, all predicted amino acids are still connected as a single chain. In comparison to that the prediction of Phenix is fragmented into multiple chains. Furthermore, amino acids appear to be missing from the prediction explaining the coverage difference of 8.1% (see Table 1 ). The predicted secondary structure elements in the Phenix prediction, particularly for sheets, appear also much less accurate than the ones made by the DeepTracer. Another noteworthy observation, although not a fair comparison as Phenix predicts more than just the backbone structure, is that the prediction runtime of Phenix for the EMD-6272 map was 1 hour and 45 minutes while the runtime of the DeepTracer for the same map was 40 seconds. As mentioned in the introduction, a central goal of the DeepTracer was to improve the runtime of protein structure predictions. This makes it possible to predict ever larger density maps which allows for a more versatile application of the method. In order to compare the runtime of the Deep-Tracer with the C-CNN method we measure the execution time of each method for the prediction of multiple density maps. A scatter plot of the measured times is depicted in Fig 10.   Fig 10. Scatter plot of prediction runtimes (y-axis) of the DeepTracer (blue) and the C-CNN method (red) for various density maps against the number of predicted atoms (x-axis). In order to see the runtimes more clearly, we use a logarithmic scale with a base of 4. In order to evaluate the runtime of the DeepTracer for larger proteins we predicted the EMD-4903 density map (echovirus 1 intact particle). The number of predicted atoms for this map was 32,446. The execution of the end-to-end prediction pipeline of the DeepTracer took only two hours. As a point of comparison, the expected runtime of the C-CNN method for the same density map is more than 5 days assuming the trend in In addition to the location and secondary structure of amino acids, the DeepTracer also predicts their types. As reported in Table 1 we assigned the correct type out of the 20 possible amino acid types with an accuracy of 25.2%. In order to get a better idea of what that result means we look at a specific structure prediction. For the EMD-6272 density map, we predicted the correct amino acid type for 31.49% of amino acids. Note that this is predicted solely from 3D map without using any genetic information of the protein.

The sequence was created by walking along the predicted chain of amino acids and noting down the type of each amino acid. The predicted amino acids from 3D could potentially be utilized for the reference of future full-atom structure prediction.
