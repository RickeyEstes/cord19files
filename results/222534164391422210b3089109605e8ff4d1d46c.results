SARS-CoV PLpro induced TGF-β1 production in human lung epithelial cells. Our prior study demonstrated SARS-CoV PLpro triggering the TGFβ 1 production in human promonocytes 13 , whether SARS PLpro induced TGF-β 1 production in human lung epithelial A549 cells was further examined. Transient transfection of A549 cells with empty vector or pSARS-PLpro was performed to analyze the TGF-β 1 production induced by SARS PLpro. Quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blotting indicated transfection with pSARS-PLpro increasing the mRNA and protein levels of PLpro in A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, but not empty control vector ( Fig. 1A-D) . Meanwhile, relative mRNA levels of TGF-β 1 in A549 cells were time-and concentration-dependently elevated following the transient transfection with pSARS-PLpro, but not vector control ( Fig. 2A) . Immunofluorescence staining assays indicated the protein levels of TGF-β 1 obviously heightening in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro compared to vector control (Fig. 2B ). For examining the TGF-β 1 induction of SARS-CoV PLpro in different cell lines, Huh7 (human hepatocarcinoma), H1299 (human non-small cell lung carcinoma), and ca9-22 (human oral cancer) cells were also evaluated (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). Real-time RT PCR analysis of transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro indicated that a lower level of TGF-β 1 mRNA was detected in transfected H1299 cells compared to transfected A549 cells, but no significant level was found in transfected Huh7 and ca9-22 cells. In addition, comparison of the expression levels of PLpro and TGF-β 1 among transfected cells with empty vector, pSARS-PLpro, and pBAC-SARSCoVΔ ES (a non-infectious SARS-CoV replicon) was further performed (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). The expression level of PLpro in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro was 25-fold higher than the cells transfected with pBAC-SARSCoVΔ ES. A dose-dependent increase of TGF-β 1 mRNA levels in A549 cells was induced by pSARS-PLpro and pBAC-SARSCoVΔ ES, respectively. Meanwhile, recombinant plasmids containing PLpro genes of MERS-CoV and HCoV NL63 (pMERS-PLpro, and pNL63-PLpro) were used for testing the specificity on the TGF-β 1 induction compared to pSARS-PLpro (Supplemental Fig. 3) . Interestingly, only SARS-CoV PLpro, but not ERS-CoV and HCoV NL63 PLpro, dose-dependently up-regulated the mRNA expression of TGF-β 1. Therefore, the result demonstrated that SARS-CoV PLpro plays an important role in triggering a significant increase of TGF-β 1 mRNA and protein levels in human lung epithelial cells. TGF-β1-dependent up-regulation of pro-fibrotic genes by PLpro. To evaluate the correlation between TGF-β 1 production and pro-fibrotic gene expression in PLpro-expressing cells, mRNA and protein levels of pro-fibrotic genes such as vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in transfected cells were assessed using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting (Fig. 3) . The mRNA levels of vimentin and GFAP were up-regulated in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro, but not vector control (Fig. 3A,B) . Besides, Western blotting showed the plasmid dose-dependent increase of vimentin proteins in PLpro-expressing cells, but not in vector controls (Fig. 3C,D) . Next, a selective inhibitor of TGF-β 1 receptor (SB-431542) was used to test the association of pro-fibrotic gene up-regulation with the TGF-β 1 induction in PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 3E) . SB-431542 exhibited a dose-dependently inhibitory effect on SARS-PLpro-induced expression of vimentin (Fig. 3D) . The result demonstrated SARS-CoV PLpro initiating TGF-β 1-dependent up-regulation of pro-fibrotic genes in human lung epithelial cells.
