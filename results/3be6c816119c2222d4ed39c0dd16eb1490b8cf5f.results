HCoV-NL63 S1 truncation variants bind ACE2 The S protein of HCoV-NL63 is composed of 1356 amino acids, including a 179-residue N-terminal fragment not present in other coronaviruses (Fouchier et al., 2004; . This fragment has been suggested to contribute to ACE2 recognition (Hofmann et al., 2005) . To test this possibility, four truncation variants of the HCoV-NL63 spike protein, encoding residues 16-200, 16-334, 16-749 and 198-749 , were generated. These S1 variants were expressed as fusion proteins containing the Fc region of human IgG1 (S1-Ig), as previously described (Li et al., 2005c; Wong et al., 2004) . Plasmids encoding these fusion proteins were transfected into HEK293T cells, which were subsequently incubated in 293SFM II medium for 48 h. Proteins were then purified with protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Fig. 1A) , and 1 μg of each protein was incubated with HEK293T cells transfected with a plasmid expressing human ACE2. Transfected cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1B , S1-Ig variants encoding residues 16-749 and 198-749 efficiently bound ACE2-expressing cells, whereas variants encoding 16-200 and 16-334 did not. Thus, important determinants of ACE2 association are located between residue 198 and 749, and the unique N-terminal region of HCoV-NL63 S protein does not contribute to receptor binding. These data are consistent with those previously reported by Hofmann et al. (2006) . Fig. 1B also underscores the substantially higher efficiency with which SARS-CoV S protein binds ACE2, compared with that of HCoV-NL63. To further define the receptor-binding region of the spike protein, additional truncation variants of S1-Ig were similarly made and characterized (Fig. 1C ). Variants that included residues 198-701, 301-749, and 301-643 efficiently bound ACE2-expressing cells, whereas twelve additional smaller variants could not detectably bind these cells. The 301-643 variant consistently bound cells less efficiently than the 301-749 S1-Ig variant. Therefore residues between amino acids 301 and 643 make substantial contributions to ACE2 recognition, and those between amino acids 643 and 701 may also contribute, directly or indirectly, to receptor binding. Our subsequent assays utilized the 301-749 S1-Ig variant, described below as S1-Ig(301-749). Alteration of asparagine 578 to tyrosine increases the affinity of HCoV-NL63 S1-Ig(301-749) for ACE2 The structure of the SARS-CoV RBD complexed with human ACE2 has been determined (Li et al., 2005a) . The RBD contains two subdomains, a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet core, and an extended loop including residues 424-494, described as the receptor-binding motif (RBM). Fourteen residues of the RBM, six of which are tyrosines, directly contact ACE2. A region of HCoV-NL63 S1, between residues 577 and 597, aligns with the SARS-CoV RBM ( Fig. 2A) . To determine the contribution of this region to ACE2 association, we converted several residues of S1-Ig(301-749) to their putative SARS-CoV equivalents. In most cases, these changes reduced ACE2 association. However, alteration of S1-Ig(301-749) asparagine 578 to tyrosine (N578Y) resulted in substantially more efficient binding to ACE2 (Fig. 2B ). The consistent ability of changes in this region to alter the efficiency of ACE2 association suggests that this region of the HCoV-NL63 S protein contributes to ACE2 binding. Fig. 2C highlights SARS-CoV tyrosine 475, proposed here to be analogous to the N578Y alteration of HCoV-NL63 S1-Ig(301-749).
