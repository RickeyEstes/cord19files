The role of the 3 0 NTR cis-acting sequences and/ or structures in PVX RNA accumulation was studied by solution structure probing and by introducing wild-type (w.t.) and mutant transcripts into tobacco protoplasts for analysis of minus and plusstrand RNA accumulation by S 1 nuclease protection assays. Solution structure analyses indicate multiple stem-loop structures in the 3 0 NTR of PVX RNA The predicted secondary structure for the 3 0 250 nt region of PVX RNA was generated using the Zuker Mfold program (Figure 2(B) ). The thermodynamic energy dot plot shown in Figure  2 (A) represents all secondary structures for the 250 nt sequence within 10% of the minimal energy. The triangle below the diagonal represents the most optimal folding of the minimum energy structure, with the rows of dots corresponding to nucleotide positions involved in pairing and the gaps within the rows indicating internal loops or bulges. The triangle above the diagonal represents sub-optimal foldings within 4 kcal (1 cal ¼ 4.184 J) of minimum free energy of the optimal folding. The dark dots represent optimal pairings and alternative folding patterns are represented by progressively lighter dots, with the lightest dots representing the least-favored pairing. Regions that are scattered with differently shaded dots exhibit multiple folding possibilities. The 3 0 NTR (nucleotides 6364-6435 plus 17 A residues) of PVX RNA was predicted to contain three stemloop structures, denoted SL1, SL2 and SL3 in the 3 0 to 5 0 direction (Figure 2 (A) and (B)). As seen in Figure 2 (A), SL3 was strongly predicted, but SL1 had some scatter near the base of the stem. The region containing SL2 and the region between SL2 and SL3 contained considerable scatter, suggesting multiple pairing possibilities. Similar structures were obtained when foldings were done with additional residues from the Spe I site. The secondary structure predicted by STAR program strongly supported the existence of SL3. There was no stable pseudoknot predicted in the 3 0 region of PVX RNA. Chemical and enzymatic probing experiments were conducted to analyze the solution structure of the 3 0 NTR of PVX RNA. For chemical modification experiments, dimethyl sulfate (DMS) was used to modify unpaired A (at N-1) and C (at N-3) residues and N-cyclohexyl-N 0 -[2-(Nmethyl-4-morpholinio)-ethyl]-carboiimide p-toluenesulfonate (CMCT) was used to modify unpaired U residues (at N-3). Samples were analyzed using Rnase T 1 and Rnase V 1 to detect unpaired G residues and base-paired or stacked helical regions, respectively. Reaction conditions for both the chemical modification and the RNase digestion were optimized such that less than one nucleotide per RNA molecule was modified. The extent of modification and cleavage was analyzed by primer extension of the products and subsequent gel electrophoresis. A particular nucleotide was considered reactive if the intensity of the extended product signal was stronger in the modified (þ ) lane than that in the unmodified (2 ) lane. Transcripts derived from clone p10, containing 185 nt of the PVX RNA 3 0 region were used for the enzymatic cleavage experiments and full-length PVX transcripts derived from clone pMON8453 were utilized for the chemical modification experiments. Comparison of these transcripts and viral RNA resulted in similar modification patterns (data not shown). A summary of the data obtained from these experiments was superimposed on the most stable 3 0 NTR structure (DG-55.6 Kcal/mole) predicted by the Zuker program (Figure 2(B) ). Autoradiographs corresponding to some of these data are shown in Figures 3 and 4 . RNase V 1 cleaved many of the nucleotides in the stem of SL1 and none was reactive to DMS, indicating base-pairing or stacking in this region. Lack of modification in the 3 0 end of the lower region of SL1 was due to protection by primers used in the reverse transcription reactions. Exceptions to the predicted pairing were indicated by susceptibility of G6415 to Rnase T 1 (Figures 2(B) and 4(A)) and U6412 to CMCT (Figure 3(B) ). Although the nucleotides in the predicted mismatch were not modified by DMS, it was not susceptible to RNase V 1 . The terminal loop residue G6423 was cleaved by RNase T 1 , suggesting that it was not paired, but none of the other terminal loop residues was accessible to DMS or CMCT. In contrast, all of the loop residues were accessible to RNase V 1 . Thus, it appears that the upper stem region of SL1 may be base-paired as predicted, and that the terminal loop residues of SL1 may be stacked or be involved in pairing with nucleotides located elsewhere. The lower region of the predicted stem region appears to be more flexible and may form alternative structures, which is consistent with the thermodynamic energy dot plot ( Figure 2 (A)). Although SL2 is not strongly predicted and has considerable scatter compared to SL3 and SL1 ( Figure 2 (A)), the solution structure probing does suggest that the predicted structure is somewhat maintained (Figure 2(B) ). Of the loop residues, U6399, U6402 and U6404-7 were all strongly modified by CMCT (Figure 3 (B)); A6403, A6400, A6398 and C6397 were modified by DMS ( Figure  3 (A)). Similarly, G6401 in this loop had strong reaction with Rnase T 1 (Figure 4(A) ). In contrast, U6394 -96 exhibited low-level modification by CMCT, as seen in Figure 3 (B). Low reactivity of A6392 to DMS (Figure 3(A) ) and G6411 to RNase T 1 (Figure 4 (A)), combined with weak or absent reactivity of some loop residues, may indicate that alternative structures can form. Since SL1 is predicted to be immediately adjacent to predicted SL2, it is possible that these two stems are co-axially stacked.
