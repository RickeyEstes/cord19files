A community resource. The complete immunological data set of 460 wild mice is provided as a community resource (Supplementary Data 1). From this we compare in detail a subset of 181 wild mice (100 male, 81 female) from a single site (site HW, Fig. 1a , Supplementary Table 1) with 64 laboratoryreared, pathogen-free C57BL/6 (24 male, 40 female) mice. The results of this comparison are shown in Tables 1,2 and Supplementary Table 2 , the latter being too large to fit within the main text of the article. Wild mice are immunologically different from laboratory mice. Serological and morphometric parameters for the wild (HW) and laboratory (C57/BL6) mice are summarized in Table 1 . The wild mice were much smaller than the laboratory mice (weighing only half as much) and among the wild mice, age, body length and mass were all highly correlated (length and mass, Pearson correlations (two-tailed) r ¼ 0.79; age and mass, rZ0.77; age and length, r ¼ 0.58, Po0.001, n480 for male and female mice separately) (Supplementary Data 2). The wild mice had a median age of 6.6 weeks (range 1-39.5) and many immune parameters correlated with age and size, likely due to cumulative exposure to infection (Supplementary Data 2). From 62 immunological measures most (57 measures) differed between wild and laboratory mice (Table 1, Table 2, Supplementary Table 2 ). Among the wild mice there were very few (6 of 62 measures) significant immunological differences between male and female mice, while the laboratory mice were more (18 of 62 measures) immunologically sexually dimorphic (Table 1, Table 2, Supplementary Table 2 ). Multilocus genotyping shows that the HW wild mice are an unstructured, genetically diverse population (Fig. 1b,  Supplementary Data 3) . The wild mice are genetically distinct from ten laboratory mouse strains, and the laboratory strains are more genetically diverse than are the wild mice. We suggest that this genetic relationship between the wild and laboratory mice is explained by the mosaicisim of laboratory mouse genomes 4 , by the fact that laboratory mice have been deliberately separated from each other for many generations, and by the fact that laboratory strains are largely homozygous. Wild mice carry a substantial burden of infection. We screened the wild mice for evidence of infection with viruses and Mycoplasma pulmonis, and for evidence of ectoparasite and intestinal nematode infection; suppliers confirmed the laboratory mice to be infection free. The seroprevalence of the different microbial infections ranged from 22% for minute virus to 92% for parvovirus (n ¼ 153 for both analyses; Supplementary Table 3) . Wild mice were commonly infected with the Oxyurid nematode Syphacia spp. (prevalence 91%) and with the mite Myocoptes musculinus (prevalence 82%) (n ¼ 181 in both cases). Infection of wild mice was very common: all wild mice had been infected with at least one pathogen and only 5% (8 of 153) were seronegative for all the viruses and M. pulmonis. There was no effect of sex on the intensity or prevalence of infection (Supplementary Table 3 ). Wild mice have very high concentrations of serum proteins. In wild mice, serum concentrations of IgG and IgE were 20-and 200-fold higher, respectively, in wild mice than in the laboratory mice (Fig. 2) . Among wild mice, IgE concentrations were significantly higher among females than among males (Table 1) . By contrast, faecal IgA concentrations did not differ significantly between wild and laboratory mice (Fig. 2 , Table 1 ). Wild mice also had significantly higher serum concentrations of the acute phase proteins, serum amyloid P component (SAP) and haptoglobin than laboratory mice (Fig. 2, Table 1 ). These differences were not due to higher total serum protein concentrations in wild mice since concentrations of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT)-a stable component of normal serum-did not differ between wild and laboratory mice (Fig. 2 , Table 1 ). Wild mice were more heterogeneous in their concentrations of immunoglobulins and acute phase proteins compared with laboratory mice (Fig. 2 Wild mouse splenocytes differ from those of laboratory mice. Spleens of wild mice were much smaller (approximately one third the mass) than those of laboratory mice and contained significantly fewer (approximately one fifth the number) viable mononuclear leucocytes (Table 1 ). More surprisingly, the spleens of wild mice were significantly proportionately smaller (that is, when compared with body mass) than those of laboratory mice (Table 1) . Ex vivo flow cytometric quantification and characterization of spleen cell populations (Figs 3-6, Supplementary Fig. 1 ) revealed that the wild mice had lower absolute numbers of T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils than laboratory mice, consistent with their lower absolute number of splenic mononuclear cells (Supplementary Data 1). But, proportionately, wild mouse spleens had significantly more T cells, a higher T:B cell ratio and more CD11b þ myeloid cells, but fewer NK cells and dendritic cells, than laboratory mice (Supplementary Table 2 ); the ratio of CD4 þ : CD8 þ T cells was also significantly higher in wild mice than in laboratory mice. These differences are consistent with accumulation of T helper cells and phagocytic cells in the spleens of wild mice in response to systemic infections. The status of CD4 þ and CD8 þ T cells was markedly different between wild and laboratory mice. For CD4 þ T cells significantly greater proportions were effector/effector memory Table 2 , Fig. 3a ). Although proportions of CD4 þ T cells that were Foxp3 þ CD25 þ T reg cells were marginally higher among wild than laboratory mice (Supplementary Table 2 , Fig. 3b ), this was insufficient to offset the much larger proportion of effector CD4 þ T cells such that ratios of effector CD4 þ T cells to T regs were significantly higher among wild than laboratory mice (Supplementary Table 2 ). Similarly, for CD8 þ T cells wild mice had a significantly higher proportion of effector/effector memory (CD62L À CD44 hi ) and terminally differentiated (KLRG1 þ ) cells than did laboratory mice (and so significantly lower proportions of naïve) (Fig. 3c,d) . Wild mice also had proportionately fewer central memory (CD62L þ CD44 hi ) CD8 þ T cells than laboratory mice; this difference was due in part to the low frequency of these cells in wild male mice (Supplementary Table 2 ), but may also reflect the relative distribution of antigen-experienced CD8 þ T cells between the memory and effector subsets. Again, the ratio of effector/ effector memory CD8 þ T cells to T regs was significantly higher in wild than laboratory mice (Supplementary Table 2) . Consistent with the idea that frequent or persistent pathogen challenge drives expansion of antigen-experienced CD4 þ and CD8 þ T-cell subsets in wild mice, there were significant positive correlations between the proportions of effector CD4 þ and CD8 þ T cells and age among female wild mice (Pearson correlations (two-tailed) age and effector CD4 þ r ¼ 0.62, Po0.0001, n ¼ 51; age and effector CD8 þ r ¼ 0.49, Po0.0001, n ¼ 50; Supplementary Data 2). Interestingly, these parameters were not strongly correlated with age in male wild mice (Pearson correlation (twotailed) ro0.1, P40.05, n ¼ 66) pointing to different immunological strategies of male and female mice in the wild. In contrast to the highly primed/effector status of splenic T cells, CD19 þ B lymphocytes of wild mice predominantly had a naïve phenotype. We categorized splenic CD19 þ B lymphocytes as naïve (CD38 þ IgD þ ), memory (CD38 þ IgD À GL7 À ) or germinal centre (CD38 lo IgD À GL7 hi ) cells 14 , and identified recently activated, antigen-experienced cells by their MHC class II expression and binding of peanut agglutinin (PNA; indicating expression of the PNA receptor, PNA-R) 15 (Fig. 4a ). Despite their very high serum immunoglobulin concentrations, spleens of wild mice contained significantly higher proportions of naïve B cells (and, reciprocally, significantly lower proportions of memory B cells) than the laboratory mice (Fig. 4b,c ). This initially counter-intuitive observation probably reflects reallocation of antigen-experienced B cells from the spleen to the bone marrow, to other lymphoid tissues, or to sites of infection, together with continual repopulation of the spleen by naïve, bone marrowderived B cells. Wild mice had proportionately more germinal centre B cells in their spleens than did laboratory mice and PNA binding was comparatively higher on all B-cell subsets in wild mice, consistent with recent activation 15 (Fig. 4d , Supplementary Table 2 ). Together these results point to high turnover of activated CD19 þ B cells in wild mouse spleens. Wild mice have a hitherto unknown myeloid cell population. We next identified myeloid cells as CD11b þ CD11c À (Fig. 5a ) and analysed their expression of F4/80 and Ly6G, revealing four subpopulations of F4/80 þ cells, denoted M1-M4 ( Fig. 5b-d) . These include F4/80 þ Ly6G À (M1) tissue resident macrophages, F4/80 þ Ly6G low (M2) monocytes/red pulp macrophages and F4/80 þ / À Ly6G high (M4) polymorphonuclear cells (PMN). The M4 PMN population could be further divided into neutrophils and myeloid-derived suppressor cells based on their forward and side  The table shows the body characteristics and serum protein concentrations for wild and laboratory mice, shown as medians (range; n). Statistical results show comparisons between sex within animal source (that is, laboratory or wild mice), and between animal source. Where there exists a significant difference between sex, mice were grouped by sex and animal source as: laboratory female, laboratory male, wild female and wild male (LF, LM, WF, WM, respectively), with Kruskal-Wallis H-tests (and post hoc, Dunn-Bonferonni, pairwise comparisons) conducted with significant differences reported. Where data were normal (that is, body length, body mass and spleen mass: body mass ratio) or could be transformed to normal (log10 transformation of age; untransformed data shown), the results of univariate GLMs are reported. All non-normal data were analysed by Mann-Whitney U-tests, unless stated otherwise. Asterisks denote significant differences as *Po0.05, **Po0.01, ***Po0.001. ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms14811 scatter characteristics (Fig. 5e ). Importantly, in wild, but not in laboratory, mice, we identified an additional population of F4/80 þ cells expressing levels of Ly6G that are intermediate between monocyte/macrophages and PMN (M3). As far as we are aware, this is a novel population of cells not previously described, which we have termed hyper-granulocytic myeloid cells (HGMC) on the basis of their forward and side scatter characteristics ( Fig. 5c-e) . Although there are some slight differences in levels of Ly6G expression between the M2 and M3/M4 populations in wild and laboratory mice (Fig. 5c ) back gating of each population on CD11b, CD11c, and forward and side scatter confirmed that the M2 populations in wild and laboratory mice are otherwise identical and that the Ly6G high population in laboratory mice is equivalent to the M4 population in wild mice (Fig. 5d) . Comparison of the side scatter for each population also confirms that the high side scatter, hypergranulocytic M3 population is indeed seen only in wild mice (Fig. 5f ). The functional significance of these cells is as yet unknown, but their discovery emphasizes that study of laboratory mice does not necessarily reveal the full armamentarium of the immune system. Wild mice not only had proportionally more CD11b þ CD11c À myeloid cells in their spleens than did laboratory mice but, within the myeloid population, PMN and HGMC were enriched at the expense of macrophages and monocytes (Fig. 5a ,f, Supplementary Table 2 ). The expansion and/or accumulation of neutrophils and HGMC in spleens of wild mice is consistent with recent or current exposure to infection in wild mice. Splenic CD11c þ dendritic cells were proportionately rarer in wild mice compared with laboratory mice (Fig. 5g , Supplementary Table 2) . Wild mouse NK cells are highly activated. We characterized NKp46 þ CD3e À NK cells (Fig. 6 ) as early (stage 1), mid (stage 2), late (stage 3) or fully (stage 4) mature cells by expression of CD27 and CD11b (Fig. 6a) . Wild mice had higher proportions of stage 1 and stage 2 cells and lower proportions of stage 3 and stage 4 splenic NK cells, resulting in significantly higher ratios of early/ mid-stage NK cells to late/mature NK cells than laboratory mice (Fig. 6b , Table 2 ). Expression of the recent/early activation marker CD69 was higher on all subsets of wild mouse NK cells compared with laboratory mice (Fig. 6c, Table 2 ) but-other than on stage 1 cells-expression of the KLRG1 terminal differentiation marker tended to be lower (Fig. 6, Table 2 ). Together, these data are consistent with activation, self-renewal and homeostatic expansion 16 , and hence higher rates of turnover, of splenic NK cells of wild mice compared with laboratory mice. We next explored the expression of the Ly49 family of C type lectin regulatory receptors on NK cells (Fig. 6e-h) reasoning that stochastic expression of Ly49 receptor family members on individual NK cells combined with population genetic diversity could lead to NK cell heterogeneity within an individual and extensive variation in NK cell phenotype among individuals 11 . Inhibitory Ly49 receptors recognize self-MHC class I and prevent NK cells from killing healthy cells, whereas Ly49 receptors that recognize pathogen associated ligands lead to NK cell activation and killing of infected cells; the best described example of this is binding of Ly49H to the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) m157 glycoprotein which mediates protective immunity to MCMV (ref. 17) . We analysed the expression of two activating receptors (Ly49D and Ly49H) and one inhibitory receptor (Ly49G2). For most C57BL/6 laboratory mice, NK cells expressed Ly49D, Ly49G and Ly49H (Fig. 6e-h) with 5-45% of NK cells expressing each of the receptors, consistent with previous reports 18 . In contrast very few wild mice had any Ly49H þ NK cells (10%, n ¼ 125, Z1% of Ly49H þ cells, Supplementary Data 1), suggesting that the gene encoding this receptor is rare in this wild mouse population or that allelic variation precludes recognition by the anti-Ly49H antibody. We genotyped mice at the Ly49h locus for a deletion that is associated with susceptibility to MCMV (ref. 17) , finding that 18% of the wild mice were homozygous for this deletion (95% confidence interval 9.5-30%, n ¼ 98 mice from HW site; frequency of deletion allele 0.42 assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium). This likely partially contributes to the scarcity of Ly49H þ NK cells among wild mice, but raises questions about the presence of additional null alleles at the Ly49h locus, and whether other receptors can compensate for the lack of Ly49H in wild mice, especially given the high prevalence of MCMV in the wild mouse populations, reported to be 62 and 79% (refs 19,20) . The apparent absence of Ly49H among the wild mice may explain their much more frequent expression of the alternative activating receptor Ly49D and suggests that there may be important differences between wild and laboratory mice in the contributions of NK cells to functional immunity. We identified three populations of Ly49G2 cells: Ly49G2 À , Ly49G2 low and Ly49G2 high (Fig. 6g) . Among wild mice most Ly49G2 þ cells were Ly49G2 low , whereas in laboratory mice Ly49G2 high cells predominated. This suggests the presence of different alleles at the Ly49G2 coding locus in the wild and laboratory populations. Among laboratory mice, interstrain differences in Ly49G receptor expression have been linked to allelic variation in promoter activity 21 and may influence the threshold for NK cell activation 18 . These data support the idea that there is extensive, hitherto undocumented, allelic diversity among Ly49 receptors with likely important consequences for NK cell function in the wild. We wanted to understand the balance of expression of activating and inhibitory Ly49 receptors on NK cells, and so compared the proportions of NK cells expressing or not Ly49D and Ly49G2 (Fig. 6e) . Wild mice had significantly higher proportions of Ly49D þ G À cells than laboratory mice whereas laboratory mice had significantly higher proportions of Ly49D À G þ cells than wild mice ( Table 2 ), suggesting that NK cells of wild mice may have a lower threshold for activation, although this will be heavily influenced by MHC class I genotype and expression of other Ly49 receptors not assayed here. Together these results show that NK cells of wild mice can be, and are, much more readily activated than those of laboratory mice, which may be a necessary response to the high pathogen load of the wild environment. Wild mice have reduced cytokine responses to PAMPs. In light of the highly activated state of the cellular immune system of wild mice we measured the functional immune response by culturing splenocytes in the presence of PAMPs (CpG, the ligand for endosomally expressed TLR9; PG, a TLR2 agonist; bacterial LPS, a ligand for TLR4) and a mitogen (monoclonal antibodies to the T-cell surface molecules CD3 and CD28). Among the 45 comparisons made between wild and laboratory mice (5 culture conditions Â 9 cytokines) only 16 significant differences between wild and laboratory mice were observed, and in 13 of these analyte concentrations were significantly lower in the wild mice (Fig. 7, Supplementary Data 1, Supplementary Table 5 ). Of particular note, wild mice produced significantly less IL-12 (p40 and p70) and less IL-13 than laboratory mice in response to ARTICLE pathogen-related ligands and there was also a trend for IL-10 production to be lower in wild mice, although this was only significant at baseline. These comparatively depressed cytokine responses are in significant contrast to the highly activated cellular immune state of wild mice. We speculate that some form of innate immune tolerance may be operating to limit the degree of inflammation in chronically and highly pathogen-exposed wild mice. The only cytokine responses that were significantly higher in wild mice than in laboratory mice were the IFN-g, IL-4 and MIP-2a responses to anti-CD3/anti-CD28, which are consistent with the higher proportions of memory and effector T cells in wild mice. These results suggest that innate cytokine responses, and their functional effects, may need to be re-evaluated in laboratory mice.
