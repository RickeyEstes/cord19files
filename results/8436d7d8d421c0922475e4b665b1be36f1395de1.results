Decreases in numbers of arrivals to the ROK were observed during June and July 2015 across all examined areas compared to the average numbers of arrivals in 2013 and 2014 (Table 1 ). In June, the number of arrivals decreased by 7.5% from the least affected area and 74.2% from the most affected area. The simple average decrease across 17 areas was 31.4%. In July, the simple average decrease in numbers of arrivals was 39.3% (range 4.8%-82.0% across areas). Although travel volumes declined across all areas during June and July, actual traveler volumes for some areas exceeded projected values starting in August and continuing through December 2015 (Appendix Figures 1 and 2) . Table 2 shows that the percentage decrease in numbers of arrivals from areas with ≥100 SARS cases during the 2003 SARS outbreak was significantly greater than the decrease from areas with < 100 SARS cases in June (52.4% vs. 23.3%), July (60.0% vs. 31.4%), and August 2015 (28.5% vs. 3.8%). In comparison, during the pre-outbreak January to May period, the simple averages from both groups showed higher numbers of arrivals than the averages for 2013 and 2014 ( Fig. 1 ). The numbers of arrivals from areas with a previous SARS outbreak with ≥100 cases were 21.7%-38.5% higher in January-May 2015 than in January-May averages for 2013 and 2014, while the simple averages from areas with < 100 SARS cases were only 1.7%-15.4% higher in January-May 2015 ( Table 2) . The percentage changes in arrivals from areas in the close category decreased more than the percentage changes in arrivals in the far category in June (56.1% vs. 19.5%), July (69.9% vs. 17.1%), and August Table 1 Percentage changes between 2015 actual and projected (average of 2013 and 2014) monthly non-citizen arrivals to the Republic of Korea (ROK) by area (%). . 2 and Table 3 ). In addition, the percentage changes in arrivals in the intermediate category decreased more than the percentage changes in arrivals in the far category in July (44.0% vs. 17.1%). Changes in all other months did not show significant differences across distance categories. The results from baseline OLS regression models also identified statistically significant correlations between the percentage decrease of numbers of arrivals and previous SARS outbreak of ≥100 cases (Table 4) . Areas with a previous SARS outbreak of ≥100 cases showed significant correlations in June (p-value = 0.032). Also, the correlation between the percentage decrease of numbers of arrivals and distance from the ROK was statistically significant. The significant percentage decreases in numbers of visitor arrivals occurred in areas in the close category in June (p-value = 0.012) and July (p-value≤ 0.001), and in the intermediate category in July (p-value≤ 0.001) . Results from sensitivity analyses were consistent with the baseline analysis. For Baseline and Alternatives 1, the percentage changes of arrivals from areas with a previous SARS outbreak of ≥100 cases showed greater decreases than the percentage changes in arrivals from their counterparts in June, July, and August 2015 (Appendix Table 4 ). For Alternative 2, the differences between areas with and without a SARS outbreak of ≥100 cases were significant in every month from June through December 2015, except for September. For both Alternatives, declines in numbers of arrivals from areas in the close category were larger than for areas in the far category from June to August 2015 (Appendix Table 5 ). For Alternative 1, the declines in arrivals in the intermediate category were significantly larger than the declines in arrivals from the far category from April through December 2015, except for August. However, if we instead used Alternative 2, the decline in numbers of arrivals from the intermediate distance category was statistically significantly greater than the far category only in April, June, and July 2015. The results from sensitivity analyses of regression models were also consistent with the results from baseline models. Using all three projected values, the percentage decrease of arrivals in June and July showed some significant correlations with proximity and previous SARS outbreaks of ≥100 cases (Appendix Table 6 ). When excluding outliers, the observation for India in August 2015, the difference in the percentage changes in arrivals between the intermediate and far categories was significant; however, when the India, August 2015 observation was included in the analysis (i.e. not excluded), the difference between the intermediate and far categories was no longer significant (Appendix Table 7 ).
