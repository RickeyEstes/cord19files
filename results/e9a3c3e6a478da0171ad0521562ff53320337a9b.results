A total of 17 patients were recruited. Their median age was 34 years (range 22-57 years), with a male to female ratio of 1:3. All were previously healthy individuals. Paired serology testing confirmed SARS-CoV infection in 16 cases (IgG titer 40-640); five had bilateral lung infiltrates, with one case requiring supplemental oxygen therapy. All recovered and discharged uneventfully without requiring ICU care. The remaining patient was transferred to ICU and mechanical ventilated because of respiratory failure and died before a convalescence serum could be obtained. His diagnosis of SARS was confirmed by two throat washings tested positive for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR. The clinical, radiological, and laboratory data in our cohort is summarized in Table 1 . A total of nine patients in the non-ICU group received "early" hydrocortisone treatment, initiated at a mean interval of 4.8 days (95% CI: 4.1-5.5) from fever onset. Normal saline was given in the remaining seven cases. High-dose methylprednisolone was given to six (86%) patients in the placebo group (mean cumulative dose = 1.8 g) and four (44%) patients in the hydrocortisone group (mean cumulative dose = 2.2 g), respectively, initiated at a mean interval of 8.6 days from illness onset. The single ICU case received both "early" hydrocortisone treatment and subsequent high-dose methylprednisolone therapy. The detectability (percentage of patients) of plasma SARS-CoV RNA in 16 non-ICU patients (hydrocortisonetreated group versus placebo group) across time is depicted in Fig. 1 . SARS-CoV RNA was detected in plasma since day 3-4 after illness onset. Overall, the mean time for SARS-CoV RNA to become undetectable in plasma was 11.9 days (95% CI: 9.7-14.1) from fever onset; cumulative proportion of patients with undetectable virus was 31%, 69%, 92%, and 100%, on days 8, 12, 16, and 20, respectively. Median time for SARS-CoV RNA to become undetectable in plasma was 12 days (range 11-20 days) versus 8 days (range 8-15 days) in the hydrocortisone and placebo groups, respectively (Mann-Whitney; P = 0.106). Profile of mean plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentrations in 16 non-ICU cases (hydrocortisone-treated group versus placebo group) is depicted in Fig. 2 . In general, peak plasma viral load was reached within the first week of illness and rapidly declined in the second week. The mean peak plasma SARS-CoV RNA concentration was 510 copies/mL (95% CI: 148-1738 copies/mL). The peak value in the single ICU case was 35,086 copies/mL. The plasma viral loads measured in the two treatment arms were compared. Plasma
