To verify that the temperature and velocity gradients computed by our CFD model are consistent with previous work by Chen et al. [17] , we compared the velocity profiles from a 4'' mesh and found good agreement. As shown in Figure 3 , the airflow occurs primarily transverse to the main axis of the cabin. This is in part due to the absence of simulated passenger traffic in the aisle. Furthermore, the CFD aircraft cabin flow fields presented here are consistent with results presented by independent investigators [17] and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) [34] . In our CFD simulations, we specified some number of infected passengers whom we considered to be contaminant producers ( Figure 4 , second-to-last row, shown in orange). The locations of the mouths of these passengers are the initial positions of simulated exhaled particles. To visualize the transverse extent of exhalant trajectories during a breathing-and-coughing scenario, we show streamlines originating at these positions that represent the flow of particles across the cabin (Figure 4 , bottom). Each of the infected passengers released the same amount of contaminant within each case simulated. To assess the feasibility of onboard bio-detection equipment for each tested scenario, the particles exhaled from each infected passenger were simulated under steady-state conditions (equilibrium, well-mixed) and the airborne particles concentrations were computed based on their diameter size using specifications from COTS aerosol collectors. For purposes of classification, we refer to particles that are between 1 and 20 microns in diameter as ''bacterial'' and particles less than 1 micron as ''viral''. We then compared the accumulated biomass to the limit of detection (LoD) of COTS biosensors. Case A was simulated with seven infected passengers, each breathing 20 times a minute across all scenarios, where scenario 1 simulates breathing and coughing, scenario 2 simulates breathing and sneezing, and scenario 3 simulates breathing only. Cough and sneeze rates were set to 20 and 4 exhalation events per hour, respectively. The steady-state masses in case A were computed to be 3.43610 29 kg, 5.12610 29 kg, and 3.07610 29 kg for scenarios 1, 2, and 3, respectively (refer to Table 1 , Case A, row a). These masses correspond to approximately 6610 6 bacterial and 6610 6 viral particles in Table 1 , Case A, row b). To obtain the biological particles per cubic meter of cabin space, we applied two factors. First, the total number of particles at steady-state (row b) was divided by the total volume of air in the four-row aircraft cabin section, which was 26.9 m 3 . Second, the bacterial particles were multiplied by a viable fraction of 4.7610 24 while viral particles were multiplied by an estimated viable fraction of 5.9610 25 to obtain biological particle counts per cubic meter, respectively (see Table 1 , Case A, row c) [35] . To estimate the number of collectable viable particles as a function of particle size (i.e., bacterial versus viral), the values in row c were multiplied by aerosol collector efficiencies which account for the fraction of particles collected with respect to the total number of particles present. Specifically, based on values from a commercially available collector (OMNI 3000, Kansas City, MO), we applied collector efficiencies of 0.91 and 0.357 for the bacterial and viral particles, respectively [36] . Finally, the total cumulative numbers of collectable viable biological particles in a 90-minute continuous sampling interval were calculated based on a typical collector flow rate (i.e., 0.3 m 3 per minute) (see Table 1 , Case A, row e). Because the viability coefficients germane to estimating bacterial and viral particle counts were based on limited estimates from a single study [35] , we included the total number of collectible particles in Table 1 , Case A, row f as an upper bound on detection. The values in Table 1 , Case A, row f were not used in this analysis because it is highly unlikely that a person would exhale 100% infectious bacteria or virus even in states of high bacterial or viral shedding. To determine the feasibility of using onboard biosensors to detect the presence of airborne particles, the numbers of collectable viable particles in 90 minutes (Table 1 , Case A, row e) from all cases were compared with the LoD in mature, commercially available biosensors [37] . Commercial biosensors that rely on nucleic acid-based polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) amplification are known to have limits of detection of less than 10 copies, and generally provide a time-to-answer in 60 minutes. However, because manual sample preparation is outside the scope of this analysis and antibody-based biosensor systems can generally provide a time-to-answer in under 20 minutes, we only considered non-PCR biosensor systems here. The typical LoD for a COTS antibody-based biosensor system ranges from 10 3 -10 4 organisms per test (manufacturers typically refer to bacterial organisms as colony-forming units and viral organisms as plaque forming units) [37] . Therefore, based on these analyses, COTS collectors and biosensors would be sufficiently sensitive to detect bacterial targets in a 90-minute sampling interval for only scenarios 1 (breathing and coughing) and 2 (breathing and sneezing). Scenario 3 (breathing only) generated fewer than 10 3 bacterial particles. Further, none of the scenarios generated sufficient viral particles for detection to be feasible. Note, however, that there are significant limitations and unknowns involved in quantifying viral particles without direct data gathered from field tests (see Discussion). To examine the sensitivity of our analysis, we decreased the number of infectious passengers from seven to one in case B for scenarios 1 though 3. All other input parameters were identical to case A. The numbers of collectable viable particles in 90 minutes (Table 1 , Case B, row e) from all cases were compared with 10 3 organisms per test. In contrast to case A, only scenario 2 (breathing and sneezing) generated sufficient numbers of bacterial particles (i.e., more than 10 3 ) for onboard detection to be feasible. The remainder of case B simulation results were well beneath the 10 3 organisms per test, suggesting that onboard detection would not be feasible. To test the robustness of our analysis, we expanded on scenario 2. Case C was simulated based on one infected person breathing up to 20 times a minute and sneezing 20 times per hour, while case D was simulated based on one super spreader breathing up to 20 times a minute and sneezing 50 times per hour (see Methods for details). In both cases C and D, we found that over 600 bacterial particles would be detected in a 90-minute sampling interval ( Table 1 , Case C and D, row e), while no more than one viral particle would be detected. Taken together, these estimates suggest that onboard detection would not be feasible for bacterial-or viralparticles in cases C and D. To confirm that equilibrium conditions are indeed reached early during a flight, we calculated the time to reach steady state. Note, however, that transient characteristics are primarily governed by airflow. The following concentration rates are provided for completeness, not to imply that the equilibrium time depends upon the rate of contaminant introduction. First, we used known data to calculate the approximate expellant volume of particles under 20 microns for one cough (,2.04610 27 ml), one sneeze (,5.27610 25 ml), and one breath (1.24610 28 ml). (See Methods for details.) We also modeled seven passengers who either cough 20 times per hour in scenario 1, sneeze 4 times per hour in scenario 2, or simply breathe 20 times per hour in scenario 3. This allowed us to calculate total per-passenger particle-generation rates (in kg per second) of 4.67610 212 , 7.04610 212 , and 4.15610 212 , respectively ( Table 2 ). Taking the ratio of the steady state concentrations for scenarios 1 through 3 (Table 1 , Case A [kg per cabin volume]: 3.43610 29 , 5.12610 29 , 3.07610 29 ) to the per-passenger particle-generation rate, we arrived at approximately 12 minutes to reach steady state for scenarios 1 through 3. Twelve minutes is well within a typical flight time and under the 90-minute sampling time interval. Due to the temporal characteristics associated with sneezing and coughing, a time history study is required to understand the movements of contaminant particles released during these expiratory events ( Figure 5 ). In the transient case presented here, each passenger sneezes once and the fluid expelled at each seat location was tracked with regard to the time to transport the contaminant to the outlet vents. The resultant history of the contaminant in the cabin is computed in terms of contaminant mass (kg) and concentration in ppm relative to the air ( Figure 5A) . The contaminant concentration shown in Figure 5A represents the contaminant mass divided by the cabin volume. As a result, these values are not the measure of local values of contamination at each seat position in the cabin, some of which would show higher contaminant concentrations. Rather, the numbers represent average concentrations across each four-row cabin section illustrated in Figure 4 . The contaminant mass flow rate at the outlet vent is shown in Figure 5B . We observe that contaminants emitted from window seat positions (Figure 4 , seats L and A) enter the outlet ventilation much faster than those emitted from other seats. It is possible that the flow from the window seats may be too transient for a ceilingmounted collector above the central seats to aggregate enough particles to achieve reliable identification from those passenger seated in L or A. To mitigate this relatively low sampling rate, the collector may require a high inflow rate. Further, this suggests that a collector's effectiveness may increase when the collector is placed at the outlet vent near the window seat position. This may not be the most appropriate sensor location for collecting non-windowseat emissions, because the contaminant concentration becomes substantially diluted by the time it reaches the outlet, as shown by the second y-axis in Figure 5B . Overall, the findings for each of these three scenarios were similar and consistent with the findings of Chen's laboratory [12, 17] . The general air flow characteristics are two big vortices caused by the ventilation system that generates a recirculation swirl on each side of the aircraft. Specifically, particle emissions from the two window seat passengers (Figure 4 , seats L and A) were the least circulated contaminants within the cabin (see Table 1 . Estimates of collectable biological particles. Figure 5A ) and entered the outlet vents quickly (see Figure 5B ). In contrast, particles emitted by the passengers seated at the center or aisle seats lingered in the cabin and were not transported as effectively to the outlet vent compared to particles that originated from the window seats (see Figure 5B ). The particles emitted from the aisle seat passengers near the windows (seats B and K) tend to linger longer because it enters the recirculation zone at a location where the air is pushing the particles away from the vents. The particles emitted from the aisle passengers in the center seats (seats D and F) enter the recirculation zone at a location where it is driven towards the vents. These results should not be applied broadly to all wide-body aircraft because the simulations were based on a representative Boeing 767 aircraft cabin.
