Several models-fixed temporal density, temporal density with free parameters lognormal( , )-were considered and the model outputs presented below. We also present the findings from of sensitivity analyses, i.e, the home-alone and the work-alone models, and a comparison of the results under different models and kernels to assess the robustness of findings.
