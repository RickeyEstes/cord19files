From August 2004 to June 2009, 22,778 episodes of febrile illness were evaluated, of which 1,974 episodes were suspected dengue or undifferentiated fever (Figure 1 ). Of the 1,974 possible dengue cases, 1,793 (91%) tested negative and 181 (9%) were laboratory-confirmed as dengue-positive, of which 161 (89%) were classified as DF, 9 (5%) as DHF, 4 (2%) as DSS, 3 (2%) as DSAS and 4 (2%) as DFCS (Table 1) . Nearly all (95%) of the severe dengue cases but only 116 (72%) of the DF cases met the WHO case definition for dengue. The proportion of laboratoryconfirmed DENV infections that met the WHO case definition significantly increased by age (chi-square test for trend 5.977, p = 0.01), while younger children experienced significantly more undifferentiated febrile illness due to DENV infection ( Figure 2 ). The median age for cases meeting the dengue case definition was 8 years (range 2-13) and that of undifferentiated febrile illness due to DENV infection was 6 years (range 2-10). The number of confirmed dengue-positive cases varied by year, as expected (Table 2 ) [28] . Both genders were equally represented, with a slightly higher percentage of females experiencing severe dengue, though this difference was not statistically significant. The majority of DF cases were DENV-2 (58%), followed by DENV-1 (21%) and DENV-3 (9%), while 60% of severe dengue cases were DENV-2, followed by DENV-3 (25%) and DENV-1 (10%). In addition, there were nearly equal proportions of primary and secondary immune responses among DF cases, whereas the majority (70%) of severe dengue cases were secondary DENV Figure 2 . Frequency of dengue-positive episodes that met the WHO classification criteria for suspected dengue by age (n = 181). Upon presentation to the health center or hospital, children with a febrile illness were classified according to whether or not they met the WHO classification criteria for suspected dengue. One patient had two dengue virus infections over the course of the study and is represented twice. n = 6 for age 2, n = 10 for age 3, n = 18 for age 4, n = 23 for age 5, n = 21 for age 6, n = 16 for age 7, n = 21 for age 8, n = 23 for age 9, n = 24 for age 10, n = 19 for age 11+.

Characteristics of study participants by dengue testing results and disease severity (n = 1,974). Table 2 ). The median day of illness at presentation was day 2 for all patients, and almost all presented on days 1-3 of illness (90%). The total follow-up time of all children in the cohort was 17,931 person-years with a median follow-up of 3.9 years per child. As shown in Figure 3 , several signs and symptoms appeared to differentiate OFIs from DF cases, and DF cases from severe dengue cases, according to day of illness. In particular, higher proportions of DF and severe dengue cases experienced petechiae, platelets #150,000 cells/mm 3 , leukopenia, and positive tourniquet test compared to patients with OFIs. Higher proportions of severe cases experienced petechiae, platelets #150,000 cells/mm 3 , myalgia/arthralgia and abdominal pain compared to DF cases and patients with OFIs. Abdominal pain differentiated severe dengue cases from DF and OFI only beginning on day 3 of illness (for severe dengue compared to DF: chi-square 0.144, p = 0.70 for days 1-2 versus chi-square 16.910, p,0.0001 for day $3). Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed using GEE models to examine signs and symptoms early in illness and over the course of illness (Table 3) . On days 1-3 of illness, dengue-positive cases had up to 2-fold increased odds of fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, and vomiting compared to patients with OFIs. They also had from 3-fold to 9fold increased odds of rash, petechiae, positive tourniquet test with cut-offs of $10 and $20 petechiae/in 2 , leukopenia, platelets #150,000 cells/mm 3 , poor capillary refill, cold extremities and hypotension compared to patients with OFIs. In contrast, they had decreased odds of abdominal pain, likely Figure 3 . Frequency of signs and symptoms by day in patients with OFI, DF and severe dengue. Over the course of an episode of febrile illness, signs and symptoms were observed by medical personnel or reported by children and/or their parent/guardian. Selected signs and symptoms are shown here.

OFI, other febrile illness; DF, dengue fever; Severe dengue = dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome, dengue with signs associated with shock, or dengue fever with compensated shock. Leukopenia is defined as WBC #5000 cells/mm 3 because this feature appears later in the entire course of dengue illness. On all days of illness, dengue-positive cases had increased odds of the same signs and symptoms as on days 1-3 of illness; however, the magnitude of the point estimates tended to be higher. This difference was most pronounced for rash and platelets #150,000 cells/mm 3 , which had ORs approximately double in magnitude. In addition, denguepositive cases had increased odds of three additional signs and symptoms: poor appetite, absence of cough, and increased hematocrit. When GEE analyses on data with the longitudinal structure preserved were compared to traditional logistic regression analyses on data collapsed on febrile episode, the point estimates for the ORs were similar, although the 95% confidence intervals for the logistic regression models tended to be slightly narrower (data not shown).
