The average AE standard deviation (range) lactation number for FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 2.4 AE 1.3 (1-8), 2.5 AE 1.5 (1-9), and 2.4 AE 1.3 (1-7), respectively (P ¼ 0.44). The average body condition score at the initial pregnancy diagnosis for the same groups was 2. The number of missing animals between initial pregnancy diagnosis and reexamination from groups FMS, ASP, and CON was 6, 4, and 10, respectively (P ¼ 0.25). Late embryonic PRL (Days 35-45) for FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 7.7%, 8.9%, and 12.4%, respectively (P ¼ 0.33; Table 1 ). Early fetal PRL (Days 46-57) for FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 6.8%, 5.0%, and 5.4%, respectively (P ¼ 0.80). The overall initial PRL (late embryonic plus early fetal period examinations; Days 35-57) for FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 7.4% (19/258), 8.8% (23/262), and 9.2% (24/260), respectively (P ¼ 0.75). Differences were detected (P ¼ 0.04) in PRL between all the groups that were evaluated at the late embryonic period (10.1%; 49/486) and for those evaluated at the early fetal period (5.8%; 17/294). The number of missing animals from reexamination to calving from groups FMS, ASP, and CON was 26, 30, and 20, respectively (P ¼ 0.43). Late PRL between the cows pregnant at reexamination from the late embryonic period evaluation (Days 35-45) and calving for FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 3.2%, 6.4%, and 3.0% respectively (P ¼ 0.32; Table 2 ). Late PRL between the cows pregnant at reexamination from the early fetal period evaluation (Days 46-57) and calving for FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 6.0%, 5.1%, and 6.6%, respectively (P ¼ 0.94). The late PRL rate from all groups between cows pregnant at reexamination and calving from all the groups that were from the embryonic period (4.1%) to the early fetal period (5.5%) was not different (P ¼ 0.41). The overall late PRL rate between reexamination (from the embryonic period plus early fetal evaluation; Days 35-57) and calving for FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 4.2% (9/213), 5.7% (12/209), and 4.2% (9/216), respectively (P ¼ 0.71). Initial PRL was higher (8.5%; 66/780) than late PRL (4.7%; 30/638; P ¼ 0.005). The calving rate one was 77.3% for the FMS group, 74.1% for the ASP group, and 76.9% for the CON group (P ¼ 0.63; Table 3 ). The calving rate two for the same groups was 85.4%, 82.4%, and 87.7%, respectively (P ¼ 0.27). The number of fetuses aborted, premature and mature dead from FMS, ASP, and CON groups was 6, 4, and 5, respectively (P ¼ 0.85); no abnormalities were detected at the necropsy of these animals. One male calf was stillborn with atresia coli confirmed at necropsy (see Fig. 1 ; P ¼ 0.49). This calf was born at Day 281 of gestation and both parents were Holstein. The dam was from the ASP group and examined at Day 51 of gestation (estrus ¼ day 0).
