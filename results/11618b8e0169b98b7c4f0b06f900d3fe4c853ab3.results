We initially screened 6 samples; 1 sample, Bat/ KE4852/07, obtained from an E. helvum bat trapped in Vihiga, Kenya, was positive for rotavirus by VP6 RT-PCR. Using primers annealing to noncoding regions of each segment and internal primers, we then obtained full-length ORF sequences for VP2, VP6, VP7, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, and NSP5, except for VP1 and VP4, for which partial-length gene sequences were obtained (for the remainder of this report, we will refer to each ORF, from ATG to stop codon, as a gene). None of the sequences reported in this study were inferred from primer sequences. Sequences were not obtained for VP3 and NSP1, despite repeated attempts to obtain amplicons by using panels of rotavirus A-specifi c primer pairs. Nucleotide sequences for VP1, VP2, VP4, VP6, VP7, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, and NSP5 were deposited in GenBank under accession nos. GU983672-GU983680. Genetic analyses of Bat/KE4852/07 indicated that 7 genes were unique and 2 were similar to described rotavirus genotypes. Results are summarized below and in Figure 1 .
