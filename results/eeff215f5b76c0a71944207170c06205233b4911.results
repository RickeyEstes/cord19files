After we excluded cows that did not conceive in the TAI/pregnant groups (i.e., 2 L and 6 NL) and cows with pyometra (i.e., 1 L) and regressed CL (i.e., NL), 7 cyclic L, 8 pregnant L, 4 cyclic NL, and 6 pregnant NL cows were utilized for microarray analyses. All the noninseminated (i.e., cyclic) animals were included in the analysis, but only those inseminated animals that had a conceptus recovered were used. One cyclic cow from the NL treatment was removed from the analysis because of luteolysis before slaughter. In total, 6 of 12 (i.e., 50%) cows inseminated in the NL group and 8 of 10 (i.e., 80%) in the L group were pregnant on d 17. The distribution of animals that entered the microarray analysis was 10 NL cows (4 cycling and 6 pregnant) and 15 L cows (7 cycling and 8 pregnant).
