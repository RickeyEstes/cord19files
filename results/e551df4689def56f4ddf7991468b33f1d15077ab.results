Sequencing of the MERS-CoV needs conversion of the 30 000 nucleotide RNA genome to DNA using reverse transcription and subsequent PCR amplifi cation. Figure 1 shows a typical set of successful reverse transcription PCR amplicons. The amplicons for each sample were pooled for Illumina sequencing as described in the methods section. Coverage of the resulting short-reads across the MERS-CoV genome was assessed by mapping a random 100 000 read subset to the Al-Hasa_1_2013 genome (fi gure 1), where the average coverage for all samples was shown to be greater than 3 × 10³. After denovo assembly, genomes were validated by ensuring that the expected open reading frames (ORFs) were intact (fi gure 1). This method was used to generate complete or partial genomes from 21 MERS cases with sample collection dates from June, 2012, to June, 2013 (table 1) origins of clade A, we focused our analysis on sequences obtained directly from patient material, namely those in clade B. Importantly, genome Bisha_1_2012 (fi gure 2, in light green) was obtained with direct sequencing of nasopharyngeal swab material from the same patient reported as the source of the EMC/2012 virus (fi gure 2, in light green). 26 A time-resolved phylogeny was generated from all epidemiologically unlinked viruses with genome coverage greater than 70% (fi gure 3). The tightly-linked Al-Hasa cluster was collapsed to a representative isolate (Al-Hasa_2_2013) along with the Al-Hasa_8_2013 isolate that was determined to be epidemiologically unrelated (fi gure 4, table 2). Geographical locations of the ancestral viruses were co-estimated along with the phylogeny, to assess the spatial evolution of the virus. These results suggest the circulating virus in Saudi Arabia is centred around Riyadh, with sporadic excursions to other centres; the most probable geographical location for all of the internal nodes, except for the Al-Hasa outbreak, is in Riyadh (fi gure 3). However, with the exception of the ancestor to the Al-Hasa outbreak, the posterior probability on these ancestral geographical locations is low, highlighting the degree of uncertainty on these inferred locations. The number of isolates for each location is small, with only Riyadh and Al-Hasa having more than one isolate. Because the two Al-Hasa isolates cluster together, the positioning of Riyadh along the internal branches could be due to it being the only location present at many distinct positions in the topology. Al-Hasa_14 Al-Hasa_1 Al-Hasa_19 Al-Hasa_18 Al The expected number of diff erences between each pair of sequences was calculated as the product of the interval between sampling, the evolutionary rate of the virus, and the maximum common length between the two virus genomes. Assuming that the number of diff erences between two sequences over a length of time is Poisson distributed, with λ equal to the expected number of mutations, the probability of getting the observed number of mutations between the two sequences by chance can be calculated from the cumulative density function of the Poisson distribution. A transmission pair was rejected if the cumulative probability value was less than 0·05. A Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple comparisons, resulting in an adjusted signifi cance level of 3·85 × 10 -³. ASR=ancestral sequence reconstruction as defi ned in However, although the posterior probability on the root node being Riyadh is low (0·48), it is still more than double that of any other location, suggesting that the low probabilities are due to the small number of genomes (the legend of fi gure 3 lists the posterior probabilities). Additional genomes will be needed to improve confi dence in these inferences. Estimation of the evolutionary rate for this expanded number sequences shows MERS-CoV evolving at 6·3 × 10 -⁴ substitutions/site per year (95% highest posterior density [HPD] 1·4 × 10 -⁴ to 1·1 × 10 -³) establishing the time to most recent common ancestor for clade B (excluding EMC/2102 and Jordan-N3) as July, 2011 (95% HPD July, 2007, to June, 2012). Single nucleotide diff erences between all MERS-CoV genomes were assessed (fi gure 5). In this analysis, all available MERS-CoV genomes were aligned and the nucleotide at each position was compared with the nucleotide at the same position in the earliest genome, Bisha_1_2102. Many nucleotide changes were in the last third of the genome; if these changes result in aminoacid changes they might alter important accessory proteins as well as the receptor-binding spike protein encoded at nucleotide positions 21 000-25 500. Selection analysis of the 11 epidemiologically unlinked MERS-CoV genomes was done to detect evidence of natural selection in the MERS-CoV genome. Using the mixed eff ects model of evolution method, codon 1020 in the spike gene was identifi ed as being under episodic selection (p=0·021) along the branch between the main Saudi Arabian lineage and the Munich/AbuDhabi/2013 cluster. The isolates in the Munich/AbuDhabi/2013 cluster have a histidine at this position, whereas those in the Saudi Arabian lineage have an arginine (fi gure 2). The presence of an arginine at this position in the Saudi Arabian lineage suggests a potential cleavage site for the endosomal protease furin 27 or for trypsin-like proteases. 28, 29 Because of the possible role of spike protein cleavage in potentiating membrane fusion and coronavirus entry, 30 and previous observations on SARS coronavirus spike evolution, 31,32 the phenotypic eff ect of this change should be established. Evidence was sought for multiple, distinct zoonotic introductions into human beings of MERS-CoV compared with a single introduction of clade B with 15 of the new virus genomes from the Al-Hasa region form a polytomy with the previously described Al-Hasa_1_2013 through Al-Hasa_4_2013 cluster 16 (marked Al-Hasa in fi gure 2). These genomes were used to assess MERS-CoV transmission patterns in detail. In view of the rate of evolution for MERS-CoV, we tested the likelihood of the transmission network for the Al-Hasa cluster. 16 Although patient A was suggested to be the index case in Al-Hasa, transmitting to patient C and then onward, neither patient A nor C were molecularly confi rmed MERS-CoV cases. The similarity of viruses from patients B, F, G, H, and I suggests that a closely related virus could be the important early virus in the outbreak. We reconstructed the hypothetical ancestral sequence (ASR) of the Al-Hasa cluster as a surrogate for this original virus. Pairwise statistical assessment of epidemiologically defi ned transmission events, in view of the observed genetic divergence of the virus genomes and the time intervals, supports eight of 13 proposed transmissions in the Al-Hasa outbreak 16 (table 2) ; however, transmissions between the Al-Hasa patients G:M, G:X, X:Y, J:Q, and Q:T are not statistically supported (table 2, fi gure 4), suggesting independent sources of infections within the Al-Hasa outbreak (fi gure 4). The geographical distribution and phylogenetic relation of MERS-CoV across time in Saudi Arabia was investigated. The close phylogenetic clustering of the MERS-CoV isolates from the Al-Hasa region is consistent with spread via human-to-human transmission. In addition to the Al-Hasa cluster, many well supported phylogenetic clades and singletons (hereafter referred to as genotypes) exist, possibly each from a separate zoonotic event (fi gure 2). These distinct genotypes, which include the Munich/AbuDhabi, England-Qatar, Riyadh_3 cluster; the Bisha-1, Riyadh_1 cluster; and the singletons Hafr-Al-Batin_1, Riyadh_2, Buraidah_1, England2-HPA, each have strong statistical support, with Bayesian posterior probabilities of 0·87 or greater-often reaching 1·0.
