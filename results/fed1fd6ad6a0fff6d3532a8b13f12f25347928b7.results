The results for the intention to wash one's hands more frequently during an influenza pandemic are shown in Table 4 . The adjusted model indicates that respondents in suburban areas were less likely than those in urban areas to wash their hands frequently (OR = .54). Regarding the respondents' risk perception, respondents who perceived high susceptibility to the disease were more likely to wash their hands (OR = 2.93). Similar to the results in Table 2 , neighborhood support (OR = 1.43) and general government trust (OR = 1.45) were associated with washing one's hands more frequently during an influenza pandemic.
