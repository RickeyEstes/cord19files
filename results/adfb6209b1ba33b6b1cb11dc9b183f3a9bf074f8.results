The response rate from 106 participants that had requested the MERS-CoV EQA panel was 93.4% (99 laboratories, see supplementary Table 1 ). The majority of the laboratories (66.6%) submitted separate results for multiple RT-PCR assays, reflecting their confirmatory diagnostic algorithm, resulting in 189 panel results. A few laboratories did indicate their use of confirmatory PCRs, but only reported one final result. Fig. 1 shows the geographical location of all participants coming from 66 countries. 50% of the participants were located in a European Union (EU) member country, 14% in Asia, 11% in Western Asia (Middle East), 8% in Africa, 7% in a non-EU European country, 4% in Latin America, 3% in North America, and 2% in Oceania according to the United Nations geographic areas. In total, 189 panel results were returned, of which 15% (n = 29) reported quantitative results (copies/l or copies/ml (qRT-PCR), 61% (n = 115)) reported semi-quantitative results (Cycle threshold (Ct)-values) from real-time RT-PCRs or time-to-positivity, in case of reverse transcriptase recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay, and 24% (n = 45) reported qualitative results (positive and negative). In total, 13 genomic targets were used, among which 11 different targets for (real-time) RT-PCR or RT-RPA (n = 1) assays, and 2 targets for sequencing (N gene and RdRP). This may indicate that a number of unpublished, in-house developed tests were used. Table 1 summarizes the number of panel results returned for each genomic target combined with the analysis type (quantitative, semi-quantitative or qualitative). As recommended by WHO, upE is the most widely used RT-PCR, followed by ORF1a and ORF1b.
