The discovery that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS have disease-protecting effects in arthritis opens up new possibilities for drug development against autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. To obtain a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanism of this regulation, gene-expression profiling experiments were performed on inguinal lymph nodes from rats with pharmacologically (phytol) and genetically (Ncf1) modified NADPH oxidase activity.
