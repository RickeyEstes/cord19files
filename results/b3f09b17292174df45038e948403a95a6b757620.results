During the period between epidemiological week 26/2016 and 26/2018, a total of 40,917 cases of SARI fulfilling the SARI case definition were uploaded on the EMFLU Network and included in the study from 15 countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, after excluding the data from one country. Of these, 17,868 (43.8%) were female and 22,920 (56.2%) were male; in 129 cases, the sex was not given. Most cases, 20,551 (50.2%), were less than 5 years with 17,551 (42.9%) cases less than 2 years ( Table 1 ). The number of suspected SARI cases that were tested for laboratory confirmation in the 15 countries of the Region was 24,211 (59.2%). Influenza virus was detected in 3995 cases giving a proportion of 16.5%, of which 2849 (11.8%) were influenza A positive and 1146 (4.8%) were influenza B positive. Male sex represented 2128 (53.3%) of SARI cases that tested positive for influenza viruses, and the age group 16-50 years represented 1365 (34.4%) (Fig. 1a) . All age groups are reported throughout the two years period of the study (Fig. 1b) . During the study period, the reported influenza cases included influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as the predominant circulating subtype with 1666 cases (58.5%), followed by influenza A(H3N2) with 671 cases (23.6%), influenza A(H5N1) with 1 case (0.04%) and 511 influenza A cases (17.9%) that were not-subtyped (Table 2) ; while 1146 cases of influenza B were reported during the same period in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. The distribution of SARI cases by epidemiological week and year is presented in (Fig. 2a and b) (Fig. 3) , mixed infections and other respiratory infections, including Middle East respiratory syndrome, are also reported to the regional platform by 6 countries of the Region. A total of 772 positive cases of respiratory infections other than influenza viruses were reported 6 countries in the Region to the EMFLU Network during the period from epidemiological week 26/2016 to epidemiological week 26/2018. Respiratory syncytial virus was the most common circulating non-influenza respira- tory infection reported in the Region with 277 cases (35.9%), with the highest peak reported in epidemiological week 7/2017. This was followed by 266 (34.5%) cases of "other" infections, which includes Middle East respiratory syndrome cases and other respiratory viruses not registered on EMFLU Network by name. "Mixed" infections (co-infections) came next with 107 cases (13.9%), the highest number of co-infections reported was in males with 61 cases (57%) and in age group less than 2 years old with 40 cases (37.4%); and then human metapneumovirus with 55 cases (7.1%), followed by adenovirus with 40 cases (5.2%), and finally human parainfluenza viruses, including three serotypes (hPIV 1, hPIV 2 and hPIV 3) with 27 cases (3.5%). Three positive SARI cases were reported to the EMFLU Network during the study period under "unspecified" viruses. SARI data reported to EMFLU Network during the study period came from 15 countries in three of the four influenza transmission zones, Northern Africa, Western Asia and South Asia; only the Eastern Africa transmission zone did not report SARI cases to the regional platform. During the study period, in the Northern Africa influenza transmission zone, influenza A virus was the predominant virus at the beginning of the influenza season 2016/17, with 174 cases influenza A(H3N2), 2 cases influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 1 case influenza A(H5N1) and 3 cases not-subtyped influenza A; while influenza B became the predominant virus at the end of the same season with 182 reported cases. In the influenza season 2017/18, influenza A was the predominant circulating virus with 164 cases influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 111 cases influenza A(H3N2) (Fig. 4a) . In the South Asia influenza transmission zone, influenza A virus was the predominant circulating influenza viruses in season 2016/17 with 123 cases not-subtyped influenza A, 23 cases influenza A(H3N2) and 3 cases influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and. During the season 2017/18, influenza A virus was also predominant with 219 cases influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 186 cases influenza A(H3N2) (Fig. 4b) . In the Western Asia influenza transmission zone, influenza A virus was the predominant circulating influenza viruses in season 2016/17 with 252 cases influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 116 cases not-subtyped influenza A and 93 cases influenza A(H3N2). During the season 2017/18, influenza A virus was also predominant with 1026 cases influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 269 cases influenza A not-subtyped and 84 influenza A(H3N2) cases (Fig. 4c) .
