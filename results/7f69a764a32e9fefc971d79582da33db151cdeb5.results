While the amphiphysin N-BAR domain stabilizes membrane tubules, Amph-FL drives membrane vesiculation Amphiphysin, an important component of the vesicle recycling machinery (Di Paolo et al., 2002) , is composed of an N-BAR domain, followed by an IDP domain of ∼383 amino acids in humans, and a C-terminal SH3 domain (Owen et al., 1998 Miele et al., 2004; Peter et al., 2004;  Fig. 1 A) . To compare the membrane remodeling abilities of Amph-FL to those of the N-BAR domain alone, we first examined the effects of each protein on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). These experiments revealed that both the N-BAR domain and Amph-FL drove potent membrane bending within 10 min of mixing vesicles and protein, forming mobile, diffraction-limited tubules that extended from the GUV surface (Fig. S1 A and Videos 1 and 2). These GUVs often collapsed or broke apart into smaller tubules and fragments later during imaging (Fig. S1 A and Videos 3, 4, and 5), suggesting that lipid tubule formation was not the endpoint of the membrane remodeling process. To directly visualize membrane morphology at the end of remodeling (after 30 min incubation at 37°C), we used negative stain transmission EM (TEM) to resolve membrane structures below the optical diffraction limit. As expected from previous findings (Peter et al., 2004; Gallop et al., 2006) , the N-BAR domain transformed vesicles that had an average initial diameter of 200 nm into long tubules with average outer diameter 44 ± 6 nm SD (Fig. 1, B and C; and Fig. S1, B and C) . In contrast, Amph-FL did not drive appreciable membrane tubule formation in TEM experiments. Rather, Amph-FL divided the vesicles of initially 200-nm diameter into a population of highly curved vesicles with a peak diameter centered near 22 nm (Fig. 1, D and E; and Fig. S1 D) . This finding suggests that formation of membrane tubules is not a stable endpoint of membrane remodeling driven by Amph-FL, as observed in GUV experiments (Fig. S1 A) . In contrast, N-BAR did not drive a substantial shift in the vesicle diameter distribution in TEM experiments (Fig. 1 E) . Collectively, these results suggest that Amph-FL is capable of driving membrane fission, a more energetically demanding process than membrane tubule formation (Campelo and Malhotra, 2012) .
