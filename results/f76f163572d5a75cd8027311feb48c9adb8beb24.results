We have previously shown that the mutations 3D-G64R and 3D-S264L confer ribavirin resistance upon HEV71 by increasing the replication fidelity of 3D pol (Sadeghipour et al., 2013) . Furthermore, it has been shown that amino acid substitutions at position G64 in the poliovirus 3D pol not only induce resistance to ribavirin and increase replication fidelity but also lead to reduced virulence in poliovirus receptor-expressing transgenic mice Kirkegaard, 2003, 2005; Vignuzzi et al., 2006 Vignuzzi et al., , 2008 . Thus, we were interested to determine if the HEV71 3D pol mutations are also able to attenuate viral virulence in a mouse model of HEV71 infection (Chua et al., 2008) .
