The Beaudette strain of IBV was propagated in embryonated eggs 3 times and then adapted to Vero cells. The complete genome nucleotide sequence of a plaque-purified isolate, wt6501, from the passage 65 was determined and compared with those of other IBV strains, including the Beaudette strain (Boursnell et al., 1987) (GenBank: M95169). The results showed that a single base was inserted in a 6A stretch (Fig. 1a) between nucleotides 24075 and 24080, among mutations and deletions at other positions in the genome (Shen and Liu, unpublished observations) . This insertion is located at the 5Ðˆ-terminal region of the 3b gene, causing a frameshift and therefore resulting in a C-terminally truncated product if synthesized. The truncated product would contain 17 identical residues at the N-terminal half and 17 different residues at the C-terminal half, instead of 64 residues for the normal 3b protein (Fig. 1b) .
