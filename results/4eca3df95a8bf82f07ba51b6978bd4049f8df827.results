The UpE and ORF-1a rRT-PCR results for specimen A were equivocal [PCR threshold cycle (Ct) value 38.8] and negative, respectively, and the specimen was determined to be inconclusive for MERS-CoV RNA detection. In contrast, specimen B was found to be positive by both UpE and ORF-1a assays with Ct values 30.2 and 32.5, respectively. The presence of MERS-CoV RNA was also confirmed on specimen B by RT-PCR and partial sequencing of the RdRp and N genes. Full genome sequencing was not possible due to the limited available sample volume. However, sequences of the S and N protein coding regions were successfully obtained. The Greece-Saudi Arabia_2014 S differed by 0.1-0.9% nucleotides (nt) and 0.1-1.3% amino acids (aa) from 68 other published human and camel derived MERS-CoV sequences. One unique nt change present as a mixed base at position 1533 (G>C) of the S ORF confers a predicted aa change of arginine (R) with proline (P) at position 511 (R511P). The Greece-Saudi Ara-bia_2014 N differed by 0.1-0.9% nt and 0-0.8% aa from 69 other published MERS-CoV sequences. No unique nt changes were identified. Phylogenetic analyses of the MERS-CoV S and N ORFs are shown in Fig 1. The Greece-Saudi Arabia_2014 sequences clustered most closely with human derived MERS-CoV strains obtained in Jeddah and Makkah, Saudi Arabia, in April 2014. MERS-CoV sequences recently obtained from dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia and Qatar also clustered with the Greece-Saudi Arabia_2014 sequences. Serology identified specific anti-MER-CoV IgM (titer 1/100) and IgG (titer 1/320) antibodies in the patient's serum sample.
