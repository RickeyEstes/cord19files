Chemical composition of the essential oil. The yield of the essential oil obtained from the dry aerial parts of A. vestita was ~0.8% w/v. The chemical components of the essential oil, identified using GC-MS, are presented in Table I and the GC-MS total ion chromatogram is shown in Fig. 1 . A total of 16 compounds were identified in the A. vestita essential oil, accounting for 96.6% of the total oil composition. The major components of the essential oil were identified as grandisol (45.12%), 1,8-cineole (22.5%), camphor (5.2%), β-caryophyllene (2.5%) and germacrene D (5.1%). A literature review revealed that the various Artemisia essential oils contain α-pinene, camphor, borneol, bornyl acetate, artemisia ketone, artemisia alcohol, 1,8-cineole, limonene, 1,8-cineole and grandisol as the major constituents (33-36). Antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity of A. vestita essential oil and its major constituents, 1,8-cineole and grandisol, were evaluated against a set of clinically significant, respiratory infection-causing bacterial strains. These included S. pyogenes, MRSA, S. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. The potencies of the essential oil and the chemical constituents were assessed by measuring the inhibition zones and MIC. The results are presented in Table II (MIC and MBC values). The results indicated that the essential oil of A. vestita and its major constituents exhibited a broad spectrum and variable degree of antibacterial activity against the various strains. The essential oil exhibited potent growth inhibition against S. pyogenes (MIC, 20 µg/ml), followed by H. influenzae (MIC, 26 µg/ml), S. pneumoniae (MIC, 32 µg/ml), MRSA bacterial strain (MIC, 65 µg/ml) and K. pneumoniae (MIC, 80 µg/ml). In order to identify which of the chemical compounds of the A. vestita essential oil were active against these respiratory bacteria, further in vitro experiments were performed to evaluate the antibacterial effects of the two major constituents (1,8-cineole and grandisol). These two components exhibited lower growth inhibitory effects, compared with the essential oil, on the bacterial strains, with higher MIC/MBC values. S. pyogenes was the most susceptible bacteria to the two oil constituents, and the essential oil itself, with 1,8-cineole resulting in an MIC of 132 µg/ml and grandisol with an MIC of 130 µg/ml. Grandisol was more effective against all the bacterial strains, with the exception of K. pneumoniae, while 1,8-cineole exhibited higher inhibition. The MRSA bacterial strain was the least susceptible strain to the two compounds, with MIC values of 200 (1,8-cineole) and 178 µg/ml (grandisol). The essential oil was substantially more potent, compared with the individual chemical constituents, indicating possible synergy between different chemical constituents of the essential oil. Survival curve measurement. The survival curves for the essential oil of A. vestita on the different bacterial strains is shown in Fig. 2 S. pyogenes (Fig. 3) . The results indicated that the leakage of K + ions started immediately following the addition of A. vestita essential oil to the bacterial cultures of S. pyogenes. As Fig. 3 shows, following a time interval of 50 min, the extent of K + ion leakage reached 100% of the total cellular free K + free ions.
