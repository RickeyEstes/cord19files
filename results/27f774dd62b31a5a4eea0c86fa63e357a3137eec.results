Evaluation of the kinetics and dose-response of BALB/c mice to the immunization with the human 17DD YF vaccine In order to define a suitable immunization protocol for immunome studies using the human 17DD YF virus, groups of BALB/c mice were immunized three times, at 2-week intervals, with either a high (10 5 pfu) or low dose (10 4 pfu) of the 17DD YF vaccine and were assayed ex vivo by IFN-γ ELISPOT assay using 16mer peptides from the YF envelope protein, (Supplemental Table 1) . A detectable T cell response was observed in both mice groups with the high and low doses 14 days after the first immunization (Supplemental Fig. 1A and B). The second immunization led to a more focused T cell response to fewer 16mer peptides (Supplemental Figs. 1C and D) and the third immunization did not change the pattern observed after the second immunization (Supplemental Fig. 1E and F). The evaluation of the humoral response after each immunization (data not shown) indicated that after two immunizations with either the high or low dose of the vaccine, both groups reached similar levels of IgG anti-YF (ELISA with virus lysate), and that the third immunization did not enhance the antibody levels. The results of these experiments (Supplemental Fig. 1 ) indicated that an immunization protocol with two low dosed of the 17DD YF vaccine given three weeks apart would be enough to induce an optimal T cell response, and hence, such protocol was applied in the subsequent experiments, except when indicated. Analysis of CD4 + and CD8 + responses to the YF envelope protein peptides Seven days after the second immunization, the splenocytes of the mice receiving two low doses (10 4 pfu) of the human 17DD YF vaccine 3 weeks apart were assayed by ELISPOT with 15mer peptides (15 × 11) of the 17DD YF envelope protein (Supplemental Table 2 ). A high number of IFN-γ SFC was observed against several peptides of the envelope protein ( Fig. 1A ) and the main positive responses were directed to the same regions in the YF envelope protein previously observed with the 16mer peptides (16 × 10) (Supplemental Fig. 1) . We further characterized the cellular response using splenocytes depleted of CD4 + or CD8 + lymphocytes. The depletion approach consistently yielded N95% of depletion, as judged by flow cytometry (data not shown). CD4-depleted cells, which were used to address the CD8 + response, showed significant numbers of IFN-γ SFC in response to three of the peptides (Fig. 1B) , while the CD8-depleted cells, which correspond to the CD4 + response, showed significant numbers of IFN-γ SFC in response to 17 peptides (Fig. 1C) . These results were compatible with the findings obtained with total splenocytes (Fig. 1A) and characterized the immunogenic peptides either as MHC class I or class II antigens. As an additional control, experiments were performed with purified CD4 + or CD8 + T cells incubated with splenocytes from naive mice as APC, and the ELISPOT results were comparable to those obtained with depleted populations (data not shown). Two of the peptides (E 57-71 and E 61-75 ) promoted IFN-γ secretion from both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, suggesting that these 15mers contain epitope motifs for class I and class II molecules, whereas the remaining immunogenic peptides induced either CD4 + or CD8 + responses. The T cell repertoire of the immunized mice was also investigated at 4.5 and 9 months after the initial immunization protocols, with or without a recall boost right before the experiments (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). In these long-term memory experiments, we observed the same set of immunogenic peptides that was found seven days after the second 17DD YF immunization. The peptides corresponding to the CD8 + response appeared to be the most dominant immune responses present at all times tested.
