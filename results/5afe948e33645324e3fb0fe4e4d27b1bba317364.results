Twenty-six PICU patients met the inclusion criteria. One patient was admitted with a positive RSV test result from an outside hospital, and no further testing was performed at our institution. Another patient diagnosed with a bacterial pneumonia was subjected to no virus tests, and insufficient material was obtained from a third patient to perform all respiratory tests. Consequently, 23 patients were included in the subsequent analysis. The median age of the patients was 2.6 months, and the majority were referred from an outside hospital (Table 1 ). The PICU patients formed a heterogeneous group, with many patients having underlying conditions resulting from preterm birth or birth defects. Patients stayed in the PICU for a median of 10 days; 20 (87%) patients needed mechanical ventilation. Two patients in the study group died. One child suffered from bronchiolitis with progressive bronchospasms, which in the end could not be controlled. The second child had complex underlying conditions; after eliminating all treatable causes (including LRTI) the patient died from central hypoventilation. Viral culture identified a respiratory virus in six PICU patients; RSV and adenovirus were detected in four and two patients, respectively ( Table 2 ). The DIF assay appeared to be more sensitive to detect respiratory viruses than viral culture in our population, identifying a virus in 11 (48%) patients, including the six patients diagnosed by viral culture. Real-time PCR detected a total of 33 respiratory viruses in 22 (96%) patients. All positive results found by conventional techniques were confirmed by real-time PCR. RSV was the single most common respiratory virus found and was detected in 16 (70%) patients. In addition, rhinovirus was found in six (26%) patients, and influenzavirus, adenovirus and coronavirus were each detected in three (13%) children. PIV-3 and hMPV were both found in one patient (4%). PIV-2 and PIV-4 and the atypical pathogens Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae could not be detected in any of the LRTI patients. In eight (35%) children more than one virus was detected. Six children had a dual infection, one had a triple, and one had a quadruple respiratory virus infection. RSV was detected in seven of the eight children infected with multiple viruses, including all three patients infected with a coronavirus. Of the 14 children with a single infection, nine had RSV. The other five patients had an infection with rhinovirus (n = 2), influenzavirus (n = 1), adenovirus (n = 1), or hMPV (n = 1).
