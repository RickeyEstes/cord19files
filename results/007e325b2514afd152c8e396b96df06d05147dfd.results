All nurses were of Chinese descent. The 1860s (N95) mask was tested in 82 female nurses and two male nurses, the 9210 (N95) mask in 81 females and 12 males, and the 8233 (N100) mask in 79 females and 12 males. The user seal check was correct on 71-75% of occasions. Detailed results are shown in Table I . Fit factors for masks that had been incorrectly passed were 19-87 for the 1860s (N95) mask, 7.8-92 for the 9210 (N95) mask, and 12-91 for the 8233 (N100) mask. The user seal check was no more accurate in men compared with women; 50% vs 76% for the 1860s (N95) mask, 66% vs 74% for the 9210 (N95) mask, and 75% vs 70% for the 8233 (N100) mask (no significant differences). The 50% failure rate with the 1860s mask in men appears high; however, only two men were tested on this mask. The smaller proportion of staff fitting the 9210 (N95) mask, compared with the other two masks, approached significance (PZ0.052).
