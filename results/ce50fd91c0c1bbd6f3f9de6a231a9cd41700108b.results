To test whether NaCl has an inhibitory effect on viruses, we first conducted inhibition experiments with herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). A HSV-1 reporter virus expressing enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) was tested in HeLa cells (cervical epithelial cells) in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl, and fluorescence intensity was measured at regular intervals over 48 hours. A dose-dependent reduction of HSV-1 Figure 1 . Dose dependent inhibition of HSV-1 by sodium chloride: (a) Time course analysis of HSV-1 in the presence of NaCl: HeLa cells were infected with HSV-1-GFP (MOI 0.5) for 1 hour before the inoculum was removed and replaced with increasing concentrations of NaCl in medium (in triplicate). NaCl (mM) values are over and above that found in DMEM (110 mM). Virus replication was monitored as a function of GFP fluorescence over time. (b) Viability of HeLa cells is not significantly impaired in the presence of NaCl. HeLa cells were treated with increasing concentrations of NaCl (in triplicate). 24 and 48 hours post-treatment cellular viability was determined with CellTiter-Blue (Promega) by the ability of cells to metabolise the substrate to produce a fluorescent end-product. Cell viability was normalised to untreated cells (0 mM NaCl). Viability below 70% is evidence of cytotoxicity. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean of 3 independent experiments carried out in triplicate.
