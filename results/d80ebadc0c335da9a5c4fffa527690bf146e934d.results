Analytical sensitivity of the RT-SIBA RSV assay in comparison with RT-PCR The analytical sensitivity of the RT-SIBA RSV assay was compared with that of the previously published RT-PCR RSV assay [15] . The sensitivities of the RT-SIBA and RT-PCR assays for RSV were evaluated in three independent experiments by adding serial dilutions of RNA extracted from RSV, with 10-10 5 copies per reaction. Five replicates of each dilution were used. RT-SIBA reactions were detected using both target-specific probes and SYBR Green. The RSV assay included the MS2 internal control to assess sample-derived inhibition. The RSV probe was labeled with ROX and Iowa Black FQ quencher, whereas the MS2 probe was labeled with Cy5 and Iowa Black RQ quencher. RT-PCR incorporated a target-specific probe, which enabled specific detection of RSV-A and RSV-B subtypes. The results are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2 . Both RT-SIBA and RT-PCR reliably detected as few as 10 copies of RSV RNA (5/5 replicates in every control dilution). The average amount of time taken to achieve positive reactions in RT-SIBA was compared with the corresponding cycle threshold (ct) values for RT-PCR (Table 2) . RT-SIBA reactions were performed at a constant temperature and consequently did not require thermal cycling. Hence, RT-SIBA data were collected at 1 min intervals. RT-SIBA RSV assays detected 100 copies of RSV-A and RSV-B at approximately 14 and 16 min, respectively. The corresponding ct values for 100 copies of RSV-A and RSV-B RNA were approximately 27 and 30, respectively. The corresponding average amount of time taken to achieve positive reactions with RT-PCR can be around 2 h due to the initial reverse transcription step as well as the instrument ramp time. RSV was detected faster by RT-SIBA than by RT-PCR. Analytical specificity of the RT-SIBA RSV assay Subsequent melting curve analysis revealed the presence of a single specific amplicon in reactions
