However, reanalysis using sPROFILER appeared to be more effective, as it produced fewer and shorter N-call stretches compared to ResqMi (not shown). Moreover, it was also noticed that, in contrast to GSEQ and sPROFILER, the total number of sequence variants (i.e. the homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mutations) compared to the rCRS greatly increased using the ResqMi software (See: Additional file 1, Table S3 ). This suggested using the ResqMi may result in base miscalling, particularly increasing heteroplasmic calls. To confirm the accuracy of the new base calls would have required complete conventional sequencing of all samples. For sample mtDNA7, comparison of the ResqMi re-analysis of the MitoChip sequence with complete conventional sequencing showed that all heteroplasmy calls produced by ResqMi in fact matched the rCRS as called by conventional sequencing. We did not use this software for further analyses in this study. Comparison of conventional sequencing with the MitoChip rCRS is discussed below. Table 2 shows that N-call stretch lengths â‰¥ 4 decreased after re-analysing GSEQ with sPROFILER. Based on the report that indels may impact on microarray probe annealing, [12] the longest N-call stretch from each sample was sequenced conventionally, with two exceptions (it was not possible to sequence all N-call stretches due to financial constraints). For sample mtDNA8, the 3 longest N-call stretches (10, 18 and 20 bases) were sequenced. For sample mtDNA7, complete sequencing was performed because this was derived from a fibroblast cell line homozygous for the 94C > A sequence variant of the nucleotidase gene ITPA (see Methods). In 6 of the N-call stretches sequenced conventionally, we found 7 insertions (i.e. one N-call stretch had 2 insertions). Insertion type m.309insC accounted for 6 of the 7 insertions found within the N-call stretches, while mtDNA9 also had insertion type m.315insC located one base outside its N-call stretch. Conventional sequencing revealed 12 point mutations within the N-call stretches. No deletions were found by conventional sequencing of the N-call stretches. Of 3 N-call stretches that showed no sequences differences compared with the rCRS sequence reference on the MitoChip, 2 were found to be CG-rich. For the sample mtDNA7, which was completely sequenced (Table 3) , one deletion (m.3107delC) was called by MitoChip and confirmed by conventional sequencing: this deletion was acknowledged by Affymetrix as being omitted from the resequencing array at the time of GeneChip design due to an error in the original human mtDNA sequencing [15] -this error has been retained in the rCRS [16] . One deletion found by conventional sequencing, m.15944delT, was called as a 'heteroplasmic substitution' by MitoChip, and 2 other deletions (m.523_524delAC, m.16193delC) were assigned as normal bases by MitoChip. On the other hand, MitoChip did not call any insertions in any samples, but conventional sequencing of mtDNA7 revealed 2 insertions (m.315insC, m.16193insC) ( Table 3) . Moreover, for the 145 N-call bases remaining after sPROFILER analysis for mtDNA7 (Additional file 1, Table  S1 ), which ranged from a single N-call base to four N-call bases length, conventional sequencing revealed that 4 of these N-call bases to be point mutations ( Table 3 ). One of these point mutations was found among the N-call stretches of 4 bases and the other 3 point mutations were found among single N-calls. The remaining 141 N-calls matched the rCRS. These results correlated with our statistical calculation using "Control Chart" (Additional file 1, Figure S1 ), which found that N-call stretches < 4 were high variable data: for this reason the shorter N-call stretches in the other samples were excluded from conventional sequencing but these may have contained point mutations or indels. For mtDNA7, a total of 35 homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mutations were identified using MitoChip, with 30 of these mutations being confirmed by conventional sequencing: 2 new homoplasmic mutations were not detected by
