We set January 23, 2020 as the beginning date of the simulation; the initial values of variables were set as of this date (table 6 ). If we set the simulation period D as 300 days, input the best parameters we found, with the MATLAB program of QSEIR model, we can present the results shown in figure 5 . The results showed that with 80% probability, the peak value of I was 58,264 on February 13, 2020. After June 19, 2020, the value of I would be < 50 and from July 29, 2020, the number would be smaller than 5. By August 26, 2020, I would be smaller than 1, implying that the COVID-19 would essentially end. From March 17, 2020, E would be < 5 and, a week later on March 24, the number of E would be < 1, which means the epidemic would be totally controlled since this day, no new infected people would appear. The cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in mainland China was estimated to be 97,653, and the cumulative number of deaths was All rights reserved.

Considering there have 20% estimation error of errc, the peak value of I would be in the range of [52,438, 64,090] and the peak date would be expected in the range February 7 to February 19, 2020. The end date would be in range from August 20, 2020 to September 1, 2020. During the period between March18-30, 2020 the epidemic would be totally controlled. Furthermore, the existing studies seldom provided estimates of the duration of the epidemic and effects of different containment strategies in mainland China. At the regional level, Wu et al. (2020b) concluded that in Guangdong province, the epidemic would be totally controlled by mid to late March, 2020. The cumulative confirmed cases in Guangdong was ranked second among All rights reserved.
