Genotyping of human rhinoviruses in ARTI patients. To identify the roles of HRV genotypes in adult ARTIs, we recruited 438 patients from January to December 2013, including 147 community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) inpatients (including 39 severe cases) and 291 Upper ARTI (URTI) outpatients. The CAP inpatients ranged from 18 to 92 years old, with a median age of 55.5 [Interquartile range (IQR) years. The URTI outpatients ranged from 18 to 84 years old, with a median age of 30 (IQR 24-41) years. A total of 169 (38.6%) patients tested positive for at least one respiratory pathogen via multiplex real-time PCR. Forty-two (9.6%) patients were positive for HRV, including 15 CAP and 27 URTI patients (Table 1) . Co-detection was found in ten HRV-positive cases, three of which were CAP patients (co-detection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or HCoV-229E, respectively). The other seven cases were URTI patients, four of whom were also infected with influenza viruses (IFVs), two with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and one with EV. HRV RNA was not detected in the sera of HRV-positive patients, as determined by RT-PCR. The HRV species for these patients were as follows: 35 HRV-A, 5 HRV-B, and 2 HRV-C. Among them, 29 HRV-A and 5 HRV-B were successfully genotyped. In the CAP patients, there were four cases of HRV-A21 and two of A68. The rest of the genotypes were one case each of A2, A9, A13, A33, A53, B35, B48, B84, and C un-typed. Three of the four HRV-A21-positive CAP inpatients had serially collected respiratory samples, and all were positive for HRV-A21. In the URTI patients, there were five HRV-A21, three A61, two A98, and one case of each of the following genotypes: A2, A28, A53, A58, A60, A68, A96, B27, B84, and C un-typed. Seven samples of HRV-A in the URTI patients could not be genotyped precisely ( Table 1 ). The detection rate of HRV-A21 was higher in the severe CAP patients (7.9%, n = 3) than in the non-severe CAP (0.9%, n = 1) or the URTI patients (1.7%, n = 5) (P = 0.047 by Fisher's exact test). Taken together, these data show that prevalence of HRV-A21 correlates with a spectrum of illness from mild URTIs to severe CAP. Unexpectedly, HRV-A21 was most frequency (9 of 42, 21.4%) detected as the only pathogen present in an infection among the identified HRV genotypes. As only three genome sequences of HRV-A21 were available in GenBank and little was reported on its clinical manifestation, we focused on the characterization of A21 infections.
