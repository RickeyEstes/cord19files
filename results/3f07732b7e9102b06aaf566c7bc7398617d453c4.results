Rat coronavirus strains RCoV-P and SDAV infect primary cultures of rat alveolar type I cells Type I cells infected with RCoV-P showed mild cytopathic effects including cell rounding and vacuolation at 24 h after inoculation ( Fig. 1 ). Type I cells infected with SDAV had more pronounced cytopathic effects including syncytia formation and cell detachment. No cytopathic effects were observed in mockinoculated type I cell cultures. At 24 h after virus inoculation, viral nucleocapsid protein was detected in type I cells inoculated with RCoV-P or SDAV, but not in mock-inoculated cells. Culture media from type I cells inoculated with RCoV-P or SDAV were collected at various times after inoculation and titrated by plaque assay. RCoV-P and SDAV replicated with similar kinetics in alveolar type I cells (Fig. 2) . Infectious virus was first detected in the supernatant medium by 12 h after inoculation, and reached a maximum titer of 10 5 -10 6 PFU/ml at 24 h.
