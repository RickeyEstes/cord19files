Relationship between inoculum size and age-related susceptibility to JHMV In several of our previous articles, we reported that WL rats fail to develop disease when inoculated i .c . with 5X10 4 pfu of JHMV by the 10th day after birth .2,3.1' This finding was confirmed in the present study . Table 1 Influence of age, size of the inoculum and immunosuppression by cyclosporin A on neurological disease in Wistar Lewis rats Groups 1 and 2 were inoculated with 10 5 pfu JHMV; group 3 with 2 x 10 5 pfu ; group 4 with 8x 105 pfu . In groups 1 a, 2a, 3a and 4a rats were not treated with CsA . Group 1 b received daily CsA injections commencing on the 9th day until the 13th day, when treatment was suspended, then resumed on the 24th day postpartum . Group 2b received daily CsA injections commencing on the 15th day until they were suppressed on the 25th day and resumed on the 36th day postpartum . Group 2c were injected daily with CsA commencing on the 26th day, which was 10 days post JHMV inoculation . Group 3b received daily CsA injections commencing on 14th day of age . Group 4b received daily CsA injections commencing on 33rd day until they were suspended on the 37th day and resumed on the 48th day postpartum . Group 4c received CsA daily, commencing on the 49th day which was 14 days post JHMV inoculation . Group 4d were injected daily with CsA, starting on the 33rd day until 37th day postpartum . In this group CsA treatment was not resumed . To examine whether resistance prior to and after weaning can be overcome by increasing the virus dose, we challenged one group of 16 day old animals (group 2a in Table 1 ) with 105 pfu, another at 15 days of age (group 3a) with 2x10' pfu and a third 35 day old group (4a) with 8x 105 pfu . It is evident from the data in Table 1 that only one of the eight rats in group 2a developed neurological symptoms whereas five of the seven rats in group 3a, receiving five times more virus at about the same age as 2a, became diseased . Among 4a animals challenged with 8x105 pfu JHMV when 35 days old, only one out of 11 developed a late onset, progressive, paralytic disease of the type described by us previously . 2 It is apparent from these data that at 15 days of age inoculation i .c . of about five to 10 times more virus than the standard dose of 5x10' pfu may be sufficient to overcome resistance . However, by 35 days, 80 times greater JHMV inocula very occasionally surmounted resistance of WL rats . Effect of cyclosporin A on age-related resistance to neurological disease caused by JHMV Our investigation of athymic (rnu/rnu) rats showed that i .c . inoculation of JHMV, even when delayed until the 63rd-70th day of life, frequently resulted in neurological disease including paralysis .' Data from the present study revealed that CsA treatment abrogated the normal age-related resistance to JHMV of rats challenged on the tenth, 16th and 35th day of age (Table 1) . However, to be effective the drug had to be administered 2 days ahead of the virus inoculation and continually thereafter, as with rats in group 2b of Table 1 . When initiation of CsA treatment was delayed until 10th day after injection of virus, as in group 2c, or until the 14th day, as in group 4c, or when treatment around the time of inoculation was terminated and not resumed, as in group 4d, no disease developed presumably because resistance was maintained . Evidently, CsA promoted the maintenance and replication of JHMV in the CNS . Table 2 Relationship between immunosuppression with CsA and time elapsing before virus activation in the CNS of Wistar Lewis rats 'All rats were inoculated i .c . at 35 days of age with 8x 10 5 pfu . 'On the 33rd day postpartum daily injections of CsA were commenced, terminated on the 37th day and resumed on the 48th day, then continued until the time of sacrifice . This single untreated animal developed chronic paralytic disease symptoms, as in Sorensen et al.'
