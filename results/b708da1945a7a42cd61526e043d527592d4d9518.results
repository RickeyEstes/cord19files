The structure of the BLV TM ectodomain To obtain crystals for structural studies, the N-and C-terminal limits of the coiled coil region of BLV TM were identified using LearnCoil VMF [25] . The TM ectodomain, including the predicted coiled coil and LHR from Ala326 to Trp418, were fused to the C-terminal end of maltose binding protein via a threealanine spacer following the methodology of Center et al [26] . The soluble purified protein was crystallised and the structure solved to a resolution of 2.0 Ã… (Fig. 1 ). As anticipated, the overall fold of the BLV TM ectodomain is that of a trimer-of-hairpins, with the Nterminal a-helices twisting around each other to produce the central triple-stranded coiled coil that is characteristic of class I fusion proteins. Buried leucine and isoleucine residues within the coiled coil predominantly mediate the interactions between monomers, but strikingly there are two polar layers within the coiled coil that establish interactions with ordered water molecules and a chloride ion respectively (see below). At the base of the coiled coil the peptide backbone undergoes a 180u loop forming the chain reversal region (Fig. 1A, B) , within which is a short helical segment containing the first cysteine of the conserved CX 6 CC motif [9, 10] . The predicted disulphide between Cys384 and Cys391 is reduced in the resolved structure but this does not appear to affect the overall protein fold. In support of this view, preliminary lower resolution structures obtained for crystals formed in the absence of TCEP-HCL reveal an intact disulphide (data not shown). These data indicate that the disulphide is not essential for constraining the chain reversal region in the folded protein, even though it might play a role in the folding process. Therefore, the known defects in membrane fusion associated with substitution of these cysteines are likely due to direct perturbation of the inter-subunit disulphide isomerisation step of the envelopemediated membrane fusion process [9, 10] . After Cys391, the LHR begins with an extended non-helical leash followed by an eightresidue a-helix. This helix is followed by a three-residue linker incorporating a single proline, allowing a sharp kink in the LHR prior to the start of a second a-helix that adopts an orientation almost 90u to the first helical segment of the LHR (Fig. 1A , B, C). A panel of mutants in BLV envelope are processed and expressed identically in vivo Guided by the crystal structure, a panel of mutants in BLV envelope were designed to perturb key features of the trimer-ofhairpins structure. A common difficulty with mutagenesis of viral envelopes, particularly the TM, is that at particular positions even conservative substitutions can dramatically impair the proteolytic processing and cell surface expression of envelope [27, 28] . Therefore, we compared each of the mutants with the parental ''wild-type'' envelope and confirmed appropriate expression, processing and cell surface presentation of the TM mutants. No significant differences in either the expression level of gp51 or the cleavage of the precursor protein, gp72, were observed ( Fig. 2A) . Moreover, flow cytometry analysis confirmed that in each case the mutant envelope was displayed on the cell surface at levels equivalent to wild type (Fig. 2B) . Subsequently, the envelopeexpressing cells were used as effector cells in syncytium formation assays, and the efficiency of each mutant envelope relative to wildtype in catalysing membrane fusion was calculated as the relative fusogenic index. The effect of each mutation on fusogenicity (Fig. 2C) , and the mutant phenotypes are interpreted with reference to the crystal structure below. Solvent molecules are critical for stable assembly of the core coiled-coil The trimerisation of the N-helices appears to be facilitated by presentation of aliphatic residues to the interacting faces of the TM monomers, thereby forming a hydrophobic core down the axis of the central coiled coil. Notably, in the BLV trimer-of-hairpins there are two positions along this interface that harbour polar residues, Thr353 and Asn367 (Fig. 3A, B ). Thr353 is located approximately half way up the N-helix, and it is oriented such that the methyl group of the side chain points toward the centre of the coiled coil and the hydroxyl group faces toward the neighbouring N-helix. In this position, Thr353 participates in a complex network of hydrogen bonding via several buried ordered water molecules. In particular, Thr353 makes a contact through one water molecule with the main-chain of Glu397 and through a separate water molecule to the side-chain of His354, one of the residues which forms the wall of the groove into which the LHR
