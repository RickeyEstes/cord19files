During the analysis period, state health departments, U.S. federal agencies and foreign ministries of health made 682 requests for federal public health travel restrictions. A total of 46 state health departments, as well as the health departments for the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, made 621 (91%) of all requests for federal public health travel restrictions; the California and Texas state health departments made the most requests: 168 and 73, respectively. U.S. federal agencies only accounted for three (0.5%) placement requests, with one initiated by CDC and two by the U.S. Department of State. Nine foreign ministries of health made 58 (8.5%) requests; the majority of these requests (50) came from the public health authority in Canada. Requests for travel restriction consultations increased significantly each year since the inception of the DNB and PHLO (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1) , averaging 75 consultation requests per calendar year. Requests increased from 41 in 2008 to 120 in 2015. After examining data accompanying requests and considering established criteria, 414 (61%) additions were initiated, representing 396 individuals; 17 (4%) individuals were added to the DNB and PHLO more than once. There were 328 removal actions, representing 310 (78%) individuals who had been removed from the DNB and PHLO by the end of the analysis period; 86 (21%) individuals, including five who had been placed multiple times, remained on the DNB list and with a PHLO at the end of the analysis period (Table 1) . Of the 414 DNB/PHLO addition actions, 186 (45%) were for individuals who were within the U.S. at the time of placement; 195 (47%) were outside the U.S., and 33 (8%) had unknown whereabouts. Of the 396 individuals placed on the DNB and PHLO, the average age was 45.5 (range 9e89 years) and 67% were male. Of those, 209 (53%) were U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents (LPR), 146 (37%) were non-U.S. citizens or did not have a LPR status and 41 (10%) had an unknown U.S. citizenship status. The most frequently reported countries of citizenship for the entire cohort were the U.S. (112, 28%), Mexico (49, 12%), India (29, 7%), China (11, 6%), Canada (19, 5%), Vietnam (17, 4%) and the Philippines (13, 3%); 44 (11%) individuals had an unknown country of citizenship ( Table 1) . The majority (412, 99.5%) of the DNB/PHLO addition actions were for individuals with suspected or confirmed infectious pulmonary TB; two were for confirmed measles. The 412 additions for TB represented 394 individuals; 367 individuals (93%) had TB confirmed by culture or molecular diagnostic testing; three (0.8%) were diagnosed clinically and treated for infectious TB without laboratory confirmation; 12 (3%) had a final diagnosis of noninfectious or latent TB infection. Twelve (3%) individuals were placed on DNB/PHLO with a presumptive diagnosis of infectious TB but subsequently determined not to have TB; the final diagnoses for these individuals included nontuberculous mycobacterial infections, lung cancer, and other respiratory infections. Of those with a confirmed diagnosis of infectious TB (367), 58 (16%) had MDR TB and six (2%) had XDR TB. Of the 17 individuals added more than once, 16 had confirmed TB (six with MDR TB) and one had a clinical diagnosis of TB; 16 were added twice and one three times following a known lapse in treatment or after having been lost to follow-up with unknown treatment status and presumed infectiousness. Of 384 restrictions placed for individuals with confirmed infectious TB, 298 (78%) were removed after these individuals met criteria adjudicating them as noninfectious; 86 (22%) remained under travel restrictions at the end of the analysis period. The removals were associated with initiation of or continued treatment (218, 73%), return to treatment following an interruption (33, 11%), or completion of treatment (9, 3%); treatment outcomes were not documented for 38 (13%) removal actions. Individuals added for suspected TB but subsequently determined not to have infectious TB were removed as soon as this determination was made, a median duration of 27 days (range 2e327 days). The two individuals with measles were removed on the fifth day after rash onset when no longer infectious. The median duration on the DNB/PHLO for those who had been removed by the end of the analysis period was 67 days, with a range of 23 h to 1538 days (approximately 4 years). The median duration for the 86 people who remained on the DNB and PHLO at the end of the analysis period was significantly longer (p < 0.0001) at 1065 days; 71 (82%) of these individuals were considered lost to follow up at the end of the analysis period. CDC was notified of 150 attempts to travel while on federal travel restrictions, representing 92 individuals. There were 128 (85%) interceptions during attempted international travel; 27 (21%) of them prevented commercial air travel, and 96 (75%) occurred at a U.S. land-border port of entry. Five (4%) occurred after the individuals traveled by commercial aircraft despite DNB placement but were detected by DHS mid-itinerary or upon arrival. CDC staff were notified to facilitate public health interventions upon arrival. In 22 (15%) instances, individuals had confirmed travel reservations but did not try to travel. One person circumvented the DNB by taking a domestic flight without interception. Of the 92 travelers who were intercepted because of the DNB or PHLO, 60 (65%) became noninfectious through treatment after a single interception and were removed from the DNB and PHLO status; 20 (22%) were removed after two or three interception events, and four (4%) were removed after four or more events. Only eight (9%) of the 86 people who remained on the DNB and PHLO at the end of the analysis period had been intercepted one or more times and did not result in DNB removal ( Table 2) . In instances where one or more interceptions led to treatment and eventual removal from the DNB and PHLO (n ¼ 76), those individuals who were denied an airline boarding pass met criteria for removal faster (n ¼ 23, median ¼ 62 days) than those intercepted at a U.S. land border (n ¼ 46, median ¼ 71 days), but the difference was not significant (p ¼ 0.1327). Information on location of interception was not available for seven individuals. After incorporating the secure, Web-based platform in December 2011 into the process for requesting and processing travel restrictions actions, analysis showed the median time for DNB and PHLO addition and removal processes decreased from 4.0 to 0.65 h (p < 0.0001) for placement and 4.43 to 0.62 h (p < 0.0001) for removal.
