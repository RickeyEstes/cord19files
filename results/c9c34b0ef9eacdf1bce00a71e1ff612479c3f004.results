Atg5 in macrophages favors R. australis infection in vivo. Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice have been developed and employed in previous studies (32) (33) (34) . Briefly, the Atg5 gene was deleted from monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes by breeding Atg5 flox/flox mice (33) to mice expressing the Cre recombinase from the endogenous lysozyme M locus to generate Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice. Deletion of the Atg5 gene in these cells results in a deficit in autophagy (32) (33) (34) . To determine the physiological importance of Atg5 in R. australis infection in vivo, we challenged Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre and Atg5 flox/flox mice with R. australis intravenously (i.v.). Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice were less supportive for the in vivo R. australis infection than Atg5 flox/flox mice, as evidenced by lower rickettsial loads in tissues ( Fig. 1A and B). Immunohistochemical staining with an antibody (Ab) directed against ATG5 confirmed the deficiency of ATG5 in host granulocytes/macrophages (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). As demonstrated in Fig. 1A , the quantity of R. australis in the spleens of infected mice was determined by immunohistochemical analysis using an Ab against rickettsiae. On day 4 postinfection (p.i.), the number of rickettsiae (stained in red and shown with white arrows in Fig. 1A ) was dramatically greater in the spleens of Atg5 flox/flox mice than in those of Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice. Consistent with these results, we found that the concentrations of R. australis in the liver, lung, and spleen of Atg5 flox/flox mice were significantly greater than those in the organs of Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 1B) . The concentrations of R. australis in mice deficient in Atg5 in macrophages were reduced approximately 90% in lung, 56% in liver, and 75% in spleen compared to those in the organs of Atg5 flox/flox mice. One of the major characteristics of mouse models of rickettsial infection is the progression of the disease resulting from the progressively increased bacterial replication, measured by quantitative real-time PCR, in the various infected tissues in vivo (30, 35, 36) . Although we did not show the concentrations of R. australis in tissues at time points earlier than day 4 p.i., the greater concentrations in lung, liver, and spleen in Atg5-competent mice than in those in Atg5-deficient mice most likely suggest that Atg5 is required for the significant expansion of R. australis in vivo. Interestingly, a deficiency of Atg5 in macrophages resulted in significantly enhanced in vivo levels of IL-1␤ in R. australis-infected mice compared to those in their Atg5-competent counterparts (Fig. 1C) , suggesting that Atg5 expression in macrophages negatively regulates the in vivo production of IL-1␤ during R. australis infection. As a control, we did not observe any significantly different levels of IL-6 production in the sera of infected Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice and Atg5 flox/flox mice (Fig. 1C) , suggesting that Atg5 in macrophages specifically inhibits the levels of IL-1␤ production in vivo during R. australis infection. Thus, our results clearly demonstrate that Atg5 expression in macrophages favors R. australis infection in vivo, which results in a greater bacterial load. Autophagy-related genes, including Atg5, have been reported to suppress proinflammatory cytokines in a variety of infection models (37) (38) (39) (40) . Thus, we hypothesized that Atg5 in macrophages favors R. australis infection in vivo in association with the specific inhibition of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1␤. Intracellular infection of R. australis in primary mouse macrophages in vitro is also Atg5 dependent. Next, we investigated whether Atg5 in macrophages supports rickettsial infection in vitro. It is known that peritoneal macrophages and bone marrowderived macrophages (BMMs) from Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice lack Atg5 (41). We first determined whether Atg5 is involved in the accumulation of R. australis in BMMs. As shown in Fig. 2A , at 30 min p.i., no significant difference in the rickettsial loads in the BMMs of Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice and Atg5 flox/flox mice was detected ( Fig. 2A) . These results demonstrate that there is no significant difference in the initial concentrations of intracellular R. australis in the macrophages of Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice and those of Atg5 flox/flox mice. Interestingly, at 48 h p.i., the concentrations of intracellular R. australis in the BMMs of Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice were significantly less (approximately 40%) The serum levels of IL-1␤ and IL-6 in uninfected and infected mice were measured by Bio-Plex assay (Bio-Rad). Each mouse group included at least 3 to 5 mice. The data shown represent those from three independent experiments. *, P Ͻ 0.05; n.s., not significantly different. than those in the BMMS of Atg5 flox/flox mice ( Fig. 2A) . To determine whether the increased concentrations of R. australis in Atg5 flox/flox BMMs compared with those in Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs results from enhanced host cell viability, we examined the viability of BMMs from these transgenic mice at 48 h p.i. We did not observe significant cell death in either R. australis-infected Atg5 flox/flox BMMs or infected Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs (Fig. S2 ) by flow cytometric analysis. Therefore, our in vitro results recapitulated our in vivo results by showing that Atg5 favored intracellular R. australis infection in primary mouse macrophages. Next, we determined the production levels of IL-1␤ and IL-12p70 by R. australisinfected BMMs of Atg5 flox/flox and Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice after 24 h. As shown in We have recently demonstrated that IL-1␤ production by R. australis-infected BMMs is mediated by a caspase-1-dependent inflammasome (31) . Thus, these results suggest that Atg5 deficiency enhances inflammasome-mediated IL-1␤ production by macrophages infected with R. australis. Atg5 supports intracellular accumulation of R. australis in primary mouse macrophages in association with an inhibitory effect on rickettsiae mediated by IL-1␤. Although the in vivo results that enhanced concentrations of R. australis in Atg5-competent macrophages are accompanied by suppressed IL-1␤ production were recapitulated by the in vitro data, it is still plausible that the Atg5-dependent accumulation of R. australis in primary mouse macrophages is associated with IL-1␤. To address this question, we treated R. australis-infected Atg5 flox/flox BMMs and Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs with exogenous recombinant IL-1␤. At 48 h p.i., the concentrations of R. australis in Atg5 flox/flox BMMs treated with recombinant IL-1␤ were significantly less than those in untreated cells (Fig. 3A) . These results suggest that exogenous IL-1␤ plays a part in reducing the concentration of rickettsiae in Atg5 flox/flox BMMs, mostly likely through inhibiting the accumulation of R. australis. Interestingly, the greater concentrations of R. australis in Atg5 flox/flox BMMs than in Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs were abolished by treatment with IL-1␤. However, the concentrations of R. australis in Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs were not altered upon treatment with recombinant IL-1␤. It is possible that R. australis is not able to accumulate or grow in the absence of Atg5 by an IL-1␤independent mechanism. To address this issue, we evaluated the rickettsial loads in cells treated with neutralizing antibodies against IL-1␤ and their corresponding IgG controls. Our results showed that Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs treated with neutralizing antibodies against IL-1␤, but not those treated with the IgG controls, contained concentrations of intracellular R. australis comparable to those in Atg5 flox/flox BMMs (Fig.  3B ). The concentrations of intracellular R. australis in Atg5-deficient BMMs increased upon treatment with neutralizing antibodies against IL-1␤ compared with those in the IgG controls (Fig. 3B) . These results suggest that R. australis is able to accumulate in the absence of Atg5 in association with the IL-1␤-mediated response. Neutralizing antibodies against IL-1␤ did not alter the concentrations of intracellular R. australis in Atg5competent BMMs. Therefore, these results suggest that the increased Atg5-dependent accumulation of R. australis in primary mouse macrophages is closely associated with a reduced IL-1␤-mediated inhibitory effect on rickettsiae. R. australis induces an autophagy-related response instead of active autophagy in Atg5 flox/flox BMMs but not in Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs. To further determine whether Atg5-promoted rickettsial infection is associated with autophagy, we examined autophagy flux in R. australis-infected BMMs from Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre and Atg5 flox/flox mice. The conversion of LC3-I to lipidated LC3-II is a hallmark of autophagy and indicates autophagosome formation (42) . The amount of LC3-II correlates directly with the number of autophagosomes. However, LC3 has also been shown to accumulate independently of autophagosomes (43) . At 1 h p.i., but not 3 h p.i., R. australis induced a significantly increased level of LC3-II in Atg5-competent (Atg5 flox/flox ) macrophages compared to those in the uninfected controls ( Fig. 4A and B) . However, since LC3-II itself is degraded by autophagy, an increased number of autophagosomes may represent either induction of autophagy or blockade of any step downstream of autophagosome formation. To address this issue, we examined the levels of p62/ SQSTM1, a ubiquitin-binding protein that is specifically degraded by autolysosomes. p62/SQSTM1 is considered a useful marker for autophagic vesicle turnover (44) , as the level of p62/SQSTM1 is inversely correlated with autophagy flux. At both 1 h and 3 h p.i., R. australis did not induce a significantly reduced level of p62/SQSTM1 in Atg5 flox/flox BMMs compared to that in the uninfected controls ( Fig. 4A and B) . These results suggest that R. australis induced a modified autophagy process without active autophagic vesicle turnover in Atg5-competent BMMs. BMMs from Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre mice have been shown not to efficiently convert LC3-I to LC3-II (34) . As expected, we did not observe any significant expression levels of lipidated LC3-II, but a dramatically increased amount of p62/SQSTM1 was observed in Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre macrophages compared to Atg5 flox/flox macrophages (Fig. 4A ). Further studies are required to demonstrate whether R. australis blocks the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, resulting in an unaltered level of p62/SQSTM1. We next evaluated whether autophagosomes are induced by R. australis in Atg5competent and Atg5-deficient BMMs by examining LC3 puncta via confocal immunofluorescence microscopic analysis. We found LC3 puncta, labeled in green, in R. australis-infected Atg5 flox/flox BMMs but not in Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs or in the uninfected controls (Fig. 4C) . Quantitative analysis showed that the amount of LC3 puncta was significantly increased in Atg5-competent BMMs but not in Atg5-deficient BMMs compared to that in the uninfected controls (Fig. 4D) . The amount of LC3 puncta in Atg5 flox/flox BMMs was significantly greater than that in Atg5 flox/flox Lyz-Cre BMMs. These results suggest that LC3 puncta in R. australis-infected BMMs accumulated via an Atg5-dependent mechanism. Ultrastructural analysis of R. australis-infected B6 BMMs. Although we observed increased expression levels of LC3-II and LC3 puncta in Atg5-competent BMMs, it remained unclear if autophagosomes were accumulated by infection with R. australis. To this end, we studied the interplay of R. australis with autophagy in BMMs isolated from B6 mice at the ultrastructural level. Transmission electron microscopy is the most traditional method to study mammalian autophagy. An autophagosome is defined as a double-membrane-enclosed vacuole containing undigested cytoplasmic contents (42) . At the ultrastructural level, in R. australis-infected BMMs, we regularly found individual intact rickettsiae or groups of rickettsiae in vacuoles surrounded by double membranes (indicated by arrows) at both 1 h p.i. (Fig. 5A and B) and 3 h p.i. (Fig. 5C and D) around at least a part of their circumference. Rickettsiae (indicated by arrowheads) were found inside these vacuoles (Fig. 5) . These autophagosome-related vesicles were observed in multiple fields and nonserial sections but not in the negative controls. Some autophagosomes had only fragments of inner membrane (Fig. 5A , B, and D, arrows), suggesting that they were either gradually transforming into autophagolysosomes or generated due to a block that occurred after autophagosome formation. R. australis infection does not actively induce autophagic flux, although a small portion of cytosolic bacteria is colocalized with LC3 in BMMs from B6 mice. To further investigate the Rickettsia-associated autophagosome-like compartments observed by electron microscopic analysis in infected wild-type (WT) B6 BMMs, we examined the expression levels of LC3-II and p62/SQSTM1 by immunoblotting. At 1 h p.i., R. australis induced a significantly increased LC3-II/␤-actin (ACTB) ratio accompanied by an unaltered SQSTM1/ACTB ratio compared to that for the uninfected controls ( Fig. 6A and B) . Thus, in line with the observations made above (Fig. 4A and B) , our results suggest that R. australis fails to induce autophagy flux at the very early stage of infection, considering that the levels of p62/SQSTM1 did not reduce upon infection. We next evaluated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopic analysis whether the autophagosome-like compartments are induced by R. australis in BMMs from WT mice. Our previous studies have shown a high infection rate in both R. conorii-and R. australis-infected mammalian host cells (31, 45) . As shown in Fig. 6C , R. australis (red) was detected in the cytosol (nucleus as blue) of most (more than 90%) of the infected BMMs, whereas it was not found in the uninfected controls, suggesting that these bacteria showed a substantial infectivity rate in primary murine macrophages. In line with the results obtained by immunoblotting, confocal immunofluorescence microscopic analysis demonstrated LC3-positive organelles or LC3 puncta (green) in R. australis-infected BMMs at both 1 h and 3 h p.i. (Fig. 6C) . To further determine the association of these LC3-positive organelles with R. australis, we examined their colo- calization with R. australis. Some of these LC3-positive organelles, labeled green, colocalized with R. australis in the cytosol, shown in yellow ( Fig. 6C and D) . Quantitatively, the LC3 puncta were numerous and significantly increased at 1 h p.i. compared to their levels in the uninfected controls ( Fig. 6C and E) . At 3 h p.i., the quantity of LC3 puncta was substantial but not significantly different from that in the uninfected controls (Fig. 6E) . About 36.9% Ϯ 9.9% of infected cells contained LC3 puncta at 1 h p.i., and their levels were significantly decreased at 3 h p.i. (Fig. 6F) . Further quantitative analysis revealed that 20.1% Ϯ 8.1% of rickettsiae colocalized with autophagosomes at 1 h p.i. (Fig. 6G) . These results suggest that autophagy-related compartments, presumably autophagosomes, accumulated at the very early stage of infection. Only a small proportion of rickettsiae were associated with these autophagosomes, although almost all of the cells were infected with rickettsiae. It remains unknown why only part of the infected cells contained LC3 puncta and why a small portion of rickettsiae were colocalized with an LC3-positive compartment. Treatment with rapamycin significantly facilitates R. australis infection in BMMs. Although our results have shown that Atg5 supports R. australis infection in association with autophagosomes in genetically modified BMMs, it remains incompletely clear whether autophagy facilitates R. australis infection. To answer this question, we examined the concentrations of rickettsiae in BMMs treated with rapamycin, a classic autophagy inducer. Autophagy is negatively regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and can be induced in all mammalian cell types by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (46) . WT BMMs were pretreated with a low concentration of rapamycin and then infected with R. australis. We did not find any significant cell death in BMMs treated with rapamycin. At 30 min p.i., we did not find any significant difference in the concentrations of intracellular R. australis in rapamycin-treated BMMs from those in untreated cells (Fig. 7A) . These results suggest that autophagy induction by rapamycin does not have an impact on the concentrations of intracellular rickettsiae at the beginning of the infection. However, at 48 h p.i., the concentrations of intracellular R. australis in rapamycin-treated BMMs were significantly greater than those in the untreated controls (Fig. 7B) . These results suggest that autophagy induction promotes R. australis infection, in line with our results obtained using BMMs from Atg5conditional-knockout mice (Fig. 2A) . These data indirectly suggest that the enhanced concentrations of intracellular R. australis in Atg5-competent BMMs are associated with a host autophagic response, although further investigations are required to reveal the mechanisms involved.
