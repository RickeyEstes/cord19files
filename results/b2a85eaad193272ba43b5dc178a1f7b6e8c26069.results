A total of 247 questionnaires were returned out of 400, for a response rate of 61.7%. The mean age of the nurses was 34 ± 4.9 years. Approximately two-thirds were women (67.9%), and one-third were men (32.1%). The mean number of years of nurses' experiences was 11.5 ± 6.1. Most nurses had Bachelor's degrees (65%); 60.1% of them had previous training on isolation precautions (Table 1) . According to Table 2 , the results of the knowledge part show that of the 12 knowledge questions, the nurses had a mean score of 10.3 ± 1.5. According to our knowledge definitions, the results show that most of the nurses (90%) have a good knowledge of isolation precautions, whereas only 10% demonstrated acceptable or poor knowledge. Nurses mainly demonstrated lack of knowledge about disease-specific isolation precautions. For example, there was a low percentage of correct answers for the precautions of contact isolation question (42.2%), airborne isolation question (40.7%), and when a negative-pressure room should be used question (40.7%). In the isolation practices, the mean score was 10.36 ± 3.8. Only 65% of nurses reported good compliance with isolation practices, 22% reported acceptable compliance, and 23% reported poor compliance. The lowest reported practices were for wearing a mask every time the nurse has a respiratory infection (60.1%) and for wearing personal protective equipment when caring for airborne isolation cases (57.6%) ( Table 2) . Checking the isolation supplies and tools showed that 46.4% of units and wards had no isolation signs, 34.5% had no isolation posters, and isolation rooms were not available in 33.3% of units and wards. In addition, some lack of disinfectant solutions and needle disposal boxes were observed. The data collectors also observed that few nurses were usually following standard infection control precautions (20.2%) and few followed transmission-based isolation precautions (11.9%) ( Table 2) . The results of this study revealed a statistically significant difference (P < .001) in nurses' knowledge based on nurses' academic degrees, where nurses with Bachelor's degrees performed better in knowledge examinations than nurses with 2-year diplomas. However, regarding both nurses' previous training and the existence of isolation guidelines in the unit and ward, there was no significant difference in knowledge and self-reported practices scores (Table 3) .
