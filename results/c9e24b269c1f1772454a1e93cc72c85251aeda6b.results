The vaccination regime affects the RBD-specific IgG response in mice To assess the humoral immune response to different immunisation regimens, mice were immunised with rRBD protein combined with different adjuvants three times at 3-week intervals. Serum samples were collected 2 weeks after each vaccination and total anti-MERS-CoV RBD IgG antibody titres were determined by ELISA. The results indicated that rRBD protein combined with any adjuvant, including alum, IFA, CpG or poly(I:C), could induce a RBD-specific IgG antibody response in the majority of mice after the second immunisation. In a few vaccinated mice, RBD-specific IgG antibodies could be detected even after the first immunisation. The seroconversion rates of the different groups following the first and the second immunisations are shown in Table 1 . As shown in Figure 3A , there was no discernible increase in IgG titres after the third immunisation compared to the second immunisation. Among the vaccination regimes, RBD/A+C and RBD/I+C elicited the highest total IgG titres (p,0.05, Figure 3A) . Besides, the difference of IgG titer in these two groups was not significant (p$0.05, Figure 3A ). Similarly shown in Figure 3A , the difference of IgG titer in RBD/A and RBD/A+P groups had no significance. The RBD-specific antibodies were lower than 1:10 in the adjuvant control groups at each of the three vaccinations. The responses to the various vaccination regimes were investigated using NaSCN antibody-displacement ELISA to measure antibody avidity ( Figure 3B ). Mice received the RBD/ A+C or RBD/I+C regimes had higher antibody avidity 2 weeks after the final vaccination than those received the RBD/A or RBD/A+P regimes. It was also noteworthy that high antibody avidity correlated with a high IgG titre in mice. To further characterise the immune response to the different vaccination regimes, IgG isotype analyses were performed 2 weeks after the final vaccination using secondary antibodies against IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b. As shown in Figures 3C, D , E and F, mice immunised with RBD/A+C or RBD/I+C produced higher IgG1 and IgG2a titres than mice immunised with RBD/A or RBD/A+P. Also, the IgG1 to IgG2a ratio revealed a Th1 skewed response in mice that received the RBD/A+C or RBD/I+C regimes. In contrast, the RBD/A and RBD/A+P regimes produced a higher IgG1/IgG2 ratio, indicating a Th2 response. The titres of RBD-specific IgG2b antibodies, however, were not significantly different among the vaccination groups (p$0.05).
