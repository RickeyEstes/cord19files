The GENDRES cohort included nasopharyngeal samples from 204 patients with a median age of 16.7 (95% CI: 12.7-20.6) months and a male-to-female sex ratio of 1.7. One patient was excluded due to incomplete clinical data. In the UK a cohort of 97 patients' data was analyzed, with a median of age of 36.6 (95% CI: 27.6-45.6) months and a male-to-female ratio of 0.94 (S1 Fig) . Comparison between both cohorts is shown in Table 1 .
