Weight gain ranged from 86% to 512% (Table 2) and was significantly affected by inclusion of the yeastbased protein source. There was a noted decrease (P b 0.0001) in weight gain with increasing inclusion of the yeast-based protein source except for Diet 1 and Diet 2 which had similar weight gains of approximately 500%. Feed conversion ratio values ranged from 5.8 (Diet 5) to 1.9 (Diets 1 and 2) with the FCR decreasing (P b 0.0001) as inclusion rate of the yeast-based protein source increased (Table 2 ). Once again, there was no difference between Diet 1 and Diet 2 and these two diets produced the highest FCR values during the feeding trial. Survival also was significantly affected by dietary treatment as the fish fed Diet 5 had lower survival (63%) compared to an overall survival rate of 99% in cobia fed the remaining diets (Table 2) . Muscle protein also tended to decrease as inclusion of the yeast-based protein source increased with a range of 17.8-19.7% (Table 3) . Muscle protein in fish fed the control diet (Diet 1) and the Diet 2 did not differ. Muscle lipid ranged from 0.5 to 1.8 with the highest lipid level being observed in fish fed the diet containing 25% of the yeast-based protein source, and the lowest lipid level in fish fed Diet 5 (Table 3) . Dry matter and ash ranged from 20.3% to 23.7% and 6.0-9.9%, respectively, with inclusion rate of the yeast-based protein source having significant impacts (P b 0.05). Liver lipid concentration also was significantly impacted by the presence of the yeast-based protein source, ranging from 4.2% to 24.6% wet weight, with fish fed Diets 4 and 5 having lower hepatic lipid levels (P b 0.0001) compared with fish fed the remaining diets. Muscle ratios ranged from 10.1 to 25.3 and decreased (P b 0.001) with increasing levels of yeastbased protein inclusion (Table 4 ), although differences were only noted in fish fed the diets with the highest inclusion levels (Diets 4 and 5, respectively). Visceral somatic index (VSI) increased as inclusion rate of the yeast-based protein source increased. The range of VSI was 10.8-16.4 with the lowest VSI from the control diet (Diet 1) and the highest VSI in fish fed the diet containing 100% of dietary protein from the yeast-based protein source (Diet 5; Table 4 ). Hepatosomatic index (HSI) ranged from 2.2 to 4.6 and was significantly Means of 3 fish per tank (N = 9 treatment âˆ’ 1 ). Means with different superscripts in the same column differed significantly (P b 0.05). impacted by dietary treatment. Smallest livers were observed in fish fed the diet containing 100% of dietary protein from the yeast-based protein source (Diet 5) whereas the largest HSI was recorded in fish fed the control diet (Diet 1; Table 4 ). Packed cell volume (hematocrit) measurements ranged from 32% to 51% and were significantly affected by inclusion of the yeastbased protein source. Fish fed the control diet (Diet 1), Diet 2 and Diet 3 did not differ in hematocrit values and were higher (P b 0.0001) than that observed in fish fed the remaining two diets with increased levels of the yeast-based protein source (Table 4 ). Plasma protein concentrations followed an identical trend as that observed for packed cell volume, ranging from 2.4% to 4.6% with fish Diets 4 and 5 having significantly lower plasma protein levels compared to fish fed the remaining three diets. Fish fed Diet 2 had the highest plasma protein concentrations (P b 0.0001) of any fish in the feeding trial (Table 4) .
