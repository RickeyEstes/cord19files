Constructing recombinant MHV with HA-tagged nsp15. To study the role of nsp15 during infection and address whether nsp15 interacts with other viral proteins, we constructed an in situ tagged form of nsp15 in MHV. Current antibodies used for the study of MHV nsps are limited to rabbit polyclonal sera. In many cases, these antibodies have significant background binding to host proteins, limiting their downstream applications. To circumvent this barrier, we constructed an HA-tagged form of nsp15 in MHV. In MHV, nsp15 contains the P/S, which is an ideal site for in situ tag insertion. The P/S, which forms a conserved stem-loop structure (Fig. 1A , left), is conserved among lineage A ␤-coronaviruses but not other closely related ␤-coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV) (Fig. 1C) (38) . Studies have demonstrated that the P/S can be deleted from MHV without causing significant growth defects (36) . Finally, the amino acids encoded by the P/S are predicted to form a flexible loop, which is surface exposed on the monomer and hexamer of nsp15 ( Fig. 1B) (24) . With these characteristics in mind, we decided to design our in situ epitope tags around the MHV P/S. Initially, we replaced 66 bp of the P/S with that of a 3ϫFLAG sequence, rA59 Nsp15-FLAG (Fig. 1A , right). We were able to rescue recombinant virus but were unable to detect any FLAG-specific signal by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence. Sequence analyses of the P/S revealed a near complete deletion of the 3ϫFLAG sequence from these viruses during initial virus replication after 5 passages (data not shown). The 3ϫFLAG tag was likely unsuccessful due to large differences predicted in the secondary structure and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of the rA59 WT and the 3ϫFLAG-containing P/S (Fig. 1A , right). Considering these data, we set out to create an internal tag that maintained a stem-loop structure in the P/S more closely mimicking the wild-type stem-loop. To achieve this, we inserted the HA tag sequence into the ascending stem of the P/S and its complement into the descending stem of the P/S, creating rA59 Nsp15-HA (Fig. 1A , middle, C). A recombinant virus containing this HA tag was created using an in vitro ligation system as previously described (39) . nsp15-HA is expressed and is stable during serial passaging. Following rescue of rA59 Nsp15-HA , we first examined the expression of nsp15-HA during MHV infection. 17Cl-1 cells were infected with rA59 Nsp15-HA or rA59 WT and analyzed by confocal microscopy and immunoblotting for HA signal. We found that anti-HA antibody could detect nsp15-HA in rA59 Nsp15-HA -infected cells with high specificity and low background ( Fig. 2A and B) . Furthermore, nsp15 was localized to tight perinuclear puncta in both rA59 Nsp15-HA -and rA59 WT -infected cells, indicating the localization of nsp15 was not altered in rA59 Nsp15-HA . We also detected nsp15-HA in rA59 Nsp15-HA cell lysates and found nsp15 levels were equivalent in rA59 Nsp15-HA -and rA59 WT -infected cells (Fig. 2C ). These data indicated our HA tag was detectable, specific, and did not alter nsp15 expression or localization during MHV infection. Next to examine the stability of the in situ HA sequence, rA59 Nsp15-HA was serially passaged on 17Cl-1 cells. Progeny viruses were collected at each passage and used to infect the next set of 17Cl-1 cells using a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately 0.1 PFU/cell. Subsequently, each passage was analyzed for the presence of the in situ HA epitope tag by immunoblotting. nsp15-HA protein levels did not diminish over 5 passages (Fig. 2F ), suggesting the in situ HA tag was stable over multiple passages, unlike the in situ 3ϫFLAG tag. rA59 Nsp15-HA has similar replication kinetics to rA59 WT . We next compared the kinetics of rA59 Nsp15-HA and rA59 WT replication, by infecting 17Cl-1 cells and measuring virus production under multistep growth conditions. rA59 Nsp15-HA replicated similarly compared to rA59 WT (Fig. 2D ). To further support these data, 17Cl-1 cells were infected Input virus was collected following the adsorption step. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay on HeLa-MVR cells (E). 17Cl-1 cells were infected with rA59 WT or rA59 Nsp15-HA at an MOI of 5. Cells were collected at the indicated time points. Levels of gRNA and sgRNA were determined by RT-qPCR and normalized (Continued on next page) nsp15 Interacts with CoV RTC-Associated Proteins ® with rA59 WT or rA59 Nsp15-HA , and viral gRNA and sgRNA (sgRNA7) were measured in single-step growth curves. Levels of sgRNA and gRNA in rA59 Nsp15-HA -and rA59 WTinfected cells differed by no more than 2-fold from 4 to 12 h postinfection (hpi) (Fig. 2E) . Furthermore, amounts of both nsp8 and N proteins were equivalent in rA59 Nsp15-HAand rA59 WT -infected 17Cl-1 cells (Fig. 2C ). From these data, we conclude that insertion of an HA tag into the P/S within nsp15 did not substantially affect virus replication in vitro. rA59 Nsp15-HA has altered selective gRNA packaging. During our investigation of viral growth kinetics, we noted that rA59 Nsp15-HA had significantly increased levels of sgRNA at 2 hpi. We hypothesized that this increase in sgRNA levels was too early to be due to sgRNA transcription and attributed it to increased packaging of sgRNA into virions by rA59 Nsp15-HA . This would be in agreement with previous reports, which demonstrated that P/S mutants altered selective gRNA packaging, so that sgRNA was now incorporated into virions, but did not affect viral replication (36) . To determine the efficiency of selective packaging in rA59 Nsp15-HA , we measured the ratio of sgRNA (sgRNAs 4, 5, 6, and 7) to gRNA in virus isolated from infected cell supernatants by ultracentrifugation. Our results showed that viral RNA obtained from rA59 Nsp15-HAinfected cell supernatants had at least a 25-fold increase in the sgRNA/gRNA ratio (Fig. 3A) . Previous work demonstrated that P/S mutants and wild-type virus have identical growth kinetics, but P/S mutants are readily outcompeted by rA59 WT when cells are dually infected (36) . In order to test whether the rA59 Nsp15-HA virus would be outcompeted by rA59 WT virus, cells were infected with 1:1 or 3:1 mixtures of rA59 Nsp15-HA and rA59 WT at a total MOI of 0.1. This low MOI was used to ensure that only a small number of cells would be infected by both viruses. At 16 hpi, progeny viruses were collected and subsequently used for both immunoblotting and further passaging. The rA59 Nsp15-HA was rapidly outcompeted by rA59 WT , as nsp15-HA signal was greatly diminished by passages 2 and 3 for 1:1 and 3:1 infection ratios, respectively (Fig. 3B ). Taken together, these data indicated that while rA59 Nsp15-HA replicates normally, the HA insertion significantly hampers its capacity to selectively package gRNA over sgRNA, diminishing its competitive advantage. This suggests that while the in situ tag maintained a stem-loop within this region of nsp15, it slightly attenuated the virus by likely altering the primary sequence of the P/S or the internal secondary structure of the RNA in this region or, possibly, a function of nsp15. nsp15 colocalizes with RTC members nsp8 and nsp12. Previously, it was shown that nsp15 localizes with replicating viral RNA (10), potentially to replication compartments and with RTC members. To confirm that nsp15 was in fact localized to RTCs and to expand upon these results, we investigated the colocalization of nsp15 with nsp8 and nsp12 throughout infection. nsp8 and nsp12, the proposed viral primase and RdRp, respectively, are both established members of the replication complex and often used as markers for RTC localization (8, 9) . Following infection with either rA59 Nsp15-HA or rA59 WT , 17Cl-1 cells were fixed at indicated time points throughout infection and then costained with anti-HA and anti-nsp8 or anti-nsp12 antibody. nsp15 strongly colocalized with both nsp8 and nsp12 in rA59 Nsp15-HA -infected cells throughout infection (Fig. 4) . The average Pearson's correlation coefficients (PCCs) ranged from 0.84 to 0.71 for nsp8 and 0.78 to 0.53 for nsp12. There was a small decrease in PCCs for both nsp8 and nsp12 at later time points; however, the PCCs remained above 0.5 throughout infection, which is considered strong colocalization. This colocalization was present in both syncytia and individual infected cells (Fig. 4A and B) . These data demonstrated that nsp15 strongly colocalized with two proteins associated with the CoV RTC by confocal microscopy. nsp15 does not localize to sites of assembly. These results demonstrated strong colocalization of nsp15 with RTCs but did not address whether nsp15 also localized to sites of virus assembly. To this end, we costained rA59 WT -infected cells with anti-nsp15 and anti-M protein antibodies. M protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and is a marker for sites of assembly (40) . To more formally confirm a lack of colocalization, we used rabbit anti-nsp15 to enable the use of a mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) to M protein. M protein displayed tight punctate staining, most likely in the ERGIC compartment, at 6 and 8 hpi (Fig. 5B , top and middle). At 12 hpi, most cells were syncytial, and M puncta were scattered throughout the cytoplasm and potentially the cell membrane, most likely due to Golgi fragmentation (Fig. 5B, bottom) (41) . At all stages of infection, nsp15 did not colocalize with M protein (Fig. 5B) , resulting in low PCCs of Ͻ0.3 throughout infection (Fig. 5C ). Similar results were obtained when cells were infected with rA59 Nsp15-HA in lieu of rA59 WT (data not shown). These results indicated that nsp15 was not localized to sites of assembly during infection. nsp15 interacts with CoV RTC-associated proteins. Due to the strong colocalization of nsp15 with nsp8 and nsp12, we next investigated whether nsp15 physically interacted with these proteins. 17Cl-1 cells were infected with rA59 Nsp15-HA or rA59 WT , and lysates were incubated with HA or nsp8 antibodies to identify interacting partners. Using the anti-HA antibody, no proteins were immunoprecipitated in rA59 WT -infected cells, while nsp8, nsp12, and nsp15-HA coprecipitated in rA59 Nsp15-HA -infected cells (Fig. 6A) . To confirm these interactions, we next examined whether anti-nsp8 antibody would coprecipitate nsp15-HA. We found that nsp12 coprecipitated with nsp8 in both rA59 Nsp15-HA -and rA59 WT -infected cells, in agreement with previous results (Fig. 6B) (9) . Furthermore, we found that nsp15-HA protein was immunoprecipitated with nsp8 nsp15 Interacts with CoV RTC-Associated Proteins ® antibody only in rA59 Nsp15-HA -infected cells (Fig. 6B ). In these experiments, no precipitation of the irrelevant control protein GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was observed, and no viral proteins were immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum (Fig. 6B) . Taken together, these data demonstrated that nsp15 interacted with RTC proteins during MHV infection. Since nsp8, nsp12, and nsp15 are all RNA binding or processing enzymes, we next investigated the dependence of these interactions on RNA binding. To accomplish this, we added a general RNA/DNA nuclease (Pierce Universal Nuclease), which we showed was active in our immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (Fig. 6C) , to cleave all unprotected RNA. We found no difference in the interactions between nsp8 and nsp15-HA when nuclease was present (Fig. 6D) , demonstrating that these interactions were not dependent on RNA intermediates.
