Data on 259 patients with unexplained fever (133 pre-and 126 post-GB) were analyzed in this study. The mean ages of subjects before and after GB were 15.62 ± 1.94 years and 19.10 ± 2.28 years, respectively. In the pre-budget group, 57% of subjects were male and in the post-budget group, 61% of subjects were male. The mean income state indexes before and after GB were 0.74 ± 0.14 and 0.75 ± 0.13, respectively. The mean Charlson comorbidity index before and after GB were 0.26 ± 0.07 and 0.38 ± 0.09, respectively. There were no significant differences in age, male to female ratio, or income state index before and after implementation of the GB system (P = .06, P = .20, P = .89). However, there was a significant difference in Charlson comorbidity index before and after GB (P = .04) ( Table 1) . The mean LOS before adoption of the GB was 4.22 ± 0.35 days and the mean LOS after implementation of the system was 5.29 ± 0.70 days. The mean diagnostic costs before and after the GB system went into effect were NT$1,440.05 ± 97.43 and NT $2,224.34 ± 238.36, respectively. The mean drug costs increased from NT$3,249.90 ± 1,108.27 at baseline to NT$4,272.31 ± 1,466.90 after adoption of the GB system. The mean therapy costs before and after GB were NT$421.03 ± 100.03 and NT $2,217.03 ± 672.20, respectively. The mean total costs increased from NT$13,866.77 ± 2,114.95 at baseline to NT$22,856.41 ± 4,196.28 after the system went into effect. The mean 3-day ED revisiting rate decreased from 10.5% ± 2.7% at baseline to 6.3% ± 2.2% after adoption of the GB system. The mean 14-day readmission rates before and after GB were 8.3% ± 2.4% and 4.0% ± 1.7%, respectively. There were significant differences in LOS, diagnostic costs, therapy costs, total costs, 3-day ED revisiting rate, and 14-day readmission rate before and after implementation of the GB system among patients with www.md-journal.com unexplained fever (P = .03, P = .001, P < .001, P = .01, P = .02, P = .04, respectively). There was no significant difference in drug costs before and after the GB among patients with unexplained fever (P = .19) ( Table 2) .
