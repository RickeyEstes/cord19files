Genomic (Table 1) . CCoV was the most frequent in apparently healthy dogs, followed by CDV, CDV, CPV-2, CRV and CAdV. No significant difference was observed between groups. The vaccination status was also evaluated in the present study. In vaccinated dogs, only CPV-2 and CRV were detected (Table 1 ). In dogs that received the incomplete vaccine protocol, CPV-2 was the most frequent, followed by CCoV, CDV and no detection of CRV and CAdV-positive animals. In unvaccinated dogs, CPV-2 was also the most frequent detected virus, followed by CDV, CCoV, CRV and CAdV. No significant difference was observed between groups. Single infections were observed in the majority of the positive samples (63.0%, 116/184), where CPV-2 was the most frequently detected (44.0%, 51/116), followed by CDV (28.4%, 33/116), CCoV (19.8%, 23/116), CRV (4.3%, 5/116) and CAdV (3.4%, 4/116) ( Table 2 ). Co-infections (samples positive for two or more viruses) were observed in 37.0% (68/184) of the positive samples. Among them, dual infections were the most common (86.8%, 59/68), although triple (10.3%, 7/68) and quadruple (2.9%, 2/68) infections were also found. Regarding the sanitary status, co-infections were observed in 31.2% (24/77) of the dogs presenting enteric-associated clinical signs and in 15.9% (13/82) of apparently healthy dogs (Table 3) . When the vaccination status was evaluated (Table 3) , co-infections were observed in 5.3% (1/59) of the vaccinated dogs, in 45.8% of dogs that received incomplete protocols of vaccination and in 19.9% of the unvaccinated dogs. No significant difference was observed between groups. The most frequent viruses involved in co-infections were CDV and CPV-2, with each one detected in 73.5% (50/68) and 72.1% (49/68) of the samples positive for more than one virus, respectively, followed by CCoV (48.5%, 33/68), CRV (14.7%, 10/68) and CAdV (7.4%, 5/68). The combination of CDV and CPV-2 was the most frequently observed (52.9%, 36/68 CDV + CPV-2 positive samples), although other viruses were also detected in six of these samples (Table 1) . PCR and RT-PCR positive samples were submitted for DNA sequencing and confirmed amplification of the wild strains and no contamination with positive controls (data not shown).
