We quantified transcription in lung tissue of young and old mice at 2 and 5 days after inoculation with RSV, and in lung tissue of non-inoculated young and old mice. For the analysis of RSV-regulated genes we considered the genes that were significantly up or downregulated at any of the two time points upon inoculation. We analysed dissimilarities between the 6 groups for the combined set of all regulated genes by principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig. 1A ). This showed a clear separation between all groups. The first principal component (PC1) explains 57% of all variance and shows differences between age groups under all conditions. Moreover, as illustrated by the Venn diagram in Fig. 1B , the young and old groups show both unique and shared up and downregulated genes (Fig. 1B) . Functional annotation analysis by DAVID 24 of all 373 significantly regulated genes under any of the conditions by age and/or response to RSV at any of the days after inoculation with RSV revealed that several pathways and functionalities were overrepresented, which -for further analysis-we grouped into several umbrella categories. We categorized genes with known immunological functions as innate interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral function (24 genes), cytokines (8 genes), antigen processing and presentation (6 genes), immunoglobulins (10 genes), or other immune function (18 genes). Also, twenty genes involved in matrix constitution were significantly regulated in our study. For the six categories mentioned above, different expression patterns can be recognized (Fig. 2 ). In addition, 172 genes with known functionalities were annotated by functions other than these aforementioned categories. Of all differentially regulated genes, 70 genes were not annotated as having a function ('unknown function') and 45 genes are only known as gene models based on their sequence, but it is not known if they correspond to actual genes or have a functionality. For our further analyses of genes annotated by DAVID, we included only the genes that could be categorized by the six functional categories. Aging regulates gene expression in lungs under basal conditions. Aging itself induces alterations in expression of a considerable number of genes as shown by comparison of lungs of non-RSV inoculated mice at young and old age (Fig. 1B) . Notably, 15 percent of these genes that were regulated by aging in the absence of RSV infection were also significantly regulated by RSV in young mice (Fig. 1B) , indicating that aging induces biological features in lungs that are found at young age only upon exposure to RSV. Thus, aging of lung tissue defines a distinctive set of altered gene expressions in steady state. In the absence of RSV we observed in lungs of old mice a major elevation of expression of immunoglobulin genes (J chain, Igkv3-4, Igkv4-59, Igk, Igkv6-23, Igkc, Ighg, Igh-VJ558), compared to lungs of young mice ( Table 1) . Some of these, among which the J chain, showed the highest upregulation of all genes regulated in the study. Among the genes we categorized further we observed elevated expression at old age for the cytokine genes Cxcl9 and Spp1, for a gene involved in antigen processing and presentation (Azgp1), for eight other immune-related genes (Cxcr6, Gata3, Sp110, Procr, Cybb, Tnfrsf17, C4b, Cfb), and for two matrix-related genes (Vwc2 and Dmbt1). Among the gene expression that was downregulated by aging we found many genes that are involved in matrix constitution (Col3a1, Adamts15, Adamts9 only one gene that could be classified by immune function (Lef1). These data indicate that aging leads to elevated expression of immunological activity in lungs, and downregulation of genes involved in constitution of the extracellular matrix of lung tissue prior to infection. Response to RSV in lungs distinctive of young age. The principal component analysis shows differences between groups related to the response to RSV by principle component 2 (PC2). Young and old mice showed a response to RSV roughly in the same direction and with a similar overall magnitude. Overall, in both young and old animals the fold change of gene expression in response to RSV was strongest at two days after virus inoculation (Fig. 1A) . RSV regulated 109 genes in young mice that were not found to be significantly altered in RSV-inoculated lungs at old age (Fig. 1B) . As shown in Table 2 , we found upregulated expression of cytokine genes (Ccl8, Cxcl10, Ccl7, Ccl2, Ltb, Bmp7), genes involved in antigen processing and presentation (B2m, H2-K1, Fcgr1, H2-D1, H2-Q4), one gene of the innate antiviral IFN-pathway (Iigp1), and genes involved in other immune functions (Saa3, Ctss, Clec7a, Cx3cr1, Ly86). Among the downregulated genes, we found one gene involved in matrix (Angptl4) and two genes with immune functions (Nr4a3, Rgcc). All other downregulated genes were annotated by other functionalities than immune or matrix functions (Supplemental Table S1 ). Some responses to RSV were found also at old age (e.g. induction of B2M and other molecules involved in antigen processing and presentation) or were even stronger (e.g. Saa3, Cxcl10) in old mice but did not reach significance. These data indicate that aging causes loss of responsiveness in different molecular pathways involved in the innate immune response to RSV in the lungs. Notably, of the genes that are regulated by aging only (i.e. without RSV infection), some were also significantly regulated by RSV in young mice ( Table 3 ), indicating that aging induces biological features in lungs that are found at young age only upon exposure to RSV. Among the downregulated genes we found three adamts-encoding genes. Moreover, expressions of a set of genes involved in immune functions that are induced in response to RSV at young age were significantly elevated at old age (Cxcl9, Cfb, C4b, Cybb, Gata3). This indicates enhanced immunological activity in the lungs at old age that would be induced at young age only by an extrinsic trigger like an infection by RSV. This suggests partial anti-viral immune activity that may be involved in protection against infection at the time of inoculation with RSV particularly at old age. Gene expression regulated by RSV in the context of aging. Overall, the principal component analysis indicates that variation of responsiveness to RSV between individuals is larger in the old age group compared to the young RSV-inoculated mice (Fig. 1A) . This larger variation was also reflected in the pooled standard deviation in gene expression within each group, and shows more intragroup heterogeneity in old mice two and five days after inoculation with RSV (Table 4) . Moreover, a unique set of genes was upregulated by RSV exclusively at old age ( Table 5 ). Most of the upregulated immune-related genes in the RSV inoculated old animals were found in the antiviral IFN-pathway (Ifi204, Oas1a, Oas2, Eif2ak2, Oas1g) and only two in other immune pathways (C1rb, Dhx58). Some genes, like Plxna2 and Klfl1 were downregulated in response to RSV exclusively at old age, but none of these genes were within the six selected categories. These data show that aging promotes responsiveness to RSV of a unique set of genes that are not significantly activated by RSV at young age, and a substantial part of these genes are involved in innate antiviral IFN-pathways. Our further analyses defined a unique set of genes that were up and down regulated in response to RSV at both young and old age (Table 6) . Notably, of all molecules related to immune responsiveness within this unique set, only molecules that are part of the innate antiviral IFN pathway were involved. Expressions of these antiviral molecules were all upregulated and comprised a major part of all RSV regulated genes. Moreover, most of these molecules of the innate antiviral IFN pathway were activated more strongly at old age. Altogether, the data indicate that RSV induces a stronger activation of the local innate anti-viral IFN pathway at old age. Viral loads in lungs show impaired clearance of RSV due to aging. Among the RNA isolated from lungs at two and five days after inoculation with RSV we analysed the amount of RSV-transcripts by qPCR to determine clearance of the virus over the period in which we performed our arrays (Fig. 3 ). The amount of RSV relative to housekeeping gene Hprt was similar between young and old mice at two days after inoculation, whereas in mock controls no RSV was detected (Ct > 40). This indicates that viral loads in lungs did not differ between young and old mice at two days after inoculation. However, viral loads significantly increased further until day five only in the old group, leading to significantly higher viral loads in old mice compared to young mice. This indicates that the first line of defence of aged mice functions less adequately to control a respiratory infection with RSV. Validation of microarray data. For ten significantly regulated genes, selected from five pathways or functions, we performed Q-PCR validation (Supplemental Table S3 ). Overall, the extent of regulation found by Q-PCR correlated well with that found by microarray analysis (Spearman R = 0.92). The magnitude of the upor down-regulation was somewhat larger in the Q-PCR data, with the median difference to the corresponding microarray values being 17%. This slightly enhanced effect size in Q-PCR is in agreement with previous findings 4 . In functional terms, the Q-PCR analyses confirmed the main findings of the microarray analyses, namely: stronger activation of anti-viral type-I interferon pathways in old mice than in young mice; down-regulation by age of genes involved in extracellular matrix; up-regulation of cytokines by old age as well as due to RSV infection; as well as the expression pattern found for antigen processing and presentation and other immune functionality. Predicted upstream regulators and disease-related pathways indicate functional interference between aging and anti-viral responses. Next, we aimed to predict which upstream molecules that regulate the expression of genes we analysed may be affected by aging. Considering the genes that were significantly regulated in our arrays as downstream effectors, we applied Ingenuity to predict which molecules may serve as their upstream regulators and are affected by aging. Table 7 shows regulators for which an activated or inhibited status was predicted by cognate enrichment (quantifying change by z-score > 2 and P < 1 × 10 −10 ) for the combined up and downregulation of the expression of the downstream molecules we found altered significantly in our arrays. This analysis predicted inhibition of a set of upstream regulators by aging under steady state conditions (dexamethasone, IL4, Vegf, TGFB1, NR3C1, AGT). These regulatory processes influenced by aging point at defective immune suppression via glucocorticoid receptors (dexamethasone and the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1) and TGF-B. Aging and infection by RSV are both known to involve biological processes that are part of disease. We questioned whether the profile of gene expression in the lungs that is altered by aging may indicate overlap with known disease profiles. To this end, we analysed enrichment by significantly regulated genes in our study for known biological disorders by Ingenuity (Table 8 ). This analysis showed that the expression profile induced by RSV infection in the lungs showed most resemblance with the same five diseases in young and old mice. Among these biological disorders, we found RSV-unrelated diseases like gastrointestinal disease, endocrine system disorders, and metabolic disorders. However, even in the absence of an RSV infection we found that aging enriched for some of these diseases that were enriched for in response to RSV, i.e. organismal injury (136 genes), immunological disease (55 molecules), and metabolic disease (49 genes). In addition, the transcriptomic profile of aging in lung tissue resembled processes involved in cancer (134 genes) and haematological disease (55 genes). These findings suggest that aging induces biological alterations in lungs that resemble injury, involve aberrations of metabolism, and disorders mediated by functions of the immune system that would be induced at young age only by exogenous pathogens like RSV.
