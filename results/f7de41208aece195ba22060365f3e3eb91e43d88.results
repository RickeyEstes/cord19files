Vaccination and challenge of dromedaries. Twenty calves (10 seronegative and 10 seropositive) were divided into four groups (n = 5/group). Group −C: seronegative camels receiving control injections of either PBS (n = 3) or ChAdOx1 encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (ChAdOx1-eGFP) (n = 2), group −V: seronegative camels receiving ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine, group + C: seropositive camels receiving control injections of either PBS (n = 3) or ChAdOx1-eGFP (n = 2), and group + V: seropositive camels receiving ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). Serum samples were collected at day 0 pre-vaccination then at 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168 , and 365 days post immunisation (d.p.i.). In addition, at 45 d.p.i., two camels from groups −V or −C were boosted by a second injection of ChAdOx1 MERS or PBS, respectively; and samples were collected at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days post boost (d.p.b.) as shown in Fig. 1 . Three months post prime (i.e. 84 d.p.i.), vaccinated camels were challenged in a natural infection model by introducing ten naturally infected and virus shedding camels, referred to as "infectious camels" in 1:2 (infectious:experimental) ratio, in order to evaluate the vaccine efficacy (Fig. 1) . The MERS-CoV was tested in nasal swabs by RT-qPCR for 21 days post challenge (d.p.c.) and then at 28 and 56 d.p.c. Camels were all negative for MERS-CoV infection at 28 and 56 d.p.c., except one individual camel at 28 d.p.c. ( Figure S4 ). ChAdOx1 MERS enhances antibody responses in seropositive dromedaries. Serum samples were evaluated using commercial ELISA kits ( Figure S1 ) and an inhouse anti-S1 endpoint titre ELISA (Fig. 2) . In seronegative camels (group −V), anti-S1 Abs were detectable only in the two camels that have received boost vaccination ( Fig. 2A) . These Ab levels were similar to the titres in naturally infected camels; however, these Ab titres decreased by 0.5 log by day 84 d.p.i., i.e. at the time of challenge ( Fig. 2A) . This indicates that generating measurable anti-spike Abs in naive dromedaries by vaccination is possible; however, these Abs decline over three months and vaccine boosting strategies should be considered for naive calves. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ ChAdOx1 MERS significantly reduces rhinorrhoea in challenged dromedaries. Ten infectious camels (MERS-CoV naturally infected and viral shedding camels) confirmed to be positive for MERS-CoV by RT-qPCR with a Ct value below 30 ( Figure S2 ) were co-housed with the experimental 20 calves from the vaccination experiment in one pen starting from 84 d.p.i. (Fig. 1 ), resulting in a total of 30 camels in a pen of 30 m2. As an arbitrary indication of infection, nasal discharges from camels in all groups were evaluated and scored from 0-3 (from normal to severe; as explained in the methods) depending on the discharge abundance for 14 d.p.c. Figure S3 . Areas under the curve (AUC) of these scores were plotted in Fig. 3 . Most camels in seropositive vaccinated (+V) and control (+C) groups had mild nasal discharges that resolved 5 and 7 days post challenge, respectively ( Figure S3B ,D); only three camels in both seropositive groups had severe nasal discharge that lasted for one or two days only. The seronegative groups (−C and −V) showed nasal discharge that persisted for two weeks. Overall, the vaccine in both seropositive and seronegative camels reduced the nasal discharge over time significantly as compared to control camels, p = 0.0274 as analysed by mixed model analysis. In the group −V, the vaccine effect on reducing nasal discharges was not substantially different between prime-boost vaccinated camels (camel number: −V-01 and −V-05) and prime-only vaccinated camels ( Figure S3C ). The areas under the curve (AUC) of nasal discharge scores were also plotted to show the overall reduction in these scores in vaccinated camels as compared to the control camels, seropositive vaccinated camels had significant overall reduction in nasal discharge, p = 0.01 (Fig. 3B ).
