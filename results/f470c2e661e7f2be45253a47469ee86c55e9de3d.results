Of 69 patients admitted to Lau King Howe Hospital, rotavirus was detected by EM, ELISA, or PAGE in 35 (51%). Adenovirus was detected m 2 patients and coronavirus-like particles in one (Table  1) . Patients with rotavirus-positive diarrhoea were significantly older than those in whom rotavirus could not be detected (P<O*OOl), the major age group affected being from 6 to 24 months of age ( Table 2) . Three of 10 (30%) controls in Sibu were excreting rotaviruses, as were 3 of 10 patients at Kapit. One patient at Kapit was also excreting astroviruses. Throughout the period studied no patients died of gastroenteritis. There were no significant differences between rotavirus and non-rotavirus associated diarrhoea in terms of clinical features, other than the observation that patients excreting rotaviruses were more likely to oresent earlier. most within 4 d (Pt0.05) ( Table 31. Comparison' of ELISA, EM, 'and PA& for the detection of rotaviruses in faecal samples indicated that the 3 techniques were of similar sensitivity. Rotavirus ribonucleic acid was detected in 37 faecal samples by PAGE. Four different electropherotypes could be identified (Figure) . Two of these, designated 1B and ZB, were detected only once each. Of the others, 27 (72%) exhibited a 'short' electropherotype designated lA, and 7 (10%) a 'long' electropherotype, 2A. Two of these samples contained a mixture of 1A and 2A ( demonstrated significantly more hypotonic dehydra- tion and need for intravenous therapy than those in whom the long electropherotype 2A was detected (Table 4 ). Those in whom the long electropherotype was detected tended to be more lethargic (Table 5) .
