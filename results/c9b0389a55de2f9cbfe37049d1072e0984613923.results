Elevated plasma levels of acute phase markers in AHI prior to detection of viremia Samples collected at sequential time points spanning the eclipse and viral ramp-up phases from 19 US plasma donors who acquired HIV-1 infection were studied to gain insight into the kinetics of the earliest systemic anti-viral defenses activated in the acute phase of infection. Plasma was typically obtained from each donor at intervals of 2-5 d. Plasma panels were tested for HIV-1 by RT-PCR analysis of viral RNA titers, and time courses from different donors were aligned relative to the time point (T 0 ) when viremia first reached levels detectable by conventional assays (.100 RNA copies ml 21 ; Fig. 1A ). Most panels covered a timeframe from around d 220 to d +20 relative to T 0. It is currently thought that the eclipse phase in HIV-1 infection is in the range of 7-10 d [12, 15] hence most panels likely included samples collected from time points prior to the acquisition of infection onwards. In order to determine whether there are detectable changes in plasma proteins or peptides accompanying the emergence of viremia, an initial mass spectrometry-based screen was performed on three plasma donor panels (Fig. 1B) . Analysis of the longitudinal MALDI-TOF data revealed mass peaks that were elevated at viremic time points ( Fig. 2A) . One mass peak with a molecular mass of 2178 Dalton [M+H] + was found to be considerably elevated in HIV-1-positive plasma ( Fig. 2A) . Sequencing by MALDI-TOF/TOF and LC-MS/MS identified this mass as peptide 86-105 derived from A-SAA ( Fig. 2B and Fig.  S1A) . A semi-quantitative analysis of mass peak intensities of the 2178Da [M+H] + peptide mass revealed that this peptide was elevated coincident with the increase in viremia, and in 2 of the 3 subjects, immediately prior to the detection of viremia (Fig. 2C) , suggesting that A-SAA protein levels are elevated at these times. A second mass peak with a molecular mass of 2213 Dalton [M+H] + was identified as peptide 960-979 of complement C3 (Fig. S1B) . This peak was also elevated prior to as well as during viremia (Fig. 2C ). Plasma levels of A-SAA are increased prior to and during detection of viremia in AHI A-SAA was shown previously to be elevated in patients with AIDS [16] , and is commonly used as a general marker for inflammation [17, 18] . A recent study demonstrated that A-SAA has anti-viral activity in vitro [19] . We therefore examined a larger set of plasma donor panels (19) by ELISA to test whether elevation of A-SAA levels may be a general feature associated with acute HIV-1 infection, and how its induction is related to the increase in plasma viral RNA titers. As a control and to establish a baseline for use in statistical analysis of the data, we also measured A-SAA levels in plasma panels from five control plasma donors who did not become infected with HIV (Fig. S2A) . Baseline levels of A-SAA (calculated as described in the methods section) varied between individuals and were generally between 600-3800ng/ml. Analysis of A-SAA levels in the plasma panels from HIV-infected donors confirmed that A-SAA was elevated relative to baseline prior to and/or concurrent within the earliest detection of viremia. Importantly, significant A-SAA elevations (i.e. falling above a 90% prediction interval) were observed prior to T 0 (viral RNA .100 copies ml 21 ) in 15 out of 19 subjects (Fig. 3A) . In the subject group as a whole, A-SAA levels were thus elevated significantly prior to T 0 , the time of first detection of plasma viremia (p = 0.02, as determined using a Binomial test). To monitor alterations of the acute form (A-SAA) as well as the constitutively expressed form (C-SAA) of serum amyloid A, we
