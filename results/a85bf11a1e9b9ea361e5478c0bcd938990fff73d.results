Of the 2433 subjects enrolled from 16 March 2010 to 10 September 2012, 2427 specimens were available for PCR testing for MERS-CoV and had clinical data available. The median age was 3.5 months, 60% were male, and 10% had an underlying medical condition, 30% required oxygen, 11% had the diagnosis of pneumonia and 7% were admitted to the ICU. In addition, 2% attended day care and 76% were exposed to smokers. The majority (97%) of the fathers were employed, and 39.6%, 44.8% and 10% of the mothers finished primary education, secondary education and college, respectively. The majority of children lived in Amman; however, some children lived in the surrounding cities, including Zarqa (34 children, 1.4%). Table 1 includes demographic data, diagnoses and outcome data for the entire group and by testing sites. Of 1898 specimens prospectively tested for other viruses and Orf1b rRT-PCR assays with 10 lL of RNA per reaction and all were negative. Finally, these specimens were retested using the CDC MERS-CoV nucleocapsid primers and probes provided to Vanderbilt and were also negative. These four specimens were then inoculated into Vero and LLC-MK2 cells. Three of the samples showed evidence of bacterial or fungal contamination within 24-48 h following inoculation and were discarded and not recultured due to lack of an adequate amount of samples. Cells inoculated with the fourth sample were monitored for 7 days and then passaged into new cultures and followed for an additional 10 days. No CPE was detected. Comparisons among the three groups were made using the Kruskal-Wallis test or Pearson chi-square test for continuous variables and categorical variables, respectively.
