ORF4b inhibits induction of IFN-β in a dose-dependent manner, but does not induce apoptosis. It was previously reported that ORF4b mainly co-localized with the nucleus and functions as an IFN antagonist 15, 17 ; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Thus, we characterized ORF4b-mediated inhibition of type I IFN production. First, a plasmid encoding ORF4b was transfected into HeLa cells, and the subcellular localization of ORF4b was observed. Consistent with previous reports, ORF4b protein predominantly localized to the nucleus with a fraction dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A) . Furthermore, unlike SARS ORF3b 27 , ORF4b-expressing cells did not show growth defects or signs of apoptosis (Fig. 1B) . To confirm the inhibitory function of type I IFN production, we transfected 293T cells with increasing amounts of ORF4b-expressing plasmid (Fig. 1C ), together with a plasmid expressing firefly luciferase reporter driven by the IFN-β promoter and a plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase that served as the internal control. As expected, expression of ORF4b protein resulted in the significant suppression of SeV-induced activation of the IFN promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D ). ORF4b inhibits IFN-β expression by targeting MDA5, TBK1, and IKKε. SeV is a strong inducer of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)-mediated IFN signaling pathway 23 . ORF4b-mediated inhibition of SeV-induced IFN-β production and IRF3 activation suggests that the protein targets one or several components of the RLR signaling pathway. RIG-I and MDA5 recognize 5′ -triphosphate RNA and dsRNA from RNA viruses and initiate host antiviral responses, whereby a number of downstream molecules are recruited or activated 21 . To characterize the possible step and molecular target of ORF4b in the IFN induction signaling pathway, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were performed. The 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for Flag-tagged RIG-I, MDA5, IKKε , TBK1, and GFP-tagged IRF3 and MAVS with ORF4b. Although comparable expression levels of both ORF4b protein and the transducer proteins were observed in 293T cells, ORF4b protein co-immunoprecipitated with MDA5, IKKε , and TBK1, but not with RIG-I, MAVS, or IRF3 ( Fig. 2A) . Notably, precipitation with HA or Flag/GFP antibodies yielded similar results ( Fig. 2A) , and also the co-localization of ORF4b and MDA5, IKKε , and TBK1 was found in HeLa cells (Fig. 2B) , suggesting that the ORF4b protein interacts with MDA5, IKKε , and TBK1. Furthermore, to determine whether ORF4b interacts with the endogenous MDA5, IKKε , and TBK1, we transfected 293T cells with ORF4b expressing plasmid. Then ORF4b was immunoprecipitated by anti-HA monoclonal antibody, and the co-immunoprecipitation was assessed by Western blotting using anti-MDA5, IKKε , and TBK1 monoclonal antibody. In agreement with the former observation, the endogenous MDA5, IKKε , and TBK1 proteins were successfully co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2C) . These results suggest that ORF4b inhibited IFN-β expression by targeting MDA5, TBK1, and IKKε , a step upstream of IRF3. To further confirm the inhibition step of ORF4b, we transfected plasmid expressing HA-tagged ORF4b and plasmids expressing various transducer proteins that stimulate IFN production in the RIG-I signaling pathway, including RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, IKKε , TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7, into 293T cells together with the IFN-β reporter plasmid and the internal control. Interestingly, ORF4b inhibited the induction of IFN-β by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, IKKε , and TBK-1 (Fig. 2D) . However, consistent with previous reports 17 , ORF4b also inhibited IRF3 and IRF7-induced production of IFN-β (Fig. 2D ), suggesting that ORF4b may function in the nucleus to inhibit type I IFN production. Deletion of the nuclear localization signal in ORF4b inhibits the induction of IFN-β, but is unable to inhibit IRF3 and IRF7-induced production of IFN-β. Since ORF4b localizes to the nucleus, which may contribute to inhibition of IRF3-induced production of IFN-β , it implied that ORF4b could also inhibit the induction of IFN-β in the nucleus. We hypothesized that abolishing the nuclear import of ORF4b would result in its inability to inhibit IRF3-induced production of IFN-β . To explore this hypothesis, we constructed a truncated ORF4b with a deletion of the N-terminal 2-38 amino acids (aa), which correspond to the predicted NLS-containing region. As expected, ORF4b (Δ 2-38) exclusively localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A) , and inhibited the induction of IFN-β by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, IKKε , and TBK-1 at comparable levels as ORF4b, but not IRF3 and IRF7 (Fig. 3B,C) . In accordance with these results, ORF4b (Δ 2-38) was easily found to interact and co-localize with MDA5, IKKε , and TBK-1 (Fig. 3D,E) . These data indicate that ORF4b can inhibit the induction of IFN-β in both the cytoplasm and nucleus.
