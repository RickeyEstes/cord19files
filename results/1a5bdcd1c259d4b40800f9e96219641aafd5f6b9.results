Amplification and cloning of the FCoV types I and II S genes RNA was isolated from FIPV 79-1146-infected cell culture supernatant and from the jejunum of a cat with FIP. The type II and type I FCoV S genes were amplified respectively in one-step RT-PCR reactions. Primer sets T003/T004 and T013/T014 were used to produce truncated cDNA versions of the type II (4347 bp) and type I (4392 bp) S genes. The truncated versions of the S glycoprotein genes terminated 11 codons upstream of the authentic S gene stop codon and eliminated a dibasic retention signal (KXHXX, KVHV/ IH), which is proposed to contribute to the localization of FCoV S glycoprotein to the site of virus assembly at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (Lontok et al., 2004) . Primer sets T009/T010 and T013/ T015 were used to produce full-length versions of the type II (4383 bp) and type I (4428 bp) S genes. Each of the four S gene PCR cDNA fragments was then cloned into the Blunt II-TOPO vector and colonies containing the correct plasmid inserts were identified by restriction enzyme analysis. Sequencing the S gene cDNA inserts was done using FCoV type II and type I S gene-specific primers and the Blunt II-TOPO vector-specific primers M13-F and M13-R. This revealed the presence of mutations in each construct. Before proceeding, these mutations were repaired by the exchange of restriction fragments from cDNA clones with authentic S glycoprotein gene sequences. Because of the position of the mutations and a lack of convenient restriction sites in the type I S gene constructs, silent mutations at positions 474 (AAG) and 1827 (TAC) were not repaired. Plasmid DNA from the four Blunt II-TOPO S gene constructs was digested using KpnI and XhoI and the S gene fragments were ligated into the multiple cloning site of pCAGGS vector DNA. The correct plasmid inserts were identified by restriction enzyme analysis, and nucleotide sequencing confirmed that all four inserts had the expected S gene nucleotide sequence. The vector-cDNA junctions were also verified by sequencing with vector-specific primers, pCAGG-F and pCAGG-R (see Supplementary Table S1 , available in JGV Online). The constructs were designated pCAGGS/FCoVII-Str (type II, truncated), pCAGGS/FCoVII-S (type II, full-length), pCAGGS/FCoVI-Str (type I, truncated) and pCAGGS/ FCoVI-S (type I, full-length).
