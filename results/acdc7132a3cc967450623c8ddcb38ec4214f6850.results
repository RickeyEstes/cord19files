Of 778,051 people captured in the HKDSD, we excluded 33,916 people who had diabetes codes but did not fulfil other criteria of diabetes. We further excluded 137,569 cases of prevalent diabetes (episodes fulfilling diabetes between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2001) and 44,544 cases of diabetes that occurred between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016. The remaining 562,022 people with incident type 1 or type 2 diabetes occurring between 2002 and 2015 were included in the analysis (S1 Fig, S1 Table) . Demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort at diagnosis are detailed in S2 Table. Trends in incidence of type 1 diabetes Using the derived algorithm, 2,426 people with newly diagnosed diabetes were classified as having type 1 diabetes, among whom 774 (31.9%) were aged <20 years and 845 (34.8%) and 807 (33.3%) were aged 20 to <40 years and �40 years, respectively (S1 Table) . Age-standardised incidence of type 1 diabetes increased from 2005 to 2015 in people aged <20 years in both sexes, from 3.5 (95% CI 2.2-4.9) to 5.3 (95% CI 3.4-7.1) per 100,000 person-years (AAPC 3.6% [95% CI 0.2-7.1], p < 0.05) in boys and from 4.3 (95% CI 2.7-5.8) to 6.4 (95% CI 4.3-8.4) per 100,000 person-years (AAPC 4.7% [95% CI 1.7-7.7], p < 0.05) in girls (Table 1) . Broken down into narrower age bands, the incidence of type 1 diabetes peaked in the age groups of 5-9 years in the female sex and 10-14 years in the male sex and declined with increasing age. Among those aged 20 to <40 years and �40 years, incidence of type 1 diabetes remained stable over time (Table 1 ). Sex differences in the risk of type 1 diabetes were detected in the people aged <20 years but not in people aged �20 years. The rate ratio for type 1 diabetes was 1.38 (95% CI 1.10-1.37, p < 0.05) in girls compared with boys.
