Although appearing healthy at birth, at 10 days of life the child developed onychomycosis in both hands and feet that was treated with antibiotics. Thirty days later, she presented skin lesions with impetigo, purulent exudate from the eye, and bronchiolitis. The causative infective agents were not identified. At 2 months of life, the pulmonary function worsened; white blood cells were 5400 cells/μl, neutrophils 4500 cells/μl and lymphocytes 600 cells/μl. Lymphocyte phenotyping revealed a profound CD3 + lymphopenia (189 cells/μl vs 3180-5401 cells/μl in pediatric healthy population [8] As reported in Table 1 , at 3.2 months of life the child showed the typical clinical presentation of SCID and several laboratory findings related to the disease, but she lacked the typical physical and radiological features of ADA-SCID. Therefore, the variable number of tandem repeat analysis revealed that 79.3% of her T lymphocytes were of maternal origin, ADA activity was 0.54 U/g Hb (healthy control range 0.8-2.5 U/g Hb), showing a presence of residual but not absent enzymatic activity [7] . Surprisingly, the values of toxic ADA metabolites were dAXP: 0,629 μmol/ml RBC (healthy control dAXP range b 0.005 μmol/ml RBC), and % dAXP: 28.5 (healthy control % dAXP b0.5). At 3,4 months of age, a diagnosis of ADA-SCID was made after DNA sequencing, performed with primers designed to amplify all ADA coding exons and the entire 7 and 8 introns [7] . Two mutations were identified in the ADA gene: p.Ser291Leu and p.Leu298Pro; the second mutation not previously described in literature. Enzyme replacement therapy with 30 U/kg twice weekly of PEG-ADA, together with 200 mg/kg twice monthly of intravenous immunoglobulins was immediately initiated after the diagnosis. After this therapy, engrafted maternal T cells of child dropped from 79.3% to 9.2%, and toxic ADA metabolites decreased (dAXP: 0.008 μmol/ml RBC, and % of dAXP: 0.429) within 5 months. Finally at 11 months of life, after the recovery from a coronavirus infection diagnosticated at 6 months, she underwent HSCT from a matched unrelated donor (MUD, 10/10 HLA-matched), since an HLAidentical family donor was not available. The patient received a reduced-intensity myeloablative conditioning [150 mg/m 2 fludarabine, 36 g/m 2 treosulfan, and anti thymocyte globulin (ATG)]. Infused cells were 14,29 × 10 6 CD34+/Kg and 69,47 × 10 6 CD3+/Kg. Platelet and neutrophil engraftments were achieved 16 and 17 days after HSCT, respectively. A complete donor chimerism was detected in lymphocytes and polymorphonucleated cells 20 days after HSCT. Lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens normalized after 5.1 months post HSCT (PHA: 51.5 × 10 3 cpm, anti-CD3 MoAb 320.6 × 10 3 cpm, and anti-CD3 MoAb plus IL-2: 251.5 × 10 3 cpm), while, due to the use of ATG as part of the conditioning, full immunological reconstitution was achieved by 9.6 months post HSCT (CD3+: 1403 cells/μl, CD3 + CD4+: 864 cells/ μl, CD3 + CD8+: 424 cells/μl, CD19+: 381 cells/μl, and NK 61 cells/μl). Now the child is 26 months old; she is in good health, and without signs of GvHD.
