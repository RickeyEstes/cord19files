The number of sampled cats (i.e., 2,659) enrolled from northern (n = 1,543), central (n = 471) and southern (n = 645) Italy exceeded the minimum sample size (i.e., 457, 385 and 246 samples from northern, central and southern Italy, respectively). Owned cats enrolled in the study (i.e., n = 1,302 males and n = 1,357 females) aged from 1 month to 21.3 years (mean 8.3 years, median 9 years). Of these, 359 (13.5%) were less than 18 months old (G1), 599 (22.5%) between 18 months and 6 years old (G2) and 1,701 (64%) elder than 6 years (G3). Most of the animals were common European breed (n = 2,329, 87.6%) and neutered (n = 2,275, 85.5%) ( Table 1 ). The prevalence of L. infantum infection by serology and/or molecular test in association with age, sex, breed, neutering status and cat origin is reported in Table 1 . Overall, 104 (3.9%) cats were positive to L. infantum by IFAT (88/2,659, 3.3%) and/or by qPCR (22/2,659, 0.8%) with statistically significant (McNemar test p<0.0001) difference and poor concordance between the techniques, K = 0.097 (95% CI: 0.0176-0.1766). Out of these 104 positive cats, 6 (5.8%) were positive to both qPCR and IFAT with IgG titres of 1:80 (n = 3), 1:640 (n = 2) and 1:5120 (n = 1). Out of the 22 PCR positive cats, 16 (72.7%) were seronegative. Of the seropositive cats, 84.1% (74/88) had an antibody titre of 1:80, whereas in the remaining the titres varied from 1:160 to 1:5120 (Table 1 ). The prevalence of positive cats detected by serological and/or molecular tests in the different geographic areas was 10.5% (68/645) in the South, 2.3% (11/ 471) in the Centre and 1.6% (25/1543) in the North of Italy. The results of the univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses are shown in Table 2 . The risk of L. infantum infection in cats, in the multivariate model (i.e., accounting for sex and age class) was significantly associated with the geographical areas (p<0.0001). In particular, cats living in the South of Italy were related to higher risk of L. infantum infection than those in the North by the univariate (OR = 7.14; 95% CI: 4.48-11.49) and multivariate analysis (OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.59-4.44), and those in the Centre by the univariate analysis (OR = 4.93; 95% CI: 2.58-9.43). Animals positive to L. infantum (n = 104; 3.9%) aged from 6 months to 20.1 years old (mean 7.5 years, standard deviation 5 years), while negative cats aged from 1 month to 21.3 years (mean 8.4 years, standard deviation 5.4 years) old with no statistically significant difference between the two groups (t = 1.795, p = 0.0728). For cats in G2 (i.e., 19 months to 6 years old) a higher L. infantum prevalence (5.7%, 34/599) (χ 2 = 6.806; p = 0.0333) was recorded. The multivariate regression analysis showed that these G2 cats were related to a higher risk of L. infantum infection than those in G1 (i.e., �18 months) (OR = 3.69; 95% CI: 1.65-8.27). The neutering status was a statistically significant factor associated with positivity to L. infantum. In particular, the risk of not neutered compared to neutered cats was OR = 1.76 (95% CI: 1.06-2.93) and statistically significant (p = 0.028). No statistical At the GIS analysis, the highest number of cats (i.e., >100 cats) was sampled in 8 out of 83 provinces examined in the study area (i.e., n = 4 in the North, n = 1 in the Centre and n = 3 in the South of Italy). The geographical analysis identified the presence of three areas with a significant higher proportion of L. infantum seropositive cats, located in three provinces of southern Italy (i.e., 13.5% in Bari, 11.4% in Messina and 6.4% in Lecce; Chi-square test for linear trend = 23.4224, df = 1, p = <0.0001) (Fig 1) . In two of these three provinces (i.e., Messina and Lecce) a higher proportion of qPCR positive samples (3.8% and 1.6%, respectively) was also recorded (Fig 1) .
