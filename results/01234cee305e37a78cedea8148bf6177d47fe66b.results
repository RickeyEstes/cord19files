Experimental MERS-CoV infection of dromedaries leads to high virus load in nasal turbinates and trachea accompanied by necro-suppurative inflammation at day 4 post infection. Evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained sections taken from respiratory epithelium of the nasal turbinates of mock-vaccinated animals at 4 days post infection (dpi) revealed mild to moderate, segmental hyperplasia of the epithelium. Moderate exocytosis of neutrophilic granulocytes, apoptosis and single cell necrosis of epithelial cells were observed within all layers of the epithelium and frequently accompanied by formation of small cavities in the apical epithelium (Fig. 1A) . Additionally, a partial loss of apical epithelial cells (erosion) was occasionally present within certain areas with marked inflammation (Fig. 1B) . The epithelial surface was covered multifocally by large amounts of mucus, as well as viable and degenerated neutrophilic granulocytes and cellular debris. Lamina propria and submucosa displayed mild to moderate edema and infiltration of moderate numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages as well as single neutrophilic granulocytes, which were predominantly located next to blood vessels. Histology of trachea and bronchi revealed only mild lesions which were characterized by mild exocytosis of neutrophilic granulocytes and mild, segmental infiltration of lamina propria and submucosa by lymphocytes, macrophages, and low numbers of neutrophilic granulocytes (Fig. 1C,D) . Rarely epithelial erosion and accumulations of degenerated neutrophilic granulocytes within the apical epithelial layers (pustules) of the trachea were detected. The MVA-S-vaccinated animals showed similar but less severe lesions at 4 dpi in nasal turbinates, trachea, and bronchi which were rarely accompanied by degeneration, loss, and necrosis of single epithelial cells in the nasal turbinates. At 14 dpi, very mild lesions were detectable in nasal turbinates, trachea, and bronchi of all investigated animals (MVA-S-vaccinated and mock-vaccinated) characterized by mild, multifocal, lymphoplasmahistiocytic and neutrophilic infiltration of lamina propria and submucosa and rare exocytosis of neutrophilic granulocytes (data not shown). Rarely, follicular aggregates of lymphoid cells were detectable in the lamina propria and submucosa of nasal turbinates and trachea in both groups and at all investigated time points. Within pulmonary, tracheal and cervical lymph nodes as well as within tonsils mild to moderate follicular hyperplasia and single apoptotic lymphocytes were present. All other non-respiratory organs and the lungs did not show any significant lesions. In line with these observations, high amounts of MERS-CoV antigen were detected within the respiratory epithelium of the nasal turbinates of mock-vaccinated dromedaries at 4 dpi by immunohistochemistry in areas SciEntiFic REpORTS | (2018) 8:9778 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-28109-2 with most severe lesions ( Fig. 2A) . Rarely, MERS-CoV antigen was also present within single round cells located in the submucosa of the nasal turbinates, which were presumed to represent macrophages based on histological characteristics ( Fig. 2A, insert) . In addition, single positive cells were detected in the epithelium of the trachea in both mock-vaccinated animals and in the epithelium of a large bronchus of one mock-vaccinated animal at 4 dpi. In MVA-S-vaccinated animals low numbers of positive staining cells were present in the epithelium of the nasal turbinates at 4 dpi. No virus was detectable in trachea and bronchi of these dromedaries. At 14 dpi, virus antigen was not detectable in the upper respiratory tract of MVA-S-vaccinated animals but very rarely within the nose of mock-vaccinated animals (Fig. 2B ,C). All these findings are in line with previous studies by the co-authors 22 and other investigators 21 .
