hMPV was present in 9/56 samples (16.1%). Sequence analysis of positive PCR products and comparison with the published sequences (van den Peret et al., 2002) , confirmed the identity of the amplicons. RSV was the predominant pathogen in this cohort, found in 38/56 samples (67.9%), followed by human rhinovirus (eight cases: 14.3%), adenoviruses (four cases), coronavirus (three cases) and parainfluenza virus (one case). In 16 patients, two viruses were simultaneously present, while no pathogen was identified in nine cases. PCRs performed in NPWs of healthy control children obtained during the same period, were all negative for hMPV. Among the hMPV positive samples, the virus was a unique pathogen in five cases (55.6%), while in four it was present together with RSV. No double positive cases of hMPV with other respiratory viruses were observed. Most hMPV cases appeared in February and persisted, though gradually diminishing, until April (Fig. 1) . The RSV season on that year was between December and March. There were no differences in disease characteristics between bronchiolitis cases were hMPV was identified and those caused by RSV or other pathogens (Table 1) . There was also no difference in disease severity between double positive RSV-hMPV cases and single positive hMPV (severity index: 8.3±0.6 versus 8.4±0.6, respectively). Similarly, no differences were found when components of the severity index (heart rate, respiratory rate, degree of wheezing, skin colour and oxygen saturation) were analyzed individually, or in laboratory findings (data not shown). Unless otherwise indicated data are presented as number of positive/number of reported (%). a Severity score was calculated by adding individual scores (1-3) for cardiac rate (<120, 120-160, >160), respiratory rate (<40, 40-60, >60), wheezing (expiratory, expiratory + inspiratory, audible without auscultation), skin color/feeding (normal, mild cyanosis/difficult feeding, cyanosis/feeding not possible) and SaO 2 (>98%, 94-98%, <94%). The severity score ranges from 3-15.
