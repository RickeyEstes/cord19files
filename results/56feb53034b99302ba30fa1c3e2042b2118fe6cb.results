Serum profiling experiments of pre-characterized sera in microarray format 9 out of 15 HEV proteins (60%) could be detected in bacterial lysates and purification of all 9 N-terminally Histagged proteins was verified by western blot analysis using monoclonal mouse anti RGS-His antibody, namely: Met, Y, V, X, Hel, O3N, O3C, O3, O2C ( Figure 3 ). In microarray format the proteins Y, V, X, Hel, O3N, O3C, O3, O2C differentiated significantly between IgG positive and negative sera (p < 0.05) ( Figure 1 ). Met, Y, V, X, O3N, O3C, O3, O2C significantly discriminated between sera of IgM positive patients and negative control patients (p < 0.05).
