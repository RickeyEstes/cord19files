The change in infectious titer of TGEV and MHV in reagentgrade water over 49 days at 25 C and 4 C is summarized in Fig. 1a and b. There was a progressive decline in the infectivity of both TGEV and MHV over 49 days at 25 C, and this reduction follows typical first-order kinetics (Fig. 1a) . The infectivity of TGEV declined by approximately 0.6 log 10 per week, and infectious MHV declined by approximately 0.8 log 10 per week. Time required for 99% reduction in infectious titer in reagentgrade water at 25 C was 22 days for TGEV and 17 days for MHV. There was no significant decline in infectious titer of either virus over 49 days at 4 C (Fig. 1b) . Fig. 2a and b shows the infectious TGEV and MHV titers in lake water over 14 days at 25 C and 4 C. Time required for 99% reduction in infectious titer in lake water at 25 C was 13 days for TGEV and 10 days for MHV. At 4 C, TGEV infectivity declined by approximately 1 log 10 by day 14; in contrast, MHV infectivity persisted with no decline in titer after 14 days at 4 C. Because there were only two time points (7 and 14 days), regression analysis was not performed on data from lake water. The change in infectious titer of TGEV and MHV in pasteurized settled sewage (pH 7.6, turbidity 17.6 NTU) over 35 days at 25 C and 4 C is summarized in Fig. 3a and b. There was a progressive decline in the infectivity of both TGEV and MHV at 25 C. The reduction in infectivity of both viruses at 25 C follows typical first-order kinetics (Fig. 3a) . There was a more rapid decline in infectivity titer of both viruses at 25 C than at 4 C (the experiment at 25 C was terminated at day 21 due to subsequent growth of contaminating microorganisms in the test water). Regression analysis showed that infectivity of TGEV at 25 C declined by approximately 1.5 log 10 per week, and that of MHV declined by approximately 2 log 10 per week. Times for 99% reduction in infectious titer were 9 days for TGEV and 7 days for MHV. Both viruses exhibited a similar slow rate of decline in infectivity in settled sewage at 4 C, with 1.3 log 10 reduction of MHV and 2 log 10 reduction of TGEV after 35 days (Fig. 3b) . Regression analysis showed that TGEV declined by approximately 0.3 log 10 per week, and MHV by 0.2 log 10 per week at 4 C. Regression analysis on data from reagent-grade water and pasteurized settled sewage was compared to determine if water quality has an effect on virus survival. Table 1 shows the predicted values obtained by regression analysis to achieve 90%, 99%, 99.9%, and 99.99% reduction of TGEV and MHV in each water type. The time required for 4 log 10 (99.99%) infectivity reduction of TGEV at 25 C is longer in reagent-grade water than in pasteurized settled sewage (44 days vs. 19 days). This is also true for MHV (35 days in reagent-grade water vs. 14 days in sewage). There is also a difference in predicted inactivation times between viruses. In both water types, the predicted time to achieve a 4 log 10 reduction in viral infectivity titer at 25 C is longer for TGEV than for MHV (44 days vs. 35 days in reagentgrade water and 19 days vs. 14 days in pasteurized settled sewage). At 4 C, the time required to achieve a 4 log 10 reduction in infectivity titer in pasteurized settled sewage was 98 days for TGEV vs. 139 days for MHV, and predicted times for 4 log 10 infectivity reduction of both viruses in reagent-grade water were approximately 1 year. Because viral titer declined so slowly at 4 C, regression analysis based on this data set (where the longest elapsed time was 49 days) may not be a reliable way to predict viral reduction over long periods at this temperature. Analysis was also done using a linear regression model with variables for virus type, water type, temperature, and incubation time. Virus type (TGEV or MHV), water type (reagent-grade water or pasteurized settled sewage) and temperature (4 C or 25 C) were dichotomous variables, and incubation time was a continuous variable. Water type ( p ¼ 0.0071), incubation time ( p < 0.0001) and temperature ( p < 0.0001) were significant predictors of log 10 viral reduction. Virus type was not a significant predictor ( p ¼ 0.28). Inclusion of an interaction variable for water type and temperature did not show significant interaction between these parameters ( p ¼ 0.47).
