From January 1996 to December 2003, 57,060 specimens were tested for influenza virus, and 51,370 were tested for RSV. The volume of tests performed was noticeably lower in the first 2 years and in the last year of the study (Table 1) Table 2 ). The Figure shows the temporal trends for death outcomes as well as influenza virus and RSV activities. Peaks in monthly influenza A viruses corresponded very well with peaks in monthly all-cause deaths, underlying P&I deaths, and underlying C&R deaths. We tested the Spearman rank correlations between influenza and RSV, and meteorologic variables. Influenza A positivity (Spearman correlation [r] = 0.25) was weakly correlated with relative humidity. However, temperature (r = -0.71) was highly correlated with relative humidity. The influenza A (H3N2) subtype had a high correlation with influenza A (r = 0.75) (data not shown). The relationship between deaths and each respiratory virus (influenza A, influenza B, and RSV) was examined by using a stepwise sequential approach (Table 3) , i.e., first fitting each of the viruses into separate models (models 1-3), then adjusting for 1 of the other 2 viruses (models 4, 5), and finally, adjusting for all viruses in a single model (model 6). Furthermore, potential confounding factors were adjusted for and included in each model. Influenza A had significant and robust effects on monthly all-cause deaths (RR 1.05 for each 10% change in positive test results, without adjusting for influenza B virus, RSV, and other potential confounding factors; vs. RR 1.05, after adjusting for influenza B, RSV, and other confounding factors), underlying P&I (RR 1.12 vs. RR 1.13), and underlying C&R (1.08 vs. 1.09) deaths. In Table 4 , we used model 6 (as described in Table 3 ) to further explore the association between influenza A virus subtypes and the 3 death outcomes. We replaced influenza A variable with influenza A subtypes and adjusted for influenza B virus, RSV, and other confounding factors. 588 influenza-associated deaths (Table 5) , representing 3.8% of total deaths. The mean annual estimates of deaths from underlying P&I and C&R associated with influenza were 116 and 475, respectively, representing 6.5% and 5.8% of such deaths. We observed that the proportion of influenza-associated deaths was higher among the elderly. The annual influenza-associated proportion of deaths from all causes was 11.3 times higher in persons age >65 years (167.8/100,000 person-years) than in the general population (14.8/100,000). For influenza-associated underlying P&I deaths, the annual death rate in those >65 years (46.9/100,000) was 16.2 times higher than those in the general population (2.9/100,000) ( Table 5) . Table 6 compares the excess deaths observed in our study with that derived from studies in a subtropical and temperate country (6,7). While we observed a smaller overall impact for all ages than that reported in Hong Kong (6) and the United States (7), we noted a higher proportion of influenza-associated deaths among the elderly in Singapore.
