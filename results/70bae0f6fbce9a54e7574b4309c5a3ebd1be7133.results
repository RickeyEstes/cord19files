Purification of active and inactive CVCP. After autoproteolysis and the release of CP from structural polyprotein, Trp261 remains bound near the active site and makes the protein further inactive for either cis or trans proteolytic action. However, previous studies on alphavirus CP indicate that the activity of CP is restored on removal of the conserved C-terminal tryptophan residue 38, 39 . So, in order to evaluate the enzymatic activity of CVCP, both inactive and active proteins were expressed and purified. Firstly, the protease domain of CVCP was cloned into pET28c vector to form the expression plasmid pET28c-CVCP. The inactive protein contains the full protease domain (106-261 residues). Truncation of the last two residues including C-terminal Trp261 from the inactive construct results in generation of the active form of CVCP (106-259 residues). The optimization of expression conditions was done for both the proteins to get good amount of soluble protein. After optimization of induction temperature, induction time and IPTG concentration, both the proteins having the 6X-His tag at the N-terminus were expressed in the soluble form. The soluble proteins were purified by IMAC (immobilized metal assisted chromatography) and size exclusion chromatography. In Ni-NTA column chromatography, the protein was eluted by increasing concentration of imidazole. A single band was observed on SDS-PAGE for both the purified proteins confirming the protein homogeneity (Fig. 2) . The protein band was visible at ~17 kDa on SDS-PAGE which was also confirmed by gel filtration chromatography by comparing and calculating the molecular weight using standard molecular weight markers. Thus, it is confirmed that both active and inactive CVCP exist as monomer in solution. In vitro trans-protease assay of CVCP. A highly sensitive FRET based assay was used for determining the trans-proteolytic activity of CVCP. The in vitro trans-protease activity of CVCP was monitored using the peptide substrate containing 4-(4-dimethylaminophenyl-azo)benzoic acid (DABCYL) and 5-[(2-aminoethyl)amino]naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid (EDANS) at the N-and C-terminus of the peptide respectively. This pair demonstrates FRET in which EDANS acts as fluorophore and DABCYL as quencher that quenches the fluorescence produced by EDANS. In the presence of protease, the peptide gets cleaved, which separates the two fragments and reduces the FRET signal. The active CVCP exhibits the efficient cleavage of the substrate peptide, which separates EDANS (fluorophore) and DABCYL (quencher) resulting in the increased fluorescence signal. The fluorescence was quenched before the proteolytic cleavage due to the presence of DABCYL within a particular distance range from the fluorophore EDANS (Fig. 3A) . The proteolytic reaction was carried out in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) in cuvette (1 ml reaction volume) as well as in 96-well plate (100 μ l reaction volume). The substrate was added to start the reaction and the fluorescence enhancement was recorded with time (Fig. 3B) . The relative fluorescence units were calculated for all the readings. Figure 3B shows the typical fluorescence profile for the hydrolysis of the substrate. A control reaction was also performed using the same reaction without enzyme, which did not show change in the fluorescence intensity (data not shown). Determination of kinetic parameters. For the calculation of kinetic parameters, Vi of the enzyme at different substrate concentrations was determined (Fig. 3C ). All the values were normalized by subtracting the readings obtained with the same reaction having no enzyme. The fluorescence extinction coefficient (FEC) was calculated to be 35,215 RFU/μ M for the FRET substrate. This FEC value was used to determine the amount of the product formation in each reaction. The kinetic parameters K m and k cat /K m were calculated as 1.26 ± 0.34 μ M and 1.11 × 10 3 M −1 sec −1 respectively (Fig. 3D ). The inactive CVCP was used as a negative control in proteolytic activity assay and as expected, it showed insignificant increase in the fluorescence signal (data not shown).
