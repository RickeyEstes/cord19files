To test the performances and functionality of CROSS combined with DTW ( Supplementary Figures 1 and 2) , we selected a dataset of 22 structures for which crystallographic (exact base pairing between nucleotides) and Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE; chemical probing of flexible regions used to assess whether a nucleotide is in double-or single-stranded state) data are available [12] . Using DTW, we calculated the structural distances between all possible pairs in the dataset considering crystallographic (dots and parentheses were transformed into binary code) data as well as 1) SHAPE profiles ( [20] . We then selected the D2 domain of HOTAIR to measure its conservation in 10 species [21] using CROSSalign (Supplementary Figure 9A) . As for XIST, the structural distance analysis indicates that primates cluster close to human, and other species are more distant (Supplementary Figure 9B) . Orangutan D2 was then searched for within all human lncRNAs, and HOTAIR was identified as the best match (structural distance 0.032; p-value < 10 -6 ) with overlapping coordinates (nucleotides: 666-1191; 78% overlap with the query region; Figure 6A ). Searching for mouse D2 within all human lncRNAs, HOTAIR was found as the best (0.092; p-value < 10 -4 ) and matching position (nucleotides: 284-788; 57% overlap; Figure 6B ). These results suggest that D2 secondary structure is not only conserved in primates but also in mouse. To further investigate the secondary structure of HOTAIR, we studied the structural conservation of the D4 domain (Supplementary Figure 10) . As opposed to D2, D4 is predicted by CROSS to be poorly structured ( Figure 5B ). Searching for orangutan D4 within all human lncRNAs yields HOTAIR as the best match (structural distance 0.023; p-value < 10 -6 ) and the reported sequence position shows a sizeable overlap with the D4 domain in human HOTAIR (predicted coordinates: 1650-2291; overlap of 79%; Figure   7A ). By contrast, when searching for mouse D4 within all human lncRNAs, HOTAIR shows poor ranking (1849 th ; structural distance 0.104; p-value = 0.061), which indicates little structural homology between human and mouse ( Figure Table 3) to identify structurally similar domains. We found that coronavirus HKU and Simian-Human immunodeficiency SIV have the most significant matches with HIV (structural distance 0.078, p-value < 10 -6 for SIV; structural distance 0.093, p-value < 10 -4 for HKU). This finding is particularly relevant since SIV and HIV share many similarities in terms of pathogenicity and evolution [29] . Indeed, previous studies already reported a similarity in terms of secondary structure between HIV and SIV that is not explained by sequence similarity [30] . In addition, we found that the HIV 5' region is structurally similar to a strain of Ebola Figure 8A ). This result indicates that the secondary structure of this region is not only necessary for HIV encapsidation [32] , but is also essential for the activity of other viruses. We also compared structural distances and sequence similarities of all HIV strains (4804; see Materials and Methods). We found two clusters (brown and red; Figure   8B ) that are similar in terms of structure (~0.06 structural distance; p-value < 10 -6 ) and sequence (80%-95% sequence similarity). Other clusters (red and green; Figure 8B ) showed significant distance in structure (from 0.06 to 0.09 of structural distance; pvalue < 10 -6 ) that is not identifiable by sequence similarity (~85% sequence similarity). This result suggests that HIV could have evolved maintaining a similar sequence but different structures, as previously reported in literature [30] . author/funder. All rights reserved.
