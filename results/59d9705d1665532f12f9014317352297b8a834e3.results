During the study period, there were 183 ARI in 127 residents: 137 during the viral respiratory season and 46 during the non-respiratory viral season. Of the 183 ARI, 33 were due to a laboratory-confirmed pathogen including 13 rhino/enterovirus, 9 human metapneumovirus, 3 parainfluenza, 3 coronavirus, 3 influenza, 1 RSV, and 1 adenovirus. Of the 3 confirmed cases of influenza, 2 were cases of influenza A and 1 was a case of influenza B. All cases of influenza occurred during the respiratory viral season. Sixty-three infections had diagnostic testing that was negative and 87 infections were clinically diagnosed only. The costs associated with the respiratory viral season and the non-respiratory viral season are summarized in the Table 1 . The respiratory viral season was significantly more expensive than the non-respiratory viral season (total costs: $31 224 and $3242 respectively, P < 0Á001).
