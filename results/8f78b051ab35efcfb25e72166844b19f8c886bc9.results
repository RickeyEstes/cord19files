A total of 151 specimens were examined in this study, originating from 103 cases in dogs (n = 94) and cats (n = 9), among which there were 5 abortions (4.8%), 3 stillbirths (2.9%), 24 cases of early neonatal mortality (23.3%), 18 cases of late neonatal mortality (17.5%), and 53 cases in which no age was recorded (51.4%). All the samples tested were negative for Leptospira and C. burnetii DNAs. Detection limits of the Leptospira spp. PCR assay were 0.05 ng/ mL in the first cycle and 0.5 pg/ mL in the nested cycle. The nested protocol increased the sensitivity of the test 100 times. Considering that the genome of a single Leptospira, corresponding to 4.3 £ 10 6 bp in L. interrogans and 3.6 £ 10 6 bp in L. biflexa, weights 5-10 fg, the protocol was able to detect 50-100 bacteria/mL. All the tested Leptospira strains used as controls were positive, whereas no amplification was obtained from bacteria other than Leptospira spp. or bovine and caprine faeces, confirming the specificity of the test. Although not systematically investigated, in 49 cases (47.6%) other likely causes of abortion and neonatal mortality were identified. Overall, CHV-1 was detected in 7.8% cases (6/77), and one of these showed a simultaneous coinfection with a beta-haemolytic strain of E. coli. FHV-1 was detected in 11% (1/9) and FPV in 9% (1/11) of the cases. Bacteriological examination was performed in 62 cases, 38 (61.3%) of which were positive. In particular, E. coli (20/
