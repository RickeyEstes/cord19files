Generation of rIBVs expressing S genes with chimeric subunits. Recombinant IBVs expressing chimeric S proteins composed of either the S1 subunit derived from M41-CK and the S2 subunit from CK cell-adapted strain Beaudette (Beaudette CK), BeauR-M41(S1), or the S1 subunit from Beaudette CK and the S2 subunit from M41-CK, BeauR-M41(S2), were produced ( Fig. 1) to determine which subunit of the S glycoprotein was responsible for the extended tropism of Beaudette CK for Vero cells. Sequence analysis following rescue of the rIBVs identified the presence of three nucleotide substitutions in BeauR-M41(S1) passaged three times (P 3 ) on CK cells [BeauR-M41(S1) P 3 -CK] at positions 22239 to 22241, GTT to AAC, corresponding to two adjacent codons, amino acids L 624 and F 625 , resulting in 1 amino acid substitution, F 625 T, within the Beaudette S2 subunit (Table 1) . One nucleotide substitution, C 23378 T, was identified in BeauR-M41(S2) P 3 -CK, resulting in amino acid substitution A 452 T within the Beaudette S1 subunit. These substitutions could have arisen during rescue or passage of the virus on CK cells as they were not present in the parental recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV). Expression of chimeric S genes does not alter growth on primary chicken cells. Analysis of the growth kinetics of the rIBVs BeauR-M41(S1) P 3 -CK and BeauR-M41(S2) P 3 -CK in primary chick kidney (CK) cells identified peak titers equivalent to those of the parental viruses, Beau-R, M41-CK, and BeauR-M41(S), at 48 h postinfection. Interestingly, the growth of the rIBVs was initially slower over the first 24 h ( Fig. 2A) . Immunofluorescence analysis of IBV-infected CK cells showed that the rIBVs were able to infect and spread to neighboring cells, as observed for the parental viruses (data not shown). The S2 subunit of Beaudette is responsible for Vero cell tropism. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Vero cells could be infected with Beau-R or BeauR-M41(S1) P 3 -CK ( Fig. 2D and G) . However, only a small number of individual Vero cells were infected with M41-CK or BeauR-M41(S) (Fig. 2E and F) , confirming previous results that infectious progeny virus does not infect neighboring cells and that there is no virus spread (74) , indicating that progeny virus either is not released from infected Vero cells or is not infectious. Although the rIBV BeauR-M41(S2) P 3 -CK formed infectious centers on CK cells, the rIBV had a phenotype on Vero cells similar to that observed with M41-CK and BeauR-M41(S) (Fig. 2H) . Analysis of the growth kinetics of the rIBVs on Vero cells confirmed the findings of the immunofluorescence studies. BeauR-M41(S1) P 3 -CK demonstrated growth similar to that of Beau-R in Vero cells, albeit with a lower peak titer (Fig. 2B ). M41-CK, BeauR-M41(S), and BeauR-M41(S2) P 3 -CK did not reach titers greater than 1.5 log 10 PFU/ml in Vero cells. Our results show that BeauR-M41(S1) P 3 -CK and Beau-R produce infectious progeny in both CK and Vero cells, whereas the tropism of BeauR-M41(S2) P 3 -CK resembled that of M41-CK and BeauR-M41(S) for growth in Vero cells. Overall, replacement of the Beaudette S1 subunit with the corresponding S1 sequence from M41-CK did not affect the ability of the rIBV to replicate and produce progeny virus in Vero cells. In contrast, replacement of the Beaudette S2 subunit with the M41 S2 sequence resulted in loss of the ability of Beau-R to grow in Vero cells. The ability of Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S1) P3-CK to grow on Vero cells resides within the Beaudette S2 subunit and not within the S1 subunit, known to contain the RBD. Adaptation of rIBVs to growth on Vero cells. The P 3 -CK rIBVs were passaged three times on Vero cells (P 3 -Vero rIBVs) to determine whether virus replication could be maintained by passage on this mammalian cell line. Passage of BeauR-M41(S1) resulted in a cytopathic effect (CPE) from 24 h postinfection, whereas passage of BeauR-M41(S2) did not result in an observable CPE. Additional passages of the rIBV BeauR-M41(S1) resulted in syncytium formation from P 5 , indicating that the virus, as previously observed for Beaudette, had become adapted for growth on Vero cells (data not shown). Analysis of the growth kinetics of BeauR-M41(S1) P 3 -CK passaged on Vero cells showed an increase in titer following passage to within 1 log 10 of the titers observed for Beau-R. Overall, the growth of the P 7 -Vero isolate matched the growth kinetics observed for Beau-R (Fig. 3) . Sequence analysis of the S gene from BeauR-M41(S1) P 7 -Vero identified one nucleotide difference, located within the S2 subunit, from the parental viruses, Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S). The substitution occurred at nucleotide position C 23378 T, resulting in an amino acid change of T 1004 I (Table 1 ). This change may contribute to the further adaptation of BeauR-M41(S1) for growth in Vero cells and may be involved in syncytium formation. Generation of rIBVs with modified Beaudette S2 subunit-specific motifs. Once it was established that the S2 subunit is responsible for the extended tropism of Beaudette in Vero cells, the amino acid sequence of Beaudette S2 was compared to the S2 amino acid sequences in other IBV strains to identify potential amino acids, unique to the Beaudette S2, which may play a role in the tropism for growth in Vero cells. The positions of the amino acid differences between Beaudette, M41, and two pathogenic field strains of IBV, QX and 4/91, are shown in Fig. 1B . A Beaudette-specific motif (BSM), 686 SRRKRSLIE 694 , was identified in the Beaudette S2 sequence surrounding the S2= cleavage site at arginine residue 690 and was not found in the S glycoprotein of any other IBV strain; the Beaudette-specific amino acids within the BSM are underlined. In order to determine whether this motif plays a role in the Vero cell tropism of IBV  The S2 Subunit Determines IBV Tropism Journal of Virology Beaudette, two full-length IBV cDNAs were generated: BeauR-S-MM, which has the Beau-R genomic background (75) in which the BSM in the S2 subunit was replaced with nucleotides encoding the corresponding M41 motif (MM) sequence, 686 SPRRRSFIE 694 (Fig. 1B) , and BeauR-M41-S-BSM, which was based on BeauR-M41(S) (74) , in which the MM in the M41 S2 subunit was replaced with the BSM (Fig. 1B) . Following rescue and growth in CK cells, sequence analysis identified the presence of one nucleotide substitution in BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 3 -CK, A 22226 C, resulting in the amino acid substitution D 620 A in the S2 subunit (Table 1) , which could have arisen during rescue or passage of the virus on CK cells, as the substitution was not present in the rVV. No mutations were identified in the BeauR-S-MM P 3 -CK S gene. Analysis of the growth kinetics of BeauR-S-MM P 3 -CK and BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 3 -CK in CK cells showed that they displayed peak titers equivalent to those of the parental viruses, Beau-R, M41-CK, and BeauR-M41(S), at 48 h postinfection, although the growth of BeauR-M41-S-BSM was slower over the first 24 h (Fig. 4A ). Immunofluorescence analysis of infected CK cells confirmed that both viruses were able to infect neighboring cells (data not shown). The Beaudette-specific motif in the S2 subunit is sufficient to confer the tropism for growth in Vero cells. Immunofluorescence analysis of infected Vero cells infected with BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 3 -CK (Fig. 4B ) demonstrated that the introduction of the BSM into the M41 S glycoprotein resulted in the ability of an rIBV expressing the modified M41 S glycoprotein to grow on Vero cells. Conversely, rIBV BeauR-S-MM P 3 -CK, in which only the BSM in the Beaudette S2 subunit was replaced with the corresponding MM sequence from M41, lost its ability to grow in Vero cells (Fig. 4C) , with a growth phenotype being observed for M41 and BeauR-M41(S). This observation was confirmed by analysis of the growth kinetics of the rIBVs in Vero cells (Fig. 4D) . Production of progeny BeauR-S-MM P 3 -CK virus from Vero cells was undetectable. Although BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 3 -CK produced progeny virus in Vero cells, the growth was considerably lower than that observed for Beau-R. Progeny BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 3 -CK virus was observed only from 24 h postinfection and reached a peak titer at 72 h postinfection that was about 6 log 10 lower than that of Beau-R. These results show that the loss of the BSM abolished the ability of Beau-R to grow on Vero cells and that the accruement of the BSM resulted in the ability of an rIBV expressing the M41 S to have a tropism for growth on Vero cells, albeit to a lesser extent than replacement with the entire Beaudette S2. Overall, it appeared that either a complete Beaudette S2 subunit or other additional Beaudette S2-specific amino acids may be required for the growth characteristics observed with the complete Beaudette S2. The P 3 -CK viruses BeauR-M41-S-BSM and BeauR-S-MM were passaged on Vero cells to determine whether virus replication could be maintained. BeauR-S-MM isolates were unable to maintain replication on Vero cells for three passages, as assessed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The isolates caused no CPE, and no infected cells were observed on either CK or Vero cells (data not shown). The rIBV BeauR-M41-S-BSM isolates were successfully passaged on Vero cells, and the growth kinetics of one of the BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 7 -Vero passaged isolates were analyzed. The virus had a growth pattern very similar, within 1 log 10 , to the growth pattern of Beau-R on Vero cells (Fig.  5) . No additional mutations were identified in the BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 7 -Vero S gene, other than the nucleotide substitution identified at P 3 -CK, A 22226 C, resulting in the amino acid substitution D 620 A in the S2 subunit. The genetic stability of BeauR-M41-S-BSM observed over seven passages on Vero cells indicates that the spike glycoprotein is not under pressure to mutate under these conditions. Generation of rIBVs with additional Beaudette-specific amino acid modifications within the M41-CK S2 subunit. Once it was established that the BSM within the S2 subunit is able to confer the extended tropism of IBV in cell culture, other Beaudettespecific amino acids, identified in the Beaudette S2 subunit in comparison to other IBV S2 sequences (Fig. 1B) , were introduced into the M41-CK S2 subunit, in addition to the BSM. In order to determine the specific amino acids and minimum number of amino acid changes required to fully confer tropism, full-length IBV cDNAs with various combinations of the Beaudette-specific amino acids in the S2 subunit of M41 based on the BeauR-M41-S-BSM genomic background were generated; L 578 F and N 617 S were introduced by pGPT-M41-S2-L 578 F-N 617 S, and N 826 S, L 857 F, and I 1000 V were introduced by pGPT-M41-S2-N 826 S-L 857 F-I 1000 V. Following homologous recombination into the IBV (Table 1) , which could have arisen during rescue or passage of the virus on CK cells, as the substitutions were not present in the rVV. Analysis of the growth kinetics of the rIBVs with the modified M41 S2 subunit on CK cells showed that most of the viruses, apart from BeauR-M41-S-BSM-L 578 F-N 617 S-N 826 S-L 857 F-I 1000 V, had growth patterns that were representative of the rIBV BeauR-M41(S) growth pattern, in that they produced less progeny virus than Beau-R in the first 24 h postinfection but had titers that reached or exceeded the titer of Beau-R over the next 48 h postinfection (Fig. 6A) . Interestingly, rIBV BeauR-M41-S-BSM-L 578 F-N 617 S-N 826 S-L 857 F-I 1000 V had a growth pattern similar to that of Beau-R, in that it had a peak titer at 24 postinfection which decreased over the 48 h postinfection, and the peak titer was about 1.2 log 10 less than that of Beau-R at 24 h postinfection. All the rIBVs had a similar growth pattern in CK cells by immunofluorescence analysis of the infected cells (data not shown). Assessment of tropism. Analysis of the growth kinetics of the P 3 -CK rIBVs on Vero cells showed that they all grew with patterns similar to those of Beau-R, but with lower peak titers and lower titers throughout infection, whereas BeauR-M41(S), expressing the donor S protein, did not grow in Vero cells (Fig. 6B) . Interestingly, BeauR-M41-S-BSM-L 578 F-N 617 S-N 826 S-L 857 F-I 1000 V P 3 -CK, which contains the most Beaudette-specific amino acids inserted into the M41 S2 subunit, grew the most similarly to Beau-R, indicating that only 8 Beaudette-derived amino acids are required to confer the ability to grow on Vero cells with growth kinetics and a growth phenotype similar to those of Beau-R in Vero cells. The other rIBVs with modified M41-CK S2 subunits replicated to a titer similar to that of BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 3 -CK, reaching a peak titer at 72 h postinfection. Immunofluorescence analysis of infected Vero cells showed that the P 3 -CK rIBVs containing the additional Beaudette-specific modifications within the M41-CK S2 sub- The S2 Subunit Determines IBV Tropism Journal of Virology unit formed infectious centers on Vero cells (Fig. 6C to H) . At 24 h postinfection, only small foci of infected Vero cells were generated by some of these rIBVs during the initial passage on Vero cells (Fig. 6E and G) . This is reflected in the delayed growth during the first 24 h postinfection, as shown in Fig. 6B . As shown above, passage of BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 3 -CK on Vero cells improved the growth of this virus in Vero cells; therefore, the rIBVs with the additional Beaudettederived amino acids in the M41 S2 subunit were passaged on Vero cells, and the P 7 -Vero isolates were reexamined for growth on Vero cells. Analysis of the growth kinetics of the P 7 -Vero isolates on Vero cells clearly demonstrated that all the rIBVs now replicated with patterns similar to and peak titers equivalent to those observed for Beau-R (Fig. 7) . Interestingly, three of the P 7 -Vero rIBVs, BeauR-M41-S-BSM-N 617 S, BeauR-M41-S-BSM-L 578 F-N 617 S, and BeauR-M41-S-BSM-N 826 S-L 857 F-I 1000 V, had higher titers of progeny virus, almost 2 log 10 higher to 24 h postinfection, than Beau-R; at 72 h postinfection, the peak titers were similar to those of Beau-R. Sequence analysis of the S genes from the P 7 -Vero isolates identified several nucleotide substitutions that may be involved in further conferment of tropism for Vero cells (Table 1) ; BeauR-M41-S-BSM-L 857 F-I 1000 V P 7 -Vero C 22255 T results in the amino acid substitution P 630 S, BeauR-M41-S-BSM-L 578 F-N 617 S-N 826 S-L 857 F-I 1000 V P 7 -Vero G 20584 A results in the amino acid substitution G 73 S, and BeauR-M41-S-BSM-N 617 S, -L 578 F-N 617 S, and -N 826 S-L 857 F-I 1000 V P 7 -Vero were all found to have a common substitution, A 22962 C, resulting in the amino acid substitution Q 866 H in the M41 S2 subunit. BeauR-M41-S-BSM-N 826 S-L 857 F-I 1000 V P 7 -Vero had several other substitutions; G 21709 A resulted in V 448 I, and C 22342 A resulted in P 659 T and a mixed population of C 22099 T corresponding to the first engineered amino acid modification in the M41 S2 subunit L 578 F. The rIBV appears to be losing the L 857 F modification, resulting in a mixed population at C 22936 T. Interestingly, BeauR-M41-S-BSM-I 1000 V P 7 -Vero was found to gain the Beaudettespecific amino acid L 578 F, which was introduced into the M41 S2 subunit in some of the rIBVs. The rIBVs containing the Beaudette-specific motif are proteolytically cleaved at the S2= cleavage site. As the Beaudette-specific motif surrounds the S2= cleavage site, the susceptibility of rIBVs containing the BSM to proteolytic cleavage was investigated. CK cells were infected with BeauR-M41-S-BSM P 3 -CK, BeauR-S-MM P 3 -CK, or parent virus Beau-R, BeauR-M41(S), or M41-CK for 24 h and then lysed, and the proteolytic cleavage of the spike glycoprotein was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-S2 antibody (Fig. 8) . A clear S2= cleavage product was observed in the Beau-R sample, but this was absent in the BeauR-M41(S), M41-CK, and BeauR-S-MM samples, which do not contain the BSM and are unable to grow in Vero cells. A faint band corresponding to the S2= cleavage product was also observed in the BeauR-M41-S-BSM sample, indicating that proteolytic cleavage at the S2= site within the BSM may play a role in extending the host tropism of Beau-R. The faint band generated by BeauR-M41-S-BSM in comparison with that produced by Beau-R may indicate that proteolytic processing is not as efficient in the recombinant spike glycoprotein. This could be due to subtle differences in the tertiary or quaternary structures of the BeauR-M41-S-BSM spike glycoprotein resulting in steric hindrance of the protease acting at the S2= site. The size of the S2= cleavage product is smaller than expected when analyzed by Western blotting. It is possible that the band that we observed at about 30 kDa may be a breakdown product of the S2= cleavage product or that the size of the S2= cleavage product may appear to be smaller than expected due to distortion of protein coils in the gel. Nevertheless, it is important to note that this band was observed only in samples infected with rIBV containing the Beaudette-specific motif surrounding the S2= cleavage site, indicating that this is where cleavage occurs, so its production may be involved in the extended tropism of Beau-R.
