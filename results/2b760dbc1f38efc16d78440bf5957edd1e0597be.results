Comparison of computer records with paper records, and examination of negative ages, misspellings and other mismatches indicated few problems with data entry and storage. Treatment days per calf for heifer calves belonging to various subsets of farms related to the vaccine field trial are displayed in Table II . Treatment days per calf were higher for calves on farms in Part B of the trial than in those not involved in the trial, and were highest in those farms involved in Part A of the trial. This was anticipated, since farms in Part A were selected for the field trial on the basis of expected higher calf morbidity. What is noteworthy in Table II , however, is that the same general patterns of disease treatment (higher in autumn and winter than in spring or summer) held, despite differences in intensity of record keeping and/or treatment rates for diseases, for all three groups of farms. This in turn suggests that these data reflect true natural phenomena, rather than artifacts of record keeping. There was no evidence of any differences, either between years or between intensive and extensive farms, of general record-keeping diligence as measured by the technicians' scores. Overall, the mean record-keeping score was 2.3 on a scale of three. While such an average of ordinal data may have no inherent meaning, it does serve to indicate that record-keeping on these farms was thought to lean toward the good-to-better, rather than the bad-toworse categories. The relationship between farm-level policies as states in questionnaires, and practices as reflected in individual calf birthday forms, are displayed in Table III . Although there were significant differences in the recorded adoption of specified managerial practices at the calf level, between farms with differing stated management policies, these data suggest that a number of the stated policies may have been implemented at the individual calf level less than 50% of the time.
