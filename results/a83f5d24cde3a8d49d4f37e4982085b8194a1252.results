ntibodies against the Cytoplasmic Affinity-purified polyclonal (aP4) and monoclonal (P5D4) antibodies were prepared against a synthetic peptide containing the 15 carboxy-terminal amino acjds of G (Kreis, 1986) . P5D4 reacted with one epitope, containing the 5 carboxy-terminal amino acids (507-511) of 6; and aP4 reacted with all epitopes tested within the carboxyterminal cytoplasmic segment of G (Kreis, 1986) . Significant cross-reaction of the antibodies with endogenous cellular proteins was not observed. Two hours after infection (at 39.5%) with ts045VSV, Vero cells were microinjected at 0°C to 4% with (a and b) P5D4 (1 mgimi) or (c and d) P5D4-Fabs (0.8 mglml). At 4.5 hr after infection at 39.5% (for details, see Experimental Procedures), the cells were transferred into medium containing 10 uglml cycloheximide and incubated for 45 min at 31%. The distribution of the microinjected P5D4 was visualized after fixation and permeabilization by rhodamine-conjugated second antibodies (a and c). Appearance of G at the surface of the same cells was monitored, prior to permeabilization with detergent, with rabbit anti-G and fluorescein-coupled second antibodies (b and d). The same cells are viewed in a and b, and in c and d. Arrowheads point to patches of aggregated G. Bar = 20 urn. P5D4 remained homogeneously distributed following microinjection into uninfected Vero cells. When P5D4 or aP4 was microinjected into cells that contain G protein en route from the RER to the cell surface, however, both bound to all forms of VSV-G (Kreis, 1986) . Microinjected Antipeptide Antibodies Block Transport of G Protein to the Cell Surface To study the effect of the antipeptide antibodies P5D4 and aP4 on transport of G to the cell surface, Vero or PtK2 cells were microinjected at 2 hr after infection by ts045 under nonpermissive conditions. Microinjection was performed after transferring the infected cells from culture medium at 39.5% directly into Hanks buffered saline kept at O"C-4°C. The coverslips with injected cells were transferred back to culture medium at 39.5% immediately after microinjection was completed, usually within less than 10 min. G remained tightly arrested with the RER despite this P-fold shift in temperature (cf. Figures 3a and 3b ). During the subsequent 2 hr incubation at 39.5% and 30 min at 31°C, divalent P5D4 completely blocked maturation and Aggregation of Intracellular ts045-G by Microinjected Monoclonal Antipeptide Occurs Only at the Permissive Temperature in about 30% of ts045infected cells microinjected with divalent P5D4, patches of aggregated G were observed, but only if the cells were shifted to the permissive temperature for 30-45 min (arrowheads in Figure 1 , Figures 2d-2f, and Figure 3 ). We never observed patching OF aggregation of G when cells infected with ts045-VSV and microinjected with P5D4 were kept at the nonpermissive temperature, where G is retained in the RER (Figures  2a-2~) . Patching of ts045 G also occurred at 31°C, when rhodamine-coupled P5D4 was microinjected and no further labeling with second antibodies was required (data Verro cells were microinjected at 0% to 4% with P5D4 2 hr after infection (at 395°C) with ts045-VSV. Recipient cells were shifted for 45 min to 31% 4.5 hr after infection (d, e, and f) or were kept at 39.6X (a, b, and c). Microinjected P5D4 was visualized with rhodamine-coupled second antibodies (a and d), and G was monitored in the same cells after permeabilization with rabbit anti-G and fluorescein-coupled anti-rabbit antibodies (b and e). The same areas were also photographed with Nomarski optics (c and f). Arrowheads indicate patches of aggregated G. Bar = 20 Km. not shown). Similar patches as those induced by P5D4 were also detected in cells microinjected with the polyclonal antibodies aP4 (data not shown). Patching of G was never observed in cells microinjected with Fab fragments of P5D4 or aP4 (data not shown). Patching of G was observed in various VSV-infected tissue culture cells, including Vero cells (Figures l-3), PtKs cells (data not shown), and BHK cells (Arnheiter et al., 1984) and thus, seemed not to be a cell-specific phenomenon. Patching proceeded only when ts045infected cells were shifted to the permissive temperature (Figures 2d-2f) . We feel that, at 39.5%, ts045 G protein is in a monomeric form and becomes oligomeric at 31%. This conclusion is supported by the chemical cross-linking studies (below). gregation of G Occurs in a Late or ost-RER Compartment Double immunolabeling was performed in an attempt to localize the intracellular compartment where patching of G was induced by the microinjected antipeptide antibodies. Only weak staining of G patches could be detected with antibodies reacting with RER Figures 3a-3c) or antidocking protein (provided by M. Hortsch and D. Meyer, EMBL, not shown). Thus patching of G probably occurred in a late or post-RER compartment. Usually there was no overlapping labeling of patches of G with Golgi-specific markers like fluoresceinconjugated wheat germ agglutinin (Figures 3d-3f) or antibodies recognizing galactosyltransferase (Roth and Berger, 1982 ; not shown). Furthermore, no significant transport of G to the Golgi complex seemed to have proceeded in cells microinjected with P5D4 or olP4 (cf. Figure 2 with Figure  3 ). Very little G, visualized by the microinjected antipeptide antibodies, could be detected in the perinuclear area of the Golgi complex (cf. Figure 2d with Figure 2e ). Therefore, patching of G by microinjected P5D4 or aP4 most likely occurred in a late RER or early Goigi compartment, or in between. isulfide-Linked G Dligomers and Cross-Linking of G with DEW icai Chemical cross-linking with 1O-4 M DTSP was performed on living cells infected with VSV in order to retain the native, endogenous membrane organization ( Figure 4 ). Trypan blue exclusion during the reaction showed that the plasma membrane of cross-linked cells remained intact. The concentration of the DTSP cross-tinker was kept low to prevent nonspecific coupling. Cross-linking of wild-type G clearly occurred (Figure 46 , 4c, 4f, and Figure 5 ) and cross-linking of G to other viral proteins did not ( Figures  5g and 5h ). Increasing the concentration of DTSP above 2 x 10e4 yielded a higher proportion of cross-linked G
