The analytic formula of R eff was given in Eq. (5). Since in many situations, the R 0 (t ) is time-varying, we defined the percentage reduction in R 0 as 1 minus the ratio of the reduced R 0 over its original highest value, usually the basic reproduction number during the initial outbreak. Similarly, the percentage reduction in S h can be defined as 1 minus the host susceptibility. We noted that both percentage reductions in S h and R 0 ranged from 0 to 1. The relationship of R eff against the percentage reductions in S h and R 0 was shown in Fig. 3. Figs. 3(A) -3(C) were the scenarios of the highest R 0 = 2, R 0 = 5, and R 0 = 10 respectively. The range of R 0 from 2 to 10 covers most of the vector-borne diseases' basic reproduction numbers during the initial outbreak. We used the 2015-2016 YF outbreak in Luanda to demonstrate the effective reproduction number formula in Eq. (5). The YF epidemic was shown in Fig. 2A . Subsequent to the (first) major epidemic wave that peaked in the February of 2016, we observed a second minor wave that followed the major wave, which peaked in May. We showed the reconstructed R 0 (t ) and approximated S h (t ) reproduced from Zhao et al. (2018b) in Fig. 2B . The local human susceptibility, S h (t ), was decreasing by the end of February and ended up less than 7% due to the timely mass vaccination campaign (Shearer et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018b; Kraemer et al., 2017) . We found two peaks in the reconstructed R 0 (t ), of which the highest value was found to be 7.1 during the first wave that peaked in January. The second peak of R 0 (t ) occurred in the April of 2016 with the local maximal value of 5.6. We matched the second peak in R 0 (t ), highlighted in purple, and the minor epidemic wave in the YF incidences, highlighted in grey, by one SI shift, i.e., 23 days averagely (Wu et al., 2016) . Figure 2C shows the effective reproduction number calculated or estimated by Eq. (1) or Eq. (5) or the renewable equation in Eq. (7). The (first) major transmission, i.e., R eff (t ), wave peaked in January of 2016 associated with the major epidemic wave that peaked in February ( Fig. 2A) . We found the R eff (t ) series based on R 0 (t ) and S h (t ) (in Fig. 2B were (almost) synchronised, i.e., in-phase, with the estimated R eff (t ) (or R(t )) series by the renewable equation. The highest R eff (t ) estimate by renewable equation was 5.5, and the same as the estimate by using Eq. (5) that was also 5.5, whereas the Eq. (1) version is 4.4. Similar to the trends of YF incidences and R 0 (t ), we also found a second minor wave in R eff (t ) around April, highlighted in purple. During this minor wave, the local maximal R eff (t ) estimate by renewable equation was 2.0 (95% CI [1.1-3.4]) that is larger than 1 significantly, the '' R 0 âˆš S h S v '' version was 2.3, and the '' R 0 S h '' version is 0.9 ( < 1). Figure 4 showed the trajectory of the R eff (t ) from Eq. (5) against the percentage reductions in S h and R 0 of the YF epidemic in Luanda. Consistent with the observations in Fig. 2C , we found both of the two transmission waves of YF R eff (t ) moved across the disease control threshold, i.e., R eff = 1. For the second transmission waves, marked in the purple rectangle, it ''broke'' the R eff = 1 boundary and thus associated with the second (minor) YF epidemic wave in May of 2016, highlighted in grey in Fig. 2A .
