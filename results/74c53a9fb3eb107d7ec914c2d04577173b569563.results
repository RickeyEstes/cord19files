cDNA cloning. The sizes of cDNA obtained using 2 p~g of starting material and oligodT 12-18 as a primer ranged between 0.3 and 6 kb with hot-phenol-purified BECV F15 AÂ¢A To, , , , .., .rv PROTEIN 4i 5 genomic RNA and between 0.3 and 18 kb with phenol/proteinase-K-purified genomic RNA ( fig. 1 ). We obtained 178 TetR-Amp s clones containing 0.3-to 2.2-kb inserts. OpJy 24 inserts longer than 1 kb were studied and mapped ( fig. 2 ). Their 5'-end is supposed to code for a part of the M glycoprotein by analogy with other studies of murine and avian coronaviruses. It is known that the M protein is encoded by a gene about 800 nucleotides long which is localized at approximately 1,500 nucleotides from the 3'-end of the viral geneme. Clones having 2 or 3 restriction sites (SphI, PvuII, XbaI) which correspond to the 5'-end of N gene (Cruci~re and Laporte, !988) and a 5'-end longer than 0.8 kb from SphI site were retained for cloning in MI3 phage.
