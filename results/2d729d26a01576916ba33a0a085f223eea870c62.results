Sephadex overlays yielded plaque formation by SDAV-681 and PRCV (Table 1) . Plaques were most visible when trypsin (1.25-2.50 pg/ml) was included in the absorption media and cells were fixed 34 days after virus inoculation (Fig. 1) . This technique was easy, readily reproducible, and provided a permanent record; however, cells had to be fixed prior to counting plaques and the method was not suitable for plaque cloning. Using agarose overlays, optimally visible plaques formed using a final agarose concentration of 0.5% (Fig. 2) . Lower agarose concentrations did not solidify and higher agarose concentrations resulted in the formation of syncytia which remained on the plastic and did not peel back to form a clear area. Concentrations of trypsin higher than 6.25 pg/ml in the absorption media or 2.52 pg/ml in the agarose overlay caused L2 cells to detach from the plastic during incubation. Plaques were much smaller and were less numerous when agarose overlays did not contain trypsin ( heavily confluent cells tended to detach from the plastic and sub-confluent cells yielded indistinct plaques. Hepes buffer (1.8 mg/ml) was well tolerated by L2 cells and reduced acidification of the agarose overlay during incubation. TES buffer was more toxic than Hepes and was not used. The addition of FBS (0.065%) to the overlay reduced plaque size and visibility. Fusion of adjacent cells appeared reduced and cells on the periphery grew in to fill defects in the monolayer, rapidly obliterating plaques. Since serum contains trypsin inhibitors (Graham and Estes, 1980) , higher trypsin concentrations (> 1.25 pg/ml) were added to the overlay in an attempt to eliminate this effect. However, the addition of more trypsin increased cell detachment from the plastic and did not restore plaque visibility. Nutridoma, a synthetic cell supplement, was added to the overlay in an attempt to improve cell viability. without neutralizing trypsin. Concentrations of Nutridoma from 0.06% to 1% did not improve plaque visibility or cell viability. Inclusion of DEAE-D pre-treatment, trypsin in the absorption media or trypsin in the overlay increased the number of plaques formed (P <O.OOOl) ( Table 2) . Inclusion of trypsin in the absorption media or the overlay, but not DEAE-D (in the pre-absorption media and the absorption media) increased plaque size and visibility (Fig. 3) . A trypsin concentration of 1.25 pg/ml in the overlay was optimal when cells were not treated with DEAE-D. Likewise, a trypsin concentration of 2.5 pg/ml in absorption media was well tolerated in combination with 1.25 pg/ml trypsin in the overlay when DEAE-D was not used. Trypsin concentration in the absorption media and the overlay was reduced (0.63 lug/ml) when used with DEAE-D pre-treatment. If used without trypsin, 100 mg/ml of DEAE-D was well tolerated. The concentration of DEAE-D was reduced (75 mg/ml) when used with a trypsin-containing overlay. A 3-h pre-absorption period with DEAE-D maximized the number of plaques seen (data not shown). A 5% neutral red-containing second overlay allowed plaque visualization 12 h later while retaining virus viability in the plaque. A neutral red-containing second overlay allowed rapid enumeration of plaque numbers without waiting for cells to fix or stain. Concentrations of neutral red higher than 5% were rapidly toxic. However, neutral red was not needed to locate and aspirate viable plaques. Formalin fixation followed by Giemsa staining (Fig. 3) was simple and yielded a permanent record. First, second and third passage plaques were successfully isolated from mouse brain stocks of SDAV-681 and PRCV and tissue homogenates of SDAV-WT. Individual plaques routinely yielded 50-125 new plaques when passaged using trypsin-containing agarose overlays without DEAE-D pretreatment. As demonstrated by PRNT results (Fig. 4) , the plaque assay was specific with more plaques observed at higher dilutions of antiserum. Plaques were not Each well was inoculated with a volume and dilution calculated to produce 100 PFU after incubation for 1 h at 31Â°C. seen in the absence of inoculated virus. Anti-SDAV-68 1 serum dilutions as high as 1:320 neutralized more than 70% of plaques induced by stock SDAV-681.
