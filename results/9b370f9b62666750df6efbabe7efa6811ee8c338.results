Protein segments that perform a particular function can be identified by their deletion or addition to unrelated proteins. We used this approach to localize and characterize the region in ly that is responsible for membrane insertion. Deletions and fusions were made at the DNA level after cloning of ly cDNA into an expression vector. Messenger RNA was transcribed from these plasmids and translated in a cell-free system. The resulting proteins were tested for their ability to insert into microsomal membranes (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975; Stueber et al., 1984) .
