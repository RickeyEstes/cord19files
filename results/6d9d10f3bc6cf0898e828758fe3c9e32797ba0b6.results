Altogether 350 episodes of AECOPD were screened for this study. Cases (n ϭ 76) with pneuwww.chestjournal.org CHEST / 132 / 3 / SEPTEMBER, 2007 AAAACAARTGCTCTGCRCCYCAAC 516 CRTCTCCACCTACTTCRTTYCCCCC monic changes on CXR or predominantly congestive heart failure were excluded. Among those cases that fitted the inclusion criteria, 12 patients refused to consent for the study. Finally, 262 episodes of AECOPD were included for analysis among 196 patients. Only 165 subjects had returned for lung function tests at 117.88 Ϯ 92.6 days after discharge from the hospital for AECOPD. Thirteen subjects died (either as inpatients or after discharge) before lung function test could be arranged, whereas 18 subjects defaulted follow-up. Among those who died or defaulted follow-up, lung function data obtained at stable state within 1 year prior to the admission for AECOPD were taken for statistical analysis (data available for 11 deceased subjects and 8 defaulters). The majority of our subjects were men (81.6%), and the length of stay in the acute care hospital was 5.8 Ϯ 3.0 days. After the first episode of hospitaliza-tion for AECOPD, 25 patients died, whereas 121 patients were readmitted to the hospital with another episode of AECOPD within 12 months. Among all the episodes of AECOPD, 23 episodes (8.8%) required NPPV support. Neither ICU admission nor invasive mechanical ventilation was required by our subjects. Demographic data of the subjects are presented in Table 2 . Among those with NPA specimens collected, 58 subjects (22.1%) had positive viral PCR results. The most common virus identified was influenza A (19 of 58 patients, 7.3%), followed by coronavirus OC43 (12 of 58 patients, 4.6%), rhinovirus (8 of 58 patients, 3.1%), influenza B (7 of 58 patients, 2.7%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [6 of 58 patients, 2.3%]. Results of the viral etiology based on PCR assay are shown in Figure 1 . All the influenza A belonged to the H3 subtype, with neither H1 nor H5 subtypes identified. There were four cases of parainfluenza viruses detected, with one case for each of the following strains identified: parainfluenza type 1, 2, 3, and 4. Table 3 shows PCR results of the NPA in relation to the lung function of the subjects. The rates of identifying a positive viral etiology by PCR were similar among the subjects with FEV 1 Ն 50%, Ն 30 to 50%, and Ͻ 30% of predicted normal. The seasonal pattern of the viruses is illustrated in Figure 2 . The rates of positive virus identification by PCR method in the NPA peaked in July to September of the year. Among our subjects admitted with AECOPD, 41.8% had received influenza vaccination within the past 12 months, but there was no difference in the detection rates of influenza A or B in the NPA when compared to those without influenza vaccination (11.1% vs 9.0%, p ϭ 0.58). The relationship between influenza vaccination and the detection rates of influenza viruses in NPA by PCR method is shown in Table 4 . Altogether, 244 episodes of AECOPD had both PCR and conventional viral culture performed for viral identification in the NPA, whereas viral culture was not performed in 18 patients. In comparison to conventional viral culture, the overall diagnostic yield of PCR was approximately three times higher. Comparisons of PCR and conventional viral culture in the NPA specimen are shown in Table 5 . The NPA PCR-positive and viral culture-positive cases (n ϭ 15) had a longer length of hospital stay than the cases (n ϭ 40) with positive PCR and negative viral culture results (7.73 Ϯ 5.16 days vs 4.93 Ϯ 1.64 days, p ϭ 0.03). However, lung function (FEV 1 percentage of predicted value) between the two groups did not show any significant difference (34.5 Ϯ 15.1% vs 40.8 Ϯ 19.5%, p ϭ 0.269). Episodes of AECOPD with positive viral identification were compared to those without, but the length of hospital stay was similar (median, 5 days; interquartile range, 4 to 6 days; and 5 days; interquartile range, 4 to 7 days) for virus-positive and virus-negative groups, respectively (p ϭ 0.39). There were no significant differences in the rates of hospital readmissions between the virus-positive and virus-negative groups on their initial admission (virus-positive group, 56.0%; virus negative group, 63.7%; p ϭ 0.33). One-year mortality rates in the virus-positive vs virus-negative groups were also similar (virus-positive group, 8.0%; virus-negative group, 14.4%; p ϭ 0.24). Furthermore, there was no difference in the rates of NPPV usage between the virus-positive and virus-negative groups (6.9% vs 9.3%, respectively; p ϭ 0.57).
