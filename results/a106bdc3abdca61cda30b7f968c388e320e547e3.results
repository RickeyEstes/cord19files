We use the act of sharing a message pertaining to influenza as a proxy for an individual engaging with media about an influenza outbreak. While this act of sharing does not necessarily imply that the individual will change their behaviour, it does suggest that the individual is at least somewhat concerned by the media surrounding the influenza outbreak. Figure 1 shows the relationship between proportion of US-based tweets which were retweets concerning influenza (that is, number of retweets containing one or more of the strings 'influenza', 'flu', '#influenza' or '#flu' divided by the total number of tweets) and the number of influenza-like-illness (ILI) cases per week for the 2009/2010 to 2014/2015 influenza seasons, expressed as a percentage of the total number of visits to sentinel providers. The data on weekly counts of ILI activity and retweeting rates used can be found in the electronic supplementary material. We chose to fit to ILI activity rather than laboratory-confirmed influenza incidence because we expect individuals to tend to share flu-related information on social media upon feeling ill, rather than strictly once they are Importantly, while the relationship between media engagement and flu activity is small, it is roughly linear for most flu seasons plotted. Using AIC to test linear and quadratic models for the data, we found that the linear model was selected in all seasons apart from 2009/2010. We show linear and quadratic fits for this season as well as 2014/2015 in the subplots below the main figure. In 2014/2015, the linear model was slightly preferred with a relative Akaike weight of 0.58 to 0.42 for the quadratic model, while in 2009/2010 the quadratic model was slightly preferred with a relative Akaike weight of 0.55 to 0.45 for the linear model. Note that as demonstrated by the model fits in the two subfigures, the Akaike weights indicate that there is substantial support in the data for both the linear and quadratic models. Indeed, we found that the relative likelihood of the quadratic model increased with the total number of ILI cases per season (see electronic supplementary material), suggesting that nonlinear media effects may become increasingly relevant during more severe outbreaks. We also present residual plots for the linear and quadratic models for all years in the electronic supplementary material, showing no obvious non-random patterns for the model fits, along with further details of the AIC model selection and a table of relative Akaike weights for all years. Note also that we observed similar-looking relationships between media engagement and influenza activity when using the number of comments on flu-related articles in the New York Times between 2001 and 2013 as our metric for media engagement. However, due to the smaller amount of data we could only find a statistically significant correlation between the two during the 2009 pandemic. Based upon these observations and for simplicity in comparing models, we propose the following simple linear media function to describe the reduction in transmission due to media effects: where p m is a parameter (to be fitted) describing the reduction in actual transmission due to concern from media coverage. Yorke & London applied a similar function in a different context, to model exposure rates for seasonal measles outbreaks [31] . Note that in order to assure that 0 ≤ f m (I) ≤ 1 it will be necessary to constrain p m such that 0 ≤ p m ≤ 1, as I ≤ 1 always. This is in contrast with the media functions (2.7)-(2.9), for which the parameters can take on any value p 1 , p 2 , p 3 ≥ 0. We remark that while an obvious extension for larger outbreaks would be to use a quadratic media function f m (I) = 1 − p m1 I − p m2 I 2 , for ease of comparison with existing media functions, we will only consider the one-parameter model (3.1). We show an example of the effect of the media function f m upon the dynamics in figure 2 , where we have set p m = 0.05, R 0 = 1.5, γ = 1/2 (d) −1 , σ = 1/2 (d) −1 and have plotted E = E 1 + E 2 and I = I 1 + I 2 . The media function reduces the total number of infected persons (i.e. the final size of the epidemic) and size of the peak, while not notably changing the timing of the peak. The slower rate of depletion of susceptibles means that the infection dies out slightly slower in the model with media effect. To investigate how well the various transmission models, both with and without media effects, describe real influenza outbreaks, we fit (2.1)-(2.6) with f (I) ≡ 1 as well as (2.7)-(3.1) to weekly laboratoryconfirmed influenza incidence data for the 1998-2013 flu seasons using least squares. Note that unlike social media engagement which can be reasonably expected to relate to ILI, it is appropriate to fit models of the underlying disease dynamics to confirmed influenza incidence data only. Using the L-BFGS-B method, we find parameter values R 0 , σ , γ and media parameter p m which best fit the data. seasons are shown in the electronic supplementary material. We fit observations from four weeks before the peak to 12 weeks after the peak. Also shown in table 1 are the average conditional probabilities for each model, as obtained from the normalized Akaike weights for each model across all flu seasons between 1998/1999 and 2014/2015 in which a non-zero media function was found. In figure 3 , we show example fits to observations of the percentage of new laboratory-confirmed influenza cases per week (blue) for the model with no media effect (red) and media functions given by f m (green), f 1 (cyan), f 2 (magenta) and f 3 (yellow) for the 2013/2014 influenza season. As with the ILI data, the laboratory-confirmed case data are expressed as a percentage of the total number of visits to sentinel surveillance providers. The inset plot shows the corresponding media functions with best-fitting parameters. While no model is able to correctly estimate the size of the peak of the infection, the model with linear media function f m is the only one which correctly identifies the week in which the infection peaks. The media functions f m and f 1 are also the only models which describe the decay of the infection post-peak well. While the media function f m (I) was derived based upon Twitter data, our intention in focusing on news-sharing behaviours is to model the effects of mass media more generally. Indeed, we might expect that population-level engagement with other forms of mass media show a similar monotonically decreasing relationship between media coverage and transmission. To that end, we now apply the proposed media function to all influenza seasons we have incidence data for, and find similar results for most seasons between 1998/1999 and 2014/2015. Table 2 with the distribution of RMS errors significantly less spread and centred closer to 0 than all other models. All models with media effect are significantly better than the standard model at matching the observed peak timing of an outbreak (Mood's median test, p = 0.05), although there is no significant difference between the four models. Similarly, there is no significant difference across models in explaining the observed final epidemic size, in fact the median error for the standard model without media effect is slightly lower than that for the models with media functions (however, this difference is not significant). We remark that much of the improvement made by the media function f m comes from better describing the post-peak period. The no media (i.e. f (I) ≡ 1) model becomes preferable as more of the data leading up to the peak of each season is used to fit the models. In figure 5 , we show the average conditional probability of selecting each model as a function of the number of weeks of data used before the peak. The no media and f m models are always preferred over the other media function models (i.e. using f 1 , f 2 and f 3 ), with the f m model being preferred up until around 10-12 weeks before the peak. When fitting data earlier than 12 weeks before the peak the no media model is preferred, suggesting that the effect of media coverage becomes more important later in the season. Furthermore, neither model is able to reliably predict the peak of the infection in terms of either size or timing based upon data from before the peak only. This suggests that in order to make accurate predictions and estimate parameters rather than explain an existing dataset when only small amounts of data are available, we must use a more advanced methodology such as data assimilation [32] .
