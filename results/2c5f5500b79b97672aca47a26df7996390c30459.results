Clinical characteristics of patients with PTB and CAP. In total, 62 patients with PTB and 215 patients with CAP were included in the analysis, and all were non-immunocompromised based on negative human immunodeficiency virus infection test results. Clinical characteristics of PTB patients and CAP patients are summarized in Table 1 . Median ages were 52 years (IQR, 37-71 years) and 60 years (IQR, 42-75 years) in patients with PTB and CAP, respectively, and more than half of patients were male in both groups. The rate of never smokers was higher in the CAP group (P = 0.026); no differences in age, gender, or underlying pulmonary or extra-pulmonary disease were observed among the two groups, except history of PTB treatment (16% in PTB group vs. 7% in CAP group, P = 0.048). All patients had respiratory symptoms or signs; rates of cough (P = 0.005), sputum (P < 0.001), and fever (P < 0.001) were significantly higher in CAP group, and hemoptysis (P = 0.007) was more frequently observed in PTB group. No significant differences in the rate of dyspnea or severe disease (pneumonia Laboratory findings of patients with PTB and CAP. We compared initial laboratory findings including WBC, DNI, and CRP levels between patients with PTB and CAP (Table 2 ). In patients with PTB, the median WBC count, the DNI, and CRP were 6625/μL (IQR, 5528-9065/μL), 0% (IQR, 0-0.2%), and 21.7 mg/L (IQR, 4.2-75.6 mg/L), respectively, which were all significantly lower than those of patients with CAP (all P < 0.001 for WBC, DNI, and CRP values). Initial DNI values in patients with PTB ranged from 0-2.4% and 69% (43/62) of patients with PTB initially had a DNI value of 0%. In contrast, initial DNI values in patients with CAP ranged from 0-22.8%, which was significantly higher than that of patients with PTB, and only 15% (32/215) of patients with CAP had an initial DNI value of 0% (Fig. 1) . Non-mycobacterial agents and viral agents were identified in 144 (67%) and 35 (35/130, 27%) patients with CAP, respectively, which were both significantly higher isolation rates compared with those of patients with PTB. However, 10 patients with PTB had co-infections with non-mycobacterial agents, such as S. pneumoniae or H. influenza, and three PTB patients had viral etiologies, such as rhinovirus or influenza virus.
