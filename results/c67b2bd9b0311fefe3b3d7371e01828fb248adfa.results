Of the 56 persons enrolled in this study, 1 did not provide a serum sample at baseline and was excluded from analysis. Fifty-five percent of the enrollees were male, and the median age was 48 years (interquartile range 33-63 years) ( Table 1) . Most (87%) persons were non-Hispanic whites, which reflected the demographics of the study-site sample. Patients with lower respiratory syndromes had a median of 3 additional inclusion criteria. Individual criteria were evaluation by a chest radiograph (82%), administration of an antimicrobial drug (80%), dyspnea on exertion (56%), pleurisy (44%), and multiple visits for the same condition (42%).
