3.1. Nano-rings were obtained with N from HRSV Long strain, formulated with Montanide TM adjuvants and tested for their immunogenicity We have previously shown that soluble RNA-nucleoprotein complexes forming nano-rings (N SRS ) can be purified from bacteria expressing recombinant N and the C-terminal region (residues 161-241) of P protein (PCT) from the HRSV Long strain [20] . The same protocol was used in order to purify BRSV N proteins. The BRSV N protein was co-expressed with PCT from either HRSV or BRSV origin. As shown Fig. 1a , the BRSV N protein (strain A2Gelfi) was only recovered in the unsoluble fraction of bacterial lysates, and attempts to purify it by co-expression with GST-PCT were unsuccessful, either using PCT from BRSV or HRSV origin. On the other hand, the HRSV N protein was soluble and efficiently purified by BRSV PCT fused to GST (Fig. 1a) . The N proteins of human strain Long and bovine strain 3761 are highly conserved since they share 93.6% of sequence amino acid identity and 99.2% of amino acid sequence similarity (Fig. 1b) . Thus we used the N SRS nano-rings derived from the HRSV Long strain as a vaccine candidate against BRSV infection. To control that N SRS were not degraded after emulsification with Montanide TM ISA71 VG or Montanide TM IMS4132 VG, the proteins present in the two formulations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE native gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy as described previously [20] . In both cases, the N protein was recovered as SRS (data not shown). Intramuscular injection is the classical way to vaccinate bovine. Our previous data in mice showed that nasal vaccination with the nano-rings N SRS was the most efficient immunization route for preventing HRSV replication in lung [22] . Thus we decided to administer the N SRS vaccine via both intramuscular and intranasal route at the same time (group N SRS i.m. + i.n.) and test the benefit of nasal vaccination by comparison with a group of calves receiving the vaccine by intramuscular injection only (group N SRS i.m.). All calves were vaccinated twice at 3 weeks interval. A third group of calves was left untreated (group "no vaccine"). No adverse clinical reactions were observed after the first or second immunizations. To monitor the immunogenicity of the vaccine regimen, Nspecific antibodies were investigated in serum samples and nasal secretions (Fig. 2 ). Calves vaccinated with N SRS either i.m. or i.m. + i.n. displayed anti-N Ab in serum and in nasal secretions, detectable after the first immunization and increasing after the booster immunization ( Fig. 2a and b) . Anti-N Ab titers were not different between the two vaccinated groups. The nasal anti-N Ab response was of IgG1 isotype (Fig. 2c) , with lower anti-N IgA titers arising mostly after the booster immunization (Fig. 2d) . Nasal anti-N Ab titers were higher in the group N SRS i.m. + i.n. compared to N SRS i.m. (p < 0.05 for Ig titers and p < 0.01 for IgA titers, at day 41). Non-vaccinated control calves had significant anti-N Ab titers in blood and nasal secretion only after viral challenge ( Fig. 2a and b, p < 0.01 between days 0-41 and day 62, Ig titers in the no vaccine group). The antibodies elicited upon N SRS vaccination were also able to recognize the native viral N as shown by their specific binding to BRSV-infected Turbinate cells as antigen (OD ×100 at day 41 were 22 ± 10, 287 ± 64 and 188 ± 41, for groups no vaccine, N SRS i.m. and N SRS i.m. + i.n., respectively, p < 0.01 between vaccinated and non-vaccinated calves).
