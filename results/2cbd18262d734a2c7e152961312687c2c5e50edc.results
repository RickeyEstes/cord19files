When the antibody titer at the second examination was higher than 4 times that at the first examination, the case was judged to be infected. Six cases out of the 26 having given paired sera were judged to be infected. Four of them (cases 1, 4, 7 and 16) were considered to be at onset of influenza B virus infection when their otorrhea increased ( Fig. 1) . Coincidentally, influenza B virus prevailed in December, 1981 -March, 1982 in this country. The rest two were cases of RSV The antibody titers were dertermined by the with hemagglutination inhibition test. Each figure represents the number of cases. infection. One (case 18) of them visited this clinic in July and August, complaining of sudden increase of otorrhea (Fig. 2) . The titer of serum RSV antibody determined in September was as high as 16 times that determined in August. RSV infection seemed to have occurred in August in this case. The other one, case 25, showing similarly sharp increase in the antibody titer may probably have been infected in December. Cases 17 and 23 were excluded from the infected group for the following reason: they both showed titer increase by 2 tubes (from the level below 4 to 8), but the latter value itself was not so high as to give a firm basis for diagnosis of an infection. These studies were made during the period from July, 1979 to May, 1982, but Figs. 1 and 2 refer to only months when antibody titer was determined. The titer of 83 serum samples collected from 46 patients of chronic otitis media who visited this department complaining sudden increase in otorrheal output were classified by month of examination. There was no seasonal factor affecting the titer. Among these titers, the specific antibody titers to parainfluenza 3 virus are given in Table 1 . Virus isolation was tried with 38 cases. Influenza B virus was isolated from two cases and RSV from one case; both from the pharyngeal cavity. None of the otorrheal samples yielded any virus. One of the two cases yielding influenza B virus (case 4 in Fig. 1 ) was diagnosed as influenza B virus infection on the basis of the rise in the titer. In the other of the two cases yielding influenza B virus and the case yielding RSV virus, titration for antibody was made only once at the initial examination. The titer of influenza B virus antibody was 16 in the former case and that of RSV antibody 32 in the latter. All 83 serum samples gave antibody titer below 40 with respect to M. pneumoniae. M. pneumoniae was isolated from the pharyngeal cavity in one of the 38 cases, on which isolation was tried. The case in question, however, was not con-sidered to be of M. pneumoniae infection since the titers of the paired sera were lower than 40. Virus or M. pneumoniae infection was not demonstrated by examination of paired sera taken from any of the 10 control patients with chronic otitis media. None ofthem had any virus or M. pneumoniae in the pharyngeal cavity. SUGITA (1977) isolated bacteria from otorrhea and pharyngeal mucous scrapings in cases of chronic otitis media, reporting that more than two species of bacteria were isolated from many of otorrheal specimens. When one of these species from otorrhea was the same as that isolated from the pharyngeal mucous scrapings, the case was called the consistent one. He reported also that the consistent ratio (ratio of consistent cases to the total cases examined) was 55.6 % (40/72) in the group of cases complicated with upper respiratory inflammation, whereas only 3.6 % (1/28) in the group of no complication. In the present study, we tried to isolate bacteria from otorrhea and pharyngeal mucous scrapings of 43 cases of acutely exacerbated chronic otitis media and, according to the criterion he used, the consistent ratio was 46.5 % (20/43). This ratio was close to that reported by SUGITA (1977) for the complicated group. The followings were consistent cases in this study: 1) Six cases which were considered to have a virus infection in the light of the antibody titers in paired sera, and 2) two cases in which viruses isolated from the pharyngeal cavity though paired sera not obtained. As a general symptom, we noticed fever of approximately 37-39°C in four cases of influenza B virus infection (cases 1, 4, 7 and 16) belonging to the group of virus infection and also in five cases judged to be uninfected through examinations of paired sera. Of the cases in which paired sera could not be obtained, five were also feverish (37-38°C). These cases included the one in which influenza B virus was isolated from the pharyngeal cavity. As a whole, 14 of 46 cases suffered from pyrexia.
