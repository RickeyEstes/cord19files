Influenza A/H7N9 epidemic curves Reproduction number estimates based on the Bayesian sequential approach The Bayesian sequential estimation approach revealed that the Shanghai and Zhejiang A/H7N9 data were most consistent with a R around 0.1, with broad 95% credible intervals (0.01 to 0.49) excluding 1 ( Table 1 ). The progression of updated R estimates as data accumulate over time is shown in Figures 2 and 3 for each province; there was no significant change in estimated R as the outbreak progressed from February to May 2013 in either location. The prior and posterior distributions for R are compared in Figure 4 and reveal a moderate change as the outbreak progresses, suggesting that there is relatively limited information in the A/H7N9 case data.
