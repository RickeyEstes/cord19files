In this section, the proposed approach is illustrated using the task of intubation. Table 2 illustrates a JHA for the work activity of intubation developed from standard medical texts and through discussion among the research team, which included members who have performed or observed the procedure and members with expertise in infectious diseases and industrial hygiene. Experimental simulation of intubation using fluorescent-simulated body fluid in the respiratory tract of a task trainer demonstrated contamination of the air in the breathing zone of participants and on the gloves, gowns (torso and cuffs), and face shields of participants, 31 which affirms the sites of body contamination identified by the JHA. We considered 2 infectious agents, MRSA and SARS-CoV, which were selected because epidemiologic evidence indicates that they pose different hazards for HCP ( Table 3) . Intubation of patients with SARS-CoV has been associated with occupationally acquired SARS-CoV infections. 32 MRSA colonization of the nares of HCP is relatively common, however, occupationally acquired MRSA infection typically affects HCP with injuries (eg, cuts), and to our knowledge has not been associated with performing intubation. 33 Therefore, the risk-based selection of PPE ensembles should yield different recommendations for HCP performing intubation on patients with SARS-CoV or MRSA. The exposure surface for SARS-CoV is the respiratory tract since cellular receptors for the virus are located in the bronchi and alveoli. 36 The JHA indicates potential for respiratory tract exposure associated with inhalation and inspiration of aerosols (steps 2 and 7, Table 2 ) and exposure of the nose and mouth mucous membranes via aerosol deposition and self-contact with hands contaminated during the procedure, respectively. Therefore, the potential exists for the virus to reach the exposure surface (the respiratory tract), and PPE should be selected to protect the respiratory tract. Surgical masks protect HCP from relatively large aerosols that project onto the face and exposed facial mucous membranes, but do not protect against inhalation of aerosols. These devices are also loose fitting and easy for HCP to by-pass. Respirators protect HCP from inhaling aerosols and from projected droplets. Tight-fitting respirators and respirators with loose-fitting hoods can limit self-contact by HCP. Elastomeric full-facepiece respirators and respirators with loose-fitting hoods offer better respiratory protection and more facial coverage against splash than FFRs. Given the severity of SARS-CoV infection, the higher level of protection afforded by a PAPR with a loose-fitting hood may be warranted. The JHA also indicated that contamination of the torso, arms, and hands is likely. Body and hand coverings should be used because, although SARS-CoV does not infect through the dermis, contaminated clothing and skin may serve as an environmental reservoir. Given the relatively short duration and limited fluid volume produced during intubation of SARS patients, fluidimpermeable gowns may not be required, particularly if HCP are able to rapidly doff soiled body coverings and perform hand hygiene. The exposure surface for MRSA is the dermis and the nares. Although infection typically requires a wound, colonization can occur at many locations on the body (Table 3 ). During intubation HCPs may be exposed to respiratory secretions and vomitus, which are unlikely to contain MRSA unless the patient is colonized in the nares or throat, or has an active MRSA pneumonia. Aerosols formed during intubation may be inhaled by an HCP into the nares, or transferred to the nares during self-contact with hands contaminated during the procedure; the torso and arms may be contaminated with respiratory secretions ( Table 2 ). Unless the HCP has an open wound or indwelling device, there is low risk of developing infection from exposures associated with intubation. PPE is necessary to prevent contamination of HCP clothing and skin, which could serve as an environmental reservoir for future transmission. Colonization of HCP rarely leads to overt symptoms; however, protection of the nares with a mask or respirator could decrease the risk of colonization or further transmission. Selection of PPE for intubation of a MRSA patient, however, should consider the likelihood of undiagnosed colonization or infection by another microorganism.
