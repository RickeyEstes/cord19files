In There were approximately 0.86 public health professionals who had participated in a 2-year FELTP or PHSWOW per million inhabitants in sub-Saharan Africa. In the 17 countries with programs there were approximately 1.2 FELTP or PHSWOW participants per million inhabitants, which is less than the estimated minimum coverage of 3-5 field epidemiologists per million inhabitants of a country [23] . All the sub-Saharan programs award a master's degree to participants upon completion of university requirements, some programs provide the same type of degree to field epidemiologists, public health laboratory epidemiologists, and veterinarians whereas other programs have different track-specific degrees (Table   1 ). Of the 12 programs started between 1993 and 2010, six (50%) received startup funding from PEPFAR, and five (42%) received funding from USAID. Other funders included the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and PMI. Host country MOHs (and ministries of agriculture for programs with veterinarians) also contributed significant resources, usually in kind (e.g., space for the program, ancillary facilities, and field sites). CDC provided supplementary funding through various initiatives for example the Global Disease Detection program in Kenya from 2006 and PEPFAR provided some support to the Zimbabwe PHSWOW [16, 24] . The donor cost of implementing an FELTP ranges between US $ 1-2 million per year at inception. These costs reduced with time as expatriate staff left and the program transitioned to local staff (usually graduates of the initial cohorts) and host government funding began to replace donor funding. The costs associated with implementation include: a) resident costs which include university tuition, stipends, books, computers, and research costs; b) program costs which include emergency response, local and international travel, program office operations, field supervision visits, field site maintenance; and c) technical assistance (from Atlanta, which supports the country team); and d) resident advisor salary and support.
