Among 50 included patients, 32 (0.64%) were female and 18 (0.36%) were male with a mean±SD age of 37.3 ± 12.3 years (range 14-65 years). The rheumatologic diagnoses were as follows. Takayasu arteritis in 3 cases (6%), Microscopic polyangiitis in 4 cases (8%), Granulomatosis with polyangiitis in 5 cases (10%), polymyositis in 10 cases (20%), temporal arteritis in 2 cases (4%), Rheumatoid arthritis complicated by scleritiis in 5 cases (10%), Relapsing polychondritis in 1 cases (2%), Adult-onset Still's disease in 3 cases (6%), Dermatomyositis in 3 cases (6%), Systemic lupus erythematossis in 10 cases (20%), and Behçet's disease in 4 cases (8%). The occurrence of ON was not correlated with the disease of the patient (p= 0.3). The mean±SD duration of steroid therapy was 4.7 ± 1.6 months (range 2-8 months) and the mean±SD starting CS dose was 41.9 ± 9.4 mg (range 30-60 mg). Twenty eight patients (56.0%) were administered high cumulative dose pulse CS regimens and others did not receive any pulse regimen. We found 18 (36%) patients who suffered from ON of femoral neck. The two groups with and without ON were comparable in terms of sex, age and mean starting highdose CS. Duration of high-dose CS consumption was longer in ON patients (p= 0.0001). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the type of steroid regimen between the ON and non-ON groups. Total cumulative CS dose was not related to ON. Alt-hough the cumulative high-dose was significantly higher in patients with ON than patients without ON (p= 0.0001). Among the study population, 28 (56%) had Cushingoid face appearance. This finding was 66% in ON group and 50% in the other group (p>0.05) ( Table 1 ).
