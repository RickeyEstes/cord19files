Sequence information was obtained for approximately 950 bp of the NS5 gene from each of 25 different strains of SLEV (Table 2 ). The sequences were aligned with the MEGA 4 software (Tamura et al., 2007) . Regions that showed minimal sequence variation were chosen as candidate regions for primer/probe target selection. The same process was repeated for the E1 region from sequences from multiple strains of EEEV found in the GenBank database. Primers and probes were selected with the Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) (Table 1) . For detection of the maximum number of SLE strains, we selected 2 forward primers, 2 reverse primers, and 2 probes because we were unable to find 1 set of primers and probe that were 100% homologous with all strains. Each of the forward primers, reverse primers, and probes had 1 mismatch. Because of the SA status of EEEV, a positive control for the assay was constructed that could be used in a BSL-2 laboratory by non-SA-approved personnel, thereby facilitating the assay's diagnostic application. The control was an RNA transcript containing a 146-bp portion of the envelopecoding gene of EEEV. This control was also used for the quantification of genomic EEEV RNA. The SLEV transcript, which was used for the quantification of SLEV genomic RNA, was prepared from a recombinant plasmid containing a 63-bp portion of the NS5-coding gene of SLEV strain MSI-7. After construction and quantification of the controls for the assay, various real-time PCR kits from several manufacturers were evaluated for the optimization of our duplex assay. These were TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems), BioRad iScript One-Step RT-PCR kit for probes (Bio-Rad Laboratories), FailSafe Probes Real-Time PCR Optimization kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies), SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invitrogen), Quantitect Multiplex PCR kit (QIAGEN), Quantitect Probe RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN), and LightCycler FastStart DNA Master Hybridization Probes kit (F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ). Because the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR System presented a combination of the lowest Ct and highest ΔRn values (data not shown), we optimized the assay using this kit. Primer optimization was performed with primer concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000 nmol/L, and probe optimization was performed with probe concentrations ranging from 50 to 400 nmol/L. For a TaqMan assay, optimal performance is achieved by selecting primer/probe concentrations that provide the lowest Ct and the highest ΔRn for a fixed amount of target template (Cirino et al., 2007) . The Ct and ΔRn data taken together show that the optimal SLEV primer concentrations were 400 nmol/L each, and the optimal SLEV probe concentrations were 75 nmol/L each. Optimal EEEV primer concentrations were 500 nmol/ L each, whereas the optimal EEEV probe concentration was 200 nmol/L. Serial dilutions of the SLEV and EEEV transcripts were made, and the duplex real-time RT-PCR assay was performed. The assay can detect a range between 5 and 5 × 10 6 gc of EEEV and a range between 10 and 3 × 10 6 gc for SLEV. We were consistently able to detect 5 gc of EEEV target (performed 12 times) and 10 gc of SLEV target (performed 14 times). The assay range and sensitivity of the duplex assay, when compared with the SLE and EEE assays performed separately as singleplex assays, gave similar results, indicating that there is no negative interference between the primer probe sets of the 2 assays (data not shown). To determine the specificity of the assay, we performed the assay using high concentrations (for each virus, approximately 10 6 gc) of nucleic acid from the following organisms: Cox A9, Cox B12, Echo 9, HCoV 229E, hMPV, FluA H1, FluA H3, FluB, RSV, HRV, SARS coronavirus, adenovirus, CMV, EBV, HHV-6, HSV 1 and 2, VZV, WEE virus, Highlands J virus, DENV1-4, POW virus (representatives of lineage I and II), WNV, YF virus, MVE virus, JE virus, C. xerosis, group A Streptococcus, H. influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, N. meningitidis groups B, C, and Y, N. subflava, S. sanguis, and S. pneumoniae serotypes 10A, 11A, and 18F. No cross-reactivity was observed between the EEEV and SLEV primer/probe sets and any of the organisms selected in the specificity panel. PCR results for the panel were all negative; therefore, the assay was specific upon testing a wide range of pathogens. EEEV is the sole species in the EEEV antigenic complex and is divided into North American and South American antigenic varieties based on hemagglutination inhibition tests. On the basis of nucleotide sequencing and serologic tests, including plaque reduction neutralization tests, 4 major lineages/clusters (clusters 1-4) with distinct antigenic subtypes have been identified (Brault et al., 1999) . Serial dilutions were made of the RNA from representatives of each cluster (Table 3) . We then performed the singleplex real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of EEEV on various RNA dilutions to determine whether nucleic acid from the 12 different strains would be amplified by the real-time RT-PCR reaction. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on the various nucleic acid dilutions in a BSL-3 laboratory. Results showed that all 12 strains were detected and amplified by the EEEV primer/probe set. Nucleic acid was extracted from each strain of amplified SLEV, and dilutions were made and tested in the duplex realtime RT-PCR assay. All strains were detected and amplified. Because we were unable to obtain patient specimens that were positive for either SLEV or EEEV, we spiked SLEV culture and EEEV transcript, at each of 3 dilutions, into negative CSF specimens. Appropriate dilutions of SLEV strain MSI-7 culture were made to obtain the high (9.9 × 10 3 gc/250 μL CSF equivalent to 9000 gc/reaction), medium (990 gc/250 μL CSF equivalent to 90 gc/reaction), and low (99 gc/250 μL CSF equivalent to 9 gc/reaction) concentrations. Similarly, a range of nucleic acid concentrations that included high (5.5 × 10 3 gc/250 μL CSF equivalent to 5000 gc/reaction), medium (5.5 × 10 2 gc/250 μL CSF equivalent to 500 gc/reaction), and low (550 gc/250 μL CSF equivalent to 50 gc/reaction) were selected for the EEEV transcript. These dilutions were then spiked into CSF that had previously tested negative for EEEV and SLEV. Forty negative samples were either not spiked or spiked with 1 of 3 concentrations of SLEV culture or of EEEV transcript in various combinations (Table 4 ). All 40 blinded samples were also spiked with a known amount of GFP RNA transcript (2200 gc/μL), which acts as the internal control. RNA was extracted from the specimens using the NucliSens easyMAG system. GFP was then detected in the sample via real-time RT-PCR to determine extraction efficiency and the presence of inhibitors (Table 4) . For each of the blinded samples, the high, medium, and low gc samples could all be detected indicating minimal loss in sensitivity after nucleic acid extraction ( Table 4 ). All of the negative extraction controls had Ct values of N45, indicating that false positives were not detected and that no crosscontamination had occurred during extraction of the samples. Also, all real-time RT-PCR experiments included positive EEEV (500 gc/reaction) and SLEV (1100 gc/ reaction) controls. Both EEEV and SLEV positive controls gave Ct values within the acceptable ranges for each (29-32 and 31-34, respectively) . The Ct values for GFP for all the samples were within the acceptable range (34-38), with the exception of 1 sample (Table 4 , sample with Ct of 38.66) that showed slight inhibition. The EEEV spike and SLEV spike were both detected for this sample. In general, if a clinical specimen showed a higher than acceptable GFP Ct value, the recommendation would be to repeat the extraction and realtime RT-PCR. In a separate experiment, 30 different negative CSF specimens were spiked with 1 of 3 concentrations of EEEV culture (5 × 10 4 , 5 × 10 3 , and 5 × 10 2 gc/250 μL CSF equivalent to 5000, 500, and 50 gc/reaction). After nucleic acid extraction with an internal GFP control, we performed real-time RT-PCR for the detection of EEEV. In addition, we performed the singleplex real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of EEEV on RNA extracts from 5 uninfected mosquito pools and on RNA extracts from 5 EEEV-infected mosquito pools (log 10 pfu ranging from 0.4 to 4.4/0.1 mL). The assay correctly identified all specimens, showing that it is suitable for use on vector specimens as well as viral culture.
