Patients and demographic characteristics. For the surveillance period covered by this analysis, 4365 travellers presented to a CanTravNet site and were assigned totals of 4776 confirmed and 535 probable diagnoses. Among these 4365 travellers seen, 3943 (90.3%) had a definitive travel-related diagnosis (hereafter referred to as "ill returned travellers," as defined above), 363 (8.3%) had a non-travel-related diagnosis, and 59 (1.4%) had a diagnosis for which relation to travel could not be ascertained. Each of the 4365 travellers presented to 1 of 5 CanTravNet sites as follows: 1899 (43.5%) to Montreal-McGill, 1088 (24.9%) to Toronto, 850 (19.5%) to Ottawa, 320 (7.3%) to Vancouver/Victoria, and 208 (4.8%) to Montreal-Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal. The Calgary site is new to GeoSentinel (as of 2012) and therefore did not contribute any cases during the study period. Major demographic variables for the cohort of 4365 travellers are summarized in Table  1 * The cohort consisted of 3943 travellers with a definitive travel-related diagnosis, 363 with a non-travel-related diagnosis, and 59 with a diagnosis for which relation to travel could not be ascertained. † Purpose of travel was available for 4315 of the 4365 members of the cohort. ‡ Except where indicated otherwise. § Includes students (n = 111), military personnel (n = 24), and medical tourists (n = 4); does not include those for whom reason for travel was unknown (n = 50). || Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, Australia/New Zealand, and Oceania. ¶ Among those born outside of Canada, people who travelled for the purpose of visiting friends and relatives were defined as immigrants who were ethnically and/or racially distinct from the majority population in their current country of residence and who returned to their homeland to visit friends and relatives. This group also included children of foreign-born parents (i.e., second-generation immigrants) who returned to their parents' homeland to visit friends and relatives. **Interval between the end of travel and presentation at CanTravNet site. Typhi or Paratyphi (occurring in 36 ill returned travellers), were also common ( The proportion of ill returned travellers who had been visiting friends and relatives and who required inpatient management of their travel-acquired illness was approximately double that of ill returned travellers who travelled for other reasons (p < 0.001) ( Table 1) . People travelling to visit friends and relatives also had the lowest proportionate uptake of pretravel consultation among all ill returned non-immigrant travellers (p < 0.001) ( Table 1 ). In addition, these individuals travelled for longer periods than those travelling for other reasons (31 v. 19 days; p < 0.001). And, as previously mentioned, although people travelling to visit friends and relatives constituted 11.6% of the cohort described here, they accounted for more than one-third of malaria cases and almost half of cases of enteric fever due to S. enterica serotype Typhi or Paratyphi. The single case of measles in this study was imported by a person who travelled to India to visit friends and relatives. During our surveillance period, cases of highly communicable travel-acquired influenza (n = 18) and varicella (n = 1) were also reported, as was one case of Japanese encephalitis, which occurred in a tourist who went to Thailand. Table 3 summarizes the top travel-related diagnoses and source countries among those ill returned travellers who presented for care complaining of fever, skin rash, or gastrointestinal symptoms. Table 4 species of malaria, top countries of exposure, pretravel encounters, and prophylaxis status for all cases of malaria by purpose of travel. Malaria and infection with blood-borne pathogens, such as hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, were diagnosed more frequently in those who travelled to or emigrated from sub-Saharan Africa than in those who travelled to other regions (data not shown; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Vaccine-preventable diseases, such as acute and chronic hepatitis B, hepatitis A, and Japanese encephalitis, were diagnosed more frequently in those who travelled to or immigrated from South East Asia and North East Asia (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Dengue fever was diagnosed more frequently in those who travelled to the Caribbean or South East Asia (p = 0.003). Enteric fever was more likely to be acquired in South Central Asia than in other regions (p < 0.001). Only 9 cases of Chikungunya fever were diagnosed (Table 3 ).
