Demographics of recovered SARS patients at 12 years following recovery. Of the 31 recruited SARS-CoV survivors, 25 ultimately completed all study procedures, while 6 discontinued participation in the study (three dropouts, one protocol deviation, and two missing comparable healthy controls). The 25 patients that completed the study included 5 men and 20 women, with an average age of 47 years, an average body weight of 67 kg, and an average body mass index of 24 kg/m 2 , which were not significantly different from healthy volunteers ( Table 1) . None of the recovered SARS patients had smoking or drinking habits. During SARS-CoV infection, these patients had been treated with methylprednisolone at an average of 5,454 mg for a mean period of 36 days, with a maximum daily dose of 381 mg ( Table 1) . The responses to the questionnaires indicated that, since recovery, 12 of the 25 recovered SARS patients (48%) had been readmitted to hospital at least once: four had experienced osteonecrosis of the femoral head; one due to fetal death; and two had been diagnosed with hysteromyoma, one with osphyarthrosis, one with cervical spondylosis, one with a spinal cord tumor, and one with breast cancer (data not shown). Sixteen of the recovered SARS patients (64%) had suffered lung infections during the past 12 years ( Table 1 ). The susceptibility of respiratory tract was also suggested by the fact that 13 of the 25 subjects (52%) reported having had a cold at least five times in the past year, as compared with the healthy volunteers, in which all patients reported having had less than five colds in the past year (data not shown). In addition, the recovered SARS patients had a tendency to have HL (68%), CVA (44%), and AGM (60%) ( Table 1) . Urine screening detected red blood cells in 8 of the 24 SARS subjects (33%); of these, 2 patients (8%) exhibited abnormal urine protein levels. More subjects in the recovered SARS group had a neutrophil ratio and triiodothyronine levels below the normal ranges (20% and 8%, respectively) than in the healthy volunteers (12% and 0%, respectively). Similarly, as compared with the healthy volunteers, more subjects in the recovered SARS group had triglyceride (TG) levels and very low-density lipoprotein concentrations (VLDL-C) above the normal ranges (Table 1 and S1). Together with the SF-36 Health Survey (Fig. 1) , these data demonstrated that the recovered SARS patients had a poor quality of life 12 years following recovery, and were susceptible to inflammation, tumors, and glucose and lipid metabolic disorders. Altered serum metabolomes. Although no significant differences were observed in the abundance of metabolites in the urine samples of the SARS and healthy volunteers, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed significant differences in the serum metabolome between recovered SARS patients and healthy controls ( Fig. 2A) . These data points were clustered into two distinct groups in the plot map, obviously separating the recovered SARS patients and healthy controls ( Fig. 2A) . The majority of the differentially expressed metabolites, including 2,3,4-trihydroxybutyric acid, cysteine, long-chain acylcarnitine (carnitines C18:0 and C18-OH), fructose, 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene, pyroglutamic acid, and myo-inositol phosphate, were upregulated in the serum samples from recovered SARS patients compared with the healthy volunteers ( Fig. 2B ). Metabolites that were decreased in the recovered SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers included methyl esters such as 9,12-octadecadienoic acid and hexadecanoic acid, free carnitine, and arginine (Fig. 2B) . To investigate the potential metabolic disruptions in recovered SARS patients, the alterations in metabolite abundance were further associated with metabolic pathways. The levels of lactic acid derived from glycolysis were elevated in recovered SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers (Fig. 3) . Similarly, the levels of cysteine, aspartic acid, and alanine, which can be converted to pyruvic acid, as well as the levels of succinic acid, which is an intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle, were elevated in the recovered SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers. In addition, the serum levels of proline, histine, and pyroglutamic acid, which can be converted into glutamic acid and enter the TCA cycle for further energy production or substance synthesis, were increased in the SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers. While the levels of free carnitine were decreased in the SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers, the levels of carnitines C18:0 and C18-OH were increased (Fig. 3) . The ratio of carnitine (C16 + C18) to free carnitine ((C16 + C18)/C0) was also increased (Fig. 3) , which suggested that fatty acids could easily enter the mitochondria for further β-oxidation in the recovered SARS patients. The serum levels of sarcosine and spermidine were increased in recovered SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers, whereas the levels of citrulline and arginine, which are intermediates of the urea cycle, were decreased ( Fig. 4) , thus suggesting that there was an increased requirement for arginine in the urea cycle in the recovered SARS patients. Several pathways exist for the synthesis of phospholipids and neutral lipids, including fatty acid rearrangement via a remodeling process (Fig. 5A ). Serum levels of inositol-3-phosphate and PIs were significantly increased in recovered SARS patients compared with the healthy volunteers (Fig. 5A) . Additionally, the PI levels were positively correlated with the levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in recovered SARS patients ( Fig. 5B and C). Furthermore, VLDL was positively correlated with total TG in both the control and recovered SARS groups ( Fig. 5B and C). These results suggested that de novo synthesis of PIs was promoted during or after SARS-CoV infection. A cluster analysis was performed to further assess the associations among the differentially expressed lipids. In recovered SARS patients, the three LPIs ( 18:2, and LPI 20:4 were associated with their respective precursor PIs 18:0, 18:2, and 20:4 (cij = 0.68, 0.6, and 0.67, respectively). Nevertheless, FFA 20:4 was correlated with LPI 18:0/PIs (18:0/20:4) and LPI 18:0/PI 18:0 (Cij = 0.72 and 0.74, respectively), further illustrating the enhanced levels of PI remodeling in recovered SARS patients. More LPIs were produced, which was associated with the release of FFA 20:4, in recovered SARS patients compared with healthy volunteers, which may have been due to the elevated levels of PIs; thus, SARS patients may be more sensitive to PLA2 activity (Fig. 6B) . The LPI 18:0/PI 18:0 ratio was elevated, while the FFA 20:4/PI 20:4 ratio was significantly decreased, in recovered SARS patients, which indicated that more LPIs remained following PLA2 cleavage, whereas the released FFA 20:4 from PIs was rapidly used for eicosanoid synthesis (Fig. 6B ). Effect of steroid treatment on lipid metabolism. High-dose steroid treatment could contribute to the alterations of lipid metabolism in serum of recovered SARS patients. Next we investigated the short-term effects of methylprednisolone treatment on non-SARS patients with severe pneumonia. Twenty three non-SARS patients with severe pneumonia treated with steroid included 13 men and 10 women (67 ± 14 years old, 301 ± 235 mg of methylprednisolone for a mean period of 9 days). Twenty three non-SARS patients with severe pneumonia without steroid treatment included 15 men and 8 women (68 ± 8 years old). In coincidence with the former findings, the levels of detected PIs were significantly higher in steroid-treated group than those without steroid treatment (Table 3) . Although the doses of steroid used for these non-SARS patients were much less than those for SRAS patients, these results, to some extent, suggested that steroid treatment could increase levels of serum PIs.
