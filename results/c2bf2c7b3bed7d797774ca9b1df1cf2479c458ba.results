Approximately 5 minutes following release of the PAO aerosol in the general patient room, concentrations of aerosols 3.0µm increased significantly at the nursing station 9.5m away from the aerosol injection point (Figure 3) . Specifically, the average concentration of 0.5µm, 1.0µm, and 3.0µm aerosols increased by a factor of 1.90, 4.31 and 4.27, respectively, above background levels. Approximately 14 minutes following release of the PAO aerosol in the general patient room, concentrations of aerosols 3.0µm increased slightly at the isolation anteroom entrance 14.5m (Figure 4) . The average concentration of 0.5µm, 1.0µm, and 3.0µm aerosols increased by a factor of 1.35, 2.32 and 2.55, respectively, above background levels. By comparison, concentrations of aerosols >3.0µm did not increase significantly above background levels at either the nursing station or isolation anteroom entrance. Although significant transport behavior was observed in aerosols 3.0µm, changes in concentration relative to time and distance were different between 0.5µm, 1.0µm, and 3.0µm aerosols. Specifically, concentrations of 0.5µm, 1.0µm, and 3.0µm aerosols decreased on average 36.4%, 58.9% and 65.6%, respectively, every 5.0m between the general patient room entrance and nursing station, and, between the nursing station and isolation anteroom entrance. In like manner, particles migrated to the nursing station after 2.5 minutes from the injection. 21 out of 500 tracked particles (4.5%) were able to migrate out of the patient room (Table 2 ). Only 7 particles (1.4%) migrated to the nursing station and none could reach to the isolation room door way. The CFD results agreed with the experimental findings suggesting that the model was successfully simulated the particle transport mechanism. Thus, the CFD results were further analyzed to explore more details of particle behavior. Inside the patient room, almost 60% of particles were removed by the ventilation system. The deposition rate was 35% distributed over wall-, ceiling-, and floor-deposition. Statistical analysis revealed that particles traveled 44m on average (σ=18.57m). The average time particles suspended in the space was 13.7 minutes (σ =11min) and the distribution was skewed to the left (g=2.729). Moreover, the average height of particles was 1.8m (σ =0.43). The height distribution seemed to be appreciably skewed to the right (g=-1.554). More than 35% of particles were observed to be in the breathing zone (0.7m<h<1.80m) [9] which showed the propensity of particles to rise and be effectively removed by the ceiling level ventilation system.
