Herds that participated in the serologic testing for TGE were more likely to have reported a history of TGE in the previous 12 months and were less likely to have used TGE vaccines or claim freedom from TGE than nonparticipants. Participation, however, seemed to be independent of breeding herd size or operation type (Table 2) . Forty-five ( 11.5%) of the 392 blood-sampling participants reported a history of TGE in the year prior to the study. For 41145 herds, a diagnosis was made by either the herd veterinarian and/or a laboratory, although the specific methods used to establish a diagnosis were not determined. Fifty-four ( 13.8%) owners or managers considered their herds free of TGE.
