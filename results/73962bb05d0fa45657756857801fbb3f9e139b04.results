Expression profiles of pluripotent transcription factor OCT4 and TGF-β RI in human endometrial tissues The profiles of the study participants were presented in S1 Table. Compared with the control group of normal endometrium or hyperplasia, women with adenomyosis or chocolate cyst had a younger (P = .005) age and a higher level of cancer antigen (CA) 125 (P = .04). The gene expression levels of OCT4 and TGF-β RI were analyzed by qRT-PCR and were compared between the tissue samples from low-migratory normal and hyperplastic endometrium and the tissue samples from high-migratory adenomyosis and chocolate cyst tissues. As shown in Fig 1A, the OCT4 mRNA expression levels in the adenomyosis and chocolate cyst samples (ectopic endometria) were higher than those in the normal endometrium and eutopic hyperplastic endometrial samples (P < .001 for adenomyosis and P < .01 for chocolate cyst). In addition, the TGF-β RI expression levels were higher in the ectopic tissues than those in the control tissues (P < .001 for adenomyosis and P < .01 for chocolate cyst, Fig 1B) . These results demonstrated the significant increase of mRNA levels of OCT4 and TGF-β RI in ectopic endometriotic tissues. Positive correlations of mRNA levels among OCT4 and TGF-β RI and migration-related genes in human endometriotic tissues To examine the correlations among the mRNA levels of OCT4, TGF-β RI, and migrationrelated genes, ectopic chocolate cyst and adenomyosis samples were collected and analyzed for mRNA expression levels of OCT4, TGF-β RI, SNAIL, SLUG, and TWIST, using the qRT-PCR method. As shown in Fig 2, there was a positive correlation between TGF-β RI and OCT4 (Fig  2A, R = 0 .527, P < .0001), TGF-β RI and the migration-related genes (Fig 2B, R = 0 .5234, P = 0.002 for SNAIL, R = 0.5506, P < .0001 for SLUG, and R = 0.4919, P = 0.0004 for TWIST), and OCT4 and the migration-related genes (Fig 2C, R = 0 .433, P = 0.0024 for SNAIL, R = 0.4524, P < .0014 for SLUG, and R = 0.4071, P = 0.0045 for TWIST) regarding the mRNA levels. Given the fact that serum TGF-β levels are up-regulated in patients with endometriosis [19, 21, 22] , the positive correlations among OCT4, TGF-β RI, and migration-related genes suggested that TGF-β/TGF-β RI may play a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of OCT4 and migration-related genes in human endometriotic tissues.
