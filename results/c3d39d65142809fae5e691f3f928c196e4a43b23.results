The effect of heat treatment on the infectivity of CCoV was evaluated at three different temperatures, +56°C, +65°C and +75°C. At +56°C a significant decrease in infectivity was achieved after 30 min, but the virus maintained its infectivity close to the limit of detection for 60 min (Fig. 1a) . Treatment at +65°C inactivated the virus after only 5 min (10 2.0 TCID 50 /50 lL) and complete inactivation was reached after 40 min (Fig. 1b) . At +75°C infectivity was quite reduced after 5 min (10 1.0 TCID 50 /50 lL). Some infectious virus could still be detected close to the limit of detection for the end point test after 15 min, and after 30 min the virus was completely inactivated (Fig. 1c) . Exposure of CCoV to UV-C light resulted in a weak inactivation after 6 min (10 6.0 TCID 50 /50 lL) with a moderate efficiency boost after 15 min (10 5.5 TCID 50 /50 lL). No additional inactivation was observed from 15 to 24 min. UV-C light at a distance of 4 cm for 24 min had no significant effects on CCoV inactivation. Prolonged exposure time for up to 3 days modified the virus titre. A substantial decrease in CCoV infectivity was observed after the first 24 h of exposure, when an infectivity titre of 10 5.0 TCID 50 /50 lL was registered. After further 24 h, a 100-fold decrease was observed and on the third observation day (72 h) the virus had an infectivity titre of 10 2.0 TCID 50 /50 lL (Fig. 2) . The control aliquots retained infectivity during the observation period and after 72 h the infectivity titre was 10 6.0 TCID 50 /50 lL. After exposing CCoV to extreme alkaline conditions with pH 9.98, pH 11.09 and 13.2 for 1 h, and then suddenly neutralizing to pH 7, the virus was completely inactivated at +37°C, while at +25°C the aliquots exposed to pH 11.09 and pH 13.2 were inactivated and the infectivity titre of the aliquot exposed to pH 9.98 decreased considerably to 10 1.50 TCID 50 /50 lL. Interestingly, at +4°C the aliquots exposed to pH 11.09 and most of all to pH 13.2 were almost totally inactivated (10 2.75 TCID 50 /50 lL and 10 1.0 TCID 50 /50 lL, respectively), while the aliquot exposed to pH 9.98 showed no significant change in infectivity titre (10 6.0 TCID 50 /50 lL). Regardless of the temperature, slight changes in the infectivity titres were observed at a pH of 6.34 and pH 7.62. Extreme acidic conditions, such as pH 2.26, and pH 4.38 completely inactivated the virus at +37°C, but not at +25°C or +4°C, leaving the infectivity titres, respectively, at 10 4.0 TCID 50 /50 lL and 10 5.50 TCID 50 /50 lL (pH 2.26), and at 10 4.5 TCID 50 /50 lL and 10 5 TCID 50 /50 lL (pH 4.38). The effects of different pH values after incubation at 4°C, 25°C and 37°C on CCoV infectivity are shown in Fig. 3 . Formaldehyde, diluted 1:1000 (0.036%) and 1:4000 (0.009%), and glutaraldehyde, diluted 1:1000 (0.002%) and 1:2000 (0.001%), were incubated with CCoV at three different temperatures, +4°C, +25°C and +37°C, to evaluate their virus inactivating potential. At +4°C, formaldehyde 0.036% inactivated most of the virus after 24 h (10 2 TCID 50 /50 lL) and after 72 h the virus titre was close to the limit of detection of the assay (10 1 TCID 50 /50 lL). Formaldehyde 0.009% inactivated most of the virus after only 24 h (10 1 TCID 50 /50 lL). By contrast, neither of the two glutaraldehyde dilutions, 0.002% and 0.001%, was able to completely inactivate the virus at +4°C and only a reduction of the infectivity was observed (Table 1) . At +25 and +37°C, both formaldehyde dilutions inactivated most of the virus close to the limit of detection of the assay only after 24 h. Similarly, glutaraldehyde 0.002% completely inactivated the virus at +25°C and +37°C by day 1 and glutaraldehyde 0.001% by day 2 at +37°C (Table 1) .
