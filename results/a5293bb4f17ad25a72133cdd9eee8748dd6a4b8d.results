Total 1,043 episodes of EH in 621 patients were diagnosed during ten years. The number of EH episodes per patient was 1.68 (range 1 -6) , with more than one episode in 288 patients. Mean age at onset was 23.4 years, and sex ratio was M:F = 1:1.4. The patients who had recurrent episodes tend to be older (25.9 years) than those with EH episode only once (21.3 years), and there was no significant difference of sex ratio between two groups. Seasonal variation of onset was not found. Duration of treatment was 7.8 days, and most of treatment (93.7%) included systemic antiviral agent. Eleven patients were hospitalized and improved by intravenous antiviral agent, but six of them showed recurrence after discharge. Majority of patients with EH had underlying AD except only four patients. At the same period, total 33,692 patients were diagnosed as AD in our clinic, with continuous increase of prevalence annually. The ratio of EH/AD was 1.83% in average, and it was steadily decreased by years: 2.52% in 2005, 1.36% in 2014. EH was more commonly complicated in old age, showing significantly increased EH/AD ratio above 30 years old. Conclusions EH is not a rare complication of AD, affecting about 2% of AD patients. While the prevalence of AD is increased over the years, total number of EH patients was little changed, leading to slight but continuous decline of EH/AD ratio. As patients getting older, EH could be more commonly complicated in AD, and show more recurrent course than in younger patients. With premedication, 33 cases completed L-asparaginase injection with no hypersensitivity reaction. 11 cases showed mild hypersensitivity reaction, such as urticaria. Desensitization was performed in 3 cases: 2 cases were successful and in 1 case, medication was switched to Erwinia asparaginase. Ninety nine (51%) patient visited ER by oneself. Time latency from symptom onset to ER visit was 82±161.5 min. Drug (56.2%) was the most frequency suspicious cause of anaphylaxis. Cutaneous (88.7%) and respiratory (72.7%) symptoms were frequent. Hypotension was presented in 114 (58.8%) patients. 47 (24.2%) patients had history of anaphylaxis and 33 patients had same suspicious cause with current anaphylaxis. Mean observation time in ER was 12±25.7 hrs. Epinephrine was injected in 114 (62%) patients. In 68 patients, epinephrine were injected via muscle with mean dose of 0.3±0.10mg. Associated factor with injection of epinephrine in patients of anaphylaxis was hypotension (p value=0.000). Twenty four patients needed to hospitalize to ICU or ward. Auto-injective epinephrine were prescribed only in 5 patents and just 34 (19%) patients were consulted to allergist in ER and 72 (40%) patients were consulted to outpatient department of allergy. Total 60 patients were evaluated (mean age 55.7 years, range 7-96 years), 33 (55 %) were female. Twenty-eight patients (46.7%) had underlying diseases including hematologic malignancy, solid tumor cancer, HIV infection, or autoimmune diseases. Fifteen (25%) individuals were concurrently on systemic corticosteroids. The majority of subjects (49.1%) experienced maculopapular exanthems (MPE), while 36.7 % had severe cutaneous adverse reactions. The mean duration from drug intake to the onset of symptoms was 8 days and the mean interval from symptoms onset to the collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was 9.5 days. In most cases, the number of drugspecific IFN-gamma secreting cells was later analyzed with ELISPOT by incubating PBMCs with the culprit drugs or potential alternative drugs. Beta -lactams occupied 70.8% of the analysis. Penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems were the most frequently suspected compounds. The number of drug-specific IFN-gamma secreting cells more than 20 spot-forming cells/10 6 (PBMCs) was considered a positive test. Among those examined for responsible drugs, 22 of 48 tests (45.8%) yielded positivity. The proportion of positive outcomes was 66.7% in acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, 46.2% in MPE, 40.0% in drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and lowest in Stevens Johnson syndrome (16.6%). Subsequently, twenty-four persons underwent drug challenges test. All were able to tolerate their alternative medications of which ELISPOT displayed negative results. Antigen extracted from maize seeds contained 4.5±0.7 mg/ml protein. The extract was subjected to SDS protein profile with 12 protein bands in molecular weight range of 152 -10 kD. Five protein fractions of 68, 38, 25, 14 & 10 kD are recorded as stable under 60 min of simulated gastric fluid (SGF) digestion assay. Using clinically maize positive patient sera and significantly raised maize specific IgE titer and IgE binding activity of 28 kD protein smear is recorded. Cross Inhibition studies suggested cross reactivity reactivity of maize with rice, on account of the complete disappearance of observed 28 kD immunoreactive protein smear. However biochemical characterization of the smear corresponds to two protein bands of 25kD and 19 kD on 1D gel which on MS spectra are observed with hypothetical molecular weight of 14.3 kD and 11.6 kD, sharing sequence homology greater than 41% with un annotated rice seed proteins in database. Of the 561 children, 217 children showed allergic rhinitis symptoms during past 12 months and 283 children showed positive skin prick test to at least one allergen. Serum periostin level was not differ between allergic sensitization group and control group (49.98 ± 12.98 vs 49.47 ± 13.58). When we divided all subject into 4 groups; control (A; n=124), sensitization without allergic rhinitis symptoms (B; n=52), allergic symptoms without sensitization (C; n=36), and allergic rhinitis symptoms with sensitization (D; n=72). There were no statistical difference of mean value between 4 groups (A-D; 47.81 ± 13.66, 44.56 ± 11.68, 49.38 ± 15.51, and 47.26 ± 11.4) . Also, we could not find the significant association between serum periostin and allergic rhinitis in multivariate analysis. When the preoperative and postoperative results were compared, postoperative scores for sleep related symptoms were significantly improved from preoperative scores in both groups. The history of frequent URI and antibiotic therapy after surgery was no significant differences between two groups. The improvements of nasal symptoms including nasal obstruction, were significantly higher in nonallergic group (p<0.01). The adenoid regrowth rate was slightly higher in non-allergic group (p<0.05). Alternaria and Aspergillus enhanced extracellular matrix mRNA expression from nasal polyp fibroblasts about 2.4 to 7.1 times than normal control. However, only Alternaria induced the production of eosinophil peroxide and superoxide from eosinophils. Co-culture of activated eosinophils with fungi and nasal fibroblasts enhanced extracellular matrix mRNA expression 1.8 to 2.6 times than cocultured with non-activated eosinophil group. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 109 recurrent wheezing children and 70 non-wheezing children. Compared with control group, the wheezing children were higher positive rate for total detective virus (53.2% vs15.7%, χ 2 =25.3, P<0.01), RV (31.2% vs 12.9%, χ 2 =7.9, P=0.005) and RSV(19.3% vs 4.3%, χ 2 =8.2, P=0.004). The positive rates of RV was higher in toddler wheezing than infant wheezing group (44.8% vs 20.0%, χ 2 =6.0, P=0.015). The EOS count was 0.38 (0.12-0.57) *10^9/ L in RV-positive wheezing children, which was much higher than that in other virus-positive cases 0.21 (0.07-0.38) *10^9/ L (U=252, P=0.04). Compared with other virus-positive cases, RV-positive wheezing children have higher LYMP and WBC counts (P<0.05). There was no different between virus-negative and viruspositive cases in the symptoms of wheezing, coughing and nasal in from of 4 weeks follow-up (P>0.05). Dietary folate intake was a protective factor for wheezing symptoms in the past 12 months (aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.91) and asthma diagnosis (aOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.53-0.99) and vitamin B6 was also related to reduced risk of allergen sensitization (aOR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.56-0.99). High intake of folate, vitamin B2 and vitamin B6 was a protective factor for allergen sensitization [(aOR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.93), (aOR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.26-0.95) and (aOR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21-0.76), respectively] and atopic wheezing symptoms in the past 12 months [(aOR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0,04-0.80), (aOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0,07-1.01) and (aOR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0,07-0.99), respectively], especially in CT or TT genotype at nucleotide 677T MTHFR compared to those with low intake and CC at this position. The data confirm the delayed colonization of Bifidobacterium in Csection delivered infants. The synbiotic supplementation resulted in a significant higher proportion of bifidobacteria from the first days of life (p=0.006) and this bifidogenic effect remained significant until 1 month of age (p=0.029) compared to the control group. The prebiotic group showed a significant bifidogenic effect at age 1 month (p=0.048) compared to the control group. In the synbiotic arm, B. breve M-16V was still detected in 37 % of the infants at week 22 indicating a persistence of the probiotic strain. A significant lower faecal pH and a higher acetate level were observed in the synbiotic group from the first days of life and this remained significant until 1 month of age compared to the control group. A lower number of subjects with adverse events of eczema/atopic dermatitis was reported in the synbiotic group (n=3) compared to the control (n=10), and prebiotic group (n=9), after correction for family allergy history. Among 627 subjects, the number of boys are 305(48.6%). Most of the infants went to bed at about 21.80±1.72 hours at night and woke up at around 7.41±1.55 hours in the morning. The night sleep time duration was 9.43±1.75 hours, and the total sleep time for a day was 12.62±2.62 hours. 0-6 months old children group had less nighttime sleep duration (8.90±2.13 vs 9.78±1.23 vs 10.07±1.01, hours, p< 0.05) and more daytime sleep duration (4.30±2.49 vs 2.51±1.05 vs 2.36±1.23, hours, p< 0.05) than older children. There were no significant differences in number of night-waking between 0-6 months old children group and 7-12 months old children group, but 13-18 months old children group had significant less frequent night-waking (2.45±1.58 vs 2.38±1.59 vs 1.70±1.41). More than half of children in this survey sleep in their parents' bed (59.8%), and most common bedtime routine was milk feeding until sleep (37.1%), and the second one was cradling (29.0%). Filaggrin immunoreactivity was detected in epithelial cells and inflammatory cells. The number of Filaggrin+ cells in the epithelium of patients with NP was significantly higher than that in the nasal mucosa of the AR patients. The number of filaggrin+ cells in the lamina propria of patients with NP was significantly higher than that in the nasal mucosa of the AR patients. There was no difference in the number of filaggrin+ cells between nasal polyps from atopic and non-atopic patients. Periostin immunoreactivity was mainly detected in the basement membrane and the density of immunoreactivity of periostin in NP was significantly higher in NP than in the nasal mucosa of the AR patients. TSLP was detected in epithelial cells and in immune cells and greater in NP than AR mucosa. There was no difference in the density of immunoreactivity of periostin between NP from atopic and non-atopic patients. IL-13+ cells and IL-33 expression were also higher in NPs and there was a good correlation between the IL-13+ cells and periostin. The prevalence of current AR in preschool age was 23.0% (392 out of 1702) and atopic current AR was 9.65% (93 out of 964 Vitamin D deficiency has been declared a public health problem for both adults and children worldwide. The growing data suggests that vitamin D deficiency plays an important role in the development of childhood asthma. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential relationship between asthma exacerbation severity and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in children. The 49 patients were 28 boys and 21 girls, mean age 5.28±2.28 years old. According to GINA assessment of asthma exacerbation, 20 (40.82%) children were enrolled in mild exacerbation group, 15 (30.61%) children were enrolled in moderate exacerbation group and 14 (28.57%) children were enrolled in severe exacerbation group. There was no significant differences in age, height and weight among the three groups (p>0.05). The concentration of serum 25hydroxy vitamin D in mild, moderate and severe exacerbation groups was 35.77±13.64 nmol/L, 15.30±4.97 nmol/L and 13.87±3.33 nmol/L separately. The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D of mild exacerbation group is significantly higher than moderate and severe exacerbation groups. But no significance was found between moderate and severe exacerbation groups. Among 11 patients, 9 (81.8%) were male and the average age of patients at beginning of the study was 6.2 years old (range, 5-11 years). All patients completed buildup phase successfully. One patient discontinued the maintenance phase for personal reason. Ten patients completed maintenance phase successfully and became desensitized. They are now consuming wheat products freely without any complications. Threshold doses in the wheat DBPCFC was from 0.08 g to 1.3 g of wheat protein. Build up phase continued in 3 to 7 days. Eight of 11 patients showed symptoms (72.7%) during this period, the total number of doses were 101 in which 25 of applied doses (24.8%) showed symptoms which mostly were mild reactions. Number of epinephrine that we took advantage was 9 in total 101 applied doses (8.9%). During maintenance phase seven patients showed mild reaction in first month of maintenance phase. The total number of doses in maintenance phase was 900 in which 52 of applied doses (5.8%) showed mild symptoms. In the AERD, 4 clusters having good quality (0.7 silhouette) were obtained according to the urticarial, CRS and atopy: cluster 1 (AERD with CRS and atopy, and without urticaria), cluster 2 (AERD with only CRS), cluster 3 (AERD with only atopy) and cluster 4 (AERD with urticaria). There were significantly difference in severe asthma (27.3%, 14.8%, 19.7% and 7.7% in cluster 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively, p=0.042), total IgE (564.3±732.5, 216.5±266.4, 352.0±398.7 and 345.5±440.7, p<0.001), sputum eosinophil (%)(31.5±37.8, 29.4±39.7, 13.4±27.3 and 18.7±30.9, p=0.024), and peripheral eosinophil count (485.0±374.8, 523.0±561.4, 349.3±379.3 and 245.1±242.5, p<0.001). The occurrence of severe exacerbation was significant higher in cluster 1 than cluster 3 (OR: 2.121 (1.281-3.510), p=0.004). The patients of cluster 1 showed significantly higher possession rate of ICS+LABA than cluster 2, 3 and 4 (p<0.05), and of OCS than cluster 3 (p=0.010). The possession rate of LTRA was significantly higher in cluster 1 and 2 (vs. cluster 3 and 4, p<0.05). The possession rate of anti-histamines was significantly lower in cluster 3 (vs. 1,2 and 3, p<0.05). The identity of the three purified proteins was confirmed by MS and concentrations ranging from 0.3 -1 mg/ml were determined by AAA. CD revealed partially intact secondary structural elements of the proteins, resembling the modeled structures. While for Per a 2 and Per a 3 a sensitization frequency of 50 -92% was observed in ELISA experiments, reactivity to Per a 1 was limited in the tested patients' cohort. There were 271 cases of anaphylaxis identified, making up 7% of all ED visits for allergy-related symptoms. The median age was 22 years (range 5 months-89 years). Children (below 16 years) made up 35% (94/271) of the cohort, with 139 males (51%). Patient ethnicity included Chinese (180 cases, 66%), Malay (44, 16%), Indian (18, 7%) and others (29, 11%). The most common trigger was food (n=126, 46%), followed by drugs (n=50, 18%) and stinging insects (n=14, 5%). The trigger could not be identified at initial presentation in 62 cases (23%). The most common food allergen was shellfish (n=36, 29%), followed by peanuts and other nuts (n=16, 13%). There were 2 new cases of galactooligosaccharide allergy that were confirmed on follow-up. Age distribution varied with the triggering factor. Those with druginduced anaphylaxis were older than those with food allergy (mean age 32.5 vs 24.5 years, p = 0.015). All cases of insect-related anaphylaxis occurred in adults (age range 22-68 years). The cases of shellfish anaphylaxis were older than those with peanut/tree-nut anaphylaxis [mean 29.7 years (range 6-75, SD 19.7 years) vs mean 14.2 years (range 2-51, SD 13.9 years); p = 0.006]. The hospitalization rate was 52%. On both univariate and multiple regression analysis, the only significant factor associated with hospitalization was the age of the patient (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.169, p=0.006). Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency when using 20 ng/ml cut-off, was 24 % (95% CI 14.9%-32.0%). A further 32% of the infants had insufficient levels of vitamin D and 45% of the infants were replete. There were no cases of secondary hyperparathyroidism with vitamin D level above 40ng/ml and one case had an elevated PTH with vitamin D level above 30ng/ml. Using 30ng/ml as the "presumed normal" cutoff for this population, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency doubled to 55%. Only four mothers received vitamin D supplementation during breastfeeding and all their infants were vitamin D replete. Less than 5% of the study population had skeletal signs of rickets. Conclusion Prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency is high in this very young population despite the abundnce of sunshine in this geographical region. A policy on vitamin D supplementation is recommended in this population to mitigate the impact of vitamin D deficiency especially on chronic non-communicable diseases.  The study analyzed the histories of 79 patients with contact eczema: 61 women in age 18-83 years (mean age 46.5 years) and 18 men in age 22-80 years (mean age 54.3 years). The most common locations of contact eczema were hands (n = 28; 35.4%) and faces (n = 22; 27.8%). Positive patch tests results were obtained in 29 (36.7%) patients, the majority in patients with hands (n = 12; 42.8%) and faces (n = 6; 27.2%) contact eczema. The most common sensitizing haptens were nickel sulfate (n = 16, 55.1%), para-phenylenediamine (n = 13; 44.8%) and potassium dichromate (n = 12; 41.3%). Prick tests with inhalant allergens were performed in 65 patients and with food allergens were performed in 29 patients. In 27 (41.5%) patients were registered positive skin prick tests results to inhaled allergens, in the majority of patients with hands (n = 13; 20%), faces (n = 7; 10.7%) and the upper limb (n = 4; 6.1%) contact eczema. Food allergy was diagnosed in 6 (20.6%) patients, 2 (33%) of patients were with hands, faces and feet contact eczema. Among the inhaled allergens, the most sensitizing were D. Farinae, D. Pteronyssimus and grass, while the most sensitizing food allergens were celery, pepper and flour. With this case, we wanted to point out that ornidazole, a commonly used anti-infection agent, can be the cause of fixed drug eruption in some cases. Also, it should be noted that fixed drug eruptions can occur for multiple drugs in the same patient. Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by skin barrier dysfunction. Few studies have used non-invasive skin measurement techniques to measure epidermis function in asymptomatic neonates. We therefore conducted a post-hoc analysis to determine whether skin barrier function in the first week of life predicted AD development and allergen sensitizationby age 32 weeks. The Background: The effective management of atopic dermatitis (AD) adjusted to individual clinical courses and demands can be challenging for both patients and physicians. Understanding of actual situations, experienced and perceived by patients with AD and their caregivers, is essential to improve clinical outcomes and satisfaction in real practice. Methods: This multi-center survey was conducted in patients with AD or their caregivers from 9 centers with questionnaires on diagnosis and management of AD. Results: A total of 324 patients and caregivers participated in the study. Initial diagnosis of AD was mostly made by physicians (80.6 %), followed by self-diagnosis. Patients and caregivers believe that allergic substances such as house dust mite, food, pollution are responsible for AD development. Allergy tests were performed for 194 patients (59.9%), but allergen avoidance strategy was instructed in only 81 subjects (25.0%). Regarding the measures of AD management, they thought that moisturization, environmental control, improvement of body constitution are important. Major topical medications are steroid (81.8%) and topical immunomodulators (34.3%), while systemic medications include systemic steroid (42.6 %), anti-histamines (36.4 %), and cyclosporins (2.8 %) . 181(55.9%) subjects have tried complementary alternative medicine including Oriental medicine. Many subjects wished for personalized management, use of specialized institutions for AD, and evidence-based, effective, and sustainable treatment to be incorporated in their sessions. Conclusion: Our findings suggest there is still an unmet healthcare need for patients with AD in real practice. Customized, evidencebased, and multi-disciplinary approach including therapeutic patient education should be implemented to achieve the best possible outcomes. A) Background: To evaluate the IgE reactivity profiles to purified house dust mite (HDM) allergen molecules (i.e. nDer p 1, rDer p 2 and rDer p 10) in Korean allergic rhinitis (AR) patients. Also, symptomatic and serologic changes after sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) were analyzed according to positive IgE profiles. B) Methods: Sixty AR patients already diagnosed to have HDM allergy were analyzed for the presence IgE antibodies against nDer p 1, rDer p 2, rDer p 10 and native Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp). Symptom scores and laboratory tests were followedup after SLIT. C) Results: Prevalence rates of IgE for Dp, Der p 1, Der p 2 and Der p 10 were 100%, 98.3%, 93.3% and 8.3%, respectively. After one year of SLIT, symptom scores and laboratory findings improved but did not show significant difference between Der p 10-positive and -negative patients. D) Conclusions: In Korean AR patients, specific IgE to Der p 1 or Der p 2 presents in most of Dp-allergic patients, while reactivity to Der p 10 is very low. Changes in symptom and serology after SLIT (not containing the allergen Der p 10) did not differ much between Der p 10-positive and -negative patients. Background A history of beta-lactam (BL) hypersensitivity is one of the most encountered problems in clinical practice and limits its further use. Determining whether patients with BL allergy could safely receive beta-lactams can be a difficult task. We summarize data from patients with a presumed allergic history to BL who underwent drug allergy verification and report the actual allergic rate. The respondents were comprised of nurse teachers (44%), general education teachers (32%), nutrition teachers (5%), assistant principals (10%) and principals (10%). Those who were negative about administering AAI to students accounted for 10.8% of total. The percentage differed significantly between different specialties/positions; nutrition teachers had the highest percentage (16.7%), followed by general education teachers (15.9%), nurse teachers (10.6%), assistant principals (8.1%) and principals (2.7%). The most frequent factor behind the uneasiness about the use of AAI was "the timing of AAI administration" (69.4%). By teaching specialty/position, a greater number of nurse teachers were concerned about "collaborating within the school" and "collaborating with a hospital" than teachers in other specialties/positions. Comparing between the group with negative attitudes and the group with positive attitudes toward AAI administration, the former was significantly more worried about "how to use AAI" (odds ratio [OR]: 2.1), "the timing of AAI administration" (OR: 02.9), "collaborating with the parents" (OR: 01.6), "the act of injection itself" (OR: 3.1) and "violating the laws" (OR: 3.5). We enrolled 51 hospitalized infants, all under 12 months old (3.79±2.64 months of age) and 66% were male (n=34). Mean body weight at admission was 7.11±1.88 kg. The mean (±SD) duration of hospitalization was 5.67 ±2.2 days and it had positive relation with BSS (P<0.05). There were significant association between BSS and maternal allergy, height and age (p<0.05). However, no significant association was observed between BSS and body weight, amount of increased weight from birth and infected virus. The causes of anaphylaxis were food (77.9%), drug (10.3%) and idiopathic (11.8%). The involved organs were cutaneous (88.2%), respiratory (80.9%), cardiovascular (20.6%), and gastrointestinal tract (14.7%). Patients were treated with systemic steroid (92.6%), antihistamine (88.2%) and epinephrine (76.5%). 53 (77.9%) patients revisited our pediatric allergy clinic and epinephrine auto-injectors were prescribed for 25 (36.8%) patients. When we compared the correlation coefficient between 'A' and ImmunoCAP-test of 5 antigens including D.farinae, D.pteronyssinus, soyben, cow milk and white egg, results of cow milk, D.farinae, D.pteronyssinus antigens were significantly matched. Moderate strength of agreement was found in egg white and fair agreement was observed in wheat. However, only D.farinae and D.pteronyssinusresults from 'B' showed significant agreement strength with CAP-test and other 4 antigens only had slight agreements. The level of serum IL-13 and IL-17A in asthmatics is significantly higher than control (P<0.001). There was a positive relationship between the level of serum IL-17A and the severity of asthma (r s =0.369, P<0.001).The level of serum IL-17A between control and chronic persistent, control and exacerbation, chronic persistent and exacerbation are significantly different (P<0.001). The level of serum IL-13 in allergic asthmatic and non-allergic asthmatic are significantly different (Z=-2.655, P<0.01), but there is no difference in the level of serum IL-17A(P>0.05). There is a positive relationship between the level of serum IL-17A and neutrophils in asthmatic children (r s =0.216, P=0.047). There is a positive relationship between the level of serum IL-13 and sIgE of inhaled allergens (r s =0.343, P<0.01). There is no relationship between the level of serum IL-13 or IL-17A and lung function or FeNO. In severe asthmatic children, there is a positive relationship between the level of serum IL-13 and the level of serum IL-17A (r s =0.395, P<0.05). Vitamine D levels were positive correlated with fat free mass index (FFMI), skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) in COPD. (P= 0.010, 0.008, 0.016) However, PTH showed correlation with ASMI only. (P= 0.012) In logistic regression, vitamine D level revealed association with FFMI, SMI, ASMI, which showed lowest P value in ASMI. (P= 0.002, 0.001, <0.001) When classified according to vitamine D level, in deficiency group, prevalence of sarcopenia was higher with trend according to the vitamine D levels. (P <0.001) Using multivariant logistic regression analyses, in deficiency group, the sarcopenia risk increased in which the criteria recommended in EWGSOP and AWGS with the ASMI. (OR 2.519 , P= 0.003; OR 2.066 P= 0.014). Serum eosinophil fraction (Cut off value 3.8%) was associated with the newly developed allergic symptoms (sensitivity 41.8, specificity 77.9; Odd ratio 2.424, p = 0.006). Higher serum total IgE (cut off value 17.7 IU/ml) was also associated with the risk of allergic sensitization (sensitivity 85.3, specificity 46.0; Odd Ratio 4.848, p<0.001). Over a 4-year period (2010-2014), 127 patients with mean +/− SD age, 40.7 +/− 15.2 year, underwent a total of 155 open-labelled labelled NSAIDs oral provocation tests (OPT). Patients demographics consisted of female (63.8%, 81) with majority Chinese ethnic group (80.3%, 102). Diclofenac (20.2%) and Naproxen (19.7%) were the two commonest reported culprits NSAIDs. In 32 (25.2%) patients, more than 2 eliciting NSAIDs were recorded to cause hypersensitivity reactions. However, 27 (21.3%) patients reported to tolerate different groups of NSAIDs and 40 (31.5%) had concomitant intolerance to Acetaminophen. Urticaria and/or angioedema were the most frequently reported symptom (87.3%), among which 60.6% were isolated periorbital angioedema. Reaction involving the airways i.e., asthma with or without a naso-occular symptoms were rare (7%). Anaphylaxis was reported by 4(3.1%) patients together with other concomitant drugs. Breakdown for 155 challenges was as follows: 68 (43.9%) Putative NSAIDS challenge, 29 (18.7%) Aspirin challenge and 58 (37.4%) selective COX-2 inhibitor challenge. Overall positive challenge rate was 24.5% (38 out of 155). Despite having a clinical relevant history of causative, only 29.4% (20 out of 68) had positive OPT to putative NSAIDs. Aspirin challenge resulted in 48.3% (14 out of 29) positive challenge, hence confirming the diagnosis of NSAIDS intolerance. Using selective COX-2 inhibitor challenge, we found only 6.9% (4 out of 54) positive challenge. For the anaphylaxis cases, cautious OPT with putative NSAIDS were done in 75% (3 out of 4) patients. No reaction was found. In phase 1, the questionnaires were distributed to 96 trainees. The response was 98% (94 responses), 55 females and 39 males. 84 trainees (89% ) reported knowing how to treat and a total of 44 (50%) claimed not being trained at all. Epinephrine was selected as a life saving drug by 89 (94%). IM as a route of administration was selected by 76 (80%). Correct Epinephrine concentration was known by 77 (83%). For phase 2, questionnaires were distributed to 94 trainees who responded to the stage 1 and the response rate was 89% (84). 84% claimed they heard about Epinephrine Autoinjector, 5 fellows claimed they never heard about it. 72% claimed knowing when to use it .23 (27%) did not know, 9 of them were Fellows. Anaphylaxis was the case of using it in 71%. Only 43 (51%) know the right location and the method of injection. Sub Cutaneous injection was selected in 20 (23.8%). In the AR group, 43/132 (32.6%) patients presented a positive response to NPT. In the NAR group, 11/69 (15.9%) patients had a positive response to NPT. NPT was negative in 17/18 healthy controls (94.4%). The majority of rhinitis patients had moderate-severe nasal symptoms. LAR and AR subjects had a similar pattern of nasal symptoms in frequency and severity. However, significant differences were detected between LAR and NAR. Conclusion Local allergic rhinitis is a prevalent entity in patients evaluated with rhinitis. LAR and AR subjects had a similar pattern of nasal symptoms in frequency and severity. Conventional skin tests were significantly well correlated with nasal provocation tests. Background. The role of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) in the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) is quite controversial, since its efficacy has been poorly investigated in the past years and eczema exacerbations have been reported following AIT. We investigated the tolerability of hypoallergenic AIT, its benefit on eczema and its influence on the progression of the allergic disease. Methods. This study included 12-55-year-old patients with severe AD (SCORAD >36) monosensitized to house dust mites (HDM) but without diagnostic criteria for rhinitis, asthma and food allergy at baseline. 22 subjects were treated in a continuous way for 5 years with sublingual tablets of carbamylated monomeric allergoid extract of HDM (2000 AU/week) and compared with 21 subjects treated with cetirizine 10mg daily. Topical and short course of oral steroids on demand were allowed and counted. The main endpoint was the change in SCORAD score at different time-points up to 10 years after AIT discontinuation. In addition, to assess the disease progression, data on respiratory symptoms and related medications were collected during mite exposition period, with lung function, bronchial hypereactivity, nasal eosinophils, onset of on new sensitizations. The occurrence of local or systemic adverse reactions was registered. The positive rates of ten kinds of food sIgG antibody from high to low are milks and dairy products (33.03%), crustaceans (27.89%), meats and egg (19.31%), legumes (16.3%), fishes (15.56%), others (8.18%), vegetables (7.63%), nuts and oilseeds (6.70%), cereals (5.31%), the lowest is fruits (4.34%); the highest positive rate of food is egg (64.60%), followed by the white soft cheese (56.70%), cow's milk (54.30%). In 0~3 years old group, the leading kind of positive rate of food is milks and dairy products 71.02%, decreasing with the age, in ≥60 years old group, the positive rate is 6.25%, which is the biggest change in ten categories of food according to age. Except ≥60 years old group, the positive rate of cow's milk sIgG is higher than the goat's milk sIgG, p<0.05. The positive tate of crustaceans is increasing with the age groups, scallop is the leading food in crustaceans in 7~16,17~44,45~59 and ≥60years old groups, the positive rates are 38.30%, 78.72%, 75.41% and 84.62%, respectively. The leading food of cereals is sesame in each group. In others food, the leaing food is sugar, the positive rate is 30.30% in 0~3years old and 34.88% in 4~6years old, in 7~16years old group, the leading food is coffee 29.79%, in ≥60 years old group, the leading food is tobacco 38.46%. In 0~3 and 45~59 years old group, the positive rate of sIgG antibody of different categories of food were not statistically different in gender, in 4~6 years old group, the positive rate of cereals, fruits, vegetables of male are higher than female (x 2 =7.068, p=.003; x 2 =4.850, p=.031;x 2 =4.135, p=.042), in 7~16 years old group, the positive rates of vegetables and crustaceans of male are higher than female (x 2 =5.011, p=.026; x 2 =5.491, p=.019), in 17~44 years old group, the positive rates of vegetables of female are higher than male (x 2 =8.445, p=.004), in ≥60years old group, the positive rates of cereals, nuts and oilseeds, vegetables, milks and dairy products, fishes of male are higher than female (x 2 =3.902, p=.048; x 2 =6.836, p=.006; x 2 =16.228, p=.000;x 2 =6.163, p=.011;x 2 =8.123, p=.003). A lot of food sIgG antibody levels are associated, there are 51 couples of food highly correlated (r s =0.8), including 34 couples of vegetables, 2 couples of fruit and vegetable. Fourteen children hospitalized with asthma were enrolled in this study from October 2014 to April 2015. Ten (71.4%) admitted from emergency department and 4 (28.6%) from outpatient clinic. The numbers of children with asthma who visited at that period were 368 visits at emergency department and 92 visits at outpatient clinic. We found 12 (85.7%) with moderate exacerbation, and 2 (14.3%) with mild exacerbation. Seven of 14 (50%) were referred as severe exacerbation to our emergency department, but after we do reassessment they were moderate exacerbation. Moderate exacerbation with frequent asthma was 10 (71,4%) of all the cases. Most of our subjects were male 9 (64.3%), aged between 2 and under 5 years old about 7 (50%), normal nutrition status 9 (64.3%), first asthma diagnosis at 2 years old in 6 (42.9%) cases, history of hospitalization before 8 (57.1%), used controller 1 (7.1%), history of atopic 9 (64.3%) and history of asthma in family 5 (35.7%), other allergic disease 3 (21.4%), feathered pet 4 (28.6%), cigarette smoking 8 (57.1%). The triggers for the asthma exacerbation were exercise 5 (35.7%), respiratory infection 4 (28.6%), cold weather 2 (14.3%), house dust 2 (14.3%), and food 1 (7.1%). The results showed HND patients comprising approximately 2.4% of AD patients in an outpatient clinic setting. Compared to N-HND patients, HND initially presented with more severe disease status and elevated serum total IgE and serum specific IgE eactivity to dermatophagoides farinae. Histologically, HND specimen showed thickened epidermis with increased vascular components and dermal inflammatory infiltrates staining positive to pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Lastly, the microbiome analysis of HND in comparison to N-HND AD and NL subjects revealed presence of diverse community present in the skin. The serum concentrations of folliculin were significantly higher in asthmatics (148.92± 240.71 vs 73.57± 78.34 pg/ml, p < 0.001) than in healthy controls. We found negative correlation between serum folliculin level and post bronchodilator FEV1 (R=-0.228, p = 0.00) and post bronchodilator FEV1/FVC (R=-0.155, p = 0.00). The high-folliculin group was older at onset of asthma (65.01±88.08 vs 97.12±121.88 months, P= 0.007), had heavier history of smoking (7.90 vs 13.08 pack-years, p= 0.011), presented more frequent exacerbations (0.36/3months vs 0.57/ 3months, p=0.041), and showed lower FEV1 % predicted (73.63 vs 66.65, p=0.00). In the immediate-type hypersensitivity reaction group, we found signification associations with a total of 11 genes, whereas five genes showed signification association in the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction group. The top 5 SNPs were rs17732181, rs12674658, rs10463158, rs10028040, and rs1330221 in the immediate-type hypersensitivity groups. As well, rs10028040, rs17732181, rs10463158, rs28786672, and rs12674658 have also been identified in the delayed-type hypersensitivity groups. Interestingly, there were two genes that overlapped in the two groups, namely, the Lipopolysaccharide-Responsive Beige-like Anchor (LRBA) gene and the Methionine adenosyltransferase 2 beta (MAT2B) gene. Associations with the SNPs of these genes were commonly found in both immediate and delayed type hypersensitivity reactions (rs10028040 of LRBA, P = 5.63 x 10 -14 , P = 7.19 x 10 -12 respectively, and rs10463158 of MAT2B, P = 6.40 x 10 -12 , P = 5.25 x 10 -12 respectively). Lifestyle: Ratio of over 4 points was 48.6% in Q1 and 12.2 %, 2.7%, 10.8%, 9.5%, 18.9% in Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5 and Q6. Attitudes and Beliefs: Ratio of below 2 points was 83.8% in Q7 and 63.5% in Q8. Help from Others: Ratio of below 2 points was 55.4% in Q9. Talking with Healthcare Team: Ratio of below 2 points was 87.8%, 89.2%, 87.8% in Q10, Q11 and Q12. Talking Medicines: Ratio of over 4 points in Q13, Q14 and Q15 was each 36.5%, 21.6% and 5.4%. Have You…: Ratio of over 4 points in Q16, Q17, Q18, Q19 and Q20 was each 31.1%, 5.4%, 4.1%, 1.4% and 27.5%. Sputum IL-32 levels was well correlated with FEV 1 (%) in the total study subjects (r=-0.232, P = 0.006) and in the stable asthmatics (r=-0.312, P = 0.003). The levels was not different by use of inhaled steroid (P=0.068). When the all subjects were grouped into two inflammatory patterns by eosinophil% (over 3%, under 3%) or Neutrophils% (over 70%, under 70%), IL-32 levels was not different by the inflammatory patterns. IL-32 levels was significantly increased in the subject experiencing exacerbation (n=69) compared to those not experiencing exacerbation (n=53) (p<0.05). The sputum levels of IL-32 were well correlated with the annual rate of exacerbation in the total subjects.(r=0.231, P < 0.022). Conclusion Sputum IL-32 may be associated with severity of the asthma regardless of inhaled steroid treatment, and may be a surrogate marker for exacerbation risk of asthma. Background: Chromium allergy has been traditionally caused by occupational skin contact with cement and related construction materials, which involves hands most commonly. Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics of patients with chromium allergy in Korea. Methods: Patch test data from June 1998 to January 2014 were retrospectively analyzed (n=975; male=289, female=686). Patients who showed positive reactions to potassium dichromate (chromium (+) group; n=58) and who showed positive reactions to other allergens except potassium dichromate (others (+) group; n=497) were identified and the characteristics of both groups were compared. The prevalence of chromium allergy was additionally analyzed in each 4year period to study the change over time. Results: The sensitization rate of potassium dichromate was 5.9% (n=58) and women comprised 72.4% (n=42) of chromium (+) group. Hands and feet were more frequently affected in chromium (+) group (P=0.002, 0.019). Occupational dermatitis was not significantly more common in chromium (+) group. Chromium allergy was most prevalent in patients in their 50s (8.4%). The prevalence of chromium allergy was 13.5% during 1998-2002 but decreased to 5.4% during 2010-2014. Conclusion: The characteristics of patients with chromium allergy suggested that chromium exposure in daily activities, including leather exopsure, is more relevant than occupational exposure in most patients. The prevalence of chromium allergy has been decreased in Korea, which may be an effect of voluntary regulation of chromium extent in cement by manufacturers A) Background: Chronic hand eczema (CHE) may severely reduce patient's quality of life. CHE refractory to topical corticosteroids currently have limited treatment options suited for chronic use. In demand of safe new therapy, oral alitretinoin, 9-cisretinoic acid, was proposed, but the economic burden limits its broad use. Acitretin is a well-known second generation vitamin A derivative, widely used in palmoplantar psoriasis with less cost. The investigation was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of acitretin in chronic hand eczema patients. B) Methods: Total of 25 patients diagnosed with CHE were enrolled in the prospective open-label study. All patients were administered with oral acitretin, start dose of 10mg twice daily and tapered to 10mg once daily, during 8 week period. CHE severity was evaluated using a hand eczema severity index and 5-grade physicial global assessment (PGA). C) Results: Severity of hand eczema decreased by 58% in average. The improvement was more remarkable in hyperkeratotic type than other types of hand eczema (p<0.004). Clinical responses, defined as clear or almost clear, were achieved in up to 36% of patients. No serious side effects were reported except of mild cheilitis in 2 patients and abdominal discomfort in 1 patients. D) Conclusion: Oral acitretin is well-tolerated with effectively improving chronic hand eczema, especially in hyperkeratotic type. This test is useful for the cross reaction of an allergy patient sensitized to a large number of allergens, the grasp of the sensitization pattern with the common antigen. Younger patients, who are under 14y.o, had the lower number of positive components than that of over 14y.o. Tick, cat and dog related components were characteristic patients with dermatitis. Result of exclude the tick, cat and dog related components, number of positive components of patients with AD or eczema (contact dermatitis and PPP) were higher than with no dermatitis. The most common disease in Group 1 is seasonal allergic rhinitis (44.7%), followed by vasomotor rhinitis (28.9%) and perennial allergic rhinitis (21.1%). Group 2 has the same tendency as Group 1 (seasonal allergic rhinitis (47.1%), vasomotor rhinitis (29.4%), perennial allergic rhinitis (23.5%)). Group 3 and Group4 have small number of patients. It is difficult to calculate the percentage of diseases in both groups, but seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis were tending to have high relevance. Next, we evaluated the relationship between the level of non-specific IgE and the relevance of diseases. In Group 4, the relevance of chronic sinusitis and perennial allergic rhinitis was significantly higher than Group 1. Eosinophilic sinusitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis, and vasomotor rhinitis had no significant differences. The patient was issued an adrenalin auto-injection certificate. He was instructed about auto injection technique. He was adviced not to ever consume prawn from now on. He was also adviced to be cautious about restaurants serving prawn since certain kitchen equipments might be contaminated with prawn particles. Background: The increasing prevalence of allergic disease has been attributed in part to reduced microbial exposures associated with a modern lifestyle. An altered compositional signature and reduced diversity of the intestinal microbiota are linked to development of allergic disease. We investigated the relationship between dominant Bifidobacteriumspecies in stool during the early postnatal period and subsequent development of eczema, IgE-associated eczema and sensitisation in the first year of life. Methods: Faecal samples were collected at age 1 week, 1 month and 3 months from infants at high risk of allergic disease, who were followed prospectively to age 12 months. Bifidobacteriumspecies were analysed by quantitative PCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Infants were examined at 3, 6 and 12 months, and skin prick test performed at 12 months. Eczema was diagnosed according to the UK-Working Party criteria. Results: The presence of B. catenulatum at 3 months was associated with a higher risk of developing eczema (OR adj = 4.5; 95% CI 1.56 to 13.05, P adj = 0.005). Infants colonised with B. breve at 1 week (OR adj = 0.29; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.95, P adj = 0.041) and 3 months (OR adj = 0.15; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.44, P adj = 0.00001) had a reduced risk of developing eczema. Furthermore, the presence of B. breve at 3 months was associated with a lower risk of atopic sensitisation at 12 months (OR adj = 0.38; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.98, P adj = 0.046). B. brevecolonisation patterns were influenced by maternal allergic status, household pets and number of siblings. Conclusions: There are temporal variations of Bifidobacterium colonisation patterns early in life and these variations differentially modulate later development of eczema and/or atopic sensitisation in infants at high risk of allergic disease. Modulation of the early microbiota may provide a means for prevention of eczema in high risk infants. Background: Recent epidemiological studies demonstrate significant associations of Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) with asthma. In addition, clinical studies suggest that the enterotoxin exposure could contribute to the development of fixed airway obstruction in asthma, leading to a COPD-overlap phenotype. In previous experiments of mice, a short-term exposure to staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) induced extensive inflammatory responses in lungs, including lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. Therefore, we hypothesized chronic repeated exposure to SEB could induce tissue remodeling in lower airways. Objective: To investigate effects of repeated SEB exposure on airway remodeling in OVA-induced chronic allergic asthma model. Methods: BALB/c mice were intra-peritoneally sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA)-aluminum hydroxide at days 0 and 14, and were intranasally challenged with OVA and/or SEB for the next 6 weeks(50 ug OVA, 10 or 100 ng of SEB, 3 times per week over a period, total 18 exposure). At 8 weeks, mice were sacrificed and assessed for histopathology, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cell counts, lung cytokines, methacholine airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR), and serum immunoglobulins. Results: OVA sensitization followed by repeated OVA exposure resulted in the development of Th2 asthma and inflammation, including BALF cell counts, lung cytokines, histopathology, AHR and serum immunoglobulins. However, repeated SEB exposure did not aggravate OVA-induced pathologic changes, or induce any remarkable pathologic changes when administered alone. Serum total IgE levels were also not influenced by repeated SEB exposure. Rather, chronic repeated SEB-exposed mice showed lower levels of lung inflammation and remodeling, but higher levels of IL-10 and TGF-β, compared to non-SEB-exposed mice. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates unpredicted suppressive effects of chronic repeated exposure of SEB in allergic asthma models, leading to the speculation that SEB exerts bi-directional effects depending on the timing of exposure. The mechanisms of anti-inflammatory effects warrant further investigation. Two hundred-forty (150 male, 62.5%) were included in the FA group, while one hundred forty-four (92 male, 63.9%) were included in the non-FA group. Children with having FA had a higher blood total IgE levels(238.7±414.6 IU/mL vs. 50.7±96.0 IU/mL, P=0.001) and eosinophil(%)(7.0% ± 5.0% vs. 4.7% ±3.4%, P=0.001), and more frequent parental allergic history(70% vs. 59%, P=0.025). The frequency of breast feeding were relatively higher in FA group than in non-FA group(77.9% vs. 61.8%, P= 0.001). Subanalysis between children with FA(n=240) and children with food sensitization but tolerant group(n=53) were not showing significant difference in frequency of breast feeding(77.9% vs. 75.5%, P=0.700). Adjusting for reverse causation by excluding children of age over 6 months or with parental allergic diseases or without parental allergic diseases did not alter these results. The amplified cDNA of mature Blo t 7 encoded 195 amino acids. Protein sequence alignment with the mature Blo t 7 reference primary structure (UniprotKB/TrEMBL, accession number A1KXI4) evidenced four point mutations but also a twenty amino acids insertion. Multiple alignments showed that this Blo t 7 sequence segment is a conserved domain shared with other group 7 mite allergens (Tyr p 7, Aca s 7, Lep d 7, Gly d 7, Der p 7 and Der f 7). Mature rBlo t 7 was successfully expressed and secreted from P.pastoris following induction with 0.5% methanol at 25°C. The expressed protein migrated onto SDS-PAGE as a 25kD band. The difference with the predicted molecular weight (21.18 kD) could be attributed to glycan structures from the predicted N-glycosylation site (NTT, . Pore sizes were found to be smaller for MWC than for NWP textiles (4 vs 11 μm). NWP fabrics showed irregular pore sizes, with 2 batches having pore size greater than 5 μm. Permeability results showed that NWP fabrics are significantly more permeable to Der p1 allergen compared to MWC tissue (23,6ng +/-0.7 vs 3,4ng +/-0.02). Thus, ISO 13485 quality controls allowed for dismissal of 2 out of 6 batches of unsatisfactory NWP textiles. A significant proportion of aluminium (~50%) was retained at the injection site 3 months post final injection. The rate of clearance of aluminium from the dose site was calculated over a 6 month time period. As an estimate (from D14 and D180 data), the terminal halflife for clearance from SC dose site would be approx 240 days (i.e. time taken to remove half of the dose). Therefore, estimated time to clear 95% dose from SC site would take approx 1.2 years in the rat model. MCT has good adjuvant properties, comprising a high adsorptive power for proteins, and enhancement of Th1-like and associated immune responses, highlighting its potential of action as a biodegradable depot adjuvant in allergen-specific immunotherapy. MCT is naturally metabolised and the pharmacokinetics of MCT present a half-life at the injection site of 48 hours; this is a particular benefit for allergy SCIT, a traditionally long course treatment, minimising the need for accumulation of non-biodegradable adjuvant. The study in its first part involved 2,690 children. After the analysis of the questionnaires 375 children visited the study allergist. In 29% of them the diagnosis of asthma or allergies was confirmed. Especially early symptoms and selected allergen exposures correlated well with the final diagnosis (p < 0.05 was noted between exposure to moisture, mold and diagnosed in a child: of asthma: Phi = 0.093; p = 0,00; of allergic rhinitis: Phi = 0.114 ; p = 0,00; of atopic dermatitis: Phi = 0.052; p = 0.007; food allergy Phi = 0.048 ; p = 0.012). The prevalence of AD diagnosis and current AD (diagnosed and presented symptoms during recent 12 months) was 29.4% and 16.4%, respectively. The proportion of subjects who were overweight and obese was 13.3% and 6.7%, respectively. We divided 4 groups according to the urinary phthalate levels (below or over average) and BMI (normal or overweight/obese). The subjects who were overweight or obese and exposured to higher urinary MnBP, MEOHP or MEHHP were the highest odds ratios compared to other groups in diagnosis of atopic dermatitis [OR(95% CI) ) in MEOHP; 1.584 (1.049-2.393 ) in MEHHP)]. The subjects who were overweight/ obese and exposured to higher urinary MnBP or MEHHP were the highest odds ratios compared to other groups in current symptoms of atopic dermatitis [OR(95% CI) 2.091 (1.294-3.378) in MnBP; 1.797(1.101-2.932 ) in MEHHP)]. The mean age of study population was 30.3 years. A total of 873 patients enrolled in this study; 513 patients from urban, 327 patients from rural regions. Among study population, 65.8% had positive test results to at least 1 of the 39 allergen and 80.1% of patients had positive test results to multiple allergen. The prevalence of allergic sensitization differed significantly by age. Younger patients tend to had positive test result to perennial allergen. However, older patients tend to had positive test result to seasonal allergen. There was no difference in positive test result between patients from urban and rural areas. Conclusions A large portion of the study population is sensitized to indoor and outdoor allergens. However, the overall prevalence of sensitization and the prevalence of sensitization to individual allergens and allergen type showed no differenced according to the level of urbanization in a state. Background: English walnut (Juglansregia) is one of the most common allergenic foods but the influence of processing on the allergenicity has been scarcely known. This study aims to evaluate the relevant walnut allergens in walnut allergic Korean young children and to examine the influence of different cooking methods on walnut proteins. Methods: Protein extracts from boiled, roasted, and pickled walnuts were compared with that of raw walnut using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Raw walnut protein extracts were immunoblotted with individual sera from 11 children with levels of walnut specific IgE of 0.7kU/L or higher (ImmunoCAP, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass). Additionally, we produced peanut extract and sera were tested with enzyme linked immunosorbentassay inhibition test. Results: At least 8 or more distinct protein bands (9-108kDa) were visible from raw walnut by SDS-PAGE. The 9-kD (Jug r 3) and 16-kDa (Jug r 1) bands were stable in boiled and roasted walnut. The intensity of9-kD band was even enhanced in roasted and boiled walnut, whereas that of 16-kDa band was slightly decreased in roasted walnut. Meanwhile, the 28-kDa and 60-kDa (Jug r 4) bands profoundly disappeared in roasted walnut. No protein bands were shown in the walnut treated by vinegar for one month. By IgE-immunoblotting with individual sera from walnut-sensitive children, at least 8 protein components were identified. The 60-kDa band corresponding to Jug r 4 wasreacted with 72.5% of patients and the 16-kDa band (Jug r 1) and 9-kDa band (Jug r 3) were reacted with 54.5% of patients. Walnut in the IgE-ELISA was not inhibited by peanut extract. Conclusion: This study indicatesthat IgE-binding bands suspected as Jug r 1, Jug r 3, and Jug r 4 are major problematic allergens in walnut allergic children. Also, the amount of components weighted 28kDa, 47kDa, 60kDawere reduced by heating whereas that of 9kDa and 16kDa were relatively stable. The subjects were classified into 4 major clusters using Ward's method. Age, age of onset, duration of asthma, BMI, atopic status, FEV1%, and ΔFEV1 were robustly different among 4 clusters. Clinical characteristics of 4 clusters are as below: Cluster 1, early-onset with high frequency of atopy and relatively well preserved FEV1; Cluster 2, early-onset with long duration and moderately impaired FEV1; Cluster 3, middle age onset with short duration and severely impaired FEV1; Cluster 4, old age onset with high BMI, but well preserved FEV1. The annual average frequency of exacerbation was significantly different between the clusters (p=0.019), and markedly higher in the cluster 3 (0.46/year). Conclusion Exacerbation-prone asthma phenotype is found by using cluster analysis and clinical characteristics of the phenotype are middle-age onset, short duration, and severely impaired FEV1. Noticing this asthma phenotype can be useful in clinical practice to predict asthma exacerbation. Objective To investigate the expression of Th17 cells and Tregs in the mouse model of Neutrophilic Asthma effects of STAT3 inhibition AG490 Methods 36 female C57BL mice were equally randomly divided into three groups:NA group, NA treated with AG490(NAAG)group, and normal control(NC) group. The above mice were treated as fowllow: Mice in NA group or NAAG group were sensitized by a mixture consists 100ug of ovalbumin(OVA,Grade V) and 0.1ug of lipopolysaccharide(LPS) via airway delivery on the experiment days 0,6,13. Besides, NAAG mice were injected intraperitoneally with AG490 in the dose of 500ug three times a week. In the case of intervention of AG490 encountering sentisization with OVA and LPS, we injected the mice with AG490 30 minutes before they were sensitised through airway dilivery. Once the sensitization stage were finished, mice in NA group and NAAG group were challenged consecutively by exposure to a 1% OVA aerosol produced by an inhalation delivery system for one hour once a day, from day 21 to 22. At the time of 24 hours after the last challenge, all mice were disposed and relative index were measured in time. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid(BALF) was collected and total white blood cell count was determined on blood cell counting plate, and classification of proportion was determined under the optical microscope with Diff-Quick staining. Lung tissue was separated and HE and PAS stain were done to obseve pathologic changes and goblet cell hyperplasia under the optical microscope. BALF IL-17A cytokine concentration was determined by means of enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent serologic assay(ELISA). Percentages of Th17 cells and Treg cells in the lung tissue were determined by means of Flow cytometry(FCM). Results BALF total cell count, neutrophil percentages and eosinophil percentages count in the NAAG group were lower than that of the NA group (P<0.05), but were still higher than that of the NC group(each P<0.05); Lung tissue pathologic changes and goblet cell hyperplasia were markedly improved in NAAG group compared with that of the NA group,but there were still significant change compared with that of the NC group;BALF IL-17 cytokine concentrations in the NAAG group was lower than that of the NA group, but was still higher than that of the NC group(each P<0.05);Th17 cell percentage in the lung of the NAAG group was lower than that of the NA group, but was still higher than that of the NC group(each P<0.05). Treg cell percentage in the lung of the NA group was higher than that of the NAAG group (each P<0.05). Conclusions Airway inflammation in the mouse model of neutrophilic asthma was improved by early treatment of AG490,which probably via down-regulating the espression of Th17 cells and upregulating the espression of Tregs. Background: The purpose of this study was to characterize the clinical presentation of virus-induced wheezing in bronchiolitis patients younger than 2 years of age. We also aimed to verify whether the clinical index have a good association with the disease severity. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of hospitalized children younger than 2 years old with acute bronchiolitis, which caused by respiratory virus between April 1, 2012 and April 1, 2015 in Severance children's hospital. Specific viral etiologies were detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction at the time of admission. Clinical severity score, based on the age, respiratory rate, wheezing, chest wall retraction, and percutaneous oxygen saturation at admission; duration of fever, use of oxygen therapy and inhaled corticosteroid within 24 hours after admission were investigated. According to the scores, all patients were divided into a mild to moderate and severe bronchiolitis group. Host factors and type of respiratory viruses, were compared among the severity groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to verify the risk factors for severe bronchiolitis. Results: A total of 780 children were studied. A single virus was identified in 530(68%) and multiple viruses in 250(32%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), RSV+RV, influenza viruses (Flu), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and parainfluenza virus were detected in 34, 27, 14, 12, 7 and 6 % of samples respectively. RSV and rhinovirus were the viruses most frequently identified in mixed infections. There were no differences in age and severity scores between patients with prevalent viruses (RSV and RV) and those with less common infections. Patients with coinfections were 2.25 times (95% confidence interval, 1.02 to 8.02) more at risk for severe bronchiolitis than those with a single viral infection. Host factors associated with severe bronchiolitis included younger age, prematurity and chronic cardiopulmonary diseases. Type of viruses, personal and family history of allergic diseases was not significantly associated with bronchiolitis severity. Conclusions: We compared the clinical characteristics of respiratory viral infections in wheezy bronchiolitis patients younger than 2 years old. Viral coinfections and host factors, including younger age, prematurity, and chronic cardiopulmonary diseases are risk factors for severe bronchiolitis. Background: Among the patients with serum total immunoglobulin E (TIgE) higher than 1000ku/L, who suffered from respiratory diseases, we could found the majority of them were sensitized to house dust mite (HDM) and Aspergillosis. We aimed to find out if there any correlation with TIgE among serum specific immunoglobulin--E (sIgE) against house dust mite along with Aspergillosis in the patients. Methods: 64 subjects with high level of TIgE were tested for serum sIgE-derp1 and sIgE-Af by using ImmunoCAP 100. Result: 68.8% (44/64) patients were sensitive to HDM while 40.6% (29/64) were sensitive to aspergillosis. What's more, 37.5% (24/64) patients could be detected sIgE (derp1,Af) while 15/64(23.4%) patients were found sIgE(derp1, Af)-free. 20/64 (31.3%) patients were merely sensitive to HDM while 5/64 (7.8%) were sensitive to Aspergillosis. Among the patients with TIgE higher than 1000ku/L, those patients sensitive to HDM was significantly more than those sensitive to Aspergillosis (ka=9.00, t= P<0.01). sIgE-Af (r=0.410) was correlated more with TIgE than sIgE-derp1 (r=0.228) was (P<0.05). Conclusion: Most of the patients with high level of TIgE, complicated with respiratory diseases, were more likely sensitive to HDM rather than Aspergillosis. Compared to sIgE against HDM, sIgE-Af contributed more to the level of TIgE. The detection of sIgE against HDM and Aspergillosis was important for the patients complicated with respiratory and high level of TIgE. One hundred and twenty-six cases of anaphylaxis from PN, TNs and seeds were identified (64.3% in male patients) and the mean age was 4.9 years (0.8-18.9 years), with 81.7% of subjects under seven years old. The number of patients increased from 9 cases in 2009 to 57 cases in 2013. PN accounted for 32.5%, walnut (WN) accounted for 41.3%, pine nut accounted for 7.1%, and other TNs and seeds accounted for 19.1%. The most common system involved was cutaneous (96.0%), followed by respiratory (87.3%) and gastrointestinal (26.2%). The proportion of patients with cardiovascular symptoms was significantly higher in older patients than in younger children (p = 0.001). The time intervals between ingestion of triggering food and onset of symptoms were immediate in 19.0% and less than two hours in 42.9%. Among 104 cases (82.5%) in which serum levels of specific IgE (sIgE) to corresponding allergens were measured, the median values of sIgE to PN, WN and pine nut were 10.50 (0.39-100.00) kU A /L, 8.74 (0.04-100.00) kU A /L and 4.61 (0.60-4.61) kU A /L, respectively. Among 50 cases managed in the emergency department, patients were treated with intramuscular epinephrine in 52.0%, with systemic steroid in 66.0%, with antihistamine in 94.0%, with oxygen in 36.0%, and with bronchodilator in 48.0%. The overall percentage of patients prescribed an epinephrine auto-injector was 48.4%, with no significant differences between age groups. Conclusions Among anaphylaxis caused by PN, TNs and seeds in Korea, WN, PN and pine nut were the 3 most common triggers in order, and 9 other kinds of TNs and seeds were also identified as triggers. About 82% of cases were in children under the age of seven. The median levels of sIgE to PN and WN were 10.50 kU A /L and 8.74 kU A /L, respectively, and some of cases showed remarkably low sIgE levels, and < 0.35 kU A /L in three subjects. * This study was done by Food Allergy and Atopic Dermatitis Study Group in the Korean Academy of Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Diseases. Perilla (Perilla frutescens) seed, also known as wild sesame seed is one of the popular spices in Asia but serious allergic reactions to perilla seed have been rarely reported. Herein we report two cases of anaphylaxis caused by perilla seed in children. A 25-month-old boy presented to the outpatient clinic at Ajou University Hospital with previous experiences of urticaria and facial angioedema immediately after ingestion of soup containing perilla seed powder at ages of 13 months and 21 months. He had past history of asthma and previous experience of lip angioedema after ingesting kiwi for the first time at 9 months old. As the specific IgE (sIgE) test to perilla seed is not commercially available, the sIgE to sesame seed, which belongs to Lamiales like perilla, was measured instead. The sIgE level to sesame seed was 2.98 kU A /L at 25 months, and was 3.37 kU A /L at 4 years of age. The sIgE level to kiwi was 1.42 kU A /L and multiple allergosorbent test chemiluminescent assay (MAST CLA) revealed no remarkable sensitization to inhalant allergens. To confirm the causal relationship, an open oral food challenge (OFC) with perilla seed powder was performed when he was 4 years old. Immediately after the contact of extremely small amount of perilla seed powder around his lips, he developed urticaria, facial angioedema, cough and rhinorrhea. He was treated with intramuscular epinephrine, after which his symptoms resolved completely. The second patient, a 5-year-old boy, presented to the outpatient clinic with a previous history of urticaria, lip angioedema, pruritis of tongue and hoarseness immediately after ingestion of seaweed soup containing perilla seed a few months before. He had past history of asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis and was previously diagnosed as allergic to egg white and peanut. He also had oral allergy syndrome to kiwi fruit. Moderate sensitization to alder, birch and white oak was noted in MAST CLA and sIgE levels to sesame seed, egg white, peanut and kiwi were 1.01 kU A /L, 1.47 kU A /L, 2.82 kU A /L and 3.19 kU A /L, respectively. The OFC test with perilla seed was not performed in this patient because his initial symptoms were compatible with anaphylaxis. For the etiologic confirmation, Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) and IgE western blot with crude extract of perilla seed produced in our own laboratory are in progress for both patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of anaphylaxis caused by perilla seed in children. Background: Particulate matter (PM) associated with more wheezing episodes, increased risk of asthma symptoms and respiratory tract infection in children. However, the impact of prenatal exposure to indoor PM on the health of children is poorly understood yet. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays a critical role in responses induced by air pollution. Objective: To investigate whether prenatal exposure to indoor fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) affects susceptibility to wheezing in children, and to determine whether genetic factor modify this environmental effect. Methods: The study population consisted of the 323 children with indoor PM 2.5 data in a birth cohort. Recurrent wheezing was determined as 2 or more wheezing episodes diagnosed by physicians in the first 2 years of age. Indoor PM 2.5 was measured during pregnancy. Genotyping for TLR4 (rs1927911) was performed by TaqMan. Results: Prenatal indoor PM 2.5 exposure increased the risk of recurrent wheezing in 2 years of age (aOR 3.52; 95% CI 1.50-8.30). TLR4 CC increased the effect of prenatal indoor PM 2.5 exposure on recurrent wheezing (aOR 7.00; 95% CI 1.41-34.73; p for interaction 0.153). Conclusion: Indoor PM 2.5 exposure during the prenatal period increased susceptibility to recurrent wheezing. This effect was modified by polymorphisms in TLR4. Reducing PM 2.5 exposure from the prenatal period may prevent wheezing in susceptible children. Background B-lymphocytes (BL) play a critical role in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). BL depletion therapy still remains an attractive option, despite the disappointing results of RCTs. Methods Twelve SLE patients [2 males, mean age 43.8 yrs (29-54)] with polyarthralgia and multiorgan involvement including class IV or III/V (ISN/RPS) glomerulonephritis (9 cases), skin lesions (9 cases, with necrotizing ulcers in3), polyneuropathy (7cases, with CNS involvement in 2), lymphoadenopathy (6) e polysierositis (5) have been treated withan IBLD protocol for intolerance to conventional immunosuppressive therapy (6 cases) or as a front line therapy (6 cases). Protocol: Rituximab 375 mg/sm on days 1, 8, 15, 22 , and 2 more doses after one and two months, associated with 2 IV administrations of 10 mg/kg of cyclofosfamide, and 3 infusions of methylprednisolone (15 mg/kg) followed by oral prednisone (0.8 mg/die, rapidly tapered to 5 mg/day in 10 weeks). No further immunosuppressive maintenance therapy has been given. Results IBLD obtained a complete depletion of CD20+ BL for 12-18 months. Patients had been followed-up for 48.9 (25-93) months. A significant decreases (p<0.05) were found in the levels of ESR (baseline mean value: 54.2 mm; 3 months: 33; end of follow-up: 14.9), anti-dsDNA antibodies (baseline: 192 U; 3 months: 112; end of follow-up: 17) and proteinuria (baseline: 4.9 g/24 hours; 3 months: 0.97; end of followup: 0.22). Conversely, C4 values (baseline 11 mg/dl) significantly increased (p<0.05) after 3 months (22 mg/dl) and at the end of the follow-up (20 mg/dl). Three patients relapsed after 36, 41 and 72 months, respectively. They showed again a complete remission after retreatment over 13-48 months of observation. For the 40 children, 26 were boys, the average age was 3.68±0.58 years old, the weight was 17.74±3.17 kg and the height was 103.95±6.49 cm. R5 was 1.27±0.33, 1.12±0.26, 1.01±0.26 and 0.89±0.24 kPa/L/s at T 0 , T 1 , T 2 and T 3 separately and the differences were significant when compared in pairs. R20 was 0.77±0.19, 0.67±0.16, 0.66±0.16 and 0.59±0.15 kPa/L/s separately, and the differences were significant except between T 1 and T 2 . R5-R20 was 0.50±0.24, 0.45±0.18, 0.35±0.19 and 0.30±0.20 kPa/L/s separately, and the differences were significant except between T 0 and T 1 . The Fres was 25. 38±6.91, 22.70±3.19, 21.41±2.40 and 20.13±2.69 Hz separately, and the differences were significant. The AX was 4.29±1.91, 3.23±1.33, 2.48±1.28 and 1.81±0.90 kPa/L separately, and the differences were significant. Twenty-nine of 44 patients (65.9%) were male, and the mean age was 3.3 years (6-177.6 months) with 95.5% aged 12 months or over. Thirteen had no history of CM ingestion and 31 had previous history of immediate reactions after CM ingestion (OFC performed for detection of clinical tolerance). Among them, 64.5% reported acute urticaria and 32.3% experienced anaphylaxis at initial CM ingestion. The number of subjects who passed OFC (successfully ingested cumulative dose of 200 mL of CM without allergic reactions, Group P) was 30 out of 44 (68.2%). Among the 14 children who failed OFC (Group F), cutaneous symptoms were reported in 100%, while upper respiratory, lower respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms were noted in 35.7%, 7.1% and 14.3%, respectively. Seven patients experienced anaphylaxis (three of them with anaphylaxis history on initial CM ingestion) but none of them had cardiovascular or nervous symptoms during OFC. The median cumulative dose of CM at symptom onset during OFC was 22.0 mL. The median level of milk-sIgE in Group F was higher than that in Group P (5.04 kU A /L vs 1.42 kU A /L, p = 0.003), and the median level of casein-sIgE in Group F was also higher than that in Group P (7.56 kU A /L vs 0.53 kU A /L, p=0.003). Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the optimal cutoff points for milk-sIgE and casein-sIgE in children aged 12 months or over, were 1.71 kU A /L and 7.00 kU A /L, respectively. The number of subjects younger than 12 months was only two, so the optimal cutoff points in this group were not obtained. Initial levels of milk-sIgE and casein-sIgE, age at OFC, and anaphylaxis at initial CM ingestion were not significantly related with the outcome of OFC. Past history of asthma was a significant factor associated with increased risk of OFC failure (p=0.045) in crude analysis, but the relation was not significant after adjustment with confounding factors. A questionnaire related with allergic rhinitis and asthma was asked to 1086 students (454 males, 632 females). The current prevalences of the seasonal and perennial rhinoconjunctivitis, urticaria and eczema, drug intolerances, pollen and pet animal hypersensitivities were 20.7%, 22.5%, 4.6%, 16.3% and 0.2% respectively. All of hypersensitivities reaction rates were distinctively more common in the females. Seasonal rhinitis and pollen allergy were more prevalent in west (22.1%) region than northern region (12.0%). No significant geographical difference was observed regarding the drug and pet hypersensitivities. Seventeen patients (27%) were found to have vitamin D levels lower than 30 ng/ml, considered to be insufficient. These patients had poorer asthma control as indicated by ACT scores, and had a significantly higher rate of allergic sensitization, compared to the vitamin D sufficient asthmatics. Patients with vitamin D insufficiency had an average number of medical visits for respiratory infections the previous year of 3.94, while after vitamin D supplementation the average was 2.17. ACT scores increased significantly at the end of the 6 month period, while spirometric values did not change significantly. A total of 1085 students (mean age:21.16+1.90 years, F/M:631/454) from all grades responded to the survey. The mean prevalence of self-reported drug hypersensitivity was 4.6% (49/1085). The most frequently involved drugs were antibiotics 28 (68.3%), followed by analgesisc (26.8%). The most common allergic reactions were rash 53.2%, and cardiovascular reactions 12.8%, respiratory reactions 4.3%, aforementioned two systems involvement were 22.3%, anaphylaxis 7.4%. Personal history of allergic diseases 11%, family history of drug hypersensitivity 22.4%. There was no differences in the prevalence of drug allergy in female patients compared with male patients. The mean age of first drug allergy reaction year was 13±7.2. Five hundred fifty five (57.4%) students had antibiotics and 641(65.7%) students had analgesics in case of need. Assessment result -excellent and good effect was stated among 73% (21) patients. Among them, 20 patients (68,9%) noted the decrease in pharmaco-medicine need when contacting corresponding allergen., overall health status improvement -21 patients (73%). None of the patients claimed main disease flow worsening. Cytokine profile research after treatment showed IL-4 and ϒ -INF content level normalization both in local and serum fractions. Among 5 patients (16,6%) rapid increase of IL-8 è TNF -α in local fractions was stated before treatment, and it was the key reason to change SLIT mode and to add immunomodulating therapy. 27 patients (93%) agreed to continue treatment next year. Conclusions Full SLIT course was successfully implemented to all patients using modern tableted allergen extract (produced in Kazakhstan), despite violations in virus defense system and mucosal immunity system. Stated change in α-TNF and IL-8 content level among a group of patients allowed to change SLIT mode and complete the course successfully. SLIT using modern tableted medicine among immunocompromised (problematic) patients, suffering from allergic diseases is a successful and high effective method and complies with all criteria of rational pharmacotherapy. The hsa-miR-185-5p levels were significantly elevated between the ages of 1 and 2 years in non-wheezers at the age of 2 years, while the levels were consistent in wheezers. This suggests that increase of hsa-miR-185-5p levels may be a negative indicator of recurrent wheezing and potentially asthma in later childhood. We did not see any correlation between allergen-specific igE levels and hsa-miR-185-5p. When remaining naïve, all KN1 hyper-IgE mice showed significantly slower tumor growth and longer survival compared to the wt BALB/c controls and DM1M2 hypo-IgE mice. In all strains of mice passive immunotherapy with 4D5 rendered significant survival benefits compared to the untreated groups. Vaccination against HER-2 resulted in the overall longest survivals and lead to significant survival benefits compared to naïve as well as passively 4D5 antibody treated groups. Most importantly, all KN1 hyper-IgE mice showed a significant survival benefit independent of any of the treatments. The pollen distribution patterns were similar nationwide, however the calendar and distribution of pollen was different between inland and Jeju Island. Pine, Oak and Ginkgo trees were most frequent airborne pollen in Korea (67%-98%) with highest rate of pine pollen except Jeju Island. Japanese cedar restricted in Jeju and southern area of Korea (Kwangju and Busan) and also was the most common pollen in Jeju Island in spring. Interestingly, the pine pollen was continuously decreased in Jeju. It could be related with outbreak of pine wilt disease from 2010. The other background is the number of oak and ginkgo increased annually. The pine still is the most common pollen in South Korea so far. Otherwise, It is noteworthy that the concentration of ginkgo pollen is continuously increased at 6 sites; western area of Seoul, Jeonju, Busan, Daejeon, Gwangju, and Jeju. The high rate of Ginkgo pollen could be related with urbanization. Actually 41 % of street trees are Ginkgo in Seoul, Ginkgo pollen number at western pollen station of Seoul showed drastically increased from 611 grains/m 3 (2012 year), to 5,527 grains/m 3 (2014 year). Meanwhile the other areas showed oak pollen increased as second highest rate. The average age of subjects at diet initiation was 43.75 years. On average, each subject eliminated 1.7 foods from their diet. Post-diet biopsies displayed a significantly lower level of peak eosinophils/hpf compared to pre-diet biopsies on average (37.9 vs. 89.8, p = 0.043). Three patients had post-diet biopsies below the histological threshold of diagnosis for EoE (<15 eo/hpf). Production of both IL-4 and IL-13 in mouse basophils was induced by the treatment of enzymatically active Der f 1, whereas inactive Der f 1 did not. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) were phosphorylated upon treatment of active Der f 1 on BMBs. Additionally, treatment of pharmacological inhibitors PD098059 (ERK inhibitor) and SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) were able to inhibit IL-4 and IL-13 secretion. However, p38 MAPK was not inhibited by its inhibitor (SB203580). We produced 2 kinds of narrow strips of width of 1.95mm and then assembled the strips side by side in single allergy testing kit. The each strip has 25 or 32 lines to be coated with allergen or our standard, so we can measure 50 or 64 items in a single test. Since the Protia Allergy-Q use only one strip per single patient, rather than two strips per person at traditional allergy testing kits, it can save the testing time and blood volume. Furthermore, its diagnostic performance was compare to ImmunoCAP with 1,799 paired assay, which resulted in good concordance for most allergens (k=0.713-0.898, p<0.001). Immunecheck human IgG (Proteometech Inc, Seoul, Korea) can detect IgG range from 1.2 to 40,000 ug/ml. To know the degree of agreement against other quantitative assay method, we compared our assay results of 30 human sera with an immunoturbidimetric assay using Cobas Integra 800 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). This comparison showed that Immunecheck human IgG had 74.2 -132.1% of degree of agreement and 0.9243 of coefficient of determination (R 2 ) against an immunoturbidimetric method. The detection limit of Immunecheck human IgE was 80 IU/ml of total IgE and their signals were increased depending on the concentrations of IgE. The average of total IgE from 392 sera measured by ImmunoCAP and Protia Allergy-Q was 167.1 and 149.4 kU/l, respectively. Passing-Bablok regression analysis demonstrated that ImmunoCAP and Protia Allergy-Q exhibited almost perfect correlation (intercept, 5.6676 [95% confidence interval {CI} 4.3282, 6 .9388] and slope, 0.8676 [95% CI 0.8211, 0.9107]). Conclusions Protia Allergy-Q, a multiple allergy screening kit, is a low-cost screening test for patients with suspected allergy. It provides 60 kinds of specific IgE level but also total IgE level. Even though it is a semi-quantitative assay, total IgE concentration tested by Allergy-Q is nearly equal to that by ImmunoCAP. Therefore, it may be very convenient tool to measure not only specific IgE but total IgE concentration. A) Background: Asthma is considered as a common respiratory disease among farmers in many researches. In 13' International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health, farmers showed higher prevalence (8.0%) than all other population (6.7%). But there is no largescale research of the prevalence and current state of asthma among Korean farmers. B) Methods: Structured questionnaire was used to evaluate the demographic characteristics such as age, sex, place of residence, smoking, prevalence of asthma based on doctor diagnosis and possible risk factors like crop types, farming period, pesticide usage, indoor cultivation, respiratory protection usage. From 2013 to 2014, total 951 farmers answered the questionnaire. C) Results: Prevalence of asthma among male farmer was 5.2% and the prevalence among female farmer was 6.0%. Based on 2013 Korean national health and nutrition examination survey, prevalence of asthma among Korean male was 2.7% and the prevalence among female was 4.1%. The odds ratio of asthma for total pesticide use year (more than 20 years) was 2.07 (1.20-3.58 ) and the odds ratio for indoor cultivation was 0.97(0.49-1.90). D) Conclusions: The prevalence of asthma among farmers was higher than other population in Korea. Pesticide usage is considered as a risk factor of asthma. In further research, exposure measures and work-relatedness measures should be needed. Background: Dietary intake can have a positive or negative impact on both actual and perceived general health and immune status. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of dietary intake of a variety of nutrients on perceived immune status in young adult women. Methods: A survey on dietary intake and perceived immune status was held among young Dutch women, aged between 18-30 years old. Perceived current immune status was scored on a scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent). Subsequently, participants could indicate whether they perceived their immune status as normal or reduced. A food frequency questionnaire was completed recording past week food and beverage intake. From this data, the amount of various nutrients could be estimated, including fibers, sugar, tryptophan, beta-carotene, calcium, niacin, folate, thiamin, carbohydrates, riboflavin, vitamin A (retinol), vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin C, vitamin D, and cholesterol. Non-parametric correlations (Spearman's r) were used to examine the association between perceived heath, immune status and nutritients. Dietary intake of those with normal and reduced perceived immune status was compared using the Mann-Whitney U Test. Results: N=329 young women (mean [SD] age: 20.7 [2.7] ) completed the survey. Significant correlations were found between immune ratings and consumption of tea (r= 0.124, p=0.023), sugar (r= -0.173, p=0.002), and carbohydrates (r= -0.125, p=0.022). N=109 women (33.1%) reported having a reduced perceived immune status. Women with a perceived reduced immune status reported consuming significantly more alcohol (p=0.025), and had significantly higher dietary levels of cholesterol (p=0.022), sugar (p=0.044), and vitamin B12 (p=0.021) when compared to women reporting a normal immune status. Discussion: The findings show that dietary intake is related to perceived immune status. However, some nutrients have a bigger impact on perceived immune status than others. Future studies, including objective measurement of immune biomarkers and nutrients, should confirm these findings. The number of eosinophils in BALF was significantly increased in mice sensitized by HDM with cGAMP. Histological analysis revealed that infiltration of inflammatory cells and mucus-containing goblet cells in the lung were also increased after the sensitization of HDM with cGAMP. Moreover cGAMP-adjuvanted HDM led to airway hyper-responsiveness. These effects were dependent on STING/TBK1, that are downstream factors of cGAMP signaling pathway. Conclusion cGAMP acts an adjuvant and induces allergic inflammation in the lung. These results suggest that cGAMP may be involved in viral infection-induced asthma through the release of DAMPs. The patient was treated empirically with omalizumab 300 mg every 28 days. One month after initiating omalizumab treatment, his dermatitis and eosinophilia markedly improved. From all patients (121) who were gotten shot, 32 (26.4%) patients were under 20 years and 18(56%) patients were under 10 years. All patients had allergic rhinitis or allergic asthma isolated or in combination with other types of allergy. In adult group, anaphylactic shock occurred in one patient. Eight attacks of generalized urticarial with wheezing, five attacks of generalized urticarial with abdominal pain and severe cramps observed. In children group, we did not have any systemic reactions, only two cases had flushing, and two cases experienced headache after shot. Sometimes local swelling and erythema occurred in place of shot in two groups of patients. In addition, improvement in symptom control for disease in children was better than in adults. The majority of the patients (71%) had hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG<7 g/L) ranging from 3.9 g/l and 6.5 g/l. Strikingly, IgG1 was selectively below normal range in fifteen out of sixteen patients (94%). None of the patients were on immune suppressive medication. The overall rate of pneumonia was 53%. Nine out of seventeen patients suffered from pneumonia at least once between January 2000 and October 2012, four of those patients had recurrent pneumonia or sinopulmonal infections. Other infections also occurred, e.g. recurrent urinary tract infection, recurrent facial herpes simplex and erysipelas. In the patients with hypoglobulinemia the rate of pneumonia was 58% compared to 40% in patients whose total IgG was normal (p = 0,52). Interestingly three patients with low IgG serum levels also showed insufficient vaccination responses for H. influenzae type B and/or S. pneumoniae. Two of which had recurrent infections, including pneumonia. These patients met the criteria for common variable immune deficiency (CVID).
