Out of 105 samples, 3 (2.8%) contained NoVs RNA, either alone (0.9%, 1/105) or in mixed infections with FeKoV or FECV (1.9%, 2/105). Sixteen samples (15.2%) were found to contain FPV DNA alone. All the NoV positive samples were identified from diarrheic cats with a prevalence rate of 6.2% (3/48), while they were not detected from asymptomatic animals (0/57). By sequence comparison in the short RdRp fragment, the viruses TE/68-13, ME/78-13 and TE/77-13/ITA shared 89.9-93.2% nt and 90.8-95.3% aa identities to each other and displayed the highest identity (91.0-93.0% nt and 97.0-98.0% aa) to the prototype GIV.2 strain lion/Pistoia/387/06/ITA. For the strain TE/77-13/ITA the sequence of~3.4-kb fragment at the 3â€² end of the genome, including the partial RdRp (0.8 kb) and the complete ORF2 and ORF3 (GenBank accession number KT245136), was sequenced and the genome organization was determined. Phylogenetic analysis was based on the 750-nt sequence of the COOH terminus of the polymerase complex of the carnivore NoV strains available in the databases. Also, RdRp sequences of human GIV.1 NoVs were included in the analysis and used to calculate a nt identity matrix. By visual inspection of the tree, the carnivore NoVs segregated in at least three different genetic clusters (Fig. 1) . The strain cat/TE/77-13/ITA was grouped with the feline NoV strains lion/GIV.2/Pistoia/387/06/ITA, cat/GIV.2/ CU081210E/USA/2010 and cat/GVI.1/JPN/2012/M49 (Martella et al., 2007; Pinto et al., 2012; Takano et al., 2015) , with a nt identity of 90.8-94.0%. This group shared identity of 82.3-85.4% to the recombinant NoV dog/GVI.1/91/2007/ITA and to the GIV.2 strains dog/170/07/ ITA and dog/Thessaloniki/30/08/GR (Martella et al., 2008 (Martella et al., , 2009 Ntafis et al., 2010) , which in turn segregated in a second cluster (91.6-97.8% nt identity). A minor group, distantly related to the feline NoVs (78.2-79.6% nt identity) and to the canine NoVs GVI. Two additional clusters were resolved in the tree that included, respectively, the human GIV.1 strains detected from stool and sewage samples in different geographic settings (Fankhauser et al., 2002; La Rosa et al., 2008; Eden et al., 2012; Ao et al., 2014; Han et al., 2014) and GIV.1 NoVs found in sewage samples in Italy in -2009 (La Rosa et al., 2010 . The nt identity between this two groups was 87.0-91.5%. The ORF2 of strain TE/77-13/ITA was 1719 nt in length and encoded a VP1 capsid protein with a predicted size of 572 aa. ORF3 was 795 nt long and encoded a VP2 protein of 264 aa. A 16-nucleotide (nt) overlap was present in the ORF1-ORF2 junction region. In the complete VP1, the strain TE/77-13/ITA was most closely related (81.0-84.0% nt and 93.0-94.0% aa) to the strains dog/GVI.2/C33/ Viseu/2007/PRT and dog/GVI.2/FD53/2007/ITA, while identity to the feline strain cat/NoV/GVI.1/JPN/2012/M49 and to the canine strain GVI.1/ Bari/91/2007/ITA (Martella et al., 2009 ) was 70.0-71.0% nt and 80.0-81.0% aa. Strain TE/77-13/ITA displayed b54.0% aa identity to animal and human GIV NoVs. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with a selection of complete capsid sequences representative of the Norovirus genus. In the VP1-based tree (Fig. 2) , strain TE/77-13/ITA segregated with the canine NoVs GVI.2/C33/Viseu/2007/PRT and GVI.2/FD53/ 2007/ITA into genogroup GVI, genotype 2. A nucleotide identity plot of the genome of strain TE/77-13/ITA was elaborated, in comparison with the canine strain dog/NoV/GVI.2/C33/Viseu/2007/PRT and the feline strain cat/NoV/GIV.2/CU081210E/USA/2010. By SimPlot (Fig. 3) and RDP (Fig. S1 ) analyses, a putative recombination break-point event was mapped to ORF1-ORF2 junction region at nt 703 with a significant statistical support (P b 0.05).
