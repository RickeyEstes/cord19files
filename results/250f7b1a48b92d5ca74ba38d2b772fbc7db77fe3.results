Despite the widespread and consistent presence of virus specific immunofluorescence in all layers of the adrenal cortex and the tubular epithelium of the kidneys of all animals examined, we found little evidence of ultrastructural cytopathology. Therefore, in this study we focused on the ultrastructural pathologic changes in pancreas, heart, small intestine, and skeletal muscle. In each of these organs and tissues, virus particles indistinguishable from those described previously (spherical particles, 38-39 nm in diameter, with a dense central core and lucent envelope layer) were associated with the round and cylindrical membranous intracisternal structures characteristic of all flavivirus infections (Murphy, 1980).
