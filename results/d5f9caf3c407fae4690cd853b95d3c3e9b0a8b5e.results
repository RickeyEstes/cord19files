A response rate of 82% (n = 41) was attained. After analysis of the data from these 41 hospitals, it was found that the eight domains of disaster resilience have good overall internal statistical consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.780). A comparison of these domains among different categories of hospitals is shown in Table 1 . The mean score of each domain of tertiary grade A hospitals was higher than that of tertiary grade B separately, and statistical difference was confirmed among most domains. The mean score of general hospitals was higher than that of specialized hospitals in most domains. However, only the statistical difference among two domains was tested. The mean score of hospitals that were assigned the mission of regional disaster rescue was higher than those hospitals without this mission. Statistical difference among most domains was tested. In addition, most of the hospitals (92.3%) that has been assigned missions were tertiary A hospitals in the sample. Factor Analysis (using Initial Component Matrix, and Rotated Component Matrix by Varimax with Kaiser Normalization) was chosen to extract key factors of disaster resilience from the eight different domains [20] . After analysis, a four factor solution was identified that can be used to represent all the domains. The score of each factor was obtained by regression analysis applied to the sample. According to Table 2 , each factor score of the hospital sample can be expressed using the following modelling: þ 0:191X 3 -0:080X 4 -0:220X 5 -0:083X 6 -0:147X 7 þ 0:080X 8 F 2 ¼ 0:030 X 1 -0:315 X 2 þ 0:138 X 3 þ 0:443 X 4 þ 0:182 X 5 þ 0:659 X 6 -0:214 X 7 -0:211X 8 F 3 ¼ -0:253 X 1 -0:116 X 2 þ 0:093 X 3 þ 0:007 X 4 þ 0:364 X 5 -0:318 X 6 þ 0:936 X 7 -0:199X 8 F 4 ¼ -0:144 X 1 þ 0:288 X 2 -0:109 X 3 -0:119 X 4 þ 0:148 X 5 -0:167 X 6 -0:148 X 7 þ 0:972X 8 : The four factors were identified and named as: hospital disaster medical care capability (F 1 ), hospital disaster management mechanism (F 2 ), hospital disaster resources (F 3 ) and hospital safety (F 4 ). These four factors account comprehensively for the overall level of disaster resilience capability. The weight of each factor was assigned using the total variance from factor analysis (the weight of each factor is assigned by the proportion of the variance contribution of each principal to the cumulative variance contribution of the four primary factors) [20] . Then the evaluation model of hospital disaster resilience can be established, and the overall level of hospital disaster resilience (F) can be calculated using the model as below: The overall score of disaster resilience (F) for each hospital of this study can be calculated accordingly with their relative rank are listed as Table 3 . Due to ethical issues, the hospital name is replaced with hospital ID in this study. According to Table 2 , there are 20 hospitals whose average of comprehensive scores (F) were positive, which account for about 50% of all of the sample quantity. It illustrated that the hospital disaster resilience in the province was still insufficient with a big difference among those sampled. Similarly, the score of each four factors (F 1 , F 2 , F 3 , and F 4 ) can be calculated and ranked respectively according to Table 2 , and thus to identify the score of factors which tend to be relatively lower in an area and should probably be the highest priority for strengthening resilience. As a result, it was found that in the study sample, the score of hospital disaster management mechanism (F 2 ) was relatively lower than the other three factors with less than 50% of hospitals having positive scores. Below we describe in detail of the status of each of these four factors in tertiary hospitals of the study province. Emergency leadership and cooperation, (highest score = 7); disaster plan, (highest score = 7); disaster stockpile and logistics management, (highest score = 4); hospital safety, (highest score = 9); emergency critical care capability, (highest score = 19); emergency staff, (highest score = 17); trainings and drills (highest score = 15); recovery mechanism (highest score =3). *P < 0.05; Tested by non-parameter test (Mann-Whitney Test).
