During the study period, 112 patients presented with a clinical diagnosis of probable acute gout, of whom 22 were excluded because of acute gastroduodenal ulcer (nϭ1), trauma (nϭ3), serum creatinine level greater than 200 nmol/L (nϭ3), bleeding disorders (nϭ3), history of adverse reactions to NSAID (nϭ5), and suspicion of infectious cause (nϭ6). The remaining 90 patients were randomized, 46 patients to the indomethacin group and 44 patients to the prednisolone group ( Figure 2) . The demographic and other baseline characteristics of the 2 groups were similar (Table 1 ). There was no significant difference in initial mean pain score at rest or with activity between the 2 treatment groups. Five patients in the prednisolone group and 2 patients in the indomethacin group agreed to allow joint aspiration. All were positive for urate crystals and negative for bacterial culture. During the ED phase, the rate of decrease in mean pain score over time both at rest and with activity ( Figure 3 ) was similar for both groups. The mean rate of decrease in pain score at rest for indomethacin was Ϫ6.4Ϯ8.3 (SD) mm per hour and for prednisolone was Ϫ9.5Ϯ10.5 (SD) mm per hour (mean difference 3.2 mm/hour; 95% CI Ϫ0.78 to 7.14 mm/hour; Pϭ.12). The mean rate of decrease in pain score with activity for indomethacin was Ϫ20.3Ϯ9.1 (SD) mm per hour and for prednisolone was Ϫ19.2Ϯ11.2 (SD) mm per hour (mean difference Ϫ1.0 mm/hour; 95% CI Ϫ5.34 to 3.24 mm/hour; Pϭ.63). During the follow-up phase, the rate of decrease in mean pain score over time at rest and with activity ( Figure 4 ) was greater in the prednisolone group than the indomethacin group. The mean rate of decrease in pain score at rest for indomethacin was Ϫ0.3Ϯ0.7 (SD) mm per day and for prednisolone was Ϫ0.7Ϯ1.2 (SD) mm per day (mean difference 0.5 mm/day; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.89 mm/day; Pϭ.04). The mean rate of decrease in pain score with activity for indomethacin was Ϫ1.7Ϯ1.6 (SD) mm per day and for prednisolone was Ϫ2.9Ϯ2.0 (SD) mm per day (mean difference 1.2 mm/day; 95% CI 0.44 to 2.00 mm/day; Pϭ.0026). Although these differences in activity were statistically significant, at no time was the difference in mean pain score greater than 13 mm. At day 14 (the last follow-up day), the same end points were reached by the 2 groups. Both treatment groups showed improvement in the joint swelling and stiffness, but there was no difference in improvement between the 2 groups. In the indomethacin group, 29 (63%) patients experienced adverse effects compared with 12 (27%) patients in the prednisolone group (PϽ.05; Table 2 ). Nausea, indigestion, epigastric pain, and dizziness were significantly more common in the indomethacin group than the prednisolone group. The most common adverse effects in the steroid group were dry mouth and dizziness. Seven patients had adverse effects that were serious enough to require treatment or hospital admission; all were in the indomethacin group (Pϭ.007). Five (11%) patients developed gastrointestinal bleeding (11%; PϽ.05). Their ages ranged from 62 to 84 years. Four were admitted to the hospital, and the fifth was referred to an outpatient clinic. In each case, study medication was stopped, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed; 3 patients had acute gastric ulcers, of whom 2 received adrenaline injection for active bleeding; 2 patients had gastroduodenal ulcers. No patient developed cardiovascular shock, and all ulcers healed after treatment. All patients in the 2 groups consumed acetaminophen during the 14 days. The mean total dose of acetaminophen consumed by the prednisolone group was significantly more than that consumed by the indomethacin group (mean 10.3 g, range 1 to 21 g versus mean 6.4 g, range 1 to 21 g; Pϭ.008). Overall, within 14 days there were 8 patients in the indomethacin group who relapsed and reattended for further treatment compared with 5 patients in the prednisolone group (Pϭnonsignificant). Fifteen patients in the prednisolone group required alternative medication for pain relief compared with 17 patients in the indomethacin group (Pϭnonsignificant).
