Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 . Coinfected and mono-infected patients were similar in most respects, except there was a higher proportion reporting recent alcohol use (63% vs. 38%) and fewer women (16% vs. 31%) among co-infected patients. Co-infected individuals were generally younger (mean 45.4 years) compared to mono-infected (mean 49.6 years) and had been HCV-infected for a shorter period of time (16.5 vs. 20.7 years). These last differences would have been expected knowing the accelerated progression of fibrosis in co-infected patients [2, 3] . Each group was divided into four categories according to liver biopsy score: F1 (n = 50), F2 (n = 49), F3 (n = 50) and F4 (n = 22) based on the Batts-Ludwig scoring system. The characteristics according to fibrosis score are also shown in Table 1 .
