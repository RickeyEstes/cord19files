A total of 1,192 inpatient RVP samples were performed from October 2009 to December 2009. Six hundred and fifteen were positive for a single respiratory virus, and 52 with two viruses. No samples showed infection with three or more viruses. Review of the 52 co-infected samples revealed two samples where detection of a second virus was initially indeterminate but later finalized as negative, and were therefore reclassified as mono-infection. Additionally, a separate co-infected patient was found to have two specimens. Therefore, 617 (51.8%) inpatients with a single agent identified in their RVP were compared to 49 (4.1%) patients with co-infection (see Table 1 ). By uncorrected chi-square analysis, pH1N1 was identified in 49% (24/49) of the co-infected group and 47% (290/617) of the mono-infected control group (p = 0.8). No seasonal influenza A H3 or influenza B was encountered in either group. In co-infected patients, rhinovirus was observed most frequently [78% (38/49) of co-infected and 34% (208/617) of mono-infected patients, respectively (OR 6.8, 95% CI 3. Co-infection with any combination of respiratory viruses compared to mono-infection with any single virus was associated with younger age (mean 8.8 years of age compared to 21 years of age, respectively, p,0.001; Figure 1 ). To adjust for these differences, all subsequent analyses were performed with age as a covariate. Co-infection with any combination of respiratory viruses compared to mono-infection with any single virus was associated with age less than five years (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.5-6.8, p = 0.003; Table 1 ). All co-infected patients were under 60 years of age ( Figure 1 ). Co-infected patients more frequently reported sick contacts (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.6, p = 0.02). Co-infected patients were more frequently HIV seropositive (OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.1-27.7, p = 0.04; Table 2 ). Co-infected patients were more likely to present with complaints of fever/chills, and were more frequently tachypneic at presentation (36.461.7 breaths per minute in coinfected patients compared to 32.560.5 breaths per minute in mono-infected patients, p = 0.03). Both groups had similar numbers of chest radiographs (84% and 86% of co-infected and mono-infected patients, respectively). Co-infection was more often associated with interstitial opacities (OR 7.5, 95% CI 3.4-16.5, p,0.001). Once hospitalized, oseltamivir was used more often in coinfected than mono-infected patients [80% (39/49) and 62% (385/ Table 4 .
