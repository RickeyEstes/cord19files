The changes in the GA observed in these cells were identical to those seen in L2-infected cells. Morphological changes of the GA during coronavirus infection of L2 cells (4, 8, 16, 24 , and 48 hr) were examined by immunocytochemistry using organelle-specific Changes of the GA following infection of L2 cells with antibodies (Croul et al., 1988 (Croul et al., , 1990 Gonatas et al., 1989) . fusion-defective mutants and a fusion-negative strain Typical infection of L2 cells with MHV-A59 caused syncyof MHV tia formation of the entire monolayer within 24 hr and complete cytolysis within 48 hr.

At 24 hr of the organelle seen during infections with the wild-type MHV-A59. Specifically, cells infected with either B11 or postinfection, the process of fragmentation of the GA and its relocation in the centers of syncytia, as well as the C12 mutants displayed both central and peripheral aggregates of finely granular GA (Figs. 1H and 1I). The rearrangement of the nuclei in a ring formation within the syncytia, was complete (Figs. 1C and 1F) .

Uninfected cells, however, had completely recovered from the BFA effect 16 -24 hr later. These on the morphology and kinetics of coronavirus infection.

In uninfected L2 cells incubated for 1 hr When cells were treated continuously with BFA during infection there was dispersion of the GA, lack of syncytia with 5 mg/ml of BFA, immunostaining with anti-MG-160 showed a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern consistent formation, and no detectable viral titers (Fig. 4) . If BFA treatment began at 4 or 6 hr after viral inoculation, the with the known redistribution of MG-160 and other Golgi markers within the RER (Doms et al., 1989; Lip- effect of this treatment on infection was similar to the effect observed after continuous BFA treatment (i.e., re-pincott- Schwartz et al., 1989; Johnston et al., 1994) .

However, when the BFA treatment began 12 hr or more after viral infection cells had diffuse staining of the GA when observed 8 hr postinfection as did uninfected cells inoculation, there were relatively minimal effects on syncytia formation, and viral titers were 1-2 logs lower as following a similar treatment with BFA.

Therefore, when cells were infected with MHV-A59 inoculation and continued through the entire infection or 1, 3, or 5 hr after inoculation, there was no significant prior to or at the same time of treatment with BFA, the effect of the drug on the GA was not abolished 16 or effect on the ability of the virus to form syncytia 24 hr by cisternae derived from the intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi stacks, thus acquiring two membranes in one step (Sodeik et al., 1993 (Sodeik et al., , 1995 . The second wrapping cisternae in vaccinia virus assembly is derived from the trans Golgi network (Schmelz et al., 1994) . In CMV, ultrastructural as well as biochemical studies suggested that short-term exposure of infected cultures to BFA during the late infectious cycle primarily prevented Golgi-dependent processes, e.g., envelopment of naked cytoplasmic nucleocapsids in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and normal processing of glycoprotein B (Eggers et al., 1992) . In Uukuniemi virus, a member of the bunyaviridae, immunofluorescent staining indicated that G1 glycoprotein expressed alone localized to the GA. G2 expressed alone was associated with the RER (Melin et al., 1995) . Coronavirus MHV M glycoprotein (previously known as E1) is targeted to the GA and contains a retention signal for the GA (Machamer et al., 1990; Swift and Machamer, 1991; Armstrong and Patel, 1991) . Previous reports have shown that the GA undergoes rearrangement (Ho et al., 1990) and fragmentation (Campadelli et al., 1993) in viral infections. The data presented here detail the changes in the morphology of the GA in cells infected by a virus which induces the formation of syncytia. In coronavirus infection, the virus displays Cultures were incubated with virus (") for 1 hr and exposed to BFA (ٖ) for various periods.

These results virus infection (Ho et al., 1990) or herpes simplex virus suggest that the interval of 4-16 hr postinfection is the infection (Campadelli et al., 1993) . Since the aggregation most significant period requiring an intact GA for viral of the fragmented GA in the centers of syncytia has not replication and syncytia formation. This conclusion is been previously reported, we investigated the GA in cells based on infection at an m.o.i. of 1 PFU/cell which may infected with LaCrosse bunyavirus, which is known to be an asynchronous infection.
