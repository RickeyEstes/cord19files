DC-SIGNR alleles with five and six repeat units are efficiently expressed at the cell surface and bind to viral glycoproteins DC-SIGNR alleles with less than seven repeat units are frequently found in Caucasians (Bashirova et al., 2001) ; however, it is unclear if such alleles exhibit defects in pathogen binding. To address this question, we functionally analyzed published DC-SIGN/R constructs (Pö hlmann et al., 2001a (Pö hlmann et al., , 2001c containing seven repeat units and patient derived DC-SIGNR alleles harboring five, six and seven repeat units (Liu et al., 2005, in press) ( Fig. 1) . Except of the differences in the neck region, the DC-SIGNR variants analyzed exhibited identical amino acid sequences. We first investigated the importance of the number of repeat units in the DC-SIGNR neck region for lectin expression. Therefore, the lectin variants were transiently expressed in 293T cells and lectin expression was analyzed by FACS (Fig. 2 ). All lectins were expressed at the cell surface efficiently and to comparable degrees, indicating that the presence of five or six repeat units does not compromise DC-SIGNR expression. We next assessed if the DC-SIGNR variants bind to the glycoproteins of EBOV, SARS-CoV and HIV-1, all known ligands of wt DC-SIGNR. For these binding studies, chimeric proteins were employed in which the GP 1 subunit of the EBOV glycoprotein, the S1 unit of the SARS-CoV-S protein or the gp120 subunit of the HIV-1 envelope protein were fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin. These proteins, but not the corresponding immunoglobulin control protein, bound efficiently and to similar levels to cells expressing the DC-SIGNR variants, while no appreciable binding to control transfected cells was measured (Figs. 3A, B). Thus, the allelic DC-SIGNR forms with five and six repeat units are capable of complexing viral glycoproteins.
