During the 8-month review period, a total of 125 children were admitted to the hospital with CAP, 31 of whom had CFPNGS testing obtained at the discretion of the pediatric infectious disease attending physician. Of these 31 children, 2 were excluded due to a diagnosed underlying genetic disorder and 14 due to chronic comorbid conditions. Patient demographics for the remaining cohort demonstrated an average age of 4.16 years and 53% male gender (Table 1 ). The average length of hospital stay was 14 days, reflecting the fact that CFPNGS tended to be requested only in cases of complicated pneumonia. In total, 10 of the 15 children were diagnosed with complicated CAP (pneumonia with pleural effusion or empyema), and 9 required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Nine children were treated with thoracoscopy for parapneumonic effusion or empyema, and 6 children required surgical intervention with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Table 2 , only 1 of 15 (6.7%) patients had a positive blood culture at the time of admission. This culture yielded Streptococcus pneumoniae, and CFPNGS was also positive in this case. Pneumococci were identified in 8 additional cases only by CFPNGS (Fig. 1, Table 2 ). Respiratory cultures were obtained only in intubated children as endotracheal aspirates and yielded putative causal organisms in 33% of the study population (7 positive cultures from 5 patients). Of the respiratory samples, only 1 of the 3 patient cultures was concordant with the CFPNGS diagnostic test (patient 1 identified S. pneumoniae from the ETT and blood cultures as well as by CFPNGS). The 2 other patients with positive respiratory cultures were patient 10 (identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa from sputum and had negative CFPNGS) and patient 3
