A total of 234 medical laboratory workers was recruited to participate in the study. The majority ( participants were vaccinated against HBV as this a requirement by health law in Saudi Arabia before employment in medical laboratories. The results showed that about 24% of the sample had experienced a needlestick injury. The results showed that the needlestick injury was associated with private clinics (P < 0.05) and lack of training on biosafety ( Table 2 ). The participants were asked about capping needle directly after use. Approximately, 49% reported that they always do that, whereas 15% reported doing that most of the times (Table 3 ). Recapping needle after use, was associated with governmental clinics (P < 0.01), technician/residency staff (P < 0.01) and lack of training (P < 0.05, Table 3 ). Table 4 shows the incidence of occupational infection among participants. The incidence was about 33% and it was associated with college degrees (P < 0.05) and training on biosafety (P < 0.05, Table 4 ). Figure 1 shows the awareness of participants about disinfection procedures and infection routes. The results showed that the majority of participants reported excellent to very good awareness levels (> 80%).
