To ensure the rightness of the simulation results, we consider the fact that the valid parameter sets should obey the following rules (Qi et al., in press-a, in press-b; Bar-Or et al., 2000) : (1) the model must contain oscillations. This is important as there has been experimental evidence that oscillations occur between P53 and MDM2 after cell stress; (2) the mechanism used to mathematically describe the degradation of P53 by MDM2 is accurate only for low concentrations of P53; (3) the concentration of P53 # is much higher than that of inactive P53 after the system reaching an equilibrium. Based on above rules and the existing parameters used in the previous models (Qi et al., in press-a, in press-b; Ma et al., 2005; Bar-Or et al., 2000) , we obtained the kinetics of cellular responding radiotherapy through simulation platform in MATLAB7.0. The detailed parameter sets used in our model can be found in Tables A1-A3 of Appendix A.
