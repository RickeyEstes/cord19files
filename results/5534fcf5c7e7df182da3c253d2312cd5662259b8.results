Overexpression of yeast eIF4AIII-like Fal1p or Dbp3p DEAD-box RNA helicases and the orthologous plant AtRH2 and DDX5-like AtRH5 helicases enhances TBSV RNA replication in yeast and plants To characterize the functions of host RNA helicases in TBSV replication, first we overexpressed 5 yeast RNA helicases in yeast and tested their effects on TBSV replicon (rep)RNA accumulation via Northern blotting (Fig. S1 ). These helicases were chosen from the 11 previously identified yeast helicases from several complementary high throughput screens using yeast and tombusviruses [26, 28, 35, 36, 38, 53, 54] . Overexpression of all 5 host RNA helicases increased TBSV accumulation, with the yeast Dbp3p showing the highest (over 2-fold increase) stimulation ( Fig. S1A-B) . The overexpression of these host helicases did not affect the accumulation of p33 replication protein ( Fig. S1A-B) , suggesting that the effects of this group of RNA helicases are not through increased translation of viral replication proteins. Altogether, the observed 30-to-140% increase in TBSV RNA accumulation due to overexpression of these yeast helicases is significant since overexpression of most yeast proteins nonspecifically reduces TBSV accumulation by 20-30% as demonstrated before based on individual overexpression of 5,500 yeast proteins [26, 54] . Thus, these helicases likely play stimulatory roles in TBSV replication. For additional in-depth studies, we have selected the yeast Dbp3p and the highly similar Fal1p (human eIF4AIII-like) together with the orthologous Arabidopsis AtRH2 (Fal1p ortholog and human eIF4AIII-like) and AtRH5 (Dbp3p ortholog, human DDX5-like) helicases [44] ]. Overexpression of AtRH2 and AtRH5 stimulated (up to 3-fold increase) TBSV repRNA accumulation in yeast (Fig. 1A) . The stimulation of tombusvirus accumulation (we used Cucumber necrosis virus, CNV, which is very closely related to TBSV) was also robust in Nicotiana benthamiana host plants when AtRH2 and AtRH5 RNA helicases were overexpressed (up to ,2-
