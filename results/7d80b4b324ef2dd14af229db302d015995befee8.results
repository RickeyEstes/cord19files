A total of 214 patients and parents or guardians of patients granted informed consent and were enrolled into the study. Data from nine subjects were removed due to insufficient quantity of residual nasopharyngeal samples. Four more patients were also removed as their paper charts were not traceable. In total, 201 residual samples from unique patients were collected (200 nasopharyngeal swabs and one endotracheal lavage from an intubated patient). Subjects were mostly male (56%) with a mean age of 45 months ( Table 1) . Seventy percent (141/201) of patients enrolled met criteria for SARI. Overall, WU and KI viruses were detected in 13% (26/201) and 3% (6/201) of patients, respectively. Other respiratory viruses were detected, including adenovirus, parainfluenza, enterovirus, RSV, and metapneumovirus at much lower prevalence. One percent (2/201) of patients had evidence of both WU and KI infection. There were four cases where evidence of WU virus was found with one other virus in the screening panel (parainfluenza virus, RSV, metapneumovirus, rotavirus) yet this number was too low to perform statistical analysis. There were no detected cases of polyomavirus and bacterial coinfection. WU was the most prevalent out of all the viruses detected. Fifty-eight percent of patients infected with WU met clinical criteria for SARI. The prevalence of KI in this study was too low to perform multivariate modeling. Bivariate screening of risk factors for association with SARI revealed six variables to be potentially significant predictors (p â‰¤ 0.1): presence of runny nose, diagnosis of asthma, diagnosis of pneumonia, molecular detection of WU, and receiving oral antibiotics during admission. A stepwise, backward elimination logistic regression model generated from these variables revealed that SARI patients were at higher risk of presenting with a runny nose (adjusted PR = 1.27, 95% C.I. 1.06-1.51) and receiving oral antibiotics during admission (adjusted PR = 1.39, C.I. 1.17-1.65). Neither molecular evidence of WU nor KI were significantly associated with other factors of severe respiratory disease gathered in this study ( Table 1) . In an examination of risk factors for "requiring supplemental O2, " the multivariate model revealed the use of bronchodilators and evidence of RSV infection to be significant predictors ( Table 2) . Multivariate modeling of the outcome "use of intravenous (IV) fluids" revealed a negative association with Comparison of means was performed using student's t-test. Bivariate analyses were performed using the chi-square or Fisher exact test. Adjusted prevalence ratios were calculated using a stepwise, backwards elimination unconditional logistic regression model. (*) Values for asthma diagnosis were not suitable for relative risk calculation and required logistic modeling. This variable was not included in adjusted comparisons as convergence could not be achieved. a diagnosis of bronchitis ( Table 3 ). The use of IV fluids and receiving oral antibiotics during admission showed a positive association with the outcome "increased length of stay (LOS), " while both diagnosis of bronchitis and asthma showed an inverse association ( Table 4) . Multivariate modeling to predict risk factors for oral antibiotics during hospitalization could not be completed due to lack of convergence, although a diagnosis of asthma or a diagnosis of pneumonia were trending toward significance ( Table 5) . When assessing prescription of bronchodilators during hospitalization as the outcome, multivariate modeling revealed a diagnosis of bronchitis and use of supplemental oxygen to have a positive association and presence of RSV to have a small positive association, while diagnosis of asthma could not be included due to failure to converge in the final model.
