A total of 7863 contacts who had been exposed to 206 probable cases of SARS were served with an HQO, giving a ratio of 38 contacts per case. The age distribution and contact history of the SARS cases and quarantined persons are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. No HQOs were served on the contacts of 32 probable cases who were subsequently diagnosed by laboratory tests because the incubation period had lapsed. Those under HQO belonged to 5072 households, giving a ratio of 25 affected households per case. In 163 of the households, all the members had to be served with an HQO. An additional 4331 contacts were not quarantined but put on daily telephone surveillance for 10 days as a precaution. In total, 58 of the SARS cases had been among the 12,194 persons on either HQO or telephone surveillance prior to their diagnosis, giving a yield of 0.48%. Most of the 7863 persons served with an HQO understood and complied well with quarantine. Of those, 194 (2.5%) activated the 993 ambulance service to seek medical consultation at the TTSH/CDC. However, another 26 (0.3%) persons broke their quarantine for invalid or frivolous reasons. As a deterrent, the Subordinate Court sentenced 1 offender to 6 months imprisonment for violating his HQO on multiple occasions and flaunting the fact that he had violated his HQO. Another 2 offenders were detained in an isolation facility to serve the remaining of their HQO period for violating their HQO on at least 3 occasions. The rest were first-time offenders who strictly observed their HQO after being issued a warning letter and an electronic wrist tag. The tag was linked to a telephone line and would alert the authorities immediately if the quarantined person tried to leave the house again or break the tag. The bulk of the costs to mount the large-scale quarantine operations during the SARS outbreak was the U.S. $3 million incurred by MOH in engaging CISCO between April and July 2003 as the provider of goods and services to administer and enforce HQOs ( Table 3) . Payouts of the HQO allowance scheme amounted to U.S. $1.8 million, and another U.S. $0.4 million was incurred providing the 993 call center and ambulance services. Not counted but related to the conduct of quarantine operations were the contact tracing and home visits that were carried out by MOH and other agencies using internal resources. Similarly, because most people served quarantine within their own home, they assumed the cost of quarantine housing.
