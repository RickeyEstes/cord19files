Expression of viral antigen in glial cell cultures . Mixed glial, enriched oligodendrocyte and enriched astrocyte cultures were derived either from newborn or 3 week old C57BL/6 mice as described in 'Materials and methods' ." Such cultures were infected with MHV-A59 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID) 50/cell and 3 days post-infection were stained by double immunofluorescence for viral antigen and cell-specific markers . Approximately 30% of glial fibrillary acidic protein (G FAP)-positive cells (astrocytes) 73 and 10% of galactocerebroside (GaIC) 14 positive cells (oligodendrocytes) expressed cytoplasmic viral antigens . Figure 1 shows an example of cells that were positive for GaIC and viral antigens . Viral antigen was not detected in control mock-infected cultures or in cultures that were incubated with normal mouse serum . There was no obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) in infected cultures observed with the light microscope (during a period of 45 days) as compared to uninfected cultures and there was no evidence of syncytia formation which is observed in lytic infections of MHV-A59 in vitro in 17CI-1 mouse fibroblasts ." Thus at least some oligodendrocytes and some astrocytes can be infected by MHV-A59 in vitro . Because only 10% of the oligodendrocytes and 30% astrocytes contained viral antigen we wanted to determine whether all cells could be infected . Thus mixed glial cultures were infected with MHV-A59 at MOTs of 0 .1, 1, 5, 50 TCID 50 /cell . The percentage of infected cells did not significantly increase with the higher multiplicities . There was no obvious CPE during an observation period of 1 week . To determine whether glial cells may be infected by MHV-A59 in vivo as well, as in vitro, 5-day old mice were infected by intracerebral inoculation with 400 TCID 50 of MHV-A59 (a lethal dose for suckling mice) and sacrificed one day later . Mixed glial (Fig . 2) . In glial cell cultures, at both MOI=1 TCID 50 /cell (Fig . 2) and MO1=50 TCID 50/cell (data not shown), the kinetics of production of infectious virus were similar to the kinetics in 17C1-cells . However the glial cultures were strikingly different in that there was no CPE . The fact that similar titers of virus were produced by cultures infected at MOI of 1 or 50 TCID 50 /cell is consistent with the fact that the percentage of cells expressing viral antigen also did not increase at higher MOIs (see above) . Since the glial cells were not destroyed by infection, we continued to culture these cells . As shown in Fig . 3 were maintained . There was no CPE observed in any of the cultures for the time courses monitored in Figs 3 and 4, that is up to 45 days for the mixed glial cultures . There were no morphological changes in the cultures that could be correlated with fluctuations in viral titers released .
