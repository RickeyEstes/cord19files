Stool samples were taken from 123 patients and viruses were detected either by electron microscopy or culture in 52 of these patients. The results are listed in Table I . Three morphological types of virus (rotavirus, adenovirus and 'small round virus') were observed by electron microscopy but no astroviruses, caliciviruses or coronaviruses were detected Cosgrove, 1975, 1976; Caul, Paver and Clark, 1975) . Adenoviruses and enteroviruses (polioviruses of two types and echoviruses of six types) were isolated in culture. The adenovirus cultured was not detected by electron microscopy, and no virus was cultured from the stool in which the 'small round virus' was observed. Four patients (three per cent) died in hospital following admission for diarrhoea and one child died during a subsequent admission with intussus- ception. Three had additional causes contributing to the severity of their illness: measles, measles and pneumonia, and marasmic kwashiorkor respectively. The fourth was severely dehydrated on admission. All of the children except two were under four years of age when admitted to hospital. The remaining two were six and seven years old. The numbers were too small for further analysis of the age distribution to be possible, but they fell into the age group in which most viruses have been observed. Seventy-seven of the children (63 per cent) were still receiving breast milk on admission, though 68 of these were being weaned. In this part of Africa, weaning, usually on to maize porridge, is a prolonged process, and children may be offered breast milk up to two to three years of age. A comparison of the type of feeding with the viruses identified is shown in Table II . It is apparent that breast feeding did not prevent the acquisition of viruses with rotaviruses being found most frequently (28 out of 77 (36 per cent)). In the three groups shown in Table II five out of nine children (56 per cent) in the 'breast fed' group had virus in their stools, 34 out of 68 children (50 per cent) in the 'breast and other food' group, and 13 out of 44 children (30 per cent) in the 'other food' group. The lowest rate was in the 'other food' group, which was also the oldest group with an average age of 22 months, compared with four months of the 'breast-fed' and the eight months of the 'breast milk with other food' group. Though breast feeding did not prevent the acquisition of microorganisms it Six of the 52 infected patients had a dual infection (see footnote on Table I ). might reduce the severity of the disease. Tables III and IV explore this possibility by comparing firstly, the organism with the severity of the disease and secondly, severity with diet. The numbers are small but there is no suggestion that any of the viruses were associated with a more severe disease. Table V . In five stools a virus was detected.
