Seven interviewers called 6,603 telephone numbers in 4 weeks. Of these, 2,596 were invalid (fax or answering machines), and those reached at 1,765 numbers were ineligible (either non-Cantonese speakers, resident <12 months, or businesses). Of 2,240 eligible respondents, 1,256 declined to participate or complete the survey (556 were "too busy," 688 refused for other reasons), leaving 986 eligible respondents who completed the survey, a response rate of 44% (986/2,240). The sample comprised 589 women and 397 men closely matching the most recent population census data. Men had a wider age distribution than did women (χ 2 = 16.3, degrees of freedom [df] 5, p = 0.006), more likely to be single (χ 2 = 23.84, df 3, p<0.001), born in Hong Kong (χ 2 = 21.67, df 4, p<0.001), and better educated (χ 2 = 10.52, df 3, p = 0.015) ( Table 1) .
