Synthetic constructs were used to assess the performance of the pan-flavivirus, pan-alphavirus and pan-dengue assays and determine if the pan-viral assays were able to detect a wide selection of both flavi-and alphaviruses. To determine the feasibility of using urine as a primary sample, fresh urine was spiked with both NATtrol Zika Stock (Qualitative) (Manufacturer, CATALOG# NATZIKV-ST) and NATtrol Zika Virus Range Verification Panel (Manufacturer, CATALOG# NATZIKV-RV). The whole cells and control materials were processed as previously described and compared to the same samples spiked directly into water. No significant delays between the urine samples and water controls were observed indicating that urine is not inhibitory in the sample processing method and suitable to use as a primary patient sample. In order to determine the LLOD of the assays, the Vircell total run control (whole inactivated viruses containing a mixture of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, CHIKV and ZIKV in a plasma matrix) and genomic RNA from DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4 and CHIKV (Vircell, Valencia, Spain) and were used. Samples were diluted in human serum to simulate clinical samples and processed as previously described followed by amplification in ten individual replicates. LLOD was defined as the lowest dilution in which all ten PCR 3base technology and its application to dengue diagnosis replicates gave a positive signal. The LLOD for the flavivirus assay was found to be 0.63 copies per PCR, 2.18 copies per PCR for the pan-dengue assay and 1.25 copies for the pan-alphavirus assay using whole virus particles. Interestingly, the whole viral samples performed better than the purified RNAs when diluted in human serum (Table 3) . No cross reactivity was observed when testing the assay against 150,000-300,000 copies of viral nucleic acids introduced into the PCR reaction using the targets listed in Table 2 . In all cases the EPC was positive, as was the positive control, indicting that the lack of amplification was not due to failure of any component of the assay or the presence of PCR inhibitors. To further demonstrate the utility of the pan-species assays, QCMD panels were tested. The results obtained were in 100% agreement with the expected results when decoded (Table 4) . Bold samples represent "educational samples", which may or may not be detected by all participating laboratories as these samples mimic a clinical sample at the LLOD of most assays.
