The results showed that all the colds groups felt significantly less alert and had lower hedonic tone (were less happy and sociable) than the healthy controls (alertness factor: F 3.191= 10.5, p B.0001; Hedonic tone: F 3.191= 5.2, pB .005). These results are shown in Table I . Tukey tests showed that the different colds groups were not significantly different from one another. Simple reaction time was also significantly slower in all colds groups (F 3.191= 3.89, p B .01) . This is also shown in Table I . In contrast, there was no significant effect of having a cold on the accuracy or speed of responses in the detection task. The next issue examined was whether, for the colds groups only, there were associations between symptom severity and duration and the mood and performance scores. Similarly, correlations between nasal secretion weight (an objective measure of symptoms) and the mood and performance scores were computed. There were significant correlations between the symptom checklist scores and ratings of alertness and hedonic tone (alertness: − 0.23; hedonic tone: −0.23, both p's B .05), with higher symptom severity going with greater negative affect. This is not too surprising as both sets of measures were subjective ratings and the correlations probably reflect individual differences in these ratings. None of the correlations with length of cold nor nasal secretion were significant and the performance measures were not related to the symptom scores. The results from this study confirm previous findings of studies of both experimentallyinduced and naturally-occurring illnesses. Furthermore, they extend our knowledge of naturally-occurring illnesses by showing that effects generalise across different viruses and that the objective changes in performance do not reflect symptom severity or duration. The next study tried to replicate these results using a prospective design. In order to remove the effects of individual differences in mood and performance analyses of covariance with the baseline data as covariates and the second session data as dependent variables were used. Preliminary analyses showed that length of time between first and second test session had little effect and covariance was a valid technique here due to the parallel regression lines of the colds and healthy groups. The results again showed that all colds groups felt less alert and had lower hedonic tone than the healthy subjects (alertness: F 3.183= 10.24, p B .0001; Hedonic tone: F 3.183= 3.9, pB.01). Tukey tests showed there were no significant differences between the different colds groups. These data are shown in Table II . Similarly, reaction times were slower in the colds groups (F 3.183 = 4.39, p B.005). These effects are shown in Table II . Again, there were no significant differences between the groups with regard to performance of the repeated digits task. Correlations between symptom scores (colds groups only) and mood and performance measures again showed that high symptom scores were related to greater negative mood (alertness correlation: − 0.27, p B.05; Hedonic tone: − 0.32, pB .01). None of the other correlations were significant.
