The age ranged from 2Â½ months to 84 years, 8 cases were children under the age of 2, one was between 2 and 15 years old, 23 were between 16 and 60, and 10 were older than 60 years. Twenty-eight were male and 14 were female. In five cases, no microorganisms were found. Bacteria were found in 36 (85.7%) of the cases, amounting to 247 of 354 (69.7%) samples taken. Viruses were found in 3 of 22 cases (1.4%). Fungi were found in eight cases (19.0%), amounting to 21 of 354 (5.9%) samples taken. No other named fungi than Candida albicans was found. In one case C. albicans was the only microbiological finding. Bacteria were found in 16 cases where they were not related to COD. Virus was only found in one case which was not classified as an infectious COD. In the 42 autopsies COD was classified as infectious in 18 cases (42.8%), distributed among: three cases of viral pneumonia (16.7%), three cases of bacterial pneumonia (16.7%), four cases of sepsis (22.2%), two cases of meningitis (11.1%), two cases of peritonitis, one due to accidental perforation of the intestine during surgery and one due to perforated appendicitis (11.1%), one case of pericarditis (5.6%) and three cases of combined opiate poisoning and infection (16.7%), Table 1 . The COD of the remaining 24 cases, which were not related to microbiological findings, are listed in Table 2 . In all, 52 different microorganisms were found including one report of ''normal flora'', Table 3 shows the distribution. Testing in one case, classified as viral pneumonia COD, did not yield any positive viral findings. However the histological findings were consistent with viral pneumonia (interstitial pneumonitis), and the person had been treated with antiviral antibiotics before death which could cause the negative viral findings [7] . CRP was measured in 33 cases. In nine cases CRP was below 8 mg/L. Regarding the 18 cases classified as infectious COD, CRP values were below 8 mg/L in two cases, 13 cases had elevated CRP values (p < 0.05), and in three cases no measurement was performed. Of the 18 cases with an infectious COD, histological examination was of importance in 14 cases (77.8%). In two of the 14 cases no microorganisms were found but the histological changes, CRP values and other information lead to the conclusion (one case of viral pneumonia and one case of neutrophilic pneumonia in an opiate poisoning case). In four cases, histological findings did not show inflammation to support the microbiological findings, however CRP levels above 160 mg/L and the bacteriological results were sufficient to verify the microbiologically related COD.
