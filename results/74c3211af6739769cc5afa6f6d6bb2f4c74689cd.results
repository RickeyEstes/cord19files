Among the 594 stool and blood samples analyzed, 279 were from cases and 315 were from controls.The characteristics of the studied population are described in Table 2 . The more frequent serotype, HIV-l, was identified in 90.9% (289/318) of the population; HIV-2 was identified in 5.3% (17/318), and 3.8% (12/318) of the study population were co-infected by both serotypes HIV-l and HIV-2. As expected, CD4 geometric mean cell counts were lower in HIV-infected than in HIVseronegative patients in cases as well as in controls (P < 0.000001). CD4 count was also significantly lower in diarrheic patients in HIV+ (P = 0.0007) as well as in HIV-(P < 0.0001) patients. There were no significant differences of age or gender among the four groups. Identified bacterial pathogens are listed in Table 3 . No Yersinia spp, Vibrio spp, Plesiomonas spp, EHEC, Clostridium perfringens, or Mycobacterium spp were identified during this study Shigella spp and Salmonella spp were the most frequently identified bacterial pathogens during acute diarrhea; 28 Shigella were identified: Sbigella jlexneri (n = 14), Shigella dysenteriae (n = 12) and Shigella sonnei (n = 2); no Shigella boydii were identified. All Shigella strains were from cases except one S. sonnei isolated from a HIV-seronegative patient without diarrhea. No asymptomatic carriage of Shigella was observed in HIV-infected patients. Eighteen strains of Salmonella enterica (15 in cases; 3 in controls) were identified. The various serotypes were S. enteritidis (5 among cases; 1 among controls), S. kentacky (2 among cases), S. typhi (1 among cases), S. sangera (1 among cases), S. magherafelt (1 among cases), S. tambacounda (2 among cases; 1 among controls), S. glostrup (1 among cases), and S. typhimurium (Table 4 ). Concerning the prevalence of different E. coli pathotypes identified by PCR (see Table 4 ), at least one target gene was found in 205 (34.5%) patients, and a target gene was found more often in cases (125/279,44.8%) than in controls @O/315,25.3%), P = 0.00001. Results show a high prevalence of afa gene in cases (66/219) as well as in controls (63/3 15); consequently pathogenic E. coli were E. coli strains with at least one virulence factor different from afu gene. Inversely, enteroaggregative and enteroinvasive E. coli seem to be closely related respectively to chronic and acute diarrhea. Isolation of enteroinvasive E. coli (ipaH gene ) was not dependent on HIV-serostatus, and no asymptomatic carriage was found for this pathotype. In contrast, enteroaggregative E. coli (EAgg gene) was isolated more frequently in HIV-seropositive patients Only one strain of E. coli carrying three virulence genes (afu, eae, EAgg) was identified in an HIV-seropositive patient with chronic diarrhea. Except for the ipaH gene, other virulence genes were identified in patients with CD4 count ranging from 11 to 259 cells/mm3. There was good correlation between genotypic and phenotypic characterization of enterotoxigenic and enteroinvasive E. coli. Two strains were positive in the GMl-ELBA test for heat-labile enterotoxin and in the suckling mouse model assay for heat-stable enterotoxin; all strains carrying @aH gene were positive for the guinea pig keratoconjunctivitis Sereny test. Unusual bacterial etiologies like Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 7), Citrobacter freundii (n = 4) were found in immunocompromised patients with diarrhea. One of the Citrobacter spp strains was isolated from a 6&-year-old HIVseronegative woman with diabetes. The other strains were from HIV-seropositive patients with very low CD4 counts. In all these cases oral antibiotic therapy proved to be effective. These opportunistic bacterial pathogens were examined for HEp-2 cell adherence, and all showed a diffuse adherence pattern except three strains of K. pneumoniae, which displayed the "stacked-brick" aggregative adherence pattern typical of enteroaggregative E. coli strains and one strain of C. freundii (different from the one isolated from the 68-y-old woman) displaying the localized adherence attaching and effacing pattern typical of enteropathogenic E. coli. Polymerase chain reaction for E. coli virulence genes was negative for almost all strains except one K.pneumoniae with EAgg gene and one C. freundii gene with eae gene. Table 5 illustrates the antibiotic susceptibility of the 117 strains of bacterial enteropathogens recovered from cases and controls. All isolates were susceptible to am&a&, gentamicin, broadspectrum cephalosporin, and ciprofloxacin. Shigella spp and pathogenic E. coli were highly resistant to ampicillin, ticarcillin, cotrimoxazole, and tetracycline. Most enteropathogenic strains remained susceptible to ampicillin and clavulanic acid, third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Interestingly, Salmonella strains remain susceptible to almost all antibiotics except tetracyclines. Prevalence of different parasites, C. albicans, and Rotaviruses are shown in Table 6 . A high level of asymptomatic carriage of A. lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura was observed. In the immunocompetent patients, the two main parasitic agents involved in diarrhea were Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia. The main opportunistic parasites are Microsporidium (9.4%), Cryptosporidium (8.2%), and Isospora belli Salmonella spp + Microsporidium (n = l), Cryptosporidium + A. lumbricoides (n = l), Salmonella + G. lamblia + T. trichiura (n = l), Microsporidium + E. coli + A. lumbricoides (n = 2), I. belli + 1: trichuria + A. lumbricoides (n = l), Cryptosporidium + C. albicans (n = 2), Shigella + A. lumbricoides (n = 2). The risk of developing diarrhea increased progressively as CD4 counts fell below 200 cells/mm" ( Table 7) . The other independent risk factor was poor housing. Also patients younger than 40 years of age tended to be at higher risk.
