On the data collection, the 12 participants had a T EC of 36.57 ± 0.41; 36,08 ± 0.45; 36.43 ± 0.49 and a T C of 37.17 ± 0.25; 37.66 ± 0.38; 37.39 ± 0.33 for rest, exercise and post exercise conditions respectively. The validity of the T EC compared with T C was verified by a Bland-Altman analysis, showing low levels of agreement between pairs of measures (Fig. 2) . Pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni post hoc test showed significant differences (p < 0.01) between T EC and T C in all analyzed moments (Fig. 3) . The intraclass correlation coeficient (ICC) and confidence intervals (CI) for T EC compared with T C values showed 0.49 (CI: −0.09; 0.82), −0.14 (CI: −0.65; 0.44), and −0.25 (CI: −0.70; 0.25), respectively for R15, E30 and P30 moments. These results revealed that the validity of T EC compared with T C can be considered as unsatisfactory following the principles of Lee et al. (1989) . The obtained typical errors of the measure intervals were large, (ie, ± 0.5°C; ± 0.8°C and ± 0.9°C respectively for R15, E30 and P30 moments).
