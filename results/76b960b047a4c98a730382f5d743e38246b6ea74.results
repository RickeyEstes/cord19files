The study enrolled 3431 children between 2007 to 2013. Among those, 374 (11%) had multiple viruses detected in their NP swabs, for 59 presence of viruses in the NP was not determined, and were excluded from the analyses, thus the total study population was 2998. Among all cases with a virus detected, HRV, RSV, and Influenza A were the most frequently detected viruses, with 569 (33.5% of all viral detections), 455 (26.8%), and 282 (16.6%) detections, respectively (Table 1 and Figure 1 ). Counts of bocavirus (HBoV), coronavirus (CoV), and human parainfluenza 1, 2, and 4 viruses (HPIV1-4) were less than 70 and are reported in the supplementary material.
