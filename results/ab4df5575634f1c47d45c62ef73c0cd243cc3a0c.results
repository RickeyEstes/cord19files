Only 1 subject was lost to follow-up, and none of the remaining 101 subjects discontinued because of side effects from the lozenges. A mean total of 60.4 lozenges were taken by each subject for the study, which averaged 9.9 lozenges per subject per day as long as symptoms persisted. To achieve masking, sucrose octaacetate (0.169 mg) was used in the placebo, and both the placebo and zinc lozenges were peppermint flavored. A review of subjects' diary entries revealed that 4 subjects noted a chalky taste, 4 experienced a metallic aftertaste, and 3 complained of an upset stomach; none of the subjects noted a bitter taste. Most subjects liked the peppermint flavor. Table II shows the mean duration of all symptoms (duration of each symptom + number of symptoms), the mean duration of the longest-lasting symptom (symptom with the longest duration), and the mean severity rating (a mean score for all symptoms) by treatment group. An independent groups t test showed that the mean duration of all symptoms was significantly lower in the zinc group (3.8 * 0.2 days) than in the placebo group (5.1 * 0.4 days) (P = 0.008) (Figure 1 ). The mean duration of the longest-lasting symptom was also significantly lower in the zinc group (5.3 * 0.4 days) than in the placebo group (7.1 * 0.6 days) (P = 0.009) ( Figure 2) . Th e mean severity rating (for all symptoms) was lower in the zinc group (1.41 * 0.04) SEM than in the placebo group (1.50 * 0.04); however, this difference was not statistically significant. When symptoms were present, they were generally rated as mild or moderate. Table III shows the mean duration of each symptom by treatment group. An independent groups t test showed that the mean duration of nasal drainage symptoms was significantly lower in the zinc group (4.2 * 0.4 days) than in the placebo group (6.6 f 0.7 days) (t =-3.1, df = 75, P = 0.003). At test also showed that the mean duration of nasal congestion symptoms was significantly lower in the zinc group (4.2 f 0.4 days) than in the placebo group (6.5 f 0.7 days) (t =-2.8, df = 71, P = 0.006). None of the other mean durations (for symptoms considered individually) were significantly different between treatment groups. Table III also shows the mean severity ratings for each symptom by treatment group. The mean symptom severity ratings were lower in the zinc group than in the placebo group for 9 of the 11 symptoms; however, none of the differences were statistically significant. Mean symptom ratings ranged between mild and moderate. ANOVA procedures were used to determine whether the number of days of symptoms or the symptom severity ratings differed with respect to treatment group and allergy test status considered simultaneously. The mean duration of nasal drainage symptoms by treatment group and al- lergy test status is shown in Table IV . ANOVA showed that the mean duration of nasal drainage symptoms was significantly lower in the zinc group (4.2 * 0.4 days, n = 39) than in the placebo group (6.6 * 0.7 days, n = 38) (F = 10.3; df = 1,73; P = 0.002). However, ANOVA also showed a significant interaction effect between treatment group and allergy status group (F = 4.5; df = 1, 73; P = 0.037). This difference was even more pronounced in allergy-positive subjects (3.5 f 0.5 days in the zinc group vs 7.6 f 1.1 days in the placebo group) than in allergy-negative subjects (4.7 * 0.5 days in the zinc group vs 5.5 * 0.8 days in the placebo group). This finding suggests that persons positive for allergies are more responsive to zinc than allergy-negative persons for relief of nasal drainage symptoms. ANOVA showed no significant differences for any of the symptoms, regardless of the number of days the symptoms existed before entering the study, between treatment groups and allergy status groups. DISCUSSION The results of this randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study suggested that using zinc acetate lozenges significantly reduced the duration of common cold symptoms. This study, although descriptive, also demonstrated that all symptoms resolved significantly more quickly in the zinc group than in the placebo group. The mean severity rating was lower in the zinc group than in the placebo group. Furthermore, the mean duration of nasal drainage symptoms in the zinc group was shorter in allergy-positive subjects than in allergy-negative subjects. Ebye4 explained the differing results in previous clinical trials as due to variations in zinc ion availability, noting that only positively charged zinc ions can shorten the duration of common cold symptoms. Only those studies that used zinc lozenges that released positively charged zinc ions at physiologic pH demonstrated impressive, beneficial results. The lozenges used in this study contained 9 mg of zinc in a tablet base of agglomerated dextrose and no other water-soluble ingredients, and they dissolved in the mouth in about 15 minutes. Hatch and Berthon found that zinc acetate releases essentially 100% of its zinc as Zn2' ions at physiologic pH and lower. Zinc is an essential trace element in human biology necessary for many biologic functions such as growth, appetite, testicular maturation, shin integrity, mental activity, wound healing, and immune system maintenance. Approximately 300 enzymes are known to require zinc for their activities. Zinc deficiency in humans is widespread and more prevalent in areas where the population subsists on cereal proteins. Clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency include growth retardation, hypogonadism in males, neurosensory disorders, cell-mediated immunologic dysfunctions, increased maternal morbidity, and premature delivery. Zinc deficiency also adversely affects the proliferation, regulation, and maturity of lymphocytes.26 E.J.PETRUSETAL. The relationship of zinc and the common cold has been well reviewed." Most colds are caused by rhinoviruses. 27 Korant et al9 determined that zinc ions inhibit rhinoviral replication and the cleavage of rhinovirus polypeptides. Khinoviruses have been found to bind with ICAM-1, a receptor found on nasal epithelium. It has been proposed2' that zinc ions complex with ICAM-l-binding sites and prevent the rhinovirus from attaching to the nasal tissue, a point briefly mentioned by Korant et al9 in 1974 . If zinc-blocked viruses do not infect nasal tissue cells to replicate, the infectious process would be interrupted and the duration of the cold would be markedly shortened. Zinc is also believed to act as a protease inhibitor in its effect against rhinovirus infections. Other common cold-causing viruses inhibited by zinc ions include herpes simplex Virus29 and coxsackievirus.3o Zinc ions have other benefits that may shorten the severity and duration of nonviral symptoms associated with the common cold. Zinc has antibacterial activity. It can inhibit the growth of streptococci and actinomyces when used as a dentifrice. 31 Zinc compounds have antiseptic, antifungal, and astringent properties.32 As an astringent, zinc can be used ZINC ACETATE LOZENGES AND COMMON COW SYMPTOMS therapeutically to arrest hemorrhage by coagulating blood, check diarrhea, reduce inflammation of mucous membranes, promote healing, toughen skin, and decrease sweating. 33 Zinc's dominant biological action is membrane stabilization. 34 Zinc is an essential element in immune system function. With regard to the effect of zinc on allergies, mast cells have been implicated as mediators of type I allergic reactions and common cold symptoms by causing tissue redness, inflammation, nasal congestion, release of mucus from goblet cells, nose and throat pain, tickling and itchiness, and, indirectly, coughing and sneezing. Mast cell-derived reactions result when histamine, heparin, prostaglandins, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis, and various vasoactive amines are released from granules on the surface of mast cells, possibly including kinins. One product of mast cell-induced inflammation in response to rhinoviral infection is fever.l' The inhibitory effect of zinc on histamine release from mast cells is attributed to its action on the stabilization of mast cell membrane.35 Zinc ions were found to stabilize cell plasma membranes and prevent induced histamine and vasoactive amine release from tissue mast cells.3" It has been observed that unsequestered zinc ions (4 to 20 mM) are released from mast cell granules during inflammation, suggesting a common linkage between allergies and common colds. 37 Marone et a13s believed that zinc is a competitive antagonist of histamine release from human basophils, and they suggested that zinc compounds might be considered for the treatment of allergic disorders.3s Pasternak3' proposed that cell membrane stabilization by Zn2' was the likely mechanism of action in the treatment of common colds with lozenges releasing positively charged zinc ions. The purpose of our study was to subjectively evaluate the effects of zinc acetate lozenges on the duration and severity of common cold symptoms, not verify the antiviral effect of zinc as previously published. Our study found that zinc acetate lozenges significantly reduced the duration of common cold symptoms and that zinc acetate lozenges were most effective in reducing the duration of nasal drainage symptoms in allergy-positive subjects. We hypothesize that zinc lozenges may be useful as a first line of treatment for allergy symptoms, and we recommend additional research on the use of zinc in allergy therapy.
