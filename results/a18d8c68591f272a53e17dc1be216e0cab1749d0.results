Overall 787 cases were included in this study. There were 378 (48%) cases of HA-MERS infection while 409 (52%) cases occurred elsewhere in the community, for instance within households (Table 1) Table 1 ; however, age among healthcare workers, hospitalized patients and hospital visitors differed significantly ( Table 2 ). The overall crude fatality rate (CFR) was 32%, with significantly higher CFR in HA-MERS cases (33.1%) than among non HA-MERS (24.4%) (Table 1) . Similarly, 69.5% of HA-MERS patients had comorbidities against 48.8% of non-HA-MERS patients (Fig. 1) . Male patients were more likely to have HA-MERS infection compared to females (unadjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.04, 95% confidence interval (CI), [1.53-2.74]). There were slightly more patients with comorbidities among HA-MERS (69.5%) than non-HA-MERS (48.8%) (P-value <0.0001). Patients with comorbidities were twice likely to have HA-MERS than patients without comorbidities (OR = 1.88, 95% CI [1.43-2.48]). Similarly, being a healthcare worker and of older age significantly increased the odds of having a HA-MERS infection (Table 1) . Patients with longer hospital stays were significantly more likely to have an HA-MERS than non-HA-MERS (OR = 1.02, 95% CI [1.00-1.03]). Table 2 presents the descriptive summaries of the HA-MERS cases and unadjusted odds ratio for mortality due to MERS. Although those patients who died of MERS disease were significantly less likely to have HA-MERS infection than those with non-fatal health outcome ( In the unadjusted analysis in Table 2 , the likelihood of fatality from MERS disease increased proportionally with age by a factor of 6% for every unit increase, fatal cases in male HA-MERS patients were more likely than fatal cases in female HA-MERS patients (OR = 2.26, 95% CI [1.46-3.56]). Among the 378 HA-MERS cases, comorbidities were recorded in 225 (69.5%) cases out of which 117 cases were fatal. HA-MERS patients with comorbidities were at a significantly higher risk of death from MERS
