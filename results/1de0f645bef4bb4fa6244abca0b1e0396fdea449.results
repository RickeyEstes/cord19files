A total of 36 676 children underwent active or passive surveillance for CAP. Figure 1 shows the step-wise process used to enrol children. A total of 2345 children were enrolled and comprised the cohort included in the analysis. Similarly, absent or deficient breastfeeding (defined as duration of breastfeeding <6 months for infants older than six months, or less than infant' s age in those <6 months old) was more common in those enrolled through passive surveillance. These children were also more likely to be exposed to solid fuels as well as tobacco smoke in their homes. There were no major differences in gender, history of wheeze, previous history of infections, or family history of tuberculosis in children enrolled through active or passive surveillance. Table 2 presents symptoms reported by parents, clinical findings and radiography. Almost all children presented with cough, fever and fast breathing with median duration of symptoms being similar in those enrolled through active or passive surveillance. Parents reported wheezing during the current episode in approximately one-third of the children. Symptoms/signs suggesting greater severity of pneumonia were more frequently identified in those enrolled through passive surveillance. A larger proportion of these children also had WHO Class I and Class II chest X-rays. There were 108 (4.6%) deaths; of these 107 occurred among those enrolled through passive surveillance (mortality rate 9.2%) and one among those enrolled through active surveillance (0.1%). Based on disease severity, the mortality rate was 1.2% for pneumonia, 4.7% for severe pneumonia and 15.8% for very severe pneumonia. A comparison between fatal and non-fatal cases suggested that age <12 months, oxygen saturation <95% and radiographic finding of consolidation (WHO Class I) were associated with mortality. Figure  2 ). A single bacterium or a single virus was found in only 42 (9.8%) and 28 (6.5%) children respectively. S. pneumoniae dominated (n = 35) followed by S. aureus (n = 5) and H. influ-enzae (n = 2). The single viruses identified were CMV (n = 13) and RSV (n = 9) followed by Rhinovirus (n = 2), and one each of Influenza, Parainfluenza, Enterovirus and hMPV. S. pneumoniae was the dominant organism identified in NPA culture as well. A comparison of the bacterial yield from NPA by PCR and culture is shown in panel B in Figure 2 . Among the 428 children with NPA PCR results, 25 died and PCR showed diverse organisms distributed in a pattern similar to the 428 children (panel C in Figure 2) . Among intubated children undergoing bronchoscopy as part of clinical care (n = 30), only 2 samples were negative on PCR and the remainder showed organisms in a similar pattern to NPA PCR (panel D in Figure 2 ). Since most NPA PCR samples yielded multiple pathogens, the data were analyzed with respect to etiology patterns rather than individual pathogens. These included combinations of two bacteria, two viruses, one bacterium plus one virus, or mixed i.e more than one bacteria and/or virus (panel E in Figure 2) . The most common combination of pathogens in individual samples was S. pneumoniae and CMV (n = 100) followed by 2 bacteria or 2 viruses. In BAL samples, the single pathogens identified were S. pneumoniae (n = 3), S. aureus (n = 2), H. influenzae (n = 2) and CMV (n = 3); the majority of samples (n = 18) showed multiple organisms (panel F in Figure 2 ) that were distributed in a pattern almost similar to NPA samples. The complex microbial patterns on PCR were further analyzed with respect to disease severity (defined according to WHO criteria) but there were no apparent differences (Figure 3) .
