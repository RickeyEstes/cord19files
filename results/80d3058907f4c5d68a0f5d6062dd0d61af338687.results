The purified (His) 6 -tagged recombinant nucleocapsid protein and spike polypeptide were separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels followed by western-blot analysis with serum from three patients with pneumonia positive for antibodies against the SARS-CoV. Prominent immunoreactive protein bands of about 50 kDa were visible on the western blots that used either antigen (figure 1). These sizes were consistent with the expected size of 49·6 kDa for the full-length (His) 6 -tagged nucleocapsid protein and 48·6 kDa for the (His) 6 -tagged spike polypeptide. An ELISA-based SARS-CoV antibody test was developed for the detection of specific antibodies against the (His) 6 -tagged recombinant nucleocapsid protein. Box titration was carried out with different dilutions of (His) 6tagged recombinant nucleocapsid protein coating antigen and pooled serum from three patients with pneumonia positive for antibody against the SARS-CoV. The results identified 20 ng purified (His) 6 -tagged recombinant nucleocapsid protein per ELISA well as the ideal amount for plate coating for IgG detection (data not shown). To establish the baseline for the tests, serum samples from 149 healthy blood donors who donated blood 3 years previously were tested in the ELISA. For these samples, the mean optical density at 450 nm for IgG detection was 0·127 (SD 0·068). An absorbance value of 0·263 was selected as the cut-off value (the mean value for the healthy controls plus 2 SD; figure 2) . Seven of the samples from 149 healthy blood donors had values of more than 0·263 in the IgG ELISA (figure 2), but none of them had the specific antibody when tested by the nucleocapsid protein or the spike polypeptide westernblot assay. The specificity of the IgG antibody test (ELISA confirmed by western-blot assays) was 100%. The mean value for the samples obtained from the 106 patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia, positive for IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV by our indirect immunofluorescence assay, was 1·153 (SD 0·702). 100 samples had optical density of more than 0·263 in the IgG ELISA (figure 2). All 100 were confirmed to have the specific antibody by both the nucleocapsid protein and the spike polypeptide western-blot assays. The sensitivity of the IgG antibody test, with the immunofluorescence assay as the gold standard, was therefore 94·3%. 16 (4·0%) of the 400 healthy blood donors who donated blood in March-May, 2003, eight (6·1%) of the 131 non-pneumonic paediatric patients, eight (3·0%) of the 264 non-pneumonic adult patients, and one (3%) of the 33 symptom-free health-care workers who had cared for the patients with SARS-CoV pneumonia were positive for IgG antibodies by ELISA ( figure 2) . However, only three (0·8%) healthy blood donors who donated blood in March-May, 2003, and one (0·8%) non-pneumonic paediatric patient were confirmed to have specific SARS-CoV antibodies by both the nucleocapsid protein and spike polypeptide western-blot assays. Up to the end of May, 1728 patients from a population of about seven million in Hong Kong (0·025%) had developed SARS-CoV pneumonia, compared with a rate of non-pneumonic SARS-CoV infections in our study population of about 0·48% (p<0·001 by Poisson exact test of equality).
