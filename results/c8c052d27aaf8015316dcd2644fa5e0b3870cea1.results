We fit the model assuming short (mean of 4.8 days; scenario 1) versus long (mean of 7.5 days; scenario 2) serial interval estimates. Model fitting by SMC for serial interval scenario 1 (mean = 4.8 days) resulted in mean duration of infectiousness 2.4 days [95% CI 1.0, 6.7]; mean time of peak relative infectiousness at 43% of the duration of infectiousness [0%, 97%]; and a mean time of infectiousness onset 0.77 days before symptom onset [1.98 days before, 0.29 days after] (Table 2, Figure S1 ). The longer serial interval in scenario 2 (mean = 7.5 days) resulted in slower disease dynamics: mean duration of infectiousness 4.8 days [95% CI 1.12, 10.5]; mean time of peak relative infectiousness at 38% of the duration of infectiousness [0%, 97%]; and a mean time of infectiousness onset 0.51 days after symptom onset [0.77 days before, 1.50 after] (Table 2, Figure S2 ). Therefore, given the same incubation period distribution with mean = 5.2 days, a serial interval with mean = 4.8 days is best fit by substantial presymptomatic infectiousness (mean = 20.5% [0%, 91.4%]) while a longer serial interval with mean = 7.5 days is best fit by limited presymptomatic infectiousness (mean = 0.065% [0%, 0.88%]). Interventions based on contact tracing, unlike mass interventions such as travel restrictions and social distancing, are targeted at individuals and therefore require resources --material and personnel --proportional to the number of cases traced: contact tracing requires detailed interview of case patients to learn of contacts and public health outreach to trace them; active monitoring of contacts may include twice-daily visits by healthcare workers or phone-based self-monitoring; 14 and individual quarantine of contacts requires private space, provision of essentials, and investment in enforcement. The burden of implementing active monitoring or individual quarantine grows quickly as a function of disease incidence and the fraction of traced contacts who are not infected. Assuming uninfected contacts (who never develop symptoms) are monitored or quarantined for 14 days before clearance, the number of uninfected contacts followed grows more quickly than truly infected contacts ( Figure 1 ). As the ratio of uninfected:infected contacts traced increases from 1:1 to 9:1, for example, the burden of uninfected contacts grows proportionally; note the actual ratio may be closer to 2,318:1, as recorded during SARS control in Taiwan where 24 (0.04%) of 55,632 quarantined contacts were found to be truly infected. 15 Depending on the ratio of uninfected to infected contacts traced, individual quarantine, even if initially effective, may soon become infeasible as the epidemic grows, and will need to be supplemented or deprioritized to focus resources on other interventions such as social distancing. In locations at an early stage of COVID-19, where resources allow investment in high-quality implementation of interventions based on contact tracing, the effectiveness of individual quarantine or active monitoring depends heavily on i) aspects of the disease, especially the assumed serial interval and timing of presymptomatic transmission, and ii) aspects of the setting including the fraction of contacts traced. Briefly, a shorter serial interval, larger window of presymptomatic transmission, poor quality interventions, and a small fraction of contacts traced all reduce the ability of either intervention to decrease transmission. Unless otherwise noted, the following results focus on high feasibility settings.
