HCMV induces oncogenic properties. Association of HCMV antigens with various cancer types is well known. However, whether HCMV promotes cancer upon infection is unknown. To investigate the role of HCMV in oncogenesis, non-transformed human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were infected with a GFP-tagged laboratory strain of wild-type HCMV (WT-HCMV), AD169 (MOI 5). On second day post infection (dpi), virus infection was observed by GFP fluorescence (Figure 1a ). On sixth dpi, infected cells showed a characteristic cytopathic effect (CPE) and also change in growth media color (red to yellow) (Figure 1b) . The color change owing at least in part to release of marker GFP from infected cells but also may indicate enhanced metabolic activity during infection. To evaluate the possibility more directly, we performed an MTT assay comparing infected cells with uninfected. A fourfold higher metabolic activity was observed for WT-HCMV-infected cells compared with uninfected cells (Figure 1c ). In addition, an enhanced level of RNA and protein of MKi67, a cell proliferation marker gene, was observed in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs compared with uninfected HFFs (Figures 1d and e) , consistent with the result of MTT assay. This led us to further investigate the cell cycle stages of HCMV-infected cells by flowcytometry, which showed a detectable skewing pattern toward G2-phase in infected cells than in uninfected cells (Figure 1f ). shown in x axis) on 3 dpi, to detect cell cycle stages upon HCMV infection and (g) Anti-apoptotic gene (bcl2, birc3 and prkce) status was compared by qPCR in mock or H-WT infected HFFs on 6 dpi. Shown results are the representative of three (a-d, g) or two (e, f) independent experiments. (f) Statistical analysis was done with data of two independent experiments. Differences were considered statistically significant with a *P-valueo0.05, **P-valueo0.01 and ***P-valueo0.001, ns, non-significant difference (P-value40.05) The majority of viral infection leads to cell death, as a protective innate immune response to reduce viral-load within the host. The cell death is triggered through activation of apoptotic pathways, however, HCMV infection increased cell survival via significantly enhancing the expression of antiapoptotic genes such as bcl2, birc3 and prkce, compared with mock infection (Figure 1g ), indicating that HCMV infection protects cells from apoptosis and promotes cell survival. During cancer progression, expression of anti-and proapoptotic genes is modulated to support cancer progression. Most often increase in expression of anti-apoptotic genes and decrease in expression of pro-apoptotic genes favor cancer progression. Collectively, these results indicate that HCMV infection induces oncogenic properties in non-transformed cells through upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes, resulting into enhanced cell proliferation. DUB activity of HCMV-pUL48 induces oncogenic properties. Previously, it has been reported that the inactive DUB of Marek's disease herpesvirus compromises the ability of that virus to cause lymphoma in chickens. 15 In addition, reports suggest that deregulation of cellular DUBs could also promote various cancer types in humans and mouse. [16] [17] [18] However, HCMV-DUB and its role in oncogenesis are not known. We hypothesized that HCMV-DUB may also have such a role. To test this, we used a previously reported HCMV mutant virus that encodes an inactive DUB. 19 After infecting HFFs with equal amount of WT and DUB-mutant (ΔDUB) GFP-tagged HCMV, an equal amount of virus infection (GFP Fluorescence) was observed on second dpi (Figure 2a) . On sixth dpi, ΔDUB-HCMV-infected cells showed much lessmetabolic activity than WT-HCMV-infected cells, however, comparable to mock infected cells (Figure 2b ). To confirm the differential responses of WT-and ΔDUB-HCMV, MTT assay and MKi67 transcript and protein analysis were performed for cell metabolic activity and cell proliferation, respectively, which indicated that ΔDUB-HCMV reduced cell metabolic activity and proliferation compared with WT-HCMV (Figures 2c-e) . Furthermore, HFF cell counting and cell cycle analysis after three dpi with HCMV, revealed that WT-HCMV infection causes enhanced cell proliferation ( Figure 2f ) and more cell accumulation in the G2-phase compared with mock or ΔDUB-HCMV infection ( Figure 2g ). Next, to confirm that HCMV-DUB can stimulate cell proliferation, we created as previously reported a mammalian expression plasmid, 20 encoding amino acid 1-1162 of pUL48, a functional DUB domain (UL48N) and UL48N lacking DUB function (UL48NΔDUB) of HCMV. The IMR32 cells (a noninvasive neuroblastoma cell line) stably expressing UL48N, UL48NΔDUB or empty vector (Vec) were generated and subjected to cell proliferation analysis from Day 0 to Day 6 after seeding at a density of 0.1 × 10 6 cells and by counting the number of cells on every alternate day. The IMR32 cells, stably expressing WT-UL48N showed rapid proliferation than those stably expressing either ΔDUB-UL48N or Vec (Figure 2h ). This was further confirmed by cell cycle analysis of IMR32 cells, which showed an enhanced accumulation of UL48N expressing IMR32 cells in S-and G2-phases compared with Vec and UL48NΔDUB (Figure 2i ). Collectively, these results indicate that HCMV-DUB can induce cell proliferation and UL48-DUB is crucial for this activity. HCMV-DUB induces cancer hallmarks. The majority of viral infections lead to cell death through apoptotic pathways, which is a protective innate immune response. To understand whether HCMV-DUB modulates pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic gene expressions during infection, WT-HCMV and ΔDUB-HCMV-infected HFFs were first analyzed for the expression of anti-and pro-apoptotic genes through qPCR, on 6th dpi. Transcription of anti-apoptotic genes such as bcl2, birc3, prkce, survivin and xiap was significantly increased by many folds, in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs, however the transcript level remained either unchanged or reduced in ΔDUB-HCMV-infected HFFs compared with mock ( Figure 3a) . Furthermore, protein-expression analysis of anti-apoptotic genes-bcl2, birc3 and survivin-showed an increased expression in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs than in mock or ΔDUB-HCMV-infected HFFs (Figure 3c ). Expression level of few other anti-apoptotic genes such as ciap1, cflip and mcl-1 decreased in case of both, WT and ΔDUB-HCMV infection compared with mock infection (Supplementary Figures S1a-S1c), which suggests HCMV-DUB has no specific role in regulating these anti-apoptotic genes. Surprisingly, transcript level of bcl-xl anti-apoptotic gene was reduced owing to WT-HCMV infection, whereas remained unchanged upon ΔDUB-HCMV infection (Supplementary Figure S1d) . Similarly, transcription of proapoptotic genes such as trail, Rb, p53, fadd and tnfα, remained either unchanged, less induced or reduced in WT-HCMV-infected cells compared with mock, whereas expression of these pro-apoptotic genes was higher in the ΔDUB-HCMV-infected cells (Figure 3b ). The p53 protein was induced upon infection with both WT-and ΔDUB-HCMV, however induction was comparatively less in WT-HCMVinfected HFFs (Figure 3c ). Transcription of few other proapoptotic genes such as bad and bax was decreased upon infection with both, WT-and ΔDUB-HCMV, suggesting no specific role of HCMV-DUB in regulating bad and bax, whereas transcription of caspase-8, and p21 was reduced only in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs, and remained unchanged in ΔDUB-HCMV-infected HFFs (Supplementary Figures S1f-S1i). Furthermore, protein analysis of p21 and caspase-3 showed a decreased expression in WT-HCMV-infected cells compared with mock ( Figure 3c ). The expression of several other anti-and pro-apoptotic genes was tested, with no evidence of differences between WT-and ΔDUB-HCMVinfected cells compared with mock (Supplementary Figures S1e, S1j-S1l) suggesting no involvement of HCMV infection to regulation of these genes. Differential expression of antiand pro-apoptotic genes during WT-HCMV-and ΔDUB-HCMV infection indicates that HCMV-pUL48 DUB activity interferes with the induction of apoptosis and may thus induce oncogenic properties. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that the ability of anti-cancer drug etoposide to promote apoptosis, was reduced by WT-HCMV infection but not by ΔDUB-HCMV infection ( Figure 3d ). Next, we tested uptake of glucose, as cancer cells require increased glucose for metabolism and cell division. 21 To this end, IMR32 cells stably expressing Vec, UL48N and UL48NΔDUB were glucose starved and treated with FITClabeled glucose (2-NBDG). Flow cytometric analysis revealed that cells expressing UL48N took-up more 2-NBDG than those expressing Vec or UL48NΔDUB (Figure 3e ). Moreover, overexpression of UL48N, increased the cell migration ( Figure 3f ) and tissue invasion (Figure 3g ) of IMR32 cells (tested by wound-healing and matrigel invasion assay, respectively), whereas UL48NΔDUB did not induce any of , which suggests that inhibition of pro-apoptotic and induction of antiapoptotic gene expression by WT-HCMV infection, could be due to inhibition of I-IFN synthesis. HCMV induces innate immunity through several PRRs, including endosome localized TLR9 and cytosolic DNA sensors (CDSs). 28-32 TLR9 and CDSs, relay their signals through Myeloid differentiation primary response gene88 (MyD88) and STING, respectively, for the synthesis of I-IFNs. [33] [34] [35] To understand the role of HCMV in I-IFN synthesis and its dependence on MyD88-or STING-pathway, these genes were knocked down in HFFs using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA), wherein myd88 and sting transcripts were significantly reduced compared with control shRNA for GFP (Supplementary Figures S2a-S2b ). HFFs deficient in either myd88 or sting were mocked or infected with WT-HCMV for analysis of I-IFN synthesis. WT-HCMV induced the synthesis of IFNβ in control HFFs whereas reduced the synthesis in mydd88 or sting knocked down HFFs (Figures 4c and d) . This observation suggests that in absence of either MyD88 or STING, induction of I-IFN synthesis is compromised during HCMV infection, which further confirms a dependency on MyD88 and STING for I-IFN synthesis, during HCMV infection. To understand the role of HCMV-DUB (UL48N) in I-IFN synthesis, genes for MyD88 or STING were paired with UL48N and co-expressed in HEK293 cells together with the luciferase reporter gene regulated either by the IFNα4, IFNα6 or IFNβ promoter. All I-IFN promoters increased luciferase production when co-expressed with either the MyD88 or STING gene, however, in all cases the increase was inhibited upon co-expression of UL48N. (Figures 4e-g and Supplementary Figure S2c ). UL48N overexpression also inhibited CpG (TLR9-Ligand)-stimulated transcription of I-IFN and IP10 in HeLa cells (Figures 4h and i ). Furthermore, we tested the efficacy of HCMV-DUB in affecting the I-IFN-dependent antiviral immunity by transfecting IMR32 cells with UL48N or UL48NΔDUB constructs, followed by infecting the cells with New Castle Disease Virus (NDV), 24 h post transfection (hpt). Testing for NDV-replication by quantitative (q)-PCR, showed marked increase in NDV-replication in cells transfected with UL48N but not with UL48NΔDUB ( Figure 4j ). This finding suggests that UL48N suppressed cellular anti-viral responses, which was further proved by analyzing the replication status of both WT and ΔDUB-HCMV in HFFs wherein replication of WT-HCMV was gradually increased with time compared with ΔDUB-HCMV (Supplementary Figure S2d) . Further, to investigate the role of HCMV-DUB in antagonizing I-IFN-induced cell death, HCMV-infected HFFs were treated with recombinant-IFNβ (rIFNβ) on third dpi. An MTT assay, done 3 days after rIFNβ treatment, showed antagonization of rIFNβ-mediated cell death by WT-HCMV-infected HFFs (Figure 4k ). To further analyze I-IFN-antagonizing ability of UL48N for oncogenesis, IMR32 cells were transfected with different amounts of plasmid encoding UL48N or UL48NΔDUB and wound was created 24 hpt. Cell monolayer with wounds were treated with rIFNβ and observed after 72 h for wound healing. The UL48N-transfected IMR32 cells showed dosedependent wound-healing compared with cells transfected with UL48NΔDUB or Vec, and cells treated with rIFNβ only (Figure 4l ). Amount of FLAG-tagged UL48N and UL48NΔDUB was measured by immunoblotting ( Figure 4l ). Finally, to investigate a correlation of I-IFN inhibition with induction of oncogenic properties, receptor for I-IFNs (IFNAR) on HFFs was blocked using anti-IFNAR2 antibody to ultimately inhibit positive feedback signaling. Following blockade of IFNAR, HFFs were infected with WT-or ΔDUB-HCMV and 3 dpi, transcript status of IFNβ was analyzed that showed an The cell proliferation rate of IMR32 cells, stably expressing Vec, UL48N and UL48NΔDUB, was compared by initially seeding them into a density of 0.1 × 10 6 cells, followed by counting and re-seeding them on every alternate day for 6 days. (i, left, right) Cell Cycle stages IMR32 stably expressing vector UL48N or NΔDUB were analyzed by flowcytometry by staining the cells with PI. dpi: days post infection, Vec: Empty Vector, NΔDUB: UL48NΔDUB. Shown results are the representative of three (a-d, f, h, i) or two (e, g) independent experiments. (g, h) Statistical analysis was done with data of two (g) and three (h) independent experiments and the difference was calculated between mock versus WT-HCMV infection or mock versus HΔDUB-HCMV infection (g) or between Vec versus UL48N or Vec versus NΔDUB (h). Differences were considered statistically significant with a *P-valueo0.05, **P-valueo0.01 and ***P-valueo0.001, ns, non-significant difference (P-value40.05) HCMV-DUB deubiquitinates cytoplasmic molecules to inhibit I-IFN synthesis and promote carcinogenic properties. The pUL48 contains nuclear localization sequences (NLS), suggesting that differential localization of pUL48N within the cell may be critical for its DUB function and I-IFN inhibition. To test this, NLS-mutant of UL48N was created as described previously 46 and named as UL48NΔNLS (Figure 5a) , which was unable to enter the nucleus ( Figure 5b) and was equally efficient DUB as UL48N (Figure 5c ). To analyze the function of UL48N (cytoplasmic or nuclear function) in I-IFN synthesis pathways, I-IFN promoter activity was measured with overexpression of UL48N and UL48NΔNLS. To this end, IFNα4 and IFNβ promoter was activated by co-expression of MyD88 or STING, which are the key molecules of TLR9 or CDS signaling pathways, respectively. UL48N and UL48NΔNLS, both inhibited MyD88 or STING-mediated IFNα4 or IFNβ promoter activity, respectively (Figures 5d and e) . We hypothesized that UL48N deubiquitinates the cytoplasmic (not the nuclear) signaling molecules activated by PRRs, whose ubiquitination is necessary for induction of I-IFNs. We also compared UL48NΔNLS with UL48N in a wound-healing assay and found that wounds of IMR32-monolayers expressing either of the constructs, closed with equal efficiency after 48 h, (Figure 5f ), despite a modest difference in I-IFN inhibiting property. This indicates that NLS of pUL48 is dispensable for the HCMV-DUB induced cell migration observed above (e.g., Figure 3f ). These results show that nuclear localization of UL48N is not required to show inhibitory effect on I-IFN synthesis and cellular migratory activities. HCMV-DUB deubiquitinates PRR-mediated signal transducers to inhibit I-IFN synthesis. To facilitate the synthesis of I-IFNs through PRRs, many signaling mediators get K63 (lysine-63) ubiquitinated ( Figure 6a ). As K63 ubiquitination of cytoplasmic molecules is an important event during innate immune signaling, our next approach was to find out the cytoplasmic target molecule whose deubiquitination is facilitated by UL48N and is necessary for inhibition of I-IFN synthesis. To this end, various signaling molecules of the TLR and CDS pathways, undergoing K63 ubiquitination for induction of I-IFNs synthesis, were co-expressed with UL48N or UL48NΔDUB in HEK293 cells and were tested for IFNβ promoter activity by the Luciferase assay. Coexpression of UL48N with TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1, IRF7 or STING, inhibited IFNβ promoter activity whereas UL48NΔ-DUB completely rescued the inhibition in case of TRAF3 and IRAK1, and partially rescued in case of TRAF6, IRF7 and STING (Figure 6b ). We concluded that UL48N is able to deubiquitinate multiple signaling molecules to inhibit I-IFN production. Finally, the K63-deubiquitination activity of UL48N was tested by immunoblot analysis using various constructs such as myc-tagged TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1, IRF7 or STING and FLAG-tagged UL48N and UL48NΔDUB as indicated in Figure 6c . The result showed that UL48N hugely deubiquitinates TRAF6, TRAF3 and STING ( Figure 6d ) and slightly deubiquitinates IRAK1 (Supplementary Figure S3a) and IRF7 (Supplementary Figure S3b) . Collectively, these results suggest that HCMV-DUB targets various key molecules of the signaling cascade to suppress I-IFN and to induce oncogenesis.
