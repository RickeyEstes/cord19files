Sensitivity and specificity for mOTNRT-PCR assay As shown in (Fig. 1a, b and c) , the sensitivities of mOTNRT-PCR assay for RSV, HRV and HMPV were 5 copies /reaction. The standard curves acquired from the mOTNRT-PCR was shown in (Fig. 1d ). The correlation coefficient (R 2 ) of the standard curves of RSV, HRV and HMPV in multiplex reaction were 0.997, 0.994 and 0.995, respectively. The amplification efficiencies (E) for the different targets were 98.5, 95.7 and 92.5%, respectively, which was considered as acceptable for a multiplex screening assay. A total of 159 RSV, HRV and HMPV-negative by mOTNRT-PCR out of 398 clinical specimens were used to determine the specificity of mOTNRT-PCR in this study. These samples were previously tested [15] and confirmed to be positive for either of a variety of other respiratory pathogens including, parainfluenza virus (PIV), mycoplasma pneumonia (MP), Chlamydia (including CP and CT), human Bocavirus (HBOV), adenovirus (ADV), coronavirus (COV), Chlamydia, influenza virus types A (Flu A), influenza virus FluA-H3, FluA-H1N1, and influenza virus types B (Flu B). No unspecific amplification or detection of mOTNRT-PCR was observed with these specimens (data not shown), suggesting the high specificity of mOTNRT-PCR assay.
