Influenza and RSV exhibited the greatest seasonal variation and were responsible for the strongest associated burden on general respiratory infections. However, associations were found with the other pathogens and the burden of streptococcus pneumoniae was important in adult age groups (25 years and over). The model estimates suggested that only a small proportion of patients with influenza receive a specific diagnosis that is coded to an "influenza-like illness" syndromic indicator, (6% for both GP in-hours consultations and for emergency department attendances), compared to a more general respiratory diagnosis. Also, patients with influenza calling NHS 111 were more likely to receive a diagnosis of fever or cough than cold/flu. Despite these findings, the specific syndromic indicators remained more sensitive to changes in influenza incidence than the general indicators.
