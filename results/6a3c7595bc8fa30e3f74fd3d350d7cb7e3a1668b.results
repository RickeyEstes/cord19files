Modulating role in -1 PRF of the three nucleotides immediately upstream of the HIV-1 slippery sequence As mentioned earlier, mutations within the eight nucleotides immediately preceding the slippery sequence can affect the efficiency of -1 PRF (39) . We may expect that the closer a nucleotide of this region is to the slippery heptamer X XXY YYZ, the higher its influence on -1 PRF. In this study, we focused on the three nucleotides positioned immediately upstream of the slippery heptamer, which we name A, B and C. Together with the slippery heptamer, these nucleotides form the decamer A BCX XXY YYZ, which we call the extended slippery sequence. In the last model describing -1 PRF [ Figure 1C , (35, 38) ], the XXY and YYZ codons of the classic slippery sequence (X XXY YYZ) are located in the P and A sites, respectively, when the -1 PRF occurs. The A BC nucleotides that are directly upstream of the slippery sequence are positioned such that the BCX and the ABC codons are located, respectively, in the E site before and after the shift. To investigate whether the identities of nucleotides A BC can affect the -1 PRF, we studied seven mutants of the frameshift region of HIV-1, in which the A BC nucleotide sequence (U AAU UUU UUA), was replaced by the corresponding sequence found in other viruses. We used a dual-luciferase reporter system (18) in mammalian cultured cells. In this system, the HIV-1 frameshift region is positioned between Rluc and Fluc coding sequences, such that Fluc expression requires the -1 PRF of HIV-1. In Figure 3A , one sees the extended slippery sequences of the wild-type HIV-1 (WT; U AAU UUU UUA) and of seven mutants numbered from M1 to M7. The M1 mutant corresponds to a variant isolated from a protease inhibitor-exposed patient, and M2 is a natural variant of HIV-1 (49) . In M3 to M7 mutants, nucleotides A BC are taken from HIV type 2 (HIV-2; M3), the giardia virus (M4), the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; M5), the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1; M6) and the equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV; M7). The absolute value of the WT -1 PRF efficiency was 8.0 AE 1.0%. In Figure 3B , a value of 100% is arbitrarily assigned to this efficiency, and the efficiencies of all mutants are shown relative to WT. Among all investigated mutants, M1 is characterized by the lowest level of -1 PRF efficiency, which is only 5% of the WT level. Such a drop of the efficiency can be explained by the fact that M1 is the only variant in which the re-pairing of the pept-tRNA in the new reading frame is not allowed and this variant is most likely very poorly infectious. With M2, M5, M6 and M7 mutants, the -1 PRF efficiency was increased by about 50%. In contrast, with M3, the -1 PRF efficiency decreased slightly to 70% of the wild-type value, while the frameshift level remained unchanged with M4. Although the effects are not dramatic, they are all significant and well-reproducible [with M1, M2, M6 and M7 mutants; P values are 0.0001 (n 5 4) and with M5 mutant, P-value is 0.001 (n = 4), as determined by Student's t-test]. To verify whether the -1 PRF could be also influenced by mutations upstream the A BC nucleotides, we mutated the GCU codon, which is immediately upstream the BCX codon (GCU was exchanged with AAU, UCU, GGU or CAU, so that the A position remained unchanged). These mutations did not alter the -1 PRF efficiency (data not shown). We can conclude that mutations in positions A BC, immediately upstream of the classic slippery sequence, can noticeably affect the -1 PRF efficiency of HIV-1 and, therefore, that the nucleotides located at positions A BC could be involved in the -1 PRF of HIV-1. This was not the case for the nucleotides upstream of A BC.
