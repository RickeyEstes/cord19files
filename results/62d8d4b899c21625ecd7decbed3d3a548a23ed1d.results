3.1. Depletion of cholesterol from the MDBK cell membrane by 10 mM MbCD had little effect on the cell viability MbCD, a derivative of a cyclic oligomer of glucose with a lipophilic property (Pitha et al., 1988) , is a cholesterolsequestering agent. This drug is not incorporated into the membrane but selectively extracts membrane cholesterol by binding it in a central non-polar cavity (Ilangumaran and Hoessli, 1998) . In this study, we used MbCD to investigate the role of cholesterol in BoHV-1 life cycle. The cell toxicity of MbCD on MDBK cells was measured with MTT method. MDBK cells were mock or treated with various concentrations of MbCD in serum-free DMEM. As showed in Fig. 1a MbCD reduced the cell viability in a dose-dependent manner compared to the mock treated control cells. MbCD at the concentration of less than 15 mM, have little toxicity on MDBK cells with the cell viability of more than 90%. The ganglioside GM1 is a commonly used raft marker and its association with membrane lipid microdomains has been proved by microscopy and biochemical experiments (Montixi et al., 1998; Janes et al., 1999) . Here, depletion of MDBK cell membrane cholesterol by MbCD was measured by detecting fluorescent CTB-FITC binding to GM1 with FACS. As shown in Fig. 1b , CTB-FITC binding to drugtreated cells on ice was reduced in a dose-dependent manner compared to mock treated cells, confirming that MbCD effectively sequestered the membrane cholesterol. The treatment with 10 mM MbCD decreased the cholesterol level with an average range of 63% compared to mock treated control cells. So the drug concentration of 10 mM was appropriate for this study with negligible cell toxicity and efficiently cholesterol depletion.
