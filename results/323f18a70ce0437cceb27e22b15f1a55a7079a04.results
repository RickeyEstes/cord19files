Clinical history, microbiological and in-situ hybridization results for the seven infected piglets are presented in Table 1 . PRRSV was isolated from the lungs of all piglets, and two (nos 3 and 4) were also infected with Haemophilusparasuis. It is not known whether piglet no. 6 had a bacterial infection, as it had been treated with antibiotic. Absence of pulmonary mycoplasmosis was inferred from the absence of typical lesions but was not confirmed by culture. By in-situ hybridization, a distinct, positive signal, scattered throughout the alveolar septa and spaces, was detected in all seven piglets. The signal intensity varied within and between histological structures in any one section and between piglets. Positive cells typically exhibited dark brown reaction product in the cytoplasm, without background staining. A strong hybridization signal was detected in the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells randomly scattered in the thickened alveolar septa (Fig. 1) . A less intense signal was detected on rare occasions in cells that resembled type 2 pneumocytes (Fig. 2) . The positive cells generally had large oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm. Comparison with haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from the same block indicated that most of the positive cells were interstitial macrophages. The alveolar macrophages frequently showed a strong hybridization signal, representing PRRSV replication (Fig. 3) . The distribution of positive cells in the lung was very patchy. PRRSV nucleic acids were detected within the cytoplasm of alveolar macrophages. When hybridization signal was detected in alveolar macrophages, it was usually associated with inflammation. Hybridization signal was occasionally detected in necrotic cellular debris in the lumina of terminal bronchioles (Fig. 4) . No hybridization signal was detected in bronchial or bronchiolar epithelium. PRRSV nucleic acids were detected in the anterior and middle lobes of the lungs in six of the seven piglets, but in the accessory and caudal lobes of only four and two, respectively. Sections from the two control pigs showed no hybridization signal.
