Following the procedure described above and illustrated in Fig. 1 , we select 314 Li's (out of a total number of 891 Li's in Kaohsiung). Moreover, for each of these Li's we identify all stations within 1 km of its centroid, again using the previously described distance. The cases reported in these 314 Li's within close proximity of the KRT system, account for almost half of the total case number reported in Kaohsiung in 2014 and 2015, or more precisely, 43.41% (6499 cases) and 46.78% (9219 cases), respectively. For illustration, Fig. 2 provides a geographic map of the 314 Li's with respective incidence rates in 2014 and 2015. The frequency distribution of the Li's by yearly dengue incidence rate in 2014-2015 is also shown in Fig. 3 . We make use of the RAMPP index, in order to differentiate the weight of the KRT stations, based on their traffic volume. Since it is reasonable to suppose that the busiest stations are usually located in densely populated areas, we first compare the correlation between RAMPP and yearly incidence rate with the correlation between population density and yearly incidence rate, for both years. Thus, we Since for K N 4, the effect on the sum of squared errors is negligible, we opt to perform the successive analyses, taking into account three and four clusters, respectively. Table 1 shows the RAMPP mean value for each clustering solution, while the frequency distribution of the Li's with average and standard error of yearly incidence rate for each RAMPP-based cluster is given in Table 2 . As an illustrative example, for the 2014 epidemic the 314 Li's belonging to four different RAMPP-based clusters are colored in four shades of gray from the darkest shade denoting the cluster with the highest RAMPP mean value, as shown in Fig. 5 . For the case K = 4, two interactive maps are provided as Supplementary Files, displaying simultaneously the yearly incidence rate and the belonging RAMPP-based cluster of each Li. For both years and for each clustering solution, the normality of data is determined, by applying the Shapiro-Wilk's test on the residuals of the linear model, while the variance homogeneity is assessed via the Levene's test. The data normality requirement is not met (pvalues ≪ 0.05), while the variance homogeneity assumption is largely satisfied (p-values ≫ 0.05). Subsequently, four Kruskal-Wallis' tests are performed, adopting the RAMPP-based classification as the independent factor, with significant differences detected in both 2014 (p-value = 4.99E − 05 for K = 3, p-value = 3.47E − 05 for K = 4) and 2015 datasets (p-value = 5.51E − 05 for K = 3, pvalue = 2.90E − 04 for K = 4). Consequently, it is possible to apply the Dunn's post hoc test (with Šidák adjustment), in order to compare the group means, as given in Fig. 6 for 2014-2015. Considering K = 3, the outcome of the analysis conducted on the 2014 data shows that the (average) yearly incidence rate observed in Cluster 3, i.e. the cluster collecting the Li's with the highest RAMPP values, is always significantly greater than that recorded in the clusters with small RAMPP values (Table 3 ). In 2015, no significant difference is detected between Cluster 3 and Cluster 2, but both are significantly higher than Cluster 1 (Table 4) . For K = 4, the Dunn's test shows again that Cluster 4, i.e. the cluster collecting the Li's with the highest RAMPP values, in 2014 exhibits an yearly incidence rate significantly greater than that recorded in both Cluster 1 and Cluster 2. A significant difference is also detected between Cluster 3 and Cluster 1. Moreover, no significant difference can be detected between Cluster 4 and Cluster 3, between Cluster 3 and Cluster 2, and between Cluster 2 and Cluster 1 (Table 5) . Similarly, for the results obtained for the 2015 data (Table 6) .
