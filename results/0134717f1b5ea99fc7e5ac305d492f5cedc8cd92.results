No mortality was observed during the acclimation period, before CQ treatment and in control groups. When the fingerlings exposed to various concentrations of CQ showed a sign of behavioural anomalies like fast swimming, rapid opercula movements, wide open of mouth and operculum, excess mucus secretion, convulsions and jerky movement. Finally the fish became lethargic, there was reduction in opercula movements, and they were at static condition usually at bottom and dead. These changes were more severe when the concentration of CQ increased. The fingerlings in the control groups were active and no anomaly was found. The 96 h LC50 value of CQ to C. carpio was calculated as 31.62 mg/ml. The Chi-square test indicated that the fish population used in this study were found homogenous. To assess the acute and sub-lethal toxicity, C. carpio fingerlings were exposed to 31.32 mg/ml and 3.16 mg/ml (1/10th of the 96 h LC50 value) of CQ respectively.
