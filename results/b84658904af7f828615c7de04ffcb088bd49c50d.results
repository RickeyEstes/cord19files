The Effect of Ionophores on the Visible Absorbance Spectrum of COX in COV (+TX) The substitution of an alternative ionophore for measuring cytochrome c oxidase proton translocating activity was investigated due to the possible modification of COX by the interaction of valinomycin with the enzyme (12, 13) . The effects of gramicidin on COX electron transfer and proton translocating activities were tested for two reasons: (i) gramicidin is a channel-forming ionophore, whereas valinomycin is a cyclic ionophore that performs its function as a mobile potassium carrier. The utilization of a membrane-spanning protein channel such as gramicidin could minimize the interaction of the ionophore with COX; (ii) gramicidin mimics valinomycin in its ability to stimulate energy-linked cation uptake and swelling in isolated mitochondria (11). Gramicidin also dissipates the membrane potential in both chloroplasts (as indicated by the abolition of the light-induced 515-nm absorbance change that is thought to reflect the buildup of a membrane potential in chloroplasts) and also mitochondria, suggesting similar cation permeabilities induced by the two ionophores in isolated membranes [see Ref. (11) and Discussion]. The visible absorbance spectrum of COX in COV (+TX) was determined in the presence and absence of the two ionophores (Fig. 1) . Figure 1A shows that the y band of oxidized heme a exhibits a red shift from 422 to 430 nm in valinomycin-treated COV (+TX) similar to that reported by Steverding and Kadenbach (12) . The absorbance change occurs at concentrations of valinomycin [E-50 mol/mol heme aaa] that support proton translocation by the enzyme. In gramicidin-treated COV (+TX) (Fig. lB) , no spectral shift is observed at concentrations of gramicidin (0.5-50 mol/mol heme aa3) that allow proton translocating activity, suggesting that gramicidin does not interact with COX in the same manner as valinomycin. A similar valinomycin-induced red shift in the oxidized difference spectrum is also observed in phospholipid vesicles containing subunit III-deficient COX (data not shown), suggesting that subunit III is not the subunit location of the putative valinomycin binding site on COX.
