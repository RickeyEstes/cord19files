As can be seen in Table 2 , at the airflow rates we analyzed, the 1862 respirator provided 94 to particulate is deposited from the masks themselves during use, we compared the weight gains recorded for each mask in the absence of vaporization with the corresponding control data (no mask); the Wilcoxon test showed no significant difference between any of the masks in comparison with controls at either airflow rate. Furthermore, in the absence of vaporization, we found no difference (Kruskal-Wallis test) among the three types of masks in terms of weight gain. By contrast, we found significant differences among the three masks in the presence of vaporization of bicarbonate dust (P < .03 with the 880 JADA, Vol. 136 www.ada.org/goto/jada July 2005
