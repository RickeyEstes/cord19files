A total of 1666 travelers participated in the survey (98% response rate) and included 1272 (76.4%) and 394 (23.6%) participants who were traveling to Asia and the Middle East, respectively (Table 1) ; 265 (67.3%) of the 394 travelers to the Middle East had an Asian country as a second destination. The four most common Asian destinations were India (18.7%), Pakistan (12.5%), Thailand (9.8%) and Bangladesh (9.2%). Fifty-two percent of all travelers visited malaria endemic areas. Table 2 describes the travelers and their travel characteristics. The majority of the international travelers were male and of Greek nationality. Fiftysix percent of the travelers were traveling alone. More than one-third of the travelers were foreign born; 28.3% were born on the Indian subcontinent. Outdoor activities, contact with animals, and altitude exposure were reported by 221 (13.3%), 42 (2.5%) and 3 (0.18%) travelers, respectively. Onequarter of the travelers reported having sought a pre-travel consultation ( Table 2) . Of those traveling for leisure, for business and VFRs, 45.7%, 30.3% and 3.2% sought pre-travel advice, respectively (pvalue < 0.001). Vaccinations according to destinations are described in Table 3 . A total of 575 vaccines were administered to 240 (14.4%) of the travelers (mean number of vaccines: 2.4; range: 1-14); 128 (53.3%), 109 (45.4%) and 3 (1.3%) travelers received routine, travel, and routine and travel vaccines, respectively. The vaccines that were most commonly administered were those for hepatitis A (77%), and tetanus/diphtheria (73%). More than 70% of the travelers visited areas that are endemic for hepatitis A, and nearly 50% of the travels visited typhoid fever endemic areas. The hepatitis A and typhoid vaccination rates were lower than expected (60% and 35%, respectively). Of the travelers to whom the typhoid vaccine was administered, 39.7% visited Southeast Asia, and 33.3% visited the Indian subcontinent; however, the typhoid vaccine was administered to only 3.5% and 7% of those traveling to the above destinations, respectively. Nearly all of the travelers who received yellow fever vaccines were sailors who were traveling to a second or third destination such as the sub-Saharan Africa. Rabies vaccinations were administered to 0.4% of our travelers and were primarily given to those visiting the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Only 0.4% of the travelers to the Indian subcontinent, 0.16% of the travelers VFRs, and 0.4% of the long-term travelers were vaccinated against rabies despite traveling to rabies-endemic countries. The malaria prophylaxes according to destinations are shown in Table 4 . A total of 204 (12.2%) travelers were prescribed chemoprophylaxis; 6 of whom visited areas for which malaria chemoprophylaxis was not indicated. Among all of the travelers, 860 travelers visited malaria endemic areas, and 23% received chemoprophylaxis. Only 0.5% of the travels to VFRs and 50% of business travelers who traveled to malaria endemic areas were prescribed chemoprophylaxis. Atovaquone/proguanil was the most commonly prescribed antimalarial (68%). There were statistically significant associations between malaria chemoprophylaxis, general advice, and destination. More of the travelers who traveled to Southeast Asia (20.9%) and the Indian subcontinent (10.7%) were prescribed chemoprophylaxis compared to the travelers to other destinations (p-value < 0.001), and 76% and 81% of these travelers received atovaquone and proguanil, respectively. In terms of the purposes of travel, more tourists (56.5%) and business travelers (42%) received antimalarials than did the travelers to VFRs (1.5%; p-value < 0.001). Multivariate analysis was used to investigate the associations of several factors with the failure to pursue a pre-travel health consultation among the travelers to Asian destinations. Being male, unemployed, having an elementary level of education, traveling to VFRs, traveling for <1 month and traveling to the Middle East each predicted greater odds of not pursuing health information (Table 5 ).
