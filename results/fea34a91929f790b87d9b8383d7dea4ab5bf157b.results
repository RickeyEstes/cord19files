A summary of imported infections seen between 1998 and 2002 on the infectious diseases ward at Addenbrooke's hospital is shown (Table 1) . Cases are shown both as specific diagnoses, when a causative organism is determined, and grouped as symptom complexes (gastroenteritis, fever, rash etc.) or by haematological indices such as eosinophilia, where no specific pathogen was identified but the clinical picture was of an imported infectious disease.
