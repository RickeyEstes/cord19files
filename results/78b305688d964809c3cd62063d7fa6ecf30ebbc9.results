Optimized numbers of poly I linkers in DPO primer design and annealing temperature for multiplex DPO PCR The number of poly (I) in DPO primers impacts both the sensitivity and specificity of the DPO PCR amplification. This study therefore tested various numbers of poly (I) linkers, with five linkers proving optimal (Figure 1 ). Because the influenza viral gene are highly mutable, four annealing temperatures (Tm) were selected and applied to different concentrations of the mixed templates. When the Tm was 46째C and 50째C, the lowest template concentration was 10 4 viral particles/ml ( Figure 2 ). When the Tm was increased to 55째C, faint bands (10 3 viral particles/ml) were observed. When the Tm reached to 60째C, distinct bands indicated the lowest concentration of mixed template was 10 3 viral particles/ml for multiplex DPO PCR.
