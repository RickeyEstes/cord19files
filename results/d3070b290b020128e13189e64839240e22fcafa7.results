Of the 58 environmental samples, 8 were positive for at least one of the pathogens in the respiratory multiplex array (Table 1) . Air samples were negative with the exception of one (1 of 18, 5.5%), which tested positive for influenza B virus. This sample came from air sampling done during the late afternoon (started at 5:10 PM) on October 26, 2013, at hall 8 of the airport. At the time of the sampling, the hall had a temperature and relative humidity of 23 C and 58%, respectively, and was being used to process pilgrims from Turkey and Thailand who were returning home. Of the 40 surface samples, 7 (17.5%) were positive for pathogens ( Table 1 ). The most common pathogen contaminants of surfaces were adenovirus (3 of 7, 42.8%) and coronavirus OC43/HKU1 (3 of 7, 42.8%). Potentially pathogenic bacteria (eg, H. influenza, M. catarrhalis) were also present on environmental surfaces. Chair handles were the most commonly contaminated surfaces. Out of the 11 chair handles sampled, 4 (36.3%) were contaminated with at least one of the pathogens. The handles of 1 chair were cocontaminated with both coronavirus OC43/HKU1 and H. influenzae.
