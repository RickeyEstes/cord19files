Twenty-three patients were sampled (age range, 13-66 years) with the new collection method. Table I summarizes their ages, number of brackets removed, sample collection time, and bleeding indexes. The average age was 25.62 years, and the average number of bonds removed was 13.22 per patient. Total bonds removed were 304. Table II lists the aerosolized bacterial colonies collected from each patient. Two ethylene-oxide sterilized cassettes (numbers 25 and 26) that served as controls operated under pump intake. Cassette 25 was exposed to the debanding room (operatory) ambient air only, and cassette 26 was attached to the resuscitation mask and worn in the op- eratory by the investigator to detect exhaled microbes. These cassettes were subjected to the same processes as all other cassettes and had no bacterial growth. The 2 commercially marketed dental masks tested offered no protection from aerosolized bacteria liberated during orthodontic debonding. The control cassettes and the experimental cassettes were indistinguishable in terms of bacterial colony growth, with abundant colonization on each agar plate (Fig 4) . The industrial mask, however, prevented contamination and colonization of the plates, demonstrating effective protection from at least aerosolized oral bacteria (Fig 5) .
