To better understand evolutionary relationships between SCoVs isolated in Taiwan and those isolated in other parts of the world, we constructed phylogenetic trees with two different methods using full-length genomic sequences from 45 human (12 Taiwanese) and two civet SCoVs. Tree topologies were consistent for the NJ (Fig. 1a) and Pars (Fig.  1b) methods. Two human SCoV epidemics were identified. The late epidemic SCoVs formed a well-supported monophyletic clade with bootstrap values of 98 and 88 for the NJ and Pars trees, respectively. The early epidemic sequences did not cluster into a monophyletic clade, even though they did clearly differed from those of late epidemic. Fig. 1 . Human and civet SCoV phylogenetic trees, produced with the neighbor-joining (NJ) method using full-length (29.7 kb) sequences. Branch bootstrap values from 100 reps: (a) using the SZ3 civet SCoV as a root; (b) a tree produced using the parsimony (Pars) method. All early epidemic SCoVs had Chinese origins: Beijing (BJ01, BJ02, BJ03 and BJ04), Guangzhou (GD01 and GZ50), and Hong Kong (CUHK-W1). All the Taiwanese SCoVs sequences which associated with nosocomial infection clustered into a monophyletic clade (bootstrap values 75 and 78 for NJ and Pars trees, respectively) within the late epidemic and could be further classified into two epidemic waves. Second wave was a monophyletic clade supported by bootstrap values of 74 and 75 for NJ and Pars tree, respectively, while first wave was not a fully resolved cluster. TWC (from Mr. X's younger brother) did not cluster with three isolates from Amoy Gardens (CUHK-AG03, CUHK-AG02, CUHK-AG01), but did cluster with an isolate (WHU) from Wuhan, China (bootstrap value 90 for NJ tree) (Fig. 1a) . Pairwise comparison methods were used to analyze nucleotide sequence variation within the full-length genomes of 20 human SCoVs (7 from early epidemic and 13 from late epidemic) (Fig. 2) . Two civet SCoV sequences (SZ3 and SZ16) were used as references for comparison. Our results revealed that the highest variation rate was in the 3 0 one-third of the viral genome, especially the nucleotide sequences near the junction between the replicase 1B and spike genes; Orf 3 also had a relatively high sequence variation rate. Amino acid sequences for the S, M, E, and N structural proteins of 45 human SCoVs were compared with those of the SZ-16 civet SCoV (Fig. 3) . The S protein was divided into S1 and S2 domains according to the molecular model proposed by Spiga et al. (2003) . The S1 domain (N-terminal 17-680 amino acid residues, responsible for receptorbinding) had 18 (2.7%) amino acid differences; the S2 domain (681-1255 amino acid residues) had 11 (1.9%)-a total of 29 (2.3%) differences in the S proteins of 43 SCoVs. The S genes of WHU and ZMY1 contained several nucleotide insertions that interrupted the open reading frames. The amino acid distances of S proteins were 1.3% (16.4/1239) for early epidemic SCoVs and 1.4% (17.2/1239) for late epidemic SCoVs in comparison with civet SCoVs. Intra-group sequence variation for early epidemic was 0.3% (n = 7) and for late epidemic 0.09% (n = 38) ( Table 1 ). The numbers of amino acid differences were 4 for the E protein (5.3%), 7 for M (3.2%), 4 for N (0.9%), and 11 for Orf 3 (4.0%) (Fig. 3) . Amino acid distances among the 45 human SCoVs were 0.18% (0.13/76) for the E protein, 0.75% (1.67/ 221) for M, 0.04% (0.16/422) for N, and 1.53% (4.20/274) for Orf 3 (Table 1 and Fig. 4) . Among the 45 human SCoVs that we analyzed, an isolate (GD01) from Guangdong province China, contained an extra 29-nucleotide fragment. Both WHU and TWC had dinucleotide deletions at the 30th and 31st nucleotides of Orf 10, resulting in a frame shift and premature stop of the putative protein (Fig. 5 ). In addition, we observed a 5nucleotide deletion at the 32nd nucleotide of Orf 10 in Sin2748; this also resulted in a frame shift and premature translation stop.
