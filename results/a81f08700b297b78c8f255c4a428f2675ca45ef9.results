Our previous studies mapped NSP4 viroporin activity to a 44-amino acid peptide corresponding to residues 47-90, and this region contains a cluster of basic residues and a predicted amphipathic α-helix, which are signature viroporin motifs 13 . Thus, we used synthetic peptides of this minimal NSP4 viroporin domain (VPD) (Fig. 1) to determine whether it has bona fide ion channel activity using both planar lipid bilayer and liposome patch clamp techniques. Electrophysiological Analysis of NSP4 VPD. We tested the wild-type NSP4 VPD (VPD-WT) for ion channel activity using two well-established electrophysiology techniques, planar lipid bilayer and patch-clamp. In both techniques, we captured two unique electrophysiological signatures that characterize VPD-WT (Fig. 2) . Figure 2A and B show that VPD-WT could display canonical well-defined opening events that measured ~65 pS in symmetric buffer conditions of 150 mM KCl when using either technique. These canonical "square-top" events are similar to those displayed by classical voltage or ligand-gated ion channels, with stochastic transitions between open and closed states of varying durations that averaged 10 and 25 ms, respectively. In addition, a second electrophysiological signature was observed for VPD-WT in a large majority of the experiments, and characterized by fast kinetics, as illustrated in Fig. 2C and D. Here, very transient and frequent fluctuations (open time <1 ms) to various open states give rise to a particularly "spiky" recording. Although this type of "spiky" ion channel activity is commonly observed among many viroporins 4 , conductance measurements require that the channel remain in the open state for a duration long enough to determine the current plateau with minimal error due to noise. When the opening transitions last for just a few sample points, it is challenging to make a reliable measurement of the open channel current. While it does provide evidence of ion channel activity, when the channel is in the fast kinetic state it is not possible to accurately determine the number of channels in the bilayer or patch or measure the single-channel conductance due to the transient nature of the openings. In addition, the high frequency of openings may be due to the concerted kinetics of multiple inserted VPD-WT oligomers in the lipid bilayer resulting in bursts of channel openings with very fast kinetics. On occasion, the two types of kinetic behaviors could be seen within the same recording, as shown in Fig. 3 . A patch-clamp recording of VPD-WT dissolved in DMSO and reconstituted into liposomes utilizing the cloud method (see Materials and Methods) illustrates the ability of VPD-WT to shift kinetic states within the same experiment. As seen in the expanded segment (Fig. 3, red box) , the reconstituted channel first displayed openings with a well-defined level of conductance measuring approximately 50 pS. However, within 500 milliseconds, the channel transitioned to a "spiky" behavior observed in a majority of the experiments (Fig. 3, blue box) . While other viroporins have been characterized as having both fast current fluctuations ('spiky' activity) and well-defined openings, these two kinetic signatures have rarely (if ever) been demonstrated to occur during the same recording 4 . Further, recordings, such as in Fig. 3 , show a clear transition between the kinetic state characterized by well-defined openings and that by fast kinetics. Since fast current fluctuations did not occur while the channel was already open to a well-defined conductance level, but rather stretches with fast and prolonged current transitions were consecutive, this recording originates from a single channel which oscillates between the two kinetics states, and not from multiple channels with different kinetic properties. Altogether, we obtained 109 planar lipid bilayer recordings and 54 patch clamp recordings that showed that the VPD-WT peptide alone is capable of conducting monovalent ions. In ~70% of the recordings, VPD-WT displayed a discrete unitary level of conductance, as seen in canonical bona fide ion channels. In conditions of 150 mM KCl, the unitary conductance of VPD-WT ranged from 40 to 65 pS. To determine the relative permeability of NSP4-VPD to cations and anions, we determined the current-voltage relationship in both symmetric and a 1:10 asymmetric KCl solutions. In symmetric 650 mM KCl, NSP4-VPD displayed a linear current-voltage relationship with a reversal potential of ~7 mV, representing a slight offset from the 0 mV value expected for symmetric buffers (Fig. 4) . The bath buffer was then exchanged to 65 mM KCl to generate a 1:10 gradient across the patch. In this condition, the equilibrium potentials calculated with the Nernst equation are −58 mV for K + (E K ) and +58 mV for Cl − (E Cl ). Thus, the I/V plot of an ideal K + -selective channel would intersect the abscissa (0 pA) at −58 mV, while that of an ideal Cl − -selective channel would intersect the abscissa at + 58 mV. The intersect of the I/V plot with the abscissa is called the "reversal potential". For NSP4 VPD, the 1:10 KCl gradient shifted the reversal potential to −39 mV, closer to E K and away from E Cl . This demonstrated that NSP4-VPD selectively conducted cations (K + ) over anions (Cl − ). With this data, we used the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation 12 to determine that NSP4-VPD has a ~16-fold greater selectivity for cations over anions, making it a strongly cation selective viroporin.
