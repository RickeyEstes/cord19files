A standard physical examination was performed on all cattle in the herd. No abnormalities were observed, except for complete blindness noted in the two calves from among 11 cattle, a morbidity rate of 18%. The calves exhibited bilaterally dilated pupils on slit lamp biomicroscopy, with no menace response or pupillary light reflex. The fundus examination using the indirect ophthalmoscope and a portable fundus camera (Genesis ® , Kowa, Tokyo, Japan) revealed swollen optic discs with indistinct margins bilaterally in both calves. No retinal changes, except for papilledema and an enlargement of the retinal veins, were observed ( Fig. 1) . Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using an i-BD multi detection kit (D60060, Intron, Seongnam, South Korea) to detect bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus, rotavirus and coronavirus; negative results were obtained for all three viruses from both the serum and the fecal samples of the two calves (Fig. 2) . No significant changes were observed in routine serum chemistry and electrolyte levels in either of the calves ( Table 1 ). The serum vitamin A concentration in both calves was low, with values of 0.481 µg/dl and 0.317 µg/dl for calf 1 and calf 2, respectively. Treatment with intramuscular injection of aqueous vitamin A accompanied by dietary vitamin supplement was recommended, but the owner chose only dietary supplementation of vitamin. Necropsy after slaughter of the calves was also suggested, but this, too, was refused by the owner for financial reasons. Dietary supplementation of vitamin A at a dose of 80,000 iu per head once a day was added to the ration of the herd [3, 6, 7] . No clinical response was identified in the affected calves. However, no further ocular problems were observed in this herd. The affected calves were planned to be brought to market weight and presented for slaughter.
