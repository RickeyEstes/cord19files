In vivo survival of the recombinant L.inn::vgc strain The ability of Listeria to survive in vivo at the early stage of infection is crucial for the induction of cell-mediated immunity [12, 13] . We examined the ability of L.inn::vgc to survive in the spleen and liver in infected mice and compared it to that of the wild type Lm. BALB/c mice were infected intravenously (i.v.) with sub-lethal doses of wild type Lm EGD-e (10 3 ), L.inn::vgc (10 7 ), or the wild type L.inn strain (10 7 ). Time points correlating with the critical phases of host immune response to listerial infection were selected and used to compare bacterial growth and induction of immune effectors in wild-type Lm, L.inn and L.inn::vgc strains. Day 3 of a Listeria infection refers to the end of the pre-immune phase before the expansion of specific T cells in the mouse model of listeriosis [14] . The presence of viable bacteria on this day has been shown to be critical for the successful induction of T cell-mediated immunity [15] . Therefore on day 3, bacterial load as well as spleen morphology was analyzed. Day 9 corresponds to the primary immune effector phase. At this time point, DTH to soluble antigen was measured in vivo as an indicator of DTH reaction and CD4+ T cell activity. Moreover, the numbers of antigen specific IFN-c producing CD8+ cytotoxic T cells were analyzed. Day 60 postinfection as well as day 5 post-challenge were chosen to analyze the memory immune effector phase [16] . To this end the number of memory effector T-cells was determined quantitatively. In vivo survival and growth kinetics of bacteria were followed by determining the number of bacteria in spleens and livers of infected mice. As expected, regardless of the dose of infection, the wild type L.inn strain was progressively cleared from both organs ( Fig. 1A) whereas the L.inn::vgc strain successfully survived in both spleen and liver during the first two days after infection as indicated by the bacterial numbers that increased in both spleen and liver till day 2 and gradually decreased over days 3 and 4 postinfection. On the other hand, the bacterial numbers of the wild type Lm, increased from day 1 till day 4 post-infection in both spleen and liver. Stimulation of Type I interferon's by the L.inn::vgc strain A striking phenomenon for cytosolic resident microbes is the ability to induce expression of Type I interferons. In contrast to the wild type Lm, its isogenic mutant lacking listeriolysin remains trapped in vacuoles and does not induce Type I interferon's [17] . We have recently documented that the L.inn::vgc can successfully survive inside phagocytic cells, thereby egressing from the phagolysosome [18] . In order to confirm if cytosolic persistence of the recombinant L.inn::vgc strain is efficient enough to stimulate production of such cytokines, we examined the transcriptional responses of IFN-a2 and IFN-b1 in bone marrow-derived macrophages following infection with Lm, L.inn as well as the recombinant L.inn::vgc strain. L.inn::vgc and the wild type Lm showed significantly higher transcriptional induction of both IFN-a2 and IFN-b1 than wild type L.inn at 2 hours post-infection (Fig. 1B) . This effect was more pronounced at a later time point (8 hours) post-infection reflecting the efficient intracellular survival pattern of the L.inn::vgc strain. The recombinant L.inn::vgc strain exhibits a lowered inflammatory response At the early stages of infection, wild type Lm is engulfed by professional phagocytes like macrophages, dendritic cells, or neutrophils. These cells produce a variety of proinflammatory cytokines which recruite or activate other inflammatory immune cells. The levels of IL-1ß, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-alpha in mice sera were measured over the first 4 days after infection with Lm (10 3 ), L.inn (10 7 ), and the L.inn::vgc strain (10 7 ). Like L. inn, , L.inn::vgc was not able to produce significant amounts of these cytokines over the first 4 days post-infection in spite of high infection doses (10 7 ) while primary infection with Lm led to high proinflammatory cytokine production (Fig. 2) . Both granuloma formation and delayed-type-hypersensitivity footpad responses have previously been shown to be CD4 + T cell dependent inflammatory responses following infection with Lm. Morphological changes were examined in the spleens on day 3 after i.v. infection. Although the numbers of bacteria in spleens at day 3 post-infection for both Lm and L.inn::vgc were approximately the same (Fig. 1A) , distinct differences in the morphological appearance between spleens isolated from mice infected with Lm and those isolated from mice infected with L.inn::vgc were observed (Fig. 3A ). Splenomegaly associated with extensive granuloma formation was observed in spleens of Lm infected mice, as a result of intensive leukocyte infiltration which was visualized in stained spleen sections (Fig. 3B) , whereas splenomegaly in the absence of granuloma formation was observed in spleens of L.inn::vgc infected mice. Infection with the wild type L.inn did not result in any morphological changes in spleens. These observations were confirmed by antigen-elicited skin responses showing corresponding results (Fig. 3C ). Mice were injected into the left hind footpads with 50 ml of somatic soluble Lm EGD-e antigen (60 ng/ml) at day 9 post-infection. Twentyfour hours later, thickness of the left and right footpads of individual mice were measured. Footpads of mice pre-immunized with L.inn::vgc showed reduced thickness than those of mice preimmunized with the wild type Lm. The wild type L.inn strain did not induce a DTH response in the footpads of these mice. Moreover, antigen-induced CD4+ T cell-derived IFN-gamma production of spleen cells was measured as an indication for a proinflammatory T cell response. Spleen cells were isolated at day 9 post-infection and stimulated in vitro with the released soluble antigen of L. monocytogenes EGD-e (100 ng). Spleen cells from mice immunized with L.inn::vgc produced significantly lower levels of IFN-gamma when compared to spleen cells from mice immunized with wild type Lm. The wild type L.inn strain failed to prime T cells for the production of IFN-gamma (Fig. S1 , supplementary information). Induction of T cell-mediated immunity by the recombinant L.inn::vgc strain A number of cell types are involved in host defense against Listeria. Antigen-specific T lymphocytes mediate recovery from primary listerial infections and protective immunity to subsequent infections [13, 19] . Both CD4 + (helper, MHC class II restricted) and CD8 + (cytotoxic, MHC class I restricted) T cell subpopulations have been implicated [20] . Experimental evidence indicates, however, that CD8 + T cells play the predominant role in mediating protective immunity [21] [22] [23] [24] . The ability of the recombinant L.inn::vgc to induce T-cell mediated immunity as a prerequisite for protective immunity was analyzed. Groups of BALB/c mice were infected with Lm (10 3 ), L.inn (10 7 ), or L.inn::vgc (10 7 ). Two months later, all mice were challenged with a lethal i.v. dose (10 5 ), corresponding to 206LD50, of the wild type Lm, and survival was monitored. As controls, a group of untreated BALB/c mice that received a similar lethal dose of the wild type Lm were included. A single pre-immunization with the L.inn::vgc strain led to a significant protection against subsequent lethal infection with Lm. As expected, all mice that were pre-immunized with sub-lethal doses of Lm were also protected against a lethal listerial infection and survived whereas all non-immunized mice as well as those preimmunized with L.inn died within 4 days after challenge (Fig. 4A) . Entry of Listeria into the cytosol is a critical event for CD8 + T cell recognition and induction of immunity [22] . In order to establish the correlation between the protection of mice preinfected with Lm or the L.inn::vgc strain upon lethal challenge and the induction of CD8 + T cells in response to infection, the generation of antigen-specific MHC class I restricted CD8 + T cells were quantitatively examined. The numbers of antigen-specific MHC class I restricted effector CD8 + T cells induced in mice spleens 9 days after primary infection and 5 days after challenge with the wild type Lm (2610 3 ) was determined through evaluation of the number of IFN-c producing CD8+ T cells induced showing reactivity against the dominant H-2K d restricted LLO 91-99 epitope [25] in an in vitro ELISPOT assay. As shown in Fig. 4B , infection with wild type Lm as well as the L.inn::vgc strain induced significant numbers of LLO 91-99 specific CD8 + T-cells. After recall infection the numbers of LLO 91-99 specific CD8 + T-cells showed a significant increase. On the other hand, infection with L.inn failed to induce a significant number of CD8 + T-cells either after primary infection or after challenge. To address the contribution of effector memory CD8+ T cells in mediating long-lasting immunity after re-infection with the wild type Lm, the expression level of the cell surface adhesion molecule CD62L was quantified. Expression of CD62L is down regulated on the surface of cytotoxic CD8 + T-cells when developed to protective memory T cells [21] . Two months after the primary infection, the number of CD8 + CD62L lo lymphocytes was approximately identical in all groups of primarily infected mice. This number increased dramatically upon re-infection with the wild type Lm (2610 3 ) in mice pre-immunized with Lm as well as with L.inn::vgc while pre-immunization with L.inn was not able to induce CD62L down-regulation seen in the other groups (Fig. 5 ). In addition we have monitored the expression of CD44 on CD8 + T-cells. CD44 is expressed at high levels on memory but not in naïve T-cells [26] . In mice that were primarily infected with Lm and L.inn::vgc, the expression of CD44 was upregulated on CD8 + T-cells 5 days post-challenge infection with the wild type Lm (2610 3 ) while primary infection with L.inn did not lead to a significant change in CD44 expression pattern (Fig. S3 ).
