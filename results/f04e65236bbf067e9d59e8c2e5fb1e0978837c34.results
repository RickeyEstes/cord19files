Of the 250 questionnaires distributed, 155 (62%) were returned completed. Participants included 78 senior medical staff (42 surgeons and 36 physicians) and 77 residents (41 surgical residents and 36 medical residents) ( Table 2 ). There were more male, 73.8% ( p = 0.002) than female surgeons, while there was no significant ( p = 0.061) gender difference within the physicians, 54.8% males. Neither were there significant differences in the proportion of male surgical residents (56.1%, p = 0.435) and male medical residents (58.3%, p = 0.317). The median age of all senior medical staff was 34 years (range 26-70 years) and 31 years (range 24-39 years) for all residents ( Table 2) . Regardless of the status of medical practitioners, the majority (85.9% senior practitioners and 87.0% residents) reported no previous formal SP education and most (87.2% senior practitioners and 88.3% residents) were willing to receive SP training ( Table 2) . The median scores for SP knowledge for all medical practitioners ranged from 6 to 7, while the range of median scores for attitudes was from 35 to 36 and that for practices from 2 to 3 ( Table 3 ). The median scores for knowledge and attitude were not significantly different ( p = 0.077 and p = 0.653, respectively) between surgeons (knowledge median 7.0 and attitudes median score 36) and physicians (knowledge median score 6.0 and attitudes median score 35); median scores for practices were less than half the possible total score of nine, although the median scores for surgeons, 3.0, and physicians, 3.0, were equal but differed significantly ( p = 0.036) ( Table 3) . Although median scores for knowledge and attitudes were moderate to high, surgeons were the only group where a Knowledge, attitude, and practices related to standard precautions 215 moderate to strong (r = 0.748) relationship between knowledge and attitudes was significant ( p < 0.0001) while for other medical groups this relationship was poor ( Table 4 ). The relationship between knowledge and practices for all practitioners was not significant, as was the case for attitudes and practices, where correlations were not significant for all practitioners except surgical residents, where the relationship was significant but not strong, r = 0.399 ( p = 0.029) ( Table 4 ). All medical practitioners' levels of knowledge were high for the same six items that were answered correctly by at least three quarters of practitioners within each group (Table 5) . Few medical practitioners answered correctly that needles should not be bent before disposal with correct knowledge ranging from 27.8% (physicians) to 55.6% (medical residents). As few as 9.5% of surgeons and 9.8% of surgical residents correctly believed that betadine was not used as a hand washing antiseptic solution. Less than three quarters of practitioners correctly knew that they had to wash hands before glove use with proportions of practitioners answering correctly ranging from 52.8% (physicians) to 70.7% (surgical residents). Only two of nine attitudinal items were answered as ''very much'' by more than 75% of practitioners (Table 6 ). These two items indicating good attitudes related to SP activities do not require effort or much persuasion; the proportion of practitioners washing hands after touching blood, body fluids, excretions and contaminated items ranged from 91.7% to 95.2%, and glove use for touching mucous membranes, proportions ranged from 69.4% to 95.2%. Only one SP practice item, hand washing after touching contaminated items, was always practiced by 75.6% to 100% of practitioners (Table 5) . A medical resident's knowledge towards SP was related to willingness to be trained ( p = 0.013) and a surgeon's practice of SP was related only to female gender ( p = 0.006). No other significant predictive relationships were found.
