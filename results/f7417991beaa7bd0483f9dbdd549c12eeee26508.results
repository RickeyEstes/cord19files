Poly(I:C) activates microglia and induces preoligodendrocyte cell death in mixed glial cultures Treatment of mixed glial cultures with poly(I:C) caused robust microglial activation as indicated by marked changes in morphology ( Figure 1A ), TNFα secretion ( Figure 1B ) and increased cell death as determined by LDH release 48 h after the treatment ( Figure 1C ). Processes of poly(I:C)-activated microglia were frequently found to be in close proximity to preOLs, suggesting an increase in their surveillance properties ( Figure 1A , arrow). Immunocytochemical analysis revealed an approximate 28% loss of preOLs in the poly(I:C) stimulated cultures when compared to control cultures (Figure 1D) . Furthermore, poly(I:C) reduced preOL viability in a dose-dependent manner that appeared to correlate with TNF production (Figure 2A-D) . These data indicate that poly(I:C) stimulation in mixed glial cultures is toxic to preOLs. Poly(I:C) is not directly toxic to pre-oligodendrocytes As oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia reportedly express TLR3 [7, 15] , a prominent receptor for poly(I:C), it was possible that preOLs in mixed glial cultures were dying in a cell autonomous fashion in response to poly(I: C). Consistent with previous reports, western blot analysis revealed that all glial cells expressed TLR3 in culture ( Figure 3A) . To examine the direct effects of poly (I:C) on preOLs, purified preOL cultures were stimulated with increasing concentrations of poly(I:C) and cell viability was determined. In contrast to poly(I:C)-induced preOL death in mixed glial cultures, we found that poly (I:C) was not toxic to pure preOLs ( Figure 3B-C) . Instead, poly(I:C) treatment appeared to result in increased viability, but this effect was not statistically significant. TNFa and its cognate receptor R1 are responsible for preoligodendrocyte cell death following poly(I:C) stimulation in mixed glia cultures To test whether the detrimental effects of poly(I:C) were attributable to TNFα production, we prepared mixed glial cultures from TNFα -/-, TNFR1 -/and their corresponding wildtype (WT) mice. As we previously found that both TNFα production and TNFR1 signaling are required for LPS-induced preOL cytotoxicity in mixed glial cultures, we used LPS as a positive control [24, 25] . Similar to LPS, poly(I:C) induced significant TNFα production in B6129 (WT), C57BL/6 (WT) and TNFR1 -/-, but not in TNFα -/mixed glial cultures ( Figure 4A&4D ). TNFα production from poly(I:C) stimulated cultures was generally lower than those stimulated with LPS, an effect that was significant in B6129 and TNFR1 -/cultures ( Figure 4A&4D ). To determine if preOL viability decreased upon poly (I:C) stimulation in various cultures we counted the number of preOLs under each condition. Consistent with the above data, stimulation of WT cultures with poly(I:C) or LPS resulted in significant loss of O4 + cells compared to vehicle control treated cultures (Figure 4B&4E ). In contrast, this cytotoxic effect was abolished in TNFα deficient mixed glial cultures ( Figure  4C ). Deletion of the TNFα receptor tnfr1 also abrogated the poly(I:C)-triggered TNF-mediated toxicity to preOLs ( Figure 4F ) despite a comparable level of TNFα production in WT and TNFR1 -/cultures (Figure 4D) . These results demonstrate that TNFα is required for oligodendroglial cell death in mixed cultures challenged with poly(I:C) or LPS and that the signal needed to induce cell death is dependent on TNFR1. Microglia are the sole source of TNFa secretion after poly (I:C) stimulation in culture Both microglia and astrocytes are capable of cytokine and chemokine secretion following recognition of various pathogen associated molecular patterns including poly(I:C). To determine the cellular source of TNFα secretion in our cultures, purified microglia, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes were treated with PBS or poly(I:C) for 24 h and TNFα levels were determined by ELISA. We found that microglia, but neither astrocytes nor oligodendrocytes, produced TNFα following poly(I:C) stimulation ( Figure 5A ). To confirm this finding, we then conducted RT-PCR analysis on RNA isolated from microglia and astrocyte monocultures stimulated with or without poly(I:C) for 24 h. Both microglia and astrocytes expressed TLR3. TNFα and IL-1β transcripts were induced by poly(I:C) in microglia, but undetectable in astrocytes. Moreover, transcription of IL-6 was evident in stimulated microglia and in poly(I:C) stimulated astrocytes ( Figure 5B ). The expression of the macrophage/microglia marker Iba-1 and astrocyte marker GFAP from the same samples indicated that there was virtually no microglia contamination of astrocyte cultures, but some astrocyte contamination in microglia cultures ( Figure 5B ). Additionally, microglia but not astrocytes responded to poly(I:C) by producing TNFα in a dose-and time-dependent fashion ( Figure 5C ). These results strongly indicate that microglia are the producers of TNFα in mixed glial cultures. To further determine whether microglia were indeed the TNFα producers and to test whether microgliaderived factors were capable of inducing astroglial TNFα, we performed intracellular cytokine staining for TNFα in mixed cultures treated with poly(I:C). We found that TNFα + cells with microglia morphology were abundant upon stimulation with poly(I:C) or LPS, but were absent in vehicle control treated mixed glial cultures ( Figure 5D ). Immunostaining of poly(I:C)-stimulated cultures with an isotype control antibody did not reveal any non-specific signal (not shown). Importantly, dual staining for TNFα and either GFAP or Iba-1 demonstrated that astrocytes did not produce TNFα following stimulation with LPS or poly(I:C) as TNFα + cells never localized to GFAP + cells ( Figure 5D ). Instead, TNFα immunoreactivity was confined to Iba-1 + cells, indicating microglia as being the sole source of TNFα under these conditions ( Figure 5E ). Our observation that astrocytes express TLR3, yet did not produce TNFα following poly(I:C) stimulation raised the possibility that poly(I:C) was incapable of activating astrocytes under our experimental paradigms. To test whether exogenous poly(I:C) was sufficient to elicit a response from astrocytes, we next determined the expression of chemokines CCL2 and CCL5, which have been previously reported to be substantially induced in astrocytes following extracellular poly(I:C) stimulation [11, 27] . Again, while stimulation of astrocytes with poly(I:C) resulted in negligible TNFα transcription we observed marked up-regulation of both CCL2 and CCL5 in a time-and dose-dependent fashion (Figure 5F ), which was further confirmed by qRT-PCR analyses ( Figure 5G-J) . These results indicate that astrocytes indeed respond to poly(I:C) and produce chemokines while at the same time fail to transcribe TNFα.
