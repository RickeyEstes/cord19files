From November 2016 to March 2017, 533 NPS were collected from 499 children presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. Fifteen samples were excluded from the final analysis due to unavailability of sample aliquots for RT-PCR testing (n = 7), duplicate sampling of patients during one hospital stay (n = 7), or missed re-testing of an initially invalid Alere i RSV test result (n = 1). Five hundred eighteen samples (97% of 533 collected NPS) from 492 children were included in the final analysis (Fig. 1) . Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study participants are summarized in Table 1 . Alere i RSV was positive in 43% (224/518) and negative in 57% (294/518). In comparison to the RT-PCR reference standard, the Alere i RSV test result was true positive in 213 and true negative in 278 samples, respectively. False positive test results were reported in 11 patients, and 16 patients were identified with false negative Alere i RSV test outcome ( Table 2 ). The overall Alere i RSV test sensitivity and specificity was 93% (CI 95 89% -96%) and 96% (CI 95 93% -98%), respectively. The mean FTD 21 C T value of true positive samples was 17.7 (CI 95 17.1-18.3; range 11.7-34.6). NPS with false negative Alere i RSV result had a significantly higher mean C T value of 31.1 (CI 95 29.6-32.6; range 25.4-34.5, P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney-U-test). We grouped the admission diagnoses in cases of URTI (n = 81, including URTI, otitis media and croup), LRTI (n = 257, including bronchiolitis, bronchitis and pneumonia) and non-respiratory admission diagnoses (n = 180). The latter includes children admitted for non-respiratory reasons (e.g. febrile convulsion, diarrhea) with concomitant acute RTI  From the clinical perspective, C T values were higher (and hence viral load lower) in respiratory specimens of older children and children admitted for non-respiratory reasons with concomitant respiratory tract infection (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). In consequence, the Alere i RSV sensitivity was 98% (CI 95 94% -100%) in children <6 months, 94% (CI 95 81% -99%) in children 6-11 months, 83% (CI 95 68% -93%) in children 12-23 months and 87% (CI 95 73% -96%) in children above 2 years of age (Table 3 ). In children hospitalized for URTI or LRTI, the Alere i RSV test sensitivity was 100% (CI 95 84-100%) and 96% (CI 95 92-99%), respectively. In children who were admitted for non-respiratory reasons, we found a sensitivity of 77% (CI 95 61% -88%) ( Table 3) . As illustrated in Additional file 1: Figure S2 , the relatively poor sensitivity in this group resulted from a high proportion of samples with low viral load (C T value >30), and coinfection with Influenza A, Parainfluenza, Rhinovirus or Coronavirus was detected in 5 / 10 cases. We did not undertake comprehensive analytical specificity testing but note that the 289 NPS with negative RT-PCR result included samples tested positive for Influenza A, H1N1 or B (n = 42), Rhinovirus (n = 99), Bocavirus (n = 23), Adenovirus (n = 18), Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 or 4 (n = 36), Coronavirus NL63, 229E, OC43 or HKU1 (n = 41), Parechovirus (n = 3), Enterovirus (n = 3), Human metapneumovirus A/B (n = 12) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 3). In RSV positive specimens, observed coinfections included Rhinovirus (n = 38), Coronavirus (n = 25), Parainfluenza (n = 12), Bocavirus (n = 9) and Influenza (n = 8). In 65 cases, neither RSV nor any of the above-mentioned pathogens were detected. In our point-of-care setting, positive test results were identified after a mean duration of 5.1 min (CI 95 4.9-5.2 min; range 4.7-10.0 min). This included both sample pre-heating (3 min) and the amplification reaction. After the first testing, invalid results were reported in 6% (29/ 518). These NPS were directly retested, and valid (positive or negative) results were obtained in all cases.
