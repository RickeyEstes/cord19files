All four outbreaks involved primarily adult horses ranging in age from 1 to 29 years (median 15 years). Fiftynine horses developed clinical signs with 12-16 sick horses per outbreak (Table 1 ). The main clinical signs reported were anorexia (52 horses), lethargy (46) and fever (43). The rectal temperature of febrile horses ranged from 101.5 to 105.8 8F (median 104.1 8F). Changes in fecal character, ranging from soft-formed to watery consistency, and colic were observed in 12 and 4 horses, respectively. Clinical signs generally resolved within 1-4 days with supportive care. Four horses from 3 different outbreaks were euthanized or died due to rapid progression of clinical signs. Two horses showed acute onset of neurological disease including depression, ataxia and recumbency. Two additional horses were euthanized due to severe endotoxemia. The cause of death could not be determined with necropsy evaluation in the two horses with neurological signs, while bacteremia secondary to gastrointestinal translocation was suspected in the additional 2 horses. The outbreak period lasted approximately 3 weeks for each of the stables. Blood work was available from 10 horses with clinical disease, and common hematological abnormalities were leucopenia (<4600/ml; 7 horses) due to neutropenia (<2260/ml; 6 horses) and/or lymphopenia (<1500/ml; 9 horses). Feces were available for ECoV testing by real-time PCR from 44 to 96 sick and healthy horses, respectively. 38/44 (86%) horses with abnormal clinical signs tested PCR positive for ECoV with absolute genome equivalents ranging from 7887 to 7.2 Â 10 7 equivalents/g of feces (median 538,410 genome equivalents/g of feces). 89/96 (93%) healthy horses tested PCR negative for ECoV. The seven healthy horses had viral loads ranging from 55,683 to 3.9 Â 10 6 equivalents/g of feces (median 228,520 genome equivalents/g of feces). There was no statistical difference in absolute ECoV quantitation between PCR positive sick and healthy horses ( Fig. 1 ; Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.71). The overall agreement between clinical status and PCR detection of ECoV was 91%. Follow-up samples were available from 7 sick horses. PCR detection of ECoV persisted for 3-9 days (median 4 days) in these 7 horses. Sequence comparison of a 435-nucleotide segment of the N gene of ECoV showed between 99.5 and 100% homology amongst the 4 study strains and between 97.9 and 99.0% homology with the NC99 and the Tokachi09 strain ( Fig. 2 ; Zhang et al., 2007) .
