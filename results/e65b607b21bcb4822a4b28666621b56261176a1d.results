In total, 70 patients (41 males, 29 females) from the two surgical wards were quarantined. The median age was 59 years (range: 21 -90 years). A total of 39 (56%) had a surgical procedure before quarantine and only one patient required an emergency operation during the quarantine period. The patient co-morbidities within the cohort included diabetes mellitus (33%), hypertension (40%), ischaemic heart disease (13%), malignancy (33%), chronic renal failure (6%) and chronic obstructive airway disease (4%). Most patients were ethnic Chinese except for nine Malays, five Indians and five others. A schematic representation of the warding of patients after the transfer is shown in Figure 1 .
