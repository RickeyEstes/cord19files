Normalized data and DEGs. As presented in Fig. 1 , gene expression was uniformly distributed following data normalization. In addition, total 209 DEGs including 107 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes were screened. In the PCA diagram, the light blue circles represent samples from patients with ALI and the pink circles represent samples from patients with sepsis. The majority of circles are separate, which indicates that all DEGs were able to distinguish between samples from patients with ALI and sepsis, and those from patients with sepsis alone (Fig. 2) . Enriched GO-BP term and KEGG pathways. Significantly enriched GO-BP terms, as well as the enriched genes in each term, are presented in Fig. 3 . DEGs were associated with the cellular response to unfolded protein and response to unfolded protein, cell cycle phase, cell adhesion mediated by integrin, B cell proliferation and T cell receptor signaling as the nodes were notably larger. Furthermore, heat shock protein family A, Hsp70, member 5 (HSPA5), heat shock protein 90 kDa β, member 1 (HSP90B1), zinc finger and BTB domain containing 17 (ZBTB17), Golgi SNAP receptor complex member 2 (GOSR2), TatD DNase domain containing 2 and hypoxia upregulated 1 (HYOU1) were differentially regulated to a greater extent than other genes in the network (Fig. 3) . Fig. 4 indicated that DEGs are primarily involved in pathways associated with antigen processing and presentation, glycerophospholipid metabolism, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, thyroid hormone synthesis and pathways associated with diseases, such as asthma. In addition, major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR α (HLA-DRA) and major histocompatibility complex, class II, DQ β1 (HLA-DQB1) were highlighted in the network. Cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86) was associated with several signaling pathways including, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune thyroid disease and graft-versus-host disease and it was also determined to be involved in the network. The constructed DCEN. The DCEN, which was composed of 2,482 edges and 2,109 nodes was obtained following the comparison of the ALI.CEN and the Sepsis.CEN (Fig. 5) . Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2D 4 (UBE2D4; putative; degree=529), (tubulin, γ complex associated protein 3, (TUBGCP3; degree=271) and centromere protein O (CENPO; degree=269) which were co-expressed in ALI samples, were the top three genes in the network. GO-BP enrichment analysis revealed that UBE2D4 and TUBGCP3 were primarily associated with cell differentiation, phylogeny and RNA stability, whereas CENPO may participate in intercellular communication (data not shown). Interactions between DEGs and different drugs. Interactions between target DEGs and drugs are presented in Table I . These included interactions between HSP90B1 and adenosine-5'-diphosphate and radicicol; HLA-DQB1 and amoxicillin, HLA-DQB1 and insulin, porcine; HSPA5 and antihemophilic factor; and CD86 and abatacept as well as antithymocyte globulin. Interactions mean that these DEGs may target the corresponding drugs.
