Estimated parameters, i.e., yearly incidence and yearly probability of diagnosis, are shown in Fig. 2 . With the assumed median incubation period of 10.0 years, the yearly incidence was the highest from 2005-2008, with an estimated 1,972 (95% CI: 1,829, 2,115) infections per year ( Fig. 2A) . Subsequently, the incidence began to decline; the yearly estimate in the most recent interval (from 2013-2017) was 1,179 (95% CI: 1,047, 1,293) infections. The yearly probability of diagnosis has monotonously improved over time (Fig. 2B) . The estimated diagnosis probability by 1999 was less than 10%, but the latest estimate from 2013-2017 was 15.6% (95% CI: 14.8%, 16.4%). The qualitative patterns of HIV incidence and diagnosis did not vary greatly, even when shorter and longer median incubation periods were used (Figs. 2C and 2D) . Figures 2E and 2F show maximum likelihood estimates of the incidence and probability of diagnosis by sex. The incidence in males was the highest from 2005-2008; the latest estimate from 2013-2017 ranged from 1,015 to 1,363 infections per year, assuming a median incubation period from 7.5 to 12.3 years. Similarly, the incidence in females was highest from 1993-1996, ranging from 86 to 97 infections per year; the latest yearly incidence ranged from 31 to 54 infections with a median incubation period of 7.5 to 12.3 years. The yearly probability of diagnosis among males behaved similarly to that of the entire population, but there was no apparent improvement in the frequency of diagnosis among females. In general, female enjoyed higher rate of diagnosis than male. For the entire population with median incubation period at 10.0 years, AIC with the Poisson distributed likelihood was 650.7, while that with negative binomially distributed likelihood was 655.0, indicating that the dataset was not over-dispersed. In fact, dispersion parameters for HIV and AIDS were estimated at greater than 100, indicating that Poisson distribution has sufficiently captured the variation. Figure 3 shows a comparison between the observed and predicted number of HIV diagnoses and AIDS cases. All three models with different median incubation periods yielded almost identically good fit to the data (Fig. 3A) , reflecting mutual compensations between λ and α to fit to the data. Even though the number of diagnosed HIV infections and AIDS cases was relatively small for females, the proposed model successfully captured the observed patterns of HIV diagnoses and AIDS cases by sex (Fig. 3B) . Including and excluding AIDS cases, the estimated proportions of diagnosed HIV infections are shown in Figs. 4C and 4D. Including AIDS cases, the diagnosed proportion was estimated at 81.9% (range 78.7% to 85.7%) using the median incubation period of 10.0 (7.5 to 12.3) years. Excluding AIDS cases, the estimate was 75.7% (range 71.8% to 80.5%). Figures 4E and 4F show the estimated number of undiagnosed HIV infections and the diagnosed proportion by sex, excluding AIDS cases. Estimates of undiagnosed HIV infections among males behaved similarly to the entire population of Japanese nationals, whereas those of females peaked in the year 2001. In the latest time interval (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) (2017) , it was estimated that 5,150 infections (range 3,881 to 6,287) in males and 210 infections (range 162 to 255) in females remained unrecognized, using the median incubation period of 10.0 (with the range of 7.5 to 12.3) years. The diagnosed proportion of both males and females increased with time, and females tended to yield higher estimates than males. In the latest time interval from 2013-2017, the diagnosed proportion (excluding AIDS cases) was estimated at 75.3% (range 71.4% to 80.2%) among males and 82.1% (range 79.1% to 85.6%) among females. Figure 5 shows the undiagnosed number of HIV infections and the proportion of diagnosed infections at the end of 2017. The uncertainty bound was greatest with an assumed median incubation period of 12.3 years, with an estimated 6,552 infections (95% CI: 5,632, 7,471). Figure 5B shows the diagnosed proportion, including and excluding AIDS cases, with 95% confidence intervals. Even when AIDS cases were included, the 2,321 deaths known up to that point were subtracted from AIDS cases in advance of the calculation. Assuming that the median incubation period was 10.0 years, the calculation, inclusive of surviving AIDS cases, yielded 80.3% (95% CI: 78.7%, 82.0%); when excluding AIDS cases, the proportion was 75.7% (95% CI: 73.8%, 77.6%).
