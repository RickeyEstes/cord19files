Anv inhibited superoxide production by neutrophil in response to PMA The effect of Anv on ROS production by human neutrophils was compared with that of Zyg, another North African medicinal plant Zyg, which is similarly used to treat against inflammatory diseases, even though they are of different genus. We also studied the established anti-inflammatory drug, aspirin [10] and fMLF or PMA was used to stimulate ROS production which was measured by using luminol-amplified chemiluminescence as shown in Additional file 1. Anv was a strong inhibitor of ROS production with a similar IC 50 value (60 μg/mL) for either fMLF or PMA response while Zyg was poorly effective. The aspirin IC 50 values were 200 μg/mL and 300 μg/mL for inhibiting fMLF or PMA response respectively. To gain further insight in the mechanism of Anv inhibition, we explore its effect on the production of superoxide anion, the first product of NADPH oxidase. We used the cytochrome c reduction assay which is a specific technique for measuring superoxide anion. As shown in (Fig. 1a) Anv dose-dependently inhibited O 2 .production by human neutrophils stimulated with fMLF. Further, a dramatic inhibition of O 2 .production was observed in response to PMA. We investigated if this inhibition was due to a scavenging of O 2 .by Anv extract by using the in vitro xanthine oxidase production of O 2 .-. Results in (Fig. 1b) , show that the production of O 2 .was not significantly altered in the presence of increasing concentrations of Anv. Taken together, the results are in favour of an Anv effect on NADPH oxidase activity as opposed to a scavenging activity. Anv inhibited p47 phox and PKC translocation to the neutrophil plasma membrane in response to PMA We investigated if Anv can modulate PMA-induced translocation of p47 phox and PKC in neutrophils which represents a potential immuno-modulatory pathway. We compared the effect of Anv with the water-soluble polysaccharide extract of Zyg which did not modulate O 2 .production by human neutrophils in response to PMA, thus suggesting the involvement of different mechanisms and represented a potential control versus active Anv (data not shown). The results in (Fig. 2a, left  panel) show that neither Anv nor Zyg was able to promote the translocation of p47 phox to neutrophil plasma membrane in the resting state. When neutrophils were incubated with PMA, it stimulated a strong translocation of p47 phox . This PMA-induced translocation was significantly inhibited in the presence of Anv and not Zyg as indicated by the histogram. Similar results were obtained with PKCβ showing that Anv was effective in inhibiting PKCβ translocation to plasma membrane in response to PMA (Fig. 2b) . Further, activation of NADPH oxidase in neutrophils by PMA is known to be accompanied by a strong phosphorylation of Ser328 in the regulatory subunit, p47 phox [24] . We detected little or no phosphorylation using a specific anti-phosphoSer328 antibody, in control samples (Fig. 2c) , while PMA induced a strong Ser328 phosphorylation. Interestingly, Anv at the same concentration used above (300 μg/ml) significantly inhibited this phosphorylation of p47 phox on Ser328 stimulated by PMA while Zyg was ineffective.
