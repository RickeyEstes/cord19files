The À1 frameshifting stimulator of SARS CoV contains an atypical H-type pseudoknot with an extra stem-loop in loop 2 Sequence alignment of the junction regions of ORF 1ab of SARS CoV and other coronaviruses indicated the existence of conserved UUUAAAC slippery site followed by a stretch of viral RNA sequences with the potential to form an H-type RNA pseudoknot ( Figure 1 ). This region of the SARS CoV RNA genome, SARS 13 369-13 520 (for residues 13 369-13 520) was thus cloned into p2luc vector to examine its À1 frameshifting activity (21) . To faithfully monitor frameshift efficiency, we also arranged the terminus of the viral sequences under investigation to keep the TAA sequences in the N-terminal part of firefly luciferase ORF in frame to act as a stop codon in the presence of À1 frameshifting. This leads to premature termination of the frameshifted product and, thus, prevents the underestimation of frameshift efficiency because this manipulation can minimize the ribosome drop-off effect while translating the full-length firefly ORF (21) . A different vector, pRL-SV40 was also used as the second reporter. Frameshift assay using either of the reporters indicated that the selected viral RNA sequences possess a frameshift efficiency of 60% (data not shown), which suggests that the SARS 13 369-13 520 RNA contains an efficient À1 frameshifting stimulator in vitro. Further examination of sequence contents of the SARS 13 369-13 520 RNA revealed a potential stem-loop structure within the loop 2 region of this IBV-type pseudoknot. Furthermore, their primary sequences were found to be conserved among isolated SARS CoV sequences, and similar stem-loop structures were also identified in the loop 2 region of bovine coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus pseudoknot ( Figure 1 ). To confirm the existence of the predicted atypical pseudoknot, enzymatic structure probing experiments were performed on SARS 13 377-13 475 RNA and some of the results are shown in Figure 2A . As can be seen, the distribution of cleavage patterns for ribonuclease probes sensitive to singlestrand region (such as RNase T2, T1 and A in lanes 7-12 of Figure 2A ) is in agreement with the existence of loop regions, whereas the cleavage pattern by RNase V1 (lanes 5 and 6) that prefers cutting of duplex and stacked conformations can be localized to the three predicted stem regions (S1, S2 and S3). However, co-existence of cleavage by both RNase V1 and single-strand sensitive probes can be found for nucleotides localized to the junction region between S2 and S3. This is probably caused by a dynamic conformational equilibrium in this region as non-denaturing gel analysis suggests that the A B SARS 13 377-13 475 RNA adopts a single conformation (data not shown). Nevertheless, these probing data are consistent with the existence of a stem conformation within the loop 2 in this atypical IBV-type pseudoknot as summarized in Figure 2B . Recently, the same S3 conformation has also been proposed and verified independently (23, 24) . Disruption of the base pairing region in S3 of an atypical pseudoknot impairs À1 frameshifting stimulation activity of the SARS 13 369-13 520 RNA. To define the contribution of different stem regions of this atypical IBV-type pseudoknot in the stimulation of À1 frameshifting activity, we mutated those nucleotides mapped onto form the duplex conformations. Mutants expected to disrupt a stem and those expect to reform the stem by compensatory base changes were then measured for their efficiency in promoting À1 frameshifting in vitro ( Figure 3A ). As shown in lanes 1-3 of Figure 3B , frameshift efficiency drops from 60% for wild-type construct to <1% for both 5 0 and 3 0 mutants that prevent the formation of base pairing in S1. In contrast, frameshift efficiency for the mutant with compensatory base changes to restore the base pairing scheme in S1 (lane 2 of Figure 3C ) rises back to the wild-type level (55%). Similar results are observed for S2 with mutants destroying or reforming base pairs in the mapped duplex region (lanes 4 and 5 of Figure 3B and Lane 3 of Figure 3C ). These experiments complement structural mapping data and strongly support the idea that it is the formation of the two typical H-type pseudoknot stems, S1 and S2, and not their sequence identities are required for efficient À1 frameshifting stimulation. Interestingly, lower sensitivity to base pairing disruption is observed for mutants located in the mapped S3 region. Mutants with disruption of base pairing in the upper or and in the lower stem region of S3 both led to a substantial decrease in frameshift efficiency when compared with the wild-type construct (from 60 to 36 or 37%, respectively, in lanes 6 and 7 of Figure 3B ). However, restoring the base pairing scheme in either portion by compensatory base changes restored frameshift efficiency to the wild-type level including the up-restoration mutant that even displays a completely different sequence composition (lanes 4 and 5 in Figure 3C ), suggesting that the formation of base pairing and not the sequence contents in S3 is involved in the efficient frameshifting activity of this atypical IBV-type pseudoknot. Intriguingly, frameshift efficiency does not reduce further when more bases were mutated to disrupt all the potential base pair in S3 (lanes 8 and 9 of Figure 3B ), implicating the existence of a residual frameshift activity for the remaining pseudoknot scaffold. Furthermore, a pseudoknot mutant lacking the S3 but harboring an 8 nt loop 2 possesses a frameshift efficiency of 53% (lane 10 in Figure 3B ). As the topology and activity of this mutant are similar to those of the minimal IBV pseudoknot that lacks 75% of its wild-type loop 2 sequences (25) , which indicates that S3 is not absolutely required for high frameshift efficiency. To rule out the possibility that the observed frameshift efficiency variation in S3 mutants is the outcome of their differences in ribosome loading efficiency of uncapped mRNA templates, separately transcribed capped mRNAs were also used to examine their in vitro frameshift efficiency as shown in Figure 3D . The data confirm the result from transcription-coupled translation approach used above, although lower frameshift efficiency for the wild-type construct is observed. Together, these data suggest that the roles of S3 in À1 frameshifting stimulation may be different from those of S1 to S2. Viral RNA sequences upstream of the slippery site can downregulate À1 frameshift efficiency in vitro Recently, analysis of a SARS CoV viral RNA genome containing a longer viral construct has revealed a very different frameshift efficiency from those observed in this work (26) . To resolve this issue, we constructed a series of longer viral RNAcontaining reporters with stepwise extension of viral insert in the 5 0 direction upstream of the slippery site and measured their frameshift efficiencies. As shown in Figure 4A , frameshift efficiency of these viral RNA constructs are all lower than that of the shorter SARS 13 369-13 520 RNA construct. Analysis of these data suggested that the proximal 150 nt region upstream of the slippery site, that is, the sequences 13 222-13 368 possess most of the observed downregulation effect because addition of the other 475 nt further upstream of it (the sequences 13 222-12 748) only lead to a 2% decrease in frameshift efficiency (compare lane 7 with lane 3 of Figure 4A ). Together, it argues that the SARS 13 222-13 368 viral RNA may possess a signal for the attenuation of À1 frameshift efficiency. To confirm that the decrease in frameshift efficiency is contributed by the SARS 13 222-13 368 viral RNA sequence, a reporter containing a large viral insert but lacking the potential attenuation signal (sequences 13 222-13 368), SARS 12 748-13 368 D att was constructed. This construct possesses a frameshift efficiency of 55% although much longer protein is translated upstream of the slippery site and, thus, confirming the attenuation activity of the removed domain (compare lanes 2-4 of Figure 4B ). Furthermore, the downregulation effect almost disappears for a chimera construct that has the potential attenuation signal fused downstream to the pseudoknot stimulator, arguing that this attenuation signal need to be positioned upstream of the slippery site to execute its function in vitro (lane 5 of Figure 4B ). To examine whether the observed downregulation effect is mediated by polypeptide encoded by the viral RNA or by the RNA itself, an ORF-shifted mutant was generated and tested for its attenuation activity. In this construct, an A residue and two U residues are separately inserted into three different positions of the SARS 13 222-13 368 viral RNA to shift the reading frame, and consequently change the identity for 43 of the 50 amino acids encoded by the wild-type viral RNA sequences ( Figure 5A ). The result in Figure 5A indicates similar downregulation effect for this construct when compared with the wild-type construct. Taken together, these data provide strong evidences that the upstream RNA itself as well as its orientation to the slippery site are crucial for the cis downregulation effect of À1 frameshift efficiency in vitro, and the most stable structure of SARS 13 222-13 368 RNA predicted by RNA structure version 4.11 (27) is presented in Figure 5B with a calculated free energy of À37.7 kcal/mol.
