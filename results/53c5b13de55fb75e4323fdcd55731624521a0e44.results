V&YLS purity. The virus used throughout these studies was purified to a 5000-fold decrease in total protein, with a yield of he purity of the virus (at an HA titer of 1.3 X IOj) was confirmed by immunologic procedures, density gradient centrifugation, electron microscopy, and analytical procedures. Electron microscopy at low and high magnifications showed very clean fields of particles exhibit,ing the pleomorphism typical of this virus (Almeida and Tyrrell, 1967; Almeida and Waterson, 1970; Apostolov eE GEL, 1970; McIntosh et al., 1970; Bradburne and Tyrrell, 1971) . Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed a sharp peak at 15,000 rpm with as little as 1.0 mg protein in the sample; this peak had the same sedimentation rate as one of several broad peaks observed when crude virus (at 2-4 mg protein/.4 ml) was sedimented under identical conditions. Acrylamide gels loaded with untreated concentrated supernatant fluids obtained from eentrifugation (23,SOOg, 2 hr) of purified virus suspensions revealed no protein bands. Imnunixation and serology. Mice, guinea pigs, and chickens were immunized with normal SMB (NSMB), crude SW%grown OC 43, and purified virus. All sera obtaine before and during the course of immunization were tested for III, CF, and precipitating antibody. Preimmunization serum samples and sera from normal animals were consistently negative. Among the postimmunization serum samples, mouse as&tic fluid and chicken antisera had the lowest HI and Cl? antibody tit'ers to OC 43 virus and guinea pig antisera had the highest titers (Table 1)~ ice and guinea pigs immunized shoxved low-level and CF nst the purified CC antigen. Inznzunodi$usion with unsolubilid zi~zis~ Mouse as&tic fluids and mose antiserums prepared against crude virus and purified virus gave predominantly single bands (of identity) with pure or crude virus in standard ID tests. However, test's with guinea pig and chicken anti-crude and anti-pnre virus sera showed two precipitin bands of complete identity bet'ween pure and crude virus, and one additional band of identity between pure virus, crude virus, and NSl8B (Fig.  IA) . These results suggest that. the CC 43 virion contains at least one mouse brain antigen Addit'ional evidence of host antigen in the intact virus is en by the identical he between anti-KS1$ serum and the three concentrated antigens (Fig. 333) . Immune-~ electrophoresis of t'hese same antigenantiserum eombinations demonstrated three or four preeipit,in arcs with crude virus and two-three arcs with purified virus, and con. firmed the presence of a mouse brain protein associated with the purified virus (Fig. 2) . PAGE with solubilixed virus. The purified virus was solubilized with SLS-ME-urea, and the resulting proteins were separated by PAGE. The staining patterns with Coomassie blue revealed a minimum of six bands, five of which might be considered major (Fig. 3) . One additional very faint band was occasionally observed between bands one and two. The molecular weights of the viral proteins, as determined by co-and companion electrophoresis with proteins of known molecular weights, were estimated to be 191,000; 104,000; 60,000; 47,000; 30,000; and 15,000 in decreasing order (Fig. 4) . The very faint band was located in the 165,000-dalton region of several gels. Gels were also stained for lipid and carbohydrate (Fig. 5) No. 1 was more evident in gels in which the sample was not heated, than in those in which it was heated at 100°C for 1 min. Glycopolypeptide No. 2 (8 %) was found in the smallest quantity ( Table 2) . Composition of the projection antigen. The spikes on the virion surface have previously been associated with HA activity and are thought to comprise the major antigens measured by both the HI and CF tests. Hence these surface spikes or "projection ant,igens," unlike influenza virus, appear to consist of a single species (Kaye et al., 1970) . Absence of neuraminidase was confirmed using a highly sensitive assay system (Laver and Kilbourne, 1966; Laver and Valentine, 1969) : overnight incubation of lo5 HA units of virus with fetuin failed to yield any detectable sialic acid. Attempts to determine directly which polypeptides comprise the external antigen were unsuccessful. Bands from acrylamide gels were eluted in PBS, dialyzed, and titrated for direct and indirect hemagglutination. In both tests, the apparent residual SLS adversely affected the erythrocytes. Repeated attempts to determine the composition of the projection antigen by selectively removing the entire projection from the virus envelope also were of limited value. The agents used represented the major chemical groups often employed in similar studies : reduc ing agents (6.0 M guanidine + 5.0 mlVl dithiothreitol (DTT); 0.003 and 0.03 M DTT; 0.005, 0.05, and 0.5 ,U 2mercaptoethylamine) ; oxidizing agents (67.0 and 85.7 % dimethylsulfoxide; 0.1 and 0.2 % fl-propiolactone); ionic detergents (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 % desoxycholate; 0.5 % Tween 20) ; and nonionic detergents (1.0 % Nonidet P-40; 1.0% P-40 + 0.5 M urea). These chemical treatments, all used in selected buffer, salt, pH, and temperature environments, were uniformly nonselective and were overly destructive to the entire virion. The bromelin procedure described by Compans et al. (1970) for infiuenzaviruses purified virus was monitored every 30 mill was employed as an indirect means of locat-under the electron microscope. The ~rojeeing t,he proteins comprising the projection tions were completely degraded after 2 Ix of antigen. 'The effect of bromelin treatment on incubation at, 37°C with 0.13 % bromelia. ET AL. The 2-hr test samples, along with the appropriate virus and enzyme controls, were repurified on 5-40% aqueous neutral potassium tartrate gradients in an SW39L rotor at 75,000g for 8 hr. The untreated control virus banded in the 1.18 g/cm3 region of the gradient and was associated with a sharp HA peak. By EM this band was found to consist of typical virions (Fig. 6A, B) . The bromelintreated virus banded in the 1.15 g/cm3 region of the gradient; by EM this band contained completely "despiked" but fully enveloped virus particles (Fig. 6C-E) . All biological activity was lost by the enzyme treatment (Table 3 ). The repurified virus control, the purified "despiked" particles, and the comparable area from the gradient purification of the bromelin control sample were examined by PAGE. Polypeptides 2 and 6-both glycoproteins-were absent in the bromelin-treated sample (Fig. 7) . Sedimentation coeficient and molecular weight of vi&n. Analytical ultracentrifugation of intact, purified virus (HA titer 2.6 X 105) at 15, 16, and 18,000 rpm revealed a single distinct peak with a sedimentation coefficient (sz~,~) of 368 =t 14 X lo-l3 sec. Corrections for solvent density and viscosity and for partial specific volume of the virus resulted in an S;,,, value of 380 f 15 S. The virus concentration was extrapolated to infinite dilution from the data of Burness and Clothier (1970) to give a fully corrected sedimentation coefficient (X,",,,) of approximately 390 + 16 S. The apparent molecular weight (Il!UV,) was calculated to be 112 & 5 X lo6 daltons, so that the particle weight of one OC 43 virion is approximately I8 =t 1. x lo-l7 g.
