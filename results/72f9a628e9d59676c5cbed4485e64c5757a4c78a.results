The HA and NA ML phylogenetic trees (with and without the additional, down-loaded contemporary sequences from publicly available archives) produced in this study are too large to include as separate figures in this paper and have been published as online Supporting Information in a scrollable PDF format for further inspection on the PLoS ONE journal website (http://www. plosone.org/home.action). For each of these trees, certain clusters of interest have been highlighted using annotated red boxes or ellipses, and will be specifically referred to, in the following text for further description and discussion. All of these 281 Hong Kong influenza A(H3N2) HA and NA sequences have been deposited on GenBank (Accession nos.: EU856814-EU857094 for HA, and EU857095-EU857375 for NA sequences). Figures S1 and S2 show the relationship between the 281 HA and NA sequences for the Hong Kong influenza A(H3N2) samples and 4 World Health Organization (WHO) influenza A(H3N2) vaccine strain HA sequences (Syd/5/97, Mos/10/99, Fuj/411/02 and Cal/7/04). These Hong Kong HA and NA sequences were inspected to determine if there were any sequences from consecutive influenza seasons occurring on the same branch, indicating that viruses with the same or very similar HA and NA gene sequences were occurring in adjacent influenza seasons. This would suggest that that particular virus carrying this gene may have remained 'latent' in that population, to re-emerge in the same population the following season. One example of such possible viral persistence between influenza seasons was found, with HA and NA sequences from the same viruses (5251Jan02 and 5267Jan03, as indicated in Figures S1 and S2 for the HA and NA phylogenetic trees, respectively), showing a similar clustering pattern for both these genes, separated by at least one year. Interestingly, the HA sequence from sample 5250Jan02 clusters closely with those from samples 5251Jan02 and 5267Jan03 (Figures S1 and S3), but its NA sequence lies some distance away on a separate branch (Figures S2 and S4 ). This may suggest a possible reassortment event, either with its HA or NA gene segment. Further full genome sequencing and analysis may resolve this issue. The The relationship between the WHO vaccine HA and NA sequences and those from Hong Kong and elsewhere can be seen even more clearly in Figures S3 and S4 when the 315 JCVI sequences are added to each tree. Although these contemporary JCVI sequences are mainly drawn from just three additional locations, they still represent the Northern hemisphere (New York, USA) and the Southern hemisphere (Western Australia and various locations in New Zealand). Again, for reference, the January Hong Kong HA and NA sequences from each year are again highlighted in red boxes. In addition, in Figures S3 and S4 , red ellipses have been added to show where similar HA and NA sequences from other, non-Hong Kong locations have clustered with Hong Kong sequences on the same branch. The dates of such sequences may be the same (within the limit of the one month temporal resolution used in this study), relatively similar, or very different. These highlighted clusters serve to demonstrate the mobility and ubiquity of this influenza A(H3N2) virus, worldwide, during this 10-year period, i.e. genetically similar viruses can appear in different parts of the world at similar and also different times. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive and other such examples may be found in these trees. These number and position of the clusters indicated by the red ellipses differ between Figure S3 (HA sequences) and Figure S4 (NA sequences) probably because there are different selection pressures acting on these two genes as they have quite different functions (i.e. the HA protein is used by the virus to bind to the host cell for entry, whereas the NA protein is an enzyme that enables new progeny viruses to leave the host cell). Also, in Figures 3 and 4 , for both the HA and NA gene sequences, respectively, there is a large region of transition between Mos/10/99-like and Fuj/411/02-like viruses, containing sequences collected during 1999-2005.
