Memory T-cell response specific for SARS-CoV N protein persists for 2 years after recovery To identify memory T-cell response to N protein after SARS-CoV infection in humans, PBMCs from seven individuals who had fully recovered from SARS 2 years after infection were stimulated with a pool of 57 peptides spanning the entire amino acid sequence of the N protein in vitro for 72 h. The culture supernatants were collected for detection of IFN-γ by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1A , although the level of IFN-γ varied from donor to donor (ranged from 54 to 230 pg/ml), all of SARSrecovered donors were capable of producing IFN-γ in response to N peptides. However, the levels of IFN-γin normal individuals were less than 25 pg/ml. Next, we determined the frequency of N-protein-specific T cells by using IFN-γ ELIspot assay. Fig. 1B showed that the PBMCs from all of the 11 SARS-recovered individuals tested displayed significantly higher frequency of IFN-γ-producing cells than those from normal donors after stimulation with a pool of N peptides. The frequency of IFN-γ-producing cells from SARS-recovered individuals was at 63 SFC/million PBMCs, with a range of 10-178 SFC/million PBMCs. It is also noticed that there was no obvious difference in the frequencies of IFN-γ-producing T cells of the SARS donors and normal controls when PBMCs were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the N protein of SARS-CoV was highly immunogenic and N-protein-specific T-cell responses could persist at least for 2 years after SARS-CoV infection.
