Generation and characterization of HAd vector expressing HA and NP of H5N1 influenza virus (HAd-HA-NP) The full coding region of HA under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter and bovine growth hormone (BGH) polyadenylation signal (polyA) and full length coding region of NP gene of the A/Vietnam/1203/04 virus under the control of the murine CMV promoter and the simian virus 40 (SV40) polyA were inserted into early region 1 (E1) of the HAd genome using the Cre-recombinase-mediated site-specific recombination system [20] . Both genes in HAd-HA-NP were in the E1-parallel orientation. The recombinant vector, HAd-HA-NP ( Figure 1A ) showed visible cytopathic effect (c.p.e.) on the ninth day post-transfection. Western blot analysis was done to confirm the expression of HA and NP in 293 cells. Two distinct polypeptide bands of approximate molecular weights 77 kDa and 50 kDa, representing the HA precursor (HA0) and a proteolytic cleavage product (HA1), respectively, ( Figure 1B) were observed in the HAd-HA-NP infected 293 cell lysate. A single band at approximate molecular weight of 56 kDa representing NP ( Figure 1C ) was visible in the HAd-HA-NP infected 293 cell lysate.
