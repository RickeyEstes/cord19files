We were able to identify 109 publications that reported the data for any coinfections (Fig. 1 , Additional file 1: Table S1 ). The full text of 104 publications were available out of which 48 were cross sectional studies, 37 were case reports, 13 were retrospective analysis, 5 were prospective studies and 1 surveillance report . 49 (118) were reported from Bo, Sierra Leone. Most cases of coinfections were reported from South Asia (52), primarily from India, followed by Africa (25), South-east Asia (16) , South America (15), Caribbean (3) and Middle East (2) . Two studies from North America reported coinfections of Dengue/Chikungunya in returning travellers without identifying the location where coinfections occurred. Malaria/Dengue coinfections were reported from 44 unique locations spread across 20 different countries (Fig. 2) . Dengue/Chikungunya coinfections were reported from 48 unique locations spread across 26 countries (Fig. 3 ). 5 countries from African continent and India reported cases of Malaria/Chikungunya coinfections (Fig. 4) . Cases of Malaria/Dengue/Chikungunya coinfections were reported from India, Sierra Leone and Nigeria (Fig. 5) . Seven countries reported infection in returning travellers (Fig. 6 ). Based upon cross sectional studies Malaria/ Dengue prevalence varied widely, ranging between 0.1-23% from south Asia, 0.01-9% from Africa, 0.5-2.5% from Southeast Asia and 1-3% from South America. The frequency of Dengue/Chikungunya coinfections ranged from 1 to 25% from South Asia, 1-20% from Africa, 1-32% from Caribbean, 1-
