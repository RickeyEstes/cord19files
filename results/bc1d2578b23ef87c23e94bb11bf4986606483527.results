The system of ordinary differential equations given by (6) is a linear system with constant coefficients. Beginning with the initial condition 1 , 2 , 3 = 0 for all combinations of 1 , 2 , and 3 other than , , = 1, the total probability in each final state of the system as → ∞ can be computed as the sum of the probability of arriving at each final (i.e., absorbing) state along each possible path to that state. For simplicity of discussion, we use the conventional names Alice, Bob, and Charlie for persons 1, 2, and 3, respectively; these widely used conventional names have no other significance (e.g. [68] ). We computed the total infection probability for each person, assuming that the epidemic begins with Alice exposed. Not all of the total 343 system states are ultimately reachable from the initial condition (assuming > 0 for , = 1, 2, 3 and ̸ = ). We will ignore boundary cases corresponding to no infection, recovery, investigation, and progression; we always assume > 0, > 0, > 0, and > 0. Equation (6) The transition rates from each state of the system to each other state of the entire system constitute the generator of the system. We let ℓ be the transition rate to state ℓ from state ; = 0 for all . We then define the usual jump chain [69] associated with the continuous time Markov chain defined by , that is, a discrete time Markov chain which corresponds to the sequence of state transitions. The set of states may be divided into transient states and absorbing states, and we will arrange the states such that (1) the initial state ( , , ) is first and (2) if ℓ > 0, state comes before state ℓ. The absorbing states therefore come last. The probability matrix for the jump chain can then be written in partitioned form where the leading block K corresponds to all the transient states of the system and A to transitions from the transient states to the absorbing set. The probability that the system enters an absorbing state ℓ given being in any transient state initially is then A(I − K) −1 . Since (I − K) −1 = I + K + K 2 + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , the expression (I − K) −1 can be interpreted as a sum over all possible paths from the initial state to the penultimate transient state; A(I − K) −1 is then the sum over all paths from the initial state to the absorbing state. It can be shown that K is acyclic. In practice, we expressed the elements of the jump matrix J as symbolic expressions, represented by clauses in a Prolog knowledge base (http://www.swi-prolog.org/, v. 6.2.6 for Macintosh). This was then used to enumerate all possible sequences of system states, together with the conditional probabilities that the system would undergo a transition to the next state in the sequence given the current state. This computation was conducted for each of the 64 strategy choices of the three players (not each strategy choice corresponds to the same list of absorbing states for the model; when there is no disclosure, for instance, states such as ( , , ) cannot be reached). Finally, algebraic simplification of the resulting path probabilities was performed using the computer mathematics packages Sage (http://www.sagemath.org/, v. 5.0 for Macintosh) and Form (http://www.nikhef.nl/∼form/maindir/, v. 4.0). These were checked using numerical integration using the package deSolve for R (http://www.r-project.org/, v. 3.0.1 for Macintosh). For each strategy choice of all three individuals, we determined the probability that person 3 (Charlie) was infected. Assuming fixed strategies for the other two individuals, how does the infection probability for Charlie change if he chooses to disclose other individuals? The results are summarized in Table 1 . A similar table can be written for the second individual (Bob, not shown). Equations (19)- (22) provide analytic expressions for the change in infection probability experienced by person 3 (Charlie) for each combination of disclosure choices made (as given in Table 1 ). Using these infection probabilities, we can compute the expected benefits as well as costs experienced by each person. These costs and benefits depend on the choices made by each person in the group and can be used to compute the payoff for each player and therefore the solution to the game 1 = 4 2 2 2 (( + ) ( + ) ( + 2 ) × ( + 2 + 2 ) ( + 2 + 2 ) × ( + 2 + 2 ) ( + 2 + 2 + 2 )) −1 Table 1 : Reduction in infection for Charlie due to disclosures by Charlie, assuming given strategies for the other two individuals. For each row, Alice is assumed to disclose either Bob or Charlie or both, as indicated in the first two columns; Bob is assumed to disclose either Alice or Charlie or both, as given in the next two columns. The next column (Alice versus none) shows how much the infection probability for Charlie is reduced by disclosing Alice instead of disclosing no one. The column labeled "Bob versus none" shows the reduction by disclosing Bob instead of no one and so forth. Analytic expressions for the quantities 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 are given in the text.  × (( + ) ( + ) 2 ( + ) ( + 2 ) ( + + ) × ( + 2 + 2 ) ( + 2 + 2 ) ( + 2 + 2 ) Here, 0 = 4 ( 3 + 2 2 + 2 2 + 2 2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 2 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 2 + 2 + 4 2 + 6 + 2 + 2 3 + 4 2 + 2 2 ) , 1 = 4 ( 2 + + ( + 2 + 2 + 2 ) + ( + 4 + 3 ) + 2 2 + 3 + 2 ) , 2 = 2 (2 + + + 2 + + ) , and 3 = .
