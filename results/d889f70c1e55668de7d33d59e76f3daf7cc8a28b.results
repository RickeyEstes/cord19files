We previously reported a high prevalence of S. brasiliensis in feline sporotrichosis outbreaks [8, 9, 20] . Based on this information, the main goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the presence and diversity of serum-derived antibodies against S. brasiliensis antigens in naturally infected cats. Further, we previously proposed the existence of a convergent humoral response in human sporotrichosis against antigens from S. brasiliensis, S. schenckii, and S. globosa [45] . To establish whether S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii express different antigens, we assessed whole cellular protein extracts from two strains of S. brasiliensis plus two strains of S. schenckii s. str. that were previously characterized by molecular [8, 9, 25, 54] and serological [3, [44] [45] [46] [47] methods. Remarkably, and in support of our hypothesis that immunological distance increases with phylogenetic distance, sera from these cats reacted similarly, with no significant differences in titer between ELISA plates coated with proteins from S. brasiliensis or S. schenckii (Fig 1) . ELISA . Further information about ELISA statistics appears in S1 Table. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0004016.g001 S. schenckii CBS 132984, median 1.028 OD, 95% CI 1.027-1.294 OD (S1 Table) . When using the assay to diagnosis cats with sporotrichosis, the area under the ROC curve was 1.0 (95% CI 0.94-1.000; P<0.0001; Fig 2) , indicating excellent performance. The control group of 19 non-Sporothrix infected animals was associated with lower medians and smaller ranges: S. brasiliensis CBS 132990, median 0.2640 OD, 95% CI 0.2592-0.3098 OD; S. brasiliensis CBS 132021, median 0.2590 OD, 95% CI 0.2517-0.2942 OD; S. schenckii CBS 132974, median 0.2730 OD, 95% CI 0.2512-0.3136 OD; and S. schenckii CBS 132984, median 0.2670 OD, 95% CI 0.2567-0.2907 OD (S1 Table) . Differences between the absorbance values for the infected and noninfected groups were statistically significant (P<0.0001). Sera from cats with other infections were non-reactive. Similar cutoff values yielded 100% specificity and sensitivity: S. brasiliensis CBS 132990, 0.377 OD; S. brasiliensis CBS 132021, 0.363 OD; S. schenckii CBS 132974, 0.407 OD; and S. schenckii CBS 132984, 0.346 OD (S1 Fig). ELISA results showed very good agreement for the antigens assayed (kappa = 1.0). To diagnosis feline sporotrichosis via ELISA, we recommend the use of antigen preparations of S. brasiliensis, since this is the most prevalent species in feline sporotrichosis outbreaks. Antigen diversity was assayed with 1D immunoblots using the four antigen preparations of S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii tested via ELISA. Proteins extracts were evaluated according to the amount of protein extracted, the diversity of bands, the integrity of the samples, and the reproducibility of extraction. Approximately 2 Î¼g of Sporothrix yeast whole-cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE; silver staining revealed numerous proteins ranging from 10 kDa to 160 kDa in size, with different intensities. The Tris-Ca 2+ extraction protocol [45, 47] was suitable for the study of Sporothrix antigenic molecules during feline sporotrichosis, yielding samples with high amounts of protein and no degradation. As expected, antibodies from cats with sporotrichosis reacted with a wide variety of S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii proteins 20kDa to >160kDa in size (Fig 3) . Cat-to-cat variation resulted in characteristic banding patterns for each animal (Fig 3) ; supporting the hypothesis that in a genetically diverse population, the antibody repertoire is expected to vary among individual cats. On the other hand, we detected minor or no differences in IgG-reacting banding patterns between antigen preparations (Fig 3) , consistent with the close genetic distance between S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii [8, 9] . Despite this variation, all cats produced antibodies against a 60-kDa molecule in the S. brasiliensis proteome and a 70-kDa molecule in the S. schenckii proteome. The major antigenic S. brasiliensis molecules (CBS 132990 and CBS 132021) recognized by feline IgG consisted of the following sizes: 60 kDa (100% and 100%, respectively), 90 kDa (92% and 92%, respectively), 100 kDa (86% and 86%, respectively), 38 kDa (60% and 56%, respectively), 40 kDa (56% and 58%, respectively), 45 kDa (44% and 42%, respectively), 30 kDa (36% and 26%, respectively), 52 kDa (30% and 32%, respectively), and 110 kDa (28% and 30%, respectively) (Fig 4A and 4C ). Minor molecules recognized by feline IgG had sizes of 80 kDa, 25 kDa, 28 kDa, 120 kDa, 160 kDa, 35 kDa, 20 kDa, 55 kDa, 85 kDa, and 23 kDa (Fig  4A and 4C) . The major antigenic S. schenckii molecules (CBS 132974 and CBS 132984) recognized by feline IgG had sizes of: 70 kDa (100% and 100%, respectively), 90 kDa (86% and 88%, Table. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0004016.g004 respectively), 100 kDa (76% and 82%, respectively), 38 kDa (74% and 62%, respectively), 40 kDa (64% and 56%, respectively), 52 kDa (58% and 56%, respectively), 30 kDa (50% and 34%, respectively), 55 kDa (48% and 48%, respectively), and 45 kDa (40% and 30%, respectively) (Fig 4B and 4D) . The minor S. schenckii molecules recognized by feline IgG had sizes of 25 kDa, 80 kDa, 28 kDa, 110 kDa, 120 kDa, 23 kDa, 35 kDa, 160 kDa, 85 kDa, and 20 kDa (Fig 4B  and 4D ). Sera from uninfected cats did not react with S. brasiliensis or S. schenckii antigens. Sera from cats with other infections were also non-reactive in the immunoblot assay. The frequencies at which Sporothrix molecules were recognized in the antigen preparations are presented in S2 Table. There was no association between the number of bands recognized by each serum and the distribution and number of skin lesions on cats with sporotrichosis. We previously reported that the 60-kDa and 70-kDa proteins in S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii, respectively, are related to virulence profiles and are the main antigenic molecules during murine [3] and human [45] sporotrichosis. We also determined that this protein undergoes post-translational modification and is present as isoforms and glycoforms in the S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii proteomes [45] . We therefore investigated whether antibodies present in cat sera recognize all six isoforms in the S. brasiliensis proteome, as previously shown with human antibodies [45] . S. brasiliensis proteins were therefore resolved via 2D electrophoresis and immunoblotted with pooled sera from cats with sporotrichosis (n = 10) and optimal antibody titers according to ELISA. Serum-derived antibodies in naturally infected cats mainly recognized all six isoforms of gp60 (Fig 5) . The present results confirm that S. brasiliensis 3carboxymuconate cyclase is a highly polymorphic protein [45] with sizes of 55-62 kDa and with isoelectric points of 4.45-4.80. 2D immunoblotting revealed less diversity and more weakly reacting spots than 1D immunoblotting, perhaps due to protein loss during sample preparation for 2D electrophoresis (compared to the crude extracts used in 1D immunoblotting and ELISA) and serum dilution during pooling.
