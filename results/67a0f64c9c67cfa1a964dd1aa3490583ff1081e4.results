Distribution and univariable analysis outcomes of risk factors extracted from the questionnaire are presented in Table 1 . In the univariable step, 5 factors were significantly related to the likelihood of diarrhoea within the first 14 days after birth (P < 0.20). In the multivariable model, no significant associations (P < 0.05) remained for any of these factors. The percentage of scouring calves during the study was significantly lower in the treated herds (14.3%) compared to the control herds (39.7%) (OR = 0.26, P < 0.01, Table 3 ). No statistically significant difference in the duration of diarrhoea was present between calves of treated and control herds (HR = 0.91; 95% CI [0.57-1.48]; P = 0.71, Table 3 ). Also the odds of mortality were not statistically significant (OR = 0.30, 95% CI [0.06-1.59], P = 0.16, Table 3 ). Calves of treated herds showed a significantly lower risk of C. parvum shedding at the end of the study compared to the start of the study (11% versus 46%, P < 0.001, Table 4 ). This risk at the end of the study was also significantly reduced compared to calves of control herds (11% versus 34%, P < 0.001, Table 4 ). Occurrence of coronavirus increased significantly (P < 0.05, Table 4 ) during the study period in both groups; no significant differences existed between groups regarding the occurrence of E. coli and rotavirus (Table 4) . Calves from both treated and control herds received on average 1.9 (range 0.0-6.0) litres of colostrum at the first colostrum feeding. The average time until a newborn calf received its first colostrum was 2.9 h (range 0.1-20.0) on control herds and 2.0 h (range 0.1-10.5) on treated herds. Within the first 6 h after birth, a calf received on average 1.8 ± 1.1 and 2.2 ± 1.2 litre on control and treated herds, respectively. These differences were not significant. Colostral quality was significantly lower (P < 0.05) on control herds (average 79 g IgG/L; range 1-187) compared to treated herds (average 90 g IgG/L; range 2-241). No significant differences were present between both groups regarding FPT 10 and FPT 15 (Table 4 ). The percentage of scouring calves did not significantly differ between calves receiving at least 200 g IgG or less within the first 12 h after birth (P = 0.59, Table 3 ) nor between calves receiving colostrum of inferior quality compared to calves receiving high quality colostrum (P = 0.42, Table 3 ).
