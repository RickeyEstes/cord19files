3.1. Highly conserved putative G-quadruplex forming sequences are present in repetitive regions of the HSV-1 genome We identified nine regions in the HSV-1 genome with highly repeated putative QGRS (Quadruplex forming G-Rich Sequences) ( Table 1) . Six of them (named gp054a-f) were found in the leading strand of the gp054 gene ( Fig. 1b) which encodes UL36, the largest viral protein and essential viral tegument component (McNabb and Courtney, 1992) (Table 1 ). The gp054 series sequences displayed the G 4 XTG 4 XTG 4 XTG 4 XT common motif, where X was either a T or a C base, and covered about 220 bps. Four more putative QGRS were clustered at the terminal and internal repeats (both long and short) (Fig. 1b, Table 1 ): they covered about 900 bps in the leading strand and 700 bps in the lagging strand. The exact role of these regions is as yet unknown and thus these positions were named ''un''. All identified sequences were highly conserved among different HSV-1 strains ( Table 1 ). The only exception was the unb sequence, which was identical to gp054b, and was not conserved in the KOS strain. To note that all identified sequences, apart from un3, were characterized by four GGGG-tracts, therefore possessing the ability to fold into 4-tetrad stacked G-quadruplex. This kind of tetraplex is in principle very stable, as denoted by the high G-scores, which indicate the propensity of a sequence to fold into unimolecular G-quadruplex, obtained by these oligonucleotides (Table 1 ). The un3 sequence displayed four GGG-tracts therefore gaining a lower G-score.
