A total of 1441 nurses and doctors in 15 Beijing hospitals were recruited into the randomized arms and 481 nurses and doctors in nine hospitals were recruited into the convenience no-mask group. Figure 1 shows the recruitment process. The distribution of demographic variables was generally similar between arms (Table 1) , but was significantly different for anyone smoking in the family, four or more people in family, four or more adults in family, influenza vaccination in 2008 and 2007, public transport, handwashing, hospital level and high-risk procedures. In regards to hand hygiene, 83% (382 ⁄ 461), 87AE8% (428 ⁄ 488) and 88AE6% (435 ⁄ 492) of participants from the N95 fit test arm, N95 non-fit test arm and medical mask arm stated that they washed their hands between patients, respectively. For all outcomes, non-fit-tested N95 respirators had lower rates of infections compared to fit-tested N95s (for all N95 versus medical masks, the rates were 3AE9% versus 6AE7% for CRI, 0AE3% versus 0AE6% for ILI, 1AE4% versus 2AE6% for laboratory-confirmed virus and 0AE3% versus 1% for influenza) but these differences were not significant. All infection outcomes were consistently higher (approximately double) in the medical mask group compared to the N95 group ( Figure 2 ). There were no cases of influenza in the non-fit-tested N95 arm, three in the fit-tested N95 arm and five in the medical mask arm. After adjustment for clustering, non-fit-tested N95 masks were significantly protective compared to medical masks against CRI, but other outcomes were not significant between N95 and medical masks ( Table 2) . When compared to the convenience no-mask group and adjusted for clustering, N95 non-fit-tested was significantly protective against CRI, and all N95 was protective against laboratory-confirmed virus and laboratoryconfirmed influenza (Table 3 ). In a post hoc analysis carried out to adjust for potential confounders which were unevenly distributed between arms, all N95 and hospital level remained significant for CRI and laboratory-confirmed viral infection, but handwashing, vaccination and high-risk procedures were not significant (Table 4) . Fit-testing failure rate was very low (5 ⁄ 461, 1AE08%). Rates of adherence in all arms of the study were high (Figure 3 ). Table 5 shows adverse events associated with medical mask or N95 use, and that N95 respirators were associated with higher rates of adverse events. Adherence with mask or respirator wearing was high and not significantly different in all arms, with 74% adherence (95% CI 70-78%) in the N95 fit-tested arm, 68% in the N95 nonfit-tested arm (95% CI 64-73%) and 76% in the medical mask arm (95% CI 72-79%). The duration of mask wearing in these arms, respectively, was 5AE2 hours (95% CI 5AE1-5AE4 hours), 4AE9 hours (95% CI 4AE8-5AE1 hours) and 5 hours (95% CI 4AE9-5AE2 hours; Figure 3 ).
