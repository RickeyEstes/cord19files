Sugar-vanilla flavor was selected first the least frequently, and dog food flavor was selected first the most frequently overall (Table 1) . Type 3 tests of fixed effects showed an overall treatment effect (F 6,72 ¼ 9.74, P < 0.0001). Sugar-vanilla and dog food flavors were selected least (F 1,72 ¼ 22.46, P < 0.0001) and most (F 1,72 ¼ 13.09, P ¼ 0.0005) frequently, respectively, when compared with all other flavors combined. Pairwise comparisons using sugar-vanilla as the reference flavor indicate no difference in preference between sugar-vanilla and peanut butter (F 1,72 ¼ 3.96, P ¼ 0.051) or hazelnut (F 1,72 ¼ 0.44, P ¼ 0.509; Table 2 ). Using the most frequently selected flavor (dog food) as the reference flavor, we found no difference in preference between dog food and bacon, cheese, or sardine flavors. Sugar-vanilla flavor was least preferred (Table 3) .
