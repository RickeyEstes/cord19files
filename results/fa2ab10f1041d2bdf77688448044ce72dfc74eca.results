The detection sensitivity was the highest for GBS [lower limit of detection (LoD) of 5 genomes/mL] and the lowest for HI (LoD of 57 genomes/mL). The LoDs for HEV, EBV, VZV, HSV-2, HHV-6, NM, CMV, SP, HSV-1, and LM were 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 16, 19, 38, and 51 genomes/mL, respectively. The analytical sensi-tivities for all the 12 target pathogens were higher than the 100 copies per reaction stated by the manufacturer. No cross-reaction was evident with human genomic DNA and other reference strains. The Seeplex Meningitis-V2 ACE Detection kit successfully differentiated all the 19 HEV species from the other strains. CSF samples were obtained from 78 patients at the time of diagnosis of active meningitis and before administration of antibiotic treatment. Among these samples, 44 (56.4%) yielded positive results with the Seeplex kit (Table 3 ). Five cases (6.4%) showed positive results for HEV (4) and HSV-1 (1), which were consistent with the results of conventional studies. However, in 2 cases the results were not consistent with the results of conventional studies. One was positive for both LM and EBV in Seeplex Meningitis ACE detection kit, but positive only for LM in the conventional study; the other tested positive for HEV in Seeplex Meningitis ACE detection kit but positive for VZV in the conventional study. Each case presented a bacterial and a viral features, respectively in CSF analysis. The Seeplex Meningitis ACE detection kit detected causative pathogens for 37 cases (47.4%) that tested negative in the conventional studies. Two patients had single bacterial infection with GBS and LM, and CSF analysis revealed bacterial and undetermined features, respectively. Single viral infections were evident in 16 patients with HEV, 9 with VZV, 3 with HSV-1, and 1 each with HSV-2 and EBV. All the cases with positive results for viruses showed viral or undetermined features in CSF analysis. Five patients showed simultaneous infection with 2 bacterial or viral pathogens: 2 tested positive for both SP and HEV and 1 each tested positive for SP and HSV-1, SP and VZV, and EBV and HSV-1. One of the cases positive for both SP and HEV had CSF findings compatible with bacterial meningitis, while the others had features consistent of viral meningitis, with lymphocyte dominance and high glucose level. Sequencing of amplicons showed no evidence of false-positive cross-reactivity; the rates of BLAST match were 98-100%. CSF samples obtained from the remaining 34 patients did not test positive with the Seeplex kit. Sequential work-up with conventional studies showed that 1 patient each was infected with EBV, VZV, SP, HEV, and HSV-1 and had consistent CSF findings. The pathogenic agents in the other 29 patients could not be identified, although CSF analysis indicated that 6 had bacterial infection, 13 had viral infection, and the remaining 10 had indeterminate findings. None of the control cases showed false-positive results.
