Interviewed family caregivers mentioned that they were present 24 hours a day at the patient's ward. The family caregivers provided bedside nursing, cleaning care, and psychologic support while patients were hospitalized (Table 2 ). Almost all the family caregivers in the pediatric wards were women, whereas the caregivers in the male medicine wards included both men and women. During the study, the team observed 2,065 episodes of caregiving, 75% (1,544) of which involved direct care ( Table 2) .
