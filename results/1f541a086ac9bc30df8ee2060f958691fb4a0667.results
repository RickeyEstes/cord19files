The study included 115 male subjects. The age and the smoking history in the resistant smokers group and COPD patients group were matched without significant differences ( Table I) . The mean values of the post-bronchodilator FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC and FEF25/75% of predicted in COPD patients group were 47.3%, 59.0% and 29.2%, respectively. They were significantly lower than in non-smokers (86.6%, 85.4% and 81.8%, respectively) and resistant smokers (93.1%, 87.7% and 84.4%, respectively) with value of p < 0.0001 (Table II) . The mean values of the post-bronchodilator FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC and FEF25/75% of predicted negatively correlated with age in COPD patients (p < 0.05, p < 0.005 and p < 0.05, respectively). Additionally, the mean values of the post-bronchodilator FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC% of predicted negatively correlated with their smoking history (p < 0.01 and p < 0.005, respectively) ( Table III) . As regards the adenovirus C gene, it was identified in all subjects of the study (Figure 1 ). The genotype distribution of the TNF-α -308 G/A polymorphism was heterozygous in 13 cases and homozygous A in 102 cases. The frequency of the homozygous A genotype was 90.6% of COPD, 86.7% of non-smokers and 84% of resistant smokers, with no statistical significant difference between the 3 groups. Homozygous G genotype was not detected in any of our subjects (Table IV, Figure 2 ). The genotype distribution of the SP-B +1580 C/T polymorphism showed that the resistant smokers had a significantly higher frequency of homozygous T than either COPD patients or non-smokers (p = 0.0050). However, homozygous C genotype frequency was higher in COPD patients than in either resistant smokers or non-smokers, p = 0.005 (Table IV, Figure 3) . Meanwhile, the genotype distribution of the IL-13 -1055 C/T polymorphism showed no signifi-cant difference between the studied groups although there was a high frequency of the homozygous T genotype in COPD patients (20%) compared to the resistant smokers (2.8%) and nonsmokers (6.7%) (Table IV, Figure 4 ). Figure 5 shows the frequencies of different genotypes in different studied groups. The post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC% of predicted was significantly decreased in TNF-α homozygous A genotype (86.75) compared to heterozygous G/A genotype (93.0%) in resistant smokers (p < 0.05) ( Table V) . In COPD patients, there was a statistically significant decrease in the mean values of the postbronchodilator FEV 1 (Table VI) . Meanwhile, the mean values of the post-bronchodilator FEF25/75% of predicted was significantly decreased in IL-13 homozygous T and C/T genotypes (17.1% and 27.4%, respectively) compared to homozygous C genotype (37.6%), p = 0.001 (Table VII) .
