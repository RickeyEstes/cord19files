A total of 103 gene segments from the 35 virus strains were analyzed (35 HA, 35 NA and 33M). Nucleotide and amino acid sequences for the 3 selected genes were compared within the Cameroon virus strains and with the WHO vaccine strains, WHO reference strains and available sequences of other African virus strains.
