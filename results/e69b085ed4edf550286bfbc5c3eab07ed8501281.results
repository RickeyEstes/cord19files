Structural Characterization of S9-3-37 S9-3-37 is a group 1-specific bnAb that was isolated from healthy volunteers who were vaccinated with the H5N1 prepandemic vaccine (Yamayoshi et al., 2018) . S9-3-37 uses the V H 1-18 and V k 2-24 heavy-and light-chain V genes, respectively ( Figure S1A -B), and binds to group 1 HAs with high affinity, but with no detectable binding to group 2 HAs (Table 1) . Here, we determined the crystal structure of S9-3-37 Fab in complex with the HA from an H5N1 strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (Viet04) to 2.9 Å resolution (Table S1; Figure S2 ). S9-3-7 binds to the HA stem region ( Figure 1A) , and one structural feature that immediately stands out is the extensive contact of CDR H3 with the stem region ( Figure 1B) . The overall conformation of CDR H3 of S9-3-37 at the HA-Fab interface is remarkably similar to that of CDR H3 of FI6v3 (Corti et al., 2011). Moreover, the molecular interactions attributable to the D gene segment are almost identical between S9-3-37 and FI6v3. While S9-3-37 and FI6v3 utilize different V H and J gene segments, they both utilize the D3-9 gene segment and have a relatively long CDR H3 ( Figure S1C ). CDR H3 of FI6v3 is 20 residues, whereas that of S9-3-37 is 21 residues (Kabat numbering). Interestingly, despite the similarity in the conformation of CDR H3, the overall orientations of S9-3-37 and FI6v3 are very different ( Figure 1A ). When bound to HA, S9-3-37 adopts an $180 rotation relative to FI6v3, such that the positions of the heavy chain and light chain are swapped compared to FI6v3 with respect to their interaction with the HA stem epitope. To understand the difference in the HA binding orientation of S9-3-37 and FI6v3, structural alignments between their variable domains of heavy chains (V H ) were performed. When their D gene-encoded regions are superimposed, the base of their CDR H3s twist with respect to each other (Figure 1C) . When their V H framework regions are aligned, the CDR H3 loops of S9-3-37 and FI6v3 point in opposite directions (Figure 1D) . Together, our structural analysis reveals that the S9-3-37 and FI6v3 antibodies engage the HA stem surface in very different overall orientations and angles of approach, but nevertheless still have very similar CDR H3 conformations, especially for the residues that are important for engaging the conserved HA stem epitope. Paratope Analysis Reveals the Importance of D3-9 in Binding Next, we compared the paratopes of S9-3-37 and FI6v3 and computed the buried surface areas (BSAs) in the S9-3-37-HA complex and FI6v3-HA complex (PDB 3TZN) (Corti et al., 2011) (see STAR Methods). The paratope of S9-3-37 is dominated by CDR H3, similar to FI6v3 (Figures 2A and 2B ) (Corti et al., 2011) , and only one framework residue interacts with the HA (V L Asp1 hydrogen bonds with HA1 Asn289 glycan; Figure S3A ). The total BSA on S9-3-37 is 910 Å 2 (868 Å 2 from the heavy chain and 42 Å 2 from the light chain), with 83% (756 Å 2 ) attributable to CDR H3. In comparison, the total BSA on FI6v3 is 903 Å 2 (714 Å 2 from the heavy chain and 189 Å 2 from the light chain), with 71% (638 Å 2 ) from CDR H3. Similarly, the BSA on the HA is comparable in the S9-3-37-HA complex (832 Å 2 ) and FI6v3-HA complex (817 Å 2 ). Thus, binding of S9-3-37 to the HA is dominated by the relatively long CDR H3, which is similar to that of FI6v3. In CDR H3 of S9-3-37, the D3-9 gene encodes for seven residues 100b LGYFDWL 100h ( Figures 2C and S1C ). With the exception of Gly100c and Asp100f, the other five hydrophobic residues (Leu100b, Tyr100d, Phe100e, Trp100g, and Leu100h) all interact with the HA stem. Of note, all of these five contacting residues are encoded by the germline D3-9, and therefore, none arise from somatic mutations. The buried surface area of this D3-9-encoded region is 495 Å 2 ( Figure 2D ), which accounts for 54% of the total BSA of S9-3-37. This observation further highlights the importance of the D3-9 gene segment in binding to the HA stem.
