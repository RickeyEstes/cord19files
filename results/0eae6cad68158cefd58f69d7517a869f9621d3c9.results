During the study, sites recorded 234,221 ED visits of which 43,567 (18.6%) patients had fever or reported fever (Fig 1) . Enrollment was offered to 11,505 AFI case-patients, and 10,039 (87.3%) gave their consent/assent to participate. However, 1,043 (10.4%) of those enrolled withdrew from the study or were withdrawn due to noncompliance with study enrollment procedures. Of the remaining 8,996 participants, 2,999 (33.3%) had follow-up forms completed and 24.9% had follow-up specimens collected. Half (50.3%) of the 8,996 participants were female, and the median age was 12.8 years (range 0-103) ( Table 1 ). One-third (33.7%) of participants reported having a chronic medical condition; a higher proportion of participants enrolled in the first year reported a co-morbidity than those enrolled in subsequent years. The most common co-morbid conditions were asthma (18.6%), high blood pressure (10.7%), diabetes (7.5%), high cholesterol (4.7%), coronary heart disease (4.4%), and thyroid disease (4.2%). Participants resided in 49 of the 78 municipalities in Puerto Rico; however, most (76.3%) were residents of five municipalities: Ponce (43.0%), Guayama (15.6%), Juana DÃ­az (8.2%), Salinas (4.9%), and Villalba (4.6%).
