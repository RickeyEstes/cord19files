Between 2017 and 2018, a total of 665 nasal swabs were collected through active surveillance of imported and local camels (520 from imported camels and 145 from local camels). Out of the 665 tested samples, 11 samples (1.7 %) were positive for influenza A virus by RT-PCR (Table 1) . Viral RNA was detected only in imported camels from Sudan (4 samples) and Djibouti (7 samples) but not local animals (Table 1 ). Viral RNA was detected in both male (8 samples) and female (3 samples) camels as well as from juvenile camels between 1 to 2 years (6 samples) and those older than 4 years (5 samples) ( Table 2) . Viruses could not be isolated from any of the positive samples in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells even after 3 consecutive passages most probably due to the low viral load as shown by the high Ct values, which varied from 34.95 to 39.81 (Table 2) . These results were confirmed for 5 samples by conventional RT-PCR using the same primers used in the real-time RT-PCR targeting a conserved ~100 bp fragment in the M gene of all influenza A viruses. Query BLASTn of the obtained partial sequences of the fragments from these 5 specimens further confirmed these results with >97% sequence identity with at least 1 or 2 mismatches to multiple influenza A viruses subtypes (Supplementary  Table S1 ). This analysis did not result in any definitive determination of the circulating subtypes as expected, because the used primers target a highly conserved region in all influenza A viruses (Supplementary Table S1 ). The obtained sequences were identical for samples SPC00384, SPC00394, and SPC00401 collected from Djibouti in March 2017 with 1 and 2 mutations in the other 2 samples (SPC00455 and SPC00687) obtained from camels from Sudan and Djibouti, respectively, at different time points (Figure 1 and Table 2 ). Unfortunately, other trials to amplify other targets failed to generate products for sequencing possibly due to RNA degradation and low viral load as well as the inability to use subtype-specific primers, especially as the exact subtypes were unknown. Therefore, 2 positive swab samples (SPC000384 and SPC000394) were analyzed by NGS for further confirmation. Upon metagenomic sequencing of the 2 samples, a total of 16 179 out of 38 584 598 and 16 094 out of 33 491 558 high quality reads that matched influenza A sequences in the Influenza Virus Database by BLASTn were obtained from samples SPC00384 and SPC00394, respectively. De novo assembly of these reads resulted in 1 and 4 contigs from samples SPC00384 and SPC00394, respectively. Query BLASTn of these 5 contigs returned closely related viruses that belonged mostly to human and swine influenza A H1N1 strains isolated between 2009 and 2019 from different countries (Supplementary Table  S2 ). However, some strains from other subtypes such as H1N2, H3N2, and H3N6 also were observed at lower frequencies (Supplementary Table S2 ). The PB2 contig (134 bases) from both samples were identical and matched a fragment in the PB2 gene corresponding to the region between nucleotide 2208 to 2341 with >97% identity and a minimum of 3 mismatches. Out of the top 100 matches, 98 were H1N1 strains and 2 were H1N2 strains (Supplementary Table S2 ). Blasting of the 116 bases contig from segment 7 in the SPC00394 sample showed >97% identity match to residues 911 to 1027 in the M gene of influenza A viruses with a minimum of 3 mismatches with 97 H1N1, 1 H1N2, and 2 H3N2 strains out of the top 100 matching sequences. The de novo assembled reads from segment 8 of SPC00394 sample resulted in 2 contigs (92 and 111 nucleotides) that matched regions corresponding to 1-92 and 790-900 in the NS1 gene of influenza A viruses, respectively. Although the first contig (92 nucleotides) matched 95 H1N1, 4 H3N2, and 1 H3N6 strains with >97% identity, the second contig (111 nucleotides) showed >99% identity match to 52 H1N1, 39 H1N2, and 3 H3N2 strains as well as 6 unknown or mixed influenza A isolates (Supplementary Table S2 ).
