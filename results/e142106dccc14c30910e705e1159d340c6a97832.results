Construction and characterization of a VRP 3526 vector platform. While alphavirus replicon particles based on wild-type VRP 3000 or the attenuated VRP 3014 surface coats are highly successful vaccine platforms (15, 17, 24, 25) , a myriad of concerns have limited their use, including select agent/BSL3 containment, reversion, and inefficacy of the vaccine platform in vulnerable populations. To overcome these issues, we developed a platform that utilizes the VEE virus 3526 vaccine backbone, which combines the deletion of the entire furin cleavage site between E3 and E2 with a secondary site resuscitating mutation in E1 (23, 26, 27) ; this attenuated virus packages fused E3/E2 protein (PE2), has been used in humans as a vaccine candidate, and is a BSL2 pathogen (28, 29) . Based on this attenuated VEE virus strain, we generated a new VRP vector platform (Fig. 1A) . The system uses the sequence of the wild-type VEE 3000 virus, including the 5= and the 3= untranslated regions (UTR) (13) . The structural glycoproteins (GPs) for VRP 3526 have a deletion in the furin cleavage site in E3 (Δ56RKRR59) that attenuates pathogenesis in cell culture and mice; a second mutation in the E1 glycoprotein restores efficient growth in BHK cells and prevents reversion to virulence through other secondary mutations (23) . The glycoprotein genes as well as viral capsid gene were inserted into separate helper constructs between the 26S subgenomic promoter and the beginning of the 3= UTR. All three plasmids were linearized, and RNA transcripts were electroporated into BHK cells. After 24 to 48 h, cell culture supernatants were collected, the VRPs were purified, and titers were determined on BHK cells, as described before (17) . Consistent with a mild packaging defect, VRP 3256 titers ranged between 2.0 ϫ 10 7 and 1.0 ϫ 10 8 IU/ml, which was about 1 to 1.5 logs less efficient than the VRP 3000 and VRP 3014 coats (Fig. 1B) . Importantly, no evidence for viable recombination and electroporation has been observed with the VRP 3526 system. To date, 47 replicons have been generated and were negative for cytopathic effect (CPE) after passages 1 and 2 (data not shown). To further examine the possibility for replicative virus, two stocks of VRP 3526 replicons expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were used to infect Vero cells, subsequently passaged, and examined for CPE and GFP expression (Fig. 1C) . Following initial passage, Vero cells showed robust expression of GFP and minimal CPE at days 1 and 2. After the second passage, only a few GFP-positive cells and no CPE were observed over the first 2 days; the final passage showed no evidence of GFP or CPE, suggesting that no viable virus was present in any of the independent passages. Together, the results argue that recombination resulting in viable attenuated VEE 3526 virus is unlikely. We next characterized antigen expression from the VRP 3526 platform using two model antigens: the SARS CoV spike glycoprotein and norovirus (NoV) VP2 capsid protein. Using the VRP 3000 platform as a control, we compared the expression of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein from the VRP isolated under BSL2 (V3526S) to that isolated under BSL3 (V3000S). Following Vero cell infection, two independent experiments demonstrated that V3526S produced amounts of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein similar to those of V3000S (Fig. 1D) . Similarly, NoV VLPs derived from BSL2 V3526-VP1 or BSL3 V3014-VP1 were indistinguishable from each other in morphology, forming ϳ40-nm particles with characteristic cup-shaped surfaces ( Fig. 2A and B ). In addition, particle microstructure integrity was comparable between the 3525 and 3014 VRP platforms based on ligand binding (50% effective concentration [EC 50 ] of 1.6 g/ml for V3014-NoV VLP and EC 50 of 1.4 g/ml for V3526-NoV VLP) (Fig. 2C ) and mouse polyclonal sera (EC 50 of 0.65 g/ml for V3014-NoV VLP and EC 50 of 0.40 g/ml for V3014-NoV VLP) (Fig.  2D ). Taken together, these data indicate that the VRP 3526 platform yields antigen expression similar to that of previous VRP platforms with the added utility of use at a lower biosafety level. Efficacy of VRP 3526 vaccine in young mice. We next analyzed VRP 3526 spike (V3526S) vaccine performance in young mice in parallel with VRP 3000 spike (V3000S) and VRP 3014 spike (V3014S). Groups of young mice were vaccinated and boosted 3 weeks later with 1 ϫ 10 5 IU of each VRP vaccine and a control VRP 3000 HA (VRP-HA) encoding influenza H1N1 hemagglutinin. Blood was collected at 21 days postprime, and 3 weeks postboost animals were challenged with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (10 5 PFU rMA15) (17, 21, 30) . Animals vaccinated with V3000S and V3526S were completely protected from SARS-CoV-induced disease, as measured by weight loss, morbidity, and death (Fig. 3A) . In contrast, V3014S-vaccinated animals lost about 10% of their body weight by day 3 postinfection and then recovered. VRP-HAvaccinated animals lost 20% of their body weight by day 4 postinfection and experienced severe symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) disease ( Fig. 3A and B). Analysis of virus titers at 2 days postinfection revealed that animals vaccinated with V3000S and V3526S had minimal viral replication, whereas V3014S-vaccinated animals were not protected from viral replication, similar to VRP-HA-vaccinated animals (Fig. 3C ). While all three VRP coats protected young adult mice from end-stage lung disease, mice vaccinated with VRP-HA revealed clear progression to diffuse alveolar damage and ARDS, as indicated by the presence of hyaline membranes (Fig. 3D , lower right, yellow arrow). In contrast, V3526S-vaccinated mice had minimal airway disease and an absence of major lung pathology based on histology scoring (Fig. 3E ), similar to the V3000S vaccines, and a modest decrease relative to V3014S. Together, the results demonstrated that the V3526S platform produced protection similar to that of wildtype V3000S and V3014S following homologous challenge.
