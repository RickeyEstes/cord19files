Selection of candidate reference genes. To investigate the eight commonly used reference genes ACT1, ACT2, EF1, EF2, L10, L17A, SOD, TUB, and 28S from S. exigua and the IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line and six reference genes, including 28S, 18S, EF1, TUB, SOD, and ACT, from M. similis (Table 1) , we determined the correlation coefficient (R 2 ) values of all candidates that varied from 0.990 to 0.998 across the cDNA diluted points and, concurrently, the PCR efficiency values of all pair-primers that varied between 90.3% and 114.5% (Table 1) . Expression profiles of candidate reference genes. It is well known that the threshold cycle (Ct) can reflect the expression level of candidate reference genes to a certain extent. In ascovirus-infected M. similis (Fig. 1A) , 18S RNA with a Ct value of 7.92 had the highest expression level and was more fluctuant than the other candidate reference genes. According to the original Ct value of S. exigua (Fig. 1B) , the highest expression reference gene was 28S with a Ct value of 12.44, and the maximal fluctuating amplitude was 6.75. ACT1 was the least variable compared to the other candidate reference genes. In ascoviruses-infected IOZCAS-Spex-II-A cell line samples, the Ct values of the candidate reference genes under the same threshold value for fluorescence ranged from 13.67 for 28S to 27.07 for EF1, which represented the highest and lowest expression levels, respectively. The fluctuation showed no significant difference with each gene (Fig. 1C ).
