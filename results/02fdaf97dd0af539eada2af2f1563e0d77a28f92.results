In vitro properties of MAb 6D6. The cross-reactive MAb (6D6) was selected by screening mouse hybridoma supernatants thoroughly for the cross-neutralizing activity of GP-specific MAbs. MAb 6D6 was found to be GP-specific and to efficiently neutralize the infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotyped with GPs of all known ebolaviruses (EBOV, SUDV, TAFV, BDBV, and RESTV), including the variant that caused the latest outbreak in West Africa (EBOV2014), but not Marburg virus (MARV), a related filovirus that causes human disease similar to EVD (Fig. 1a) . The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of 6D6 for VSVs bearing EBOV1976, EBOV2014, SUDV, TAFV, BDBV, and RESTV GPs were 0.05, 0.12, 0.19, 0.33, 0.24, and 0.62 Î¼ g/ml, respectively. We then confirmed that 6D6 effectively neutralized the infectivity of representative authentic isolates of all known ebolavirus species (Fig. 1b) . Furthermore, binding experiments to EBOV GP and neutralization assays with EBOV GP-pseudotyped VSV revealed that 6D6 possessed higher binding and neutralizing abilities than EBOV GP-specific MAbs ZGP133/3.16 and ZGP226/8.1 (Fig. 1c,d) , which have shown promising protective efficacy in animal models of lethal EBOV infection 14,22 . Identification of the putative 6D6 epitope. To determine the putative epitope of MAb 6D6, we utilized replication-competent recombinant VSV containing the EBOV, SUDV, or RESTV GP gene 23 . The putative epitopes of ZGP133/3.16 and ZGP226/8.1 have been successfully determined by identifying the amino acid substitutions observed in the antigenic variants escaping from neutralization by the antibodies 23 escape mutants of EBOV GP and found that each mutant had a single amino acid substitution, Gly-to-Arg (5/6) or Gly-to-Glu (1/6), at amino acid position 528 within the IFL sequence in the GP2 subunit (Fig. 2a) . One of the six SUDV GP escape mutants had a Gly-to-Arg substitution at position 528, and other 5 SUDV GP escape mutants had an Ala-to-Thr substitution at position 530 (Fig. 2a) . Two of the six RESTV GP escape mutants had a Gly-to-Glu substitution at position 529, which corresponded to position 528 of EBOV GP. A total of 3 amino acid changes were found in the other 4 RESTV GP escape mutants (Fig. 2a) . Using a reverse genetics approach we verified that the Leu-to-Trp substitution at position 530 was critical for escape from 6D6 neutralization ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). These amino acid positions, which are located at the tip of the IFL structures of EBOV, SUDV, and RESTV GPs, indicate that the loop structure including these residues is important to form The amino acid residues (green, blue, and yellow spheres represent Gly, Ala, and Leu, respectively) critical for escape from the MAb 6D6 neutralization are mapped on the trimeric structure of GPs. GP1 (blue) and GP2 (red) monomers are shown as ribbon models. the recognition site of 6D6 (Fig. 2b) . We confirmed that 6D6 did not bind to the chimeric EBOV GP whose IFL region was replaced with that of MARV; however, 6D6 showed no binding activity to the synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino acids of the IFL of EBOV GP (not shown), suggesting that the 6D6 epitope may partly include other conformational structures. Importantly, the amino acid sequence of the IFL region is highly conserved among all currently known ebolaviruses (Fig. 2a) , providing a novel target for universal antibody therapy against EVD caused by human-pathogenic ebolaviruses (EBOV, SUDV, TAFV, and BDBV).
