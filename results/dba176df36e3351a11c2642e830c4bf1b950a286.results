Production of Acute .hfebhritis in RIR and WL Chicks with 2 Strains of Virus It was found that susceptibility to nephritis depended on the strain of virus. Sixty newly hatched White Leghorn (WL) and 60 Rhode Island Red (RIR) chicks were infected with two strains of IBV-M41 and T-as shown in Table 1 . The 4 groups of chicks were housed separately until the end of the experiment 4 weeks after infection. Clinical observations. Tracheal r$les and gasping were detected 2 to 7 days after infection in 80 per cent of the WL chicks infected with strain M41. Only 30 per cent of the RIR chicks infected with the same virus showed respiratory signs. In contrast, the T-infected chicks (RIR and WL) showed only very mild respiratory signs, with 15 per cent of the chicks developing mild r%les. However, despite the absence of respiratory signs, severely ill chicks were observed from the third day onwards. These chicks stood hunched and appeared depressed, with ruffled feathers. Some had faeces and urine matted to the cloaca. The disease in the T infected chicks was rapid and some died within 24 h while a small number, although ill, recovered. The difference in mortality between the 2 strains of virus was statistically significant (Table 1 j. Necropsyjndings. Pathological changes were seen only in the kidneys. In all the T, infected chicks examined the kidneys were 2 to 4 times the normal size, pale in colour, and often had ureters distended with whitish fluid. Of the 5 M41-infected RIR chicks that died, 3 had enlarged kidneys. In the surviving birds killed 4 weeks after infection, no abnormalities were observed. Four pools of faecal material, 2 from M41-infected and 2 from T-infected moribund birds, were examined by negative staining and electron microscopy. Abundant coronavirus particles were seen in both groups of birds. Material from normal chicks was negative. Serological examination. All the chicks had high IBV-antibody titres. The HIantibody titres of the M4l-infected chicks were much higher than those of the T-infected group, but this probably reflected the use of the M41 virus as antigen in the HI test. In immunofluorescence tests with homologous antigens, the titres in both groups were similar. It is concluded that the T strain readily induced acute nephritis in the fowl. Pathogenesis of Acute .Ne$ritis in RIR Criicks Infected at Di$erent Stages Three groups of RIR chicks of different ages were infected with the T strain, as shown in Table 2 , and studied by virological, immunofluorescent, histological and electron-microscope techniques. Clinical observations. Of the chicks hatched from infected embryos, 80 per cent were much smaller, less alert, and less active than the control chicks. Between day 2 and day 9 after hatching 25 per cent of chicks developed mild &es. Half of these also developed diarrhoea from day 6. The infected chicks had a much reduced weight gain and a reduced feed consumption compared to uninfected chicks. From about 4 weeks, the affected chicks began to recover and gained weight. The clinical picture for chicks infected when 1 day old was as described in the previous section. Of the chicks infected at 15 days, 20 per cent had ruffled feathers and were stunted but did not show any respiratory signs. About 80 per cent of the moribund and dead birds from the group infected at day 1 showed kidney lessions. In contrast, the other groups had a much lower incidence of kidney lesions. However, serological examination showed that all infected birds had significant levels of HI antibody to IBV. Virus isolations. IBV was isolated from faecal material of both dead and moribund chicks. The infectivity titres varied between lo4 and lo6 EID,, per g of material. Large numbers of coronavirus-like particles were seen and were confirmed to be IBV by immune electron microscopy. IBV was also isolated from kidney samples collected from moribund birds with acute nephritis after the samples had been grown as explant cultures. The cells grew to confluence in about 7 days, appeared normal, and no cytopathic effect was seen in unstained cultures. However, in stained preparations small syncytia were occasionally seen. Virus was consistently recovered from the supernate of explant cultures. Histology. The main features in acute nephritis were similar to those reported by Siller and Cumming (1974) . The kidneys showed varying degrees of tubular damage and interstitial infiltration with mononuclear cells in the medullary tracts and in the cortex. In the cytoplasm of many cells of the tubules basophilic inclusions were seen. These probably represent the viral inclusion bodies seen by electron microscopy and have not been reported in previous studies. Airdried cryostat sections of frozen kidney fixed in cold acetone and stained by May-Griinwald Giemsa and viewed in polarizing light showed widespread accumulation of urate crystals in the tubules of moribund birds with enlarged kidneys. When the same sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, vacuoles in tubular cells and the lumen were obvious. Presumably, these are sites where the crystals had been dissolved. In control kidneys, only very few and fine crystals were seen. ~~~~no~u~resce~~ jindings. Virus-specific fluorescence was demonstrated in tracheal smears from moribund and dead chicks, and also in infected birds with no clinical signs. Specific cytoplasmic fluorescence was seen in the tubules of enlarged kidneys from all dead or moribund chicks as scattered foci in tubular epithelial cells in both cortex and medullary areas (Fig. 1) mainly in the proximal tubules, although other segments also showed some staining. Moribund chicks with no gross kidney abnormality showed sparse staining, often in isolated tubules. It was necessary to apply the direct fluorescent staining method because of the presence of auto-antibodies in the convalescent sera (Fig. 2) . There was no virus-specific fluorescence in the glomeruli. Thus, it is considered that the virus can infect the whole nephron except the glomerulus. There was also no staining in the intestine or the bursa of Fabricius. When FITC conjugated antiglobulins were used, immunoglobulin deposits were occasionally seen in the capillary loops of glomeruli of moribund chicks. Ultrastructuraljndings. Evidence of virus replication was found in the cells of the proximal convoluted tubules. The infected cells contained many cytoplasmic vesicles filled with mature virions (Figs 3, 4) . Desquamated cells in the lumen showed strong evidence of virus replication (Fig. 3) . The cells with greater cytoplasmic disorganization contained many characteristic viral inclusion bodies. The latter were usually bound with a single membrane, had an electron-dense matrix, and contained many electron-dense particles about 120 nm in diameter with a smooth outline. They varied in size from O-5 to 2 pm in diameter (Figs 3 to 5) . Although many lymphocytes were seen throughout the interstitial spaces none showed evidence of viral replication. Free virus particles were seen lining the microvilli of the brush-border of infected proximal tubules (Fig. 4) . Although cytoplasmic vesicles containing virus particles were only rarely seen in distal tubules, particles with projections were often seen in the lumen. The glomeruli of all moribund birds examined appeared normal.
