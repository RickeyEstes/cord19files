Generation of the MHV-nsp1-27D mutant virus, with deletion of the LLRKxGxKG region of nsp1 To assess the role of the LLRKxGxKG region of nsp1 in the context of viral replication, we constructed a recombinant virus, MHV-nsp1-27D, which encoded the MHV nsp1 with deletion of the LLRKxGxKG region (27 nts between nts 780-808) ( Figure 2 ). The growth kinetics of both wild-type (WT) MHV-A59 and mutant viruses were determined by infecting murine 17Cl-1 cells with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. The plaque morphology of MHV-nsp1-27D was the same as that of WT MHV-A59 (data not shown). Both mutant and WT viruses began to replicate at 8 h post-infection (p.i.), and reached maximal titers at 12 h p.i. The maximal titer of MHV-nsp1-27D was about 5610 5 pfu/ml, a little lower than that of WT MHV-A59 (1610 6 pfu/ml). Viral growth and the peak titer of MHV-nsp1-27D were different from those of WT MHV-A59 ( Figure 3C ). To assess the stability of the recombinant virus, the nsp1-coding region of MHV-nsp1-27D was sequenced after five passages in tissue culture; sequence analysis showed that no nucleotide changes were detected ( Figure 3A , B).
