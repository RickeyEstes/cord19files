Differences in weekly percentage of specimens positive for influenza with influenza A and B from 2008 to 2015 Table 1 identifiable in most years (not colored as pure blue), the wavelet analysis revealed that the influenza activities for type A showed a statistically significant annual pattern with one peak in winter in the years 2009-2010. Fig 1C showed weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza B. The mean was 2.9% and ranged from 0 to 90%. In Fig 1C, influenza B showed one peak in the winter in 2012, 2014 and 2015, which was consistent with the annual cycle detected in Fig 1D. Only an annual seasonal pattern was noticeable in Beijing. Coherence in weekly percentage of specimens positive for influenza and percentage of ILI consultations from 2008 to 2015 The time series of weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens (LAB) and weekly percentage of clinical consultations for ILI were normalized with mean and standard deviations as zero and one, respectively. After normalizing and aligning the curves of the weekly laboratory-confirmed rates and ILI consultation rates from 2008 to 2015, the irregular shapes of the epidemic curves for Xicheng District, Beijing, are illustrated in Fig 2A, showing both the level of synchronization as well as a similarity in shape. The results of wavelet coherence analysis between LAB and ILI are shown in Fig 2B. The LAB data presented a consistently significant coherence with ILI for the annual cycle during 2009-2011 and 2014-2015 on 95% significance level. For the semiannual cycle, high coherence was found only in the year 2014. To compare the timing of LAB and ILI, we calculated their phase angle difference for the annual cycle that was most clearly observed throughout the study. The mean of the phase angle difference was 0.328 in radians as shown in Fig 2C, which implied that LAB was estimated to follow ILI with an average delay of 2.716 weeks. ILI consistently preceded LAB from 2008 to early 2011 and approached the latter thereafter.
