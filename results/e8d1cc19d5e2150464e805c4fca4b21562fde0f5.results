The first part of this study consisted of comparing the sensitivities of cytopathogenicity, immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization for adenovirus detection. In making this evaluation we considered it important that the same cell line be used for all three detection methods so as to avoid possible cell linedependent differences in viral sensitivities. Cells of the HEp-2 line were chosen for this comparison because of difficulties which we have experienced when attempting use of the 293 line for adenovirus immunofluorescent foci assays. These difficulties with the 293 line have been 2-fold. Firstly, a tendency of the cells to round-up severely during the course of adenoviral infection such that the positive status of fluorescing cells cannot be confirmed through examination of the cell's internal morphology. Secondly, a poor adherence of cultures of this cell line to either glass or plastic microscope slides, such that the produced monolayers readily detach during efforts at fixation prior to immunofluorescence staining. The results of comparing these three different detection methods for quantitating adenoviruses present in the processed sewage concentrates are presented in Table I . It can be seen that viral titers yielded by the cytopathogenicity and immunofluorescence methods were, overall, approximately I  I  2  3   2  1  2  3  3  1  3  2  4  2  I  3  5  1  2  3  6  2  1  3  7  1  2  3  8  2  1  3  9  2  I  3  10 3 2 2 Total = 16 Total = 17 Total = 28 *Comparison made from "'mean" values for each sample/assay technique combination as presented in Table 1 . For each particular sample, the method yielding the highest assay titer was assigned a numerical value of 3, second highest assigned a numerical value of 2 and lowest assigned a numerical value of I. equivalent. Titers yielded by the in situ hybridization technique were in most cases much higher than those obtained with either cytopathogenicity or immunofluorescence. Although it is accurate only as a rough estimate, the average titer of adenoviruses detected by in situ hybridization was approx. 40% greater, as based upon the values for "average of means", than with either of the other two methods. The reproducibility of all three detection methods was approximately equivalent, as can be seen by comparing their respective values for average coefficient of variation (CV) which are listed in Table 1 . We then used a nonparametric method of analysis in order to rank the relative sensitivities of these three different detection techniques. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 2 . By this approach, that detection method which yielded the highest assay titer for any given sewage concentrate was assigned a numerical value of three, that method yielding the second highest assay titer for the same concentrate assigned a value of two, and the method yielding the lowest assay titer assigned a value of 1. Overall, the in situ hybridization assay method was best for 8 of the 10 samples. Both cytopathogenicity and immunofluorescence were better for 1 sample each. Correspondingly, it can be seen from these results that the in situ hybridization technique had the highest total score, with 28 out of a possible maximum of 30. The cytopathogenicity and immunofluorescence assay techniques had total score values which were approximately equivalent, these being 16 and 17 respectively. Results from assaying the 10 processed sewage concentrates for adenoviruses by cytopathogenicity when using the 293 cell line are presented in Table 3 . This table also presents results from titrating the sewage sample concentrates for enteroviruses by means of a plaque assay technique using the BGM cell line. By comparing the viral assay results shown in Table 3 , expressed as "average of means" for the adenoviruses and "average value" for enteroviruses, it can be estimated that the number of adenoviruses detected in these processed sewage concentrates was greater than that of enteroviruses by an average factor of approx. 94. By comparing the information presented in Tables 1 and 3 , it can be seen that the numbers of infectious adenoviruses detected by cytopathogenicity using the 293 cell line were approx. 5-fold greater than could be detected by cytopathogenicity using HEp-2 cells. Approximately one third of the adenovirus positive 293 cell cultures were subjected to a confirmation of their positive status by indirect immunofluorescence utilizing the HEp-2 line. The procedure for this confirmation consisted of first subjecting the 293 cells present in the positive culture tubes to three freeze-thaw cycles in their overlying fluid at -20Â°C. The contents of the positive tubes were then inoculated separately, both undiluted and at a 1:100 dilution in inoculation medium, onto monolayer cul- Average CV value~ = 0.69 *Values are expressed in terms of pfu ml ~ and represent results of a single trial.

The procedure used for this inoculation, as well as subsequent fixation of the infected HEp-2 cells in methanol and staining of them for examination by indirect immunofluorescence, was the same as that described in Materials and Methods for directly assaying sewage concentrates in the HEp-2 cell line. All of the 56 adenovirus positive culture tubes of 293 cells which we examined as a part of this confirmation were subsequently found to be positive by immunofluorescence in the HEp-2 cells. This indicated that the much higher viral titers obtained when performing the cytopathogenicity assay with cells of the 293 line did indeed reflect numbers of viable adenoviruses which were not capable of initially replicating in HEp-2 cells. All of these viruses were, however, capable of subsequent replication in the HEp-2 cell line following their first passage in 293 cells. It is suggested by the efforts of Takiff and coworkers (1981) that this difference of adenoviral titers yielded by cytopathogenicity in 293 cells vs HEp-2 cells reflects that portion of the total adenovirus population which is enteric in nature, i.e. is of serotypes 40 and 41, which are causative agents of human gastroenteritis. The variability associated with detecting adenoviruses by cytopathogenicity using the 293 cell line was greater in our hands (Table 3) than it was for detecting adenoviruses by either of the three techniques when using HEp-2 cells.
