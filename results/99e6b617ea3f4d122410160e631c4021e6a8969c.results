The present study included 353 T2DM patients; Table 1 describes their influenza vaccination status in the vaccination season 2017-2018. More than half of the study group, (216 (61.2%)) were currently vaccinated or intended to be vaccinated. Most of the vaccinated group were male (131 (63%)) and vaccinated before (190 (88%)). About one-fifth (75 (21%)) of participants were found previously vaccinated and reject vaccination this year, while 17.6% of participants had never been vaccinated before. No statistically significant difference was found in vaccination status by gender. Motivators and barriers for seasonal influenza vaccination in the study T2DM patients by gender are presented in Table 2 . The most frequently reported motivators of seasonal influenza vaccination among included vaccinated or willing participants were advise from healthcare givers 183 (84.7%) and subject's perception regarding the importance of vaccination (35.6%). Response to healthcare givers' advise was significantly higher among female participants (p = 0.02). As for barriers, fear of vaccine side effects and the misconception that vaccine is not important or the vaccine could cause influenza like illness were the most frequently reported barriers (73%, 50.4%, and 30.7% respectively). Fear of needle shot and misconception that vaccine is not important were more frequently reported barriers in females (p < 0.05). Absence of healthcare givers' recommendations and the difficult access to vaccine were the least reported barriers among unvaccinated group (8.8% and 0.7%). Table 3 presents the univariate analysis for the personal factors potentially associated with seasonal influenza non-vaccination in the study T2DM participants. The risk of non-vaccination was significantly increased among illiterate (OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.11-3.37). On the other hand, the other personal factors were not significantly associated with non-vaccination among the study T2DM patients. The univariate analysis for personal factors associated with seasonal influenza non-vaccination in the study of T2DM patients is presented in Table 4 . The risk of non-vaccination was significantly higher among T2DM patients with above 10 years disease duration (OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.11-3.87), and having suffered from renal complications (OR = 4.15, 95% CI: 1.91-9.04). On the other hand, participants with a positive family history of diabetes (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.53-0.85) and having suffered from ischemic heart disease co-morbidity (OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.08-0.98) were more prone to be vaccinated. More than half of the study participants (55%) were adequately knowledgeable about influenza. Inadequate knowledge was significantly higher in age group above 50 years old, duration of T2DM of more than 10 years and absence of positive family history of diabetes. The risk of non-vaccination was significantly higher (OR = 4.31, 95% CI: 2.73-6.80) among those who lack adequate knowledge (data not tabulated).
