In all, 685 adults with 2009 pandemic influenza A viral pneumonia were admitted to the ICUs. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of the study population depending on the ventilation provided. Baseline characteristics of 177 non-invasively ventilated patients, compared with other subgroups, are briefly described in Table 1 . Compared with non-ventilated subjects, patients with successful NIV presented more comorbidities (70.8 versus 57%; p <0.05), a higher lactate dehydrogenase (758 versus 523 U/L; p <0.05) and creatine kianse (307 versus 133 U/L; p <0.05) levels, as well as longer ICU stay (6 versus 4 days; p <0.05) ( Table 1 ). An NIV trial was successful in 72 patients (40.7%), but failed in 105 (59.3%), who required intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. Hence, of the 417 patients who underwent intubation, 312 (74.8%) were intubated and ventilated from the beginning, and 105 (25.2%) were intubated and ventilated after NIV failure. Therefore, 14.7% of ventilated patients admitted to the ICU for influenza A (H1N1)v pneumonia benefited from NIV. Lower APACHE II score (median 10 versus 14, p <0.001), lower SOFA score (median 3.5 versus 6, p <0.001), the presence of fewer than two chest X-ray quadrant opacities, haemodynamic stability (analysed as the absence of the need for vasopressors) and the absence of acute renal failure or MODS were associated with NIV success ( Table 2 ). These patients required shorter mechanical ventilation time (median 3 versus 12 days, p <0.001), shorter ICU stay (6 versus 15 days, p <0.001) and shorter hospital stay (11.5 versus 20.5 days, p <0 .001) than patients with NIV failure. Multivariate analysis (Table 2) demonstrated that NIV success was associated with the presence of fewer than two chest X-ray quadrant opacities (OR 3.59) and no vasopressor requirement (OR 8.18) . Moreover, when we compared the subset of non-invasively ventilated patients with two or more quadrant opacities for those with a SOFA score >7 versus those with a SOFA £7, the success rate increased from 5.9% to 40% (OR 10.7, 95% CI 1.3-88.6), whereas when the SOFA score was £3, the success rate became 71% (95% CI 58-84%).
