Of 215 potential cases and 94 potential controls, 83 matched pairs of eligible cases and controls were identified (Figure 2 ; available at www.jpeds.com). In each group, 53.0% were boys. Mean duration of exposure defined as delay between onset of acute viral infection and diagnosis of empyema in cases was 10 days. No significant differences were observed between cases and controls for age, siblings, parents' occupations, the acute viral infection site, PVC-7 vaccination, and fever at the acute viral infection onset ( Table I) . Acute viral infections were mostly upper respiratory tract viral infections. More than one-half of the subjects in each group had received at least 1 PCV-7 dose. For children with respiratory viral identification, no differences were found between the types of viruses identified for cases and controls ( Table II ; available at www.jpeds.com). Among the 79 cases with identified bacteria, S pneumoniae accounted for 86% ( Figure 3 ; available at www.jpeds.com). Among S pneumoniae with an identified serotype (n = 32), serotypes 1, 19A, and 3 were the most frequent, with the vast majority (31/32) belonging to non-PCV-7 vaccine serotypes ( Figure 4 ; available at www.jpeds.com). Considering the drug exposure-duration (6 days for antibiotics and 1or 3 consecutive days for NSAIDs) and the interval between onset of acute viral infection and starting treatment of 72 hours for any drug, NSAIDs were systematically used more often and antibiotics systematically less often for cases than controls. Acetaminophen also was prescribed more frequently for cases than controls, particularly when taken for at least 3 consecutive days (Table III) . Considering drug-use onset within 72 hours after the onset of acute viral infection and at least 6 consecutive days of antibiotic use and at least 1 day of NSAIDs or antipyretic exposure, the multivariable analysis retained increased risk of empyema associated with NSAID exposure (aOR 2.79, P = .004), decreased risk of empyema associated with antibiotic (aOR 0.32, P = .04) ( Table IV) , and no association with acetaminophen. No interaction between antibiotic use and NSAIDs exposure was statistically significant in the link with empyema (P = .23). Subgroup analyses carried out to examine potential interaction(s) between antibiotic and NSAID use and empyema showed that the risk of empyema associated with NSAID was greater when antibiotics were used for less than 6 consecutive days (unconditional aOR 3.01, P = .002), and empyema risk associated with antibiotics was lower for the subgroup of children exposed to NSAIDs (unconditional aOR 0.24, P = .06) compared with children unexposed to NSAIDS (Table V ; available at www.jpeds.com).
