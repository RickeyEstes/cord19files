We recruited 52 subjects for the study. We evaluated the registration accuracy in two approaches based on circular aluminum foil markers on 6 subjects and manually selected landmarks on 10 subjects. We also compared the temperature reading results on 36 subjects based on manual canthi selection and automatic canthi detection, respectively. Different subjects were used for different evaluation approaches and temperature reading study to avoid reduplicative information.
