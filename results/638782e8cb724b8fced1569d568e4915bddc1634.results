Mapping of the regions required for − 1 PRF in the 3′ UTR of RCNMV RNA1 Our previous study showed that several capped RNA1 mutants with deletions in the 3′ UTR supported the accumulation of negativestrand RNA2 less efficiently than did the wild-type (wt) RNA1 in BYL, although these RNA1 mutants produced p27 to similar or even higher levels than did wt RNA1 (Iwakawa et al., 2007) . This result suggests that the deleted regions are involved in the production of p88, which is translated via −1 PRF. To investigate whether the 3′ UTR of RNA1 has the cis-acting RNA element(s) required for −1 PRF and the production of p88, we tested RNA1 mutants with a series of deletions in their 3′ UTR (Figs. 1A and B, Iwakawa et al., 2007) for their ability to produce p88 in BYL. We used capped viral RNA transcripts because the 3′ UTR of RNA1 contains RNA elements essential for cap-independent translation of both p88 and p27 (Iwakawa et al., 2007; Mizumoto et al., 2003) . Capped RNA1 mutants were incubated in BYL at 17°C for 4 h, and the accumulated levels of p27 and p88 were analyzed by western blotting using an anti-p27 antiserum. For this assay, we used the membrane fraction of BYL obtained after centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 10 min because the level of p88 accumulated in BYL was below the detectable threshold (data not shown). An RNA1 mutant (R1-SM) that has mutations in the heptanucleotide shifty site was used as a negative control. d3′SLB, d3′SLC, and d3′SLDE-5′ accumulated lower levels of p88 than those accumulated in wt RNA1, whereas all the RNA1s tested accumulated p27 to similar levels (Fig. 1C , lanes 3-5). d3′SLF that lacks the 3′ terminal SL required for negative-strand synthesis (Iwakawa et al., 2007) accumulated p88 as efficiently as wt RNA1 (Fig. 1C, lane 7) , suggesting that RNA replication, including negative-strand RNA synthesis and accumulations of dsRNAs, has no or little effects on the production of p88 via −1 PRF in BYL. These results suggest that the regions, including SLB, SLC, and SLDE, contain cis-acting RNA elements required for − 1 PRF. To delimit the regions required for −1 PRF, we constructed RNA1 mutants with a series of deletions in the regions (Figs. 1A and D) and tested them as described above. Western blot analysis showed that the accumulated levels of p88 were much lower in RNA1 mutants with deletions in the stem of SLC than in wt RNA1 and in other RNA1 mutants despite their ability to accumulate p27 to a level similar to that in wt RNA1 (Fig. 1E , lanes 4 and 6). Deletions in SLB and SLDE affected the accumulation of p88 mildly (Fig. 1E , lanes 2, 3, 7, and 8). Interestingly, deletion of 3′TE-DR1c did not affect the accumulation of p88 (Fig. 1E, lane 5) . This result suggests that the region of SLC, except for 3′TE-DR1c, is involved in efficient − 1 PRF. To delineate the regions required for − 1 PRF more precisely, we tested RNA1 mutants with smaller deletions in SLC ( Figs. 2A and B) . Deletions of two-thirds of the 5′ stem of SLC and half of the 3′ stem of SLC severely decreased the accumulated levels of p88 without affecting the accumulation of p27 (Fig. 2C , lanes 2, 3, and 7). These results suggest that the nucleotide sequences and/or RNA structures in the basal region of SLC are important for − 1 PRF.
