Long-term passage of WT-MHV and MHV-ExoN(-). We serially passaged WT-MHV and MHV-ExoN(-) in delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells 250 times (P250). Virus from each passage was harvested once 50% to 100% of the monolayer was involved in syncytia, which occurred between 8 and 24 hours postinfection (hpi). Passage conditions varied increased replication of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was affected by the presence of potential defective viral genomes or by some other population-based phenomenon, both WT-MHV P250 and MHV-ExoN(-) P250 were plaque purified three times. The plaque-purified viruses replicated indistinguishably from the parent populations (Fig. 2C ). Together, these data demonstrate that WT-MHV and MHV-ExoN(-) populations had adapted for increased replication and that either individual genomes or those derived from a single virus plaque encoded the adaptive changes required by the total population. MHV-ExoN(-) accumulated 8-fold-more mutations than WT-MHV but did not revert ExoN-inactivating substitutions. To determine whether the increased replication of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 resulted from primary reversion of ExoN(-) motif I, we sequenced nsp14 from infected-cell total RNA. MHV-ExoN(-) P250 retained the motif I DE-to-AA substitutions, demonstrating that primary reversion of ExoN(-) motif I did not occur. To identify potentially adaptive consensus mutations, we performed full-genome di-deoxy sequencing of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 and WT-MHV P250. Within WT-MHV P250, we identified 23 mutations, of which 17 were nonsynonymous (NS) (Fig. 3A) . In contrast, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 had 171 total mutations (74 NS) (Fig. 3B) . The full-genome sequences have been deposited in GenBank, and the mutations for both viruses are listed in Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material. We identified only one mutation shared by both viruses (nsp1 A146T), though it was present in approximately 50% of the WT-MHV P250 population by di-deoxy sequencing. Both viruses deleted most of the hemagglutinin esterase (HE). In MHV-A59, HE mRNA is not transcribed in vitro (47) (48) (49) , and HE protein expression is detrimental to MHV-A59 fitness in cell culture (50) . WT-MHV P250 also deleted open reading frame 4a (ORF4a), which is dispensable for MHV replication in cell culture (51) . The C-terminal region of ns2 within MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was truncated and fused to HE with a Ϫ1 frameshift. Ns2 is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) that protects viral RNA by degrading 2=-to-5= oligoadenylate, the activating factor for cellular RNase L (52) (53) (54) . The portion of ns2 deleted in MHV-ExoN(-) P250 lies outside the PDE catalytic domain, in a region of unknown function. C-terminally truncated ns2 retains enzymatic activity (55) , but whether these specific deletions and fusions disrupt PDE activity remains to be tested. Nevertheless, ns2 is dispensable for MHV replication in immortalized cells (56, 57) . Details about the deletion sites are provided in Fig. S1 in the supplemental material. Within proteins predicted to be part of the replicasetranscriptase complex (nsp7-16 and nucleocapsid) (39), WT-MHV P250 had only one NS change, located in the nsp13-helicase ( Fig. 3A and Table S1 ). In contrast, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 had 17 NS changes within this region ( Fig. 3B and Table S2 ). MHV-ExoN(-) P250 displays increased genomic RNA accumulation and increased resistance to 5-fluorouracil. Coronaviruses lacking ExoN consistently display defects in RNA synthesis relative to WT strains (14, 16, 42) . To determine whether the increased replication of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was associated with restored genomic RNA (gRNA) production, we measured gRNA accumulation over time using two-step realtime quantitative PCR (15, 16) . MHV-ExoN(-) P250 accumulated levels of gRNA similar to those accumulated by WT-MHV P3 and WT-MHV P250 at early time points, while gRNA levels for MHV-ExoN(-) P3 were~1 log 10 lower (Fig. 4A ). MHV-ExoN(-) P250 gRNA levels fell below those of WT-MHV and WT-MHV P250 after 8 h and were similar to those of MHV-ExoN(-) P3 at 10 hpi. Normalizing to the gRNA abundance at 4 h for each virus demonstrated that the rates of gRNA accumulation were similar for all four viruses (Fig. 4B) . These data suggest that the increased replication of P250 viruses relative to WT-MHV is not fully accounted for by increased RNA synthesis. In addition to RNA synthesis defects, ExoN(-) CoVs have up to 20-fold-increased mutation frequencies and profoundly increased sensitivity to nucleoside and base analogues relative to WT CoVs (13, 14, 16, 17, 38) . To determine whether the nucleoside analogue sensitivity of MHV-ExoN(-) was altered by long-term passage, we treated cells infected with parental and passaged viruses with the base analog, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is converted intracellularly into a nucleoside analogue that incorporates into growing RNA strands and causes A:G and U:C mutations. For simplicity, we will hereafter refer to 5-FU as a nucleoside analogue. Incorporation of 5-FU is increased in the absence of ExoN activity (16) . All viruses displayed a concentration-dependent decrease in viral titer but differed greatly in their levels of susceptibility to 5-FU (Fig. 4C ). At 120 M, WT-MHV P3 titers were reduced by~1 log 10 , while MHV-ExoN(-) P3 titers were undetectable (Ͼ5 log 10fold reduction). WT-MHV 5-FU sensitivity was not altered by passage. MHV-ExoN(-) P250 was less susceptible than MHV-ExoN(-) P3 to 5-FU treatment, with a decrease in titer of only~1.5 log 10 at 120 M. MHV-ExoN(-) P250 remained more sensitive to 5-FU than WT-MHV, suggesting that WT-like resistance requires an intact ExoN. These data demonstrate that MHV-ExoN(-) P3 evolved resistance to 5-FU through mutations outside ExoN(-) motif I. Spike mutations in MHV-ExoN(-) P250 do not increase resistance to 5-FU. Bacteriophage X174 acquired resistance to 5-FU by delaying cell lysis, thereby reducing the number of replication cycles in which 5-FU can be incorporated (58) . MHV-ExoN(-) P250 had multiple mutations in the spike glycoprotein, including one in the spike furin cleavage site that reduced syncytium formation. To test whether the spike mutations manifested in resistance to 5-FU, we cloned the spike gene from MHV-ExoN(-) P250 into the isogenic MHV-ExoN(-) background. The recombinant virus demonstrated intermediate replication kinetics between MHV-ExoN(-) P3 and MHV-ExoN(-) P250 (Fig. 5A ) and did not form syncytia. Spike-P250 also increased the specific infectivity of viral particles (Fig. 5B) . However, the MHV-ExoN(-) P250 spike did not affect the sensitivity of the recombinant virus to 5-FU (Fig. 5C ). Thus, any adaptive increase in 5-FU resistance must be located elsewhere in the genome. MHV-ExoN(-) passage resulted in unique mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. To date, three proteins have been shown to alter CoV sensitivity to 5-FU: nsp12-RdRp, nsp14-ExoN, and nsp10 (which stimulates ExoN activity) (15, 17, 39) . Neither WT-MHV nor MHV-ExoN(-) P250 contained an NS mutation in nsp10, and WT-MHV P250 had no mutations within either nsp12 or nsp14. In contrast, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 had 7 NS mutations in nsp12 and 6 NS mutations in nsp14 ( Fig. 3 and 6) , none of which have been described previously in vitro or in viable viruses. Within nsp12, six mutations were in the predicted RdRp finger, palm, and thumb domains ( Fig. 6A ) (59) . Four residues (H709, F766, S776, and M814) can be visualized on a Phyre 2 -modeled structure of the MHV-nsp12 RdRp, while the remaining residues lie outside the modeled core RdRp (Fig. 6A ) (17) . One mutation, M288T, lies in the CoV-specific domain, which is conserved among nidoviruses. This domain has been implicated in membrane targeting in MHV-A59 (60) and performs an essential nucleotidylation activity in the Arterivirus equine arteritis virus (61) . However, M288T is not predicted to catalyze nucleotidylation. Within nsp14, 4 NS mutations were identified in the ExoN domain, and 2 NS mutations were in the C-terminal N7-methyltransferase domain (Fig. 6B ). We next modeled the structure of MHV nsp14 using Phyre 2 software (62), resulting in highest-probability similarity to the SARS-CoV nsp14-nsp10 complex (PDB 5C8S) (44) with high confidence (i.e., the calculated probability of true homology between the structures) of 100% for residues 3 to 519 of MHV-nsp14. The model predicts that five mutations are located close to surface of the protein (Fig. 6B ). All three modeled zinc finger domains contain one NS mutation (F216Y, Y248H, and L473I). Two mutations, D128E and F216Y, are located near the interface between nsp10 and nsp14, though neither site has previously been implicated in nsp10-nsp14 interactions (15, 63, 64) . One NS mutation resulted in a D272E substitution in ExoN motif III, a metal-coordinating active site residue. We previously reported that alanine substitution of D272 results in an ExoN(-) phenotype (14) , but the viability or phenotype of a D272E substitution was not tested in that study. These data suggest that a network of residues evolved to regulate nsp12 and nsp14 activity or stability in the ExoN(-) background. Fixed mutations in nsp12 and nsp14 in MHV-ExoN(-) P250 directly correlate with increased resistance to multiple nucleoside analogues. To determine approximately when the mutations in nsp12 and nsp14 arose, we performed di-deoxy sequencing across these protein-coding regions roughly every 20 passages (P10, P31, P50, P72, P90, P100, P120, P140, P160, P180, P200, P220, and 240). By this method, we detected consensus NS mutations at P10, P50, and P160 for nsp12 and at P50 and P160 for nsp14 (Fig. 6 ). Both nsp12 and nsp14 carried their full complement of P250 consensus mutations by P160, except for a minority variant (D913E) in nsp12 that was maintained at Ͻ50% of the population between P200 and P250. These passage levels correlated with increased replication of MHV-ExoN(-) (Fig. 2B ) and with decreasing sensitivity to 5-FU (Fig. 4C ). Neither replication nor 5-FU sensitivity of MHV-ExoN(-) changed substantially between P160 and P250. To determine whether MHV-ExoN(-) Adaptation of Proofreading-Deficient Coronaviruses ® evolved increased resistance to multiple nucleoside analogues, we treated virusinfected cells with three additional analogues that are substrates for viral RdRps: ribavirin (RBV), a guanine analogue that inhibits viral replication through multiple mechanisms, including mutagenesis and inhibition of purine biosynthesis (65); 5-azacytidine (AZC), an RNA mutagen (66) ; and 2=-C-methyladenosine (CMeA), which is proposed to incorporate in viral RNA and terminate nascent transcripts (67) . As with 5-FU, we observed dose-dependent sensitivity to RBV, AZC, and CMeA in all MHV-ExoN(-) viruses that decreased with increasing passage number (Fig. 4D to F). Except for AZC, MHV-ExoN(-) sensitivity did not change between P160 and P250. Together, these data demonstrate that MHV-ExoN(-) evolved increased resistance to multiple nucleoside analogues that correlated with the length of passage and the acquisition of mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. Importantly, this occurred in the absence of specific mutagenic selection and without reversion of ExoN motif I. This increased general selectivity toward all four classes of nucleotide strongly supports the idea of an overall increase in fidelity in MHV-ExoN(-) P250. Mutations in nsp12 partially account for increased resistance of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 to multiple nucleoside analogues. We hypothesized that mutations in MHV-ExoN(-) P250 nsp12 and nsp14 were most likely to impact replication and nucleoside analogue sensitivity based on their enzymatic activities and temporal association with phenotypic changes. To test this hypothesis, we engineered recombinant MHV-ExoN(-) to encode the P250 nsp12 and nsp14 sequences, alone and together. Expression of nsp12-P250 and nsp14-P250, alone or in combination, altered replication kinetics of MHV-ExoN(-) without affecting peak titers (Fig. 7A) and increased gRNA levels above those of MHV-ExoN(-) P3 (Fig. 7B ). Nsp12-P250 had a greater effect than nsp14-P250 on the sensitivity of MHV-ExoN(-) to all analogues tested, and the combination of nsp12and nsp14-P250 did not increase resistance above that seen with nsp12-P250 alone ( Fig. 7C to E) . None of the recombinant viruses recapitulated the resistance phenotypes of the MHV-ExoN(-) P250 population. Together, these data demonstrate that nsp12-P250 mutations account only partially for the nucleoside analogue resistance of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 and that adaptations in nsp12-P250 mask those in nsp14-P250. We also can conclude that the nsp14-P250 D272E active site mutation does not correct the defect caused by the motif I DE-to-AA substitutions. Resistance to nucleoside analogues correlates with MHV-ExoN(-) fitness. We hypothesized that mutations in nsp12 and nsp14 provided a fitness advantage to MHV-ExoN(-) P250. We competed the recombinant viruses with a reference MHV-ExoN(-) virus (P1 stock) containing 10 silent mutations in the nsp2 coding region. Mutant and reference viruses were detected in the mixed infection by real-time quantitative PCR using dually labeled probes specific for each virus. MHV-ExoN(-) P3 showed a modest fitness advantage over the reference P1 MHV-ExoN(-) silent strain (Fig. 7F, solid green) . MHV-ExoN(-) P250 profoundly outcompeted MHV-ExoN(-) silent, with Ͼ1,000-fold more MHV-ExoN(-) P250 genomes present at the end of passage 1 (Fig. 7F, dotted green line) . MHV-ExoN(-) nsp12-P250 had greater relative fitness than MHV-ExoN(-) nsp14-P250, and MHV-ExoN(-) nsp12/14-P250 was intermediate between the single recombinants, implicating a complex evolutionary interaction between these two proteins. The measured fitness correlated with the patterns of nucleoside analogue . For panels C to E, the statistical significance of changes in the titer of swapped viruses relative to MHV-ExoN(-) P3 at the highest drug concentration tolerated was determined using the Mann-Whitney test (*, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01; ***, P Ͻ 0.001; ns, not significant). For panel F, the statistical significance for the indicated comparisons was determined using the Mann-Whitney test. Boxed points have the same P value. Adaptation of Proofreading-Deficient Coronaviruses ® resistance and RNA synthesis associated with mutations in nsp12 and nsp14, suggesting a link between the evolutions of these phenotypes. The result also confirms that nsp12 and nsp14 are important but not sufficient to account for the significantly increased fitness of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 relative to MHV-ExoN(-) P3.
