We recorded 54,494, 59,575, 56,111, 56,659, 59,068, and 57,081 deaths in Tianjin for each year of the survey (1999-2004), respectively, for a total of 342,988 deaths for the 6year period. From 1999 through 2004, all-cause mortality declined for both men (from 686.6 to 551.2 per 100,000) and women (from 509.1 to 407.2 per 100,000) (P < .001), although mortality was consistently higher among men than among women (P < .001). All-cause mortality also decreased in both urban and rural areas, but the decline was steeper in urban areas (Table 1) . Deaths from noncommunicable diseases were far more common in Tianjin during the study period than were deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases. The 5 leading causes of death were all noncommunicable diseases (cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, malignant neoplasm, chronic lower respiratory disease, and injuries and poisoning), which collectively accounted for more than 80% of all deaths ( Table 2) . Standardized mortality in Tianjin for cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, and malignant neoplasm all decreased from 1999 through 2004 (P < .001), but mortality for diabetes increased (P < .001). The 3 leading causes of maternal death in Tianjin were postpartum hemorrhage (30%), preeclampsia (16%), and puerperal infections (16%). Maternal mortality differed significantly between urban and rural areas (Table 3) . Infant mortality decreased from 0.8% to 0.4% during the study (P < .001) and, except for 2003 and 2004, was consistently lower in urban than in rural areas ( Table 4 ). The 3 leading causes of infant death were prematurity (31%), newborn birth injuries and asphyxia (24%), and congenital heart disease (12%). Deaths from injuries and poisoning were twice as common among men as among women in Tianjin. The leading causes of injury were traffic accidents (50%), suicide (14%), accidental poisoning (12%), drowning (7%), and falls (4%). Life expectancy of women exceeded that of men for all years of the study. Women's life expectancy increased from 79 to 82 years (0.78% per year), and men's life expectancy increased from 75 to 78 years (0.77% per year). The years of potential life lost from the most common chronic diseases increased from 592,641 to 654,408 during the study.
