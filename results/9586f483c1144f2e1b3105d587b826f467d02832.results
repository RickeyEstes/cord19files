An AcMNPV late gene product induces P40 nuclear accumulation Previously, we and other groups have revealed the nuclear accumulation mechanism of P78/83 and G-actin [29] [30] [31] , two key elements of the actin polymerization machinery, during AcMNPV infection. To investigate how AcMNPV accumulates Arp2/3, the central regulator of actin polymerization, in the nucleus, we cloned the cDNA sequences of Arp2/3 subunits from Sf9 cells, a commercially available Spodoptera frugiperda cell line commonly used for baculovirus infection (GenBank Accession: KJ187399.1, JQ364941.1, KJ187400.1, GU356595.1, KJ187401.1, KJ187402.1) [34] . Here, P40 was selected to represent Arp2/3 because P40 appeared to be the most abundant protein detected by either Western blot or fluorescence microscopy (Arp2 and P20 were less abundant than P40; Arp2 could only be detected by Western blot; other subunits were barely detected by Western blot or fluorescence microscopy when transiently expressed in Sf9 cells). We prepared plasmid-based expression constructs encoding P40 tagged with a V 5 epitope (P40-V 5 ) at its C-terminus or P40 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein at its N-terminus (EGFP-P40) to monitor the Arp2/3 dynamics during AcMNPV infection. Cytoplasmic localization was noted by immunofluorescence for P40-V 5 for mock infected cells (Fig 1A, left panel) , but some nuclear localization was observed for cells infected with AcMNPV carrying an EGFP marker (vAc egfp , diagramed in S1A Fig) . As evidenced by cell fraction and Western blot, P40-V 5 was present in only the cytoplasmic fraction of mock infected cells, while some P40-V 5 was found in the nuclear fraction of vAc egfp infected cells (Fig 1A, right panel). The nuclear and cytoplasmic control proteins, histone and tubulin respectively, were identified in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively, validating the effectiveness of the fractionation (Fig 1A, right panel) . Similarly, by fluorescence microscopy, EGFP-P40 localized to the nucleus only in cells infected with AcMNPV expressing polyhedrin (vAc polh , diagramed in S1A Fig) (Fig 1B) . This phenotype is in accordance with the observation described by Goley et al., in which yellow fluorescent protein-tagged P21 (P21-YFP) was observed to accumulate in the nucleus during AcMNPV infection [23] . To test whether EGFP-P40 associates with other Arp2/3 subunits, Arp2-Ha was coexpressed with EGFP or EGFP-P40 in Sf9 cells, respectively. Western blot assay demonstrated that Arp2-Ha (approx. 46 kDa), EGFP (approx. 27 kDa), and EGFP-P40 (approx. 69 kDa) were present in the whole cell lysates (WCL) (Fig 1C, left panel) . A co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay using anti-Ha showed that EGFP-P40, but not EGFP, was pulled down with Arp2-Ha (Fig 1C, left panel) , indicating that EGFP-P40 is associated with Arp2-Ha. Similarly, EGFP-P40 is shown to interact with P20-Ha (approx. 21 kDa) (Fig 1C, right panel) , implying that EGFP fusion to P40 does not impair the incorporation of P40 into Arp2/3. Taken together, these phenotypes demonstrated that either the C-terminally tagged P40-V 5 or the N-terminally tagged EGFP-P40 can be used to monitor Arp2/3 dynamics during AcMNPV infection. We next investigated which class of viral genes needed to be expressed for P40 nuclear accumulation. Aphidicoline (APH), an inhibitor of DNA synthesis, was used to shut off AcMNPV . Subcellular distribution of P40 in plasmid-transfected cells. P40-V 5 was transiently expressed in Sf9 cells by plasmid transfection and then the cells were either mock-infected or infected with vAc egfp (MOI = 2). At 24 hpi, the cells were subjected to either immunofluorescence microscopy (left panel) or cell fractionation (right panel). For immunofluorescence microscopy, the cells were fixed, probed with anti-V 5 antibody to detect P40-V 5 , and visualized with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibody (red). Hoechst 33258 was used to stain the nuclear DNA (blue). For the cell fractionation assay, the cells were harvested and separated into nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) fractions. The fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-V 5 , anti-tubulin, and antihistone-H 3 antibodies to detect P40, tubulin, and histone-H 3 , respectively. (B). EGFP-P40 subcellular late gene expression [35] . The dynamic localization of P40 in AcMNPV-infected cells was monitored in the presence or absence of APH. Early during infection (0-12 hpi), P40 resided predominantly in the cytoplasm irrespective of APH treatment (Fig 1D) . During the late phase of infection (After 12 hpi), AcMNPV infection resulted in detectable P40 accumulation in the nucleus in the absence of APH, suggesting that viral late gene products may play an important role in P40 nuclear accumulation. When the expression of viral late genes was shut off by APH, P40 failed to accumulate in the nucleus, as demonstrated by both immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation assays ( Fig 1D) . Together, these data indicated that viral late gene products are responsible for P40 nuclear accumulation.
