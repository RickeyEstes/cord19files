Fifty-one SOTR, with a median age of 48 years (16-73) and including 28 (54.9%) men were diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1). The types of transplant were 24 kidney, 11 liver, eight lung, five heart, two combined pancreas-kidney and one combined liver-kidney. Most patients received triple therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. One patient had an allograft rejection treated with a corticosteroid bolus in the month prior to influenza. Influenza occurred at 3.7 years after transplantation (1 day to 21.5 years) and in 40 cases (78.4%) occurred beyond the first year (Fig. 1 ). In three patients (5.9%), symptoms started 1-5 days after the transplant, without identification of the source of influenza infection; all had pneumonia, one died and another lost the graft because of acute rejection. Four cases (7.8%) were hospital acquired. Co-morbidities, vaccination history and previous use of antibiotics are detailed in Table 1 . Only one patient had received pandemic influenza A(H1N1) vaccine, having normal gammaglobulin levels and no prior rejection episodes.
