Isolation, characterization and sequence analysis of re-emerging PRV virulent strain. Since 2011, PRV re-emerged and escaped the old vaccine-induced immunity, causing widespread pseudorabies outbreaks in vaccinated pig farms in China 11 . In order to isolate new PRV virulent variants resistant to the current vaccines, PRV-PCR-positive brain samples of aborted fetus from vaccinated pigs were homogenated and inoculated onto PK-15 cells after bacteria filter. A new PRV virulent strain (HNX) was isolated by plaque purification. The major antigens, glycoprotein B (gB), gC and gD of PRV were then amplified by PCR and subjected to sequencing. As shown in Fig. 1a -c, the gB, gC and gD amino acid sequences of PRV HNX displayed some variations and deletion, when compared with the Bartha strain and previous pandemic Ea strain. To further characterize the virulence of PRV HNX strain, PRV-free piglets were intramascularly vaccinated with Bartha-K61, a classical attenuated live vaccine, and then challenged with PRV HNX or Ea strain (10 7 TCID50). The group challenged with PRV HNX strain developed typical pseudorabies symptoms, whereas no symptoms was observed by the Ea and the uninfected control groups (data not shown). This was further confirmed by the fever (rectal temperature > 40.0 °C) in PRV HNX infected group, but not in PRV Ea infected and uninfected control groups (Fig. 1d) . Moreover, the virus neutralization titer of antisera was measured 24 days after vaccination. Compared to the neutralization titer of antisera against PRV Ea, the titer against PRV HNX was significantly lower, suggesting the insufficient prophylactic effect of this vaccine against the re-emerging PRV HNX strain (Fig. 1e ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the re-emerging PRV strain can escape the immunity induced by the current commercial vaccines, thus posing an urgent demand for new vaccines. PRV multi-virulent genes recombination via CRISPR/Cas9n system. To establish an express vaccine development strategy, two highly efficient gene edit systems, CRISPR/Cas9 and Cre/Lox system were employed. Meanwhile single cell FACS technique was also applied to simplify and accelerate the plaque purification as shown in Fig. 2a . To avoid false positive signals caused by fluorescent gene expression in homologous recombination donor template, the expressions of GFP and mCherry were driven by endogenous viral promoter, which occurs only after precise DNA homologous recombination. GFP and mCherry genes were flanked with Lox P and Lox N pairs respectively to facilitate fluorescent marker genes excision (Fig. 2b) . Thymidine kinase (TK) and gE are the major virulent genes of PRV and also the primary targets for PRV gene deletion vaccines 15 . The simultaneous deletion of TK and gE genes was achieved by CRISPR/Cas9 system mediated homologous recombination. Firstly, sgRNAs target to TK and gE genes (designed by web based tool http://crispr.mit.edu/) and DNA donors containing fluorescent selection genes and homologous arms were co-transfected to HEK293T cells (Fig. 3a) . Eight hours post transfection, cells were then infected with PRV HNX with different MOI (multiplicity of infection) and incubated until recombinant virus expressing red and/or green fluorescence were observed (Fig. 3b) . Notably, no green/red overlapping cells were observed in the control group (Data not shown). Next, the recombinant viruses were collected and inoculated to PK15 cells (P1). PK15 cells with fluorescence were then subjected to FACS and plated one cell per well to 96-well plate pre-cultured with PK15 cells. The wells showing maximum green and red overlapping signals were then subjected one round of plaque purification to obtain the pure recombinant viruses (P2) (Fig. 3c,d) . As the viruses with TK gene replicate much faster and may thus outgrow the TK gene deleted viruses, we applied BVDU (Bromovinyl deoxyuridine), an inhibitor of TK, to suppress WT PRV or gE single deletion PRV. Finally, the purity of recombinant virus was validated by PCR amplification. As shown in Fig. 3e , the positive control PCR bands were observed in all the the samples except H 2 O Excision of Double fluorescent marker genes via Cre-lox based system. Due to vaccine safety concerns and regulation, all the selection markers in vaccine candidate need to be completely removed. To this end, the incompatible LoxP and LoxN sites were inserted into the homologous recombination DNA donor, flanking GFP and mChrrey genes respectively in the same orientation (Fig. 2b) . HEK293T cells were used for Cre recombinase gene transfection and it mediated gene excision, because of the high transfection and expression efficiency of this cell line. As shown in Fig. 4a , the Cre recombinase gene transfected HEK293T cells were infected with PRV-HNX-TK − /gE − GFP + mCherry + recombinant PRV with various MOI (0.1, 1, and 10). After 24 hours of incubation, the Cre recombinase transfected cells exhibit significant less fluorescence compared to the control with mock transfection (Fig. 4b,c) . The first generation of Cre-treated recombinant viruses were harvested after infection at an MOI of 1, which showed the highest efficiency for gene excision (P3). Double fluorescent gene excision was achieved through three rounds of plaque purification as shown in Fig. 4d . Thus, by virtue of these genome-editing tools, the re-emerging PRV HNX was successfully engineered into a PRV-HNX-TK − /gE − recombinant virus (P4). Prophylactic effect of PRV-HNX-TK − /gE − in mice and piglets. The safety of this novel vaccine candidate was firstly assessed in mice. All mice injected with PRV HNX group died, three to five days later, whereas all the PRV-HNX-TK − /gE − injected mice remained healthy (Fig. 5a) . Next, the PRV-HNX-TK − /gE − vaccinated mice were challenged with the re-emerging PRV HNX, PRV Ea or a standard WT virus strain PRV-Becker with GFP in gE position. Fig. 5b -d demonstrated that vaccination with PRV-HNX-TK − /gE − provides complete protection against the previous and re-emerging PRV strains. This was further supported by the presence of extensive GFP signals in brain sections of unvaccinated mice but not in that of the vaccinated group (Fig. 5e) . Next, sixteen of PRV-free piglets were randomly divided into two groups (one group immunized with PRV-HNX-TK − /gE − and the other with DMEM) and subsequently challenged with current pandemic PRV (10 8 TCID50) intranasally at 28 days post vaccination. Death, anti-gB antibodies, and clinical signs including body temperature, respiratory distress, depression, anorexia, cough, convulsions, ataxia, itching, and weight were measured or recorded. No typical pseudorabies clinical signs were observed in PRV-HNX-TK − /gE − vaccinated group, whereas severe pseudorabies symptoms were developed in the control group (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6a , this vaccine candidate can completely protect piglets against the current pandemic PRV strain, while only two piglets survived in the control group. In this line, anti-gB antibody was significantly increased post vaccination in vaccinated piglets (Fig. 6b) . The fever (rectal temperature > 40.0 °C) and daily weight gain of vaccinated group were significantly more than that of the control group (Fig. 6c,d) . Next, the dead and surviving piglets were subjected to histopathological analysis. Piglets from the control group exhibited severe pathological damages in brain, such as obvious meningeal inflammation, microglia nodule and perivascular cuff, whereas just a mild meningeal inflammation were observed in the vaccinated piglets even after challenge with high dose of virus (10 8 TCID50) (Fig. 6e,f) . Together, these data demonstrated the potential of this vaccine candidate for protection against pseudorabies.
