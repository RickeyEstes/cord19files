A total of 185 nasopharyngeal swabs were tested; 142 were from children admitted to the hospital, and 43 were positive for M. pneumoniae. Table 1 summarizes the results obtained using the NxTAG Assay. At least one infectious agent was identified in 164 (88.7%) of the swabs (Table 1) . A single pathogen was detected in 88 (47.6%) swabs, and 2, 3, 4, and 5 agents were detected in 51 (27.6%), 20 (10.8%), 2 (1.1%), and 3 (1.6%) swabs, respectively. RSV was the most common pathogen; it was identified in 80 (43.2%) samples, including 40 (50.0%) as single agent and 40 (50.0%) in association with other respiratory viruses. RSV A and RSV B were found in 44 and 37 cases, respectively (they were detected in combination in one swab). M. pneumoniae was detected in 33 (17.8%) cases; it was found alone in 22 (11.9%) swabs and associated with other respiratory viruses in 11 (5.9%) swabs. HMPV, hRV/hEV, and hADV were detected in 34 (18.4%), 32 (17.3%), and 25 (13.5%) swabs, respectively; in most cases, they were found in association with other respiratory agents. Other viruses were detected in combination in a smaller number of swabs. No cases of C. pneumoniae or L. pneumophila infection were detected. Comparison with the RVP Fast Assay v2 was possible only for 184 samples, because this assay produced un "undetermined" result for one sample. The NxTAG Assay detected a significantly higher number of viruses (Table 2 ). In 91 (6.2%) tests with a negative result with the RVP Fast Assay v2, a virus was identified by the NxTAG Assay (P b 0.001). In contrast, in only 4 tests in which a virus was not detected by the NxTAG Assay, a viral agent was identified by the RVP Fast Assay v2. The detection rates were higher for all of the most common viruses, with differences that were statistically significant for RSV (P = 0.003), hMPV (P b 0.001), hRV/hEV (P = 0.009) and hADV (P b 0.001). No differences were found for influenza and parainfluenza 3 virus. Finally, the NxTAG Assay identified M. pneumoniae in 32 of 44 (72.7%) PCR-positive samples. Tables 3 and 4 present the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of the NxTAG assay and the RVP Fast Assay v2 compared to real-time PCR specific for RSV A and B, hMPV, hRV, hADV and M. pneumoniae. For RSV, the two multiplex assays had similar sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV. Moreover, both exhibited good concordance with real-time PCR, as evidenced by Cohen's kappa coefficients higher than 0.80 in
