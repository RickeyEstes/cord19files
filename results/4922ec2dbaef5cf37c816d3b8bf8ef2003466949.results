In 2000, 578 people from ten villages were examined using ultrasound. The mean age of participants was 29.8 years (range 4-61 years). Half (51%) were female (Table 1) . Most adults ($18 years) were farmers (91%) and had no formal schooling beyond elementary school (59%). Participants were similar in terms of occupation, educational attainment and 2000 infection status to the 1,333 residents in these villages who participated in infection and demographic surveys only, although cohort members were slightly older than the rest of the population (mean age 29.8 vs. 28.2, p = 0.037). We conducted ultrasound examinations with 444 people in 2002 and 321 people in 2005. The 320 people with complete ultrasound follow-up were no more likely to be infected with S. japonicum at enrollment than those who missed at least one followup examination, but they were older (mean age 33.0 vs. 25.6, p,0.001) and more likely to have at least one liver abnormality in 2000 (57% vs. 37%, p,0.001). Nearly half (47%) of participants tested positive for S. japonicum in 2000. Mean infection intensity was 53.4 EPG. In 2002, infection prevalence declined to 32% and intensity to 9.4 EPG. As shown in Table 2 , adults aged 50 and older were less likely to be infected than younger participants. Neither sex nor occupation was associated with infection prevalence, but among adults, higher educational attainment was protective. Infection prevalence in 2002 was significantly higher among those who were infected vs. uninfected in 2000 despite the distribution of treatment to everyone who tested positive (41% vs. 23%, p,0.001). Infection prevalence varied significantly by village. Table 3 describes the prevalence of liver parenchymal fibrosis, periportal fibrosis and abnormal liver and spleen measurements from 2000 to 2005. Following the initiation of schistosomiasis testing and treatment of all infections in 2000, parenchymal fibrosis, periportal fibrosis and right liver lobe enlargement decreased significantly through 2005, controlling for age and sex (Table 4 ). Decreases in spleen enlargement were also observed, although the trend was of marginal significance (p = 0.091). Liver abnormalities increased significantly with age, most notably for parenchymal fibrosis (Table 4 ). Spleen enlargement was not associated with age. Individuals aged 18 to 29 years had the highest odds of spleen vein dilation. The relationship between liver abnormalities and sex varied: men were more likely to have periportal fibrosis and enlarged right liver lobes; women were more likely to have enlarged left liver lobes. Schistosomiasis infection at the time of ultrasound was associated with an increase in liver parenchymal fibrosis grade (OR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.03-1.90) adjusting for age, sex and year of ultrasound (Table 5) . Infection intensity at the time of ultrasound was also associated with an increase in liver parenchymal fibrosis grade (test for trend: p = 0.002). Individuals with greater than 50 EPG had 2.10 times greater odds of more advanced fibrosis than those not excreting eggs (95% CI: 1.33-3.32). Schistosomiasis infection two to three years prior to ultrasound was associated with an increase in liver parenchymal fibrosis grade, and the association was stronger than that of current infection (OR 1.84, 95% CI: 1.30-2.60). Prior infection intensity was also associated with liver parenchymal fibrosis (test for trend, p,0.001). Individuals with greater than 50 EPG two to three years prior to the ultrasound examination had 2.84 times greater odds of advanced fibrosis than those not excreting eggs two to three years prior to ultrasound (95% CI: 1.71-4.73). The other hepatosplenic ultrasound measures were not associated with current infection status or intensity. Several measures were associated with prior infection, although the relationships were not as consistent as those observed for periportal fibrosis. Prior infection appeared to elevate the probability of left liver lobe enlargement (OR 1. (Table 6 ). However, this was not the case for parenchymal fibrosis: 67% of people with grade 2 fibrosis and 100% with grade 3 fibrosis in 2000 remained at or above grade 2 throughout the five-year follow-up.
