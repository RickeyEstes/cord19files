Isolation of Huh-7-derived Cell Lines Resistant to Brefeldin A BFA-resistant cells were selected by cultivating Huh-7 cells in the presence of low doses of BFA. Most of the cells died in less than a week. Cells that survived were grown and passaged in the continuous presence of BFA for at least 2 months before characterization. Seven independent cell lines (named R1 to R7) were selected (table 1). The toxicity of BFA was assessed by measuring the cell viability after a 24 h-incubation in the presence of increasing concentrations of the drug. Cellular viability of Huh-7 cells decreased in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml of BFA or higher doses (figure 1). In two of the selected cell lines (R1 and R2), cells showed only a partial decrease (<25%) of viability at the concentration of 10 mg/ml of BFA, with no impact of the lower doses (figure 1). For the other cell lines (R3-R7), the resistance to BFA was intermediate between those of parental Huh-7 cells and of resistant R1 and R2 cells. Their viability was reduced for the concentrations of 1 mg/ml and 10 mg/ml of BFA, with little or no effect of the concentration 0.1 mg/ml, even for the R4 cell line, which had been selected with a 50 ng/ml BFA concentration (figure 1). As expected, BFA had no effect on growth of MDCK cells [39, 40] , which were used as a control in this experiment. These results allowed us to divide resistant cell lines into 2 groups depending on their degree of resistance to BFA. Cells of group 1 (R1 and R2) were more than 100 times more resistant to growth inhibition by BFA than Huh-7, and cells of group 2 (R3 to R7) were about 10 times more resistant.
