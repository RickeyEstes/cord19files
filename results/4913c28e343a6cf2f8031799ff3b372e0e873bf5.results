Structural Overview. There are two protein molecules in an asymmetric unit. The two molecules form a typical homodimer (Fig. 1a) , which has been observed in the crystal structures of other CoV M pro s 48, 52, 53 . Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of M pro homodimer in solution which is also the only active form of the enzyme [56] [57] [58] [59] , supporting the physiological relevance of structural findings. A structural comparison of protomer A in M pro -N3 complex with that in apo enzyme (PDB ID: 3TLO; C. P. Chuck & K. B. Wong, unpublished work) revealed an overall architecture of three domains (Fig. 1b) in each protomer, a common feature among CoV M pro structures. Domain I (residues 8-100) and domain II (residues 101-183) together form a chymotrypsin-like fold, and the substrate-binding site is located in a cleft formed between domain I and domain II. The catalytic dyad composed of Cys144 and His41 lies in the center of substrate-binding site. Domain III (residues 200-303) of HCoV-NL63 M pro is composed of a globular antiparallel Î± -helical cluster, a unique feature of CoV M pro that is required for homodimer formation. Domain III is connected to domain II through a long loop region of 16 residues. X-ray data-processing and refinement statistics are included in Table 1 .
