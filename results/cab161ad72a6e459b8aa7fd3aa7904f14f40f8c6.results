Of 1598 children with positive virus cultures, adenovirus alone was identified in 661 specimens (41.4%). Other viruses identified are listed in the Supplementary material (Table S2 ). Further genotyping by PCR was possible in 637 patients who had adequate specimens, most of which were obtained by throat swab (616/632; 97.5%; see Supplementary material, Table S3 ). After excluding five cases with multiple genotypes, a total of 632 cases were included for further analysis. Only three genotypes were identified, with HAdV-3 (429/632; 67.6%) being the most common, followed by HAdV-7 (144/632; 22.6%) and HAdV-2 (59/632; 9.8%). Of the 621 patients (98.3%) hospitalized, 75 (12%) had defined LRTIs, 20 (3.2%) required intensive care, and three (0.5%) eventually died (Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 . Flow chart describing case selection. a Patients excluded due to insufficient samples. b HAdV-2, -3 and -7, human adenovirus type 2, 3, and 7. c LRTI, lower respiratory tract infection; PICU, paediatric intensive care unit. d LRTI patients (14/75) exhibiting severe respiratory distress. e These patients included three with neurological dysfunction, two suffering from shock, and one with massive bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.
