Patient demographics. A total of 2,462 prospectively collected, 446 retrospectively collected, and 327 contrived samples were eligible for testing with the ePlex RP panel. Approximately 67% of samples were collected with Copan-manufactured UTM (universal transport medium), and 33% were collected with Remel M4 or M5 medium. Demographic information for the evaluable prospectively and retrospectively collected subject samples is provided in Table 1 . Approximately 50% of the subjects were male, with median ages of 33 years for subjects with prospectively collected samples and 5 years for subjects with retrospectively collected samples. The prevalences of ePlex RP panel targets by age group during the two phases of prospective collection are provided in Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material. Assay performance. (i) Accuracy. Of the 3,235 samples eligible for testing with the ePlex RP panel, 154 had invalid results (4.8%). After repeat testing, 8 samples were not evaluable due to final, invalid results (7 prospective samples and 1 contrived sample). The final validity rate was 99.8% (95% CI, 99.5% to 99.9%). The ePlex RP panel detected a potential respiratory pathogen in 1,212 of 2,462 prospectively collected NPS specimens tested, for a positivity rate of 49%. The PPAs and NPAs with 95% CIs of the ePlex RP panel targets with comparator methods are provided in Tables 2 to 4 separately for retrospectively collected samples and prospectively collected samples and with all samples combined. Additional data for fresh and frozen prospectively collected samples are presented in Table S3 in the supplemental material. The overall percent agreement between the ePlex RP and BioFire RP results was Ͼ95% for all targets tested. target but positive for either the 2009 H1 (n ϭ 5) or H3 (n ϭ 1) subtype, and 9 samples were positive for the influenza A virus target without a subtype being identified. Of note, influenza A H1 virus was not detected, and very few Chlamydia pneumoniae (n ϭ 4) isolates were detected during the study period. For these targets, at least 50 specimens with the pathogen spiked into negative NPS specimens were contrived; all were detected by ePlex RP (data not shown). Discordance resolution results (Table 5 ) demonstrate that while ePlex RP had a high level of agreement with the BioFire RP and detected the same targets in nearly all samples, each assay detected targets that the other did not. In Table 5 , samples with targets that were detected by ePlex RP but not detected by BioFire RP (FP) are counted as true-positive samples if the target was detected by discordance testing (TPd). Samples with targets not detected by ePlex RP but detected by the BioFire RP (FN) are counted as true-negative samples if the target was not detected by discordance testing (TNd). Given the number of discordant samples between the two panels for coronavirus detection, additional repeat testing by both the BioFire RP and ePlex RP was performed as part of the discordance analysis. This additional testing demonstrated evidence of Of the 2,462 prospectively collected samples, 164 had codetections by at least one of the assays (data not shown). The ePlex RP panel identified a total of 135 prospective samples with multiple pathogens detected, or 5.5% of all prospectively collected samples, while the BioFire RP detected a total of 116 samples with multiple pathogens, or 4.7% of all prospectively collected samples. Of the 135 samples with multiple pathogens detected by ePlex RP, 118 (4.8%) had two pathogens, 14 (0.6%) had three pathogens, and 3 (0.1%) had four pathogens detected. Of the 135 samples with codetections, 57 samples (2.3%) included one or more pathogens that were not detected by the BioFire RP method. The comparator method identified a total of 32 (1.3%) codetections with one or more pathogens not identified by the ePlex RP panel. Discordance resolution results are included in the analysis presented in Table 5 . (ii) Reproducibility. Each of 3 sites performing the reproducibility study collected 35 to 36 results for each target at each concentration, for a total of 107 to 108 samples per site. For the moderately positive and the negative panels, the percent agreement was 100% (95% CI, 96.6% to 100%) for all 7 panel targets. For the low-positive panel, the percent agreement was 100% (95% CI, 96.5% to 100%) for 6 of the 7 panel targets. For the remaining adenovirus panel target, the percent agreement in the low-positive panel was 91.6% (95% CI, 84.8% to 95.5%). Agreement results are shown in Table 6 . A total of 315/324 (97.2%) samples yielded a valid result upon initial testing. Upon repeat testing, all but one specimen yielded a valid result, for a final validity rate of 99.7% (95% CI: 98.3% to 99.9%). No significant sources of variability were found for any of the targets on the panel across cartridge lots, operation days, technologists/operators, or sites (data not shown). Workflow and turnaround time study. The time to identification from receipt to result was determined to be 1 h 45 min and 57 s, with hands-on times (HOTs) per sample of 1 min and 35 s.
