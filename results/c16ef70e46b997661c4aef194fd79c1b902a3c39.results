We identified 560,225 citations on ten different pathogens ( We found that the number of citations to S. aureus increased from 156 in 1963 to 5314 in 2014 (Fig. 1 ). There was a distinct increase in the number of citations per 1000 PubMed citations to S. aureus in the period from 1975-1985 and again between 2001 and 2012 (Fig. 1b) . The second rise in the relative number of S. aureus publications appears to be due primarily to an increase in citations to MRSA (Fig. 1a) . In a qualitative assessment of the trends in annual citations to the studied pathogens, we noticed two distinct patterns, which we have used to classify Type I and Type II pathogens. Type I pathogens ( Fig. 2 Table 1 for search criteria HIV/AIDS and Lyme disease. The Type I pattern is characterized by an initial exponential growth in relative citations that mirrored the initial increase in incidence or mortality from the pathogen. WNV, Chikungunya virus and avian influenza showed citation curves similar to the Type I pathogen epidemic curves; however, they are re-emergent and thus referred to as Type Ia (Fig. 3) , with an increase in relative citations beginning at the time of the re-emergence of the pathogen. For avian influenza, however, although the citation curve has a Type Ia pattern, there was no sudden epidemic of human infections caused by avian influenza strains during 2003-2006, but rather there was an increase in awareness and increase in the level of funding and surveillance worldwide for human infections with these strains [11] [12] [13] .
