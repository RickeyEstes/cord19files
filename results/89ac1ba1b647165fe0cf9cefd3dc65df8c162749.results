Toxicological study of GL in liver and fibroblast cells Cytotoxic effects of GL was analyzed after 24 h incubation of Huh-7 and CHO cells with the concentration of 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 μg/ml. Cell viability was evaluated using a viability dye and counting the cells through haemocytometer. Figure 1 shows cytotoxicity analysis of GL and demonstrates that Huh7 and CHO cells viability is unaffected up to a concentration of 100 μg. However, when exceeds from 100 μg, toxic effect in liver and fibroblast cells were observed. The data verified by microscopic examination of cells and MTT cell proliferation assay demonstrate that GL has no toxic effect at 100 μg concentration (data not shown).
