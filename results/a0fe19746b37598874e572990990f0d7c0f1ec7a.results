A total of 4778 febrile infants were enrolled in the parent study. Of these, 3072 (64.3%) had viral testing performed. A total of 578 patients had single viral tests performed on, 2186 had testing for 3 or more viruses, and 1515 had comprehensive respiratory panel testing. We were able to ascertain viral test results and SBI status in 2945 of the 3072 febrile infants (95.9%), and these 2945 infants were included in the analysis. There were 1706 infants who did not have viral testing performed and, among these, we were able to ascertain SBI status in 1637 (nonanalytic cohort). The overall rate of SBI in this virusnot tested cohort was 177 of the 1637 (10.8%; 95% CI, 9.3%-12.4%). The mean age of the 2945 infants evaluated in this secondary analysis was 34.1 ± 0.3 days. The mean temperature was 38.5°C ± 0.01°C. There were 1092 infants (37.1%) who were 28 days of age or younger. The characteristics of virus-positive and virus-negative infants are described in Table I . Virusnegative infants were more likely to be 28 days of age or younger and to have a higher mean white blood cell count and ANC count than viral-positive infants. Table II describes the various types of viral tests that were performed on enrolled patients across the participating EDs.
