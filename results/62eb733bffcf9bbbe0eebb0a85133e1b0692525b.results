The 13 control BSE-free animals from the BSE pathogenesis study did not exhibit any significant gross findings on post-mortem examination. Neurological disease, including primary gastrointestinal motility problems, was diagnosed in nine of 41 cattle submitted for post-mortem examination to the UVH and was categorized as: problems with motility such as vagal indigestion, regurgitation, volvulus, caecal dilatation and torsion (n ¼ 5) and megaoesophagus (n ¼ 2), suspect botulism (n ¼ 1) and chronic nonsuppurative encephalitis (n ¼ 1). Other postmortem diagnoses included peritonitis (n ¼ 8), enteritis (n ¼ 6), pneumonia (n ¼ 6), systemic infection (n ¼ 6) (including vena cava thrombosis [n ¼ 1] and endocarditis [n ¼ 1]), arthritis (n ¼ 3), multicentric lymphoma (n ¼ 1), ragwort poisoning (n ¼ 1) and craniofacial anomalies related to the mandible (n ¼ 1). Histopathological changes seen in the various ganglia are listed in Table 1 . The cranial cervical ganglion, the most frequently sampled ganglion (n ¼ 53), displayed the most changes. The ganglion consisted of medium sized neurons arranged with moderate density. The satellite cells were irregular and loosely distributed throughout the section (Fig. 1) . The ganglia from young animals appeared more cellular than the ganglia from older animals. Dark shrunken angular neurons, interpreted as a handling artefact (Fig. 1) , were scattered throughout the sections affecting <5% of the neurons. However, in 27/53 sections >5% of the neurons were affected and these were often distributed at the periphery of the ganglion. Sporadic intraneuronal vacuoles, up to 14 per section examined, were seen in 18/53 cranial cervical ganglia. Occasionally, the vacuoles contained proteinaceous material. One cow (C29) with severe liver fibrosis due to ragwort poisoning had 14 vacuolated neurons (Fig. 2) ; another cow (C45) with a diagnosis of septic arthritis had seven vacuolated neurons. Peripheral neuronal vacuolation was seen in 15/53 cranial cervical ganglia affecting up to 15 neurons. Central chromatolysis, confirmed with cresyl violet stain, was a feature of 17 ganglia with up to 35% of neurons affected. In 13 ganglia <9% of neurons were affected and in four ganglia >20% of neurons were affected (Figs. 3 and 4) . The nucleus was located towards the periphery of the cell bodies and sometimes appeared pyknotic. In contrast, peripheral chromatolysis was seen in only four ganglia and in two of these only 2% of neurons were affected and in two others 10% and 15% of neurons were affected. Other features included mild to moderate intraneuronal PAS-positive lipofuscin accumulation (10/ 53) and spheroids (8/53). Satellitosis was seen sporadically surrounding up to four large neurons (15/53). In 10 of these ganglia, single to multiple glial nodules were also observed and an association with mild to moderate inflammation was found in six. CD3 labelling showed few T lymphocytes intermixed with the satellite cells. Mild (n ¼ 10) and moderate (n ¼ 7) inflammation was observed in the cranial cervical ganglion. The inflammation consisted mainly of multifocal infiltration of mononuclear cells, including CD3 + and CD79a + lymphocytes, macrophages and plasma cells, often infiltrating subcapsular and perivascular stroma and occasionally the parenchyma. Neuronophagia of one or two neurons, with neuronal necrosis, was found in two ganglia that showed concurrent inflammation. The trigeminal ganglion contains the cell bodies of afferent sensory trigeminal fibres. It typically consisted of densely packed large neurons surrounded by concentrically arranged fibrils and one to multiple layers of satellite cells with oval to elongate vesiculated nuclei with chromatin clumping and prominent small nucleoli (Fig. 5) . Occasionally, circular aggregates of satellite cells were present, denoting the location of neurons. Thirteen trigeminal ganglia were sampled from the healthy group. The main change found in this ganglion was sporadic intraneuronal vacuolation (8/13) affecting only up to two neurons per section. Within the vacuoles, proteinaceous material was occasionally evident. Peripheral vacuolation only affected single neurons in four ganglia and a single spheroid was observed in one ganglion. In the vagal nucleus (n ¼ 42) the neurons were large with circular dense satellitosis, but here neurons were embedded in the peripheral nerve tissue singly or in variably-sized groups. Only a few neurons were evident in the majority of sections. The only change observed in vagal ganglia was inflammation (2/42). This was moderate in severity in one section and consisted mainly of perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells and was marked in another ganglion in which there was marked mononuclear cell infiltration and single neuronal necrosis and neuronophagia. In both cases, inflammation was also seen in other autonomic ganglia from the same animal. Within the endoneurium of nerves adjacent to these ganglia there were multifocal nodules of loosely and concentrically arranged elongated cells separated by basophilic mucinous material, characteristic of Renaut bodies. These bodies were seen mainly in the vagal nerve (7/42). In one heifer (C13) with ulcerative ruminitis, Renaut bodies were observed in the peripheral nerves of all four autonomic ganglia examined. In the middle cervical ganglion, regular circular dense satellitosis was a normal feature (n ¼ 8). The only change observed was mild inflammation in one case (C47) with lungworm infestation consisting of a single perivascular granuloma. Inflammation was also observed in other autonomic ganglia examined from this case. The normal morphology in the cervicothoracic ganglion was similar to that observed in the cranial cervical ganglion. More than 5% of angular shrunken neurons were only present in three out of the 19 sampled ganglia. Single intraneuronal vacuoles were observed (3/19). Interestingly, single neuronal vacuoles were seen in other ganglia from the same three animals. Peripheral neuronal vacuolation affecting one to five neurons was present in five ganglia. The following changes were detected in few of these ganglia: central chromatolysis affecting only 2% of neurons (2/19), mild to moderate lipofuscin accumulation (3/19) and three spheroids per section in two ganglia. An increase in satellite cells was seen in seven ganglia, surrounding up to seven neurons per section and was often associated with marked inflammatory changes and gliosis in the section (6/7). Mild (4/19), moderate (2/19) or marked (4/19) inflammation was the most frequent change observed in cervicothoracic ganglia (Figs. 6 and 7). In four of these sections, neuronal necrosis and neuronophagia of sporadic single neurons was also observed (Fig. 8) . Other changes seen in the interstitium were haemosiderophages (Perl's Prussian blue positive; n ¼ 5), mild oedema (n ¼ 2) and Renaut bodies (n ¼ 1). The cranial mesenteric ganglion (n ¼ 21) appeared morphological similar to the cranial cervical ganglion. Most changes were observed in only few ganglia and included features such as >5% of angular shrunken neurons (3/21), single intraneuronal vacuoles (3/21), central chromatolysis affecting only 1% of neurons (2/21) and satellitosis (1/21) associated with marked inflammation. Perineuronal vacuolation affected one to three neurons and was seen in five ganglia. Spheroids were observed sporadically in four ganglia, but in one clinically normal control animal (C44) about 12 spheroids were seen. Inflammation was again the most common lesion observed (n ¼ 8) and was associated with neurono-phagia in five sections. In the most severe case (C45) with septic arthritis, the inflammatory infiltrate obliterated half of the section. Eosinophils were seen sporadically in one cow (C47) with severe lungworm infection. The morphology of the caudal mesenteric ganglion resembled the pattern of the cranial cervical ganglion. Only few changes were observed in the 12 ganglia examined, such as >5% of angular shrunken neurons (3/12), neuronal vacuolation (1/12) and lipofuscin accumulation (1/12). Satellitosis in the absence of inflammation was seen in two ganglia. In two cases systemic disease involved the ganglia. One heifer (C26) with multicentric lymphoma showed infiltration of large lymphoblasts into the interstitium in all ganglia examined. Another heifer (C21) with systemic pyogranulomas and vasculitis showed a single arteriole with fibrinoid degeneration of the wall in the connective tissue surrounding the cranial cervical ganglion. A total of 18 ganglia from 18 animals were analysed by PCR and revealed a negative result for BHV1, BPI3, BRSV and pan-herpesvirus DNA. The majority of changes were analysed for their relationship to age and their correlations with disease (Table 1) . Mild to moderate intraneuronal lipofuscin accumulation was found in animals ranging in age from 3 to 120 months (mean 59.1 AE 35 months), which were significantly older than cattle without lipofuscin accumulation (P <0.05). In contrast, central chromatolysis was seen significantly more often in younger cattle ranging in age from 10 days to 66 months (mean 28.18 AE 21.64 months) (P <0.05). Inflammation generally occurred in animals >22 months of age, with only one calf (C16) affected at 1 month of age; however, this age relationship was not significant (P ¼ 0.082). Neuronal and peripheral vacuolation, central chromatolysis, lipofuscin accumulation, spheroids, satellitosis, inflammation and Renaut bodies were observed equally in healthy control animals and in diseased cattle. Ganglia from cattle with neurological disease, including motility problems of the gastrointestinal tract (n ¼ 9), showed no significant increase in the occurrence of inflammation (P ¼ 0.902) or Renaut bodies (P ¼ 0.222). Central chromatolysis and neuronal vacuolation were seen in only one of these nine cases. Two cattle (C20, C43) were diagnosed with the rare condition of megaoesophagus. One of these animals (C43) had malformation of the right occipital bone with cranial nerve deficits and unilateral agenesis of the cranial cervical ganglion. The other (C20) had central chromatolysis in the cranial cervical ganglion.
