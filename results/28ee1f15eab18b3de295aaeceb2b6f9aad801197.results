Polypeptide specificity of mono&ma1 antibodies to MHV.4. The polypeptide specificity of monoclonal antibodies against MHV-4 was initially characterized by immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled viral proteins from infected cell extracts (Collins et a& 1982) . While specificities could be assigned based upon the predominant polypeptide in immunoprecipitates, coprecipitation of other viral polypeptides was occasionally observed. These ambiguities were eliminated by the immunoblotting technique, as illustrated in Fig. 1A . Monoclonal antibodies to the E2 glycoprotein reacted with virus-specific polypeptides migrating at approximately 100, 160, and 230K, as well as with high molecular weight aggregates which did not penetrate separating gels (Wege et aL, 1979; Siddell et aL, 1981 , 1984) . Enzp,w immunoassay of MAb to MHV-4 glycoproteim. Comparative studies indicated that a membrane-enriched fraction prepared from virus-infected cells provided the optimal antigen source and that all antibodies showed binding characteristics to the antigen preparation equivalent to their binding to purified virions (Talbot and Salmi, unpublished, 1983) . The minimum antigen concentration (0.5 pg total protein per well) which provided maximum antibody binding with all of the three classes of antibodies examined was selected and used throughout this study (Fig. 2) . Binding characteristics of MAb to MHV-4 glycoproteins were determined by parallel solid-phase EIA titrations using a single antigen preparation. Binding curves of typical antibodies are presented in Fig. 3 . Most antibodies appeared to bind with high avidity to the viral glycoproteins since the maximal level of measurable binding was reached (Frankel and Gerhard, 1979; Stone and Nowinski, 1980; Massey and Schochetman, 1981) . Molecular topography of epitopes on MHV-4 glycoproteins by competitim binding EIA. Our initial attempts to define the topography of antigenic sites on the MHV-4 glycoproteins made use of conventional solid-phase competitive radioimmunoassay with radioiodinated MAb. However, the binding efficiencies of many of the purified MAb were diminished following radiolabeling. On the other hand, most of our MAb retained their binding properties when conjugated to peroxidase (Wilson and Nakane, 19'78) , thus allowing the use of a sensitive enzyme-linked immunoassay format. Monoclonal antibodies to MHV-4 described in Table 1 conjugates obtained for each MAb. Conjugates with lower EIA titers were added at higher concentration and their binding could be inhibited to a lesser extent by unconjugated homologous antibodies, thus decreasing the sensitivity of the assay. For that reason, some conjugates did not provide reliable probes in competition binding assays. Nevertheless, all the available antibodies were tested as unconjugated competing antibodies. Figure 4D shows the absence of nonspecific blocking in our competition binding assay since none of the glycoprotein antibodies inhibited the binding of an antibody probe to the N protein. Two major antigenic regions could be distinguished on the small glycoprotein El (Fig. 4) . One site, designated C(El), was defined by the monoclonal antibody 5B128.3. None of the other MAb tested (five against El, eight against E2, and three against N) blocked the binding of the probe; only homologous inhibition was observed (Fig. 4C) . Another site was defined by El antibodies 5B119.4, 5A5.2, and 5B11.5, which showed intermediate levels of reciprocal competition (Figs. 4A and B ). This intermediate blocking could indicate structurally close and possibly overlapping epitopes which generated mutual incomplete steric hindrance upon antibody binding. Hence, we assigned epitope A(E1) to the MAb 5B119.4 and epitope B(E1) to 5A5.2 to stress this uncertainty. The target epitope of 5B11.5 could not be precisely assigned since reliable HRP-conjugated probes of this antibody were not obtained and inhibition of both 5B119.4 and 5A5.2 conjugates was observed. Four antigenic sites could be assigned to the large glycoprotein E2 (Fig. 5) . Site A(E2) was defined by two antibodies, 5B19. (-) or control (---) L-24 cells. Control curves were obtained for each antibody and showed minimal deviations from the mean curve shown here. Bound antibodies were detected with HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig, as described in the text. Immunoglobulin concentration (pg) represents the total amount of unconjugated antibodies added. glycoprotein (Figs. 5A and B) . Sites B and C(E2) were respectively defined by antibodies 5A13.5 and 4B11.6 and only homologous blocking was observed at those antigenic determinants (Figs. 5C and D) . Site D(E2) was defined by the four nonneutralizing antibodies which could not compete for antibody binding at sites A, B, or C(E2) (data not shown).
