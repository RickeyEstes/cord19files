Cases detected in the UK, France, Italy, and Tunisia caused seven secondary cases in those countries (appendix). We estimated the mean of the incubation period distribution as 5·5 (95% CI 3·6-10·2) and the SD as 2·5 (95% CI 1·2-11·6) days (fi gure 1A), compatible with results from a study by Assiri and colleagues. 3 This fi nding suggests the mean generation time, T G , is unlikely to be shorter than 7 days. For the six clusters (in France, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the UK) for which full data on symptom onset dates are available, the lower bound for T G has a mean of 10·7 (95% CI 6·5-19·4) days and an SD of 6·3 (95% CI 3·5-16·9) days (fi gure 1B). In the following, we therefore explore values of T G in the range 7-12 days, while fi xing the coeffi cient of variation of the generation time at 0·45, based on estimates found for SARS. 16 From the distribution of cluster sizes (average 2·7; range 1-26), and consistent with a study by Breban and colleagues, 14 we estimated that R averaged across all cases in detected clusters (R cluster ) was 0·63 (0·47-0·85). We also found a trend for a reduction of cluster size with time: 11 of 21 (52%; 95% CI 30-74) clusters were single case clusters before June 1, 2013, as opposed to 16 of 19 (84%, 60-97) after June 1, 2013 (p=0·07), leading to R cluster dropping from 0·74 (95% CI 0·53-1·03) before June 1, 2013 to 0·32 (95% CI 0·14-0·65) after June 1, 2013. These changes could be explained by faster detection of cases and introduction of controls: the median delay from fi rst See Online for appendix onset in the cluster to reporting of the cluster moved from 23 days before June 1, 2013 (n=14) to 8 days (n=4) after June 1, 2013. The estimate of R cluster indicates that transmission is not self-sustaining in man once control measures are in place. The reproduction number of cluster index cases (R index ) was expected to be less aff ected by control measures because of the delay between onset in the index case to the detection of the case and implementation of controls. This was particularly the case before June 1, 2013, when 93% (13 of 14) of delays from onset to reporting of cluster were 16 days or longer. Analysis of clusters with complete symptom information on this time period gave R index =1·25 (95% CI 1·00-1·50) for T G =12 days and R index =0·83 (95% CI 0·67-1·08) for T G =7 days. A sensitivity analysis gave central estimates in the range 0·8-1·1 (appendix). Figure 1C presents temporal trends in infection incidence using epidemiological data on reported cases and clusters. The analysis of observed cluster incidence over time indicates a doubling time of 90 (95% CI 65-133) days. The phylogeny showed substantial diversity, with sequences obtained from September, 2012, onwards falling into a single clade, and two older sequences forming a distinct outgroup (fi gure 1D). The TMRCA for all seven sequences was June 27, 2011 (95% CI Sept 25, 2010-Nov 8, 2011), whereas that for the recent clade of fi ve isolates (clade 2) was June 11, 2012 (April 24, 2012-July 18, 2012). The independent estimate of doubling time of the viral population in the recent clade (clade 2) is 41 days (95% CI 17-234). Using a best estimate of a mean 4 day stay for returning non-resident traveller cases (appendix), we estimated a total of 940 (95% CI 290-2200) symptomatic cases occurred in residents of these countries up to the end of Aug 8, 2013. Using available MERS-CoV genetic sequences the median estimate of cumulative infections (in man and in the reservoir) that occurred between June, 2012 (the TMRCA of the recent clade), and Aug 8, 2013, is 5640 (IQR 780-55 430). In deriving these estimates, we assumed a single generation time distribution, meaning the estimates were valid either if human-to-human transmission was self-sustaining and human infections therefore predominated, or if generation times in any animal reservoir were similar to those in man-in which case the estimates represented total infections in man and the animal reservoir. On its own, a purely genetic analysis with few sequences can say little about the species within which sequence evolution is occurring, and, as a result, diff erent scenarios for MERS-CoV are possible. The two older sequences could represent independent introductions of the virus from an animal reservoir, whereas the more recent clade could represent sustained human-to-human transmission. Alternatively, the growth could be generated by an epidemic in an animal reservoir, with associated increasing incidence of spill-over infections in human beings. Irrespective of the scenario, we can use estimates of doubling times to derive an upper bound for R. Under the assumption that growth outside detected clusters is driven by human-to-human transmission, R would remain close to 1: for T G =12, R=1·21 (95% CI 1·02-1·53) from an analysis of the fi ve more recent sequences and R=1·10 (95% CI 1·06-1·13) from the timing of incident clusters; for T G =7, R=1·12 (95% CI 1·01-1·29) from an analysis of the fi ve more recent sequences and R=1·06 (95% CI 1·04-1·08) from the timing of incident clusters. We obtained similar estimates from the timing of incident cases (appendix). Figure 2 shows possible epidemic trajectories of animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission for diff erent values of R for T G =12 days. The proportion of human-to-human infections was about 30% for R=0·3 and close to 100% for R greater than 1 (fi gure 2D). Assessment of the probability that current chains of transmission will be sustained into the future (fi gure 2E, appendix) showed that if R was greater than 1, then human-to-human transmission was likely to have already reached a degree in which extinction by chance was improbable. The analysis also confi rmed that R was small (R≤1·17 for T G =12 and R≤1·10 for T G =7 days; appendix), but could not discriminate robustly between scenarios in which the virus was self-sustaining in man and scenarios in which it was not. Our conclusion that case ascertainment had been low to date also received some support from analysis of the line list (appendix). Routine surveillance is likely to be biased towards the detection of more severe cases so that the case-fatality ratio estimated from these cases might be a substantial overestimate. We expect secondary cases detected via enhanced surveillance of case contacts to constitute a more representative sample of cases in general. Of those patients with a known outcome (fatal or recovered), 14 of 19 (74%; 95% CI 49-91) patients with infection detected through routine surveillance and fi ve of 24 (21%; 7-42) patients representing secondary cases died (relative risk [RR]=3·54; 95% CI 1·55-8·07; p=0·003). In patients with a known outcome, the probability of a fatal outcome was 77% (27 of 35; 95% CI 60-90) for those older than the median case age of 50 years; but only 22% (nine of 40; 11-38) for those younger than 50 years (relative risk RR 3·43; 95% CI 1·88-6·26; p=0·0001). In the 56 patients with data about age and about whether they were the fi rst detected case of a cluster, 20 of 23 (87%; 95% CI 66-97) of those aged older than 50 years were the fi rst detected cases as opposed to 11 of 33 cases younger than 50 years (33%; 18-52; RR=2·61; 95% CI 1·57-4·33; p=0·0002). This result was consistent with the hypothesis that cases in older patients were more likely to be severe, and that severe cases were more likely to be detected through routine surveillance. Since June, 2013, we have noted a trend for cases being less likely to be fatal (fi gure 3), but this trend cannot be fully resolved yet because of the uncertainty about those patients who are still in hospital. However, we noted that the diff erence would remain signifi cant even if 70% of those in hospital died (RR 1·71; 95% CI 1·04-2·81; p=0·036). This suggests detection of milder cases (or clinical case management) has improved with time.
