The results of WAD are illustrated in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. Fig. 5 shows the number of significantly elevated ZIP code areas in Texas between the April 23 and May 15 in the evaluation period. In addition, Fig. 6 shows the geographical distribution of the ZIP code areas with significantly elevated thermometers sales from April 25, 2009 to April 30, 2009, using the same color scheme to represent the two significance levels. As shown in both figures, the number of significantly elevated ZIP code areas stayed low (less than 20 ZIP codes) before April 27. From our past experience, the spikes shown in these areas probably resulted from an imperfect data collection process or from some other stochastic reasons (e.g., non-continuous data reporting from some stores) since the spikes are distributed randomly and only last for a day (see Fig. 6 (a), 6(b)). However, starting from April 27, 66 ZIP code areas simultaneously signaled alarms. Furthermore, the thermometer sales stayed significantly high for several days, until around May 7, and the number of significantly elevated ZIP codes exceeded 100 on April 29 and April 30 (in Fig. 6 (cf)). More specifically, the same ZIP codes in the counties Nueces, Travis, Bexar, Collin, Dallas and later El Paso, Bowie, Tarrant and Cameron, repeatedly reported significantly elevated thermometers sales within those days. These results suggest that WAD was able to detect the significant increase on April 27, 2009, by identifying 66 ZIP code areas in about 20 counties showing a significantly elevated amount of thermometer purchases from those drug stores under surveillance. BSS, on the other hand, showed different results from WAD when analyzing the same set of data. The first day BSS fired an alarm was April 30, 2009 which was 3 days later than WAD did. It reported a cluster including 409 out of total 581 ZIP codes with the posterior probabilities above the threshold corresponding to one false alarm per month ( Fig. 7(a) ). The cluster was located in the eastern central part of Texas. On the next day, May 1, 2009, BSS fired the 2 nd alarm with a cluster comprising 272 ZIP codes with significance of one false alarm per two months ( Fig. 7(b) ). Fig. 7 shows that the cluster had become more localized and moved to the southeast. However, during the first 6 days of the real outbreak, from April 24, 2009 to April 29, 2009 , BSS did not identify any significant cluster. It is also worth noting that after May 1, although the counts of thermometers sales were still high, BSS did not fire any alarms at all for the rest of days within the evaluation period (except for May 5, when a 3 ZIP code cluster was found but was believed to be a false alarm).
