Clearance of CTG (type III) parasites in naive macrophages. Macrophages pretreated with IFN-␥/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) are well known to clear intracellular type III parasites efficiently (26) . In order to test their innate ability to control intracellular T. gondii infection in the absence of IFN-␥, unactivated macrophages were infected with type I (GT1 strain) or type III (CTG strain) parasites at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. The cells were fixed at 30 min and 20 h postinfection, and the percentage of infected cells was calculated by automated plate-based imaging to acquire data from many independent microscopic fields (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The percentage of CTG-infected RAW 264.7 macrophages was significantly reduced by Ͼ50% at 20 h compared to 30 min postinfection, whereas the percentage of GT1infected macrophages was unaffected (Fig. 1A) . We observed a similar enhanced clearance of the CTG strain in naive bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), while GT1 survived significantly better (Fig. 1B) . This finding is somewhat surprising, as T. gondii is generally regarded as a pathogen that survives in naive macrophages, owing to its ability to actively invade the host cell and avoid phagocytic responses (4) . Toxoplasma gondii is known to actively invade host cells, including macrophages, and to avoid lysosomal fusion (7) . Hence, we considered that this difference in survival might reflect altered uptake and delivery of parasites to lysosomes. LAMP1 recruitment to parasites was measured to compare relative extents of active invasion and phagocytosis of CTG parasites in macrophages, as described previously (45) . LAMP1 recruitment to vacuoles containing live parasites, representing active invasion, was much less than recruitment to those containing heat-killed, phagocytosed parasites for both GT1 and CTG strains, suggesting that the clearance of CTG was not due to phagocytosis in naive BMDMs (Fig. 1C) . Autophagy has also been implicated in growth restriction of susceptible T. gondii strains, albeit in IFN-␥-activated HeLa cells (23) . Parasites targeted for destruction by this pathway become ubiquitinated, recruit autophagy adapters, and are engulfed by LC3 (23) . Hence, we considered that a similar pathway might be triggered in naive macrophages infected with CTG. However, ubiquitination of the vacuole membrane as detected by the antibody FK2, which recognizes mono-and polyubiquitinated proteins, and recruitment of the LC3 adapter p62 were very low on both parasite strains in naive BMDMs (Fig. 1D) . Additionally, the autophagy-associated marker LAMP2 was not elevated on CTG-containing vacuoles in naive BMDMs (Fig. 1D ). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the susceptibility of type III parasites in naive macrophages is not due to enhanced autophagy or lysosomal clearance. Previous studies on the clearance of T. gondii in IFN-␥-activated macrophages have demonstrated that the clearance mediated by IRGs and GBPs occurs in the first few hours after infection (26, 31) . As such, we examined the kinetics of clearance of CTG parasites in naive BMDMs. We observed that the percentage of infected macrophages started to decrease from 6 to 8 h postinfection and decreased linearly up to 24 h ( Fig. 2A ). As such, the kinetics of clearance differs substantially from previously characterized pathways. We also examined the morphology of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, as previous studies in IFN-␥-activated cells have described a prominent scalloped appearance of the membrane, prior to rupture, in a process that is medicated by IRGs and GBPs (24, 26, 31, 46) . A majority of parasitophorous vacuoles at early time points revealed normal cellular architecture of both the vacuole membrane and the parasite residing within (Fig. 2B ). Over time, there was an accumulation of parasites that showed damage, including loss of the parasitophorous vacuole envelope (Fig. 2C) , blebbing of parasite surface membranes (Fig. 2C) , rupture of the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane with the host cytosol filling the space (Fig. 2D) , and swelling of internal parasite membranes such as the nuclear envelope (Fig. 2D) . However, at no stage did we observe the scalloped appearance of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane that accompanies Irg-mediated clearance. In order to elucidate the mechanism for innate clearance of CTG in naive macrophages, BMDMs from different mutant mice lacking factors involved in intracellular pathogen clearance were examined. Naive BMDMs from mutant mice were infected with CTG strain parasites in vitro, and the survival at 20 h was assessed relative to infection at 0.5 h, as described above. Naive BMDMs lacking nitric oxide production (Nos2 Ϫ/Ϫ ), Irg-mediated defense (IrgM3 Ϫ/Ϫ ), or autophagy protein Atg5 (Atg5 f/f LysMCre) failed to reverse the clearance of CTG strain parasites (Fig. 3) . These findings indicate that nitric oxide production, Irg-mediated defenses, and Atg-related pathways are unlikely to explain the increased susceptibility of CTG in naive mouse macrophages. However, BMDMs lacking gp91 (Nox2 Ϫ/Ϫ ; NADPH oxidase) showed significant loss of CTG clearance compared to wild-type cells (Fig. 3) . The rescue of CTG parasites in Nox2 Ϫ/Ϫ macrophages suggested that their clearance in naive macrophages is dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction. NADPH oxidase mediated ROS production in T. gondii-infected macrophages. NADPH oxidases in phagocytes are well known to produce ROS as a defense mechanism against invading pathogens (47) . Although invasion of human macrophages by T. gondii proceeds without a ROS burst (5), infection of mouse macrophages with T. gondii has been shown to produce early ROS (48) . Therefore, we tested whether CTG versus GT1 infection resulted in elevated ROS production in naive macrophages using luminol-based chemiluminescence. As expected, neither CTG nor GT1 produced ROS as defined by classical respiratory burst in naive RAW 264.7 macrophages (Fig. 4A) or BMDMs (Fig. S2 ). In contrast, incubation of macrophages with zymosan A (ZymA; 50 g/ml), which acts as a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist, produced the expected ROS burst within a few minutes of incubation ( Fig. 4A and S2 ). Treatment of macrophages with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI; 10 M), which acts as an inhibitor of Nox assembly, abrogated the increase observed with ZymA treatment ( Fig. 4A and S2 ), indicating that the observed ROS burst was Nox dependent. These results demonstrate that T. gondii does not trigger activation of the Nox complex in naive mouse macrophages during the initial stages of invasion. To test whether infection induced delayed production of intracellular ROS, we infected RAW 264.7 macrophages with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)labeled parasites and monitored intracellular ROS levels by staining with CellROX deep red. CTG-infected macrophages showed a time-dependent increase in cellular ROS levels that were elevated compared to GT1 (Fig. 4B ). Treatment of RAW 264.7 macro- phages with LPS (100 g/ml, as a positive control) showed similar increases in ROS levels with increasing time (Fig. 4B ). To confirm that the increase in CellROX staining was due to ROS, RAW 264.7 macrophages were pretreated with 2 mM N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and then infected with T. gondii. Pretreatment of macrophages with NAC, which acts as a cellular antioxidant, led to significant decrease of ROS levels in CTG-infected cells at 9 h postinfection, confirming that the increase in CellROX staining was due to ROS (Fig. 4C ). Nox1 ؊/؊ and Nox2 ؊/؊ mice are susceptible to CTG infection. Our findings thus far suggest that increased clearance of CTG is due to elevated ROS production. To confirm this model, we were interested in testing whether the reversal of CTG clearance in Nox2 Ϫ/Ϫ macrophages as shown in Fig. 3 was due to a decrease in ROS production. First, we established that ROS production upon CTG infection was also evident in wild-type BMDMs at 9 h postinfection and that it was reversed in NAC-pretreated macrophages (Fig. 5A) . Consistent with the above-described model, ROS levels produced in CTG-infected Nox1 Ϫ/Ϫ and Nox2 Ϫ/Ϫ macrophages were significantly lower than what was observed in wild-type cells (Fig. 5B ). This finding suggested that both Nox isoforms are involved in ROS production in BMDMs infected with CTG. Consistent with this finding, CTG infection was significantly rescued in NAC-pretreated wild-type Representative images are shown to the right depicting CellROX (Cy5, red), parasites (CFSE, green), and nuclei (Hoechst stain, blue).

Moreover, clearance of CTG was also significantly decreased in both Nox1 Ϫ/Ϫ and Nox2 Ϫ/Ϫ macrophages compared to wild-type cells (Fig. 5C) . Nonetheless, these findings demonstrate that CTG infection of naive macrophages leads to increased intracellular ROS that depends on both Nox1 and Nox2 isoforms that contribute to parasite clearance.

The loss of CTG clearance in Nox-deficient macrophages in vitro suggested that this response might also be responsible for control of parasites in vivo. To examine this possibility, wild-type C57BL/6, Nox1 Ϫ/Ϫ , and Nox2 Ϫ/Ϫ mice were challenged by intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection and monitored over time. Infection in Gr1 ϩ -F4/80 ϩ cells, which represent inflammatory macrophages recruited during the early phase of infection (49) , was monitored by flow cytometry. There was a significant increase of 3-to 7-fold in the percentage of CTG-infected Gr1 ϩ -F4/80 ϩ cells in Nox1 Ϫ/Ϫ and Nox2 Ϫ/Ϫ mice compared to wild type (Fig. 5D) , consistent with these mutants being less able to control early infection. In contrast, there was a higher percentage of GT1-infected Gr1 ϩ -F4/80 ϩ cells, consistent with the intrinsic virulence of this strain (26) , and this decreased only slightly in mutant mice compared to wild type, likely due to a higher influx of macrophages. The increased expansion of CTG in inflammatory macrophages from Nox-deficient mice at early time points also led to different outcomes of infection. Notably, Nox1 Ϫ/Ϫ and Nox2 Ϫ/Ϫ mice were significantly more susceptible than the wild-type mice to i.p. infection with CTG as shown by decreased survival (Fig. 5E ). Brains were harvested from surviving mice after 60 days of infection for evaluation of chronic infection. However, the cyst burden was below the detection threshold limit of~25 cysts/mouse brain in wild-type, Nox1 Ϫ/Ϫ , and Nox2 Ϫ/Ϫ mice. Gbp5 contributes to CTG clearance in naive macrophages. Although the findings above point to a role for ROS, this pathway only partially explains the defect in CTG as NAC treatment of either Nox1 Ϫ/Ϫ or Nox2 Ϫ/Ϫ mutants did not lead to additive effects (Fig. 5C ). As such, we sought other explanations for the enhanced susceptibility of CTG in naive macrophages. Induction of Gbp1 (31) and Gbp2 (32) during T. gondii infection is associated with their recruitment onto the PVM and parasite damage, albeit best characterized in IFN-␥-activated macrophages. However, some Gbps, including Gbp3 and Gbp5, can be expressed in macrophages to a significant level independent of IFN-␥ (32). Therefore, we tested whether any of these factors are induced upon T. gondii infection of macrophages independent of IFN-␥. To our surprise, BMDMs infected with either CTG or GT1 showed significant increase in expression of Gbp2, Gbp5, and Gbp7 mRNA at 20 h postinfection compared to uninfected cells (Fig. 6A ). In particular, Gbp5 mRNA increased up to~40-fold upon T. gondii infection, whereas Gbp2 and Gbp7 mRNA showed an~10-fold increase (Fig. 6A ). Gbp5 protein levels were also increased upon CTG or GT1 infection of naive macrophages, although to a lesser extent than IFN-␥ treatment in wild-type BMDMs (Fig. 6B) . The specificity of the~65-kDa band of Gbp5 was confirmed by its absence in cell lysates of Gbp5 Ϫ/Ϫ BMDMs (Fig. 6C) . Previous studies have implicated Gbp5 in promoting NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and control of intracellular bacteria (33) . ROS production has also been implicated in the NLRP3 inflammasome activation (50) , although the NADPH oxidase complex is not required for inflammasome activation in response to strong agonists like nigericin or ATP (51) . Therefore, we tested whether inflammasome activation occurs upon T. gondii infection of naive macrophages. Initially, we monitored IL-1␤ transcripts and found that infection with T. gondii only slightly altered their levels, while treatment with LPS greatly increased mRNA levels (Fig. S3A) . We then measured IL-1␤ release to the supernatant as a marker of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. There was no significant increase in IL-1␤ secretion of either CTG-or GT1-infected naive macrophages (Fig. S3B) . In contrast, LPS-primed macrophages did show significant secretion of IL-1␤ upon infection with either CTG or GT1 parasites by 20 h postinfection (Fig. S3B) . Release of IL-1␤ was dependent on both LPS pretreatment and infection, consistent with the two-step hypothesis for NLRP3 inflammasome activation (52) . The increase was significantly reduced upon NAC pretreatment of wild-type macrophages or in Gbp5 Ϫ/Ϫ and Nox2 Ϫ/Ϫ macrophages (Fig. S3B) . Caspase-1 activation and its release into the supernatant are another marker for inflammasome activation. However, we also did not observe activated caspase-1 (cleaved 20-kDa caspase-1 fragment) in the supernatant of CTG-or GT1-infected naive or LPS-primed macrophages (Fig. S4) . As expected, treatment with nigericin was able to elicit caspase-1 release in LPS-activated macrophages, and this effect was partially abrogated in Gbp5 Ϫ/Ϫ macrophages (Fig. S4) . Collectively, these findings indicate that infection with T. gondii alone is not sufficient to induce inflammasome activation because priming signals are needed for IL-1␤ mRNA expression, but when combined with LPS, it provides a signal that drives IL-1␤ release. Although this pathway is partially dependent on Gbp5 and ROS, it did not lead to cell death (Fig. S5) . Given the absence of evidence for inflammasome-mediated clearance, we sought evidence that Gbp5 might be directly involved in mediating clearance of CTG in naive cells. Interestingly, CTG clearance in Gbp5 Ϫ/Ϫ macrophages was significantly reversed (Fig. 6D) . Despite evidence that Gbp5 contributes to clearance, we observed only modest evidence for its recruitment to parasitophorous vacuoles containing CTG (3.1% Ϯ 2.4% [mean Ϯ standard deviation {SD}, n ϭ 4] at 9 h postinfection) in naive macrophages (Fig. 6E) . However, Gbp5 recruitment was absent (0%) in either GT1 or CTG parasites expressing the type I ROP18 allele (CTG.ROP18) (Fig. 6E) . Moreover, the clearance of the CTG.ROP18 strain was also significantly less than that of CTG in wild-type BMDMs and was similar to clearance of CTG in Gbp5 Ϫ/Ϫ BMDMs (Fig. 6F) . These findings suggested that ROP18 expression in type I parasites is involved in resisting Gbp5-mediated clearance in naive macrophages to Toxoplasma infection and that Gbp5 can exert its effects in part via mechanisms other than targeting the PV.
