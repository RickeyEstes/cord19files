Eighteen flows fulfilled the inclusion criteria, i.e., were positive to PED at some stage during the study period and had a control batch leaving the sow farms within the previous 14-120 days to the first PED-positive batch (S1 Dataset). Of those 18 flows, 4 sent pigs to nurseries ("nursery flows") and 14 to WF sites ("WF flows"). Only one of the four nursery batches originated from a single sow farm, whereas the other three originated from up to five different sow farms and were commingled in the nursery ("mixed flows"). In contrast, all 14 WF flows originated from one single sow farm (Table 1) . During the four months before the PEDv outbreak, nursery flows produced 23 batches of weaned pigs, with a mean time between batches of 19 days (median = 13 days, range = 3-34 days), whereas 82 batches were produced by the 14 WF flows (between-batch mean and median time of 14 and 15 days, range = 4-63). Median average days on feed was 64 days (interquartile range = 58-69 days) for nursery batches and 66 days for WF batches (IQR = 55-72). Pigs from only 3 of the 82 WF batches weaned before the PED outbreak were on feed for >150 days, with records from the remaining pigs coming from the first stage of a double stocking practice. Those 3 batches were not considered eligible as control/infected batches due to the effect of the longer period on feed on the performance of the pigs. Within the four previous months to the PED outbreak, PRRSv was detected in four of the 18 flows (A, C, E, H) but batches selected as controls from all but one flow (flow C) were already negative. Four case batches were positive for PRRS (flows O, P and Q, in addition to flow C). Before the PEDv outbreak overall mean monthly mortality and FCR ranged between 4.3-4.8% and 1.71-1.89 respectively (Fig. 1) , whereas ADG and ADFI values were between 0.75-0.85 and 1.29-1.62 (data not shown). Analysis of the mortality of the first PED-positive batches on each flow revealed an increase in the mortality up to 14.9% in nursery and 15.5% in WF (Fig. 1) . ADG was lower in WF batches compared with the previous four months, while this effect was not so apparent in nursery pigs, and ADFI observed in the outbreak batches did not increase in WF batches and increased moderately in nursery pigs compared with the values observed in the previous months. As a consequence, a strong increase in the FCR recorded in the infected batches was observed (Fig. 1) . Mortality was significantly (p<0.001) higher in PED-positive batches compared with the control pigs, with an overall mean difference of 12.5% (95% confidence interval = 6.4-18.4) (Fig. 2) . Difference observed in WF pairs was not significantly different from that found in nursery pairs. The difference in mortality between control and infected batches increased for those cases in which control batches left the sow farms in the previous 14-60 days compared with 61-120 days (Fig. 2) . ADG and FCR were significantly worse in case batches, with a 0.16 lb mean decrease of the former (95% CI = 0.07-0.26) (Fig. 3a) and a 0.55 increase in the latter (95% CI = 0.30-0.79) (Fig. 3b) . ADFI remained largely unaffected (p = 0.9). Again, differences observed in WF batches were larger than those observed in nursery pigs, but differences were not significant (p>0.3).
