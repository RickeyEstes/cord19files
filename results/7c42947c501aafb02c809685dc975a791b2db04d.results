Overall, original tweets (n = 567,391) accounted for 50.05% of all tweets collected (n = 1,133,656). As shown in Figure 1 , although the numbers of tweets and retweets were similar during the most active part of the outbreak, retweets outnumbered original tweets mostly in early February during the maintenance stage.

Four distinct frames were identified inductively based on the reading of the semantic networks and tweets containing the key words included in these semantic networks: news update frame, public health frame, vaccine frame, and political frame. The titles of these frames were coined by the authors based on the typical message carried in each frame, similar to the practice described in Odlum and Toon (2015) . 18
