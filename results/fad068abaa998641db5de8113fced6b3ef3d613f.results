Inhibitory effects of clindamycin on growth of P. gulae strains. Clindamycin has been used for the treatment of periodontal disease in dogs 19 . Therefore, we analysed whether clindamycin was effective for P. gulae with each fimA genotype. Growth of all P. gulae strains tested (fimA genotypes A, B, and C) was significantly reduced in the presence of more than 0.005% of clindamycin compared with growth without clindamycin (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1a) . Clindamycin inhibited the bacterial growth of the P. gulae strains in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect on P. gulae D049 (type C) was significantly greater than on P. gulae ATCC 51700 (type A) and P. gulae D040 (type B) in the presence of each concentration of clindamycin (P < 0.05). The inhibitory effect on P. gulae D040 (type B) was significantly greater than on P. gulae ATCC 51700 (type A) in the presence of 0.005%, 0.015%, and 0.025% of clindamycin. When the bacterial growth of P. gulae was analysed in the presence of IFN-α formulation, each concentration of the IFN-α formulation showed no effect on the growth of P. gulae Bacterial growth of P. gulae strain D049 in the presence of IFN-α formulation and clindamycin. Bacterial growth without IFN-α formulation and clindamycin was defined as the baseline. Data are shown as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. There were significant differences as determined by using analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (Fig. 1b) . In addition, the effect of clindamycin on the growth of P. gulae was not inhibited by use of the IFN-α formulation. Cytokine and enzyme expression in gingival epithelial cells infected with P. gulae. P. gingivalis, a species closely related to P. gulae, induces inflammatory disorders which cause aggravation of periodontal disease 20 . Gingival epithelial cells play an important role in preventing bacterial invasion deeper into tissue 21 ; however, changes in the host inflammatory response produced by gingival epithelial cells exposed to P. gulae remain unknown. The relative ratios of mRNA expression levels of IL-1β, COX-2, IL-8, and TGF-β1 in Ca9-22 human gingival epithelial cells infected with P. gulae strains were analysed with their respective levels at 0 h after P. gulae infection defined as 1.0. IL-1β, COX-2, and IL-8 levels in the presence of each P. gulae strain were highest at 2 h after infection; these levels were significantly higher than those in uninfected cells (P < 0.001) ( Supplementary  Fig. 1a ). In addition, at 2 h after infection, IL-1β expression induced by P. gulae D049 (type C) infection was significantly higher than that induced by P. gulae ATCC 51700 (type A) or P. gulae D040 (type B) (P < 0.05); a similar trend was observed with respect to COX-2. IL-8 expression tended to be higher in the presence of strain D049 (type C) than in the presence of strains ATCC 51700 (type A) or D040 (type B); however, there were no significant differences among the strains. There was no change in the expression level of TGF-β1 at any time after P. gulae infection. Subsequently, we measured the protein levels of IL-1β, COX-2, IL-8, and TGF-β1 in P. gulae-infected Ca9-22 cells (Fig. 2a) . In Ca9-22 cells infected with each strain of bacteria, increased protein (a) Amounts of cytokine or enzyme production at multiple time points. Data are shown as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. There were significant differences in cytokine and enzyme production, as determined by using analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01). (b) Amounts of cytokine or enzyme production in the presence of IFN-α formulation. Data are shown as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. There were significant differences in cytokine and enzyme production, relative to cells that did not receive the IFN-α formulation, upon infection with each P. gulae strain, as determined by using analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction (*P < 0.05). levels of IL-1β, COX-2, and IL-8 were observed, whereas protein expression of TGF-β1 was nearly absent, regardless of the presence of the bacteria. Similar to the mRNA analysis, expression levels of IL-1β, COX-2, and IL-8 induced by strain D049 (type C) infection were significantly higher than expression levels induced by strains ATCC 51700 (type A) or D040 (type B). IFN-α has been reported to be effective in chronic and infectious diseases 22 , and oral administration of an IFN-α formulation improved gingival inflammation in dogs with periodontal disease 16 . Therefore, each P. gulae strain and an IFN-α formulation were simultaneously added to respective cultures of Ca9-22 cells, and the expression levels of IL-1β, COX-2, and IL-8 were analysed 2 h after incubation. Before the experiment, the IFN-α formulation, clindamycin, and combined treatment with the IFN-α formulation and clindamycin were confirmed to have no effect on the growth of uninfected Ca9-22 cells ( Supplementary Fig. 2a,b) . Treatment with the IFN-α formulation significantly reduced the mRNA expression levels and protein production levels of IL-1β and COX-2 in Ca9-22 cells that were infected with P. gulae ATCC 51700 (type A) and P. gulae D040 (type B), respectively (P < 0.05); no changes in IL-8 expression were observed (Supplementary Fig. 1b and Fig. 2b ). In addition, such changes in expression levels were not observed in Ca9-22 cells that were infected with P. gulae D049 (type C). changes in periodontal conditions before and after clinical treatment. The schedule of treatment is summarized in Fig. 3 . Fifty-two dogs were divided into four groups with or without pharmaceutical treatments, as follows: no pharmaceutical treatment (control group; n = 12), clindamycin treatment (clindamycin group; n = 10), IFN-α formulation treatment (IFN-α group; n = 14), and clindamycin and IFN-α formulation combined treatment (combination group; n = 16) ( Table 1 ). In the clindamycin group, clindamycin was ingested for a total of 7 days (4 days before and 3 days after scaling). In the IFN-α group, an IFN-α formulation (InterBerryα ® ; Hokusan Co. Ltd.) was applied to the gingival margin of all teeth, 10 times total over 35 days. Gingival and periodontal scores of dogs were assessed at the beginning and end of clinical treatment, in accordance with previously described methods 23 . Periodontal scores in all groups after the treatment were significantly lower than those before treatment (P < 0.05) (Fig. 4a ). In addition, the relative ratios were calculated for periodontal scores after periodontal treatment compared with those before periodontal treatment; the combination group had the lowest relative ratio, although there were no significant differences among groups (Fig. 4b ). As shown in Fig. 4c , accumulations of dental plaque and dental calculus around teeth were reduced and gingival conditions were improved after periodontal treatment in the combined group. P. gulae detection before and after clinical treatment. Oral swab specimens were collected from the gingival margin of the maxillary right or left canine and fourth maxillary premolar at the beginning and end of clinical treatment, as described previously 24 . Distributions of P. gulae and fimA genotype classification in the oral specimens were determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, as previously described 8, 25 . With the exception of two dogs in the control group, all dogs were positive for P. gulae before periodontal treatment; all P. gulae-positive dogs in the control group were positive for P. gulae after treatment (Table 1 , Fig. 5a ). Two of 10 dogs (20%) in the clindamycin group and four of 14 dogs (28.6%) in the IFN-α group were negative for P. gulae after treatment. The combination group had the lowest rate of P. gulae detection after treatment: P. gulae was absent from the oral cavity in six of 16 dogs (37.5%). Next, we determined the relative ratio of the detection of each fimA type after treatment, compared with that before treatment. In the control group, only the relative ratio of fimA type B was reduced after treatment (Fig. 5b ). In contrast, the relative ratios of fimA types A and C were reduced after treatment in the clindamycin group; the relative ratios of all fimA genotypes were reduced after treatment in the IFN-α and combination groups. Notably, the relative ratios of fimA type C were dramatically reduced after treatment, which were present in 37.5% and 20% of dogs in the clindamycin and combination groups, respectively. When the detection rates of fimA genotypes in each group were compared with those in the control group, detection rates of all fimA genotypes in each group (with the exception of fimA type B in the clindamycin group) were lower than those in the control group.
