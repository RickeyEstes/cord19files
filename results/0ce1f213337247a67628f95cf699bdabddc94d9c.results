IFIT1 and IFIT1B, but not IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5, interact specifically with the 5 0 -terminal regions of cap0 mRNAs Routine activity testing during purification of the eukaryotic ribosome recycling factor ABCE1 (47) from RRL, which involved toe-printing of ribosomal complexes formed on cap0-Stem-MVHL-STOP mRNA (a derivative of b-globin mRNA, containing two 5 0 -terminal guanine nucleotides and a stable stem in the middle of the 5 0 UTR; Figure 1B ; 41), revealed that some fractions induced strong arrest of reverse transcriptase (RT) seven nucleotides downstream of the 5 0 -end of the mRNA ( Figure 1C ), indicating a stable and specific interaction between constituents of these fractions and the 5 0 -terminal region of cap0 mRNA. Extensive purification of the active component ( Figure 1D , left panel) yielded an apparently homogenous $55 kDa protein ( Figure 1D , right panel), which was identified as IFIT1B (Supplementary Table S1 ). To determine whether this mRNA-binding activity was specific for rabbit IFIT1B, the following members of the IFIT family were expressed and purified in recombinant form: human (h) IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5, and rabbit (r) IFIT1 and IFIT1B ( Figure 1E ). Attempts to express recombinant hIFIT1B did not yield a soluble protein. To investigate the influence of the nature of mRNA nucleotides on IFIT/mRNA binding, five mRNAs with different 5 0 -terminal sequences were employed: b-globin(G) and b-globin(A) mRNAs with a 5 0 -terminal guanosine or adenosine, respectively, GCN4 mRNA, ATF4 mRNA and Sncb (beta-synuclein) mRNA ( Figure 1B) . At 400 nM, hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B (but not hIFIT2, hIFIT3 or hIFIT5) induced +7 nt toe-prints on cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA ( Figure 1F, top panel) . Although the +7 nt stop was the most prominent in all cases, the intensity of additional stops at flanking +6 and +8 positions differed: the strongest stop at +8 nt was induced by rIFIT1, whereas the +6 nt stop was most obvious in the case of hIFIT1 ( Figure 1G ). This subtle difference suggests that the strength of the mRNA/IFIT interaction at the 3 0 -border of the interacting mRNA region varies between the three IFITs. In the case of rIFIT1B, additional low-intensity toe-prints were also observed at +12À14 positions. Binding of hIFIT1 and rIFIT1 was specific for cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA: no RT arrest was observed on cap1-b-globin(G) mRNA in their presence ( Figure 1F , middle panel). rIFIT1B, on the other hand, was able to induce a +7 nt toe-print on cap1-bglobin(G) mRNA, but with only half the efficiency of that observed on cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA ( Figure 1F , compare middle and top panels). On b-globin(G) mRNA containing a 5 0 -terminal ppp, a prominent toeprint at the +7 position was observed in the presence of hIFIT5, whereas hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B induced only trace-level stops at this position ( Figure 1F , bottom panel). Interestingly, toe-prints induced by hIFIT1 on cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA, and to a greater extent toeprints induced by rIFIT1B and hIFIT5 on cap1-and on 5 0 ppp-b-globin(G) mRNAs, respectively, were sensitive to elevation of [Mg 2+ ] above 6 mM during the primer extension stage, which most likely indicates that at these [Mg 2+ ], RT displaces these IFITs from mRNA (PK, TRS and TVP, unpublished data). No specific toe-prints were observed in the presence of hIFIT2 and hIFIT3, irrespective of the structure present at the 5 0 -end of mRNA ( Figure 1F , all panels). Consistently, hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B, but not hIFIT2, hIFIT3 and hIFIT5 crosslinked to [ 32 P]cap-labeled cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA ( Figure 1H ). Despite sequence differences in the 5 0 -terminal region of the various tested cap0 mRNAs ( Figure 1B) , hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B specifically interacted with them all (shown for rIFIT1B in Figure 1I ). Interestingly, the m 7 GpppG and m 7 GpppA dinucleotides were only weak competitors of IFIT/cap0-mRNA binding (with m 7 GpppG being slightly stronger than m 7 GpppA) (shown for rIFIT1B in Figure 1J ), suggesting that the IFIT/cap0-mRNA interaction extends over several cap-proximal nucleotides. The affinities of hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B for cap0 mRNAs To determine the affinity of hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B for cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA, of rIFIT1B for cap1-bglobin(G) mRNA, and of hIFIT5 for 5 0 ppp-b-globin(G) mRNA, the primer extension technique was employed (Figure 2A-E) . Importantly, primer extension is performed under conditions of binding equilibrium, which represents a significant advantage of this method over non-equilibrium techniques such as the EMSA. Moreover, in the primer extension assay, unbound and IFIT-associated mRNAs yield sharp, distinct signals that could be quantified with high confidence. In all cases, sigmoidal binding curves were obtained. All tested IFITs bound to cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA very tightly (Figure 2A-C) , with similar affinities: K 1/2,app = 23 ± 4 nM for hIFIT1, K 1/2,app = 20 ± 1 nM for rIFIT1 and K 1/2,app = 9 ± 2 nM for rIFIT1B. The values of Hill coefficients n > 1 (n = 1.6 ± 0.1 for hIFIT1, n = 1.7 ± 0.2 for rIFIT1, and n = 1.8 ± 0.2 for rIFIT1B) suggested some positive cooperativity in each instance. The affinities of rIFIT1B for cap1-b-globin(G) mRNA ( Figure 2D ; K 1/2,app = 457 ± 24 nM) and of hIFIT5 for 5 0 ppp-bglobin(G) mRNA ( Figure 2E ; K 1/2,app = 372 ± 21 nM) were similar, but were more than one order of magnitude lower than those of hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B for cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA. No measurable stable binding to 5 0 ppp-b-globin(G) mRNA was observed for hIFIT1 and rIFIT1 at concentrations of up to $1.4 mM (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Since primer extension only detects specific binding of IFITs to the cap-proximal region of mRNA and as it is highly unlikely that one IFIT molecule contains more than one such binding site, low-level positive cooperativity could potentially result only from oligomerization of IFITs at higher concentrations, if it increases the affinity of IFITs to cap0-mRNA. In native gel electrophoresis (Supplementary Figure S2) , the highest degree of oligomerization was observed for rIFIT1B. hIFIT2 migrated as a dimer consistent with a previous report (15) . hIFIT3 also showed a high tendency to dimerization, whereas dimerization of hIFIT1 was lower, and hIFIT5 and rIFIT1 were mostly monomeric. Consistent with primer extension experiments ( Figure 1F ), EMSA also detected binding of cap0-RNA (comprising 62 5 0 -terminal nucleotides of cap0-bglobin(G) mRNA; Figure 2F , upper panel) only to hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B ( Figure 2F , four left panels), confirming that the lack of binding of hIFIT2, hIFIT3 and hIFIT5 to cap0 mRNA in primer extension experiments was not caused by displacement of IFITs by RT. The mobility of different IFIT/cap0-RNA complexes was consistent with the tendency of the particular IFIT to oligomerize (Supplementary Figure S2) . Thus, increasing hIFIT1 concentrations resulted in the progressive appearance of a slower migrating complex, likely corresponding to hIFIT1 dimers ( Figure 2F , first panel from the left), whereas no dimers were observed in the case of rIFIT1 ( Figure 2F , second panel from the left). rIFIT1B, on the other hand, did not form monomeric complexes, and even at the lowest concentrations migrated as a dimer, with the recombinant form having a stronger tendency to oligomerize at higher concentrations and to form high molecular weight complexes that migrated close to the start ( Figure 2F , third and fourth panels from the left). Again, as in primer extension experiments ( Figure 1F ), no binding to cap1-RNA was observed for hIFIT1, rIFIT1, hIFIT2, hIFIT3 and hIFIT5, and only a small amount of complexes formed in the case of rIFITB at the highest concentration of the protein ( Figure 2G ). In control experiments, eIF4E bound to both cap0-and cap1-RNAs ( Figure 2H ). Sensitivity of hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B to N7methylation of the cap, and their competition with eIF4E and eIF4F for binding to cap0-mRNAs Next, we investigated the requirement for N7-methylation of the cap for binding of hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B to cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA. Although N7-methylation was not essential for binding by any of the IFITs ( Figure 3A -C), differences between them were nevertheless observed. Thus, at lower concentrations, binding of hIFIT1 to unmethylated cap0-globin(G) mRNA appeared to be more efficient, but in contrast to binding to methylated mRNA, did not reach saturation at higher concentrations ( Figure 3A) , likely due to a greater degree of displacement of IFIT by RT, which prevented accurate determination of the binding constant. In contrast, binding of rIFIT1 to unmethylated cap0-globin(G) mRNA was weaker (K 1/2,app = 81 ± 5 nM) than to the methylated equivalent ( Figure 3B ). The highest dependence on N7-methylation was observed for rIFIT1B, which bound to unmethylated cap0-globin(G) mRNA with the lowest K 1/2,app of 340 ± 15 nM ( Figure 3C ). In competition experiments, association of hIFIT1 and rIFIT1B with N7-methylated cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA was not affected by 5-or even 10-fold excess of eIF4E ( Figure 3D ) or eIF4F ( Figure 3E ), irrespective of the presence of ATP or ADPNP in the reaction mixture. The effect of hIFIT1, hIFIT2, hIFIT3, hIFIT5, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B on 48S initiation complex formation on cap0-, cap1-and 5 0 ppp-mRNAs The influence of IFITs on translation initiation was investigated using an in vitro reconstituted translation system. 48S complexes were assembled from individual purified 40S subunits, Met-tRNA i Met , eIF2, eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A, eIF4A, eIF4B and eIF4F on cap0-, cap1-and 5 0 ppp-b-globin(G) mRNAs in the presence and absence of IFITs, and analyzed by toe-printing. Although IFIT/ mRNA complexes (particularly rIFIT1B/cap1-mRNA and hIFIT5/5 0 ppp-mRNA complexes) were sensitive to dissociation by RT at high Mg 2+ concentrations, the toe-printing stage in these experiments was nevertheless performed at an elevated Mg 2+ concentration in order to 'freeze' 48S complexes after their assembly. As a result, toe-prints corresponding to rIFIT1B/cap1-mRNA and hIFIT5/5 0 ppp-mRNA binary complexes were not apparent in these experiments. At 800 nM, hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B nearly abrogated 48S complex formation on cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA, whereas hIFIT2, hIFIT3 and hIFIT5 did not influence the level of 48S complex formation ( Figure 4A ). In addition, consistent with their binding to cap1-and 5 0 ppp-mRNAs ( Figures 1F, 2D and E) , rIFIT1B and hIFIT5 strongly inhibited 48S complex formation on cap1-b-globin(G) and 5 0 ppp-b-globin(G) mRNAs, respectively ( Figure 4B and C). Thus, the ability of different IFITs to inhibit 48S complex formation on a specific mRNA correlated with their ability to interact with its 5 0 -terminal region ( Figures 1F and 2A-E) . Titration experiments showed that 48S complex formation on cap0-b-globin(G) mRNA was sensitive even to low concentrations of hIFIT1, rIFIT1 and rIFIT1B ( Figure 4D and E), whereas inhibition of 48S complex formation on cap1-bglobin(G) and 5 0 ppp-b-globin(G) mRNAs by rIFIT1B and hIFIT5 required higher protein concentrations ( Figure 4F and G) (quantitative comparison shown in Figure 4H ). Notably, the IC 50 for IFIT1B on cap1-bglobin(G) was $2-fold lower than would be anticipated on the basis of the K 1/2,app , which suggests that in this particular case, primer extension might have yielded an underestimated K 1/2,app value due to protein displacement by RT.
