At the end of the study, four cows from dairy farm A and 36 cows from dairy farm B between the initial time of pregnancy diagnosis and the end of the study were gone because they were either sold or dead. The animals were sold for low milk production level, chronic mastitis, conformation, and other internal requirements. In farm B, four cows at reexamination, two from the ASP group, and two from the CON group were missing. The culling rates between the farms (farm A: 1.2% vs. farm B: 10.2%) were different (P ¼ 0.0001). In farm A, the body condition score at the initial pregnancy diagnosis for cows in the CON and ASP groups was 2.7 AE 0.5 and 2.7 AE 0.3, respectively (P ¼ 0.78). In farm B, the body condition score at the initial pregnancy diagnosis for animals in the CON and ASP groups was 2.5 AE 0.2 and 2.6 AE 0.2, respectively (P ¼ 0.51). In farm A, the per rectum diagnosis for the ASP group was initiated at 39.5 AE 1.9 days (range: 34-44 days). The reexamination by TRUS was initiated at 61.1 AE 4.4 days for the CON group and at 60.8 AE 4.2 days (P ¼ 0.54) for the ASP group. In farm B, the per rectum diagnosis for the ASP group was initiated at 40. In farm A, the early pregnancy loss was 11.5% (19 of 165) for the CON group and 13.2% (24 of 182; P ¼ 0.64; Table 1) for the ASP group. In farm B, the early pregnancy loss was 11.2% (19 of 170) for the CON group and 8.8% (14 of 159; P ¼ 0.48; Table 2 ) for the ASP group. The early pregnancy loss between farms A (12.4%; 43 of 347) and B (10.0%; 33 of 329) was not different (P ¼ 0.33). In farm A, the late pregnancy loss was 7.6% (11 of 145) for the CON group and 5.2% (8 of 155; P ¼ 0.39) for the ASP group. In farm B, the late pregnancy loss was 3.7% (5 of 137) for the CON group, and it was 6.3% (8 of 127; P ¼ 0.32) for the ASP group. The late pregnancy loss between farms A (6.3%; 19 of 300) and B (4.9%; 13 of 264) was not different (P ¼ 0.47). In farm A, the early pregnancy loss was higher than the late pregnancy loss rate (12.4% vs. 6.3%; P ¼ 0.01). In farm B, the same results were detected (10.0% vs. 4.9%; P ¼ 0.02). In both the farms, the overall early pregnancy loss was higher (11.2%; 76 of 676) than the late pregnancy loss (5.7%; 32 of 564; P ¼ 0.0005). In farm A, calving rate 1 was 81.2% (134 of 165) for the CON group and 80.8% (147 of 182; P ¼ 0.92) for the ASP group; calving rate 2 for the same groups was 92.4% (134 of 145) and 94.8% (147 of 155), respectively (P ¼ 0.68). In farm B, calving rate 1 was 77.7% (132 of 170) for the CON group and 74.8% (119 of 159; P ¼ 0.55) for the ASP group; calving rate 2 for the same groups was 87.4% (132 of 151) and 82.1% (119 of 145), respectively (P ¼ 0.20). The calving rate 1 was 80.9% (281 of 347) for farm A and 75.4% (251 of 333; P ¼ 0.14) for farm B; calving rate 2 was 92.4% (281 of 304) for farm A and 84.8% (251 of 296; P ¼ 0.0005) for farm B. Two calves with atresia coli were diagnosed by necropsy only in the CON group in farm A (P ¼ 0.23). These calves were singleton females born alive from Holstein dams and sires. The gestation length was 273 and 288 days. All the fetuses or calves born dead and necropsied were negative for intestinal atresia.
