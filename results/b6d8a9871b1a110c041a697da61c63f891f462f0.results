In order to modify the flexibility of the linker region, we incorporated five different linker sequences into our parent SAPN termed "T81c-8-pf". 11 As the de novo design of a protein sequence that will result in a folded protein with the required oligomerization domains and geometry is difficult 25,26 these were based on the results of a PDB search. We identified five suitable protein structures with the PDB entries 1jil, 2nr9, 1qgt, 2ic8 and 2i88 (Figure 1, A) . The linker regions found in these structures originally connected two monomeric helices in the context of a fully folded globular protein. Thus mutations were necessary to convert the monomeric helices into coiled-coil forming helices while keeping them at an angle compatible with the icosahedral symmetry of the nanoparticle. Therefore, in the pentameric domain, in positions a and d in the heptad repeat, we mutated the amino acid to tryptophan. Likewise, in the trimeric domain, positions a and d of the heptad repeat were changed to leucine ( Figure 2) . Remarkably, our experimental data show that these de novo designs self-assemble into nanoparticles. The biophysical Figure 2 . Alignment of the sequences of the PDB structures, the existing design (search model termed "T81c-8-pf") and the studied designs. The pentamer is shown in green, the trimer is in blue and the critical, modified residues at coiled-coil core positions are shown in boldface. There are some noteworthy trends in the PDB structures: completely conserved glycine in position 61 (black arrow) and either a hydrophobic amino acid (leucine or valine) identical or similar to leucine found in the original design (T81c-8-pf) or a small serine residue (T2i88) at position 65 (red arrow). analyses of the three constructs that expressed well and were soluble upon refolding (T1qgt, T2ic8 and T2i88) are discussed below. In general, three different pHs (6.5, 7.5 and 8.5) each at either high or low ionic strength (50 or 150 mM NaCl) were used as the six starting conditions. Based on the results from the initial screening the refolding conditions were then further optimized. T1qgt-8-pf: Linker region containing a cysteine residue at position 57 of the heptad repeat One feature of this design is the presence of the bulky phenylalanine residue in the two-residue linker connecting the pentamer (green) to the trimer (blue) and a cysteine residue at position 57 in the pentamer. In the original PDB structure (human hepatitis B virus capsid) this residue is reduced and does not form a disulfide bond that might stabilize protein structure. 20 Likewise for our construct (T1qgt-8-pf) we wanted to prevent the occurrence of disulfide bridges so as to mimic the cysteine's oxidation state in the original PDB structure. Another advantage of a reduced cysteine for our SAPN, is that aggregation caused by intermolecular disulfide bridges would be prevented. Given this knowledge, we included the reducing agent TCEP in the refolding buffer. The buffer used for stepwise removal of urea was 20 mM Tris pH 8.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 0.1 mM TCEP (reducing agent). High pH and low NaCl concentration were selected because of our research group's successful refolding of constructs containing pan-DR epitope under these conditions. 11, 12 Despite the fact that refolding was performed under reducing conditions there was substantial aggregation caused by unknown interactions (Figure 3, A) . To corroborate self-assembly of the protein in another way, we used dynamic light scattering (DLS), which is a biophysical technique that measures the size and size distribution of molecules in solution. The DLS graph (Figure 3, B) confirms the results obtained by TEM depicting heterogeneity and aggregation. T2ic8-8-pf: Linker region with leucine at position 65 of the heptad repeat Direct refolding (dialysis from 8 M urea to buffer with no urea) at pH 7.5 was initially attempted with this construct, but resulted in insoluble protein with visible aggregation in the dialysis bag. Therefore, a change in pH in the refolding buffer was deemed necessary. Direct refolding at pH 8.7 resulted in soluble nanoparticles but with some aggregation (Figure 4, A) . Stepwise refolding at pH 8.7 was also investigated and, as shown in Figure 4 , B, yielded a similar distribution of single particles and aggregates as the direct For this construct two refolding schemes were investigated: stepwise and quick refolding. Stepwise refolding was done under different pH values using Hepes (20 mM) as the buffering agent (pKa = 7.55). The pH values studied were: 7.0, 7.5 and 8.5. The salt concentration (50 mM NaCl) and glycerol volume (5%) were kept constant. Biophysical characterization by DLS and TEM (data not shown) revealed that while single nanoparticles were formed they had a slight tendency to aggregate and form what appeared to be beads on a string. The other refolding scheme that was examined for T2i88-8-pf was quick refolding. As with stepwise refolding the salt concentration (50 mM NaCl) and glycerol volume (5%) remained unchanged. What was varied was the buffering agent and the pH: Mes (pH 6.5) and Hepes (pH 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0). Aggregation tendencies were found at all pH values except pH 7.0 ( Figure 5 ). The electron micrograph ( Figure 5 , A) shows that the polypeptide chains self-assembled into nanoparticles with fairly homogeneous, spherical shapes with diameters ranging from 32 nm to 36 nm. The solution data observed with dynamic light scattering ( Figure 5 , B) correlate with the TEM data. Clearly neutral pH seemed to work best for the refolding of T2i88-8-pf. Of all the designs, T2i88-8-pf was the most promising given the biophysical characterization data obtained ( Figure 5 ). To understand more about the nature of this nanoparticle and its self-assembly T2i88-8-pf was analyzed by analytical ultracentrifugation. Surprisingly, the sedimentation velocity analysis showed that there is a polydisperse mixture of species (Figure 6, A) . However, the distribution peaks at 55 S corresponding to a particle with a molecular weight of about 2.5 MDa (Figure 6, B) . Given that the single chain has a molecular weight of 14900 Da, the peak at 55 S would correlate with roughly 180 chains per nanoparticle. This would imply a T = 3-like icosahedral symmetry. T2i88-8-pf nanoparticles were also analyzed by STEM. According to Müller and Engel, 35 the importance of the STEM for mass determination lies in its ability to analyze intact biological structures regardless of their shape and at the same time to provide an image from which the quality and homogeneity of the specimen may be independently assessed. The mass of T2i88-8-pf was determined by analyzing 389 nanoparticles from the dark-field STEM images (Figure 7) . The masses range from 1.2 to 13.8 MDa. Together they form a histogram that tails off to higher mass and can be described by 5 Gaussians. The major peak is at 2.9 ± 0.4 MDa, which it is compatible with the presence of about 180 peptide chains per particle. Examination of the corresponding images shows that the higher masses frequently arise from clusters of nanoparticles, documenting the type of aggregation that occurs (Figure 7 , inset), while particles with masses below about 4.0 MDa have essentially circular projections compatible with a roughly spherical shape.
