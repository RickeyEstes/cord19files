One year post discharge, mild to moderate pulmonary dysfunction was observed in the majority of patients. Further, 54.2% of patients had signs of severe abnormal pulmonary function, including diffusion disorder (33.3%) and small airway dysfunction (33.3%). Fourteen patients presented with respiratory tract infection symptoms; 12 with abnormal pulmonary function and two with normal pulmonary function. Our results indicated that the change in pulmonary function at one year post discharge was not significantly correlated with the severity of H1N1 influenza. In order to assess the potential long term effects of mild H1N1 influenza infection patients were first assessed at approximately one year following recovery and hospital discharge. At this time, 29.2% (14/48) were observed to have obvious respiratory tract infection symptoms and 41.7% (20/48) had difficulties in performing physical activities. Pulse oxygen saturation was greater than 95% in all patients and no abnormal vital signs. We then tested each patient for pulmonary function and found 45.8% (22/48) had normal pulmonary function while 54.2% (26/48) had abnormal pulmonary function, all presenting with changes of mild to moderate H1N1 influenza. Several changes caused by abnormal pulmonary function were found, including diffusion disorder, small airway function disorder, and weakened storing function (Table 1) . Of the 22 patients having normal pulmonary function, each had respiratory tract infection symptoms while six were observed to have a decreased ability to perform general physical activities. Of the 26 patients tested to have abnormal pulmonary function, 12 had respiratory tract infection systems and 14 had decreased ability to perform general physical activities. There was a clear correlation between respiratory tract infection symptoms and pulmonary function. Patients that tested for abnormal pulmonary function had a higher percentage respiratory tract infection symptoms when compared with the group of patients with normal pulmonary function (P = 0.047). Furthermore, patients with abnormal pulmonary function had a slightly, but not significant, greater influence on daily activities than normal pulmonary function (P = 0.188) ( Table 2) . Finally, ten patients were observed to have greater than three abnormal pulmonary function indices, manifesting as respiratory tract infection symptoms and resulting in decreased general physical activates. Using the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, scores of four (two cases), three (four cases), two (14 cases), one (four cases) and zero (two cases) were observed for patients with abnormal pulmonary function. Similarly, for patients with normal pulmonary function, scores of four (two cases), three (two cases), two (eight cases), one (ten cases) and zero (two cases) were observed. There were no significant differences in pulmonary function and ARDS scores between patients with abnormal pulmonary function and patients with normal pulmonary function. In addition, there were no significant differences in total hospital days and poorest oxygenation index between patients with normal pulmonary function and patients with abnormal pulmonary function. Taken together, these result do not represent a correlation between pulmonary function at one year after discharge and the severity of the initial influenza infection (Table 3 ).
