Of the 71 patients, 38 (53.53%) and 33 (46.47%) were female and male, respectively. Airspace nodules were present in 25% of the cases, and this was the dominant finding in only 1. This finding has not commonly been reported in the literature, and few studies have described the presence of airspace nodules in patients with H1N1 infection. (21, 24) This can be attributed to an alternative interpretation, by some authors, of airspace nodules being focal areas of consolidation, or it can even be attributed to the fact that airspace nodules can be obscured by predominance, in only 1 (1.5%). An analysis of the axial distribution of the lesions revealed the following: no specific distribution, in 48 patients (68%); peripheral lung zone predominance, in 21 (29%); and central lung zone predominance, in 2 (3%). In 14 of the 21 patients (67%) with peripheral distribution, there were also lesions in the peribronchovascular interstitial space.
