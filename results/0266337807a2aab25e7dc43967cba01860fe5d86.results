Patient screening and enrollment. From June 11 to July 12, 2014, a total of 250 patients were screened to determine their eligibility for enrollment. Of these patients, 205 febrile patients were enrolled, including 70 children (1 < 15 years of age; 34%) and 135 adults (Â³ 15 years of age; 66%). All patients enrolled were Tanzanian, and 151 (73.7%) lived on the grounds of the Estate. Male enrollment (66%) was more common than female enrollment. The median age of enrollment was 23 years (range 1-80 years) ( Table 1 ). The most common presenting complaints, other than fever, were headache (78%), lethargy (42%), cough (34%), and vomiting (29%). Of all enrolled participants, 116 (57%) were admitted for inpatient care and treatment ( Table 2) . Patient-level data, inclusive of particular clinical and epidemiologic data as well as diagnostic results, are included in a supplemental file (Supplemental Table 1 : Clinical, epidemiologic and diagnostic findings from enrolled participants). Laboratory results. Diagnostic evaluations using both AFI and Resp TAC identified 20 different viral, bacterial, and parasitic agents among 191 febrile patients contributing blood specimens and 115 febrile patients contributing NP/OP specimens. We did not detect nucleic acid for any of the 56 surveyed agents in 38 (20%) febrile participants (Table 3) . Bloodstream detections. AFI TAC was performed on 191 febrile patients. Of these, we detected nucleic acid for Plasmodium (108; 57%), Leptospira (3; 2%), and dengue virus (1; 1%). [Note: as part of quality assurance, the single positive dengue result by AFI TAC (sample ID: 204113015) was confirmed by individual reverse transcription PCR.] Overall, we detected nucleic acid for bloodstream agents in 31 (53%) children and 81 (61%) adults. Plasmodium was found to be the most common agent detected (57%), with a fairly even distribution between pediatric (53%) and adult (58%) participants. NP/OP detections. In addition, Resp TAC was performed on 115 febrile cases suspected of respiratory infection. Of these, we detected nucleic acid for 17 different organisms, most notably: Haemophilus influenzae (74; 64%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (64; 56%), Moraxella catarrhalis (45; 39%), and Staphylococcus aureus (27; 24%). The more common upper respiratory agents surveyed tended to be more prevalent among pediatric patients as compared with adult participants, including adenovirus (pediatrics: 20%; adults: 8%), enterovirus (pediatrics: 14%; adults: 2%), group A Streptococcus (pediatrics: 22%; adults: 13%), and human rhinovirus (pediatrics: 18%; adults: 8%). While we did not detect evidence of influenza A, we did detect influenza B among four individuals (pediatrics: 4%; adults: 3%). Multiple codetections. We detected nucleic acid for multiple organisms in a significant proportion of enrolled individuals (96; 50%), with detection of at least four or more organisms in about a quarter of all febrile participants (45; 24%) ( Table 4) . We concomitantly detected nucleic acid for bacterial and parasitic agents among 30 participants (16%), bacterial and viral agents among 24 participants (13%), and viral and parasitic agents in one (0.5%) individual (Figure 2) . To better interpret our quantitative diagnostic results, we examined Ct distributions among all agents detected. Figure 3 depicts Ct distributions, as observed by agent, with overall median Ct measured at 26.5. Ct medians of both Plasmodium and influenza B were detected at 18.5 and 25 respectively, thus indicating higher concentrations as compared with other detected organisms. In addition, for those patients in which we had a microscopy result, we conducted an ANOVA test to examine mean Ct values, as determined by qPCR, for patients grouped within each level of parasite intensity (1+, 2+, 3+, or 4+), as determined by blood smear. Because low Ct values correspond to high parasite loads, we would expect that lower mean Ct values correlate with higher levels of parasite intensity. Results were statistically significant (P value = 0.0025) and findings demonstrate an inverse relationship between mean Ct values and level of parasite intensity. As depicted in Figure 4 , we observe lower mean Ct values (i.e., higher detected numbers of Plasmodium parasites) correlated with higher levels of parasite intensity.
