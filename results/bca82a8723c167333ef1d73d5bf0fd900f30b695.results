Protein sequence alignment. Using the P. alecto genome Ensembl database, the amino acid sequence of major lymphocyte surface markers, cytokines and transcriptional factors was aligned with that of their human and mouse counterparts (Table 1) . Overall, the identity ranged from 44-95% with higher percentages systematically found between P. alecto and human compared to P. alecto and mouse (Table 1) . Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of intracellular molecules such as transcription factors Gata3, T-bet and Eomes was highly conserved between bats and human/mouse with sequence identity ranging from 88-95%, whereas it was lower for the surface markers (44-78%). High sequence identity was also found between bat TNF and IL-10, and their human counterparts (88 and 83%, respectively). Identification of the major lymphocyte cell populations using cross-reactive antibodies. To assess the cross reactivity of anti-human/mouse antibodies with bat ortholog proteins, we tested 47 commercially available antibodies (Table S1 ). Among which only 9 displayed cross-reactivity by flow cytometry with P. alecto lymphocytes. Interestingly, among these 9 cross-reactive antibodies, only 3 target surface molecules (MHCII,  CD44 and CD11b), whereas the remaining 6 target intracellular molecules including the intracellular domain  of CD3, transcription factors (T-bet, Gata-3 and Eomes), IL-10 and TNF cytokines (Table S1 ). This observation correlates well with the higher degree of sequence conservation between bats and human/mouse for intracellular molecules (Table 1) . It is worth to note that although the transcription factors Foxp3 and RORγ t, expressed by CD4 + T regulatory cells (Treg) and CD4 + Th17 cells respectively in human and mice, were also highly conserved in P. alecto, identification of cross-reactive antibodies against these molecules was unsuccessful. Importantly, an antibody targeting the cytoplasmic domain of human CD3 molecule, which has also been reported to be highly cross-reactive with CD3 from other mammals (Table S1) , cross-reacted with its bat counterpart, thus allowing identification of the T cell population in P. alecto. However, since human/mouse antibodies failed to detect the major lymphocyte surface markers CD4 and CD8 from bat lymphocytes, a strategy based on the expression of transcription factors was adopted to further characterize the T cell subsets. Human and mouse T cell subsets express different transcription factors upon differentiation into effector cells [24] [25] [26] . As such, Gata3 has been reported to be the master regulator driving the development of the CD4 + Th2 subset, whereas the CD4 + Th1 subset expresses predominantly Tbet. As for the CD8 + T cell population, co-expression of Tbet and Eomes was described, although Tbet is expressed at an earlier stage than Eomes during the development into effector cells and gets down-regulated later during memory formation 27, 28 . Based on the assumption that similar T cell subsets with similar expression pattern of transcription factors exist in bats, we devised the following flow cytometry strategy. Total bat splenocytes were first gated on live single cells, excluding doublets (Fig. 1a) . The total lymphocyte population was further defined by its forward and side laser light scatter properties (Fig. 1a) . Using cross-reactive anti-CD3 antibody, the CD3 + lymphocyte population was then identified and selected (Fig. 1b) . This cell population stained negative for IgG and CD11b, specific markers for B cells and myeloid cells, respectively, further supporting that these CD3 + cells are very likely T lymphocytes ( Fig. S1a-c) . Tbet, Eomes and Gata3-specific staining of the CD3 + population indicated a prominent (58%) Tbet + Eomes + double positive population in this particular bat spleen, which may correspond to CD8 + effector T cells (Fig. 1b) . Tbet + Eomes − (that could represent the CD4 + Th1 cell population or early activated CD8 + T cells) and Tbet − Gata3 + population (CD4 + Th2 cells) were also readily detected although the percentages of both cell populations were relatively low compared to the Tbet + Eomes + CD3 + lymphocytes (Fig. 1b) . In addition to T cell subsets, B lymphocytes could be identified by gating on CD3 − cells and using a commercial anti-bat IgG antibody combined with cross-reactive anti-MHCII staining. Around 90% of the CD3 − lymphocytes stained positive for both IgG and MHCII (Fig. 1c) . Finally, it has been well established that Tbet and Eomes are also essential transcription factors for terminal maturation and homeostasis of human and mouse natural killer (NK) cells 29, 30 . Consistently, a CD3 − Tbet + Eomes + cell population was detected in bat spleen that could be regarded as NK cells (Fig. 1d) . The percentage of this cell population among the lymphocyte region (~1-2%) was comparable to that reported for mouse spleen 31, 32 . Since none of the human/mouse antibodies tested cross-reacted with bat surface markers of NK cells, the differential expression of these transcription factors is for now the only means to identify this immune cell population. Identification of the CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocyte populations by prime flow technology. Since CD4 and CD8 antibody staining failed, PrimeFlow technology was employed, which uses Flow-FISH that allows detection by flow cytometry of specific genes expression at the mRNA level. Thus, simultaneous and combined detection by flow cytometry of protein (using antibodies) and mRNA (using Flow-FISH) at a single cell level is possible 33 . Here, bat splenocytes were stained with anti-CD3, anti-Eomes, anti-Tbet and anti-Gata3 antibodies followed by in situ hybridization specific to CD4 and CD8 mRNA. Results indicated that 34% and 25% of the CD3 + cells were CD8 mRNA + and CD4 mRNA + respectively (Fig. 2 ). The fact that these percentages added up to 60% only of the total CD3 + population suggests lower sensitivity of flow-FISH assay compared to antibody staining. In addition, since the specificity and sensitivity for each target mRNA vary from one probe to another; direct quantitative comparison of different cell populations identified by Flow-FISH may be biased. However, it is possible to analyze sub-populations within a specific cell subset identified by Flow-FISH. Here, the combined Flow-FISH and antibody detection approach reveals that majority (75%) of the CD3 + CD8 mRNA + cells co-expressed Tbet and Eomes, and only about 1% expressed Gata3 (Fig. 2b ). This result thus validates our FACS strategy based on the differential expression of Eomes, Tbet and Gata3 to identify the CD8 + T cell population. In addition, comparable percentages of CD4 mRNA + and CD8 mRNA + cells that were Tbet + Eomes − were observed (13.4 and 10.6%, respectively). This observation thus supports that bat CD3 + Tbet + Eomes − cells are likely to represent the CD4 + Th1 subset as well as early activated CD8 + T cells. Among the CD4 mRNA + cells, another 12% expressed Gata3 (which could be CD4 + Th2 cells), and 13% co-expressed Tbet and Eomes. However, the greatest majority of CD4 mRNA + cells were Tbet − Gata3 − Eomes − triple negative, which could represent naïve CD4 + T cells or other subsets that could not be identified due to the lack of cross-reactive antibodies. Together, these results indicated that majority of CD8 mRNA + T cells are Tbet + Eomes + double positive and do not express Gata3. Instead, majority of CD4 mRNA + T cells are Tbet − Gata3 − Eomes − triple negative. However, a substantial proportion of CD4 mRNA + T cells express Gata3, or Tbet and Eomes.
