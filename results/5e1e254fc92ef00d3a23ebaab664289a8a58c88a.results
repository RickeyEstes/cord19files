Influenza pseudotyped particle production and infectivity assays. To assess the effect of HA-NA pairings on infectivity of influenza pseudotyped viruses, six types of pseudotyped particles were produced: HA only pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 ), native matching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 X-31 ), human:human mismatching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 Japan ), human:avian mismatching pseudoparticles (H3 X-31 /N2 MS96 ), and two control pseudovirions, VSV-∆ env and VSV-G. The pseudovirions were then used to infect Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial (MDCK) cells, with infection confirmed by the green fluorescence signals produced by the infected cells. In all cases, MDCK cells were evenly seeded at 2 × 10 5 cells/cm 2 , so more GFP-positive cells indicate that pseudovirions had higher infectivity (Fig. 2) . VSV-Δ env refers to particles without envelope glycoproteins (negative control case) and VSV-G are particles harboring the VSV G surface fusion protein (positive control case). The results of the infectivity assays show that VSV-H3 X-31 /N2 X-31 , VSV-H3 X-31 /N2 Japan VSV-H3 X-31 /N2 MS96 and VSV-H3 X-31 particles are infectious, as GFP-positive cells were observed in all these cases. However, among these, infectivity levels varied based on the number of GFP-positive cells observed. To better understand the basis for the differences in infectivity observed, we carried out single-particle fusion assays to determine if there were differences in cell entry behavior among these particles.
