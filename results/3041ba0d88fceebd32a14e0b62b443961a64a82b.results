Vps3 and Vps8 localise to recycling vesicles. The mammalian CORVET complex functions as a tether between EEs and is recruited to membranes via the interaction of Vps8 with Rab5 8 . To determine a possible role of the CORVET complex in endosomal recycling, we analysed the localisation of the CORVETspecific subunits Vps3 and Vps8 in ultrastructural detail. We expressed GFP-Vps3 and HA-Vps8 in HeLa cells and performed immuno-electron microscopy (IEM) by immunogold labelling of ultrathin cryosections. Our IEM data confirmed the localisation of Vps3 and Vps8 on EEs (Fig. 1a, top panel) , but in addition revealed a substantial labelling on EE-associated tubules and vesicles (Fig. 1a, bottom panel) . The Vps3-and Vps8-labelled vesicles had a characteristic dense content, were often found in clusters (Fig. 1a, lower panel, and 1b) and were consistently negative for endocytosed BSA-Au 5 , a marker of endocytic but not recycling vesicles. These morphological characteristics putatively define the Vps3-and Vps8-positive vesicles as recycling vesicles. To determine whether the Vps3-and Vps8-positive vesicles also contain CORVET core subunits, we expressed GFP-Vps3 together with FLAG-Vps18 for IEM analysis. Immunogold double labelling showed that Vps18 co-localises with Vps3 on EEs, but was absent from Vps3-positive vesicles (Fig. 1b , asterisks), indicating that Vps3 and Vps8 localise to recycling vesicles, which lack CORVET core components. We then co-expressed GFP-Vps3, HA-Vps8 or the CORVET core subunit GFP-Vps11, together with mCherry-tagged Rab4, Rab5 or Rab11, and assessed their co-localisation by quantitative immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy. We found that Vps3 ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1a) and Vps8 (Fig. 1c, d) significantly colocalised with Rab5 and Rab4, which label EEs and EE-derived recycling vesicles, respectively 17, 22 , and partially with the RE marker Rab11 (Fig. 1c , d and Supplementary Fig. 1a) , indicative for the presence of Vps3 and Vps8 on EEs as well as on recycling vesicles. By contrast, GFP-Vps11 only notably overlapped with Rab5 ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1b) , reinforcing the notion that CORVET core components are present on EEs but not on recycling vesicles. To facilitate the distinction of Rab5 and Rab4 subdomains within EEs by IF microscopy, we expressed the constitutively active Rab5Q79L mutant, which increases the size of EEs 22, 23 . Strikingly, co-expression of GFP-Rab5Q79L with HA-Vps8 and FLAG-Rab4 revealed that HA-Vps8 specifically concentrated in FLAG-Rab4-positive patches (Fig. 1e , arrows) and protrusions ( Supplementary Fig. 1c , arrows) of GFP-Rab5Q79L-positive EEs. To further confirm that Vps3 and Vps8 reside on the same recycling vesicles as Rab4 we performed IEM of HeLa cells expressing HA-Vps8 or HA-Vps3 with GFP-Rab4. This unequivocally demonstrated that Vps3 and Vps8 indeed co-localise with Rab4 on recycling tubules and vesicles (Fig. 1f, arrows) . In conclusion, these data reveal that Vps3 and Vps8 are present on EE-derived Rab4-positive recycling vesicles and Rab11positive REs, which lack CORVET core components. Vps3 and Vps8 interact directly with each other. Previous studies showed that Vps3 and Vps8 bind the CORVET core complex 9,12 . In addition, direct interactions between Vps3 and Vps8 have been reported in yeast 24 . Since we find that Vps3 and Vps8 co-localise on recycling vesicles that lack CORVET core components, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-binding experiments to investigate whether mammalian Vps3 and Vps8 bind directly to each other. In agreement with this scenario, co-IP experiments in HeLa cells revealed that endogenous Vps8 readily coimmunoprecipitated with overexpressed GFP-Vps3, while less Vps8 was recovered with GFP-tagged Vps11, Vps16 or Vps41, the HOPS-specific subunit that is most homologous to Vps8 (Fig. 2a , full blots in Supplementary Fig. 2 ). To investigate whether Vps3 can directly bind Vps8 we probed the binding of full-length GST-Vps3 purified from bacterial lysates with in vitro-translated HA-Vps8. Importantly, GST-Vps3 interacted directly with HA-Vps8 (Fig. 2b , full blots in Supplementary Fig. 3 ). By expressing truncation mutants of GST-Vps3, we could map the Vps8 interacting domain to the C terminus of Vps3 (Fig. 2b) , which also confirms the specificity of the binding assays. Finally, to quantify the interaction of Vps3 with Vps8, Vps11 or Vps16 we performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA) in HeLa cells. This showed a significantly higher PLA signal between Vps3 and Vps8, than between Vps3 and Vps11 or Vps16 (Fig. 2c, d) . Taken together, these data show that Vps3 and Vps8 can interact directly with each other. Vps3 and Vps8 co-localise with CHEVI on recycling membranes. The CHEVI complex interacts with Rab11 and localises to Rab11-positive REs 8, 9, 18, 19, 25, 26 . Since Vps3 and Vps8 partially co-localise with Rab11 ( Fig. 1c , d) we investigated co-localisation between Vps3 and Vps8 with the CHEVI complex. To allow formation of the CHEVI complex we co-expressed VIPAS39-mCherry and untagged Vps33B. Expression of the CHEVI complex with either HA-Vps8 or GFP-Vps3 resulted in clear colocalisation as determined by quantitative IF microscopy ( Fig. 3a , b). By IEM, these foci of co-localisation were identified as Vps3-, Vps8-and CHEVI-positive clusters of vesicles and tubules, which is the typical morphology for REs 27 (Fig. 3c) . To examine possible interactions between the CHEVI complex and Vps3 or Vps8, or between CHEVI and the CORVET core subunits, we performed co-IP experiments after co-expression of HA-VIPAS39 with GFP-tagged constructs of Vps3, Vps8, Vps11, Vps16, Vps33A, Vps33B or Vps41. Because co-expression of Vps33B together with VIPAS39 is needed for membrane recruitment of the CHEVI complex 18, 19 , we included an internal control by probing the interactions with HA-VIPAS39 in the absence (Fig. 3d , left panel) or presence (Fig. 3d , right panel) of overexpressed HA-Vps33B. As expected, we detected a strong interaction between HA-VIPAS39 and GFP-Vps33B (Fig. 3d , lane 7 both panels, full blots in Supplementary Fig. 4) . Strikingly, however, no significant binding between CHEVI with any of the other subunits was found (Fig. 3d) . Only after prolonged exposure of the western blot a weak interaction between GFP-Vps3 and HA-VIPAS39 was detected (Supplementary Fig. 5 and  6 ). Previous studies using endogenous proteins failed to detect specific interactions between VIPAS39 with any of the HOPS or CORVET subunits, including Vps3 and Vps8 8, 9 . Our studies are in line with these findings, however, the weak binding between CHEVI and Vps3 could be indicative for transient interactions. Taken together, our data show that in addition to their localisation on Rab4-positive recycling vesicles (Fig. 1f ), Vps3 and Vps8 partially co-localise with the CHEVI complex on REs. Furthermore, these data suggest that a transient interaction of Vps3 and Vps8 with the CHEVI complex may occur on REs. Vps3 and Vps8 are required for recycling of β1 integrins. To assess which cargo is transported by the Vps3/8-positive recycling vesicles, we first determined the effect of Vps3 and Vps8 depletion on transferrin (Tf) recycling. We depleted both subunits to fully prevent any function related to the interaction between residual Vps3 and Vps8. Endocytosed Tf recycles either directly from EEs to the plasma membrane or indirectly via REs, while dextran is transported to the lysosome for degradation 28 . A block in recycling increases inclusion of Tf in the degradative pathway to the lysosome, and therefore increases the co-localisation between Tf and dextran 29, 30 . Vps3/8 depletion had no effect on Tf localisation, indicating that the recycling of Tf was not disturbed (Fig. 4a, b) . These data are in line with a previous study showing that Vps3 is not required for Tf recycling 8 . In addition to the common recycling pathway taken by Tf, specific recycling pathways are described for cell-surface proteins such as integrins [31] [32] [33] . To study a potential role of Vps3 and Vps8 in the recycling of β1 integrins we used an established antibody-based integrin recycling assay 34 . HeLa cells were depleted of Vps3 and Vps8, and then serum-starved overnight, labelled with anti-β1 integrin, washed and chased for 2 h. In the absence of serum, β1 integrins accumulate in REs (Fig. 4c, arrows) . Vps3/8 knockdown prevented the accumulation of β1 integrins, which instead retained a dispersed distribution throughout the cell Ratio internalisation Vps3/8KD/Scrambled ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Using an adapted IEM protocol to visualise the antibody uptake as described above, we could identify the accumulations in control cells as large clusters of recycling tubules and vesicles (Fig. 4d, left panel) . Importantly, IEM of the Vps3/8 knockdown cells showed that internalised β1 integrins still entered EEs and EE-associated recycling vesicles (Fig. 4d, right panel) . These data show that the block in β1 integrin recycling induced by Vps3/8 knockdown occurs after exit from EEs, and interferes with the transport of recycling vesicles to REs. Re-addition of serum induced integrin recycling in control cells resulting in the disappearance of intracellular accumulations, while the localisation of internalised β1 integrins in knockdown cells remained unchanged ( Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Together these results imply that Vps3/8 knockdown prevents or delays internalised β1 integrins to reach REs and thereby prevents clearance of the intracellular pool. We next investigated the impact of Vps3/8 knockdown on the kinetics of integrin recycling by studying the fibronectin (FN)binding integrin α5β1 35 . In short, cells were surface-labelled with cleavable biotin and endocytosis was allowed for 30 min in the absence of serum. Surface biotin was removed and recycling was induced by re-addition of serum. Surface biotin was removed again and the reduction of intracellular biotinylated α5 integrin before and after recycling was quantified using capture ELISA. This assay showed that knockdown of Vps3/8 resulted in a significant decrease of α5β1 recycling, especially after short recycling times (Fig. 4f) , while the internalisation of α5β1 as not affected (Fig. 4g) . Finally, to verify that α5β1 is indeed transported by Vps3/8-positive recycling vesicles, we labelled the α5 and β1 integrin subunits for IEM. This unequivocally demonstrated that integrin α5β1 is present in the Vps3/8-positive recycling vesicles (Fig. 4h) . Taken together, these data show that β1 integrins are incorporated into Vps3/8-positive recycling vesicles, and that Vps3 and Vps8 are required for efficient β1 integrin recycling. Vps3 and Vps8 regulate cell adhesion and migration. Integrins are the primary receptors for extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins 36 and integrin recycling is important for cell-ECM interactions and cell migration [37] [38] [39] . To investigate whether Vps3 and Vps8 are required for integrin-dependent cell adhesion, we seeded HeLa Vps3/8 knockdown cells on FN or collagen-I (Col-I) in the absence of serum. Non-adherent cells were washed away after 5, 15 or 30 min, and the number of attached cells was quantified. This revealed that adhesion to both FN (Fig. 5a) and Col-I (Fig. 5b) was significantly compromised in Vps3/8 knockdown cells. Individual knockdown of Vps3 or Vps8 also reduced cell adhesion, but the effect was less stringent, suggesting that residual expression in single-knockdown cells still allows a functional interaction between Vps3 and Vps8, while in the doubleknockdown cells this is more completely abrogated (Supplementary Fig. 8a) . Importantly, different siRNA oligos induced essentially the same results, rendering it unlikely that the observed adhesion defect is due to off-target effects (Supplementary Fig. 8b) . Because integrin-dependent cell adhesion is followed by a reorganisation of the cytoskeleton and cell spreading, we next determined cell spreading on FN and Col-I 2 h after cell adhesion (Fig. 5c) . Quantification of the number of spread cells showed that Vps3/8 depletion reduces cell spreading on both FN and Col-I (Fig. 5d) . Integrin-mediated cell spreading is linked to the assembly of focal adhesions (FAs), which anchor the actin cytoskeleton to the ECM 40 . To determine if Vps3/8 knockdown impacts on FA formation, we quantified the number of FAs per cell using confocal microscopy on cell populations stained for vinculin, a well-established marker of FAs (Fig. 5e) . Consistent with reduced cell adhesion and spreading, Vps3/8 knockdown cells assembled less FAs, both on FN and Col-I (Fig. 5f) . Finally, we analysed cell motility by time-lapse microscopy ( Fig. 5g , arrows indicate migration direction). Knockdown of Vps3 and Vps8 resulted in reduced migration speed (Fig. 5h ) and migration distance (Fig. 5i ) on both Col-I and FN. Moreover, analysis of cell morphology revealed that the knockdown induced a tail retraction defect (Fig. 5g, j) , which is a known effect of impaired integrin trafficking 41, 42 . Together these results show that interfering with Vps3/Vps8dependent integrin recycling leads to a variety of defects in integrin-dependent processes, including cell adhesion and migration.
