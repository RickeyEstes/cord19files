All 747 adult patients admitted with CAP to the participating centres were included in the analysis. The distribution of cases during the study period is shown in Fig. 1 . Most patients were hospitalised between epidemiological weeks 2 and 5, 2011 (January 09 e February 05). Table 1 shows the distribution of causative organisms in hospitalised patients with CAP. An etiological diagnosis could be established in 315 (42.2%) patients. According to the etiological diagnosis, 154 (21.9%) were due to bacteria, 125 (16.7%) to viruses, and 36 (4.8%) to viruses and bacteria. The most frequently documented bacteria was S. pneumoniae.
