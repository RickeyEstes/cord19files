The splice motif predictor programs, ESE finder [16] , and Rescue ESE [17] were used to predict putative exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) in exon 25 (Figure 1 ). Annealing co-ordinates of AOs relative to the predictive ESE positions are indicated. 2OMeAOs designed to target the predicted splicing motifs in dystrophin exon 25 (Table 1 and Figure 1 ) were transfected into normal human myoblasts ( Figure  2A ). In normal cells, all AOs tested demonstrated robust skipping of exon 25 at 100 nM and were effective at the lower concentration of 2.5 nM. Figure 2B shows the levels of exon 25 skipping in MyoD converted patient fibroblasts after treatment with the same panel of AOs. H25D(+16-08) and H25D(+06-14), targeting the exon 25 donor splice site, did not induce the same degree of exon skipping efficiency in the patient cells ( Figure 2B ). H25A(+10+33) induced similar levels of exon 25 excision in patient and normal cells, whereas H25A(+95+119) performed better in patient cells than in normal cells at all concentrations tested ( Figure 2B and 2C) . H25A(+95+119) targets the region of dystrophin exon 25 that encompasses the causative mutation. Since this mismatched oligomer generated such effective exon skipping, we subsequently examined the patient's mutation by direct DNA sequencing and confirmed the original diagnosis of a single base insertion of an A, 110 bases from the beginning of exon 25 ( Figure 3A ). This mutation occurs 11 bases downstream from the 5' end of H25A(+95+119), raising questions about how it might be influencing AO efficacy ( Figure 3B and 3C) . To investigate this we then designed a mutation specific AO to target the same coordinates. AO H25A(+95+A+119) was produced as a patientspecific AO with perfect complementarity when annealing to the patient dystrophin transcript ( Figure 3D and Table 1) . Surprisingly, transfection of patient cells with H25A(+95+A+119) shows that perfect complementarity is not essential for efficient exon skipping in this case ( Figure 4) . Although the additional base makes little difference when compared to H25A(+95+119) in normal cells, despite the mismatch ( Figure 4A ), in the patient cells H25A(+95+A+119) reduces the efficiency of exon skipping, particularly evident at lower transfection concentrations ( Figure 4B ). DMD patient fibroblasts were converted to myoblasts by forced myogenesis and transfected with H25A(+95 +119)-k (i.e. PPMO-k chemistry). Untreated Myo-D converted DMD fibroblasts, and normal myoblasts were the predominant PCR products generated from the H25A(+95+119)-k treated patient and control myoblasts ( Figure 5A ) confirmed the exclusion of exon 25 from the amplicon (Figure 5C and 5D ).
