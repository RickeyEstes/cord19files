In the 5 urban areas, 81,266 unique telephone numbers were dialed, and the overall response rate was 8% (number of participants [2, 504] divided by number of calls with eligible respondents [29,919]) ( Figure 2 , panel A). The selection of 1,227 participants in 4 rural sites is illustrated in Figure 2 , panel B. The surveys were conducted from May 23 through August 24. During this period, the influenza A(H7N9) epidemic had passed its peak, and few cases occurred. Guangdong Province notified its first human influenza A(H7N9) case on August 9, after the completion of the survey in Guangzhou on June 26. Respondents in urban areas tended to have white-collar jobs or were unemployed, were younger, had more education and higher income, and were less likely to be married than those in rural areas (Table 1) . However, because the surveys were conducted in different forms in urban versus rural areas and the general characteristics of participants were different, including the risk for becoming infected with influenza A(H7N9) virus and the types of potential exposure to avian influenza viruses, we did not make any further direct quantitative comparisons between urban and rural respondents. For comparisons among urban areas, respondents were generally similar, but reported incomes were higher for Shanghai and Guangzhou than for the other 3 cities (data not shown). We assessed exposures to live poultry and visits to LPMs in the 5 cities. In total, 33% of respondents reported visiting LPMs during the preceding year, the highest proportion in Guangzhou; notable differences were found between cities (Table 2 ). By imputing midpoints of reported purchasing rates, we estimated that the mean number of live poultry purchased per year varied between cities: 6.8 for Shenyang, 19 for Shanghai, 20 for Wuhan, 28 for Chengdu, and 47 for Guangzhou. Age-specific patterns in exposure to live poultry were generally similar for men and women within each city, with some exceptions. In Guangzhou, women 35-54 years of age purchased poultry in LPMs much more frequently than did men of the same age, but the reverse was true for those >65 years of age (Figure 3) . We found no evidence of a substantial difference in poultry exposures by sex in Shanghai ( Figure 3) . We further analyzed exposures in LPMs among urban residents on the basis of responses from the 829 (33%) of 2,504 participants who visited LPMs >1 time in the preceding year. Overall, 69% of these respondents reported that they always visited the nearest LPM; median distance from home to the nearest LPM was 1 km. Most respondents reported that they "usually" or "always" picked up poultry for examination before deciding to buy, with the highest proportion in Chengdu and lowest in Shenyang; 87% of respondents always arranged for slaughter of purchased poultry in the LPM, with no notable differences between cities. During the study period, the general anxiety level among urban respondents (measured by the State Trait Anxiety Inventory) was low to moderate, but levels varied substantially between cities; the lowest mean scores were seen in Wuhan and Shenyang (Table 3) . Perceived risk for influenza A(H7N9) in the following month (absolute susceptibility) and relative to others (relative susceptibility) were generally low in all cities, but highest in Shanghai. Respondents in Shanghai and Guangzhou were more likely to respond that they would be more worried than usual if they experienced an influenza-like illness (ILI). Twelve percent of respondents reported that they had worried about becoming ill with influenza A(H7N9) during the previous week; levels varied among cities, with a greater frequency of worry in Shanghai and Guangzhou (Table 3) . Respondents in Shenyang reported the highest perceived severity of influenza A(H7N9) compared with seasonal influenza and avian influenza A(H5N1); respondents in Guangzhou reported the highest perceived severity of influenza A(H7N9) compared with that of SARS (Table 3) . In rural areas, as in urban areas, the mean State Trait Anxiety Inventory was low to moderate ( †Respondents who bought live poultry ≥1/year were further asked about the number of live poultry bought in the previous year, picking up poultry or not before buying, locations where poultry was slaughtered, and changes in poultry purchase behavior since influenza A(H7N9) outbreak. ‡Respondents who answered always/usually to the question "Did you pick up poultry for examination before deciding to buy it?" were categorized as "Yes." §Respondents who stated that they always/usually have live poultry slaughtered in LPMs were categorized as "In LPM," whereas those who answered always/usually in household were categorized as "in household." ¶Respondents who answered not buying since then/still buying but less than before to the question "Has your habit of buying live poultry changed since H7N9 was identified in China in March 2013?" were categorized as "Yes." #Respondents who answered strongly agree/agree to the question "Would you agree to permanent closure of live poultry markets in order to control avian influenza epidemics?" were categorized as "Agree." **Respondents who reported that market closure caused great/some inconvenience were categorized as "More inconvenient." This question was only asked of respondents in Shanghai because Shanghai was the only area where LPMs were closed at the time of the survey. poultry at home. Overall, 47% reported raising chickens, 15% raised ducks, and 8% raised geese; these proportions varied between counties (Table 4 ). In rural areas, levels of perceived absolute and relative susceptibility and concern about ILI or confirmed influenza A(H7N9) infection were generally low; some differences were seen between the 4 rural areas. Respondents in Nanzhang and Zijin were more likely to respond that they would be more worried than usual if they had an ILI; 24% of respondents in Zijin reported that they had worried about becoming ill with influenza A(H7N9) in the previous week, and the average level of worry in Zijin was higher than that for other counties (Table 4). Most respondents in each area perceived influenza A(H7N9) to be more severe than seasonal influenza but less severe than influenza A(H5N1) and SARS. Among respondents in urban areas who visited LPMs >1 time in the preceding year, 77% reported that they had stopped buying or bought lower amounts of live poultry since March 2013; this proportion was highest (91%) for Shanghai (Table 2) . We examined factors affecting the likelihood of changing habits of buying live poultry and found greater changes among women, those with higher educational attainment, and those residing in Shanghai and Wuhan rather than in Chengdu. We found no statistically significant differences by age group (Table 5) . On average, across the 5 cities, 30% of respondents reported that they would support the closure of LPMs to control the epidemic; the proportion in support of closures was highest in Shanghai (39%) and lowest in Guangzhou (27%) and Chengdu (25%) ( Table 2) . We examined factors affecting the likelihood of supporting the closure of LPMs and found greater support among persons 55-64 years of age (odds ratio [OR] 3.28, 95% CI 1.71-6.29) and >65 years of age (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.04-5.32). We also found greater support for closure of LPMs in Shanghai (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.05-2.99) than in Chengdu but no significant differences by sex or educational attainment (Table 5 ). However, 32% of respondents in Shanghai reported that the closure of LPMs had caused them inconvenience.
