The terminal hairpins of the HBoV1 genome are typical of those of the genus Bocavirus A head-to-tail junction of an HBoV1 episome identified in an HBoV1-infected HAE [28, 29] was found to possess two sequences (39-CGCGCGTA-59 and 39-GATTAG-59) identical to parts of the BPV1 left-end hairpin (LEH) [27, 32] . This finding suggested that the head sequence is part of the HBoV1 LEH (nucleotides in blue; Figure 1A ). We therefore used the head sequence as the 39 end of a reverse primer (RHBoV1_LEH). Together with a forward primer (FHBoV1_nt1), which anchors the 39 end of the HBoV1 genome predicted from the BPV1 LEH, we amplified the hairpin of the LEH from a viral DNA extract (1.2610 8 gc/ml) prepared from a nasopharyngeal aspirate taken from an HBoV1-infected patient (HBoV1 Salvador1 isolate) [17] . Only one specific DNA band was detected at approximately (,)150-bp ( Figure 1D , lane 1). Sequencing of this DNA revealed a novel sequence of the HBoV1 LEH (nucleotides in red between the two arrows; Figures 1A and S1A). Because the LEHs of the prototype bocaviruses BPV1 and MVC are asymmetric [27, 32] , we set up another PCR reaction with a forward primer located in the hairpin (FHBoV1_LEH) and a reverse primer targeting a sequence downstream of the LEH at nt 576 (RHBoV1_nt576; Figure 1B ). Sequencing of a DNA fragment ( Figure S1B ), detected as expected as a ,600-bp band ( Figure 1D, lane 3) , confirmed the presence of the novel joint sequence and the LEH ( Figure 1B) . The tail of the HBoV1 head-to-tail junction [28, 29] was found to contain a sequence (59- GCG CCT TAG TTA TAT ATA ACA T -39) identical to that of the right-end hairpin (REH) of the other prototypic bocavirus MVC [27] . We thus speculated that the entire HBoV1 REH is similar in structure to its MVC counterpart. Using a reverse primer targeted to this sequence (RHBoV1_nt5464) and a forward primer located upstream of the REH (FHBoV1_nt5201), we were able to amplify a specific ,300-bp-long DNA fragment ( Figure 1D , lane 5). Sequencing confirmed the presence of the palindromic hairpin of the predicted REH (nucleotides in red; Figures 1C and S1C), and revealed two novel nucleotides at the end of the hairpin (GC in red; Figure 1C ). These results indicate that we have identified, for the first time, both the LEH and REH of the HBoV1 genome from a clinical specimen, and confirm that the HBoV1 genome structure is typical of the genus Bocavirus. A full-length HBoV1 clone (pIHBoV1) is capable of replicating and producing progeny virus in HEK293 cells We also cloned and sequenced the non-structural (NS) and capsid (VP) protein-coding (NSVP) genes of the HBoV1 Salvador1 isolate from the patient-extracted viral DNA. We then ligated the LEH, NSVP genes and REH into pBBSmaI using strategies diagramed in Figure S2 , and refer to this full-length clone as pIHBoV1. We have deposited the sequence of the full-length genome of the isolate in GenBank (JQ923422). As we previously showed that HEK293 cells support replication of the DNA of an autonomous human parvovirus (B19V) in the presence of adenovirus helper genes or adenovirus [33] , we first investigated whether the adenovirus helper function is necessary for pIHBoV1 replication in HEK293 cells. Specifically, we transfected pIHBoV1 into HEK293 cells (untreated or infected with adenovirus), alone or with pHelper. Interestingly, we found that pIHBoV1 replicated well in the absence of helper virus. Indeed, all the three representative forms of replicated bocavirus DNA [27, 34] (DpnI digestion-resistant dRF DNA, mRF DNA and ssDNA) were detected in each test case, and at similar levels ( Figure 2A ). DpnI digestion-resistant DNA bands are newly replicated DNA in cells as DpnI digestion only cleaves plasmid DNA prepared from prokaryotic cells, which is methylated at the dam site [35] . In contrast, these DNA forms of the viral genome were absent in pIHBoV1-transfected primary airway epithelial cells (NHBE; Figure 2B , lanes 7&8) and present at very low levels (over 20 times lower than in pIHBoV1-transfected HEK293 cells) in pIHBoV1-transfected human airway epithelial cell lines BEAS-2B ( Figure 2B , lanes 5&6), A549 and 16HBE14o-( Figure 2C ), even in the presence of adenovirus. Thus, replication in these cells appears to be non-existent or poor in these contexts. To confirm the specificity of DNA replication and the identity of the DpnI-resistant DNA bands, we disrupted the ORFs encoding viral proteins NS1, NP1, VP1 and VP2 in pIHBoV1; knockout of expression of the corresponding viral protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis. When the NS1 ORF was disrupted, no DpnI digestion-resistant DNA was detected ( Figure 2D , lane 4), confirming that replication of this DNA requires NS1. Notably, when the NP1 ORF was disrupted, an RF DNA band was detected but it was very weak ( Figure 2D , lane 6), suggesting that NP1 is also involved. When the VP2 ORF was knocked out, the ssDNA band disappeared, but this was not the case when VP1 was disrupted (VP2 was still expressed; Figure 2D , compare lanes 7 to 9), these findings are consistent with a role for
