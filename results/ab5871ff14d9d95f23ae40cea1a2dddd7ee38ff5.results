Sixty-one patients were operated in the time frame, but only 48 patients were included in the study. Among the non-included patients, four underwent emergency surgery, and nine did not consent. Twentythree patients (47.9%) were male, and 14 (29.1%) died. Tables 1, 2 and 3 present demographic and surgical data, and outcomes, respectively, according to the presence of VRI. Although patients with VRI were more likely to have lower STAT categories, neither STAT nor age at surgery were significantly different between patients with and without VRI. All patients were admitted in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after surgery, mechanically ventilated. Forty patients (83%) were extubated at least once, and 15 of them (37.5%) have had at least one extubation failure. Tracheostomy was needed in 3 patients. Regarding postoperative pulmonary complications, we found pulmonary congestion in 42 patients (87.5%), pleural effusions in 21 patients (43.7%), and atelectasis in 20 patients (41.6%). Twenty-four patients (50%) have had two or more of these pulmonary complications. VRI was present preoperatively in 16 patients (33.3% of total), while 4 patients acquired a VRI during hospital stay (8.3% of total) in this cohort, with a total frequency of 41.6%. The number and type of viruses we found are shown in Fig. 1 . Among children with a VRI, association of two viruses were found in four patients: two had enterovirus B plus influenza A H1N1, one had adenovirus plus rhinovirus and one had enterovirus B plus rhinovirus. VRI were more frequent during winter (55%) than in fall (20%) and in spring and summer (10%). Immunoprophylaxis against RSV was given to seven patients before surgery. Of these, four have had a VRI, but not caused by RSV.
