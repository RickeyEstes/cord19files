Our simulations show that the control measures aimed at reducing the social mixing in the population can be effective in reducing the magnitude of the peak of the outbreak. We presented the median cumulative incidence (Fig 4A) , incident case per day ( Fig 4B) and agespecific incidence per day (Fig 4C-G) of the 200 simulated outbreaks. The 25 th and 75 th percentile outbreaks are represented by the shaded area in the cumulative incidence. The intense control measures of prolonged school closure and work holidays reduced the final size ( Fig 4A) and peak incidence, while also delaying the peak of the outbreak (Fig 4B) . Our model suggests that the effects of these social distancing strategies vary across age categories, the reduction in incidence is highest among school children and older individuals and lowest among working-aged adults (Fig 4C-G and Fig 5) . These measures were most effective if staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the overall number of infections in mid-2020 size by more than 92% (interquartile range: 66-97%) (Fig 5 and Fig S4) should the disease have a longer duration of infectiousness, and greatly reduced the magnitude of the peak incidence across all age categories (Fig 4C-E) which can have further beneficial impact by relieving the pressure on the healthcare system. However, premature return to work can result in an increase in incidence even if it originally seemed that the epidemic has started to turn over (second wave, Fig 4B peak of the orange line followed by the sharp increase in incidence in red line). Uncertainty in + values has a large impact on the timing of the peak and the final size of the outbreak (Fig 4A) . The modelled effects of intense control measures of prolonged school closure and work holidays vary by the duration of infectiousness. If the disease had a short infectious period (3 days), then the model suggests that relaxing the social distancing interventions in March (Fig 5A) could avert approximately half of cases in school children and older individuals. More than half of the cases could be averted should the disease have a longer duration of infectiousness (for e.g., 7 days as presented in Fig 5C) -.
