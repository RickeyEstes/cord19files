Multiplication and growth of P. s. pv. actinidiae in A. deliciosa leaf. During the time course of the experiment, the multiplication and growth of PSA CRA-FRU 8.43 inoculated at 1-2 × 10 3 cfu/ml and 1-2 × 10 7 cfu/ml into A. deliciosa cv. Hayward leaves was assessed. When inoculated at the lower dose, the growth of the pathogen within the leaf never exceeded 10 5 cfu/ml and showed a peak of 2-3 × 10 4 cfu/ml at nine dpi; no symptoms were observed in the inoculated leaves. By contrast, when the pathogen was inoculated at 1-2 × 10 7 cfu/ml, it incited the appearance of tiny necrotic spots on many of the inoculated leaves of nine dpi (see Supplementary Fig. S1 online). In this case, only the green tissue was precisely removed to prepare the samples. Selection of candidate reference genes, amplification specificity and efficiency. Nine RGs, commonly used as internal controls for expression studies in other pathosystem, were screened in A. deliciosa leaves inoculated with the pandemic PSA strain CRA-FRU 8. 43 . To determine the specificity of the primer pairs used in this study, melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed following the RT-qPCR experiment. A single peak in the obtained melting curve confirmed the specificity of the amplicon, and no signal was detected in the negative controls for all of the tested RGs (see Supplementary Fig. S2 online) . In addition, a single band with the expected size was detected in a single PCR product (see Supplementary Fig. S3 online) . The standard curve method using a pool of all of the cDNA samples was performed to calculate the PCR efficiency (E) and the correlation coefficient (R2) of each primer pair. Average E values ranged from 100.7 to 108.2%, with R 2 varying from 0.991 to 0.999 (Table 1 ). The results showed that all of the primer pairs were suitable for RT-qPCR analysis. Expression levels of the reference genes. RT-qPCR was used to quantify the mRNA levels of nine candidate RGs, and the expression stability was investigated. To determine the expression levels of the candidate RGs, the raw quantification cycle (Cq) values were determined. The nine candidate RGs displayed a wide expression range, with Cq ranging from 20.23 to 31.31 , across all of the tested samples, with mean Cq values between 22.06 ± 0.92 and 28.58 ± 0.86 (Fig. 1 ). All of the tested RGs showed a normal distribution in Cq values according to the Kolmogorov and Smirnov method. These genes were clearly distributed into different expression level categories. The results showed that CYP was the most expressed gene with the lowest mean Cq (22.06 ). On the other hand, GLO7A was the least expressed gene with the highest mean Cq value (28.58) . TUB showed the most variation in expression level among the evaluated RGs by the larger whisker taps and boxes compared to the other genes, suggesting its low stability. Most of the candidate RGs were highly expressed, with average Cq values between 22 and 24 cycles, except SAND and GLO7A, which showed average Cq values at intermediate expression levels (Fig. 1 ).
