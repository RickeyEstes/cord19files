During the study period, 718 consecutive patients were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of respiratory infection and dyspnea according to ICD-9-CM guidelines. 18 We included 155 patients based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In six patients with the clinical criteria for chronic bronchitis, spirometry was not performed in the follow-up. Finally, 17 of the 148 remaining patients were submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com Dovepress Dovepress excluded because the follow-up spirometry readings were not compatible with an infection. Thus, we studied 132 patients with AE-COPD of a probable infectious origin who met the inclusion criteria and had no other causes of acute decompensation (Figure 1 ). The demographics of the patients and the baseline characteristics of AE-COPD are presented in Tables 1 and 3 . The patients were hospitalized in the following departments: Internal Medicine (48.5%), Pneumology (33.3%), and the Short Stay Unit (18.2%). Over the course of two years, the admissions peaks coincided with seasonal variations, exhibiting two annual peaks (spring and winter) (Figure 2) . A total of 51 pathogens were isolated. Of these, 37 were bacterial and 14 were viral. Of the 73 sputum samples surveyed, 19 were Grampositive, 17 were Gram-negative, and 37 contained polymorphonuclear cells without bacteria. In addition, Ziehl-Neelsen staining was performed in 26 samples, all of which had a negative result. The culture results were positive in 34 patients (Table 2) , with higher numbers of patients exhibiting H. influenzae and P. aeruginosa. We obtained two positive serologies for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1.5%) and one for Chlamydia pneumoniae (0.8%). An NPL was collected from all patients to detect a possible viral etiology. We identified a positive result in 14 patients and found herpes virus type-1 in two patients. The detection of herpes virus type-1 was attributed to contamination. So then, we identified a positive result from viral techniques in 12 patients. An etiological agent was identified in 48 of the patients (36.3%), and an unknown AE-COPD etiology was assigned to 84 patients (63.7%). A bacterial agent was identified as the etiological agent in 33 patients ( (1.5%), E. coli plus influenza A virus and P. aeruginosa plus coronavirus. The efficiencies of the diagnostic tests are shown in Table 2 . We compared the characteristics of the patients using bacterial and viral isolation. When we assessed the clinical and analytical parameters of AE-COPD according to etiological diagnoses, no significant differences were observed, with the exception of the lymphocyte count for the patients whose AE-COPD was attributed to a virus (Table 3) . We obtained statistically significant differences between the analytical datasets for the patients with known and unknown etiologies. In patients with an unknown etiology, we observed a greater decrease in the pH and pO2 in the baseline arterial blood gas upon arrival at the emergency room, as well as a greater leukocytosis and increased heart rate ( Table 3) .
