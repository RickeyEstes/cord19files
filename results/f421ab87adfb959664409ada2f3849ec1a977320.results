In 2014, 44% (192/438) of samples tested positive for EV-D68 vs. 10% (13/130) in 2011-13 (p<0.0001). PICU admissions (p<0.0001) and non-invasive ventilation (p<0.0001) were more common in children with EV-D68 vs. RV/EV-non-EV-D68 infections. Asthmatic EV-D68+ children, required supplemental oxygen administration (p = 0.03) and PICU admissions (p <0.001) more frequently than healthy children or those with chronic medical conditions; however oxygen duration (p<0.0001), and both PICU and total hospital stay (p<0.01)
