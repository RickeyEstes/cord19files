Effect of CQ on B19V replication in UT7/Epo cells CQ increased the production of B19V NS1 gene transcription after 24 h incubation. At CQ concentrations ranging from 10 to 75 mM, NS1 RNA increased up to 1,170% ( Figure 1A) . Similarly, kinetic studies in the presence of 25 mM of CQ showed that viral DNA synthesis was more rapid and extensive than in untreated cells ( Figure 1B) . The expression of structural viral proteins in extracts of infected UT7/Epo cells was also increased in the presence of 25 mM CQ ( Figure 1C ). Viral protein expression was Immunofluorescence experiments showed, that in the presence of CQ a larger number of cells were infected by B19V (Fig. 1D ).
