We immortalized memory B cells from four vaccinated donors and then tested monoclonal antibodies for their rabies neutralizing activity and epitope specificity. We selected two antibodies, identified as RVC20 and RVC58 as highly potent and broadly neutralizing a panel of 60 lyssaviruses (including rabies and non-rabies viruses), widely representatives of the global viral diversity. The potency and breadth shown by the two selected antibodies were higher than those detected in commercially available human RIG and in previously discovered antibodies under clinical development. Our antibody cocktail (RVC20 + RVC58), experimentally administered as alternative to commercially available RIG according to current PEP protocols, was able to protect Syrian hamsters from a lethal rabies virus challenge and did not impact on vaccine immunogenicity in hamsters.
