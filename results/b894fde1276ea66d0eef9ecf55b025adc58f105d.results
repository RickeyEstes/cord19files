CM-II-sPLA 2 possesses potent virucidal activity against HCV, DENV and JEV, which bud through the ER membrane, but not against other viruses that bud through the PM. First, we tested the possible direct virucidal activity of CM-II-sPLA 2 (UniProtKB-P00603 [PA2B2_NAJMO]) against infectious particles of a panel of viruses. Each virus was incubated with various concentrations of CM-II-sPLA 2 or medium as a control at 37 Â°C for 1 h and then inoculated onto Huh7it-1 cells. After 1 h of virus adsorption, the residual virus was removed by washing the cells with medium and the cells were cultured for 24 h. The cells were subjected to fluorescent antibody (FA) staining with respective antiviral antibodies to determine the number of virus-infected cells, which represented the inoculum's viral titres (cell-infecting units [CIU]/ml). In some experiments, a plaque assay and 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assay were performed to determine the viral titres of the inocula (plaque-forming units [PFU]/ml and TCID 50 /ml, respectively). The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was calculated based on the percent reduction of the initial viral titre. The results demonstrated that CM-II-sPLA 2 efficiently neutralised the infectivity of HCV, DENV and JEV, with 50%-inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of 0.036 ng/ml (0.003 nM), 0.31 ng/ml (0.023 nM) and 1.34 ng/ml (0.10 nM), respectively ( Table 1 ). The dose-dependent inhibition of the viruses by CM-II-sPLA 2 is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 . HCV, DENV and JEV belong to the family Flaviviridae and are known to bud through the ER membrane [11] [12] [13] . Conversely, CM-II-sPLA 2 even at a dose of 10,000 ng/ml did not exert significant virucidal activity against Sindbis virus (SINV; Togaviridae) 27 , influenza A virus (FLUAV; Orthomyxoviridae) and Sendai virus (SeV; Paramyxoviridae) 28 , which are known to bud through the PM, or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1; Herpesviridae), which buds through the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 29 . Vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSNJV; Rhabdoviridae), which also buds through the PM 30 , showed weak sensitivity to CM-II-sPLA 2 , with an IC 50 value of 2,300 ng/ml. The weak CM-II-sPLA 2 sensitivity of VSNJV compared to the insensitivity of SINV, FLUAV and HSV-1 could be attributable to the bullet-shape configuration of VSNJV, which might harbour lipid packing defects at the bottom edge of the bullet-shape particles. CM-II-sPLA 2 inhibited HIV infection with an IC 50 of 5.4 ng/ml. This result is consistent with a previous observation that sPLA 2 obtained from bee and snake venoms inhibited HIV entry into host cells without disrupting the HIV particles 19 . We also tested Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which is a member of family Coronaviridae that is known to bud through the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) 31 . The ERGIC constitutes part of the ER-NE-cis-Golgi territory and therefore is considered to have similar characteristics with the ER. Rather unexpectedly, we found that CM-II-sPLA 2 exerted only marginal, if any, virucidal activity against MERS-CoV, with an IC 50 of 10,000 ng/ml. We assume that the exceptionally large petal-shaped spikes that project approximately 20 nm from the virion envelope, which is a characteristic feature of members of Coronaviridae 31 , interfere with the access of CM-II-sPLA 2 to the envelope lipid bilayer. Alternatively, a dose-dependent inhibition pattern (see panel (d) in Supplementary Fig. S1 ) may imply the possibility that there are two groups of MERS-CoV particles: one that is sensitive to 100 ng/ml of CM-II-sPLA 2 and another that is resistant to 10,000 ng/ ml of CM-II-sPLA 2 . The latter group may represent viral particles that have budded through the PM, as reported previously 32 . Further studies are needed to elucidate the issue. As expected, CM-II-sPLA 2 did not neutralize the infectivity of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and coxsackievirus B3 (CV-B3), which belong to family Picornaviridae and do not possess envelopes 33 , even at the 10,000 ng/ml dose.
