1. Immune defence-altered pooled plasma proteins (Idea-PP) bind with high affinity to HIV-1 gp120, its receptor CD4 and to PDI To investigate the consequences of protein modification by the myeloperoxidase/HOCl immune defence system pooled plasma proteins were isolated from human plasma, modified by HOCl to generate Idea-PP and subsequently tested for their capacity to bind to HIV-1 gp120, its receptor CD4 and to the PDI. As a control unaltered pooled plasma proteins (PP) were used for the binding studies. ELISA assays showed specific binding to gp120, CD4 as well as to the PDI for Idea-PP, whereas binding of the non-modified original material to GP120 and CD4 was not significant (Fig. 1A, B) . Some binding of the non-modified original material to the PDI was observed, but the binding to the HOClaltered material was significantly higher. Binding was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrometry. SPR demonstrated that immobilized gp120, CD4 as well as PDI bind Idea-PP with very high affinity (Fig. 1D, E, F) . The sensorgrams could have been fitted to a Langmuir model using BiaEvaluation Software 3.1 (GE Healthcare) to gain quantitative data, but the off-rates were too slow to be reliably estimated by this method. The association phase of a BIAcore experiment is also affected by the dissociation rate. Inherent in the fitting method is in addition the assumption that the association and dissociation rates are true for a one-to-one interaction model. As Idea-PP is a mixture of proteins and several of them oligomerize and presumably present several binding sites, this model cannot be used and therefore no reliable quantitative data can be given. In all control experiments using unmodified plasma protein the response units (RU) in SPR were below 10. Thus Idea-PPs represent putative therapeutic agents to interfere with viral binding to and fusion with host cells.
