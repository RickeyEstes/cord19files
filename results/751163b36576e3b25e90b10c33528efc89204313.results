A total of 3403 cases and 63 deaths were notified in the Weekly Reports during the 15-week period ( Table 1 ). The three most frequent conditions reported were: Severe Acute Malnutrition (30%), Moderate Acute Malnutrition (25%) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (17%). The three most frequent causes of death were: Maternal Mortality (33%), Severe Acute Malnutrition (21%) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (19%). A total of 26 cases and 4 deaths were notified as Alerts. Over the 15-week period, a total of 530 Weekly Reports and 15 Alerts (together comprising 8378 SMS messages) were received by the server. Of these 530 weekly reports, 271reports (51%) (comprising 5420 SMS) were complete and validated; 71 (13%) were incomplete, and 188 (36%) were rejected. Incomplete and rejected reports were corrected and re-sent by the focal points, sometimes multiple times, thereby increasing the time to report completion; reports would be considered complete and validated only after review and approval by the Director of Surveillance. Overall, the median completeness of Weekly Reports was significantly higher in MK 2016 (81% (IQR 81-86%)) than in MK 2015 (29% (IQR 24-36%)) and NM 2016 (52% (IQR 48-57%)) (p < 0.01; Fig. 4a) . Similarly, the median timeliness of complete reports was significantly higher in MK 2016 (50% (IQR 39-57%)), than in MK 2015 (19% (IQR 19-24%)) and NM 2016 (29% (IQR 24-36%)) (p < 0.001; Fig. 4b ). The median duration of transmission of complete reports was 12 h (IQR 1-63 h). If one were to consider timeliness as the receipt of the first SMS transmission of a Weekly Report, the timeliness in MK 2016 would be 74% (IQR 60-80%). Figure 5 shows the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for time to transmit a complete Weekly Report grouped by 3-week time periods during the pilot. There was a significant progressive reduction in transmission time over the 15-week period (p < 0.01). Consistently each week, health centers across the district initiated electronic transmission of the Weekly Reports as required by the study protocol (96% of occasions); notably, sub-districts showed no significant difference in this regard (Table 2 ). Yet, completed transmission and report timeliness was significantly lower in a number of sub-districts in both centrally-located lowrisk security zones, and in more distant medium-risk security zones. The mean scoring of the usability of the app reported by the 21 focal points was 4 . 5-5/5 for all 27 questions on the three dimensions studied: ease of use, usefulness and efficiency (data not shown). The total cost for the 15-week pilot was US$40,575. This was composed of i) US$10,950 in capital costs: 30 smartphones (US$2250), 30 solar chargers (US$2700), and two laptop computers (US$6000)); ii) US$5200 communication fees (US$1800 fleet services, US$3400 SMS charges); iii) US$225 transportation costs in three isolated health facilities iv) US$4100 local personnel, and v) IT consultant services based in Geneva (US$20,100). It is estimated that to maintain the system in the 21 health facilities of MK will cost approximately US$18,800 per year in communication fees; this represents US$17.20 per health facility per week.
