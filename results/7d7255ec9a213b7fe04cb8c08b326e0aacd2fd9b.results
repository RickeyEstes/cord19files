The NIS data provided a total of 5,172 LD cases from 447,132 hospitalizations for bacterial pneumonia ( Table  1) . After applying the discharge weights to produce a national-level estimate and before applying any exclusion rules other than reporting month and year, the NIS series compares favorably to CDC's reported monthly LD estimates (23), with a correlation of 0.74. After applying exclusion rules (age >18 years and provision of a complete set of predictor variables), we had data on 3,005 LD cases and 189,412 hospitalizations for pneumonia. The most common reasons for exclusion were lack of the AHA ID, admission month and year, and race, because some states elected not to report these variables. We compared several demographic and severity measures between the portion of the data dropped because of missing values and the proportion retained (Table 2) . Among the cases, the only substantial difference was in the percentage of patients not insured; for 10.8% of dropped records, no insurance was reported, compared with 7.4% of those used in the model. Many statistically significant differences existed between the controls retained and those lost; however, the large sample size (retained sample n = 189,412) meant many non-clinically relevant differences would be statistically significant. In general, hospitalized persons with LD were younger than those with other bacterial pneumonia and more likely to be male (Table 3) . We found a large unadjusted In the regression analysis, the primary variables of interest-mean temperature, mean relative humidity, and their interaction-were all significant (likelihood ratio test against model with only main effects, χ 2 test statistic = 350.42; p<0.0001) ( Table 4 , https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/ EID/article/23/11/17-0137-T4.htm). Although total rainfall was independently a risk factor for LD, the effects of temperature and humidity were still significant. The combination of the temperature and humidity main effects and interactions can make understanding the combined effect difficult. For this reason, we separately reported the estimated composite odds ratios for each combination (Table 5) . Additionally, because odds ratios can be difficult to interpret, we provide the expected probabilities for a 61-70-year-old white man on Medicare admitted to a hospital at 42°N in April 2011 at the 3 different rainfall levels ( Table 6 ). The relationship between temperature and relative humidity exhibits the Goldilocks principle: when it is too hot (>80°F) or too cold (<60°F), the odds of LD do not vary with humidity, but when the temperature is "just right" (60°-80°F), the odds have a dose-response pattern with humidity. The largest effect of this relationship between temperature and humidity was evident for warm and very humid months across all 3 rainfall levels. We determined the monthly percentage of bacterial pneumonia discharges for which an LD diagnosis had been given within HCUP by US Census region ( Figure  2 ). Percentages were relatively high in the Northeast and somewhat lower in the Midwest and South. The frequencies in the West were the lowest of all 4 regions and appeared not to be seasonal. The changes around 2002-2003 in all of the series are present in other data sources (23) . The exact cause is unknown but is thought to be related to increased vigilance, testing, and reporting of atypical pneumonia after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (24) . We also determined the probability of a case of bacterial pneumonia being diagnosed as LD in 2011 using the local weather data. We restricted this prediction to the states used to estimate the model (Figure 3) . We set the nonweather, nonlocation covariates to their modal values for patients hospitalized with bacterial pneumonia (white 61-70-year-old man on Medicare) and used the weather station latitude and monthly average temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The estimated probabilities of LD (Figure 3 ) are the fitted values from the model described by Table  4 and these covariate values. Since the ISD is national in scope, we extrapolated from the model estimated using HCUP data to the entire United States, including non-HCUP regions (Figure 4 ). The risk for LD varied considerably by location (low risk along the Gulf Coast and relatively low risk in the West) and calendar month (high-risk areas such as the Mid-Atlantic region are only actually at high risk during June-September and are at low risk during December-April) (Figure 4 ).
