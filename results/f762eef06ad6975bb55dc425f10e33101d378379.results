Enhanced presentation of exogenously loaded peptides to CTLs by the H74L mutant Previous studies demonstrated that the mutant HLA-A*02:01 molecule with the H74L mutation possessed the unique ability to enhance the presentation of exogenously loaded peptides to peptide-specific CTLs. 5, 18 To confirm these results in the HHD system, we firstly constructed a mutant HHD gene that could generate this mutation in the HHD molecule (HHD-H74L) ( Figure  1a ,b) by the inverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based sitedirected mutagenesis. The HHD-H74L gene was then transfected and expressed in mouse lymphoma, RMA cells (RMA-H74L). The expression level of the H74L mutant molecules on RMA-H74L cells was almost equivalent to that of the HHD molecules on RMA cells expressing the WT HHD (RMA-HHD). To test the ability of the H74L mutant, HLA-A*02:01-restricted, peptide-specific CTL lines were generated from HHD mice, and examined for their killing activities against RMA-HHD and RMA-H74L in the presence of synthetic peptides at various concentrations in standard 51 Cr-release assays. Consistent with the previous data, 5 RMA-H74L cells were lysed by influenza A matrix peptide (FMP 58-66 )-specific CTLs at much lower peptide concentrations than RMA-HHD cells (Figure 1c ). Similar results were obtained with different HLA-A*02:01-restricted peptides derived from human papillomavirus (HPV)-E6 (HPV-E6 [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] ), human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-tax (HTLV-tax [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] ) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-pol (HIV-pol 476-484 ) (Figure 1c ), indicating that this phenomenon was not peptide-specific as described in the previous studies. 18 The peptide-binding studies were conducted using the transporter associated antigen processing-2 (TAP-2) deficient cell line, RMA-S 19 expressing HHD (RMA-S-HHD) or HHD-H74L (RMA-S-H74L). As shown in Figure 1d , the efficiency of peptide loading on the HHD molecule was significantly increased by the H74L mutation, suggesting that the improved peptide loading may result in the enhanced presentation of exogenous peptides to CTLs by the H74L mutation (Figure 1c) . A series of amino acid substitutions at position 74 of the HHD molecule were also tested for their effects on the peptide presentation to FMP 58-66 -specific CTLs. In addition to H74L, three other mutations involving H74A, H74F, and H74T apparently enhanced the peptide presentation in the FMP 58-66 -specific CTL response (Figure 1e ). In contrast, several mutations including H74E, H74K, H74N, and H74Y impaired the FMP 58-66 -specific CTL recognition. These data suggest that the effect of the H74 mutation depends on the amino acid to be substituted from histidine. These data show that the functional phenotype of the H74L mutation in the HHD system is likely to be equal to that of the mutant HLA-A*02:01 with the H74L mutation as described previously. 5, 18 Construction of the SCT of HHD-H74L It is well documented that the SCTs are potent stimulators of peptide-specific CTLs in vivo. 6, 9, 20 The SCT polypeptide comprises three MHC class I components including an antigenic peptide, β2m and the MHC class I heavy chain attached sequentially with flexible linkers. 6 Given the unique property of the H74L mutant, we hypothesized that the SCTs of HHD-H74L could prime peptidespecific CTLs in vivo more efficiently than the SCTs composed of WT HHD. To prove this hypothesis, we produced SCT constructs consisting of the following elements beginning with the amino terminus: the leader sequence of β2m, the FMP 58-66 peptide, the first flexible linker of 15 residues, the mature portion of human β2m, the second flexible linker of 15 residues, and, finally, the heavy chain of the HHD (SCT-HHD) or HHD-H74L (SCT-H74L) molecule (Figure 2a,b) . When the SCT-HHD or SCT-H74L construct was stably expressed in the TAP-2-deficient cell line, RMA-S, there was an apparent increase of the expression level of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface at 37°C in comparison with RMA-S-HHD in the absence of an exogenous peptide (Figure 1c ). These results implied that SCT-HHD or SCT-H74L was expressed on the cell surface even in the absence of endogenous peptides, suggesting that the SCT molecules are likely to bypass MHC class I antigen processing due to their preassembled forms. In the previous studies, DNA vaccinations were employed for stimulating peptide-specific CTLs with MHC class I SCTs in vivo. 6, 9, 11 Although this approach has several advantages, the efficiency of CTL induction is relatively weak. Therefore, we generated a recombinant adenovirus expressing either SCT-HHD (Ad-SCT-HHD) or SCT-H74L (Ad-SCT-H74L) for in vivo priming in this study. As a control, a recombinant adenovirus expressing the full-length influenza A matrix protein (Ad-FMP) was used. Viral titers were accurately calculated by the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ).
