Among patients hospitalized with RSV (n = 645) during the study period, RSV infection was detected by multiplex PCR in 91.8% and by culture in 8.2% of patients. Among patients hospitalized with influenza (n = 1878) during the study period, influenza infection was detected by multiplex PCR in 82.6%, by influenza A/B/H1N1 PCR in 0.05%, and by culture in 17.4% of patients. The distribution of demographic characteristics, medical history, and comorbidities of patients hospitalized with RSV (n = 645) or with influenza (n = 1878) is presented in Table 1 . Patients hospitalized with RSV infection were slightly older (mean age, 78.5 vs 77.4 years; P = .035), with a higher proportion of those aged ≥85 years compared to those hospitalized with influenza infection. There was a higher proportion of females in the RSV cohort than in the influenza cohort (60.5% vs 50.3% female; P < .001). Race/ethnicity distributions were similar between the RSV and the influenza cohorts. A higher proportion of RSV patients than influenza patients had received influenza vaccine in the 1 year prior to admission (83.1% vs 73.1%; P < .001). Smoking status and body mass index were similar between cohorts. The prevalence of several comorbidities was significantly different between patients hospitalized with RSV and those with influenza, including congestive heart failure (35.3% vs 24.5%; P < .001), diabetes (38.9% vs 44.6%; P = .012), COPD/chronic bronchitis/emphysema (29.8% vs 24.3%; P = .006), asthma (26.0% vs 18.6%; P < .001), any solid cancer (11.2% vs 8.0%; P = .016), and leukemia (1.9% vs 0.9%; P = .050). Use of any antiviral therapy, including oseltamivir, within 14 days prior to admission was not common but was more prevalent in the RSV cohort than the influenza cohort (4.3% vs 2.7%; P = .034 for any antiviral medication and 2.3% vs 1.1%; P = .026 for oseltamivir; data not shown). The in-hospital characteristics of the RSV and influenza cohorts are described in Table 2 . The mean time from admission to the first positive test result for either RSV or influenza was similar between the 2 cohorts (2.5 vs 2.6 days; P = .570), and approximately 98% of patients in either cohort did not have test results available until some time after the hospital admission date. Among the RSV and influenza cohorts, respectively, use of antivirals (47.1% vs 78.6%; P < .001), 99% of which was oseltamivir (data not shown); antibiotics (94.1% vs 88.9%; P < .001); and any inhalation, injection, intravenous, or oral steroid (64.5% vs 47.9%; P < .001) during the hospitalization period was significantly different. In the adjusted analyses, the odds of all outcomes were similar or significantly higher among participants hospitalized with RSV compared to those hospitalized with influenza ( Figure 1 ). Hospital utilization was greater among those infected with RSV than with influenza as measured by length of stay ≥7 days among the entire population (OR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7), length of stay ≥7 days among survivors (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.8), and ICU admission (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7). In addition, respiratory complications during hospitalization were more common among RSV-infected older adults including pneumonia diagnosis (OR = 2.7; 95% CI, 2.2-3.2); highest measured respiratory rate (RR; measured by breaths per minute; RR ≥26 vs ≤22 reference group [OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9]); lowest oxygen saturation (≤84% vs ≥93% reference group [OR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1]); greatest level of oxygen supplementation (≥16 L/min vs ≤5 L/min reference group [OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0-2.2]); exacerbation of COPD, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema (OR = 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4); and exacerbation of asthma (OR = 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-1.9). More older adults infected with RSV than with influenza required home health service after discharge (OR = 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6). While mortality during hospitalization (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.7) and within 6 months of admission (OR = 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9-1.5) for patients with RSV did not differ significantly from those with influenza, long-term mortality within 1 year of admission was significantly greater in the RSV cohort compared to the influenza cohort (OR = 1.3, 95% CI, 1.0-1.6). The 1-year survival rate after admission was significantly lower (Figure 2 , 74.2% vs 81.2%; P < .001) in older adults hospitalized with RSV compared to those hospitalized with influenza.
