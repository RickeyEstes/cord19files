Generation of gs11 mutated recombinant RVs. Recombinant rotaviruses (simian rotavirus A strain SA11) carrying different mutations in the NSP5 coding region of gs11 were obtained using a recently developed reverse-genetics protocol (29) . Two essential additional modifications were introduced to trans-complement the potential loss of NSP5 function in the rRV mutants: (i) an additional plasmid, pcDNA3-NSP5 (T7 and cytomegalovirus [CMV] promoter driven), encoding the open reading frame (ORF) of wild-type (wt) NSP5 (i.e., without gs11 5= and 3= untranslated regions [UTRs]), was included in the transfection step of BHK-T7 cells, and (ii) each rescued rRV was amplified in a stable transfectant cell line, MA104-NSP5 (MA-NSP5), supplying the wt NSP5 in trans. Crucially, we have successfully established a novel MA-NSP5 cell line to support the replication of NSP5-deficient recombinant viruses to enable their further in-depth characterization. Both steps i and ii were absolutely required for rescuing the NSP5/KO virus, confirming the essential role of NSP5 for RV replication. These mutants, as well as additional stable cell lines generated for this study as described in Materials and Methods, are summarized in Table 1 . rRV-NSP5/KO. NSP5 expression and localization to viroplasms in virus-infected cells have been considered essential for virus replication (12, 13, 25, 31) . Previous studies, using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting gs11 mRNA, have shown strong impairment of RV replication (12, 13) . In order to investigate the effects of point mutations and deletions within the NSP5 gene, we took advantage of the established transcomplementing MA104 cell line stably expressing NSP5. In addition, we also made two cell lines expressing NSP2-mCherry and NSP5-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusions, which are rapidly and efficiently recruited into viroplasms upon virus infection (Table 1) (7, 22) . Here, we provide a direct demonstration of the role of NSP5 in RV replication, using an NSP5 knockout rRV (termed rRV-NSP5/KO) generated by reverse genetics. To rescue the NSP5/KO strain, a stop codon at residue 18Y was introduced ( Fig. 1A and B) . Analysis of MA104 virus-infected cell extracts confirmed the presence of NSP2 and VP2 but not of NSP5 ( Fig. 2A) . Moreover, we did not detect viroplasms containing NSP2, VP2, or VP6 in either MA104-infected cells or stable transfectant cell lines expressing the fluorescent fusion protein NSP2-mCherry or NSP5-EGFP (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, this suggests that the NSP5-EGPF fusion protein is not able to trans-complement the lack of NSP5, and indeed the rRV-NSP5/KO strain does not replicate in MA-NSP5-EGFP cells (Fig. 2C) . Furthermore, both genomic dsRNA synthesis (Fig. 2D ) and infectious progeny virus production were completely abrogated in MA104 cells but not in the transcomplementing MA-NSP5 cell line (Fig. 2E ). Together, these data confirm that NSP5 is essential for RV replication. rRVs with impaired NSP5 phosphorylation. To address the role of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation, we then generated a number of rRVs harboring NSP5 mutations previously known to impact NSP5 phosphorylation. We first generated an rRV carrying an S67A mutation (rRV-NSP5/S67A) ( Table 1 and Fig. 3A and B). Its replication in wild-type MA104 cells was strongly impaired (Fig. 3B , right panel), resulting in approximately a 100-fold reduction of the infectious progeny virus titer at different time points postinfection (Fig. 3C ). Despite the overall reduction of replication fitness, the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant virus was stable after 10 passages in the wild-type MA104 cells, confirmed by the sequencing of the progeny virus. Consistent with our previous results, the NSP5/S67A mutant was not hyperphosphorylated in all cell lines tested, including MA104, U2OS, and Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3D) , further confirming the role of Ser67 in the initiation of NSP5 phosphorylation cascade (24) . While the wild-type rRV (rRV-wt) yielded multiple hyperphosphorylated NSP5 isoforms, the NSP5/S67A mutant mostly produced a single, homogeneous form of NSP5 with an apparent mass of 26 kDa that could be detected in the virus-infected cell extracts at 5 or 10 h postinfection (hpi) (Fig.  3E ). Enzymatic dephosphorylation with -protein phosphatase (-Ppase) and alkaline calf intestinal Ppase (CIP), previously used to discriminate phosphorylated from nonphosphorylated NSP5 (19) , further corroborated the observed lack of NSP5/S67A phosphorylation (Fig. 3F) . Because of the differences in the molecular weight markers used, the NSP5 band with the fastest PAGE mobility has been traditionally described as 26 kDa, and the most abundant one as 28 kDa. Since this nomenclature has been used in many publications, we prefer to maintain it, despite the fact that current PAGE migrations do not correspond to the markers presently used. We then generated two additional rRVs harboring truncated versions of NSP5, one lacking the 18-aa-long C-terminal tail (rRV-NSP5/ΔT) and the second one with a 5-aa deletion (176-YKKKY-180) just upstream of the tail region (rRV-NSP5/Δ176-180) ( Table  1 and Fig. 1A and B). The mutant lacking the tail (NSP5/ΔT) has been previously reported as phosphorylation negative when expressed alone in MA104 cells and unable to multimerize (32), while unpublished data from our lab indicated that the NSP5/ Δ176-180 mutant also showed no hyperphosphorylation. Despite the presence of Ser67, and the lack of Thr and Ser residues within the deletions, both mutants did not show a classical hyperphosphorylation pattern (Fig. 4A ) and failed to replicate, confirmed by the absence of de novo synthesis of genomic dsRNA (Fig. 4B) . We also investigated viroplasm formation in cells infected with these rRV mutants. During early infection (5 hpi), the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant produced structures resembling viroplasms that appeared smaller and more heterogeneous in shape than the regular, spherical ones produced during rRV-wt infection ( Interestingly, these structures produced by rRV-NSP5/S67A were morphologically similar to those observed during wt RV infection of MA104 cells silenced for CK1␣, previously shown to be required for NSP5 phosphorylation (25) . NSP2-mCherry and NSP5-EGFP fusion proteins were also recruited to both types of these structures (Fig.  5C ), suggesting that the observed lack of phosphorylation does not affect NSP2-NSP5 interactions. Furthermore, the NSP5/S67A mutant and additional viroplasmic proteins, NSP2, VP6, and VP2 (Fig. 5D ), were all present in the aberrant structures, suggesting that they could also represent sites of virus replication. In contrast, no viroplasms containing NSP5, NSP2, or VP2 were observed when MA104 cells were infected with the rRV-NSP5/ΔT and rRV-NSP5/Δ176-180 deletion mutants. Interestingly, some cells infected with these mutants yielded fiber-like structures containing only the VP6 protein ( Fig. 5E and F). One possibility is that the appearance of these structures depends on the relative concentration of nonphosphorylated NSP5 in virus-infected cells. Similar VP6 fibers are normally formed when VP6 is overexpressed in cells in the absence of other viral proteins (33, 34) . Taken together, these results confirm the role of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation for controlling the assembly of regular-shaped viroplasms, highlighting the key role of the C-terminal tail in the formation of RV viral factories. RNA accumulation in aberrant structures. Having examined the viral protein composition of the aberrant viroplasms formed during infection with rRVs exhibiting impaired NSP5 phosphorylation, we then assessed their RNA content. Viral RNA transcripts were labeled by incorporation of 5-ethynyl uridine (5-EU) in actinomycin D-treated RV-infected cells, and total viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) was visualized by a reaction with Alexa Fluor 488 azide, as described in Materials and Methods. As expected, most viral transcripts localized in viroplasms of rRV-wt-infected cells (Fig. 6A) , consistent with the roles of viroplasms in supporting viral replication and assembly. In contrast, no viral RNA transcripts could be detected in the aberrant structures in either wt MA104 or MA-NSP2-mCherry cells infected with the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant (Fig. 6A ). RNA accumulation in viroplasms was instead restored by infection with MA-NSP5 cells that supply wild-type NSP5 in trans (Fig. 6A , lower panel). Although we did not detect RNA in aberrant structures (or viroplasms) in rRV-NSP5/ S67A-infected MA104 cells by 5-EU staining, this mutant could still replicate (Fig. 3C ). We then explored whether rRV-NSP5/S67A transcripts could accumulate in viroplasms, albeit with a much lower efficiency, i.e., beyond the sensitivity limit of 5-EU staining. For this purpose, we used single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to identify the sites of RV transcription. At 10 hpi, abundant gs6 transcripts could be detected in all viroplasms identified in MA-NSP5-EGFP cells infected with rRV-wt ( Fig. 6B) . Conversely, the rRV-NSP5/S67A-infected cells had sparse EGFP-tagged structures, but less than 20% of them contain gs6 RNA ( Fig. 6B and C) . Interestingly, the less frequently occurring rod-like aberrant structures also showed gs6 RNA accumulation, further suggesting that these structures could represent replication-functional organelles. In contrast, smFISH performed on cells infected with rRV-NSP5/ΔT showed diffuse distribution of gs6 RNA that did not localize to any structures resembling viroplasms (Fig. 6B) , also failing to support the virus genome replication (Fig. 4B) . We then examined the ultrastructures of viroplasms with altered morphologies in the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant by using electron microscopy. Upon infection with rRV-wt (Fig. 7A, left panel) , multiple membraneless electron-dense inclusions encircled by the well-defined endoplasmic reticulum (ER) filled with triple-layered particles (TLPs) were present in the cells. At late infection points (10 hpi), ER filled with TLPs appeared to adopt a more tubular morphology, suggesting a successive step in the virus egress. In contrast, the rRV-NSP5/S67A-infected cells contained only a few immature viroplasms that lacked the ER network filled with TLPs (Fig. 7A, right panel) . Only a few immature particles containing transient lipid membranes could be identified in cells infected with the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant (Fig. 7A, right panel) . Furthermore, the observed immature viroplasms also appeared to be less electron dense, likely due to their lower RNA composition and subsequently decreased number of available phosphate groups that bind contrasting UO 2ϩ ions during the electron microscopy (EM) staining procedure. Together, these data strongly support the role of NSP5 phosphorylation in maintaining the viral RNA production and genome replication in viroplasms. Mechanism of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation. We have previously proposed a model of the hierarchical NSP5 hyperphosphorylation associated with the assembly of viroplasms that involves a three-step mechanism: (i) an initial interaction of nonphos- phorylated NSP5 with NSP2 (or VP2), (ii) phosphorylation of Ser67 by CK1␣ (this step does not take place when NSP5 is expressed alone), and (iii) hyperphosphorylation of NSP5 triggered by Ser67 phosphorylation that requires the 18-aa-long C-terminal tail (24) . Here, we investigated the phosphorylation mechanism of NSP5 during RV infection using a number of NSP5 phosphorylation-negative rRV strains and MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines (Table 1) . We demonstrated that despite the presence of Ser67, deletion mutant NSP5/ΔT was not phosphorylated and failed to form viroplasms. We have previously shown that coexpression of NSP5/ΔT was also unable to trigger the phosphorylation cascade of NSP5/S67A, while other NSP5 mutants referred to here as activators of phosphorylation, e.g., NSP5/Δ3, did (24) . Interestingly, upon coinfection with two rRVs, NSP5/S67A and NSP5/ΔT, neither of the mutated NSP5 variants were phosphorylated (Fig. 8A) (8, 19, 24, 26) . This result was supported further by infecting the MA104 transfectant cell line stably expressing NSP5-ΔT (MA-ΔT) with the rRV-NSP5/ S67A strain (Table 1 and Fig. 8B, lanes 3 and 4) . The NSP5/Δ176-180 mutant was also unable to induce phosphorylation of NSP5/S67A following coinfection with the two rRVs, despite both containing Ser67 and the C-terminal tail. This result suggests that the "activator" NSP5 needs to also be hyperphosphorylated (Fig. 8C ). In MA-ΔT cells infected with the rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant strain, aberrant viroplasms similar to those observed in wt MA104 cells (Fig. 8E) were produced, which did not support virus replication compared to the wt virus (Fig. 8F) . In contrast to NSP5/ΔT, the NSP5 deletion mutant lacking amino acids 80 to 130 (NSP5/Δ3) becomes hyperphosphorylated when expressed alone and can function as an activator of NSP5/S67A phosphorylation (19, 24) . We therefore asked whether an MA104 stable cell line expressing the deletion mutant NSP5/Δ3 (MA-Δ3) and infected with the rRV-NSP5/S67A strain was able to trigger hyperphosphorylation of NSP5/S67A and, as a consequence, sustain replication of the mutant rRV strain. As shown in Fig. 8B  (lanes 5 and 6) , NSP5/S67A was hyperphosphorylated in the presence of the NSP5/Δ3 mutant, which was confirmed by the Ppase treatment (Fig. 8D) , although it did not completely rescue the phosphorylation pattern of NSP5 normally observed in rRV-wt infection. When loading large amounts of NSP5/S67A, we have occasionally observed a second faint band with reduced mobility, as seen in Fig. 8B , lane 2 (indicated with an asterisk). Interestingly, regular round structures resembling viroplasms, containing NSP5, NSP2, and VP2 with peripheral localization of VP6, were recovered in these cells infected with rRV-NSP5/S67A, and yet viral replication was nevertheless impaired (Fig.  8E and F) . Consistently, the electron microscopy images showed structures of aberrant viroplasms similar to those obtained in MA104 wt cells (Fig. 7B, right panel) . The NSP5 phosphorylation-negative mutants of the two other rRVs (NSP5/ΔT and NSP5/Δ176-180) did not undergo hyperphosphorylation in the MA-ΔT or MA-Δ3 cell lines ( Fig. 9A and B) . In both cases, viroplasm formation and virus replication were not rescued ( Fig. 9C to E) . Interestingly, apparently normal round structures were observed in MA-Δ3 cells, which, however, recruited significantly less VP6 ( Fig. 9C and D) . In addition, the previously observed VP6 spiky structures were not detected in these cells ( Fig. 9C and D) . Similar results were obtained with the rRV-NSP5/KO virus strain, which in MA-Δ3 cells did not replicate and also showed spherical structures that contained NSP5 and NSP2 but not VP6 (Fig. 10A to C) . Taken together, our data support a model of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation which absolutely requires the presence of the C-terminal tail and amino acid residues 176 to 180. Furthermore, NSP5 hyperphosphorylation requires Ser67 phosphorylation to initiate the phosphorylation cascade, thus playing a key role in the assembly of replication-competent viral factories.
