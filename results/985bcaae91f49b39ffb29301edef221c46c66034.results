59pppRNA stimulates an antiviral response in lung epithelial A549 cells A 59 triphosphate containing RNA derived from the 59 and 39 UTRs of the negative-strand RNA virus Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) [17] was generated by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase, an enzymatic reaction that synthesizes RNA molecules with a 59ppp terminus [17] . Predicted panhandle secondary structure of the 59pppRNA is depicted in Fig. 1A ; gel analysis and nuclease sensitivity confirmed the generation of a single RNA product of the expected size (67 nucleotides). Transfection of increasing amounts of 59pppRNA resulted in Ser396 phosphorylation of IRF3 at 8 h -a hallmark of immediate early activation of the antiviral response (Fig. 1B , lane 2 to 6). Induction of apoptosis was detected following treatment with higher concentrations of 59pppRNA; the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein NOXA -a direct transcriptional target of IRF3 [40] -as well as cleavage products of caspase 3 and PARP were up-regulated in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 1B , lane 2-6). Optimal induction of antiviral signaling with limited cytotoxicity was achieved at a concentration of 10 ng/ml (,500 pM) ( Fig. 1B; lane 4) . Importantly, the stimulation of immune signaling and apoptosis was dependent on the 59ppp moiety; a homologous RNA without a 59ppp terminus abrogated stimulation over a range of RNA concentrations (Fig. 1B, lane 8-12) . To characterize the antiviral response triggered by 59pppRNA, the kinetics of downstream RIG-I signaling were measured at different times (0-48 h) after stimulation of A549 cells (Fig. 1C ). IRF3 homodimerization (1 st panel) and IRF3 phosphorylation at Ser396 (2 nd panel) were detected as early as 2 h post treatment with 59pppRNA, and sustained until 24 h. Using a newly characterized anti-IRF7 antibody, induction of endogenous IRF7 was detected with kinetics that was delayed compared to IRF3 activation (4 th vs. 3 rd panel). IkBa phosphorylation was likewise detected as early as 2 h posttreatment and was sustained in A549 cells (6 th panel). Altogether, IRF3, IRF7 and NF-kB are required for optimal induction of the IFNb promoter [27] . JAK-STAT signaling was detected at 4 h with Tyr701 phosphorylation of STAT1 (9 th panel), as well as later accumulation at 24 h (10 th panel). IFIT1 and RIG-I itself, were up-regulated 4 h post-treatment (11 th and 12 th panel) whereas a second group of ISGs (STAT1 and IRF7;
