CEACAM1 is expressed on B-cell subsets. We first analysed CEACAM1 expression on various cell populations in the peripheral blood of wild-type (WT) mice. Erythrocytes stained negative for CEACAM1 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). As previously reported [34] [35] [36] , high levels of CEACAM1 expression were detected on blood granulocytes (Ly6G þ ) and monocytes (CD115 þ ) with the anti-CEACAM1-specific monoclonal antibody (clone CC1, Fig. 1a ). Cells from Ceacam1 À / À mice stained negative for CEACAM1 (Fig. 1a) . Next, we analysed CEACAM1 expression on lymphoid cells in the blood. CD90.2 cells, representing primarily T cells, showed weak CEACAM1 expression by individual cells (Fig. 1b) , a finding suggesting that various T-cell subpopulations may differentially express CEACAM1. B cells in peripheral blood expressed CEACAM1 at high levels ( Fig. 1b) . Evaluation of precursor (B220 þ CD43 À IgM þ IgD low ) and mature B cells (B220 þ CD43 À IgD high ) in the bone marrow revealed strong CEACAM1 expression in the B-cell lineage (Fig. 1c) . In line with this finding, lymph node B cells, follicular B cells (FO, B220 þ CD19 þ CD21/35 lo CD23 hi ) and MZ B cells (B220 þ CD19 þ CD21/35 hi CD23 lo ) in the spleen expressed CEACAM1 at high levels (Fig. 1d,e) . Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR analyses of expression of long and short isoforms of CEACAM1 showed that murine splenic B cells express more long than short isoforms (Fig. 1f ). In conclusion, strong CEACAM1 expression was detected in all B-cell subpopulations tested, a finding implying that CEACAM1 is functionally relevant in B cells.
