The basic demographic data are described in Table 1 . Participants were mostly young male adults, with other characteristics largely similar. However, there were significantly less recruits amongst controls than amongst other groups. The temporal distribution of cases is described in Figure 1 . No obvious overall seasonal pattern can be observed. The peak in June and July 2009 corresponds to the FLU-A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic [16] . As this peak tailed off, we observed an increase in FLU-B cases (starting Feb-Mar 2010). Subsequently, as the FLU-B cases fell, Adenovirus E (ADV-E) cases started to increase. Coxsackie/echovirus (CV) and rhinovirus (RV) infections were consistently present in the earlier periods but appeared to tail off by 2012, corresponding to the rise in FRI cases due to other viruses. The etiologies of selected infections are illustrated in Table 2 . At least one virus was detected in 3794 of the 7733 FRI cases (49.1%). In 376 (9.0%) of the 3794 cases, more than one virus was detected and these were excluded. 4120 (53.3%) of the FRI cases fulfilled the definition of ILI; 2146 (52.1%) of these ILI cases were positive for at least 1 virus. Of the 3430 FRI mono-infection cases, 2128 (62.0%) were viral. 1259 (59.2%) of these 2128 cases met the definition of ILI. We examined the proportion of ILI cases among those with viral mono-infections (Table 3) . Influenza viruses accounted for only 40% of ILI. Among FRI cases, more than 60% of patients with influenza and adenovirus infections presented with ILI. However, several other viral infections led to high rates of ILI, including CV, Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) and CoVs. The sensivity, specifity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of ILI for influenza was 72.2%, 48.1%, 40.1% and 69.3% respectively. On From the multivariate analysis ( Figure 2 ), compared to most other viruses, A FLU-A(H1N1)pdm09 and FLU-A (H3N2) less commonly resulted in sorethroat. Running nose was more common in enterovirus (EV) and RV cases and less common in ADV. FLU-B was more likely than a majority of the other viruses to cause dry cough while EV and ADV-E were less likely to cause dry cough. CoV-OC43 and hMPV were more likely to cause cough with phlegm than the most other viruses. Influenza viruses and adenoviruses were more likely to cause fever ≥38.0°C. In Figure 3 , we explored the associations (and dissociations) between different clinical symptoms and signs across all viruses. Some are expected, such as association of fever ≥37.8°C and fever ≥38.0°C and dissociation of dry cough and cough with phlegm. Fever ≥38.0°C was also associated with systematic complaints, such as chills, bodyache, headache and eye pain. Sorethroat was associated with an injected pharynx.
