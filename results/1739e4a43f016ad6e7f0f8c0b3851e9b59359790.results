Both PCR reactions show positive results, with a threshold cycle value of 21,6 for Avian Coronaviruses and 16,2 for IBV Middle-East GI-23 lineage, respectively. The isolate described here clusters in the Middle-East G-23 lineage and shows close relationship to the commercially available vaccine TAbic IBVAR206 (Phibro, Teaneck, NJ) and to recently published Polish IBV GI-23 isolates (Lisowska et al., 2017) (Figure 1 ). Comparing the nucleotide sequence of the German isolate, the polish isolates, and the vaccine strain show substitutions in 10 positions (Table 1) . On bp 174, 276, and 277, the German isolate show unique nucleotide substitutions, which could not be observed in the other sequences. The substitution on position 277 resulted in Figure 1 . Phylogenetic tree of the German isolate, a prototype sequences of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) GI-23 lineage, the TAbic IBVAR206 vaccine strain, and polish GI-23 strain sequences. A bovine coronavirus sequence serves as outgroup. The analysis is based on parts of the S1 protein, containing the HVR I and II (bp 112-590). an amino acid substitution on position 93 (HVR II) from alanine to threonine (Table 1) .
