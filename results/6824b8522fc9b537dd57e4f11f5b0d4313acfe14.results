47 cases of laboratory-confi rmed MERS-CoV disease reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013, were identifi ed. All individuals except two were Saudi Arabian citizens. Identifi ed cases of MERS-CoV included two clusters, one of three people in one family living in one villa, 12 which were reported in October and November, 2012, and a hospital outbreak in Al-Hasa 13 of 23 cases in April and May, 2013. Transfer of patients and readmissions resulted in cases and transmission in two health-care facilities. In the outbreak at Al-Hasa, 13 7·6 days. 13 Table 1 shows the distribution over time of MERS-CoV infections and deaths, from Saudi Arabia and other countries. Table 2 shows the distribution of cases by sex and age, and case-fatality rates. The male:female case ratio was 3·3:1. Of 47 patients, 28 (60%) died, and the case-fatality rate was similar between female and male patients (55% vs 61%; odds ratio 1·31, 95% CI 0·34-5·12; p=0·698). Case-fatality rates rose with increasing age, from 39% (seven of 18) in those younger than 50 years, to 48% (13 of 27) in the group aged under 60 years, and to 75% (15 of 20) in cases aged 60 years or older. Univariate analysis (by binary logistic regression) of age 60 years or older as a risk factor for mortality was not signifi cant (odds ratio 3·23, 95% CI 0·91-11·42; p=0·069). The most common symptoms at presentation (table 3) were fever, fever with chills or rigors, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia. Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Of 47 patients, 42 (89%) needed intensive care and 34 (72%) had mechanical ventilation. The median time to mechanical ventilation was 7 days (range 3-11) and median time to death was 14 days (range 5-36). Most patients received oseltamivir and broad-spectrum antibiotics, which covered community-acquired and atypical pneumonia. Five individuals were also empirically started on fl uconazole, two received steroids, fi ve were treated with ribavirin, one was given interferon alfa, and fi ve were infused with intravenous immuno globulin. 45 (96%) of 47 patients had underlying comorbid medical disorders and only two people were previously healthy (table 4) . Diabetes, chronic renal disease, chronic cardiac disease, and hypertension were the most frequent comorbid disorders. One patient was on long-term immunosuppressive treatment with steroids. The number of comorbidities in relation to mortality is shown in table 5. All 47 patients had MERS-CoV infection confi rmed by real-time RT-PCR testing, which was done by measuring cycle threshold (Ct) values for viral load. Ct data were available from 37 samples, and these ranged from 19·85 to more than 40, the limit of detection (appendix). The time between onset of ). 43 (91%) patients had normal neutrophil counts on admission, and monocyte counts were also normal. Concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate amino transferase were raised in 23 (49%), fi ve (11%), and seven (15%) patients, respectively. Other liver-function test values were within the normal range. None of the 47 blood cultures or respiratory-tract samples screened for bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens on admission was positive. No cases of co-infection with MERS-CoV were recorded. Microbiological investigations excluded bacterial pathogens associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Abnormalities on chest radiography were noted in all 47 cases. Imaging fi ndings ranged from minor to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities and included increased bronchovascular markings, airspace opacities, patchy infi ltrates, interstitial changes, patchy to confl uent air-space consolidation, nodular opacities, reticular opacities, reticulonodular shadowing, pleural eff usions, and total opacifi cation of lung segments and lobes (fi gure 1A-E). Chest CT was done in some cases if clinically indicated and at the request of the attending doctor (fi gure 1F).
