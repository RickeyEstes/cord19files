High-throughput screening (HTS) Ten drugs compounds, namely mycophenolic acid, flufenamic acid, tolfenamic acid, meclofenamate sodium, mefenamic acid, ribavirin, mercaptopurine, pyrimethamine, emetine, and estradiol were identified as primary hits with protective results in chemical library screening against influenza A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) virus (Table 1) . Neuraminidase inhibitors were not identified because they were not included in the chemical library. Amantadine was not identified because the virus strain had an M2 gene mutation (S31N) conferring drug resistance. Using both EC 50 and TC 50 as the hit selection criteria, only mycophenolic acid exhibited a low EC 50 of <10 mM with a high selectivity index of >100. Mercaptopurine, which is a competitive, selective, and reversible inhibitor of the SARS-CoV papain-like protease, 33
