Nearly half of all hospitalizations (47%; 627/1347) were transfers in: 28 (5%) from other wards at our institution; 121 (19%) from primary care facilities; 453 (72%) from secondary/ district hospitals, and 25 (4%) from tertiary or private hospitals. Most were to the medical disciplines (981; 73%) with fewer surgical (paediatric surgery, orthopaedics and urology) admissions (366; 27%). Among medical hospitalizations (N ¼ 981), community-acquired infections predominated: RTI (379, 39%); other infectious diseases including tuberculosis (252; 25%) and acute gastroenteritis (96; 10%). HCAI events occurred more frequently in the medical disciplines (P < 0.009), with history of recent hospitalization (P < 0.001) and with use of any indwelling device, e.g. intravascular and urinary catheters (P < 0.001). Repeat hospitalization (re-admission within 30 days of discharge) was more likely following an initial stay complicated by HCAI [21% (63/301) vs 8% (81/1010); P < 0.001]. Of 417 HCAI events, 294 (71%) were hospital-acquired and 123 (29%) were healthcare-associated. Most transfers in with HCAI (following deterioration at referring hospital) had hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (63/123; 51%), 'presumed' hospital-acquired (HA) sepsis (22/123; 18%) or SSI events (11/ 123; 9%). Forty percent of HCAI-affected admission episodes had more than one HCAI event (119 had two events, 28 had three events, and 21 had four events). The most frequent HCAI event types overall (355/417; 85%) were: HAP (185; 44%), 'presumed' HA sepsis (63; 15%), UTI (45; 11%), LCBSI (41; 10%), and SSI (21; 5%) (Table II) . Excluding patients transferred in with HCAI (N ¼ 123) or with HCAI onset <48 h after transfer in (N ¼ 20), median (IQR) interval between admission and HCAI onset was: for HAP 8 (4e16), LCBSI 10 (7e16), 'presumed' HA sepsis 5 (3.5e11), UTI 6.5 (3e18), SSI 13 (5e23), CLABSI 10 (8e12), and VAP 5 (4e9) days. Although there were relatively few device-associated infections in the PICU, infection density rates were high: VAP (15.9 per 1000 ventilator-days), CLABSI (12.9 per 1000 central line-days), and CAUTI (16 per 1000 catheter-days) (Table III) . Mean device use ratios and total device days in the PICU were: 0.14 (233 days) for central lines, 0.5 (819 days) for endotracheal tubes, and 0.39 (625 days) for urinary catheters. The average device-days per PICU patient were 0.9, 3.3, and 2.5 and mean dwell times were 10.1, 10, and 11.3 days per patient for central lines, endotracheal tubes and urinary catheters respectively. All 12 children receiving total parenteral nutrition developed HCAI events including: three CLABSI, four LCBSI, three 'presumed' HA sepsis and two SSI events. SSI was the fifth most prevalent HCAI type, although nearly half were transfers in. The demographic profile of patients (N ¼ 329) who underwent recent or current surgery differed markedly from non-surgical admissions. Patients were older (mean age 25 vs 11 months; P < 0.001), less likely to be HIVinfected [8/329 (3%) vs 117/1018 (12%); P < 0.001] and less likely to have underlying comorbidities (97/329 (29%) vs 387/ 1018 (38%); P ¼ 0.005). Of the 327 current surgeries, 67 (20%) were emergency procedures, 25 (8%) had American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score >2, 54 (17%) were classified as contaminated/dirty, and 107 (33%) procedures lasted >60 min. No potential risk factors for SSI were significant on univariate analysis: wound class (P ¼ 0.71); ASA score (P ¼ 0.19); emergency vs elective procedure (P ¼ 0.78), and operation duration (P ¼ 0.35). Notably patients in surgical disciplines had fewer HCAI events overall [70/366 (19%) vs 255/981 (26%); P ¼ 0.009] and no fatal outcomes. Table IV describes the management and impact of the 417 HCAI events. Some patients experienced severe morbidity requiring ICU admission with/without respiratory support, inotropes, and additional surgical procedures as a direct consequence of the HCAI event. Ninety-five percent of HCAI events prompted a new antimicrobial prescription (2365 additional days of therapy) (Table V) at a cost of US$14,370. HCAIaffected hospitalization episodes produced significantly more laboratory investigation requests (mean of 16 vs 5 tests per admission; P < 0.001), totalling an additional 3575 laboratory investigations (Table VI) . After excluding outcomes of death or transfer (Table VII) , 1058 hospitalizations remained (five HCAI types with !20 events). When compared to age-and wardmatched 'controls' (three per HCAI event), HAP, LCBSI, and 'presumed' HA sepsis events significantly prolonged median (IQR) hospital stay: HAP [11 (7e24) vs 9 (6e20) days; P ¼ 0.03]; LCBSI [20 (11e32) vs 11 (7e23) days; P ¼ 0.02] and 'presumed' Of hospitalizations complicated by HCAI, 24/325 (7.4%) resulted in death vs 12/1022 (1.2%) HCAI-unaffected episodes (P < 0.001). Deaths associated with HCAI occurred at a median of 4 days (IQR: 2e6.8) from onset of infection. Crude mortality by HCAI event type was highest for LCBSI (9/41; 22%), followed by VAP (2/13; 15%), HAP (10/185; 5%), and 'presumed' HA sepsis (3/63; 5%). Proportionally, HAP contributed the most HCAI-associated deaths (42%) followed by LCBSI (38%), 'presumed' HA sepsis (13%), and VAP (7%). Of 10 children whose death was HAP-associated, five isolated one or more respiratory pathogens including: adenovirus (five); respiratory syncytial virus (three), influenza (one), bocavirus (one), and five had no pathogen identified. Gram-negatives and fungal pathogens predominated from fatal LCBSI events including: K. pneumoniae (three); Enterobacter cloacae (one); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (one); A. baumannii (one), C. albicans (two), C. parapsilosis (one) and Enterococcus faecalis (one). By contrast, only one out of 12 children who died during HCAIunaffected hospitalizations had a pathogen isolated (Streptococcus pneumoniae). Risk factors for HCAI-associated death with P < 0.1 on univariate analysis were entered into a multivariate model including: age category, ward type, discipline, blood transfusion, isolation room stay, and McCabe score. Discipline and McCabe score were subsequently removed from the model owing to collinearity; factors independently associated with death from HCAI were PICU admission (OR: 7.6; IQR: 3.3e17.6; P < 0.001), blood transfusion (8.1; 3.9e16.6; P < 0.001) and stay in an isolation room (7.6; 2.9e19.6; P < 0.001).
