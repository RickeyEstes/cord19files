Departure flight times scheduling can be constrained by demandside consideration, which will affect carriers' strategic scheduling. Even if an airline carrier changes its fare, demand may not respond when either a capacity limit has already been reached or demand is high relative to others. To capture this effect, we estimate the model for all months excluding August (based on the average load factor, August seems to face a capacity constraint problem), when demand is high relative to the seats offered. Results do not qualitatively change. The current model is robust to the capacity problem. To provide an econometric analysis in Section 5, model specifications that differ in the set of two explanatory variables are compared: COMP1, LCCsh1 in eq (1) and COMP2, LCCsh2 in eq (2). For each set of the two explanatory variables, all tables below present the estimated coefficients using the IV method as well as the OLS method. A test for weak identification e which means that the instruments are correlated with endogenous regressors, but not highly correlated e is performed using STATA 11 and interpreted.
