Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected in 58.3% (120/206) of SARI/ARDS cases (61.7% males; 13.3% aged ≤ 5 years, 67.5% aged 6-64 years). Moreover, the presence of another condition possibly increasing the risk for developing influenza-related complications [3, 4] Forty-six (46/206: 22.3%) SARI/ARDS cases (including two fatalities) resulted negative to all diagnostic assays (58.2% males; 18.2% aged ≤ 5 years, 45.4% aged 6-64 years) and were further investigated by VIDISCA-454 [5, 11] . VIDISCA-454 revealed no sequence reads that could belong to a novel virus or viral variant in any of the 46 specimens; however it enabled the identification of one case of undiagnosed measles, thus increasing the proportion of cases with a diagnosis to 78.2% (161/206). Hence, the overall proportion of cases with unknown diagnosis was 21.8% (45/206); most (34/45: 75.6%) cases that could not be diagnosed were ARDS and two (2/45: 4.4%) were fatal.
