Between 2014 and 2015, a total of 60 patients with asthma exacerbations were recruited in this study. The mean age of the patients was 7 years. The majority of the patients were male (71.7% male vs. 28.3% female) ( Table I) . Of the 60 samples collected from the patients with acute asthma exacerbations, rhinovirus was detected in 12 patients (20%), RSV in 5 (8%), adenovirus in 5 (8%), and influenza virus in 1 (1.6%). Figure 1 demonstrates the frequency of detected viruses during asthma exacerbations. All the samples that are investigated showed single viral infection. A total of 37 (61%) samples did not have any respiratory pathogens. The patients were also evaluated in three distinct groups according to their age. Three (5%) of the patients studied were under 1 year of age, 20 (33.3%) were between 1 and 5 years of age, and 37 (61.7%) were older than 5 years of age. The majority of the patients with documented viral infections in this study were between 1 and 5 years of age. Rhinovirus was the most common vial agent detected in all three age groups followed by both RSV and adenovirus. In children between 1 and 5 years of age, RSV (five patients) followed by rhinovirus (four patients) were the most common respiratory pathogens detected. Thirty-one patients had multiple (more than one) admissions. All of them except one were associated with rhinovirus detection. The only one reported was due to RSV. RSV had been detected more significantly in patients with severe attack than those with moderate exacerbations of the disease. Figure 2 demonstrates the relationship between asthma severity and viral infections. The patients were also evaluated for any relationship between specific symptoms with the viral agents. There were no significant differences when evaluating symptoms with a specific viral agent. Viral infections detected in the patients were compared according to their frequencies and also the clinical manifestations and complications.
