3.1. The replication of icPC22A was eventually enhanced during coinfection with icPC22A-S1Δ197 in neonatal Gn piglets As shown in Fig. 1 , all PEDV-inoculated pigs but no pigs in the mock group had diarrhea and shed PEDV. The fecal consistency scores and peak fecal PEDV N and S RNA shedding titers of piglets in the coinfection group reached the peak at 1.5 dpi, which was delayed half a day compared with the icPC22A group (1 dpi) but earlier than the icPC22A-S1Δ197 group (> 4 dpi). By 4 dpi, all pigs in the icPC22A and coinfection groups but no pigs in the icPC22A-S1Δ197 group died or showed moribund. Compared with the peak fecal PEDV N gene shedding titer (11.6 ± 0.2 log 10 copies/mL) of piglets in the icPC22A group (1 dpi), pigs in the coinfection group had a significantly higher peak titer (13.6 ± 0.7 log 10 copies/mL) ( Fig. 1B and Table 2 ) at a delayed time point (1.5 dpi). In addition, the peak fecal infectious PEDV shedding titer of the coinfection group (5.8 ± 0.4 log 10 TCID 50 /mL) were significantly higher than that of the single infection groups (4.9 ± 0.1 and 1.8 ± 1.8 log 10 TCID 50 /mL of icPC22 A and icPC22 A-S1Δ197 groups, respectively) ( Table 2) . Interestingly, the peak S gene shedding titers of icPC22 A (11.4 ± 0.5 log 10 copies/mL) in the coinfection group at 1.5 dpi was significantly higher than that of icPC22 A group (10.5 ± 0.5 log 10 copies/mL) at 1 dpi (Fig. 1C, Table 2 ). However, the peak S gene shedding titers (5.8 ± 1.2 log 10 copies/mL) of icPC22 A-S1Δ197 in the coinfection group was significantly lower than that of the icPC22 A-S1Δ197 group (7.6 ± 1.7 log 10 copies/mL) (Fig. 1C , Table 2 ). In the second passage of coinfection, only icPC22 A but not icPC22 A-S1Δ197 S gene was detected in the large intestinal contents (LIC) of the piglet, which was orally inoculated with the SIC (sample #PE1158) of one pig in the coinfection group and was positive for both viruses. The LIC had a virus titer of 8.8 log 10 TCID 50 /mL for infectious PEDV, 12.3 log 10 S gene copies/mL and 14.6 log 10 N gene copies/mL for icPC22A. Histopathological examination was performed and villous atrophy was observed in the jejunum and ileum of piglets in all PEDV-inoculated groups ( Fig. 2A and B ). The small intestinal villi in the icPC22A-S1Δ197 group had a milder villous atrophy than those in the icPC22A and coinfection groups. The VH/CD ratios of jejunum and ileum of all the PEDV-inoculated groups were significantly lower than those of the mock group (Fig. 2B) . The ratios of the icPC22 A and coinfection groups were similar and were significantly lower than that of the icPC22 A-S1Δ197 group. IHC staining showed that no PEDV-positive intestinal epithelial cells were observed in all PEDV-inoculated pigs Fig. 1 . Evaluation of the replication of icPC22A and icPC22A-S1Δ197 in Gn pigs infected with individual or both viruses. (A) Fecal consistency scores of individual Gn piglets and the mean of each group were shown. The scores were named as follows: 0, solid (normal); 1, pasty (normal); 2, semiliquid (mild diarrhea); and 3, liquid (severe diarrhea). Two piglets from icPC22A, icPC22A-S1Δ197 and coinfection groups, and one pig from mock group were euthanized at 12 hpi and 2-3 dpi, respectively, for histopathological examination. (B) Fecal PEDV N gene RNA shedding titers (for both icPC22A and icPC22A-S1Δ197) of each group. Data are shown as mean (M) ± standard deviations (SD) of pigs in each group. (C) Fecal PEDV S gene RNA shedding titles of each virus. Data are shown as M ± SD. at 0.5 dpi (data not shown). At 2-3 dpi, a few PEDV N antigens were observed in the small intestine of the icPC22A-S1Δ197-infected piglets, while extensive antigens were stained in those of the icPC22A and coinfection piglets ( Fig. 2A) . By IF staining for the PEDV S1 proteins, a few PEDV antigens were observed in the jejunum of the icPC22A-S1Δ197-inoculated piglets (green alone, positive for S1Δ197 only), while many antigens were observed in those of the icPC22 A-inoculated piglets [yellow, representing positive for both S1Δ197 (green) and S1°d omain (red)] and the coinfection piglets (yellow) (Fig. 2C) . 3.2. icPC22A alone, but not icPC22A-S1Δ197 alone was isolated from the SIC of one of the pigs infected with the two viruses simultaneously The SIC of the one piglet in the coinfection group, which was positive for both viruses by the duplex RT-qPCR were used for virus isolation in Vero cells using plague assays. We picked up 72 plagues and found that 55 plagues were positive for icPC22A and 17 plagues were positive for both viruses by the duplex RT-qPCR. No plagues were positive for S1 NTD-del PEDV alone.
