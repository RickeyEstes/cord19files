In order to identify novel inhibitors of CBS, we screened 8866 clinically used drugs and well-annotated pharmacological compounds, a composite collection of 11 commercially available libraries and a small custom library assembled from known PLP-dependent enzyme inhibitor compounds consisting of the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor dl-difluoromethylornithine; the thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase inhibitor pemetrexed, the GABA transaminase inhibitor vigabatrin, the GABA transaminase and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor 3hydroxybenzylhydrazine and the DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa (Table 1 ). All compounds were screened at a concentration of 30 M. Compounds that showed >50% CBS inhibition at 30 M were considered potential hits. The number of potential hits varied between libraries. Some diversity collections (like LOPAC) yielded up to a dozen potential hits, some more specific collections (e.g. the ActiTarg P library or the PLP-dependent custom collection) didn't yield any potential hits. When a compound was represented in multiple libraries, it was positively identified as a potential hit compound multiple times, indicating the reliability of the screening assay. Individual CBS activities of all compounds tested (% of vehicle control), organized by libraries, are shown in Fig. 1 . The PLP-dependent enzyme inhibitor compounds were also re-tested in a broader concentration-response range (10-100 M); no inhibitory effects were observed for any of them, except with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine, which inhibited CBS activity by 24, 37, and 68%, at 10, 30, and 100 M, respectively. Carbidopa was a weak inhibitor of CBS activity (6% inhibition at 100 M). Confirmatory assays were performed on compounds that were repurchased from commercial sources. The 30 most potent inhibitors of CBS-stimulated AzMC fluorescence signal are shown in Table 2 . Taking into account the fact that some of the compounds contain electrophilic moieties, which could directly react with H 2 S, as well as some of them can quench coumarin fluorescence, potential hit compounds were counterscreened with the H 2 S donor GYY4137 in identical reaction conditions. The majority of the potential hit compounds decreased GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence ( Table 2) . The compounds that could be confirmed as CBS inhibitors with potency comparable to AOAA (and without significantly interfering with GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence) are hexachlorophene, tannic acid, aurintricarboxylic acid, and benserazide. These four compounds were further characterized, along with the principal reference compound AOAA [20] and the secondary reference compound, NSC67078 [27] . Inhibitory effect of the two Table 3 ; full concentration-response curves shown in Fig. 2 . The structures of the six compounds (two reference compounds and four compounds identified by the screen as bona fide CBS inhibitors) are shown in Fig. 3 . The CBS inhibitory effect of hexachlorophene, tannic acid, aurintricarboxylic acid, and benserazide were also confirmed using the methylene blue assay, which detects H 2 S production by a different principle than the AzMC assay (Table 3) . Unexpectedly, the second reference compound CBS inhibitor NSC67078, in addition to inhibiting CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence with an IC 50 of ∼1 M, also inhibited GYY6137induced AzMC fluorescence with an IC 50 of ∼6 M (Table 3 , Fig. 2B) indicating that the observed inhibitory effects are due to a combination of direct CBS inhibition as well as H 2 S scavenging and/or interference with the assay used to detect H 2 S. While conducting confirmatory dose-response work with the four compounds identified as CBS inhibitors, we have noted the aqueous instability of benserazide: while freshly made solutions produced the inhibition depicted above, storage of benserazide stock solutions in aqueous media or DMSO diminished its activity. For instance, while freshly dissolved benserazide at 100 M inhibited CBS activity by 66 ± 1%, after preparing stock solutions in PBS or DMSO and storing them at −20 • C for 1 week, its potency decreased to 45 ± 4% or 53 ± 3% inhibition of CBS activity, respectively, at 100 M (n = 3); these data are Table 2 List of potential hit compounds identified by the primary screening, and effect of the same compounds on GYY4137-induced fluorescence responses. Compounds were screened at 30 M (except for compounds indicated by asterisk, where testing was conducted at the indicated concentration) against CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence and re-tested at 30 M (except for compounds indicated by asterisk, where testing was conducted at the indicated concentration) against CBS-and GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence. Data are shown as mean ± SEM, n = 3. consistent with prior findings showing the oxidation-prone character of benserazide [35, 36] . Hexachlorophene, tannic acid, aurintricarboxylic acid and benserazide, as well as the two reference compounds AOAA (Fig. 4) and NSC67078 (Fig. 5) were next tested on cell proliferation in the HCT116 human colon carcinoma cell line. Cytotoxicity was assessed, in parallel, by the LDH release assay and the MTT assay. AOAA and NSC67078 concentration-dependently inhibited cell proliferation, with IC 50 values of 300 M and 0.3 M, respectively (Figs. 4 and 5) . The effect of NSC67078 was also associated with a suppression of MTT conversion (Fig. 5) . From the four compounds identified by the CBS screen, hexachlorophene (the least potent CBS inhibitor among the four identified hit compounds), did not affect HCT116 proliferation up to 3 M, but fully inhibited cell proliferation at 10 M (Fig. 6) . However, at this concentration, the compound also exerted cytotoxic effects, as indicated by the increase in LDH release (Fig. 6C) . The polyphenol tannic acid concentration-dependently inhibited proliferation, starting with 10 M; complete inhibition was seen at 100 M, without signs of cytotoxicity (Fig. 7) . Aurintricarboxylic acid, although it exhibited in vitro CBS inhibitory potency comparable to AOAA, did not inhibit cell proliferation at 10-100 M, while at 300 M increased cell proliferation (Fig. 8) . Although benserazide was less potent at inhibiting recombinant CBS than AOAA in the cell-free assay, it was more potent than AOAA in the proliferation assay. Benserazide inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 cells with a steep dose-response curve. Concentrations up to 10 M exerted no inhibitory effects, whereas at 30 M, benserazide completely inhibited HCT116 proliferation. and increased LDH release (Fig. 9) . Among the most potent potential hit compounds identified ( Table 2) , several of them contained copper, for instance ST012942 and the chlorophyllide Cu 2+ complex Na salt (contained in the "killer plates" library and the natural product library, respectively). However, ST012861 (a copper-free analogue of ST012942), failed to inhibit recombinant CBS activity (Fig. 10A) , suggesting that copper itself may be the inhibitor of CBS activity. In addition to inhibiting CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence, ST012942 also inhibited GYY4137-induced AzMC responses, although with a lower potency (IC 50 : 0.1 M vs. 1 M) (Fig. 10B) . In a follow-up assay we Table 4 Effect of three copper compounds on CBS-and GYY4137-induced H2S/AzMC fluorescence responses. Data are shown as mean ± SEM of n = 3 separate determinations.
