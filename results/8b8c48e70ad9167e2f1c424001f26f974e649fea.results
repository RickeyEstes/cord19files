To evaluate regional anti-BCV immune responses in the intestines of neonatal calves, quantitative (SRID) and qualitative (IFA and ELISA) approaches were used. On the basis of SRID test, IgM was found to be the most predominant immunoglobulin followed by IgG1, IgA and IgG2 ( Table 1 ). The levels of IgG2 were below detection limits of SRID in all but virulent virus-infected calves. Total anti-BCV activity of intestinal secretions was determined by IFA. All calves were negative at 2 days of age (before virus inoculation) except for calf 3 (naturally infected calf) which had a low titer of 1 : 5. Calves 1 and 9, following inoculation with attenuated virus, had peak titers of only 1:20-1:40. In calf 1, antibody activity could be detected only in the spiral colon (Fig. 1) whereas calf 9 had detectable antibody activity in all three regions of the gut. The IFA titers were much higher in calves inoculated with the virulent virus; peak titers in calves 2 and 6 being 5120 and 20,480, respectively. However, calf 7 , which was also inoculated with the virulent virus, had no detectable antibody activity (< 1:10) by IFA in any region of the intestine. Uninfected calves were always negative at 1:10 by IFA. Calf 3 that developed a natural BCV infection also did not produce high IFA titers.
