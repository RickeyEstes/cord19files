A total of 163 respiratory pathogens were identified in 94 children. The majority of children (73.5%) were ill for less than 4 days at the time of sampling. The median age at primary infection was 104 days (range 33-269) and the median score of symptoms was 3, indicating a mild illness (Table 1 ). In all children with an illness of 5 days or longer, one or more pathogens were detected.
