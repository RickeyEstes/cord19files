Our initial experiments were carried out to confirm cell-surface expression of MHC class II on isolated NECs from healthy control subjects (Fig E1, A, left panel) and patients with birch pollen-induced AR sampled before the start of the season (Fig E1, B, left panel) . The HLA-DR expression on isolated HNECs was verified by means of immunofluorescence staining (Fig E1, C) . ECs must express costimulatory molecules, such as CD86 or CD80, to act as APCs. Isolated HNECs from healthy control subjects (Fig E1, A, right panel) and patients with AR (Fig E1, B , right panel) displayed cell-surface expression of the costimulatory molecule CD86. No expression of CD80 was found (data not shown). There were no significant differences in the fraction of HLA-DR or CD86 between healthy control subjects and patients with AR before the season (data not shown). There was no significant difference in the fraction of HLA-DR or CD86 expression between HNECs derived from nasal biopsy specimens or HNECs obtained from nasal brushing, validating the nasal brush method for use in our forthcoming experiments (Fig E1, D) . In mice we found a marked H2-IA b expression on MNECs, as well as cell-surface expression of the costimulatory molecules CD86 and CD80 (Fig E2, A) . To mimic allergic patients, we sensitized C57BL/6 mice with OVA in conjunction with aluminum hydroxide. NECs from OVA-sensitized mice expressed marked levels of H2-IA b (Fig E2, B, left panel) . Expression levels of CD86 were similar to those in naive mice (Fig E2, B, middle panel) , whereas we found increased expression levels of the costimulatory molecule CD80 in OVA-sensitized mice (Fig E2, B, right panel) . The fraction of MNECs expressing H2-IA b and CD80 was significantly increased on OVA-sensitized epithelium (based on 28 animals) compared with that on naive epithelium (based on 25 animals), whereas no difference was seen in CD86 expression (Fig E2, C) . Notably, sensitized MNECs exhibited significantly increased activating capacity demonstrated by the increased number and fraction of CD69 expression on OT-II T cells seen even without OVA stimulation compared with that seen on naive MNECs without OVA stimulation (P < .001 for both number and fraction of CD69; Figs 1, C, and E3, A). Splenic CD4 1 T cells from naive mice were added to stimulated naive and sensitized MNECs in all experiments to rule out nonspecific T-cell activation. No signs of T-cell proliferation were seen in these experiments (data not shown), demonstrating the necessity of antigen presentation and engagement of antigen-specific T cells. A neutralizing anti-MCH class II antibody (anti-mouse A-I/E-I) was added to the cocultures to test whether the activation was class II dependent, resulting in no increase of CD69 1 /CD4 1 T-cell counts after 4 hours. When adding an isotype antibody instead, the increase in cell counts persisted. This indicated that activation of T cells was class II dependent. Control experiments were carried out for both the mouse and human coculture experiments in which samples were kept on ice. These experiments revealed no T-cell proliferation or activation (data not shown), supporting the hypothesis that the enhanced T-cell activation is dependent on epithelial antigen processing and presentation. T cells from Bet v 1-sensitized patients harvested in the season demonstrated increased cell-surface expression of CD69, even without the addition of Bet v 1 allergen (Figs 2, D, and E4, A), suggesting that sensitization might activate the ECs and augment their antigen-presenting capacities by, for example, increasing expression of HLA-DR and costimulatory molecules. In the supernatants of the human cocultures, no increase in IL-13 levels was seen on 24 hours of coculture in either of the groups (data not shown). No increase in IL-5 levels was detected in either of the groups on 4, 24, or 48 hours of coculture (data not shown). The frequencies of different cell types in nasal mucosa and the magnitude of HLA-DR were analyzed in the final experiments. These experiments revealed a high number of HLA-DR-expressing NECs (total NECs, 67.313 6 1.566 ; Fig 2, F) . (Fig E1, A) and a patient with AR (Fig E1, B; representative data from 9 different experiments, respectively). The isotype control is a filled histogram. C, HNECs stained for MHC class II (green).
