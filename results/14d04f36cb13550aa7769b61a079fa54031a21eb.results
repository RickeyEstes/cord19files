In total 2081 state residents aged 16 and over completed the module on pandemic infl uenza. The overall response rate was 65%. The key demographics of the weighted survey were comparable to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2006 Australian population census data. 22 Overall 73% of the population indicated that they would be very or extremely willing to receive vaccination, 67% would be very/extremely willing to isolate from others if needed, 58% would be very/extremely willing to wear a face mask, and 48% would be very/extremely willing to do all three. Less than 8% of the population reported being 'not at all' willing to wear a face mask, and considerably lower proportions of the population were 'not at all' willing to comply with vaccination (3%) and isolation (5%). Tables 1A-D present results of the survey logistic regression modeling, showing the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the associations between the three health protective behavior questions and the composite (All) indicator. The infl uence of age on willingness to comply with protective behaviors was found to be a key variable, and this effect is illustrated in Figure 1 .
