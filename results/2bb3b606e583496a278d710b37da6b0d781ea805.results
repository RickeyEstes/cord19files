The numbers of cases of the 28 class B notifiable diseases during the years 2005-2014 are shown in Table 1 . During the 10-year period, 38 982 567 cases and 126 372 deaths were reported in the system. Tuberculosis, HBV, syphilis, dysentery, and HCV were the top 5 ranking diseases in terms of the number of cases. The numbers of deaths caused by the 28 class B notifiable diseases for the years 2005-2014 are shown in Table 2 . AIDS, tuberculosis, rabies, HBV, Japanese encephalitis, haemorrhagic fever, and neonatal tetanus were the top 7 ranking diseases in terms of the number of deaths; these diseases each caused more than 1000 deaths during the 10 years. With regard to the numbers of cases, tuberculosis represented the highest proportion among the 28 class B notifiable diseases With regard to the numbers of deaths, the disease proportions changed dramatically over the 10 years ( Figure 3 ). In 2005, tuberculosis caused the highest proportion of deaths among the 2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  Total   AIDS  968  942  1200  4158  4486  9531  10 726  12 483  11 718  12 317  68 529  Tuberculosis  2618  2475  2073  2368  3075  1742  1930  1935  1887  1772  21 875  Rabies  2191  2692  2873  2350  2103  1986  1902  1372  1082  873  19 424  Hepatitis B virus  849  841  838  930  830  723  686  638  593  398  7326  Japanese encephalitis  160  387  165  135  171  95  73  67  77  36  1366  Hepatitis C virus  102  151  123  131  155  142  137  110  163  134  1348  Haemorrhagic fever  227  145  129  107  107  120  127  99  119  85  1265  Neonatal tetanus  231  187  160  195  130  95  59  57  49  14  1177  Syphilis  81  89  74  91  76  86  102  102  82  87  870  Cerebrospinal meningitis  172  138  104  117  90  34  25  24  22  15  741  Dysentery  131  112  68  57  37  42  28  17  14  5  511  Other hepatitis  103  88  75  59  41  32  18  23  19  13  471  Measles  47  31  64  111  40  27  12  7  28  27  394  Hepatitis E virus  44  40  39  31  24  34  41  23  20  15  311  Malaria  40  30  14  20  10  16  32  14  22  23  221  Hepatitis A virus  36  33  23  13  22  6  14  9  4  8  168  Leptospirosis  41  17  31  17  11  12  5  5  7  8  154  Typhoid  13  18  7  7  10  3  2  6  5  1  72  Anthrax  11  12  1  1  3  6  3  1  1  3  42  Avian influenza  5  8  2  4  4  1  1  1  2  0  28  Gonorrhoea  1  5  0  3  3  1  3  1  1  3  21  Schistosomiasis  2  3  1  0  2  0  2  5  1  0  16  Brucellosis  5  0  0  1  1  1  0  2  2  2  14  Pertussis  1  4  0  0  1  1  2  1  0  2 Table 3 and Figure 4 . The standard deviation and range are given in Table 3 . There were six diseases for which the seasonal index range was greater than 2: dengue fever (high in September and October, and low in all of the other months), Japanese encephalitis (high from July to September, and low in the other months), leptospirosis (high in September and low from January to June), anthrax (high in August and low from December to April), cerebrospinal meningitis (high from February to April, and low from June to November), and measles (high from March to June, and low from August to December). The seasonal indices for malaria (high from July to September, and low from December to April), dysentery (high from June to September, and low from January to March), haemorrhagic fever (high in November and December, and low in August and September), scarlet fever (high in May and June, and low in February), and brucellosis (high from May to July, and low in January) were between 1 and 2. The variations in hepatitis disease, tuberculosis, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (including gonorrhoea, syphilis, and AIDS) were relatively lower than those of the other diseases. From the coefficient of regression (Table 4) , we can derive how much the incidence changes on average by month after removing the effect of seasonality. The incidence of syphilis increased fastest among the 28 diseases. The syphilis incidence rate increased on average by 0.018626/100 000 every month after adjustment for seasonality. Seven other diseases had an increasing incidence, including HCV (0.010042/100 000), AIDS (0.002891/100 000), brucellosis (0.002242/100 000), scarlet fever (0.001311/100 000), dengue fever (0.000959/100 000), HEV (0.000801/100 000), and schistosomiasis (0.000136/100 000). The incidences of 18 diseases decreased, among which tuberculosis (À0.019143/100 000), dysentery (À0.015704/100 000), and HBV (À0.009740/100 000) dropped fastest.
