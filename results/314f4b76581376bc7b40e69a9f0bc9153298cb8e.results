REDCap would have improved data management capabilities for all four types of outbreaks. For the MERS CoV and rash outbreaks, REDCap would have assisted with the management of large-scale outbreaks with hundreds of contacts and multi-jurisdiction response. For all four types of outbreaks, REDCap would have facilitated self-reporting of symptoms and exposures through the design and administration of online surveys to cases and contacts. REDCap's document upload functionality would have facilitated storage and access of lab reports for foodborne illness, MERS CoV, and NDM outbreaks. REDCap also would allow public health responders to perform long-term monitoring of symptoms and disease incidence in NDM outbreaks.
