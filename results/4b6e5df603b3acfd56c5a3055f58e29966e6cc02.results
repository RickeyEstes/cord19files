Nine patients infected with CRE organisms were identified. These patients had one or more cultures positive for a CRE isolate during their hospital course, contributing to a total of eleven positive cultures from various sites without counting duplicates of isolates obtained from the same site. Isolates from these patients included five Klebseilla pneumoniae, three E. coli, and one Enterobacter aerogenes. Five isolates were obtained from blood cultures, three from wound cultures, one from urine cultures, one from respiratory cultures and one from an abscess collection. Of the nine isolates of CRE identified, three K. pneumonia were confirmed by molecular analysis as blaNDM-1 and one K. pneumonia isolated from blood was identified as blaOXA-48. Molecular analysis was not available for five isolates. Table 1 summarizes the key comorbid conditions, isolates, treatment, and outcomes. The full susceptibility profile, as determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) E test method is shown in Table 2 . Comorbid conditions, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, chronic kidney disease, catheter placement, surgical procedures, and prior hospitalization within 90 days were identified among our patients. Five patients had diabetes mellitus, three patients had renal insufficiency, two had a history of a malignancy, five had ischemic heart disease/hypertension or rheumatic heart disease, and one had renal transplant. Six patients had either prior ICU admission or spent time in the intensive care during their hospitalization course. The other Table   1 Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of the nine CRE infected patients. Case no. five patients died due to severe sepsis, septic shock and multiorgan failure. Six patients had been hospitalized within 90 days or transferred from other hospitals prior to their current admission and received antibiotics previously. Four patients had surgical procedure within 90 days of the onset of infection. Infectious diseases physicians were consulted for treatment recommendations in all nine cases presented in this series. Except for one isolate which was colistin resistant (8 g/ml), the CRE isolates identified in these nine patients were susceptible to colistin but showed variable susceptibilities to aminoglycosides (MIC range, 0.5 to >256 g/ml) and fluoroquinolones (MIC range, 0.25 to >32 g/ml). All the carbapenemase producers were highly resistant to the third and fourth generation cephalosporin, including piperacillin-tazobactam (MIC range, 8 to >256 g/ml). Tigecycline was the only antimicrobial agent active against all isolates (MICs, 0.12-2 g/ml). Prior treatment with carbapenems were documented in three patients. Four patients were given aminoglycosides, three were given colistin, and none were given fluoroquinolones. Six patients received combination treatment including carbapenem. Only two patients received tigecycline, one for septicemia and ventilator associated pneumonia caused by K. pneumonia (died) and the other for psoas abscess caused by E. coli (discharged). Interestingly, one patient had a history of surgery for hip fracture in India 3 months prior to his presentation and another patient was transferred from Egypt. Carbapenemase genes were detected in 4 of the 9 clinical isolates.
