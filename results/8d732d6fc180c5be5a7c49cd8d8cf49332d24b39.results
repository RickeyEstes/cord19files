Almost all ED presentations (n=1 607 825; 99.5%) between 2002 and 2012 successfully linked to the birth cohort dataset. The remaining records were excluded due to inconsistent date of birth information or being related to children who were not born in WA. Records missing a postcode at the time of birth were also excluded (n=1568) leaving 1 606 257 ED records pertaining to 337 201 children who presented to ED before age 17 years during the study period (figure 1). In the final categories, ICD codes identified 66.4% of ARI presentations, symptom codes identified a further 1.0%, text variables 5.4% and the major diagnostic category 27.2%. For analyses by geographical region, the cohort was restricted to Open access children presenting to ED in the first 5 years of life (n=1 034 924 records for 269 740 children).
