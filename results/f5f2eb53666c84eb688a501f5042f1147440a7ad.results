Successful generation of a versatile human SMN2-GFP reporter line in HEK293 cells for drug screening To establish a versatile SMN2-GFP reporter, we targeted the human SMN2 gene in situ using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homologous recombination (HR) (Wang et al, 2013a; Mali et al, 2013; Hou et al, 2014; Niu et al, 2014) in HEK293 cells. A gRNA that specifically targets the SMN2 gene was designed ( Fig 1A) . We then verified the targeting efficiency of this gRNA in HEK293 cells (Fig 1B) . Using this gRNA together with the donor plasmid and Cas9, we next transfected HEK293 cells through the calcium phosphate precipitation method. As shown in Fig 1C, gRNA/Cas9 induced double-strand break (DSB) and promoted HR-based DNA repair in the presence of the recombination donor. After HR, GFP was specifically integrated into the SMN2 gene to generate the SMN2-GFP reporter ( Fig 1C) . Please note that GFP with TAA stop codon is specifically integrated and replaced the stop codon within exon 8. During pre-mRNA splicing, open reading frame will include the GFP cassette if exon 7 is excluded. In contrast, the TAA stop codon in exon 7 will make the open reading frame lack GFP if exon 7 is included. If a compound could increase SMN-FL splicing efficiency of SMN2, the GFP signal will decrease. However, if a compound potentiates SMN2 transcription, Figure 1 .

Overlapped peaks represented NHEJ repair after gRNA/Cas9 induced DSB. (C) Schematic strategy for SMN2-GFP reporter line establishment and small molecule screening. gRNA/Cas9 induced DSB promotes HR-based DNA repair in the presence of recombination donor. GFP is specifically integrated into the exon 8 and replaces the stop codon of exon 8. Successful candidate small molecules can either brighten (by transcriptional enhancement or protein stabilization) or darken GFP fluorescence (by splicing pattern switch) in reporter cells, which will be counted as hits for further evaluation. the GFP signal will increase. Because SMN-Δ7 protein is unstable and degrades quickly, if the SMN protein stability is enhanced by a compound, the GFP signals will also increase. Therefore, the SMN2-GFP reporter we designed is versatile to find candidate drugs, which may regulate SMN2 transcription, splicing, or protein stability. Next, the transfected HEK293 cells were dissociated to single cells and cultured clonally. GFP-positive clones were then selected and expanded (Fig 2A) . We validated the integration of GFP in these clones which showed correct integration into the SMN2-exon 8 as indicated by Southern blot (Fig 2B) and genomic DNA PCR ( Fig 2C) . As expected, the expression of SMNΔ7-GFP fusion proteins were observed in the reporter lines ( Fig 2D) . Notably, this GFP integration is specific to the SMN2 gene as revealed by DNA sequencing (Fig 2E) and does not affect the normal splicing pattern of the human SMN2 gene ( Fig 2F) . Together, these data reveal the successful establishment of the versatile human SMN2-GFP reporter line in HEK293 cells. Drug screening using the SMN2-GFP reporter identifies a compound that significantly increases SMN protein levels To test the feasibility of using the human SMN2 gene reporter for drug screening, we used reported positive compounds for regulating SMN2 gene transcriptional activation (protirelin) (Kato et al, 2009; Ohuchi et al, 2016) , SMN protein stabilization (MG132 and bortezomib) Kwon et al, 2011) , and SMN2 gene splicing (RG7800) . The SMN2 reporter cells were treated with these compounds or vehicle for 2 d, and the fluorescence intensities were examined. As expected, protirelin, MG132, and bortezomib significantly increased GFP intensity. In contrast, RG7800, which can down-regulate the proportion of SMN-Δ7 splicing, significantly decreased GFP intensity in SMN2-GFP reporter cells (Fig S1) . The Z9-factor for this assay, an evaluation parameter of the quality of assays, is 0.68, suggesting that this reporter system is suitable for drug screening (Zhang et al, 1999) . We then examined a small pool library of 980 compounds. SMN2-GFP reporter cells were dissociated and plated onto 96-well plates (10,000 per well). 12 h after plating, each compound was added for 2 d. The fluorescence intensities from each well were then compared between compound-treated and vehicle (DMSO)-treated groups. This resulted in the identification of 14 hits, which brightened GFP fluorescence in the SMN2-GFP reporter line ( Fig 2G) . Candidate compounds were tested again to validate the repeatability, which showed great repeatability ( Fig 2H) . Interestingly, there were four candidate compounds belonging to protease inhibitors. Western blot analysis further confirmed that several compounds could (E) Sequencing of the DNA sequences flanking the GFP cassette confirmed SMN2 gene rather than SMN1 gene integration. (F) GFP integration in SMN2 exon 8 showed normal splicing patterns as more than 90% SMN-Δ7 were spliced. (G) A small pool library screening identified 14 hits which brightened GFP fluorescence in the SMN2-GFP reporter line. Represented pictures before and after compound #8 (Z-FA-FMK) treatment are shown. Scale bar, 50 μm. (H) Quantification data showing that 14 hits significantly increased GFP intensity in the SMN2-GFP reporter cell line by more than 0.5-fold. Data were presented as mean ± SEM, n = 3. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, as compared with DMSO group by two-tailed t test. significantly increase the protein expression of SMN in patientderived fibroblasts, among which compound #8 (Z-Phe-Ala fluoromethyl ketone, Z-FA-FMK), an irreversible inhibitor of cysteine proteases Van Noorden et al, 1988) , was most effective ( Fig S2) . Next, we examined the dose-dependent effect of Z-FA-FMK on the SMN expression using the reporter cell line. After treatment with different concentrations of Z-FA-FMK, the GFP fluorescence signals were brighter in cells that were treated with higher concentrations of Z-FA-FMK ( Fig 3A) . The expression of SMNΔ7-GFP fusion protein in these samples was also analyzed by Western blot, which confirmed a dose-dependent effect of Z-FA-FMK ( Fig  3B and C) . Interestingly, the mRNA expression of SMNΔ7-GFP was not significantly increased in Z-FA-FMK-treated groups compared with control group (Fig 3D) , suggesting that Z-FA-FMK, an inhibitor of cysteine proteases Van Noorden et al, 1988) , may affect SMN stability. To evaluate this compound in patients' samples, we examined the effect of Z-FA-FMK on the mRNA and protein expression of SMN in fibroblast cells of SMA patients (GM03813 and GM22592, which were initially diagnosed as type I and type II SMA, respectively). Similarly, as described in the Coriell Web site, these patient fibroblast cells possess the SMN2 gene but do not have the SMN1 gene using TaqMan qRT-PCR assay (Gomez-Curet et al, 2007) ( Fig  S3) . The protein expression levels of SMN in fibroblast cells derived from the SMA patient is much lower than those from the normal individual (WT) (Fig 3E) . After treatment with different concentrations of Z-FA-FMK (1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 μM) for 2 d, the expression levels of SMN proteins were increased by Z-FA-FMK in a dosedependent manner (Figs 3F and S4 ). Statistical analysis of biological triplicate samples indicated that Z-FA-FMK can significantly increase the expression of SMN proteins starting from 10 μM (Fig S4) . Similar results were obtained from a second SMA patient's fibroblast cells (Fig S5) , confirming that Z-FA-FMK can restore SMN protein levels in patients' cells. Notably, Z-FA-FMK could increase the SMN protein expression over onefold, which is comparable with a highly potent agent recently reported . Similarly, as seen in the reporter cells, Z-FA-FMK did not In SMA type I fibroblast cells, vehicle (DMSO) or Z-FA-FMK were applied for 2 d, followed by analysis of the protein (E, F) and mRNA (G) expression in these cells. n = 3. Data were presented as mean ± SEM, *P < 0.05, as compared with the DMSO-treated group by two-tailed t test. Inhibiting cysteine proteases for SMA Wang et al. https://doi.org/10.26508/lsa.201800268 vol 2 | no 2 | e201800268 significantly enhance the mRNA expression of SMN in patient fibroblast cells (Figs 3G and S5C) . Together, our data reveal the effectiveness of our SMN2-gene-based screening system and identify a small molecule, Z-FA-FMK, which has a novel role in increasing the protein levels of SMN. Role of Z-FA-FMK on the SMN expression in SMA patient iPSCs and iPSC-derived motor neurons To further validate the candidate compound, we performed the secondary analysis using SMA patient-specific iPSCs that were successfully generated from a type I SMA patient . We first examined the effect of Z-FA-FMK on the expression of SMN proteins in iPSCs ( Fig 4A) . SMA iPSCs were treated with Z-FA-FMK at different concentrations (1, 10, and 100 μM) for 48 h and subsequently harvested for Western blot analysis ( Fig 4B) . The protein expression of SMN was significantly increased after treatment with Z-FA-FMK at 10 and 100 μM, revealing a dose-dependent effect (Fig 4B and C) . Quantification analyses revealed that the protein level of SMN was significantly increased to~170% in Z-FA-FMK (10 μM)-treated SMA iPSCs as compared with the DMSO-treated control ( Fig 4C) . Given that spinal motor neurons specifically degenerate in SMA patients, we then examined the effect of Z-FA-FMK on the expression of SMN in SMA patient-derived spinal motor neurons. SMA iPSCs were differentiated into spinal motor neurons used a modified monolayer differentiation system in the presence of retinoic acid (for caudalization) and purmorphamine (for ventralization) (Fig 4A) . Similarly, as we previously described , iPSCs first differentiated into neuroepithelial cells (NE, 1-wk) with characteristic rosette structures ( Fig 4A) . These neural precursors then differentiated into spinal motor neuron progenitors (2-wk) and subsequent post-mitotic spinal motor neurons (3-wk) ( Fig 4A) . Z-FA-FMK was applied to cultures at 10 μM starting from the NE stage (day 7). In day-24 spinal motor neuron cultures, the expression of the functional SMN protein was dramatically increased in Z-FA-FMK-treated group compared with that in DMSO-treated SMA spinal motor neurons ( Fig 4D) . After further culture, SMA spinal motor neurons degenerated; similarly, as we reported before, there was a significant increase in the caspase 3/7 activity, revealing increased apoptosis caused by the deficiency of functional SMN in long-term cultures. Interestingly, after treatment with Z-FA-FMK, the increased caspase 3/7 activity was significantly ameliorated in SMA motor neuron cultures ( Fig 4E) . Together, these data suggest that the candidate compound, Z-FA-FMK, is effective in increasing the functional SMN and rescuing motor neuron degeneration in human iPSC-based model of SMA. Western blot analysis revealed an increased expression of SMN proteins after Z-FA-FMK treatment at day-24 motor neuron stage. (E) The activity of caspase 3/7 was significantly increased in motor neuron long-term cultures (6-wk) derived from SMA iPSCs, and this increase was significantly inhibited by the application of Z-FA-FMK. Mean ± SEM, n = 5. **P < 0.01 as compared with the WT group, ## P < 0.01 as compared with the SMA+ DMSO group by two-tailed t test. The dose-dependent effect of Z-FA-FMK (C) in SMA iPSCs was confirmed using linear regression (P = 0.0008).
