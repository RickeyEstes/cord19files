As the rearing season proceeded, an increase in mortality levels was noted in some rearing units. Many sick birds showed seediness, stopped feeding and suffered watery diarrhoea and dehydration; death occurred within 36-48 h of the onset of diarrhoea. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was noted, for all isolates, at the third passage and was characterized by rounded swollen cells containing granular cytoplasma. There was a progressive detaching of infected cells that, for some time, remained attached to the plastic by a slender bridge of cytoplasma. Finally the entire monolayer was destroyed.
