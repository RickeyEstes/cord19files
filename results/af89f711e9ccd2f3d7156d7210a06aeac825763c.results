Reductions of MHV and TGEV infectivity on surfaces by hospital germicides are shown in Table 2 . For MHV, only 70% ethanol and Purell Hand Gel (62% ethanol) produced a log 10 infectious virus titer reduction factor .2.5 after 1-minute contact time. Hypochlorite (1:100 use dilution) was least effective, producing a log 10 reduction factor ,1. Hypochlorite, Vesphene IIse, Cidex-OPA, and Clorox Anywhere spray each produced a log 10 reduction factor of ,2.5, with log 10 reduction factors of 0.62, 1.33, 1.71, and 1.98, respectively. Statistical analysis using 1-way ANOVA showed that the mean log 10 reduction factors for the 6 germicides differed significantly (P , .0001). For TGEV, infectivity reduction factors of .3-log 10 were observed for 70% ethanol (3.19) , Purell Hand Gel (4.04), and Clorox Anywhere spray (3.57). Vesphene and Cidex against TGEV produced intermediate log 10 infectivity reduction factors of 2.03 and 2.27, respectively. As seen with MHV, hypochlorite exposure resulted in an infectious TGEV titer log 10 reduction factor ,1 (0.35). Statistical analysis using 1-way ANOVA showed that the mean log 10 reduction factors were significantly different (P , .0001) among the 6 germicides. Analysis of the mean log 10 reductions of MHV and TGEV by germicides was done using the Tukey multiple comparison test to determine whether reductions by individual germicides significantly differed from one another (P , .05) ( Table 3 ). In addition, 2-way ANOVA was used to compare 2 independent variables, germicide and virus type, and their influence on the log 10 virus reduction factor. This analysis aids in determining how much of the variability in reduction is explained by each of these 2 variables, as well as potential interaction between them. Using 2-way ANOVA, infectivity reduction results are statistically significant (P , .0001). A type III sum of squares test was used to examine variation among mean reduction results. Germicide had a greater influence on log 10 viral reduction (P , .0001) than did the virus type (TGEV vs MHV) (P 5 .0008). Additionally, when interaction between germicide and virus type was evaluated using the ANOVA test, it was determined that there is a statistically significant interaction between virus type and germicide type (P 5 .0001).
