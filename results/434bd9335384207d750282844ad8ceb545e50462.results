Leishmania-specific Humoral Immune Response in Dogs Vaccinated with LBSap after Challenge with L. infantum Plus SGE Significant (p,0.05) increases in the serum levels of anti-Leishmania total IgG (Fig.1A) at the time before challenge (Tbc; i.e. 85 days before experimental challenge), 20, 90 and 274 days after challenge (dac) were observed in the LBSap group when compared with the C and Sap groups at 20 dac as well as C, Sap and LB groups at Tbc and 90 and 274 dac. LB group showed higher levels (p,0.05) of total IgG compared with C at 20 dac and compared with C and Sap dogs at 90 dac (Fig. 1A) . Also, the LBSap group elicited higher levels (p,0.05) of total IgG at 885 dac compared with those of C and Sap groups (Fig. 1A) . Moreover, the LBSap group showed higher levels (p,0.05) of IgG1 at Tbc and 20, 90, 274 and 541 dac when compared with the other groups (C, Sap and LB) and compared with C dogs at 435 dac (Fig. 1B) . Additionally, at 20 dac, we observed higher levels (p,0.05) of anti-Leishmania IgG1 in LB dogs compared with C and Sap groups (Fig. 1B) . Higher levels (p,0.05) of anti-Leishmania IgG2 were observed in the LBSap group at Tbc and 90 and 274 dac compared with other groups. Furthermore, at 20, 435, 541 and 885 dac the LBSap dogs showed increases (p,0.05) of IgG2 compared with C and Sap groups (Fig. 1C) . LB showed higher levels (p,0.05) of IgG2 compared with C group only at 20 dac (Fig. 1C) . Further analysis demonstrated that the IgG2/IgG1 ratio was lower (p,0.05) in the LBSap group when compared with Sap (Tbc and 20, 90, 274, 435, 541 and 885 dac), C (435 and 541 dac) and LB (274, 435 and 541 dac) groups (Fig. 1D ).
