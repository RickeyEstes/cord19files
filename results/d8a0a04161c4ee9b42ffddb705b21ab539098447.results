Both nested RT-PCR and the real-time RT-PCR assays performed on the sputum sample from a person with SARS tested positive for SARS-CoV RNA. The viral load in the sample was estimated to be 5.6 x 10 4 SARS-CoV RNA copies/mL. Twenty-four hours after injection of Vero cells with the sputum sample, a strong CPE was observed, as indicated in Figure 1B . The CPE was diffused with cell rounding with refractive appearance, and the cell monolayer was destroyed as compared to control uninfected Vero cells ( Figure 1A) . The viral load in the culture supernatant 24 hours after injection with the clinical sample was 1.3 x 10 5 copies/mL as determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Serial passage of the virus on Vero cells to obtain a tertiary viral stock yielded 9.1 x 10 8 copies/mL. A plaque assay was optimized to determine the in vitro infectivity of SARS-CoV. The tertiary viral stock tested 2.5 x 10 6 PFU/mL in the plaque assay, suggesting that about 360 genomes were required to generate a single plaque in tissue cultures, at least under the conditions described here. We also used the plaque assay for testing the potential inhibitory effect on virus infectivity of a single concentration of heparin, the prototypic compound of a class of inhibitors of virus entry for enveloped viruses including HIV type 1 (HIV-1) (14) and herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and 2) (15). Heparin indeed reduced the formation of plaques by 50% when added 30 min before infection of Vero cells with 100 PFU/mL of the SARS-CoV (Figure 2 ). Thin-section electron microscopy showed the typical features of intracellular CoV particles. Cells were engulfed with viral particles localized in cytoplasmic vesicles ( Figure 3A ). This feature is typical of all Coronaviridae viruses that bud intracellularly at membranes of the intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex, whereas newly assembled virions reach the cell surface by vesicular transport (16) . After the extracellular release, virus particles were found in large clusters adjacent to the plasma membrane, as evidenced in Figure 3B . Overall, the ultrastructural analysis documented that SARS-CoV cultivated in Vero cells behaved like a typical coronavirus, characterized by intracellular budding (Figure 3, panels C and D) . The sequence of SARS-CoV strain HSR1 genomic RNA was 29,751 bases in length, with a polyA tail. We identified the major open reading frames (ORFs), coding for the 4 major structural proteins, namely: spike (S), envelope (E) matrix (M), nucleocapsid (N) gene products, and at least other 10 proteins, including a few of unknown function. The complete sequence of SARS-CoV strain HSR1 has been deposited in the GenBank database (GenBank accession no. AY323977). This sequence was aligned with those of the other 21 SARS-CoV isolates to facilitate phylogenetic analysis. Overall, the mean difference in nucleotide composition between all the isolates was 18 Â± 1 nt variations within the whole genomes, thus confirming the genetic conservation observed previously (9) . On the whole, 149 sites were variable among the 22 aligned isolates, and 24 loci in the viral genome varied in more than one isolate, including in the SARS-CoV HSR1 genome (recurrent mutations). Eleven of 24 recurrent mutations were silent, whereas 3 of 13 mutations generating amino acid substitutions were observed within the Nterminal domain of the spike glycoprotein gene (positions 21,722, 22,223, and 22,423, determining a G to D, an I to T, and a G to R amino acid change, respectively). Six mutations were detected in the replicase gene (positions 8,572, 9,404, 9,479, 9,854, 17,564, and 19 ,084, determining a V to L, a V to A, a V to A, an A to V, a D to E, and a T to I amino acid change, respectively), and 1 mutation was found in the matrix protein (position 26,600, determining an A to V amino acid change). The phylogenetic analysis was also performed by using the maximum parsimony method, considering only sequence variants that recurred in more than one strain in order to reduce the mutational noise caused by PCR or sequencing mistakes. Figure 4 shows the phylogenetic tree obtained with the maximum likelihood method. The maximum parsimony trees produced the same structure with minor changes in the subtrees' branch patterns (data not shown). In these analyses, SARS-CoV HSR1 appears to be strongly related to strains isolated from patients who had traveled from Hong Kong to different geographic areas (Singapore, Canada, Vietnam) and spread the infection to their home countries in a few cases.
