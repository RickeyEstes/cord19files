We investigated a population of 324 specimens predominantly collected during winter 2004, our peak months of viral ARTI, using a previously reported pan-coronavirus RT-PCR assay (Chiu et al., 2005) . Nucleotide sequencing of coronavirus-positive specimens determined two instances of HCoV-HKU1. Using HCoV-HKU1-specific primers provided by Dr. Patrick Woo, Hong Kong University (personal communication) we re-screened the population and detected an additional eight instances of HCoV-HKU1 infection from NPAs of children less than 4 years of age and one 40 year old adult, resulting in a prevalence of 7.5% of whom 66.7% were female. One co-detection, representing 11.1% of HCoV-HKU1 positive specimens, was detected in which HMPV and HCoV-OC43 were also present in the same 13-month-old male presenting with bronchiolitis. We next designed a new pair of PCR primers for HBoV diagnosis in order to avoid the non-specific amplification we noted when screening using a previously described assay (data not shown; (Allander et al., 2005) ). When investigating the same specimen population we detected 18 instances of HBoV from the NPAs of children less than 3 years of age (59.3% male) indicating a prevalence of 5.6% comprising 13.5% of all microbial detections. HRSV was the most frequently detected microbe in our population with 14.5% of specimens containing the virus (n = 47). HBoV was the second most frequently detected microbe followed by HMPV at 5.2% (n = 17) and HCoV-OC43 at 3.4% (n = 11). Seven instances of HCoV-OC43 (63.6%) were missed by the pan-coronavirus assay while one pan-coronavirus-positive was sequenced and found to be HCoV-229E, a target not included in this study. HCoV-HKU1 was the fifth most frequently detected microbe comprising 7.5% of all microbial detections and 3.1% of the study's specimen population. In eight instances, HBoV was the sole microbe detected and in two of these either bronchiolitis or viral pneumonia was suspected. In the remaining 10 instances, (55.6% of all HBoV detections) another microbe was detected, including eight instances of HRSV and one each of HAdV and HMPV type A2. Children aged between 0 and 6 months (44.4% of all detections) were most at risk of infection by HCoV-HKU1, whereas children aged between 6 months and 2 years were the group most at risk of infection by HBoV. None of the 65 subjects older than 5 years were infected with HBoV whilst 1 HCoV-HKU1 infection occurred among this group. Both viruses were detected throughout winter with HBoV occurring in late autumn but predominantly in early winter (61.1% of all microbial detections during June), and HCoV-HKU1 occurring solely in winter, predominantly late winter (55.6% of all detections occurred in August). Detailed clinical reviews of virus-positive patients were not performed in this study; however, clinical notes made at consultation described presenting signs including rhinorrhoea, fever cough and wheeze and disease manifestations including bronchiolitis and pneumonia that were consistent with ARTI. To better understand the nature of the two viruses under investigation and to confirm our PCR results we sequenced eight HCoV-HKU1 and 10 HBoV strains. Phylogenetic analysis of Queensland HCoV-HKU1 strains indicated that a single cluster existed, but that it represented a second lineage when compared to the prototype Hong Kong strain. We propose the lineages be termed HCoV-HKU1 A and B (Fig. 1) . Queensland HCoV-HKU1 strains exhibited 97.5%-98% nucleotide and 100% predicted amino acid sequence homology with the prototype strain. Queensland HBoV strains (Fig. 2) shared greater than 99% nucleotide and 100% predicted amino acid homology with the HBoV prototype strains, st1 and st2.
