Previous biochemical assays for the enzymatic activity associated with bacteriophage tails relied on the liberation of radioactivity from labeled cell envelopes (Iwashita and Kanegasaki, 1976a; Svenson et al., 1979; Berget and Poteete, 1980) or on the determination of reducing ends produced by the glycosidic cleavage of partially purified Salmonella polysaccharide (Seckler et al., 1989; Danner et al., 1993) . Because we found such assays to be unsuitable for a quantitative analysis of the enzymatic reaction catalyzed by the P22 tailspike protein and a characterization of the catalytic mechanism, we attempted to set up an endorhamnosidase assay based on a homogeneous substrate. The smallest substrate known to be efficiently cleaved by the enzyme, a dodecasaccharide fragment from Salmonella lipopolysaccharide purified by gel filtration chromatography (Weintraub et al., 1988) , was labeled at its reducing end by reductive amination with the fluorescent dye Amc, and the labeled oligosaccharide was purified by reversed-phase HPLC. Upon incubation with purified P22 tailspike protein, the labeled dodecasaccharide was efficiently cleaved into labeled tetrasaccharide and unlabeled octasaccharide, as identified by reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography Endorhamnosidase activity of the wild-type protein For quantitative analysis of DodAmc cleavage, reversedphase HPLC with fluorescence detection was used (Fig. 3) . At a flow rate of 1 ml/min, the HPLC retention times of DodAmc, OctAmc, and TetAmc were 16.8 min, 17.5 min, and 18.1 min, respectively. Fig. 3 A shows the elution profiles of pure DodAmc and of a sample from a 15-min incubation at 10°C with purified wild-type protein. As the amino-terminal head-binding domain of the tailspike protein is dispensable for oligosaccharide binding and hydrolysis (Danner et al., 1993) , wild-type and point mutant proteins used in this study lack the N-terminal 108 residues that interfere with the crystallographic analysis (Steinbacher et al., 1994) . We have not detected any significant differences between full-length and N-terminally shortened proteins in the oligosaccharide hydrolysis and binding assays used. The HPLC peaks of DodAmc and TetAmc were very well separated and could be integrated independently. The fraction of TetAmc was calculated from the peak areas, and the rate of DodAmc hydrolysis was found to be nearly constant up to 10% total turnover (Fig. 3 B) . Rates determined at increasing substrate concentrations increased in a hyperbolic fashion, and a fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation yielded a KM of 2.3 ± 0.3 ,uM and a turnover rate constant of kcat = 0.01 ± 0.002 s-1 at 10°C (Fig. 3 C) . To achieve substrate saturation, the DodAmc concentration was kept above 25 X KD of the unlabeled dodecasaccharide measured at the respective temperature (cf. below). An Arrhenius plot of the rates measured under these conditions between 2°C and 20°C was close to linear and resulted in an activation energy of 35 5 kJ/mol.
