Roughly 10% of invited households agreed to participate (appendix). Table 1 presents the comparison of unweighted cohort demographics with those of the England population showing good geographical spread but underrepresentation of young adults; people living in socially deprived areas, north England, west Midlands, and London; and people of non-white ethnic origin. Person follow-up time (118 158 person-weeks, 5448 person-seasons), illness-status reports (102 300: 86·6% of follow-up weeks), nasal swab submissions (2941; 88·3% of 3332 illnesses recorded during periods of infl uenza circulation), and infl uenza virus detection results are given in the appendix. There were 3295 paired sera (81% of eligible adults and 27% of eligible children aged 5-15 years, in whom blood tests were optional). Of these 2737 (83 %) were in unvaccinated individuals. The highest rates of infl uenza-like illness and PCRconfi rmed infl uenza were during the epidemic of H3N2 in 2008-09 before the pandemic and in the 2010-11 third pandemic wave. Compared with other seasons, illness rates in the fi rst pandemic wave were low (fi gure 1). The dominant circulating strain was infl uenza A H3N2 in 2006-07, seasonal A H1N1 in 2007-08, A H3N2 in 2008-09, and A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009-10 and 2010-11. Infl uenza B circulated in 2007-08 and 2008-09 when it peaked after the main infl uenza A outbreak. In 2010-11 the infl uenza B peak coincided with the third wave of A(H1N1)pdm09. On average, based on rates per 100 person-seasons, PCR-confi rmed infl uenza was identifi ed in 4% (95% CI 3-5) of the cohort each winter: 3% (2-5) during prepandemic seasons and 5% (4-6) during pandemic winter seasons. Highest rates were in the third pandemic wave when 9% (6-13) had PCRconfi rmed disease (6% infl uenza A and 3% infl uenza B) and in the 2008-09 season when 6% (4-10) had PCRconfi rmed disease (5% infl uenza A and 2% infl uenza B). In all seasons most PCR-confi rmed cases were infl uenza A, although infl uenza B was important in 2007-08, 2008-09, and 2010-11. Risk of PCR-confi rmed disease tended to decrease with increasing age (fi gure 2, appendix). For infl uenza A this age dependence was most apparent during the H3N2 epidemic of 2008-09 and the 2009-10 second wave of the H1N1 pandemic when children had signifi cantly higher rates of PCR-confi rmed disease and serological infection with infl uenza A than older adults (appendix). For infl uenza B, children had signifi cantly higher rates of PCR-confi rmed disease than adults in 2008-09 and 2010-11 seasons (appendix). The 2010-11 third wave of the H1N1 pandemic was unusual in having markedly higher rates of infl uenza A in young adults than any other season. PCRconfi rmed infl uenza was very rare in people older than 65 years in all seasons. On average, based on rates per 100 person-seasons, infl uenza infected 18% (95% CI [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] of the unvaccinated population each winter season: 19% (15-24) during prepandemic seasons and 18% (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) during the pandemic. The highest infection rate (27%, 22-34; 24% infl uenza A, 2% infl uenza B) was in the season
