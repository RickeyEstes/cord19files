At 08:00 hours, positive staphylococcal growth was recovered from 83% (five out of six) and 77% (23 out of 30) of the bedside surfaces occupied by MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative patients, respectively in the studied ward cubicle ( Table 2 ). Irrespective of MRSA carrier status, both coagulase-positive (CPS) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were recovered from all bed-units. Three random swab specimens were collected at 08:00 hours (an hour after hypochlorite cleaning) from each bedside surface of each bed-unit, thus a total of 108 swabs from each bedside surface site tested. Majority of the sampled bedside surfaces were negative for the bacterial growth (4.6%-11.1% positive for CNS; 2.8%-9.3% positive for MSSA; and 7.4%-17.6% positive for MRSA as summarized in Table 3 ). Among those surfaces with positive growth, the colony numbers recovered for CNS, MSSA, and MRSA were ranged 1-16, 1-193, and 1-276 cfu/cm 2 , respectively. Irrespective of the swabbing site, CNS, MSSA, and MRSA were recovered from 44%, 28%, and 56% of all bed-units sampled. The mean CNS concentrations in the bed-units of the MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative patients were 1.9 cfu/cm 2 and 1.6 cfu/cm 2 , respectively. From the bed-units of the MRSA-positive patients, the ratio of CPS and CNS was found to be 2:4, and all CPS isolates were revealed to be oxacillin resistant with an overall burden of 3.9 cfu/cm 2 . On the other hand, from the MRSA-negative bed-units, the CPS isolates were a mixture of MSSA and MRSA. Half of the CPS isolates were revealed to be oxacillin resistant with a mean concentration of 7.9 cfu/cm 2 , which was significantly (p < 0.05) heavier than the amount recovered from the MRSA-positive bed-units. Overall, the staphylococcal distribution among CNS, MSSA, and MRSA was in the ratio of 2:6:8. Reference to the layout of the testing ward cubicle (Figure 1a) , heavier growths were found to be at beds next to the MRSA-positive bed (i.e., beds 2 and 6). Bed 4 was also observed to have relatively heavy growth. However, none of the beds had growth that was statistically different from that of other beds (data is not shown). Among all control bed-units received only hypochlorite cleaning, the mean staphylococcal contamination increased significantly (p < 0.01) by 80% from 08:00 to 12:00 hours (Figure 2a) . Table 2 . A comparison of the concentrations and types of staphylococcal bacteria recovered from the bedside surfaces of bed-units occupied by MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative patients at 08:00 hours. Notes: A total of 36 bed-units were sampled in 6 separate days at 08:00 hours. The studied cubicle was fully occupied in all of those days, and only one MRSA-positive patient was included in each sampling day. The statistical difference in MSSA loadings between the MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative could not be determined, because the count for one comparison group was zero. N.D. = Non-detectable which means colony is absent in the petrifilm plate. The detection limit of the sampling technique was 1 cfu/Petrifilm (which is equivalent to cfu/cm 2 ). Some of the mean cfu/cm 2 values presented in this table were smaller than the detection limit as influenced by a large number of 0 (non-detectable) values (refer to Table 3 for the percentage of the positive culture at each sampling site). The same trend was observed in the bed-units of MRSA-positive and negative patients; however, the increase in staphylococcal contamination in the MRSA-negative beds (from 2.8 to 4.8 cfu/cm 2 ) was approximately four times that in the MRSA-positive bed-units (from 1.5 to 2.0 cfu/cm 2 ) (Figure 2b,c) . The staphylococcal strain that increased after the four-hour period was mainly coagulase positive and sensitive to oxacillin, and hence was MSSA. With the focus on oxacillin resistance, sites of contamination were shown to be different among the bed-units of MRSA-positive and negative patients. The surface of the left-side handrail was found to be the most heavily contaminated site, containing 84% of all MRSA isolates recovered from the MRSA-negative bed-units. Indeed, the left-side handrail was found to have an MRSA concentration 11-fold significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that of the right-side handrail. However, with regard to the MRSA-positive bed-units, 54% of the MRSA isolates were recovered from the overbed rolling table surface as the dominant site of contamination. The mean MRSA concentration on the surface of the right-side handrail was found to be slightly higher (albeit statistically insignificant) than that on the surface of the left-side handrail, while none was recovered from the bedside table specimens.
