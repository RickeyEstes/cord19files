Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) of RNA aptamers against Core. Mature Core consists of two distinct domains: the N terminal domain 1 (D1, 124 residues), which is highly basic and binds RNA, and the hydrophobic C terminal domain 2 (D2, 50 residues) which possesses a membrane binding region. D2 stabilises Core on the surface of lipid droplets and exposes the hydrophilic D1 to the viral RNA, therefore it is essential for nucleocapsid formation in mammalian cells 13 . However, in vitro D1 is sufficient to form stable proteinase-resistant nucleocapsids when stabilised by interactions with nucleic acids [14] [15] [16] . We therefore prepared D1 as a SELEX target by recombinant protein expression. D1 HCV Core (JFH-1) was expressed in E. coli and purified by nickel affinity chromatography against an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. The identity of the his-tagged protein was confirmed by LC-MS/MS of Coomassie stained bands excised from an SDS-PAGE gel. The antigenicity of the final purified protein was also confirmed by immunoblotting for Core D1 and the hexahistidine tag (Fig. 1) . This protein was used for SELEX with a 2′ OH RNA aptamer library encompassing a N35 random region. SELEX is an established process for the in vitro isolation of high-affinity aptamers: in vitro selected nucleic acid molecules which bind with high affinity and specificity to their target 17, 18 . Each aptamer within a randomised library possesses a unique tertiary structure, depending on the series of stems, pseudoknots, kinks and/or bulges which are present in its most stable conformation. Each aptamer will bind with varying affinity to the ligand of interest. SELEX is therefore likely to enrich for aptamers with conserved conformation rather than a unique primary sequence. Locations and consensus motif of putative packaging signals (pPSs). The sequences present in the final round of SELEX were determined by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of the pool and the individual aptamer sequences were aligned to the JFH-1 genome (GenBank ID AB047639.1). It should be noted that known PSs in other ssRNA viruses are sequence/structure degenerate and their capsid/coat protein recognition sequences are discontinuous and minimal 12, 19, 20 . A consequence is that the pool of binders from SELEX should include a majority of oligonucleotides that, although matching essential features of HCV PSs, are unlikely to match extended regions of the genome. Despite this constraint, there are aptamers that match multiple sites within the genome and occur with statistical significance (a Bernoulli score of 12 or more; red peaks, Fig. 2 ) compared to the unselected naïve library (grey peaks, Fig. 2 ). This outcome suggests that the HCV genome does contain multiple PS sites. In order to test this hypothesis, the same procedure was applied to an additional 14 genotype 2 HCV genomes, i.e. they were compared to the aptamers selected against JFH-1, and a similar picture emerged. This suggests that these PS sites are evolutionarily conserved. Such peaks, within 10 nucleotides of the Scientific RepoRts | 6:22952 | DOI: 10.1038/srep22952 peaks in Fig. 2 , which were conserved for at least 60% of these additional strains, are highlighted by green arrows (Fig. 2) . For each of these conserved peaks the 30 nucleotides 5′ and 3′ to the peak nucleotide in the JFH-1 genome were extracted, and a range of possible secondary structure folds were considered via mFold 21 . A similarity analysis revealed the potential formation of stem-loops with similar loop motifs in each of these fragments. An alignment of the loop portions of these stem-loops is displayed in Fig. 3a . This analysis reveals a bias towards a GRRGR loop motif, R denoting a purine, suggesting that PSs should exhibit this motif or close variations thereof. In order to establish the statistical significance of this motif, we compared its occurrence in the loop portion of stem-loops in the wild-type genome with that in randomised versions of the genome, both for JFH-1 and for the other strain variants considered here. This confirmed a significant statistical bias in the wild-type genomes for this motif. We then interrogated sub-motifs of GRRGR in order to identify those with an even higher statistical significance, which revealed a GGRGG motif. The positions of stem-loops with this motif across the JFH-1 genome are displayed in Fig. 3b . Modeling indicates that an ensemble of packaging signals with different degrees of affinity for capsid protein is required to promote efficient assembly 11, 22 . Lower-affinity motifs may not necessarily be easily identifiable through a SELEX screen, yet their presence at statistically significant numbers within the wild-type genome
