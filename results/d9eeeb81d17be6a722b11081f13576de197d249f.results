230 patients and 33 staff in our HD center were included in this study. The dynamic course of COVID-19 epidemic from emerging to development is schematic presented in Figure 1 . We can see that the first COVID-19 patient was diagnosed on January 14, and the second diagnosed patient appeared on January 17. Since January 21, patients with COVID-19 had been requested to be isolated and all medical staff had be asked to upgrade their personal prevention and protection, which including wearing full protective gear such as waterproof disposable gown, cap, gloves, face shield, and N95 face mask, and more rigorous cleaning and disinfection. On The other 31 patients were distributed to the designated hospital receiving HD and other treatment. 4 (12.12%) medical staffs with COVID-19 were treated in isolation wards. There are totally 7 episodes of death were recorded since the epidemic outbreak, 2 happened in hospital and 5 at home. Among the 7 died cases, 6 were HD patients with COVID-19 and the other one was COVID-19 free ( Figure 2B ). All of the death were followed and reviewed by our research team, the presumed cause of death was heart failure, hyperkalemia and cerebrovascular disease, and none of them succumbed to severe pneumonia based on the appearance of death ( Figure 2B ). 37 HD patients with COVID-19 demographic and biochemical clinical data were summarized in Table 1 . In total, 23 (62%) men and 14 (38%) women were concluded. The median age of all patients was 66 years (IQR, 55-81), and the median HD age was 34 months (IQR, 13-61). Meanwhile, all clinical data involving dry weight, hemoglobin, albumin, blood calcium, blood phosphorus, blood intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and Kt/VUrea values were also listed in Table 1 . Unlike previous studies, the clinical symptoms of HD patients with COVID-19 were not obvious since the medical records showed that 4 (11%) patients had fever, 3 (8%) patients had fatigue, and only 1 (3%) patient had the symptom of cough, chest pain or nausea respectively (Table 2) . Besides, no other symptoms were observed in these patients. According to chest CT scans reports, 15 (41%) patients showed unilateral involvement (13 cases in right lung and 2 cases in left lung) and 22 (59%) patients showed bilateral involvement. 23 (62%) patients had multiple "ground-glass opacity" lesions in the lung which were regarded as the characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia (Table 3 and Figure 3 ). The immune system is the key defense line for the body to resist and eliminate the virus. In the antiviral immune response, cellular immunity (including T cells and NK cells) plays a central role, while humoral immunity plays a coordinating role. The underlined mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inflicted harmful effects leading to severe condition or death in COVID-19 patients is the over response against the virus by immune system and large amount of cytokines production (cytokine storm) [13] . The above results show that most of the HD patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were in .
