ONC is a paradigmatic antitumor RNase whose cytotoxic mechanism has been studied by different means [6] . Nevertheless, microarray profiling to broadly analyze the genes affected by this drug has only been done in hMM cell lines [12] . We have used the same approach to study the effects of ONC in two ovarian carcinoma cell lines, NCI/ADR-RES and its parental OVCAR-8. In addition, our results allow us to compare the effects on gene expression promoted by two different RNases in cancer cells: ONC, an RNase that exerts its action in the cytosol, and PE5, an ND-RNase [29] .
