Genetic background determines viral load and disease severity in response to IAV and SARS-CoV infection The eight founder strains of the CC were infected with either 5 · 10 2 PFU of mouse-adapted influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus (PR8) or 1 · 10 5 PFU of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15), and lung samples were collected at day 2 and day 4 after infection, with three replicates at each time point. Time-matched lung samples from mock-infected animals were also collected, resulting in a total of 124 lung samples. Total RNA was then sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq with a stranded library preparation protocol that generated 2 · 100 nt paired-ends reads. Each sample was ensured to have at least 30 million reads and, on average, there were 48 million reads per sample. We then verified the sequence quality and filtered out ribosomal RNA reads and viral reads. The viral read counts varied among the founder strains, suggesting that the genotypes of the animals had an effect on viral loads in the lung (Supporting Information, Figure S1 ). Some strains, such as 129S1/SvImJ and CAST/EiJ, had high levels of MA15 RNA on day 4 after infection whereas others, such as NZO/ HILtJ and NOD/ShiLtJ, had low levels of MA15 RNA ( Figure S2 ). Strain-dependent variations in viral RNA levels were also observed in PR8-infected mice, although the pattern of high vs. low viral RNA levels was not necessarily the same. For example, although NOD/ ShiLtJ mice had lower levels of MA15 RNA than did the other mouse strains on day 4, the inverse was true for PR8 RNA levels in this strain ( Figure S2 ). The pattern of viral read-counts for PR8 can be wellexplained by Mx1 alleles in the eight founders (Ferris et al. 2013) . Weight loss is a common and quantifiable readout of disease severity in mouse models of IAV and SARS-CoV infection. To assess the effect of genetic background on the severity of IAV and SARS disease, we measured the daily body weights of the mice from time of infection to time of kill. The daily body weights of the mice are provided in Figure S3 for MA15-infected mice and in Figure S4 for PR8-infected mice. A wide variety of phenotypes emerged, ranging from 20% weight loss to essentially no weight loss. Strikingly, NZO/ HlLtJ mice, alone among the eight strains, did not lose weight when infected with either PR8 or MA15.
