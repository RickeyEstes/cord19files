Clinico-laboratory findings in HD patients. Forty-five percent of the patients were undergoing dialysis because of diabetes mellitus end-stage renal disease (DM-ESRD) ( Table 1 ). The average value of the Charlson comorbidity index was 4.52 Â± 1.86. The Hct were decreased at M1, then recovered at M3 (Fig. 1 , Table 2 ). The level of kt/v at M1 was lower than the levels before and after the MERS isolation period, but a significant difference was found only between the level of M1 and M3. The indoxyl sulfate (IS) level was not decreased at M0-M1. The levels of IS at M3 were significantly higher than those at M0 and M1 (Fig. 1) . The levels of IS at M0 closely correlated with those at M1 and M3 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Two HD patients died during quarantine. The first death was ascribed to aspiration pneumonia in an 88-year-old female patient with hypertensive ESRD. The second death was caused by mechanical ileus and pneumonia in a 91-year-old female with hypertensive ESRD. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Effect of isolation on the level of ccf-gDNA. Segregation affected the levels of circulating cf-DNA. The ccf-gDNA (LPL) was significantly elevated at M0, irrespective of whether the subject was a patient or staff member (Fig. 2) . The levels of ccf-gDNA decreased over time, but the decrease was delayed in HD patients. At M1, ccf-gDNA levels were significantly higher in HD patients than in the medical staff. The ccf-gDNA level initially abruptly decreased in medical staff but slowly reduced in HD patients. The delta value of ccf-gDNA between M0 and M1 and between M1 and M3 was not different between HD patients and medical staff. These results indicated that stress was sufficient to increase ccf-gDNA levels both in HD patients and medical staff. However, the correction of increased ccf-gDNA levels was delayed in HD patients.
