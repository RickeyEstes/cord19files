A total of 874 cases were tested for MERS-CoV from the period beginning July 1, 2013, and ending January 31, 2015. Of these, 16 (1.8%) were MERS-CoV positive. They were all non-HCWs (Fig 3) . During this time period the ED served more than 80,000 patients and institutional inpatient bed capacity was >700 with an occupancy rate consistently >90%. Institution employee numbers exceeded 11,000. Of the 874 MERS-CoV samples tested, 180 (21%) were from HCWs. HCW testing was due to meeting the case criteria or to protected/ unprotected exposure. Exposure occurred in 3 of the confirmed cases as a result of a delay in the initiation of isolation precautions due to lack of early recognition of symptoms or incubation period. Testing of the non-HCWs (n = 694) was due to case criteria being met during admission or upon presentation to the institution through the ED or clinics, or as part of a screening requirement at the time of admission; that is, direct admission from another hospital per the epidemic plan. The majority of patients with positive cases were men (69%) with a mean age of 56 years (range, 19-84 years). All case patients except 1 had comorbidities and/or immunocompromised status. Ten of the 16 patients with confirmed cases died (62%). Mortality was directly or indirectly attributed to complications that developed as a result of MERS-CoV infection. All case patients had respiratory symptoms on initial presentation except for 1 patient who was admitted for elective surgery and developed respiratory symptoms with fever postoperatively on day 7. This was considered community acquired because the incubation period overlapped with the preadmission period. No cases were considered health careassociated infections (Table 3) . Potential HCW exposure days are calculated from the date of MERS-CoV symptom onset while in hospital until either the date of negative screening result(s) or death while positive. During the period of study the potential HCW exposure days totaled 338. The mean duration of potential infectivity per case was 21 days (range, 4-57 days).
