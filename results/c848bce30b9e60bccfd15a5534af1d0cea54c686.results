Between July 2010 and April 2012, we recruited 178 patients with at least one predisposing condition for ARDS from the participating hospitals in Beijing, China. The majority of patients were male (n = 125, 70%) and the mean age was 63 years (median: 69; interquartile range: 51-78 years) ( Table 1 ). Median APACHE II score was 16 (interquartile range: [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and median length of time in the ICU was 10.5 days (interquartile range: 5-17 days). Mechanical ventilation was used on 149 patients (84%) for a median length of six days (interquartile range: 2-11 days). Thirtynine patients had diabetes, and one patient had chronic kidney disease.
