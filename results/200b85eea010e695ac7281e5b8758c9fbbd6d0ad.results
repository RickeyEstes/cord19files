Between January 2014 and March 2017, 50 adult SCD patients meeting haploidentical HSCT eligibility requirements [10] were referred to our program ( Figure 1B ). Nine patients were initially denied by insurance, and therefore only 41 could be screened for donor availability. Of these, 4 (10%) lacked an available haploidentical donor and 12 (29%) had moderate (n = 7) or high (n = 5) levels of DSAs, a strong predictor of graft rejection in haploidentical HSCT [11] . Of the 25 patients (61%) with an identified haploidentical donor, 1 additional patient was denied by insurance before transplant and 14 (34%) ultimately declined or deferred HSCT, resulting in a total of 10 patients being transplanted. All recipients received PBSCs from their haploidentical donors. In 7 HbAS donors, mobilization with G-CSF did not lead to increased side effects and produced similar stem cell collections as in HbAA donors. The first 2 patients (Table 1 , top) were conditioned with alemtuzumab/3 Gy TBI + PTCy but failed to engraft donor cells and recovered autologous neutrophils on day +39 and day +34, respectively. The following 8 patients (Table 1 , bottom) were conditioned with the modified Hopkins regimen (TBI 3 Gy and PBSCs as the graft source) ( Figure 1A ). All 8 patients engrafted > .5 × 10 9 neutrophils/L at a median of 22 days (range, 18 to 23). One patient had low donor T cell chimerism levels at days +30 and +60 that spontaneously improved by day +180 without any changes in immunosuppression. Another patient had a progressive decline of donor whole blood and T cell chimerisms and experienced secondary graft failure on day +90 with autologous hematopoietic recovery. At 1 year post-HSCT, 7 patients maintained an average donor mononuclear chimerism > 95% and T cell chimerism ≥ 90% ( Figure 1C ). Transplant-related toxicities included at least grade 2 mucositis in 3 patients and cytomegalovirus reactivation in 2 patients without occurrence of cytomegalovirus infection. Seven neutropenic patients with HbS < 30% received a median of 7 doses (range, 3 to 14) of G-CSF at 5 μg/kg starting at day +12 post-HSCT. Only 1 patient experienced mild bone pain in the lower extremities. Small subarachnoid hemorrhages occurred in 2 patients. The first patient had a history of multiple RBC antibodies, became refractory to platelet transfusions, and developed multifocal small subarachnoid hemorrhages in the left parietal lobe on day +10. Symptoms and brain imaging improved 4 days later after platelet counts were maintained at >50 × 10 9 cells/L with crossmatched platelets. The second patient, who had a prior stroke history, developed a seizure when the platelet count was 68 × 10 9 cells/L. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain demonstrated a right frontal subarachnoid hemorrhage on day +12. Symptoms and imaging results improved 2 days later, after initiating levetiracetam and maintaining platelets >100 × 10 9 cells/L. Acute GVHD was observed in 2 patients and chronic GVHD in 1 patient. One patient developed acute on chronic GVHD involving the skin, liver, and eyes on day +83. Treatment with steroids and strict compliance with sirolimus improved eye symptoms and bilirubin levels, but the patient died unexpectedly at home on day +407. Another patient developed grade II acute gut GVHD that completely resolved after a short course of steroid therapy. With a median follow-up of 17 months (range, 12 to 30), 7 patients are alive and 6 maintain >95% stable donor engraftment ( Figure 1C ) with improvements in their hemoglobin concentrations ( Figure 1D ). Three patients have stopped immunosuppression, and the other 3 are being tapered off immunosuppression.
