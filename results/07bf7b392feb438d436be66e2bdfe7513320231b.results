In Table 2 , the history of the MERS-CoV spread status is presented. The Ministry of Health and Welfare, Korea officially announced the data. "Infected" represents the accumulated number of infected patients. "Deceased" is the number of dead subjects. "Recovered" is the number of individuals returning to healthy status. All entries in the table are as of the "Date". The number of infected patients includes both removed and recovered patients. Table 2 shows the MERS-CoV spread data for only the initial phase of the outbreak, i.e., from 20 May 2015 to 12 June 2015. On 7 June 2015, the South Korean government disclosed to the public the list of all hospitals exposed to MERS-CoV, with the dates and duration of exposure [4] . This is Page 6 of 11 Chang BioMed Eng OnLine (2017) 16:79 the first intervention of the government to control the spread. Before this date, there was no control action that could affect estimation of the basic reproduction number of MERS-CoV. The incubation period of MERS-CoV that can range from 2 to 14 days, is 5 days on average [26] . Thus, we use reported data up to 12 June 2015. The total population size is denoted by N(t): It can be seen that from the SIR model (2) Then, we can describe the SIR model (2) as a two-dimensional model. Considering the magnitude of the numbers in Table 2 , it is assumed that Compared to the total size of the population, the number of outbreak cases is small. The N of South Korea is now known to be over 51 million. If the number of outbreak cases is much smaller than the total size of the population, the number N does not need to be exact to estimate system parameters of the SIR model (2) [21, 22] . From [16] , where τ is the transmissibility of the infectious disease and κ is the transmittable contact number by one infected subject per one unit time. Then, the model where the dimension is reduced by assumption (4) is The initial state for the SIR model is provided by Table 2 , given by Now, we only need to know the parameter pair, (κτ, ν), to solve model (5) numerically. To solve the mathematical model and to evaluate the basic reproduction number of the model, we do not need to know each κ and τ necessarily, but we can use the value of the product, i.e., κτ. We search for the parameter pair (κτ, ν) such that can respond appropriately with the data in Table 2 . To evaluate how closely system response is fitted to the data in Table 2 , we employ a quantitative measure, the sum of the squared errors. Once we obtain the optimal values for the parameters with respect to this measure, we can estimate the basic reproduction number as described in the "Methods" section. 16:79 We define the measure f E (·, ·) as where n = 23 and k corresponds to the date. For example, k = 0 and k = 23 indicate the dates 20 May 2015 and 12 June 2015, respectively. I i (·) and R i (·) are from the simulation result of model (5) with the initial condition (6) and the corresponding parameters, i.e., the function arguments (κ i τ i , ν i ). R T (k) is the sum of the values of the "Deceased" and "Recovered" at k in Table 2 . I T (k) is the value, R T (k) subtracted from the value of the "Infected" at k. See Table 3 . Based on the data of Table 2 , I T (k) and R T (k) along with k are shown in Table 3 . To compare the quantitative measures for each pair of parameters, we consider the plane, i.e., 2-dimensional space, of the parameters, (κτ, ν). We can obtain a surface in 3-dimensional space by plotting the corresponding measure as the value along the third axis. We explore the plane for wide ranges of parameters, and one of the results is shown in Fig. 1 . This figure can help show the relation between f E and the system parameters. To effectively capture the characteristics of the measure, the ranges of κτ and ν in the figure are [0.00, 0.26] and [0.00, 0.12], respectively. Table 3 I T (k) and R T (k) of function (7), derived from Table 2 k The function f E (·, ·) describes the sum of squared error between the outbreak data of Table 2 and the simulation result of model (5) with the initial condition (6) and the Fig. 1 Plot of f E (κτ , ν) of (7) on the plane of (κτ, ν). f E (·, ·) is a quantitative measure, the sum of the squared errors, that describes how the system response of model (5) with corresponding parameters is close to the data in Table 2 16:79 function arguments. Thus, if we find the parameters minimizing the function (7), then these parameters can be considered to correspond to the case of Table 2 . Figure 3 shows the data presented in Table 2 and the state trajectories of model (5) with the parameter values obtained from Fig. 2 . The top panel of Fig. 3 shows infected patients, and the bottom panel shows deceased or recovered patients. In both panels, the circle marks and the solid line display patient numbers based on Table 2 and the state transition of model (5), respectively. We derive the basic reproductive number for the SIR model (2) as in the "Methods" section, based on [16] . Equation (8) can be obtained alternatively by using the next generator approach [6, 8, 11, 27] to model (5) . We determine the R 0 of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977 (i.e., 0.21153/0.026122). It is worth comparing with R 0 of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, which had values of 1.5-2.5 [21] . Table 2 and the state trajectories of model (5) with the estimated parameters. In the top panel, the circle marks plot the number of "Infected" patients from Table 2 , and the solid line depicts the transition of state I of model (5) . In the bottom panel, the circle marks indicate the sum of the numbers of "Deceased" and "Recovered" patients, and the solid line depicts the transition of state R of the model
