By linear regression, the rate of wave front spread was 3.3 km/month. The adjusted R 2 was 0.94 ( p < 0.001). The residuals from the linear regression (Fig. 2a) and the spatial distribution of the residuals (Fig. 2b ) are shown. The residuals are clearly correlated spatially, and indicate the clumping of like-residuals consistent with the expected effect of LDTs or local heterogeneities influencing wave front spread.
