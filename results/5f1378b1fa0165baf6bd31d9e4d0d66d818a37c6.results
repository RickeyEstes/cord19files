The aerosol transmission contours are presented in Fig Figure 4 Temperature distance from 25% G7 transmission risk contour. The 4A ogive (cumulative distribution curve for the histogram) for each nation was plotted with a vertical line at the zero point. For Figure 4A bins of 2 degrees C width are used to categorize temperature distances from the 25% G7 transmission risk contour. Figure 4B presents the same temperature distance data in a linear density plot for each nation, with a tick mark for each temperature distance, and the arithmetic mean. The temperature distances were calculated for each point shown in Figure 3 Average Distance from 25% Contour Estimate Mortality per million Figure 6 Closed, Air Conditioned Tropical Ground Transport. The scatter plot (6A) and linear density plot (6B) show all data (multiple time course readings per trip) for motor vehicles categorized by old and new. The vehicle data shown above is for vehicles with closed windows and air conditioning. All old taxi, tour and hotel car readings show low risk (above the 25% G7 transmission risk line). Most readings for new cars in this low risk region are due to higher temperature and low humidity, presumably because automotive engineers are using evaporative cooling from the skin of passengers in dehumidified air to lower perceived temperature. 6B data points produced the cumulative histogram of temperature distances ogive/density charts of Figure 4 . This shows the relationship of readings to the 25% G7 risk contour for the entire dataset. Figure 5 shows correlation of average distance from the 25% G7 contour to cases of influenza. We will now examine in more detail different types of locations surveyed.
