During December 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008, 650 patients were eligible and 192 (29.5%) were recruited. Among those consented patients, most were younger than 18 years of age (n = 147, 76%), male (n = 95, 52%), African American (n = 95, 52%), and hospitalized (n = 116, 63%) (Supplementary Table 1 ). The most common reason for patients not participating in this study was inability to reach the subjects (e.g. wrong telephone numbers in registry, inability to connect the telephone call). The median storage time of nasopharyngeal aspirates was 7 months (range 5.5-11). (Table 1A) 194 Evaluable results for SECONDARY analysis (Table 1B) 6 Subjects had multiple viruses detected (Table 2) 6 Coronavirus detections with sufficient volume sent to 2 nd RT-PCR Fig. 2 . Flow diagram of recruitment and performance analysis process. Bocavirus that were not detectable in both clinical virology laboratory and secondary RT-PCR based platform were excluded (2 subjects with bocavirus only detection and 2 bocavirus detection). After excluding bocavirus and coronavirus detections that clinical virology laboratory had no protocol to detect, 188 were included in the primary performance analysis as in Table 3 . Six coronavirus and 31 samples for which clinical virology laboratory and RT-PCR/ESI-MS did not agree with sufficient volume left were sent to secondary RT-PCR based assay for secondary analysis.
