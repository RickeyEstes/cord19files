The results of the preliminary comparison on 20 samples between ELISA and RPHA are shown in Table I . RPHA detected all nine ELISA-positive samples, using either monoclonal antibody A3M4 or polyclonal hen antibody. One of the 11 ELISA-negative samples (No. 10) gave a weak positive reaction in the RPHA with both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, and the reaction could be blocked with rabbit anti-rotavirus serum. The conclusion that this was a specific reaction was supported by the fact that this sample was from the same outbreak as sample No. 20, which was clearly positive for rotavirus. The results of the three-way comparison between ELISA, RPHA (both with hen antibody) and PAGE are shown in Table II . It became apparent during the study that non-specific haemagglutination was leading to confusion in interpreting the results of the RPHA with a number of faeces samples. A positive result for RPHA is recorded in Table II only where there was complete agglutination of the anti-rotavirus-coated red cells at least ~>1/320 dilution from the faeces, with no agglutination at the same dilution with the control red cells. The agreement between RPHA and PAGE was particularly good; thus 73 samples were positive by PAGE and 72 by RPHA, although the two methods disagreed on seven samples. ELISA detected only 50 of the 76 samples which were positive by either or both of the other tests. For the 204 samples where a result was obtained from all three tests, the overall agreement between RPHA and PAGE was 96%, RPHA and ELISA 89%, and PAGE and ELISA 87%. Where sufficient sample was available, discrepant results were further investigated by repeat tests, some using monoclonal antibody A3M4 in the RPHA, and electron microscopy. The ELISA failed to detect 20 samples  Total 209 *Unable to read RPHA due to non-specific haemagglutination. which were positive by the other two tests, and gave a weak reaction in one case which was negative by RPHA and PAGE. A repeat PAGE test on this sample was negative and the ELISA was interpreted as a false-positive. Two samples negative by ELISA and PAGE gave relatively strong positive reactions with both polyclonal and monoclonal antibody in the RPHA. Repeat tests by PAGE were negative but the finding by electron microscopy of very small numbers of rotavirus particles in one of the two samples indicated that the low level of virus in this case was not detectable in the present gel system. Rotavirus particles were not identified in the second sample and the reason for the discrepancy was not clear. One sample positive in both serological tests was consistently negative by PAGE, but insufficient material was available for further analysis. Four samples were negative by ELISA and RPHA but clearly positive by PAGE. Three of the genome profiles obtained were very weak and repeat tests, in which bands could not be detected, would have been scored as negative. The fourth sample in this group was examined by electron microscopy and contained large numbers of clumped rotavirus particles exhibiting poor morphology. This appearance was consistent with the presence of naturally occurring rotavirus-specific antibody which could have accounted for the negative results in both the RPHA and ELISA tests. An important, but small, group of samples (negative in PAGE and ELISA tests) could not be read by RPHA due to non-specific agglutination.
