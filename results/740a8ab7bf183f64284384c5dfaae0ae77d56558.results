Deletion of eEF1Bc inhibits TBSV RNA accumulation in yeast model host eEF1Bc is coded by TEF3 and TEF4 nonessential genes in yeast [32, 33] . Single deletion of TEF3(CAM1) or TEF4 reduced TBSV repRNA accumulation to ,25% ( Figure 1A , lanes 3-8), while deletion of both genes resulted in even more inhibition, supporting TBSV repRNA accumulation only at 15% level (lanes 9-11). Expression of eEF1Bc (Tef4p) in tef4D yeast increased TBSV replication to ,80%, demonstrating that the defect in TBSV repRNA replication in tef4D yeast can be complemented.Altogether, these data established that eEF1Bc plays an important stimulatory role in TBSV replication.
