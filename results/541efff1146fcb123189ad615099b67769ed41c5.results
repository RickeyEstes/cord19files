Guano miners have an appreciation and respect for bats that live in their communities or are seen existing community caves or fruit orchards. In recent years, it has become illegal to trap or eat bats. In spite of this, most respondents knew people in the community who had trapped bats, usually at the mouths of caves or in fruit orchards, and/or had eaten bats, although they said this was less common since the regulations went into effect. It is legal for community members to collect and eat the occasional bat that falls to the ground after colliding with electric power lines. Respondents who either had eaten bats or knew people who had eaten bats said that they were usually prepared by frying or stir-frying with garlic, chili and/or basil; or boiling in curry after discarding the intestines and wings. Some people also ferment bat meat as they would pork, and serve it with rice; or prepare a spicy bat soup. In addition to cooking bats, the practice of drinking bat blood (e.g. as a health supplement or a few drops mixed with whiskey) was reported as a rumor in three of the four sites. Below is information on the consumption of bats from respondents in each province (identified as A, B, C, and D to protect confidentiality).
