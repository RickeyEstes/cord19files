A total of 171 patients were approached at baseline assessment but 38 of them were unable to participate in the subsequent training sessions. Thus 133 patients remained and were randomised in the current study. Sixty-two of them were in the control group and 71 were in the exercise group. Attendance was monitored through our hospital computer system and all 133 patients completed the training program with over 85% attendance rate achieved. The completion rate of the study was 100%. The control group and the exercise groups did not differ at baseline for age, days of hospitalisation, post-SARS duration, total prednisolone consumed, 6-minute walk distance, muscle strength, muscle endurance, or SF-36 scores (Table 1) . Table 2 . Mean change (post -pre) in physical function and SF-36 scores over the 6-week program (n = 133) and the results of independent t-tests for comparison between the two groups.

Although most of the differences were not significant, variables were considered as potential covariates in the analyses. The differences between the pre-and post-6 week intervention data, collected after 6 weeks of exercise training, on 6-minute walk distance, predicted VO 2max , muscle strength, muscle endurance, and the SF-36 scores are summarised in Table 2 . There were significant differences in the 6-minute walk distance, VO 2max , handgrip strength, and the curl-up and push-up performances between the two groups. The exercise group showed more improvement than the control group in the 6-minute walk distance (77.4 vs 20.7 m, p < 0.001), VO 2max (3.6 vs 0.97 ml/kg/min, p = 0.04), right handgrip strength (4.7 vs 1.7 kg, p < 0.001), left handgrip strength (4.2 vs 2.2 kg, p = 0.04), and the curl-up (7.1 vs 3.6 repetitionsl, p = 0.01) and push-up (8.6 vs 3.6 repetitions, p < 0.01) performances. However, there was no significant difference in the isometric strength and any of the domains in SF-36. In addition, more than 80% of the patients in both groups had resumed work duties after the 6-week program. Table 3 shows the predictors (covariates) of physical fitness outcomes and domains in SF-36. The group variable was shown to have significant positive effects on 6-minute walk distance, predicted VO 2max , and deltoid and handgrip strengths, as well as on curl-up and push-up performances. In addition, sex, age, post SARS duration, and resumption to previous work also contributed in different degrees to physical functions outcomes and domains in SF-36. SARS survivors who experienced longer post-SARS duration, and hence a longer delay in starting an exercise program, demonstrated weaker left handgrip strength. Age showed negative correlation to certain domains of health-related quality of life, implying that younger patients showed better role physical (β = -0.69, p = 0.05), general health (β = -0.42, p = 0.02) and mental health (β = -0.32, p = 0.02) than older patients. In addition, patients who had already resumed duty experienced higher scores in physical functioning (p = 0.04), role physical (p = 0.003), role emotional (p = 0.01), social functioning (p = 0.003), general health (p = 0.02), mental health (p = 0.01) and vitality (p = 0.006) than those who had not returned to work as shown in the linear regression models depicted in Table 3 . Again, males performed better in VO 2max , left handgrip strength and role physical than females in both groups.
