From 2003 to December 2007, medical data of 1980 patients discharged from the hospital ICU were colleted. The average length of stay was 9.95 days, giving 19700 patient-days. Among these patients, 531 patients acquired a total of 1005 nosocomial infections, including 125 patients with two infections, 33 patients with three infections, 12 patients with four infections and one patient with five infections ( Table 1) . The overall patient nosocomial infection rate was 26.8%, ranging from 22.6% to 33.2% among the 5 years. There was a significant difference in the infection rates among the 5 years (χ 2 = 10.395, P = 0.035). The incidence density rate of nosocomial infections was 51.0 per 1000 patient days, ranging from 38.5 to 59.2 among the 5 years. The excess length of stay was 9.4 days, ranging from 3. Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) including bronchitis, tracheobronchitis and pneumonia, were the most common infections, occurring in 34.7% of the 1980 patients, followed by urine tract infections (UTIs) (8.1%), and bloodstream infections (BSIs) (3.0%). Among the 1005 nosocomial infections, LRTIs accounted for 68.4%, followed by UTIs (15.9%), BSIs (5.9%) and gastrointestinal tract infections (2.5%). Most (76.0%) patients with nosocomial LRTIs had received mechanical ventilation or tracheotomy before the infections, whereas 50.0% of nosocomial UTIs and 54.2% of nosocomial BSI were catheter associated (Table 1) . There is no significant change in LRTI, UTI and BSI rates during the 5 years. The GI infection rate was significantly decreased from 5.5% in 2003 to 0.4% in 2007 (χ 2 = 12.603, P = 0.012), whereas nosocomial infections in other sites was increased significantly (χ 2 = 12.858, P = 0.012). The nosocomial infection rates at the surgical sites and skin and soft tissues remained under 2% (Table 1) . Pathogens were isolated and identified from 530 (52.7%) of 1005 nosocomial infections, or, in 338 (63.7%) of the 531 patients. The isolated pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections differed among the infection sites ( Table 2 ). In patients with LRTIs, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequently isolated pathogens, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, accounting for more than half of the LRTI related pathogen population. In patients with UTIs, the fungi, especially Candida albicans, were the most com-mon pathogens, followed by Escherichia coli. Staphylococcus epidermidis, E. coli, and S. aureus were the first three most common pathogens for BSIs. In addition, A. baumannii was commonly isolated in UTIs and BSIs (Table 2) . Data on susceptibility testing were available for 3328 isolates, including 195 isolates of E. coli, 359 isolates of S. aureus, and 549 isolates of P. aeruginosa. Overall, 79.3%, 80.0%, 82.3% and 77.8% of E. coli isolates were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) and ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, respectively. All S. aureus isolates were sensitive to vancomycin, but 24.0%, 37.9%, 68.1% and 89.6% of isolates were resistant to nitrofurantoin, TMP/SMX, rifampin and ciprofloxacin, respectively. In addition, 93.1%, 41.3% and 66.9% of P. aeruginosa were resistant to TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, respectively [see Additional file 2]. All patients with nosocomial infections were treated with empirical antimicrobial therapies or according to the antimicrobial susceptibility test results, when available. The
