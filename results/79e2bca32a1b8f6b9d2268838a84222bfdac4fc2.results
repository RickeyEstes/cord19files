From January 2010-December 2013, there were 62 outbreaks involving 389 confirmed and 311 suspected HAIs in residents. During this study period, there were 8 confirmed and 242 suspected infections among staff members. Most outbreaks were respiratory infections (n ¼ 46) followed by gastrointestinal (n ¼ 9), blood (n ¼ 6), and skin or soft tissue (n ¼ 1) infections. The etiology of the NORA-reported outbreaks is described in Table 1 . During the study period, 121 (36%) residents were transferred to acute care as a result of their infections, and no staff were transferred to acute care. Of the residents transferred to acute care, 101 (83%) were related to a respiratory infection outbreak, 14 (12%) were related to a gastrointestinal infection outbreak, and 6 (5%) were related to a bloodstream infection outbreak. Three residents expired: 1 had human metapneumovirus and 2 had respiratory syncytial virus. Infection control interventions and practices implemented in response to the outbreaks were available for 51 (82%) reported outbreaks and are described in Table 2 .
