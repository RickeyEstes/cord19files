We employed a previously described vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudotyping system to study MERS-S-driven host cell entry (Kleine-Weber et al., 2018 known to adequately model key aspects of the coronavirus entry process. In order to study host cell entry driven by S proteins from the C1 subclade, we employed PCR-based mutagenesis to generate expression constructs for the S proteins of MERS-CoV from Morocco (camel/Morocco/CIRAD-HKU213/2015, MO), Nigeria (camel/Nigeria/NV1657/ 2016, NI) and Burkina Faso (camel/Burkina Faso/CIRAD-HKU785/ 2015, BF), using a published expression construct for MERS-CoV EMC S protein as template (Kleine-Weber et al., 2018 . Moreover, expression constructs for all S proteins were generated that encoded a Cterminal V5 antigenic tag. Western blot analysis of cells transfected to express the S proteins under study revealed that MERS-S EMC, MO, NI and BF were expressed and proteolytically processed to comparable levels ( Fig. 1B) . Moreover, these S proteins were incorporated into VSV particles with similar efficiency (Fig. 1C) . These results suggest that mutations present in North-and West-African MERS-S of the C1 subclade do not reduce S protein expression and proteolytic processing in human cells. We next asked whether DPP4 binding of North-and West-African MERS-S was altered. For this, 293T cells transfected to express the S proteins under study were incubated with soluble DPP4 fused to the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin and binding was quantified by flow cytometry, as described previously (Kleine-Weber et al., 2019). The results showed that MERS-S EMC, MO, NI, and BF bound to DPP4 robustly and with comparable efficiency while DPP4 binding to cells expressing no S protein was within the background range (Fig. 2 ). Finally, we tested whether the robust binding to DPP4 translated into efficient S protein-driven entry. For this, cell lines were selected that were shown to express low levels (293T), intermediate levels (Vero 76) or high levels of DPP4 (Caco-2, 293T + DPP4) (Kleine-Weber et al., 2019). MERS-S MO, NI and BF mediated entry into all cell lines with at least the same efficiency as MERS-S EMC (Fig. 3) . Moreover, under conditions of low or medium DPP4 expression, entry mediated by MERS-S MO and BF was even more efficient than entry mediated by MERS-S EMC (Fig. 3 ), although these differences were not statistically significant.
