The IFNG +874A/T genotype and allele frequencies for Chagas patients and healthy controls as well as for cardiac and asymptomatic patients are listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The genotype frequencies of the polymorphism studied were not found to be significantly different from those predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among healthy controls or patients. To ensure the absence of population substructure we estimated the Fst using approximately 40 different markers to IFN-g, we found that the population from this region is a homogeneous mixture and there is not concentration of ethnical groups (Fst 0.0013). We found a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the A/A genotype (low production of IFN-g) and the A allele at the IFNG polymorphism between Chagas patient and control groups. These findings suggest a genetic influence of this polymorphism on T. cruzi infection susceptibility. The A/A genotype among individuals with the IFNG +874A/T polymorphism was significantly more prevalent in Chagas patients than in controls (P = 0.005; OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.50-2.51) ( Table 1 ). In addition, the IFNG A allele showed evidence of association with Chagas disease (P = 0.003; OR = 1.46, 95% CI, 1.13-1.89). To investigate the possible influence of the IFNG +874A/T polymorphism on the development of cardiomyopathy, IFNG genotype and allele frequencies between asymptomatic patients and those with chagasic cardiomyopathy were compared. No significant difference was observed in the distribution of alleles or genotypes of the IFNG +874A/T polymorphism among cardiac and asymptomatic individuals, indicating no influence of this polymorphism on Chagas disease progression (Table 2) .
