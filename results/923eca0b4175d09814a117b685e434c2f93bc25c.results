Serum samples from 1243 animals belonging to 26 dairy cattle herds were taken and tested by VNT, in which 988 (79.5%) were seropositive to BRSV. Regarding the age group, 87% (767/ 891) of the serum samples were positives for adult animals while the prevalence rate in calves was 62.8% (352/221). Antibodies to BRSV were detected in all cattle herds, with prevalence rates ranging from 40 to 100%. The mean antibody titers for adult animals was 2 to 512, and for calves, 2 to 32. Therefore, prevalence of BRSV both in herds and animals was considered high. The chi-square test showed association of BRSV seropositivity with "age group" and animals tested seropositives to BoHV-1 and BVDV-1 (Table 2 ). Nevertheless, the Fisher's exact test only detected statistical difference with the variable "type of calves feeding" (Table 3 ). In this case, the relative risk (RR) value was less than one, i.e., the factor "natural suckling" was considered protective. Logistic regression (values of p < 0.2, two-tailed Fisher) did not show significant results, suggesting that the variables analyzed were not risk factors for the high seroprevalence of BRSV in the studied population.
