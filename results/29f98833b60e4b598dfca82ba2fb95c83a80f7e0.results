The MHV N NTD specifically binds to the TRS RNA with high affinity Since it is known that N plays an important role in sgRNA synthesis 31 and can be crosslinked to the 5′ leader RNA in infected cells, 15, 32 we hypothesized that N makes a high affinity interaction with the TRS, a highly conserved hexanucleotide sequence (Fig. 1) . To test this, we measured the binding affinity of a 5′ fluorescein (F)-labeled decanucleotide corresponding to the MHV TRS (F-5′-gAAU-CUAAAC) with N219, an N domain protein fragment containing the folded NTD and the immediately adjacent intact SR-rich region (residues 60-219; Fig. S1 ), by fluorescence anisotropy. These data reveal that the N219-TRS complex is characterized by a K obs = 9.0 × 10 7 M -1 at 150 mM K + , 25°C ( Fig. 1 , Table 1 ). To address the nucleotide specificity of NTD, we carried out fluorescence anisotropybased RNA competition experiments with unlabeled mutant TRS RNAs ( Fig. 1c ; Table 1 ). Essentially all mutations in the TRS result in a decrease in K obs , with a random RNA of the same length binding 53-fold less tightly. Substitution of 65 UCU 67 with 65 GAG 67 (TRS-Y3r) results in a modest ≈2-fold decrease in K obs whereas complete replacement of the 68 AAA 70 sequence with 68 CUU 70 (TRS-R3y) results in a 20-fold decrease. Combining these two blocks of mutations into the same RNA (TRS-YR) suggests that these two effects are not additive (ΔG c = -1.1 kcal mol -1 ), thus revealing that the 68 AAA 70 to 68 CUU 70 substitution is globally destabilizing to the interface. Finally, the complementary TRS sequence, 5′-AGUUUAGAUU (cTRS), adheres exactly to the 5′-RRYYYRRRYY motif present in the TRS; consistent with this, the affinity of N219 for a cTRS labeled with the rhodamine derivative, DY547, gives K obs = 9.1 × 10 7 M -1 (Table 1) . These data taken collectively reveal that the MHV NTD forms a specific, high affinity complex with both the TRS and cTRS RNA sequences that would be present in the leader and body TRSs and the nascent minus-strand RNA transcript, respectively, during sgRNA transcription. Analysis of RNAs harboring successive 1-to 5nucleotide deletions from the 5′ end of the TRS RNA decanucleotide suggest that these nucleotides upstream of the 68 AAA 70 motif provide electrostatic stabilization to the complex, with ΔΔG obs per loss of successive phosphate groups as anticipated from a simple polyelectrolyte binding model 33 ( Fig. 2 and Table S2 ). The SR-rich region does not engage in specific interactions with the TRS RNA Previous studies suggested that the SR-rich region provides most of the binding determinants for the specific interaction with the leader RNA in MHV. 15 To investigate the contribution of the SR-rich region in TRS binding, we determined the affinity of N197, an NTD construct lacking the SR-rich region (residues 60-197; Fig. S1 ) (Fig. 1b) , for TRS RNA (K obs = 1.9 ± 0.1 × 10 7 M -1 ; Table 1 ). N197 makes a high affinity complex with TRS, but one characterized by an approximately 5-fold decrease when 40 The 3′ most ten nucleotides containing the conserved hexanucleotide core TRS sequence (red) was used for binding assays.

The solid lines represent best fits to a one site (N219 and N197) or two site (CTD) binding model (fitting models (1) and (3), respectively, Materials and Methods). (c) Dissociation of an N219-5′-F-TRS complex by unlabeled mutant TRS RNAs as monitored by anisotropy. RNA competitors are unlabeled TRS (black), TRS-A69u (red), TRS-Y3r (cyan); TRS-A68u (magenta), TRS-A70u (green); TRS-R3y, (blue); random 9mer (yellow). The continuous lines through the data are defined by the binding parameters obtained by analysis using fitting model (2) (Materials and Methods) and are compiled in Table 1. compared to N219; this suggests that the nucleobase-specific interactions are contained entirely within the NTD. The increase in binding affinity is likely due to the presence of five additional positive charges from the SR-rich region, contributing a larger electrostatic component to the binding energy in N219 vs. N197. To test this, standard "salt-back" dissociation experiments were carried out to obtain information on the extent to which electrostatic interactions stabilize the NTD-TRS complex. 34, 35 SK obs , the dependence of K obs on [K + ], for the N219-TRS interaction is large (SK obs = -5.5), consis- Table S2 for fitted parameters). (b) A linear dependence of all three state functions, ΔG obs , ΔH obs , and ΔS obs is observed on the length of the 5′-hydroxylated TRS, with ΔΔG obs , ΔΔH obs , and Δ(-TΔS obs ) of -0.8, -3.8 and +3.0 kcal mol -1 per nucleotide (or phosphodiester) deletion, respectively. The fact that nucleotide substitutions of the same 5′ bases are far less destabilizing (see Table 1 ), coupled with the same energetics penalty for loss of successive nucleotides (or -1 charge) from the chain strongly suggests that this region of the TRS stabilizes the N219 complex electrostatically, with the core 68 AAA 70 motif providing significant nonelectrostatic stabilization to the complex. tent with 7-8 ionic interactions in the complex for the RNA binding ( Fig. S2) , with 55% of the total binding free energy at 0.15 M K + contributed by the polyelectrolyte effect. In contrast, the SK obs of N197 is smaller, -3.9, with the polyelectrolyte contribution only ≈40% under these conditions. Thus, in this simplified polyelectrolyte model, N219 engages in 2-3 additional electrostatic interactions with the RNA, likely contributed by a subset of the C-terminal Arg residues in N219 vs. N197.
