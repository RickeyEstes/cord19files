The preliminary survey indicated that the six zoos treated over 10,000 wildlife cases in a year ( Table 1 ). All six selected zoos agreed to participate in the pilot project and the zoo veterinarians commenced entering data directly into the eWHIS database from November 2010. Sixteen zoo veterinarians participated for some or all of the pilot project period. A total of 211 events that occurred during the 12-month pilot project were reported into eWHIS by the participating zoos. This represented almost a third of all cases submitted to eWHIS during that period from all sources including state and territory departments of agriculture and human health, university researchers and private veterinary practitioners. A small subset of the cases presented to the zoo veterinary hospitals met the agreed criteria for data entry into eWHIS ( Table 2 ). This subset was between 1 and 8% of all cases for individual zoos and approximately 2% for the six zoos overall. Examples of disease events reported for each of the categories are provided in Table 3 . A wide range of wildlife species was represented by the data collected during the pilot project. Accurate taxonomic identification of the animals under investigation was possible due to the expertise of the participating zoo veterinarians. The 211 disease events reported for the period from November 2010 to October 2011 covered 52 different species from 31 families and included birds (12 orders), turtles, marsupials, monotremes, marine mammals and bats ( Table 4 ). The pilot project increased the overall species coverage of the data collected in eWHIS, with 18 species (9 bird, 7 mammal and 2 reptile species) reported through the pilot project that were not reported from other sources during the same period. A number of events reported through the pilot project came from geographic areas not represented by other sources. The project captured data on diseases with potential human health implications, including confirmed or highly suspicious cases of salmonellosis, avian chlamydiosis (Chlamydophila psittaci), Australian bat lyssavirus in bats, mycobacteriosis (unspeciated) in a koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), and cryptosporidiosis in a hand-raised macropod. The cases of salmonellosis occurred in a variety of birds, marsupials and reptiles, and typing of these isolates contributed to the National Enteric Pathogens Surveillance Scheme [31] . Multiple cases of neurological signs in tawny frogmouths (Podargus strigoides) in urban areas of Sydney were of interest as this species has been suggested as a sentinel for the emerging zoonosis angiostrongylosis [32] , [33] . Of the records entered in eWHIS through the pilot project, 73% were categorised by the submitter as 'interesting or unusual', a grouping designed to capture information on possible emerging syndromes and trends. As an example, 14 cases of neoplasia were reported. Cancers have been recognised as emerging diseases of wildlife with potentially serious impacts, including Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease [11] and fibropapillomatosis of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) [34] . Additionally, cancer clusters in wildlife due to environmental causes such as chemical contamination can act as sentinels for risk to human health [35] , [36] . Cases were also reported of recognised syndromes where the cause has not been fully identified, such as non-suppurative encephalitis in corvids and paralysis in rainbow lorikeets (Trichoglossus haematodus). This information could contribute to a better understanding of syndromes with unknown aetiology. Cases in threatened species were reported, including the endangered Carnaby's black-cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) and loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) and a number of vulnerable species (Table 5 ) [37] , some of which were not represented in data captured from other sources for the same period. Data were collected on cases of psittacine circoviral (beak and feather) disease, which is listed as a key threatening process in endangered psittacine species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999 [38] . Also reported was a diabetes syndrome affecting koalas in care that could impact on the rehabilitation success of koalas in Queensland, a species now listed as vulnerable under the EPBC Act 1999 [37] . The first two confirmed clinical cases of chlamydiosis in koalas in South Australia were reported to the AWHN through the pilot project [39] . The South Australian koala population was thought to be free of Chlamydia [40] , so these reports may be an indicator of an emerging disease in the South Australian koala population. The project provided a framework for improved data capture for monitoring programs. For example, the AWHN holds responsibility for collating, moderating and maintaining a national dataset of bats tested for ABLV, and the pilot project resulted in the capture of more detailed information on the history and clinical signs of bats for this dataset. The project framework assisted the management of a disease outbreak in 2011. A strain of avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV1) not previously reported in Australia was detected in hobby pigeons in the Melbourne area in Victoria, and the virus was subsequently detected in free-living feral rock doves (Columba livia) and a spotted turtle dove (Streptopelia chinensis), and in a native collared sparrow hawk (Accipiter cirrocephalus) [41] , [42] . The project provided a mechanism to update zoo veterinarians about the outbreak, highlighted the possible involvement of native pigeons and raptors, and most likely resulted in increased submission of free-ranging sick and dead birds to the Victorian Department of Primary Industries for testing. A number of notifications of other disease events and outbreaks of relevance to wildlife were disseminated through the project, including a cluster of Hendra virus cases in horses in New South Wales and Queensland [43] , and neurological disease in horses due to arboviruses in New South Wales [44] in 2011. Information reported into eWHIS by the participants contributed to Australia's reports to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Australia, as a contributor to the OIE, regularly reports on the country's animal health status, which is important to ensure that Australia's health status for animals and animal products is well recognised internationally [45] . The independent review found that the pilot project increased the volume of cases and expanded the sources of data being entered into the national database [46] . According to the review, the project resulted in increased geographic and taxonomic coverage of the wildlife population, with data collected from additional 'catchment' areas and an increased species distribution, as well as a wider range of presenting syndromes and reporting reasons. The review concluded from these outcomes that the pilot project enhanced the capacity of the national wildlife health information system for early detection of disease and improved the sensitivity for demonstration of freedom from disease. The survey of zoo participants found that most considered their institution had benefited from the pilot project. Participants Table 3 . Examples of disease events captured for each reporting category (see Table 2 ). reported that the project provided additional focus for the zoos to investigate wildlife diseases; resulted in better recognition of their contribution to wildlife health; and improved collaboration, connection and communication with other institutions and organisations. It also contributed to a better understanding of the wider context of wildlife disease events, and assisted in identifying patterns in these events by providing a forum to share information on similar syndromes from different locations. The majority of participants agreed that participation in the project increased their awareness and understanding of diseases of national concern. The review identified some limitations of the program, including the clustering of cases around major population centres, and the collection of only a small proportion of the total caseload of the participating zoo wildlife hospitals. The reviewers concluded that there was value in the project to both the stakeholders and the participants, and that it was sustainable. They recommended the program be continued and expanded to include more zoos in order to increase the coverage and volume of data collected and to build on the improved capacity for early detection of wildlife disease. Factors recommended for consideration in the selection of additional zoos included geographic location and the 'catchment' area of wildlife covered by the zoo, veterinary presence, caseload, nature of cases, and availability of resources for data entry.
