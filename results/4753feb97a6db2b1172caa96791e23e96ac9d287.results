A total of 63 dogs were enrolled in the study and 60 dogs successfully completed the study, divided equally among all three treatment groups. Three dogs were withdrawn and not included in the final analysis due to either a significant parasite burden (n = 1, metronidazole group) or failure of owners to give the assigned study treatment (n = 2, one each in probiotic and placebo group). Group comparisons are summarized in Table 1 , and no differences were detected between groups for any hematological or biochemical analyte (p = 0.12-0.74). Dogs presenting with acute diarrhea achieved acceptable fecal consistency after 3.5 ± 2.2 days when receiving probiotic, 4.6 ± 2.4 days with metronidazole, and 4.8 ± 2.9 days with placebo (p = 0.17). The mean metronidazole dose was 17.8 ± 4.6 mg/kg (range: 11.2-24.0 mg/kg) twice daily. All dogs were treated on an outpatient basis with no hospitalization time >12 h. No adverse effects in any treatment group were noted, and no dogs required rescue treatment with tylosin. The linear regression identified a history of previous diarrhea episodes (β = 1.

C. perfringens alpha toxin gene (CPA), C. perfringens enterotoxin gene (CPE), and C. perfringens netEF gene (CPnetEF) were detected in a number of patients (Table 1) , with a mean gene quantity of 4.9 × 10 6 , 4.2 × 10 6 , and 12.8 × 10 6 copies with a maximum of 83 × 10 6 , 31 × 10 6 , and 93 × 10 6 , respectively. These values represent 57.1% (n = 20), 22.8% (n = 8), and 31.4% (n = 11), respectively, of sample tests above the cut-off suggested by the test provider for an association with diarrhea. All dogs positive for CPE or CPnetEF were also positive for CPA. No dogs were positive for Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile toxin A/B, canine distemper virus (CDV), canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV), canine parvovirus 2 (CPV-2), Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., or Salmonella spp. Forty percent of owners responded to requests for long-term follow-up (n = 24) following study completion. Diarrhea was reported in the follow-up period in 33.3% of dogs for which information was available (Table 1, n = 8). There was substantial deterioration of the probiotic product over time which was not reported by the manufacturer to the study authors until study completion. There were 70 billion CFU per capsule when the study was initiated. Laboratory analysis by the manufacturer after 8 months of storage, at which time half of dogs were enrolled in the probiotic group, revealed a concentration of 6 billion CFU, and no detectable viable colonies after 18 months of storage. However, there was no significant difference in the time to formed feces between the first half (3.6 ± 2.9 days) and second half (3.3 ± 1.4 days) of dogs enrolled in the probiotic group (p = 0.84).
