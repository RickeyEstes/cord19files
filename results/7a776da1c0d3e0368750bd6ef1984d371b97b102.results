As an epidemic progresses, the cumulative number of cases increases, and therefore the number of asymptomatic cases exported from a source area increases for all travel patterns (Figure 2 ). If a SARS-like epidemic is seeded in the group of frequent fl iers, then the initial rate of international spread is accelerated relative to the rate for the homogeneous case ( Figure 2, panel A, open symbols) . If the frequent travelers contract the infection early, more exclusivity of mixing (smaller φ) serves to speed international spread, and this effect may last well into the epidemic (Figure 2, panel A, open triangles) . If the epidemic is initiated in the low-frequency fl iers, the mean number of exported cases is similar to results of the homogeneous model (Figure 2, panel A, closed symbols) . Heterogeneities in travel patterns increase the variability between simulated epidemics; higher variability results from more assortative mixing (Table 2 ; online Appendix Figure 1 , available from www. cdc.gov/EID/content/13/9/1288-appG1.htm). In an outbreak in which the infection spreads rapidly, such as could potentially occur with pandemic infl uenza A (Figure 2, panel B) , heterogeneities in travel patterns have less effect on the rate of exportation of cases early in the epidemic than they would for SARS (Figure 2 , panel A), particularly after the fi rst weeks of the epidemic. The overall pattern of the exportation of cases is similar for SARS and infl uenza, but the time scale for infl uenza is much shorter because of the short doubling time (Table 1) . For example, the number of exported cases is in the thousands for infl uenza by day 50 (Figure 2, panel B) , when it is <20 for SARS (Figure 2, panel A) . Later in an epidemic, the mean number of exported cases is similar, regardless of where the epidemic is seeded or the mixing patterns of the high-frequency fl iers and low-frequency fl iers (Figure 2, panel B , inset for infl uenza, not shown for SARS). The variability between simulated epidemics becomes large, with some simulations resulting in hundreds of exported cases and many resulting in only a few exported cases (Table 2; Heterogeneities in travel patterns increase the number of exported cases to a greater extent and for a longer period if the relative frequency of fl ying of the high-frequency fl i-ers, f, is higher or if the proportion of the population who are high-frequency fl iers, r, is smaller (online Appendix Figure  2 , available from www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/9/1288-appG2.htm) because the probability that any frequent fl ier will fl y per day is higher (Table 1, ε H ) . However, if r becomes small, the epidemic among this group peaks and then decreases quickly because of the limited number in the group. In this case, the period in which there are enough infected persons in this group who can contribute to an increased rate of spread of exportation of cases is short (online Appendix Figure 2, panel B) . Table 1 ). Results are shown for a population in which everyone travels equally frequently (homogeneous model, circles), for a population in which 1% travel 20 times more frequently than the rest of the population, and for the 2 populations mixing randomly (φ = 1, squares), for moderate levels of mixing between the groups (φ = 0.5, diamonds), and for low levels of mixing in which most contacts are assortative (φ = 0.25, triangles). The fi rst cases are either in the majority population of low-frequency fl iers (solid symbols) or high-frequency fl iers (open symbols). Inset in B shows a greater range on the y-axis. Variability about these means is shown in Table 2 and online Appendix Figure 1 .
