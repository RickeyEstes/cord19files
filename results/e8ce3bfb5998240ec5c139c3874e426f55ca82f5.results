Of the sample of 366 texts retrieved in the database search, 120 were selected for further indepth analysis. This sub-set was further divided into topic clusters summarised in Table 2 . Table 2 indicates that the issue receiving the greatest coverage was bovine TB. Twenty-one articles covered bovine TB control measures in cattle and deer herds, while the role of possums in transmission was also frequently discussed (n Â¼ 13). Anxiety about the effects on the ecosystem and human health of 1080 poison (monofluroacetate), which is used to control possums, was an important theme. Other topics within this category include coverage of four bovine TB outbreaks throughout the country, vaccine developments and analysis of bovine TB rates. Newspaper coverage of this issue tended to focus predominantly on the perspectives of industry regulators, bovine TB control funding bodies and the activities and experiences of farmers. The second most frequent topic area was coverage of human TB cases that occurred during the sample period. Cases occurred throughout the country and included locations across both islands and in major cities (e.g. Wellington) as well as in predominantly rural regions (e.g. Northland). Significantly, cases tended to be reported by occupation and residency status. While other individual characteristics of those with TB were left unmentioned, occupational status tended to be emphasised, and, in many cases, formed the sole basis of identification within the headline. Occupations included dental therapist, student, meat worker, nurse and mill worker. The greatest coverage was afforded to cases in which the individual was working within a health care setting. Within this category the voice of public health officials tended to dominate, either reassuring readers about the nature of the TB cases or urging greater action. The third most frequent type of article discussing TB was related to immigration. This category is highly influenced by political discourses operating at the time of publication and tended to focus on changes in health screening/testing requirements for immigrants entering New Zealand. Other issues included concern over the comprehensiveness of health screening for asylum seekers, concern over Asian students and the general prevalence of TB among 'migrants'. These 'stories' were generally assembled by political reporters and Members of Parliament tended to be the most frequent contributors of commentary.
