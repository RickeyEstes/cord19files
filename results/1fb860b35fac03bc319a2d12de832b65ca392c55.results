Characterization of neutralizing mAb 7D10 targeting the NTD. To generate MERS-CoV neutralizing mAbs with epitopes outside the RBD, mice were immunized with recombinant MERS-CoV S protein (residues 1-1297). Subsequently, the spleenocytes were harvested and fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells, and the hybridoma cell lines were screened for positive clones by ELISA with the S protein 27 . The positive clones were further tested for their reactivity to different S fragments, including the S1 subunit NTD (residues 18-353), RBD (residues 367-606), and the S2 subunit (residues 726-1297). One NTD-specific mAb, named as 7D10, was finally isolated with an EC 50 of approximately 0.31 μg mL −1 in ELISA (Fig. 1a) . It exhibited no crossreactivity with the RBD at a concentration of 4 μg mL −1 (Fig. 1b) . We further assessed the potential of 7D10, in the form of crude extracts from mouse ascites, for inhibiting MERS-CoV entry into susceptible Huh7 cells and Vero E6 cells with either pseudotyped or infectious viruses. As expected, 7D10 was able to neutralize the infectivity of pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV (Fig. 1c, d) . The neutralizing activity of 7D10 was dose-dependent, with an IC 50 of approximately 0.18 μg mL −1 against pseudotyped virus and practically the same IC 50 of approximately 0.2 μg mL −1 against live virus (EMC strain) (Fig. 1c, d) . Images illustrating the reduced PFU formation, corresponding to the rate of neutralization of live MERS-CoV, are shown in Fig. 1e . Antibody isotyping showed that 7D10 belongs to the IgG1 subtype. Sequencing further determined that the heavy chain germline V and J segments are IGHV1-12*01 and IGHJ2*03, while those of light chain are IGKV03-12*01, IGKJ1*01, and IGKJ1*02, respectively (Supplementary Table 1) . We also generated a chimeric version of 7D10 (7D10-H) by combining the V segments of 7D10 with the human IgG1 backbone, which was efficiently expressed and purified in FreeStyle 293-F cells ( Supplementary Fig. 1A ). The bio-layer interferometry (BLI) experiment showed that the affinity constant of the binding between 7D10-H and NTD was approximately 25 nM (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1B) . The IC 50 of the purified 7D10-H against cell entry by pseudotyped MERS-CoV was approximately 0.06 μg mL −1 (Supplementary Fig. 1C ). We also investigated the protective efficacy of 7D10-H against infection of pseudotyped MERS-CoV using R26-hDPP4 mice model with a human DPP4 inserted into the Rosa26 locus by CRISPR/Cas9, which could also been productively infected by high-titer MERS-CoV pseudovirus, with effects comparable to the authentic infection 28 . Bioluminescence of the Fluc reporter showed that the pseudovirus infection in the mice was clearly prevented by 7D10-H and RBD-specific mAb MERS-4 when both antibodies were administered by the intraperitoneal injection with a dose of 200 μg per mouse ( Supplementary Fig. 1D ). The recombinant chimeric 7D10-H, which retained the activities as the mouse 7D10 and protected R26-hDPP4 mice against challenge of pseudotyped MERS-CoV, was utilized in subsequent binding and neutralization experiments. Overall structure of the 7D10 scFv bound to the NTD. To structurally characterize the 7D10 and its binding to the spike protein, we determined the crystal structure of the antibody scFv (7D10-scFv) in complex with the NTD at a resolution of 3.0 Å with a final R work of 0.188 and R free of 0.224. Statistics of diffraction data collection, processing, and structure refinement are listed in Table 2 . There were three complexes of 7D10-scFv bound to NTD per asymmetric unit. The refined model contains residues Tyr18 to Ser353 of MERS-CoV NTD, Glu1 to Ser120 of the V H and Asp26 to Lys136 of the V L . N-linked glycans attached to Asn66, Asn104, Asn125, Asn155, Asn166, Asn222, Asn236, and Asn244 of the NTD are also included in the model. It has been previously shown that the MERS-CoV NTD folds into a galectin-like structure, which can be separated into top, core and bottom subdomains (Fig. 2a) . Upon binding, the 7D10-scFv contacts the top subdomain of the NTD and the Asn222-linked glycans with its heavy and light chains ( Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). All three CDRs of the heavy chain and the CDR1 and CDR3 of the light chain participate in the binding (Fig. 2a) . The buried surface between the 7D10-scFv and the NTD encompasses approximately 551 Å 2 for the heavy chain and 320 Å 2 for the light chain. Structural features of the interface between 7D10 and NTD. The binding interface between 7D10-scFv and NTD consists of 12 residues and Asn222-linked glycans from the NTD, as well as 15 residues from all 6 CDRs except for LCDR2 (Fig. 2b, c) . The interacting residues from the NTD are Tyr18, Asp20, Pro23, Asp24, Val26, Ser28, Glu188, Ser191, Asn226, Lue234, Arg235, and Asn236. Together with the Asn22-linked NAG508, NAG509 and MAN519, they form the conformational epitope recognized by 7D10 (Fig. 2b) . The residues recognizing 7D10 are Ser31, Tyr32, Asn33 from the HCDR1, Tyr52, Asn55, and Ser59 from the HCDR2, Arg98, Tyr99, Asn101, Tyr102, and Tyr105 from the HCDR3, Tyr59, and Tyr61 from the LCDR1, and Arg121 and Asp122 from the LCDR3 (Fig. 2c) . Specifically, 7D10 HCDR1 residues Ser31, Tyr32, and Asn33 interact with Pro23 and Asp24 from the NTD, and a formed hydrogen bond is from 7D10 Asn33 to NTD Asp24 ( Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 2 Crystal structure of 7D10-scFv bound to NTD and the binding interface. a An overall structure of the NTD/7D10-scFv complex in which the NTD, N222-linked glycans on the NTD, 7D10 V L , and 7D10 V H are colored in blue, gray, magenta, and cyan, respectively. b Epitope on the NTD recognized by 7D10.

Tyr99 and Asn101 of 7D10 form two hydrogenbonding interactions with Asp24 of the NTD (Supplementary  Table 2 ). For the light chain, the LCDR1 and LCDR3 residues Tyr59, Tyr61, Arg121, and Asp122 interact with Glu188, Ser191, Arg235, and Asn236 of the NTD, and a salt bridge is formed between Arg121 of LCDR3 and Glu188 of the NTD (Fig. 2e and  Supplementary Table 2) . A prominent feature at the interface is the extensive recognition of Asn222-linked glycans by all three heavy chain CDRs ( Fig. 2f and Supplementary Table 3 ). Specific hydrogen-bonding interactions occur between Tyr58 and Arg98 of 7D10 and the NAG508 and MAN519 glycans, respectively ( Fig. 2f and Supplementary Table 2 ). Confirmation of the neutralizing epitope. To confirm the epitope and its critical residues, we performed a mutagenesis study by introducing single mutations to all 13 NTD recognized residues including Trp18, Asp20, Pro23, Asp24, Val26, Ser28, Glu188, Ser191, Asn222, Asn226, Lue234, Arg235, and Asn236. We first examined the effects of these NTD mutations on the binding by 7D10-H. The 7D10-H bound the wild-type NTD with an affinity of approximately 25 nM (Table 1 and Supplementary  Fig. 3 ). By contrast, the D24A and R235A mutations dramatically reduced the binding, to a level that was undetectable by BLI experiment (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The E188A and N222Q mutations reduced by the binding affinity by 148-fold to 3.7 μM and 112-fold to 2.8 μM, respectively (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). All the other nine mutations had variant unequal effects on the binding by reducing the affinity in the range of 2-to 15-fold (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The effects of these mutations on the neutralizing activity of 7D10-H were in consistent with the changes of binding affinity. Pseudotyped MERS-CoV bearing D24A, E188A, or R235A mutation in the spike glycoprotein escaped the neutralization by 7D10-H (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). The IC 50 values of 7D10 against pseudotyped MERS-CoV bearing D20A, V26A, or N222Q mutation were increased approximately by 60-, 181-, and 50-fold (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). The binding and neutralization assays collectively revealed that Asp24, Val26, Glu188, Arg235, and Asn222-linked glycans are critical for recognition and neutralization of MERS-CoV by 7D10.
