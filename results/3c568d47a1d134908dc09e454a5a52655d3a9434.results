We recorded on the whole 21 cases of ACS during the study period, on 338 hospitalizations of children with SCD, hence an in-patient prevalence of 6.2 %. Table 1 displays the study population's general profile. Ages ranged from 11 months to 16 years, with a mean of 5.5 (3.4) years, and males were more represented than females with a sex ratio of 3.2/1 (Tables 1 and 2 ). Only seven patients had a hemoglobin electrophoresis dating back to less than one year, HbS ranging from 55 % to 86 % with a mean of 75.1 (11.9) %, and HbF, from 6.4 % to 21.9 % with a mean of 14.6 (6.0) % (Table 2 ). Only 38.1 % of children were regularly followed-up, i.e. were used to visiting the unit for a check-up at least every 3 months. Besides, not more than 33.3 % of our patients had been adequately vaccinated in accordance with their ages, and only 3 children aged 0-5 years (27.3 %) were currently taking an antibiotic prophylaxis (Table 1) . According to our patients' parents, duration of evolution of symptoms before consultation ranged from less than 24 h to almost 14 days, with a mean of 4.8 (4.2) days. The presenting complaints are reported in Table 3 . The three main symptoms were fever (90.5 %), cough (81 %), and chest pains (28.6 %). The main clinical signs we observed were pulmonary consolidation (100 %), an altered general appearance (61.9 %), clinical signs of anemia (57.1 %), a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (57.1 %), and signs of respiratory distress (33.3 %). Two patients (9.5 %) who were initially admitted for vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) developed ACS after 2 days of hospitalization. Results of biological tests showed very high levels of leukocytes, neutrophils, serum CRP and serum LDH. Indeed, their mean values were 32479.4 (17862.3)/mm 3 , 23476 (11543.7)/mm 3 , 228.2 (132.6) mg/l, and 3452.3 (2916.3) IU/l respectively. Contrariwise, we observed relatively low levels of hemoglobin, with a mean of 6.5 (1.2) g/dl ( Table 2 ). The main localizations of radiological alveolar consolidations were the lower lobes (90.5 %). None of the 10 hemocultures performed was positive, and only one of the 15 thick blood smears performed to seek for malaria parasites was positive to Plasmodium species, specifically Plasmodium falciparum (6.7 %; Table 3 ). Patients were placed on two to three antibiotics: a betalactam (either ampicillin or ceftriaxone) + a macrolide (oral azithromycin) Â± an aminoglycoside (gentamicin) ( Table 4 ). Two days after the fever had dropped, patients were switched to oral cephalosporin (cefixim) or amoxicillin accordingly, for a total duration of 10 to 14 days (both intravenously and orally). Two patients (9.5 %) initially placed on ceftriaxone were still presenting fever on the fourth day of antibiotherapy; they were subsequently switched to vancomycin for seven days with a good improvement. Adjuvant therapy included hyperhydration (100 %), paracetamol (100 %) for fever or pains, tramadol (42.9 %) and ibuprofen (23.8 %). Fourteen patients (66.7 %) were transfused with whole blood, and all of them concurrently received an anti-malarial treatment to prevent transfusion-transmitted malaria. All the seven patients (33.3 %) who presented signs of respiratory distress were placed on oxygen, its duration ranging from 1 to 5 days with a mean of 3.6 (1.6) days (Tables 2, 3 and 4) . A control full blood count was performed only by seven of our patients 48 h after blood transfusion (Table 3) . We did not find any statistical difference between the first and second leukocyte counts (p = 0.711), this being the same for neutrophil counts (p = 0.811). By contrast, we did notice a significant increase in hemoglobinemia (p = 0.039). The duration of hospitalization ranged from 3 to 12 days with a mean of 6.8 (3.1) days. One patient of the female sex died on the fourth day of hospitalization, hence a mortality rate of 4.8 % (Tables 2 and 4 ). While investigating factors that could have impacted the duration of hospitalization, we found that age, sex, regular follow-up, immunization status, duration of evolution of symptoms prior to consultation, transfusion, oxygen, and the antibiotic used were not implicated in the determination of duration of hospitalization (all p values > 0.05 as depicted by Table 5 ).
