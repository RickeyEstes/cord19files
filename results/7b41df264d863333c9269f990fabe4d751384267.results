Twenty-two (2.5%) of the 878 stool specimens of children with acute gastroenteritis were positive for HCoVs. A HCoV as a single pathogen was detected in only four of the samples (18.2% of the positive samples). In the remaining cases either norovirus or rotavirus was detected in the same sample (Table 1 ). In eleven (50%) of the 22 coronavirus positive cases there were symptoms of respiratory tract infection at the same time with gastroenteritis, or respiratory symptoms had been present before symptoms of gastroenteritis. Three of the 4 patients with coronavirus as a single pathogen in stool sample had respiratory tract related symptoms. Patient 1 ( Table 1) had cough and rhinitis, and had just recovered from otitis media. Patient 7 (Table 1) did not have any respiratory tract symp- toms. Patient 11 (Table 1 ) had tonsillitis and patient 19 (Table 1) had headache and dizziness in addition to symptoms of respiratory tract infection. All non-SARS human coronavirus types were found, members of group 2A; OC43 (10 of the cases, 45.5%) and HKU1 (6 of the cases, 27.3%) were most common, whereas group 1B viruses 229E and NL63 were found only in 2 and 4 cases, respectively. No SARS or SARS-like viruses were found. Still there might be unknown coronaviruses that our PCR method did not detect in spite of the universal primers in the 1st PCR. Most HCoV positive cases were found from January to April (Fig. 1) . The age distribution of the coronavirus infected children was 9-75 months (median, 19.5 months), whereas in the total material the youngest child was 14 days and the oldest 14 years and 4 months (median, 17 months). Of the coronavirus positive children 59% were males. Within the control groups two (1.8%) of the 112 stool samples were positive for HCoV. One of the cases was a 3-year-old female with pneumonia. OC43 was detected as the only pathogen in her stool samples on February 2007. Two days after sample collection she also developed symptoms of gastroenteritis. The second patient was a healthy female aged 2 years and 11 months tested on July 2007. OC43 was again detected in a stool sample as a single pathogen.
