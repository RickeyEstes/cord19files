Overall, 75% of patients who had suspected SARS according to the WHO case definition were diagnosed as being infected with probable SARS-CoV, whereas 12% were diagnosed as having human metapneumovirus infection (table 2). The high proportion of patients diagnosed with human metapneumovirus infection could be attributed mainly to cohort 4, in which 36% of patients were positive for this infection. Without this cohort, the overall proportion of human metapneumovirus diagnoses decreased to 4%. Alternative diagnoses in patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV infection were influenza (five), M pneumoniae infection (one), and Legionella sp infection (one). Three macaques (1, 2, and 4) became lethargic from days 2-3 after infection onwards. Macaques 1 and 2 developed a temporary skin rash at day 4 after infection. Macaque 2 had respiratory distress, consisting of an increased respiratory rate and dyspnoa, from day 4 after infection onwards. Macaques 2-4 had multiple foci of pulmonary consolidation in both lungs. The consolidated lung tissue was grey-red, firm, level, and less buoyant than normal. The tracheobronchial lymph nodes and spleen in these macaques were about twice the normal size. The other organs in these three macaques, as well as the respiratory tract and other organs of macaque 1 were normal on microscopic inspection. The main lesion in the consolidated pulmonary tissue of macaques 2-4 involved the alveoli and bronchioles, and consisted of areas with acute or more advanced phases of diffuse alveolar damage. In such areas the lumina of alveoli and bronchioles were variably filled with proteinrich oedema fluid, fibrin, erythrocytes, and cellular debris, a moderate number of alveolar macrophages, and fewer neutrophils and lymphocytes (figure 1). The cytoplasm of some of these macrophages contained erythrocytes or pools of oedema fluid. There was extensive loss of epithelium from alveolar and bronchiolar walls. In areas with more advanced diffuse alveolar damage, the alveolar walls were moderately thickened and lined by cuboidal epithelial cells (type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia), and the alveolar lumina contained mainly alveolar macrophages (figure 1). Regeneration of epithelium was seen in some bronchioles, visible as one irregular layer of squamous to high cuboidal epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. In some areas, the alveolar walls were lined by deep eosinophilic hyaline membranes (figure 1). There were occasional multinucleated giant cells (syncytia) in bronchioles and alveoli, either attached to the wall or free in the lumen (figure 1). These syncytia had up to about 30 peripheral nuclei, abundant hyaline eosinophilic cytoplasm, and, based on positive CD68 staining and negative pan-keratin staining, originated from marcophages. Enlarged type 2 pneumocytes with large vacuolated nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant vesicular cytoplasm were frequently found attached to the alveolar walls (figure 2). The epithelial origin of these cells was confirmed by keratin expression (figure 2). By contrast, alveolar macrophages had smaller nuclei, less prominent nucleoli, and were generally loose in the alveolar lumina (figure 2). The identity of these cells as macrophages was confirmed by CD68 staining (figure 2). Alveolar and bronchiolar walls were thickened by oedema fluid, mononuclear cells, and neutrophils. There were aggregates of lymphocytes around small pulmonary vessels. Moderate numbers of lymphocytes and macrophages were present in the lamina propria and submucosa of the bronchial walls, and a few neutrophils in the bronchial epithelium. Changes in other tissues of macaques 2-4 were diffuse lymphoid hyperplasia and sinus histiocytosis of the tracheobronchial lymph nodes. Macaques 2 and 3 also had diffuse intrafollicular hyalinosis of the spleen. There were minimum multifocal inflammatory lesions in the pulmonary tissue of macaque 1, consisting of increased numbers of alveolar macrophages (about ten per alveolus) and occasional syncytia in alveoli and bronchioles. With use of a biotinylated IgG fraction from a SARS patient, SARS-CoV expression was detected in a few to moderate numbers of alveolar epithelial cells (type 2 pneumocytes; figure 3 ) and rare intrabronchiolar and intra-alveolar syncytia ( Ultrastructurally, coronavirus-like particles measuring about 70 nm in diameter with typical internal nucleocapsid-like structure and club-shaped surface projections were found in enlarged alveolar epithelial cells (type 2 pneumocytes) of inflamed lung tissue from macaque 3. The particles were localised within smoothwalled vesicles, often closely associated with the Golgi apparatus ( figure 4) . The particles in inflamed lung tissue were similar in size and structure to coronavirus particles in Vero 118 cells infected with SARS-CoV ( figure 4) . The NP-specific RT-PCR was about 100-fold more sensitive than the polymerase-gene-based RT-PCR on the virus stock and the infected cell dilution series. The NP RT-PCR also was more sensitive based on detection of viral RNA in samples obtained from the SARS-CoVinfected macaques (data not shown). The macaques shed SARS-CoV from sputum, nose, and pharynx from 2 days after infection onwards (table 3) . SARS-CoV was isolated from the nasal and throat swabs from macaque 2 at 2 days after infection, from the throat swabs of macaque 4 at days 2, 4, and 6 after infection, and from sputum samples of macaque 4 at days 2 and 6 after infection. The virus titre in these samples was not measured. Several other clinical samples were positive only by RT-PCR (table 3) . By negative-contrast electron microscopy, coronavirus particles were seen in cell cultures obtained from nasal swabs (figure 4) and closely resembled those in the virus stock used to infect the macaques ( figure 4) . Virus was not detected in rectal swabs. SARS-CoV was isolated from the lung (1ϫ10 5 TCID 50 /g tissue) and kidney (1ϫ10 3 TCID 50 /g tissue) of macaque 2, and from the lung (1ϫ10 4 TCID 50 /g tissue) of macaque 4. No virus was isolated from the postmortem samples of macaques 1 or 3. Several other tissues were positive only by RT-PCR (table 4) . No macaque had detectable antibody to SARS-CoV by day 6 after infection. Virological examinations of nasal and pharyngeal swabs, and tracheal and lung samples from all four macaques by RT-PCR for influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, rhinovirus, coronavirus (OC43 and 229E) and human metapneumovirus were negative. No relevant pathogens were identified on bacteriological culture of lung and blood samples. The lung homogenates tested negative for Chlamydia sp and C pneumoniae by PCR.
