Twenty Asian adults (10 men, 10 women) with a mean age of 32.5 years (range 19 to 53 years) were recruited for the study. The mean subjective cycloplegic SE was À1.08 D in all eyes, with À1.26 D in the worst eye, and C0.90 D in the best eye. Of the 20 subjects, all of whom completed treatment, 16 were available for the 6-month follow-up visit and 11 returned for the 12-month visit; a major reason for the loss to follow-up related to the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis in Singapore that occurred during the course of the study. The SARS outbreak precluded study patients from returning to the clinic due to severe infection control and isolation restrictions on patient mobility between hospital institutions during this period.
