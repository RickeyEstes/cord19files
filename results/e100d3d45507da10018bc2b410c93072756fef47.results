Isolation and genome sequencing of mycobacteriophage Patience. Mycobacteriophage Patience was isolated by direct plating of an environmental sample taken from near the Nelson Mandela School of Medicine at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), Durban, South Africa, using M. smegmatis mc 2 155 as a host (3) . Isolation and purification of Patience were components of a 2-week workshop on mycobacterial genetics offered in July 2009; the genome was sequenced at the University of Pittsburgh and annotated in a second 2-week workshop at UKZN in July 2011. Patience forms normal-size hazy (~1-mm-diameter) plaques on M. smegmatis mc 2 155 at 37°C under standard conditions, although we have been unsuccessful in recovering stable lysogens. It can easily be propagated on solid media to titers greater than 10 10 PFU/ml. The genome is 70,506 bp long, circularly permuted, and presumably terminally redundant. For linear presentation, coordinate 1 is designated the beginning of an open reading frame upstream of the large terminase subunit consistent with the organization of the cluster H phages that contain homologues of the first open reading frame at their left ends (7) . The GenBank submission (JN412589) has been reported previously (3) . Genome annotation identified 109 putative open reading frames (ORFs) and one tRNA gene (Table 1) ; one additional ORF was annotated using mass spectrometry analysis (see below). Virion morphology and virion PAGE analysis. Mycobacteriophage Patience is morphologically a member of the Siphoviridae with an isometric head and a long flexible tail (Fig. 1A) . The diameter of the heads averages 58 nm, and the tails average 358 nm in length, among the longest of the mycobacteriophages described to date, similar to those of the cluster M phages (348 nm [8] ); other phages with notably long tails are those in cluster H (approximately 290 nm) and cluster R (approximately 288 nm) (13) . SDS-PAGE analysis of Patience particles shows three abundant proteins and at least 12 other lower-abundance proteins between the sizes of 15 and 150 kDa (Fig. 1B) . Relationship of Patience to other mycobacteriophages. The Patience genome is not closely related to other phage genomes, although dot plot analysis shows weak similarity to cluster H phages (Fig. 2) . The related segments span only 14%, 8%, and 6% of genome lengths with Barnyard, Predator, and Konstantine genomes, respectively (Fig. 2) , and the closest matching segment of Patience and Barnyard is a 1,091-bp region (73% nucleotide identity) corresponding to the capsid subunit genes. Alignment of the genome maps of Patience, Barnyard, Konstantine, and Predator in Phamerator shows their architectural relationships (Fig. 3) , and although the nucleotide sequence similarity is minimal, 37% of Patience genes have homologues in cluster H phages (Fig. 3) . However, more than half of the Patience ORFs are orphams (genes with no close mycobacteriophage relatives [ Fig. 3 ; Table 1 ]). The overall GC content of the Patience genome is 50.3% and is maintained almost throughout the genome (Fig. 4A ). There are two notable departures suggesting recent acquisitions by horizontal exchange. One is within Patience gene 37, where the 3= end has 81% nucleotide identity to Rosebush gene 32 (subcluster B2) and the elevated percent GC reflects that of the B2 phages (Fig. 4B ). Patience gp37 is related to tail fibers of many other mycobacteriophages that are implicated in host range determination (4). The second example is gene 47 (62% GC [ Fig. 4C ]), although it is an orpham with no close mycobacteriophage relatives and is of unknown function. Patience genome organization. Genome annotation of Patience indicates that all open reading frames and one tRNA gene are transcribed in the same direction ( Fig. 5 ; Table 1 ). The overall coding capacity is 94.9%, and there are no intergenic spaces greater than 250 bp. The recognizable virion structure and assembly functions lie within the gene 4 to 39 region, and the siphoviral syntenic arrangement of terminase, portal, protease, capsid, headtail connector proteins, major tail subunit, tail assembly chaperones, tape measure, and minor tail protein genes is observed, spanning 32 kbp of the genome (14) . This is atypically long not only because of the long tape measure gene corresponding to the long phage tail but because of a dozen genes of mostly unknown function located between the terminase large subunit (gene 6) and portal (gene 8) genes, between the portal (gene 8) and protease (gene 19) genes, and between the MuF-like gene (gene 20) and the putative scaffolding gene (gene 22) (Fig. 5) ; most of these are orphams (i.e., they do not have a close mycobacteriophage rela-tive), with the exceptions of genes 10 and 18 (Fig. 5 ). Gene 7 encodes a putative Endo VII protein and has weak similarity (Ͻ30% identity) to genes in phages Konstantine and Predator Table S1 in the supplemental material. (subcluster H1), as well as Dori (singleton). The gene upstream of the terminase large subunit gene encodes a protein with similarities to putative HNH homing nucleases ( Fig. 5 ) but may function as part of the DNA packaging machinery as described for HK97 gp74 (15) . The four leftmost genes (genes 1 to 4) are of unknown function. The lysis cassette is located downstream of the virion structural genes and contains an endolysin gene (gene 41, lysin A) and a putative mycolylarabinogalactan esterase (gene 42, lysin B) (16, 17) . Genes 43 and 44 code for proteins containing two and four predicted transmembrane domains, respectively, that may act as holins or lysis chaperones (18) . The lysis cassette is not closely related to that of the cluster H phages, and lysin A is most closely related to the corresponding genes of cluster M phage PegLeg gp35 and Bongo gp35 (35% identity), with an Org-U domain organization (19) . In contrast, lysin B is most closely related to phages in subcluster B3 (66% identity to Gadget gp48), illustrating the mosaic nature of the lysis cassette (19) . Patience gp43 has no homologues, but gp44 has distant relatives in the cluster D phages (Ͻ30% identity), where the genes are located between lysin A and lysin B. Of the other 65 Patience ORFs, only seven can be assigned putative functions, most of which are involved in DNA metabolism (helicases, RecA, DNA polymerase III [Pol III] alpha subunit, The three most abundant proteins likely correspond to the major tail subunit (gp31), the capsid subunit (gp23), and gp15, with predicted molecular masses of 30.5 kDa, 35.3 kDa (after processing), and 32 kDa, respectively. The major tail subunit may migrate slower than its predicted mass, as observed in some other phages (37) . Numbers at right are molecular masses in kilodaltons. Table 1 ]). These all have homologues in a variety of mycobacteriophages as well as in phages of Gordonia and Corynebacterium. One (gene 103) encodes a MazG-like protein, a putative nucleoside triphosphate pyro-phosphohydrolase that is common in a variety of phage genomes (20) . Patience has a single tRNA gene, and the tRNA is predicted to be charged with glutamine and has the anticodon 5=-UUG [i.e., tRNA Gln (UUG)]. It is unclear how the Patience genes are tran- (35) and the database Mycobacteriophage_285, containing 285 complete genome sequences, and aligned by the left ends of the tape measure gene. Maps are displayed in three tiers with pairwise nucleotide sequence similarities displayed in spectrum coloring, with violet being the most similar and red the least similar (minimal BLASTN cutoff E value is 10 Ϫ4 ). Genes are shown as colored boxes, with colors reflecting pham assignments for each gene (gene members of a phamily have the same color). Genes shown in white are orphams and have no mycobacteriophage relatives with greater than 32.5% amino acid identity or a BLASTP E value lower than 10 Ϫ50 . Phamily assignments with the number of phamily members in parentheses are above each gene. scribed, and there are no strongly predicted SigA-like promoters, similar to other mycobacteriophages such as Giles (21), even though SigA-like promoters are active in other mycobacteriophages (22) (23) (24) . Table S1 in the supplemental material). Using stringent criteria for peptide identification, we identified 79 of the 109 previously annotated predicted gene products (82 different gene products, including previously unannotated genes) present in at least one of the samples, including 34 of the 35 putative virion structure and assembly proteins (genes 5 to 39), 27 of which are particle associated (Fig. 5) . Although gp9 was not detected, particle-associated peptides corresponding to a previously unannotated 37-codon gene between genes 8 and 9 were identified, which we designate gene 111 (Fig. 5) . Particles contain four additional products, gp1, gp4, gp79, and gp86, although gp86 is abundant in lytic growth and the few particle-associated peptides could be contaminants in the phage preparation (Table S1 ). The capsid subunit (gp23) appears to be proteolytically cleaved between residues 82 and 83 to generate a 35.3-kDa mature protein product; that and the gp31 major tail subunit (30.5 kDa) and gp15 (32 kDa) likely correspond to the three major species observed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B) . It is noteworthy that-with the exception of 31-residue gp9 -all of the genes corresponding to insertions within the otherwise canonically syntenic virion structure and assembly operon are present in Patience particles, although only 3 spectra of gp21 were identified and could represent contaminants from the lysate (Fig. 5 ; Table S1). Of the total of 81 Patience proteins identified in infected cells, only one-gp47-was not identified in the late-infected (2.5-hpostinfection) sample. Patience gp47 was identified in the earlyinfected sample and is presumably not expressed late in infection but also is turned over rapidly ( Fig. 5 ; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material). Many of the virion proteins (genes 1 to 40) are expressed at higher levels (using peptide spectral count as a surrogate for expression) in the late-infected sample, although there is also substantial expression of many of these at the early time. Of the 29 annotated proteins not identified in any of the samples, 11 are predicted to be smaller than 10 kDa and may have escaped detection if they are not expressed at high levels. Twelve are predicted to be membrane or wall associated and are likely excluded from the soluble fractions used for analysis. Peptide abundance in infected cells is expected to generally correlate with expression, although other factors such as protein size and trypsin cleavage efficiencies influence peptide detection.
