Simulations of size 500 based on the p-variate standard normal distribution Np(0,I), and an empirically influenced p-variate normal distribution Np(µ, ) were performed to examine a range of outlier configurations. In addition, we assessed the performance of the multi-dimensional outlier detection method against the conventional method of using a Pearson's correlation coefficient [previously described in Section 2.1 as metric 1-Equation (1)] to ascertain whether a LC-MS run is an outlier. Simulation is useful to investigate the properties of rMd-PAV, however; since simulation of expected distribution parameters in real proteomics data is not well understood, these results are presented in Supplementary Material (Rocke et al., 2009) . The results of the multi-dimensional outlier detection analysis are displayed in a simple yet effective graphic in which rMd-PAV scores are plotted for each LC-MS run and compared with a reference line representing the χ 2 critical value. For improved visualization, the rMd-PAV scores and the χ 2 critical value are transformed to the log 2 scale. The red horizontal line represents the log 2 (χ 2 0.9999,5 ) critical value. That is, at a significance level of 0.0001, a LC-MS run may be classified as a statistical outlier if the calculated test statistic ≥ χ 2 0.9999,5 critical value, or equivalently, the χ 2 P ≤ 0.0001. LC-MS runs with log 2 (rMd-PAV) scores above the red horizontal line are suspect and should be removed from the dataset.
