The mean age of the 76 patients was 4.7 years (standard deviation, ±3.9 years). Respiratory microorganisms were detected in 74 (97%) of our patients. Viruses were found in 55 (72%) and bacteria in 69 (91%) of the studied children. Proportions of microbiological findings are shown in Fig. 1 . One child had six microorganisms (three bacteria and three viruses) simultaneously detected (Fig. 2 ) and, altogether, seven children had two or three bacteria with two or three viruses co-detected (Table 2) . RV, HBoV, HMPV, AdV, PIV3, coronaviruses and RSV were the most commonly detected viruses (Fig. 1) . Two viruses were detected in 17 (22%) of our patients and three viruses in six (8%). HBoV-RV was the most common combination of multiple viruses detected (six cases). Of HBoVpositive samples, 79% were also positive for other viruses. RSV and HMPV were most commonly found as sole viral agents (60% and 64%, respectively), whereas other viruses were found as sole viral agents in £44% of cases. Sequence analysis of 14 RV-positive samples revealed nine belonging to RV A species and five to RV C species. Of children <5 years of age, 80% had viruses detected. Of HBoV detections, 93% were in children <5 years of age. Eight of 11 HMPV detections were in children aged 2-5 years. The mean age of children with multiple viral findings was 2.6 years (standard deviation, ±1.6 years). Evidence of S. pneumoniae was found in 50% of our patients. Several cases of H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and S. aureus infection were also detected ( Fig. 1) . Thirty-six children were tested for serum IgM antibodies to M. pneumoniae, and seven (19%) of them had a positive result (these findings are excluded from our statistics, because this test was performed in only 47% of our study population). By multiplex PCR, the presence of bacteria was shown in ten (71%) of 14 patients with initially negative culture results. S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis were the most commonly co-detected bacteria (12 cases), and the most commonly found combination of viruses and bacteria was RV-S. pneumoniae (12 cases). Of the 38 patients with S. pneumoniae in their sputum, 25 (66%) had a concomitant viral detection ( Table 2 ). In 34 (45%) of the studied children, sputum samples were collected after the onset of intravenous antibiotic treatment. No significant difference in the clinical picture of pneumonia was found, whether it was associated with viruses, bacteria or both (Table 3) . Children with interstitial infiltration (14%) on the chest radiograph had evidence of a sole viral or mixed viral-bacterial infection, but not of a sole bacterial infection. Our data did not show any clinical correlation between the clinical picture of pneumonia (the white blood cell count and the serum C-reactive protein level on admission, the highest fever during stay at hospital, and duration of fever ‡38°C) and whether one or multiple viruses caused it. Mixed viral-bacterial detections including S. pneumoniae with one or more viruses were associated with higher white blood cell counts on admission than H. influenzae with one or more viruses (p 0.001) ( Table 3) . Other significant clinical distinctions between different concomitantly detected microorganisms were not found. All of the six children (8%) with treatment failure (fever ‡38°C lasting for ‡48 h regardless of antibiotic treatment) had evidence of both viruses and bacteria. Of the 19 children with a sole bacterial detection, 100% had alveolar infiltration on the chest radiograph, 89% had a serum C-reactive protein level ‡60 mg/L and 68% had a white blood cell count ‡15.0 · 10 9 /L on admission. Of children with evidence of both viruses and bacteria, only 18% had interstitial infiltration on the chest radiograph, 64% had a serum C-reactive protein level ‡60 mg/L and 50% had a white blood cell count ‡15.0 · 10 9 /L on admission.
