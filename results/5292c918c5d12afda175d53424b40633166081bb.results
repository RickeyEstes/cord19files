The KSHV transcriptome is extensively m 6 A-methylated in a cell typespecific manner We have previously developed dedicated software (m6aViewer) which implements a novel m 6 A peak-calling algorithm that identifies high-confidence methylated residues with more precision than previously described approaches (Antanaviciute et al., 2017) . Utilising this software we mapped m 6 A modifications in the KSHV transcriptome by performing m 6 A-seq in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, a BCBL1-based, primary effusion lymphoma B-cell line containing latent KSHV episomes capable of doxycycline-inducible reactivation of lytic replication. We carried out m 6 A-seq in latent cells and cells undergoing lytic replication for 8 hr and 20 hr post-induction in two biological replicates. In latent cells, we consistently observed m 6 A peaks in six viral RNAs, including ORF72 and ORF73. At 8 hr post-reactivation, 33 m 6 A peaks were identified in 21 KSHV ORFs in both biological replicates . At 20 hr post-reactivation, 75 m 6 A peaks were mapped in 42 KSHV ORFs ( Figure 1a ). The positions of these m 6 A peaks were highly reproducible across the different time points and replicates ( Figure 1-figure supplement 1b) . 12 viral m 6 A peaks were further validated by two-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (Figure 1-figure supplement 2). m 6 A peaks in cellular RNAs were also consistently called, with 18,946 m 6 A peaks common to both replicates in latent cells and 18,935 and 13,926 m 6 A peaks in cells reactivated for 8 hr and 20 hr, respectively (Figure 1b, Supplementary file 4) . Cellular m 6 A peaks remained mostly unchanged between latent and 8 hr of lytic replication. Lower detection of m 6 A peaks at 20 hr post-reactivation was observed in part due to KSHV-mediated host cell shut-off (Conrad, 2009) (Figure 1c) . However, the majority of uniquely identified m 6 A peaks at this time point were found in RNAs whose expression was increased during lytic replication ( Figure 1c) . Cellular m 6 A peaks were enriched in the coding region (CDS) and 3' untranslated region (UTR) throughout KSHV infection (Figure 1d) . In viral mRNAs, the majority of m 6 A peaks were located in the CDS (Figure 1e ). We also confirmed the DRm 6 ACH motif both in cellular and viral mRNAs (Figure 1f and g, respectively) . Approximately 60% of viral m 6 A peaks contained the GGm 6 AC[G/U] motif, a significant over-representation of the motif when compared to the expected DRm 6 ACH frequency. A further comparison using our dedicated software was performed between our m 6 A-seq datasets and previously published m 6 A-seq studies carried out in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells (Tan et al., 2018) and in a renal carcinoma cell line infected by recombinant KSHV BAC16 (iSLK cells) (Hesser et al., Figure 1 . The KSHV transcriptome is extensively m 6 A-modified. (a) KSHV epitranscriptome map in TREx BCBL1-Rta cells at 20 hr post-lytic reactivation. m 6 A-IP reads and input reads are shown. m 6 A peaks identified by m6AViewer software with associated p-values are indicated. (b) Number of cellular m 6 A peaks consistently called by m6AViewer software in two biological replicates throughout KSHV infection. (a,b) To define significantly enriched m 6 A peaks in both viral and cellular RNAs, a minimum fold change of m 6 A-IP reads over input reads of ! 1.5 and a FDR < 5% was required in both Figure 1 continued on next page 2018; Tan et al., 2018) . All raw sequencing data were subjected to quality control and processing as described in methods and m 6 A peaks were identified with m6aViewer. Peaks were filtered to keep only those with a minimum of 20 mean reads, 1% FDR (benjamini-hochberg) and an enrichment of 4-fold m 6 A-IP/input. After applying these cut-offs, our TREx BCBL1-Rta cells datasets contained twice as many m 6 A peaks as compared to the Tan dataset in the same cell line.~17,000 and~10,000 cellular m 6 A peaks were identified in our dataset during latency and lytic replication, respectively, while the Tan dataset yielded~9,000 m 6 A peaks during latency and~4,500 m 6 A peaks during lytic replication ( Figure 2a) . The most cellular m 6 A peaks were identified in the Hesser datasets in iSLK cells with~25,000 m 6 A peaks. A direct one-to-one reciprocal overlap comparison between each of our m 6 A peaks and those found in the other datasets was not possible, mostly due to vastly different peak widths (with the other datasets having narrower peaks and containing short read length coupled to single end data). In such situations, many peaks cannot be mapped one-to-one, with multiple peaks often overlapping a single one when comparing datasets, which leads to overlap quantifications that are not easily interpretable. Therefore, we compared the overlap of m 6 A-modified transcripts identified between all three studies. In TREx BCBL1-Rta cells, 72% of our 5,830 m 6 A-modified transcripts in latent cells were also present in the same cell line during latency in the Tan dataset, while 52% of our 4,059 m 6 A-modified transcripts in lytic cells were common to the lytic Tan dataset (Figure 2b ).~80% of m 6 A-modified transcripts in our TREx BCBL1-Rta dataset were also identified in the Hesser dataset which mapped m 6 A in iSLK cells ( Figure 2b ). This analysis shows a high reproducibility identifying m 6 A-modified transcripts in KSHV-infected cell lines by three different groups. Regarding viral m 6 A peaks, again, after applying the same data processing and cut-offs, we identified almost twice as many m 6 A peaks during lytic replication than the Tan dataset ( Figure 2a) . We then compared the m 6 A-IP coverage maps of the KSHV transcriptome in lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines, overall, viral m 6 A peaks were strikingly similar in both studies ( Figure 2c ). Of note, m 6 A peaks in ORF50 RNA were consistently mapped in similar regions in both iSLK and TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines ( Figure 2-figure supplement 1) , with the highest similarity found between TREx BCBL1-Rta cell lines. Although, in particular instances, m 6 A peaks differed between studies, for example ORF56 and ORF64 had a distinct m 6 A peak in this study but not in Tan et al. (Figure 2c and d, purple boxes), while K12 was m 6 A-modified in Tan et al. but not in our study (Figure 2c and d, green box). Intriguingly, when we compared the m 6 A-IP coverage maps between our lytic TREx BCBL1-Rta cells and lytic iSLK cells from Tan et al., although clear common peaks were present, these maps differed more than the TREx BCBL1-Rta cells (Figure 2c and d, blue lines) suggesting that the KSHV transcriptome may be differentially modified depending on the cell type, suggesting potential epitranscriptomic remodelling of silencing and activating m 6 A motifs may take place differently between cell types (Hesser et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018) . biological replicates. Peaks positions were considered overlapping between replicates if the calls were within 100 nucleotides between corresponding positions.

Comparison of epitranscriptomic maps in different KSHV-infected cell lines (a, b) Fastq files were downloaded from SRA (GEO accessions: GSE93676 and GSE104621) using sratoolkit. Raw sequencing data were subjected to quality control and processing as described in methods. Reads were aligned to a combined human hg38 and KSHV genome reference. m 6 A peaks were identified with m6aViewer version 1.6.1. Peaks were filtered to keep only those with a minimum of 20 mean reads, 1% FDR (benjamini-hochberg) and an enrichment of 4-fold m 6 A-IP/input. Overlapping m 6 A peaks between replicates were collapsed using GenomicRanges R package and only peaks detected across all replicates were kept for further comparisons.

The percentage of the total m 6 A-modified transcripts identified in our dataset that overlap with previously published studies in TREx BCBL1-Rta Figure 2 continued on next page RNA affinity identifies putative m 6 A readers which belong to the Tudor domain 'Royal family' We were intrigued to determine whether any m 6 A readers uniquely interact with methylated viral mRNAs. Of particular interest were the m 6 A peaks found in the second exon of ORF50 RNA, as this RNA encodes the latent to lytic switch RTA protein. To this end, RNA affinity coupled to mass spectrometry analysis was performed. Viral RNA baits were centred on the closest GGACU motif to the m 6 A peak positions of the largest peak of ORF37 and the first and fourth m 6 A peaks of the second exon of ORF50 ( Figure 1h ) (hereafter referred to as ORF37, ORF50-1 and ORF50-4 baits respectively). See Figure 3 -figure supplement 1 for m 6 A peak positions from all m 6 A-seq time points. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that all three m 6 A baits enriched for YTH readers (Figure 3a ). An intriguing observation was that of the three viral baits, exclusively the methylated ORF50-1 (m 6 A-ORF50-1) distinctly enriched SND1, a Tudor domain-containing protein. SND1 was in the top thirteen enriched protein hits, together with YTHDF1, YTHDF2 and YTHDF3. Further binding validation of YTHDF1 and SND1 in RNA affinity experiments demonstrated that YTHDF1 was greatly enriched in all three methylated baits while SND1 showed a modest but clear enrichment exclusively in m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait (Figure 3-figure supplement 2). SND1 binds symmetrically dimethylated arginines (sDMA) via its Tudor domain (Liu et al., 2010) , thus it harbours the ability to selectively recognise methyl groups. In addition to SND1, m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait also prominently pulled down three spliceosomal proteins known to interact with the Tudor domain of SND1, snRNP200, snRNP116 and PRPF8 (Yang et al., 2007) . These proteins were within the top fifteen enriched protein hits. Multiple proteins related to RNA processing were also enriched in this bait (Supplementary file 1). SND1 belongs to the Tudor domain 'Royal family', comprising five subfamilies: Tudor, plant agenet, chromo, PWWP and MBT (Maurer-Stroh et al., 2003) . Members from each subfamily share a structurally related b-barrel that harbours an aromatic cage implicated in binding methylated arginines and lysines (Chen et al., 2011) . Intriguingly, the aromatic cage used for m 6 A recognition by YTH readers is structurally similar to the one present in the 'Royal family' (Luo and Tong, 2014; Li et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2014) . Thus, further scrutiny for Royal members was carried out in the mass spectrometry data. Strikingly, several Royal members were also enriched in methylated viral baits. All three plant agenet members, which were recently identified as RNA sequence-dependent m 6 A readers (Edupuganti et al., 2017; Arguello et al., 2017) , were exclusively bound to m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait ( Figure 3a) . Three PWWP domain-containing proteins were also enriched in m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait while m 6 A-ORF37 bait retrieved the chromo protein CBX3 (Figure 3a) . These results suggest that Royal domains may be capable of reading methyl-decorations not only in proteins but also in RNA. None of the indirect m 6 A readers, hnRNPA2B1, hnRNPC or hnRNPG, or IGF2BP proteins were enriched in any of the baits (Supplementary file 2). Eight proteins with methyl-transferase activity were also recruited to methylated baits (Supplementary file 2), of these, METTL16 is the second m 6 A methyltransferase identified to date (Pendleton et al., 2017) , which methylates structured RNAs where the adenosine is present in a bulge in the nonamer sequence UACAGAGAA, where A is modified (Mendel et al., 2018) . The remaining identified proteins may play a previously uncharacterised role in the m 6 A RNA metabolism. Taken together, these results identify several members from the 'Royal family' as putative m 6 A readers. (Hesser et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018) is shown, with 1 being 100%. (c) Comparison of the lytic epitranscriptomic map from our study and the one performed by Tan et al., both carried out in TREx BCBL1-Rta. Circos plot of m 6 A-IP read coverage across the viral episome is shown for both studies. Coverage tracks were scaled to account for differences in library sizes. KSHV gene positions are indicated by the central track. Some differences in the identified m 6 A peaks between the two datasets are highlighted. Royal domains display selectivity for specific m 6 A-modified RNA hairpins We next determined whether the Royal domains from the Royal members enriched in methylated viral RNAs display affinity for m 6 A-modified RNA in the absence of any other protein interaction. The complete Royal Tudor domain of SND1 (residues 650-910) is required for sDMA-binding (Liu et al., 2010) , consequently, a GST-recombinant protein containing these residues (548-910), referred here as SND1-C-terminus, was used in native electromobility shift assays (EMSAs). Notably, SND1-C-terminus shifted m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait in contrast to the control bait ( Figure 3b ). Neither ORF50-4 nor ORF37 methylated baits were selectively bound by SND1-C-terminus (Figure 3c and d, respectively). Note that the membranes had to be overexposed to obtain a good shift signal due to the small amount of shifted RNA in comparison with the free bait, consistent with the modest enrichment of SND1 in m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait (Figure 3-figure supplement 2). Similarly, a weak shift has also been previously observed in EMSAs for FMRP protein (Edens et al., 2019) and IGF2BP proteins . RNA secondary structure prediction of all baits indicates that they form strongly base-paired hairpins with an apical loop in which m 6 A is exposed and an additional large unpaired bulge; however, ORF50-4 and ORF37 feature this unpaired bulge in the middle of their stem ( Figure 3-figure supplement 3) . This may imply that SND1 cannot bind when the unpaired bulge is present at this position irrespective of m 6 A. In contrast, the beginning of the stem of ORF50-1 shows weak base-pairing with four unpaired bases (Figure 3-figure supplement 3, black box) that may allow opening of the hairpin and selective SND1-binding when m 6 A is present. Curiously, when running m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait on its own (without any protein), two distinct bands were visualised, one lower band which migrated at the same speed of A-ORF50-1 bait and another higher band migrating slower ( Figure 3-figure supplement 4) . Electrospray ionisation (ESI) of the ORF50-1 baits showed that there were no truncated forms and that the correct molecular weight of a methyl group had been added (15 daltons), demonstrating the purity of the baits (Figure 3 -figure supplement 4). As m 6 A can destabilise local RNA structure in hairpins , it seems plausible that m 6 A addition to ORF50-1 destabilises the hairpin which then migrates slower compared with the non-methylated bait. To test this hypothesis, a cropped version of ORF50-1 bait (cORF50-1) with strong base-pairing throughout the stem (Figure 3-figure supplement 3) was tested in EMSAs. Remarkably, SND1-C-terminus did not shift this bait (Figure 3e ), highlighting that structural features of the RNA ligand are critical for SND1-binding and that the beginning of the m 6 A-ORF50-1 hairpin Figure 3 continued assigned to the protein was at least double in the methylated bait compared with the control bait. In this table, the number of unique peptides assigned to each protein is shown for each bait for clarity. (b-f) EMSAs were carried out using recombinant SND1-C-terminus protein (residues 548-910) and biotinylated viral RNA baits. A cropped version of ORF50-1 bait (cORF50-1) and a stable version of ORF50-1 bait (named sORF50-1) in which the beginning of the stem is made to have strong base pairing was also tested. Representative EMSAs from six and two independent protein purifications for b and c-f, respectively. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47261.008 The following figure supplements are available for figure 3: (Figure 3-figure supplement 3, boxed region) may be required for an interaction with SND1. We further mutated seven nucleotides to make this region very structured and stable, as demonstrated by the increase in free energy of this stable hairpin (sORF50-1). No specific selectivity for m 6 A-sORF50-1 by SND1-C-terminus was seen (Figure 3f) , indicating that destabilisation of this region is required for SND1 binding. Shorter exposure of the free m 6 A-sORF50-1 bait did not reveal two distinct bands as the ones present in m 6 A-ORF50-1 hairpin ( Figure 3-figure supplement 4) . To further support the hypothesis that Royal domains harbour selectivity for m 6 A-modified RNA, GSTrecombinant proteins containing the Royal domains of FXR1, PSIP1 and CBX3 were tested in EMSAs. Coomassie staining for all recombinant proteins can be seen in Figure 3 -figure supplement 5. The Royal domains of FXR1 and PSIP1 selectively shifted m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait, in contrast, none of the other baits were bound (Figure 3-figure supplement 6a and b, respectively) . The CBX3 chromodomain displayed a very faint shift for m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait, however this shift was not consistent between protein preparations (Figure 3-figure supplement 7a) indicating that this domain either may not be able to read m 6 A, or other protein partners could be required for its interaction with m 6 A in vivo. Control glutathione S-transferase (GST), a protein with no RNA-binding properties, was also tested in EMSA showing no selectivity for m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait (Figure 3-figure supplement 7b). EMSAs were also performed in the presence of excess herring sperm DNA as a source of nonspecific DNA. In the presence of sperm DNA no shift was detected and the free bait remained uncomplexed (Figure 3-figure supplement 7c), suggesting that non-specific DNA prevents the interaction between SND1 and m 6 A-ORF50-1 bait. This is not surprising as excess of DNA may sequester SND1 which is a known DNA-binding transcription factor. Together, these results confirm that Royal domains in the absence of any other protein interaction display selectivity for m 6 A-modified RNA, our data also suggests that this selectivity may occur in a RNA secondary structure-dependent manner.
