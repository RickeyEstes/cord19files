In total, 130 patients were included in the study. Of them, 40 were excluded due to incomplete sampling (n = 19) and lack of material for PCR analyzes (n = 21). Hence, samples were processed from 90 episodes (47 and 43 from Stockholm and Sydney, respectively), obtained from 66 individuals. Of these, 53% were females with a median age of 4.9 years (range 0.4-17.8 years). Sixty-nine percent of the episodes were derived from patients undergoing treatment for a hematological malignancy and 31% for solid tumors. A median of eight episodes were included per month (range 1-10), with no apparent seasonality. Conventional assessment by viral culture and IF on NPA samples revealed 10 (11%) episodes with the presence of one or more viral pathogen (six HRV, three CMV, and one PIV3), all identified at the Sydney study site. In addition, bacteremia was identified in 21 (23%) episodes. In total, with a conventional virus-diagnostic approach, infectious agents were identified in 26 (29%) episodes of febrile neutropenia. NPA samples were further evaluated using real-time PCR targeting the viruses detectable by culture (except for CMV) with the addition of agents not normally detected by culture (HBoV, hMPV, CoV, KIPyV, and WUPyVV). In addition to NPA, peripheral blood samples taken at enrollment were assessed for CMV, AdV, EBV and erythrovirus. The findings are shown in Table 1 . One or more viral pathogens were identified in 44 (49%) episodes overall-in 41 (46%) NPA samples and in 4 (4%) peripheral blood samples. In total, infectious agents were identified in 54 (60%) episodes of febrile neutropenia using a diagnostic approach which included PCRbased virus detection. There were no differences in the frequency of detected pathogens between the patients with a hematological malignancy and the ones with a solid tumor. Twenty-two episodes had at least one virus detected to which capacity of detection overlapped between the conventional methods and real-time PCR, Table 2 . The conventional techniques could detect a virus in seven (29%) of the 22 episodes with a median threshold cycle (Ct) of 24.4 (range 16.9-32.7). In the samples with a virus detected by only PCR, the median Ct was 33.4 (range 25-38.7). Eight individuals had NPA sampled repeatedly during separate neutropenic fever episodes and were assessable to whether the virus had cleared or persisted by real-time PCR. Of these individuals, five demonstrated clearance (after a median of 5.5 weeks, range 2.7-14 weeks), while three had the same virus persistently detectable, two rhinovirus and one HKU1 (after a median of 3.6 weeks, range 3.4-5 weeks). Differences in the clinical picture in patients with different detected pathogens and the group with no detected pathogens were sought for ( Table 1 ). The only statistical significance recorded was longer hospitalization in the groups with bacteremia and copresence of virus in NPA and in the group with only bacteremia as compared to the groups with disseminated viral infection and with no microbial agent detected. One case with fatal outcome was recorded in the group with bacteria detected in blood.
