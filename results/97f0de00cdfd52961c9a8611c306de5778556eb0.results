Tnni3 can be used to identify a pulmonary myocardium gene network Since the expression of TNNI3 has previously been used as a marker for pulmonary myocardium (Millino et al. 2000; Mommersteeg et al. 2007; Ye et al. 2015) , we reasoned that genes with expression that correlated with Tnni3 expression (trait ID 1422536_at, mean expression 11.552) Figure 1 Identification of a pulmonary myocardium gene network. The top 100 transcripts that correlated with Tnni3 in the BXD whole-lung transcriptome data set were used to generate a network graph. This resulted in a network of 24 transcripts with a Pearson correlation .0.8. (A) These 24 transcripts were subsequently regraphed to interrogate relationships at Pearson correlation values between 0.7 and 1.0 (red lines) and between 0.5 and 0.7 (orange lines). (B) The functional relationships of the 21 proteins translated from these 24 transcripts were also identified. All proteins except DOC2G and MYBPHL had known roles in cardiac function including structural sarcomeric proteins, regulation of sarcomere assembly, ion transport, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and hormone signaling. in the whole-lung data set would also be expressed in the pulmonary myocardium. We performed sample correlation in the BXD data set and returned the top 100 significantly correlated transcripts (Supplemental Material, Table S1 in File S2; P , 0.0005). This set of 100 transcripts was enriched for genes known to be associated with cardiac muscle function, including structural proteins (actin and myosin), ion transporters (ryanodine receptors, calcium, and potassium transporters), and transcription factors (Hand2 and Nkx2-5). To define genes within this list that were likely to act in a concerted manner in the pulmonary myocardium, we generated a network graph and found 24 transcripts that were significantly associated at a Pearson correlation .0.8. These 24 transcripts were subsequently regraphed with lower stringency to visualize potential relationships between them ( Figure 1A ). Three transcripts (Tnnt2, Pln, and Kcnj3) were detected by two separate probes and thus the 24 transcripts corresponded to only 21 unique genes. All 21 genes have previously been reported to be expressed in cardiac muscle (Chopra and Knollmann 2013; Ding et al. 2010; Fukuda and Mikoshiba 2000; Greulich et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2013; Hennessey et al. 2013; Holmegard et al. 2010; Huh et al. 2012; Marx et al. 2000; Reiser et al. 2001; Sequeira et al. 2015; Shaikh et al. 2016; Stobdan et al. 2015; Takeda et al. 2003; Warren et al. 2012; Yamashita et al. 2003; Zhou and Wu 2014) ( Figure 1B and Table 1 ); all were highly significantly correlated with Tnni3 (P , 3.02e 28 ). These genes can be loosely clustered into functional categories including structural sarcomeric proteins, regulation of sarcomere assembly, ion transport, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and hormone signaling (Table 1) . To ensure that the muscle-related transcripts that we had identified were indeed associated with the pulmonary myocardium and not the smooth muscle present in small arteries and surrounding the bronchus, we performed correlation analysis using Acta2. The top 100 transcripts correlated with Acta2 were enriched for smooth muscle-associated genes [including gamma-actin 2 (Actg2), leiomodin (Lmod2), transgelin (Tagln), and calponin 1 (Cnn1)], and did not significantly overlap with Tnni3-correlated transcripts (Table S2 in File S2). n Table 1 Genes coexpressed with Tnni3 in the BXD whole-lung transcriptome have known roles in the function and regulation of the heart Functional Category Gene Name Function Sarcomeric structural protein Tnni3 Cardiac troponin I The troponin complex couples calcium availability with muscle contraction (Takeda et al. 2003 ) Tnnt2 Cardiac troponin T2 Myh6 Cardiac myosin heavy chain 6 (a-MHC) Two myosin heavy chains, two essential myosin light chains and two regulatory myosin light chains interact to form the thick filament of the sarcomere (Reiser et al. 2001; Yamashita et al. 2003 )
