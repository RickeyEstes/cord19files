PDCs from aged subjects are impaired in their ability to secrete IFN-I and IFN-III (IL-29) following stimulation with CPG and influenza virus Secretion of IFNs by PDCs is critical in fighting microbial infections. Reports from the literature suggest that PDCs from aged secrete less IFN-α as compared with PDCs from young subjects. Various mechanisms such as reduced numbers of PDCs have been suggested as the culprit. We have previously reported that the percent of PDCs is comparable in the blood of aged and young subjects (Agrawal et al. 2007 ). To further confirm that reduced IFN secretion is not a consequence of reduction in numbers of PDC with age, in the present study, we have compared IFN secretion from equal numbers of purified aged and young PDCs. Subjects are described in Table 1 . The control population included 25 individuals in the age range of 20-35 years with an average age of 25 years. The geriatric population consisted of 25 individuals in the age range of 65-89 years with an average age of 80 years. The younger individuals were healthy and not on medications. As shown in Fig. 1a , secretion of IFN-I in response to CPG (Ag~1,057 pg/ml, Yg~1,584 pg/ml, p= 0.048) and influenza (Ag~1163 pg/ml, Yg1 941 pg/ml, p=0.032) was significantly impaired in PDCs from the elderly when compared with PDCs from the young. Recent reports suggest that secretion of IFN-III or IL-28/29 by PDCs also plays an important role in fighting microbial infections, particularly at mucosal surfaces (Coccia et al. 2004; Mordstein et al. 2010 ). Since IFN-III induction requires similar signals as IFN-I (Ank et al. 2006; Onoguchi et al. 2007 ), we determined if there was also an age-associated reduction in IFN-III secretion (Fig. 1b) . We observed a highly significant reduction in the levels of IFN-III secretion by aged PDCs in response to influenza (Ag~350 pg/ml, Yg~908 pg/ml, p=0.017) as compared with young subjects. The level of IFN-III reduction in the aged was more pronounced than the age-related decrease observed for IFN-I. In contrast to influenza, CPG induced low levels of IFN-III. Although CPG stimulation showed reduced IFN-III production by aged PDCs compared with young PDCs, the difference was not significant (Ag1 25 pg/ml, Yg~200 pg/ml, p=0.19). A multiplex assay for a panel of other cytokines and chemokines was also performed. IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, and IP-10 were detected after stimulation of PDCs with CPG and influenza. However, there were no significant differences (p>0.05) in the secretion of these cytokines and chemokines between the aged and young PDCs (Fig. 1c) . These data demonstrate that PDCs from aged subjects show a selective impairment in their ability to secrete IFN-I and IFN-III in response to influenza virus. Since the impairment of cytokine secretion by aged PDCs is restricted to IFNs it suggests that the uptake of ligands by the TLRs is not compromised with age and the reduced IFN secretion may be a consequence of age-associated alterations in the signaling pathway responsible for production of IFN-I and IFN-III. In the aged subjects, there were several subgroups based on comorbidities. For some of the subgroups, we had enough subjects to do a subgroup analysis. Arthritis was the most common comorbid condition in the aged population studied. IFN-I and IFN-III levels were comparable between arthritis-positive and arthritis-negative subjects (p=0.78 IFN-I, p=0.44 IFN-III). Aged subjects with hypertension and dyslipidemia were also not different in their induction of IFN-I and IFN-III (p>0.8). Many of the aged subjects were also taking vitamins and antioxidants; however, we did not observe any difference in IFN levels between the two groups (p>0.9). Based on these subgroup analyses, we feel fairly confident that the comparisons between the young control and aged subject populations are yielding valid results across a general geriatric group. The expression of TLRs is comparable between aged and young subjects Although our results in Fig. 1 suggested that reduced IFN secretion by aged PDC might not be a consequence of reduced TLR expression, we nevertheless compared the expression of TLR7 and TLR9 in PDCs from aged and young subjects to completely rule out this possibility. As shown in Fig. 2a, b , there was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the expression of either TLR7 or TLR9 in PDCs from aged and young subjects. These data suggest that age-associated alterations in signaling events downstream of TLRs may account for the reduced IFN secretion by PDCs. PDCs from aged subjects exhibit reduced phosphorylation of IRF-7 in response to CPG and influenza virus Activation of TLR7 or TLR9 in PDCs leads to MyD88 activation and subsequent recruitment of TRAF6 (TNF receptor associated factor 6), IRAK-4 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4), IRAK-1 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1), and IRF-7 (interferon regulatory factor-7; Kawai et al. 2004; Honda et al. 2004 ). IRAK-4 phosphorylates IRAK-1, which in turn phosphorylates IRF-7. Once phosphor-ylated by IRAK-1, IRF-7 translocates to the nucleus and initiates transcription of genes encoding IFN-I and IFN-III. The formation of the IRF-7, IRAK-1, and MyD88 complex is thus essential for IFN-I and IFN-III production. To investigate whether reduced IFN secretion by aged PDCs is due to a reduced expression of any of these signaling and adaptor molecules, we determined the level of expression of IRF-7, MyD88, and IRAK-1 between aged and young PDCs using real-time (RT) PCR. As shown in Fig. 3a , IRF-7, MyD88, and IRAK-1 gene expression levels are comparable between aged and young subjects, suggesting that the decrease in the expression of these genes is not responsible for the reduced IFN-I and IFN-III secretion in the aged. It has been observed that type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) deficient PDCs fail to produce type I IFNs in response to TLR agonists, and that IFNAR signaling itself further augments IFN-I production in a positive feedback loop (Watarai et al. 2008) . Therefore, we investigated if the expression of IFNAR1, and two Fig. 2 The expression of TLR7 and TLR9 in PDCs are comparable between aged and young subjects.

Figure is mean ±SE of 12 different aged and young subjects differed between the aged and young PDCs. The gene expression levels of both the IFNAR receptors were comparable in PDCs from aged and young subjects (Fig. 3a) , suggesting that signaling through IFNARs may not be responsible for the reduced IFN production by PDCs from aged subjects. Since the activation and phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF-7 is essential for the secretion of IFN-I and IFN-III by PDCs, we examined the phosphorylation of IRF-7 in PDCs from aged and young subjects after stimulation with CPG or influenza virus. Both CPG and influenza resulted in significantly increased (p=0.002 for CPG, p=0.001 for influenza) IRF-7 phosphorylation compared with unstimulated controls (Fig. 3b, c) in young subjects. In the aged PDCs, the phosphorylation of IRF-7 was severely impaired (Fig. 3b, c) . Stimulation with influenza resulted in significantly increased (p=0.01) phosphorylation of IRF-7 in aged PDCs. Stimulation with CPG resulted in an even lower IRF-7 phosphorylation and there was no significant (p>0.05) upregulation compared with unstimulated controls. These results clearly demonstrate that the PDCs from the aged subjects are impaired in their ability to phosphorylate IRF-7, which may be responsible for the reduced IFN-I and IFN-III production.

Figure is mean ±SE of 12 different aged and young subjects PDCs from aged subjects are impaired in their capacity to induce perforin, granzyme and IFN-γ producing CD8 T cells Activation of PDCs by viruses is considered a key event in enhancing the cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells by inducing cytotoxic granules of perforin and granzyme, predominantly through IFN-I and IFN-III secretion (Tiwari et al. 1991; Kolumam et al. 2005) . Since IFN-I and IFN-III production is decreased in aged PDCs, we investigated if the decrease was sufficient to impair the generation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells. As shown in Fig. 4a , c (contour plots), influenza-stimulated young and aged PDCs resulted in an increased percentage of CD8 T cells expressing perforin and granzyme relative to the unstimulated PDCs. However, the percent of CD8 T cells expressing perforin and granzyme over unstimulated controls was significantly less (p=0.035 for perforin, p=0.005 for granzyme) in aged PDCs as compared with that in young PDCs (Fig. 4b, d) . Stimulation of aged PDCs with CPG did not result in a significant increase (p> 0.05) in the percentage of CD8 T cells expressing perforin and granzyme over unstimulated controls. However, CPG stimulation of young PDCs showed a significant increase (p< 0.05, Fig. 4a, c) in the percentage of perforin and granzyme expressing CD8 T cells. Therefore, percent of CD8 T cells expressing perforin and granzyme over unstimulated controls was significantly less (p=0.049 for perforin, p=0.015 for granzyme) in aged PDCs as compared with that in young PDCs (Fig. 4b, d) . In addition to perforin and granzyme, IFN-γ production by CD8 T cells is also essential for mounting a robust antiviral response. Therefore, we used ELISA to assay the IFN-γ released by the CD8 T cells after exposure to the stimulated young and aged PDCs. IFN-γ secretion displayed a profile very similar to perforin and granzyme (Fig. 4e, f ). Figure 4e depicts the level of IFN-γ secreted by CD8 T cells while Fig. 4f represents the fold increase which is derived by calculating the increase in IFN-γ secretion on stimulation over the unstimulated values. IFN-γ secretion was significantly reduced (p=0.01) in CD8 T cells co-cultured with influenza-stimulated aged PDCs relative to influenza-stimulated young PDCs. IFN-γ secretion in response to CPG was also significantly impaired (p=0.026) in the aged subjects relative to the young subjects. These data demonstrate that PDCs from aged are impaired in their capacity to enhance the expansion of cytotoxic CD8 T cells expressing perforin, granzyme, and IFN-γ. PDCs from aged subjects are impaired in their capacity to prime CD4 and CD8 T cells In addition to secretion of IFNs, activation of PDCs by microbial ligands also leads to antigen presentation (Gibson et al. 2002) . After initial secretion of IFNs, PDCs subsequently mature, and lose their capacity to produce IFNs and acquire antigen presenting functions. Mature PDCs are capable of priming adaptive immune CD4 and CD8 T cell responses. We investigated the capacity of aged and young PDCs to induce CD4 T and CD8 T cell proliferation. Purified aged and young PDCs were stimulated overnight with CPG or influenza virus as described. Next day, the cells were collected and cultured with purified T cells to determine T cell proliferation, and cytokine secretion. Although influenza-stimulated aged PDCs induced CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation, the proliferation was significantly (p =0.027 for CD4 T, p= 0.032 for CD8 T) reduced when compared with young subjects (Fig. 5d) . CPG-stimulated aged PDCs were unable to induce proliferation of CD4 T cells above the unstimulated controls. Induction of CD8 T cell proliferation by CPG-stimulated aged PDCs was slightly enhanced over controls though the difference was not significant (p>0.05). In contrast, CPGstimulated PDCs from young donors significantly (p<0.05) enhanced the proliferation of CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells. The CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation induced by aged and young PDCs was comparable in the absence of stimulation. Next, we determined the nature of cytokines secreted by T cells primed with stimulated and unstimulated aged and young PDCs. T cells stimulated with both CPG and flu stimulated aged PDCs displayed higher levels of IL-10 and lower levels of IFN-γ compared with T cells primed with their young counterparts though the differences are not significant (p>0.05). IL-5 levels were undetectable (data not shown). These data suggest that PDCs from aged subjects display reduced capacity to prime T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion and are therefore defective in antigen presentation.
