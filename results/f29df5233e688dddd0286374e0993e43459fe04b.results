We have recently identified that MuRF2, a muscle-specific ubiquitin ligase, is a critical factor that regulates cardiomyocyte size during development in concert with MuRF1 [40] . MuRF2 has also been described as the effector protein in the Titin-nbr1-p62 complex that responds to mechanical changes in the sarcomere to inhibit transactivation of the nuclear transcription factor serum response factor (SRF) [41] . MuRF2's regulation of the nuclear specific SRF was the first indication that MuRF2, found primarily in the cytoplasm, could regulate the activity of nuclear receptors, presumably through direct interaction, ubiquitination, and apparent nuclear export [41] . These findings led us to hypothesize that MuRF2 similarly regulates other nuclear receptors critical to cardiomyocytes. To test this, we used MuRF2−/− mice previously characterized without a cardiac or skeletal muscle phenotype [26] . However, we recently identified that MuRF2−/− hearts exhibited changes in metabolomics signatures, indicating that changes in metabolism are present despite any functional effect at baseline [37] . We initially assayed isolated nuclei from MuRF2−/− hearts for their DNA-binding activity contributed by PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ as the PPARs have been best described in altering cardiac metabolism [42] and have been reported to be regulated by ubiquitination [43] . To our surprise, we found that MuRF2−/− hearts had significantly increased PPAR activities, with increases in PPARα (+twofold), PPARβ (~1.6 fold), and PPARγ (over +fourfold) activities compared with sibling MuRF2+/+ control mice (Fig. 1a) . These findings suggested that endogenous MuRF2 attenuated the activity of all three PPAR transcription factors found in cardiomyocytes. Since MuRF2 is an ubiquitin ligase and PPAR transcription factors have been described with post-translational modification by ubiquitin, we hypothesized that MuRF2 may regulate these PPAR transcription factors in a ubiquitination-dependent manner. The pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy involves the enhanced activation of PPAR transcription factors [44] . Diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by increased free fatty acid oxidation in parallel with cardiomyocyte insulin resistance [6] . Both the resulting increased fatty acid oxidation and insulin contribute to the decreased ability for the heart to switch away from fatty acid utilization to glucose [45] . Since cardiac MuRF2−/− mice exhibited enhanced PPAR activity, we hypothesized that the induction of diabetic cardiomyopathy would result in both enhanced PPAR activity, resulting in significant cardiac dysfunction compared with wildtype mice. To test this hypothesis, we challenged the MuRF2−/− mice to a 60% high-fat diet, which reproducibly induces insulin resistance and diabetic cardiomyopathy ( Fig. 1b) [24] . After 26 weeks of high fat diet challenge, MuRF2−/− mice had significantly lower blood glucose compared with sibling wildtype controls but no differences in serum insulin levels (Additional file 1: Figure S1a ). Serum triglycerides were similarly elevated in MuRF2−/− and wildtype controls after 26 weeks of high fat diet (Additional file 1: Figure S1b ). Increased cardiac MuRF2 protein levels were identified after high fat diet (Fig. 1c) , paralleling MuRF2 increases identified in human inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geoprofiles/26614376) and coronary artery atherosclerosis (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geoprofiles/16462729). MuRF2−/− hearts increased total weight more than wildtype controls in high fat diet challenge (Fig. 1d ) in addition to having significant increases in overall body weight at any 15, 22, and 25 weeks of HFD (Fig. 1e) . However, no significant changes were identified in gastrocnemius, soleus, or tibialis anterior muscles weights (Additional file 1: Figure S1c ). Echocardiographic analysis of MuRF2−/− hearts at baseline found no deficits in function or differences in measurements ( Fig. 2a ; Table 1 ) as previously described [40, 46] . Significant deficits in heart function were identified in the MuRF2−/− hearts in as little as 6 weeks after the initiation of high fat diet ( Fig. 2b, d) . Both MuRF2−/− and wildtype mice experienced an equal progressive dilation over time on a high fat diet, evidenced by increases in LVESD (Fig. 2a, far right panel) . MuRF2−/− hearts exhibited significant dysfunction as early as 6 weeks of HFD compared to MuRF2+/+ hearts (Fig. 2b) . MuRF2−/− hearts were significantly larger than MuRF2+/+ hearts after 26 weeks high fat diet (Fig. 2b-d) . Diabetic cardiomyocyte-related changes in myosin heavy chain gene expression were next investigated to determine differences between groups. Comparable increases in βMHC were seen in MuRF2−/− and wildtype hearts (Fig. 2e) , consistent with previous studies identifying these increases [47] . MuRF2−/− cardiac expression of skeletal muscle α-actin and αMHC were increased in chow control hearts compared to wild type mice, and MuRF2−/− skeletal muscle α-actin was significantly increased as compared to wild type mice after 26 weeks high fat diet (Fig. 2e) . No difference existed in αMHC after 26 weeks of high fat diet in either MuRF2−/− or MuRF2 +/+ mice (Fig. 2e) , although this is reported in other models of diabetic cardiomyopathy [48, 49] . Brain natriuretic protein (BNP) mRNA was decreased in both MuRF2−/− and controls after 26 weeks high fat diet feeding (Fig. 2e) . Taken together, these studies identified that MuRF2−/− hearts failed sooner than MuRF2+/+ hearts, resulting in larger hearts, including LV wall thickness and heart weights after 26 weeks high fat diet challenge. LV remodeling is a distinctive finding in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. These changes include the development of fibrosis, resulting from the accumulation of extracellular collagen [50, 51] . Reduced MMP2 activity [52] and O-GlcNAcylation stimulated cardiac fibroblast collagen synthesis has been reported [53] . In this particular model, less than 2% fibrosis was identified throughout the heart in MuRF2−/− and wildtype controls (Fig. 3a) . However, MuRF2−/− hearts revealed a parallel reduction in vimentin-positive fibroblasts (Fig. 3b) at 21 weeks of high fat diet. This wildtype mouse, interestingly, revealed almost 4% fibrosis (Additional file 2: Figure S2c ) with amorphous waxy infiltrates and leukocyte infiltrates (Additional file 2: Figure S2b ) not seen in either MuRF2−/− or wildtype hearts after 26 weeks high fat diet (Additional file 2: Figure S2a ). Overall, while MuRF2−/− hearts have significant increases in fibrosis, the total fibrosis is minimal and does not account for the large changes in cardiac size, dysfunction, and suggests other non-structural signaling pathways likely are involved in the MuRF2−/− exaggerated cardiac dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy.
