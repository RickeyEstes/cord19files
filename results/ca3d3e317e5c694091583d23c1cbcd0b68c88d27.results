CedV G Binds to B-and A-Class Ephrins. The 8 human ephrins are categorized into subclasses based on membrane anchors; ephrin-A1 to A5 are linked to the cell membrane by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), whereas ephrin-B1 to -B3 possess a transmembrane domain. Since we previously observed that replication-competent recombinant CedV (rCedV) can enter ephrin-B2-deficient HeLa-USU cells (30), we investigated whether CedV G could interact with other ephrins. We approached this question by coprecipitation of tetrameric soluble CedV G (sG) (35) with a panel of soluble ephrins. Fig. 1A documents that CedV sG coprecipitated ephrin-B2, but not ephrin-B3. Surprisingly, CedV sG coprecipitated ephrin-B1 as efficiently as ephrin-B2. We also detected weak interactions with the A-class ephrins, -A2 and -A5 (Fig. 1A) . Next, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to quantify the interactions of ephrin-B1, -B2, -A2, and -A5. As expected, ephrin-B2 bound strongly to CedV sG ( Fig. 1C and Table 1 ; with an equilibrium dissociation constant [K d ] = 0.56 nM). Remarkably, the affinity-binding constant of ephrin-B1 was similar to that of ephrin-B2 (Fig. 1B and Table 1 ; K d = 0.24 nM). Ephrin-A2 and -A5 interacted with CedV sG at an ∼500-fold lower level than ephrin-B1 and -B2 (Table 1 ; K d = 196 nM and K d = 113 nM, respectively). CedV Glycoproteins Mediate Cell-Cell Fusion with GPI-Anchored and Transmembrane Ephrins. To assess whether all CedV sG-binding ephrins could support membrane fusion, we transfected CHO745 target cells (36, 37) with expression plasmids encoding each ephrin, and subsequently incubated with CHO745 effector cells transiently expressing CedV glycoproteins. Indeed, effector cells expressing CedV glycoproteins fused with target cells expressing ephrin-A2, -A5, -B1, and -B2 ( Fig. 2 A, Left) . We also noted minimal levels of fusion with ephrin-A1, but no fusion with ephrin-A3 and -A4. In line with previously published results, CedV glycoproteins were unable to support fusion with target cells expressing ephrin-B3 (6, 30) . As controls, cells expressing HeV or NiV glycoproteins fused only with cells expressing ephrin-B2 and -B3 ( Fig. 2 A, Center and Right). To determine the kinetics of CedV glycoprotein-mediated cellcell fusion with different ephrins, we used a split-luciferase reporter-based fusion assay (30) . We cocultured CHO-K1 cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ) expressing one of the ephrins with cells transiently expressing CedV glycoproteins. CHO-K1 cells expressing ephrin-B2 showed the highest fusion activity. Ephrin-B1 sustained similar levels of fusion activity as ephrin-B2, while ephrin-B3 did not support cell-cell fusion (Fig. 2B) . Ephrin-A1, -A2, and -A5 also sustained cell-cell fusion, while ephrin-A3 and -A4 did not (Fig. 2C) . The A-class ephrins were ∼5-fold less efficient at supporting fusion than the B-class ephrins, as calculated from the level of fusion over the linear portion of the time course (Fig. 2D ). While human ephrin-A1 did not pull down sG (Fig. 1A) , it did sustain low levels of fusion ( Fig. 2 A and D) . It should be noted that while we operated with the tagged ectodomain of ephrin-A1 for the binding assay, we used the authentic full-length protein for the cell-cell fusion assays. Moreover, the split-reporter-based fusion assay is very sensitive, even low-affinity interactions that allow fusion triggering and membrane merger may be detected, and the fusion levels remained consistent within technical replicates and across independent experiments (Fig. 2) . CedV Utilizes Ephrin-A2, -A5, and -B1 as Receptors. Next, we sought to determine whether the ephrins that mediated cell-cell fusion would also facilitate virus entry. We inoculated a recombinant CedV that expresses GFP (rCedV-GFP) (30) on CHO-K1 cells that had been transiently transfected with the relevant ephrins. We observed GFP expression, indicative of cell entry, in cells expressing ephrin-A2, -A5, -B1, or -B2 (Fig. 3A ). More GFPpositive cells were monitored in CHO-K1 cells expressing ephrin-B1 and -B2 compared with cells expressing ephrin-A2 and -A5. In contrast to cell-cell fusion assays ( Fig. 2 A and C), but in agreement with the coprecipitation data ( Fig. 1A) , we did not observe rCedV-GFP infection of ephrin-A1-expressing CHO-K1 cells. Interestingly, we only observed syncytia in CHO-K1 cells expressing ephrin-B1 or -B2 ( Structure of CedV G. The unexpectedly broad receptor utilization by CedV G could be explained by a distinct structure of its receptorbinding site. To gain structural insights into the receptor recognition mechanism, we determined the structures of CedV G by itself and in complex with each of the 2 high-affinity receptors, ephrin-B1 and -B2. The CedV G ectodomain structure was determined at 3.3 Å resolution (SI Appendix, Table S1 ). Like the other henipavirus G proteins, the CedV G head domain adopts a 6bladed β-propeller structure (Fig. 4A ). To assess structural similarity, we determined the root-mean-square deviation (R.M.S.D) of all CedV G atoms when superimposed on the previously determined NiV G, HeV G, and GhV G structures (17, 18, 31) . The R.M.S.D.s are 1.360 Å, 1.272 Å, and 1.678 Å, respectively (Fig.  4B) . Interestingly, CedV G has more N-linked glycosylation modifications, and these modifications have different locations, than those of the other G proteins. We observed 8 N-linked glycan moieties at asparagine residues 311, 322, 357, 403, 425, 441, 502, and 562 ( Fig. 4A and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ), which is consistent with the prediction (NetNGlyc 1.0 Server). Moreover, we observed 8 disulfide bonds, including C239 to C263, C305 to C318, C310 to C376, C399 to C416, C404 to C520, C514 to C524, C586 to C595, and the long-range bond C212 to C622 (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ). Compared with other henipavirus G proteins, an extra disulfide bond, C310 to C376, is located between blade2strand1 and bla-de3strand1′ of the β-propeller architecture. Structures of CedV G in Complex with Ephrin-B1 or -B2. The CedV G-ephrin-B1 and CedV G-ephrin-B2 complex structures were determined at 3.50 Å and 2.85 Å resolution, respectively ( Fig. 5A and SI Appendix, Table S1 ). The interface between CedV G protein and ephrin-B2 or ephrin-B1 buries surface areas of 1,412 Å 2 and 1,425 Å 2 , respectively. A hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic rim, which were observed in other henipavirus-ephrin interfaces (18, 38) , were also found in the CedV G-ephrin B1/B2 interfaces. The hydrophobic core was formed by inserting the tip of the ephrin G-H loop into the receptor-binding pocket of the G protein, whereas the hydrophilic rim involved multiple hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between either residues K103 and K113 of ephrin-B2 or residues K59 and K113 of ephrin-B1, and residues E522, E576, and E554 of CedV G protein (SI Appendix, Figs. S3 and S4, respectively). All electrostatic interactions involved in ephrin-B2 receptor binding are conserved between the CedV G-ephrin-B2 complex and HeV G-ephrin-B2 complexes. By comparing the receptor-bound and unbound CedV G, we k off , dissociation reaction; k on , association reaction. *Ephrin-B1, -B2, and -A2 are of mouse origin; ephrin-A5 is of human origin. observed no significant conformational change, even in the receptor-binding pocket region (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A ). Furthermore, CedV-G-ephrin complex structures resemble those of other reported henipavirus-G-ephrin complexes (19, 31) with a similar receptor G-H loop insertion angle (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B ).
