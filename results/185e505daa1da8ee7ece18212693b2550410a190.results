In vivo rescue of rZiKV by inoculation of cells transfected with pBAc-ZiKV. Chen et al. had previously described a method for the in vivo recovery of influenza A virus (IAV), a negative-strand RNA virus, after the inoculation in the nasal cavity of mice with cells transfected with a bacmid containing the entire IAV genome 34 . A similar approach was used to study the potential for reassortment between different IAV subtype strains in ferrets 35, 36 . Thus, we conducted similar studies to determine whether this approach was valid for the in vivo rescue of rZIKV (Fig. 1 ). Vero cells (1 × 10 6 cells, triplicates) were transfected with 5 µg of the pBAC-ZIKV cDNA clone using Lipofectamine 2000 (LPF) (1:3 ratio of cDNA:LPF, herein referred as pBAC-ZIKV/LPF). At 12 h post-transfection (hpt), cells were trypsinized, washed and resuspended in PBS, and used to inoculate mice. Unless otherwise stated, animal studies were performed in 4-5-weeks old, IFNAR−/− A129 mice consisting of 6 mice/group, 3 females and 3 males (Fig. 1A) . Mice were inoculated with the pBAC-ZIKV/LPF-transfected Vero cells (1 × 10 6 cells/mouse) either subcutaneously (SC) in the footpad ( Fig. 1B -D, top panels), intramuscularly (IM) in the quadriceps muscle ( Fig. 1B -D, middle panels) or intraperitoneally (IP) in the peritoneal cavity ( Fig. 1B-D, bottom panels) . Animals were subsequently monitored daily for clinical disease signs including tremors, disorientation, hind limb weakness and severe paralysis (data not shown), body weight loss (Fig. 1B) and survival (Fig. 1C ) for 18 days post-inoculation (dpi). Independent of the inoculation route, all mice lost weight rapidly starting about 6 dpi (Fig. 1B) . Mice showed severe paralysis and succumbed to the disease by 8-10 dpi (Fig. 1C) , consistent with effective rZIKV infection 30 . Blood samples were collected at 3 and 6 dpi to test for viremia (Fig. 1D ). In general, virus titers in the order ~10 5 focus-forming units per ml (FFU/ml) were readily observed in samples from 3 dpi (Fig. 1D ), in agreement with the morbidity and mortality data (Fig. 1B,C) . In addition, successful rescue of rZIKV was similar in both male and female mice (Fig. 1B-D) . At 6 dpi, virus was only detected in one female mouse inoculated SC (Fig. 1D , top panel) and in all mice inoculated IP (Fig. 1D , bottom panel). Notably, no virus was detected by 6 dpi in mice inoculated IM (Fig. 1D, middle panel) . As an internal control for these experiments, similarly transfected Vero cells were maintained in culture and the rescue of rZIKV was analyzed. Around 10 6 FFU/ml were detected in all cases by 48 hpt (data not shown), confirming the functionality of the pBAC-ZIKV cDNA clone used for the in vivo experiments. Importantly, mice inoculated with Vero cells transfected with empty BAC plasmid did not result in any clinical signs of disease, body weight loss or death; and rZIKV were not detected at any day post-inoculation (data not shown). These data demonstrate that rZIKV can be successfully rescued in vivo after inoculation of Vero cells transfected with the pBAC-ZIKV/LPF mixture. In vivo rescue of rZiKV by direct inoculation of the pBAc-ZiKV/Lpf mixture. To further determine whether rZIKV could be rescued in vivo directly after inoculation of the pBAC-ZIKV cDNA clone, mice were inoculated with 100 µg of pBAC-ZIKV complexed with 100 µl of LPF (1:1 ratio), both diluted in Opti-MEM in a final volume of 200 µl ( Fig. 2A) . The same three routes described above were evaluated. The group of mice inoculated SC, showed only one female and one male with signs of infection and weight loss from 9 and 12 dpi, respectively (Fig. 2B, top panel) . These same mice finally succumbed to the disease by 12 and 16 dpi, respectively Mice that lost more than 20% of their initial body weight or presented hind limb paralysis were humanely euthanized. Error bars represent standard deviations (SD) of the mean for each group of mice. Mice were bled at 3 and 6 dpi and viral titers in sera were determined by immunofocus assay (FFU/ml) (D). Symbols represent data from individual mice and bars the geometric means of viral titers. *Virus not detected in one mouse; &, virus not detected in two mice; ND, not detected. Dotted black lines indicate the limit of detection, LoD (200 FFU/ml). No statistically significant differences between the SC, IM and IP routes of inoculation of transfected cells were observed. ( Fig. 2C , top panel). Viremia correlated with the signs of infection, detecting the presence of rZIKV in the serum of the inoculated female mouse at 6 dpi, but not in the male where the signs of infection were delayed (Fig. 2D , top panel). In the IM inoculated group, 2 female and 2 male mice showed evident signs of infection from 7-11 dpi, resulting in rapid weight loss and death (between 7 and 14 dpi; Fig. 2B ,C, middle panels). These mice showed viremia at 6 dpi, with the exception of the female where the signs of infection were delayed until 11 dpi (Fig. 2D , middle panels). At 3 dpi, the presence of rZIKV was only detected in one male mouse, although the viremia was prolonged until 6 dpi. Notably, all 6 mice inoculated IP succumbed to viral infection, and rZIKV was detected in the sera of all animals sampled at 6 dpi ( Fig. 2B -D, bottom panels). In general, after delivery in vivo of the pBAC-ZIKV/LPF mixture, signs of disease were delayed 2 to 3 days compared to mice infected with rZIKV 30 . This delay correlated with the detection of the rZIKV at 6 dpi in mice inoculated with the pBAC-ZIKV/LPF mixture. As internal control for these experiments, Vero cells were transfected with the pBAC-ZIKV/LPF mixture and female (N = 3) mice were inoculated with the pBAC-ZIKV infectious cDNA clone complexed with LPF SC in the footpad (50 µg/mouse/footpad; total 100 µg, top), IM in the quadriceps muscle (100 µg/mouse, middle), or IP in the peritoneal cavity (100 µg/mouse, bottom). Body weight (B) and survival (C) were evaluated for 18 days. Mice that lost more than 20% of their initial body weight or presented hind limb paralysis were humanely euthanized.

Statistically significant differences (p = 0.0026) in survival were observed between mice inoculated IP to those inoculated SC or IM using a Long-rank test. Differences in viral titers were not statistically significant (p = 0.512) at 3 dpi. Differences in viral titers were statistically significant (p = 0.002) at 6 dpi using ANOVA test. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (10 µl containing 5 µg of plasmid DNA) used to inoculate mice resulting in ~2 × 10 6 FFU/ml of rZIKV by 48 hpt, confirming the quality of the transfection mixture used in the in vivo studies (data not shown). Notably, mice inoculated with empty BAC plasmid did not result in the recovery of ZIKV at any day post-inoculation and no clinical signs of disease, body weight loss or death were observed (data not shown). These data demonstrate that rZIKV can be successfully recovered in vivo with 100% efficiency after inoculation in the peritoneal cavity of mice with the pBAC-ZIKV/LPF mixture.
