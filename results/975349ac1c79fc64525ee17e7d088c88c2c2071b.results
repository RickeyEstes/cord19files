We investigate this approximation approach using three different examples. These examples also serve to demonstrate that robust estimates could be made with less data and potentially earlier in an outbreak -a point we revisit in the Discussion. Our initial investigation of this question was motivated by work on the West African Ebola Outbreak [47] , so we start with that example. To probe the approximation more thoroughly, we also chose one disease with high variation in generation interval (canine rabies), and one with a high reproductive number (measles). For simplicity, we assumed that latent and infectious periods are equivalent to incubation and symptomatic periods for Ebola virus disease (EVD), measles, and canine rabies.
