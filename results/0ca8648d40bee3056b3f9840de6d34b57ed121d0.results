The polycationic VP5 C-terminal end is sufficient to drive the GFP reporter to the PM Although accumulation of VP5 at the PM of infected cells has been documented by several reports from different laboratories, the mechanism(s) used by this protein to reach this compartment remained to be experimentally explored. The identification of a mildly hydrophobic stretch within the central region of this polypeptide (residues 69 to 88) as a transmembrane domain by two servers, i.e. TM pred [18] and TopPred [19] , led us to hypothesize that VP5 might behave as a type II transmembrane polypeptide [12] . However, subsequent topological predictions performed with programs using updated algorithms, i.e. SPOCTOPUS [20] , PHOBIUS [21] , DAS [22] , and HMMTOP [23] , failed to identify the presence an amphipathic Î±-helix that might act as a transmembrane region (data not shown). This contradicting information led us to analyze other alternatives to explain the PM targeting of this polypeptide. Inspection of the VP5 sequence revealed the presence of a polycationic C-terminal region spanning amino acid residues 132-143 containing three closely spaced clusters formed by two or three consecutive basic amino acid residues, namely 132 KR 133 , 136 KRR 138 and 142 RK 143 (Fig 1A) . A comparison of VP5 sequences from classical and very virulent serotype I and avirulent serotype II IBDV strains indicates that this region is fairly well conserved (Fig 1B) . A wide variety of cellular proteins employ surface exposed positively charged domains to interact with anionic lipids anchored to the inner PM leaflet [24] . To explore whether the VP5 C-terminal tail might be involved in PM tropism, a sequence coding for the 24 VP5 C-terminal residues was fused inframe to the 3 0 end of the GFP ORF. This construct was named GFP/CT122-145. Two additional plasmids were used as control for subsequent experiments, i.e. pGFP/VP5 expressing the EGFP gene fused to the VP5 ORF lacking the initiation ATG codon (GFP/VP5), and pEGFPC1 expressing EGFP gene (GFP). Plasmids harboring the different constructs were transfected to preconfluent HeLa cell monolayers. At 12 h post-transfection cultures were fixed, processed for IF using a mouse anti-GFP mAb, and visualized by CLSM. As shown in Fig 2, the GFP protein showed a diffuse cytoplasmic/nuclear signal. As expected, the GFP-VP5 polypeptide accumulated at the PM. Noteworthy, the GFP/CT122-145 IF signal was specifically found to accumulate at both the PM and nuclei of transfected cells, thus indicating that this region is sufficient for an efficient PM targeting. PM targeting motifs resemble nuclear localization sequences [25] . Furthermore, it has been shown that the polybasic C-terminal tails from some small GTPases, e.g. Rit and Rin, drive GFP fusion proteins to both PM and nuclei [26] . Accordingly, the presence of the GFP/CT122-145 fusion protein at cell nuclei was not an unexpected finding.
