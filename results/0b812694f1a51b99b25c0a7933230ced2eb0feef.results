Based on preliminary pilot experiments, we determined that rhinovirus survival on fingertips was equivalent across different incubation times as it remained infectious on all fingers after 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. Immediately after deposition, half of the droplets were disrupted and spread on the surface of the fingertip using a pipette tip to determine whether disrupting the integrity and environment of the droplet decreased virus survival. As all intact and disrupted droplets yielded positive culture results, we decided to continue experiments with disrupted droplets only so as to reproduce real-life conditions as much as possible. One hour after the deposit of disrupted droplets on the fingers of the six volunteers, infectious viruses could be detected by culture in all subjects contaminated with HC droplets (6/6), in four of the six volunteers with AC droplets, and none of the six volunteers with LC droplets, which confirmed the influence of concentration on survival (Fig. 1) . Of note, when droplets were directly incubated without a passage on fingers, the virus survived in 100% (4/4) of tested fingers at HC compared with 25% (1/4) at LC, despite being below the limit of detection by PCR (data not shown). Overall, the proportion of fingers with detectable viruses was 16/18 fingers at HC, compared with 6/18 and 0/18 for the AC and LC droplets, respectively (Fig. 1) . Laboratory room (mean ± standard deviation 24.6 ± 0.7°C) and hood (26.4 ± 1.8°C ) temperature, as well as humidity (44.5 ± 5.6%), were similar for all experiments with all subjects.
