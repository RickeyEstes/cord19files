The prevalence of bovine cryptosporidiosis in the three Algerian regions investigated was estimated at 52.2% (95% confidence interval: 47.6-56.7%) by microscopy, with Cryptosporidium oocysts being detected in 240/460 of the faecal samples examined (Table 1) . The parasite was present in all 10 farms surveyed, where 67.1% (460/686) of cattle present at the time of the study were sampled. Marked differences in prevalence, ranging from 17% to 100%, were observed among the investigated farms. Farms located in north-central Algeria harboured significantly higher infection rates of bovine cryptosporidiosis than those in the north-western (χ 2 = 33.5; P < .00001) and north-eastern (χ 2 = 52.5; P < .00001) regions of the country. Out of the 240 Cryptosporidium infections detected, 26.3% occurred in calves aged two to 15 days old, 22.1% in calves aged 16 to 30 days old, 37.1% in cattle aged > 1 month to 12 month old, and 14.5% in cattle older than 12 month. Regarding the presence of clinical Table 2) . Diarrhoeic samples were significantly more frequently detected in infected calves in the 2-15 days (χ 2 = 117.9; P < 0.00001) and 16-30 days (χ 2 = 21.9; P < 0.00001) age groups than in older animals, respectively. The commercial CpAg-ELISA assay only confirmed the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in 15.8% (38/240) of the faecal samples that previously tested positive by microscopic examination. Positive CpAg-ELISA results were more often obtained in diarrhoeal samples from calves up to 1 month-old ( Table 2) . Out of the 38 faecal specimens with a Cryptosporidium-positive result by both microscopy and ELISA, 76.3% (29/38) yielded amplicons of the expected (~480 bp) size at the ssu rRNA-PCR. Sequencing analyses allowed the identification of four Cryptosporidium species circulating in the surveyed calf population, including C. parvum (72.4%, 21/ 29), C. bovis (13.8%, 4/29), C. andersoni, (3.4%, 1/29), and C. ryanae (3.4%, 1/29). Two additional isolates (7.0%) were only identified at the genus level due to poor sequence quality (Table 3 ). The occurrence of these Cryptosporidium species followed a clear age-related pattern. C. parvum was the almost only species found in both symptomatic (91%) and asymptomatic (68%) calves in the 2-15 days age group, although a sub-clinical infection by C. ryanae was also identified in a 12-day-old, asymptomatic calf. C. parvum infections prevailed in calves in the 16-30 days age group too, with the exception of two (one symptomatic, one asymptomatic) calves infected by C. bovis. However, C. parvum infections were absent in calves older than 30 days, where C. bovis was the most prevalent (67%) species found. Additionally, a single infection by C. andersoni was found in an 18-month-old, asymptomatic heifer (Table 3) . No apparent differences in the geographical distribution of Cryptosporidium infections were noted. Both C. parvum and C. bovis evidenced a rather wide distribution, being present in the three Algerian regions under study. C. parvum was present in all exploitations investigated except farms 1 and 3, whereas C. bovis was found in farms 1, 3, 8, and 9. C. andersoni was only reported in farm 1 (Western Algeria) and C. ryanae in farm 5 (Eastern Algeria). No Cryptosporidium isolates from farm 10 could be genotyped (Table 3) . Sub-genotyping data of the 27 ssu rRNA sequences unequivocally assigned to a given Cryptosporidium species are summarized in Table 4 . The only isolate identified as C. andersoni contained a T insertion between nucleotides 633 and 634 of reference sequence AF093496 within a 494-bp (positions 528-1021) fragment. All four C. bovis isolates showed 100% homology to a 460-bp fragment (positions 311-770) of reference sequence AY741305. Interestingly, all 21C. parvum sequences generated in the present study were identical among them. Sequence alignment analyses with reference sequence AF112571 allowed the identification of a 498-bp fragment (positions 533-1030) with a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including an ATTA deletion between nucleotides 688 and 691. Finally, the only isolate assigned to C. ryanae was identical to a 458-bp fragment (positions 314-771) of reference sequence EU410344. BLAST searches did not reveal the presence of novel genotypic variants. The 21 isolates assigned to C. parvum at the ssu rRNA locus were subsequently assessed at the gp60 locus in order to ascertain the subgenotype(s) of the parasite involved in the infections. Overall, amplification products of the expected (~830 bp) size were obtained in 38.1% (8/21) of the tested isolates. All eight gp60 sequences were confirmed as sub-genotype IIaA16G2R1. Seven of them were identical to GenBank sequence KF128739 isolated in a yak in China, whereas the remaining one differed from them by a single SNP (T to A) at position 377 of KF128739 and represented an unreported genotypic variant. No polymorphic sites (double peaks) were observed in any of the ssu rRNA or gp60 sequences analysed. Fig. 2 shows the phylogenetic relationship among C. parvum sub-genotypes at the gp60 locus produced by the Neighbour-Joining method. As expected, the two IIaA16G2R1 sequences generated in the present study grouped together in a well-defined cluster with previously reported bovine isolates belonging to the sub-genotype family IIa.
