The scales of per-residue evolutionary change in nidoviruses and the Tree of Life are comparable Nidoviruses have evolved genomes in a size range that accounts for the upper ,60% of the entire RNA virus genome size scale and include the largest RNA genomes [10] . What did it take to produce this unprecedented innovation in the RNA virus world? This question could be addressed in two evolutionary dimensions: time and amount of substitutions. Due to both the lack of fossil records and high viral mutation rates, the time scale of distant relations of RNA viruses remains technically difficult to study.
