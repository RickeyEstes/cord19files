In this study, known genotypes of thirty CPV-2 fecal samples and two vaccine samples were used to establish the method. The results showed that the developed duplex FMCA assay using dual-labeled, self-quenching probes could identify original CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2b, CPV-2c, and vaccine strains CPVpf and CPVint based on the Tm values and the type of fluorescence of the melting peaks, as shown in Figures 1B,C. For each sample, two Tm values were obtained from the HEX and FAM channels, corresponding to probe P1 and P2, respectively. In the HEX channel, strains CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c were clustered together with Tm values of 50.01 ± 0.26 • C, 49.91 ± 0.29 • C, and 49.82 ± 0.19 • C, respectively; the original CPV-2 and CPVpf strains were clustered together with Tm values of 55.10 ± 0.04 • C and 55.17 ± 0.25 • C, respectively. These two clusters were easily differentiated from each other by their Tm values. In this channel, the vaccine strain of CPVint was also readily distinguished from other strains based on the broader melting peak shape ( Figure 1B) . In the FAM channel, strains CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c were separate from each other, with the Tm values of 58.37 ± 0.30 • C, 51.87 ± 0.31 • C, and 48.85 ± 0.36 • C, respectively. The original CPV-2 and CPVpf strain were also separate from each other, with the Tm values of 58.42 ± 0.07 • C and 52.47 ± 0.33 • C, respectively. In this channel, although the vaccine strain of CPVpf yielded a Tm value of 52.47 ± 0.33 • C, which was only 0.60 • C higher than that of CPV-2b, the Tm difference between them was 5.16 • C in the HEX channel. Thus, it was obviously feasible to distinguish all of the different CPV strains based on Tm differences and melting curve shapes in the HEX and FAM channels.
