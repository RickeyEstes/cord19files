Sampling and site characterization. A bat (identifier [ID] OTBA03-20130220) was trapped on 20 February 2013 in the Nkuringo area of Kisoro District, in southwestern Uganda (latitude Ϫ1.12, longitude 29.68) (Fig. 1) . This area is an established settlement of villages comprising approximately 15,000 inhabitants adjacent to the southwestern boundary of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Communities include subsistence farmers growing small crops, with some members working inside the national park or supporting tourism-related businesses. Livestock, including cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and poultry, are present in the village and are raised on a small scale primarily for local consumption. The sampled bat weighed 3.0 g and had a forearm length of 25 mm (Fig. 1 ). It was identified as Pipistrellus cf. hesperidus based on 95% sequence identity in the cytochrome b (Cytb) gene. The cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) was also sequenced, but no corresponding CO1 sequences for P. hesperidus were available in GenBank for comparison. We therefore relied on the Cytb sequence for species identification. Discovery and sequence characterization. The oral swab, rectal swab, and whole blood of bat OTBA03-20130220 were assayed for the presence of coronavirus by consensus PCR (cPCR). Two separate assays were used, each targeting a different region of the ORF1b RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Bands of the expected size were amplified from the rectal swab (PDF-2180) by both assays and confirmed to represent viral products by traditional Sanger dideoxy sequencing. Both fragments showed Ͼ98% amino acid sequence identity to MERS-CoV, prompting further characterization of the virus. The oral swab and blood were negative. The near-full-length genome (identified as PREDICT/PDF-2180) was assembled from 100-nucleotide (nt) Illumina single-end reads at an average depth of 26ϫ. Only the 5= and 3= noncoding regions were left incomplete. The order of all predicted open reading frames (ORFs) was consistent with MERS-CoV and with the recently described NeoCoV (KC869678) identified in a bat from South Africa. Similarly, the hexanucleotide transcription regulatory sequence (AACGAA) was conserved and found in the same position as both MERS and NeoCoV upstream of each predicted ORF. Across the full genome, the sequence had 86.5% amino acid identity to MERS-CoV and 91% to NeoCoV; however, considerable variation was observed in different genes. Uganda MERS-Like Virus in Bats ® Amino acid identity could be as high as 97% to both MERS-CoV and NeoCoV in ORF1b or as low as 45% to MERS-CoV in subunit 1 of the spike protein. For the full spike protein, identity was 94% to NeoCoV and 63% to MERS-CoV. Percent sequence identity of the spike protein (subunits 1 and 2) to other 2c viruses is shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Based on the current criteria for species demarcation established by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses (Ͼ90% amino acid sequence identity in the replicase proteins), PREDICT/PDF-2180 shares sufficient genetic identity to MERS-CoV to be considered a member of the MERS-like Coronavirus species. Phylogenetic analysis. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstructions showed that PREDICT/PDF-2180 is most closely related to NeoCoV (Fig. 2) . The two viruses were basal or formed sister clades to MERS-CoV in all genes except subunit 1 of the spike. The full-genome alignment was scanned for recombination using seven different algorithms (RDP, GENECONV, Bootscan, MaxChi, Chimaera, SiScan, and 3seq) implemented in RDP v4.46. A single recombination event was detected within the spike gene by RDP, Bootscan, MaxChi, Chimaera, SiScan, and 3seq (Bonferroni-corrected P of ϽϽ0.001), suggesting that the incongruent phylogenies observed between spike subunit 1 and the rest of the genome are the result of recombination. Attempts to date the divergence of these two viruses to estimate the "minimum" number of years since this recombination were prevented by evidence of strong negative (purifying) selection across the genome (Fig. 2) . Given that purifying selection can confound true phylogenetic depth, we felt that attempts to estimate the number of years to common ancestry were inappropriate and would result in artificially "recent" dates. Zoonotic potential of PREDICT/PDF-2180. The high genetic variability in subunit 1 suggests that human and bat strains of MERS have different receptor binding properties. To investigate this, we modeled the specific affinity of the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein for the human MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 (27) . We utilized the crystal structure of the MERS-CoV spike binding domain in complex with DPP4 to create a homology model for the comparable region of the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike (Fig. 3) . Previous work has demonstrated 11 specific amino acid residues in MERS-CoV that (28) . Of these residues, only one is conserved for PREDICT/PDF-2180. To determine whether the binding interactions may be conserved between DPP4 and PREDICT/PDF-2180 regardless of the differences in amino acid residues at these positions, we analyzed the predicted interactions between PREDICT/PDF-2180 and DPP4, compared to MERS-CoV and DPP4. Overall, we found a global reduction in predicted hydrogen bonding interactions in the DPP4-PREDICT/ PDF-2180 binding interface compared with DPP4-MERS-CoV (Fig. 3) . While the interactions in conserved residue Y499 were maintained, DPP4 interactions with PREDICT/ PDF-2180 residues 501, 502, 510, 511, 513, 539, and 542 were disrupted. The interaction between DPP4 Y322 and MERS D510 is abolished in the PREDICT/PDF-2180 prediction, where D510 is replaced by K510. This is a charge change from negative to positive. Interestingly, a change from R511 in MERS to D511 in PREDICT/PDF-2180 facilitates a potential interaction with Y322 to replace the hydrogen bond lost with K510. Regardless, due to the predicted loss of the majority of the DPP4 binding interactions, the model predicts that PREDICT/PDF-2180 will not bind to DPP4. To confirm these results in vitro, a recombinant MERS-CoV cDNA clone was constructed containing the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike gene in the context of the full-length MERS-CoV backbone. The chimeric virus maintains the entire ectodomain of the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike with the exception of the first 20 amino acids of the 5= end, which were taken from wild-type MERS-CoV. Similarly, the transmembrane domains (TMDs) and cytoplasmic tail of the chimeric virus used the wild-type MERS-CoV sequence in order to minimize incompatibility in virion formation. Following transfection into Vero cells, PCR amplification of leader-containing transcripts for all of the expected nested subgenomic (sg) mRNAs (including the sg spike mRNA) confirmed replication of the recombinant virus (Fig. 4) . However, subsequent passages by supernatant transfer to uninfected monolayers failed to reproduce the infection, suggesting that the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein is unable to mediate cell entry in Vero cells as seen with wild-type MERS-CoV (Fig. 4) . (Fig. 5A) . Similarly, viral RNA expression analysis indicated no evidence of replication following infection with the PREDICT/PDF-2180 chimeric virus (Fig. 5B) . In contrast, wild-type
