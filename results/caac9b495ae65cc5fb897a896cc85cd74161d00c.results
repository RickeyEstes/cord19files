One hundred forty-five patients diagnosed with pandemic A(H1N1) infection from the period since the beginning of the epidemic in Hong Kong were included. Sixty-one (42%) were male patients. Seventy-six patients (52.4%) were aged , 18 years but none were aged , 1 year. Twenty-seven patients (18.6%) who refused treatment were enrolled as cases and 118 (81.4%) patients who received oseltamivir were controls. Refusals were related to fear of possible side effects of oseltamivir despite counseling by attending clinicians. None had diabetes mellitus or chronic obstructive airway disease. Only two (1.4%) patients had mild pneumonic changes over right middle and lower lobes on chest radiograph, respectively. None had evidence of rhabdomyolysis, myocarditis, or encephalitis. The nontreated and treated patients were comparable in demographics, comorbidity, presenting symptoms, and initial laboratory parameters ( Table 1 ) . Oseltamivir was initiated on the same day (16/118, 13.6%), 1 day (40/118, 33.9%), 2 days (27/118, 22.9%), 3 days complications, such as pneumonia or otitis media, when initiated within 36 h of symptom onset in seasonal infl uenza A. 13, 14 It can be easily administered orally and is the only safe drug in patients with asthma. 15 The evidence of its effectiveness for the treatment of pandemic A(H1N1) remains uncertain. The current recommendations were based on the assumption that pandemic A(H1N1) will have similar biologic characteristics as seasonal infl uenza A/H1N1 viruses. 15 We compared the viral load profi le of the fi rst group of pandemic A(H1N1)-infected patients with or without oseltamivir treatment in Hong Kong.
