The framework for the ethical evaluation of the PH programs was developed by the following three sections: (i) determination of the general moral norms in PH practice and policy; (ii) five steps of evaluation; and (iii) a procedural evaluation process for fair decision-making. Table 1 shows the list of general moral norms that should guide ethical analysis. The starting point for any ethical analysis is the use of these criteria. In evaluating a PH policy or plan, all or some of these criteria may be applied, and some additional criteria may be required for specialist areas.
