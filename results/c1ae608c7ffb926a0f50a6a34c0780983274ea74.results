Our data consists of 34 male cases, 24 female cases and 1 unidentified gender case from ten regions in China. All 59 cases have complete epidemiological descriptions about the history of exposure. The total 57 cases have complete information in age and gender One case from Beijing has unknown age. The mean and standard deviation of age are 41.9 and 13.2 years old. The mode of his dataset is 4.0 with 14 support cases. The minimum and maximum age are 10 and 70 respectively. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

It indicates that the incubation period median and mean of patients more than 40 years old are greater than those of patients less than 40 years old. Similar patterns are also observed for male and female groups. The mean values are always larger than median values for each group suggests the rightskewed distributions of incubation. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We employ Shapiro-Wilk tests rather than Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to conduct normality tests because we only have 59 records and Shapiro-Wilk tests can do a much better job on small datasets with a sample size of from 3 to 5000 [13] .

We can reject normal, lognormal, and Weibull distributions strongly under the significance level of 0.05 cutoff [11] [12] . Although we can't reject Gamma distributions for its boundary line p-value (0.06086), it can be risky to use it to fit and estimate the distribution of the incubation period under a small sample size. We further employ the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) for the parameters of the gamma, conduct the goodness-fit test, and obtain p-value=8.6807e-04. As such, we only rely on nonparametric techniques in data analysis rather than use any pre-assumed distributions.
