Temporal trends of HIV and AIDS incidence Fig. 3 ). Changing patterns of HIV and AIDS incidence stratified by age 54.78% of all new diagnosed AIDS cases. In 2014, the corresponding proportions were 22.58 and 30.69%, respectively. However, the numbers of newly infected HIV and diagnosed AIDS cases unexpectedly increased among people aged 55 years or above between 2004 and 2014 (Fig. 4) . In order to further investigate the HIV and AIDS changing patterns associated with age, we divided age into 18 groups stratified by gender. The overall relative changes of reported HIV incidence among males and females were 1.12 (95% CI 1.11-1.14) and 1.10 (95% CI 1.06-1.13), respectively. Males and females had a similar changing pattern of HIV incidence ( Table 2 ). Most age groups experienced an increase in HIV infection from 2004 to 2014 (Fig. 5) . In males, the highest incidence of HIV infection in 2004 was found in people aged 30-34 years (5.02 per 100,000), but the relative increase was low (OR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00-1.05, p = 0.027). The largest relative increase was observed in men aged 80-84 (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.32-1.53), albeit the lowest incidence in 2004 (0.07 per 100,000). The highest incidence of HIV infection in 2004 was found in women aged 25-29 years (1.36 per 100,000), but the incidence remained stable in the study period (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.07). The highest relative increase was detected in women aged 75-79 (OR = 1.50, 95% CI 1.32-1.70) with the HIV infection incidence being 0.02 per 100,000 in 2004. For AIDS incidence, the relative increases in males and females were 1.31 (95% CI 1.26-1.36) and 1.22 (95% CI 1.17-1.28), respectively (Table 3 ; Fig. 5 ). All age groups except the age group of 10-14 years showed an increasing trend. In 2004, the highest AIDS incidence was found in people aged 30-34 years in both genders, but the relative increase was low for both males (OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.16-1.29) and females (OR = 1.16, 95% CI 1.11-1.23). The largest relative increase was observed in older people (age â‰¥ 55 years) for both sexes. In males, the largest OR was observed in the age group of 80-84 years (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.48-1.67). In females, the largest OR was detected in the age group of 70-74 years (OR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.41-1.58).
