In herd 1, 29 camels, including 2 calves, were sampled; 8 were sampled in October 2014, 9 in November 2014, 15 in January 2015 and 13 in February 2015. Animals had both swabs and serum collected, with the exception of one animal in November, one in January and one in February. The MERS-CoV RNA was not detected in any of the camels sampled from herd 1 ( Table 1 ). All the camels that were sampled had MERS-CoV antibody, thus indicating past infection. In herd 2, 70 dromedaries were sampled, including 16 calves ⩽ 2 years of age, 5 animals 3-5 years of age, 35 animals ⩾ 6 years of age and 14 animals of undetermined age. Ten camels were sampled The number of swabs and sera collected at each sampling occasion is detailed in Table 2 . The results are summarized in Table 3 . Both nasal and rectal swabs were collected, except where indicated in Table 2 . MERS-RNA was detected in nasal swabs from three dromedaries in November 2014 (Tables 2 and 3) , thus suggesting that this herd was infected with MERS-CoV. The corresponding rectal swabs were RT-PCR negative. The viral load in these three nasal swab specimens was 2.2 × 10 3 copies per mL (specimen F2-3); 0.7 × 10 3 copies per mL (specimen F2-33) and 1.4 × 10 3 copies per mL (specimen F2-51) ( Table 4 ). These three animals were seropositive in the sampling carried out in November and did not demonstrate fourfold increases in their antibody titers after infection (Tables 2 and 4 A 7675 nt region of the genome from the spike gene to the N gene was sequenced from the three positive samples (GenBank accession numbers KY706245-KY706247). These three sets of sequences were found to be identical to each other, thus suggesting that a single virus had been introduced into this herd. The sequences were closely related but not genetically identical to the MERS-CoV strain Riyadh/Riyadh179/2015 (GenBank accession no.: KT368875), which has been previously reported in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia ( Figure 1 ). In addition, a 1164 nt region of the N gene (28 650-29 814 nt of MERS-CoV genome) was sequenced from these three viruses and were found to be identical to each other. Phylogeny also confirmed that these viruses were identical and closely related to Riyadh/Riyadh179/2015 (data not shown). Pan-coronavirus RT-PCR detecting most known (and likely unknown) coronaviruses was negative.
