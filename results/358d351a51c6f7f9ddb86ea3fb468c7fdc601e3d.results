The SARS-CoV M gene stimulates beta interferon gene expression in the human embryonic kidney 293T cell line. The overexpression of the SARS-CoV M gene has been shown to upregulate the transcriptional level of IFN-␤ (26) . To further confirm the result, using either enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) or poly(I:C) as a negative or positive control, respectively, we demonstrated that M gene products specifically promoted IFN-␤ production, since cotransfection with M small interfering RNA (siRNA) completely abolished M-mediated IFN-␤ induction at both protein (Fig. 1A , comparing lanes 3 and 4) and mRNA ( Fig. 1B ) levels. Moreover, after a 48-h transfection, cell supernatants were collected and assayed for the presence of IFN-␤ by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Figure 1C clearly demonstrated that delivering pCMV-Myc-M into HEK293T cells specifically and significantly promoted the secretion of IFN-␤ into cell culture medium. In addition, the promoter sequence of IFN-␤ was placed upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter to generate the pGL3-IFN-␤-Luc construct. To test the specificity of M-mediated IFN-␤ induction, other viral envelope-associated genes such as the spike (S) and envelope (E) protein genes as well as the M mutant [M(V68A)] from the GZ50 isolate were also included (27) . The result of a dual-luciferase assay using the Renilla luciferase gene as a transfection control demonstrated that the SARS-CoV M gene rather than the S and E genes markedly increased IFN-␤ promoter activity (Fig. 1D) , whereas the valineto-alanine alteration at residue 68 of M protein completely abolished this induction, indicating that the specificity of M gene products played a role in this process. Consistent with these results, Western blotting and ELISA further validated the above observation ( Fig. 1E and F). To detect if the SARS-CoV M gene has a direct effect on NF-B activation, pCMV-Myc-M was cotransfected with pNFB-luc, which contained five copies of NF-B recognition sites, into HEK293T cells. The results of the dualluciferase assay revealed that the SARS-CoV M gene specifically and dramatically upregulated NF-B activity compared with the controls (Fig. 1G) . Moreover, M could mediate IFN-␤ induction in both dose-and time-dependent manner ( Fig. 1H and I) . Overall, the data strongly indicated that the SARS-CoV M gene product was sufficient to promote IFN-␤ gene expression. The SARS-CoV M gene product activates the IFN-␤ signaling pathway at or upstream of TBK1. To further confirm the above results, increased doses of the pCMV-Myc-M gene were transiently transfected into HEK293ET cells. The cell lysates prepared from the transfection were examined for the activation of the downstream modulator and/or effector molecules, such as TBK1, IRF3, and NF-B. Figure 2A clearly demonstrates that SARS-CoV M gene products not only enhanced the phosphorylation level of TBK1 but also promoted the activation of both NF-B p65 and IRF3, indicating that M gene products may stimulate IFN-␤ activation by promoting its enhanceosome activity. To further define the activation level of M-mediated IFN-␤ induction, specific siR-NAs that selectively targeted either TBK1 ( Fig. 2B and C) or IRF3 ( Fig. 2E and F) mRNAs were generated. Individually diminishing either TBK1 or IRF3 mRNA expression by siTBK1 or siIRF3 sig-nificantly reversed M-mediated IFN-␤ induction ( Fig. 2D and G, respectively), indicating that M-mediated IFN-␤ induction functions at a level at or above the signaling molecule TBK1. The SARS-CoV M gene product preferentially activates IFN-␤ production through Toll-like-receptor-related signaling pathways in HEK293ET cells. RLR and TLR are two main PRRs
