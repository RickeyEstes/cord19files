No mediastinal abnormality, pleural effusion and cavitation in the parenchymal lesion were observed on the chest radiographs. By univariate analysis, both the mean and maximal radiographic scores significantly correlated with fever, age, elevated white blood cell count, a decreased percentage (< 20%) of lymphocytes in the leukocyte count, lymphopenia, elevated LDH, the number of hospitalized days, the number of days of endotracheal intubation, and the level of retained arterial CO 2 ( Table 2 ). In addition, the maximal radiographic score also correlated with the severity of hypoxemia (p = 0.050) ( Table 2) . Using the Kruskal Wallis test, the mean as well as maximal radiographic scores significantly correlated with death and the presence of comorbid disease. The mean radiographic score of the patients who died, patients with comorbidities and without comorbidity were 11.12 2.56 (mean SD) and 6.31 5.69 and 2.89 2.55, respectively (p = 0.032). The corresponding values for the maximal radiographic score were 17.67 0.58, 9.67 8.09 and 6.00 5.00, respectively (p = 0.033) ( difference between the number of deaths and survival without comorbidity with respect to the mean as well as maximal radiographic score (p = 0.003 and p = 0.005, respectively) ( Table 4) . A forward stepwise multiple linear regression showed that the mean radiographic score correlated most significantly with the number of hospitalized days (p < 0.001), while the second most significant factor was the absolute lymphocyte count (p < 0.001) and the third most significant factor was the number of days of intubation (p = 0.025). The maximal radiographic score correlated best with the percentage of lymphocytes in the leukocyte count (p < 0.001). The second most significant factor was the number of hospitalized days (p < 0.001), and the third most significant factor was the absolute lymphocyte count (p = 0.13) ( Table 5 ).
