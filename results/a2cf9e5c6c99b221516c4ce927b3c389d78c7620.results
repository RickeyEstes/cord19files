IFITMs inhibit HIV-1 production. We first wanted to confirm if IFITMs affect the production of HIV from virus producing cells as noted in previous reports 10, 12, [14] [15] [16] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . We used a co-transfection scheme in which we co-transfected HEK293T cells with plasmids containing HIV-1 proviral DNAs together with expression vectors encoding human IFITM1-3, allowing the effects on virus production to be studied independently of effects of IFITM proteins on viral entry. The quantity of virus produced was then analyzed by supernatant p24 ELISA and reverse transcriptase activity assays. Increasing levels of IFITM expression decreased HIV-1 NL4-3 output in a concentration-dependent manner consistent with loss of intracellular p55 and p24 levels (Fig. 1A,B) , with a similar decrease seen in supernatant when both p24 concentration (Fig. 1C ) and reverse transcriptase activity (Fig. 1D) were measured. Notably, the expression of IFITM1 and IFITM2 reduced the HIV-1 output while the effect was weaker for IFITM3. We then studied the effect of IFITMs on other viral proteins, and found IFITM1 and IFITM2 expression led to a reduction in the levels of all HIV-1 NL4-3 proteins assayed in transfected cells (Fig. 1E ). Similar to HIV-1 NL4-3, viral production from the HIV-1 plasmid proviral DNAs 89.6 and Indie-C1 was also reduced by IFITM expression (Fig. 1C,D) . In addition to HIV-1, the expression of IFITMs also reduced the quantity of virus produced from cells transfected with plasmid proviral DNAs for HIV-2 and SIVs ( Fig. S1A and S1B). Of note, HIV-2 ROD and SIV AGM appeared to be less susceptible to this IFITM-mediated effect compared to the HIV-1 viruses studied. We also found similar inhibitory effects upon HIV-1 with transfected African Green Monkey IFITM1 (Fig. S1C) . We were concerned however that the loss of viral production we saw might be due to generic inhibition of protein production during IFITM expression, but detection of GFP from a transfected reporter plasmid as measured by flow cytometry was not significantly affected by IFITM expression (Fig. 1F ). While similar experiments using a plate reader showed even highly overexpressed IFITMs minimally affected GFP levels ( Figure S2A ), suggesting the strong inhibition in virus production we observed (Fig. 1A -E) might be specific. Further, expression of GFP or control vector did not influence virus production ( Figure S2B -C) or IFITM activity ( Figure S2D -E) suggesting the block to virus production is not due to generic overexpression artefact. We also measured the infectivity of the virus produced from IFITM-expressing cells, in TZM-bl cells and showed that virus produced have lower infectivity (Fig. 1G ), in agreement with previous results [14] [15] [16] . We noted that levels of IFITM proteins in transfected HEK293T cells were often higher than those seen in type-I interferon treated CD4+ T-cells and monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) ( Figure S3 ) and so we next investigated the influence of IFITM proteins in cells in which levels of expression could be inducibly expressed. We also wanted to test if IFITMs inhibit viral production in infected cells rather than provirus transfected cells. As such we infected SupT1 cells expressing doxycycline inducible IFITM1-3 with wild type NL4-3 virus 10 . To avoid the well documented inhibition of virus entry by IFITMs playing a role in our experiments, after spinoculation, unbound virus was washed off and cells were resuspended in new medium containing doxycycline and the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 to induce IFITM expression only after virus entry and to limit viral replication to a single round respectively. Complete entry blockade by AMD3100 was confirmed with pre-treatment of cells ( Figure S3A ). The quantity of wild type HIV-1 produced by IFITM-expressing T-cells was inhibited across a range of viral inputs ( Fig. 2A) and was paired with losses in all viral protein levels ( Fig. 2B ,C). Though collectively this indicates that IFITMs inhibit viral production independent of their effects on viral entry. Notably, the levels of doxycycline induced IFITM were similar to those found in type I interferon treated CD4+ T-cells and monocyte derived macrophages ( Figure S3B , C,E). We next wished to investigate this effect using knockdown of endogenous IFITM levels to avoid overexpression artefact, and to assess the relative contribution of IFITMs towards inhibition of viral production that is observed with type I interferon (IFN) treatment. We therefore analyzed viral output from HIV-1 NL4-3 plasmid proviral DNA transfected and IFN-β treated TZM-bl cells that had been transduced with shRNAs targeting different IFITMs 28 . Infection of cells with virus produced during transfection was inhibited through the use of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100, and thus the level of viral output in our analysis cannot be confounded by entry inhibition due to IFITM expression. The efficiency of knockdown in IFITM expression was confirmed by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies specific for individual IFITMs (Fig. 3A) . As anticipated, IFN-β treatment reduced viral production in HIV-1 transfected TZM-bl cells (Fig. 3B ). Despite some weak knockdown cross-reactivity, such that shRNA targeting IFITM1 caused weak knockdown of IFITM2 (Fig. 3A) , and that it was not possible to knockdown IFITM3 in isolation, knockdown of both IFITM1 and IFITM2 clearly rescued the level of virus produced in IFN-β treated cells (Fig. 3C) . Further, knockdown of all three IFITMs gave a higher rescue, indicating that the inhibitory effects of IFITM1 and IFITM2 on viral production are perhaps non-redundant in the context of HIV-1 replication. These effects were paired with rescue of all viral proteins levels during IFITM knockdown (Fig. 3D ,E). Knockdown of IFITMs rescued viral protein production by around 1.5 to 3.5 fold, and so is concordant with viral production rescue of 2.0 to 2.5-fold. These data then show that endogenous levels of IFITMs can inhibit viral particle output and that our prior results in HEK293T transfections and SupT1 infections are not an overexpression artefact. They also suggest that IFITMs are a significant component of the antiviral response induced by type I interferon, as the 7-fold restriction of virus production seen on IFN-β ( Fig. 3B ) can be reduced to 3.5-fold upon IFITM1-3 knockdown (Fig. 3E) . We next sought to confirm if the knockdown of physiologically relevant levels of IFITMs in HIV-1 infected primary cells could rescue viral protein production. Primary human CD4 + T cells were infected with HIV-1 following transduction with lentiviral particles for the expression of shRNAs targeting different IFITMs. Transduction with one shRNAs resulted in a specific ~90% downregulation of IFITM2 (though combined with IFITM1 and IFITM3 upregulation), while another shRNA led to a ~50% downregulation of all three IFITMs ( Fig. 4A-C) . We were unable to specifically knockdown IFITM1 with reasonable efficiency. To mitigate the effects of IFITMs inhibiting viral entry on our studies of inhibited viral production, we took advantage of recent observations showing that different IFITM proteins vary in their inhibition of viral entry depending on HIV-1 co-receptor usage 16, 22, 23 . IFITM1 inhibits entry of CCR5-tropic viruses and IFITM2/3 predominantly inhibits CXCR4-tropic viruses. We therefore studied viral production effects driven by IFITM2 and IFITM3 with dual-tropic HIV-1 89.6, wherein cells were treated with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 prior to and during infection. AMD3100 treatment would direct viral entry via CCR5 due to CXCR4 blockade and thus mitigate entry inhibition by either IFITM2 or IFITM3. We used intracellular p24 staining of infected cells in single cycle infections to measure uptake of virus after infection with trypsin treatment to remove cell surface bound virus ( Figure S4 ) [29] [30] [31] . Although cellular uptake of viral p24 is not an exact measure of virus entry due to the uptake of virus into potentially non-productive endocytic pathways, p24 uptake is commonly found to be inhibited by IFITM expression 14, 15, 25, 26 , while endocytic uptake of virus occurs at a lower rate in primary CD4 + T-cells 32 . We confirmed that viral uptake was minimally impeded with these during IFITM knockdown (Fig. 4D ,E), consistent with prior observations 22 . Therefore reductions in virus production were considered to arise predominantly from IFITM-driven effects other than inhibition of viral entry. As such knockdown of IFITM2 led to a clear rescue of viral particle output (7-fold, Fig. 4F ) that was coupled with rescue in viral protein expression (Fig. 4G,H) , though this was in the context of somewhat elevated IFITM1 and IFITM3 levels (Fig. 4A) . Similarly, knockdown ScIenTIfIc REPORTS | (2018) 8:14551 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-32785-5 of IFITM1-3 led to rescue of viral protein production and viral particle output (>10-fold) (Fig. 4F ). Though IFITM1 which was depleted in this experiment can inhibit R5-tropic virus entry, thus a proportion of this latter result for IFITM1-3 may be attributable to weak IFITM1 driven entry inhibition, which was not the case for our data surrounding IFITM2-driven block to virus production. That inhibition of virus uptake was measurably weak (Fig. 4D ,E) suggests that viral production inhibition may be the dominant form of IFITM driven inhibition in this experiment. Overall, this confirms that physiologically relevant levels of IFITM proteins can clearly inhibit HIV-1 production in primary cells independent of their effects upon entry and infectivity, that this is not an overexpression artefact, and occurs in a manner that is consistent with our observations in cell lines. IFITMs restrict HIV-1 protein synthesis. As we found that IFITM expression was associated with losses in viral protein production and viral output, we next asked if IFITMs play a role in inhibiting the transcription or stability of viral mRNA by analyzing the level of unspliced, singly-spliced, and multiply-spliced transcripts detected by RT-qPCR from total RNA of whole cell lysates. IFITM1 and IFITM2 weakly reduced the levels of singly-spliced and multiply-spliced transcripts, while IFITM3 had no measureable effect (Fig. 5A ). The total level of unspliced transcripts remained unaffected in the presence of IFITM proteins ( Fig. 5A ) but nonetheless there were reductions of intracellular level of Gag (a product of unspliced transcripts) in our prior analyses (Figs 1-4) . This prompted us to investigate if IFITM proteins affect translation of viral transcripts. To achieve this we performed a polysome analysis for HIV-1 transcripts during IFITM expression. We first analyzed the RNA content in cell lysates fractionated on a sucrose gradient by ultracentrifugation. The total RNA profiles ( Fig. 5B ) recovered from selected fractions of virus producing cells expressing IFITMs are comparable to vector-transfected control, suggesting that IFITM expression did not alter global translation in the cell. We used the level of ribosomal protein L7 as a guide for selection of fractions in our analysis (Fig. 5C ) as it is a component of 60S ribosomes, which are enriched in 80S monosomes (such as fraction 10 Fig. 5C ) as well as polysomes (such as fractions [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The levels of GAPDH mRNA were not reduced in polysome fractions (Fig. 5D ). Reductions in the levels of viral transcripts in polysome fractions (in contrast to whole cell lysates - Fig. 5A ) would indicate specific translational inhibition. As such, we analyzed the level of viral transcripts in selected fractions covering the whole RNA profile with RT-qPCR. IFITM1 and IFITM2 significantly reduced the level of unspliced and singly-spliced viral transcripts in polysomes (Fig. 5E ,F) and increased the level of these transcripts in the ribosome-free fraction (fraction 6), suggesting that expression of IFITM1 and IFITM2 inhibited translation of these viral transcripts. IFITM1 and IFITM2 also appeared to somewhat reduce the level of multiply-spliced transcripts (Fig. 5G) , though the effect did not reach statistical significance, but was nonetheless coupled with a clear accumulation of ribosome-free multiply-spliced transcripts in low concentration sucrose fraction (Fig. 5G fraction 6) relative to vector control, similar to other viral transcript classes. These data were consistent with our analysis of viral production ( Fig. 1) wherein IFITM1 and IFITM2 expression lead to a more potent block in viral production than for IFITM3. Thus IFITM proteins inhibit translation of HIV-1 transcripts by leading to their specific exclusion from polysomes, resulting in reduced levels viral proteins and reduced viral output.
