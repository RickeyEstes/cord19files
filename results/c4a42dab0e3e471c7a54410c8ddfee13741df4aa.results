The literature search revealed a few case report studies on G6PD deficiency and its association with muscle G6PD activity and exercise ( Table 1) . Two of these articles report cases of G6PD individuals with clinical symptomatology following exercise [15, 16] whereas the other one, which describes the case of a world class runner, did not report any adverse results. Table 2 summarizes results from five experimental studies that examined the effects of exercise on various haematological and/or blood redox status indices [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . None of these methodologically sound experimental studies report unwanted results following different modes and types of exercise.
