During the study period, 418,693 children aged 0 18 years visited the Pediatric Emergency Department, of whom 108,555 (25.9%) had a body temperature >38 C. Two hundred and twenty-three patients with Henoch-Schonlein Purpura and 49 with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura hospitalized during the study period were excluded from the study. Sixty-nine (0.06% of the febrile children examined at the Pediatric Emergency Department) children with PRF were subsequently admitted to the pediatric departments and represent the study population (Table 1) . Of the 69 children with PRF, 30 (43.48%) and 9 (13.04%) suffered from a syndrome of bacterial or viral etiology, respectively. The remaining 30 (43.48%) had a syndrome where the final microbiological diagnosis could not be established. Viral PCR examination (from nasal washes and stool samples) was performed in all 9 patients diagnosed with a syndrome of probable viral etiology, and in 2/30 (6.66%) and 8 Fourteen (46.67%) patients suffered from a non-invasive bacterial disease (3, 2 and 9 cases of tonsillopharyngitis, acute bacterial gastroenteritis and Rickettsial disease, respectively). One patient had Group A streptococcus tonsillopharyngitis and a strong clinical suspicion of Rickettsial disease (negative serology). There were 9 cases of PRF with appropriate clinical picture and positive serology (IgG and IgM) for Rickettsia spp. Adenovirus, influenza B, parainfluenza, EBV, CMV, human metapneumovirus and enterovirus (3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 and 1 cases, respectively) represented the etiologic agents identified in the patients with viral etiology. One patient had a mixed infection caused by EBV together with serologically-proven Rickettsia spp. Of the 30 patients with PRF without a definitive microbiological diagnosis, 12 (40%) were discharged with a diagnosis of viral syndrome, 3 (10%) with acute otitis media, 4 (13.3%) with possible Rickettsial disease (negative serology) and 2 (6.67%) had a discharge diagnosis of "post-vaccination reaction". Seven (23.33%) of these patients received antibiotics in the community prior to hospitalization and had a discharge diagnosis of culture-negative septicemia without meningitis. Two (6.67%) of these patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and suspicion of scarlet fever, respectively. One patient was diagnosed during hospitalization with acute leukemia. Table 2 describes the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients with PRF in relation to their bacterial or proven viral etiology. The patients with bacterial etiology were older than those with viral etiology (p Z 0.02). No differences were recorded between the group with bacterial etiology and the group with viral etiology in patient distribution among the three age subgroups (0e1, 1e3 and >3 years) and seasonal distribution of cases. No differences were recorded between the patients with bacterial etiology vs. those with viral etiology in terms of gender, ethnicity and diagnoses at discharge. Two (12.5%) of the patients with proven meningococcal disease received prior antibiotic treatment in the community. Fifteen (50%) of the patients in the group with bacterial etiology and 2 (22.2%) from the group with viral etiology had a fever >39 C at admission. Twenty (66.7%) of the 30 patients with bacterial etiology looked ill at admission, compared with only 2/9 (22.2%) of those with viral etiology (p Z 0.03). More patients with viral etiology had rhinorrhea compared with those with bacterial etiology. Of a total of 18 patients who patients, together with Vancomycin in 3 patients and together with Doxycycline in 1 patient). In the group of patients with proven Rickettsial disease, Doxycycline alone was administered in 7 patients and in combination with other antibiotics in 2 additional patients. Seven (77.8%) of the 9 patients with PRF of viral etiology received antibiotic treatment at admission (Ceftriaxone and Doxycycline in 6 and 1 of them, respectively). Table 3 compares the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the 30 patients with bacterial etiology and those
