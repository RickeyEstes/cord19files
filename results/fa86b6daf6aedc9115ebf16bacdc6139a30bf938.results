Presence of an embryonic sac and ability to distinguish embryo, embryonic organs and placenta were evaluated. Findings were correlated with the overall development of the fetus, as previously described by other authors (Theiler 1989; Witschi 1972; Ypsilantis et al. 2009 ). The characteristic features unique for each day were noted and are summarized in Table 1 . With D0 considered the day of detection of sperm in the vaginal smear, ultrasound examination was performed daily starting from D7. The pregnancy was first detected by ultrasound on D8 (Fig. 1a) . The only visible structure was the embryonic sac, which appeared as a round to oval structure filled with anechoic to isoechoic fluid. There was no evidence of the embryo. The placenta was first evident on D9 (Fig. 1b) , as a hyperechoic zonar structure attached in the inner surface of the gestational sac. On D10, the fetus became distinguishable and the heart was also obvious with color Doppler signal (Fig. 1c) . The cardiac pulse appeared on the same day, but the heart rate could not be measured with pulse wave Doppler. On D11, the heart was clearly visible with B-mode imaging, but heart rate could not be estimated (Fig. 1d) . The next day D12, the amniotic fluid was visible and cardiac function was evaluated with pulse wave Doppler (Fig. 1e) . The tail could be distinguished and the fetal extremities were apparent on D13 (Fig. 1f) . The four chambers of the heart and the umbilical cord were also visible on D13. From D14 onward, the body and head became increasingly distinguishable as the embryo was bent dorsally, the snout lifted from the chest and the medullary tube was visible (Fig. 1g) . The body uncoiled and there was clear separation between the head and body at D15, along with cranial ossification. The urinary bladder was also visible on D15 (Fig. 1h) . On D16, osseous tissue started to develop, especially at the body ends, with clear discrimination of the phalanges. The ribs started to develop, and eye sockets were visible. D16 was also the first day the liver became visible (Fig. 1i ). Brain ventricles became detectable on D17, along with the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Ossification of the spine and ribs was in progress, whereas the phalanges were clearly ossified (Fig. 1j) . On D18, the heart ventricles became evident, while ossification of the spine and ribs continued. The liver and other abdominal organs were also distinguishable (Fig. 1k) . Finally, on D19, the jaw bone could be differentiated from the rest of the skull and the kidneys were also discernible (Fig. 1l) .
