Twenty-one outbreaks occurred during the study period ( Table 1 ). The mean number of facility-wide hand hygiene events was 22,025 in the weeks leading up to outbreaks, 21,760 in the 8-14 day periods prior to outbreaks (control 1), and 21,759 in the 15-21 day periods prior to outbreaks (control 2). There was no difference in hand hygiene frequency in the week leading up to an outbreak versus control weeks (odds ratio [OR], 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.001 using control 1 and OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.00-1.001 using control 2). There was also no association with the percent difference in hand hygiene frequency between case and control weeks and the odds of an outbreak: a 5% difference in hand hygiene frequency produced ORs of 1.5 (95% CI, 0.67-3.49) for control 1 and 1.2 (95% CI, 0.74-1.90) for control 2.
