Although OTU richness did not equal any values generated using the PID histograms, 45 OTUs is within the range of OTUs generated using the lower-level taxonomic cutoff (i.e. 42 -47 OTUs at 90 -93% PID cutoff), suggesting this cutoff is more strongly supported by affinity propagation than is the higher-level cutoff. Additionally, no two described herpesvirus species were greater than 90% similar. However, Ateline herpesvirus 3 and Saimirine herpesvirus 2, two gammaherpesvirus species, and Cercopithecine herpesvirus 5 and Macacine herpesvirus 3, two betaherpesvirus species, differed by 83.6% and 78.5%, respectively. Additionally, two strains of Human herpesvirus 6, a betaherpesvirus, and Human herpesvirus 4, a gammaherpesvirus, differed by 96.2 and 99.1%, respectively. These PIDs of established viral species further support the use of the lower-level taxonomic cutoff. To refine the exact number of OTUs, two neighbor-joining trees were generated from the exemplar sequences, as determined using affinity propagation, one for the gammaherpesviruses and one for the betaherpesviruses. (Figure 2 ). When exemplar sequences were greater than 90% similar (the most conservative cutoff within the lower taxonomic range), clusters were merged to represent a single OTU. Additionally, each OTU represented by a single occurrence (i.e. a single clone sequence) was examined individually. If the singleton sequence was greater than 74% similar to the exemplar of another OTU, the least conservative cutoff point demonstrated by PID histograms, it was clustered with that OTU. Singleton sequences less than or equal to 74% similar to each of the other exemplars were considered to be unique OTUs. After refinement, 41 OTUs remained.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/856518 doi: bioRxiv preprint No OTU existed at a prevalence greater than 6.2% in the entire host community (i.e. across all host species). When viral metacommunities were examined at the level of host population (i.e. in a single species), however, OTU prevalence reached a peak of 26.3% (OTU 17 in A. jamaicensis; Table 2 ). At the population-level, four OTUs reached a prevalence greater than 20%, and 29 OTUs existed at prevalence values between 1% and 10%. Five OTUs existed at a prevalence less than 1% in all of their host populations. OTU richness per host population ranged from three to 15. In comparison, humans are the only host species for which comprehensive data are available on total herpesvirus richness, and only eight known herpesvirus species infect humans, despite their cosmopolitan distribution.
