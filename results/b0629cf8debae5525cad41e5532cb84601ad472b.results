The black arrowhead and black circle represent the T7 promoter sequence and T7 terminator sequence, respectively. accumulation in MHV-infected cells coexpressing complete negative-strand DI RNA transcripts and its complementary positive-strand DI RNA transcripts was compared with that in infected cells expressing complete negative-strand DI RNA transcripts alone. We expected a certain population of the coexpressed RNA transcripts to form ds RNA structures using complementary sequences. If negative-strand DI RNA, in such a ds RNA structure, is a better template for positive-strand DI RNA synthesis, then the amount of DI RNA in coexpressing cells might be higher than that in cells expressing negative-strand DI RNA transcripts alone. If full-length positive-strand DI RNA and full-length negative-strand DI RNA are coexpressed, accumulated DI RNAs should be derived from both expressed template RNAs, since DI RNA synthesis starts from both expressed positivestrand transcripts (Lin and Lai, 1993) and expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts (Joo et al., 1996) . To identify DI RNAs that were initially synthesized from the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts, nucleotide sequences at a specific region of positive-strand DI RNA transcripts were mutated, whereas the corresponding region in the negative-strand DI RNA had no such mutation. DI RNAs that were initially synthesized from the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts should be detected using an oligonucleotide probe that specifically hybridized with the sequence specific for the expressed negative-strand DI RNA. As a parental plasmid encoding positive-strand DI RNA transcripts, we constructed DIU, in which a fulllength positive-strand DI RNA sequence was placed between a T7 promoter and a T7 terminator in a plasmid (Fig. 1B) . DIU had 11 nucleotides substituted within the unique 30-nt region from nucleotide 487 to 516 (Fig. 1B) of the naturally occurring MHV-JHM DI RNA, DIssE (Makino et al., 1988a ). First, we tested the feasibility of using DIU for coexpression studies. DIU was transfected into cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus, vTF7-3, which expresses the T7 polymerase (Fuerst et al., 1986) . Four hours after DIU transfection, cells were infected with MHV-A59 and intracellular RNA was extracted 10 h postinfection (pi) of MHV. To test if the accumulated DI RNA maintained the unique 30-nt region, we performed Northern blot analysis of intracellular RNA using probe 3 (Fig. 1B, Table 1 ), which specifically hybridizes with the unique 30-nt region of DIU, and probe 1 (Fig. 1C , Table 1 ), which specifically hybridizes with the corresponding region of wild-type (wt) sequence (wt 30-nt region). Stringent conditions were set up for the oligonucleotide probe binding to the specific DI RNAs such that probe 1 did not hybridize with in vitro synthesized DIU at all, and probe 3 did not hybridize with in vitro synthesized positive-sense RNA containing the wt 30-nt region. We found that approximately half the accumulated DI RNAs contained the wt 30-nt region, and the rest contained the unique 30-nt region (data not shown). RNA recombination between helper virus and the replicating DI RNAs most probably caused the accumulation of DI RNA containing wt 30-nt region. Generation and accumulation of DI RNA containing wt 30-nt region after expression of DIU indicated that we could not easily identify the origin of the accumulated DI RNA containing wt 30-nt region, after coexpression of DIU and negativestrand DI RNA transcripts, containing wt 30-nt region. Thus DIU was not suitable for cotransfection studies. Next we examined whether DI RNA synthesis from negative-strand DI RNA transcripts is enhanced by the coexpression of a positive-strand RNA fragment that contains only the 5Ј region of the DI RNA. We hoped that the partial-length positive-strand DI RNA transcripts would hybridize with the 3Ј region of the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts to create a ds RNA region which would promote efficient positive-strand DI RNA synthesis. Four DIU-derived clones, DIU-Nru, DIU- Spe, DIU-Sph, and DIU-Eag, were constructed, which had a 2.0-, 1.5-, 1.0-, and 0.7-kb-long 5Ј-end region of DIU, respectively (Fig. 1B ). All these clones contained the unique 30-nt region and their RNA transcripts should not replicate since they all lack the 3Ј cis-acting replication signal (Kim et al., 1993a; Lin et al., 1994) . Northern blot analysis using probe 1 showed that DI RNA, containing the wt 30-nt region, did not accumulate after expression of any of these DIU-derived clones in MHV-infected cells (see Fig. 2 , lanes 10 and 11 for DIU-Spe; data not shown for other clones), demonstrating that the expressed transcripts did not undergo RNA recombination to produce full-length DI RNA containing the wt 30-nt region. These clones were suitable for subsequent studies. Plasmid pDER was used to express negative-strand DI RNA transcripts (Joo et al., 1996) . In this plasmid, the DI-specific sequence was placed between the T7 promoter and T7 terminator such that T7 RNA polymerasemediated transcription produced negative-strand DI RNA transcripts, containing the wt 30-nt region (Fig. 1C ). Equal amounts of pDER plasmid and each of the DIU-derived plasmids, encoding the partial-length positivestrand DI RNA transcripts, were mixed and transfected into vTF7-3-infected cells. In a control group, pDER was mixed with equal amounts of plasmid pS5A (Woo et al., 1997) , which encodes the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene and no MHV-specific sequences ( Fig.  1D ) and then transfected. Total amount of DNA used for all the transfections was the same. DNA-transfected cells were infected with MHV and intracellular RNAs were extracted 10 h post-MHV infection. Northern blot analysis using probe 1 showed that in all cases DI RNAs containing the wt 30-nt region accumulated significantly higher in cells coexpressing pDER and positive-strand RNA fragments than in cells expressing pDER alone. Representative data from these experiments using pDER and DIU-Spe are shown in Fig. 2 . Since these DI RNAs contained the wt 30-nt region, they were most likely synthesized initially from the pDER transcripts. We performed these experiments at least five times for all DIUderived clones and obtained consistent results (data not shown). Although the enhancement effect differed slightly from experiment to experiment, phosphorimaging analysis of the membranes and densitometric analysis of autoradiograms showed that the level of enhancement was between 10-and 15-fold. There was no significant difference in the enhancement effect between the four DIU-derived positive-strand RNA fragments (data not shown). Additional bands that migrated between mRNA 1 and the expected DI RNA in Fig. 2 probably represented other MHV DI RNAs present in the MHV-A59 virus stock. Time-course experiments showed that this enhancement of DI RNA accumulation was evident from 6-12 h pi of MHV and that the best enhancement effect was obtained 10 h post-MHV infection (data not shown). Hence we chose this time point to extract intracellular RNA for subsequent experiments. Cotransfecting three-, six-, and ninefold excess DIU-derived positive-strand RNA fragments with a constant amount of pDER did not alter the enhancement effect significantly (data not shown). The possibility that full-length positive-strand DI RNA was initially synthesized by the elongation of the expressed partial-length positive-strand DI RNA transcripts using the coexpressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts as the template was tested by detecting fulllength positive-strand DI RNAs containing the unique 30-nt region in cells expressing pDER and DIU-Spe. Northern blot analysis using probe 3 revealed only a trace amount of DI RNA containing the unique 30-nt region in coexpressing cells (data not shown), confirming that the majority of full-length positive-strand DI RNAs were initially synthesized from pDER. To test whether enhancement of DI RNA accumulation by coexpressing negative-strand DI RNA transcripts and positive-strand RNA fragments was specific only for pDER, we performed the same cotransfection experi-FIG. 2. Northern blot analysis of accumulating DI RNAs from MHVinfected cells coexpressing negative-strand DI RNA transcripts and positive-strand RNA fragment, DIU-Spe. Recombinant vaccinia virus, vTF7-3-infected DBT cells were transfected with plasmid DNA and then superinfected with MHV-A59 or mock infected. Intracellular RNA was extracted 10 h post-MHV infection and separated on a 1% formaldehyde gel. Northern blot analysis was performed using probe 1, which specifically hybridizes with the positive-sense wt 30-nt region. Lane 1 represents in vitro synthesized DI RNA, containing wt 30-nt sequence. The arrowhead and arrow denote MHV mRNA 1 and DI RNA, respectively. Densitometric analysis of each autoradiograph was performed and is reported as fold increase below each lane (for calculation refer to Materials and Methods). ments using another plasmid pDER4, which also expresses negative-strand DI RNA transcripts; pDER and pDER4 differ slightly as pDER4 contains four non-MHV nucleotides at the 3Ј end of negative-strand RNA transcripts (Joo et al., 1996) (Fig. 1C) . We have previously demonstrated the accumulation of DI RNA after transfection of in vitro synthesized pDER4 transcripts into MHVinfected cells (Joo et al., 1996) . Figure 2 shows the accumulation of positive-strand DI RNA containing the wt 30-nt region in pDER4-expressing cells. The accumulation of positive-strand RNA in pDER4-and pDER-expressing cells was similar. Also, accumulation of DI RNA containing the wt 30-nt region was significantly enhanced by the coexpression of each of the four DIUderived, partial-length positive-strand transcripts with pDER4 transcripts (12-to 15-fold increase). Only representative data using pDER4 and DIU-Spe are shown in Fig. 2 . We performed five independent experiments using each of the four DIU-derived clones, DIU-Nru, DIU-Spe, DIU-Sph, and DIU-Eag, and consistently found the enhancement effect of DI RNA accumulation by coexpressing partial-length positive-strand DI RNA transcripts with pDER and pDER4 transcripts to be nearly identical. These studies demonstrated that coexpression of positive-strand RNA containing the 5Ј region of DI RNA with full-length negative-strand DI RNA transcripts enhanced DI RNA synthesis from the expressed negative-strand DI RNA transcripts. DIU-Spe was used for coexpression with pDER or pDER4 in subsequent studies, since all partial-length positive-strand DI RNA transcripts showed similar activity for enhancement of DI RNA accumulation from both the negative-strand DI RNA transcripts.
