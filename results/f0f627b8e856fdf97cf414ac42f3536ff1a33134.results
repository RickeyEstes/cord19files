The immunogenicity of the adjuvanted protein F4/AS01 ('P') and/or the recombinant adenoviral vector AdC7-GRN ('A'), when administered in homologous (PP or AA) or heterologous (AAPP or PPAA) prime-boost regimens, was evaluated in rhesus macaques, by assessing vaccine antigen-specific T-cell and humoral responses in peripheral blood. As a complementary analysis, we used similar homologous and heterologous prime-boost regimens to evaluate the localization of vaccine-induced responses in mucosal and systemic anatomical compartments in the mouse model. Data of the individual animals are presented in S1-S8 Tables. Prime-boost regimens with F4/AS01 and AdC7-GRN induce HIV-1-specific polyfunctional CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses in macaques HIV-1-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses were detected by flow cytometry. We first evaluated the immunogenicity of homologous prime-boost regimens. Two immunizations with F4/AS01 (at Weeks 0 and 4) elicited HIV-1-specific CD4 + T-cell responses in all vaccinated animals in the PP and PPAA groups (geometric means [95% confidence interval, CI] of 0.41% [0.24-0.69] and 0.48% [0.24-0.98], respectively at Week 6), while two AdC7-GRN immunizations (at Weeks 0 and 12) induced low or barely detectable CD4 + T-cell responses in the AA and AAPP groups (geometric means [95% CI] of 0.16% [0.11-0.23] and 0.07% [0.05-0.09], respectively, at Week 14; Fig 1A) . For both vaccine candidates, CD4 + T-cell responses following homologous prime-boost regimens peaked two weeks after the second immunization at Weeks 6 or 14, with HIV-1-specific CD4 + T-cell responses that were significantly higher for F4/AS01 than for AdC7-GRN (p<0.0001; Satterthwaite t-test). In contrast to the AdC7-GRNinduced responses, F4/AS01-induced CD4 + T-cell responses persisted at 6 months after the second immunization (Weeks 36 and 28 for the AA and PP groups, respectively). To evaluate the impact of heterologous prime-boost regimens, we compared the magnitudes of HIV-1-specific CD4 + T-cell responses before and after the heterologous booster immunizations in animals primed with two homologous vaccinations. The response after the two heterologous booster immunizations with F4/AS01 in AdC7-GRN-primed animals was not significantly different from that after two F4/AS01 immunizations in naïve animals (AAPP group at Week 30 vs PP/PPAA groups at Week 6; p>0.05; Fig 1A) . In F4/AS01-primed animals of the PPAA group, the priming-induced response initially declined from its peak in Week 6, but two heterologous booster immunizations with AdC7-GRN given at Weeks 16 and 28 (i.e., 3 and 6 months after the second priming immunization with F4/AS01) induced a slight recall of the response. The cytokine (IL-2/IFN-γ/TNF-α) expression profile of circulating HIV-1-specific CD40L + CD4 + T cells was characterized and compared between the four groups at 2 weeks post last immunization (Weeks 6, 14 or 30; Fig 1B) . Two weeks after the second priming immunization (Weeks 6 or 14), the proportion of HIV-1-specific polyfunctional (double-or triple-cytokineexpressing) CD40L + CD4 + T cells was significantly higher in AdC7-GRN-primed animals than in F4/AS01-primed animals (AA vs PP; p<0.0005; Fisher's exact test), although the total HIV-1-specific cytokine-expressing CD4 + T-cell response in the AA group was low (geometric mean [95% CI] of 0.16% [0.11-0.23] at Week 14) . In the PP group, the majority of F4/AS01-induced HIV-1-specific CD4 + T cells produced only IL-2, and smaller proportions of cells produced IL-2 in combination with TNF-α. Priming with AdC7-GRN had an influence on the cytokine expression profile. Specifically, F4/AS01 administration induced predominantly IL-2 + CD40L + CD4 + T cells (single-cytokine-expressing or IL-2 + TNF-α + cells) when given to naïve animals in the PP group, but predominantly IFN-γ + CD40L + CD4 + T cells (single-cytokine-expressing or IL-2 + IFN-γ + ) when given to AdC7-GRN-primed animals in the AAPP group. Moreover, the proportion of double-or triple-cytokine-expressing HIV-1-specific CD40L + CD4 + T cells was significantly higher after each of the two heterologous (AAPP or PPAA) prime-boost regimens than after F4/AS01 priming only (p = 0.0461 [AAPP vs PP] and p<0.0001 [PPAA vs PP]; Fisher's exact test). No circulating HIV-1-specific CD8 + T cells were detected in animals immunized with F4/ AS01 only, at any time-point evaluated (Fig 2A) . In contrast, the first AdC7-GRN immunization given to naïve animals induced HIV-1-specific CD8 + T-cell responses, which increased 2 weeks after the second AdC7-GRN immunization ( Two weeks after the last dose, the cytokine expression profiles of HIV-1-specific CD8 + T cells in the AA, PPAA and AAPP groups were not significantly different from each other ( Fig  2B; p>0.05; Fisher's exact test). The majority of specific CD8 + T cells expressed IFN-γ, either alone or in combination with TNF-α. CD3 + CD4 + T cells. Data are represented as group geometric mean frequencies. *: PPAA group: N = 8 at Weeks 0, 2 and 6, and N = 7 at all time-points thereafter. The dashed line indicates the assay cut-off value for CD40L + CD4 + T cells (i.e., 0.1%). B. The cytokine co-expression profile of F4-specific CD4 + T cells at 2 weeks post last immunization is presented for each prime-boost regimen. Data are reported as median frequencies of responding CD40L + CD4 + T cells expressing any combination of IL-2, IFN-and TNF-, with first and third quartiles measured. Pie charts represent the group mean proportions of responding CD40L + CD4 + T cells expressing (after in vitro stimulation) one, two or three cytokines (represented in light grey, dark grey and black, respectively) among IL-2, IFN-and TNF-. These group mean proportions were compared using Fisher's exact test and a significance level of p<0.05. The number in the center of each pie represents the geometric mean of the total percentage of cytokine-expressing CD40L + CD4 + T cells at 2 weeks post last immunization. A. PBMCs were stimulated in vitro overnight with a pool of peptides covering the F4 antigen sequence at several time-points, and production of IL-2, IFN-and TNF-was measured by ICS.
