During passage of the respiratory tract the bronchoscope will be contaminated by the normal flora of oral cavity, nasopharynx, trachea, bronchi, and pulmonary tissues. Whilst the oral cavity is the habitat for a great variety of bacteria, e.g. streptococci, lactobacilli, staphylococci, corynebacteria, and a great number of anaerobes, especially Bacteroides spp., the predominant species of the nasopharynx are nonhaemolytic and alpha-haemolytic streptococci and Neisseria spp. (Tables 1 4) . Sometimes potential pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis colonize the pharynx. 2 Correspondingly, in clinical specimens of the upper respiratory tract collected in the Heidelberg University Hospitals alpha-haemolytic streptococci (65 78%) and Neisseria spp. (26 39%) were the most frequently isolated organisms. The lower respiratory tract is virtually free of micro-organisms. 2 However, in ventilated patients trachea and bronchi can become colonized as the result of bypassing the efficient cleansing effect of the ciliated epithelium. Candida albicans, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), alpha-haemolytic streptococci and enterococci are frequently isolated from tracheal secretions of such patients. 2 This was also reflected in our laboratory results, with C. albicans (24 28%) and CNS (21 28%) being the most frequently isolated organisms. All micro-organisms that can cause infection of the mouth, the pharynx and the larynx, bronchitis or pneumonia in immunocompromised or otherwise healthy individuals are potential contaminants of bronchoscopes, e.g. bacteria, such as pneumococci, Pseudomonas spp. or Chlamydia spp.; mycobacteria; viruses, such as influenza virus or CMV; fungi, such as Aspergillus spp.; or parasites, such as Toxoplasma or Cryptosporidium (Tables 1 4) . 2 The bronchoscopic procedure can result in epithelial injury with subsequent bleeding. Therefore, all blood-borne pathogens, e.g. HIV, HCV or HBV are also potential contaminants of the bronchoscope. There are several reports of transmission or pseudo-outbreaks of micro-organisms due to incomplete or faulty cleaning and disinfection procedures of bronchoscopes. 3 63 These incidents include nearly all of the above mentioned classes of micro-organisms. Bacteria were responsible for 26 outbreaks or pseudo-outbreaks reported in the literature, 3 25 mycobacteria were discussed in 22 reports 26 57 and fungi in 6 reports. 58 63 Cross-infections due to parasites or viruses were not reported. However, the incubation period of viruses can be long and the association between bronchoscopy and infection may be obscure. Endospore-forming micro-organisms are not part of the normal flora of the respiratory tract and may rarely cause disease, e.g. pneumonia due to Bacillus cereus in severely immunocompromised patients or respiratory anthrax. No evidence for a transmission of Bacillus spp. by bronchoscopy has been reported so far. Table 5 summarizes the risk of contamination of bronchoscopes compared to the risk of infection due to different organisms and the actual occurrence of cross-infection or pseudo-outbreaks due to the micro-organisms.
