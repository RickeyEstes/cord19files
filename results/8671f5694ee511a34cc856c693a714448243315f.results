3.1. Genes, proteins and metabolites identified during the flowering period of L. japonica In order to determine the molecular phenotype of L. japonica during the flowering period, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses were performed. A total of 2715, 2700, 2536, 2441, and 2483 genes were identified in JBS, TGS, CWS, SFS, and GFS, respectively. The enriched genes were mainly related to functional categories of protein metabolism, transport, signaling, and RNA metabolism (Fig. 1 , Supplemental Table 2 ). During TGS, the number of genes related to protein metabolism, transport, cell wall, lipid metabolism, hormone metabolism, and DNA metabolism were increased compared with other developmental stages. The number of genes related to cell and secondary metabolism was gradually decreased with the progressing floral developmental stages. A total of 291, 280, 279, 256, and 224 proteins were identified in JBS, TGS, CWS, SFS, and GFS, respectively. Identified proteins were mainly enriched to functions of protein metabolism, photosynthesis, glycolysis, and TCA cycle (Fig. 1, Supplemental Table 3 ). The number of proteins related to photosynthesis and transport was gradually decreased and increased, respectively, during the progressive floral developmental stages. A total of 285, 283, 265, 248, and 251 metabolites were identified in JBS, TGS, CWS, SFS, and GFS, respectively. The identified metabolites were mainly enriched to the categories of organic acids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and alcohols ( Fig. 1 , Supplemental Table 4 ). Meanwhile, organic acids were significantly enriched in TGS. Fatty acids, esters, terpenoids, and alkaloids related metabolites were mainly enriched in JBS. The metabolites particularly related to fatty acids gradually decreased during the five floral development stages. 3.2. Pathway integration of identified genes, proteins, and metabolites related to cell wall, glycolysis, photosynthesis, and secondary metabolism Based on molecular functional categorization, the numbers of genes or proteins related to photosynthesis, glycolysis, cell wall, and secondary metabolism were significantly changed during the 5 floral developmental stages. For a better understanding of the physiological adjustment of flower development of L. japonica, the interactive biochemical networks were constructed through the pathway integration on KEGG database (Supplemental Figs. 1A-E) . The network was manually divided into 3 parts i.e. sugar metabolism, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and carbon conversion. The numbers of genes and proteins were significantly decreased in parts of sugar metabolism and lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. However, in carbon conversion part, the number of transcripts and proteins of pyruvate kinase (PK) was increased and decreased, respectively, with the development stages. Identified genes, proteins, and metabolites were linked to biosynthetic pathways of terpenoids, fatty acids, vitamin E, alkaloids, lignins, and phenylpropanoids (Supplemental Figs. 2A-E) . The numbers of genes involved in both phenylpropanoids and alkaloids biosynthesis pathways were significantly decreased during the floral development stages. However, genes of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXPPRI), solanesyl-diphosphate synthase (SDPPS), and phytoene synthase (PTST) were significantly increased after JBS. The genes of lycopene beta cyclase (LBCA), beta-amyrin synthase (BAST), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMCR) were upregulated in SFS and GFS compared with JBS and TGS. The identified secondary metabolism related proteins were mainly involved in phenylpropanoids and terpenoids biosynthesis pathways. Interestingly, a total of 5 proteins were identified in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathways which were not expressed in JBS. In phenylpropanoids biosynthetic pathways, 8-Hydroxygeraniol dehydrogenase (HDGD), beta-glucosidase (BGD), and chalcone synthase (CHS) was To get a comprehensive understanding of floral development at proteomic level, the expression profiles of all the identified proteins during the floral developmental stages were analyzed by PCA ( Fig. 2A) . Both the first and second principal components (PC1 (34.6%) and PC2 (19.7%)) explained the variance across the dataset. Furthermore, the late period (SFS and GSF) was well separated from the early period (JBS, TGS, and CWS) in PC1. In order to deeply reveal the potential variance in the floral period, the change of identified proteins among 5 developmental stages was evaluated by a multivariate statistical analysis using ANOVA approach. A total of 538 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were selected and employed for the further analysis (Supplemental Table 5 ). The Venn diagram was generated to show the overlap of the DAPs from 5 stages (Fig. 2B ). There were 242, 231, 229, 207, and 174 DAPs in JBS, TGS, CWS, SFS, and GFS, respectively. Among these DAPs, abundances of 51, 40, 47, 57 and 46 proteins were specifically changed during the JBS, TGS, CWS, SFS, and GFS, respectively.
