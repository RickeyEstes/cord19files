Serum IgG Purification Efficiency-To enable analysis by mass spectrometry, serum IgGs were purified using the PhyNexus automated purification system (Table 1) . To ensure that the purification process achieved maximal IgG recovery and optimal IgG quality, SDS-PAGE and AUC were used. We used naive serum to investigate the number of elution cycles required for full retrieval of the bound IgGs; SDS-PAGE was used to track the presence of IgGs in the samples from each of 10 consecutive elution steps. We found that IgGs could no longer be detected beyond the 5th elution cycle, suggesting that four elution steps were sufficient (data not shown). Thus, we used four elution steps throughout this study. Non-reducing SDS-PAGE analysis of the material from each of the purification steps showed that the ProPlus (protein A/G) resin effectively captured IgGs from the mouse sera (Fig. 1A) . Although the remaining flow-through and washing step solutions contained multiple bands, the eluted solutions showed a single band whose size corresponded to the typical IgG molecular mass of ϳ150 kDa. This result was confirmed using reducing SDS-PAGE, which revealed the presence of two bands with molecular weights corresponding to those of the heavy and light chains. The IgG bands from the four sequential elution cycles gradually decreased in signal intensity as expected. The pooled eluate, whose total collected volume was ϳ2 ml, was concentrated, and its purity and homogeneity were evaluated using AUC. Sedimentation velocity analysis showed that the sample contained 95% monomeric IgGs (Fig. 1B) . Detection Limit of Antigen-specific IgGs in Serum Using SPR-The concentration-dependent binding of IgG to human IL-13 was demonstrated by SPR using samples containing naive serum with various amounts of DL11 added. Because of the high concentration of endogenous IgGs, the serum samples were diluted 1000-fold prior to protein A/G capture. The total IgGs, which included both endogenous IgGs and DL11, were captured at a density of ϳ2000 RU. As expected, the binding response decreased with decreasing DL11 concentrations in the serum (Fig. 2) . The affinity of DL11 was determined to be ϳ24 (Ϯ8) pM, and saturation was achieved at 5 nM human IL-13. There was no difference in the maximal response level when 10 and 100 nM human IL-13 solutions were injected over identical IgG-containing surfaces (data not shown). The concentration limit at which antigen-specific IgGs were detected in serum was determined to be 250 ng/l, as signals Ͻ10 RU are considered to be background noise in this system. Using Equations 1 and 2, described under "Experimental Procedures," the percentage of DL11 antigen-specific IgGs among the total IgGs was calculated for each reconstituted sample. As shown in Table 2 , the lower limit of 250 ng/l corresponded to a concentration that was equivalent to ϳ10% of the total IgGs being human IL-13-specific DL11. Step-wise deposition to row E-H 50 2 1 3 Detection Limit of Antigen-specific IgG in Serum Using HDX-LC/MS-To determine the IgG-binding epitope on the antigen, the purified IgGs were subjected to HDX coupled with LC/MS. This method compares deuterium exchange levels at different regions of the antigen in the presence and absence of antibody and identifies those that are protected by the IgGs. First, a mock experiment using different concentrations of human IL-13 in the absence of IgGs was performed to determine the optimal concentration of protein that was required to ensure full sequence coverage of the protein. The results revealed that a concentration of 4 M yielded the highest sequence coverage (98%) (Fig. 3) . Thus, this concentration was used in the subsequent experiments using IgG samples. The epitope mapping experiment was performed by incubating the purified IgGs with human IL-13 as described under "Experimental Procedures." Deuterium uptake was compared in samples containing human IL-13 in the absence and pres-ence of DL11. Because hydrogen has a mass of 1.008 Da and deuterium has a mass of 2.014 Da, the replacement of hydrogen in a protein with deuterium induces a shift in mass of ϳ1 Da. Because antibody binding inhibits deuterium exchange in the epitope regions, peptides exhibiting shifts in mass are associated with antibody epitopes. As shown in Fig. 4A , a large shift in mass in comparison with the control was observed in the peptide encompassing residues 100 -110 in human IL-13, indicating that this region was protected by DL11. Therefore, the shift in mass of this peptide was monitored in the limit of detection study, in which a fixed amount of human IL-13 was incubated with samples containing titrated concentrations of purified DL11. The endogenous IgGs purified from naive serum were used as a negative control to establish the background signal. The results shown in Fig. 4B indicated that the observed shift in mass corresponding to the reduced deuterium incorporation in human IL-13 was IgG concentration-dependent, as denotes the apparent corrected sedimentation coefficient calculated using the buffer's density and viscosity. The 95% peak represents IgG monomers. expected. The limit of detection was determined to be 31 ng/l, indicating that this was the minimum IgG concentration required to yield a detectable amount of deuterium protection. Proof-of-Concept Study Using Sera from Immunized Mice-A total of nine ϳ100-l serum samples from mice of various strains that were immunized with human IL-13 were evaluated using our SPR and HDX-LC/MS methods. Each of the serum samples had previously been characterized as a "binder" by a single point ELISA analysis. As shown in the results summary (Table 3 ), our analysis showed that the serum samples contained different percentages of human IL-13-specific antibodies, and exhibited significantly different average apparent affinities (Fig. 5 ). Among the nine serum samples, four (samples A-C and E) showed no human IL-13 binding at the highest tested concentration (100 nM). Of the other five samples that showed binding, the apparent affinities ranged from single/ double digit picomolars to single digit nanomolars, as shown by the SPR binding data. The difference in affinities was influenced by variations in both k a and k d values. Although serum samples D and F-H exhibited faster on-rates and slower off-rates, and Each bar below the sequence represents an individual peptide. The residues in green indicate sequences covered by the identified peptides, and those in black represent uncovered regions. The residue in red (N) in the identified peptides was found to be highly deamidated. hence lower K D values or higher affinity interactions than those of serum I, serum I exhibited 3-6-fold higher amounts of human IL-13-specific IgGs than the others, based on its larger experimental R max values. In addition to observing differences in the antigen-specific apparent affinities and quantities of polyclonal IgGs among the nine serum samples, we found that the IL-13 binding epitopes among the serum samples were also different. As shown in Fig.  6 , the IgGs from serum H (panel C) protected the region encompassing residues 95-110 from deuterium exchange, indicating that this serum sample contained IgGs that were specific to this region. Similarly, the IgGs from serum I (Fig. 6 , panel D) also showed protection on the same region as that of serum H, with a relatively less extensive mass shift that was likely due to weaker affinity to human IL-13. In contrast, the IgGs from serum C (Fig. 6, panel B) showed no protection at this region, as the exchange observed there was equivalent to that of the control, containing no IgGs (panel A), suggesting that either this serum sample contained no IgGs targeting this region or that the level of IgGs present was below the detection limit of the method (31 ng/l). The results obtained using both SPR and HDX LC/MS were consistent, in that the non-binders showed no binding of any region in human IL-13. For those samples that exhibited epitope protection, a diverse range of epitopes were identified. As depicted in Fig. 7 , antibody responses directed toward various helix and loop regions of the human IL-13 protein were detected. Of the 112 amino acids in human IL-13, 63 were shown to be protected, indicating that 56% of the sequence elicited antibody responses. While serum G exhibited the most diverse responses, serum F, which contained antibodies that were exclusively directed against the C terminus of the protein (Table 3) , exhibited the least diverse response. Integration of the Workflow Process into Our Antibody Generation Platform-Given the success of our methods in differentiating the antibody responses among different immunized animals, we integrated the QAR workflow into our antibody generation platform to help guide decision-making in future immunization campaigns. The flowchart shown in Fig. 8 indicates the time frames of the QAR workflow components. Approximately 2 weeks after the immunization of animals with antigen or antigen/adjuvant mixtures, after the induction of an effective antibody response, serum samples are evaluated by ELISA to determine the presence and titer of antibodies. If the FIGURE 5 . Characterization of binding interactions between mouse serum IgGs and human IL-13. The binding interactions were monitored over 10-min association periods followed by 45-min dissociation periods. The binding response curves were obtained by measuring the binding of human IL-13 to IgGs captured on the biosensor surface that were titrated by 2-fold dilutions as follows: 100 nM (light blue); 50 nM (dark blue); 25 nM (green); 12.5 nM (purple); and 6.25 nM (orange). Kinetic fit was performed on serum samples D and F-I using the 1:1 Langmuir kinetic binding model in the ProteOn analysis software, as illustrated by the black lines that overlay the response curves. titer results are positive, the serum samples are directly analyzed by SPR to determine their apparent binding affinities and to quantify the percentage of antigen-specific IgGs. At the same time, the remaining volume of the serum samples (ϳ99 l) is subjected to IgG purification using the PhyNexus automated purification system. While the SPR method can measure six serum samples at a time (six parallel sample injections based on the 6 ϫ 6 multiplex configuration) with a protocol that typically includes multiple binding cycles, the PhyNexus MEA system can purify 12 samples at a time with an estimated run time of 2.5 h. Multiple MEA systems can be used in parallel to analyze more than 12 samples simultaneously. Taking into account the post-purification sample preparation time (enrichment and buffer-exchange steps), purified IgG samples can be ready for epitope mapping within 4 h. Meanwhile, analysis of the SPR data can provide early information on the affinity and quantity of the antibodies. After sample and reagent preparation, the HDX LC/MS experiment is performed overnight using an automated protocol that accurately controls both the deuterium exchange and quenching reaction times for each sample. Deuterium exchange, involving the sequential analysis of three time points, is performed and completed by the next day. Because of the large amount of data collected, the MS data analysis requires about a half-day of data processing using two inhouse-derived proprietary software applications. Thus, a comprehensive data package can be generated within 2 days that provides useful feedback for guiding the immunization approach. The workflow can be applied at any point during the immunization campaign to track the development of antibody responses. Implementation of the QAR Workflow to Guide Antibody Recovery-The QAR workflow was integrated into the BAFF antibody generation campaign, and its performance was evaluated. Similar to the anti-IL-13 sera analysis, the anti-BAFF sera analysis (Table 4 ) revealed differences in antibody quality among the 12 serum samples. In addition to analyzing antibody binding to the human antigen that was used for immunization, we also analyzed antibody binding to the cynomolgus (cyno) monkey protein using SPR. Even though the human and cyno-BAFF proteins share 97% sequence identity, serum samples from mice P5804-01 and P5804-02 exhibited K D values for cyno-BAFF that were five times those for human BAFF, indic- ative of weaker interactions. We analyzed the binding epitopes of the various antibodies, focusing on the antibody responses to the regions in human BAFF that are known to be important for receptor interactions. Our in-house analysis indicated that regions encompassing residues 17-31, 68 -90, 128 -137, and 137-145 are important for function (data not shown). Therefore, we focused our attention on IgGs that were found to target these regions. Among the 12 serum samples, only five (P5801-01, P5801-02, P5811-01, P5821-01, and P5821-02) showed binding responses toward at least one of the prioritized epitope regions. Although four of these samples exhibited similar double digit picomolar or better affinities and less than ϳ2-fold shifts in binding to cyno-BAFF, the serum sample from mouse P5801-02 contained the highest amounts (Ͼ30%) of human BAFF and cyno-BAFF-specific IgGs. This mouse was subsequently selected for hybridoma fusion, and analysis of the subcloned monoclonal antibodies (Table 5 ) revealed that they exhibited low picomolar EC 50 binding to human BAFF. In addition, blockade of receptor binding was confirmed, indicating that the selection of mice based on the epitope mapping of serum IgGs is an effective strategy.
