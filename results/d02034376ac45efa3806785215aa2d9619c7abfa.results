Nine tertiary-level university teaching hospitals in 3 states of eastern Australia participated in the study ( Table 2 ). The simulations occurred in the winter season, from May through August 2006. All sites conducted targeted staff education sessions 1-2 weeks before their exercise. Seven of the 9 simulations proceeded for the planned 6 hours of observation, and 2 were curtailed because of a critical need for the emergency department bed. Had these latter 2 sites continued, the patient would almost certainly have spent the entire study period isolated in the emergency department, as suitable ward beds were not available. The time spent in each clinical area for each site is summarized in Table 2 . All sites performed radiography within the emergency department. The number of close contacts and total exposures to the potential API patient are summarized in Table 3 . The highest number occurred in the fi rst hour of hospital care (triage and emergency department), which correlated with the initial intensive clinical and radiologic assessment and Gloves, either gown or apron Patient transport within healthcare facilities Gown, gloves Specimen transport and processing Not defined except to use "safe handling practices"; interpreted as use of gloves (minimum) and gown if opening specimen bag. *WHO, World Health Organization; HCW, healthcare worker; PPE, personal protective equipment; API, avian or pandemic influenza. â€ Derived from (7).

HCW close contacts constituted 85% of all close contacts; the remainder were patients or visitors who were generally exposed in the triage area. All 9 sites processed the respiratory specimen, with an average of 2.9 HCWs (median 3, range 2-6) handling or transporting the specimen, predominantly in the pathology department. Two sites used a vacuum transport system to deliver specimens from the emergency department to the laboratory, contrary to WHO recommendations (7) . Environmental decontamination of clinical areas after departure of the suspected API patient was performed haphazardly at all sites. The triage area was appropriately cleaned in none of the 9 sites, whereas the emergency department and ward areas at sites that completed the full simulation were cleaned appropriately in 6 of 7, and 4 of 7 instances, respectively; 1-2 cleaners were required per clinical area to appropriately perform this task. Large quantities of N95 masks, disposable gowns, gloves, and eye protection were used and indicated during the study period (Table 4 ). Adherence to appropriate use by HCWs (HCW close contacts and ancillary HCWs) was variable and depended on the particular PPE item, clinical area, and participating institution. Appropriate use of N95 masks by HCWs occurred in 93% of exposures (actual use/ total opportunities for PPE use, 18/19.4), although the corresponding fi gures for disposable gowns, gloves, and eye protection were lower (77%, 83%, and 73%, respectively). HCW close contacts were stratifi ed into either moderate-or low-risk groups, depending on whether an appropriate PPE set was worn during every exposure. The proportions of HCW close contacts who appropriately wore a PPE set, rather than an N95 mask alone, for every exposure were 59% and 92%, respectively. Thus, depending on how rigorously WHO antiviral medication guidelines (9) were followed, from 8% to 41% of all HCW close contacts would be classifi ed as having experienced a medium-risk exposure and therefore would potentially require postexposure antiviral prophylaxis. This amounts to an average of 0.8 to 4.3 courses of antiviral medication per suspected API patient during the initial 6 hours of management.
