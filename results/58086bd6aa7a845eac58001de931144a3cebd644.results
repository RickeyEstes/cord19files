Clinical characteristics of MERS-CoV patientss. We reviewed all available clinical and laboratory data of fourteen patients treated in a hospital during the MERS outbreak. The patients were classified into four groups based on the severity and mortality (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S1 , and Supplementary Table S1). Group I patients includes two patients who only developed fever and recovered without developing pneumonia. They recovered without any treatment. Group II includes three patients (P03-P05) who developed mild pneumonia without hypoxemia (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ). P04 and P05 showed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP, > 3 mg/dl) and P05 had elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Supplementary Table S1 ). Four patients (P06-P09) recovered from more prolonged and severe pneumonia, and are classified as group III. Severe pneumonia was defined as pneumonia severity index (PSI) ≥ 60 at initial presentation (Table 1 ). All patients in this group exhibited elevated liver enzymes and proteinuria during the acute phase. Among them, P09 had pneumonia, rapidly progressing to respiratory failure, and required mechanical ventilation (MV) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). She also received convalescent plasma therapy twice on days 10 and 16 after symptom onset ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). Group IV includes five fatal cases (P10-P14). All group IV patients suffered from severe pneumonia and ARDS requiring high flow nasal cannula and/or mechanical ventilation. The deceased patients were older than 60, except for P11, and had underlying illnesses, except for P10. P11 had decompensated liver cirrhosis and poorly controlled blood glucose levels before MERS-CoV infection. P12 was diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis about one week before he encountered a MERS-CoV infected patient. He developed pneumonia two days after the onset of fever and progressed to ARDS within a week. P13 and P14 had comorbidities including chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD) and asthma. They were infected with MERS-CoV while being Recovered   G I  P01  65  F  -18  -----P02  66  F  -12  -----G II   P03  39  F  -8  3  29  12  3  -P04  55  F  -10  4  45  14  5  -P05  57  F  -9  4  47 treated for an acute exacerbation of their pulmonary diseases. They died within 2 weeks after symptom onset despite mechanical ventilation. All the patients with pneumonia were treated with anti-viral drugs (Supplementary Table S2 ) and examined daily by chest X-rays until the resolution of pneumonia. Representative radiologic findings of MERS patents with pneumonia are shown in Fig. 1 . Patients with pneumonia almost always showed ground-glass opacity or airspace consolidation involving either or both sides of lower lung fields. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed on P08 and his chest CT scans revealed lobar consolidation in right lower lobe and segmental infiltration in the left upper lobe. Patients in group II showed more rapid clearing of pneumonic infiltrates compared to patients in group III. Kinetics of viral shedding from respiratory secretions and plasma. Since the lower respiratory samples had higher viral loads and showed more sustained viral release than upper respiratory secretions 14,15 , we primarily measured viral loads in lower respiratory secretions such as sputa and tracheal aspirates (Fig. 2) . Patient P01 secreted 1.5-1.7 × 10 6 virus copies/ml in the sputa during the first week and P02 shed a similar level (3.1-6.7 × 10 6 copies/ml) of virions up to ten days after fever onset. No viremia was observed in P01, but a transient viremia (8.9 × 10 3 copies/ml) occurred in P02 on day 5. In group II patients with mild pneumonia, viral shedding (1.6 × 10 6 to 6.5 × 10 8 copies/ml, average = 3.5 × 10 7 copies/ml) was detected in sputa up to ten days after symptom onset. Viremia (average = 2.2 × 10 4 copies/ml) was observed in P03 and P05 until ten and thirteen days, respectively, whereas P04 had no viremia. Since P05 complained of severe headache and nausea from day 12 to 13 16, 17 , cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected and examined for inflammatory signs and viremia, Figure 1 . Representative chest images of the MERS patients. Chest images of the MERS patients suffered from mild (P05) or severe pneumonia (P08 and P13) were presented. P05 and P08 were recovered from the pneumonia whereas P13 died due to ARDS. Images were taken at the indicated days after symptom onset. Paired chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans were performed on the same day in P08. Initial chest radiographs shows patchy consolidation along with ground-glass opacities involving unilateral or both lung zones. Follow-up frontal chest radiographs and CT scan (P08) obtained in acute phase show progression in density and extent in all three patients. Chest radiographs taken in convalescent stage show improvement in survived patients (P05 and P08) whereas that of P13 shows progression with bilateral extensive consolidation in both lung zones. but we detected no evidence of CNS infection. Viral shedding from group II patients stopped after initiation of antiviral therapy. In group III patients who suffered from more severe pneumonia, viral secretion in the lower respiratory tract was more sustained, continuing for up to 18 to 27 days following the onset of symptoms. In addition, viremia was detected in serum samples for up to 34 days as in the case of P08. Viral shedding ceased during antiviral therapy in two patients (P07 and P09), whereas viremia continued in all patients. Initial viral loads in respiratory secretions during the second week ranged from 3.9 × 10 4 to 2.4 × 10 9 copies/ml. However, the average viral load in plasma was around 1.1 × 10 4 copies/ml, similar to group II patients. In the case of P09 who received convalescent-phase plasma twice, viral loads in respiratory secretions increased slightly and the level of viremia remained virtually unchanged until day 18. Viral loads in lower respiratory secretions from the fatal cases (group IV) were relatively higher (5.0 × 10 8 to 1.4 × 10 9 copies/ml, average = 6.3 × 10 8 copies/ml) than survivors. Viremia (average = 3.2 × 10 4 copies/ml) was also sustained during antiviral therapy in group IV cases. Kinetic responses of serum IgG and secretory IgA in respiratory samples. Antibody responses against spike (S1) antigen were measured by ELISA and compared among the four groups. Gradual increases of S1-specific serum IgG were observed in all the recovered patients regardless of disease severity, whereas serum IgG responses were generally static until the second week in the lethal patients (Fig. 3) . P09 who had a long incubation period (~14 days) showed decreased antibody responses after passive plasma therapy even though she showed the highest IgG response among the patients at day 7. The effect of antiviral therapy on IgG responses is not clear. We also examined S1-specific secretory IgA responses in respiratory secretions ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary  Fig. S2 ). The level of antigen-specific secretory IgA, as measured by relative OD or titers, generally increased up to two to three weeks after symptom onset and then reached steady state or declined in all the recovered patients. Notably, secretory IgA titers of group III patients were relatively higher than mild cases during the second and third week. Among the deceased patients, three patients (P10, 12, and 14) developed detectable secretory IgA during the second or third week, whereas P13 failed to produce the specific IgA until day 10. The levels of S1-specific antibody responses were compared against viral loads in plasma and respiratory secretions (Fig. 4) . The level of serum IgG was inversely correlated with viral loads in both plasma and respiratory secretions although these did not reach statistical significance. Respiratory viral loads were also negatively correlated with secretory IgA levels without statistical significance. Secretory IgA did not show any negative correlation with viral loads in plasma. The consistently high viral loads in the clinical samples even in the presence of specific antibodies suggest that the early antibody responses induced in systemic and mucosal immune systems may not provide sufficient protective immunity against MERS-CoV replication. Nevertheless, since we measured viral nucleic acid levels rather than infectious viral titers in the clinical samples, we cannot exclude the possibility that viral infectivity is lower due to opsonization by antiviral antibodies. Table S3 ). In group I patients, there were no significant abnormalities observed in leukocytes counts and absolute counts remained within the normal range. We did note a gradual increase of lymphocytes and platelets up to 2 week after symptom onset. The gradual rise in lymphocyte and platelet counts was also observed in group II patients up to 2 ~ 3 weeks after symptom onset. P03 also showed a transient rise in neutrophil counts during the second week. Transient or persistent leukocytosis, primarily due to increased neutrophils, was observed in P06, P08, and P09 among group III patients. Monocyte counts also rose rapidly in P08 and P09 during the second and third week, but returned to basal levels thereafter. Thus, all the recovered patients exhibited a gradual increase in lymphocyte counts, suggesting that lymphocyte responses may be correlated with disease resolution. Among the five lethal cases, neutrophilia (> 8,000 cell/μ l) was observed in P12 and P13. Early increases of lymphocyte counts occurred in all the group IV patients except P14, however, they suffered from lymphopenia (< 1,500 cells/μ l) and thrombocytopenia (< 140 × 10 3 /μ l) during antiviral therapy. Slight increases in monocyte counts were detected in P11, P12, and P13 during treatment.
