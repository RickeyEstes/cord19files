Further analysis of processing of the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins to an 87-kDa protein by the two overlapping papain-like proteinase domains We have previously demonstrated that expression of the IBV sequence from nucleotides 362 to 5753 (pIBV1a2) led to the detection of three protein species: a 250-kDa product representing the full-length product of the construct and two cleavage products of 160 and 87 kDa, respectively . However, when the IBV sequence from nucleotides 362 to 4858 (pIBV1a1) was expressed, no processing of the full-length 220-kDa protein to smaller products was observed . These results suggest strongly that the two putative overlapping papain-like proteinase domains are involved in processing of the 1a and 1a/1b polyproteins to the 87-kDa protein species. To further characterize the proteinase activity and to determine the cleavage sites of the 87-kDa protein, a series of N-terminal, internal, and C-terminal deletion mutants were constructed based on pIBV1a2. Plasmid pIBV1a2⌬1 contains an N-terminal deletion of the IBV sequence from nucleotides 362 to 1310; pIBV1a2⌬3 and pIBV1a2⌬4 contain internal deletions of the IBV sequences from nucleotides 2251 to 3832 and from 3047 to 3997, respectively; pIBV1a2⌬5 contains a C-terminal deletion of the IBV sequence from nucleotides 5027 to 5753 (see Figs. 1 and 2a) . These constructs were then expressed in Vero cells using the vaccinia virus-T7 expression system (Fuerst et al., 1986) . The N-terminal deletion construct pIBV1a2⌬1 was firstly expressed in Vero cells. As can be seen, expression of pIBV1a2 resulted in the detection, once again, of the 250-, 160-, and 87-kDa protein species (Fig. 2b) . Similarly, three protein species of approximately 220, 160, and 58 kDa were detected from lysates prepared from pIBV1a2⌬1-transfected cells by immunoprecipitation with region-specific antiserum V59 (Fig. 2b) . The 220-kDa species is probably the full-length product, while the 160-and 58-kDa protein species may represent products derived from a cleavage event. As the 160-kDa protein comigrated with the 160-kDa protein FIG. 1. Diagram of the structure of plasmid pIBV1a2, showing the locations of the 87-kDa protein, the two putative overlapping papain-like proteinase domains (PLPDs), and the restriction sites used in this study. The C-terminal cleavage site (Gly 673 2Gly 674 dipeptide) of the 87-kDa protein, the catalytic residues of the PLPD-1 (Cys 1274 and His 1437 ), and the IBV sequence recognized by antiserum V59 are indicated. Also shown are the IBV sequences present in plasmids pIBV1a1, pIBV1a2⌬1, pIBV1a2⌬3, pIBV1a2⌬4, pIBV1a2⌬5, pIBV1a2⌬8, pIBV1a2⌬9, pIBV1a2⌬10, pIBV1a2⌬11, pIBV1a2⌬12, and pIBV1a2⌬14. detected from pIBV1a2-transfected cells (Fig. 2b) , this result suggests that it may represent the C-terminal cleavage product of the 220-kDa protein, and the 58-kDa protein may be an N-terminally truncated version of the 87-kDa protein. In a previous study, we speculated that the 160-kDa species may be an intermediate cleavage product containing the 87-kDa protein, as both the 87-and 160-kDa proteins can be immunoprecipitated by the two N-terminal-specific antisera (V52 and V59) used . It was therefore likely that a second cleavage site may be located between the regions coding for the 87-kDa protein and the two PLPDs. To investigate this possibility, plasmid pIBV1a2⌬3 was constructed and expressed. As can be seen, only the full-length protein of approximately 136 kDa was immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2b) . No cleavage products were detected from the expression of this construct. This result hence rules out the possibility that the 160-kDa is an intermediate cleavage product covering the 87-kDa protein and a protein of 70 kDa (Fig. 2b) . The reason for the coimmunoprecipitation of the 160-kDa by antiserum V59 is considered under Discussion. Plasmid pIBV1a2⌬4 was next expressed to test the effect of internal deletion of the region between the sequences coding for the 87-kDa protein and PLPDs on processing to the 87-kDa protein. As shown in Fig. 2b , FIG. 2. (a) Diagram showing the full-length and cleavage products synthesized from plasmids pIBV1a2, pIBV1a2⌬1, pIBV1a2⌬3, pIBV1a2⌬4, and pIBV1a2⌬5. (b) Analysis of transiently expressed ORF 1a products from cells transfected with pIBV1a2, pIBV1a2⌬1, pIBV1a2⌬3, pIBV1a2⌬4, and pIBV1a2⌬5. Plasmid DNA was transiently expressed in Vero cells using the vaccinia virus/T7 expression system. Cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine, lysates were prepared, and polypeptides were either analyzed directly or immunoprecipitated with antiserum V59. Gel electrophoresis was performed on an SDS±10% polyacrylamide gel and polypeptides were detected by fluorography. HMW, high-molecular-mass markers (numbers indicate kilodaltons). expression of pIBV1a2⌬4 led to the detection of three products of approximately 190, 100, and 87 kDa. Both the 190-and 87-kDa protein species were efficiently immunoprecipitated by antiserum V59; only weak immunoprecipitation of the 100-kDa protein, however, was observed ( Fig. 2b) . This result demonstrates that the IBV sequence between nucleotides 3047 and 3997 is not essential for processing to the 87-kDa protein species and suggests that the C-terminal cleavage site of the 87-kDa protein is encoded between nucleotides 2251 and 3047. Finally, the C-terminal cleavage construct pIBV1a2⌬5 was expressed to investigate if both of the two putative PLPDs were required for processing to the 87-kDa protein. As can be seen, expression of this construct led to the detection of three protein species of approximately 225, 135, and 87 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2b ). Both the 225and 87-kDa proteins were efficiently immunoprecipitated by antiserum V59 (Fig. 2b ). This result indicates that PLPD-1 is responsible for releasing the 87-kDa protein. In addition to the protein species described above, expression of pIBV1a2, pIBV1a2⌬3, pIBV1a2⌬4, and pIBV1a2⌬5 also resulted in the detection of protein species which migrated more slowly on SDS±PAGE than their respective full-length products (Fig. 2b ). Furthermore, protein species that migrated between the cleavage products were also observed (Fig. 2b ). The identities of these products are currently uncertain, but they may represent modified forms of the cleavage and full-length products. The polypeptides detected from the expression of pIBV1a2, pIBV1a2⌬1, pIBV1a2⌬3, pIBV1a2⌬4, and pIBV1a2⌬5 are illustrated in Fig. 2a . Mutagenesis studies of the putative catalytic center of PLPD-1 Data presented above showed that only the first of the two overlapping proteinase domains was required for processing to the 87-kDa product. Computer analysis of the proteinase domain suggested that it may belong to the papain-like class of thiol proteinase with a catalytic dyad of cysteine and histidine residues (Gorbalenya et al., 1989 . In fact, the Cys 1274 and His 1437 residues were predicted to be the catalytic dyad of the proteinase (Lee et al., 1991 ) (see Fig. 1 ). To test this prediction, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using pIBV1a2⌬4 as the template. By monitoring the production of the 87-kDa protein, the effect of the mutations on the proteinase activity could be tested. The putative nucleophilic cysteine (Cys 1274 ) residue, which was encoded by nucleotides 4348 to 4350, was first mutated to a Ser residue, giving rise to the mutant construct pIBV1a2⌬4C 1274 -S. As shown in Fig. 3 , expression of pIBV1a2⌬4, once again, yielded the 190-kDa full-length product and the 87-kDa protein species. Expression of pIBV1a2⌬4C 1274 -S, however, resulted in the detection of only the 190-kDa full-length product. No 87-kDa protein was detected, indicating that this substitution disrupts the proteinase activity required for the release of the 87-kDa protein. Similarly, mutation of the predicted His 1437 residue (encoded by nucleotides 4837 to 4839) to a Lys was introduced, giving rise to pIBV1a2⌬4H 1437 -K. The mutant construct was then expressed in Vero cells. As can be seen, only the 190-kDa full-length product was immunoprecipitated by antiserum V59; no 87-kDa protein was detected (Fig. 3) . These results support the computer prediction that both the Cys 1274 and His 1437 are essential for the catalytic activity of the proteinase.
