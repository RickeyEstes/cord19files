pUL21a Interacts with the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) HCMV pUL21a is a 15 kDa, highly unstable protein that is expressed with early kinetics [29] . One identified function of this protein is to facilitate efficient viral DNA synthesis [30] . However, this protein shares no significant homology with any known protein. To provide mechanistic insight into its activity, we used a proteomics approach to identify interacting partners of pUL21a during infection. We created a recombinant virus (ADgfpUL21a) in which the UL21a coding sequence was tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence. This virus grew with wild-type kinetics, and the tagged protein was fortuitously much more stable than native pUL21a [29] . A GFP tag can stabilize certain fusion proteins [31] , and made it possible to detect interacting proteins in our study. We infected fibroblasts with either ADgfpUL21a or control HCMV (ADgfp) that expressed free GFP only. At 48 hours post infection (hpi), we isolated the protein complexes from infected cells by a rapid one-step immunoaffinity purification on magnetic beads coated with GFP antibody-coupled protein A. Electrophoresis analysis revealed multiple protein bands that were specific to the pUL21a-containing sample ( Figure 1A ). We analyzed pUL21a-specific protein bands by mass spectrometry and identified the proteins depicted with arrows as APC specificity arm subunits, APC3, APC7, and APC8 (Table S1) . We validated these interactions in HCMV infected cells by coimmunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis. Here we used APC3 and APC8 as the marker for the APC complex. Pulldown of pGFP-UL21a, but not the GFP control, isolated both APC3 and APC8 ( Figure 1B ). The lower band detected by APC8 antibody was nonspecific as it neither co-immunoprecipitated with APC3 antibody ( Figure 1B ) nor was affected by shRNA knockdown of APC8 ( Figure S1 ). In the reciprocal experiment, APC3 antibody co-immunoprecipitated APC8 and pGFP-UL21a but not GFP. Neither GFP nor APC3 antibody co-immunoprecipitated cellular PCNA ( Figure 1B) , and an antibody against HA did not co-immunoprecipitate any of the proteins detected here (data not shown), thus providing additional evidence for the specificity of these interactions. As pGFP-UL21a is co-immunoprecipitated with multiple APC subunits, we interpret the result to suggest that pUL21a binds to the APC complex, even though the precise subunit where pUL21a directly interacts with remains unknown. To determine if this interaction also occurred with native pUL21a, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays on lysates from cells infected with wild-type virus (ADgfp), and we also included lysate from cells infected with UL21a deletion virus (ADsubUL21a) as a negative control ( Figure 1C ). Infected cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor, MG132, as pUL21a was highly unstable and otherwise could not accumulate to levels allowing reproducible detection of this interaction [29] .
