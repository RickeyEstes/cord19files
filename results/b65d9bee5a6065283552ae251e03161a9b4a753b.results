In 2006-07, WHO allocated 87% of its total budget to infectious diseases, 12% to non-communicable diseases, and less than 1% to injuries and violence. We next disaggregated the broad disease clusters using the budget groups that could be matched to the burden of disease in terms of numbers of deaths and DALYs. The available disease-specifi c groups included malnutrition; malaria; tuberculosis; injuries; HIV/AIDS; child and maternal causes; communicable diseases excluding HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and non-communicable diseases. Webtable 2 further describes the budget groups that corresponded to each disease. Figure 1 shows that WHO funds and disease burden were not correlated in 2004-05, irrespective of whether measured in terms of mortality or DALYs. Three-fi fths of WHO funds were spent on communicable diseases excluding HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, which accounted for roughly 11% of global mortality. Conversely, non-communicable disease accounted for more than half of global mortality and almost half of global DALYs, but received roughly a tenth of all WHO funds. We recorded a similar disparity with injuries, which claimed 9% of global mortality and 12% of global DALYs, but received less than 1% of global funds. Further inspection of the WHO budget showed that the resources used for communicable diseases excluding HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria were mainly driven by WHO extra-budgetary funds for immunisation and vaccine development. WHO's regular budget allocated US$14路3 million to this area of work, corresponding to 6% of WHO's regular budget. By contrast, WHO's extra-budgetary funds allocated $512路4 million, roughly 36 times as much as in the regular budget, corresponding to about 30% of WHO's extra-budgetary allocations for infectious disease control. Although Bamako 2008 is a conference about the global health research agenda, it does explicitly focus on Africa, which is justifi able in view of the scale of both poverty and disease in that continent. For the same reason, international development assistance understandably concentrates on Africa and, within it, on the leading causes of disease. However, other regions worldwide still have a substantial burden of poverty and disease, although less than that in Africa. One such region is the Western Pacifi c region as defi ned by WHO, where almost three-quarters of all deaths are attributable to non-communicable diseases. In Africa, the burden of disease is almost the reverse: less than a quarter of mortality is from non-communicable diseases, and roughly three-quarters is from infectious diseases. Does WHO allocate a substantially greater fraction of the available funds to non-communicable diseases in the Western Pacifi c region than in the African region? Figure 2 shows the distribution of WHO's budgetary allocations across the three major burden of disease clusters in the African and Western Pacifi c regions in 2004-05. In both regions, the resources were heavily skewed toward infectious diseases. In the African region, infectious diseases received almost all funds, with non-communicable diseases and injuries receiving very small proportions of the overall funds allocated by WHO to the region. The trend for the Western Pacifi c region was nearly the same (fi gure 2). To further investigate whether the recorded mismatch between the disease burden and allocated funds can be attributed to the diff erential allocation of assessed contributions, which are decided on by member states, and voluntary contributions, which are determined by donors, we compared the distribution of each. WHO's budget has nearly doubled in recent years, from $2路3 billion in 2000-01 to $4路2 billion in 2008-09, with almost all the growth occurring in WHO's extra-budgetary funds, which have risen from 25% of the budget in 1971 to more than 75% in 2008. Much of this growth has been driven by increasing funding from countries from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and, in recent years, from private philanthropic foundations, such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Since these foundations have increased the contribution to WHO's budget, the private for-profi t sector's direct contribution to WHO's extra-budgetary funds has dropped substantially, from 5% in 2000-01 to less than 1% in 2006-07. Figure 3 shows the sources of WHO's extra-budgetary funds in 2006-07. Most funds come from member states, and, as shown in webtable 3, more than four-fi fths of this money is donated by high-income countries that are not substantial recipients of the funds. Of the other sources, the three highest contributors were the UN, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the European Commission, together contributing half the funds from sources other than those received directly from member states (the fi rst and last of these contributors are essentially conduits for funds from member states). 15 years ago, direct funding by member states accounted for roughly four-fi fths of extra-budgetary funds. Nowadays that amount has fallen to 40%, with the greatest rises coming from UN organisations (21% in 2006-07 versus 5% in 1992-93) and public and private foundations such as the Gates Foundation and Rotary International (15% in 2006-07). 7 Webtable 3 shows the ten member states and the ten non-member states that contributed the most to WHO's extra-budgetary funds. As noted earlier, whether funds from the regular budget and extra-budgetary funds are allocated diff erently can provide important insights into the priorities of diff erent decision makers. WHO's regular budget was much more closely aligned with the actual global burden of disease than were the extra-budgetary funds. Of WHO's regular budget, 61% of funds were allocated to infectious diseases, whereas 38% were allocated to noncommunicable diseases and roughly 1% to injuries. Of the WHO's extra-budgetary funds, 91% went to infectious disease, 8% to non-communicable disease, and about 1% to injuries. In both cases, injuries received a substantially lower share than would be expected from the amount of mortality and disability that they cause (see webappendix 1 for more details of trends in WHO extra-budget allocations).
