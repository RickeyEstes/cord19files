After extracting all necessary issues from our interviews and focus groups, three main stakeholders and their roles recognized as follows: 1. Government, ministries and related organizations: to coordinate all activities, issue supportive rules and regulations, and monitoring the roles of all role-players 2. Healthcare and medical service providers: paying attention to health services' quality, evidence-based services, accessibility and cost of services and to satisfy health seekers 3. Tourism Services: attention to nonmedical supports such as accommodation, travelling, cost of extra-services, availability of information and creating calm and peaceful environment.
