A total of 1000 serum samples were screened from 29 herds located in three municipalities of Cesar state. Overall, seroprevalence for BVDV in the Aguachica, Rio de Oro, and La Gloria municipalities was 35.2%; while for BRSV, BHV-1, and BPI-3V were 98.6%, 94.7%, and 47.1%, respectively. These values were analyzed by the Chi-square test and according to the results obtained, there was statistical association (p<0.05) between the seropositive values of BVDV in the three municipalities: About 25.5% (164/643) in Aguachica, 54.4% (37/68) in La Gloria, and 52.2% (151/289) in Rio de Oro. According to these results, the seroprevalence for BVDV is present in different proportions in the three municipalities of the Cesar department, Colombia. Nevertheless, for BRSV, BHV-1, and BPI-3V, no statistical association was found (p>0.05) between seropositive values and the municipalities, indicating that the seroprevalence is present in similar proportions in the three municipalities (Table-1 ). Regarding the herd size (small and large), all the examined herds were positive for antibodies against BHV-1, BRSV, and BPI-3V; however, for BVDV 86.2% (25/29) resulted positive. According to these results, viral pathogens circulate widely in the herds with different size of the evaluated municipalities. Table-2 shows the comparison between percent positive for the viral pathogens and the age of the animals. These values were analyzed by Chi-square test, and according to with the results obtained, there was no statistical association (p>0.05) between the seropositive values of BVDV, BRSV, and BPI-3V with respect to age groups. In contrast, there was a statistical association (p<0.05) between positive percent for BHV-1 and the age of the animals. Young calves were no tested for any respiratory viral pathogens. Table-3 shows the frequency of clinical signs observed in the animals tested. The retention of placenta presented the highest frequency (75.1%), followed by abortion (56.8%), fever (56.8%), and diarrhea (55.7%). The diseased animals showed temperature ranges above 40Â°C and the abortions pattern was observed in any trimester of the gestation. The comparison between percent positive for the viral pathogens with the presence or absence of clinical signs is shown in Table-3 . These values were analyzed by Chi-square test and according to the results obtained, there was a statistical association (p<0.05) between the seropositive values of BVDV and the most of clinical signs observed, except for abortion (p>0.05). In contrast, there was no statistical association (p>0.05) between positive percent for BHV-1, BRSV, and BPI-3V with the most of clinical signs, except for vulvovaginitis and conjunctivitis in BHV-1 and BPI-3V, respectively. All herds infected with BRSV showing similar clinical signs. In the present study, other infectious pathogens were not studied; however, the sensitivity of the ELISA test is high, which allows to estimate the seroprevalence of these viral pathogens in the dual-purpose cattle breeds. In the logistic regression analysis, the significant risk factors were sex and age group for BHV-1 and BPI-3V and the municipality for BVDV (Table-4 ). Females showed 3.2 (OR=3.2, IC95%=0.9-11.5) Regarding the age, cows older than 24 months showed 3.9 and 3.5 times probability for infection of BHV-1 and BPI-3V, respectively, than younger cows. La Gloria and Rio de Oro municipalities showed 3.5 and 3.2 times higher probability of infection for BVDV than Aguachica municipality. There was no statistical significance between the pathogens with respect to the herd size (p>0.05).
