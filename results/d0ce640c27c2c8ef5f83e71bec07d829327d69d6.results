Previously, KD shRNA was shown to reduce PIN1 by 85% compared with Control shRNA in MAEC [6] . COX-2 protein was very low in vehicle-treated KD and Control MAEC (figure 1), and incubation with either LPS or IFN alone did not induce it (data not shown). However, stimulation with 10 μg LPS plus 20 ng IFN per ml increased COX-2 expression. The protein appeared to increase as early as 1 h after treatment, and induction persisted through 24 h. Differences between KD and Control cells were qualitatively noticeable by 4 h after treatment and became greater with time ( figure 1A) . After 24 h, the signal for COX-2 protein was increased 10-fold in Control shRNA MAEC (figure 1B). The COX-2 signal was significantly more induced in PIN1 KD cells (47-fold). Similar results were obtained in 2 other independent pairs of cul-tures selected for the KD and Control shRNA (data not shown). COX-2-mediated prostaglandin E2 production increased 3-fold in KD MAEC, but not in the Control cells PIN1 KD and Control shRNA MAEC were pretreated with vehicle or the calpain inhibitors, zVF or PD150606, for 1 h, and then treated with LPS and IFN for 24 h. Again, COX-2 increased more in KD than Control cells ( figure 4) . In Control cells, COX-2 was induced 5.5-fold more in the presence of zVF than in its absence. zVF also increased the induction of COX-2 from its elevated level in KD MAEC by a factor of two (figure 4A). PD 150606, which is more selective than zVF for calpain relative to cathepsin activities [29, 30] , also increased the induction of COX-2 in KD and Control cells. zVF did not increase the induction of COX-2 mRNA in cells treated with LPS/IFN for 1 or 24 h (figure 5). The effect of PIN1 depletion and zVF on degradation of COX-2 was assessed. Cells were induced with LPS/IFN and then treated with 90 μg cycloheximide/ml to block translation. The level of COX-2 protein fell to 44% of its initial value 2 h after addition of cycloheximide to Control shRNA cells ( figure 6 ). However, a similar decrease to 47% was delayed until 4 h in KD MAEC. COX-2 protein fell only to 78% of initial 2 h after cycloheximide in zVFtreated Control cells. zVF also inhibited the loss of COX-2 in KD cells at 4 h. To confirm that COX-2 is a potential substrate for calpain, its digestion in vitro was examined. Addition of porcine μcalpain to extracts of LPS/IFN-treated Control cells caused a concentration-dependent loss of COX-2 signal (figure 7). Since PIN1 is known to bind its substrate proteins, interaction with COX-2 was investigated. Immunoprecipitation of PIN1 from extracts of vehicle-or LPS/IFN-treated Control cells did not produce any COX-2 detectable on western blots. COX-2 was not pulled down with glutathione-S-transferase-PIN1 fusion protein or glutathione-Stransferase (not shown). Given the effect of calpain inhibitors on COX-2, calpain and cathepsin activities were measured. LPS/IFN increased calpain activity 6.0-fold in KD cells, and 5. Here, suppression of PIN1 in endothelial cells increased the induction of COX-2, and COX-2-dependent production of prostaglandin E2 by LPS/IFN (figures 1 and 2). Despite a nearly 5-fold greater induction of COX-2 protein in KD compared with Control MAEC, there was no difference in the induction of COX-2 mRNA ( figure 3 ). This suggests that PIN1 regulates COX-2 by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Consistent with a post-transcriptional effect, PIN1 depletion reduced the turnover of COX-2 ( figure 6 ). Since COX-2 has a relatively short halflife, inhibition of turnover could lead to large, cumulative, post-transcriptional increases after induction with LPS/ IFN [8] . One prior study revealed that cleavage of COX-2 was reduced by the inhibitor, E-64d, in human synovial fibroblasts [18] . Here, the calpain inhibitor, zVF, increased the induction of COX-2 (figure 4) and reduced its degradation (figure 6), without increasing its mRNA (figure 5). As for E-64d, zVF can also inhibit cathepsin activity at concentrations similar to those that inhibit calpain [29, 37, 38] . Therefore, PD 150606, which is more selective for calpain compared with cathepsin [30] , was Effect of PIN1 knockdown on COX-2 mRNA Figure 3 Effect of PIN1 knockdown on COX-2 mRNA. A, KD and Control (Con) shRNA MAEC were treated with LPS and IFN for 0-8 h. B, Cells were treated with medium or LPS and IFN for 24 h. mRNAs encoding COX-2 and β-actin were determined by RT-PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. Representative ethidium bromide-stained gels are shown. Replicate COX-2 or β-actin products in a single gel were imaged for analysis. Bars represent mean + S.E. ratio of COX-2: β-actin products from densitometric analysis of images from 3 independent cultures. *:p < 0.05 for comparison with cells treated for 0 h in A, or with medium in B. In support of this idea, it was shown here for the first time that PIN1 depletion reduced calpain activity in endothelial cells. In contrast, cathepsin activity was not affected by PIN1 depletion ( figure 8 ). This result, combined with the effects of zVF and PD150606 on COX-2 induction and turnover, suggests again that calpain limits the expression of COX-2 in MAEC. Indeed, COX-2 was degraded by μcalpain in vitro, indicating that it is a potential substrate in cells ( figure 7) . The reduced calpain activity in KD extracts (figure 8) could be due to an increase in expression or function of calpastatin or other unrecognized endogenous calpain inhibitors in KD cells, or to a reduction in expression or function of calpains [39] . Nevertheless, the results suggest that PIN1 depletion reduces calpain activity, consequently reducing the turnover of COX-2 in MAEC. zVF further reduced the loss of COX-2 in cycloheximidetreated KD cells ( figure 6 ). This may be due to the partial 55% reduction of calpain activity in KD MAEC (figure 8). The partially reduced calpain activity could account for the intermediate loss of COX-2 in the cycloheximidetreated KD cells, allowing zVF to further suppress turnover. It may also explain the ability of calpain inhibitors to increase induction of COX-2 in both KD and Control MAEC ( figure 4) . The partial reduction of calpain activity may be due to the incomplete (85%) suppression of PIN1 by the shRNA [6] . PIN1 may also function as a modulator of calpain activity and not as an absolute requirement.
