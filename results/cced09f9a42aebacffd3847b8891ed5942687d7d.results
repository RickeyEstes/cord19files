On the second sampling 132 individuals (24%) were nasally colonized and S aureus was present on the hands of 16.6% (91 out of 548). Hand contamination was absent at 3 establishments but at 1 site (C) there was a much higher contamination rate (44 out of 62; 71%). Following reinforcement of handwashing, retesting yielded a rate similar to that of the other 10 sites (11.1%) ( Table 1) . Of 53 subjects with hand contamination, the strain present on 4 sets of hands was identical with their own nasal strain. Three of these 4 workers were persistent carriers. Hand carriage isolates of 29 out of 49 noncolonized food handlers revealed identical spa types to the nasal isolates from persistently colonized coworkers. Of the remaining 20 hand-colonized subjects, 10 had isolates matching spa types of transient carriers within the same workplace, whereas the remainder yielded spa types distinct from the nasal isolates of their coworkers ( Table 1 ). The risk of a noncolonized worker being contaminated by a strain carried by a persistently colonized coworker was considerably higher (odds ratio, 5.66; 95% confidence interval, 2.12-15.45; P ¼ .002). Before improvement of handwashing in the poorly compliant establishment, 46.3% of exogenous contamination was from persistent carrier strains, 12.2% was from transient carriers' strains, and the remaining 41.5% was from unrelated strains. The 3 persistent carriers each harboring the same strain on their hands and noses appeared to be superspreaders (Fig  1) . The proportions from persistent, transient, and other sources became 83% (5 out of 6), 16.7% (1 out of 6), and 0, respectively, after improvements in handwashing ( Table 1) . Spread of a persistent carrier's spa type to a coworker's hands was observed in 3 sites. At both sites D and J, there was a single nasal carrier of t189 with contaminated hands and other noncolonized workers had hand contamination with this strain. A similar scenario was observed with t437 at site F (Table 1 ). In total, 13 spa types present on hands matched those of persistent carriers and 10 matched those of transient carriers. Three spa types from persistent carriers predominated: t189 (45.8%), t127 (14.6%), and t338 (12.5%). Diversity index determination revealed that strains of persistent carrier origin (D ¼ 0.862) are more closely related than those of other origins (D ¼ 1.00).
