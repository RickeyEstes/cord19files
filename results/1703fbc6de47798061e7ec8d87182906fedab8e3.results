Clinical and demographic information. We obtained peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sera from 30 CWs who worked in Riyadh New Camel Market ( Fig. 1 ) and 44 healthy controls in KSA and Iowa, USA. Patient demographic and clinical information are shown in Table 1 and in more detail in Table S1 . All of the study participants were adult males, and all CWs were exposed to camel oral and nasal secretions, urine, or both. CWs use their bare hands to control camels for transportation by turning the neck to one side of the body and inserting their hands inside the camel's mouth. None used gloves or masks; some washed their hands after camel contact ( Table 1 and Table S1 ). A minority had a history of fever or cold necessitating a visit to the emergency room within the previous 4 months. All subjects were expatriate workers (not Saudi Arabian citizens). Age, occupation, underlying medical conditions, Serological testing of CWs. We then measured MERS-CoV-specific antibody (Ab) titers in the sera of CW and healthy donors using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and 50% plaque reduction/neutralization titer (PRNT 50 ) assay (Table 2) . A total of 15/30 of CW sera had PRNT 50 titers greater than 1:20 and were therefore considered positive. Of these 15 PRNT 50 positive sera, 10 and 13 had positive or borderline ELISA and IFA titers, respectively. An additional CW serum had a positive ELISA and borderline IFA but a PRNT 50 of Ï½1:20 (CW13; Table 2 ). Notably, MERS-CoV-specific Ab levels were comparable to levels observed in survivors with mild or subclinical disease but lower than in those with severe disease (16) . None of the healthy donors from KSA had serological evidence of infection as assessed by ELISA or PRNT 50 . Collectively, these results indicate that at least 50% of CWs had serological evidence of prior MERS-CoV infection.
