In general, clinicahy affected animals usually exhibited detectable nervous signs by 4 to 6 days pi and were killed in extremis at this time. In the HSV,-inoculated rats, 8 of 23 animals survived; in the HSV&oculated animals, 19 of 50 were clinically normal at 14 days pi and were killed for histological examination (Table  I) . At necropsy, there was no macroscopic evidence of cutaneous lesions at the site of virus inoculation, and there were no gross lesions evident in the visceral organs of animals studied in this series. ViroZogy and histopathology. In this study, titers of virus tended to be higher in specimens of brain sampled than in eyes. The titers varied from approximately 60 TCIDJg to 10e4 TCIDJg (Ifible I). In general, lesions in the CNS seen on histological examination were confined to animals which succumbed during the 16day observation period pi (Table I) . Lesions were observed in various areas of the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and~rhombencephalon, but tended to be concentrated in the mesencephalon and rhombencephalon in both the HSV,-and HSV&fected animals. The intensity and appearance of lesions varied from foci of microgliosis to areas of acute hemorrhagic encephalitis characterized by destruction of grey and white matter and polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell infiltration. Hypertrophy of endothelial cells lining vessels in affected areas, and margination of leukocytes within vessels were frequently observed. Eosinophihc to amphophilic, homogeneous to finely granular intranuclear inclusions were observed within astroglial cells and neurons in these areas. Lesions were frequently most extensive in the grey and white matter of the metencephalon. Segmental destructive encephalitis, with obliteration of the internal granular and molecular layers were particularly common in HSV,-infected animals. Multinucleated giant cells were sometimes observed in HSV,-inoculated rats. They were concentrated in the internal granule cell layer with extension into the underlying white matter, and were comprised of cell nuclei surrounding homogeneous to finely granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm. Intranuclear inclusions were present in some nuclei (Fig.  1) . These syncytial giant cells were interpreted to have been derived from neurons of the internal granular layer. Changes in the leptomeninges and associated vessels were most frequently observed in HEW,-inoculated animals. These were most evident in the leptomeninges overlying the cerebellar folia and interpeduncular fossa. Lesions in these areas were characterized by marked hyperplasia and hypertrophy of fibroblasts and macrophages, polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell infiltration, and the presence of erythrocytes and strands of densely eosinophilic, proteinaceous material (Fig. 2) . Similar components were evident in selected specimens examined by scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 3) . In tissues examined by transmission electron microscopy, polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes were interspersed within a network of reactive macrophages and fibroblasts (Fig.  4) . In addition to identifiable strands of collagenous tissue, electron-dense fibrillar structures with the characteristic banding associated with fibrin deposition were observed (Fig. 4) . Typical herpesvirus nucleocapsids were observed within the nuclei of reactive fibroblasts, and enveloped viral particles were observed within intercellular spaces (Fig. 4) . Viral particles were not demonstrated within infiltrating leukocytes. In other tissues examined by light microscopy, lesions were minimal to absent in eyes, lung, liver, kidney, and adrenal glands. Although the virus was isolated from the eyes of a number of animals in this study, there were relatively few animals with demonstrable ocular lesions (Table I) . Focal iritis was most commonly observed, although focal retinitis and/or keratitis were also demonstrated on rare occasions.
