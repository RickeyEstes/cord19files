In the case of the slowest arrival rate, 1 infected traveller per week, the combination of traveller sensitisation and exit and entry screening, the expected benefit (50% of simulations predict delays at least as large as this) is a delay of 83 days (75%: 36 days, 97.5% 8 days) (Table 2, Figure 2 ). If 10 infected travellers per week are simulated the outbreak delay reduces to 8 days (75% 4 days, 97.5%: 1 day). The incremental benefit of syndromic entry screening is highly dependent on the effectiveness of exit screening. With one infected traveller per week, traveller sensitisation and under baseline assumptions of exit screening effectiveness but no entry screening, the outbreak is delayed by 76 days (75%: 33 days, 97.5%: 7 days), indicating that additional entry screening adds little in this case.

Again, this is largely due to exit screening at departure, which on its own is estimated to delay the outbreak by 8 days (75%: 3 days, 97.5%: less than 1 day). As the number of infected travellers increases during the overseas outbreak, the delay in onset of a local outbreak through screening declines rapidly; specifically, if infected traveller numbers approach 10 per week, syndromic screening alone can only delay the outbreak by 1 day (75%: less than 1 day). .

Similarly, we estimate that in the absence of syndromic air traveller screening, traveller sensitisation can delay the outbreak by 29 days (75%: 12 days, 97.5% 3 days) early in the epidemic with 1 infected traveller per week but delays reduce to 3 days (75%: 1 day, 97.5%: less than 1 day) for 10 infected travellers per week. For sensitivity analyses, we varied the effectiveness of traveller sensitisation and the heterogeneity in the number of secondary infections. A 70% reduction in the effective reproduction number through traveller sensitisation followed by rapid case isolation and contact tracing can potentially prevent a local outbreak independent of the number of infected arrivals if the basic reproduction number is smaller than 3.3 (i.e., ). As traveller sensitisation increases and therefore a greater proportion of simulated ܴ Ԣ values are less than 1, the proportion of simulated delays that are infinitely long (indicating that that specific simulated potential outbreak has been averted) increases (Table S1 ). If traveller sensitisation is assumed to be only 30% effective then the associated outbreak delay for the base case with one infected traveller per week and syndromic screening is 23 days (75%: 12 days, 97.5%: 2 days) ( Table  S2 ). If the number of secondary infections is substantially less disperse, e.g. influenza-like, outbreak delays decrease by about 50%, as the outbreak becomes less reliant on occasional super-spreading events ( Figure S1 ). If, however, the number of secondary infections is slightly more disperse, e.g. SARS-like, then outbreak delays are approximately three-fold longer. Additional figures in the appendix show the complementary cumulative density functions, focusing on either variation with traveller sensitisation ( Figure S2 ) or arrival rate ( Figure S3 ). .
