Generation and isolation of mAb from GPdM immunized macaques. We used recombinant GPdM with the deletion of mucin-like domain (MLD) and transmembrane domains to immunize two rhesus macaques (Rh091730 and Rh100888) largely due to the earlier studies indicating the bulky MLD is highly variable and able to shield the critical receptor binding domain (RBD) of Ebola virus glycoprotein 13, 14, 29, 43, 44 . To enhance and promote the maturation of the antibody response, eight consecutive immunizations were performed through intramuscular route at 4-week intervals before the blood samples were collected and evaluated for antibody binding and neutralization activities. Both animals mounted a strong antibody binding activity measured by ELISA as well as neutralizing activity using pseudovirus bearing the glycoprotein of EBOV Mayinga strain (supplementary Fig. 1 ). In particular, Rh100888 appeared to have 3-fold higher neutralizing activities than that of Rh091730 (527 vs. 156 in ID 50 values) (supplementary Fig. 1b) . We have therefore chosen the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Rh100888 to isolate GPdM-specific single memory B cells (CD3 − , CD16 − , CD235a − , CD19 + , CD27 + , CD38 − , and IgG + ) by FACS (supplementary Fig. 1c ) and to amplify the variable regions of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes (VH and VL) by an optimized nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 27 paired VH and VL sequences from the sorted single B cells were obtained and fused with the constant region fragment of human IgG1 to generate bivalent full-length chimeric mAbs. Once confirmed by sequencing, the full-length heavy and light chain plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells for the production, purification and characterization of mAbs. Binding and neutralizing activity against pseudo and live Ebola virus infection. We first analyzed the binding activity of isolated mAbs to four different forms of EBOV GP including the recombinant GPdM, sGP, and GPcl as well as GP with deletion of MLD (GPdMuc) expressed on the surface of 293T cells. Among the total of 27 mAbs successfully isolated and produced, 5 (Q203, Q206, Q314, Q411 and Q703) had detectable binding to GPdM measured by ELISA. Q206, Q314 and Q411 demonstrated strong binding affinity comparable to that of the control mAbs c13C6 and KZ52 while Q203 or Q703 was merely above the detection threshold (Fig. 1a ). Similar differences were also found in the binding to GPdMuc expressed on the surface of 293T cells, suggesting that binding of these mAbs is independent of MLD. Like c13C6, Q206, Q314 and Q411 bound strongly to sGP indicating their epitopes are located in the N-terminus of GP1 subunit where GPdM and sGP share amino acid residues between 31-295 29 . Interestingly, Q206 and Q411 maintained strong binding to the glycan cap missing GPcl while Q314 and c13C6 failed, suggesting that Q206 and Q411 recognized epitopes distinct from that by Q314 and c13C6. Genetically, each of the 5 mAbs had unique VH and VL sequences although Q206 and Q411 shared homologous sequence throughout except for the CDR3 sequence in VH ( Table 1 ). The gene families of the 5 mAbs were quite divergent for both VH (1 V H 1, 1 V H 2, 2 V H 3, and 1 V H 4) and VL (3 V λ 1, and 2 V λ 2) with variable degree of divergence (90.1-95.3%) from the rhesus macaque germline sequences ( Table 1 ). The degree of humanness of these recombinant full-length mAbs ranged from 97.3-99.7% by analyzing the amino acid sequence compared with human immunoglobulin gene using germline index 45 . Neutralizing activity of Q203, Q206, Q314, Q411 and Q703 was then tested on the susceptible Vero-E6 cells against Ebola pseudovirus bearing the surface glycoprotein of EBOV, SUDV, BDBV, RESTV, or TAFV ( Fig. 1b and Table 2 ). Consistent with binding activity, Q206, Q314 and Q411 demonstrated potent neutralization against EBOV (Mayinga strain) with IC 50 values ranging from 0.36 to 0.78 μ g/ml while Q203 and Q703 showed negligible effect ( Fig. 1b and Table 2 ). Like KZ52, Q206, Q314 and Q411 were able to reach IC 90 but c13C6 plateaued prematurely around 70% inhibition despite increases in concentration (Fig. 1b) , consistent with earlier report 46 . Furthermore, differences in slope and AUC were also found among and between isolated and control mAbs, suggesting different mAbs demonstrated different potency and may exert their neutralizing activity through different mechanisms ( Table 2) 47 . None of the isolated mAbs demonstrated any cross-neutralizing activity against the remaining species of Ebolaviruses (SUDV, BDBV, RESTV, or TAFV) or the pseudovirus bearing the envelope glycoprotein from MARV, HIV-1 or VSV. Only c13C6 displayed some level of cross-activity against SUDV strain as previously reported 32 . No cross-binding was found against GPdM from SUDV, BDBV and MARV (supplementary (Fig. 1b) . Furthermore, Q206, Q314 and Q411 also showed potent neutralization against live EBOV virus ( Fig. 1c and Table 2 ). In particular, Q206 and Q411 had similar IC 50 concentrations in the presence or absence of complement suggesting their neutralizing activity is largely independent of complement. In contrast, Q314, like the mAb c13C6 control, required the presence of complement for optimal neutralization although significantly higher neutralization activity was found (Fig. 1c ). Kinetics and competitive binding of isolated mAbs measured by SPR. The observed differences in neutralizing activity against pseudo and live Ebola virus could be due to their differences in binding affinity and epitopes recognized. To test this hypothesis, we measured the binding kinetics of Q206, Q314, and Q411 antigen-binding fragment (Fab) to the recombinant GPdM, sGP, or GPcl by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). As shown in Fig. 2 , the differential binding to these recombinant proteins is consistent with those analyzed by ELISA (Fig. 1a) . Furthermore, the estimated binding affinity to GPdM appeared to correlate with their neutralizing activity (Table 3 ). Q206 demonstrated the strongest binding affinity (K d = 16.1 nM) while Q411 was intermediate (K d = 24.0 nM) and Q314 was the weakest (K d = 44.8 nM). Consistent with earlier report 49 , KZ52 demonstrated a higher binding affinity (K d = 3.4 nM) than the 3 mAbs we isolated, hence also showing stronger neutralizing activity. However, c13C6 was an outlier perhaps due to its unique and unusual neutralization curve in that its inhibitory activity appeared early at the relatively lower concentration and then plateaued prematurely about 70% despite increases in concentration (Fig. 1b) . In contrast, binding affinity to sGP didn't seem to follow their trend in neutralization. Q314, the weakest neutralizing mAb isolated, showed the highest affinity (K d = 6.3 nM) to sGP while Q206 demonstrated the intermediate (K d = 7.1 nM) and Q411 was the weakest (K d = 13.5 nM). Interestingly, removal of the glycan cap from GPdM by thermolysin (GPcl) dramatically increased the binding of Q206 (from K d = 16.1 to 7.1 nM) while having no effect on Q411 (from K d = 24.0 to 24.0 nM) ( Table 3) . These results highlight the binding affinity to membrane associated (GPdM and GPcl) but not secreted (sGP) form of GP may contribute to the differential neutralizing activity among the isolated mAbs. In particular, as EBOV entry requires cleavage of envelope glycoprotein in the endosome 13, 15 , more favorable binding of Q206 to GPcl over GPdM suggests a possible enhanced inhibitory effect by this mAb during the process of viral entry. We went further to determine the epitopes of the isolated mAbs on GPdM through pairwise competition using SPR. Specifically, pairs of the testing Fabs were sequentially applied to the purified GPdM covalently immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip to monitor for additional binding to determine whether the two mAbs recognized the separate or closely situated epitopes. As shown in Fig. 3a but strongly with Q411 and partially with c13C6. Q314, on the other hand, strongly competed with c13C6, but not with Q206, Q411 or KZ52 (Fig. 3b) . Conversely, Q411 strongly competed with Q206, partially with c13C6 but not with Q314 or KZ52 (Fig. 3c) . These results clearly indicate that Q206 and Q411 recognize an overlapping epitope and so did Q314 and c13C6. The two overlapping epitopes appeared to be closely located but grossly distinct from that recognized by KZ52. Single particle EM reconstructions of GPdM in complex with Q206, Q314 or Q411 Fab. To further determine the epitopes in a more precise manner, negative stain single-particle EM reconstructions were performed with GPdM in complex with Fab of Q206, Q314 or Q411. Each Fab was added in excess to GPdM, purified by size-exclusion chromatography and then subjected to staining and EM analyses (Fig. 4 , supplementary Fig. 3 and supplementary Table 1 ). The structures of Q206-and Q411-GPdM complexes showed that the antibodies bound to novel epitopes within the center of the GPdM chalice, perpendicularly to the expected plane of the membrane and making contacts with a region spanning the glycan cap (cyan) and the head (blue) subdomains of GP1 subunit ( Fig. 4a and supplementary Fig. 3 ). Q314, on the other hand, bound in the vicinity of the glycan cap with an angle of approach much less steep than that of Q206 and Q411 ( Fig. 4a and supplementary  Fig. 3) . To compare the binding sites of Q206, Q314 and Q411 to those of c13C6 and KZ52, we generated a hybrid map based on the structure information obtained here and previously published elsewhere 29 . As shown in Fig 4b, the binding sites for Q206 and Q411 are located next to that of c13C6 but closer to the inner chalice of the GP1 subunit. On the contrary, the Q314 binding sites are located to the opposite side of c13C6 in the glycan cap orientated towards the upper surface of the chalice (Fig. 4b) . As shown previously, the control KZ52 bound the base of GPdM 14, 29 . These results are consistent with those from the epitope mapping studies conducted above and provided a clear three dimensional understanding of the location and distribution of epitopes recognized by Q206, Q314 and Q411 on the GP1 subunit. Epitope mapping through site-directed mutagenesis. To confirm the epitope information obtained, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis on EBOV GPdMuc (Mayinga strain) based on the structural information as well as previously published studies shown to confer resistance to control mAbs c13C6 and KZ52 29, 32, 50 . A total of 23 single mutant clones were generated, one in the base, four in the head, thirteen in the glycan cap of GP1 subunit and five in the GP2 subunit ( 32, 50 , mutations at Q508, C511, N550, and D552 in the GP2 had detrimental effect on KZ52 binding but minimal effect on the rest of the mAbs tested here. Next, we studied whether reduction in binding could confer resistance to mAb neutralization in the context of pseudovirus. To this end, the pseudoviruses bearing the representative mutations were generated and subjected to standard neutralization test (Fig. 5) . Consistent with the binding analysis, T144A and F225A mutations in the head resulted in complete resistance to Q206 and Q411 neutralization with at least 100-fold increase in IC 50 compared to the wild type. Similarly, W275A mutation in the glycan cap and Q508A, N550A and D552A in GP2 subunit also rendered pseudovirus completely resistant to Q314 and c13C6 as well as KZ52, respectively. It needs to be noted that the same set of mutations had some noticeable cross-effect on neutralization activity of other mAbs, but all limited within the 10-fold differences from the wild type and most likely due to the indirect consequences (Fig. 5b) . But nevertheless, these results confirm that Q206 and Q411 bind to a novel epitope located between the glycan cap and the head subdomain approaching to RBD in the inner chalice of GP1. Q314, on the other hand, binds to an overlapping epitope with c13C6 in the glycan cap but more towards the upper surface of the chalice. Post attachment inhibition through partial interference with receptor NPC1 binding. To determine potential steps of inhibition, we applied the testing mAbs to pseudoviruses and target Vero-E6 cells in two separate time scales. One was to incubate with pseudoviruses first at 37 °C for 1 h before virus attachment to Vero-E6 cells. The other was allow virus attachment to Vero-E6 cells first at 4 °C for 1 h before adding the testing mAbs and elevating temperature to 37 °C to initiate the virus entry. We reasoned that if the testing mAb inhibited virus attachment to the cell surface, the reduction in luciferase activity would only be detectable in the former experiment. On the other hand, if the testing mAb inhibited the steps after virus attachment, the reduction in luciferase activity would be detectable in both cases. As shown in Fig. 6a , Q206, Q314 and Q411 were all able to reduce luciferase activity more than 90% in both cases, suggesting they inhibited steps after virus attachment. Consistent with earlier reports, the positive control KZ52 also inhibited post-attachment steps while the negative control VRC01 failed in both cases (Fig. 6a) . As the epitopes of Q206 and Q411 located between the glycan cap and the head subdomain approaching to the RBD, Q206 and Q411 may exert their neutralizing activity after attachment through interfering with GPcl binding to the cellular receptor NPC1. To test this hypothesis, we immobilized GPcl to a CM5 sensor chip followed by injection of Q206, Q314 or Q411 separately until reaching the binding steady-state. Domain C of NPC1 (NPC1-C) was then injected to compare the binding kinetics with or without the testing mAbs. As shown in Fig 6b, Protective efficacy in mouse model of EBOV infection. To determine the protective efficacy of isolated mAbs in vivo, we infected mice through intraperitoneal injection (IP) with a dose of 1000 × LD 50 mouse-adapted EBOV and administered Q206, Q314 or Q411 at either 1 or 2 days post infection. All control animals, which received only PBS, succumbed to the virus with an average time of death of 7.4 ± 3.1 days. In contrast, mAb treatment significantly increased survival in infected mice (p-value = 0.028). The highest survival rates were 67% and 50% for the animal groups treated with Q206 48h (p-value = 0.0033) and Q411 at 24 h (p-value = 0.0169) ( Table 5) . Interestingly, the degree of weight change did not correlate with protective efficacy. In fact, the two groups with the highest survival also had the highest weight loss (supplementary Fig. 4 ). Discussion. The unprecedented EBOV outbreak in West Africa in 2014 has affected more people than all previously recorded outbreaks combined and highlighted the threat to global health 1,51,52 . While significant process has been made in therapeutics and vaccines against EBOV, no licensed products are currently available 18, 19, [22] [23] [24] [25] . Combination of monoclonal antibodies represent one of the most specific and promising therapeutic modalities [22] [23] [24] [25] and one such cocktail ZMapp has demonstrated safety and efficacy in nonhuman primates as well as encouraging results in compassionate use in humans although the development for clinical application requires further studies 24, 28 . These antibodies, together with most of the published ones, are directed to several vulnerable sites on the surface of GP including the glycan cap, mucin-like domain and the base of GP where the GP1 and GP2 interact 14, 29 . All neutralizing mAbs, however, target to the overlapping epitopes in the base of GP while those do not neutralize or do not neutralize in the absence of complement bind to the glycan cap and mucin-like dom ains 14, 29, 31, 32, 36 . The most recent studies have isolated a large number of mAbs from convalescent individuals with neutralizing activities targeting to additional sites on the GP [38] [39] [40] . This study aimed to identify neutralizing mAbs targeting additional sites on the GP of Ebola virus identified in 2014 1 . Through sequential immunization of Chinese rhesus macaques with recombinant GPdM and antigen-specific single B cell sorting, we have successfully isolated and characterized three mAbs (Q206, Q314 and Q411) with potent neutralizing activities against pseudo and live EBOV. Epitope mapping through differential binding, single-particle EM reconstructions and site-directed mutagenesis have revealed that Q206 and Q411 bind to novel and overlapping epitopes spanning the glycan cap and the head subdomain approaching to the RBD in the inner chalice of GP1. Q314, on the other hand, binds to an overlapping epitope with c13C6 in the glycan cap but orientated towards the upper surface of the chalice. In distinct contrast to c13C6 and other mAbs binding to the similar or adjacent epitopes, the newly isolated mAbs are completely or partially independent of complement in live EBOV neutralization. In particular, all these novel mAbs are able to achieve close to 100% inhibition of live EBOV in the presence of complement while c13C6 plateaued just above 50% inhibition. Furthermore, treatment with these mAbs provided partial but significant protection against disease progression in a mouse model of EBOV infection. Collectively, these results suggest that Q206 and Q411 recognize novel epitopes in the Table 4 . Impact of mutant residues on mAb binding to surface expressed GPdMuc. * "+ " indicates at least 50% reduction in fluorescent intensity compared to the wild type and "− " indicates complete abolish of antibody binding. GP1 with potent neutralizing activity and could serve as promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against Ebola virus infection. We believe that the neutralizing mAbs identified here represent a new arsenal against EBOV infection. The most potent and protective mAbs, Q206 and Q411, recognize overlapping epitopes within the core of GP1, a region that encompasses the RBD and the base of GP1 14, 29, 32 . While previous studies suggested that this region may be concealed before proteolysis by endosomal cathepsins and receptor binding 15, 29, 53 , the binding as well as neutralizing profile of Q206 and Q411 indicated this region contains opening spots for antibody binding and neutralization at the early steps during viral entry. While the exact underlying mechanism requires further investigation, it appeared that Q206 and Q411 exert their neutralization activity through interfering with GP binding to its receptor NPC-1 which may lead to affecting the subsequent fusion between viral and cellular membrane. This hypothesis is further supported by the mutagenesis study where mutant virus with T144, a residue located at the edge of RBD critical for NPC-1 binding 54 , became resistant to Q206 and Q411 (Fig. 5 and Table 4 ). For Q314, however, the mechanism of action is far less clear. Despite of its overlapping epitope with c13C6, Q314 protective activity in the mouse model is much less effective 31 , perhaps due to the differences in exact epitope, the The testing mAb were applied to pseudovirus and Vero-E6 cells before or after attachment and (b) Competitive binding of the testing mAbs with NPC1-C to immobilized GPcl on a chip. The blocking efficacy was determined as 12.9% for Q206, 3.9% for Q314, 14.9% for Q411, and 72.7% for control mAb 114, respectively. affinity, the approaching angle or the Fc-mediated functions of the antibody to the GP. Of note, it is important to recognize that neutralizing activity does not always translate into protective activity in mouse model and mouse model can't always predict the monkey model. The ultimate test will have to be conducted in human before any meaningful protective activity could be evaluated and determined. In any case, it would be interesting to study whether the combination of our newly isolated mAbs could have any synergistic effect to provide stronger and broader neutralizing and protective activities against wild-type and mutant EBOV 14, [22] [23] [24] [25] [33] [34] [35] [36] 49 . Although the current dataset for EBOV shows a limited degree of sequence variation, this is by no means to suggest the virus will remain unchanged in the long run given their wide spread in several animal species, continuing zoonotic introductions into and rapid transmission within human population 7, 8, 12, 50, [55] [56] [57] . With the potent neutralizing mAbs identified here and their novel epitope specificities, we are at more advantageous position to generate and optimize next-generation of therapeutic antibody cocktail against EBOV infection.
