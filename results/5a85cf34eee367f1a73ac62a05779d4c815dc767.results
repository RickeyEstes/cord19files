Growth patterns of virulent F. tularensis Schu S4, waaY::TrgTn and LVS in newly transformed human alveolar type 2 cells Our research group and others have previously reported the entry and growth properties of Francisella strains within various tissue culture cell lines such as: A549s, HEp-2 cells, J774s, THP-1 cells, and others. [19, 21, 22, 30, 31] . While useful for dissecting aspects of intracellular growth, these cell lines have likely lost many of the characteristics of primary (or short passage) cells and thus may not accurately reflect key aspects of the host-pathogen interaction [32, 33] . Due to the variability of these cell lines, it is possible that important details about the growth of F. tularensis organisms in appropriate respiratory epithelial cells remain unknown. In order to better understand the interactions of Francisella with AT-II cells, we conducted experiments with recently immortalized primary human AT-II cells, to compare the interactions of virulent F. tularensis Schu S4, and the F. tularensis LVS strain in these cells. Additionally, we characterized the O-antigen mutant, Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn (FTT_1236), which has been previously reported to have 10-fold higher uptake and growth kinetics in human MDM cells [24] . The organism grows robustly within human MDMs until 16 hours post-infection when the organisms cease growing and it becomes difficult to detect cells on the slide to perform microscopy. The abilities of the three Francisella strains to enter and replicate within human AT-II cells were compared by infecting the cells with Schu S4, Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn, an attenuated LPS/ capsule mutant, or LVS for either 4 or 24 hours. Both gentamicin protection assays and confocal microscopy were performed to acquire quantitative uptake and growth data, as well as to obtain qualitative data about the bacterial-host cell interactions. At 4 hours post-infection, the Schu S4 and LVS strains were detected entering into the primary human AT-II cells at comparable levels ( Fig 1A) . In comparison, the Schu waaY::TrgTn strain had uptake levels into the human AT-II cells that were consistently~2-fold higher than that observed for either Schu S4 or LVS; however, this increase was not significant ( Fig 1A) . Interestingly, at the 24 hour time point there were significant differences in the bacterial burden in cells infected with Schu S4 compared to the cells infected with Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn or LVS (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Similar to work that our lab has previously reported for other tissue culture epithelial cell lines, Schu S4 entered and replicated~1600-fold over the 24 hour course of the experiment ( Fig 1B) . We saw no apparent sign of cell death by cells infected with Schu S4 at 24 hours although we estimated that the cells that were infected contained 2,500-5,000 cfu. Conversely, following entry into human AT-II cells, the F. tularensis LVS strain grew significantly less well than wild type Schu S4, as we saw only 12-fold growth over 24 hours (Fig 1B) . One possibility to explain the difference in growth in the AT-II cells was a difference in FPI expression between F. tularensis Schu S4 and F. tularensis LVS. In previous work from our lab we demonstrated that Schu S4 expresses the FPI genes 3-fold higher than LVS [30] . To determine if the poor growth of LVS observed in the human AT-II cells might be due to low FPI expression, we increased FPI gene expression by overexpression of fevR. As a control, Miller assays were performed which demonstrated that overexpression of FevR from this plasmid increases an iglA-lacZ reporter (4-fold) (data not shown). However, even when fevR gene expression was substantially increased in LVS the AT-II cell growth defect was not rescued (Fig 1B) . Additionally, it has been demonstrated that nutrient availability (i.e. amino acids) is important for Francisella cytosolic cell growth [34] . To determine if the poor growth of LVS is due to a lack of amino acids, Casamino acids (1% w/v) were added to the cell media and infections were performed. The addition of free amino acids to the growth medium of cells during infection did not rescue the LVS growth phenotype, however, since this was a negative result, it is possible that addition of Casamino acids did not increase cytosolic amino acid availability and so better controls are needed to definitively test if the LVS phenotype is due to low cytosolic amino acid concentrations ( Fig 1B) . The growth pattern of the Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn strain in the human AT-II cells paralleled its growth pattern in human MDMs. Similar to MDM cells, there was significant growth within human AT-II cells until 16 hours post-infection [24] , but then the bacteria failed to maintain that growth (Fig 1A) . Since the Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn stops growing after~16 hours within the human AT-II cells, a significant impact on the growth of the strain was observed (~90-fold growth over 24 hours) ( Fig 1B) . As a second method to examine the interactions of Francisella strains with immortalized primary human AT-II cells, a similar set of experiments examined the interactions of the bacteria with these cells using confocal microscopy. As expected, there were no significant observable differences at 4 hours post-infection between Schu S4, Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn and the LVS strains (Fig 2) . Cells containing bacteria typically had one organism per cell and no apparent replication had occurred at this time point (Fig 2) . However, by 24 hours there were several notable differences between the three strains that correlated well with the bacterial count data shown in Fig 1. AT-II cells infected with F. tularensis Schu S4 clearly allowed vigorous replication as observed by the filling of cell cytosol with GFP-labeled F. tularensis (Fig 2) . In contrast, the majority of LVS-infected cells at 24 hours post infection still contained only a single bacterium, suggesting that LVS was significantly impaired in its ability to replicate within the human AT-II cells compared to the Schu S4 strain (Fig 2) . Some growth was observed within LVS infected cells, however, these cells were relatively rare and growth appeared to be limited to no more than a few rounds of replication. It is possible that these cells containing replicating LVS could have been damaged or less fit somehow, but this could not be ascertained by the confocal microscopy performed. Cells infected with F. tularensis Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn had an intermediate growth phenotype, in that infected cells contained a range of bacteria, from a couple of bacteria per cell, to cells nearly filled with organisms (Fig 2) . The reduced growth phenotype is likely due to host cell recognition of the mutant, which lacks capsule and O-side chain additions to the lipid A-core sugar molecules in the outer membrane, and early cell death. To semi-quantitatively analyze the growth patterns of each of the three Francisella strains in AT-II cells, we scored infected cells for the number of bacteria that were inside an infected cell 24 hours post-infection. Cells were placed into one of three groups: 5 or less intracellular bacteria, between 6-35 intracellular bacteria, and greater than 35 intracellular bacteria. More than 300 cells for each strain were counted from three separate experiments. Using this scoring criteria, greater than 80% of the Schu S4-infected cells had robust growth with more than 35 bacteria, whereas there were almost no LVS-infected cells (<1%) that had greater than 35 bacteria (P < 0.001) (Fig 3) . The majority (> 80%) of infected LVS cells had 1-5 bacteria per infected cell, while cells infected with the Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn strain separated into the three categories equally (Fig 3) . These data provide a clearer picture that F. tularensis Schu S4 replicates robustly in human AT-II cells while F. tularensis LVS has a low capacity to grow in the cytosol of these cells, although it is taken up at the same level as the wild type Schu S4. Furthermore, the F. tularensis Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn strain displays a similar growth phenotype in human AT-II cells as that observed in human MDMs, in that the strains grow well for~16 hours or so before growth levels off. The mechanism for why this mutation results in this cell growth phenotype is unknown and is under active investigation. Transmission electron microscopy of early Francisella interactions with murine lung tissue The interactions between AT-II cells and various Francisella strains suggest that these pathogenic bacteria have the ability to cross the epithelial barrier by the internalization of Francisella into an epithelial cell. Additionally, if LVS replicates only poorly in AT-II cells in vivo these interactions may help to explain why the respiratory virulence of LVS for mice is significantly reduced compared to the virulent Schu S4 strain. Although there has been some investigation into the role of AT-II cells in vivo, to our knowledge there has never been any TEM evidence confirming internalization in vivo. To better understand the early events that lead to establishment of pneumonic tularemia and to determine if F. tularensis can be internalized into AT-II cells in vivo, mice were infected intranasally with F. tularensis Schu S4, Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn, LVS or PBS (negative control). In addition, to the intracellular growth defects observed in the Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn mutant, this strain displays decreased virulence in mice, and mice immunized with Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn demonstrated some protection against a wild type Schu S4 challenge [24, 35] . Furthermore, through observation of the mice and histopathology, the cause of death is different between Schu S4 and the waaY mutant, (multiple organ failure and suffocation due to fluid filled lungs, respectively) [35, 36] . These data suggest that the Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn strain induces a host response that is distinct from that caused by wild type organisms. At 16 or 24 hours post-infection, mice were euthanized and the lungs were perfused and processed for TEM imaging. A MOI of 100 bacteria per alveolus was used to increase the probability of detecting organisms within the lung tissues. Organisms of each strain were observed in lung cells at either 16 or 24 hours post-infection, but none were observed in the lungs of mice inoculated with PBS as a control. Due to the staining and TEM imaging, some of the images taken at low magnification had dark staining that often made distinguishing Francisella from lamellar bodies (organelle that packages surfactant) difficult. However, upon higher magnification there were stark differences observed between the bacterium and lamellar bodies. F. tularensis was differentiated from lamellar bodies by dark, often smooth or bubbly staining (likely the chromosomal DNA) that was spread throughout the organism and the bacteria clearly lacked the stratified staining characteristic of the lamellar granules (Fig 4) . Lamellar granules are organelles unique to AT-II cells that package and secrete surfactant and are visible in TEM imaging by their stratified staining that alternates between dark and white linear bands created from the tight packaging of surfactant membranes [11] . Furthermore, bacteria were also characterized by identification of a double membrane (Fig 4C) . Using these characteristics, we were able to reliably identify bacteria of each strain in our TEM images. In examining infected lung tissue we occasionally, although rarely, observed an alveolar macrophage containing an internalized organism that was within the airspace of an alveolus (5 cells total across all samples, data not shown). The most common cell type observed to contain Francisella were AT-II epithelial cells (Fig 5) . AT-II cells were identified as the cells that produced microvilli at the cell::air interface and contained lamellar granules. Multiple AT-II cells were observed that contained 1-3 bacteria from lungs infected with each of the three Francisella strains (Fig 5) . It was also interesting to note that the AT-II cells typically bordered pulmonary capillaries, highlighting that once the organisms entered an AT-II cell they could gain access to the bloodstream with little impediment. Furthermore, while there might be small differences in quantitative uptake of the different Francisella strains into the AT-II cells, no differences could be determined using TEM.
