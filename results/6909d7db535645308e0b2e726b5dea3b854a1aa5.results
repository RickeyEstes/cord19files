Serum, whole blood, and rectal and nasal swabs were freshly collected from DC, sheep, and goats in November and December of 2013 in the southwestern (Gizan), western (Taif), northwestern (Tabuk), eastern (Hofuf), and central (Unizah, Riyadh) regions of the KSA (Table 1) . We also collected archived serum samples obtained from DC in 1992 through 2010 (Table 2 ). Sera were initially tested for the presence of antibodies reactive with MERS-CoV by using a cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on Vero cells infected with MERS-CoV. Subsets of sera positive by ELISA were tested in Western blot assays that used extracts of Vero cells infected with MERS-CoV and a luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay based on recombinant MERS-CoV nucleoprotein. Potential serologic cross-reactivity with bovine coronavirus (Bo-CoV) was addressed by testing for reactivity with Bo-CoV nucleocapsid protein by LIPS assay. The presence of viral nucleic acids in rectal and nasal swabs and a subset of serum and whole blood samples was assayed by reverse transcriptionquantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) with primers targeting the upE and ORF1a genome regions of MERS-CoV (16, 17) . One hundred fifty (74%) of 203 DC sampled countrywide in 2013 were found to have antibodies to MERS-CoV by ELISA. The prevalence of seropositivity was higher in adult DC (Ͼ2 years of age; 93/98, 95%) than in juvenile DC (Յ2 years of age; 57/104, 55%) (P Ͻ 0.0001, 2 test). The lowest prevalence of seropositive juveniles was found in the southwestern region, in proximity to the city of Gizan (1/21, 5%) (Fig. 1A) . A higher prevalence of antibodies to MERS-CoV in older animals was also seen in samples obtained in years prior to 2012. In 2010, the seroprevalence was 76% (16/21) in juveniles versus 91% (21/23) in adults in the central region (Riyadh, Kharj). In 2009, the seroprevalence was 72% (40/56) in juveniles versus 92% (24/26) in adults (Riyadh, Rumah) ( Table 2) . Seroreactivity was also found in samples collected from DC as early as the 1990s: 1/1 (100%) in 1992, 2/2 (100%) in 1993, 114/123 (93%) in 1994, 6/6 (100%) in 1996, and 6/6 (100%) in 2003. Analysis of selected seropositive DC sera by Western immunoblot assay indicated two distinct reaction patterns that showed reactivity either to MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein alone or to spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. These results were concordant with results of MERS-CoV nucleocapsid LIPS assays ( Fig. 2 ; see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Potential serologic cross-reactivity to Bo-CoV was addressed by analyzing Bo-CoV nucleocapsid reactivity, which has been shown to be subgroup specific in CoVs (18) . Overall, 17% (35/ 203) of DC were positive for Bo-CoV, ranging from 3% in the southwest (Gizan) to 25% in the east (Hofuf) and 20% in adult animals versus 14% in juvenile animals; 2 animals (juveniles in Taif) were seropositive for Bo-CoV exclusively, while the remaining 16% (33/203) were reactive to Bo-CoV and MERS-CoV, and 58% (117/203) were reactive to MERS-CoV alone (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Rectal and nasal swabs collected in parallel with serum samples from the same animals were assayed for MERS-CoV nucleic acids by RT-qPCR. Nucleic acids were most frequently detected in nasal swabs; rectal swabs were found positive in only three cases; in two of them, the nasal sample was also positive. The regional distribution of PCR-positive animals is shown in Fig. 1B . In contrast to serology, where MERS-CoV-reactive antibodies were more prevalent in adults than in juveniles (95% versus 55%), MERS-CoV nucleic acids were found more frequently in juveniles (36/104, 35%) than in adults (15/98, 15%) (P ϭ 0.003, 2 test). The five samples with Ͼ10 6 copies were all from juveniles, four of them from seronegative animals. The prevalence of PCR-positive DC ranged from 66% in Taif in the west to 0% in Gizan in the southwest. PCR analysis of a random selection of serum and whole blood samples collected from nasal or rectal swab PCR-positive, seropositive, and seronegative DC revealed no evidence of viremia (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). These included 13 adults and 29 juveniles phlebotomized in 2009, 15 adults and 14 juveniles phlebotomized in 2010, and 8 adults and 13 juveniles phlebotomized in 2013. These animals included the five juveniles with the highest viral genome sequence load in nasal swabs. Serum samples collected from goats (n ϭ 36) and sheep (n ϭ 112) in 2013 in the central region (Unizah, Riyadh) were not immunoreactive with MERS-CoV but were immunoreactive with Bo-CoV (25% of goats, n ϭ 36; 54% of sheep, n ϭ 24). Nasal swabs from 36 goats and 78 sheep were negative in RT-qPCR assays for MERS-CoV upE. To test the validity of RT-qPCR results and determine phylogenetic relationships of viral sequences found in DC in the KSA to previously reported sequences, we amplified and sequenced longer regions of the spike, ORF1ab, and nucleocapsid genes from RT-qPCR-positive samples (for the sequences of the primers used, see Table S2 in the supplemental material). Eleven of 13 swab samples with Ͼ10 5 copies in upE RT-qPCR yielded products for sequencing. No suitable products were obtained from samples with lighter viral sequence loads (Ͻ10 4 copies) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Phylogenetic analysis of a 1,044nucleotide (nt) region of the spike gene and a 2,004-nt region of the ORF1ab gene indicated Ͻ1% divergence from previously published MERS-CoV sequences (Fig. 3 ) (GenBank accession no. KJ396756 to KJ396771). The nucleocapsid sequence was identical to the previously reported MERS-CoV sequences.
