Atg5 Protects against Lethal MNV Infection in the Absence of IFNa/b Signaling To test the hypothesis that autophagy proteins are involved in IFNg-mediated antiviral defense, we analyzed the role of (A and B) Survival curves after per oral inoculation with 3 3 10 4 pfu of MNV. The number of mice used is indicated in parentheses. Experimental groups were compared to C57BL/6 controls (A). Atg5-deficient mice were compared to control mice (B). (C and D) Growth analysis of MNV in control (circle; Atg5 flox/flox ) and Atg5-deficient (square; Atg5 flox/flox +LysMcre) macrophages after pretreatment with none (filled) or 100 U/ml IFNg (open) for 12 hr before infection at MOI = 5 (C) and 0.05 (D). Mean virus titers ± SEM from three independent experiments (n = 3) are shown. See also Figure S1 . Atg5 in control of disease induced by the enteric pathogen MNV. We first confirmed that mice lacking both IFNa/b and IFNg receptors (IFNa/b/ gR À/À ) succumb to lethal infection with 3 3 10 4 plaque forming units (pfu) of MNV ( Figure 1A ) (Karst et al., 2003; Mumphrey et al., 2007) . In contrast, mice lacking either the IFNa/bR or the IFNgR alone are resistant to lethal MNV infection ( Figure 1A ). These data indicate that IFNa/b and IFNg share overlapping but nonredundant roles in defense against MNV. As for many viruses, the antiviral role of IFNg, and therefore proteins required for IFNg control of MNV infection in vivo, may then be detected when compensatory IFNa/b responses are absent. Atg5 is essential for autophagosome formation and Atg5-deficient mice die soon after birth (Levine et al., 2011) . To test the role of Atg5 in IFNgdependent resistance to MNV infection, we generated IFNa/ bR À/À mice lacking Atg5 in macrophages and neutrophils that express lysozyme M. We crossed Atg5 flox/flox mice expressing lysozyme-M promoter driven cre-recombinase (Atg5 flox/flox +LysMcre) (Zhao et al., 2008; DeSelm et al., 2011) to IFNa/bR À/À mice, generating IFNa/bR À/À x Atg5 flox/flox + LysMcre mice. We then compared MNV infection of IFNa/ bR À/À x Atg5 flox/flox +LysMcre mice to infection of control IFNa/bR À/À x Atg5 flox/flox mice. Mice deficient in Atg5 in macrophages and neutrophils succumbed to lethal MNV infection while control mice did not ( Figure 1B ). While MNV replication is confined to certain tissues (mesenteric lymph node, intestine, spleen, and liver) in immune-competent mice, MNV replication is widely disseminated in immune-compromised mice (Karst et al., 2003; Mumphrey et al., 2007) . Consistent with this, MNV replication was significantly increased in all tissues examined from IFNa/bR À/À x Atg5 flox/flox +LysMcre mice compared to tissues of control IFNa/bR À/À x Atg5 flox/flox mice (Figures S1A-S1F available online). These data demonstrate that Atg5 expression in macrophages and/or neutrophils was essential for control of MNV infection in mice with compromised IFNa/b signaling.
