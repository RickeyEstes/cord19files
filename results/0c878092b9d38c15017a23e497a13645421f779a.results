Early SARS demonstrates several patterns including poorly defined rounded airspace lesions, airspace disease of subsegmental size and airspace disease of segmental size. Of 24 cases with focal or multifocal (but not diffuse) disease, 21 had true positive (TP) machine detections (88%). For these 24 cases, there were 35 true-positive (TP) and 31 false-positive (FP) locations marked, an average of 1.3 FP marks per image. A subset of these cases with one or two small foci of disease was also evaluated. 12 of these had one small focus and two had two small foci. Of these 16 foci, 15 were detected by the RS-SARS providing a sensitivity of 94%, with 1.1 false-positive detections per image. The detection performance on CR, DR, and digitized chest radiographs is similar.
