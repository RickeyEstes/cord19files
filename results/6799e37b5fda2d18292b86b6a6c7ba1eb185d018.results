IFN induces endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol accumulation. To assess the role of LE/L cholesterol as a host cell factor, we first determined whether IFN-␤ induces changes in LE/L cholesterol pools. Therefore, we used filipin, a highly fluorescent polyene that specifically binds free cholesterol and is well established as a histochemical marker for the detection of unesterified cellular cholesterol. Filipin stained the plasma membrane as well as intracellular compartments in A549 wild-type control cells (A549-WT), whereas cholesterol was prominently detected in vesicular structures in the perinuclear region in IFN-␤-treated cells (10 ng/ml, 16 h). This is especially evident in the heat map representation, where the pixels (px) are encoded by different colors due to their intensities (Fig. 1A) . To verify that the stronger perinuclear filipin signal was due to elevated levels of LE/L cholesterol rather than to a general expansion of this compartment, we next determined the degree of overlap of the LysoTracker Red DND-99 signals with the filipin signals using Manders' coefficient. This method identifies those pixels which are doubly positive for both signals and calculates the ratio of their summed signal intensities from one channel to the total intensity in this channel. Thus, a greater coefficient is a good indicator of greater numbers of doubly positive pixels. Because the analysis was performed on z-stacks acquired from confocal microscopy, an axial dimension to each pixel was added, thus including the entire volume of the cell. As shown in Fig. 1A , this quantitative colocalization analysis confirmed that a significantly higher number of LysoTracker-positive pixels were also positive for filipin in IFN-treated cells than in control cells. Similar results were obtained when the colocalization analysis was performed using CD63 as a marker for LE/L (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material), underscoring the idea that cholesterol pools are indeed increased in LE/L upon IFN exposure. Additionally, we have related the number of those voxels that are positive for both filipin and LysoTracker or CD63 signals to the total number of LysoTracker-positive (or CD63-positive) voxels. For both LE/L markers, the ratio is increased after IFN treatment, indicating a higher number of filipin-positive voxels which are also positive for the LE/L markers, regardless of the intensity of the filipin or Lysotracker/CD63 signal strength (Fig. S1B) . Overexpression of the IFN-inducible antiviral protein IFITM3 has been linked to LE/L cholesterol accumulation (6, 10) , and yet the functional relevance of this link, especially in the context of IFN-driven viral restriction, is not fully understood (6, (9) (10) (11) (12) . To functionally dissect the impact of LE/L cholesterol and IFITM3, we assessed whether the IFN-driven increase in LE/L cholesterol pools was still present in A549 IFITM3 knockout cells (A549-IFITM3KO), generated through the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Notably, these cells were able to respond to IFN, as assessed by IFN-mediated STAT1 induction, and yet were completely devoid of IFITM3 even under IFN stimulation conditions (Fig. S2A ). In contrast, the homologous IFITM2 protein, which displays 91% sequence similarity (15) and also colocalizes with lysosomes (8, 16) , was still upregulated in IFN-stimulated A549-IFITM3KO cells and yet the level of upregulation was very moderate (Fig. S2B) . Although IFITM2 was also reported to induce cholesterol accumulation in endosomes (10), very weak IFN-stimulated IFITM2 induction, which was previously observed in the A549 cell line (17), did not compensate for the loss of IFITM3, as the IFITM3KO cells did not accumulate LE/L cholesterol upon IFN treatment (Fig. 1B) . Consistently, colocalization of filipin with the LysoTracker signals was significantly decreased in the IFITM3KO cells after IFN treatment (Fig. 1B) . To further substantiate these observations biochemically, we quantified and compared cholesterol levels in cell fractions enriched for either early endosomes or LE/L through sucrose gradient flotation separation of untreated or IFN-exposed cells. As shown in Fig. 1C , in both IFN-treated A549-WT and IFITM3KO cells, the cholesterol amounts in the postnuclear supernatants and in the early endosomal fractions were not significantly altered upon IFN treatment. However, IFN-treated A549-WT cells had significantly more cholesterol in the LE/L-enriched fractions than were seen with the untreated cells, whereas in IFITM3KO cells, no such increase was observed in this fraction, in line with the results obtained from the quantitative colocalization analysis. Together, these results show that IFN induces retention of cholesterol within LE/L and underscore the importance of IFN-driven upregulation of IFITM3 in this process, thereby confirming previous reports (10) . Interestingly, we observed that LysoTracker-positive compartments clustered in IFN-treated A549-WT cells, whereas they failed to do so in IFN-treated IFITM3KO cells. However, the IFITM3KO cells did not display a general defect in endosomal repositioning, as the clustered filipin-positive endosomes were seen upon treatment with 2 g/ml of the hydrophobic polyamine U18666A, a cell-permeable small-molecule inhibitor of the endosomal cholesterol transporter NPC1 (18, 19) , which is widely used as a pharmacological model to induce the NPC1 loss-of-function phenotype of LE/L cholesterol accumulation (Fig. S2C ). Because this observation indicated that the endosomal clustering seen upon IFN treatment was dependent on the IFITM3-mediated increase in the LE/L cholesterol load, we next overexpressed NPC1. As shown in Fig. 2A , NPC1 overexpression in resting A549-WT cells did not alter the intracellular distribution of acidic endosomes. However, the IFN-induced LE/L clustering was clearly affected; IFN-treated A549-WT cells transfected with NPC1 displayed a LE/L distribution that resembled that in untreated cells, while the IFN-induced clustering was clearly recognizable in the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transfected control cells. To check whether the LE/L of IFITM3KO cells, which do not show IFN-induced clustering, can be repositioned by forced LE/L cholesterol loading, we treated IFITM3KO cells with U18666A. In line with the notion that IFN-induced LE/L cholesterol accumulation was the reason for LE/L clustering, these cells showed similar redistributions of LysoTrackerpositive endosomes after U18666A treatment ( Fig. 2A) . To further substantiate the importance of endosomal cholesterol levels in the LE/L positioning, we studied the distribution of the acidic endosomes more systematically. Therefore, we used softwareassisted image analysis to quantify the number of neighbors (within a 30-px radius) of each LysoTracker-positive endosome in the individual cells. As shown in Fig. 2B , the endosomes of the IFN-treated A549-WT cells tended to have a greater number of neighbors, i.e., they were more densely crowded than acid endosomes in the untreated cells. Similarly, in the U18666A-treated IFITM3KO cells, the number of neighbors per acidic endosome was increasing. In summary, these results clearly show the dependency of LE/L positioning on LE/L cholesterol content. Interferon-independent LE/L cholesterol accumulation inhibits early IAV infection. To assess whether the IFN-induced increase in LE/L cholesterol levels was a side effect or a vital part of the IFN antiviral protection, we investigated LE/L cholesterol imbalance independently of IFN. For analysis of its physiological functions during the early stages of the infection, we aimed at impairing the egress of cholesterol from LE/L. To focus on early infection, we determined the proportion of infected cells within the first replication cycle. Therefore, nuclei of infected cells were analyzed 4 h postinfection (p.i.) for the appearance of the viral nucleoprotein (NP), which is predominantly nuclear at this stage of the infection cycle. Because NPC1 is a key element in the cholesterol transport from this compartment to other cellular destinations, increased cholesterol Late Endosomal Cholesterol Protects against IAV Entry ® levels were first induced via overexpression of AnxA6, a negative regulator of NPC1 (13, (20) (21) (22) . As expected, a high proportion (76.0% Ϯ 1.15%) of the GFP-positive control cells was infected, as revealed by the nuclear appearance of NP. In contrast to that, a much lower number of cells ectopically overexpressing AnxA6-GFP were NP positive (32.67% Ϯ 4.37%). In line with the notion that enhanced LE/L cholesterol negatively affects IAV early infection, the proportion of infected cells strongly increased (62.0% Ϯ 4.62%) when NPC1 was transiently coexpressed together with AnxA6 in these cells (Fig. 3A) . To validate this finding, we next employed an established cell model consisting of the parental A431-WT cell line naturally lacking endogenous AnxA6 and of the A431-AnxA6 cell line engineered to stably express AnxA6 and thus showing an excess of LE/L cholesterol (13, (20) (21) (22) . Both cell lines were infected with PR8 and monitored for NP staining 4 h p.i. As shown in Fig. 3B , the number of cells with NP-positive nuclei was decreased by approximately 50% in A431-AnxA6 cells compared to A431-WT cells. Strikingly, ectopic NPC1 expression in WT cells did not change the percentage of infected cells, whereas, in the A431-AnxA6 cells, NPC1 expression almost completely rescued the reduced proportion of infected cells in the single cycle (Fig. 3B ). This suggests that an optimal concentration of cholesterol in LE/L membranes is required for efficient early infection. Next, we compared the numbers of NP-positive cells in IFN-␤primed A431-WT cells ectopically expressing the tagged cholesterol transporter NPC1 or empty vector (GFP). As expected, infection of nontreated A431-WT cells expressing GFP yielded a high number of infected cells, whereas IFN-␤ pretreatment drastically reduced the numbers of NP-positive nuclei (Fig. 3C ). Of note, NPC1 overexpression significantly increased the amounts of NP-positive nuclei in IFN-␤-primed A431-WT cells. Thus, NPC1 overexpression counteracted the host-protective role of IFN, supporting the idea that the IFN/IFITM3-induced increase in LE/L cholesterol is a part of the innate immune response against IAV. In the second experimental approach, we treated A549-WT cells with the NPC1 inhibitor U18666A. To exclude the possibility that any U18666A effect was due to an induction of IFITM3-mediated cholesterol imbalance, the A549-IFITM3KO cells were investigated in parallel. Because the proportion of infected cells was increased in these cells, a lower virus titer was used in order to maintain a dynamic assay window also in the A549-IFITM3KO cells. A drastically reduced number of NP-positive nuclei were detected in U18666A-treated A549-WT cells (Fig. 3D) . Importantly, U18666A treatment had the same negative effect on early IAV infection in the IFITM3KO cells (which are able to accumulate cholesterol in LE/L under conditions of treatment with U18666A; see Fig. S2C ), indicating that LE/L cholesterol accumulation exerts a host-protective function independently of IFITM3 induction. As shown in Fig. S3A , the U18666A concentration that was used to induce LE/L cholesterol accumulation (2 g/ml) did not affect the endosomal low pH, a key factor for IAV cell entry. Similarly, overexpression of IFITM3 (Fig. S3B) or AnxA6 (Fig. S3C ) had no effect on endosomal acidification, indicating that the observed viral restriction in situations characterized by elevated LE/L cholesterol content is not caused by impaired endosomal acidification. In summary, in NPC1-inhibited A549 cells, through either AnxA6 expression or U18666A treatment, the cholesterol imbalance in the LE/L compartment restricted the first infection cycle of incoming IAV particles, independently of the antiviral properties of IFITM3.
