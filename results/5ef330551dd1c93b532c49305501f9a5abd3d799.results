Parameters of hemogram (WBC total, count of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes) were shown to lack differences between patients with biological and mechanical heart valve prostheses as well as healthy volunteers (Table 2) . While examining T cell arm of immunity it was found that recipients with biological and mechanical heart valve prostheses did not differ in terms of both relative and absolute counts of all examined T cell subsets. At the same time, these parameters were shown to differ when compared with healthy volunteers ( Table 3) . Recipients of both mechanical and biological heart valve prostheses were found to have reduced counts of CD3 + cells compared to healthy volunteers. Patients with biological prostheses had significantly lower relative and absolute amounts of CM Tcyt and naïve Tcyt compared to healthy volunteers; conversely, amount of TEMRA Tcyt and TEMRA Th cells was elevated. Patients with mechanical heart valve prostheses were documented to have increased relative and absolute amount of TEMRA Tcyt compared to healthy volunteers. In addition, relative amount of Th (CD3 + CD4 + ) cells was also found to decline compared to healthy volunteers. In contrast, no significant differences were found in examined parameters of T cell subsets from patients with Mediators of Inflammation 5 biological heart valve prostheses versus healthy volunteers. Moreover, no correlation between hemogram parameters and duration of prosthesis functioning was revealed as well. Representative distribution of T cell subsets among patients with mechanical versus biological heart valve prostheses is shown in Figures 2 and 3 . A discriminant analysis done using a forward stepwise model consisting of 7 steps demonstrated the highest significance level while verifying counts of TEMRA Tcyt relative, CD3 + relative, naïve Th relative, EM Tcyt relative, CD3 + CD8 + relative, naïve Tcyt abs, and TEMRA Th relative ( Table 4) . Partition of the examined groups based on the results of discriminant analysis is depicted in Figure 4 . Only in group of biological prosthesis recipients it was possible to analyze the effect of comorbidities to the changes in T cell subpopulations. There were no significant changes in patients with or without chronic ischemic heart disease, diseases of the urinary system, pulmonary, and thyroid diseases. All significant differences between biological prosthesis recipients with comorbidities (diabetes, hypertonic disease, acute cerebrovascular accident, and GI-tract diseases) are presented in the Tables 5, 6
