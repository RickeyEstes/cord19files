The initial search generated 7,861 relevant articles. After reviewing the abstracts, 106 full-text articles were examined in more detail for eligibility. Of these 106 articles, 38 peer-reviewed articles were found to fit the inclusion criteria. Increased infectious disease transmission and outbreaks following global flood events have been documented ( Table 2 ). The study design and main results of all papers found meeting the inclusion criteria are listed in detail in Appendices A-D. Some articles and gray literature not meeting the specific inclusion criteria were incorporated into the conceptual framework to give a better contextual outline.
