Refer to Fig 1. The initial study population included 19 females and 11 males, aged 18 to 70 years at the Coyah Treatment Unit, Guinea. EBOV was confirmed in all study participants using blood RT-PCR. It is important to note that while IFN β-1a was available as a treatment option, EBOV-infected individuals and/or their designate had the right to refuse IFN β-1a treatment, which 4 did. The IFN β-1a treatment and control groups did not differ in age, sex or day of admission relative to symptom onset (Table 1) . Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine (CRE) and C reactive protein (CRP) levels were consistent features of EVD in all study participants. Of the 9 patients treated with IFN β-1a, 5 started IFN treatment on day 3 post-symptom onset, 1 on day 4 post-symptom onset, one on day 5 post-symptom onset and one on day 6 post-symptom onset. One patient started treatment the next day following admission to the treatment unit based on being a high risk contact who was asymptomatic, but was PCR positive. Given the elevated ALT, AST and CRE levels in all patients with EVD, we were unable to determine whether IFN β-1a treatment negatively affected these biochemical blood measurements. 1 patient (Table 2 , #4) with a PCR negative result received a dose reduction (3 x10 6 IU), related to elevated AST and ALT levels, and had a second 2 consecutive PCR negative result on this reduced dose. Another patient (#5) received a dose reduction (3x10 6 IU) because of rapid resolution of clinical symptoms and a coincident first negative PCR result. This patient also had a consecutive PCR negative result on the reduced IFN β-1a dose. 1 patient had treatment discontinued because of severe clinical symptoms and subsequently died. 2 patients received treatment beyond 10 days, until they became PCR negative ( Table 2 ). 3 of the 9 patients who received IFN β-1a died. Notably, ALT, AST and CRE were significantly elevated in all 3 patients who died, despite one patient (#7) exhibiting reduction in blood viremia from a CT value of 20.1 at start of IFN β-1a treatment, to a CT value of 38 on day 10, when the patient succumbed to disease ( Table 2) . The data in Fig 2 show survival percentages for the control (19% at 21 days) and IFN β-1a treated patients (67% at 21 days, log-rank p = 0.026). The hazards ratio (HR) for the treatment when alone in the model is 0.27, 95%CI:0.08-0.94, p = 0.039 (Wald test). This analysis suggests that the treatment is beneficial to the patients with a HR of 0.27 (those untreated are approximately 3.7-times more likely to die). Age and sex did not affect survival. The HR for the CT values, as continuous, when alone in the model, for the untreated control cohort is 0.8, 95% CI:0.62-0.97, p = 0.0234. These results indicate that CT values have a prognostic effect, with larger values being associated with better survival. For each unit decrease of CT, the risk of death increases 1.25 fold. When the model is adjusted for CT values, the effect of the treatment becomes weaker (HR = 0.79) and for CT slightly stronger (HR = 0.76 for each unit of CT value increase). This analysis suggests that for the same CT values the risk of dying for the untreated is 1.26 fold compared to the IFN treated group, and each unit decrease in CT value will increase the risk of dying by 1.31 fold. For a CT value of 19 (median for CT) the probability of dying for those untreated was 1.35 fold larger than for those treated. Due to the smaller number of deaths in this cohort, it is not possible to adjust the model for more covariates. Given that a recent analysis of baseline CT values supports our findings of their prognostic effect [18] , we extended our analysis for treatment effect on survival as the outcome, using an expanded cohort of untreated and infected patients. We included an additional 17 patients who matched the IFN-treated patients for eligibility criteria based on 6 days from symptom onset, age, and under care in a Guinean treatment centre, who were better matched for baseline CT values. Notably, these patients were never approached to participate in the IFN β-1a treatment trial. Since no data were available to us on serial CT values for these additional patients, we only used vital status (alive or dead) as the outcome. Three logistic regression analyses were performed: (i) An analysis in which all patients were included: 9 IFN-treated and 38 controls. The results suggest that the treatment is significant even when the model is adjusted for CT value. The patients without treatment had an odds ratio of dying 7.54 fold more likely than those treated, when adjusting for the CT value. For a CT value of 20 (median for CT) the probability of dying for those untreated was 1.89 fold larger than for those treated (S1 Table) (ii) An analysis in which patients older than 50 years (which is the maximum age in the IFNtreated group) and with baseline CT values <16 or >31 (the range of values for the IFNtreated group) were excluded. The patients without treatment had an odds ratio of dying 6.39 fold more likely than those treated, when adjusting for the CT value. For a CT value of 20 (median for CT) the probability of dying for those untreated was 1.81 fold larger than for those treated (S2 Table) . (iii) A matched analysis. Each patient from the IFN-treated group was matched to a group of patients in the control group such that the age difference was not larger than 5 years and the CT difference was not larger than 2. For 5 patients suitable matches were found: For IFN 02 one match, for IFN 03 one match, for IFN 04 three matches, for IFN 08 two matches and for IFN 10 three matches. For IFN 05, IFN 06, IFN 07 and IFN 09 no matches were found and they did not enter this analysis. The effect of the treatment based on the conditional logistic regression is significant (OR = 0.17, p = 0.012). The patients without treatment had an odds ratio of dying 6.0 fold more likely than those treated. The probability of dying for those untreated was 1.5 fold larger than for those treated (S3 Table) . Next, the rate of viral clearance from blood was evaluated, using the original 21 control cohort, for whom we had serial data (Fig 3) . To remove bias associated with CT values from patients who succumbed to disease, i.e. did not clear virus, this analysis was performed only on patients who were alive at the end of the study, i.e. cleared virus. We observe a trend of faster clearance in the IFN β-1a treated patients compared with the controls (Fig 3, inset) . The CT values increase by 1.53 units/day in the controls and by 1.62 units/day for the IFN treated patients. The difference (0.19) is not statistically significant (p = 0.36). Patient symptoms were recorded in the morning, afternoon and evening over time for all study participants. Refer to Table 3 . Frequency and number of clinical symptoms are described in S4 Table. Overall, the data in Table 3 indicate that IFN β-1a treatment led to earlier resolution of many clinical symptoms, including those associated with the gastrointestinal dysfunction of EVD, namely abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea. In the context of fever, temperature values fluctuated between 34˚and 40.5˚among all study participants (data not shown). Fever did not decrease differently between the two groups, with the interaction p-value s = 0.069, 0.63, 0.82, for the morning, afternoon and evening, respectively. Overall, in both groups fever seemed to decrease by a small amount in the afternoon (0.07˚C, p<0.001). No statistically significant decrease was observed in the two groups for the temperatures taken in the morning or evening (p = 0.069 and p = 0.93, respectively). Pulse taken in the afternoon decreased by 0.6 per day in the control cohort (p = 0.19) and increased by 1.1 per day in the IFN β-1a treated group (p = 0.0042). The difference between these rates (interaction term) was statistically significant (p = 0.0053). The rate of change for the morning or evening pulse did not change significantly between the two groups over time (p = 0.33 and 0.19, respectively). Similarly, the rate of change for systolic blood pressure was not different between groups (p = 0.37 for morning, p = 0.92 for afternoon and p = 0.49 for the evening measure).
