The average age of the patients presenting predominately with frequency was 4 7 years, in patients presenting with urge incontinence it was 47 years and in patients presenting with stress incontinence it was 51 years. The differences were not significant (p >0.1). Student's t distribution test was used for statistical evaluation in this study. Normal and hyperreflexic profiles were found in equal percentages in the frequency and stress incontinence groups but a hype:rreflexic profile was more predominate in the urge incontinence group (table 2 and fig. 1 ). Postural changes did not affect the cystometric curves of bladder function that were hyperreflexic, flaccid or secondary to bladder wall changes (fibrosis or inflammation). Postural changes did affect normal curves in some patients with a history of micturition disorders and resulted in detrusor instability with the patients in the standing or walking positions ( fig. 2 ). 1 The urethral pressure profile measurements are noted in table 3 with the statistical difference between the stress inconand the other 2 groups.
