LY6E enhances a subset of enveloped RNA viruses. In screens to identify ISGs that modulate viral infection, we previously showed that ectopic expression of human LY6E by lentiviral transduction enhanced the infectivity of multiple, genetically diverse viruses. These include members of the Flaviviridae (yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), and West Nile virus (WNV)), Togaviridae (Chikungunya virus, O'nyong nyong virus (ONNV)), Retroviridae (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1)) and Orthomyxoviridae (influenza A virus (IAV), strain PR8) families 1, 2, 5 . Here, we confirmed that in immortalized human STAT1 -/fibroblasts, lentiviral-mediated LY6E expression enhanced the infectivity of the fluorescent reporter virus YFV-17D-Venus after 24 h, or approximately one replication cycle (Fig. 1a) . We used STAT1 -/fibroblasts as these cells are unable to respond to IFN, thus allowing us to study LY6E independent of other IFN-inducible ISGs. To determine whether LY6E has effects beyond the first viral replication cycle, we infected LY6Eexpressing cells with a low dose of YFV-17D-Venus and quantified the percentage of infected cells over time by flow cytometry. At every time point, we observed enhanced infection in LY6E cells as compared to control cells expressing either firefly luciferase (fluc) or empty vector control (Fig. 1b, c) . The most striking difference in infection was a 300% increase observed at 36 h post-infection, after the onset of viral spread. At this time point, we observed an increase in the percentage of infected cells expressing low levels of Venus, as reflected by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the fluorescent reporter. Since newly infected cells express lower levels of viral antigens and virally encoded Venus, our data suggest that these cells were recently infected with virus that was at an early stage of replication. To more precisely determine the effect of ectopic LY6E expression on virus production, we quantified the amount of a non-reporter virus (YFV-17D) secreted into cell supernatants over time by plaque assay (Fig. 1d) . We consistently found that compared to empty vector control cells, cells ectopically expressing LY6E produced at least twice as much virus. Together, these time course studies indicate that LY6E enhances infection within the first viral replication cycle, which correlates with more rapid viral spread and overall increased virus production. We further examined the effect of LY6E expression on viruses representing diverse families. In corroboration with our screen, LY6E enhanced DENV and ONNV infection 1, 5 . LY6E also increased infectivity of a non-reporter A/WSN/33 strain of IAV, the PRVABC59 strain of Zika virus, and a GFP reporter vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, Fig. 1e ). We further validated our previous screening data, suggesting that ectopic LY6E expression does not universally enhance infectivity of enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses, as Sindbis virus (SINV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), and measles virus (MV) were not affected 2 . Additionally, we observed no enhancement of a replication-defective adenovirus serotype 5 vector (AdV5), which is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus (Fig. 1f) . These results demonstrate that LY6E enhances infection of a subset of enveloped RNA viruses from diverse viral families.
