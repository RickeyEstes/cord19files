Nasally administered L. rhamnosus CRL1505 and L. rhamnosus CRL1506 differentially modulate respiratory immunity In order to evaluate the changes induced by nasally administered LAB in the respiratory immune system we determined the levels of different cytokines in BAL ( Figure 1A ). The four nasal treatments used in this study Lr05, HkLr05, Lr06 and HkLr06 increased the levels of IL-6, IFN-α and IFN-β in BAL, however concentrations of these cytokines were significantly higher in Lr06-and HkLr06-treated mice than in mice receiving Lr05 or HkLr05 ( Figure 1A ). All the treatments were also able to increase BAL IFN-γ, being both viable and heat-killed L. rhamnosus CRL1505 more efficient to improve the levels of this cytokine than L. rhamnosus CRL1506 ( Figure 1A ). BAL TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations were increased by the immunobiotic nasal treatments. We observed that viable cells were more efficient to upregulate TNF-α than heat-killed strains while no differences were found in IL-10 levels when comparing viable and heat-killed lactobacilli ( Figure 1A ). When we evaluated the levels of IL-6, IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-10 in serum we found that lactobacilli treatments induced similar changes than those observed in the respiratory tract ( Figure 1B ). IL-6, IFN-α and IFN-β were more efficiently increased with L. rhamnosus CRL1506 treatments while the highest levels of serum IFN-γ were observed in Lr05 and HkLr05 groups ( Figure 1B ). Serum TNF-α and IL-10 concentrations were also enhanced by the immunobiotic nasal treatments, being viable and heat-killed lactobacilli equally effective to improve both cytokines whit the exception of HkLr06 that induced significantly lower levels of IL-10 when compared with the other treatments ( Figure 1B) . We also evaluated the changes induced by nasally administered lactobacilli in lung immune cells using flow cytometry. Slightly increases of lung CD3 + CD4 + T cells were observed in lactobacilli-treated mice, however when we studied the cells able to produce IFN-γ within this population, mice receiving Lr05, HkLr05 and Lr06 showed significant differences when compared to control mice ( Figure 2 ). Nasally administered Lr05 and HkLr05 A B Figure 1 Effect of lactobacilli on systemic and respiratory immunity. Effect of viable (Lr05) or heat-killed (HkLr05) Lactobacillus rhamnosus CRL1505 and viable (Lr06) or heat-killed (HkLr06) L. rhamnosus CRL1506 nasal administration on the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-10 concentrations in broncho-alveolar lavages (A) and serum (B). Lr05, Lr06, HkLr05 or HkLr06 were nasally administered to different groups of mice for 2 consecutive days at a dose of 10 8 cells/mouse/day and the levels of BAL and serum cytokines were studied on day 3. The results represent data from three independent experiments. Different letters indicate significant differences (P < 0.05). increased the number of CD3 + CD4 + IFN-γ + T cells in lungs being Lr05 more efficient than HkLr05 to increase this cell population ( Figure 2 ). Only Lr05 enhanced the number of CD3 + CD4 + IL-10 + T cells in lungs ( Figure 2 ). No modifications were observed in the number of CD3 + CD8 + and CD3 + CD8 + IFN-γ + T cells in lactobacilli-treated mice ( Figure 2 ). Two populations of myeloid DCs can be defined in lungs using CD11c, CD11b, CD103 and MHC-II antibodies as described previously [12, 19] : MHC-II + CD11c + CD11b low CD103 + and MHC-II + CD11c + CD11b high CD103cells. Therefore, we next aimed to evaluate the effect of nasally administered lactobacilli on these populations of DCs from lungs. Lr05 and HkLr05 significantly increased the number of both lung CD11c + CD11b low CD103 + and CD11c + CD11b high CD103 -DCs. In addition, Lr06 and HkLr06 enhanced the number of lung CD11c + CD11b low CD103 + DCs while no quantitative changes were detected in CD11c + CD11b high CD103 -DCs populations in lungs of Lr06-and HkLr06-treated mice ( Figure 2 ). In addition, the expression of MHC-II in both DCs population was significantly improved with all the treatments, however L. rhamnosus CRL1505 was more efficient than L. rhamnosus CRL1506 to upregulate the expression of MHC-II in lung DCs ( Figure 2 ).
