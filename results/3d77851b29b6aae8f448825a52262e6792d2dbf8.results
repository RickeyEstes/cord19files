Serum ACE2 levels were measured in blood samples collected on preoperative day 3, preoperative day 1, postoperative day 1 and postoperative day 3. As shown in Fig. 1 , the serum ACE2 level in NSCLC patients was at baseline level preoperatively, peaked 24 hours after major pulmonary resection, and returned to baseline level three days after the surgery. We divided the serum ACE2 levels on postoperative day 1 into quartile categories: 3.21, 3.22-3.86, 3.87-4.42, and !4.43 ng/ mL. As shown in Table 1 , there were no significant differences among the quartile categories in age, sex, body mass index (BMI), current smoking status, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and prevalence of coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There were also no significant differences among the quartile categories in distribution of NSCLC histology and clinical stages ( Table 2) . As shown in Table 3 , postoperative morbidities increased with descending quartiles of serum ACE2 levels, and the risk was significantly higher in the first quartile than in the second, third, and fourth quartiles (Model 1). After adjustment for age, sex, BMI, current smoking status, FEV1, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, COPD, and tumour clinical stages (model 2), the risk of developing postoperative morbidities was significantly higher in the lowest serum ACE2 level quartile than in the highest quartile (hazard ration, 2.12; 95% CI, 1.57-6.23; p = 0.008). We then examined the association between the lowest serum ACE2 level quartile ( 3.21 ng/mL) and the incidence Figure 1 Preoperative and postoperative serum angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) levels in non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing major pulmonary resection. of typical morbidities after major pulmonary resection, including pneumonia, prolonged air leak, pleural effusion, and atrial fibrillation. In the analyses, we combined the second, third, and fourth quartiles of serum ACE2 levels into one category (>3.21 ng/mL; n = 240) to compare with the first serum ACE2 level quartile ( 3.21 ng/mL; n = 80). As shown in Table 4 , NSCLC patients with a serum ACE2 level 3.21ng/mL had significantly higher rates of pneumonia, pleural effusion, atrial ACE2 and postoperative morbidity fibrillation as well as higher in-hospital mortality after major pulmonary resection, compared with those with a serum ACE2 level >3.21ng/mL. Further analyses by the method of pulmonary resection revealed that the serum ACE2 level did not have a significant effect on the rates of postoperative morbidities and in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing pneumonectomy (n = 35) ( Table 5) . However, in patients undergoing lobectomy/bilobectomy (n = 285), those with a serum ACE2 level 3.21ng/mL had significantly higher rates of pleural effusion and atrial fibrillation than those with a serum ACE2 level >3.21ng/mL (Table 6 ). According to the data in Tables 5 and 6 , patients undergoing pneumonectomy had higher rates of postoperative morbidities and in-hospital mortality than those undergoing lobectomy/bilobectomy.
