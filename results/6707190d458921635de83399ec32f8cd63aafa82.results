Positive LAMP reactions were turbid while the negative control samples were clear when examined at room temperature under ambient light (Figure 1 ). Direct visual inspection after addition of SYBR green 1 showed that positive reactions turned green while the negative control remained orange. Under UV illumination, positive reactions turned bright green while negative reactions remained dull orange (Figure 2 ). Agarose gel electrophoresis of positive samples showed a ladder of multiple bands while no bands were detected in the negative control. It was observed that the LAMP assay amplified DNA in all E. histolytica DNA dilutions used. It was also determined that there was no difference in the intensity of the bands with regard to the E. histolytica DNA concentration in the mixture (Figure 3 ). Using DNA extracted from serially-diluted pure cultures of E. histolytica cells as well the corresponding dilution series spiked with feces, the sensitivity of the assay was found to be 5 parasites per reaction which corresponds to approximately 15.8 ng/ 毺 L DNA. Thus, the sensitivity of the LAMP was lower compared to that of conventional nested PCR which was determined by the current study to detect to as low as 2 ng/ 毺 L DNA sample (data not shown) The specificity of the assay was verified by the absence of amplified products when DNA from other gastrointestinal parasites such as the morphologically similar but nonpathogenic species, E. dispar, and other diarrhea-causing organisms such as Blastocystis hominis and Escherichia coli were used (Figure 4) . histolytica. Lane M, marker; lanes Eh, Ed, Bh, and Ec, correspond to lamp reactions using DNA from E. histolytica, E. dispar, Blastocystis hominis and Escherichia coli, respectively. NC, negative control. No amplified products were detected when DNA from other diarrhea-causing microorganisms were used such as E. dispar, Blastocystis hominis and Escherichia coli were used, thus ensuring the specificity of the assay.
