Average litter sizes were determined from 60 to 100 litters of both the parental and F1 strains and the average weight for each type and sex of mouse at 6 and 11 weeks of age was determined from approximately 100 mice in each group. Table I shows a summary of these findings. Statistical analysis showed that both types of cross were significantly heavier than the BALB/c parent (P < 0.0001) and that the BALB/c x MF1 (MF1/× ) cross are significantly heavier than the BALB/c × Swiss-Webster (SWR/× ) cross (P < 0.0001). The volume of ascitic fluid harvested from individual mice was compared, firstly to the volumes taken from other members of the same group, Average weight and standard deviation of mice at stated ages. b Litter sizes determined from between 60 to 100 litters for each mouse type. c Significant difference between the weights of the BALB/c parent and both crosses of the same age and sex (P < 0.0001). d Significant difference between the weight of the MF1/x and SWR/x mice of the same age and sex (P < 0.0001). secondly to mice of the same sex in the other groups (where possible) and thirdly to the mean volume taken from the BALB/c male mice. This determined any factors affecting the production of fluid such as the hybridoma cell type, the mouse type or the sex of the mouse used. It has been observed (Brodeur et al., 1984 ) that male mice produce more fluid than the females. In this study we could find no correlation between sex and yield of fluid from the cross-bred strains (results not shown). After clarification by centrifugation the volume of fluid recovered represented approximately 80% of the original volume for all cell types and mouse strains. The remaining 20% comprised blood cells and other cellular debris.
