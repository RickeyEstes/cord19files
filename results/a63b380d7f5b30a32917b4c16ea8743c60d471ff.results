The results of this study are presented in two parts. First we discuss the core themes and action recommendations that emerged from our analyses. They provide an understanding of the complexity of disaster management and highlight the hard and soft system aspects of that complexity, as well as potential intervention strategies. Second we show a formalized model which maps the complexity from the themes with existing literature, and highlights the relationships between the components of critical social infrastructure ( Fig. 1) . This model depicts a framework for critical social infrastructure which can be used to protect high risk populations in the context of disaster management, but has broader applications for identifying levers which can be targeted for interventions to promote community resilience and population health. What became clear during our analyses was the interconnectedness of the various components of the hard and soft systems in a community, and how culture provides the backdrop for the social fabric for both. The four core themes (dynamic context, awareness and connectedness, adaptive response and collaboration) underscore this interconnectivity and represent the structure for the framework, as shown by the darker line around these components in the model (Fig. 1) . From the action recommendations we identified micro level inputs that support core components in the model and represent levers for action to managing the dynamic complexity.
