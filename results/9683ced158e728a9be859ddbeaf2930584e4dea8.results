Serological reactivity with homologous filovirus antigen is not influenced by age or sex. A total of 124 ERBs were used in this study that was performed over a two-year time span. The total number of bats dedicated to this study, as well as the size and composition of each group was dependent on the reproductive capacity of the ERB breeding colony, as well as the characteristics and number of bats needed for other experimental studies. The 124 bats were divided into seven groups, with group sizes ranging from 15-20 individuals (Table 1) . Two groups of bats had approximately equal sex ratios (Ravn and Taï Forest), while two groups were comprised of mostly female individuals (Bundibugyo and Sudan), and the remaining five groups were comprised of all male (Reston) or all female (Marburg and Ebola) individuals. Two groups of bats were comprised solely of individuals <1 yr of age (Bundibugyo and Taï Forest), while the majority of individuals in three groups were ≥1-≤5 yrs of age (Marburg, Ebola and Reston) and the majority of individuals in two groups were >5 yrs of age (Ravn and Sudan). Despite the observed variability in group composition, a two-way ANOVA revealed that serological reactivity with homologous filovirus antigen was not significantly (p > 0.05) influenced by sex (F(1,118) = 1.293), age (F(2,118) = 0.837), or the interaction between sex and age (F(2,118) = 0.715). Filovirus-specific indirect ELISAs are highly sensitive and specific. With the exception of the IgG antibody indirect ELISA using Marburg virus antigen (90% sensitivity and 100% specificity; Fig. 1a and Table 4 ), all of the assays exhibited 100% sensitivity and specificity ( Fig. 1 and Table 4 ). The mean group adjusted sum OD values ranged from 3.43 (±1.77 SD) for the IgG antibody indirect ELISA using Marburg virus antigen to 5.69 (±2.06 SD) for the IgG antibody indirect ELISA using Ebola virus antigen. Strong positive correlation between filovirus serological cross-reactivity and filovirus protein amino acid identity. Figure 2 and Table 5 show the level of serological cross-reactivity between each group of bat filovirus-specific antisera and the six heterologous filovirus antigens. The consistent magnitudes of serological reactivity of the individual bat antisera across all six heterologous filovirus antigens highlights the robust performance of our filovirus IgG indirect ELISA system. Strong serological cross-reactivity was observed between Marburg virus antisera and Ravn virus antigen (95%), and Ravn virus antisera and Marburg virus antigen (95%) (Fig. 2a,b) . (Fig. 2e-g) . Very limited cross-reactivity was observed between marburgvirus antisera and ebolavirus antigen (0%: majority of antisera-antigen combinations; 5%: Marburg virus antisera versus Taï Forest virus antigen, Ravn virus antisera versus Bundibugyo and Taï Forest virus antigens; 15%: Ravn virus antisera versus Reston virus antigen), and ebolavirus antisera tested against marburgvirus antigen (5.3%: Sudan virus antisera versus Marburg virus antigen; 10.3% Sudan virus antisera versus Ravn virus antigen) (Fig. 2) . A Pearson's Product-Moment Correlation revealed that there was a statistically significant, strong positive correlation between percent filovirus serological cross-reactivity and percent filovirus amino acid identity (r = 0.922, n = 42, p < 0.01).
