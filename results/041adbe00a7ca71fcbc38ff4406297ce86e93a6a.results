One hundred seventy-three (0.16%) duplicities were identified and excluded. Taking into consideration the registrations kept, 105,054 suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by influenza have been notified. Out of this total, 95,485 (90.9%) were notified in the year of 2009, and 9,569 (9.1%) were notified in 2010. For the final classification, 53,797 (51.2%) of the notified cases were classified as influenza by the new viral subtype, 40,926 (39.0%) were discarded, 3,297 (3.1%) were caused by another infectious agent and 7,034 (6.70) were not categorized. The distribution frequency by epidemiological week can be observed in Graphic 1. Among the confirmed cases, 65.8% were classified by a clinicalepidemiological criterion and 34.2% by the laboratory criterion. The diagnosis method recommended by the WHO for laboratory confirmation was the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 1,6 . The cumulative incidence of influenza in the year 2009 was 28.0/100,000 inhabitants and, in 2010, 0.5/100,000 inhabitants. In the incidence distribution per age group, the group of people younger than one year had a greater incidence (84.2), followed by the 1-4 years group (40.6) and the 20-29 years group (38.5) in 2009. The age groups with the lowest incidence were the 60-69 years group (13.7), the 70-79 years group (12.4) and the group > 80 years old (11.4) . Regarding the epidemiological characteristics, 56.7% were female among the confirmed cases. The average age in the confirmed cases was 26.3 (SD + 18.1) years old and the median age was 24 (range: 0-98) years old. It was possible to observe in Table 1 the distribution, according to the age group, of the number of cases classified as pandemic influenza, the proportion and incidence per 100,000 inhabitants, in the year 2009. According to the ethnic group/skin color, 38,111 (79.2%) of the confirmed cases were white. Regarding the educational level, 9,748 (21.0%) confirmed cases had this information ignored. Among the cases that had this category filled, the most frequent educational level category was high school graduate (21.8%). Regarding the area of residence, 93.8% of the confirmed cases lived in urban or peri-urban areas. Considering the epidemiological antecedents, the proportion among the confirmed cases of people who were vaccinated against flu was 9.7% (n = 4,356). A lower proportion was found when the use of antipneumococcal vaccines was evaluated, 2.1% received the vaccine and 97.9% did not. Fever was the most frequent sign, registered in 99.7% of the cases. Cough (99.6%) and dyspnea (95.1%) were the other most frequent symptoms reported by the confirmed cases. The presence of comorbidities was notified in 32.5% of the cases. The most frequent comorbidities were: chronic pneumopathy (26.35%), smoking (23.96%) and chronic cardiopathy (13.09%). On the progression evaluation, 46.4% of the confirmed cases involved hospitalizations. The collection of 51,837 biological samples was performed from the notified cases, whereas 19,979 (35.5%) were from the cases classified as confirmed. Among these cases, 19,068 (95.4%) nasopharingeal secretion samples were collected as well as 911 (4.6%) bronchoalveolar lavage samples (n = 67), feces (n = 1), post-mortem tissues (n = 138), serum samples (n = 123) and other non-specified samples (n = 582). Among the 26,390 samples from the notified cases processed by RT-PCR, the results were positive for influenza by the new viral subtype (pandemic) in 18,603 (70.5%) samples. Among the cases classified as confirmed, 99.50% were classified as influenza by the new viral subtype, 0.24% by the seasonal influenza A, 0.02% by the seasonal influenza B, 0.05% by the avian influenza and 0.19% had other infectious agents. However, among the cases classified as discarded, 3.93% were classified as influenza by the new viral subtype, 17.66% by the seasonal influenza A, 0.55% by the seasonal influenza B, 0.06% by the avian influenza and 77.79% had other infectious agents. A laboratory diagnosis was performed by culture in 676 samples. Among these, 283 were from cases classified as confirmed: 223 (78.8%) were positive and 60 (21.2%) were negative. In the 393 cultures performed in the cases classified as discarded, 15 (3.8%) were positive and 378 (96.2%) were negative. Three hundred and seventy-eight samples were processed by both, RT-PCR and culture. Out of the 142 positive cultures, 132 (92.96%) were also positive by RT-PCR, eight (5.63%) were negative and two (1.41%) were inconclusive. Out of the 236 negative cultures, 30 (12.71%) were positive by RT-PCR, 205 (86.86%) were negative both in culture and RT-PCR, and one sample (0.42%) of a negative culture was inconclusive by RT-PCR. Thoracic X-ray exams showed, more frequently, an interstitial infiltrate in 57.4% of the confirmed cases, followed by results considered normal in 23.3%. The solidification of the lung tissue that refers to nonspecific air-space opacification (pulmonary consolidation), was presented in 3,968 (9.9%) of the notified cases, whereas 1,533 were confirmed. In the case progression analysis 47,643 (93.8%) of the confirmed cases of influenza caused by the new viral subtype evolved to cure. The case-fatality rate was 3.9% (2,056/ 52,827) in 2009 and 12.4% (120/ 970) in 2010.
