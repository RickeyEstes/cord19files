3.1. Sera against mass-and 4/91-type IBV could not completely neutralize isolate CK/CH/2010/JT-1 The last dilution of each serum against H120 and 4/91, which protected 50% of the embryos against 10 2 EID 50 s of strains M41 and CK/CH/2014/TM98, was tested at 1:9.85 and 1:25.46, respectively. However, serum against H120 could not neutralize 10 2 EID 50 s of CK/CH/2010/JT-1, while the end-point of serum against 4/91 that could neutralize 10 2 EID 50 s of CK/CH/2010/JT-1 was only 1:2.14. These results indicate that the CK/CH/2010/JT-1 isolate was antigenically distinct from the IBV Mass and 4/91 serotypes.
