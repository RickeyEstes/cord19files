Effects of probe length and probe melting temperature on the robustness of base calls Using a prototype 5K SNP chip, the performance of static probe lengths was compared to the performance of variable length, isothermal probes on base calling robustness. A base call is considered robust when a probe quartet has a single high nucleotide signal relative to the other three nucleotide signals, and the sense and antisense base calls are complementary. A D score calculating the background noise relative to the highest signal intensity in a probe quartet ( Figure 1 , grey inset) was used to compare the performance of static probes and isothermal probes. A D score close to 1 indicates high background noise and poor discrimination ability Figure 1 Microarray layout and design. The microarray contains blocks of probesets for SNP genotyping and CGH. SNP genotyping probesets are composed of two probe quartets, one for each strand (red blowouts). Probes from one quartet typically have hybridization signals in a similar dynamic range. These signals are used to determine a base call and calculate base calling robustness, which is expressed as a D score where the two lesser hybridization signals are used to estimate background noise for each probe quartet (grey inset). The CGH probesets record data that are used to generate log 2 ratios of a test and reference sample. between probe signals, while a score close to 0 indicates low background noise and good discrimination ability. The mean D score of the 5K SNP chips was plotted for static probe lengths ( Figure 2a ) and for probe melting temperature (Figure 2b ). Statistical analysis with a oneway ANOVA indicates significant differences between mean D score at various probe lengths (P < 0.0001), and a Tukey's multiple comparison test indicates that all probe lengths except 39-and 41-mers have a significantly different mean D score (P < 0.05). Out of the nine tested probe lengths, 39-mer probes generated the lowest mean D score with the best discrimination ability (x = 0.3575). A one-way ANOVA analysis indicates probe melting temperature D score are significantly different from one another (P < 0.0001), and a Tukey's multiple comparison test indicates melting temperature in the 66°C range was significantly different from other melting temperatures (P < 0.05). The lowest mean D score with the best discrimination ability for probe melting temperatures was generated at 66°C from the range of 42 to 82°C (x= 0.2647), and this outperformed any static probe lengths. Similar performance was seen when comparing exons, introns, and intergenic regions ( Figure S1 in Additional file 1).
