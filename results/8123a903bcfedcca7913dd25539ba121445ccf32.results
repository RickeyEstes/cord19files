The DOCH course has been successfully run since 1999, with the fırst class graduating in 2003. In terms of subjective student satisfaction, the evaluation of lectures and tutorials are equivalent to those of other courses taught in the medical school. Clinically related sessions, such as visits with nonmedical health professionals to people re-ceiving care in their home, are very popular. On the other hand, similar sessions on public health where students visit a school and assess the health of a population of school children are slightly lower (Table 3) . Overall, lectures delivered by patients or members of the community (e.g., a drug addict presenting on the heroin replacement program) had the highest ratings, followed by community visits. The sessions with the lowest rankings are those in the second year when students are expected to do a fair amount of individual work. In terms of the rankings of all courses, the fırst and fourth years were the most popular, followed by the third year and then the second year. In terms of the objective data from the PHELO/PH/ PMCH scores on the MCCQE1 exam, Figure 1 gives the ranking of the U of T compared to the average of the other medical schools in Canada. In the 1993-1995 period (didactic teaching in the second year of the medical school) the U of T had a relatively poor ranking. At this time, the average scores for U of T graduates were lower than the overall average of graduates from Canadian medical schools. With the advent in 1996 of Health, Illness, and the Community, and Determinants of Health (4 years after the course started in 1992), the ranking of U of T relative to the other schools improved to 2nd place. However, the ranking slowly fell over time and approached the Canadian average. After the change to DOCH, the students graduated in 2003 and the ranking of the U of T program improved to number 1, indicating that students were doing substantially better. Unlike the previous period, this better ranking was sustained over time
