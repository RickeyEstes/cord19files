Forty-four volunteers participated in the drill conducted on January 19, 2005, as mock patients. Thirty (68%) of the 44 volunteer patients were scripted to have a chief complaint of fever and cough. The chief complaint recorded by the triage nurse indicated fever and cough for 29 (97%) of these 30 patients, whereas the electronic chief complaint entered into the hospital registration system by registration clerks indicated fever and cough for 24 (80%) of the 30. The drill patients had a scripted epidemiological link to a recent skiing trip in Canada. Nonfever and noncough scripted chief complaints included chest pain, asthma, and minor trauma. Records from 42 patients (95%) were successfully transmitted to the NYC-DOHMH; 2 drill patients were not entered into the electronic registration system. The 30 patients with fever and respiratory symptoms did not generate a statistically significant signal in the purely spatial scan statistic analysis at the NYC-DOHMH. The age range of patients transmitted to the NYC-DOHMH was 10 to 80 years, with a median age of 17 years (interquartile range, 14-40 years). The 42 drill patients were classified in 8 categories by NYC-DOHMH based on the chief complaints that were entered into the registration system by hospital staff: sepsis (2), cold (3), respiratory (20), diarrhea (2), fever/flu (4), vomiting (3), and other (8) . These categories are hierarchical in the order listed, so that a patient whose chief complaint was "cold, runny nose, cough, and fever" would be classified in the cold syndrome category, not the respiratory or fever syndrome category. Patients are further subdivided into age groupings. The main daily analysis of the NYC-DOHMH examines trends in respiratory and fever syndromes among patients aged 13 years and older and diarrhea and vomiting syndromes in patients of all ages. Using these parameters, 19 (63%) of the 30 patients who complained of fever and cough were included in the respiratory syndrome cluster analysis, and 4 (13%) were included in the fever syndrome cluster analysis. The most likely cluster identified by a hospital-based spatial scan statistic analysis detected an increase in respiratory visits of patients aged 13 years and older at 9 Brooklyn hospitals, including the 3 drill hospitals and 6 others. One hundred twenty-eight visits were observed compared with 94 expected, with the largest number of excess cases occurring at Kings County (31 observed âˆ’ 17 expected = 14 excess visits, of which, 9 were drill patients). However, with a P value of .037, this cluster did not meet the NYC-DOHMH threshold for investigation (P b .01). Similarly, analysis by patient's home zip code detected a borderline cluster in the zip code in which all 3 hospitals are located. The number of respiratory visits, although elevated on the day of the drill in the area of the 3 hospitals, did not appear particularly unusual when compared with the 14-day baseline period used by NYC-DOHMH spatial analyses (Fig. 1 ).
