laMC2 is upregulated in the cancer tissues and serum of PsCC patients LAMC2 expression was significantly upregulated at the mRNA level (29/30, Figure 1A ) and protein level (14/15, Figure 1B ) in the PSCC tissues compared to that in paired normal epithelial tissues. Moreover, LAMC2 expression was higher in LN metastatic lesions than in primary cancer tissues ( Figure 1C ). There was more cytoplasmic accumulation of LAMC2 in PSCC tissues than normal tissues, and the ratio of local PSCC tissues expressing high level of LAMC2 is higher in patients with LN metastasis (LNMP) than in LN metastasis-free patients (MFP) ( Figure 1D ). The concentration of sLAMC2 was markedly higher in PSCC patients with LN metastasis than those in MFP and healthy age-matched volunteers, while no differences were found between the two latter groups ( Figure 1E ). Moreover, the sLAMC2 level likely gradually increased with more advanced N stage ( Figure 1E ). These data suggest that overexpression of LAMC2 is mainly related to LN metastasis in PSCC. laMC2 promotes migration, invasion, and ln metastasis of PsCC cells Further investigation revealed that LAMC2 overexpression significantly increased the migration and invasion of 149RCa cells (Figure 2A , B), whereas LAMC2 silencing significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of Penl1 and Penl2 cells (Figure 2A , C). Moreover, LAMC2 knockdown significantly reduced the ability of Penl2 cells to metastasize to inguinal LN ( Figure 2D ). However, overexpression and knockdown of LAMC2 did not obviously affect the proliferation of PSCC cells ( Figure S2 ). Taken together, these results indicate that LAMC2 may play important roles in promoting PSCC cell migration, invasion, and LN metastasis.
