To test the performances and functionality of CROSS combined with DTW (Supplementary Figures 1, 2) , we selected a dataset of 22 structures for which crystallographic (exact base pairing between nucleotides) and Selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE; chemical probing of flexible regions used to assess whether a nucleotide is in doubleor single-stranded state) data are available (Lorenz et al., 2016) . Using DTW, we calculated the distances between all possible pairs in the dataset considering crystallographic (dots and parentheses were transformed into binary code) data as well as (1) SHAPE profiles (Area Under the ROC Curve AUC of 0.76, Positive Predictive Value PPV of 0.76 when compared to crystallographic data) and (2) CROSS profiles (AUC 0.72 and PPV 0.74 when compared to crystallographic data, see http://service.tartaglialab.com/static_files/algorithms/cross/ documentation.html#5). Crystallographic data show higher correlations with CROSS profiles (Pearson's correlation of 0.91) than SHAPE profiles (Figures 1A,B , correlation of 0.50). In this analysis, CROSS shows better performances than algorithms such as RNAstructure (Mathews et al., 1999; Reuter and Mathews, 2010) and RNAfold (Lorenz et al., 2016) (respective correlations 0.71 and 0.47 with crystals; Supplementary Figures 3, 4) . Sequence similarity analysis (computed with EMBOSS; Material and Methods) shows comparable correlations with distances calculated with either CROSS or crystallographic profiles (respectively: 0.80, 0.83, 0.38 with crystallographic, CROSS and SHAPE data). While CROSS and crystallographic profiles identify specific clusters of RNA molecules with low sequence identity and high structural similarity (colored in red, orange and green according to difference confidence thresholds; Figures 1C-E) , SHAPE data cannot be used to recognize these structures. To further test the usefulness of CROSSalign, we compared its output with that of CMfinder (Yao et al., 2006) . CMfinder is a method to compute multiple sequence alignments that exploits structural motifs for ranking (section Materials and Methods, Comparisons with CMfinder). We analyzed the largest multiple sequence alignments reported in the CMfinder test set (cobalamin, intron gp II, s box, lysine and histone 3) and used the minimal CROSSalign distance to assign the closest match to each transcript. This step is needed for the analysis, since CROSSalign performs pairwise comparisons, while CMfinder does multiple alignments. Selecting equal-size groups (lowest and highest CMfinder scores), we measured CROSSalign performances on CMfinder rankings, achieving an AUC of 0.80 (Supplementary Figure 5A) . We note that CROSSalign has particularly strong performances on the largest dataset: cobalamin (71 sequences of 216 nt; AUC of 0.95; Supplementary Figure 5B ).
