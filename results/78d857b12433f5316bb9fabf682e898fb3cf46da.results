By blocking ELISA 15 13 out of 5052 sera tested (29.9%) were seropositive. A total of 442 herds out of 803 sampled (55.9%) had PEDV seropositive sows (Table 1) . Comparing the prevalence of PEDV seropositivity across the different farm size categories, we found similar figures in large and medium size farms (65.1 and 67.8% positive herds, respectively). However, the prevalence of positive small farms (38.1%) was significantly lower (x2 = 16.8 and 13.5, respectively, P < 0.001 ) ( Table 1) . We found a highly significant negative correlation between farm size and within-farm seropositivity using the Pearson product moment correlation test ( r,r = -0.12, P < 0.001 ), meaning that the number of positive samples per farm decreased significantly with increased size of the herd. Since positive sera were not titrated, the blocking percentage was taken as a quantitative measure of the positivity of a particular sample. As shown in Table 1 , mean blocking percentage of positive sera also tended to decrease while increasing the farm size. The A herd was considered positive when at least one of the sampled sows reached a blocking percentage > 50% in the blocking-ELISA. Blocking percentage was determined for each positive farm as the mean of the blocking percentage of each of the positive sera. Within-farm seropositivity was calculated as the ratio between the number of positive sera and the total number of sampled animals in this farm. A herd was considered positive when at least one of the sampled sows reached a blocking percentage 250% in the blocking-ELISA. Blocking percentage was determined for each positive farm as the mean of the blocking percentage of each of the positive sera. Within-farm seropositivity was calculated as the ratio between the number of positive sera and the total number of sampled animals in this farm. differences between small and medium size farms did not reach statistical significance, but the mean blocking percentage in large farms was significantly lower than in medium size (F= 8.56, P=O.O03) and small farms (F=6.84, P=O.O09). Comparing the prevalence of PEDV seropositivity between extensive and intensive farms in the province of Salamanca, the only where this type of production exists, we found significant differences ( 19.5% and 32% of positive herds, respectively) but no differences were found in either the mean blocking percentage or in within-herd seropositivity data between both types of production (Table 2) .
