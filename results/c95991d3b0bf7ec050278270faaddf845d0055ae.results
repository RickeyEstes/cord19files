Comparison of the 1134 base nucleocapsid genes of HCoV-NL63 strain Amsterdam1, the first non-HCoV-229E group I human coronavirus characterized, and HCoV-NL63 strain New Haven 191 revealed as many as 10 polymorphisms. Of these, 5 resulted in amino acid substitutions (data not shown). Because the full length nucleocapsid gene of HCoV-NL63 could not be expressed efficiently (data not shown), we constructed clones which contained only portions of the nucleocapsid gene (Fig. 1A) . Overall, amino acids 59-377, 59-271 and 234-377 of HCoV-NL63 and amino acids 229-389 of HCoV-229E were cloned and expressed. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the carboxy-terminus of the nucleocapsid proteins of HCoV-NL63 strain New Haven 191 (amino acids 234-377) and HCoV-229E (amino acids 229-389) revealed minimal homology (Fig. 1B) suggesting that these recombinant proteins may be useful in serological assays. To establish that these recombinant proteins could be used to detect virus-specific antibodies, Western blot analyses were performed. As shown in Fig. 2A , recombinant protein representing amino acids 59-377 and 59-271 of HCoV-NL63 were bound by a goat anti-HCoV-229E anti-serum and therefore would not be suitable for use an antigen in an ELISA to detect HCoV-NL63-specific antibody. However, the goat anti-HCoV-229E antibody failed to detect purified recombinant protein corresponding to amino acid 234-377 of HCoV-NL63 (Fig. 2B) . Individual serum #1 (Fig. 2C) bound to both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E recombinant proteins suggesting that this person had been exposed to both viruses. Representative Western blots for a HCoV-NL63+, HCoV-229E− serum, HCoV-NL63−, HCoV-229E− serum and a HCoV-NL63−, HCoV229E+ serum (Fig. 2D ) are also shown in the figure. The ELISAs for the serum represented in the Western blots in Fig. 2D are shown in Fig. 3 . The recombinant protein-based ELISA was used to screen serum from individuals <20 years of age. Overall, 243 sera were screened (Fig. 4 and Table 1 ). The percentage of infants <2 months of age who are seropositive for HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E are 45.2% and 57.1%, respectively. The percentage of seropositive individuals drops to 4.7% for both viruses in infants 4-5 months of age (p value ≤ 0.001 for both viruses, Fisher exact test). For 2-year-old children, the percentage of seropositive children for HCoV-229E was 62.5% while the percentage of children seropositive for HCoV-NL63 was 25%. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.0366, Fisher exact test). In the 4-year-old age group and the 5-10year-old age group, >50% of children assayed tested positive for antibodies for both group I human coronaviruses. However, the percentage of 10-20-year olds who are seropositive for HCoV-229E was 35.1%. A negative result in the ELISA would indicate that either the individual has not been infected with the specific virus or that that individual has been infected but did not develop antibodies to the domain of the nucleocapsid represented in the bacterial-expressed protein. To address this issue, we randomly chose serum that tested negative for both HCoV-229E (229-389) and HCoV-NL63 and assayed these sera for HCoV-229E-specific antibodies using an HCoV-229E infected cell lysate based-ELISA (assuming that the HCoV-229E-infected cell lysate could be used as a "gold-standard"). Of the 18 serum selected that tested negative for HCoV-229E based on the recombinant protein ELISA, 16 tested negative in the HCoV-229E ELISA (negative predictive value = 89.9%). The two sera that tested positive for HCoV-229E by the infected cell lysate ELISA had low recombinant protein ELISA titers (OD450 of 0.315 and 0.286 at a 1:80 dilution). (A similar set of experiments with HCoV-NL63 could not be performed because the virus could not be propagated to sufficient titers.)
