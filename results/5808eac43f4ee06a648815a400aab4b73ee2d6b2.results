Clinical characteristics of IBV strains from southern China. In total, 206 IBV strains were isolated from chicken flocks in southern China during the period from 2013-2015. The collected IBV strains were primarily isolated from flocks of yellow-feathered broilers and broiler breeders. IBV strains were isolated from 12 provinces including Hubei (n = 47), Guangxi (n = 45), Guangdong (n = 33), Jiangsu (n = 19), Fujian (n = 13), Hunan (n = 13) Anhui (n = 13), Zhejiang (n = 6), Shandong (n = 6), Yunnan (n = 6), Sichuan (n = 3), and Chongqing (n = 2) (Fig. 1a) . Supplementary Table S1 contains the isolation information and main features of each IBV strain isolated during the study. Clinical IB disease was observed predominately in 10-40 day old chickens (74.7%; 154/206), but IBV was collected from infected chickens ranging from 8-245 days old. Of the 206 collected strains, 153 strains (83.5%) were collected in winter and spring (October to March of the next year), which are cold and wet in southern China. Of the 206 collected strains, 172 strains (83.5%) were associated with typical nephritis symptoms such as swollen specked kidney, distended ureter filled with uric acid, severe dehydration and weight loss. Nephropathogenic IB affected chickens of all ages. Typical respiratory symptoms were observed in 9.7% (20/206) of infected chickens, all of which were less than 40 days-old and included gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rale, and nasal discharge. The prevalence of IB disease in broiler breeders was 6.8% (14/206 ) and caused a decline in egg production and quality. Assessment of the diversity in the S1 gene from IBV field isolates. The S1 gene from each of the field isolates was sequenced and submitted to GenBank (accession numbers KX107628-KX107847). The accession number of each strain is provided Supplementary Table S1. Within the S1 gene, there were eight different nucleotide (1611, 1614, 1617, 1620, 1623, 1626, 1632, and 1635) and deduced amino acid (537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 544, and 545) numbers. The most common (77.2%; 159/206) S1 gene included 1620 nucleotides. Sequence alignment indicated that the other S1 genes contained mutations, insertions and/or deletions resulting in nucleotides differences and different numbers of nucleotides and deduced amino acids. There were eight cleavage site motifs (HRRRR, RRFRR, RRLRR, RRSRR, HRSRR, HRHRR, HRHKR, and HRRKR) among the isolates. The most common cleavage site motifs were HRRRR (51.5%, 106/206), RRFRR (33.5%, 69/206), and RRSRR (9.7%, 20/206). Different from the Orthomyxovirus and Paramyxovirus, the cleavage site motifs of IBV were not related to host cell, serotype and pathogenicity, but more likely related to geographic origin 21 . However, the cleavage site motifs of IBV has become complex and diverse in many regions with the spread of IBV in worldwide. Similarity analyses showed the similarities of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences ranged from 63.1-99.9% and 60.2-100%, respectively. These results indicated that the S1 gene of the field isolates was highly variable. The diversity of S1 gene may attribute to the lack of proofreading by the RDRP and specific template switching mechanism, and it is the mechanism of IBV to evolve and evade the immune surveillance of host. Phylogenetic analysis of the IBV genotypes circulating in southern China. To assess the genetic relatedness among the IBV strains, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the S1 gene nucleotide sequences that contained all 206 field isolates and 42 reference strains. As shown in Fig. 2 , there were seven distinct clusters that contained 204/206 field isolates and most of the Chinese reference strains, the QX-type, TW-type, 4/91-type, LDT3-type Mass-type, TC07-2-type, and HN08-type. Two of the field isolates, CK/CH/GX/YL1301-1 and CK/ CH/GD/LZ1401-1, were located in two individual evolutionary braches of phylogenetic tree without a reference strain and were considered variants. Three of the Chinese reference strains, BJ, CK/CH/LHLJ/95I, and CK/CH/ LDL/97I, clustered into two individual genetic groups without a field isolate. With the exception of the Mass-type and 4/91-type vaccine strains, all the field isolates and Chinese reference strains are evolutionarily distant from the non-Chinese strains (Gray, Holte, Ark99, JP9758, Australian T-strain, N1-62, and DE072) and were located in different evolutionary branches. The proportion of newly isolated field strains from each genotype is shown by province in Fig. 1b , illustrating the complexity and diversity of IBV distribution in southern China. Characterization of the QX-type IBV strains circulating in southern China. The QX-type IBV strains included in the study consisted of six reference strains and 95 field strains isolated from all 12 surveillance provinces. The QX-type field stains account for 46.1% (95/206) of isolates. Given the percentage of and geographical distribution of the QX-type viruses, we concluded that this was the predominant genotype of IBV circulating in southern China. The QX-type isolates shared a high degree of nucleotide (91.3%) and amino acid (92%) similarity between strains, and a lower degree of nucleotide (85.7%) and amino acid (85%) similarity with the vaccine strains (H120, H52, Ma5, W93, 4/91, and LDT3-A) used in China. There were two particularly notable observations regarding the QX-type IBV. First, the percentage of field isolates in the QX-type declined in this surveillance period compared to historical data. From 2004-2012, the QX-type IBV accounted for 50-60% of the total isolates in southern China in our surveillance. In the same period, Other researcher's study showed that more than 54% of Chinese IBV isolates were QX-type (or LX4-type) 10, [22] [23] [24] . During this survey (2013-2015), 46.1% of all field isolates were QX-type, and the prevalence of QX-type IBV was well below average in the provinces of Guangxi (28.9%, 13/45), Guangdong (12.2%, 4/33), and Fujian (15.3%, 2/13). Second, there were two clusters of QX-type IBV, Cluster I and Cluster II (Fig. 2) . All the QX-type reference strains in this study including the classical strains QXIBV, A2, and LX4 were grouped in Cluster I. While 48 isolates were grouped to Cluster I, they were in different terminal evolutionary branches from the classical QX-type reference strains (QXIBV, A2 and LX4). The Cluster II QX-type strains started to emerge in about 2010 (unpublished observation) and they have rapidly increased as a percentage of all QX-type strains. In this study, Cluster II strains account for about 50% (47/95) of the QX-type isolates. Compared to the classical QXIBV strain, the Cluster I strains have 96-98.2% nucleotide sequence similarity and 94.6-96.3% amino acid sequence similarity. The Cluster II strains have slightly lower nucleotide (94.9-97.2%) and amino acid (92-94.3%) similarities to QXIBV. Therefore, all the newly isolated QX-type strains deviated evolutionarily from the classical strains. Sequence alignment of 95 QX-type strains with reference strain QXIBV was performed. The result showed that there were large variations in some nucleotides universally between the two sub-genotype strains (Supplement Table S2 ). We speculated that the accumulation of nucleotide substitution may contribute to the formation of two sub-genotypes. Scientific REPORTs | 7: 6576 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-06987-2 Characterization of the TW I-type IBV strains circulating in southern China. IBV strains in the TW I-type group were the second most common IBV strains identified in southern China. The TW-type originated from Taiwan and contains two subtypes: TW I and TW II. Based on the phylogenetic analyses, all 55 of the strains isolated in this study are members of the TW I-type. The TW-type reference strains utilized here included five Taiwanese strains (TW2575/98, TW3468/07, TW3071/03, TW3263/04, and T07/02) and two strains from mainland China (CK/CH/HuN/NX09 and CK/CH/SC/ZJ10-1). TW I-type strains accounted for 26.7% (55/206) of all isolates and were found in ten provinces: Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Fujian, Hunan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Yunnan, and Sichuan. The TW I-type strains were more prevalent than the QX-type viruses in Guangdong (33.3% vs 12.2%) and Guangxi (54.5% vs 28.9%). The TW I-type isolates shared 95.9-99.5% and 94.5-98.8 nucleotide and amino acid identity, respectively, with the Taiwanese reference strain TW2575/98, but less than 82% and 82.3% nucleotide and amino acid identity, respectively, with the strains from other mainland China and vaccine strains (H120, H52, Ma5, W93, 4/91, and LDT3-A). These observations may suggest the different serotype and low protection between vaccine strains and TW I-type isolate strains. Characterization of the 4/91-type IBV strains circulating in southern China. IBV strains in the 4/91-type group were the third most common IBV strains identified in southern China. The strains that were classified as the 4/91-type consisted of 33 new isolates and four reference strains. The field isolates were isolated from Hubei, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, and Yunnan. The reference strains were 7/93, TA03, and the Figure 2 . A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the S1 gene from the 206 isolated field strains and 42 published reference strains using the neighbor-joining method and setting bootstrap 1000 replicates. The vaccine strains that are used in China are marked with ' ' . The Chinese reference strains are marked with ' ' . The foreign reference strains are marked with ' ' . Two variant strains that were the result of recombination were isolated and marked with ' ' . Unmarked strains are field strains isolated in this study. pathogenic and vaccine 4/91 strains. The newly isolated 4/91-type strains accounted for 16.0% (33/206) of all the field isolates. Compared to each other, the 4/91-type IBV isolates shared greater than 94.1% and 93% nucleotide and amino acid identity, respectively. Compared to the vaccine 4/91 strain, they had greater than 96% and 94.6% nucleotide and amino acid identity, respectively. There were five field isolates (CK/CH/GX/GL1301-1, CK/ CH/GX/NN1306, CK/CH/GX/GL1311-1, CK/CH/GX/GL1311-2, and CK/CH/GD/LZ1311) that clustered and shared greater than 99% homologous at the nucleotide and amino acid levels with the pathogenic and vaccine 4/91 strains. The S1 nucleotide sequences were compared between the 5 field isolates and reference 4/91 strains to determine whether the field isolates originate from pathogenic (Supplement Fig. S1 ). The five field isolates and the pathogenic 4/91 strain has the same nucleotides in positions 283, 1522, and 1589. In contrast, the vaccine 4/91 strain has mutations at these three positions that lead to attenuating amino acid substitutions (95, 508 and 530) 25 . The membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) genes from the field isolates located in phylogenetic clusters and shared high nucleotide similarity with Chinese reference strains rather than 4/91 vaccine or pathogenic strain (Supplement Fig. S2 ). These results indicated, the five field isolates were not likely originated from vaccine strain, but from the pathogenic 4/91 strain and that there may have been recombination between the pathogenic 4/91 strain and other circulating IBV strains.
