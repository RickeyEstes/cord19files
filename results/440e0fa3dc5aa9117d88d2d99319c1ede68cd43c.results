From November 1993 to September 1995, 18 of the 33 veterinarians submitted samples from at least 2 herds (range 2 to 7). Altogether, 218 faecal samples from diarrheic dairy calves in 65 herds were submitted. Herd sizes ranged from 12 to 650 cows (median 49 cows). Of 218 calves, 64, 57, 68 and 29 calves were 1±7, 8± 14, 15±21 and 22±30 days old, respectively. The mean age of the studied calves was 13.3 days (median 12 days). Rotavirus infection was detected in 46.9%, 45.6%, 33.8% and 48.3% of the calves in the age-groups 1±7, 8±14, 15±21 and 22±30 days, respectively (Table 1) . No signi®cant dierences in the detection rate of rotavirus were found among calves on the dierent age-groups. The mean age of the rotavirus infected calves was 12.9 days (range 1 to 30 days). Only rotavirus was detected in 39 of the 93 (41.9%) diarrheic calves positive to this agent. Concomitant infections with other enteropathogen(s) were detected in 31.3%, 33.3%, 20.6% and 3.4% of the rotavirus infected calves in the age-groups 1±7, 8±14, 15±21 and 22±30 days, respectively (Table 1) . A signi®cant ageassociated decrease in the detection rate of mixed infections ( p < 0.01) was found. The detection rates of the other enteropathogens considered in calves with rotavirus infection were 20.4% for coronavirus (11/54), 85.2% for Cryptosporidium (46/54), 16.7% for F5 + E. coli (9/54) and 1.8% for Salmonella (1/54) (Table 1) . Thus, the combination rotavirus±Cryptosporidium was found in all but 7 of the calves with mixed infection ( Table 1) . The overall detection rate of Cryptosporidium sp., F5 + E. coli, coronavirus and Salmonella spp. in the diarrheic calves studied was 52.3%, 11.9%, 7.3% and 0.9%, respectively.
