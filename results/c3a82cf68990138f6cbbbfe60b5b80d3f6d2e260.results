A total of 375 patients entered this study. Eight patients were admitted twice during the study period, resulting in a total of 383 episodes analysed with blood culture and both NAATs. For the multiplex PCR, the whole process control was invalid or partially invalid in 45 (12%) of the 383 blood samples initially tested. These samples were retested on a ten-fold dilution of the extracted DNA. After the re-run, one sample did still not give a final result and was excluded from further analysis, making a total of 382 episodes. At least one microorganism was detected in 138 episodes by either method. Microorganisms defined as commensals (Table 1) were considered to be contaminants and excluded from analysis if only found on a single occasion regardless of detection method. In total, 89 clinically relevant findings or findings of unknown significance were identified in 77 episodes (20%). A detailed description including clinical comments for these findings can be found in Additional file 1. In eight episodes, a clinically relevant finding was detected by blood culture in a bottle not included in that pair of bottles from which aliquots for the microarray analysis was derived. Thus, these eight episodes were excluded from the analysis of the microarray results. For blood culture, the result of species identification was usually available 6-7 hours after a bottle has flagged positive ( Figure 2 ). The turnaround time for the multiplex PCR assay was estimated to around seven hours. For the microarray, the turnaround time from positive blood culture bottle to species identification was approximately four hours. The diagnostic performance for blood culture and the NAATs are shown in Table 2 .
