Application of several TM prediction tools suggests a range of amino acids within the N terminal part of the protein (Fig. 1A) . The longest stretch is suggested by SOSUI from Lys-2 to Ala-28 and the shortest stretch by DAS (Val-5 to Thr-18). All other programs place the start of the helix between residues Lys-2 to Ile-4 and the end between Thr-18 to Ala-28. For the experimental and computational investigations a consensus length of 18 residues from Leu-3 to Val-20 is chosen.
