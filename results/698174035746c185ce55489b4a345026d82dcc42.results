BMDCs are more susceptible than monocytes to PRRSV infection Before studying the co-infection between PRRSV and S. suis, the toxicity as well as the infectivity and the replication of the IAF-Klop PRRSV and S. suis strains when cultured with porcine monocytes and BMDCs was assessed. Preliminary studies with different bacterial/virus ratios and incubation times were tested and those used in the present study represent the best combination that avoided toxicity. In fact, higher virus or bacterial concentration resulted in high toxicity for cells (data not shown). PRRSV replicated in both cell types, significantly increasing the amount of viral RNAs with time (Fig 1) . Following PRRSV infection, viral replication in BMDCs is significantly higher than that in monocytes. BMDCs are more permissive to the virus (P < 0.05), since at t = 0 h (2 h after incubation with virus), PRRSV load was already greater in BMDCs (23.8 ± 1.3 Ct) compared to monocytes (27.2 ± 1.4 Ct). The virus also replicated more rapidly in BMDCs (P < 0.05). Indeed, after 16 h of infection, the viral load in BMDCs reached 14.5 ± 0.6 Ct, compared with 22.7 ± 0.6 Ct in monocytes. The RT-qPCR values corresponded to an increase from 10 2 at 0 h to almost 10 5 TCID 50 /ml in BMDCs after 16 of infection (data not shown). Between 16 h and 24 h of culture, PRRSV replication reached a plateau in BMDCs, whereas for monocytes, a delayed but continuous viral replication was observed after 16 h; viral load was nonetheless still lower than that of BMDCs. Bacterial replication was also highly significant, increasing from originally 10 5 up to more than 10 8 CFU/ml after 12 h of incubation time (data not shown).
