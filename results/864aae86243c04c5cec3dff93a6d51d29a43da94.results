The mean MCQ score for all of the 314 doctors was 68 ± 7 (range: 40e86). After further analysis, the mean scores in the four groups were 68 ± 7 (range: 52e82) in the R2 group, 69 ± 7 (range: 40e86) in the R1a group, 68 ± 8 (range: 48e86) in the R1b group, and 69 ± 7 (range: 46e86) in the PGY group. There was no significant difference between the four groups (p ¼ 0.424). The passing rates of the first and last 25% were used to determine the item discrimination and difficulty index for the MCQ test. The item discrimination index was defined as follows: Bad ( 0.19), acceptable (0.2e0.29), good (0.3e0.39), and excellent (!0.4). The item difficulty index was defined as difficult (<0.4), moderate (0.4e0.6), and easy (>0.6). Among the 50 MCQ items, the item discrimination index was bad in 27 (54%), acceptable in 11 (22%), good in six (12%), and excellent in six [12%; Fig. 1A ]. We re-evaluated the trainees' performance after excluding the 27 items with a bad index. The mean number of items passed was 13.2 in Group R2, 13.8 in Group R1a, 12.8 in Group R1b, and 13.5 in Group PGY. There was also no significant difference [p ¼ 0.429, Fig. 2 ]. The item difficulty index was easy in 9 (39%), moderate in 10 (44%), and difficult in four (17%) of 23 items [Fig. 1B] . In the OSCE, the mean final scores of the six stations were 64.6 ± 6.5 in Group R2, 64.9 ± 6 in Group R1a, 64.1 ± 6.2 in Group R1b, and 68 ± 4.8 in Group PGY. The p value was 0.082 for the four groups [ANCOVA, Fig. 3 ]. When the performance difference between the assessments was analyzed, the p values were 0.236 for the SP-stations assessment and 0.527 for the clinical skills performance assessment. Finally, the correlation coefficient between the MCQ and the OSCE of all trainees was 0.333 [p ¼ 0.002, Fig. 4 ].
