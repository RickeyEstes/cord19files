To determine the expression of ACE2 in normal pancreas of humans, we used the GTEx database to explore ACE2 expression. We found ACE2 was expressed in many organs or tissues except most brain tissues (Fig. 1A) , which suggests that these organs or tissues such as unreported ovary and thyroid might also be targets for SARS-CoV-2. For comparison, we compared ACE2 expression in lung and pancreatic tissues, since the lung is known to be the first target organ to be attacked by SARS-CoV-2. The mRNA level of ACE2 in pancreas was higher than that in lung ( Fig. 1A , P < 0.001, Wilcoxon signed rank test). To investigate the distribution of ACE2 in the pancreas, we analyzed two scRNA-seq datasets. We identified different types of pancreatic cells, such as alpha cell, beta cell, acinar cell, ductal cell and several other types of cells (Fig. 1B, D) . In GSE85241, ACE2 was expressed in 55 cells (2.59%) among the total 2126 cells, most of which (81.82%) were expressed in exocrine gland (duct cells and acinar cells), and a few (16.36%) were expressed in pancreatic islets (alpha, beta, delta and PP cells) (Fig. 1C , (Fig. 1E , Table 1 ). Individual differences between donors from different sources may lead to differences in the analysis results of the two scRNA-seq datasets. These data still indicate that ACE2 is expressed in both the exocrine glands and islets, which may be the main potential part targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in the pancreas, resulting in .

In our study cohort, among the indicators of pancreatitis we focused on, the main ones were the elevation of serum amylase and lipase. In mild cases, 1.85% (1/54) of patients showed elevated levels of both amylase and lipase, while in severe cases, the proportion of increased amylase was 17.91% (12/64) and the proportion of increased lipase was 16.41% (11/64) ( Table 2 ). However, in the imaging evaluation, only 5 severe patients (7.46%) showed changes in the pancreas, mainly focal enlargement of the pancreas or dilatation of the pancreatic duct, without acute necrosis (Fig. 2) . These clinical data show that there exist mild pancreatic lesions in some patients with COVID-19, mainly in severe cases.
