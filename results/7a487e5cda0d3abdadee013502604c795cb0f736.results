Six real-time duplex PCR assays, using EvaGreen fluorescent dye, were developed to identify 12 common respiratory viruses directly from clinical samples, after nucleic acid extraction. The amplicon size of the target region of each virus varied from 71 to 182 bp, with a melting temperature ranging from 73 C to 88 C. Each duplex reaction was designed so that the melting temperatures of the 2 target viruses were clearly distinguishable (Fig. 1) . The analytical sensitivity of all duplex PCR assays was determined using serial dilutions of the cloned target sequences, quantified by NanoDrop 1000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) ( Table 4 ). In Table 4 , the highest dilution which was always positive when repeated 10 times is shown; a further dilution was always negative, or positive in less than 50% of the times. The duplex real-time PCR 1 was able to detect 10 3 copies/ ml of influenza A virus and 10 4 copies/ml of influenza B virus. The sensitivity of the duplex 2 was of 10 5 copies/ml for PIV2 and 10 4 copies/ml for hMPV. Reaction 3 detected 10 4 copies/ml of CoVI and 10 3 copies/ml of hRV/EV; 10 4 copies/ml and 10 3 copies/ml of PIV1,3 and hRSV, respectively, were detected by reaction 4. The sensitivity of reaction 5 was 10 4 copies/ml for both targets. The sensitivity of reaction 6 to detect hAdV and HBoV was 10 3 copies/ml for both targets. To evaluate the specificity of each duplex real-time PCR, each cloned target sequence (10 7 copies/ml) was tested individually by the 6 duplex reactions. In addition, a pool was prepared containing 10 7 copies/ml of each positive control. This pool was then tested with each duplex real-time PCR. The results confirmed that each duplex could identify only its specific targets. Furthermore, in order to assess the intra-assay and inter-assay variability of each duplex real-time PCR, each clinical sample was assayed 3 times in the same run and all the positive samples were assayed in 3 different runs with reproducible results. Table 5 hRSV was detected in 8 (5%) patients, all children; CoVI was detected in 6 (3.8%) children while hAdV was detected in 5 (3.2%) patients, 4 children and 1 adult hospitalized in ICU. In this patient hAdV was detected only in BAL sample. PIV2 was detected only in the throat swab sample of 2 patients (1.3%), 1 adult and 1 child, and hMPV was detected only in the throat sample of 1 adult patient (0.64%). In 6 clinical samples 2 or more viruses were detected; in particular EV/hRV were the most common viruses detected in mixed infections (5/6) ( Table 6 ). All patients with mixed infections were children. The results of the duplex PCR assays, were confirmed by comparison with a commercial, validated, assay, (r-gene for respiratory viruses detection, Biom erieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) which gave similar results. In fact all the samples, positive with the duplex PCR assays, were positive also with the commercial assay. With reference to the 132 samples negative by the duplex PCR assays, 1 was positive for PIV with the commercial test. Thus, altogether, the sensitivity of the assay proposed was 98%. In addition, the positive results were confirmed by sequencing. Concerning the 17 EV/hRV detected, their melting temperature varied from 82 C to 85,90 C. Four could be considered as hRV because of their melting temperature lower than 83.5 , 6 as EV, while 7 had a melting temperature ranging from 83.5 C to 85 C and could not be identified on this basis. The results of sequencing confirmed what had been inferred from the melting temperature data and allowed us to identify the 7 samples not previously e e e e þ e þ Table 5 Intra-assay and inter-assay variability of the results of the 6 duplex PCR assays performed with the positive controls (mean of the melting temperature of each amplicon ± standard deviation).
