Loss of Per1 leads to an increase in D-GalN/LPS-induced lethality. To examine the effects of Per1 loss on the inflammatory response, mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS in combination with D-GalN. In the Per1 − / − mice group, mortality became apparent at 5-6 h, and all mice died by 10 h. In the wild-type (WT) mice group, no death was observed at 6 h; the first animal death was observed at 8 h, and the survival rate was 60% at 24 h (Figure 1a ). Based on the survival rate, additional WT and Per1 − / − mice were killed 5 h after D-GalN/LPS administration to obtain blood samples and liver tissues for liver enzyme and tissue analyses. Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) activities were found to be significantly higher in Per1 − / − mice than that in WT mice (Figure 1b) . Histological examination of the liver tissues revealed more prominent liver damage in Per1 − / − mice ( Figure 1c ). In the Per1 − / − mice group, massive hemorrhagic necrosis and hepatocyte apoptosis were observed, with prominent vascular congestion and inflammatory cell infiltration. In contrast, liver damage and histological changes were found to be significantly less severe in WT mice. Then, we explored the impact of Per1 on non-lethal liver inflammation induced by D-GalN/LPS treatment. The results showed that none of the WT mice treated with 3 μg/kg LPS and 200 mg/kg D-GalN died. Administration of D-GalN/LPS at this lower dosage caused no apparent liver injury in WT mice. In Per1 − / − mice, the same dose of D-GalN/ LPS induced significant liver injury, as detected by increased transaminase activities and histological changes (Figures 1d  and e) . Loss of Per1 increases D-GalN/LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Current models of D-GalN/LPS have associated outcomes with elevated production of inflammatory cytokines; thus, we measured the levels of serum cytokines in mice after D-GalN/LPS administration. Serum TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly higher in Per1 − / − mice than in WT mice ( Figure 2a ). Real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and MCP-1 (Figures 2b-e) revealed that the expression of all these cytokines was markedly elevated in the Per1 − / − mice either with or without D-GalN/LPS treatment. Loss of Per1 increases the number of KCs in the liver. We then examined the response of Per1 − / − cells to LPS. Peritoneal macrophages were isolated from WT and Per1 − / − mice and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml). The expression of cytokines in macrophages was measured by real-time RT-PCR at 3 h after stimulation. Unexpectedly, Per1 deletion had no influence on the expression of any of the cytokines (Supplementary Figure S1 ). To confirm the phenotypes observed here, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing Per1 by electroporation as described previously. 17 However, no changes in LPSinduced cytokine production were observed in either of the groups (Supplementary Figure S1 ). We next determined the number of KCs in the livers of Per1 − / − and WT mice. Administration of D-GalN/LPS significantly increased the number of KCs in both genotypes. Either under baseline conditions or after D-GalN/LPS challenge, a marked increase was observed in the number of KCs in the livers of Per1 − / − mice compared with the livers of WT mice, as shown by immunohistochemistry using a specific antibody against the KC marker genes F4/80 and CD68 (Figures 3a and b) , as well as by the increased hepatic expression of F4/80 and CD68 (Figures 3c and d) . We further used flow cytometry to identify specific populations of myeloid cells in the mouse liver. The data showed a significant increase in total F4/80 + cells in untreated and treated Per1 − / − mice ( Figure 3e ). F4/80 + CD11b + cells showed a strong capacity for the production of cytokines in response to LPS. 18 The relative number of these cells also increased in Per1 − / − mice, either under baseline conditions or after D-GalN/LPS treatment ( Figure 3e ). These results implied that the increase in the number of KCs in Per1 − / − livers may contribute to the immune response to LPS and to increased hepatic cytokine production. Per1 had no influence on the proliferation or apoptosis of macrophages. The increased number of macrophages in Per1-deficient livers could be the result of enhanced proliferation and/or impaired apoptosis of macrophages. Local production of M-CSF in the liver has a crucial role in the proliferation and maturation of KCs. 19 We found that Per1 deficiency did not significantly change the hepatic expression of M-CSF (Supplementary Figure S2A) . A cell cycle analysis of peritoneal macrophages isolated from WT and Per1 − / − mice revealed similar numbers of macrophages undergoing the G0/G1, S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Supplementary Figure S2 ). An annexin V/PI assay was performed on macrophages harvested at 2, 4, 7 and 12 days of culture under routine conditions to assess the percentage of early apoptotic (annexin V+/PI − ) and late apoptotic/ necrotic (annexin V+/PI+) cells. The WT and Per1-deficient macrophages displayed similar changes over time (Supplementary Figure S2) . Therefore, we concluded that Per1 has no influence on the proliferation or apoptosis of macrophages. Per1 deficiency increases hepatic Ccr2 expression and enhances hepatic macrophage migration. The increased number of KCs could also be due to enhanced monocyte/ macrophage recruitment to the liver. FACS analysis revealed a decrease in total CD115 + circulating monocytes in the peripheral blood of Per1 − / − mice. The relative number of CD115 + CD11b + monocytes was also decreased in Per1 − / − mice ( Figure 4a ). This observation implies that hepatic macrophage recruitment is enhanced in Per1 − / − mice. It was suggested previously that CCR2/MCP-1 chemotaxis is responsible for the mobilization and subsequent trafficking of monocytes/macrophages to the liver. [6] [7] [8] We have shown that Figure 4d ). Next, a cell chemotaxis assay was performed on the peritoneal macrophages isolated from WT and Per1 − / − mice. We found that macrophage chemotaxis was significantly induced by MCP-1 stimulation. Macrophages lacking Per1 exhibited higher chemotactic activity than WT macrophages ( Figure 4e ). Per1 mediates Ccr2 expression in macrophages through the PPAR-γ pathway. Previous studies reported that Ccr2 expression was repressed by signaling pathways involving PPAR-γ activation. [20] [21] [22] To investigate whether Per1 mediates Ccr2 expression in macrophages through the PPAR-γ pathway, macrophages lacking or overexpressing Per1 were [20] [21] [22] We found that GW9662 reversed either the upregulation of Ccr2 expression by Per1 deletion in peritoneal macrophages or the downregulation of Ccr2 expression by Per1 overexpression in RAW264.7 cells (Figures 7a and b) , suggesting that Per1 regulates Ccr2 expression in macrophages through the PPAR-γ pathway. Real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that Per1 had no significant effect on PPAR-γ expression in macrophages (Figures 7c-e) , implying that Per1 may mediate Ccr2 expression by influencing the activation of PPAR-γ. PER1 interacts with PPAR-γ. A ChIP mapping experiment indicated that both PER1 and PPAR-γ bind specifically to only the -180/+16-bp region of Ccr2 promoter (Figure 8a ), implying that PER1 protein may interact with PPAR-γ. Vectors expressing HA-tagged PER1 and PPAR-γ2 were transfected into B6F10 cells. Immunoblots showed recovery of PPAR-γ2 from B6F10 cells after immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody. As expected, we discovered a physical association between PER1 and PPAR-γ2 (Figure 8b ). Addition of troglitazone (a synthetically specific PPAR-γ ligand) [23] [24] [25] or GW9662 did not significantly alter the association between these two proteins in immunoprecipitation assays (Figure 8c) . Finally, we used a series of HA-tagged deletion mutants of PPAR-γ2 and investigated their interaction with PER1. Our results showed that amino acids 1-280 of PPAR-γ2 interact strongly with PER1, and a further deletion of 97 amino acids (1-183) abolished the ability of PPAR-γ2 to bind to PER1 (Figure 8d) , demonstrating that residues 183-280 of PPAR-γ2 directly interact with PER1. However, residues 183-505, which also contain amino acids 183-280, could not bind to PER1. Despite not directly binding to PER1, residues 1-183 of PPAR-γ2 may be indispensable to proper structure of PPAR-γ2 and its association with PER1.
