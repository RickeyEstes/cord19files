The incidence of emergency resuscitation accounted for 360 of 14 264 (2.5%) hospitalized cases in period 1 and 312 of 10 444 (3.0%) hospitalized cases in period 2 ( Table I) . The numbers of cases that were not intubated, rapid sequence intubation cases and 'do not resuscitate' orders signed during resuscitation were significantly higher in period 2 compared with period 1. The ED coped with more patients requiring emergency resuscitation in period 2. The age distribution and number of pneumonia cases were not significantly different between the two periods. However, the numbers of female patients and cases with a fever episode within 3 days prior to resuscitation significantly increased. The failure rate of resuscitation in period 2 was 1.59 times [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17e2.16] that in period 1. A comparison of changes in the process in emergency resuscitation between periods 1 and 2 is shown in Table II . There was no significant difference in response time or number of participating resuscitators between the two periods. The proportion of cases who received emergency resuscitation less than 30 min in duration was 51.9% (187 cases) in period 1 compared with 38.5% (120 cases) in period 2 [odds ratio (OR): 0.58; 95% CI 0.42e0.79]. The changes of process in emergency resuscitation in patients with fever or diagnosis, including pneumonia, are shown in Table III . There were no differences in the number of cases with regard to location, time of resuscitation and result of resuscitation. However, the number of emergency intubations with rapid sequence intubation in fever was significantly higher in period 2 (OR: 4.74; 95% CI: 1.00e23.11). Furthermore, the number of cases receiving emergency treatment from fewer than two participating resuscitators was significantly higher in period 2 (OR: 2.76; 95% CI: 1.08e5.96) for fever patients, but there was no change for pneumonia patients.
