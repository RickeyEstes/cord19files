We sent 159 recruitment emails to global health physicians and global health programme leaders at 25 different academic medical institutions. Eight global health physicians and four global health programme leaders completed the online questionnaire, while one global health physician and three global health programme leaders who completed the questionnaire agreed to participate in a semi-structured interview. In addition, we conducted semi-structured interviews with six global health physicians and two global health programme leaders who were identified through snowball and purposeful sampling. In total, participants represented seven unique academic medical institutions located throughout the USA and ranged from 33 to 68 years of age. Four participants reported beginning their global health work in the 2000s, two reported beginning in the 1990s and one each reported beginning in the 1980s and 1970s. We were unable to identify differences between programme leaders and global health physician responses, likely a result of several participants falling into both categories and similar motivations for participants in each category. We present in table 1 the domains of engagement in global health for these participants and the emergent themes identified through analysis of the qualitative data in table 2. Improved and more engaged patient rapport and patient care All eight of the interviewed participants indicated that their global health work had improved their ability to build rapport with and provide care for immigrant, refugee and low-income individuals in the USA. They attributed perceived improved patient rapport to a variety of reasons, such as being able to speak to patients in their own language, understand their cultural background and better understand the challenges unique to immigrant, refugee and patients of low-socioeconomic position. As one participant noted, 'If I bring some of these things up, then I break a barrier and have a good relationship very quickly' (GHP #1, interview). Another participant discussed similar experiences that have helped them build rapport in the emergency department where they work: 'I speak a couple languages which working abroad has taught me. I speak Spanish, I speak Creole, soâ€¦[with some patients] there is that automatic connection' (GHP #3, interview). Several participants remarked during interviews and in questionnaire responses that patient rapport is vital to the work of caring for patients, and that learning to speak another language was a direct result of their global health work. Half of participants reported that their global health work improved the quality of care they were able provide to their patients back home. Participants reported this as being 'more efficient' as a result of taking better patient histories and physical exams, that they were less inclined to carry out 'unnecessary and invasive tests', or being more patient-centred 35 as they had a greater awareness to the patient's economic and/or cultural context. One participant reported that they were 'more likely to speak to a patient about options that did not include very aggressive care', and that they may be 'a little more comfortable' offering to 'do nothing' (PL #6, interview). The following participant quote also exemplifies this theme: Each time I practice abroad and then come back to the US, I find that I am more compassionate and empathetic, because I have been practicing how to focus on the person in front of me while I was away, and to think clinically (instead of focusing on the computer and the paperwork) (GHP #4, questionnaire).
