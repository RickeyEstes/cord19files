Over three months of operation, 1074 samples were tested by Liat in the ED. Of these, 47 samples were excluded from the analysis: 28 because the results were illegible/not recorded in the log book and 19 because of an invalid result. This left 1027 samples for inclusion in the main analysis (tested population). Invalid results were those where Liat displayed a result as 'indeterminate' or 'invalid', which occurred when the internal analyser determined that a PCR curve was abnormal or the internal positive control was not detected. The finding that 19 of 1074 (1.8%) results were invalid was the same as another recent study [3] . In 672 (65.4%) cases, an rPCR/fPCR was performed within one day to allow evaluation of the Liat result (analysed population): 40 vs fPCR and 632 vs rPCR. Inclusion in the analysed population was more likely for negative results [580/691 (83.9%)] than positive results [92/308 (29.9%); P < 0.0001], reflecting the policy to routinely retest negative samples by rPCR. This meant that the prevalence of influenza was lower in the analysed population than the tested population (13.5% vs 30%; P < 0.0001). Influenza was detected in 308 (30%) of the tested population: influenza A in 157 (15.3%), influenza B in 149 (14.5%) and mixed influenza A and B in two (0.2%). RSV was detected in 28 (2.7%) and no virus was detected in 691 (67.2%). Results are provided in Table I. For influenza A, there were six false-positive results (five vs rPCR, one vs fPCR) and nine false-negative results (nine vs rPCR). For influenza B, there were 10 false-positive results (eight vs rPCR, two vs fPCR) and six false-negative results (six vs rPCR). All false-negative results were detected by rPCR at high Ct values [median 33, interquartile range (IQR) 30e35]. All true-positive Liat results detected by rPCR (N Â¼ 69) had Ct values 35 (median 28, IQR 24e30). For the modified analysis, two false-positive results and two false-negative results were removed because subsequent rPCR/fPCR testing validated the original Liat result. Another two false-positive results were removed because the Liat result was recorded as 'POCT negative' elsewhere, suggesting a transcription error in the log book. From the modified analysis, sensitivity for influenza A or B was 85.4% (95% CI 76.3e92.0) and specificity was 98.1% (95% CI 96.6e99.0) ( Table I) . Of the 565 true-negative Liat results that were tested using rPCR, no virus was detected in 431 (76.3%). In the remaining 134, the following were detected in decreasing order of frequency: coronavirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza types 3 and 4, RSV, enterovirus/ paraechovirus, bocavirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
