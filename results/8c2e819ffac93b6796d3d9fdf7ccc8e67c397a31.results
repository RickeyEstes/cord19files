Oligomerization of HT cyt c 552 in E. coli cells. To investigate formation of oligomers in E. coli, we freezethawed E. coli cells expressing wild-type (WT) HT cyt c 552 , and performed size exclusion chromatography for the extracted solution. Peaks were observed at elution volumes of 50-75 and 85 ml in the chromatogram (Fig. 1A) . The peak at 85 ml corresponded to that of monomeric HT cyt c 552 . The ratio of the absorption at 410 nm to that at 280 nm (Abs 410 /Abs 280 ) for the fractions at 50-75 ml was about 3.6 ( Fig. 1A) . Heme staining was performed for the sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS)-PAGE gel of the fractions obtained by size exclusion chromatography to investigate the presence of heme c (Fig. 1B) . A main band with a mass corresponding to the molecular weight of HT cyt c 552 (9.2 kDa) was detected in all of the fractions at 50-75 ml. This value corresponded well to that of HT cyt c 552 . Therefore, we attributed the peak at 50-75 ml to HT cyt c 552 oligomers. However, no oligomers were detected in the chromatogram when HT cyt c 552 and cyt c 552 free E. coli lysate were freeze-thawed together (Supplementary information, Fig. S1 ), indicating that HT cyt c 552 oligomers were formed in E. coli by non-covalent association of its monomers. Structure of dimeric HT cyt c 552 obtained from E. coli. To elucidate the detailed structure of dimeric HT cyt c 552 obtained from the E. coli expression system, we purified dimeric HT cyt c 552 and solved its X-ray crystallographic structure (PDB code: 4ZID) (Supplementary information, Table S1 ). There was one HT cyt c 552 protomer in the asymmetric unit of the crystal, and a domain-swapped structure of dimeric HT cyt c 552 was obtained at 1.8 Å resolution (Fig. 2) . The hinge loop was composed of Ala18, Lys19, and Lys20. The N-terminal α -helix from Asn1 to Lys17, together with the heme, was swapped between protomers in the dimer. The dimeric structure was similar to that obtained previously by treatment with ethanol (PDB code: 3VYM) 12 . The root-mean-square deviation value of Cα carbons between the protomer structure of the dimer obtained from the E. coli expression system and that obtained previously by treatment with ethanol (PDB code: 3VYM) was 0.43 Å, indicating that the protomer structures were similar.
