Assay optimization and analytical sensitivity. No difference in sensitivity was observed between the viral strains tested or between lots of slides. A sample dilution of 1:20 for IgM and 1:40 for POWV IgG IFAs demonstrated the optimal balance between sensitivity and nonspecific background staining (Fig. 1 ). Tick-borne disease (TBD) samples with titers of 1:320 and 1:160 in the plaque reduction neutralization test using a 90% reduction cutoff (PRNT 90 ) were assayed at optimized screening dilutions to confirm. All but one of the POWV encephalitis samples obtained from the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) with PRNT 90 titers of 1:20 were detected by the TBE-C EIA screen and confirmatory POWV IFA. A PRNT 90 titer of 1:20 was determined to be the limit of detection (LOD) for the serologic test panel and was confirmed as such using known PRNT 90 -positive samples (Table 1) . At these screening dilutions, the serologic panel showed an analytical sensitivity of 89% (Table 1) . Reproducibility studies showed 100% accordance (k ϭ 1.0). Analytical specificity. Due to limited sample volume availability for the heterologous-flavivirus (HF) sample set, only yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccinee samples could be analyzed in replicate runs at two different dilutions to check IFA specificity. A sample known to be positive for YFV IgG antibodies (vaccinee 3) had a positive POWV IgG IFA result at a 1:20 dilution but was negative at a 1:40 dilution. A sample known to be positive for YFV IgM antibodies (vaccinee 1) had a positive POWV IgM IFA result at a 1:10 dilution but was negative at a 1:20 dilution (Fig. 2) . Both of these samples were negative when tested at the optimized screening dilutions used for the panel. Only one recent YFV vaccine sample demonstrated cross-reactivity in the POWV IgG IFAs (Table 2) when assayed at optimal screening dilutions. The HF samples demonstrated significant cross-reactivity in the TBE-C IgG EIA, but at a 1:40 dilution, the POWV IgG IFA specificity for non-TBE-C HF samples was 65% ( Table 2 ). This is comparable to other commercial IFAs. Fewer HF samples demonstrated cross-reactivity in the TBE-C IgM EIA than in the TBE-C IgG EIA, and no cross-reactivity was seen in the POWV IgM IFA with any of the HF samples run at screening dilutions (Table 3) . Clinical testing. Twenty-two (20%) of the TBD samples had TBE-C optical density (OD) ratios above baseline and were tested in the POWV confirmatory IFA. One-half of these samples (n ϭ 11, Table 4 ) were IFA positive for antibodies to POWV. Two of the three POWV IgG IFA-positive samples were PRNT 90 positive (samples 13 and 19) . The third sample (sample 12) was negative in the PRNT 90 and West Nile virus (WNV) IgG positive, demonstrating evidence of cross-reactivity in the POWV IgG IFA. All eight samples that were positive only in the POWV IgM IFA were negative in the PRNT. POWV nucleic acid was detectable by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) in one sample (sample 16 in Table 4 ). POWV seroprevalence for the TBD sample set was determined to be 9.4% (10 of 106). Of the 100 non-TBD samples from areas where Lyme disease is endemic, 23% (n ϭ 23) had TBE-C EIA OD ratios higher than baseline and were tested by POWV IFA. Six of the 23 EIA-positive samples were IFA positive for antibodies to POWV (Table 5) , with four samples being IgG IFA positive and two samples IFA positive for IgG and IgM. Three of the four IgG IFA-positive samples were positive for WNV IgG, again demonstrating cross-reactivity of the IgG with WNV. The fourth sample was negative by PRNT 90 . POWV seroprevalence for the non-TBD sample set was determined to be 2% (2 of 100). Patients with suspected TBD, who were tested for Lyme disease, are significantly (P ϭ 0.034) more likely to have evidence of POWV infection than asymptomatic patients from an area where Lyme disease is endemic but who did not have a history of recent tick exposure. Six of the 22 control samples from an area in which Lyme disease was not endemic had TBE-C EIA OD ratios above the cutoff in the IgM assay, but none were positive in the POWV IFAs (0 of 22). None of these samples were above the cutoff in the TBE-C IgG EIA.
