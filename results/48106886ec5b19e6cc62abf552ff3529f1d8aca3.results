The demographic characteristics of 158 cases with laboratory-confirmed viral infections are presented in Table 1 . Ninety (57%) cases were from China and 68 (43%) were from Vietnam. The mean age of HCWs was 32·8 years and most participants were nurses (65%) and female (87%). Most cases were non-smokers (92%) and had not received influenza vaccine (86%). Viruses isolated included rhinovirus (n = 75, 47%), RSV (n = 28, 18%), influenza (n = 13, 8%), PIV (n = 12, 8%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV; n = 7, 4%), coronavirus (n = 7, 4%) and ADV (n = 1, 1%). More than one virus was isolated in 15 cases (9·5%), including nine cases with influenza co-infection. Fever was documented in 23·4% cases (37/158) with a positive laboratory viral diagnosis. Table 2 details rates of fever (538°C) associated with individual viral respiratory infections. HRV was the most common infection and 25·3% (19/75) of these had a fever. In 28 cases of RSV, four (14·3%) had fever; 8·3% (1/12) of PIV and 30% (3/10) of influenza A cases had fever. Seven cases of coronavirus and hMPV each were confirmed and of those two (28·6%) had fever. When cases with influenza and a co-infection were included, 36·4% (8/22) had fever. In univariate analysis, country, gender and smoking were significant predictors of fever. Country and smoking remained significant predictors in multivariate analysis while gender became non-significant. Fever rate was significantly higher in HCWs in Vietnam compared to HCWs in China [RR 2·99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1·24-7·20]. Smokers were around five times more likely to have fever compared to non-smokers (RR 4·65, 95% CI 1·33-16·25). Virus type was not associated with fever in univariate analysis; however, after adjusting for other variables, rates of fever were significantly higher in HCWs co-infected with more than one virus compared to all other viruses excluding influenza (RR 4·19, 95% CI 1·21-14·52) ( Table 3) . CRI symptoms were present in 84·8% (137/158) of HCWs with laboratory-confirmed viral infections and 90·9% (20/22) laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. The corresponding rates of ILI in the two groups were 9·5% (15/158) and 13·6% (3/22), respectively.
