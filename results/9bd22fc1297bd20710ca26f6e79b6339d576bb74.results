SIVmac239 infection induces a higher risk of rapid disease progression in old compared with young ChRM. To explore the pathogenesis of acute HIV infection in elderly patients, we compared 6 young and 12 old Chinese rhesus macaques infected with SIVmac239 in the first 3 months after infection. Thirty-five days post-infection (dpi), 4 old macaques without the Mamu-B*03, Mamu-B*08 and Mamu-B*17 alleles gradually died of severe diarrhea and wasting disease even in spite of antibiotic treatment, whereas 4 young macaques lacking the protective MHC class I alleles remained alive during early infection ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary  Table S1 ). To determine whether this increased risk of death was associated with a high level of viremia, we monitored the plasma viral loads of all of the animals. Similarly to the 9.63 × 10 6 copies/ml plasma in the young animals, a mean peak viral load of 1.58 × 10 7 copies/ml plasma was found in the acute phase in the old ChRM (P = 0.6468). Throughout the infection, no significant differences in viral load were detected between the young and old groups (Fig. 1b) . However, the old macaques reached their peak earlier, at 10 or 14 dpi, compared with the delayed peak at 14 or 21 dpi in the young macaques (P = 0.0154) (Fig. 1c) . Furthermore, in contrast to the survivors, the macaques that died displayed a more robust viral replication as indicated by higher viral loads from 35 dpi to death ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Because chronic diarrhea induced by increased intestinal permeability occurred during the progression of SIV infection 24 , it is conceivable that old ChRM may have a higher risk of rapid progression of AIDS. CD4 + T cells are rapidly depleted in the peripheral blood of old ChRM after SIV infection. In order to accurately evaluate the differences between young and old ChRM during early SIV infection, we only analyzed the data from 6 young and 8 old animals that were still alive after 84 dpi. Before infection, old ChRM had a significantly lower number of CD4 + T cells (869.9 cells/μl) and a higher frequency of CCR5 + CD95 + CD4 + memory T cells (18.60%) than did young macaques (1069.0 cells/μl and 10.09%, respectively; P = 0.02 and 0.008, respectively). SIVmac239 infection induced a more dramatic decrease in the CD4 + T cell count (265.6 CD4 + T cells/μl) and CD4/CD8 ratio (0.36) in old ChRM compared with young macaques (468.1 cells/μl and 0.74; P = 0.0027 and 0.02, respectively) (Fig. 2a) . A CD4 + T cell count less than 500 cells/μl and a severe inversion of CD4/CD8 (<0.5) in the peripheral blood are believed to be associated with an increased risk of AIDS progression 25, 26 . We found that a higher frequency of old macaques were within these ranges, as compared with young animals after infection (Fig. 2b) . Moreover, compared with the young macaques, the old ChRM had a more pronounced and a more proportional reduction of CCR5 + CD4 + memory T cells relative to the pre-infection level. This result is further supported by a previous finding that SIVmac239 preferentially infects CCR5 + CD4 + memory T cells and induces the rapid depletion of CD4 + central memory T cells 27 (Fig. 2c) . B cells were depleted quickly and to a great extent both in young and old macaques during only the acute phase (Fig. 2d) . No statistically significant changes were detected in CD8 + T cells over time, although the old ChRM had more CD8 + T cells than did the young macaques ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ).
