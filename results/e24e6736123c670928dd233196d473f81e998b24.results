Genetic Aspects of Macrophage Susceptibility.--It was first necessary to see whether peritoneal macrophages from susceptible mice were susceptible. As has been briefly reported (5) we found the macrophages of the PRI strain of mice fully susceptible and those of the C3H resistant. (Figs. 1 to 4 .) A variety of tests and studies on possible variables in the in vitro systems were then undertaken and are reported in the latter part of the paper. Having once established a correlation between susceptibility of macrophage cultures and susceptibility of different breeds of mice, the susceptibility of cross and back-cross generations was studied. PRI and C3H mice were crossed and macrophage cultures from this F1 population were found to be susceptible to MHV virus infection (Table I) . F1 mice were then crossed with C~-I mice to yield the first back-cross generation (BC1); crossing the susceptible BCI progeny with CaI-I gave a second back-cross generation (BC2) and finally the susceptible BC2 were crossed again with CaI-I to give the third back-cross population (BCa). In this way the factor for susceptibility was introduced into the resistant C3H mouse strain. Segregation of the characters for susceptibility and resistance occurred in the first back-cross generation (BCx). Hybridization of PILl and CsI-I mice in all tests resulted in animals (F1) which yielded susceptible macrophages. Back-cross generation BCt produced both susceptible and resistant animals as determined by macroptmge susceptibility as did the BC~ and BC~ progeny of the susceptible back-crossed parents (Figs. 6 to 15). The data on the susceptibility of the back-cross generations are summarized in Table I . In another group of experiments resistant animals from the BC8 generation were crossed with those of both resistant and susceptible mice from the same BC8 generation, and macrophages were cultured from the progeny. The results are summarized in Table IL It was apparent that crossing resistant back-cross mice resulted in production of resistant cells, but crossing one susceptible and one resistant mouse yielded both types. While the above tests were carried out on the macrophages, other tests for susceptibility of the intact animal and of cultures were done. Including the peritoneal macrophage test, there were four in all: (a) direct test of mice which were infected with MHV virus as determined by mortality; (b) genetic performance of mice, i.e. a test of the susceptibility of offspring obtained by crossing with resistant C~-I mice; (c) susceptibility of macrophages from cultures of newborn mouse liver; and (d) susceptibility of peritoneal macrophage cultures from adult mice. These results are presented in Table III. As can be seen, there is a consistent agreement among these four methods of measuring susceptibility, with the exception of macrophages from progeny of one mouse of the BC~ generation, which produced six out of six resistant offspring. This result may have been due to chance, since over-all results would lead one to expect 2 of the 6 mice susceptible. The genetic performance (capacity to produce susceptible offspring) showed a higher per cent of mice with the gene for susceptibility than did the three direct tests for susceptibility. The genotype may then differ slightly from the phenotype. This problem will be discussed later. It is also possible that more than one gene is responsible for susceptibility or resistance and therefore less than 50 per cent of the animals of any particular back-cross generation would be susceptible. This aspect of the problem needs further exploration. It seems clear that the gene(s) responsible for susceptibility is dominant. Another way of testing the validity of methods for assessing susceptibility is to compare the phenotype, as tested by peritoneal macrophage susceptibility, with the genetic performance of the animal. This has been done for eight mice shown in Table IV . In one case, there is an exception (BCsc~ #13)--the same as included in Table III . The susceptible macrophage cultures from the PRI strain, the F1 generation, and all back-cross generations of mice were also tested for the presence of virus (Table V) . The cultures were infected with a 10 -2 dilution of virus, and after degeneration was completed, fluids were separated, diluted, and injected into PRI mice. An increase of virus occurred only in susceptible cells. Incubation with Call macrophages or without cells resulted in a decrease in the number of infective virus particles. This is not surprising since this virus is inactivated at 37°C. In all our experiments, both those with liver macrophages previously reported (3) and those with peritoneal macrophages, it was noted that degeneration of F1 and back-cross macrophage cultures occurred more slowly than in the case of PRI macrophages. PRI cultures were routinely destroyed in 2 or 3 days, whereas destruction of F1 and back-cross cultures occurred after 3 to 4 days. In a specific comparison, when PRI and F1 macrophage cultures were infected with the same virus preparation simultaneously, F1 cultures degenerated about 1 to 1N days later than PRI cultures. Factors Affecting in Vitro Susceptibility.--We found that the susceptibility of macrophage cultures did not depend on the age of the mice; this was tested in macrophage cultures from PRI mice ranging in age from 3 weeks to about 1 year. It was also found that susceptibility of macrophage cultures did not depend on the age of the culture. 2-to 3-day-old and 2-to 3-week-old cultures were fully susceptible to the virus. Old uninfected macrophage cultures, how- ever, contained increasing numbers of dead cells which were detected by a neutral red test. The titer of the virus suspension was always 1 or 2 log dilutions higher for PRI mice than for PRI macrophage cultures (Table VT) . On the other hand, C3H macrophage cultures were resistant to the virus infection. They survived infection without any visible effect if the virus suspension was diluted. In a number of cases undiluted virus preparations caused intense granulation of the macrophages which was usually followed by partial or complete destruction of these cultures. This was much slower than in the PRI macrophages. When, however, the undiluted virus was removed from the C3H cultures after a few hours' exposure (I, 4 and 24 hours), there was little or no destruction and only a little granulation (Table VII) . There is, therefore, a strong correlation between the susceptibility and resistance of PRI and C3H mice on the one hand and macrophage cultures from the same mice on the other. The destructive effect of undiluted virus on C3H cultures might be explained by a toxin. To test for this, the virus particles were inactivated with UV light 1 I General Electric sterile lamp, 15 watts, 1760 ergs/minute mm 2. by radiation at a distance of 42 cm for 5, 15, and 30 minutes. During exposure the virus suspensions were stirred and samples of virus removed. CsI-I and PRI cultures were then inoculated with irradiated and non-irradiated virus suspensions. Virus which bad been irradiated for 30 minutes had no effect on either type of cell (Table VIII) . Shorter irradiation times partially inactivated the virus for PRI cells and similarly reduced the effect of the virus on CJ-I cells. This suggests that the degeneration of CsI-I macrophage cultures resulted from an overwhelming concentration of virus, since the multiplicity of the ratio of virus to infected cells is about 10. Granulation was observed both in cultures inoculated with non-irradiated and irradiated viruses, but it decreased in the latter, was temporary, and was not accompanied by degeneration of cells. We suggest that this granulation in both situations was primarily due to phagocytosis of liver material in the undiluted virus suspension. Absorption.IThe question of the factors which might account for the resistance of CffI and the susceptibility of PRI macrophages was explored first by absorption studies. 106 and 5 X 106 macrophages were cultivated on glass or suspended in medium in siliconed vessels. Virus was added and the cultures were incubated 2 to 3 hours at 37°C, much longer than the time necessary to infect PRI macrophages. Fluid was then separated and the fiter of virus determined. No absorption was demonstrated, but the loss of virus in control tubes without cells was sufficient to obscure a differential absorption. In another group of experiments attempts were made to isolate infective nucleic acid from the virus using high concentrations of virus (LDs0 10 7 to 10 s) and the cold phenol extraction technique. Preparations were checked by UV absorption for the presence of nucleic acid; high concentrations were found. Separate groups of PRI and C3H mice were inoculated with these preparations, but no pathogenic effect was found. Macrophage cultures were exposed to the extract in standard medium without effect. Other cultures were placed in a saline medium and then exposed to the extract at 37°C for 3 hours, at which time the standard medium was replaced. Again, no effect. Blind passages from culture to culture and to mouse, and from mouse to mouse were also negative. Except for chicken macrophages, it is generally recognized that this cell type rarely multiplies in culture. Studies were therefore initiated with the mouse cultures to determine whether multiplication does take place. This may be demonstrated most easily by counting the number of cells at different times after inoculation. Two groups of C~H macrophage cultures and two groups of PRI cultures were cultivated for 10 and 20 days. After these periods of incubation 90 to 95 per cent of the cells were removed by trypsinization (0.85 per cent trypsin solution) and intense shaking and the numbers of macrophages determined (Table IX) . We found that the number of cells during the first 10 days decreased, indicating that some of the ceils had disintegrated. The number decreased slightly during the second 10 days. The macrophage cultures were examined for mitotic figures. In preparations stained by hematoxylin and eosin, a very few mitotic figures were found. These cultures, however, remained alive for a long time, showing excellent uptake of neutral red dye after 8 to 10 weeks of incubation. There was no difference between the rate of neutral red uptake of PRI and C~I-I macrophages. The conversion of resistant to susceptible ceils by exposure to an extract of the susceptible ceils has been briefly reported (3). This was originally attempted since both CffI and PRI macrophages phagocytize large amounts of material in vitro. Extracts from C3H (resistant) macrophages did not change the susceptibility of PRI (susceptible) macrophages, but C~-I macrophages exposed to extracts from PRI macrophages became susceptible. (Figs. 3 to 5.) Degeneration proceeded more slowly in these altered C3H cultures than in the infected PRI cultures. Altogether, 19 experiments have now been done. In some, the alteration to susceptibility was complete, in others partial, and in a few no effect was demonstrated (Table X) . In control experiments the influence of extracts from other animals (hamsters, chimpanzee, CsT black mice, DBA mice, other C~I-I mice), was studied, and none of these extracts was found to affect the susceptibility of C3H macrophage cultures to MHV infection. In order to test the permanency of the alteration produced by PRI extracts,
