In general, there were no differences between the PRRSVinfected animals that were ADV-immunized or those nonimmunized for fever, clinical signs, viral RNA load, PRRSV antibody levels, IFN-g secreting cells or frequency of immune cells in blood. Therefore, in the results section, no distinction was made for the described parameters between the immunized and non-immunized pigs.
