We applied our method for gene prioritization to six biological data sets of four positive-sense ssRNA viruses, HCV, DENV, CHIKV and SARS-CoV, and inferred potential pan-viral dependency and restriction factors. We then validated the highest ranked host factors. We first show results for normalization and integration of the RNAi data sets, then present the application of the procedure and a benchmark, and finally discuss the biological findings. The entire procedure is implemented in an R-package called perturbatr available on Bioconductor.
