A total of 3334 bat fecal samples were collected from various sites in 17 counties in Kenya between 2012 and 2015 ( Figure 1 ) and preserved in RNALater solution. We identified 8 virus families including; Astroviridae, Adenoviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Polyomaviridae and Reoviridae (Table 1) . We did not detect filoviruses in any of the samples. The Coastal region of Kenya had the richest diversity since all the 8 virus families were detected. Virus families CoVs, AstVs, ADVs and PMVs were most spatially distributed as they occurred in all the 5-former provincial regions. For the first time in Kenya, AstVs and CalVs were detected in bats, while new genotypes of RVA are reported in R. aegyptiacus and T. mauritianus. Table S2 ).
