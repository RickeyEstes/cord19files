Artibeus jamaicensis DPP4 receptor and cell susceptibility. The MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 is the main host restriction factor 34 ; therefore, we first studied the interaction between MERS-CoV and Jamaican fruit bat DPP4. The pAJ-DPP4 plasmid expressing the DPP4 coding sequence of Jamaican fruit bat under control of a CMV promoter was transfected into BHK cells, which are not permissive to MERS-CoV 34 . The expression of AJ-DPP4 in transfected cells was confirmed by flow cytometry, showing the presence of bat DPP4 on the surface of transfected BHK cells by determining the increase over untransfected cells ( Figure S1 ). Transient expression of bat DPP4 in BHK cells supported MERS-CoV replication, whereas transient expression of hamster DPP4 in BHK cells did not (Fig. 1A) . Subsequently, the replication kinetics of MERS-CoV were compared in LLC-MK2 cells (Macaca mulatta) and Jamaican fruit bat primary kidney cells. MERS-CoV replicated efficiently to high titers in both cell lines (Fig. 1B) , indicating that there is no restriction at the receptor or cellular level for MERS-CoV replication in Jamaican fruit bat cells. Clinical signs in bats inoculated with MERS-CoV. Ten adult Jamaican fruit bats were inoculated via the intranasal and intraperitoneal routes with 10 5 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012; 2 mock inoculated Jamaican fruit bats, housed in a separate cage, were used as controls, the mock inoculated animals were inoculated with tissue culture medium via the same routes and volumes. The bats were observed at least once daily for signs of disease. Bodyweight and temperature were measured throughout the experiment for a maximum of 28 days post inoculation (dpi) for bat 9 and 10 (MERS-CoV inoculated) and bat 11 and 12 (mock inoculated controls). None of the bats showed signs of disease, weight loss or increased body temperature throughout the experiment ( Figure S2 ).
