Pseudo-pseudoknots stimulate frameshifting, and frameshifting efficiency changes with the degree of pseudo-pseudoknot rotational freedom We previously showed in intact yeast cells that the pseudoknot containing mRNA produced from pJDRC was able to promote efficient À1 PRF, whereas one in which only a stem-loop can form, transcribed from pJD18, could not (23) . As a first step in this study, we tested the ability of synthetic mRNAs produced from pJD366-RC and from pJD366-18, two plasmids derived from these parental constructs, to promote À1 PRF. Total luciferase activities produced from these synthetic mRNAs were divided by the luciferase activity produced from the zero-frame control plasmid, pJD366-0, and multiplied by 100% to determine À1 PRF efficiencies. The results show that the trends observed in yeast were replicated in vitro, i.e. JD366-RC mRNA promoted $8% efficiency of À1 PRF as compared with $1.1% promoted by JD366-18 mRNA (Figure 2 ). The 'torsional restraint' model predicts that conditions that would inhibit the rotational freedom of the loop region of the pJD366-18-derived mRNA should result in enhanced À1 PRF efficiency. The strategy used in this study was to anneal this mRNA with synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to both the loop region and to the sequence downstream that is normally involved in pseudoknot formation. These 'pseudopseudoknots' would be predicted to restore a pseudoknot-like structure to the mRNA. This is diagrammed in Figure 3A . Two different classes of oligonucleotides having different orientations relative to the mRNA were used to this end: 'joining' (J-) and 'reverse' (R-) oligos. The orientation of the J-oligos promotes the formation of a structure containing the equivalent of a Loop 2 region, while that of the R-oligos promotes a Loop 1 equivalent. The model also predicts that pseudo-pseudoknots having different degrees of rotational freedom should promote different frequencies of ribosome pausing over the slippery site, resulting in different efficiencies of À1 PRF. In order to control this parameter, increasing numbers of nucleotides were inserted between the mRNA hybridizing regions of the J-and R-oligos. The additional non-complementary bases in the J-oligos are 3 0 to the stem-loop residues involved in Stem 2, thus effectively increasing Loop 2. Similarly, the additional non-complementary bases in the R-oligos are 5 0 to the loop acceptor residues and correspond to an increased Loop 1. The structure of the stem-loop of pJD366-18 and its maximum base-paired interactions with representative J-and R-oligos are shown in Figure 3B . To demonstrate that an oligonucleotide-mRNA hybrid was capable of forming under the assay conditions, the J1-oligo was incubated with 5 0 [ 32 P]labeled JD366-18 mRNA and subjected to RNaseH digestion. Digestion of the RNA-DNA hybrid resulted in a labeled 110 nt fragment, demonstrating that the oligonucleotide bound to the mRNA at the position of the pseudoknot (Figure 4) . Having demonstrated the utility of the in vitro frameshifting assay and that the J-and R-series of oligonucleotides were able to hybridize with synthetic mRNA produced from pJD366-18, the next step was to monitor frameshifting efficiencies promoted by these hybrid species. Significant increases in frameshifting were observed with the incubation of pJD366-18 mRNA with oligonucleotides J1 ($10%) and J2 ($35%), while only modest increases were seen with J3 and J4 ( Figure 5 ). These findings are consistent with the notion that changes in the degree of rotational freedom of the structure would affect the distribution of paused ribosomes in the vicinity of the slippery site. One potential complication with the J-oligos is the possibility that they could interact with the Loop 2-Stem 1 region. In the R-oligos, the additional bases are distal to any possible Loop 2-Stem 1 interactions and would be more analogous to increasing Loop 1. The R-oligos stimulated À1 PRF to an even higher extent than the J-oligos ( Figure 5 ). Importantly, increasing the length of the bridging regions in these oligonucleotides (R1 to R3), which is predicted to increase the rotational freedom of the stem-loop, resulted in decreased frameshifting activity as predicted by the torsional resistance model. However, addition of three residues between the two binding regions of the R-oligo (R4) resulted in an unexpected increase in frameshifting with a very large amount of variation.
