Among the 50 diarrhoeic faecal samples included in this study the N gene of BCoV was detected in 4 (8%) samples by RT-PCR The specificity of SN-PCR amplicons from the first and second amplification rounds of the BCoV Kakegawa strain and the clinical samples were confirmed by RFLP with the Hae III enzyme. The amplicons of 454 bp (first round) and 251 bp (second round) from SN-PCR yielded fragments of, respectively, 366 and 88 bp, and 163 and 88 bp (Fig. 2 ). In addition, these amplicons were sequenced and submitted to BLAST analysis. Both techniques confirm that the 454 and 251 bp amplicons were BCoV specific. 4) and BCoV specific primers (lanes 2 and 5) in single reaction, and in multiplex reaction (lanes 3 and 6). Panel B: Faecal sample from diarrhoeic (lanes 7 and 8, calf 15) and asymptomatic (lanes 9 and 10, calf 58) calves. Second round amplification in single reaction with BCoV specific primers (lanes 7 and 9) and in multiplex reaction with BCoV and internal control primers (lanes 8 and 10). The extracted RNA of the BCoV Kakegawa strain (HA titre: 256) was amplified by SN-PCR until 10 âˆ’7 dilution showing the sensitivity of the assay. No cross-reactivity was found when the SN-PCR was applied to faecal samples collected from calves with neonatal diarrhoea caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli, bovine group A rotavirus and Cryptosporidium sp. infections. No false positive or false negative results were observed in SN-PCR reactions with ultrapure sterile water or BCoV Kakegawa strain that were both included in all experiments. The internal control primers (BOV1 and BOV2) used in a multiplex reaction in the first amplification round of the SN-PCR, or separately in two reactions, yielded a specific 626 bp amplicon in all diarrhoeic faecal samples analyzed in this study (Fig. 3) .
