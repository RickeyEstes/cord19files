A human fetal microglia cell line, CHME5, transduced with HIV-1 vector displays enhanced survival Limited access of primary human microglia has been a major obstacle in studying the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the cell fate change of microglia induced by HIV-1 infection. In this study, we tested whether the human fetal microglial cell line, CHME5, displays the extended survival of microglia following HIV-1 infection as previously observed in an ex vivo setting with HIV-1 infected patient samples. 23 First, we attempted to validate the CHME5 cell line as a target cell type of M-tropic HIV-1 by examining whether CHME5 cells can support the replication of an M-tropic HIV-1 strain, YU-2, which was cloned from HIV-1 infected human brain tissue. 37 As shown in Figure 1 , the CHME5 cells were able to produce and amplify M-tropic virus during serial viral passages, and the efficiency of the HIV-1 production in this cell line was similar with that in primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). However, as expected, Figure 1 . M-tropic HIV-1 replicates efficiently in the CHME5 microglial cell line. A total of 1 × 10 6 CHME5 cells and human PBMCs were infected with M-tropic YU2 HIV-1 (2.5 × 10 5 pg of p24) and cultured for 12 days. As a control, T tropic NL4-3 HIV-1 (2.5 × 10 6 pg of p24) was also inoculated in the CHME5 cells. Viral supernatants were collected at 3, 6, 9 and 12 days post-infection and the p24 level in each viral sample was measured as described in Experimental Procedures . The SD value of the p24 level in each time point was within 5%. the CHME5 cells could not support the replication of a T-tropic HIV-1 strain, NL4-3, which is known to replicate in CD4+ T cells but not in macrophages and microglia. Indeed, the data shown in Figure 1 validate CHME5 cells as an M-tropic HIV-1 target cell. Next, we analyzed the survival capability of HIV-1 infected CHME5 cells in response to cellular insults. In order to visualize the infected CHME5 cells, we initially employed an HIV-1 pseudotyped vector expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) as well as all HIV-1 proteins except Env and Nef. 38 For a control, we used an HIV-1 transfer plasmid, pHR'-GFP, expressing eGFP under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. Unlike the HIV-1 vector system, this plasmid does not express any HIV-1 proteins, since it contains only the viral LTR and packaging site. 39 CHME5 cells were either transfected with the plasmid pHR'-GFP or transduced with the eGFP expressing HIV-1 vector (HIV-GFP) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Then 48 h later, cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce cell death. Since it has been reported that LPS-induced cell death in macrophage and microglia requires blockade of protein synthesis, 40 the cells were also treated with cycloheximide (CHX;10 μg/ml). Cells were then analyzed by the cytotoxicity/viability assay, which uses a combination of intracellular esterase activity (a characteristic of live cells, green) and binding of the ethidium homodimer to DNA (a marker for dead cells, red). Following HIV-1 vector transduction or lipofectamine-mediated plasmid transfection (for pHR'GFP), approximately 75% of the cells expressed GFP (green). As shown in Figure 2 (a), CHME5 cells that were either transfected with the GFP expressing plasmid (pHR'-GFP) or transduced with the HIV-1 GFP vector (HIV-GFP), did not undergo cell death in the absence of LPS/CHX (as shown by the lack of red or yellow cells in the merged fields). However, when cells transfected with pHR'GFP were treated with LPS/CHX, extensive cell death was induced (as shown by the red/yellow staining in the merged fields). In contrast, CHME5 cells transduced with pseudotyped HIV-1 (HIV-GFP) remained viable (no yellow staining in merged field) following treatment with LPS/CHX. Under these conditions, only the adjacent, untransduced cells lacking HIV-GFP expression underwent cell death (Figure 2(a) ). These data demonstrate that the HIV-1 vector transduced CHME5 cells, which express HIV-1 Gag, Pol, Tat, Rev, Vpr and Vif, have an extended survival phenotype. Next, we quantitated the extent of cell death in vector-transduced cultures following LPS/CHX treatment. CHME5 cells were transduced, resulting in greater than 95% transduction (as determined by GFP expression), then treated and analyzed for viability. The cultures were then treated with LPS/ CHX at 48 h post-transduction. The number of viable cells was quantitated by trypan blue exclusion assay at 24 and 96 h post-treatment. As shown in Figure 2 (b), the control CHME5 cells (incubated with heat-inactivated HIV GFP vector) showed significant cell death upon LPS/CHX treatment, whereas the CHME5 cells transduced with the HIV-1 vector (HIV-GFP) displayed greatly increased survival under similar conditions. Further quantification of the amount of cell death induced in CHME5 cells also confirmed that transduced cells (HIV-GFP vector) exhibited much less cell death (<4%) as compared with cells incubated with heatinactivated vector (∼25%). Importantly, as expected, we also found that the CHME5 cells infected with infectious M-tropic HIV-1 also showed the elevated survival capability as observed in the CHME5 cells transduced with the HIV-GFP vector (data not shown). These data demonstrate that HIV-1 infection in the microglial cell line induces a strong cytoprotective effect upon apoptotic challenge. Basically, due to difficulties and limited access in studying primary human microglia, the CHME5 system can serve as a model system, allowing us to investigate the cellular mechanism involved in the pro-survival effect of HIV-1 infection in primary human microglia.
