The h-rRT-PCR, carried out in thawed samples, was positive to Flu viruses in 46 (true positives) and negative in 3 out of the 49 previously positives. The C t (mean ± standard deviation) was 27.9 ± 4.23. The specificity and PPV of all tests was 100%. No false positive results were obtained by any method, and Flu types were correctly classified in all positive samples. Indeed, the 3 negative samples by h-rRT-PCR, previously positives in routine, were also negative with AL-Flu, SDB and SPX. Sensitivity and NPV of AL-Flu, SDB and SPX were 71.7% and 64.9%, 34.8% and 44.4%, and 100% and 100%, respectively (Table 1) . Table   1 Analytical The C t (mean ± standard deviation) of positive samples by AL-Flu and SDB were 26.21 ± 4.04 and 23.26 ± 2.16, respectively. The C t (mean ± standard deviation) of false negative samples by AL-Flu and SDB were 31.4 ± 1.81 and 29.45 ± 3.57, respectively. Significant differences in mean C t values between positive and negative samples by AL-Flu an SDB were observed (p < 0.001). A good agreement (k = 0.635) was observed between AL-Flu and SPX, whereas moderate (k = 0.499) and weak (k = 0.268) agreements were obtained comparing SDB with AL-Flu and SPX, respectively. Total turnaround time of AL-Flu, SDB and SPX was 13, 15 and 75 min, respectively.
