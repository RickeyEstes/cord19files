To understand disorder in viral proteins, we systematically surveyed predicted protein disorder across many viruses, looking for trends within and between families. We were particularly interested to determine if any of the variation in disorder could be accounted for, in whole or in part, by variation in genome size or by variation in base composition, or by other viral factors such as the type of host they have, or the basic viral type (DNA or RNA, single or double stranded). Since a number of alternative predictors appeared relatively well correlated (Table S4 , Fig S13, Results S1), and there was an apparent relationship between predicted and observed disorder for viral proteins (Table S6 , Results S1) we relied on IUPRED predictions of disorder for this survey. We also focused on predictions within proteins rather than within precursor polyproteins, noting that the overall survey results were very strongly correlated, regardless which way the analysis was completed (Fig S3) .
