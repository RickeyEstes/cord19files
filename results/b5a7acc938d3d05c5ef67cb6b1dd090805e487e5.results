Effects of icariin and p-icariin on liver pathology and the survival rate of ducklings exposed to DHV-1. The pathological changes in the liver are shown in Figure 1 . As shown in Table 1 , the survival rates in the BC, VC, icariin, and p-icariin groups were 100%, 0%, 20% and 30%, respectively. All of the ducklings in the VC group died within 96 h of exposure to DHV-1. The survival rate in the p-icariin group was significantly greater than that in the VC group (p < 0.05). However, the survival rate was not significantly different between the icariin and p-icariin groups. Figure 2 shows the plasma iNOS and MDA levels in each group at 8 and 54 h after exposure to DHV-1. The plasma iNOS level was not significantly different between each group. However, the MDA level was lower in the p-icariin group than in the VC and BC groups at 8 h. At 54 h, the iNOS and MDA levels were markedly higher in the VC group than in the other groups, but they were not significant different between the BC, icariin, and p-icariin groups. Figure 3 shows the plasma GSH-Px, SOD, and catalase levels in each group at 8 and 54 h. Plasma GSH-Px, SOD, and catalase levels were not significantly different among the four groups at 8 h. At 54 h, GSH-Px and catalase levels were significantly greater in the BC, icariin, and p-icariin groups than in the VC group, but were not significant different among the BC, icariin, and picariin groups. SOD level at 54 h was significantly greater in the BC and p-icariin groups than in the VC group, and was slightly greater in the icariin group than in the VC group. Table 2 shows the indices of liver injury in each group in the early (4 and 8 h) and the late (54 h) stages of infection. The serum ALT levels were consistently greater in the VC group than in the other groups at all times. At 4 and 8 h, there were no significant differences in ALT levels among the icariin, p-icariin, and BC groups. At 54 h, ALT levels were significantly greater in the icariin and p-icariin groups than in the BC group, but were not significantly different between the icariin and p-icariin groups.
