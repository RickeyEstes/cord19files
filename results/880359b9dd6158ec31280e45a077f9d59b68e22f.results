Overview of the outbreaks. Base A (Xiangyang) houses 1290 recruits, of whom 858 (66.5%) fell ill with ARD from December 10, 2012 to January 28, 2013 (Fig. 1) . Among the 858 cases, 321 (37.4%) were hospitalized, 108 (12.6%) developed acute pneumonia and 37 were considered severe cases. Base B (Jingmen) houses 865 recruits; 88 (10.2%) were diagnosed with ARD from February 11 to 27, 2013. Among the 88 cases, 42 (47.7%) were hospitalized, 16 (18.2%) with pneumonia and 4 severe cases were recorded. Under normal circumstances, these training facilities are not directly connected; this is primarily due to the geographic separation ( Figure S1 ) and self-contained management systems. The initial hypothesis was that these outbreaks were unrelated. The mean ages of the cases at the onset of illness were 19.7 and 20.1 years, respectively (Table S5 ). A small number of cases from both outbreaks had underlying medical conditions; the most common condition was allergy to antibiotics (6.1% & 8.0%). Analysis of clinical characteristics of the hospitalized Figure 1 . Cases of confirmed and probable HAdV-7 infections during the two outbreaks. A total of 946 persons were affected during the outbreaks. We collected 328 and 80 nasopharyngeal specimens from the two outbreak patients, respectively, and 323 HAdV-7 isolates were identified by PCR assays and viral culture. Scientific RepoRts | 5:13617 | DOi: 10 .1038/srep13617 cases from the two outbreaks showed very similar clinical features (Table 1) . A total of 36.2% and 38.1% of the hospitalized cases from the outbreaks showed acute pneumonia. Among the pneumonia cases, more than 50% had bilateral pneumonia, and 34.3% and 25.0% of them developed into severe cases, respectively. Hospitalized cases from the outbreaks also showed very similar clinical laboratory and radiologic findings, and abnormal findings such as abnormalities on chest radiograph and CT were commonly observed among the hospitalized cases from the outbreaks ( Table 2) . These abnormal manifestations may be indicators of multiorgan involvement among the cases 17 . Epidemiologic investigations of the outbreaks. Based on the similar demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, laboratory and radiographic findings, possible epidemiological associations that might link the outbreaks was explored. Preliminary investigations identified a 22-year-old male recruit (Index case A) who had ARD symptoms before reporting to Base A (Xiangyang) on December 6, 2012 (Fig. 2) . He arrived at the training base on December 10, 2012. During the next one month, he was treated in the clinic of Base A by empirical administration of roxithromycin, lincomycin, ceftriaxone and ribavirin, however his condition did not resolve and by January 10, 2013 had worsened to persistent high fever (39-39.9 °C) and shortness of breath. The case was admitted to Xiangyang affiliated hospital on January 11, 2013 where he was diagnosed as a severe pneumonia case with multiorgan damage. He had an elevated WBC count (12.5 × 10 9 cells/liter), creatine kinase (56867 U/liter), lactate dehydrogenase (348 U/liter), aspartate aminotransferase (687 U/liter), alanine aminotransferase (303 U/liter) and C-reactive protein (28.16 mg/liter), and decreased level of potassium (3.39 μ mol/liter). He was treated with additional antimicrobial and antiviral agents including azithromycin, levofloxacin, cefepime and ribavirin, and methylprednisolone was intravenously administered (range, 40-320 mg per day). Liver-protective and myocardial nutritional drugs were also prescribed. After 25 days of hospitalization the case made a full recovery. A serum sample collected on January 10, 2013 was positive for HAdV IgA, and a HAdV-7 isolate was identified from a nasopharyngeal sample collected on January 17, 2013 by PCR and viral culture, suggesting that the case had prolonged shedding of adenovirus (Fig. 2) . From December to January, this case was not quarantined at Base A, and he participated in normal training and educational activities including the training course opening ceremony on December 20, 2012. During this period, 9 recruits living in the same dormitory (9/12) with the index case successively showed ARD symptoms; HAdV-7 was detected in 7 (77.8%) by PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal samples. During our investigation, an observation that cases unable to be diagnosed and/or treated in the medical clinics associated with Base A and B were usually transferred to Xiangyang affiliated hospital was made. Importantly, while the outbreak was occurring at Base A, during which time > 300 cases were sent to the Xiangyang affiliated hospital in one month, a 19-year-old male recruit from base B (Jingmen) (Index case C) had been sent for treatment to Xiangyang affiliated hospital for lumbago and backpain on February 3, 2013 (Fig. 2) . Physicians did not strictly comply with infection control measures established by the hospital; primarily because of poor awareness of infection control for the inpatients. While Index case C was receiving treatment, he reported having two, half an hour conversations with an acquaintance from Base A (Index case B) who was hospitalized for ARD (Fig. 2) . After returning to Base B, Index Case C participated in routine training exercises but developed ARD on February 11, 2013. Infection with HAdV-7 was confirmed by PCR and subsequent DNA sequence analysis; five roommates of Index case C subsequently showed ARD symptoms.
