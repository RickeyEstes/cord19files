During the study period, Singapore Minimum and maximum temperature during the study period ranged from 22.8-27.6uC and 27.7-34.6uC, respectively. The highest weekly maximum temperature and lowest minimum temperature was recorded in 2005 and 2008 respectively. Overall, Singapore experienced temperature above 32uC in one-third of the study period with a total of 30 weeks in 2002 and about 6 weeks in 2008 (Figure 1) . A total of 30 weeks with temperature difference (Tp) above 7uC was observed in year 2005, and highest weekly Tp of 8.8uC was recorded in 2006 and 2008. The weekly cumulative rainfall during the study period ranged from 0-388 mm with higher amount of rainfall recorded between October and January. About 80% of the weekly cumulative rainfall was below 75 mm. The HFMD incidence was significantly associated with short term variability of weekly temperature difference (Tp), minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and cumulative rainfall at time lag of 1-2 weeks. Figure 2a depicts a wide J-shaped relationship between HFMD incidence and Tp with significant increase in the risk of HFMD incidence when Tp is above 7uC. Likewise, the risk of HFMD incidence rises steeply when maximum temperature is above 32uC; while low maximum temperature poses negligible effects on HFMD (Figure 2c ). Inverse relationship is observed between minimum temperature and HFMD incidence (Figure 2d ). Similar results are obtained when we test minimum and maximum temperature independently, except that minimum temperature is not statistically significant (Figure 2e & 2f) . Figure 2b indicates the relative risk of HFMD incidence increases linearly with weekly cumulative rainfall between 0-75 mm; whereas every unit increases beyond 75 mm reduces the risk of HFMD incidence. During the study period, Tp.7uC mainly coincided with maximum temperature above 32uC and low rainfall, except year 2008. In the piecewise linear Poisson regression function, we used breakpoints of 32uC for maximum temperature, 25uC for minimum temperature, 7uC for Tp, and 75 mm for rainfall. Table 1 shows every 1uC increases in maximum temperature above 32uC and in weekly Tp above 7uC elevates the risks of HFMD incidence significantly by 36% and 41%, respectively. The risk, however, declines by 17% with each degree increases in minimum temperature above 25uC. Additionally, a unit (mm) increases in weekly cumulative rainfall between 0-75 mm elevates risk of HFMD incidence by 0.3%. Observed and predicted time series of HFMD using both models produced similar results. Both model A and B explained about 87% of variations among HFMD cases using temperature, rainfall, and trend parameters. The residuals plots indicated model residuals did not violate the statistical modeling assumptions. Furthermore, the PACF showed no indication of further nonadjusted residual autocorrelation.
