The Microbial Rosetta Stone database was designed to link genomic sequence data, taxonomic classification, and epidemiological information in a way that facilitates searches and data updates. The intent is not to replace currently available tools, like those available from NCBI, but instead serve to resolve ambiguities and data conflicts. One of the main goals of building this informatics infrastructure was to support the rapid determination of the causative agent in the event of a bioterrorist action or emergence of a previously unknown infectious disease. The organisms listed in the Additional Files are represented according to phylogenetic hierarchy in the figures. The symbols used in the figures connect the organism names back to one or more of the Additional Files, which allows visualization of the fact that organisms are often represented in multiple Additional Files. Figure 1 is the symbols key. Figures 2 and 3 show the phylogenetic relationships of cellular life forms including bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and the plants and animals that produce toxins, Figure 4 shows the phylogenetic relationships of DNA viruses, and Figures 5, 6, and 7 show the phylogenetic relationships of RNA viruses. For optimal utility, the genomic sequence data, taxonomic, and epidemiological information were linked in a way that facilitates searches, data updates, and data curation. The Microbial Rosetta Stone system will serve as a translator to resolve ambiguities and data conflicts between other public databases and literature and, when unable to resolve ambiguities, provide enough context for users understand the nature of the ambiguities. The database provides links to literature on experimental protocols for pathogen identification and to the genomic and biochemical information specific to a species, strain, or isolate. The data model and query tools are described in detail in Hari et al. [1] . The following sections describe the information and literature sources used to populate in the database for globally important and emerging pathogens and potential bioterrorist agents.
