Coverage of issues surrounding Hendra virus and flying fox populations in the media sample more than doubled in 2008, then plateaued before rising sharply in 2011 (Table 1 ). This two-phase pattern can be attributed to the tragic deaths from Hendra virus of the veterinarians Ben Cuneen [2008] and Alister Rodgers [2009] ) Report on debate about flying fox control does mention Hendra virus 0 6 (3.6) 13 (7.7) 9 (5.5) 90 (20.5) Report suggests that people's welfare is not high enough on the political agenda 4 (9.1) 6 (3.6) 8 (4.7) 6 (3.7) 47 (10.1) Report suggests that 'government' inaction is contributing to the problem 3 (6.8) 5 (3.0) 1 (0.6) 9 (5.5) 38 (8.6) during the one or two outbreaks that occurred in each of these years; and to the unprecedented number and geographic spread of Hendra events in 2011. Table 1 shows the results of cross coding for types of content and the frequency with which specific constellations of information appear each year in the media sources sampled.
