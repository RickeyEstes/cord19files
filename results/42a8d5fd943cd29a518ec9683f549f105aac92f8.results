A total of 578 primary school boys aged 6 to 8 years in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were analyzed in this study. The prevalence of dental caries in our sample was 83% (95% CI 79.7-86.0%). About 17% (95% CI 14.0-20.3%) of children had no carious lesions. The age-specific prevalence of dental caries among children aged 6, 7, and 8 years was 87.6% (95% CI 82.4-91.6%), 72.9% (95% CI 65.9-79.1%), and 88.4% (95% CI 82.7-92.8%), respectively. The mean age and dmft score in our sample was 6.92 (SD ± 0.82) and 4.20 (SD ± 2.96), respectively. Table 1 provides the frequencies, percentages, and differences (by caries status) for various characteristics of study population. A significant number of fathers (65.7%, 95% CI 61.7-69.6%) and mothers (73.9%, 95% CI 70.1-77.4%) did not attend a college or university, and their children experienced high prevalence of dental caries. Majority of the children came from low-income families (59.7%, 95% CI 55.6-63.7%), and approximately 99% of them experienced dental caries. Most of the study subjects lived in rental homes, and 77% had no dental coverage in medical insurance. In general, the children had poor oral health behavior and practices as most of them started brushing at a late age (5 or more years) and brushed less than once daily (55%) in any given week. The use of dental floss and mouthwash was negligible, and most of the children visited a dentist for symptomatic treatment. Although the practice of breast feeding is common, most of the children were weaned by the first year. The practice of mixed feeding was common in our sample; approximately 81% of mixed-fed children experienced dental caries compared to 93% of children that were exclusively fed with either breast milk or powdered milk. The practice of sleeping with a bottle in mouth and frequent consumption of sugary snacks between meals was also common. The consumption of fresh fruits and fresh juice was less prevalent in our sample. The summary of variables selected during different steps of selection process is illustrated in Table 2 . Barring few exceptions, almost all the factors were significantly associated with dental caries' experience in univariate analyses (step 1). In the ensuing step 2 multivariate analysis, a limited number of factors were associated with dental caries in each of the four risk domains with more concessions observed among dietary factors. In the final step of model selection, the highly collinear child feeding covariate (i.e., age of the child when breast feeding was stopped) was excluded to address multicollinearity. Our model selection process yielded 12 variables that were significant at p < 0.05 for inclusion in the final model. Although association measures were not provided in Table 2 to avoid confusion, interested readers could find these details in Additional file 1. The unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios along with their 95% confidence intervals (based on Firth's bias correction) for the variables, representing all four risk domains, in the final model are reported in Table 3 . It should be noted that factors representing low socioeconomic status, such as low level of maternal education, low family income, and lack of dental insurance, were associated with a minimum of fourfold increased dental caries experience. Child oral health practices, such as failure to brush teeth at least once a day, failure to start brushing on or before a child attained 2 years of age, and visiting dentist for symptomatic treatment, were associated with dental caries experience in children. Children habituated to sleeping with bottle in mouth experienced 4.4-fold higher dental caries compared to children not practicing this habit (aOR = 4.4, 95% CI 1. 4-13.4 ). In addition, lack of mixed feeding and consuming two or more sugary snack items between meals were predominantly associated with dental caries experience (p < 0.05). Dietary habits, such as less consumption of fresh fruits and frequent consumption of soft drinks and flavored milk, were significantly associated with dental caries with an odds ratio of 11.6, 5.3, and 7.7, respectively. The final model was well calibrated (p = 0.7667; Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test) with very high discriminatory power (c-statistic = 99%) and high overall performance (adjusted R-square of 88%). Subsequent exclusion of three variables representing socioeconomic status from the final model also resulted in a well-calibrated model (p = 0.3502; Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test) with very high discriminatory power (c-statistic = 98%). However, a slight reduction in overall performance from 88 to 80% was noted, signifying the influence of individual or personal factors (represented in the remaining three risk domains) on dental caries experience in children; the overall performance of model with variables representing socioeconomic status was 59%. In addition, the higher magnitude of adjusted odds ratios of individual factors (ranging from 4.4 to 38.4) compared to aORs of socioeconomic factors (ranging from 4.2 to 28.2) and the lower confidence limits that were consistently above 1.5 lend further support to the predominant  Flavored milk X X X *The variables selected in the step were marked with an "X," and variable excluded is marked as "-."
