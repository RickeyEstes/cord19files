For all 125,250 pairs of Pfam proteins (X, Y) and all three reading frames considered here, we used our search algorithm to find homologous sequences (X′, Y′) that are coded by two fully overlapping DNA sequences, with the shorter protein's coding sequence completely embedded in the longer one's. The similarity of the computed homologs to natural sequences from the same family as X or Y was characterized by their Blast E-values versus the Swissprot sequence collection. For each pair and reading frame, we made two predictions, corresponding to two different positions of the X′ 5′-terminus relative to Y′, for a total of 751,500 predictions. Blast hits were only counted if the match lengths represented at least 85% of the total sequence length. The fractions of pairs with low E-values are reported in Table 1 . Histograms of E p values are shown in Fig. 4 . Summing over all three reading frames, we obtained an E p (X′, Y′) value of 10 −10 or better for 20,502 pairs, representing 16.3% of all pairs. For 12,162 pairs (9.7%) the E p (X′, Y′) value was 10 −15 or better. For pairs of non-viral proteins, the success rate (E p (X′, Y′) value of 10 −10 or better) was 14.1%. For pairs of viral proteins, it was especially high: 51.6%. None of the viral pairs were naturally-existing pairs. For viral/non-viral pairs, it was 26%. The success rate was best in the F = −2 frame and poorest in the F = 0 frame (7.4% of pairs with −log E p > 10), which both correspond to sense/antisense overlap. This was expected, given the structure of the genetic code and the relative importance of the central and wobble codon bases (see below). For the F = 1 sense:sense overlap scheme, the success rate was intermediate: 13.5% of pairs had −log E p > 10. Similar results were obtained from Superfamily searches. Of the 500 Pfam domains considered here, 183 were recognized by Superfamily as similar to a SCOP family. We considered the protein pairs (X, Y) where the shorter of the two, say X, is among these 183 domains, and where the predicted homolog pair (X′, Y′) has a low E p value. We submitted each homolog X′ to Superfamily. Notice that we only considered the shorter protein, since the longer protein Y has non-overlapping amino acids that make it easier to recognize. Thus, X′ represents a more stringent test. For all three reading frames, over 83% of the homologs X′ were correctly recognized by Superfamily, further supporting their similarity to natural sequences. 24 predictions corresponded to E p values better than 10 −38 . Three of the pairs were (X, X) "self " pairs involving three bacterial proteins (Pfam families PF04379, PF20806, PF14173). Three were (X, Y) pairs involving bacterial −log(E p ) range pair type a total number of pairs Percentage of successful pairs overlap scheme The F = −2 sense:antisense overlap scheme was the most favorable above, although F = 1 and F = 0 also gave many hits. In prokaryotic genomes, a slight preference for F = −2 was noted in surviving overlapping genes. Indeed, the coding properties of this scheme are especially favorable, and we analyze them briefly here. In this frame, each X′ codon has its middle nucleotide in register with a Y′ wobble nucleotide, and vice versa. Since the wobble nucleotide has little effect on the coded amino acid, this allows the middle nucleotide of each X′ and Y′ codon to be chosen almost freely. Figure 6 shows two sense/antisense codons that share their first bases. We denote them  and . We denote the sense nucleotides 1, 2, 3 and the antisense nucleotides 1′, 2′, 3′. The possible amino acid choices for  and  are listed in Table 2 . If we classify the 20 amino acid types into four classes: Π = (large, polar), Φ = (large, nonpolar), π = (small, polar), ϕ = (small, nonpolar), with four choices of class on each strand, there are 16 possible / S A combinations. Despite the base-pairing constraint, 15 of them can be encoded freely in this overlap scheme. Only the combination (π, π) cannot be encoded unambiguously. In contrast, the F = 0 frame (central bases opposite) can only encode 26 of 20 × 20 possible pairs of amino acid types. To identify sequence properties that favor gene overlap, we characterized the 50 Pfam proteins that were most "successful," participating most frequently in high scoring dual genes in the F = −2 frame (ones where the designed homologs had E p < 10 −15 ), as well as the 20 most successful viral proteins. We compared them to 142 "unsuccessful" Pfam proteins that gave no hits (all E p values > 10 −2 ). We repeated the analysis for the F = 0 and F = 1 frames. The F = −2 and F = 1 "successful" sets shared 43 proteins out of 50, so we only present the F = −2 and F = 0 sets. Tables 3 and 4 and Fig. 7 summarize the results. The "successful" proteins are slightly longer on average and the corresponding Pfam families are slightly less diverse, especially for the viral set (F = −2 scheme), with a mean entropy of 1.4, vs. 2.5 for the unsuccessful set ( Table 3 ). The mean codon degeneracy and Differences in codon usage are more striking, especially when comparing the most successful viral proteins (F = −2 scheme) to the least successful Pfam proteins (Fig. 7) . In contrast, in the F = 0 scheme (which gave fewer successful designs), the successful/unsuccessful differences are much smaller, with only six codon frequencies shifted by just over 0.005.

Sense/antisense amino acid (aa) types for overlapping codons, F = −2 reading frame. The relation between the sense/antisense overlapping codons and the nucleotide numbers are defined in Fig. 6 . ( Fig. 7 , right), many of the viral trends are confirmed, even though this set contains just 13 viral proteins out of 50. Thus, there are codon choices that are more favorable for dual genes, and the corresponding trends are especially visible in the most successful viral proteins. Finally, given the high success rate for dual gene design and the generality of our algorithm, we used it (with slight adjustments) to design 200 triple genes, with three proteins X, Y, Z coded in a fully-overlapping manner. Taking X as the reference, we chose to code Y on the antisense strand in the F = −2 frame and Z on the sense strand in the F = 1 frame. We tested 20,000 triplets where the corresponding pairs gave high-scoring dual genes. This led to a high success rate: more than 60% of the triplets gave −log E p > 10. We obtained 200 triplets where all three E-values (X′, Y′, Z' vs. X, Y, Z, respectively) were better than 10 −20 . Of these, 62 were triplets of non-viral proteins, 30 were triplets of viral proteins, and 40 involved one viral and two non-viral proteins. The DNA and protein sequences for one triplet are shown in Fig. 5 . X is bovine, Y is viral, and Z is a bovine tick protein. The E-values vs. Swissprot for the predicted homologs X′, Y′, and Z' were, respectively, 10 −24 , 10 −23 , and 10 −23 .
