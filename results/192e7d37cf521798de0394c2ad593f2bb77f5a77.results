152 questionnaires among 195 ones under gone analysis. Forty three questionnaires were having imperfect, and unreadable response -so response rate was 77.9%. Table 1 , shows the characteristics of the participants. As the table shows, the majority of participants were female (94.7%) with less than 10 years (84.9%) of work experience. The most prevalent cause of anxiety was contact with infected biological factors (23% of nurses). The less important cause was concern about retirement (42.8% of nurses). Table 3 shows association between socio-demographic variables with nurse's anxiety. As the table show, there is a significant difference in anxiety between male and female participants. Anxiety level was significantly higher in female, than male (P=0.04). Vol. 5, No. 6; 2013 206 In examining the correlation between obvious anxiety with age it was shown that, with increasing age, obvious and hidden anxiety decrease significantly in nurses (ρ=-0.2, P=0.03, and ρ=-0.8, P=0.02, respectively). Also, there was a significant reverse correlation between BMI and obvious anxiety. Thus, with increasing BMI, obvious anxiety decreases in nursing cadre (ρ=-0.6, P=0.04). There were no correlation between experience at work, income and level of education with obvious and hidden anxiety.
