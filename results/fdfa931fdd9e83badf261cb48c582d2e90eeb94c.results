We enrolled 603 patients in 11 participating hospitals from April, 2001, to September, 2004. In hospitals where screening logs were available, we estimated that about 3Â·5% of acute stroke patients were eligible as per the study protocol. Common barriers for recruitment included late presentation, refusal, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. Four patients did not receive any trial medications and thus no data were recorded: two withdrew consent and two were ineligible due to presence of exclusion criteria (fi gure 1). 246 patients who were randomised (125 LWMH, 121 aspirin) were excluded from the primary analysis according to the protocol after vascular imaging investigations did not show any LAOD (15 with vascular imaging done before randomisation, 226 patients with vascular imaging done after randomisation) or because no vascular imaging could be done (n=5). Our primary study population comprised the 353 patients with confi rmed LAOD: 164 patients with vascular imaging done before randomisation and 189 patients with vascular imaging done after randomisation. The location of LAOD was solely intracranial in 300 (86%) patients, solely extracranial in 11 (3%), and both intracranial and extracranial in 42 (12%). All patients underwent transcranial doppler examination, 46% underwent carotid duplex doppler examination, and less than 1% underwent magnetic resonance angiography. The baseline clinical and stroke characteristics of patients and baseline variables between the two groups were similar (table 1), although there were slightly more patients with diabetes mellitus in the aspirin group. In the primary outcome analysis at 6 months, the proportion of patients with good outcomes (Barthel index
