The study cohort comprised 1520 patients; 720 (47.4%) were male and of median age 26 years (interquartile range 9-44.4), of whom 480 (31.6%) were children aged ,16 years. Asthma was the commonest comorbid illness, present in 385 (25.3%) patients. Patients with asthma were more likely to be on regular inhaled corticosteroids than patients without asthma (52.7% versus 4.5%). Tables 1 and 2 compare the demographic, clinical and treatment/management characteristics of asthmatic and nonasthmatic patients. Patients with asthma were significantly less likely to die or require intensive care support while in hospital compared with nonasthmatics (11.2% versus 19.8%; OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36-0.72). Conversely, asthmatics were significantly more likely than nonasthmatics to exhibit features of severe respiratory compromise at the time of hospital admission, meeting the following triage criteria: severe respiratory distress, oxygen saturation f92%, respiratory exhaustion and severe clinical dehydration or clinical shock (table 1). Consistent with these findings, asthmatics reported significantly more dyspnoea at the time of admission (58.4% versus 30.8%; unadjusted OR 3.15, 95% CI 2.48-4.0) and were significantly more likely to receive supplemental oxygen (36.4% versus 26%; unadjusted OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.27-2.08). These differences were similar when children and adults were analysed separately (online supplementary tables B and C). There was no significant difference in the proportions of asthmatic patients with pneumonia compared with nonasthmatics (asthma 17.1% versus 16.6%; OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.77-1.42). As asthmatics were more likely to have a chest radiograph performed on admission (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.17-2.11; p50.003), sensitivity analysis investigating the association between pneumonia and asthma including only patients with a definite chest radiograph record was performed; no significant difference between asthmatics and nonasthmatics was found (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62-1.18; p50.329). Antivirals (319 (82.9%) out of 385 cases using oseltamivir and nine (2.3%) out of 385 cases using zanamivir), antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids were prescribed upon hospital admission in significantly more patients with asthma compared with nonasthmatics (table 2) . Data relating to the time to admission from symptom onset were available for 1083 (71.3%) patients in the study cohort. Of these patients, those with asthma were significantly more likely to be admitted to hospital within 4 days of symptom onset compared with nonasthmatics (254 (65.2%) out of 385 versus 602 (53.0%) out of 1135; OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.04-2.07). Median (interquartile range) time from symptom onset to Post-hoc analysis of asthmatics on pre-admission inhaled corticosteroids compared with asthmatics not on pre-admission inhaled corticosteroids did not demonstrate any significant differences between the two groups in relation to the
