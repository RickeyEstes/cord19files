The estimates for the model parameters are given in Table 2 along with their respective p-values for the t-tests used to determine whether each parameter is significantly different from zero (statistical details relating to p-values obtained here are also given in the supplementary Information). The infections by the previously quarantined persons J n and hospitalized patients H n (g and Z) were determined by the model to be not significantly different from zero when compared with the infection during infective stages I n and hence omitted from Table 2 . We proceed to describe the important epidemiological parameters and results which we can deduce from the estimation.
