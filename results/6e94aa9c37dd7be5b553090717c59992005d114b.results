Transcriptome comparison between microglia and astrocytes following TLR7 activation To directly compare how innate immune activation altered the gene expression profile in astrocytes and microglia, we used primary cultures of both cells types generated from neonatal mice. For TLR7 stimulation, we used 5 uM imiquimod for stimulation as this has previously shown TLR7-specific stimulation in both cell types [20] . Six hours was chosen as the optimal time point for analysis based on previous PCR array data that showed optimal induction of immune response genes at this time point post stimulation [20] . Analysis of microarray data indicated a total of 293 genes with altered mRNA expression in microglia and/or astrocytes following TLR7 stimulation, with 169 genes significantly upregulated by at least two-fold and 60 genes that were down-regulated (Fig 1) . Surprisingly, only 49 of the 293 genes were common to both microglia and astrocytes (Figs 1-2 ). Of the common upregulated genes, 10 of the top 20 were proinflammatory cytokines (Fig 2, shaded gray genes) correlating with the strong cytokine production associated with both cell types following TLR activation [20] . Only five genes had mRNA expression down-regulated in both astrocytes and microglia following TLR7 stimulation, including Rasgrp3, whose protein functions to inhibit TLR responses in macrophages [34] .
