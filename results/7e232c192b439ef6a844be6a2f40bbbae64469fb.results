Targeting antigen to DCs induces humoral immunity. We first compared the OVA-specific humoral immune response after immunization with either α DEC-205/OVA adjuvanted with Poly(I:C) and CpG (α DEC-205/OVA + Poly(I:C)/CpG; for simplification termed α DEC-205/OVA), BPPcysOVAMPEG or, in addition to the two DC targeting approaches, BPPcysMPEG co-administered together with soluble OVA (OVA + BPPcysMPEG). As controls we included α DEC-205 and OVA alone, both adjuvanted with Poly(I:C) and CpG as well as BPPcysMPEG alone, OVA peptides alone, and OVA peptides adjuvanted with BPPcysMPEG. Already after two vaccinations with α DEC-205/OVA, we observed a strong OVA-specific IgG response ( Fig. 1A ) that was significantly increased in comparison to both the OVA + BPPcysMPEG and the OVA + Poly(I:C)/CpG groups at this time (Fig. 1B ). Mice vaccinated with the novel antigen targeting system BPPcysOVAMPEG initially exhibited a weaker IgG response, which was however strongly enhanced following the third boost ( Fig. 1A,C) . We next compared OVA-specific IgG 1 and IgG 2c titres which represent the main IgG isotypes stimulated by Th2 and Th1 cells, respectively 26 . Vaccination with either α DEC-205/OVA, OVA + Poly(I:C)/CpG or BPPcysOVAMPEG induced a rather balanced IgG 1 /IgG 2c ratio, whereas OVA + BPPcysMPEG induced substantially higher IgG 1 than IgG 2c titres, pointing towards a more Th2-dominated immune response (Fig. 1D ). As expected, neither the injection of the adjuvant BPPcysMPEG alone, nor the vaccination with the immunodominant CD4 + and CD8 + OVA peptides without adjuvant did induce humoral immunity. Moreover, peptide targeting to DCs by means of vaccination with BPPcysOVAMPEG was superior in inducing antibody responses than vaccination with soluble peptides adjuvanted with BPPcysMPEG ( Supplementary Fig. S1A -C). Induction of CTLs following αDEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG immunization. To further characterize the type of T cell response induced with the different vaccine formulations, OVA-specific IL-4-and IFNγ -secreting T cells were evaluated by ex vivo stimulation of splenocytes from immunized mice with the dominant OVA MHC-I and -II peptides. As expected, due to the exclusive selection towards these epitopes when immunizing with BPPcysOVAMPEG, the highest number of cytokine producing T cells was observed in this group ( Fig. 2A-C) . BPPcysOVAMPEG vaccination induced increased numbers of IL-4-producing Th2 cells compared to the α DEC-205/OVA and OVA + Poly(I:C)/CpG immunized groups ( Fig. 2A) . Compared to the vaccine formulations lacking direct antigen targeting to DCs, BPPcysOVAMPEG, and to a lesser extent α DEC-205/OVA immunization, at the same time showed the strongest potential to induce IFNγ -producing T cells (Fig. 2B,C) . Of note, the adjuvant BPPcysMPEG alone or vaccination with non-adjuvanted immunodominant OVA peptides did not induce IFNγ -producing T cells. Furthermore, peptide targeting to DCs using the BPPcyOVAMPEG formulation induced significantly more IFNγ -producing T cells than vaccination of mice using peptides adjuvanted with BPPcysMPEG ( Supplementary Fig. S1D -G). Since IFNγ -producing CTLs are important for virus clearance from the liver 27 , we evaluated OVA-specific CTL activity in vaccinated mice. Immunization with α DEC-205/OVA or BPPcysOVAMPEG induced a robust Scientific RepoRts | 7:43985 | DOI: 10.1038/srep43985 OVA-specific CTL response already after the first immunization (Fig. 2D) . Despite the fact that IFNγ -producing CD8 + T cells were also induced in OVA + BPPcysMPEG immunized mice (Fig. 2C ) no lysis of target cells was detectable in this group (Fig. 2D) . Thus, while antigen delivery to DCs by targeting DEC-205 resulted in a rather weak and balanced Th1 (IFNγ ) and Th2 (IL-4) cell response, it was highly effective in generating antigen-specific CTLs. Similarly, BPPcysOVAMPEG-mediated antigen targeting to TLR2/6 induced balanced Th1/Th2 T helper and robust OVA-specific CTL responses. Targeted antigen delivery to DCs induces IFNγ-producing memory CD8 + T cells in the liver. To test whether CTLs induced by antigen delivery to DCs can effectively recognize and eliminate virus infected hepatocytes, a hepatotropic adenovirus challenge model was utilized (Fig. 3A) . Immunized mice were infected with a recombinant adenovirus (AdOVA-GFP-luc) leading to the MHC-I presentation of the OVA CD8 257-264 peptide on infected hepatocytes. Furthermore, AdOVA-GFP-luc infected cells express EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) and luciferase, allowing the quantification of the infection (Fig. 3A) 28 .

The release of IFNγ by CTLs has been shown to mediate non-cytolytic clearance of infected hepatocytes and IFNγ per se directly inhibits viral replication in the liver 29, 30 . While hardly any IFNγ production was detectable in the hepatic CD44 -CD8 + T cells (Fig. 3C) , the AdOVA-GFP-luc challenge resulted in a nearly two-fold increase of the proportion of IFNγ -producing CD44 high CD8 + T cells in the OVA + BPPcysMPEG (11.3%) and Presence of IFNγ + CD44 high CD8 + effector T cells in the liver correlates with hepatitis development following AdOVA-GFP-luc challenge. We next asked whether the IFNγ -producing effector memory CD8 + T cells in the liver would respond to virus-expressed antigen on hepatocytes. While Ad-GFP-luc control infection induced only marginal hepatocellular cell death or cellular infiltrations (Fig. 4A) , infection of all OVA-immunized groups with AdOVA-GFP-luc led to drastic histological lesions in the liver, hepatocellular cell death and marked infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages into the tissue (Fig. 4A -C). Since histological scoring revealed a trend towards an enhanced immunopathology in the liver of α DEC-205/OVA immunized and AdOVA-GFP-luc infected mice compared to the BPPcysOVAMPEG group, we further elucidated whether α DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG vaccination would result in distinct immune cell recruitment following viral infection. However, automated multidimensional fluorescent microscopy (MELC) on liver sections revealed no significant differences in the hepatic composition of leukocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, B cells and T cell subsets among the groups (Fig. 5A ,B and Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Altogether, the observed type of immunopathology in α DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG immunized mice was indicative for acute hepatitis as a consequence of the immune-mediated clearance of virus infected hepatocytes suggesting that antigen-specific CTLs present in the liver following vaccination accounted for the hepatocyte damage. Vaccination with αDEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG results in effective antigen-specific virus clearance in the liver. To further substantiate the cytolytic function of CTLs, serum concentrations of alanine transaminase (ALT) were determined in vaccinated and adenovirus-challenged animals. As expected, infection with the Ad-GFP-luc control virus did not affect serum ALT levels in any of the experimental groups (Fig. 6A) . Strikingly, in α DEC-205/OVA as well as in BPPcysOVAMPEG immunized mice we observed a dramatic and comparably high increase of the serum ALT level (~950 U/l and ~770 U/I, respectively) indicating massive CTL-mediated killing of AdOVA-GFP-luc infected hepatocytes (Fig. 6A ). Significantly lower ALT concentrations (~330 U/l) were measured in OVA + BPPcysMPEG immunized mice which is in line with lower abundance of IFNγ -producing memory CD8 + T cells (Fig. 3) . To further confirm specific killing of AdOVA-GFP-luc infected hepatocytes, virus clearance was examined by assessing luciferase expression in liver tissue. As expected, strong luciferase activity was detectable in the liver of all mice infected with the control Ad-GFP-luc virus (Fig. 6B ). In contrast, luciferase activity in the livers of immunized and AdOVA-GFP-luc infected mice was significantly reduced in α DEC-205/OVA and BPPcysOVAMPEG vaccinated mice in comparison to both OVA + BPPcysMPEG and α DEC-205 + Poly(I:C)/CpG mock-immunized animals (Fig. 6B ). Taken together, our results clearly demonstrated that antigen targeting to cross-presenting DCs by either α DEC-205/OVA or BPPcysOVAMPEG is highly effective at inducing effector T cells capable of recognizing and eliminating virus infected hepatocytes.
