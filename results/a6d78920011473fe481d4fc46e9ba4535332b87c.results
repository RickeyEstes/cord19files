Development of a high-resolution PreDicta microarray. Figure 1 shows the arrangement of RV-derived proteins, peptides as well as control proteins on the PreDicta chip and the selection procedure for the N-terminal VP1 peptides. Recombinant capsid proteins (VP1-VP4) and fragments thereof representing RV-A, B, C species as well as non-structural proteins from RV89 were included (Supplementary Tables 1-3) . Based on our previous finding that antibodies from RV-infected patients react preferentially with the N-terminus of VP1 (ref. 33 ), we included synthetic N-terminal VP1 peptides from 30 RV strains which were selected in a rational, multistep process to represent distinct RV strains (Fig. 1a , Supplementary Table 2) . Starting with 107 VP1 sequences retrieved from the NCBI database (RV-A: 76; RV-B: 25; RV-C: 6), multiple sequence alignments were performed to identify clusters of peptides with high degrees of sequence identities (Fig. 1a , Supplementary Table 2 : Clusters A1-A17; B1-B9; C1-C3). In a next step, peptides were re-clustered into groups taking the chemical properties of amino acids into consideration (Supplementary Table 2 : AI-AXVIII; BI-BIX; CI-CIII). From these groups 30 peptides with the most distantly related sequences were selected (Fig. 1b, c; Supplementary Tables 2 and  3 ). For a further refinement of VP1, VP2, and VP3 antibody responses, VP2 and VP3 fragments as well as peptides spanning the complete VP1 sequence from RV89 were included (Fig. 1d , Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 ). For control and calibration purposes we added recombinant allergens and control proteins (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Table 6 ) to the PreDicta chip. Proteins and peptides were spotted in triplicates on a preactivated glass slide containing six microarrays surrounded by a Teflon frame so that one chip allows testing of six serum samples (Fig. 1d) . Identities and purities of recombinant proteins and peptides were tested by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, western-blotting, and by mass spectrometry, respectively (Supplementary Tables 3-5 , Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Supplementary Table 7 shows that the PreDicta microarray allows reproducible measurement of IgG levels to the antigens according to intra-and inter-assay variations. RV strain recognition is broader in older wheezing children. The PreDicta chip was tested with sera from 120 pre-school children who were admitted to the hospital due to an acute wheezing episode 35 . Table 1 summarizes demographic and clinical data of the children investigated in this study. To investigate if the spectrum of recognized RV peptides varies by age, children were grouped according to age (Group I: <1 year, n = 35; Group II: 1-2 years, n = 53; Group III: >2 years, n = 32). Figure 2a Tables 3-6 peptides followed by RV-A peptides whereas IgG reactivity to RV-B peptides was less frequent and intense (Fig. 2a) . Similar results were obtained for IgA responses which in general were lower than the IgG responses (Fig. 2b ). The analysis of IgG reactivity to structural and non-structural proteins and to recombinant fragments and synthetic peptides spanning VP1, VP2, and VP3 from RV89 is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2a for all 120 children and in Supplementary Fig. 2b for those children (n = 41) who had shown increases of RV89-specific antibody responses in follow-up serum samples taken after recovery. Results obtained thus confirmed our earlier observations showing that the majority of RV-specific antibody responses are directed against the N-terminus of VP1 as represented by the 30 peptides from the N-terminus of VP1 proteins from the different RV species 33 . Some children showed an IgG response against VP2 and in particular to a fragment representing the middle portion of VP2 whereas VP3 and VP4 showed no relevant IgG reactivity (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b) . Among the non-structural proteins, 2C, 3A, and 3C showed some IgG reactivity ( Supplementary  Fig. 2 ). The analysis of IgG reactivity according to the age of children at the acute visit showed that children <1 year of age had much lower RV-specific IgG levels compared to children who were older than 1 year. There was almost no change of the RV strainspecificity pattern among the three age groups (Fig. 2c ). However, we found a positive correlation between the number of recognized VP1 peptides and the age of the children (Fig. 2d ). Children between 6 and 12 months of age recognized a significantly lower number of N-terminal VP1 peptides than older (13-42 months) children. Children older than 2 years reacted with significantly more peptides than both groups of younger children (Fig. 2e) . The patterns of antibody response against different RV peptides were also analyzed using an independent bioinformatics approach ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . A phylogenetic clustering of all peptides was prepared and used to generate peptide groups according to sequence homology which represented to a large extent the RV subgroups A, B, and C. Then an unsupervised computer algorithm was used to cluster the patterns of antibody responses. Finally, the results of these analyses were superimposed. It turned out that there was a very strong correlation between the two groupings, one based on antibody reactivity and the other based on sequence identities among peptides made through the unsupervised analysis. Thus antibody response patterns reflected very closely the peptide sequence similarities ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Identification of RV species-specific antibody increases. Based on our previous observations that antibody increases specific for the N-terminal portion of VP1 can be detected in serum samples obtained from subjects after RV infection 36 , the PreDicta chip was equipped with a VP1 peptide set which should allow detecting species-specific immune responses at high resolution ( Fig. 1 ). Supplementary Figure 4 shows images of RV-specific antibody responses measured in sera from six representative children obtained at the time of the acute episode of wheeze and in sera at a follow-up visit 2-3 months later. In sera from the follow-up visit increased antibody responses to RV-A (sera #33, #108), RV-C (sera #119, #84), and RV-B (sera #66, #89) peptides could be detected ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . We then compared the peptide-specific IgG antibody levels in sera obtained from the 120 children at the time of the acute wheeze and at the follow-up 2-3 months later (i.e., median 11 weeks later) ( Table 1 ). Supplementary Figure 5 shows a color-coded map of the peptide-specific antibody responses for the acute phase and follow-up of each of the children demonstrating species-specific IgG increases. Next, we compared the peptide-specific increases in relative numbers for each child (Fig. 3a) . According to these peptide-specific IgG increases, children could be identified who responded preferentially to RV-A-derived peptides (n = 41), RV-C-derived peptides (n = 33), RV-B-derived peptides (n = 23), and some with a mixed response pattern (n = 7) (Fig. 3a) . For 16 children no increases of peptide-specific IgG responses were found (Fig. 3a, bottom) . The same analysis was performed for increases of antibody responses against complete recombinant VP1 proteins from the three RV-A strains (i.e., RV89, 16, 2), the RV-C strain YP, and the RV-B strain 14 ( Fig. 3a) but the results were less clear and negative for several children because only few strains were covered with the recombinant proteins. We have also included in Fig. 3a (right column) results from the PCR testing performed using VP4-VP2specific primers in 108 of the 120 children 35 , which showed that the nucleic acid-based detection of virus strains was negative for approximately 25% of children with increases of RV peptide-specific IgG levels which may indicate a higher sensitivity of serology vs. PCR in these children. Moreover, PCR results did not correspond well with the specificities of the antibody responses. There were also 14 children without increases of RV peptide-specific antibody responses who had positive PCR results (Fig. 3a, bottom) .

Next, we investigated whether antibody responses to certain RV species were associated with the severity of RV-induced wheeze. For this purpose, we determined the number of days with respiratory symptoms and the number of days when medication was required in the period between the acute and follow-up visit. The number of days with respiratory symptoms but not with medication was significantly higher in subjects with an increase in RV-A > Mixed > RV-C > RV-B specific signal (Fig. 4, top and middle panels) . We then analyzed the sum of days with symptoms and medication and found that RV-A and RV-C antibody increases were associated with the highest number of days with symptoms and medication (Fig. 4, bottom panel) . Children with RV-A-or RV-C-specific antibody increases had significantly more days with symptoms and medication than children with RV-B-specific antibody increases (Fig. 4, bottom panel) .
