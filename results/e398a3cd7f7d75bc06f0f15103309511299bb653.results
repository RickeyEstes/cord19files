The degree of similarity in terms of temporal and spatial unfolding of the simulated epidemics displayed a high variability across the two networks, census and mobile phone, depending on the nodes that were selected as a seed of the outbreak. In general, the temporal hierarchy of the epidemics, measured by the Spearman's rank correlation r s between the arrival times of all the nodes, was found to be very similar between the two networks with r s > 0.69 for every seed s of the network. Figure 1a shows that the distribution of r s ranges between r s = 0.69 and r s = 0.94, with averager s = 0.85. The similarity between the spatial infection patterns on the two networks was more widely distributed with values of the Jaccard index ranging between J = 0.13 and J = 0.46, with averageJ = 0.27 ( figure 1b) . Therefore, while the temporal sequence of infected nodes during an outbreak was generally well preserved in the two networks for most of the epidemic seeds, the paths of infection varied significantly with as few as 13% of transmission links shared between infection trees in some scenarios. Figure 1c highlights similarity of temporal patterns measured by r s was only mildly correlated with the spatial similarity measured by J (ρ = 0.33). The two quantities displayed a different behaviour and high values of r s were sometimes associated to low values of J, showing that they provide a different view of the system under study. The similarity of both spatial and temporal epidemic patterns was mainly driven by a few features of the outbreak seed that were in general positively correlated with each other, specifically the degree of a node and its traffic. As shown in table 1, the Pearson's correlation coefficient ρ between all the degree measures and the similarity of temporal (r s ) and spatial patterns (J(i, M, C) Node population, which is generally expected to correlate with degree and traffic, was also found to be a significant predictor for the similarity of epidemic temporal (ρ = 0.403) and spatial patterns (ρ = 0.687) as shown in table 3. The median income was weakly correlated with r s and J (ρ = 0.168 and ρ = 0.356). Other geographical and demographic variables were not significantly correlated with the similarity of epidemic patterns. Overall the above centrality measures were significantly correlated with the node loyalty, indicating that incoming and outgoing mobility flows of the census network were better captured by CDR data for highly connected, busy and highly populated locations. Figure 2 to the degree (figure 2a-c) or traffic (figure 2d-f ) of the seed node. It clearly appears that the higher the loyalty of the outbreak seed, the higher the similarity of the final infection trees. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the two quantities varies between ρ = 0.7 for Θ out and ρ = 0.76 for Θ tot . Moreover, the colour gradient indicates that Θ out , Θ in and Θ tot are positively correlated with all the measures of degree and traffic considered. Along the same lines, the loyalty was a significant predictor of the invasion chronology ( figure 3 ) with the Pearson's correlation coefficient between r s and Θ ranging from ρ = 0.45 for Θ out to ρ = 0.53 for Θ tot . When looking at the absolute differences in the seed degree between the two mobility networks, the correlation with the epidemic patterns was in general not significant (table 1) . Instead, the absolute difference in traffic was found to be a good predictor of the epidemic patterns' similarity (table 2) . This can be explained by the fact that epidemics seeded in peripheral nodes were the most affected by discrepancies in the two networks and most likely to display a different epidemic pattern from one model to the other. Moving from the analysis of nodes' features taken one by one to a multiple linear regression based on a set of predictors, the best models were all found to be a linear combination of several variables (table 4) . Specifically, the best linear model when Y ≡ r s was found to be a combination of 10 variables and the best linear model for Y ≡ J(s), was a multiple linear regression of seven variables. Compared to the best model with AIC min , we found 30 and 45 models to be within the range AIC < 2, which represents a traditional threshold for model selection [46] . Imposing a threshold AIC < 4, we would have selected 255 models for Y ≡ r s and 492 models for Y ≡ J(s).
