From 2005-2012, 52,261 samples of nasopharyngeal secretions were collected, of which 2,715 [5.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.6-6.0] were positive for RSV. The number of samples collected from children under 5 years old was 12,501, of which 1,373 (11.6%; 95% CI 11.0-12.2) were positive for RSV. The ratio of positive results from IIF assays in the age group under 5 years old for each of the five regions is shown in Table I . Seasonality: time series -wavelet and Fourier analysis -Wavelet analysis permitted identifying a strong tendency for RSV annual cycles in all regions of the country; in addition one can suspect a lower second wave peak, especially in the early years of the series. It is unstable and not statistical significant, but present in Figs 1-3. This evidence may indicate a biannual (semiannual) periodicity, that is, six months after the main peak. This second peak is more evident in the North and Midwest regions in specific years (Fig. 1 ). As shown in Fig. 1 , there is a seasonal pattern evidenced by the wavelets. Any irregularity may be due to the small number of monthly samples. The same annual cycle pattern with a small peak appearing after 6 months can also be observed in Fig.   2 , corresponding to the hospitalisation rates for bronchiolitis and pneumonia. These stable annual activity patterns identified using wavelets allow the analysis by means of Fourier decomposition of the complete time series for years 2005-2012. RSV seasonality analysis through Fourier decomposition of the time series assay results allowed identifying regional differences between the greater activity periods in the distinct regions of Brazil. The RSV peak occurred in the North and Midwest regions in the second week of April (peak = 4.4), in the Northeast in the first week of May (peak = 5.1), in the Southeast in the beginning of April, and in the South in the first week of June (peak = 6.2; Table II ). The seasonality Fourier decomposition analysis of the monthly rates of hospitalisation for RSV-associated bronchiolitis and pneumonia showed similar results when compared with the results from the positivity series of assays in the same region (Table II) . In general, the criteria are mutually consistent, with matching results.
