The inclusion period ran from April 2018 to June 2018, during which 77 febrile patients were admitted and hospitalised. A total of 26 patients were deemed eligible and participated in this study. Failure to obtain informed consent was the major cause of exclusion (20.78%, n = 16), eight eligible patients were not communicative, one was under guardianship, one was not conscious enough and six eligible patients refused to participate. The second most common cause for exclusion was the hypothetical requirement of MRI scans (15.58%, n = 12). The third cause for exclusion was swallowing disorders (12.99%, n = 10) and other disorders (12.99%, n = 10). The last cause for exclusion was digestive system disorders (3.9%, n = 3). Table 1 reports the characteristics of the 26 patients: 12 females and 14 males, aged 48.6 ± 17.5 years old (mean ± SD); their mean body weight was 65.9 ( ±13.66) kg and blood pressure was 118.6 ( ±17.87)/ 64.3 ( ±12.98) mm Hg. The mean capsule transit time (during 48 h of observation) was 37.3 ( ±14.8) hours. The shortest duration was four hours (one patient). Following the collection body temperature measurements from four different devices over the 48-hour observation period, Table 2 summarises the percentages of missing measurements, mean temperature, standard deviation, and maximum and minimum variable. There is a 16.5% gap in temperature measurements for ingestible capsules. The main cause of these missing measurements was the evacuation of the capsule before the 48-hour observation period or a synchronisation problem between the monitor and the capsule ( n = 42, 11 patients). eTact patches had fewer missing measurements at only 11.8% due to battery shutdown ( n = 18, 5 patients) or removal of the device by the patient ( n = 12, 2 patients). As for axillary and non-contact measurements, there was a missing measurement rate of 16.5% ( n = 42) and 15.3% ( n = 39) respectively, due to the absence of the patients at the time of recording and during the weekend. To highlight the usefulness of the ingestible capsule temperature measurements, Fig. 1 (A) indicates the time trend data of all measurements in one selected patient. Fig. 1 (B) indicates the time trend data of one patient with hypothermia. The regression line between the axillary temperature measurements (Taxi) and non-contact forehead temperature measurements (Tno-c), ingestible capsule temperature measurements (Tcap) as well as eTact temperature measurements (Tetac) are shown in Table 3 summarises the comparison of each correlation and agreement between the three different devices and the axillary temperature measurements. We also assessed the correlation at the time of each recording (10 recordings in 48 h); no statistically significant differences were found during the 48-h observation period. Finally, Table 4 Fig. 3 indicate the difference of two pairs of measurements.
