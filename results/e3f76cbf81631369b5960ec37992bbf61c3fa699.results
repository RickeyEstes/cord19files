Four hundred and twenty-six (426) samples from 264 patients were tested for MERS Co-V and The second global case of MERS was identified in a Qatari national who had previously travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2012. He was transferred from Qatar to a hospital in England where he clinically deteriorated, was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) however, unfortunately had a fatal outcome (6) . A second case in the UK was confirmed in February 2013, in a return traveler from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia who was admitted with severe acute respiratory symptoms. This patient required ECMO treatment however also unfortunately died. This case resulted in onward transmission to two further cases, of which one subsequently died (7) . In August 2018, a fifth case of MERS was diagnosed in a return traveler from the Middle East. The patient was initially admitted to a hospital in Leeds and then transferred to specialist infectious disease unit in Liverpool. The patient had a positive outcome and there was no onward transmission of MERS-CoV to the close contacts (8) As of the end of November 2019, MERS Co-V has infected 2,494 people with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 37.1% (9, 10) and a notably higher CFR in ITU settings (11) . Nosocomial outbreaks have occurred in Saudi Arabia and South Korea demonstrating the need for stringent infection control polices (12) . In view of the high risk of imported cases, Public Health England (PHE) commissioned regional centers to perform MERS-CoV testing for possible MERS cases arriving in England. PHE Manchester laboratory is one of two centers that currently perform Acute respiratory illness (ARI) and contact with a confirmed case of MERS-CoV in the 14 days prior to onset. Those meeting the PHE case definition were discussed with the Regional Infectious Diseases team and/or the Consultant Virologist and then tested for infection (3) (Figure 1 ). The majority of cases were initially discussed with the RIDU team and then transferred to North Manchester General Hospital for further assessment in the negative pressure rooms with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) use. Some local hospital cases were discussed directly with the PHE Manchester Consultant virologist. In these scenarios, the risk assessment
