From November 01, 2005 to May 31, 2006, 389 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from hospitalized pediatric patients with respiratory tract infection were investigated. Specimens from 2.8% (n = 11) of all patients were positive for HBoV. RSV, HMPV, HCoV, Influenza B viruses were detected in 13.9% (n = 54), 5.1% (n = 20), 2.6% (n = 10), and 1.8% (n = 7), respectively. There was no influenzavirus A detected. Taken together, in 23.4% of all investigated children, at least one of the viral pathogens included into the diagnostic panel could be detected. Most patients with HBoV infection were found in December 2005 (Fig. 1 ). The proportion of the HBoV-positive specimens referring to all investigated specimens varied between 0.0% and 5.7% in the corresponding month of surveillance (Fig. 2) . The median age of the HBoVpositive patients was 9.0 months (range, 3-17 months), eight (73%) were male. The median duration of symptoms before the admission to the hospital was 4 days (range 1-23 days), the median duration of hospitalization was 5 days (range 2-15 days). One patient had a preexisting comorbidity (premature birth, birth weight 980 g). The clinical diagnosis was acute wheezing (bronchitis) in four patients, pneumonia in six patients (55%) and croup syndrome in one patient. In eight (73%) HBoV-positive patients, the attending physicians ordered a chest radiograph, which yielded pathologic findings in seven patients (one peribronchitis, four bronchopneumonias, two lobar pneumonias). In five of six patients with radiologically confirmed pneumonia, HBoV was the only pathogen detected. While no patient had to be mechanically ventilated, 73% needed oxygen supplementation. The median leukocyte count at diagnosis was 11.3 × 10 9 L −1 (range: (6.7-16.7) × 10 9 L −1 ); the median C-reactive protein was 12.5 mg/L (normal < 0.3mg/L; range: < 0.3-114 mg/L). The patients received treatment with betamimetics (inhalative; 10/11; 91%), systemic steroids (6/11; 55%) and antimicrobial chemotherapy (9/11; 82%); it has to be considered, that only in those patients with RSV-coinfection, the attending physicians were aware of a viral pathogen at the time of the clinical event. Beside one patient, in whom HBoV was detected at two consecutive days in two respiratory specimens, no follow up investigations were performed. In 7 of 11 HBoV-positive patients no other pathogen was detected, in 4 (36.4%) at least one other viral pathogen was found (plus RSV n = 3; 27.3%; Norovirus n = 1; 9.1%).
