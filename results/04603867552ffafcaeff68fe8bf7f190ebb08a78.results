In a typical management setting, such as the SARS outbreak of 2003, public health professionals are confronted with a novel (or perhaps a highly virulent variant of an existing) pathogen that is spreading rapidly through a predominantly susceptible population. One of the important tasks of any modeling exercise is to provide insights into some of the epidemiological characteristics of the invading infection, such as its transmissibility, virulence, and persistence dynamics. Of great interest is the estimation of the basic reproductive ratio of the infection (R 0 ), which measures the transmission potential of the infection, and determines the degree of control required. Some of these aspects can be explored by studying the range of model parameters that give (initial) outbreak dynamics consistent with the (short-term) epidemic data thus far gathered. One approach is to fit model parameters to data by ''trajectory matching,'' where one looks for the combination of parameters that, in a statistically rigorous sense, give rise to dynamics most consistent with observed patterns [34, 35] . Alternatively, one may use the well-established result that during the initial stages of an epidemic, the growth rate is approximately exponential [17, 20] , with the rate determined by R 0 . First, we use this approach to examine, in general, how the distribution of the latent and infectious periods may affect the estimation of R 0 from initial epidemic data. To illustrate that our results are not specific to this methodology, we then take incidence data from an influenza outbreak and parameterize the epidemic models using trajectory matching. Estimating R 0 from Initial Epidemic Growth Rate We may obtain an estimate for R 0 by calculating the initial growth rate (k) of an infection from data and equating it to the growth rate of the equations, calculated from the dominant eigenvalue of the disease-free equilibrium (see Methods). Such an exercise reveals that for any observed k, the precise value of R 0 estimated is crucially dependent on the fundamental assumptions made concerning the distributions of latent and infectious periods. Specifically, we find that the following equation determines the relationship between R 0 and an empirically estimated epidemic growth rate, k: where m and n represent the number of subclasses in the exposed and infectious categories, respectively. The mean latent and infectious periods are represented by 1/r and 1/c, respectively, and are assumed to be known or estimated from independent data. This relationship was first determined by Anderson and Watson [36] and has recently been applied in the context of viral life cycle dynamics by Lloyd [33] . The relationship between estimated R 0 and the distributions of the latent and infectious periods is demonstrated in Figure 2A . It reveals a subtle yet very important interaction between model structure and estimated R 0 . In general, as the infectious period becomes more tightly distributed (increasing n), lower values of R 0 are estimated for any given growth rate k. On the other hand, as the variance in the latent period is reduced (increasing m), higher values of R 0 are estimated. Indeed, we may use the relationship given by equation 4 to arrive at the following general principle: if we ignore the latent period, then models with an exponentially distributed infectious period will always overestimate the infection's basic reproductive ratio. When the latent period is included, however, this finding is reversed when the growth rate is large ( Figure 2B ). In closely examining equation 4, we note that the basic reproductive ratio estimated from a model without an exposed class (1/r ¼ 0) is always lower than the estimate from the corresponding model when a latent period is included (1/ r . 0) (see equation S1 in Protocol S1). Therefore, when faced with a rapidly spreading infection, either entirely ignoring the latent period or assuming exponential distributions will lead to an underestimate of R 0 and therefore will underestimate the level of global control measures (such as mass vaccination) that will be needed to control the epidemic. The effects of changing the distributions of the latent and infectious periods on the estimated value of R 0 , with k assumed to be 100 per year and the average latent and infectious periods fixed at 1 wk. The gray grid surfaces show the asymptotic values of R 0 when the latent and infectious periods are both exponentially distributed (lower surface) or fixed (higher surface). We note that the shape of each surface is independent of the exact value of k. (B) At higher values of k, R 0 may be substantially over-or underestimated using the classical exponentially distributed model (n ¼ m ¼ 1) compared to periods of fixed lengths (n ¼ m!'), depending on whether an exposed class is included (solid lines) or not (dashed lines). DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020174.g002 Estimating R 0 from Trajectory Matching While the results described in the previous section are based on the rate of epidemic take-off, we reach the same qualitative conclusions about the effects of the distributions of latent and infectious periods when estimating R 0 by other data-fitting methods. For illustration, we use data from an influenza outbreak in an English boarding school [37] to estimate model parameters by trajectory matching. In the absence of independent data, this method can be used to provide estimates of the key infectious parameters. Of course, here we can also compare the parameter estimates to observed parameter ranges, since the influenza virus is known to have a latent period of between 1 and 4 d and infected individuals may transmit the virus up to 4 or 5 d after the onset of illness [38] . We determine the best fit of the model output to daily incidence data by minimizing the least squares errors for different values of the distribution parameters m and n. For comparison, we also determine the best-fit parameters in the absence of any latent period. The least squares errors and estimated R 0 of the best fit for a combination of m and n are presented in Figure 3 . These results clearly illustrate the points raised in the previous section: (i) entirely ignoring the latent period gives a significantly lower estimate of R 0 , and (ii) the assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods results in consistently lower estimates of R 0 than their gammadistributed counterparts. Despite visually similar solutions, the SIR best-fit and SEIR best-fit models ( Figure 3C ) result in strikingly different estimates of R 0 : 3.74 for the SIR model versus 35.9 for the SEIR model, which is partly a result of the small population size. However, the best-fit estimate of R 0 obtained from the gamma-distributed SEIR model (m ¼ 2, n ¼ 2) is much more sensitive to the number of points used to obtain the fit ( Figure 3D ): the exponentially distributed SIR model gives the same estimate whether the first six (up to the peak in incidence) or more points are used. This difference is further emphasized if we use the first few points of the data to estimate the rate of epidemic take-off (k ¼ 1.0837 d À1 ), and then take the final estimates of the average latent and infectious periods to compute R 0 using equation 4. For the SIR model (n ¼ 1, 1/c ¼ 2.2 d) we obtain an R 0 of 4.38 whereas for the SEIR model (m ¼ 2, n ¼ 2, 1/r ¼ 2.6 d, 1/c ¼ 2.1 d) we obtain an R 0 of 16.9. Thus the initial rate of increase in incidence does well in estimating R 0 for the exponentially distributed SIR model but significantly less well for the gamma-distributed SEIR model. Given that we are fitting an additional parameter, it is to be expected that a limited number of data points confounds the estimation of R 0 when we include a latent period in the model assumptions. However, this also highlights that even when incorporating a latent period, estimates of R 0 based on the initial epidemic growth rate may potentially underestimate the true value of R 0 .
