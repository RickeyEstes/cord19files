To ensure accuracy initial quantification of the virus stock was first measured both by plaque assay, where growth of the virus could be visualized as plaques, and TCID 50 , where virus replication could be visualized as CPE. As expected, wells with a higher concentration of virus showed a complete loss of the cell sheet in the plaque assay. Distinct, countable plaques were detected in the 10 −4 and 10 -5 * A cut-off value of ≤ 0.53 OD was used to distinguish between positive and negative wells for the colorimetric assay. # Two independent assays with triplicate values each. dilutions (Fig. 1) . The average titer of the virus stock based on the plaque assay was 10 6.05 ± 0.43 plaque forming units (PFU) while the mean titer obtained by TCID 50 titrations was 10 4.55 ± 0.21 . The agreement between the TCID 50 and the plaque assay as measured by the Spearman's rank coefficient was 0.975 with a p value of 0.005. The 95% confidence interval for rho was 0.660-0.998. The cell controls remained uninfected while the virus controls showed clear CPE, for the duration of the incubation. As expected for the MTT 50 assay, the OD values obtained after addition of MTT were low for wells with higher concentrations of virus, and vice versa, reflective of low cell viability due to viral infection. The uninfected cell controls had an average OD value of 1.10. The relationship between decreasing concentrations of virus in the logarithmic viral dilutions and increase in the OD value on the MTT assay was linear with the equation y = 0.1496x + 0.0821, R² = 0.916, indicating specific detection of viral replication by the MTT assay ( Fig. 2 ) (Ramamoorthy and Singh, 2018) . Using dichotomized values from the visual reading as the gold standard for ROC analysis, an OD value of ≤ 0.53 was selected as the optimal cutoff to distinguish between wells with and without CPE. The area under the curve was 0.933 with a Z statistic p value of < 0.0001 (Fig. 3) (Ramamoorthy and Singh, 2018) . The area under the curve represents the accuracy of the test, with a value of 1.0 representing a perfect test. The p value is the statistical probability that the test can accurately distinguish between positive and negative samples. At this software generated cutoff, the positive and negative predictive values were both 90% respectively and the specificity was 95%, while the sensitivity was 81%. The kappa statistic for the agreement between the visual and MTT read outs was 0.83, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.780 to 0.874. These values indicated a good agreement between the tests. When samples were tested by both the conventional V/N and MTT for the visual readouts from 96 well plates of the TCID 50 assays were compared with the OD values obtained from the MTT assay using ROC analysis tool in the MedCalc Inc. software, to obtain a cut-off value to distinguish between positive and negative wells. The true positive rate (sensitivity) and the false positive rate (100-specificity) were plotted at the Y and X axis respectively at different cutoff points for the OD values. The curve obtained is indicative of the sensitivity and specificity of the assay at a given cutoff point. The top left corner, representing the area under the curve (AUC) or accuracy of the test, was 0.931. At the selected cutoff of ≥ 0.53 the specificity was 95%, while the sensitivity was 81% with a p value of < 0.0001. V/N assays determine agreement between the tests, the conventional V/N assay performed as expected since the commercial positive control sample showed high V/N titers while the negative control did not (Table 1) (Ramamoorthy and Singh, 2018) . Following visual assessment of the 96 well plates, MTT was added to the wells and OD values obtained as the read out from the ELISA plate reader. The colorimetric V/ N titer was determined as the lowest dilution at which the wells had an OD value ≤ the cut off value of 0.53. There was complete agreement between the conventional and MTT V/N assays across the triplicate testing in two replicate assays, indicating high reproducibility with no measured inter or intra assay variation between the two compared tests (Table 1) (Ramamoorthy and Singh, 2018) . There was no statistically significant difference between the groups as assessed by a Student's ttest (p = 0.71). Two-fold differences were noted for the positive control sample between two titrations of replicate 2. This difference is generally accepted to be within the detection limits for V/N assays (Stephenson et al., 2009) or can be attributed to operator error but did not affect agreement between the colorimetric and conventional V/N tests. Similarly, high levels of consistency between the conventional and colorimetric V/N's was evident in the field samples tested with only 4 samples showing a two-fold inter assay variation (Table 2 ) (Ramamoorthy and Singh, 2018) . The negative field samples tested had a titer of 1:2 or > 1:2 in both assays. To test non-specific samples by the V/N assay, serum samples from porcine circovirus strain 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), transmissible gastro-enteritis virus (TGEV) or porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) infected pigs were tested by conventional and colorimetric V/N assays. The PCV2 and PRRSV specific sera were obtained from a previous study (Ramamoorthy et al., 2011) . A pooled sample of sera (N = 5) collected at 28 days post infection was tested in duplicate. The PRCV, PDCoV or TGEV-specific sera were gnotobiotic pig derived antisera provided by Dr. Linda Saif, Ohio State University and were also tested in duplicate. Similar to other studies , detectable neutralization of PEDV with the non-specific controls was not observed in this study.
