Of 520 specimens processed, 67 were found to be positive by more than one method (Table 1 ). 114 were positive by the low-speed centrifugation and calcium phosphate methods, 71 specimens contained rotavirus, 23 adenovirus, five coronavirus and 15 small round virus, of which five were found with rotavirus, and two with adenovirus. Many of the positive specimens were negative when grids were prepared by the direct drop method (1) as the distribution over the grids was uneven, and particles were not seen on all grid squares or all squares of the same grid. In the preparations by low-speed centrifugation (method 2) a number of particles were seen on most grid squares, except when excessive debris caused grids to be thick and black, and therefore required a second preparation. Grids prepared from dissolved calcium phosphate (method 4) were satisfactory, as only occasionally were some grids thick and black. There was much less cellular and bacterial debris using the calcium phosphate method. In all calcium phosphate preparations adenovirus, rotavirus and' coronavirus particles were seen singly and in groups of two to three. A large proportion of specimens contained virus particles in clumps of variable sizes (Figs. l-3). Some of these clumps contained over 1000 particles and in many of the clumps virus particles were heaped in the centre Fig. 2a, b . Negatively stained grid prepared as in Fig. 1 , showing single and clumped adenovirus particles in low (grid bar = 500 nm) and high magnification (grid bar = 100 nm). Note very little background cellular debris. (Fig. 3) . The grids prepared by calcium phosphate adsorption appeared to contain more particles per grid square and the particles showed typical viral morphological features (Figs. 14). Measurement of the virus particles prepared by each method showed no size difference from the mean of the virus. In the case of small round viruses, 20-30 nm diameter single particles were rarely observed. The clumped virus seen contained 5-15 particles, but often many of the clumps consisted of over 1000 particles (Fig. 3 ).
