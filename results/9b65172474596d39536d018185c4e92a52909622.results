3.1. Performance characteristics of quantitative (N-specific) and conventional (S1-specific) RT-PCRs for IBV detection Shannon entropy plots, used to evaluate the specificity of the designed primers, predicted a broad reactivity against different Table 2 Comparison of the analytical specificity of two real time RT-qPCRs targeting UTR (Callison et al., 2006) or N (this study) using a panel of IBV and other coronaviruses as well as other avian viral pathogens.
