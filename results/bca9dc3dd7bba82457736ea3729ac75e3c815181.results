A total of 638 nursing students participated in the study. For those who did not participate or were excluded, the reasons included 6 who were physically unfit (eg, asthmatic attack, influenza), 2 who were absent (eg, withdrew from the program), and 1 who had unshaven bushy facial hair. The participants ranged from 18-30 years of age, and 25.5% of them were men (n = 163). Their mean height was 163.1 ± 7.69 cm, and their weight was 56.2 ± 11.14 kg. As far as the FFs between a group of positive and negative user seal checks were concerned, generally the participants with negative user seal checks obtained an observable higher score in the 3 types of respirators compared with those with a positive check. However, only significant differences were found regarding the use of the KC-C respirator (t = 2.01-2.75, P = .006-.045) ( Table 1) . The results of the user seal check compared with that of actual gross leakage performed by QNFT are presented in Tables 2 and 3 . Among the participants, 25.7% (n = 164), 20.4% (n = 130), and 24.5% (n = 156) reported positive user seal checks regarding the 3M-A, 3M-B, and KC-C respirators, respectively. However, the prevalence of actual gross leakage identified by QNFT in normal breathing was 34.3%-39.2% in both of the 3M res- pirator models and 65.8% in the KC-C model. In deep breathing, the prevalence was similar, 31.0%-35.0% in both of the 3M respirator models and 65.4% in the KC-C model. Testing on the 3 different respirators in the 2 breathing conditions, the sensitivity and specificity of the user seal check for identifying a case with actual gross leakage ranged from 21.5%-28.0% and 75.2%-81.7%, respectively (Table 4 ). Extreme prevalence rates caused deviation of positive predictive values and negative predictive values. 27 According to the current results on prevalence rates of actual gross leakage (ie, between 31.0% and 65.8%), further evaluation on the characteristics of the test's performance of positive and negative predictive values was regarded as appropriate. Regarding the test of the 3M respirators, the positive predictive values of a positive user seal check for estimating the probability of actual gross leakage ranged from 34.6%-42.7%, whereas the negative predictive values ranged from 62.0%-69.9%. In contrast, the test of the KC-C respirator showed different patterns, which were of relatively high positive predictive values (69.9%-74.4%) and low negative predictive values (36.1%-36.9%). Finally, both the positive and negative likelihood ratios indicating the post-test probability of the user seal check were close to 1.0 (positive likelihood ratio range, 1.08-1.51; negative likelihood ratio range, 0.89-0.98). Table 4 presents the detailed results.
