Analysis of hybridization conditions, using radioactive and biotinylated pBC-52, in the detection of purified BCV Purified virus, diluted and spotted in 20 X , 10 x or 1 x SSC on nitrocellulose, was detected with probe °pBC (plasmid bovine coronavirus)-52, (containing a 600 by cDNA insert) in hybridization assays with different formamide concentrations . About 100 ng of probe with a specific activity of 10 7 cpm .tg -1 was added per blot (48 cm 2), on which 24 samples were spotted . pUC-19 DNA with a specific activity of 10' cpm µg -' was added to an identical blot as a control for potential background hybridization . Furthermore, nucleic acid, isolated from non-infected HRT-18 cells, was tested to detect potentially present homologies with the probe, whereas pUC-19 DNA was spotted, as a control for the hybridization itself . Fig . 1 demonstrates that concentrations of 1 or 10% formamide could not be used to determine the signal intensity obtained with the virus since the background was too high, as expected for low stringencies . The probe could detect the virus under all the other conditions indicated in Fig . 1 , although higher concentrations of 60-65% formamide appeared to be optimal . Different salt concentrations, used in diluting and spotting the virus, strongly influenced the amount of viral RNA detected . Virus diluted and spotted in 1 X SSC, as compared to 20 X SSC, resulted in an at least two to three times stronger detection signal with a simultaneous increase in detectability of smaller amounts of virus (Fig . 1) . A similar result was observed when biotinylated probe pBC-52 was 'used, with the difference that the optimal formamide concentration was reduced to about 40% (Fig . 2) . These data thus demonstrate that high salt concentrations reduced virus binding to nitrocellulose, when compared to low salt concentrations . In addition to pBC-52, two other cDNA-clones (pBC-225 and pBC-247, containing insert sizes of 1 . 1 and 1 . 6 kbp, respectively), obtained from randomly primed cDNA and the inserts of which did not contain overlapping sequences with the insert of pBC-52, were selected for their capacity to hybridize strongly in colony filter hybridization assays (data not shown) . These probes (pBC-225 and pBC-247) were tested in the same hybridization conditions, indicated in Fig . 1 , as for pBC-52 . The optimal formamide concentration for probes pBC-225 and pBC-247 in radioisotopic virus detection was lower than for pBC-52, i .e . 50% (data not shown), but spotting conditions for optimum detection remained the same . pUC-19 sequences did not show any homology with BCV-RNA, since no hybridization signal was obtained in different spotting conditions (Fig . 1) . Furthermore, probe pBC-52 did not hybridize to nucleic acid isolated from HRT-18 cells, whereas a slight detection signal could be seen with nucleic acid, obtained from infected HRT-18 cells (Fig . 1) . The replicative form (RF) of M13-mp19, containing the insert of pBC-52 in its Pst I site, was used in the same combinations of hybridization conditions, as mentioned in Fig . 1 , but resulted in a very poor virus detection, although the control hybridization with the RF of M13-mp19 itself was very strong (data not shown) . Determination of virus detection limit with biotinylated and radioactive probe pBC-52 BCV was diluted and spotted in 1 X SSC, followed by subsequent baking, prehybridization overnight at 42°C using 60% formamide and hybridization for 30 h In each case, 100 ng probe ml -' was added per blot (48 cm') containing 24 samples . The autoradiograph was exposed for 24 h at -70°C using intensifying screens . Methods for the isolation of genomic RNA . These tests were performed in anticipation to detect virus in faecal samples, for which these treatments may be required to eliminate binding competition onto nitrocellulose between contaminating proteins or nucleic acid and viral RNA . Similar amounts of RNA were detected with and without proteinase K treatment when spotting was done in 20 X SSC, whereas RNA could not be detected after proteinase K treatment when 1 X SSC, under which the virus detection was optimal, was used (Fig . 4) . Virus could also be detected in the supernatant of infected HRT cells (Fig . 5, lane  B) , whereas the hybridization signal increased strongly after proteinase K/SDS treatment (Fig . 5, lane C) . The poor detection of virus in the supernatant is probably due to competition for binding sites between virus and cellular components onto the nitrocellulose . These results were confirmed with a simulation model in which purified virus was added and diluted in supernatant fluid of non-infected HRT-18 cells (data not shown) . The signal intensity ( Fig. 1 . Hybridization was done for 20 h at 42°C, and the autoradiographs were exposed for 10 h at -70°C using intensifying screens . with respect to viral proteins . This amount corresponds to about 2 . 5 x 10 8 virus particles per millilitre culture fluid .
