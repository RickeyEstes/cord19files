Of the 8753 pilgrims, 977 (11.2%) reported symptoms of fever and/or respiratory symptoms and 300 (31%) consented to participate in the study. Participants' median age was 60 years (range 26e90 years) and 140 (47%) were male. Participants had been in Saudi Arabia for 21e42 days (median 40 days) and reported symptoms of 1e15 days duration (median 5 days) ( Table 1) . Cough (89.7%) and nasal discharge (86.3%) were the most commonly reported symptoms. None of the 300 participants tested positive for MERS-CoV; however, 33 (11%) participants aged 37e86 years tested positive for influenza viruses (A/H3N2 ¼ 13), A/H1N1pdm09 ¼ 9 and B/Yamagata ¼ 11). Influenza positive cases had a significantly higher frequency of fever, rigors, and chills than influenza testnegatives (Table 1 ). All influenza positive cases were asked to follow-up at the study-hospital based-clinic and advised about infection control. Sixteen (48%) patients reported back to the study clinic and were prescribed oral oseltamivir. Seventeen (52%) patients who did not reach the hospital clinic were advised to seek medical help locally and the reports were conveyed to their physicians; two were prescribed oseltamivir. There is no state policy for use of influenza antivirals, however the common practice is to prescribe oseltamivir during an influenza season for suspected influenza cases who appear sick and febrile without waiting for laboratory confirmation. No hospitalizations were needed and all had uneventful recovery over a period of 2e5 days (median 5 d). Of the 300 participants, 216 (72%) reported receiving inactivated influenza vaccine (comprising of A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus; A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2)-like virus and B/Massachusetts/2/2012 (Yamagata)-like virus) approximately 2 weeks (median 16 days, range 14e21days) prior to the pilgrimage. About 10% (n ¼ 21) of the these tested positive for influenza in comparison to 14.3% (n ¼ 12) of those not vaccinated prior to the pilgrimage (p ¼ 0.26). No differences in age, gender, onset or frequency of symptoms were seen between vaccinees who tested positive and those who tested negative for influenza. Some of the participants also gave a history of spontaneous recovery from their respiratory illness that they had developed while in Saudi Arabia. However there was no record of any laboratory confirmation for any bacterial or a viral pathogen having caused the illness.
