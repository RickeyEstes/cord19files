Effect of GA against glutamate-induced cell damage in DPC12 cells GA alone did not affect DPC12 cell proliferation. Exposure to 20 mM glutamate for 24 h resulted in decreased viability of 77.3±0.6%; however, pretreatment with 6.25 and 12.5 mM GA significantly prevented the loss of cell viability, enhancing viability to 93.4±0.9% (P,0.001) and 85.3±1.9% (P,0.05), respectively ( Figure 1B) .
