During the study period from 2013 to 2016, a total of 2657 patients were screened for MERS-CoV and only 20 (0.74%) tested positive. During the first two years (April 2013-March 2015), a total of 1013 patients were screened for MERS-CoV. Only 1.8% of them were positive for MERS-CoV (Table 1 ) and unfortunately these were not systematically screened for influenza. There was an increased number of tests in November 2015-March 2016 (Fig. 1) . From April 2015 to December 2016, a total of 1644 patients were tested for both MERS-CoV and influenza. None of the patients tested positive for MERS-CoV and 271 (16.4%) were positive for influenza. The detected influenza viruses were Influenza A (107, 6.5%), pandemic 2009 H1N1 (n = 120, 7.3%), and Influenza B (n = 44, 2.7%) ( Table 1 and Fig. 2 ). It is interesting to note the pattern of the influenza in 2015 and 2016 (Fig. 3) . Pandemic H1N1 was the most common influenza in 2015 and influenza A other than H1N1 was more common in 2016. The 2015 influenza season peaked October to December and the 2016 season had a peak in August and then October to December (Fig. 3 ). There was a significant difference in the mean age ( Â± SD; 95% CI) of patients with H1N1 and other influenza (Fig. 4)
