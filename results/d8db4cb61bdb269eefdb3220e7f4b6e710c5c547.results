Lung pathology of Chinese rhesus monkeys infected with the pathogenic SARS-CoV PUMC01 To study the relationship between ACE2 variation and lung damage, we first evaluated the pathologic changes in eleven Chinese rhesus monkeys (Rh1-Rh12) experimentally infected with SARS-CoV PUMC01 (Table 1) . Two uninfected monkeys (Rh13 and Rh14) were included as controls. Although infected macaques did not have significant clinical signs other than fever and loss of appetite, it was crucial to determine whether they had developed any pathological changes in their respiratory system. For this reason, necropsy specimens collected from the sacrificed macaques were evaluated for pathological abnormalities on day 7 post infection. We chose day 7 for sampling because obvious pathological changes were often found in most infected animals at this time point Li et al., 2005a; Qin et al., 2005) . In general, the major histopathological changes were primarily found in the lung of infected macaques (Figs. 1B, C, E and F). The infected animals had acute interstitial pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. It was common to see multifocal pulmonary consolidations characterized by broadened alveolar septa, poorly preserved alveolar lining, epithelial hyperplasia, capillary vessel dilation and congestion, and interstitial mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration. According to the severity of the pathologic changes, six monkeys (Rh1, 6, 7, 9, 10 and 12) were classified in the "mild" group (Figs. 1B and E) with Macaque Rh1 represents a mild case of infection with thickened alveolar septa and some monocyte infiltration (B and E). Macaque Rh11 represents a severe case of acute DAD with extensively broadened alveolar septa, increased monocyte infiltration, visible exudation of protein-rich edema fluid in alveolar cavities, ruptured elastic alveolar fibers, and local fusion of thick septa (C and F). SARS-CoV specific viral antigens were detected in the lung of both mild and severe animals. Neither pathological changes nor viral antigens were detected in the control animals (A and D). another five animals (Rh2, 3, 4, 8 and 11) in the "severe" group (Figs. 1C and F). Animals in the latter group developed acute DAD with extensively broadened alveolar septa, increased monocyte infiltration, visible exudation of protein-rich edema fluid in alveolar cavities, ruptured elastic fiber of alveolus, and local fusion of thick septa (Figs. 1C and F). In contrast, uninfected animals did not display signs of lung damage (Figs. 1A and D). SARS-CoV specific antigens were detected in both groups of infected animals (Figs. 1E and F).
