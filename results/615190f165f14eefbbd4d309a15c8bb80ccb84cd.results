The monthly time series data of reported HIV cases for male IDUs, female IDUs, and all IDUs in Taiwan were fit to the Richards model as in Figure 1 and Table 1 The effective reproduction number R was computed for each wave. However, it is unclear what the generational interval is for HIV. It has been proposed that the rates of partner change for homosexuals and heterosexuals tend to be of the order of 1 year, 21 but it is unclear what the rate of needle-syringe sharing is among IDUs, [22] [23] [24] although it is most likely of shorter length than that of sexual transmission of HIV. Due to the lack of a reliable estimate for the HIV generation time among IDUs in the literature, a generational interval of 5 or 6 months was assumed, based on an estimate of doubling time for AIDS cases among IDUs in the northeastern USA early in the epidemic. 22 It should be noted that the main purpose for estimating R in this study was to compare the transmissibility estimated using different datasets and to ascertain the relative temporal change in transmissibility that occurred in each wave of infection during the course of the epidemic. To Table 2 , where the time series of monthly reported cases and the difference of two successive monthly reported cases were found to be stationary for both males and females. Note that we use 'Male' and 'Female' to denote the respective time series of monthly reported male and female HIV cases, and '4Male' and '4Female' to denote the respective time series of differences of monthly male and female HIV cases. Next, the correlation between the monthly reported case data (Male and Female) and monthly differences in case data (4Male and 4Female) were analyzed. The correlation coefficient r is a useful measure of the linear strength between two random variables. Applying a univariate model of y = b 0 + bx t Ã€ lag + e t for 'x causes y' (or x ! y) with lag, Male ! Female and 4Male ! 4Female were found to be most significantly correlated (i.e., r > 0.7) with r = 0.906 and 0.804 with lag 0, respectively. The correlation plots for the correlation are given in Figure 2 , which indicates the most significant correlations between the male reported cases and female reported cases, as well as their differences, are consistently at lag 0 (in red). The Granger causality test was subsequently carried out between the time series of Male and Female and between the time series of 4Male and 4Female for time lags up to 5 months. Test results, also given in Table 3 with the causal direction for each pair indicated with an arrow, indicate that both male time series caused the corresponding female time series after a lag of 2 months.
