There were 62 patients examined and tested in 2010 and 72 patients in 2015, respectively. Patients were one month to 16 years of age with median age 3 ± 3.34 years in 2010 and Table 1 . There were no statistical significant differences between the two investigated seasons regarding the abovementioned categories (Table 1) . Average length of hospital stay was 6.2 ± 5.4 days in both seasons. A single virus was diagnosed in 61.3% (65/109) of the patients, coinfection with two viruses in 27.6% (30/109) of the patients, and concurrent detection of three viruses in 11.0% (12/109) of the patients. There were two cases of concurrent detection of four viruses (1.8%) one in each of the investigated seasons. There were no statistical significant differences between single and multiple virus infection were significantly more often detected in 2010 than in 2015 ( = 0.0001) with the highest frequency of PIV-3 detection in both seasons. Distribution among the types of PIV did not differ between the seasons ( = 0.4854). In 2015, four additional viruses were tested, HEV, HBoV, PIV-4, and HPeV, revealing the following detection rate in 2015: HEV 13.2%, HBoV 10.5%, PIV-4 2.6%, and HPeV 1.3%, respectively. The highest number of all viral infections was diagnosed in the 1-3-year-old group in both seasons (54.4%, 50/92 in 2010 and 38.2%, 29/76 in 2015) with observed differences in season's incidence of PIV and HRV in relation to the age of the patients (Figure 2) . In children below one year of age, higher incidence of HRV and PIV in 2010 compared to 2015 was recorded ( = 0.0092 and = 0.0092, resp.), and in children 1-3 years of age higher incidence of PIV in 2010 than in 2015 ( = 0.003) was also observed. RSV incidence was the highest in 1-3-year-old children in 2010 in contrast to the highest RSV incidence in <1-year-old group in 2015. However, there were no statistical differences observed comparing RSV incidence between the seasons in relation to patients age ( = 0.426 for <1-year-old group and = 0.062 for 1-3-year-old group, resp.). HRV was significantly more often detected in children with URTI ( = 0.0082), while RSV was significantly more often detected in children with LRTI ( < 0.0001) compared to the other viruses.
