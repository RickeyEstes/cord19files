3.1. The p70 S6K Inhibitor PF-4708671 Alone or in Combination with the p90RSK Inhibitor BI-D1870 Decreases RVFV Replication In Vitro p70 S6K and p90RSK are both capable of activating the S6 ribosomal protein through phosphorylation of Ser 235/236 and thus facilitating translation activation [44, 45] . Therefore inhibitors targeting p70 S6K and p90RSK either alone or in combination were evaluated to determine if they influenced RVFV replication in mouse hepatocytes. We chose the p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 for this analysis, as this compound inhibits p70 S6K activity with high specificity [46, 47] . Cell cytotoxicity 50 (CC 50 ) and effective concentration 50 (EC 50 ) assays were performed to rule out mouse hepatocyte cell toxicity and determine an appropriate dose to use in our in vitro efficacy studies. H2.35 BALB/c hepatocytes were somewhat tolerant of the p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671, with a CC 50 of over 50 µM ( Figure 1A , Table 1 ). PF-4708671 displayed an EC 50 of 17 µM against RVFV MP12-luc ( Figure 1B , Table 1 ). Analysis of cell signaling proteins demonstrated increased phosphorylation of p70 S6K (Thr 389), and downstream proteins S6 ribosomal protein (Ser 235/235) and eIF4G (Ser 1108) following RVFV infection, in agreement with our previous results [27] ( Figure 1C , compare lanes 1 and 2 to lanes 4 and 5). Treatment with PF-4708671 resulted in decreased phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (Ser 235/235), but not p70 S6K (Thr 389) and eIF4G (Ser 1108) ( Figure 1C , lanes 3 and 6). A decrease in p70 S6K Thr389 phosphorylation is not surprising, given that this is not an autophosphorylation site and rather Thr389 is phosphorylated by mTOR [48] . Additionally, the levels of RVFV NP were decreased following PF-4708671 treatment ( Figure 1C , lane 6), consistent with inhibition of viral translation. A reduction in viral titers was also observed, although not statistically significant ( Figure 1D ). These data confirm that p70S6K inhibition suppresses RVFV replication. The p90RSK inhibitor, BI-D1870 [49] , has been used in chemotherapy studies showing specific inhibition of p90RSK activity [50] , therefore we used this drug to inhibit p90RSK in the context of RVFV infection. H2.35 cells were very tolerant of BI-D1870 treatment, with only a~20% decrease in viability observed at the highest concentration tested (100 µM) (Figure 2A ). In contrast, when we attempted to determine the EC 50 of the p90RSK inhibitor BI-D1870, it was shown that as the drug concentration increased, viral replication increased as well ( Figure 2B ). Inhibition of phosphorylation of p90RSK, S6 ribosomal protein, as well as eIF4G decreased following drug treatment in mock infected samples ( Figure 2C, Lane 3) . Surprisingly, drug treatment in the context of MP12 infection resulted in no apparent change in phosphorylation of p90RSK, S6 ribosomal protein and eIF4G, but modestly increased the amount of RVFV NP ( Figure 2C , Lane 6). The level of infectious viral titer increased by approximately 0.5 log at all drug concentrations tested ( Figure 2D ). These results indicate that infected cells are more resistant to p90RSK inhibition and/or BI-D1870, a p90RSK inhibitor, is a viral agonist, not antagonist as it relates to infection of mouse hepatocytes. Kinase inhibitors in chemotherapy treatments can be used alone or in combination, and we wanted to determine if a synergistic effect could be achieved by using two kinase inhibitors simultaneously in RVFV infected cells. Even though p90RSK on its own resulted in more viral replication, we aimed to determine if a p70 S6K and p90RSK inhibitor combination could mitigate these kinases' redundancy in terms of S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation resulting in a more global shutdown of phosphorylation leading to a decrease in RVFV protein production and replication. CC 50 and EC 50 assays were performed on the combination treatments, as it is likely that a combination of the two inhibitors would be less tolerated than single treatment regimens. H2.35 cell viability was more greatly affected with the drug combination of the p90RSK inhibitor BI-D1870 and the p70 S6K inhibitor PF-4708671, with a calculated CC 50 of 62 µM ( Figure 3A , Table 1 ). This inhibitor combination was very effective at suppressing RVFV with~70% inhibition observed at 6.25 µM (Figure 3B ), whereas either treatment alone did not inhibit RVFV at this concentration ( Figures 1B and 2B) . Protein phosphorylation ( Figure 3C ) and infectious titers ( Figure 3D) were evaluated in the presence of 10 µM of the drugs, a concentration that has minimal effect on cell viability. Phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein decreased following drug treatment ( Figure 3C, Lane 6) . Additionally, the levels of RVFV NP and RVFV titers ( Figure 3C,D) were significantly decreased. These results demonstrate that using the p70 S6 kinase inhibitor PF-4708671 in combination with the p90RSK inhibitor BI-D1870 resulted in a significant decrease in RVFV replication and viral protein production.
