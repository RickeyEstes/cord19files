The expected number of cases averted under each antiviral strategy given no situational evidence, evidence for Pandemic A, and evidence for Pandemic B is shown in Figure 4 . It is important for decision-makers to consider the full Scenario posterior distribution, not just the expected values, due to possible underlying asymmetries of the posterior. Thus the figure also displays cases averted (values from Equation 5) for each of the pandemic scenarios, underlaid by a density plot of the Scenario posterior. This allows us to assess the relative number of cases averted under each combination of antiviral strategy and pandemic scenario, along with the scenario weightings specific to each hypothetical pandemic. The number of cases averted varies across pandemic scenarios under each of the antiviral strategies. Thus when the Scenario posterior is strongly weighted towards a high severity, low transmissibility scenario (as in Pandemic A), the expected number of cases averted is skewed towards higher values. Conversely when the Scenario posterior is strongly weighted towards a low severity, high transmissibility scenario (as in Pandemic B), the expected number of cases averted is skewed towards lower values. In the absence of situational evidence (and a uniform prior is used for Scenario), there is higher uncertainty around the expected value, since the Scenario posterior is also uniform. Figure 4 : Plots are shown for No evidence, Pandemic A (strong evidence of high severity, low transmissibility scenario) and Pandemic B (strong evidence of low severity, high transmissibility scenario) for each antiviral strategy. The plot for each antiviral strategy and evidence pair shows the cases averted for each pandemic scenario (coloured dots) underlaid by a density plot of the Scenario posterior, given the evidence (or the uniform prior, before situational evidence becomes available). The size of each pandemic scenario dot is also proportional to the Scenario posterior probability. The expected number of cases averted is indicated by the black bar through each plot. Each of the pandemic scenarios are labelled for antiviral strategy 'Rx all/PEP all', but not the other two strategies. Thus there are three key results which have implications for decision-making: 1. Uncertainty is greatest before situational evidence becomes available. 2. For all antiviral strategies, the expected cases averted and the underlying posterior distri-bution are skewed towards higher values when situational evidence suggests a high severity, low transmissibility scenario (Pandemic A) compared to when situational evidence suggests a low severity, high transmissibility scenario (Pandemic B).
