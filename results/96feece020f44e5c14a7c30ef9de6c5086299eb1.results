Samples were available from 127 cats ( Figure 2 ); for 102 of these, a definitive diagnosis was achieved (full details of the samples and results-Additional file 1): 57 cats with FIP; and 45 cats without FIP. Of the 25 cats excluded, five had no tissue samples collected into formalin, six had no tissue samples collected into RNAlater; and 14 only had limited tissue samples collected into formalin such that FIP could not be definitively diagnosed or excluded. Of the cats without FIP the reason for euthanasia and postmortem diagnosis comprised: neoplasia in 16; inflammatory/infectious (not FIP) disease in 15; metabolic disease in four; cardiac in 1; immune-mediated in 2; miscellaneous in 6; and on behavioural grounds in 1. Of the cats with FIP, the median age at euthanasia was 9 months (range 2-144 months; 8 cats had indeterminate age). Of the cats without FIP median age at euthanasia was 96 months (range 4-180 months; two cats had indeterminate age). Cats without FIP were significantly older than cats with FIP (U = 207, p â‰¤ 0.001). When available, 1-10 tissue samples (median 5 samples per cat) and/or 1 to 4 fluid samples (median 1 sample per cat) were examined per cat. See Table 2 for origin of samples and summary of RT-qPCR results. Of the 320 FCoV RT-qPCR-positive samples subjected to S gene mutation analysis 272 (85.0%) were successfully pyrosequenced (n = 89 at nucleotide 23531 alone, for M1058L; n = 183 at nucleotides 23531 and 23537, for M1058L and S1060A), 21 (6.6%) required Sanger sequencing, and 27 (8.4%) failed target gene sequencing. For the outcome of S gene analysis of FCoV RT-qPCRpositive samples see Table 3 (individual results can be found in Additional file 1).
