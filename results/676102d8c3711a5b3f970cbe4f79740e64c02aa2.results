Measurements were taken while each subject stood holding the left palm over the top of the CPV. The Doppler laser output exhibits a cyclic oscillation induced by cardiac oscillation with a period of 0.53 s (Fig. 2(a) ). A respiratory oscillation having a period of 3.8 s was observed using a 10-GHz radar (Fig. 2(b) ). The screening system automatically captures the facial area and calculates the average facial temperature of the area within the red rectangle (Fig. 3 ) which includes part of neck, excluding the facial background area (dark blue part f the collar which corresponds to the area temperature < 30 C), was calculated. The average heart rate was 66 AE 10 bpm for normal control subjects and 90 AE 12 bpm for influenza patients, which is significantly larger than that of normal control subjects (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4, left panel) . The average respiratory rate was 13 AE 2 bpm for normal control subjects and 16 AE 3 bpm for influenza patients, which is significantly larger than that of the normal control subjects (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4, center panel) . The average facial temperature was 32.9 AE 0.3 C for normal control subjects and 33.3 AE 0.7 C for influenza patients, which is significantly larger than that of the normal control subjects (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4, right panel) . In order to distinguish the influenza patients group from the normal control subjects group, the Z(X 1 ,X 2 ,X 3 ) function was calculated by statistical software (StatMate III) using non-contact derived data, which is shown in part in Table 1 . The derived Z(X 1 ,X 2 ,X 3 ) is a statistically significant function (p < 0.001, as determined by an F-test): ZðX 1 ; X 2 ; X 3 ÞZ35:5 À 0:21X 1 À 0:48X 2 À 0:36X 3 where X 1 is the heart rate, X 2 is the respiratory rate, and X 3 is the average facial temperature. The Z values calculated by this formula are shown in part in Table 1 . In this table, Z values were positive in the normal control subjects group (left) and negative in the influenza group (right), although some influenza patients Table 1 Z values of the normal group and the influenza group as calculated from data, which is shown in part in this table (heart rate, respiratory rate, and average facial temperature) using linear discriminant analysis. All Z values are positive in the normal group and are negative in the influenza group. The linear discriminant function Z(X 1 ,X 2 ,X 3 ) calculated from the non-contact derived variables distinguishes the influenza group from the normal control group. The Z value remains effective in distinguishing influenza patients regardless of their temperatures (Cf, gray areas), influenza patients without fever indicate relatively high heart and respiratory rates compared with normal controls within the same body temperature range. have lower average facial temperatures compared to some of the normal subjects, because their relatively high heart and respiratory rates compensate for these average facial temperature inversions. The sign of the Z value can be used to distinguish the influenza group from the normal control group. The Mahalanobis D 2 calculated from the non-contact derived variables was 6.5. The classification error rate corresponding to the Mahalanobis D 2 was more than 10%. A total of 51 influenza patients, bounded by the solid line ellipse in Fig. 5 , indicated a negative Z value, six influenza patients showed a positive Z value, and the corresponding positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity are 93% and 88%, respectively. The Z value remains effective in distinguishing influenza patients regardless of their temperatures as indicated in Fig. 5 . A total of 30 normal control subjects, bounded by the dotted line ellipse in Fig. 5 indicated a positive Z value, and five normal control subjects showed negative Z values. The corresponding negative predictive value (NPV) and specificity are 82% and 89%, respectively. The execution screen of the non-contact screening system displays the screening result, i.e., ''potential infection'' or ''pass'', which is judged by the sign of the non-contact derived Z value (Fig. 6) .
