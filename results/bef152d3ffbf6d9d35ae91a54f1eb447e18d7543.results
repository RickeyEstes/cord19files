There were 85 HIV-1 clade B or B infected patients enrolled with paired CSF and plasma samples collected for cytokine analysis. The median age was 38 years (range, 11-76 years) and 59 (69%) were men. The risk factors for HIV infection were sexual transmission ( = 44), intravenous drug use ( = 15), blood transfusion ( = 7), paid blood or plasma donation ( = 2), mother-to-child transmission ( = 2), and unknown ( = 15). In total, 29 of 85 patients had complications, including cryptococcal meningitis ( = 21), tuberculous meningitis ( = 2), Toxoplasma encephalitis ( = 2), Pneumocystis pneumonia ( = 2), and cytomegalovirus radiculitis ( = 2). Nearly half of the HIV infected patients (43%) were receiving HAART at the time of evaluation. All were on multidrug combination ART regimens, which consisted of at least 2 NRTIs (e.g., AZT, D4T, 3TC, DDI, and TDF) plus an NNRTI (NVP or EFV) or a PI (LPV). None were on mono-or dualtherapy. Based on MSK classification, patients were classified into HIV infected with normal cognition (HIV-NC; = 33, MSK = 0) and impaired cognition groups (HIV-CI; = 52). The HIV-CI group consisted of MSK = 0.5 ( = 24), MSK = 1 ( = 12), MSK = 2 ( = 10), and MSK = 3 ( = 6). The viral burden in CSF or plasma of HIV-CI group was higher than that of HIV-NC group, accompanied with lower CD4 cell count. However, there was no statistically significant difference whether in viral load or in CD4 cell count for two groups (Table 1) .
