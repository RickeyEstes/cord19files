Anticancer agent ABT-263 accelerates death of virusinfected cells. Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w are components of a cell-signalling network that governs cell survival and cell death in response to different stimuli such as viruses. We hypothesised that chemical inhibitors of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w could modulate the survival and death of virus-infected cells. We studied the effect of the anticancer agent ABT-263 on the survival of non-cancerous human macrophages in response to IAV infection. 18, 19 Cells were treated with ABT-263, infected with IAV or mock, and cell survival was monitored at the indicated times. At non-cytotoxic concentrations, ABT-263 accelerated the death of IAV-infected cells (Figure 1a ). The cell death was dependent on the dose of ABT-263 and on the multiplicity of the viral infection ( Figures  1b and c) . Interestingly, ABT-263 treatment only slightly attenuated the production of infectious virus particles ( Figure 1d) . Thus, at non-cytotoxic concentrations, anticancer ABT-263 sensitises non-cancerous cells to IAV-induced death. Next we studied the effect of ABT-263 and its analogues on the death IAV-infected cells. We found that the structural analogues of ABT-263, ABT-737 and ABT-199 accelerated the death of IAV-infected human macrophages. By contrast, two other Bcl-xL-, Bcl-2-and Bcl-w-inhibitors -gossypol and TW-37 -were ineffective in the sensitisation of cells to IAVinduced death (Figure 2a; Supplementary Figure 1 ). The effect of ABT-263 was not restricted to a specific macrophage preparation, cell line or IAV strain (Figures 2b and c) . Furthermore, ABT-263 accelerated the death of various cell types infected with influenza B (Orthomyxoviridae), Bunyamwera (Bunyaviridae), Semliki Forest and Sindbis (Togaviridae), Herpes Simplex 1 and 2 (Herpesviridae), Vaccinia (Poxiviridae), Measles (Paramyxoviridae), echovirus 6 (Picornaviridae), but not with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes (Herpesviridae), Tick-borne encephalitis and dengue viruses (Flaviviridae) (Figure 2d and Supplementary Figure 2 ). These results suggest that ABT-263 and its structural analogues sensitise cells to virus-mediated killing and confirmed that Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w are essential for cell survival upon viral infection. Potential mechanism of action of ABT-263 in infected cells. To address the mechanism of action of ABT-263 in virus-infected cells, we first analysed the stage at which IAV infection ABT-263 triggers cell death using three known inhibitors of IAV infection: obatoclax, saliphenylhalamide and gemcitabine, which target myeloid cell leukaemia-1
