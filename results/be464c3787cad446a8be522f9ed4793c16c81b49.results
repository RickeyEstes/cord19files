In order to see how working matrix proteins interact with the membrane, we used cryo-electron microscopy to take pictures of virus populations in a near-native environment. In addition to viruses, these populations naturally contained a few empty vesicles and a heterogeneous collection of incompletely assembled viruses that were released from the same cells as the virus. Of these, the most interesting were called GP vesicles, which had virus surface glycoproteins but lacked a visible matrix (GP vesicles; Fig. 1 ). Viruses, GP vesicles and empty vesicles were measured to determine whether the shape of the virus membrane was altered in the presence of matrix proteins. Virus-sized unilamellar vesicles in these micrographs were generally spherical as expected [7] , with an average ratio of 1.0560.10 for the largest to the smallest visible diameter. Three of the eleven viruses studied showed a statistically significant correlation between virus size and shape, ranging from small round viruses to large sausage-shaped particles with maximum diameters up to seven times as long as the shortest diameter ( Fig. 2A) , demonstrating that membrane shape is altered when virus proteins are present. The viruses selected here are all relatively simple, in that matrix proteins and the transmembrane anchors of the surface glycorproteins are the only virus components in direct contact with the membrane. The correlation between size and shape was absent or reduced for GP vesicles (Fig. 2B) , demonstrating that the matrix proteins of these viruses are necessary for membrane bending, as reported previously [8] . We then investigated whether any of these virus matrix proteins could integrate into the membrane and replace lipid molecules, following the mechanism proposed to explain how Sar1p [3] , Epsins [4] and Influenza A virus M2 [5] induce membrane curvature. We looked for differences in the apparent brightness of the membrane in electron micrographs as a way to detect changes in the amount protein in each side of the membrane. This method works on the principle that electrons passing through a sample are scattered approximately in proportion to the square of the atomic number of the constituent atoms [9] . Therefore, when a substance made of small atoms such as protein is integrated into the membrane, membrane lipids are displaced, making that membrane face appear correspondingly dimmer compared to cellderived vesicle controls of similar size in the same image. Matrix proteins from different viruses are believed to use different methods to interact with the membrane. Our dataset included representatives of the three common membrane anchor types, including viruses with transmembrane matrix proteins (Coronaviridae M, Arteriviridae M and GP5), acylated matrix proteins (Retroviridae Gag, Arenaviridae Z) and non-acylated proteins (Orthomyxoviridae M1). The three-dimensional structures of these proteins, where known, appear to be unrelated [10] [11] [12] . We compared transects through the edge of viruses, vesicles and GP vesicles, where the phosphorous atoms of membrane lipids align to give the membrane a double-ringed appearance (Fig. 1 ). Viruses were compared to vesicles using a linear mixed-effects model in order to detect the replacement of membrane phospholipid by lower electron density material such as protein. Similarly, GP vesicles were compared to vesicles to distinguish the effects of matrix proteins from other viral membrane proteins. The intensity of the virus inner phosphate rings differed strongly from internal vesicle controls, with a significantly lower signal in all 11 viruses considered (Fig. 3) . The inner phosphate ring (area marked In) in native virus particles was only 45623% (blue vs. black, n = 11) that of the vesicles and 46631% (red vs. black, n = 5) that of GP vesicles, demonstrating that the reduction in inner leaflet phosphate is matrix protein dependent, and not solely due to transmembrane surface glycoproteins. To our knowledge, this is the first time lipid displacement has been tracked to demonstrate membrane protein integration. We had two main concerns regarding phosphate displacement. The first was mechanical -as the virus gets smaller, the membrane curves more per unit area. Large and small particles differ in curvature per unit length, which could change how many lipid molecules the electron beam encounters at the particle edge, causing large particles to appear brighter than small particles. We tested for this effect by examining the intensity of internal, membrane and external features of 216 Tacaribe virus particles, which ranged from 40 nm to 260 nm in diameter (Fig. 4) . Image intensity did not vary noticeably over the virus size range, demonstrating that curvature does not have a noticeable effect on intensity for virus-sized membranes. Secondly, we considered whether electron interference at the matrix-membrane interface could explain the decreased inner membrane phosphate signal. Contrast in electron microscopy images has two main sources, called amplitude and phase contrast. Amplitude contrast occurs when electrons collide with atoms in the sample and are scattered, and changes with the atomic mass of the sample [13] . Phase contrast is caused by electron interference, and changes with defocus [13] . To examine the effects of phase contrast, TCRV images were grouped according to defocus and analysed as before. Matrix-dependent phosphate displacement was observed across the defocus range (Fig. 5) , though the effect was strongest in images where both phosphate rings were distinctly visible. We concluded that matrix-dependent displacement was not likely caused by electron interference.
