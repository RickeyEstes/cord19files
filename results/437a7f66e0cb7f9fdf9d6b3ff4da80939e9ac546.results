The results of the indirect ELISA revealed that the overall prevalence of BRSV in the Nineveh Governorate was 83.11%, with the highest prevalence in cattle that were aged >7 months-1.5 years (relative risk (RR)=2.12) ( Table-1 ). BRSV prevalence was higher in imported animals, compared to animals of a local origin (RR=1.17) ( Table-1) , and in animals originating from large herds (100 animals), compared to those from small herds (40 animals) (RR=1.48) ( Table-1 ). There was no significant difference (p<0.05) between the prevalence of the disease in male and female animals ( Table-1 ). BRSV prevalence varied significantly (p<0.05) across the different geographical areas of the Nineveh Governorate with the samples collected from the northern region displaying the highest prevalence (RR=1.33) (Figure-1 ). In addition, samples collected in the winter displayed the highest prevalence of BRSV (RR=1.38) compared to those collected in the spring, summer, or fall (85.09%, 83.18%, and 75.18%, respectively) ( Table-2 ). industry [13] . In this study, the overall prevalence of BRSV in the Nineveh Governorate was 83.11%; higher or lower prevalence was recorded in other countries. In Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Norway, the reported prevalence rates were 34-96.64% [14, 15] , 75.5% [16, 17] , 51.1-100% [18, 19] , and 54% [20] , respectively. High variation in the prevalence estimates among cattle from different countries may be due to several factors such as differences in the disease management, laboratory methods, geographical region, and disease control programs. Our study recorded the highest BRSV prevalence in animals aged between 7 and 18 months, compared to those from other age groups, which is consistent with the findings of the previous studies [21, 22] . We also showed that the prevalence was significantly higher in imported animals than in domestic animals, which may be due to the stress of transportation and different environmental conditions [23] . Our finding of a higher prevalence rate in large herds compared to small ones is in agreement with those of the previous studies [24] [25] [26] [27] and can be explained based on the fact that large numbers of animals in one farm can lead to overcrowding and close contact between animals, facilitating disease spread.
