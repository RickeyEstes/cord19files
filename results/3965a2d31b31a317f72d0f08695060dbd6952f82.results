We generated 5, 10, and 15 day ahead forecasts for Hubei and other provinces excluding Hubei for 5 consecutive dates: February 5, 2020 to February 9, 2020. Fig. 1 e 3 represent the range of 5, 10, and 15 day ahead forecasts, respectively, by the date generated, and we compare the daily short-term forecasts of cumulative case counts across dates as more data become available. Current cumulative reported case counts as of February 9, 2020 are 27,100 for Hubei and 10,189 in other provinces (Chinese National Health Commission).
