Immunohistochemistry to detect DPP4 was performed on nose, lung, intestine, kidney, salivary gland, and liver tissues of different bat species: common pipistrelle bat, serotine bat, Gambian epauletted fruit bat (further referred as Gambian fruit bat), and Egyptian fruit bat. The assay was replicated two-three times for each tissue. We have used the same technique to map DPP4 localization in the respiratory tract tissues of human, dromedary camel, sheep, horse, pig, and llama 9, 26 . The antibody used in this study recognizes bat DPP4 as was demonstrated in transfection experiments using cloned Pipistrelle bat DPP4 22 . Hematoxylin and eosin staining on subsequent slides of the same tissues from the bats did not show significant histological changes. DPP4 was not found in the nasal olfactory epithelial cells of common pipistrelle bat, serotine bat, Gambian fruit bat, or Egyptian fruit bat (Fig. 1 ). In the nasal tissues of common pipistrelle bat, DPP4 was not detected in the respiratory epithelial cells lining the nasal cavity, but was detected in the epithelial cells lining the ducts of the submucosal glands in this species. In the serotine bat and Gambian fruit bat, multifocal DPP4 expression was detected in a limited number of nasal respiratory epithelial cells. In contrast, in the nasal tissues of the Egyptian fruit bat, DPP4 was prominently detected at the apical surface of the respiratory epithelial cells lining the nasal cavity as well as in glandular and ductular epithelial cells of the submucosal glands. In the lungs of the common pipistrelle and serotine bat, DPP4 was found in the endothelial cells of the capillaries but not in the bronchial, bronchiolar or alveolar epithelial cells. In the Gambian and Egyptian fruit bat, DPP4 was detected in the bronchial, bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells as well as in endothelial cells of small blood vessels (Fig. 1 ). In the intestinal tissues of all four bat species, DPP4 was prominently expressed on the apical surface of both small and large intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 2 ). In the kidney of all four bat species, DPP4 was found in glomerular cells, parietal squamous epithelial cells of the Bowman's capsule, and in the proximal tubular epithelial cells. In the salivary gland of common pipistrelle bat, DPP4 was only detected in the ductular epithelial cells, while in the serotine bat, it was detected in a limited number of glandular epithelial cells. In the Gambian and Egyptian fruit bat, it was detected in both the glandular and ductular epithelial cells of the salivary gland. In the liver of the common pipistrelle bat and serotine bat, DPP4 was present in a limited number of endothelial cells lining the sinusoids. In contrast, in the liver of the Gambian and Egyptian fruit bat, DPP4 was detected in the bile duct epithelial cells, in the endothelial cells of the hepatic arteries, and in the endothelial cells of the sinusoids (Fig. 2) . Variation in DPP4 signal and localization were occasionally observed between animals within the same species. In one common pipistrelle bat, the paranasal sinus and pharynx were examined and showed a limited number of DPP4 positive epithelial cells. The results of the DPP4 immunohistochemistry staining were scored qualitatively and summarized in Table 1 . In general, our results showed that DPP4 was prominently expressed in the intestine and the respiratory tract tissues of the frugivorous bats, i.e. the Gambian and the Egyptian fruit bat. However, it is limitedly expressed in the respiratory tract tissues of the insectivorous bats, i.e. the common pipistrelle bat and the serotine bat. In the common pipistrelle bat, DPP4 was not detected in the nasal respiratory, nasal olfactory, bronchiolar, or alveolar epithelium, but was abundant on the apical surface of the epithelium lining the small and large intestine. We compared these findings to our previous results on dromedary camel and human tissues 26 . In dromedary camels, DPP4 is strongly detected in the nasal respiratory, tracheal, and bronchial epithelium, while there is limited expression in the alveolar epithelium (Fig. 3 ). In humans, it is not found in the nasal epithelium and is present mainly in the alveolar epithelium. Additionally, we performed DPP4 staining on intestinal tissues of dromedary camels obtained from a previous study 8 . We found that DPP4 was expressed mainly on the apical surface of the small intestinal epithelium (data not shown), similar to what has been reported for humans [32] [33] [34] [35] (Fig. 3 ).
