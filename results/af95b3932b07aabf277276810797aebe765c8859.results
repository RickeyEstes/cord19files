We explored environmental characteristics of each study area, and found that the environmental conditions corresponding to invaded areas in the British Islands were completely contained within the native-range environments (Supplementary Material S1), at least with respect to the first three principal components. Environments shared with the British Islands covered only a small portion of conditions in North America (Fig. 2) . In other words, based on three methods (i.e., MOP, NicheA, ExDet), we found no novel environments across the geographic area of the species' invasion (Supplementary Material S2); this finding allowed us immediately to reject the scenario of novel portions of the species' fundamental ecological niche becoming observable only on invaded areas (Fig. 1) . Although the original study 20 documented differences in climate signature between native and introduced populations, we found no evidence of niche shifts when models from occurrences falling in analogous environments were compared (Fig. 2) . Indeed, we found higher niche similarity of the Jaccard index in analogous environments when compared with the models including all the occurrences and environments in North America (Table 1) . When considering occurrences from analogous environments (i.e., geographic space; maps in Fig. 3 ), niche models from the native and invaded populations had similar shape and position, but not size (i.e., environmental space; ellipsoids in Fig. 4) ; this difference derived from the relatively few occurrences available from the restricted areas presenting overlapping environments in North America (n = 31 occurrences), compared with many more from invaded areas (n = 5956 occurrences). Background similarity tests across the entire (original) study areas (i.e., the whole native and invaded ranges) showed niche similarity between populations of North America and the British Islands (P < 0.001). However, when analyses were restricted to occurrences and areas falling in analogous environments the metric was inconclusive ( Fig. 3) : a null hypothesis of niche similarity could not be rejected in one of two evaluations ( Table 1) . Analyses of occurrences distribution in the environmental space, using the ecospat tool of Broennimann et al. 29 showed considerable overlap in the environmental conditions occupied in the native and invaded ranges by Gray Squirrel. This evaluation showed sampling bias of occurrence records in the form of high densities of records in environmental space. The niche overlap, however, fell within the 95% confidence limits of the null distributions, leading to non-rejection of the hypothesis of niche similarity (Supplementary Material S3). Hence, in light of these tests (Jaccard similarity, background similarity, and similarity in environmental space), even the evidence for niche similarity was contingent on available occurrences and comparisons from uncontrolled environments, and extrapolation into non-analog sets of conditions.
