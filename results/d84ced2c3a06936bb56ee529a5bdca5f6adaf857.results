General observation. One week after MPS was injected, the rabbits in groups A and B exhibited gradually increased food intake and general motor activity. Three weeks after MPS was injected, 50% of the rabbits in group A exhibited reduced motor activity and significant weight loss (P<0.05), whereas the rabbits in group B exhibited normal motor activity without any significant changes in body weight. One rabbit in groups A and B, respectively, succumbed to anaphylactic shock 48 h after LPS injection. No mortality was observed in group C, and the rabbits exhibited good spirits, normal appetite, shiny fur and normal weight gain. X-ray examination. In group A at the 6th week, dual-hip X-ray demonstrated a normal femoral head, whereas the bone density was less uniform, with cystic degeneration. At the 8th week, the femoral head exhibited partial collapse, the density of the majority of the femoral bone was uneven, with visible cystic degeneration or sclerotic bone, or 'crescent sign'. The joint space was normal or slightly narrowed, and the bone trabeculae was partially disrupted. In group B at the 6th week, dual-hip X-ray demonstrated a normal femoral head with uniform bone density, without sclerotic bone or cystic degeneration. At the 8th week, the majority of femoral heads exhibited a normal appearance without collapse; the bone density was evenly increased without cystic degeneration or 'crescent sign', and the joint space was normal. Group C exhibited a normal appearance (Fig. 1) . MRI examination. T1-weighted images of groups A (n=11) and B (n=7) demonstrated that the femoral heads exhibited spotty, thin-thread, patchy low signals, and the T2-weighted images were also spotty, thin-thread, patchy high or low signals. Fat-suppression images were spotty, thin-thread, patchy high signals (Fig. 2 ). Group C exhibited no abnormal MR signals. Histopathologic changes. In group A at the 6th week, the bone trabeculae became thinner, sparser, the intramedullary hematopoietic cells were decreased, the fat cells proliferated and exhibited hypertrophy, and partial bone cellular nuclei were deeply stained. At the 8th week, the subchondral bone plate of the femoral head and the bone trabeculae became thinner, the continuity was interrupted, more bone cellular nuclei exhibited karyopyknosis, and the nuclei were deviated and deeply stained. The changes in the subchondral bone marrow area included: Large bone marrow fat tissues exhibited steatosis and dissolved; necrosis was aggravated; intramedullary vessels were compressed; the lumina was narrowed with visible fat emboli and thrombosis (Fig. 3) ; partial bones exhibited degeneration and necrosis; the number of normal cells in bone trabeculae were reduced; bone cells disappeared in the partial bone lacuna; and the empty bone lacuna were significantly increased (P<0.01), with aggravated vacuole degrees in bone lacuna. The average rate of empty bone lacunae was 33.86Â±8.38%. In group B at weeks 6-8, the bone trabecular structures were intact and arranged regularly, without continuous In group A, the bilateral femoral heads exhibited cystic degeneration, were irregular, and were mildly collapsed. (B) In group B, the density of the femoral bone was uniformly increased, with visible or sclerotic bone, or 'crescent signs'. The bone trabeculae was partially disrupted. The bilateral femoral heads had a normal shape without collapse. The joint space was normal. (C) Group C exhibited bilateral femoral heads of a normal shape without collapse. Bone density was uniformly increased, and the joint space was normal.
