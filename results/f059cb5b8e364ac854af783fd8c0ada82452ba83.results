The average concentrations (colony forming units/meters 3 of air) and the standard deviations of the culturable bacteria measured in the 2 bronchoscopy rooms are presented in Table 1 . The bacterial identifications obtained are shown in Table 2 . Because of the high bacterial diversity found, pure culture isolation was done on the most frequently observed colony phenotypes to perform the strain identifications. All the Staphylococcus spp strains were confirmed not to be Staphylococcus aureus. The average concentrations measured in room A varied from 43-100 CFU/m 3 air. In room B, the average concentrations were higher, ranging from 40-370 CFU/m 3 . The highest concentration (580 CFU/m 3 air) was measured during the second bronchoscopy procedure of the day in room B. Neither Mycobacterium spp nor influenza A and B viruses were detected in our investigations. The results of the Tukey-Kramer test done on the logtransformed concentrations are presented in Figure 1 . The test confirmed that the concentrations, measured during the bronchoscopies and the preparation of the patient, were significantly higher than the ones measured during the return to background at the end of the day. The morning background concentrations, on the other hand, were not significantly different, although they appeared to be lower than those found during the medical procedures.
