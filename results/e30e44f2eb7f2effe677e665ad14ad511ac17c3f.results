In our computer simulations, the origin time for SARS-CoV in humans was estimated to have transpired approximately 45 days (median t = âˆ’45, (He et al. 2004) . The upper and lower points at t = 0 represent r (civet sequence SZ16, human sequence GZ02) and r (human sequence GZ02, human sequence GD01), respectively. The curve is a gamma distribution function that is similar to the gamma distribution function that was used in computer simulations. t = time (days since estimated initial transmission from civets to humans); r = sequence divergence rate (substitutions per site per evolutionary step). (He et al. 2004); and December 12, 2002 (Zeng et al. 2003) ).
