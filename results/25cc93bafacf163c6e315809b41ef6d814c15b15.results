There are four different SARS-CoV specific probes immobilized on the gene chip. When any one of the following 15 signal patterns is detected (Fig. 1 (c) ) it signifies that the partial sequence of SARS-CoV is present and the sample is considered positive for SARS-CoV. Fig. 2 shows the DNA electrophoresis results and hybridization images from different controls including blank control using double distilled water as template, negative control using blood from a healthy control and sputum samples, and positive control using the Vero cells inoculated with SARS-CoV. All blank controls and negative controls tested were of negative results whereas the positive control produced the expected positive hybridization results. Fig. 3 (a-d) show the DNA electrophoresis results and gene-chip hybridization images from a patient's blood (patient 1) and sputum specimens respectively. The blood sample was taken 2 days post-onset of symptoms and the sputum sample taken 3 days post-onset of symptoms. The results show that the sputum specimen is positive for the presence of SARS-CoV whereas the blood sample was negative (no signal). Fig. 3 (e-h) show the electrophoretic results and hybridization images from the blood and sputum specimens, respectively, of a second patient (patient 2). The blood sample was taken 2 days post-onset of symptoms and the sputum sample taken 3 days post-onset of symptoms. It is clear that only the sputum specimen is positive for the presence of SARS-CoV (no signal was detected from the blood sample). Fig. 3 (i-l) show the electrophoretic results and hybridization images from the blood and sputum specimens respectively of a third patient (patient 3). Both samples were taken 6 days post-onset of symptoms. The results indicate that both blood and sputum specimens are positive for the presence of SARS-CoV. Fig. 3 (m-r) shows the electrophoretic results and hybridization image from the blood and sputum specimens respectively, of a fourth patient (patient 4). The blood sample was taken 7 days (Fig. 3 m and n) and 9 days (Fig. 3 o and p) post-onset of symptoms and the sputum sample taken 8 days (Fig. 3 q and r) post-onset of symptoms. The results indicate that both blood and sputum specimens are positive for the presence of SARS-CoV. The comparative study of the positive detection rate on gene chip with single probe and the four-combined probes for blood or sputum or blood and sputum are summarized in Table 3 . From all 34 patients, each run of nested RT-PCR may or may not produce amplicons depending on the type of the specimen and time interval of sampling. However, when the four amplification reactions from both blood and sputum were combined in, the positive detection rate on chip is maximized, increasing from 55.8% for blood and 79.4% for sputum to 91.2% when blood and sputum results were combined. When a single probe was used on the chip, the highest detection rate was 83.3%. This rate is approximately 8% lower than the rate (91.2%) when all four probes were used with both blood and sputum.
