Time-series data from a total of 12 cities were analysed. The ten European cities were all major port cities or centers for commerce at the time, with several cities being members of the Hanseatic League, a commercial alliance of trading cities surrounding the Baltic Sea formed in the 13 th century [13] (Figure 1 ). The North American cities of Philadelphia and New York were included. Population, death counts and case counts from Brigham's A Treatise on Epidemic Cholera are shown in Table 1 . Symptomatic attack rates and case fatality rates derived from Brigham's data are also shown in Table 1 . Weekly and daily case counts are presented in Table 2 and Table 3 . Overall, the Richards model fitted the cumulative weekly case count well ( Figure 2 ). Because the model was first fitted under the assumption that the epidemic was single wave, it gave poor fits for Dantzig, Stettin and KÃ¶nigsberg, where cholera epidemics occurred in two waves, as evidenced by the observation that the cumulative incidence curve produced by the model did not fit the data well visually, and that two distinctive peaks could be seen in the epidemic curve produced by the data. Data from these cities were fitted again with a two-phase outbreak model [14] , which yielded better fits ( Figure 3) . Based on the single-phase models, the estimated value of R 0 ranged from 1.93 (Lemberg) to 550.92 (Petersburg), with a median of 15.98 (11.85 if Petersburg is disregarded). Proportion of unrecognized cases calculated based on final size estimation and observed attack rates averaged at 0.96 (standard deviation, 0.04), which gives an average asymptomatic:symptomatic ratio of 48.29 (standard deviation, 29.72). The estimated values for intrinsic growth rate (r), R 0 , expected final size, percentage of unrecognized infections and ratios of unrecognized to recognized cases from each city are presented in Table 4 . It should be noted that for cities that had a two-phase epidemic, the R 0 estimation from the second phase of the epidemic is somewhat meaningless, since the initial condition assumption of I(0) = 0 does not hold at the beginning of the second phase. The expected final size and percentage of unrecognized infections were therefore estimated based on the R 0 produced from fitting a singlephase model to the epidemic curve. As expected, sensitivity analysis showed that increasing the infectious period (T) leads to an exponential increase in the estimated R 0 values [as shown in Supplementary Figure S1 ]: the larger the modeled intrinsic growth rate (e.g. Riga), the greater the variation, while estimated R 0 values remained relatively stable when the intrinsic growth rate is smaller (e.g. Philadelphia).
