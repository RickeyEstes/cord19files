TnF Blockade regulates il-10 expression in human cD4 + and cD8 + T cells To investigate whether TNF blockade regulates IL-10 expression in different pro-inflammatory cytokine-producing CD4 + T cells, we isolated CD4 + T cells from PB of healthy donors and cocultured the cells with CD14 + monocytes and anti-CD3 mAb (100 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of the anti-TNF mAb adalimumab (1 µg/ml), as previously described (20) . After 3 days, cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of GolgiStop for 3 h and stained for cytokine expression (gating strategy shown in Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). In agreement with our previous data (20) , TNF blockade led to a significant increase in IL-10 + cells within total CD4 + T cells as well as in the IL-17 + CD4 + T cell subset. In addition, we found a strong increase in IL-10-expressing cells within IFNγ + , TNFα + , GM-CSF + , and IL-4 + CD4 + T cell populations (Figures 1A,B) . TNF blockade did not alter the frequencies of IFNγ + , TNFα + , or GM-CSF + CD4 + T cell populations but did induce a modest increase in IL-17 + CD4 + T cells, as previously shown (20) , and in most donors in IL-4 + frequencies, although this did not reach statistical significance ( Figures S2A, B in Supplementary Material). Addition of an isotype control human IgG1 mAb did not promote IL-10 expression in CD4 + T cells ( Figure S3 in Supplementary Material). Contrary to the effects of TNF blockade, addition of rhTNFα to cocultures of CD4 + CD45RO + T cells, monocytes and anti-CD3 mAb led to a striking decrease in the percentage of IL-10 + cells within total CD4 + T cells and within IL-17 + , IFNγ + , and TNFα + CD4 + T cell subsets (GM-CSF + and IL-4 + CD4 + T cells were not tested) ( Figure 1C ). TNFα addition did not significantly alter the frequencies of IL-17 + , IFNγ + , or TNFα + CD4 + T cell subsets ( Figure S2C in Supplementary Material). Since pro-inflammatory cytokine-expressing CD8 + T cells also contribute to immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (27) (28) (29) , we investigated whether TNF blockade can regulate IL-10 expression in CD8 + T cells. We adapted the culture system to stimulate whole PBMC with anti-CD3 mAb (100 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of a dose range of adalimumab (0.01-10 µg/ml). After 3 days, the cultures were restimulated with PMA/ionomycin in the presence of Golgistop and cytokine expression was assessed within either the CD4 + or the CD8 + T cell populations. Significant increases in the percentages of IL-10 + cells within both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations were observed, including in the IL-17 + and IFNγ + subpopulations (Figure 2) . The regulation of IL-10 expression by TNF blockade was dose responsive in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subsets, with significantly increased IL-10 + frequencies following culture with either 1 or 5 µg/ml adalimumab ( Figure 2C ). These doses reflect FigUre 1 | TnF blockade promotes, while TnFα impairs il-10 expression in pro-inflammatory cD4 + T cell subsets. CD4 + T cells (open symbols) or CD4 + CD45RO + T cells (filled symbols) were cocultured with autologous CD14 + monocytes and anti-CD3 mAb (100 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of the anti-TNF mAb adalimumab (1 µg/ml) (a,B) or rhTNFα (10 ng/ml) (c). After 3 days, cells were restimulated and assessed for intracellular cytokine expression as described in the methods. CD4 + T cells were gated as described in Figure S1 in Supplementary Material.

(a,B) Freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured with anti-CD3 mAb (100 ng/ml) in the absence (control) or presence (anti-TNF) of adalimumab (1 µg/ml). After 3 days, cells were restimulated and assessed for intracellular cytokine expression as described in the methods. Cells were gated on live single CD3 + cells and IL-10 expression was assessed within CD4 + (a) or CD8 + (B) T cell subsets. Representative dot plots show the percentages of IL-10 + cells within total CD4 + or CD8 + T cells, or within IL-17 + or IFNγ + subsets after culture in the absence or presence of anti-TNF. (c) Cells were cultured as described above in the presence of increasing doses of adalimumab (0-10 μg/ml). Box-whisker plots represent data from n = 6 individual donors; whiskers show minimum to maximum values. Data were analyzed by Friedman test with comparison to control by Dunn's multiple comparisons test (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). the clinically effective trough levels for adalimumab in human serum following treatment (30, 31) . In agreement with data from the CD4 + T cell/monocyte cocultures, addition of rhTNFα (100 ng/ml) to anti-CD3-stimulated PBMC led to a reduction in IL-10 + cell frequencies, in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (n = 3, data not shown). Since these in vitro studies of T cell responses to TNF blockade all relied on monoclonal anti-CD3 stimulation, we tested whether TNF blockade could still elicit increased IL-10 + T cell responses in the context of a more physiological antigenic stimulation. Pediacel is a pentavalent vaccine consisting of purified diphtheria toxoid, purified tetanus toxoid, acellular pertussis vaccine, inactivated poliovirus, and Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide. Revaxis is a booster vaccine containing purified diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and inactivated poliovirus. Each vaccine was added to CD4 + T cell/monocyte cocultures (1:1,000 dilution) in the presence or absence of TNF blockade. After 6 days, antigen-stimulated CD4 + T cells cultured in the presence of adalimumab demonstrated elevated IL-10 + frequencies as compared to cells that were not exposed to TNF blockade ( Figure  S4 in Supplementary Material). Together these data demonstrate that in vitro TNF blockade provided at a physiological concentration and in a physiological setup can promote IL-10 expression in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, including in subsets expressing pro-inflammatory cytokines. TnF Blockade Maintains il-10 expression in cD4 + and cD8 + T cells Thus far, assessment of cytokine expression following in vitro TNF blockade was carried out after 3 days of culture. Time course experiments were performed to assess the kinetics of IL-10 expression in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. PBMC were cultured with anti-CD3 mAb in the absence or presence of adalimumab, and the frequencies of IL-10 expressing cells were analyzed 4-120 h after stimulation. The data show that early after TCR stimulation (18-24 h) the frequencies of IL-10 expressing cells within CD4 + and CD8 + T cells increased rapidly irrespective of the presence of TNF blockade. However, at later time points (from 42 to 120 h), higher frequencies of IL-10 + cells were sustained within CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the presence of TNF blockade (Figure 3) . These experiments suggest that TNF blockade maintains, rather than directly induces, an IL-10 + phenotype in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells following TCR stimulation. Blockade of TnFα, But not il-17, iFnγ, il-6r, or cD80/cD86-Mediated costimulation, regulates il-10 in human cD4 + T cells Our previous work demonstrated that in addition to adalimumab, other TNFα inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, or certolizumab) as well as TNFR1/2 blocking mAbs were capable of increasing frequencies of IL-10-expressing IL-17 + CD4 + T cells (20) . We investigated whether blockade of additional pro-inflammatory pathways could promote IL-10 expression in CD4 + T cells. Blockade of IL-17A did not enhance the frequencies of IL-10 + cells in any of the CD4 + T cell populations tested (Figure 4A) . Blockade of IFNγ did not affect the percentage of IL-10 + cells within total CD4 + T cells, or within IFNγ or TNFα + subpopulations, but led to modestly increased frequencies of IL-10 + expressing cells within the IL-17 + population, although this effect was much weaker than the effect of TNF blockade in parallel cultures ( Figure 4A) . Addition of tocilizumab (IL-6R blockade) or abatacept (CTLA4-Ig, which blocks CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation), both of which are biologic drugs routinely used in the clinic to treat rheumatoid arthritis, did not increase IL-10 + frequencies in CD4 + T cells, IL-17 + , IFNγ + , or TNFα + CD4 + T cell subpopulations (Figure 4B) . To determine whether blockade of these pathways might regulate IL-10 expression with different kinetics to TNF blockade, IL-10 + frequencies were analyzed within both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells at different time points in anti-CD3-stimulated PBMC cultures exposed to these antibodies or drugs. IL-10 + CD4 + and IL-10 + CD8 + T cell frequencies were not regulated at any time point by blockade of IL-17, IFNγ, IL-6R, or CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation ( Figure  S5 in Supplementary Material). Blockade of IL-1R1 in CD4 + T cell/monocyte cocultures resulted in a significantly increased proportion of IL-10 + cells within total CD4 + T cells and within IL-17 + , IFNγ + , or TNFα + subpopulations ( Figure 4B) . However, this effect was not replicated in either CD4 + or CD8 + T cells in whole PBMC cultures ( Figure S5 in Supplementary Material), indicating that the capacity of IL-1 blockade to regulate IL-10 expression may be dependent on the in vitro culture conditions. Together these data indicate that IL-10 expression in CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells can be regulated by blocking TNFα signaling, but not by blocking IFNγ, IL-17, IL-6R, or CD80/CD86-mediated co-stimulation, at least in vitro.
