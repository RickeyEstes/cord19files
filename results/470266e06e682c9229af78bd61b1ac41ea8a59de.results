Of the 19 samples analyzed, all were PCR-positive for GAPDH, and two (10.5%) were PCR-positive by generic universal hemoplasma conventional PCR. Only the same two samples were positive on speciesspecific PCR; both for 'Ca. M. haemominutum' only. All positive controls had expected amplified band in the generic universal and the species-specific conventional haemoplasma PCRs and distilled water as the negative control had none. Both of the positive samples were from old (14 and 15 years) male Persian leopards (Case numbers 13 and 14 in Table 1 ), from two different geographical areas of Iran. No hemoplasma organisms were observed on blood smear examination. The two hemoplasma ('Ca. M. haemominutum') infected Persian leopards were both also FIV seropositive, and one African lion was also FeLV and FIV positive but not hemoplasma infected. No other samples were retrovirus positive. To the authors' knowledge, no hematological reference ranges exist for Persian leopards, nor for any closely related species (e.g. African leopard, Arabian leopard), limiting interpretation of the hematology profiles of the Persian leopards in the current study. However, as shown in Table 2 , the hematology profiles of the two 'Ca. M. haemominutum' and FIV-seropositive Persian leopards (Case numbers 13 & 14) showed HCT, Hb, and RBC counts at the lower end of the reference range used for domestic cats, and HCT and RBC counts below the reference range calculated for African lions based on Larsson et. al. [22] , and were lower than those recorded in the non-infected Persian leopard (Case number 15). Thus it is possible that 'Ca. M. haemominutum' and FIV infection were associated with a reduction in erythrocyte indices in the infected cats, but further data from larger numbers of cats would be required to confirm this. The hematology profiles of the 12 African lions were also compared to the reference range calculated for African lions based on Larsson et. al. [22] , and 11 of the 12 lions had HCT and Hb values within or above the reference range. The FeLV and FIV seropositive but hemoplasma PCR negative lion had a hypochromic normocytic anemia (HCT 20.7%). The four remaining cases (Case numbers 16, 17, 18 and 19) could not have their hematological profiles determined due to sample hemolysis. The partial (1086 bp) 'Ca. M. haemominutum' 16S rRNA gene sequences derived for the two hemoplasma infected Persian leopards in the current study (KU852586 and KU852587) showed high sequence identity (97.7-99.45%) with, and were closely related to the 'Ca. M. haemominutum' sequences in Genbank derived from worldwide wild felids and domestic cats [9, [27] [28] [29] , including Iranian domestic cats. Data are shown in Fig. 1
