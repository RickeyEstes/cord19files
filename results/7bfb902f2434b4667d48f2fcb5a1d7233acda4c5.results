Rapid MCP-1 production during CHIKV infection in PBMCs. First, we confirmed that PBMCs secrete MCP-1 upon CHIKV infection. To this end, cells were infected with CHIKV-LR Opy-1 strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, 5 or 10. MCP-1 levels were measured over time in the cell supernatants (SN) while the cells were harvested for intracellular MCP-expression analysis at 24 hpi. Figure 1A shows a representative time course of MCP-1 levels following CHIKV infection (left panel) and an average of the maximum increase of MCP-1 scored for all donors at different time points (right panel) in the cell supernatant. CHIKV stimulated a rapid increase in MCP-production, with initial chemokine detectable levels at 6hpi. Despite some variability among donors in the MCP-1 basal expression, CHIKV infection increased the levels of MCP-1 on average 2-to 3-fold between 24-48 hpi. Intracellular staining of MCP-1 confirmed the increase in expression of MCP-1 following CHIKV infection (Fig. 1b) . Also, and in line with previous studies 37 , non-replicative, UV-inactivated CHIKV (UV-CHIKV) did not trigger an increase in MCP-1 expression inferring that CHIKV replication is required for MCP-1 induction in PBMCs. Error bars show s.e.m. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test was used for statistical analysis.

At least three different donors were analysed, n ≥ 3. Scientific RepoRts | 6:32288 | DOI: 10.1038/srep32288 Monocytes are the primary source of MCP-1 during CHIKV infection in PBMCs. We next sought to disclose the cellular source of MCP-1 following CHIKV infection of PBMCs. Within blood, CD14 + monocytes are believed to be the major source of MCP-1 38 . Nonetheless, Her et al. reported that monocytes do not produce MCP-1 following CHIKV infection 37 . To elucidate the source of the chemokine upon CHIKV infection, mock and CHIKV-infected PBMCs were subjected to flow cytometric analysis as described in Methods section. As CHIKV is known to cause cytopathic effects in some cells, we first assessed the viability of the cells following infection and its effect on CD14 expression at 24 hpi. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 , we did not observe changes in cell viability or CD14 expression as a result of CHIKV infection. At 48 hours post infection levels of CD14 decreased in all experimental conditions (data not shown). Next, we gated the CD14 + (monocytes) vs CD14 − (non-monocytes) cells and compared MCP-1 expression levels following CHIKV infection. Surprisingly, increased MCP-1 expression levels were found following active CHIKV infection in monocytes (Fig. 2a) , suggesting that these cells are the source of MCP-1 production. Monocytes have been also proposed to be the cellular vehicle for virus dissemination 4,16,37 and therefore we aimed to investigate whether intracellular MCP-1 expression was restricted to only infected monocytes. Accordingly, we performed flow cytometric analysis to search for CHIKV E2 and MCP-1-positive PBMCs. Disappointingly; the frequencies of CHIKV + monocytes were negligibly low at conditions with high MCP-1 expression. At MOIs high enough to detect convincing numbers of CHIKV + monocytes (MOI 50 and higher, data not shown) however, we did not observe increase in MCP-1 secretion (nor expression), signifying that infection at such high MOI changes cytokine pattern considerably 39 . To verify that CD14 + cells are indeed the main source of MCP-1 during CHIKV infection in PBMCs, we compared it to the levels of MCP-1 secreted by monocytes and monocyte-depleted PBMCs (MoΔ PBMCs) from the corresponding donors (Fig. 2b) . Counterintuitively however, no MCP-1 stimulation was observed upon infection of monocytes (Fig. 2b ) at any MOI tested ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Nonetheless, depletion of monocytes (on average 96% CD14 + cells was depleted) abrogated CHIKV-mediated secretion of the chemokine (Fig. 2b) . Incubation of non-infected monocytes with the SN of infected MoΔ PBMCs also did not stimulate MCP-1 production (not depicted), confirming that infection of monocytes was imperative to lead to the production of this chemokine. Addition of IL-6, used as a positive control, stimulated MCP-1 production in all cell preparations (Fig. 2c) , indicating that positive selection did not affect the capacity of the cells to produce MCP-1 and was not the reason for the lack of MCP-1 secretion by infected monocytes. Thus far, these results implied that presence of other leukocytes was crucial for the chemokine production in the context of CHIKV infection. To test this, infected monocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of non-infected or infected MoΔ PBMCs in a transwell co-culture system. In agreement with the data presented in Fig. 2b , neither monocytes nor MoΔ PBMCs secreted MCP-1 upon CHIKV infection ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). In contrast, when infected monocytes could exchange soluble factors with other leukocytes, a significant increase (p < 0.5) in MCP-1production was observed ( Fig. 2d left panel). In effect, the increase in the chemokine levels was comparable to that found in the infected PBMCs of the corresponding donors ( Fig. 2d right panel) , although the additive role of the cell-to cell contact cannot be excluded. Notably, the increase of MCP-1 was observed regardless of whether MoΔ PBMCs were exposed to the virus or not. Altogether, these data suggest that CHIKV infection of monocytes triggers a communication loop with other leukocytes that ultimately leads to MCP-1 upregulation and production in monocytes. Monocytes require IFNβ-mediated communication with other leukocytes to produce MCP-1 in response to CHIKV infection. Next, we sought to disclose the soluble factor involved in MCP-1 upregulation. It has been proposed that IFN type I can modulate MCP-1 secretion in a concentration-dependent manner 23, 40 . Type I IFNs are also readily produced in course of CHIKV infection 37 . Analysis of SN of PBMCs and monocytes revealed that CHIKV infection triggers MOI-dependent production of IFNβ but not that of IFNα ( Supplementary Figs S4 and S5 ). Therefore, we hypothesized that IFNβ stimulation via IFNα β receptor (IFNAR) played a role in CHIKV infection mediated MCP-1 production in PBMCs. Indeed, pre-incubation of these cells with α IFNAR1/2 antibody abolished CHIKV-mediated MCP-1 production (Fig. 3a) . A similar effect was achieved when JAK1/2-STAT signalling downstream of IFNAR was inhibited by Ruxolitinib (Rux) during CHIKV infection and/or IFNβ stimulation (Fig. 3b) . Together, these results strongly suggest that IFNβ -mediated signalling is responsible for the MCP-1 production in course of the infection. To substantiate the role of IFNβ in the communication between monocytes and other leukocytes, we next tested whether stimulation of MoΔ PBMCs with IFNβ alone for 4 hours prior to their co-culture with monocytes could induce MCP-1 secretion in monocytes. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3c , addition of IFNβ -pre-treated MoΔ PBMCs (washed cells) to monocyte monoculture increased levels of the chemokine after 24 hours of co-culture. As expected, stimulation of MoΔ PBMCs with IFNβ did not result in MCP-1 production in the absence of monocytes. In summary, we propose a model of IFNβ -driven communication of infected monocytes with other leukocytes that is essential for MCP-1 secretion upon CHIKV infection in PBMCs (Fig. 4) .
