Fecal samples were collected from 1045 calves on the 11 farms. The number of calves per farm enrolled in the study ranged from 4 to 521 (median 32). For 126 calves, data on C. parvum status were missing for one or more of the 4 weeks. Reasons for missing data included difficulties locating calves during a farm visit, removal of calves from farms (sale or transfer) and death of calves. There was no significant difference in the risk of shedding or diarrhea between these calves and the calves for which data was available for all 4 weeks. In addition, examination of the data showed no significant difference in management for the two sets of calves. Of the 919 calves for which no data were missing, 721 (78%) tested positive for C. parvum at one or more sampling times. Oocysts were detected in fecal samples of calves from all of the 11 farms. Within-herd prevalence of shedding ranged from 35% to 100%. Calves under 1 week old were least likely to be shedding C. parvum oocysts (prevalence = 5%), while calves aged 7-14 days had the highest prevalence (53%) of shedding. Shedding of oocysts was moderately clustered within herds; the intra-class correlation coefficient (rho) for shedding was 0.4. For 199 calves, data on consistency of one or more fecal sample were missing. Reasons for this were similar to those stated for missing C. parvum data. Of the remaining 846 animals, 619 (73%) were diarrheic at the time of collection of at least one sample. Scouring was most prevalent in calves at the time of the second sampling (aged 7-14 days) and was least prevalent in calves less than 1 week old; samples from 47% of calves aged 7-14 days were scored as 3 or 4, while only 15% of calves under 1 week old were diarrheic at the time of sampling. The prevalence of bacterial and viral enteropathogens is summarized in Table 1 . Table 2a shows the results of unconditional screening of predictor variables for association with C. parvum shedding.
