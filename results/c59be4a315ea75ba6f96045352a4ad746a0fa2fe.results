The primary researcher started the interviews by asking participants about their views regarding work during day-to-day operations. He then asked participants to compare that work with working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks. This question helped the researcher to understand the participants' views on how working during disasters and disease outbreaks differ from day-to-day operations. All participants viewed day-to-day operations as "another day of work" where they provide care for sick and injured patients. Their call volume could vary significantly. Their work shifts could be very slow or very busy, which depends on many factors such as the time of day, day of the week, season, location of the EMS unit, and average call volume in each particular unit. Their views to working during natural disasters and disease outbreaks are significantly different however.
