The demography and characteristic profiles of the study population are summarized in Table 1 . Initial screening for anti-MERS-CoV antibodies using IgG rS1-ELISA revealed 10/4719 (0.21%) and 1/135 (0.74%) reactive samples from BD (three borderline and seven positive samples) and CC, respectively. On the other hand, 3/4 CP (75.0%) were reactive with IgG rS1-ELISA assay ( Figure 1 ; Table 2 ). Since CC samples were collected within the first week of primary case identification, samples were also tested by IgM-IIFT and all were negative. As recommended by the WHO, borderline and reactive samples were then tested for the presence of anti-MERS-CoV IgG using whole-virus and recombinant (r) S1-IIFT. Analysis with whole-virus IgG-IIFT confirmed only two (2/10) samples from BD as well as three (3/4) samples from CP. Interestingly, none (0/10) of the above BD reactive samples tested positive with neither rS1-IIFT nor ppNT assay. The positive IgG rS1-ELISA CC sample was only tested by ppNT and it was positive. All of the randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA negative BD samples were also negative by whole-virus and rS1 IgG-IIFT (Tables 3 and 4) . To determine the status of infection (recent versus older), all IgG rS1-ELISA reactive samples were further evaluated for the presence of IgM antibodies as an indication for recent infections using whole-virus IIFT (IgM-IIFT), and only one was marginally reactive and that was from a CP (Table 4 ). Strikingly, one of the 13 randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA IgG-negative BD samples from the initial screening was found reactive for IgM antibodies (using IgM-IIFT) with a titer of 320. Positivity of this sample was further confirmed with ppNT, with EC50 titer of 500 (Table 3 ). The sample was obtained from a 35-year-old Syrian citizen residing in Qatar. Discrepancies in the results obtained from different binding assays could be due to cross-reactivity with other viruses. Hence, we evaluated the cross-reactivity of rS1-ELISAreactive samples for IgG antibodies against all currently known human coronaviruses. All tested BD samples including the negative controls from the initial screening exhibited
