Between January and December 2012, 1036 eligible participants were enrolled across the four sites (Table 1) . Results from 25 participants were excluded from analysis for the following reasons: two for having more than two contaminated cultures; five were culture-positive but missing results of MPT64; 13 had a single positive culture after >28 days or <20 colonies; two were missing smear results; three were found to be culture-positive and NTM but only at follow-up. Across all sites, there were 375 culture-positive TB cases, 477 non-TB participants, 43 with clinically diagnosed TB, and 69 with possible TB. These were the 964 participants and 1928 sputum samples in the primary analysis ( Figure 2 ). There were 38 participants with NTM (29/38) or mixed MTB-NTM infections (9/38) who were analyzed separately (Table 2) . Also analyzed separately were nine FM smear-positive, culture-negative individuals. The follow-up rate among individuals with a positive TB-LAMP and all negative smear/culture results was 75% (15/20), while the follow-up rate among participants with negative results on all tests was 67% (381/572) ( Table 1 ). The overall follow-up rate for those with negative smear/culture results in South Africa was 93% (169/ 182) and in Peru was 99% (153/154), while in Vietnam it was only 62% (63/102). In Brazil, 79% (11/14) of participants with a positive TB-LAMP and negative smear/culture were followed up, but none of those who were negative on all tests were followed up due to programmatic restrictions. The overall TB-LAMP indeterminate rate was 0.3%. Two out of 2081 TB-LAMP tests performed could not be interpreted after two readings and four had a positive result from the negative control, indicating likely DNA contamination for that run of the assay. All had clear positive or negative results after repetition of the TB-LAMP assay on the same sputum. For the 375 participants with culture-positive TB and with two sputum samples each (750 samples Nine hundred and forty-two of 954 sputum samples from 477 non-TB participants tested negative on TB-LAMP, giving an overall specificity of 98.7% (95% CI 97.9-99.6%) ( Table 3) . Inclusion of follow-up information made the greatest impact in Brazil where specificity was 97.2% (282/290; 95% CI 95.2-99.3%) but only 94.7% (286/302; 95% CI 91.8-97.6%) exclusive of follow-up (i.e., inclusive only of initial clinical and laboratory findings and whether the individual was immediately put on treatment). In Vietnam, specificity also improved with the inclusion of follow-up (98.3%; 118/120; 95% CI 95.0-100%). Specificity in Peru was 99.6% (279/ 280; 95% CI 98.9-100%) and in South Africa was also 99.6% (263/ 264; 95% CI 98.9-100%); at these sites, specificity was similar irrespective of whether follow-up data were considered or not. Only South Africa had a significant number of HIV-positive individuals (35.5%). The overall sensitivity of TB-LAMP in sputum samples from culture-positive, HIV-positive participants was 51.9% (28/54; 95% CI 34.1-69.6%). By smear status, in HIV-positive participants, sensitivity was 100% (19/19; 95% CI 82.4-100%) in smear-positive samples and 26.3% (9/35; 95% CI 8.6-42.9%) in smear-negative samples. The performance of TB-LAMP was compared to that of Xpert MTB/RIF (Table 4 ). In this study, overall sensitivity in smear-
