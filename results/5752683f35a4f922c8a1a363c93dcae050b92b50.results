For this study, we used SEM to verify whether TPB can explain the intention of people to have their dogs vaccinated and whether knowledge of rabies can positively affect people's attitude and perceived behavioral control. Besides that, we tried to review the relationships of these variables and find a determinant to explain the dog owners' intention. We employed LISREL 8.7 to achieve this goal.
