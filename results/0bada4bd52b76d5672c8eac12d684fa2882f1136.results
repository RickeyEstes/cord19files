The UVC-treated BR (geometric mean [GM] = 153.2 colony forming units [CFU]/m 3 , geometric SD [GSD] = 1.7) had a 35.2% reduction in aerobic bacterial bioaerosol concentration compared with the control BR (GM = 236.5 CFU/m 3 , GSD = 1.44) (Fig 1) . This difference was even more pronounced for anaerobic bacterial bioaerosols, where the UVC-treated BR (GM = 45 CFU/m 3 , GSD = 2.4) had a 47.7% reduction compared with the control BR (GM = 86 CFU/m 3 , GSD = 2.8). The mean bacterial concentration on the UVC-treated BR counter (GM = 1.6 CFU/[10 cm] 2 , GSD = 2.2) was reduced by approximately 95% compared with the control BR counter (GM = 31.0 CFU/10 cm 2 , GSD = 3.1) (Fig 2) . The greatest effect was seen for surface seat bacteria, with a 97% reduction in the UVC-treated BR (GM = 7.7 CFU/ [10 cm] 2 , GSD = 5.5) compared with the control BR (GM = 224 CFU/ [10 cm] 2 , GSD = 7.5). Two outliers collected from the toilet seat of the control BR had concentrations >2,000 CFU/(10 cm) 2 (not shown in Fig 2) . These outlier samples may represent highly contaminated droplets deposited onto the seat after flushing.
