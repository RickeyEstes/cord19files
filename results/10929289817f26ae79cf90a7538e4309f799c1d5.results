The final sampling consisted of 79 heifer calves and 21 bull calves, mainly of Ayrshire breed (79%; Holstein Friesian 19%, mixed breeds 2%). The calves were equally sampled according to their age (age in weeks shown in Fig. 1 ). Diarrhoea was most frequently diagnosed in calves, but umbilical infections (9.6%; 95% CI 5.5-16.0%) and respiratory tract infections (6.3%, 2.9-11.7%) were also common. Joint lesions were observed in 2.8% (0.8-7.1%) of the calves. No signs of disease were observed in 63.3% (54.9-71.3%) of the calves. No difference in observed pathogens with respect to age of calves was observed (shown in Fig. 1 ).
