Preparation of recombinant USP14 proteins and selection of RNA aptamers. We previously showed that yeast and mammalian USP14, a proteasome-associated DUB enzyme, functions as an endogenous inhibitor of proteasomes 6, 7 . The Ub chain-trimming effect of USP14 might antagonize the degradation of many proteasome substrates, with small molecule inhibitors facilitating proteolysis. However, small molecule inhibitors exhibit relatively high cytotoxicity and low inhibitory efficacy 7 . To identify USP14 aptamers, we used SELEX techniques with GST-USP14 (78 kDa), while USP14 (53 kDa) was also expressed and purified for subsequent analysis with aptamers and proteasomes (Fig. 1A) . To select for RNA aptamers with a high affinity that were specific to USP14, we generated a pool of RNAs (approximately 10 14 molecules) containing a 40 nt random core sequence that was flanked by the T7 promoter site at the 5′ end and primer-binding sites at the 3′ end (Fig. 1B) 16 . Prior to initial screening, we performed negative selection over 15 rounds to remove non-specific RNAs bound to the glutathione-sepharose resin or to GST proteins from the RNA pool (Fig. 1C) . The stringency of RNA binding to the USP14 protein was increased as the rounds progressed (see Methods). Human 26S proteasomes were purified from a HEK293-derived cell line that stably expressed polyhistidine-and biotin-tagged β 4 subunits 26 . Purified proteasomes showed an approximate 1:1 molar ratio between the RP and CP complexes (Fig. 1D) . Basal deubiquitinating activity of USP14 is strongly activated by proteasomes, although the subunit responsible for activation remains to be elucidated 4, 21 . The majority of proteasomal deubiquitinating activity was irreversibly blocked using Ub-vme 5 , which forms an adduct with Cys in the active site of the thiol protease DUB. The resulting vme-proteasomes appeared to retain the components of normal 26S proteasomes (Fig. 1D) . Large amounts of USP14 were co-purified with the RP of proteasomes (Fig. 1E ). When covalently modified by Ub-vme, the electrophoretic mobility of USP14 was reduced by 7.5 kDa, which corresponded to the size of Ub (Fig. 1E) , which indicates that the DUB enzymes on the proteasomes, including USP14, were fully inactivated. Identification of USP14 aptamers and their inhibitory effects on deubiquitinating activity. We examined the RNA sequences of 20 randomly selected clones, and identified three different aptamers. These RNA aptamers were designated USP14-1, USP14-2, and USP14-3, and represented 30 (6/20) , 45 (9/20), and 25% (5/20) respectively, of the identified aptamers ( Fig. 2A) . All of the aptamers contained conserved sequences and similar structural motifs, as predicted by Mfold 27 . In addition to two stem-loops in their secondary structures (Fig. 2B) , there was a sequence of five conserved nucleotides Prior to activation by vme-PTSM (1 nM), various concentrations of USP14 proteins were pre-incubated with RNA aptamers (1 μ g/mL). As a control, 1 μ g/mL random RNA pools were used. Note that USP14 alone (without activation by proteasomes) showed only basal Ub-rho hydrolysis activity. (E) Ub-rho110 hydrolysis by various deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in the presence or absence of USP14 aptamers (1 μ g/mL). (F) Ub-rho110 hydrolysis as in (D), except that USP14-3, at various concentrations, was incubated with USP14 (10 nM) or USP14(C114A) (10 nM) and vme-PTSM (1 nM). (G) The deubiquitinating activity of USP14 was monitored by Ub-rho110 (20 nM) hydrolysis in the presence of PTSMs and 1 μ g/mL USP14 aptamers. The original RNA aptamer library (random RNA pool) was used as a control. All data represent the mean ± SD from three independent experiments. *p < 0.01 (one-way analysis of variance ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison test). RFU, relative fluorescence unit. PTSM, 26S human proteasomes. vme-PTSM, Ubvme-treated 26S human proteasomes. (GGAGG), followed by a G-rich sequence. Our results suggest that the exposed GGAGG and G-rich sequences in RNA aptamers could be important for interactions with USP14. None of the USP14 RNA aptamers was found to bind to GST-tagged proteins from the binding assay similar to the SELEX strategy (Fig. 2C) , however they all exhibited a high affinity to USP14. The control RNA aptamers did not bind to USP14 (Fig. 2C) . Mutations in the consensus GGAGG and G-rich sequences in the USP14 RNA aptamers abolished their ability to bind to USP14 (Fig. 2C) . These findings suggest that the exposure of GGAGG and G-rich sequences in RNA aptamers is critical for their interaction with USP14. To investigate the effects of USP14 aptamers on USP14-mediated deubiquitinating activity, the RNA aptamers were transcribed and purified in vitro. We used recombinant USP14 proteins and vme-proteasomes for hydrolysis of Ub-rho110, a highly sensitive fluorogenic substrate of DUBs. In the absence of vme-proteasomes, USP14 exhibited little deubiquitinating activity. In contrast, USP14 was activated in the presence of vme-proteasomes, exhibiting higher Ub-rho110 hydrolysis activity than for vme-proteasomes alone (Fig. 2D ). The addition of USP14-1, USP14-2, or USP14-3 to the reaction resulted in a decrease in USP14 deubiquitinating activity ( Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. 1) . Inhibition of deubiquitinating activity by USP14 aptamers was specific to USP14, with the USP14-3 aptamer failing to inhibit the DUB activity of UCHL3, USP47, USP5, and UCHL5/UCH37 (Fig. 2E ). USP14-3 inhibited USP14 deubiquitinating activity in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. 2) . The catalytically inactive mutant of USP14, USP14(C114A), exhibited little deubiquitinating activity and was unaffected by the USP14 aptamers (Fig. 2D,F) , indicating that the USP14 aptamers specifically inhibit USP14 DUB activity. Using Ub-rho110, we also measured the enzyme kinetics of recombinant USP14 with vme-proteasomes in the presence and absence of the aptamers (Supplementary Fig. 3) . The K M of USP14 bound to the aptamers (1716 ± 300 nM) was significantly higher than that for free USP14 (1124 ± 248 nM). However, k cat values were comparable regardless of whether USP14 aptamers were present (0.948 ± 0.079 s −1 for USP14-3 vs. 0.938 ± 0.073 s −1 for control RNA aptamers), suggesting that the USP14 aptamers might affect substrate binding to USP14 to a greater extent than deubiquitinating activity. Further work will be required to determine the mechanism of inhibition of the USP14 aptamers. Our results strongly indicate that the newly identified USP14 aptamers effectively inhibit the deubiquitinating activity of USP14 in vitro. We tested whether the total deubiquitinating activity of the proteasome was affected by the three USP14 aptamers. Proteasomes that were not treated with Ub-vme showed significant deubiquitinating activity, possibly from USP14 and UCH37, another proteasomal DUB that interacts with RPN13 3 (Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. 4) . The enzymatic redundancy between these two enzymes on the proteasome is unclear, but is considered insignificant because UCH37 exhibits much weaker Ub hydrolysis activity than USP14 7 . Addition of the USP14 aptamers strongly inhibited proteasome-mediated Ub-rho110 hydrolysis ( Fig. 2G and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). USP14-3 showed the strongest inhibitory activity for all tested proteasome concentrations. The strong inhibition exhibited by USP14-3 could be a result of its ability to simultaneously bind to UCH37 (data not shown). This would indicate that UCH37 plays a more significant role in deubiquitinating polyubiquitinated substrates than previously thought 3 . Further study is required to determine whether chain-trimming by UCH37 can suppress proteasome activity as effectively as USP14. Taken together, our results provide strong evidence that USP14 RNA aptamers block the activity of USP14 and proteasomal DUBs.
