Preliminary tests to establish a sensitive cell system for virus replication were performed before animal inoculation and virus isolation. SARS-CoV replicated in Vero E6, Vero V76, and PT-K75 approximately to the same titer. QT-35 did not replicate SARS-CoV. Although CEKEC did not show any CPE, the virus replicated in those cells up to the approximate titer of 10 6 , based on positive RT-PCR results on lysed cells and cell culture supernatant harvested 54 h after inoculation.
