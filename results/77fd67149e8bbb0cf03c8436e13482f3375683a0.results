None of the sows showed any signs of clinical disease throughout the experimental period. The two control sows delivered a total of 29 liveborn and 1 stillborn piglet. The two infected sows delivered 23 liveborn and 3 stillborn piglets. One infected piglet died on day 11 PI. At necropsy, the control piglets neither showed signs of macro-nor microscopical pathological lesions. In the infected group, gross lung lesions characterised by multi-focal tan-mottled areas were observed in six of eight piglets, four of eight piglets and four of six piglets necropsied at 2, 4 and 6 weeks of age, respectively. Furthermore, histopathological examination showed interstitial pneumonia of varying intensity in all infected piglets. The observed lung lesions were typical for PRRSV-induced pneumonia (Halbur et al., 1995; Lager and Halbur, 1996; Kranker et al., 1998) . Peritonitis was observed in one 4-and one 6-week-old piglet as well as pleuritis in a 6-weekold piglet, all three from infected sow 208.
