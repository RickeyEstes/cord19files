Screening Potential MAGE-G1-interacting Proteins by SILAC-Immunoprecipitation Quantitative Proteomics Approach. A P19 cell line which stably expressed the Flag-tagged mouse MAGE-G1 was generated, and then the specific MAGE-G1 interactome formed in P19 cells during RA-induced neuronal differentiation was screened using the SILAC-based quantitative proteomic approach. Briefly (Fig. 1a) , the P19 cells expressing Flag-MAGE-G1 were grown in the "heavy" medium containing 13 C 6 L-lysine, whereas the control cells (transfected with empty vector) were maintained in "light" medium containing 12 C 6 L-lysine. P19 cells were treated with RA for 6 days to induce neuronal differentiation, and then the proteins were extracted from each group and mixed in a ratio of 1:1 based on the total protein mass. Anti-Flag beads were added to immunoprecipitate the MAGE-G1 interacting complex followed by SDS-PAGE separation (Fig. 1b) , in-gel trypsin digestion, and LC-MS/MS analysis. Immunoblotting was conducted to confirm whether Flag-MAGE-G1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (Fig. 1c ).
