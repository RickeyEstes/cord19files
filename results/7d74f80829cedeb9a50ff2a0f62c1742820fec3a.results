We studied 200 children that presented to Children Hospital of Cairo University ED with acute wheezy chest. The patients' condition varies from requiring nebulizer at the ED, hospital admission and oxygen supplementation to pediatric intensive care admission for infusion therapies or mechanical ventilation. The studied patients were 122 male and 78 female aged 2 months to 5 years. By PCR method, 163 patients (81.5%) were positive for viral infection and 37 (18.5%) patients were negative. From the 163 viral infected patients 56 patients (34.4%) had single infection, while 107 patients (65.6%) had co-infection with more than one virus. RSV affected 49.5% (99 cases), followed by HRV 43.5% (87 cases) ( Table 1) . All the demographic and clinical data of cases were demonstrated in Table 2 . The median age of patients who were positive for Rhinovirus was younger than Rhinovirus negative patients, and this was statistically significant. Regarding clinical data cough, grunting, fever and vomiting were more prevalent among HRV +ve patients p = 0.001; 0.89; 0.001 and 0.445; respectively, while cyanosis and diarrhea were more prevalent among HRV -ve patients p = 0.032 and 0.581; respectively. Patients with history of recurrent wheezes (60.1%) were more common than patients with first-time wheeze (39.9%), p = 0.001 as shown in Table 3 . Recurrent attacks of wheezes were more common among HRV +ve cases (70.5%) compared to other viruses (59.9%), a difference which was statistically significant p = 0.024. There was a statistically significant difference between the frequency of Rhinovirus positive and negative patients throughout the studied period. Rhinovirus was most frequently detected throughout the winter months from December to February, as shown in Fig. 1 . Table 4 comparing the fate between patients positive for Rhinovirus and negative for Rhinovirus among virus positive patients: There was no significant difference regarding the illness severity between patients infected with HRV compared to other viruses: All patients who tested positive for Rhinovirus infection by PCR were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with 80.5% needing mechanical ventilation while 96.5% of patients who tested negative for Rhinovirus by PCR required ICU admission with 70% needing mechanical ventilation, p = 0.076. As regards outcome there was statistically significant difference in outcome between Rhinovirus positive and negative cases. Mortality rate was higher among HRV positive cases 38 (43.7%) vs 26 (38.3%), p = 0.024.
