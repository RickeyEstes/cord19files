Out of 1109 students who answered the questionnaires, 589/1109 (53.1%) were male and 520/1109 (46.9%) were female. 62.7% of the participants were university students and 37.2% were school students. Among university students, 297 (42%) were male and 399 (57%) were female. However, 292 (70.7%) of the school students were male as compared to 121 (29.3%) who were female. The mean age of the university students was 22.3 (SD: 3.17) whereas the mean age of the school students was 17.3 (SD: 0.97). Table 1 illustrates risk perception of MERS among the students. An attitude of concern about the disease can be generally observed whereas only a minority reported having no concerns. More males than females regard MERS as a very dangerous disease, although there is no statistically significant difference in risk perception between university and school students of either genders. Knowledge about clinical presentation of the disease is detailed in Table 2 . Among university students of both genders, there is an overall agreement about responses. However, female university students showed a slightly better understanding of clinical presentation of MERS when compared to male university students. This trend can also be observed among high school female students who showed a higher level of knowledge about the clinical presentation of the disease as compared to male students. The majority of students reported fever and shortness of breath as factors in the clinical presentation of MERS. Apart from reporting cough and nasal and throat congestion, knowledge about clinical presentation of MERS is generally similar among university and school students. Table 3 details knowledge about modes of transmission of MERS-CoV. There is a similar level of knowledge about mode of transmission among university and school students. The most frequently reported source of transmission is entering crowded spaces and exposure to coughing and sneezing. The proportion of students who think handshaking is a mode of transmission is lower than those who think touching surfaces might increase risk of infection. Moreover, only 40% of the participants believe camels are associated with the risk of MERS-CoV infection. As illustrated in Table 4 , the most frequently reported method of protection against virus transmission is hand washing (81% among university students and 75.3% among school students). Additionally, avoiding contact with an infected person was frequently indicated as a prevention method. Nevertheless, a higher proportion of students either questioned or were unaware of the importance of wearing a facemask as a protective method. Similarly, 30% of the participants did not suggest using tissues as a method of prevention. Unlike other components of measuring knowledge about the disease, university students appear to have a higher level of knowledge about protection methods weighed against school students. This notion was evident from responses relating to protection methods such as not touching mucosal membranes, usage of tissues and hand washing. Fig. 1 depicts how social activities are affected by knowledge of MERS. The activity most affected is visiting hospitals followed by traveling for the festivals of Omrah and Hajj. The social activity least affected is visiting family and friends. Apart from going for school, responses to affected activities are generally similar among university and school students. The most frequently reported source of knowledge about MERS is television. Twitter is the most frequently cited source of knowledge among social media followed by Whatsapp. About half of the participants reported visiting the Saudi Ministry of Health website as a source of knowledge. Against other media, family doctors appear to be a less favoured option for gathering knowledge (Fig. 2) .
