Sequence analysis of the TMD of coronavirus spike proteins reveals a high conservation rate. In Figure 1A , an alignment is shown of the transmembrane domains of several coronavirus spike proteins, of which at least one virus of each group is included. Evidently, the aromatic and cysteine domains are conserved between CoVs. To investigate the roles of the aromatic domain in SARS CoV spike-mediated entry, we performed an extensive muta-genesis on the spike TMD. The mutants that were generated are listed in Figure 1B .
