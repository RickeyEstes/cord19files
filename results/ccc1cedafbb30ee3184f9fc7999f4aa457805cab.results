Our line list comprised 507 patients reported from Jan 13, to Jan 31, 2020, including 364 (72%) from mainland China and 143 (28%) from outside of China (table) The age distribution of COVID-19 cases was skewed towards older age groups with a median age of 45 years (IQR 33-56) for patients who were alive or who had an unknown outcome at the time of reporting (figure 1). The median age of patients who had died at the time of reporting was 70 years (IQR 65-81). Few patients (13 [3%]) were younger than 15 years. Adjustment for the age demographics of China confirmed a deficit of infections among children, with a RR below 0·5 in patients younger than 15 years (figure 1). The RR measure indicated a sharp increase in the likelihood of reported COVID-19 among people aged 30 years and older. A timeline of cases in our crowdsourced patient line list is shown by date of onset in figure 2 , indicating an acceleration of reported cases by Jan 13, 2020. The outbreak progression based on the crowdsourced patient line list was consistent with the timeline published by China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Jan 28, 2020, 12 which is based on a more comprehensive database of more than 6000 patients with COVID-19. Since Jan 23, 2020, the cumulative number of cases has slowed down in the crowdsourced and China CDC curves (figure 2), which probably reflects the delay between disease onset and reporting. The median reporting delay was 5 days (IQR 3-8) in our data. Province-level epidemic curves are shown by reporting date in figure 3 . As of Jan 31, 2020, 16 (52%) of 30 provinces in mainland China had reported more than 100 confirmed cases. The apparent rapid growth of newly reported cases between Jan 18, and Jan 31, 2020, in several provinces outside of Hubei province is consistent with sustained local transmission. Across the study period, the median delay between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic was 2 days (IQR 0-5 days) in mainland China ( figure 4 ). This delay decreased from 5 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter (Wilcoxon test p=0·0009). Some provinces, such as Tianjin and Yunnan had shorter delays (data by province not shown), while the early cases from Hubei province were characterised by longer delays in seeking care (median 0 days [IQR 0-1]). The median delay between seeking care at a hospital or clinic and reporting was 2 days (IQR 2-5 days) in mainland China and decreased from 9 days before Jan 18, 2020, to 2 days thereafter (Wilcoxon test p<0·0001; figure 4 ). Similarly to delays in seeking care at a hospital or clinic, reporting was quickest in Tianjin and Yunnan (median 1 day [IQR 0-1]) and slowest in Hubei province (median 12 days [IQR 7-16]). The median delay between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic was 1 day (IQR 0-3) for international travellers, and shorter than for patients in Hubei province or the rest of mainland China (Kruskal-Wallis test p<0·0001; figure 4) . Even in the period after Jan 18, 2020, when awareness of the outbreak increased, a shorter delay between symptom onset and seeking care at a hospital or clinic was seen for international patients than for those in mainland China (Wilcoxon test p<0·0001). For international cases, the delay between seeking care at a hospital or clinic and reporting was 2 days (IQR 1-4), also shorter than for mainland China (Wilcoxon test p<0·0001; figure 4) . On the basis of 33 patients with a travel history to Wuhan, we estimated the median incubation period for COVID-19 to be 4·5 days (IQR 3·0-5·5; appendix p 2).
