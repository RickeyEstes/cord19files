A total number of 2120 pilgrims were enrolled in the current study: 736 Saudi (436 males and 300 females) and 1384 non-Saudi Arabian pilgrims (909 males and 475 females). About 44% (333/736) of the Saudi and 43% (595/1384) of the non-Saudi pilgrims hold a high level of education; a bachelor degree or higher. The major source of information included the official websites of health organizations (39.54%, 49.49%) followed by the social media (25.95, 20.23) for Saudi and non-Saudi pilgrims, respectively, with no statistical significance detected between the Saudi and non-Saudi pilgrims (Table 1 ). Both groups of pilgrims (n: 2120) were first screened for the overall knowledge and awareness toward MERS-CoV. Results showed incorrect knowledge and awareness when asking the whole pilgrims about the following information: MERS-CoV appears in certain time in the year, MERS-CoV is a fatal disease to any person, the animal source of the disease, the probability of camel meat and milk to transmit the disease, whether people should be screened after coming in contact with laboratoryconfirmed cases and the presence of available vaccine and antiviral for the MERS-CoV ( Figure 1 ). On comparing the Saudi and non-Saudi Arab pilgrims, the level of knowledge was changed according to whether the tested participants were Saudi or not. The Saudi pilgrims showed significant differences in the level of knowledge than non-Saudi Arabian pilgrims in the following topics: The nature of MERS-CoV (79.35% vs. 61.78%, %, P = 0.042), the signs of the disease and its similarity to flu (78.94 vs. 65.17%, P < 0.001), the severity of the disease (55.3% vs. 35.48%. P = 0.036) and the animals that could transmit the disease (48.37% vs. 28.54%, P = 0.015), ( Table 2) . Both groups showed a low level of knowledge regarding the seasonal nature of the disease, and camel milk and meat as possible sources of disease transmission ( Table 2) . No significant differences were detected among male and female participants in both groups ( Table 2 ). The Saudi pilgrims showed higher level of knowledge regarding the fact that being health-care workers is a risk factor (68.61 vs. 48.55, P < 0.001) and the necessity for screening for MERS-CoV when being in contact with the infected persons (61.01 vs. 46.46, P = 0.009). There was no significant differences between Saudi and non-Saudi Arabian pilgrims regarding the absence of an effective antiviral treatment (46.60 vs. 27.38) and the absence of an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV (38.99 vs. 22.54) ( Table 3) . No significant correlation was detected among different questions.
