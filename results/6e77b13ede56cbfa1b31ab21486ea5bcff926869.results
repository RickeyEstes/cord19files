A total of 155 NPA specimens from SARS patients were tested for hMPV (86 HCWs, 47 patients and 22 visitors). hMPV RNA was detected in 31 (20%) SARS cases. An hMPV outbreak had occurred during 6-16 March 2003, corresponding to the first week of the SARS epidemic. By 16 March, co-infection occurred in 31% of SARS patients. The epidemic curves for both hMPV and SARS-CoV infections are shown in Fig. 1 . Clinical and epidemiological features were compared between SARS patients with or without hMPV co-infection (Table 1) . We noted that 77.4% of hMPV co-infections were linked to the index ward X (HCW = 19, patient = 1, and visitor = 4; a few cases had no such exposure-see footnotes of b Among the seven hMPV-infected patients who had never visited index ward X, four were linked to the emergency room, and two to different medical wards. The last patient was a deployed nurse who looked after the initial batch of sick health-care workers in a separate cohort ward, and subsequently developed symptoms. Table 1 ). Previously healthy HCWs [doctors (n = 10), medical students (n = 7), and nurses (n = 6)] were predominantly (74.2%) involved. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that being a HCW (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.11-6.68; p = 0.029) or epidemiological linkage to the index ward X (OR 3.59, 95% CI 1.42-9.05; p = 0.007) were independent risk factors for hMPV co-infection, after adjusting for baseline characteristics (age, sex, and major co-morbidity). Clinical manifestations and outcomes did not differ between the comparative groups. Notably, symptoms of cough and coryza were present in 22.6% and 15.9% of patients with and without hMPV co-infection, respectively (p > 0.05). The primary case for the hMPV outbreak could not be identified. Three co-infected individuals (visitors or patient) had travelled to mainland China within 2 weeks preceding symptom onset. Airborne (e.g. use of N-95 respirator in 'high risk' areas), droplets (e.g. use of surgical masks in 'low risk' areas), and contact precautions (e.g. use of gowns and gloves) were instituted beginning on 10 March according to appropriate risk categories, as suggested by CDC (CDC, 2003) . No further HMPV cases were detected after mid-March 2003.
