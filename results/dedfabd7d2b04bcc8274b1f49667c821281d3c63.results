Results of Co-IP and MS analyses. The immunocomplexes, formed by membrane proteins, JEV and anti-JEV mAb, were precipitated, washed, centrifuged and subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) . The results ostensibly indicated 3 novel protein bands at approximately 43, 55 and 95 kDa, present in the membrane protein sample but not present in the JEV and anti-JEV mAb controls. These gel bands were cut off in sections for further MS analyses. In MS experiments, the peptide sequences from the gels were quested in the monkey database but generated no matches, as the African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) database is not available. Therefore, the human database (Homo sapiens) had to be used instead, and the 95-kDa-molecule was probed as HSP90β, with a moderate score of 60.3 (Table I) , and then selected as an entire functioning protein for further investigation. HSP90β from the Vero membrane binds JEV on the Vero cell surface. First, western blot analysis was used to test the binding between JEV and HSP90β in the Vero membrane. Following non-reducing SDS-PAGE, Vero membrane protein extract samples were transferred onto PVDF membranes and reacted with rabbit anti-human HSP90β mAb (as anti-monkey HSP90β mAbs are unavailable) and indicated by fluorescent goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fig. 2A, lane 1) . Vero membrane protein samples also reacted alone with JEV and anti-JEV mAb 2H4 (Fig. 2A, lane 2) at the same 90 kDa position, indicating that HSP90β binds JEV. Later, confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed. As shown in Fig. 2B, JEV (green colour, Fig. 2B , panel 2) and HSP90β (red colour, Fig. 2B, panel 3 ) merger displayed yellow fluorescence on the cell surface (Fig. 2B,  panel 4) , evidently suggesting that the presence of HSP90β in the cell membrane binds JEV exactly on the cell surface. Specif ic mAb inhibits HSP9 0β-JEV binding in a dose-dependent manner. When the binding of HSP90β and JEV was ascertained, a virus infection inhibition experiment with rabbit anti-human HSP90β mAb at various concentrations was conducted using qualitative IFA and quantitative FCM. In the IFA experiment, green fluorescence gradually decreased with an increase in the anti-HSP90β mAb concentrations 0, 10 and 20 µg/ml (Fig. 3A) . The serial numbers listed in this table are not one-to-one matched with gel bands indicated by arrows in Fig. 1 . Moreover, the percentages of HSP90β-JEV binding measured by FCM also significantly decreased (P<0.01) from 76.17±0.69% (0 µg/ml anti-HSP90β m Ab) to 19.15±0.35% (20 µg/ml anti-HSP90β mAb) and further to 10.43±0.53% (100 µg/ml anti-HSP90β mAb) compared with the negative controls of 1.70±0.11% ( Fig. 3B and C) . These results clearly demonstrated that a specific anti-HSP90β mAb inhibited HSP90β-JEV binding in a dose-dependent manner. Decreased HSP90β expression in Vero cells reduces JEV progeny yields. siRNAs subcloned in lentivirus vectors were implemented to reduce HSP90β expression in Vero cells, and one transfected cell line exhibited an over 50% steady inhibition of HSP90β expression (Fig. 4A) . Subsequent sequencing data revealed that the 21-nt siRNA (GGAUGACA GCGGUAAGGAUtt) was complementary to the human HSP90β mRNA 1012-1030 nt (GGATGACAGTGGTAA GGATAA), which is consistent with a previous report (31) . Overall, the progeny virions in both intact and siRNA-treated Vero cell culture supernatants were detected at 24 (Fig. 4B ), 36 and 48 hpi. The commensurate numbers of viral plaques at 36 and 48 hpi in the intact cells indicated that fewer infectious viruses were released, implicating that almost all cells became infected after 36 hpi when the MOI was 0.1. However, in the siRNA-treated cells, the virion yields were significantly inhibited (P<0.01), particularly at 24 and 36 hpi, by 6.5-and 5.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 4C ).
