Of the 390 staff that was sent a survey, 139 completed and returned it, giving an overall response rate of 36%. Fifteen surveys were returned uncompleted as the staff member was no longer at the practice. Response rates were higher amongst PNs (46%) than GPs (30%). The demographic and occupational characteristics of the respondents are summarised in Table 1 . There was some variation in geographical location of respondents, with 58AE3% (81 ⁄ 139) located in semi-urban areas, 36% (50 ⁄ 139) in the inner city and the remaining 5AE7% (8 ⁄ 139) in rural locations. Of the respondents, 45% (62 ⁄ 139) were working in practices with £4 GPs. Our sample parallels the findings of the 2007-2008 Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) survey in terms of the spread in GP age, years worked in general practice and geographical location. The BEACH program is a continuous national study of general practice activity in Australia. It provides a reliable, ongoing, representative description of general practice activity nationwide. 28 Just over 70% of respondents were vaccinated against influenza in 2007 (70AE5%, 98 ⁄ 139, 95% CI: 62AE9-78AE1) and in 2008 (72AE7%, 101 ⁄ 139, 95% CI: 65AE3-80AE1). Differences in vaccination coverage between GPs and PNs for both 2007 (P = 0AE74) & 2008 (P = 0AE22) (see Table 1 Participants indicated that free influenza vaccine was most commonly provided at the practice for GPs (79AE1%, 110 ⁄ 139, 95% CI: 72AE3-85AE9), administration staff (74AE8%, 104 ⁄ 139, 95% CI: 67AE6-82AE0) and PNs (72AE7%, 101 ⁄ 139, 95% CI:65AE3-80AE1). Of the GPs working at a practice which provided free influenza vaccine for GPs, 84AE5% (49 ⁄ 58) were vaccinated in 2008 in contrast to 58AE3% (7 ⁄ 12) coverage in GPs from practices that did not provide the vaccine free of charge for them. For PNs, 69AE8% (37 ⁄ 53) vaccinated in 2008 worked at a practice where the vaccine was provided free and 66% (2 ⁄ 3) were vaccinated despite the vaccine not being provided free for PNs at their practice. Respondents' knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of influenza vaccination are summarised in Table 2 . Over 90% of the participants believe that the influenza vaccine is Attitudes towards vaccination barriers amongst the respondents are presented in Table 3 . While there was a low level of agreement with all of the statements provided (<10%), the most commonly identified barriers were lack of awareness of any recommendation for general practice staff to receive influenza vaccination (10AE1%, 14 ⁄ 139, 95% CI: 5AE1-15AE1) and unacceptable nature of vaccination side effects (7AE2%, 10 ⁄ 139, 95% CI: 2AE9-11AE5). Having to pay for the vaccine was identified as a barrier to getting vaccinated by 25AE2% (35 ⁄ 139) of respondents. Five of the twelve GPs, who worked in a practice that did not provide free vaccine, felt that paying for a vaccine was a barrier.
