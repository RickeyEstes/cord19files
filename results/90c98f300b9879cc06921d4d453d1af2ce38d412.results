Out of a total of 264 students, 251 filled out the questionnaire completely with a response rate of 95.1%. Of all the students, 241 (96%) had heard of H1N1, and only 10 (4%) were unaware of the new pandemic. The majority of the students (52%, n ¼ 126) had accurate information about the mode of transmission. One hundred ninetyseven students also accurately specified the indirect mode of transmission via H1N1-infected objects. Regarding H1N1 signs and symptoms, few students were able to correctly identify diarrhea and vomiting (23% and 40%, respectively). Most common symptoms identified were runny nose (91%), cough (83%), and sore throat (71%) (Fig 1) . Figure 2 illustrates the students' level of concern of being infected. Almost half of the students (41%, n ¼ 99) were not very or not at all concerned about contracting the H1N1 virus. Only 32% of students were very or somewhat concerned, and 27% of students were not sure. When asked about the predicted response upon discovering any H1N1 symptoms, 66% of the students reported that they would not stay at home (Fig 3) . However, 75% (n ¼ 181) of students would apply a face mask if necessary. The use of face masks was met with the most resistance (29%, n ¼ 36) among students aged 18 to 20 years (P ¼.047). The only significant predictor of concern was the failure of usage of face masks by students who were not concerned about contracting H1N1. Students with the lowest concern level were more likely to refuse the use of a protective face mask (P < .021).
