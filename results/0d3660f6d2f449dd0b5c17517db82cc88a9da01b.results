All optometric association presidents (n 5 50) and optometry school deans (n 5 17) identified in the Internet search were mailed questionnaires. Fifty percent (n 5 25) of the state optometric association presidents and 65% (n 5 11) of the optometry school deans returned the questionnaires Opinions of Health Care Leadership: Please aid us in understanding your opinions about potential roles and responsibilities of optometry professionals in response to catastrophic response. We welcome any additional comments and encourage you to add them to the reverse side of this sheet. Thank you in advance for your help. Please return the completed survey in the enclosed self-addressed stamped envelope. Optometry professionals would be receptive to receiving additional training that would enable them to provide additional assistance during a catastrophic event Medical professionals would be receptive to assistance from optometry professionals during a catastrophic event Medical professionals would recommend that optometry professionals receive additional training that would allow them to help during a catastrophic event within the study's assigned period of time, i.e., 1 month from the third questionnaire mailing. Mann-Whitney testing yielded no statistically significant difference defined as P % 0.05 between the state optometric association presidents and optometry school deans with regard to any of the statements of the survey. All of the leaders agreed with the statements that optometrists should have skills applicable to a catastrophic response, are ethically obligated to help the community during a catastrophe, and that they should receive additional training to develop skills for catastrophe management (see Table 1 ). Only 2 (8%) from the state optometric association presidents disagreed with the statement that medical professionals were receptive to assistance of optometrists; a similar percentage of both the state optometric association presidents and optometry school deans (92% and 91%, respectively) agreed on the statement that medical professionals would recommend that optometrists should receive additional training. The deans more strongly agreed with the statements that optometrists would be receptive to additional training, medical professionals were receptive to assistance of optometrists, and medical professionals would recommend that optometrists should receive additional training. Table 2 presents the findings between the 2 groups with regard to the statements related to the tasks optometrists can do with additional training in a surge disaster environment. For the tasks of providing basic first aid, conducting triage, maintaining infection control, obtaining medical histories, managing a point of distribution, prescribing medications, or counseling the ''worried well,'' (i.e., nonphysically or psychologically traumatized yet requiring information, support, and assurance); at most only 2 leaders were in disagreement. Approximately three fourths of the deans (73%) and two thirds of association presidents (68%) agreed that optometrists should be involved with starting intravenous lines, whereas 54% and 56%, respectively, agreed with optometrists suturing. Fifty-four percent of deans and 72% of the state presidents agreed with optometrists interpreting radiographs. With regard to optometry professionals receiving catastrophe preparedness training by local, state, and federal government agencies (see Table 3 ), the leadership was very favorable, although a small percentage of the association presidents disagreed with the statements. Approximately two thirds of each group agreed with private companies providing training, whereas twice the percentage of the state optometric association presidents (36%), compared with deans (18%), disagreed with the statement that continuing education courses from medical schools and medical societies could provide catastrophe preparedness training for optometrists. Optometry schools and associations as sources of training were highly and favorably viewed by both groups.
