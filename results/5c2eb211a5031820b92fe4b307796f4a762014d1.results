The total number of cases with confirmed MERS-CoV infection reported from April 2014 to May 2014 was 29. The majority of patients (60%) were men, and the median age was 45 years. The most common symptoms were fever (75.9%) and cough (69%), shortness of breath (69%), and vomiting and diarrhea (27%). The average duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization was 5 days (range, 1-12 days). Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with confirmed MERS-CoV are shown in Table 1 . Mortality rate among patients with confirmed MER-CoV was 34%. Mortality from MERS-CoV was significant (p < 0.05) and associated with older age, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, longer duration of symptoms prior to hospitalization (8 ± 2.5 days), diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), smokers, and lower blood pressure, as shown in Table 1 . Most of the patients were coming from Hanakia 11 (38%) and all 11 patients had contact with camels Table 2 . Close contact with confirmed index MERS-CoV was documented in five patients, all of whom were healthcare professionals; three staff nurses and two clinicians. Most of the patients were mildly hypoxic; oxygen saturation was 88.9 ± 5.4 at presentation with a picture of respiratory acidosis (pH 7.3 ± 0.1 and pCO2 57.1 ± 8.2). The basic liver functions show elevated alanine transaminase (98.4 ± 105.4 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (86.3 ± 93.5 U/L), and creatinine (225.0 ± 115.3 mmol/L). As shown in Fig. 1 , which were collected during the patient's initial assessment. All patients had abnormal initial chest radiographs. The predominant finding was bilateral basal consolidations with ground-glass opacities, nodular or/and reticular pattern, and total diffuse multilobar involvement. All patients had appropriate supportive management and received a broad spectrum antibiotic and readjusted based on sputum cultures. Among patients who required ICU, the mean time of ICU stay ranged from 9 days to 55 days (13.7 ± 4.0 days), and mechanical ventilation support was used in nine (31%) patients. Mechanical ventilation support and longer stay in ICU were significantly associated with death (p < 0.05) (see Table 4 ).
