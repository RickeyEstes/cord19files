In the section below, we show the experimental results obtained by applying the method to two datasets. First, we introduce a benchmark dataset that is used for a thorough evaluation of the method. We show the usefulness of the method for three types of searching applications as well as for biological classifications. Then, we proceed to apply the method to large-scale database searches of the non-redundant dataset constructed from the entire Protein Data Bank (PDB). We analyze and compare the results obtained on the two datasets.
