Neighbor-Joining (NJ) trees of the spike gene sequences (Fig. 1) indicated that the SARS-CoV (GD03T0013) of newly occurred case is closer to the human SARS-CoVs detected in the previous epidemic early phase (such as GZ02, GZ-B and BJ02, etc) than to the palm civet or raccoon dog SARS-CoV-like viruses (SZ1, SZ3, SZ13 and SZ16) detected in the previous epidemic. The p-distances of new isolate (GD03T0013) with GZ02 and GZ-B isolates are smaller than with SZ3 isolate (Fig. 1) . The similar results of gene sequence analysis were obtained from other models of phylogenetic trees such as Bayesian inference and Maximum likelihood methods (Fig. 2) . The phylogenetic trees of the spike protein sequences were also showed similar characteristics as above (Fig. 3) . The variant locations in the spike protein and the substitution types occurring in these isolates were markedly different between the human SARS-CoVs and the animal-origin SARS-CoV-like viruses comparing with the new isolate, the former has 5-7 mutual variant locations, the latter 8-9 mutual variant locations (Table 1) .
