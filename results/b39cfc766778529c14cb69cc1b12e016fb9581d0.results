Out of 70 adenoid tissue specimens tested by the screening RT-PCR, eleven (15.7%) were positive for SAFV RNA (Table 1) . SAFV-positive cases were from both, males (7/41, 17.1%) and females (4/29, 13.8%). The ages of the SAFV-positive patients ranged from 3 to 10 years (median 5 years). The detailed age distribution of SAFV positives and SAFV negatives is given in Table 2 . SAFV RNA concentration of the positive tissues ranged between <10 and 1x 10 4 copies/ reaction. Three specimens showed values over 1,000 copies/reaction. In every case of the 11 SAFV-positive adenoid samples, classical respiratory viruses were also found (Table 1) , with Enterovirus being the most frequent one (n = 9, 81.8%) followed by Human bocavirus (n = 7, 63.6%) and one of the four Human parainfluenza viruses (n = 5; 45%). SAFV was also detected in combination with Human rhinovirus (n = 2), Human parechovirus (n = 2), Human adenovirus (n = 2), Human respiratory syncytial virus (n = 2), and Human coronaviruses HKU-1 and OC43 (n = 1 each). The number of co-detected viruses ranged between one and six. The non-respiratory viruses Norovirus and Zika virus were not found. From 45 of the 70 patients tested, a throat swab was collected just before surgery. Thereof, eight throat swabs were from individuals with SAFV-positive adenoids. Two of 45 swabs tested positive for SAFV RNA (Table 1) . These two swabs were derived from individuals with SAFVpositive adenoid tissue indicating a rate of 2/8 (25%). Viral load in the swabs was rather low, i. e., 4.5x 10 2 and 1.1x 10 2 copies/mL. In both swabs, classical respiratory viruses were also found (case #1, Human rhinovirus; case #2, Human adenovirus and Human bocavirus). None of the throat swabs derived from children with SAFV RNA-negative adenoid tissues tested positive. Fifteen of the 45 (33%) swabs were negative for any of the tested viruses while 30 yielded at least one virus, albeit at low concentration (Table 3) . Most frequently, Human bocavirus was found (10/30 = 33%), followed by Human rhinovirus and Human adenovirus (9/30 Partial genome sequencing was only successful in three of the SAFV-positive adenoid tissue samples. BLAST alignment of the analyzed PCR product revealed a nearly complete match with the sequences of SAFV2 strains, deposited in the database. Hence, SAFV2 turned out to be the most likely candidate. In the remaining samples, amplification was hampered, most probably because of low viral load.
