On the basis of the broad case-definition used by the Andhra Pradesh state government, 329 cases of encephalitis were reported between June and September, 2003, with 183 deaths (case fatality rate 55·6%). Most deaths occurred within 48 h of admission to hospital. The distribution of cases was mainly rural, spread over 13 districts of the state, and was spotty without clustering (figure 1). Age of patients ranged from 9 months to 14 years. The male to female ratio was 1 to 0·77. Limited data suggested that CSF was usually under pressure; pleocytosis was absent. Neurological sequelae were rare in the children who recovered. The typical clinical manifestations in the group with confirmed Chandipura virus encephalitis (n=28) included rapid onset of fever (28 patients, 100%), followed by vomiting (15, 54%), altered sensorium (25, 89%), convulsions (23, 82%), diarrhoea (five, 18%), neurological deficit (four, 14%), and meningeal irritation (two, 7%). Brain tissue was obtained after death from only one patient: a 9-year-old, previously healthy girl developed fever, vomiting, and generalised tonic-clonic convulsions, became unconscious, and had severe dehydration. On admission she developed tachycardia, dyspnoea, irregular breathing, bilateral papilloedema, decerebrate posture, and no response to painful stimuli. Blood pressure at admission was 90/60 mm Hg and subsequently dropped to 60 mm Hg/not recordable. The girl was put on a mechanical ventilator. She continued with fever (101°F) and developed bradycardia and pupillary dilatation. Potassium rose substantially in her serum (to 8 mmol/L). The patient was treated with intravenous fluids, antibiotics, phenytoin, diazepam, and mannitol, and died within 24 h of admission. Routine laboratory investigations screening for Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, paramyxovirus, coronavirus, measles virus (serum and CSF), dengue virus, rabies virus, influenza viruses, and mycoplasma (throat swab and CSF) yielded negative results. In the encephalitis group, all ten CSF samples were negative for virus isolations. Virus was isolated from three of 22 throat swabs (one in MDCK; one in RD, Vero, and MDCK; one in Vero and RD), one brain aspirate in RD and Vero cell cultures, and two of ten blood clots in peripheral-blood mononuclear cell co-culture. Five of the six samples from which virus was isolated had been obtained within 4 days of onset of illness. In the fever group, one of eight throat swabs yielded virus in the RD cell line. Assessment of the culture isolates with transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of bulletshaped particles that were 150-165 nm long and 50-60 nm wide, with distinct surface projections 9-11 nm in length and a stain-filled canal at the base of the particle-all features suggestive of rhabdoviruses (figure 2). Isolates were identified as Chandipura virus by complement fixation and neutralisation tests. Chandipura viral antigen and RNA were detected in brain tissue by immunofluorescence assay ( figure 3) and PCR, respectively. Four of 21 throat swabs, one of seven CSF samples, five of 25 serum samples, and one brain aspirate were positive for Chandipura virus RNA. One of the five positive serum samples was from the patient (table 1) . All isolates were also positive for Chandipura viral RNA. Partial G gene sequences of 395 nt (accession number AY5544072-411) representing clinical specimens from five patients showed 96-99·8% identity (mean 97·5%, 95% CI 95·1-99·9; figure 4) . These sequences were 96·7-97·5% (97·03, 95% CI 96·4-97·6) identical with the 1965 reference sequence. All Chandipura virus sequences clustered together with 100% bootstrap support and were closer to Piry virus than to vesicular stomatitis virus (figure 5). Table 1 shows IgM, IgG, and neutralising antibody status for 28 patients with confirmed Chandipura virus encephalitis, three patients with fever, and two contacts. Table 2 shows antibody status in 48 patients with encephalitis, including 25 of the patients with confirmed Chandipura virus infection mentioned in table 1 (data were incomplete for the other three patients). Since no paired samples of serum from the acute and convalescent phases of illness could be obtained from the patients during this outbreak, the results from testing of singlebleed serum samples were assessed in relation to the time after disease onset at which samples were obtained. A smaller proportion (four of 30 [13%]) of serum samples obtained up to 4 days after onset of illness (early samples) were positive for IgM reactive with Chandipura virus, compared with samples obtained later than 4 days after onset of illness (11 of 16 [69%]; p<0·001). A similar trend was also noted for Chandipura virus-reactive IgG antibodies (3% of early samples positive vs 50% of late samples) and neutralising antibodies (7% vs 83%). The geometric mean titres in early versus late samples were significantly different (6·1 vs 87·4, p<0·001) . Chandipura virus-reactive IgM antibodies were also found in two of five patients with fever but no CNS involvement, and in two of ten family contacts. Unfortunately, because of the nature of the outbreak response and local resources, we were unable to obtain serum samples from a larger control group.
