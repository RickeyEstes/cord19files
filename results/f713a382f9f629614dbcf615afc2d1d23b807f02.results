The layout of a typical hospital ward cubicle containing six patients and two standing medical staff is shown in Figure 1 . The CFD results for the various ventilation options, including the low performance limit of the existing general ward cubicle and the high performance limit of the infectious disease isolation room, are shown in Table I . The scenarios tested included air changes at the rate of 4, 6 and 12 ACH for the corridor, high and low level exhaust locations, as shown in Table I . The associated air flows in selected studies are depicted in the CFD-simulated velocity profiles shown in Figure 2 (study no. 1a), Figure 3 (study no. 2c) and Figure 4 (study no. 3c).
