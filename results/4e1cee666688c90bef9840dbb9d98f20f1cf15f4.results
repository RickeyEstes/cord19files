The atomic coordinates of ACZ97474 neuraminidase Influenza A virus[A/Blore/NIV236/2009(H1N1)] was not available in PDB, hence, to develop a protein model was necessary. The final model, which we took for further analysis, consisted of 469 amino acid residues with a resolution of 2 Å. Both PROCHECK and Verify3D softwares have been used to check the quality of the modeled protein structure. Ramachandran plot obtained from the program PROCHECK, which checks the stereochemical quality of a protein structures, producing a number of postscript plots analyzing its overall and residue-by-residue geometry, assured the reliability of the modeled protein with 83.3% residues in most allowed region and 10.8% in additional allowed region. There were none residues in disallowed region and only 0.9% in generously allowed region ( Figure  2 ). The assessment with Verify3D, which derives a "3D-1D" profile based on the local environment of each residue, described by the statistical preferences for: the area of the residue that is buried, the fraction of side-chain area that is covered by polar atoms (oxygen and nitrogen) and the local secondary structure, also substantiated the reliability of the three-dimensional structure. Active sites were identified with reference to the studies done on 3TI4 using CASTp, Q-Site finder and further verified from available literature (Table 1 ). Here, we combined the results obtained from a standard docking protocol and then investigated efficiency for andrographolide derivatives and other four herbal compounds imperatorin, andrographolide, epigallocatechin and arabinoxylan from Angelica archangelica, A. paniculata, Green tea and Hyphomycetes mycelia, respectively (Figures 5-8) . Lig 0 O Docking simulation of andrographolide derivatives to the homology modeled ACZ97474 was performed using A utodock4.2. A ll the 1 4 0 andrographolide ligands were docked into the defined binding site. The top 10 configurations after docking were taken into consideration to validate the result ( Table 2 ). The RMSD value calculated out of ten accepted poses for each configuration was found in between 0.59-1.33 Å. This revealed that the docked configurations have similar binding positions and orientations within the binding site and are similar to the crystal structure. The best docked structures which are the configuration with the lowest binding score are compared with the crystal structure as shown in Figures 2-8 . Docking of andrographolide derivatives to this binding site was performed using the standardized docking protocol. The binding mode of andrographolide within the binding site is represented in Figure 5 . In this figure we can observe that both the molecules were well fitted to the defined binding pocket. All 140 andrographolide analogues were also found to be good binders with ACZ97474. The binding modes of andrographolide and its derivatives showed hydrophobic interaction with ACZ97474. This binding mode proved the hypothesis that the andrographolide derivatives bind to ACZ97474 with almost hydrophobic interactions and it should be the pre-organized shape binding between the rigid structure of andrographolide analogues and the binding pocket of ACZ97474. All the docking and interaction analysis were carried out as per our previous studies [32] [33] .
