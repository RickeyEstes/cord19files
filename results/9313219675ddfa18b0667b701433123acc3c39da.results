TRIM56 interacts with cGAS. Mass spectrometry of a purified FLAG-tagged cGAS complex identified the IFN-inducible E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM56 with an apparent molecular mass of 81 kDa as a cGAS-binding partner (Fig. 1a) . Coimmunoprecipitation showed the specific interaction of cGAS-FLAG with either exogenous or endogenous TRIM56 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1b, c) . This interaction was specific since cGAS-FLAG did not interact with TRIM25 under the same conditions (Fig. 1b) . The single-molecule pull-down (SiMPull) technique combines the principles of a conventional pull-down assay with single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and enables direct visualization of individual protein-protein interactions 35 . Specifically, this approach immobilizes protein complexes from lysed cells directly on a coverslip, which is then studied under a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope. This SiMPull assay also revealed that TRIM56 effectively bound to cGAS (Fig. 1d) 21, 29 . We further examined whether TRIM56 directly interacted with cGAS by using bacterially purified cGAS and TRIM56 purified from HEK293T cells. Full-length (FL) cGAS fused with maltosebinding protein (MBP) interacted with TRIM56. However, both MBP-cGAS C-terminal region (a.a. 161-522) and MBP alone failed to interact with TRIM56 ( Supplementary Fig. 1a) . Mapping study showed that the N-terminal RD of cGAS and the Cterminal NCL1-HT2A-Lin41 (NHL) homologous region of TRIM56 were responsible for their interaction (Fig. 1e) . Collectively, these results showed the specific interaction between cGAS and TRIM56. Supplementary Fig. 10 activity to induce IFN production in response to double-stranded DNA stimulation 33 . To test the role of TRIM56 in STINGmediated DNA sensing, human monocyte THP-1 cells were stably transfected with two different TRIM56-specific shorthairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to deplete TRIM56 expression (Fig. 2a) . IFNβ mRNA levels were measured upon herring testis (HT) DNA transfection or cGAMP stimulation. Depletion of TRIM56 expression led to the significant reduction of HT-DNA mediated IFNβ mRNA expression but did not affect cGAMP-mediated IFNβ mRNA expression (Fig. 2b) . These results suggest that, unlike the previous report 33 , TRIM56 plays an important function in the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway upstream of STING. In order to further investigate the role of TRIM56 in cGASmediated DNA sensing, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 technology to disrupt the TRIM56 gene in L929 mouse fibroblasts cGAS(−) cells 36 and complemented with mouse cGAS-FLAG (Fig. 2c) . To comprehensively understand the role of TRIM56 on the cGAS-STING pathway upon DNA or RNA virus infection, we observed the co-localization of exogenously expressed cGAS or STING with endogenous TRIM56. Both endogenous TRIM56 and exogenous green fluorescent protein (GFP)-cGAS effectively co-localized at the indicated foci upon HT-DNA stimulation or HSV-1 infection but not upon SeV infection. However, STING did not co-localize with either cGAS or TRIM56 under any conditions ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . Collectively, the results indicate that TRIM56 is essential for cGAS-mediated DNA sensing activity. TRIM56 E3 ligase induces the monoubiquitination of cGAS. It was intriguing to detect that, upon treatment of proteasome inhibitor MG132 and deubiquitinase inhibitor n-ethylmaleimide, a small portion of cGAS underwent a migration shift with an apparent molecular weight of~8 kDa in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3a) . This migration shift was more obvious upon TRIM56 overexpression, suggesting that TRIM56 E3 ubiquitin ligase may induce the monoubiquitination of cGAS (Fig. 3a) . To examine the level of cGAS monoubiquitination with or without TRIM56 expression, the densities of the higher molecular-weight cGAS bands were quantitated in three independent experiments. This showed that cGAS monoubiquitination was increased~6 fold upon TRIM56 expression ( Supplementary Fig. 3a, b) . To test the potential TRIM56-mediated monoubiquitination of cGAS, HEK293T cells were transfected with cGAS-FLAG with or without TRIM56-V5, treated with MG132 and n-ethylmaleimide, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody, followed by immunoblotting with a monoubiquitin-specific VU-1 antibody. A portion of cGAS was readily detected by VU-1 antibody and this VU-1 antibody reactivity was further increased by TRIM56 expression (Fig. 3b) . These monoubiquitinated forms of cGAS migrated near 75 kDa ( Supplementary Fig. 3c ). To further confirm cGAS monoubiquitination, we used the previously described L929 cell lines. cGAS-FLAG was stably expressed in TRIM56(+) cGAS(−) or TRIM56(−) cGAS(−) L929 cells, and purified cGAS-FLAG protein was then subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-VU-1 antibody. This experiment showed that monoubiquitination of cGAS-FLAG could be only detected in TRIM56-expressing cells ( Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 4a ). Finally, an in vitro ubiquitination assay using purified cGAS demonstrated that TRIM56 E3 ligase effectively induced the monoubiquitination of cGAS favorably with UbcH5a or UbcH5c as an E2 enzyme ( Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 4b ). Taken together, these results collectively show that TRIM56 E3 ligase induces the monoubiquitination of cGAS. cGAS K335 monoubiquitination is important for DNA sensing. To identify the specific lysine residue(s) of cGAS that are targeted by TRIM56 for monoubiquitination, cGAS-FLAG was co-expressed with TRIM56 in HEK293T cells and partially purified for multi-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry ( Supplementary Fig. 5a ). Three potential ubiquitination sites were identified: Lys278, Lys335, and Lys350 ( Supplementary Fig. 5b ). To test their role in cGAS monoubiquitination, each of these lysine residues was mutated to arginine (Lys278R, Lys335R, and Lys350R). These mutants were co-expressed with TRIM56 and blotted with anti-VU-1 antibody. While the K278R or K350R mutants underwent TRIM56mediated monoubiquitination as efficiently as cGAS WT, the cGAS K335R mutant completely lost its TRIM56-mediated monoubiquitination (Fig. 4a ). This indicates that the K335 residue of cGAS is the primary site for TRIM56-induced monoubiquitination. To test the role of TRIM56-induced K335 monoubiquitination of cGAS in IFN signaling, cGAS WT, K278R, K335R, or K350R were co-transfected with TRIM56 and the IFNβ promoterluciferase reporter. The cGAS K335R mutant showed weak IFNβ promoter activation, and its activity was not increased by TRIM56 expression (Fig. 4b) . By striking contrast, cGAS WT, K278R, or K350R showed strong IFNβ promoter activation, which was further enhanced by TRIM56 expression (Fig. 4b) . To further delineate the role of cGAS K335 monoubiquitination, cGAS(−) L929 cells were stably complemented with cGAS WT or the K335R mutant followed by HT-DNA stimulation or HSV-1ΔICP34.5 infection. cGAS WT expression in cGAS(−) L929 cells robustly induced IFNβ mRNA production upon HSV-1ΔICP34.5 infection or HT-DNA stimulation, whereas expression of the cGAS K335R mutant led to a minimal induction of IFNβ mRNA under the same conditions (Fig. 4c) . To test whether the K335R mutation affected cGAS NTase activity, bacterially purified cGAS WT or K335R mutant was subjected to an in vitro cGAMP production assay. This showed that the cGAS K335R mutant produced a comparable level of cGAMP to cGAS WT in vitro (Fig. 4d) , suggesting that the lack of DNA sensing activity of cGAS K335R mutant in cells is due to the loss of TRIM56induced monoubiquitination, not the loss of NTase activity. These results demonstrate that TRIM56 catalyzes the monoubiquitination of cGAS at the lysine 335 residue, which is critical for its DNA sensing activity. TRIM56 enhances cGAS dimerization and DNA-binding activity. cGAS forms an oligomeric complex with bound DNA and subsequently undergoes switch-like conformational changes at the activation loop 40, 41 . Localization of the K335 residue on the interaction surface suggested that the TRIM56-induced monoubiquitination might facilitate cGAS dimerization and/or DNAbinding activity. To investigate whether TRIM56 affected the cGAS dimerization or oligomerization, we performed SiMPull photo bleaching analysis. Besides the protein-protein interaction shown in Fig. 1d , the SiMPull technique also provides a measure of protein stoichiometry directly determined from the stepwise pattern of fluorophore photo bleaching, as well as protein interactions with other compounds, such as nucleic acids, small molecule ligands, and lipids 42 . For the fluorophore photo bleaching assay, cGAS-GFP fusion was expressed in HEK293T cells with or without TRIM56, followed by photo bleaching and counting the fluorescence spots. This showed that a majority of WT cGAS and K335R mutant was present as a monomer without TRIM56 expression ( Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Approximately 20% of cGAS WT underwent dimerization upon TRIM56 expression, whereas the cGAS K335R mutant showed little or no increase in dimerization under these conditions (Fig. 4e) . cGAS dimerization increases DNA-binding activity and cGAS bound to DNA undergoes a conformational change to catalyze cGAMP synthesis 40, 41 . Thus we tested whether TRIM56 increases cGAS DNA-binding activity. Rhodaminelabeled DNA was co-transfected into vector-, cGAS-, or TRIM56/ cGAS-expressing cells. Further SiMPull analysis indicated that overexpression of TRIM56 efficiently increased the doublestranded DNA (dsDNA)-binding activity of cGAS WT but not the cGAS K335R mutant (Fig. 4f) . These results suggest that TRIM56 expression induces cGAS oligomerization, which subsequently increases its cGAS DNA-binding activity. TRIM56 has a critical role in in vivo HSV-1 infection. To investigate the in vivo antiviral activity of TRIM56, we generated TRIM56 −/− mice in which the first exon of TRIM56 was spliced and fused with a LacZ cassette, thus abrogating TRIM56 Fig. 7) . While TRIM56 −/− mice displayed lower fertility compared to WT mice, they showed no obvious phenotypes. WT or TRIM56 −/− mice were infected with HSV-1 with 1.8 × 10 8 plaque-forming units/mouse and their survival was monitored. We found that TRIM56 −/− mice (n = 6) rapidly lost weight, showed severe disease symptoms, and died over a period of 5 days (Fig. 5a) . In contrast, 67% of WT mice (n = 4) showed minor symptoms, recovered their lost weight, and survived; 33% of them (n = 2) showed moderate symptoms and died over a period of 6-7 days postinfection (Fig. 5a) . Moreover, TRIM56 −/− mice had considerably lower blood IFNα and IFNβ levels in blood than WT mice following HSV-1 infection (Fig. 5b,  c) . Peritoneal cavity cells of HSV-1-infected TRIM56 −/− mice showed much lower IFNβ mRNA levels than those of HSV-1infected WT mice (Fig. 5d) . Finally, peritoneal macrophages were isolated from WT or TRIM56 −/− mice infected with HSV-1 and tested for IFNβ mRNA levels. Peritoneal macrophages from TRIM56 −/− mice had significantly lower IFNβ mRNA levels upon HSV-1 infection compared to those from WT mice (p < 0.05, Fig. 5e ). In contrast to the previous in vitro study 29 , TRIM56 −/− mice (n = 9) showed nearly no difference from WT mice (n = 9) in response to in vivo IAV PR8 infection; both mice rapidly lost weight and died over a period of 11 days ( Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 8a ). These results demonstrate the critical role of TRIM56 in the in vivo IFN response to HSV-1 infection but not to IAV infection. TRIM56 has a critical role in in vitro HSV-1 infection. To further assess the critical role of TRIM56 in the cGAS-mediated DNA sensing pathway, WT or TRIM56 −/− mouse bone marrowderived macrophages (BMDMs) were infected with HSV-1 or HSV-1ΔICP34.5 (Fig. 6a) . While WT BMDMs robustly induced IFNβ mRNA expression upon HSV-1 or HSV-1ΔICP34.5 (Fig. 6a) . Timecourse experiments also showed that TRIM56 −/− BMDMs induced little or no IFNα/β production upon HSV-1ΔICP34.5 infection, whereas WT BMDMs robustly induced IFNα/β production (Fig. 6b, c) . Consistently, significant higher titers of HSV-1 were measured in TRIM56 −/− BMDMs compared to WT BMDMs (Fig. 6d) . To determine whether the TRIM56 E3 ligase enzymatic activity is required to induce IFNβ mRNA expression upon HSV-1ΔICP34.5 infection, we generated the enzymatically dead mutant (Mut) of TRIM56 by replacing the cysteine 21 and 24 residues with serines and complemented TRIM56 −/− BMDMs with lentivirus-derived TRIM56WT or TRIM56 Mut (Supplementary Fig. 8b, Fig. 6e) . These results showed that, while expression of TRIM56WT in TRIM56 −/− BMDMs efficiently induced IFNβ mRNA expression, expression of TRIM56 Mut led to a minimal increase of IFNβ mRNA expression (Fig. 6e) . We tested IFN responses in WT and TRIM56 −/− mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs) and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). Similarly, we observed that TRIM56 −/− MEFs failed to induce IFNβ production following HT-DNA or pdA:dT stimulation compared to WT MEFs (Fig. 6f ). In addition, time-course experiments showed that TRIM56 −/− BMDCs weakly induced IFNβ production compared to WT BMDCs upon HSV-1ΔICP34.5 infection (Fig. 6g ). In agreement with previous in vivo infection results (Fig. 5f ), TRIM56 −/− BMDMs also showed nearly no difference from WT BMDMs in response to IAV PR8 infection; both BMDMs robustly produced IFNβ (Fig. 6h) . We further examined whether TRIM56 was involved in the host's response to positive-and negative-strand RNA viruses. WT and TRIM56 −/− BMDMs showed no significant differences in the magnitude of IFNβ mRNA induction upon infection of positivestrand RNA flavivirus such as Zika virus and Dengue virus ( Supplementary Fig. 9a) . Furthermore, a positive-strand RNA alphavirus (Sindbis virus) and a negative-strand RNA virus (Parainfluenza virus) also induced IFNβ mRNA at similar levels between WT and TRIM56 −/− BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 9b) . We also showed that WT and TRIM56 −/− BMDMs showed similar levels of IFNα production upon infection with Sindbis virus or Parainfluenza virus ( Supplementary Fig. 9c ). Furthermore, WT and TRIM56 −/− BMDMs showed similar levels of IFNβ production upon infection of Flavivirus (Zika virus or Dengue virus), Sindbis virus, or Parainfluenza virus (Supplementary Fig. 9d, e) . WT and TRIM56 −/− BMDMs were infected with Sindbis virus and viral titers were then measured at different time points using a standard plaque-formation assay on Vero cells. This showed similar viral titers of Sindbis virus in WT and TRIM56 −/− BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 9f) . Finally, WT and TRIM56 −/− BMDMs also showed similar viral RNA loads of ZIKV MR766 strain or H/PF2013 strain during 48 h infection periods ( Supplementary Fig. 9g) . These comprehensive results demonstrate that TRIM56 is critical for the IFN response against DNA virus infection but appears to be not required for negativeand positive-strand RNA virus infection.
