With a mean SI at 4.5 days, we estimate the R0 to be 2.2 (95%CI: 2.1−2.4), which is consistent with previous estimates [7, 8, 11] . The fitting results are shown in Fig 1(a) and (b), which match the observed data well. We estimate the dispersion term (k) to be 44 (95%CI: 6−88), which is significantly larger than 1 and consistent with [7] . The simulation results with or without dispersion term (k) were largely consistent, which implies the virus is hard to go extinction that other two coronavirus. Note that low k implies high chance of superspreading events and high chance of extinction. Without control measures, we estimate that the COVID-19 outbreak is likely to cause 3066 cases .
