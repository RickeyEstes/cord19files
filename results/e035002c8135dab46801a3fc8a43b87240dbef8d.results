As a concrete example of the previous modeling approach we analyze the specific case study of the SARS epidemic. Several mathematical models have been developed since the SARS coronavirus was identified (see [14] and references therein). Many of these approaches focused on localized communities, such as generic hospital populations [15] , specific cities or small regions [9, 10, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , whereas few others considered the role of global travel [3, 28] . In particular, the estimates of key epidemiological parameters are traditionally obtained from fitting local models (i.e. on the scale of cities, regions) to empirical data. Such approaches assume closed boundary conditions for the region under consideration, neglecting possible movements of individuals in and out of the region. In the following we use the global computational model defined in the previous section to simulate synthetic SARS outbreak on the worldwide scale and compare with the empirical data from the real world occurrence. The compartmentalization and the disease parameter values considered in the model are chosen according to previous studies [1, 11, 29] . It is worth stressing however that the compartmentalization used (see Figure 1 ), while borrowed from the most authoritative references on the SARS outbreak, is suffering from the approximations due to the lack of information on the social specific structure and heterogeneity that might be crucial for a full understanding of the disease. Parameters are kept constant throughout the evolution of the disease, except for the hospitalization rate μ -1 and for the scaling of the transmission rate β, which follow a three steps function as in [11] and [9] , respectively (Table 1) . These steps correspond to the implementation in Hong Kong of containment measures and advisories effectively reducing the transmission rate [9, 11] . It is reasonable to consider a certain reaction time delay taking place in each country from the detection of the first case to the implementation of the policies aimed at reducing the transmission rate on a national scale. In the following, we report the results for an intervention delay of 1 week. The Additional file reports the results for immediate reaction (no delay) and 2 weeks delay. Initial conditions are based on available evidence on the early stages of the outbreak and assume as index patient the first case detected out of mainland China, who arrived in Hong Kong on 21 February 2003 [30] . Simulations are seeded in Hong Kong T 0 days after 21 February with the index patient and L(t = 0) initial latent. This allows the effective consideration of the observed super-spreading events [31] [32] [33] [34] and multiple transmission before the index patient was hospitalized [9] . The complete time frame under study is from T 0 days after 21 February to 11 July 2003, date corresponding to the last daily update by the World Health Organization (WHO) on the cumulative number of reported probable cases of SARS [35] . The values of the transmission rate β, of the initial number Baseline values for all epidemiological parameters and initial conditions. Parameters marked with an asterisk (*) are estimated by our model through the fitting procedure described in the main text. The three successive decreasing values for the μ -1 model are the prompter, identification and subsequent isolation of infectious individuals [11] . A step function is also assumed for the scaling factor s f (t) of the transmission parameter β, with values taken from the estimates of the effective reproductive number R t with respect to R 0 during the early stage of SARS epidemic in Hong Kong [9] . This corresponds to the effective reduction of the reproductive number due to the application of control measures [9] . spond to a relative variation of 10% in the least square value from the minimum, once the offset is set to its optimal value. The obtained value of the reproductive number -R 0 = 2.76 -is in agreement with previous estimates [9] . We also tested different initial conditions that do not effectively incorporate super-spreading events with no substantial changes in the results.
