The matching procedure on sex and age resulted in wellbalanced groups of cases and controls with respect to these and other relevant variables (Table 1) . Micronutrient supplementation related to the intervention trial was also similar between cases and controls [3] . The 97 symptomatic cases had 107 case episodes of respiratory infection, during which virologic (including M. pneumoniae) tests were performed. In 62 (58%) of these case episodes at least one micro-organism was demonstrated, whereas in two of these 62 two different micro-organisms were demonstrated. In 45 (42%) case episodes none of the applied tests was positive. Of 10 cases, two case episodes were included. For seven out of the mentioned 10 cases, test results were different, i.e., different pathogens, or negative in one and positive virology in the other episode. In two cases, both episodes had negative virology. Only in one case, in both episodes rhinovirus was detected. The most common viruses demonstrated were rhinoviruses (32%) and coronaviruses (17%) followed by influenzaviruses (7%), enteroviruses (2%), parainfluenzaviruses (2%) and M. pneumoniae (1%). Respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus were not detected. Three of the seven cases diagnosed with an influenzavirus infection had been vaccinated against influenza. None of the titer rises on which the influenzavirus infection was diagnosed, was related to vaccination, as 2 to 4 months passed between vaccination and the diagnosis of an influenzavirus infection. Presence of rhinovirus infections was almost five times higher compared to influenzavirus infections in this community-dwelling elderly population (Table 2 ). In 4 out of 91 control periods (4%) a virus was demonstrated, i.e., two times a rhinovirus and two times a coronavirus. Two out of these four controls with positive virology never showed symptoms of a respiratory infection during the 1-year study period. The two remaining controls with positive virology did not have any symptoms at least 3.5 and 4 months before and 8 and 4 months after sample collection, respectively. Overall, the odds ratio for demonstrating a virus (or M. pneumoniae) in cases with symptoms vs. controls without symptoms of acute respiratory infection was 30.0 (95% confidence interval 10.2-87.6). Despite small numbers (n ϭ 5) significantly more influenzavirus A infections were identified during symptomatic periods in winter (October-March) compared to summer (P ϭ .02). Enteroviruses, parainfluenzaviruses and M. pneumoniae were only detected in summer (April-September). Clinical characteristics of the persons suffering from an acute respiratory infection, during episodes with positive and negative virologic laboratory diagnosis, are described in Table 3 . Influenzavirus infection was associated with significantly longer illness duration and more systemic symptoms than the other infections with positive and negative virology. Restriction of activity, presence of fever, medical consultation, and antibiotic use were also more frequently reported during influenzavirus infections, although not significantly different from the other infections with positive and negative virology.
