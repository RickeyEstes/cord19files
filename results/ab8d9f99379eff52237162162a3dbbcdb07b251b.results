A flow chart indicating the relationship between the NBRDI project population and the case-control population is shown in Fig. 3 . Intervals between each animal's induction date and their cohort's close date ranged from zero to 15 days, but for 75% the interval was three days or less and for 92% the interval was six days or less. All of the 7314 selected animals (3651 cases and 3663 controls) with serological results were included in the analyses investigating serostatus at induction, but 313 (4%; 134 cases and 179 controls) were excluded from the analyses of the composite serochange variables because their change in serostatus between induction and follow-up was implausible for at least one virus. Descriptive results for seroprevalences at induction and changes in serostatus from induction to follow-up for each of the four viruses are shown in Tables 3, 4 and 5 . The results of subset analyses for BoHV-1 stratified by Rhinogard ® vaccination are presented in Table 3 and results for the subset analyses for BVDV-1 restricted to animals not vaccinated with Pestigard ® are presented in Table 4 . Based on the pooled weighted seroprevalences, an estimated 76% of animals were seronegative for BoHV-1 at induction, 48% seroincreased and 54% of seronegative animals seroconverted during the 35-60 day follow-up period ( Table 3 ). The majority (79%) of animals in the NBRDI project population were vaccinated with Rhinogard ® at induction and 87% of animals in the case-control study received Rhinogard ® . An estimated 31% of animals were seronegative for BVDV-1 at induction, 23% seroincreased and 55% of susceptible animals seroconverted during the 35-60 day followup period (Table 4 ). In the subset of animals known to have not been previously vaccinated against BVDV-1 with Pestigard ® , distributions of animals across categories for the BVDV-1 variables were similar to those estimated from the entire case-control study population, but the proportion that was seronegative at induction (34%) and the proportion that seroincreased (27%) were slightly higher (Table 4 ). An estimated 11% of animals were seronegative for BRSV at induction, 29% seroincreased and 65% of susceptible animals seroconverted during the 35-60 day follow-up period (Table 5) . Lastly, an estimated 9% of animals were seronegative for BPIV-3 at induction, 17% seroincreased and 54% of susceptible animals seroconverted during the 35-60 day follow-up period ( Table 5 ). The distribution of the BoHV-1 serological variables in the casecontrol population and the estimated odds ratios for the effects are displayed in Table 3 . Odds ratios for the subsets stratified by Rhinogard ® vaccination were similar to those obtained using the full case-control population. Across the case-control population, being seropositive for BoHV-1 at induction was associated with a slightly reduced risk of BRD (OR 0.9, 95% credible interval: 0.7-1.0), with animals in induction categories 2 or 3 at moderately reduced risk (OR 0.7, 95% credible interval: 0.6-0.9) relative to induction category 0. BoHV-1 seroconversion occurred much more frequently in vaccinated (61%) than in unvaccinated (26%) animals. Seroconversion (i.e. an increase of at least two categories) in initially seronegative animals vaccinated with Rhinogard ® at induction was associated with increased risk of BRD (OR 1.3, 95% credible interval: 1.1-1.6). The distributions of the serological variables relating to BVDV-1 in the case-control population and the estimated odds ratios for the effects are displayed in Table 4 . Being seropositive for BVDV-1 at induction was associated with reduced risk of BRD (OR 0.8, 95% credible interval: 0.6-1.0 and 0.7-0.9) for animals in induction categories 2 or 3 and 4 or 5, respectively. Seroincrease for BVDV-1 was associated with an increase in risk of BRD (OR 1.3, 95% credible interval: 1.1-1.6) as was seroconversion (OR 1.6, 95% credible interval: 1.3-2.1). In the subset of animals assumed to have not been Table 3 Distribution of serological variables and estimated odds ratios for the effects of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) serological variables on the odds of being a BRD case a . f Covariates: mixing summary; N = 636 animals sampled within 7 days of arrival. g Covariates: mixing summary, cohort size, shared pen water; N = 607 animals sampled within 7 days of arrival. h Covariates: mixing summary, cohort size, shared pen water; N = 484 animals sampled within 7 days of arrival. i Estimated seroprevalences and seroincidences for the NBRDI project population, the source population for the current case-control study; calculated as pooled weighted averages (0.84 × observed percentage in controls + 0.16 × observed percentage in cases) based on the ratio of the sampling fractions for selection from the NBRDI project population as a case versus as a control (5.3:1). previously vaccinated with Pestigard ® prior to feedlot entry, the estimated effects were similar to those observed in the full casecontrol population, but with a more marked protective effect in animals that were seropositive at induction (OR 0.6, 95% credible interval: 0.4-0.9 compared to 0.8 for the full case-control study population). Amongst animals not previously vaccinated, those that seroconverted to BVDV-1 were at much higher risk of BRD than animals not seroconverting (OR 2.9, 95% credible interval: 1.6-5.0). The distribution of the serological variables relating to BRSV in the case-control population and the estimated odds ratios for the effects are displayed in Table 5 . Prior exposure to BRSV was associated with reduced risk of BRD relative to that for induction category 0 (OR 0.8, 95% credible intervals: 0.6-0.9), with similar effect estimates across categories. Seroincrease to BRSV was associated with an increase in risk of BRD (OR 1.5, 95% credible interval: 1.3-1.7) as was seroconversion (OR 1.5, 95% credible interval: 0.9-2.2). The distribution of the serological variables relating to BPIV-3 in the case-control population and the estimated odds ratios for the effects are displayed in Table 5 . Prior exposure to BPIV-3 was associated with reduced risk of BRD relative to induction category 0 (OR 0.6, 95% credible intervals: 0.5-0.7) with consistent effect estimates across categories. Seroincrease to BPIV-3 was associated with an increase in risk of BRD (OR 1.4, 95% credible interval: 1.1-1.6) as was seroconversion (OR 1.5, 95% credible interval: 0.9-2.2). Correlations in both induction category and composite serochange variables between all pairs of viruses were weak (Spearman's rho <0.20) (results not shown). The estimated tetrachoric correlation coefficients for binary variables are displayed in Table 6 . The closest correlations observed were only modest; these were correlations between seroconversion for BRSV and BPIV-3 (rho = 0.36) and between seroconversion for BRSV and BVDV-1 (rho = 0.34). The induction serological profiles of animals in the current study together with the estimated distributions across the NBRDI project population are presented in Table 7 . The vast majority of animals had antibodies to at least one virus at induction, with only an estimated 1.1% of animals being seronegative for all four viruses. The most common pattern, in an estimated 43% of the project population was for animals to be seropositive for BVDV-1, BRSV and BPIV-3 and seronegative for BoHV-1 at induction. About 16% of the NBRDI project population were estimated to be seropositive for all four viruses investigated and 25% were estimated to be seronegative for two or more viruses at induction; 73% of these were seronegative for both BoHV-1 and BVDV-1. Table 8 presents the distributions of Table 4 Distribution of serological variables and estimated odds ratios for the effects of bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1) serological variables on the odds of being a BRD case a . h Estimated seroprevalences and seroincidences for the NBRDI project population, the source population for the current case-control study; calculated as pooled weighted averages (0.84 × observed percentage in controls + 0.16 × observed percentage in cases) based on the ratio of the sampling fractions for selection from the NBRDI project population as a case versus as a control (5.3:1). profiles for seroincreases. An estimated 73% of animals in the NBRDI project population seroincreased for at least one of the four viruses investigated. The distributions of the two combined virus variables (i.e. number of viruses seropositive at induction and number of viruses animals seroincreased for between induction and follow-up) are shown in Table 9 along with the weighted estimated seroprevalences in the NBRDI project population and their effects on risk of BRD. High percentages of the NBRDI project population were estimated to be seropositive for two (28%) or three (49%) viruses at induction. Compared to animals that were seropositive for all four viruses at induction, those seropositive for less than four viruses were at increased risk of BRD, with risk progressively increasing with seropositivity to fewer viruses (Table 9 ). Those seronegative for all of the viruses were at highest risk BRD (OR 2.4, 95% credible interval: 1.3-4.3). Based on weighted averages of seroincreases between induction and follow-up, seroincrease for one (40%) or two (23%) viruses was common in the NBRDI project population. Those animals seroincreasing for one virus were at increased risk (OR 1.4, 95% credible interval: 1.2-1.7) compared to those not seroincreasing for any viruses (Table 9) , with those seroincreasing for two, three or four viruses at moderate to markedly increased risk (OR 2.0, 95% credible interval: 1.6-2.4, OR 2.1, 95% credible interval: 1.6-2.6 and OR 1.6, 95% credible interval: 1.0-2.4).
