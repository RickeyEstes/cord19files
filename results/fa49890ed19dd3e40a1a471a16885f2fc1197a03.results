Severe PGD3 After LTx Induces Exosomes From the Transplanted Organ, Which Are Released Into the Circulation and Contain Lung SAgs Ka1T and Col-V Exosomes were isolated from the plasma of 5 LTxRs with PGD3 and 5 LTxRs without PGD (ie, PGD0) diagnosed according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines. The results, presented in Figure 3 , A, demonstrate exosomes present in the circulation with specific marker CD9, although the quantity is greater in the plasma of LTxRs with PGD3 than in the patients with PGD0. However, only LTxRs diagnosed with PGD3 induced circulating exosomes with lung SAgs Ka1T and Col-V (illustration of 2/5 patient data). Semiquantitative analysis by densitometry, shown in Figure 3 , B, demonstrates that exosomes isolated from LTxRs with PGD3 have significantly greater levels of both lung SAgs Col-V (2.29-fold increase, P ¼ .0087) and Ka1T (3.25-fold increase, P ¼ .0087) than patients with PGD0.
