Generation and characterization of recombinant MV vac2 encoding different forms of the Ovaantigen. To was chosen since especially the cellular immune-responses and respective immune-dominant peptides in mice such as used in our studies are well known and can thus considerably support characterization of such responses. For this purpose, Ova was genetically fused to the transmembrane domain of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR-TM) giving rise to a membrane-bound extracellular variant (DisOva) that should be readily incorporated into retroviral particles (Fig. 1b) . A recombinant MV (MV vac2 -gag-DisOva) encoding DisOva in an additional transcription unit (ATU) following the P gene in combination with a second, MLV Gag-encoding transgene cassette in front of the viral N gene, which give rise to in situ produced VLPs, was also generated (Fig. 1c,d) . To analyze the immunogenicity of particle-associated antigen presentation by the resulting Ova-VLPs in comparison to exclusive surface antigen expression, a variant only carrying DisOva (MV vac2 -DisOva) as well as a recombinant MV just encoding MLV-Gag (MV vac2 -gag) for the release of bare VLPs have been generated (Fig. 1c) . All recombinant viruses were successfully rescued and amplified up to passage 10 (P10) in Vero cells with comparable titers of up to 5 × 10 7 TCID 50 /ml. The stability of the ova and gag gene cassettes additionally introduced into the viral genomes was confirmed by sequencing after P3 and P10 (data not shown). Expression of DisOva was also verified for viruses in P3 or P10. Antigen-expression was clearly detectable in Vero cells infected with either MV vac2 -DisOva or MV vac2 -gag-DisOva, and stable over several passages (Fig. 2a) . Moreover, electron microscopy combined with immunogold-labeling against Ova revealed incorporation of DisOva into retroviral VLPs isolated from the supernatant of MV vac2 -gag-DisOva infected cells, while no Ova was detected on VLPs isolated from the supernatant of MV vac2 -gag infected cells, as expected (Fig. 2b) . To assess the replication efficiency of the different vectors, multi-step growth kinetics of cell-associated and released virus were performed following infection at low MOI = 0.03 (Fig. 2c,d) . Compared to the GFP-encoding control virus MV vac2 -GFP, MVs encompassing the DisOva transgene cassette together with or without MLV gag grew with similar kinetics and reached similar maximum titers as the control virus. Thus, cloning and rescue of both MVs-derived vectors resulted in expression of the inserted antigen(s) in infected cells without impact on viral replication or genetic stability. Antigen-specific cellular immunity against vector and transgene is induced by Ova-presenting MV. To analyze the induction of vector-or Ova-specific cellular immune responses, splenocytes of IFNAR −/− -CD46Ge mice vaccinated with MV vac2 -DisOva or MV vac2 -gag-DisOva (controls: MV vac2 -ATU empty vaccine or MV vac2 -gag presenting naked retroviral particles) in a prime-boost protocol (Fig. 3a) were isolated and analyzed for vector-and antigen-specific IFN-γ secretion by ELISpot assay. Isolated splenocytes were stimulated by MV bulk antigen to detect vector-specific T-cell responses, the MHC-I restricted SIINFEKL (SIN) Ova-peptide to detect specific CD8 + T-cell responses, the MHC-II restricted ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR (ISQ) Ova-peptide to detect specific CD4 + T-cell responses, or concanavalin A (ConA) as control for general T-cell reactivity. Splenocytes of all mice revealed a similar basic reactivity to broad T-cell stimulation by ConA, as shown by the high numbers of IFN-γ secreting cells with more than 750 IFN-γ secreting cells per 5 × 10 5 splenocytes (Fig. 3b) . Assessment of anti-vector cellular immunity using MV bulk antigen as stimulus revealed robust induction of IFN-γ secreting cells (>250/5 × 10 5 ) irrespective of additionally encoded antigens or particles. Thus, there was no impact on general or vector-specific T-cell reactivity associated with the different vaccine candidates. ELISpot assays using splenocytes of animals vaccinated with membrane-bound DisOva-encoding MVs with or without MLV-Gag revealed approximately 600 IFN-γ secreting cells per 5 × 10 5 splenocytes after specific re-stimulation with SIINFEKL peptide (SIN). In contrast, control mice vaccinated with MV vac2 -ATU or MV vac2 -gag revealed only background responses of around 10 IFN-γ producing cells per 5 × 10 5 splenocytes, comparable to non-stimulated splenocytes (mock). Of note, Ova-specific re-stimulation with ISQ triggered statistically significant results with around 15-45 IFN-γ secreting cells per 5 × 10 5 splenocytes only for splenocytes of mice immunized with MV presenting DisOva on the surface of in situ produced particles (Fig. 3b) . These data argue for robust induction of antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell responses by MV encoding an immunogenic antigen, in general, whereas CD4 + T helper cells, which can be re-stimulated by the ISQ peptide, were significantly induced only by particle-associated antigen, as expected. Antigen-specific humoral immunity against vector and transgene is induced by Ova-presenting MV. To elucidate the extent of humoral immune responses, mice immunized as described were used to determine antibody prevalence in serum. First, induction of neutralizing antibodies against MV was analyzed (Fig. 3c ). All groups immunized with recombinant MV developed mean virus neutralizing titers (VNT) of 500-700 already after the first immunization (Fig. 3c, middle panel) . These mean titers increased after the second immunization to 1,200-2,560 (Fig. 3c, right panel) . Again, no differences between the individual candidate vaccines became evident. To assess the induction of Ova-specific humoral immune responses, antibodies binding to Ova were quantified by indirect ELISA (Fig. 3d ). Ova-specific antibodies were found already after the first immunization ( Fig. 3d , middle panel), with significantly increased titers over the control group only for vaccines encoding particle-associated antigen. Both variants of DisOva-encoding MV reached mean antibody concentrations of more than 50 µg/ml at day 21 after the booster vaccination. In summary, the MV-derived model vaccines expressing Ova either on the infected cells alone or in combination with presentation on in situ generated retroviral VLPs induced strong Ova-specific cellular and humoral immune responses.
