Effect of COS on the P app -value of phenolic acids in the apical-to-basolateral (AP-BL) direction in vitro Caco-2 monolayer model As shown in Fig. 4 , COS at the low, medium and high concentrations caused a significant, concentration-dependent increase in the P app -value for neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The highest P app -value for neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid was increased to 5700% (9.11 ± 0.43) × 10 −6 cm/s, 9800% (18.97 ± 3.35) × 10 −6 cm/s, 12,800% (14.10 ± 1.4) × 10 −6 cm/s, 3900% (13.90 ± 0.10) × 10 −6 cm/s and 9800% (13.00 ± 0.30) × 10 −6 cm/s with addition of 0.1% (w/v) of COS.
