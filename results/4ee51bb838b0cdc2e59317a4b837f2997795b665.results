From the 936 patients selected, 909 had sufficient available frozen swabs for DNA extraction. We successfully genotyped 792 samples: 268 from ILI A(H1N1)pdm09 positives patients (84 hospitalized cases and 184 non-hospitalized controls) and 524 from ILI A(H1N1)pdm09 negatives patients (173 hospitalized cases and 351 non-hospitalized controls) corresponding to an overall success rate of 87% (95% CI: 84.8%-89.2%) that was similar in all the 4 groups of patients (p = 0.998) (S1 Table) . No significant differences were found regarding the age (p = 0.382) and sex (p = 0.468) distributions between cases and controls among ILI A(H1N1)pdm09 positive patients and ILI A (H1N1)pdm09 negative patients (Table 1) . No significant differences were found between the analysed influenza positive hospitalized cases and influenza diagnosed hospitalized patients present in the NHD database, regarding age (p = 0.320) and sex (p = 0.133) (S2 Table) . Concerning IFITM3 rs12252 variant characterization (Table 2) , 3 patients carrying the CC genotype were detected (2 were ILI A(H1N1)pdm09 positive hospitalized patients and 1 was a ILI A(H1N1)pdm09 negative non-hospitalized patient). Regarding A(H1N1)pdm09 infected patients, 10.7% (95% CI: 4.1-17.3) of the hospitalized cases and 17.4% (95% CI:11.9-22.9) of the non-hospitalized controls had the CT genotype. The hospitalized A(H1N1)pdm09 infected cases had a C allele frequency of 7.7% (95% CI: 3.6-11.8) while the non-hospitalized controls had a C allele frequency of 8.7% (95% CI: 5.8-11.6). In the A(H1N1)pdm09 negative patients, 22.5% (95% CI:16.3-28.8) of the hospitalized cases and 10.8% (95% CI: 7.6-14.1) of the non-hospitalized controls carried the CT genotype. The hospitalized cases have a C allele frequency of 11.3% (95% CI: 8.0-14.6) while the non-hospitalized controls presented a C allele frequency of 5.7% (95% CI: 2.2-9.2) ( Table 2) . To assess if there is a higher risk of hospitalization for patients who carry the C allele both in the presence and absence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, we performed a stratified analysis assuming a dominant model, as presented in Table 2 . In the presence of A(H1N1) pdm09 virus infection, we observed that there is not a higher risk of being hospitalized for patients with the CT/CC genotype compared to the TT genotype (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.33-1.50). However, when we use the same approach to assess if there is a higher risk of being hospitalized for the C allele carriers in patients negative for A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection we found that the risk of being hospitalized among the CT/CC genotype carriers is significantly higher than the risk of being hospitalized in the TT genotype carriers (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 2.54 (95% CI: 1.54-4.19) ).
