Out of the 249,421 notified deaths over the 40 years studied, 37,775 (15%), 35,138 (14%), 101,111 (41%) and 75,266 (30%) consisted of infants, children aged 1-4, older children and adults aged 5-59, and the population aged 60 or above, respectively (the date of birth or date of death was missing for 131 cases). Due to shifts in the age structure of the population and the decline in under-five mortality, the two younger age groups experienced a downward trend while the two older age groups showed an upward trend in their monthly mortality counts ( Figure 2 ). The regular ups and downs in these time series correspond to the seasonal variations. The amplitude of these monthly variations seems to have reduced over time for infants and young children.
