In vitro growth properties of WT and P/V mutant SV5 viruses in mouse cells As diagramed in Fig. 1 , we employed two matched pairs of WT SV5 and P/V mutant viruses which differ in their ability to limit host cell responses. One pair consisted of the P/V-N100D mutant virus, which can suppress IFN signaling in murine cells (Young et al., 2001) , and WT rSV5, which cannot block IFN signaling in mouse cells as the proper control. The second pair consisted of the P/V-CPI− mutant, which is a potent inducer of antiviral responses, and a WT rSV5 encoding GFP as an additional transcription unit between HN and L, which was the proper control virus to account for the GFP gene encoded by P/V-CPI− ( Fig. 1 ; Wansley and Parks, 2002) . This additional gene has been shown previously to have no detectable effect on rSV5 growth properties (He et al., 1997) . To determine the relative ability of WT and the two P/V mutants to modulate IFN-I signaling, mouse CL7 fibroblast cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene plasmid under control of an ISRE and then infected at high moi with WT rSV5 or one of the P/V mutants. Fifteen hours pi, cells were challenged with 1,000 units of IFN-beta, and luciferase activity was assayed at 6 h post-challenge. As shown in Fig. 2A , mock-infected cells responded to IFN challenge by increasing luciferase activity (black bar). Cells infected with rSV5-WT also responded to IFN challenge with slightly higher levels of luciferase activity, but cells infected with the P/V-N100D mutant were largely non-responsive to IFN . Multicycle growth of WT and P/V mutant SV5 in mouse CL7 cells. Mouse CL7 cells were infected at an moi of 0.05 with the indicated WT rSV5 or P/V mutants. At the indicated times pi, media were collected and assayed for infectious virus by plaque assay. Data are the average of three independent experiments. stimulation ( Fig. 2A ) as previously reported (Young et al., 2001) . As shown in Fig. 2B , cells infected with the P/V-CPI− virus showed elevated IFN-I signaling with or without added IFN-beta, similar to that reported previously for P/V-CPI− infection of human epithelial cells . The status of STAT1 in mouse cells infected with our WT rSV5 and P/V mutant viruses was analyzed. CL7 cells were infected at high moi with rSV5-WT or P/V-N100D, and cell lysates were analyzed at different times pi by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2C , cells infected with rSV5-WT had higher levels of STAT1 than mock-infected cells, consistent with IFN induction and signaling pathways being activated. By contrast, infection with the P/V-N100D mutant did not significantly change STAT1 levels compared to that seen for mockinfected cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that all cells were infected by the P/V-N100D virus at the high moi used in these experiments (not shown). Infection with the P/V-N100D virus blocked the ability of exogenously-added IFN-beta to activate STAT1 phosphorylation. This is evident in Fig. 2D , where treatment of mock-infected or rSV5-WTinfected CL7 cells with IFN-beta resulted in phosphorylation of STAT1 on tyrosine 701, a critical modification for STAT1 activation (Shuai et al., 1993) . By contrast, treatment of P/V-N100D-infected mouse cells with IFN-beta did not lead to increased STAT1 phosphorylation. Together, these data support previous reports (Young et al., 2001 ) that mouse cells infected with the P/V-N100D virus are defective in response to IFN, but extend those findings to show that the P/V-N100D mutant blocks STAT1 phosphorylation by a mechanism that does not include targeted degradation. The data in Figs. 2A and B (grey bars) show that murine cells infected with rSV5-WT, rSV5-GFP or the P/V-CPI− mutant have activated IFN signaling pathways, even in the absence of exogenouslyadded IFN. To test the hypothesis that infection with these viruses induced IFN, CL7 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene plasmid under control of the IFN-beta promoter and infected at high moi with the viruses indicated in Fig. 3A . Levels of luciferase were determined at 15 h pi. Infection with the two viruses encoding a WT P/V gene (rSV5-WT and rSV5-GFP) resulted in a~2-3 fold increase in IFN-beta promoter activity, whereas cells infected with the P/V-CPI− virus showed nearly a 10 fold increase. By contrast, cells infected with the P/V-N100D mutant showed luciferase levels that were indistinguishable from those seen with mock-infected cells. These results were supported by ELISA data, in which levels of secreted IFN-beta and IFN-alpha were determined at 24 h pi. As shown in Fig. 3B , the P/V-CPI− mutant induced slightly higher levels of IFNbeta than either the rSV5-WT or rSV5-GFP viruses. However, the P/V-N100D mutant was a poor inducer of IFN-beta. The P/V-CPI− mutant was the only virus that induced high levels of IFN-alpha. Taken together, these results demonstrate that WT SV5 and the P/V mutants fall into two groups: 1) the P/V-N100D mutant virus, which is a poor inducer of IFN and limits IFN signaling, and 2) the P/V-CPI− mutant, which, like WT rSV5-GFP, is defective in blocking IFN signaling, but which additionally is a potent inducer of IFN, as it induces IFN to higher-than-WT levels. As predicted by these properties, the P/V-N100D virus grew in CL7 cells to titers that were approximately 2 logs higher in multi-step growth assays (Fig. 4A ). Unexpectedly however, the P/V-CPI− virus grew to higher titers than rSV5-GFP (Fig. 4B ), despite being a more potent activator of IFN responses. This enhanced growth may be a consequence of higher levels of viral gene expression and genome replication as described previously in human epithelial cell lines .
