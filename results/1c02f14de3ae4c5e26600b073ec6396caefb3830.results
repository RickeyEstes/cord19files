Outbound traffic from Wuhan started to increase rapidly from January 13 and fell sharply after January 23, 2020, when the travel ban was implemented ( Figure 1A-1C) . By January 23, 71% of people who traveled out of Wuhan went to other cities in Hubei province and 29% migrated to other provinces. The incidence of COVID-19 within and outside of Hubei province fluctuated in similar patterns with the change in traffic ( Figure 1E-1G) , suggesting a lagged association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence. After prewhitening the COVID-19 incidence time series by the ARIMA model fitted on the outbound traffic time series, we calculated the cross-correlation coefficients between daily outbound traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence for each province. There were great geographical variations in time lags and correlation coefficients (Figure 2A-2B) . K-means clustering analysis identified 3 latent clusters of provinces according to time lag and correlation coefficients ( Figure 2C ). The estimated time lags between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence were <1 week in 42% of provinces, 1 week in 39% of provinces, and 2-3 weeks in 19% of provinces. We examined the potential contributors to provincial variations in the association between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence. The analyses showed that the time lags of the migration All rights reserved.

Correlation coefficients were positively associated with geographical distance (β=0.1 per 1000 km, P=0.03; Figure 3E ) and negatively with GDP (β= -0.01 per 1000 USD/person, P=0.02; Figure 3G ). Population density was not associated with either the lag or correlation coefficient. However, in sensitivity analyses excluding Shanghai from the analysis, whose population density far exceeds all other provinces, population density was negatively associated with the correlation coefficient (β= -0.15 per 1000 persons/sq.km, P=0.03). The optimal ARIMAX models for each province cluster are summarized in Table 1 . The ARIMA (2,1,0) was optimal for provinces with <1 week of lag, and the ARIMA (1,1,0) was optimal for provinces with ≥1 week of lag. The model-predicted cumulative incidence based on actual traffic data demonstrated good fit with the observed incidences ( Figure 4A -4C, Table 1 ). The predicted cumulative incidences would be higher in all three clusters of provinces based on 2019 traffic data ( Figure 4D-4F) , and the differences were projected to grow larger moving forward. It is estimated that there would be approximately 2,123 more cases in provinces with <1 week lag, 4,363 more in provinces with 1 week of lag, and 13,282 more in provinces with 2-3 weeks of lag by the end of February, although the predicted value was not significantly different from the observed in provinces with <1 week of lag (Table 1) . We estimated that the travel ban may have reduced a total of 19,768 (95% CI: 13,589, 25,946) cases outside of Wuhan by the end of February.
