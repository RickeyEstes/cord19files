First we evaluated how the case-reproduction ratio (R t ) of the BTV-1 epidemic for the whole of Andalusia varied through the epidemic. Considering the natural months between July and November, and using the algorithm for the closest farm (algorithm 1), the R t value reached its maximum value (4.6) in July, at the start of the epidemic, then decreased to 2.2 by August, and dropped below 1 by September (0.8). By October it had decreased to 0.02 and remained close to 0 in November. There were no significant differences in R t values when algorithm 2 (equally proportional within a distance) was applied, except that values for July and August were a bit lower (3.3 and 1.9, respectively) and for September and October values were a bit higher (0.9 and 0.2, respectively). Similarly, R t values when algorithm 3 (proportional to distance) was applied were analogous to those obtained using algorithm 1, but values for July were a bit lower (3.3) and for August were a bit higher (2.4) . In contrast to the monthly values of R t , the number of infected farms reported per month went from 113 in July, to 1010 in August and reached a maximum in September (2089 infected farms). In October, despite the low value of R t , there was a significant number of infected farms reported (1192), which rapidly decreased to only 15 farms infected in November. If we use a smaller time step (i.e. one week) to evaluate the variation of the case-reproduction ratio for the whole of Andalusia, we observe a much higher heterogeneity in the values of R t , particularly at the start of the epidemic. Fig 1 shows how the first week of the epidemic R t reached a very high value (20) , decreased to 2.6 by week 2, increased to 6.3 in the third week (mid-July), and then there was a slow progressive decrease, so that it was not until week 12 (mid-September) that R t fell below 1. Looking at this smaller time-step (R t values per week) it is easier to appreciate that the temporal pattern of the for the whole BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia is the result of both the intensity of local BTV transmission within established foci and BTV expansion to new areas (i.e. new foci). If we look at the weekly estimations of R t for the whole of Andalusia, the high value obtained in week 1 is likely to be the result of the R t value in focus 4 (where the epidemic starts), while estimations for weeks 2 and 3 are probably linked to introduction and spread within focus 1, and the maintenance of high R t values between week 4 (22 nd of July) and week 7 (12 th of August) are highly dependent on the introduction and spread within focus 20 (the largest focus in the epidemic) (Fig 1 and Fig 2) . While in some of the foci (e.g. focus 4 in Fig 1) , there was a delay of 1 or 2 weeks between the primary infection (as a result of BTV introduction) and the first secondary cases arising as a result of local spread, in other cases (e.g. focus 1 and 20 in Fig 1) , there was no such a delay. In general, the foci initiated earlier in the epidemic tended to be larger (i.e. more farms infected) (Fig 3) , and of longer duration than the foci initiated later. The results show that there was a great variation in the effectiveness of BTV spread among the 58 foci. In some foci, BTV-1 seemed to fail to establish a continuous transmission within the new area, and none or a few secondary cases were produced (e.g. foci 10 and 11 in Fig 2) . In fact, of the 58 foci, 21 had 4 infected farms or less. However, in some other cases, BTV easily spread in the new area, and transmission was maintained for many weeks with hundreds of secondary cases, for example focus 4 (791 cases in 18 weeks) and focus 1 (748 cases in 18 weeks) (Fig 2) . In some cases as a consequence of BTV local spread, foci ended up overlapping with each other (for example foci 2, 3, 7 and 8 in Fig 2) . Between weeks 3 and 9 (end of August), the slow progressive decrease of R t values, coincided with an even slower progressive increase of the time needed for the completion of the EIP in the affected farms (Fig 4) . Between weeks 10 and 16 (mid-October), increase of EIPs becomes steeper, going from a mean of 5.7 days between weeks 3 and 9 to mean of 9.3 days between weeks 10 and 16, which results in a rapid decrease of R t values, that after week 13 are close to 0 (Fig 2  and Fig 4) . After week 16 (mid-October), the EIPs of infected farms were frequently above 20 days, and in many cases temperatures did not allow the completion of the EIP. Fig 5 shows the relationship between the weekly R t values for the whole epidemic and the mean weekly temperatures at the farms affected by the epidemic. For the first half of the epidemic (between the 1 st of July and the 2 nd of September) temperatures were more or less constant at approximately 25°C, while R t values showed a decreasing trend. In contrast, for the second half of the epidemic (between the 9 th of September and the 4 th of November) decreasing mean temperatures coincided with a further decrease of R t values, which fell below the threshold of 1 when temperatures dropped below 21°C. We found a positive correlation between temperature and the R t values (r = 0.44), which was very close to significant (p = 0.06). Correlation analysis of the different environmental predictors potentially related to R t showed that the estimated median maximum abundance of C. imicola was correlated with the 95% upper limit of the credible interval of estimated maximum abundance of C. imicola, as well as with the median and 95% upper limit of the credible interval for total Culicoides (as C. imicola represented more than 99% of the captures in the affected areas of Andalusia). Therefore, only median estimated maximum abundance of C. imicola was retained for further analysis. There was also a positive correlation between slope and elevation (Spearman's rank correlation = 0.99), therefore only slope was retained. Considering the relationship between R t and the predictors, support in the data for the best model was split amongst several models; with 16 models receiving approximately equal support in the data (delta AICc value of <2.0; S1 Table) . Of these top 16 models, all models included the proportion of area overlapped and sheep density, 14 models included EIP, 8 models included red deer habitat suitability, and 7 models included slope (S3 Table) . The best fitting model included these five predictors, of which proportion of area overlapped, EIP and sheep were strongly significant predictors of R t , and red deer suitability was close to significant (Table 1) . For each day of increase in the duration of the EIP of the farms within a given focus, the value of R t was reduced by 0.0041. For each increase of 1% in the area overlapped, the value of R t was reduced by 2.64. For each unit increase in the number of sheep per km 2 , the value of R t was increased by 0.14. Red deer suitability showed a weak negative correlation with R t values, although it was not statistically significant. The random effects components of the model indicated that residual spatial variability between foci not accounted for by fixed effects was much lower (SD: 0.00017; Table 1 ) than residual temporal variability through time (weeks) within the different foci (SD: 4.38; Table 1 ). Overall residual variation not attributed to spatial variation between foci or temporal variation within foci was 0.029 (Table 1) . Based on our estimations, the infection of the first farm occurred in the South-East of the province of Cadiz on the 25 th of June (Fig 6) . The second farm was infected 5 days later (30 th of June), but it was located at 128 km from the first infected farm, in the South-East of the province of Huelva. The third farm was infected on the 1 st of July, in the South of Huelva, 26.8 km away from the previous farm. On the 2 nd of July, a fourth farm was infected, also in Huelva, but in the North-East of the province, 71.3 km away from the closest infected farm at that time. The fifth farm was infected on the 4 th of July in Tarifa, in the southernmost area of the province of Cadiz, but 46 km away from the first infected farm. However, taking into account the temperatures on those dates on those farms, which determine the time needed for the completion of the EIP, it seems that none of those farms became infectious before the 5 th of July, and therefore were not epidemiologically linked. The abovementioned case in Tarifa (fifth infected farm) was actually the first case of BTV-1 confirmed by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture (on the 25 th of July 2007). By the 26 th of July movement restrictions were imposed in Cadiz, the majority of Malaga and Seville, and the eastern area of Huelva [27] (Fig 7) . However, by that date, BTV-1 had spread to other areas of Andalusia, including 3 farms outside restricted areas (Fig 7) . Despite movement restrictions, 35 of the 58 foci identified throughout the whole epidemic, were initiated during the 10 days that followed the implementation of those measures (Fig 3 and  Fig 7) , with appearance of new foci in the western area of Huelva and the previously unaffected provinces of Cordoba and Almeria period. Although the majority of farms infected throughout the epidemic were located in Western Andalusia, there were foci in the 8 provinces of Andalusia.
