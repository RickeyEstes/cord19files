3.1. Tick exposure I. scapularis or the blacklegged tick is the primary vector for Lyme disease in the United States. In the United States and other areas of the world, dozens of tick species have been implicated in the spread of Lyme and Lyme-like Borrelia pathogens to humans and animals (e.g. Barbour, Maupin, Teltow, Carter, & Piesman, 1996; Burgdorfer, 1984; Clark, 2004; Clark, Leydet, & Hartman, 2013; Harrison et al., 2010; Mather & Mather, 1990; Nakao, Miyamoto, & Fukunaga, 1994; Piesman & Sinsky, 1988; Piesman, Clark, Dolan, Happ, & Burkot, 1999) . Epidemiological studies have explored the relationship between ticks, climate, seasonality, host species, and disease risk in a variety of local or regional contexts (e.g. Estrada-Peña, 2003; Sumilo et al., 2008; Wielinga et al., 2006) . Predictive models have been developed using remote sensing, satellite imagery, geographical information systems, and advanced statistical analysis (e.g. Daniels et al., 1997; Diuk-Wasser et al., 2012; Werden et al., 2014) . The research indicates that vegetation and climate are the two central predictors of suitable/unsuitable habitats for tick species and it is therefore possible to identify high-risk areas and potential emergent areas for Lyme disease. The areas with the highest risk for human exposure are those that contain suitable tick habitat, ticks capable of transmitting the Lyme disease pathogen, and have high host activity (Gray et al., 1998; Schulze, Jordan, & Hung, 1995) . Empirical approaches have laid the groundwork for a better understanding of the relationship between environmental factors and tick distribution. However, they fail to account for the vital role that human behaviour plays in the disease transmission process. The global increase in interaction between humans and wildlife through population growth, economic development, and an increasingly mobile society that brings people into endemic areas for work and leisure is amplifying personal risk (Kollaritsch et al., 2011; Quine et al., 2011; Rizzolli, Hauffe, Vourc'h, Neteler, & Rosa, 2011) . The rapid expansion of the tourism industry and air travel is of concern as the importation of pathogens and vectors by travellers (purposefully or not) and specifically ticks and tick-borne disease pathogens is a real threat to human and ecological health (e.g. Daugschies, 2001; Hall, 2006; Holzer, 2005; Schuster et al., 2008) . European case reports demonstrate statistical relationships between outdoor recreation in tick-infested forests and tick-borne disease infection (e.g. Daniel, Danielov a, K rí z, Jirsa, & No zi cka, 2003; Kahl & Radda, 1988; Sumilo et al., 2008) . Early case studies in the United States failed to show a significant increase in risk associated with outdoor recreation (e.g. Bowen et al., 1984; Ciesielski et al., 1989; Falco & Fish, 1989) but Smith et al.'s (1988) research found that persons who had spent more than 30 h per week in outdoor activities in endemic areas were 2.5 times more likely to test positive for Lyme disease. Since the 1980s, a small body of literature has evaluated the occupational risk for Lyme disease. In New York, Schwartz and Goldstein et al. (1990) confirmed that Lyme disease is a hazard of outdoor work and a study in New Jersey found that outdoor workers were nearly five times more likely to have contracted Lyme disease than indoor workers (Bowen et al., 1984) . In the broader international and tickborne disease contexts, the research shows similar relationships between tick exposure and infection. In Lithuania, Motiejunas, Bunikis, Barbour, & Sadziene (1994) report that those at highest risk for a tick-borne disease (established through seropositivity testing) are outdoor workers (32 percent tested positive/N ¼ 6187). Recent case studies in Europe (e.g. Bartosik, Sitarz, Szyma nska, & Buczek, 2011; Bochnickova & Szilagyiova, 2011; Franke, Hildebrandt, Meier, Straube, & Dorn, 2011; Jameson & Medlock, 2011) confirm that ticks, Lyme and other tick-borne disease pathogens are common across Europe and they pose a significant occupational risk to outdoor workers. Two studies in Poland involving serological testing of both ticks and humans confirmed that those who perform work in forest environments are regularly exposed to tick-borne disease pathogens and as such, are at a higher risk of infection. Two Dutch studies of Lyme disease seroprevalence in outdoor workers showed a statistically significant risk (OR, 3.7; 95 percent CI, 1.5e9.7 and OR, 15.0; 95 percent CI, 5.5e42.0) relative to the control group (Kuiper et al., 1991; van Charante, Groen, Mulder, Rijpkema, & Osterhaus, 1998) . In 2002, Piacentino and Schwartz published a meta-analysis of articles on the occupational risk of Lyme disease and report that the scientific evidence demonstrates that those who work outdoors in endemic areas are at an increased risk for contracting Lyme disease because of their exposure to ticks. It is evident in this body of literature that exposure to ticks is the single most significant human risk factor and the first line of defence against tick bites should be avoidance of these areas completely or seasonally (during periods of high tick activity), or where appropriate, control of the tick population. Given the geospatial expansion of tick species, increasing human mobility and encroachment into tick habitat, and the attendant expectation that future interactions between humans and ticks are likely to increase, vigilance and on-going monitoring is required as new and extant tick-borne pathogens pose potential threats to public health.
