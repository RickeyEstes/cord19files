Antemortem effusion specimens were collected from 17 cats (peritoneal fluid: n = 13; pleural fluid: n = 4), of which 10 were diagnosed with effusive FIP at postmortem examination and seven were negative for FIP at postmortem examination (Table 1) . Effusion protein concentrations were higher in cats with FIP than in cats where FIP was ruled out at postmortem examination (FIP: n = 6, median 5.1 g/dL, range 3.0-6.0 g/dL; non-FIP: n = 7, median 2.6 g/dL, range 2.0-5.9 g/dL; P = 0.027). There was no significant difference between the two groups in effusion WCC (FIP: n = 6, range 402-47,000/lL; non-FIP: n = 6, range <100-54,100/lL; P > 0.05). The 10 cats that were diagnosed with FIP on histopathological evaluation of specimens collected at postmortem examination had positive DIF results (Fig. 1) . Of seven cats with postmortem results that ruled out FIP, five had negative DIF results and two had positive DIF results (cases 5 and 12). Case 5 had a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; the DIF test was negative when repeated on a peritoneal effusion specimen and also when performed using the same method on a cryostat sample of spleen, both collected at postmortem examination. Case 12 had a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma; in this case, the DIF test was negative when repeated on a specimen of spleen collected at postmortem examination, while cryostat sections of the spleen, intestine, liver and kidney were DIF positive. Diagnostic statistics from this study and from cases reported in two previously published studies where there was postmortem confirmation of DIF test results are presented in Table 2 (Cammarata Parodi et al., 1993; Hartmann et al., 2003) . When serial testing was performed on effusion specimens that were DIF test positive on initial testing and on duplicate specimens that were stored at RT (21-25°C; n = 7; case 8 not tested) or refrigerated (4°C; n = 7; case 2 not tested), positive results persisted for at least 1-8 days for specimens stored at RT and for at least 2-13 days in refrigerated specimens (Table 3) . DIF positive effusion specimens kept at RT and repeatedly tested until a negative result was obtained first became DIF negative after 2, 5 and 7 days. In three cases (cases 11, 13 and 14) , specimens stored refrigerated still tested DIF positive when the same specimens stored at RT had begun to test negative (Table 3) . At 21-25°C, the latest recorded positive result was at 1 day (n = 1), 2 days (n = 1), 4 days (n = 2), 5 days (n = 1), 6 days (n = 1) and 8 days (n = 1), while the first recorded negative result was at 2 days (n = 1), 5 days (n = 1) and 7 days (n = 1); the time that results became negative was not recorded for five cases. At 4°C, the latest recorded positive result was at 2 days (n = 1), 4 days (n = 1), 5 days (n = 2), 6 days (n = 1), 8 days (n = 1) and 13 days (n = 1), while the time of the latest recorded positive result was not recorded for one case; at 4°C, the time of the first negative result was not recorded for any of the eight cases.
