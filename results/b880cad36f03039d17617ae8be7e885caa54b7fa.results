The plasmids encoding each of the chimeric proteins shown in Fig EV1 were generated and tested for transient expression of the matching F proteins in CV-1 cells, as described in Materials and Methods. Some chimeric proteins were expressed at very low or undetectable levels and were not further analyzed. Chimeric proteins that reached expression levels above 10% of the wild-type protein were incorporated into vaccinia virus recombinants for expression and further antigenic and immunogenic characterization as described in subsequent sections. Expression and characterization of postfusion hMPV F with antigenic site II from hRSV F Based on the similarity of hMPV F and hRSV F antigenic site II structures , it was expected that certain amino acids could be exchanged between the two proteins without disrupting the overall local folding . Indeed, the chimeric proteins F-414, F-415, and F-416 ( Fig EV1) , with increasing numbers of hRSV F residues replacing the equivalent postfusion hMPV F residues, were expressed at high level and therefore initially analyzed. Since the expression level of F-414 turned out to be the same as that of F-415, the former protein was not further considered. Much of the C-terminal helix of hMPV F site II in F-415 was made hRSV-like by swapping seven amino acids unique to each protein ( Fig 1A and B) . Additionally, the chimeric F-416 protein incorporated six further amino acid changes in the hMPV F backbone to reproduce almost entirely the amino acid sequence of hRSV F site II (Fig 1A and B ). Both F-415 and F-416 were readily purified to homogeneity by Ni 2+ chromatography followed by gel filtration and showed the characteristic cone shape of postfusion hMPV F when examined by negative stain EM ( Fig EV2) . When tested for binding to site-specific mAbs, F-415 had lost reactivity with the hMPV F site II mAbs MF9, MF12, MF14, and MF15 but retained reactivity with the hMPV F site IV-specific mAb MF16; in addition, it gained full and partial reactivity with the hRSV F site II mAbs motavizumab (Mz) and 47F, respectively ( Fig 1C) . F-416 also lost reactivity with hMPV F site II-specific mAbs but gained full reactivity not only with Mz but also with 47F ( Fig 1C) . To have a better estimate of the affinities of Mz and 47F for the chimeric proteins, the binding of their respective Fab fragments to wild-type postfusion hRSV F and the chimeric F proteins was assessed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Fig 2) . Mz Fab bound to the F-415 and F-416 chimeras with a k on similar to that observed for the wild-type postfusion hRSV F but showed a much faster k off for F-415 than for the wild-type and F-416 proteins. Consequently, Mz affinity for the F-416 chimera was similar to that for postfusion hRSV F but was markedly decreased for F-415 (see K D values). No binding of 47F Fab to F-415 was detectable (Fig 2) , and although binding of 47F Fab to F-416 was quantifiable-with a slightly faster k on compared with wild-type postfusion hRSV F-a much faster k off reduced its affinity for F-416 by 10-fold compared to postfusion hRSV F. Therefore, although site II of F-415 and particularly F-416 protein resembled the antigenic properties of this site in hRSV F, there were some remaining distinguishable differences between wild-type and chimeric proteins. We noted that although ELISA binding of Mz and 47F to the chimeric proteins followed the same trend as that of their Fab fragments in SPR, significant differences could be perceived with the two methods. Thus, whereas binding of 47F Fab to F-415 was negligible by SPR (Fig 2) , substantial binding of mAb 47F to F-415 was observed in the ELISA (Fig 1C) . Similarly, although binding of mAb Mz to F-415 was comparable to postfusion hRSV F in the ELISA, a substantial reduction in Mz Fab affinity for this chimeric protein was observed by SPR. These differences are likely due to the higher density of proteins bound to the ELISA plates than to the SPR chips and the bivalent nature of antibodies compared with the monovalent Fabs. To assess the immunogenicity of the F-415 and F-416 chimeras, groups of five mice were inoculated twice (4 weeks apart) i.m. with 10 lg/dose of each purified protein adjuvanted with CpG. The same inoculation regimen was used for postfusion hRSV F and hMPV F, as controls. Three weeks after the last immunization, mice were bled and their sera tested in ELISA for antibody binding to the wildtype postfusion forms of either hRSV F or hMPV F ( Fig 3A) . As reported, the wild-type postfusion F proteins induced high levels of antibodies that bound to the homologous protein but failed to bind (or bound very poorly in the case of serum from mice inoculated with hMPV F and tested against hRSV F) to the heterologous protein A B C Figure 1 . Antigenic characterization of postfusion hMPV F chimeras with amino acids from hRSV F antigenic site II. A Partial amino acid sequences of the hMPV F (blue) and hRSV F (red) antigenic site II (Toiron et al, 1996; Lopez et al, 1998; McLellan et al, 2011b) . Partial sequences of the F-415 and F-416 chimeras are color coded to indicate the origin of their antigenic site II residues. Amino acids shared by hMPV F and hRSV F are colored purple. The remaining sequences of F-415 and F-416 are derived from hMPV F. B Surface representation of the hMPV F structure in the postfusion conformation . One of the protomers is shown as a blue ribbon. Antigenic site II is magnified and colored as in (A) for the F-415 and F-416 chimeras. C ELISA binding results of mAbs specific for hRSV F (left panels) or hMPV F (right panels) with the proteins indicated on the left. mAbs specific for hRSV F bind epitopes of antigenic site II (Mota and 47F) or antigenic site IV (101F). mAs specific for hMPV F bind epitopes of antigenic site II (MF9, MF12, MF14, and MF15) or antigenic site IV (MF16).

In contrast, the antibodies induced by the F-415 chimera showed substantial binding not only to hMPV F but also to the hRSV postfusion F protein ( Fig 3A) . The level of antibody binding to postfusion hRSV F was even higher with sera from mice inoculated with F-416 and significantly higher (P < 0.001) than sera from mice inoculated with wild-type hMPV F. To assess whether the antibody binding to hRSV F observed with sera from mice inoculated with F-415 or F-416 was reflected in neutralizing activity against this virus, the mouse sera were tested in a microneutralization assay ( Fig 3B) . Again, the sera of mice inoculated with the wild-type hMPV F or hRSV F protein had substantial neutralization titers (IC 50 ) only against the homologous virus. In contrast, the sera of mice inoculated with either F-415 or F-416 had sizeable neutralization titers against hRSV, in addition to neutralizing hMPV. In summary, the antigenic characteristics of the F-415 and F-416 chimeras, reflected in their reactivity with hRSV F site II-specific mAbs (Fig 1C) , correlated with their capacity to induce murine antibodies that bound hRSV F and neutralized hRSV infectivity, which was particularly prominent in the case of F-416. We note, however, that in some sera no quantitative correlation was found between binding and neutralization titers; for example, serum from mouse #5 inoculated with F-415 had low levels of hRSV F-binding antibodies ( Fig 3A) but neutralized hRSV very efficiently ( Fig 3B) . To evaluate whether induction of hRSV-neutralizing antibodies by the chimeric proteins could be correlated with protection against a challenge with this virus, groups of eight mice were immunized three times, 4 weeks apart, with 20 lg of either F-415 or F-416 adjuvanted with CpG. One week after the last injection, mice were challenged intranasally with hRSV (A2 strain), and 5 days later, the amount of virus in lung extracts was quantified in a plaque assay. In parallel, three groups of five mice were inoculated with either CpG or wild-type postfusion hRSV F or hMPV F, as controls. The results again demonstrated a significant increase in hRSVneutralizing antibodies in the sera of mice inoculated with F-415 and F-416, just before the challenge, compared with CpG-only and postfusion hMPV F controls (Fig 4A) . Although there was some spread of the hRSV-neutralizing titers of individual mice, those inoculated with F-416 had on average higher neutralization titers than those inoculated with F-415. However, in both groups some individual mouse titers reached values close to those of mice inoculated with postfusion hRSV F. Reduction in hRSV replication in the lungs of inoculated mice clearly correlated with the noted induction of antibodies that neutralized hRSV infectivity ( Fig 4B) . Whereas hRSV reached high titers in the lungs of mice inoculated with either CpG or hMPV F, there was no detectable virus in the lungs of mice inoculated with postfusion hRSV F. Two of the mice inoculated with the F-415 chimera (#6 and #7) had no detectable virus in their lungs. These two mice also had the higher titers of hRSV-neutralizing antibodies in their sera (compare Fig 4A and B) . As a group, mice inoculated with F-415 protein had a substantial reduction in lung virus titers compared with CpG and hMPV F controls. Remarkably, the lungs of all mice inoculated with F-416 were free of detectable virus, demonstrating the efficacy of F-416 vaccination for protection against hRSV infection. To further substantiate the relevance of antibodies in protection of mice inoculated with F-415 or F-416 chimeras, sera from each group of mice of Fig 4B were pooled together and passively transferred i.p. to new mice that were challenged the following day with the same amount of virus as in Fig 4. Five days after challenge, the amount of virus in lung extracts was quantified in a plaque assay. The results of Fig EV3 demonstrate that virus replicated to high titers in mice that received sera from those previously inoculated with either CpG or hMPV F. In contrast, no virus was detected in the lungs of mice that received sera from mice previously inoculated with hRSV F. Most importantly, virus titers were significantly reduced in mice that received sera from those previously inoculated A B Figure 3 . Antibody responses of mice inoculated twice with either wild-type proteins or chimeric proteins with a postfusion hMPV F backbone. Groups of BALB/c female mice (n = 5) were inoculated twice (4 weeks apart) i.m. with 10 lg/dose of the proteins indicated at the top of each panel, folded in their respective postfusion conformations. One week after the last dose, mice were sacrificed and their blood collected. A Each mouse serum (identified by a number) was tested in ELISA for antibody binding to the postfusion F proteins indicated at the bottom. The results represented in the y-axis for each individual mouse serum correspond to the inverse dilution that gave 50% of maximal binding, expressed in log 10 units (EC 50 (log 10 )). *P = 0.00045. B Mouse sera were also tested in microneutralization assays with hRSV and hMPV, as indicated at the bottom. The results represented in the y-axis correspond to the inverse dilution that inhibited 50% of the viral infectivity (IC 50 (log 10 )). P-values: *P = 0.01001 and **P = 0.00271. with F-415 and particularly with F-416 in which about ten times less virus was found in their lungs than in those from the CpG-and hMPV-negative controls (Fig EV3) . It is worth noting though that protection afforded passively by sera from mice previously inoculated with F-416 did not reach the level of protection provided by sera from mice previously inoculated with hRSV F. Based on available structures of hRSV and hMPV F, a structure-based approach was used to design chimeric F proteins in which particular antigenic sites recognized by neutralizing antibodies were swapped between the F glycoproteins of the two viruses. When inoculated into mice, the chimeric proteins induced polyclonal antibody responses that cross-neutralized both hRSV and hMPV and even protected against challenge with the virus used for grafting of the heterologous antigenic site.
