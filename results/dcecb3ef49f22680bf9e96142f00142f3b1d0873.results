We begin by presenting vaccination game on a network with the total population N = 2000. Initially, 1 percentage of vaccination and 1 percentage of infected are randomly distributed among the whole population. Let ρ V , ρ R , ρ S be the final density of vaccination, recovered and free-rides in the end of each cycle. Note that the final density of recovered ρ R is equal to the density of those have been infected. To alleviate the effect randomly, the equilibriums are obtained by averaging over 100 independent runs. Generally speaking, the connection of face to face is more frequent than the phone connection or cooperation network. In Ref. [36] , the exponents are taken γ ∈ [2, 3], however, in this paper we used a deterministic power law distribution F (α) ∝ α −γ with γ = 1.63 and the lower cutoff ξ = 0.01. We start our discussion by briefly reporting the behavior of the epidemic model when no vaccination is implemented. Fig. 2 shows the epidemic diagram ρ R for the modified activity driven network when vaccination is not allowed. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , the final density of the recovered increases with the value of λ/µ. Moreover, a larger value of the closeness p could help suppress the epidemic spreading. That is because a larger closeness p means the individuals would like to connect with their old friends, which may effectively constrain the epidemic diffusion within localized groups of individuals. However, when the closeness p is relative small, the individuals could connect more other people in a cycle. The next, we are interested in studying on how the individuals' decisions affect the final contagion densities in the modified activity driven network. Fig. 3 illustrates the evolution of the final fraction of susceptible, recovered and vaccinated individuals with the cycle T . Obviously, one can see the vaccination density increases rapidly in the beginning, and then tends to be stable in the last. However, the recovered density greatly declines. If people would like to vaccinate, the final size of an epidemic would significantly reduce. However, vaccinated individuals are tempted not to take the vaccine due to the benefits. Once people get know that their immune neighbor have more payoff than them, they will take vaccination soon, and then it will form a large-scale emergence of immunity so that the immune density fast rise. On the other hand, as time goes, people make the decision whether or not to take vaccination mainly according to comparing the payoff with their friends. With the immune number increasing, people who do not taking vaccination are more likely to connect to the vaccinated, so they will not be infected and their payoff will maintain a high level. In the next cycle, they will make decision not to take vaccination. However, the free-rides will have a higher risk of infection when they contact the infected neighbors. In this case, the freerides will take vaccination again. Eventually the recovered density and free-rider density would stabilize. The evolutions of the average fraction of recovered and vaccinated on the first 100 cycles for different closeness p are shown in Fig. 4 (we do lots of simulations by choosing different parameters, the stable-state could be obtained in the first 100 cycles. Therefore, we just consider the first 100 cycles in the next). Interestingly, we find that a large closeness p is responsible for not only constraining the epidemic diffusion within localized groups but preventing people to vaccinate. Also we may get, no matter how the immune cost is, the average final density of vaccination reduces with the increase of the closeness p. At the same time, the average final vaccination density minimum coincides with peaks in the average final recovered density. Although the individuals may feel crisis according to the outside information (such as TV, broadcast, Internet, newspaper, and so on), however, such crisis awareness is far less than that when they get know their friends are infected. Therefore, if the individuals only connect with limited people, that would weaken their crisis awareness. As a result, people would not take immune even if the disease exists in the network. That would sharply increase the probability of individuals to be infected. However, if the effective number of ''acquaintance'' becomes smaller and the closeness p is bigger enough (in this paper the p is close to 0.7), the total recovered individuals will reduce with the increase of the closeness p. Above all, the results point out that the closeness p may have an active role in weakening both the spreading of epidemic and the vaccination. In order to investigate the vaccination game processes in more detail, Fig. 5 shows the mean final density of recovered and vaccinated individuals as a function of the p and λ/µ in the modified activity driven network. As shown in Fig. 5 (a1)-(a3), we may observe some counterintuitive phenomena: under some certain closeness p, the final density of recovered individual first increases and then decreases with the value of λ/µ. On the one hand, there are few higher activity individuals throughout the crowds which result in a few connections between individuals. On the other hand, the recovery rate is relatively larger when the value of λ/µ is smaller. Therefore, although some individuals are infected, the epidemic could not spread widely. However, once the value of λ/µ is larger enough, the probability that the susceptible to be infected increases. Due to the crisis awareness has been escalated, more individuals would like to take immune avoiding to be infected. Therefore, according to Fig. 5 (b1)-(b3), we could observe that the density of vaccination increases with the λ/µ. In order to investigate the relation between individuals' activities and their states, we set two variables named F R (α) and F V (α) that denote the frequency of the individual with activity α of becoming recovered or taking vaccination during some given cycles, respectively. The two variables also could be used to indicate the individuals' attitude towards the surroundings. We express them by using the following equations: where T denotes the total cycles of the epidemic process, C R (α) and C V (α) are the times of an individual with activity α of becoming recovered or taking vaccination during T cycles, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6(a) , as expected, the frequency of recovered becomes larger with the increase of the individuals' activity. For the case of p = 0, which means the activated individuals connect with others randomly, the gap of recovered frequency for the individuals with maximum and the minimum activity approaches to F R (α max ) − F R (α min ) ≃ 0.1. However, for the case of p = 1, which means the activated individuals only connect with the one who have been known, the gap of recovered frequency for the individuals with maximum and the minimum activity approaches to The results indicate the difference of recovered frequency becomes smaller with the decreases of the closeness p. According to Fig. 6(b) , the frequency of vaccination becomes larger when p is larger. However, the disparity of vaccination between the maximum and the minimum activity individuals is not obvious. As one can see from Fig. 7(a) , the recovered frequency for the same individual increases with the immune cost. Interestingly, under different immune cost c, the recovered frequency for the individuals with maximum and the minimum activity is almost the same F R (α max ) − F R (α min ) ≃ 0.3. Fig. 7(b) shows that the vaccinated frequency increases with the individuals' activity. Moreover, under different immune cost c, the vaccinated frequency for the individuals with maximum and the minimum activity is almost the same F V (α max ) − F V (α min ) ≃ 0.2. The results indicate the immune cost has less effect on the vaccination than the closeness p. As illustrated in Fig. 8(a) , the recovered frequency, counterintuitive, declines with the increase of the value of λ/µ. Meanwhile, as shown in Fig. 8(b) , more people would like to take immune while the value of λ/µ becomes larger. This remarkable result suggests that better hope sometimes means backfire. We can call this situation as Braess's Paradox, which have been detailedly described in Ref. [20] .
