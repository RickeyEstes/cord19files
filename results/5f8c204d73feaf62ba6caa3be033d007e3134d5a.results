Dietary sodium suppresses HFD-weight gain. Placing adult wildtype C57BL/6J mice on a high fat diet (HFD; Table 1 ) resulted in an immediate and sustained increase in weight gain compared to mice that remained on standard chow. Surprisingly, and contrary to our original hypothesis, dietary sodium caused a dose-dependent reduction in weight gain during HFD-feeding (Fig. 1A ). This increase in weight gain was primarily due to a robust, early increase in adiposity and slower subsequent (possibly reflexive) increases in lean and fluid masses ( Figure S1A ). Animals maintained on HFD with lower sodium content exhibited specific expansions of traditional white adipose tissues, including subcutaneous inguinal and perigenital fat pads, while other tissues remained largely unchanged by diet (interscapular "brown" adipose, heart, liver and kidney) ( Figure S1B ). Dietary sodium content did not alter total food intake, despite effects on preference. To assess whether differences in food ingestive behavior could explain the observed effects on weight gain, food intake was measured in mice fed chow, HFD + 0.25% NaCl, and HFD + 4% NaCl for five weeks. Caloric intake (mass of food ingested multiplied by the caloric density) was significantly increased with HFD, but sodium content had no effect upon caloric intake (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, the three diets had large, expected effects upon total daily sodium intake ( Figure S1C ). When the net body mass change over five weeks was plotted against total caloric intake and total sodium intake, no relationship between body mass change and caloric intake was observed (Fig. 1C) . In contrast, a significant inverse correlation was observed between body mass gains and sodium ingestion using an inverse 1 st order polynomial regression: with body mass in grams, and sodium intake in mEq/d; R 2 = 0.71; Y 0 = 3.687 ± 0.379, P < 0.0001; a = 0.739 ± 0.111, P < 0.0001 (Fig. 1D ). When animals were allowed to choose between pairs of HFD with low (0.25%), medium (1%), or high (4%) NaCl content, it became readily apparent that mice prefer diets with lower sodium content ( Figure S1D ). Dietary sodium content did not change metabolic rate or physical activity. Metabolic effects of dietary fat and sodium were assessed over the light:dark cycle using an OxyMax system (Columbus Instruments). Aerobic metabolic rate, determined by respirometry, was indistinguishable across groups with two weeks of dietary intervention ( Fig. 2A) . Importantly, RER was suppressed in both HFD groups, as would be expected with increased metabolic utilization of fatty acids. Spontaneous physical activity was indistinguishable across groups. A similar lack of effect of the dietary interventions was maintained through eight weeks of treatment (Fig. 2B) , save a slight increase in metabolic rate in the HFD + 0.25% NaCl group. This divergence is almost certainly due to the increased body mass of the animals after eight weeks on the diet. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was specifically examined using a high-resolution combined direct calorimeter/respirometer after 2.5 weeks of dietary intervention. Aerobic RMR, estimated by respirometry, appeared to increase with HFD feeding ( Figure S2A ). Total RMR as measured by direct calorimetry, however, was unchanged by any dietary interventions ( Figure S2B ). Dietary sodium suppresses circulating RAS activity. Blood pressure was assessed daily in one cohort of mice fed chow, HFD + 0.25% NaCl or HFD + 4% NaCl. No effects of the various diets were observed by tail-cuff plethysmography ( Figure S3A-B) . Nonetheless, dietary sodium caused the expected reduction in renal renin expression. Compared to HFD + 0.25% NaCl (n = 7; 1.000-fold by Livak 2 -ΔΔCT
