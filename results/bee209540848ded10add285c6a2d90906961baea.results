Immortalized marmoset fetal liver cells are capable of selfrenewal without chromosomal alteration and telomere shortening A mixed population of fetal liver cells was derived from full-gestation aborted marmoset fetal liver after digestion with collagenase 15 . Approximately 70% of attached cells consisted of elongated spindle cells with dark nuclei, whereas about 30% of attached cells consisted of Expression levels (fold) are depicted in colors in which red represents upregulation and green means downregulation. b Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of hepatic progenitor cell markers for MHPCs at passage 30. Cav-1 refers to Caveolin-1; M2PK means tumor type M2 pyruvate kinase; Ccl2 chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2; BMP4 bone morphogenetic protein 4; Cx-43 refers to Connexin 43. c Immunostaining of hepatic progenitor cell markers for MHPCs at passage 30. Nuclei was counterstained by DAPI (scale bar = 100 µm). d Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of DNA replication and cell cycle-related genes for MHPCs at passage 30. DNA replication and cell cycle-related genes were significantly upregulated in MHPCs (passage 30) compared with adult marmoset liver tissues (n = 3, two-tailed t-test, *P < 0.1 × 10 −4 ). e GSEA of cellular metabolism-related genes for MHPCs at passage 30. Cellular metabolism-related genes were significantly downregulated in MHPCs (passage 30) compared with adult marmoset liver tissues (n = 3, two-tailed t-test, *P < 0.1 × 10 -4 ) polygonal cells with epithelial-like morphology (Fig. 1a) , which is a typical feature of hepatic progenitor cells. These cells were infected with lentivirus expressing SV40 large T antigen and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) daily for three times after one passage (Supplementary Figure S1a ). Strong fluorescence signals were detected in mixed liver cells 1 week after three successive infections and EGFP-positive cell clones were sorted with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and seeded in six-well plates with further dilution. Notably, EGFP signals became weaker with passaging ( Supplementary Figure S1a), consistent with previous reports 16 Figure S1c) , and hepatic stem cell markers (sex-determining region Y box 9 gene-Sox9) 17 and fetal hepatic progenitor markers (cytokeratin 7-CK7; Supplementary Figure S1d), indicating these clones are likely MHPCs. In contrast, clone 1 expressed all the markers, including hepatic stem cell marker (epithelial cell adhesion molecule-EpCAM) and fetal hepatic progenitor marker (α-fetoprotein-AFP; Supplementary Figure S1d), and was more epithelial-like compared to other clones and capable of indefinite proliferation with a mean population doubling time of 2.3 days (Fig. 1a, b) . Little difference was detected in doubling time at passage 30 and passage 80 (Fig. 1b) , suggesting that clone 1 retained the self-renewal capacity after multiple cell divisions in vitro. Karyotype analysis verified the normal 46 and XY karyotype of clone 1 after 30 population doublings as demonstrated by conventional Giesma banding (Fig. 1c) . Examination on the number of chromosomes from 30 individual clones of clone 1 (passage 30) showed that approximately 82% of clones maintained 46 chromosomes (Fig. 1d ) without telomere shortening (Fig. 1e) , indicating that clone 1 can self-renew without chromosomal alteration and telomere shortening.
