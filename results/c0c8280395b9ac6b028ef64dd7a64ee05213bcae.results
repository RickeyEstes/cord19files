Our search identified 203 reports, including 10 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis (28 -37) . Two (28, 31) of these studies had to be excluded because insufficient data were presented in the original articles, and attempts to retrieve the necessary data from the authors were unsuccessful. The remaining eight trials, all of which used one of three antibiotics (erythromycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole), were included in the meta-analysis. Reasons for exclusion are listed in Table 1 . The characteristics of the 10 randomized controlled trials, including the two that were excluded because of insufficient data, are shown in Table 2 . The overall summary effect size was 0.21 (95% CI, 0.05 to 0.36) indicating a small (about one-fifth of a standard deviation), statistically significant benefit from the use of antibiotics (Figure) , equivalent to approximately one half day less of cough and sputum production. Three outcomes were reported by at least four studies (Table 3) . Although each of these results favor antibiotics, none was statistically significant. For days of purulent days lost from work. The effect of antibiotic treatment on days lost from work was very small, and unlike days of cough and sputum production, did not approach statistical significance. A test for heterogeneity was not significant for the overall summary effect size (P ϭ 0.37) or for days of sputum production (P ϭ 0.50), suggesting that these results are homogenous and can be combined. A test for heterogeneity was significant for the summary mean difference for days lost from work (P ϭ 0.03) and days of cough * Result is the mean in the antibiotic group minus the mean in the placebo group for the main outcome measure. A positive result indicates a benefit from antibiotics. A negative result indicates a benefit from placebo. † Effect size is the difference between the mean outcome in the antibiotic and placebo groups divided by the pooled standard deviation. ‡ These studies did not provide data that allowed calculation of a confidence interval or a continuous outcome measure, and therefore could not be included in the overall summary effect size. § Cough amount score was a patient-reported score on a severity scale of 1 to 3. ¶ Sputum production score was a patient-reported score on a severity scale of 1 to 4. # Sputum production score was a patient-reported score on a severity scale of 1 to 5. CI ϭ confidence interval.
