With a median follow-up of 23 months, 166 VRIs were diagnosed in 131 of 378 patients in a median of 4 months after HSCT; among these patients, 119 were diagnosed in outpatients. The 166 VRIs were distributed as follow: 16 AdV, 84 HCoV/HRV, and 66 flu-like, including 14 influenza virus, 23 PIV, 17 RSV, and 12 human MPV. Characteristics of patients and VRIs are shown in Table 1 . Clinical presentations of VRIs did not differ between the different virus types. Copathogens were present in 45% of cases. Three-year cumulative incidence of VRIs was estimated at 40% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34% to 45) ( Figure 1 ). The hazard of infection by AdV was markedly lower than for the 2 other virus groups (both P < .0001), whereas infection by HCoV or HRV was more frequent than infection by flu-like viruses (P ¼ .053). The only risk factor identified in univariable analysis for a first VRI or HCoV/HRV infection was a history of acute graftversus-host disease (GVHD) (hazard ratio [HR], 1.54; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.27; P ¼ .027) or chronic GVHD (HR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.91; P ¼ .018). In contrast, high-risk disease (NE, P ¼ .0002), cord blood as the stem cell source (HR, 5.50; 95% CI, 1.37 to 22.1; P), and donorerecipient HLA mismatch (HR, 3.60; 95% CI, 1.30 to 10; P ¼ .014) were risk factors for AdV; malignancies, cord blood as the stem cell source (HR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.07 to 5.97; P ¼ .034), and GVHD (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.93; P ¼ .045) were risk factors for flu-like viruses. Of 131 patients infected with VRIs, 16 died within 3 months. Among these deaths, 8 patients died of viral pneumonia in concomitance with another cause of death: bacterial and/or fungal pneumonia (RSV n ¼ 1, AdV n ¼ 1), uncontrolled GVHD (AdV þ HRV n ¼ 1, RSV n ¼ 1, HCoV n ¼ 1), graft rejection and bacterial/fungal pneumonia (RSV n ¼ 1, AdV n ¼ 1), or post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (HCov n ¼ 1). Univariable analysis of risk factors for death at 3 months, identified active GVHD (odds ratio [OR], 2.99; 95% CI, 1 to 8.88; P ¼ .049), ongoing steroid therapy at a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight or higher (OR, 7.59; 95% CI, 2.61 to 22.1; P ¼ .0002), a lymphocyte count lower than .5 g/L (OR, 5.34; 95% CI, 1.54 to 18.5; P ¼ .008), pneumonia at the time of diagnosis (OR, 8.65; 95% CI, 1.07 to 70; P ¼ .043), and the presence of a copathogen (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 1.28 to 14.2; P ¼ .018). Interestingly, the virus group and the time from HSCT had no impact on mortality. Multivariate analyses showed that 2 factors remained associated with increased overall mortality: steroid dose over 1 mg/kg body weight (OR, 8.29; 95% CI, 2.56 to 26.8; P ¼ .0004) and a lymphocyte count lower than .5 g/L (OR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.25 to 17.9; P ¼ .022) (Figure 1 ).
