In vitro and in vivo properties of ZIKV-Paraiba and rZIKV-RGN. Recently, we have generated an infectious cDNA clone of ZIKV-RGN (pBAC-ZIKV-RGN) using a BAC approach 49 , from which infectious recombinant (r)ZIKV-RGN was successfully recovered after transfection of Vero cells 49 . The genome sequence of ZIKV-RGN was obtained from an infected fetus with microcephaly during the recent outbreak in Brazil in 2015 14 . Interestingly, when we compared the rZIKV-RGN with the contemporary ZIKV-Paraiba strain, isolated from a febrile female in the state of Paraiba (Brazil) in 2015, we observed significant differences in vitro and in vivo ( Fig. 1 ) between both strains. Analysis of the growth kinetics reveled that both viruses replicated efficiently in Vero cells (Fig. 1A) reaching titers of approximately 10 7 focus-forming units per ml (FFU/ml) at 48 hours post-infection (hpi). However, at early times post-infection (12 and 24 hpi) rZIKV-RGN had a significant delay in the replication kinetics compared to ZIKV-Paraiba. In addition, analysis of the plaque phenotype by immunostaining showed that at 3 days after infection, rZIKV-RGN produced smaller plaques than those of ZIKV-Paraiba (Fig. 1B) . To assess the pathogenicity in vivo of rZIKV-RGN and ZIKV-Paraiba, groups of six-to-seven-week-old female IFNAR−/− A129 mice (n = 4) were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) in the footpad with different doses (10 1 -10 5 FFU/mouse) of ZIKV-Paraiba or rZIKV-RGN and monitored daily for signs of morbidity (body weight loss and clinical disease signs) and survival for 14 days (Fig. 1C) . Notably, all mice infected with ZIKV-Paraiba suffered a rapid dose-dependent weight loss between days 5 to 10 (Fig. 1C, upper panel) , showing clear neurological disease signs, including tremors, disorientation, hind limb weakness and severe paralysis (Fig. 1C , middle panel), and animals died or were euthanized between days 7-10 post-infection (Fig. 1C, lower panel) . Surprisingly, only 10 FFU of ZIKV-Paraiba was sufficient to result in 100% of mortality (mouse lethal dose 50, MLD 50 < 10 FFU). In contrast, and as we previously described 49 , only 75% of the mice infected with a high dose of 10 5 FFU of rZIKV-RGN lost weight and succumbed to viral infection, resulting in a calculated MLD 50 of ~7.5 × 10 4 FFU (Fig. 1C, right panels) . Remarkably, mice that succumbed to rZIKV-RGN infection presented similar disease symptoms than those observed with ZIKV-Paraiba. In the case of mice infected with 10 4 FFU of rZIKV-RGN, some animals presented signs of illness (hunched posture and reduced movement) and lost some weight between days 7 and 9, but all of them recovered the initial body weight and survived viral infection (Fig. 1C , right panels). Mice infected with 10 1 -10 3 FFU of rZIKV-RGN did not present clinical symptoms and all of them survived viral infection. In agreement with these observations, mice infected with ZIKV-Paraiba had significant higher viremia than mice infected with rZIKV-RGN on days 2 and 4 after infection (Fig. 1D) , correlating the differences observed in morbidity and mortality (Fig. 1C) with the ability of these viruses to replicate in vivo (Fig. 1D) . Vero cells (12-well plates, 0.5 × 10 6 cells/well, triplicates) were infected with the ZIKV-Paraiba natural isolate (white columns) or with rZIKV-RGN (black columns) at MOI of 0.1 FFU/cell and viral titers in tissue cultured supernatants were determined at the indicated hpi by immunofocus assay (FFU/ml) using the E protein mAb 4G2. The black dotted line indicates the limit of detection (200 FFU/ml). Data represent the means +/− SD of the results determined in triplicate wells. *P < 0.05 using a Student's t test. Ns, not significant (P > 0.05). (B) Plaque phenotype: Vero cells (6-well plates, 1 × 10 6 cells/well) were infected with ~25-50 FFU of ZIKV-Paraiba (upper) or rZIKV-RGN (bottom) and overlaid with media containing agar. At 3 days post-infection, viral plaques were immunostained using the E protein mAb 4G2. (C) Morbidity and mortality: Six-to-seven-weekold female IFNAR−/− A129 mice (n = 4) were infected s.c. in the footpad with the indicated FFU of ZIKV-Paraiba (left panels) or rZIKV-RGN (right panels). Body weight (upper panels), clinical score (middle panels) and survival rates (lowers panels) were evaluated daily for 14 days. Error bars represent SD of the mean for each group of mice. Clinical signs were scored as described in the material and methods. (D) Viral titers: Six-toseven-week-old female IFNAR−/− A129 mice (n = 6) were infected with the indicated FFU of ZIKV-Paraiba (left panel) or rZIKV-RGN (right panel) as described above. Mice were sacrificed at days 2 and 4 after infection (n = 3/time point) and viral titers in sera were determined by immunofocus assay (FFU/ml). Symbols represent data from individual mice and bars the geometric means of viral titers. # Virus not detected in one mouse; & virus not detected in two mice; ND, virus not detected. Dotted black lines indicate the limit of detection (200 FFU/ ml). Differences in titers between ZIKV-Paraiba (left panel) and rZIKV-RGN (right panel) were analyzed by Student's t test. **P < 0.01. factors responsible for these dramatic differences in virulence between rZIKV-RGN and ZIKV-Paraiba, we first sequenced our laboratory stock of ZIKV-Paraiba (University of Rochester, UR) by deep-sequencing (Table S1) . Although, the complete sequence of ZIKV-Paraiba was previously deposited in GenBank (KX280026), we did not know the passage history of our ZIKV-Paraiba. Several nucleotides differences between our laboratory and the reference ZIKV-Paraiba sequence were identified (Table S1 ). Interestingly, some of these differences corresponded with genetic variants or quasispecies, suggesting that ZIKV-Paraiba is a population of different genomes as previously described in the literature 56 . Based on these sequencing results, a consensus sequence for our ZIKV-Paraiba was determined, considering only the most frequent nucleotide variants (>50% of frequency) (Table S1 , grey). Based on the consensus sequence, six non-synonymous nucleotides substitutions between our ZIKV-Paraiba and the reference KX280026 sequence were identified, resulting in 3 amino acid changes in the prM protein (E21G, T74A and S109P), one in the NS2A protein (A117V) and two in the NS3 protein (M334T and K587R) (Table S1, grey). The genetic identity of our rZIKV-RGN was previously determined, showing 100% identity with the published ZIKV-RGN sequence (GenBank accession number KU527068) 49 . Comparative sequence analysis between rZIKV-RGN and our ZIKV-Paraiba (UR) showed 35 nucleotides differences between both viruses, resulting in 9 amino acid substitutions localized in the prM (E21G, T74A and S109P), NS1 (E146K and A233T), NS2A (A117V), NS3 (M334T and K587R) and NS4B (I240T) proteins (Table 1 ). One nucleotide substitution was present in the 3′ UTR (T10561C). Based on these data, we hypothesized that the 9 amino acid differences identified in the viral polyprotein or the nucleotide change in the 3′ UTR, or a combination of them, could be responsible of the differences in virulence and viral replication observed in vivo between RGN and Paraiba strains.
