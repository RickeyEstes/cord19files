Among the 50 calves included in the study, 18 (36 %) had diarrhea in the first 30 days of life. Of these, 13 (72 % of diarrheic calves) were positive for C. parvum without mixed infection with E coli., Coronavirus and Rotavirus. In all dams, the anti-C. parvum IgG antibody concentration in colostrum varied between 570 and 4050 mg/dl; in dams who gave birth to calves with diarrhea and were C. parvum-positive, the antibody concentration in colostrum varied between 680 and 3680 mg/dl (Table 1) . No statistically significant difference in the level of anti-C. parvum IgG antibody concentration in colostrum was observed between farms (p = 0.3165) (Fig. 1A) . The levels of anti-C. parvum IgG antibody concentration in colostrum received by calves with clinical signs of cryptosporidiosis (diarrhea) was significantly lower than in the colostrum received by calves that remained healthy (p = 0.02) (Fig. 1B) . The point-biserial correlation showed a negative correlation between the levels of anti-C. parvum antibodies and the manifestation of clinical cryptosporidiosis (r=-0.425), which was statistically significant (p = 0.002, 2-tailed) (Fig. 2) .
