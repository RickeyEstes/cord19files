Building a virus-specific T cell receptor library. We used a panel of previously identified viral epitopes from HBV, EBV, CMV, FLU and SARS to expand T cells from healthy donors or patients with resolved HBV and SARS infections (Table 1) . Antigen-specific T cells were identified using matching HLA-pentamers/tetramers or the CD107a degranulation assay and clonal populations were derived by limiting dilution cloning or sorting T cells using antibodies specific for the variable region of TCR beta chains. Total RNA was extracted from sorted clones and the wild type TCR alpha and beta genes were cloned using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR with TCR constant region gene specific primers. The TCRs were cloned into the MP-71 retroviral vector 18 and tested for expression in primary human T cells. Optimizing virus-specific TCR expression in primary human T cells. The wild type alpha and beta TCR pair was originally tested for expression by co-transducing two separate vectors carrying the TCR alpha and beta genes ( Fig. 1A; a 1 b) . To begin optimizing TCR expression, we made stepwise advancements in the TCR constructs based on published literature using 3 different virus-specific TCRs. The TCRs were linked together with a 2A autocleavage site and flexible spacer 13, 14 to promote equimolar production of the alpha and beta chains and codon optimized to increase translational efficiency 17 . These constructs were then modified with a nonnative cysteine disulfide bond in the constant region to increase pairing and stability of the exogenous TCR 15, 16 . As previously demonstrated, codon optimization and incorporating the alpha and beta genes into a single cassette increased TCR expression in all three TCRs compared to wild type TCRs on separate vectors (Fig. 1A) . We did not see substantial differences in the frequency of HLA-multimer positive cells between single cassette constructs with and without the additional disulfide bond ( Fig. 1A ; a-b-Opt vs a-bcys-Opt). However, there was a clear advantage with the inclusion of an additional disulfide bond. The HLA-multimer positive CD8 T cell population showed much more defined staining and a higher mean fluorescence intensity in 2 out of 3 TCRs (Fig. 1B) . We also observed that the additional disulfide bond increased fluorescence intensity in the non-CD8 T cell population. Therefore, all subsequent TCR expression cassettes employed the 2A cleavage site with codon optimization and the additional disulfide bond to maximize pairing. Orientation of the TCR gene cassette significantly impacts expression. There is evidence that the orientation of the TCR alpha and beta genes within the cassette can impact their expression 19 . Therefore, we synthesized codon optimized constructs linked with the P2A cleavage site in both orientations and tested TCR expression in primary human T cells ( Fig. 2A) . Where available, we monitored TCR expression with beta chain specific antibodies and HLApentamers/tetramers. Interestingly, in 9/10 of the TCRs tested, expression of the introduced TCR was better (higher frequency of TCR1 cells) when the TCR beta gene was upstream of the TCR alpha gene in the expression cassette. This was true for staining the beta chain ( Fig. 2B&C ) or with HLA-pentamers/tetramers (Fig. 2E&F ). This demonstrates that there is a positive (high frequency) and a negative (low frequency) orientation for each TCR alpha and beta gene pair. When we classified expression based on this positive/ negative orientation we observed a statistically significant increase in the frequency of TCR1 T cells, with a mean of 35.3 vs 22.45 for beta chain expression (Fig. 2D ) and 19.49 vs 8.74 for HLA multimer staining respectively (Fig. 2G ). The fold increase in expression differed for each TCR but overall we observed a mean fold increase of 1.9 in beta chain expression and 4.2 for multimer staining (Table 1) in the optimal orientation. TCR cassette orientation and T cell function. Next, we determined if the increased TCR expression correlated with an increase in the frequency of functional cells. Primary human T cells transduced with both orientations of the TCR cassette were stimulated with specific peptides presented on either HLA-A21 T2 cells or HLA-matched EBV transformed B cell lines. IFN-c production, analyzed by flow cytometry, was used to monitor the frequency of virus-specific CD8 T cells (Fig. 3A) . T cell cytokine production mirrored TCR expression and there was clearly a positive and negative orientation for each TCR construct. Nine out of 10 TCRs resulted in higher frequencies of IFN-c1 T cells in the beta-P2A-alpha orientation whereas only one TCR was superior in the alpha-P2Abeta orientation (Fig. 3B ). When TCRs were grouped according to their positive and negative orientation, we observed a significant difference in their overall functionality, 26.86% vs 12.89% IFN-c1 CD8 T cells (Fig. 3C) . This translated to a 2.7 fold increase overall in the frequency of IFN-c producing T cells with the optimal orientation of the TCR cassette (Table 1) . In a subset of TCR transduced T cells we also analyzed the production of TNF-a and IL-2. Similar to the results with IFN-c, we found that the optimal orientation of the TCR expression cassettes resulted in an increase in the frequency of TNF-a and IL-2 producing cells within the population of transduced T cells (Fig. 3 D&E) . These data confirm that, in addition to codon optimization and adding the TCR alpha and beta chains to a single cassette, the simple modification of inverting the TCR alpha and beta chain orientation can have a significant impact on TCR expression and T cell function in engineered T cells. Enhancing the functionality of engineered T cells using synthetic TLR agonists. Once the optimal orientation of the TCR was identified, we focused on augmenting the function of engineered T cells. Adjuvants based on Toll-like receptor ligands can have direct effects on T cells 20 and be selected to mimic infecting pathogens 21 . We used TLR ligands that frequently signal viral infection: polyI:C (TLR-3), Imiquimod (TLR-7), ssRNA40 (TLR-8) and CpG (TLR-9). The TLR ligands were added to the PBMC during the first 48 h of activation prior to transduction. At the time of transduction, the media was changed, the primary T cells were transduced and allowed to expand for 10 days. Following their expansion, we tested TCR expression using HLA-pentamers to determine if the TLR ligands affected TCR expression compared to the standard protocol with IL-2 alone. The TCR presented in Figure 4 (HBV core 18-27) has high affinity for its cognate peptide-MHC, allowing us to monitor TCR expression in both the CD8 and CD4 T cell population using the HLA-pentamer (Fig. 1A) . We found that the addition of TLR ligands to the culture during the first 48 h of activation had little impact on HLA pentamer staining in either the CD8 or CD4 T cell population ( Fig. 4 A,B ,E). However, we observed clear differences in the frequency of functional cells. The addition of polyI:C or ssRNA40 increased the frequency of IFN-c producing CD8 and CD4 T cells compared to IL-2 alone, IL-2 plus CpG or Imiquimod (Fig. 4 C,F ). This increase in the frequency of IFN-c producing cells translated into a 60% and 80% increase in functional CD8 T cells following addition of polyI:C and ssRNA40 respectively to the culture medium (Fig. 4D ). Similar results were observed with CD4 T cells, with ssRNA40 stimulating the greatest increase in IFN-c1 T cell frequency (Fig. 4G) . Addition of TLR agonists promotes Th1 polarization. To investigate the discrepancy between HLA-pentamer positive cells and IFN-c positive cells in cultures with polyI:C or ssRNA40 (Fig. 4B -D) we analyzed the supernatant taken from cultures after the 48 h incubation with anti-CD3, IL-2 and TLR ligands. We tested for the production of 42 different cytokines in cultures derived from 3 separate healthy donors and measured significant production of 27 different cytokines. We found that addition of TLR ligands generally reduced the production of immunoregulatory/Th2 cytokines compared to IL-2 alone (Fig. 5A) . This was especially true for ssRNA40 in all cases except the increased production in IL-10; observed with both polyI:C and ssRNA40. In coordination with the reduced production of regulatory cytokines we observed increased production of inflammatory cytokines. In particular, the Th1 polarizing cytokine IL-12p70 was significantly increased with ssRNA40 and mildly increased with polyI:C (Fig. 5B) . We then tested whether the inflammatory environment led to increased Th1 polarization or caused non-specific bystander activation to account for the increase in IFN-c1 T cells. Unlike figure 4 , where HLA-pentamer and IFN-c staining were performed in separate assays, we measured IFN-c production in HLA pentamer1 or TCR Vbeta1 cells to measure cytokine production in TCR transduced cells. As above, HLA pentamer staining was similar between the different conditions (Fig. 6A ). The addition of polyI:C and ssRNA40 increased the frequency of IFN-c1 T cells compared to IL-2 alone (Fig. 6B) . We observed an increase in IFN-c1/pentamer1 T cells with polyI:C and ssRNA40 compared to IL-2 alone (Fig. 6C) , indicating increased polarization of pentamer positive cells to a Th1 phenotype. However, only approximately 70% of the IFN-c1 cells were pentamer positive, regardless of the condition (Fig. 6B&C ). This leaves a significant number of IFN-c1 T cells that either express too little TCR to stain with pentamer or are responding as non-specific bystanders in the co-culture. Next, we analyzed IFN-c production in Vbeta1 T cells. The advantage of Vbeta staining is that nearly all T cells expressing our introduced TCR, whether is it properly paired with the correct alpha chain or not, will be stained by the antibody. Therefore, Vbeta staining may detect T cells producing IFN-c that do not express enough of the introduced TCR for HLA-pentamer staining. Similar to pentamer staining, TCR beta chain expression was similar across all conditions (Fig. 6D ) and the frequency of IFN-c1 T cells increased with the addition of polyI:C and ssRNA40 (Fig. 6E) . Unlike T cells stained with pentamers, we found that nearly all (<90%) of the IFN-c1 cells following peptide-specific activation were TCR V beta positive (Fig. 6E&F) . These data indicate that IFN-c production was specific to the introduced TCR. They also confirm increased Th1 polarization as cells shift from Vbeta1/IFN-c-to Vbeta1/IFN-c1 with the addition of TLR ligands to the culture. Therefore, similar to their role in natural infection, combining T cell activation in the presence of TLR ligation led to an inflammatory environment during the activation phase for transduction and translated into a greater frequency of IFN-c producing T cells. As a final characterization of their function, and to determine whether culturing in different conditions altered transduced T cell cytotoxic function, we compared the ability of T cells transduced with the HBV core antigen-specific TCR to lyse hepatocyte-like cell lines (HepG2) expressing HBV antigens. We found that T cells cultured under any of the conditions exhibited efficient and similar lysis of targets expressing the HBV core antigen (HG2cAg). We observed 95% specific lysis at a 155 E5T ratio and 80% specific lysis at a 1510 E5T ratio (Fig. 6G) . Co-culture with HepG2 cells expressing the irrelevant HBV surface antigen (HG2sAg) did not result in any significant lysis. We were unable to titrate the cytotoxicity experiment for sensitivity as the antigen in HepG2 cells is produced from a CMV promoter following transduction with a lentiviral vector. However, this data demonstrated that transduced T cells cultured under any condition tested are specific and highly cytotoxic.
