As of 1st of January 2019 until 31st of March 2019, a total of 107 cases of MERS-CoV, including 18 deaths (overall CFR, 16.8%; male-specific CFR was 17.5% [14/80] and female-specific CFR was %14.8 [4/27] ), were reported to WHO from the National IHR Focal Points of Saudi Arabia and Oman. The mean age of all patients was 50±17 years (range 16-94) and 80 patients (74.8%) were male. The average time from symptoms onset to the first hospitalization was3±3.3 days [range 0 until 13]. The average time from to the first hospitalization to laboratory confirmation was 3.6±6.5 days [range 1 until 29], the average time from onset of symptom to death was 17.5±11.7 days [range 1 until 41], and the mean of hospitalization for patient with MERS-CoV was 3.5±3.9 days [range 1 until 23]. A total of 64 patients (59.8%) had comorbidities. Sixteen (15%) MERS cases were health care workers. The characteristics of the population can be found in Table 1 . Table 2 illustrates the mean difference of some quantitative variables by gender for 107 patients with the Middle East respiratory syndrome in the course of the present study. Among all the quantitative variables examined, only a statistically significant difference was observed from the onset of the symptom to the death between males and females (p=0.037). There was no significant difference in terms of other quantitative variables between males and females (p>0.05 for all). Epidemic curve of MERS-CoV human cases from the 1st of January 2019 until 31st of the March 2019 (per WHO data) and also the distributional status of these cases by involved county and city are shown in Figures 1 and 2 .
