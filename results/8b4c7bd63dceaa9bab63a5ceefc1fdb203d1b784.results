Organic extracts of Spongosorites sp. sponges collected in the Caribbean showed significant inhibition of cultured P388 cell proliferation and herpes simplex virus, type 1 (HSV-1) cytopathic effect. This activity was found by TLC HSV-1 and P388 [22] bioautography methods to be associated with a bright yellow compound present in the crude extract. Purification lead to the isolation of a bis-(indolyl)imidazole, designated topsentin (Fig. 1 ). Topsentin and certain synthetic analogs inhibit the growth of P388 cells, HSV-1, vesicular stomatitis virus and corona virus A-59 [23] . Topsentin has also been isolated from a Mediterranean sponge, Topsentia genitrix, and reported to be weakly toxic to fish [23] . Antitumor activity. Topsentin inhibited the proliferation of cultured murine and human tumor cells and showed modest activity in murine P388 and B16 in uivo tumor models. Of the cell lines tested, murine P388 leukemia cells were most sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of topsentin, while the potency for inhibition of replication of cells derived from human lung and colon tumors or a leukemia was approximately an order of magnitude greater (Table 1) . Over a range of concentrations from nontoxic to lethal, HL-60 cells exposed to topsentin did not differentiate as determined by nitroblue tetrazolium reduction (data not shown). Against ascitic P388 tumors, topsentin showed modest activity on a QDl-5 schedule with a best response (150mg/kg) of 137% (Table 2) . Topsentin also showed similar activity with the i.p. B16 model (%T/C = 144, 37.5 mg/kg) with daily administration (QDl-9). Macromolecular biosynthesis. An initial characterization of the toxic effects of topsentin was made by assessing incorporation of radiolabeled precursors of DNA, RNA, and protein into acid-precipitable material of P388 cells. After 1-hr exposures to 30 PM topsentin, incorporation of [3H]thymidine and * Cells were incubated for 48 hr (P388), 72 hr (HL-60, HL-6O/AR), or 96 hr (HT-29, A.549) at 37" in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% COr in air. Cells were enumerated with M'IT as described in Materials and Methods, and data are expressed as the micromolar concentration of topsentin that resulted in an absorbance equal to 50% of that obtained from an equivalent untreated culture. Results are the means (*SD) of 3-8 separate experiments. * Intraperitoneal P388 or B16 tumors were established 1 day prior to treatment with topsentin on a daily schedule (QDl-5 or QDl-9) as described in Materials and Methods. Data are expressed as the median time to death of six (P388) or ten (B16) treated animals normalized to the time of death of untreated tumor-bearing animals (%T)C). ND represents not determined. [3H]uridine were inhibited 91 and 60%, respectively, while incorporation of [3H]leucine was unaffected (Fig. 2) . At a lower concentration of topsentin (3 vM), effects were less, but a similar pattern was observed ( Table 3) . Inhibition of nucleic acid polymerization with less effects on protein synthesis was also observed following exposure of P388 cells to DNA binding agents such as daunomycin or actinomycin D, whereas agents that do not interact with DNA such as Ara-c or emetine show markedly different patterns (Table 3) . DNA binding studies. Since incorporation experiments suggested that topsentin interacted with DNA, fluorescence spectral changes and competitive binding experiments with known DNA active compounds were undertaken. Changes in the fluorescence spectra of topsentin indicate that this agent interacts with DNA. The excitation and emission maxima of topsentin were 273 and 348 nm, respectively, while in the presence of 1 mg/mL DNA a shift in the emission maximum to 512 was observed. In the presence of DNA, changes in the excitation spectrum of topsentin were also observed, as the excitation maximum shifted to 401 nm and a local * Cells were incubated for 1 hr at 37" with concentrations of the agents indicated and then exposed to tritiated thymidine, uridine, or leucine for 5-30 min as described in Fig. 2 . Data are expressed as the percent inhibition of the rate of incorporation of precursor in treated cultures normalized to that incorporated in untreated cultures. maximum was observed at 301 nm. As shown in Fig.  3 , the addition of DNA to topsentin also resulted in an increase in the intensity of emitted light, with maximal changes observed at a molar base pair to topsentin ratio of 95 to 1. Competitive binding experiments with ethidium bromide confirmed that topsentin interacted with DNA (Fig. 4) DNA was added to a cuvette containing 10yM topsentin (initial volume), and appropriate volumes of a 2mg/mL stock solution of DNA were added to result in the total amounts of DNA as indicated. Excitation wavelength was 301 nm and emission was measured at 512 (slit widths were 10 nm). topsentin, as described in I$ j. Excitatibn'wavelen'gth was 530 nm and emission was measured at 590 nm (slit widths were 10nm); fluorescence was not corrected for dilution. Virtually identical results were obtained when excitation and emission were monitored at 295 and 590 nm, respectively.
