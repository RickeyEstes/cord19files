The search identified a total of 1706 papers after accounting for overlaps between the different databases. These were reviewed on the basis of ÔtitleÕ for relevance to the review (Fig. 1) , and on this basis 1593 papers were excluded. Abstracts for the remaining 113 papers were reviewed and a further 54 were eliminated. Full copies of the remaining 59 papers plus 6 papers identified from scanning the reference lists of review papers, and 3 papers retrieved from the authorsÕ hardcopy files, were reviewed and summarized. Table 3 provides a classification of the 68 papers that were read in full text. After full text review, 24 papers were classified as meeting the inclusion criteria. These included a quasi-experimental study (a non-randomized trial) [18] , nine observational studies [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , seven outbreak reports [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] , three historical outbreak archive analyses [35] [36] [37] , and four event surveillance reports [38] [39] [40] [41] . Details for each of these studies are summarized in Table 4 . The 44 papers that were read but not included in the review are listed in Table 5 .
