Common Sequences within Biffe Retroviral Overlap Regions Site-specific frameshifting within the various retroviral overlap regions was first suggested by the observation that each of these regions contains one of three common Common heptanucleotide sequence motifs are present in all retroviral overlaps known or presumed to contain sites of frameshifting. The heptanucleotides are shown in boldface type along with their neighboring sequences and the distance (in nucleotides) between the 3' nucleotide of the heptameric sequence and the 3' end of its overlap (as delineated by the first nucleotide of the O-frame termination codon). Sequences are grouped according to their final three nucleotides; these constitute a codon in the upstream (e.g., gag) gene. Two of these codons, UUA and AAC, have previously been identified as the sites of frameshifting (see text). Evidence that the entire heptanucleotide sequence may participate in the frameshifting reaction is presented in this report.

(The overlap regions are delineated on the 3' side by the termination codon of the upstream [e.g., gag] open reading frame and on the 5'side by the termination codon that demarcates the beginning of the downstream open reading frame [e.g., poll). As shown in Table 1 , several overlaps, including the gag/pa/ overlaps of RSV and HIV-l, contain the sequence U UUA (where the UUA is a leucine codon in the 0 frame). One of two other sequences, U UUU or AAAC, appears in each of the remaining overlaps (Table 1) . We have previously proposed that -1 frameshifting might occur at these sequences if the tRNAs reading the O-frame codons occasionally slipped back and paired with the codons in the -1 frame . In fact, amino acid sequencing has shown that two of these sequences, U UUA and A AAC, are the sites of frameshifting during HIV-l gag-pal and MMTV gag-pro expression (Hizi et al., 1987) , respectively, and the amino acid sequences are consistent with the proposed mechanism. The sequence similarity among the different retroviral overlaps actually extends 5' to the putative frameshift sites. Table 1 shows that in all but one of the overlaps, the three common sequences are preceded by runs of three U, A, or G residues, creating similar sequence motifs that are seven nucleotides in length. (The U UUA sequence in the MMTVpro-poloverlap, the sole exception, is preceded by the sequence GGA.) Similar heptameric sequences are found in the gag/pal overlaps of two retrotransposons of Drosophila, 776 and gypsy, and the mouse intracisternal A particle (Table 1) .
