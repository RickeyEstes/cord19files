In total, 168 papers were included in our review. The majority of these studies originated in the USA (n = 63), the UK (n = 39) and Canada (n = 19), perhaps reflecting the considerable interest and expertise in mixed methods research within these countries. The focus of the studies included in the review varied significantly and the populations studied included both patients and healthcare professionals. Table 2 illustrates the types of analytic approaches adopted in each of the studies included in the review. The most widely used analytic approach (n = 98) was parallel analysis (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2007) . However, very few of the studies employing parallel analysis clearly articulate their purpose for mixing qualitative and quantitative data, the weighting (or priority) given to the qualitative and quantitative data or the expected outcomes from doing so, mirroring previous research findings (O'Cathain et al., 2008) . The weighting, or priority, of the qualitative and quantitative data in a mixed methods study is dependent upon various factors including; the aims of the study and whether the purpose is, for example, to contextualise quantitative data using qualitative data or to use qualitative data to inform a larger quantitative approach such as a survey. Nonetheless, the omission of this statement makes it difficult to determine which data set the conclusions have been drawn from and the role of, or emphasis on, each approach. Therefore, is of importance for authors to clearly state this in their papers (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2007) . A number of studies had also used sequential data analysis (n = 46), where qualitative approaches were visibly used to inform the development of both clinical tools (e.g. and research measures and surveys (e.g. or where quantitative surveys were supplemented by and issues further explored using qualitative approaches (e.g. .
