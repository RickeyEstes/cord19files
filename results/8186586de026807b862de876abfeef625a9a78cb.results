We reviewed the cases of five patients with MERS-CoV (Table 1) . Their median age was 62 (range 24-81) years. The patients had chronic kidney disease and four were on maintenance hemodialysis. There were three men and two women. All patients tested negative for influenza. The median number of days from admission to therapy with ribavirin and interferon was 19 (range 10-22) ( Table 4 ). All patients received adjunctive corticosteroid therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Two patients developed increased lipase after the initiation of therapy, but both of them were given corticosteroids at the same time as antiviral therapy. One patient (case 2) developed thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count that dropped from 408 to 49 Ã‚ 10 9 /l (Tables 2 and 3) and one patient had possible hemolysis (case 3). All patients had severe disease with progressive respiratory failure, developed multi-organ failure, and died a mean 39.6 (standard deviation 8.5) days after admission. None of the patients had bacteremia or fungemia during their hospital stay. Figure 1 shows the median, minimum, and maximum values for amylase, lipase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for all the patients before initiation of therapy and at week1 and 2 after therapy initiation.
