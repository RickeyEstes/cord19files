All figures show good preservation of APN and DPP IV antigenicity as well as ultrastructural morphology. APN and DPP IV were found on the luminal side of the brush border membranes of human kidney proximal tubular cells (Fig. 1 a, b) and enterocytes of rat small intestine (Fig. 5 a, b) . A prominent, regular and diffuse labelling of both peptidases was found on these tissues. Control experiments (data not shown) with the respective preimmunserum did not show non-specific labelling.

The double labelling experiments showed a close spatial relationship between APN and DPP IV (Figs. 2a, 3 a, 4a ). Using the successive or simultaneous method no substantial differences in double labelling were seen. No cross-reactivity occurred in double labelling because control experiments led to identical results (Figs. 2 b, c, 3 b, c, 4 b, c) . Labelling density for APN appeared to be higher than for DPP IV (see also Kenny and Maroux, 1982) . In Fig. 6 (a, b) and Fig. 7 (a, b) the detection of APN (synovial fibroblasts, T lymphocytes) and DPP IV (T lymphocytes) on cultured cells are visible. Furthermore, goldlabelled vesicle-like structures were found in the luminal part of the cytoplasm of renal proximal tubular cells (Fig. 1 b) and of synovial fibroblasts (Fig. 6b ).
