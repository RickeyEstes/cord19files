A total of 27 datasets were returned (Table 3 , https://wwwnc. cdc.gov/EID/article/25/10/19-0497-T3.htm). Data covered a range of different assay formats: neutralization assays, ELI-SA, immunofluorescence tests, and 1 microarray. In general, there was good agreement between all the assays tested in this study. In assays with a quantitative measurement, the limit of detection and titer of samples varied greatly, but overall determination of positive or negative agreed between all assays except for 1 (laboratory 04 TCID 50 MN [microneutralization]), which failed to detect 2 positive samples (samples 9 and 18) that all other tests detected as positive. The panel of negative control samples was deemed to be negative in all quantitative assays. There were 3 instances of laboratories reporting a result above cutoff for samples in 1 assay, but these samples were correctly diagnosed as negative overall by their testing algorithms: laboratory 02 detected samples 3 and 7 as above cutoff at 1:80 dilution in 1 assay only; laboratory 02 detected sample 13 as above cutoff at 1:100 and 1:400 dilutions in 1 assay; and laboratory 03 detected sample 13 as above cutoff at 1 dilution tested. Participants detected pool A, the high-titer MERS-CoV antibody pool (sample 16) in all assays (Table 3) . They detected pool B, the medium-titer pool (sample 18), in all but 1 of the quantitative assays, a TCID 50 MN assay from laboratory 04. In all other quantitative assays, participants detected the high pool at a higher titer than the medium pool. In the qualitative assays, 3 assays gave borderline positive or equivocal results for the medium pool; these assays were a Euroimmun S1 ELISA (https:// www.euroimmun.com) in laboratories 01 and 10 and an in-house immunofluorescence assay in laboratory 07. The low-positive pool (pool C, sample 14) was only detected as positive in a single assay in the study, the Alpha Diagnostic International MERS NP ELISA performed in laboratory 05. Participants scored positive the 2 purified IgG samples from MERS-CoV-immunized transchromosomal bovine samples (samples 4 and 10) in all the qualitative assays, but 2 of the quantitative assays, N ELISA from laboratory 02 and the Alpha Diagnostic International MERS NP ELISA from laboratory 05, were unable to detect these samples. We expected these 2 NP assays to fail to detect sample 10 because this antibody was raised against recombinant 1880 Emerging Infectious Diseases • www.cdc.gov/eid • Vol. 25, No. 10, October 2019 MERS spike protein only; however, it was surprising that the assays did not detect sample 4, which was an antibody raised against whole inactivated virus. For the individual convalescent-phase plasma samples, we saw more variability in the results when compared with the pooled material, but despite this, 3 of the samples (samples 5, 11, and 12) were correctly identified as positive in all tests. Sample 1 was correctly diagnosed as positive in all tests but was identified as borderline positive by laboratory 01 in a Euroimmun ELISA assay. Sample 9 was the most difficult individual patient plasma to detect as positive; it was negative in the TCID 50 MN assay in laboratory 04; equivocal/positive in the in-house immunofluorescence assay in laboratory 07; and, in the Euroimmun ELISA, borderline/negative in lab 01, equivocal in lab 07, and weak positive in lab 10. Sample 9 was the weakest positive of the individual samples tested in the panel, as we saw from the titers in the quantitative assays that detected it as positive. We compiled the results of quantitative assays for the 5 individual positive plasma samples ( Figure 2 ). To simplify comparison of the assays, we reported results from the different laboratories as relative to either the transchromosomal bovine IgG sample raised against whole inactivated virus (sample 4) or the high-positive pooled human serum (pool A, sample 16). When we expressed data as a potency relative to either of the 2 chosen potential reference preparations with an assigned arbitrary value of 1,000, we observed improvement in the agreement between tests (Table 4 ; Figure 3 ). We saw the greatest reduction in the variation between laboratories (smaller SEM in Figure 3 and smaller percentage geometric coefficient of variation [GCV] in Table 4 ) when we used pooled human serum (sample 16) as standard. The transchromosomal bovine IgG raised against whole virus (sample 4) showed a substantial improvement in the agreement between laboratories; however, 2 ELISA methods included in this study could not identify this sample as positive.
