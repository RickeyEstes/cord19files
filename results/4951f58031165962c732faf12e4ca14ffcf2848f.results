Pb enhances both factor-mediated and cognate T cell help for AFC generation. The independent influences of B-T cell contact and soluble T cell factors on B cell differentiation were evaluated using membrane segregated cultures. As shown in Table 1 , PbCI2 significantly increased the number of SRBC-specific AFCs from both the upper and lower chambers of membrane segregated cultures. Optimal enhancement (sixfold) of the AFC response of upper chamber B cells was obtained when PbC12 was added to both chambers (Table 1, Row 1); however, the addition of Pbpretreated B cells to the upper (Row 2) or lower (Row 3) chambers yielded two-and threefold increases respectively in the AFC response of b After 5 days in culture, cells from both chambers were harvested and AFCs were enumerated. Values represent the ratio of the number of AFC detected in the indicated chambers compared to the number of AFC detected in identical control cultures without any Pb treatment. AFC/106 recovered cells for the controls were: Row 1-3, splenocytes plus B cells in the bottom (low) chamber (760 + 151, n = 4) plus B cells in the upper (top) chamber (1094 ---107, n = 4); Row 4, splenocytes plus resting B cells in the low chamber (336 + 50, n = 3) with resting B cells in the top chamber (98 ___ 15, n = 3); Row 5, splenocytes plus activated B cells in the low chamber (777 + 116, n = 3) with activated B cells in the top chamber (2553 + 383, n = 3). Student's t test was employed to examine statistically significant differences between the Pb treatments and the controls. * Indicates p < 0.001. ** Indicates p < 0.01. upper chamber B cells. Pb-pretreated B cells placed in the upper chambers did not significantly modify the AFC response of splenocytes in the lower chambers suggesting that the Pb did not dissociate from the upper chamber B cells and modulate the lower chamber response. Overall, the data suggest that Pb augments the AFC response by enhancing the production of putative helper T-cell-derived factors from lower chamber cells as well as the responsiveness of B cells to these factors. In addition, it is likely that Pb enhances the production of T-cell-derived factors by potentiating B-T cell interaction (i.e., cognate help). The magnitude of the enhancement in the upper chambers correlated with the activation stage of the responding B cells; that is, Pb increased the AFC response of resting B cells (Row 4) to a greater extent than unseparated B cells (Row 1) or activated B cells (Row 5). To substantiate that Pb enhanced B cell differentiation by cognate T cell help, splenocytes obtained from CBA/N mice which require B-T interaction for B cell differentiation (Sher, 1982) were studied. As with splenocytes from "normal" mouse strains, including CBA/J, DBA/2J, BALB/c, BCF1, and C3H/HeJ, Pb increased the AFC response of CBA/N splenocytes (Table 2) . To further elucidate whether B-T cell contact was required for Pb's enhancement of B cell differentiation into AFCs, the ability of Pb to enhance the AFC response under conditions where B-T cell contact was prevented by the use of monoclonal antibodies with specificity for T cell surface molecules that are involved in B-T cell interaction was examined. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 , anti-L3T4 reduced the control AFC response by 75% but insignificantly lowered the AFC response in the presence of Pb. In contrast, anti-Lyt2, which blocks suppressor cell activity, enhanced the AFC response in both the presence and absence of Pb. By reducing B cell-CD4 ÷ T cell interactions, anti-L3T4 reduces the activation of helper T cells; however, in the presence of Pb, Note. Splenocytes from the indicated mouse strains were cultured at 5 × 106 cells/well plus SRBC in the presence or absence of 100/.tM PbC12. After 5 days, the cells were harvested and AFCs were enumerated. The values are the mean of triplicate wells (SD < 15%) and are representative of four separate experiments. despite the reduced cognate interaction, factormediated help remained enhanced. Hence, the effect of diminished cognate help by the anti-L3T4 is negated. Furthermore, the efficiency of the anti-L3T4 blockade could be dimin-ished since Pb increases the density of the CD4 ligand (i.e., Ia) on B cells (McCabe and Lawrence, 1990 ). Enhancement of the AFC response by Pb in the presence ofanti-Lyt2 supports the view that Pb immunopotentiation is due to the enhancement of helper T cell activities or direct effects on B cells and not due to the inhibition of suppressor T cell functions. The effect of Pb on Ig production in the presence of antigen specific T cell help. The nature of the effect of Pb on B-T cell interaction was unclear. Conceivably, Pb could alter the B cell surface (i.e., create a neoantigen) so that T cells bearing the appropriate clonotypic T cell antigen-specific receptors could then recognize Pb-altered-self antigens and respond accordingly. Considering this possibility, the influence of Pb on B cell differentiation in cultures containing B cells, antigen, and antigen-specific T cell clones as the sole source of T cell help was tested. In contrast to the heterogeneous polyclonal repertoire of T cell receptor specificities of splenic T cells (potentially including those with specificity for a possible Pbaltered-self antigen), T cell clones having unique antigen specificities were used to cir- Splenocytes were cultured at 5 × 106 cells/well plus SRBC _+ PbC12. Monoclonal anti-L3T4 and anti-Lyt2 at 2.5 ~tg/ml or 5 #g/ml of nonspecific Rat IgG were added to individual wells at culture initiation. After 5 days, the cells were harvested and AFCs were enumerated. The results represent the mean _+ SEM from three experiments (actual AFC/106 cells for the saline Rat IgG control was 108 _+ 24). The values above the bars represent p values (t tests) for comparisons of AFC responses in the presence of blocking antibodies (anti-L3T4 or anti-Lyt2) _+ Pb versus the AFC responses in the presence of Rat IgG + Pb. cumvent the complication of Pb potentially activating putative Pb-altered-self reactive T cells. Initially, a SRBC primed T cell line was tested in cocultures containing B cells and SRBC +_ 100 #M PbC12. Pb significantly enhanced (twofold) the AFC response in these cultures (Fig. 2) arguing against a Pb-alteredself phenomenon. To further substantiate this claim, other antigen-specific T cell clones were utilized. The THE clone, D10.G4.1, which is specific for either CA/H-2 k or an allo-reactive epitope of H-2 b, was cultured _+ 10 or 100 #M PbC12 with either C3H/HeJ (H-2 k) B cells plus CA or C57BL/6 (H-2 b) B cells plus anti-Ig. In the CA/H-2 k B cell system, optimal help for CA-specific IgM production was obtained with 10 4 D10.G4.1 cells per culture. At this cell density, l0/~M Pb significantly increased CAspecific IgM production (Fig. 3a) . This result has been corroborated using an additional TH2 cell clone, CDC 25, which has specificity for RGG in association with H-2 d (data not shown). As with the CA/H-2k-specific stimulation of the D10.G4.1 cells, Pb enhanced polyclonal IgM production in the allo-stimulated system (Fig. 3b) . In contrast to this influence on allo-stimulated polyclonal TH2 activity, Pb inhibited the polyclonal IgM response of BALB/c (H-2 d) B cells cultured with anti-Ig and the H-2 d allo-specific THI clone M264-37 (Fig. 3c) . Pb differentially affects antigen presentation to TIC1 and Tn2 T cell clones. In a previous study, Pb (noncytotoxic doses) has been shown to inhibit antigen presentation (as measured by IL-2 production) to the ovalbumin-reactive T cell hybridoma, DO11.10 (Smith and Lawrence, 1988 ). The DO11.10 resembles a TH1like cell and similarly to the Tm clones (Fig.  3c) its activity was suppressed by Pb. In contrast to the inhibition of THI activation, our present results show that Pb enhances TH2 cell activity and the accompanying B cell responses (Figs. 3a and 3b) . To further substantiate these selective and diverse effects of Pb on helper T cell activities, the effects of Pb on several Tnl and TH2 clones were tested in antigen presen- 4000. tation assays. Pb inhibited antigen presentation by B cells to the KLH/H-2d-restricted Tm clone HDK-I (Fig. 4a) . The opposite result was obtained with D10.G4.1 (TH2 clone), in that Pb enhanced its antigen-specific (CA/H-2 k) response (Fig. 4b) . Using additional THI and TH2 clones, D1.6 and CDC25, respectively, which are both specific for RGG associated with H-2 d, Pb inhibited the THI proliferative response induced by RGG presented by splenocytes (Fig. 5a) and B cells (Fig. 5b) , but Pb enhanced the Try2 proliferative response (Fig. 5c ).
