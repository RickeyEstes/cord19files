We predict that, in the absence of any interventions, a disease with "best-guess" CoVID-19-like parameters will peak a median of 133 days (range 126 -147 days) following the start of personto-person transmission in England and Wales. Intrinsic model stochasticity is responsible for variation between model runs. Using exactly the same parameters and seeding the infection in the same initial wards resulted in a difference in peak timing of +/-10 days (figure 2). The attack rate for best-guess parameters had a median of 45799874 (81.67% range 81.64-81.69), with a peak incidence median 1,116,692. .

Epidemics seeded in Brighton, London, Birmingham and Sheffield resulted in synchronised epidemics in England, reaching urban areas first followed by rural areas. Epidemics started in Cardiff had a slower time to peak but still resulted in a generalised outbreak. Spatially, some disaggregation between England and Wales regions is observed. An outbreak starting in Brighton, (South East England) peaks in London and the South East first, and North East England, Yorkshire and Humber and Wales last, with a ten-day lag between regions ( Figure 3 ).
