Of the 100 bats tested, 67 (67%) were negative against all antigens (Fig 1) , whereas 33 bats showed titers against one or more antigens . Unique reactivity to single proteins was observed for H3 (n = 1), H5 (n = 1) and H8 (n = 1, titer: 42). We found no significant differences in seropositivity between sexes, age groups, sampling season and -year, respectively ( Table 2 ).
