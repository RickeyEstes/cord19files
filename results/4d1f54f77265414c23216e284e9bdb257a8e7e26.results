The bat genome contains three Oas genes with interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in the promoter region, two Oasl genes, and one RNase L gene. Using the genomic sequences of Egyptian Rousette bat from GenBank, we analyzed the genes and protein sequences of bat OASs, OASLs, and RNase L (28) . The genes were annotated as OAS1 (GenBank ID 107513273), OAS3-like (GenBank ID 107513228), OASL (GenBank ID 107513228), and OASL2 (GenBank ID 107501264). No OAS2 was noted. The Egyptian Rousette (ER) bOAS1 gene encodes a protein that shares 67% and 59% amino acid sequence similarity to human OAS1 and mouse Oas1, respectively ( Table 1) . The annotated ER OAS3-like gene encodes a protein of 1,903 amino acids. Amino acids 1 to 1082 share 80% similarity with human OAS3 (1,083 amino acids), and amino acids 1197 to 1903 share 71% similarity with human OAS2 (709 amino acids). These results suggested that the annotated ER OAS3-like gene encoded an OAS3-OAS2 fusion protein. Since in most known species, OAS2 and OAS3 are two separate genes, we could not exclude the possibility that ER OAS3 and OAS2 genes were falsely annotated as one gene. To clarify this question, we attempted to clone the mRNA encoded by the bOAS1 and bOAS3-like genes. We cloned the bOAS1 open reading frame (ORF) successfully, but we could not clone the mRNA predicted to encode a bOAS3-bOAS2 fusion protein. Instead, we cloned two cDNAs which encode bOAS2 and bOAS3 open reading frames separately. These results suggested that ER bats and humans share similar OAS gene structures (Fig. 1 ).

GenBank protein accession numbers are shown in parentheses as follows: bat proteins, bOAS1 (XP_016005252), bOAS2 (QCT83250.1), bOAS3 (QCT83251.1), bOASL1 (XP_015982708), and bOASL2 (XP_015982728); human proteins, hOAS1 (NP_058132.2), hOAS2 (NP_058197.2), hOAS3 (NP_006178.2), and hOASL1 (Q15646); mouse proteins, mOAS1a (P11928), mOAS2 (E9Q9A9), mOAS3 (Q8VI93), mOASL1 (Q8VI94), and mOASL2 (Q9Z2F2). Vector NTI 10 was used to do the sequence alignment. c ND, not determined. Human and mouse OAS genes are induced by interferon (IFN) (i.e., they are interferon-stimulated genes [ISGs]) and thus contain interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in the promoter regions, required for interferon-inducible transcription. To determine whether ER Oas genes are ISGs, we analyzed the genomic sequences for ISREs (A/GNGAAANNGAAACT or AGTTTCNNTTTCNC/T) (30) . We found that the ER Oas1 gene promoter region contains one ISRE with high sequence identity with that of human OAS1 (Fig. 1) . Upstream of the bOAS2 coding region, we found two adjacent ISREs in the opposite polarity, the first with homology to the one ISRE found in the human OAS2 gene. The ISRE of ER bOAS3 is identical to the first one of two found in the human OAS3 gene. We did not find an ISRE in the promoter region of the ER RNase L gene. bOAS1, bOAS2, and bOAS3 mRNAs are induced by IFN-␣ or infection with SINV or SeV in RoNi/7 cells. RoNi/7 cells were treated with human universal IFN-␣, the relative mRNA levels were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), and the fold increase in expression over mock-treated cells was calculated. Induction of bat IFIT1 (ISG56) mRNA was used as a positive control (14) and was increased by 81-fold upon IFN-␣ treatment ( Fig. 2A ). All three bOAS mRNAs were induced by IFN-␣; the bOAS1 mRNA level increased by 48-fold, while the mRNA level of bOAS2 and bOAS3 increased by 22-and 11-fold, respectively ( Fig. 2A) , consistent with the ISREs in their promoters. The mRNA level of RNase L did not change upon IFN treatment in RoNi/7 cells, indicating that, similarly to the human RNASEL gene, bat RNASEL is not an ISG ( Fig. 2A) , consistent with the lack of an ISRE in its promoter region (data not shown). To investigate induction of bOAS genes during viral infection, RoNi/7 cells were infected with SINV or Sendai virus (SeV). While the relative mRNA level of bOAS1 increased by 70-to 80-fold during SINV or SeV infection, bOAS2 mRNA was only weakly (4-to 6-fold) induced and bOAS3 mRNA was induced somewhat more (15-or 9-fold) during SINV or SeV infection, respectively ( Fig. 2B and C), similar to induction by IFN-␣ ( Fig. 2A to C) . Amino acid sequence alignment indicates that the Egyptian Rousette bOAS1, bOAS2, bOAS3, and bOASL2 proteins are oligoadenylate synthetases with potential catalytic activity. The human and mouse OAS genes and proteins have been extensively studied (21, 24) . To investigate the bat OAS gene family, we aligned the predicted amino acid sequences of bat, human, and mouse OAS and OASL proteins. While bOAS protein sequences are highly homologous to human and mouse proteins, in each case bOAS1, bOAS2, and bOAS3 share more homology with human than with mouse proteins (Table 1) . We aligned the catalytic domain of each bOAS protein (full-length bOAS1, domain II of bOAS2 [bOAS2.2], and domain III of bOAS3 [bOAS3.3]) with the corresponding protein or domains of human OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 (Fig. 3 ). Based on sequence homology and previous studies of the structure of human (31) and porcine (32) OAS1, bat OAS catalytic domains are composed of three parts, the N-terminal lobe (blue line in Fig. 3 ), the linker (red dotted line), and the C-terminal lobe (black line). Three aspartic acid residues (Asp75, Asp77, and Asp148 of hOAS1) indicated with diamonds are essential for enzymatic function of OASs and conserved among all the bat and human OASs (33) . The P-loop which contributes to the formation of the catalytic cavity is also conserved. The Arg or Lys residues (indicated by stars) participate in dsRNA binding and are conserved among all bat or human OASs. These results predict that bOAS1, bOAS2.2, and bOAS3.3 have the potential to recognize dsRNA and synthesize 2-5A. Besides three Oas genes, the Egyptian Rousette genome has two OAS-like genes (OASL1 and OASL2). The bOASL1 protein shares high sequence similarity with hOASL (79%) and mOASL1 (77%), suggesting that, like these human and mouse proteins, it does not have oligoadenylate synthetase activity (Table 1 ; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). However, bOASL2 is similar to mOASL2 (69%) ( Table 1 ) and when aligned with human OAS1 has a conserved catalytic domain, suggesting that it may have oligoadenylate synthetase activity (Fig. S2) . Egyptian Rousette (ER) RNase L shares high amino acid similarity to human RNase L with conserved 2-5A binding sites and endoribonuclease catalytic sites. By sequence alignment, we found that bRNase L shares 77% amino acid similarity with the human protein (Fig. 4 ). Similar to human or porcine RNase L, bRNase L contains three predicted domains, an N-terminal ankyrin-repeat domain (blue line in Fig. 4) , a pseudo-protein kinase domain (red dotted line), and an RNase domain (black line) (34) . The amino acids which are responsible for 2-5A binding (stars) and catalysis residues (diamonds) are conserved among bat and human RNase L sequences. Protein expression levels of OAS2 and OAS3 in bat cells are upregulated by IFN treatment. We generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against domain II of bOAS2 (anti-bOAS2) or domains II and III of bOAS3 (anti-bOAS3). (Attempts to raise antisera against bOAS1 were unsuccessful.) We used these antisera to determine both basal and induced OAS protein expression levels in bat cells derived from several species of bats. Activation of Bat RNase L Depends on OAS3 but Not MAVS ® Interestingly, antisera against either bOAS2 or bOAS3 detected both OAS proteins. Basal expression of OAS3 was detected in RoNi/7 cells and Eptesicus fuscus skin fibroblasts, and the expression was upregulated upon IFN-␣ treatment in both cell types (Fig. 5A ). While no to low basal OAS3 expression was detected in Myotis lucifugus skin fibroblasts, Myotis lucifugus embryonic fibroblasts, and Myotis velifer embryonic fibroblasts, the OAS3 protein expression level became detectable upon IFN treatment (Fig. 5A ). While basal OAS2 protein expression was observed in Eptesicus fuscus skin fibroblasts and weakly in Myotis lucifugus skin fibroblasts, expression of bOAS2 was detected in all of these bat cells following IFN treatment (Fig. 5A) . No OAS3-OAS2 fusion protein was detected in these cells, consistent with our cDNA cloning data. To assess activation of RNase L in these cells, we infected these bat cell lines with SINV; RNase L was activated in RoNi/7 cells and Eptesicus fuscus skin fibroblasts but not in other bat cells (Fig. 5B) , likely because SINV failed to replicate.
