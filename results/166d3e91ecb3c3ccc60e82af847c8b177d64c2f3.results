All of the monoclonal antibodies reacted with the F9 vaccine strain they were raised against. They also reacted with our reference strain of F9 and both of the other vaccine strains which were also based on F9 (Table 4 ). However, none of the remaining reference or clinical isolates reacted with all of the monoclonals tested with the possible exception of isolate G 83 (vaccine A reaction group) (Table 4 ). In general, there were varying patterns of reactivity, with monoclonals 4G12 and 6E8 being the most cross reactive amongst the clinical isolates tested (63.8% of the total clinical isolates tested) and lG9 the least (10.6%) (Tables 3 and 4) . Ten of the 47 clinical isolates (21.3%) tested did not react with any of the monoclonal antibodies used (Tables 3 and 4) . A spectrum of monoclonal antibody binding patterns was observed both within and between the clinical groups, and selected isolates could be distinguished from each other (Table 4 ). However, there were no consistent differences in the overall binding patterns between any of the clinical groups. The oral/respiratory disease group contained a higher proportion (63.6%) of isolates which did not react with any of the monoclonal antibodies (Table 3) . This reflected a lower reactivity of the acute oral/respiratory disease isolates overall compared to the other clinical groups (Table 4 ). In contrast, all of the isolates from vaccine B reactions reacted with at least one of the monoclonals.
