Cloning, expression and Solubility optimization. A 1005 bp segment encoding CHIKV nsP2pro was amplified using viral RNA as template by two step RT-PCR. The purified CHIKV nsP2pro amplicon was cloned in pET41a vector in frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST) and 6xHis at N-terminal, under T7 promoter. Screening of selected clones by sequencing revealed correct reading frame. SDS-PAGE analysis of the expressed protein on induction with 1 mM IPTG, showed expression of ~71 kDa CHIKV nsP2pro fusion protein with a dual (His 6 -GST) affinity tag. According to the densitometric analysis of bands on SDS-PAGE gel, under standard induction conditions (37 °C, 1 mM IPTG, 4 h), the recombinant CHIKV nsP2pro was found mainly in insoluble inclusion bodies (~80%), whereas, a very small fraction of protein remained in soluble form (~20%). Optimization of inducer concentration, temperature and induction time (18 °C, 0.5 mM IPTG, overnight) resulted in higher expression level of soluble CHIKV nsP2pro (~75%).
