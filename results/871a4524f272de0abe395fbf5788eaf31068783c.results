A total of 813 cases hospitalized due to influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus infection confirmed by RT-PCR and 2274 matched controls (1570 hospital and 704 PHC) were included. Cases had a mean age of 38.5 years (SD = 22.7), 50.4% were female, 84.9% were white, 56.9% had secondary or higher education, 42% were smokers or former smokers and 5.6% reported excessive alcohol consumption. Controls had similar characteristics with the only significant differences being in educational levels, ethnicity and pregnancy (Table 1) . Cases presented a higher frequency of risk factors and risk medical conditions for influenza compared with controls: specifically, cases had a higher frequency of pneumonia in the previous two years, COPD, asthma, HIV infection, disabling neurological disease, neoplasia, transplantation, morbid obesity, treatment with systemic corticosteroids and inhaled corticosteroids, and antibiotic treatment in the 90 days prior to admission (Table 2) . Cases also had a lower frequency of factors that may protect against influenza infection and hospitalization. Cases reported having received less information on preventing pandemic influenza (OR = 0.49; 95%CI 0.38-0.63) and a lower frequency of hand washing 5-10 times (OR = 0.73; 95%CI 0.60-0.89) and > 10 times (OR = 0.58; 95%CI 0.46-0.73) daily, the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers (OR = 0.83; 95%CI 0.68-1.01) and washing after touching potentially contaminated surfaces (OR = 0.58; 95%CI 0.46-0.73) in the seven days before the onset of symptoms (Table 3) . All the demographic and clinical variables associated with the risk of hospitalization (Tables 1 and 2) were introduced in the logistic regression model. In the multivariate analysis, receiving information on preventing influenza (OR = 0.44; 95% CI 0.33-0.60), and a higher frequency of hand washing and hand washing after contact with contaminated surfaces were protective factors against hospitalization due to influenza. In addition, they were dose-responsive. Hand
