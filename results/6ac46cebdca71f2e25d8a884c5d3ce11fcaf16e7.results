Approximately 800 patients were evaluated with respect to symptomatology and duration of symptoms (prescreening); of these, 201 were formally enrolled and screened. Of the enrolled patients, one was not randomized, and 200 were randomized and treated (I-C, N = 100; placebo, N = 100). Overall, 97.0 % of the 200 entered patients completed trial treatment, and 3.0 % prematurely discontinued treatment with trial medication. The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment was similar for the treatment groups (I-C: 2 of 100 patients, 2.0 %; placebo: 4 of 100 patients, 4.0 %). The most frequent reason for trial discontinuation was being lost to follow-up (I-C: 1 patient; placebo: 3 patients). Of the 200 treated patients, 98 in the I-C group and 97 in the placebo group provided data for the primary endpoint and were included in the FAS (Fig. 1) . Including the 200 patients who were treated, baseline demographic characteristics were comparable between the I-C and placebo groups (Table 1) .
