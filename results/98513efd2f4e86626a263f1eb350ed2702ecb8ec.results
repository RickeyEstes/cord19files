Sequencing of the HCoV-EMC/2012 genome. Using a combination of approaches, including deep sequencing, cycle sequencing on a more traditional capillary sequencer, and determination of the genomic termini by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), the complete genome sequence of HCoV-EMC/2012 was determined from material that had been subjected to passage in cell culture 6 times. The data from the Roche 454 GS Junior deepsequencing run yielded a total of 90,808 sequence reads, of which 87,256 were specific for HCoV-EMC/2012. Genome coverage ranged from 1 to 5,697 reads at single nucleotide positions, with an average of 1,006 reads in the deep-sequencing run. Based on the contigs assembled from these initial data, primers approximately 800 nucleotides (nt) apart were designed to amplify PCR fragments with 100-nt overlaps covering the entire virus genome (see Table S1 in the supplemental material for primer sequences). These amplicons were sequenced using Sanger sequencing, and a total of 104 sequence runs were assembled-along with the original 90,808 deep-sequencing reads-into a single contiguous sequence of 30,119 nt, including the first 12 nt of the 3= poly(A) tail. Although 454 sequencing resulted in a higher single-read error rate than Sanger sequencing, the high coverage in the first data set largely corrected for these errors. Occasionally, the correct number of bases in homopolymer stretches was difficult to determine, which is a typical problem in 454 sequencing. Nevertheless, there was excellent agreement between the deep-sequencing data and the confirmatory Sanger sequencing. The final consensus sequence was submitted to GenBank (see below). This sequence contains only two ambiguous positions, nt 11623 and 27162. The variation at position 11623 translates into a Val or Gly uncertainty at amino acid (aa) 3782 of pp1a/pp1ab. Position 27162 was either a G or an A, with the A creating a premature stop codon for translation of open reading frame 5 (ORF5) (see Discussion). The verification of our consensus sequence awaits the availability of a second HCoV-EMC/2012 virus isolate or original specimen. The overall content of G and C residues in the HCoV-EMC/2012 genome was 41%, which is similar to values reported for other coronaviruses (37% to 42%) (14) . Genome organization and expression strategy. Coronavirus genomes are polycistronic positive-stranded RNAs (Fig. 1A) , of which the 5=-proximal three-fourths are occupied by the large replicase open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b. These are translated from the genomic mRNA to produce polyproteins pp1a and, following Ϫ1 ribosomal frameshifting, pp1ab, which are subsequently cleaved into 15 or 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) (19, 23, 26) . The region downstream of ORF1b is characterized by containing a variable number of smaller genes, always including those encoding the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins. These genes are translated from subgenomic (sg) mRNAs that form a 5=-and 3=-coterminal nested set with the viral genome. Subgenomic mRNAs are composed of a common 5= leader sequence that is identical to the genomic 5= region and a variable part of the 3= quarter of the genome, with different sg mRNAs making different ORFs available for translation. The complement of the leader and "body" segments of the sg mRNAs are assumed to be joined during discontinuous negative-strand RNA synthesis. This step produces the templates for sg mRNA synthesis and is directed by a basepairing interaction between conserved transcription-regulatory sequences (TRSs) (27) (28) (29) . Such TRSs are found at the 3= end of the leader sequence (leader TRS) and at different positions upstream of genes in the genomic 3=-proximal domain (body TRSs). The synthesis of subgenome-length negative-stranded RNAs is directed by the complement of a body TRS at the 3= end of a nascent minus-strand base pairing with the leader TRS, with the extent of sequence complementarity being an important determinant of the level at which a given sg mRNA is produced. Inspection of the genome sequence of HCoV-EMC/2012 revealed the two large, partially overlapping replicase open reading van Boheemen et al. frames ORF1a and ORF1b, as well as (at least) nine downstream ORFs (Fig. 1A) . The ORF1a sequence encodes the two protease domains conserved in all other coronaviruses, a papain-like protease (PL2pro) in nsp3 and a 3C-like protease (3CLpro; also known as the "main protease") in nsp5. Sequence comparison with other coronaviruses allowed us to predict the putative pp1a/ pp1ab cleavage sites and annotate the resulting nsp1 through -16 (Table 1 ). According to sequence conservation analyses performed with other coronaviruses, open reading frames ORF2, -6, -7, and -8a are predicted to encode the four canonical structural proteins of coronaviruses, the envelope proteins S, E, and M and the N protein, respectively ( Fig. 1A ; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). A leader TRS and seven putative body TRSs could be readily identified, with the sequence 5= AACGAA 3= forming the conserved TRS core and potential TRS duplexes during leader-body joining ranging from 14 to 19 matches over a 22-nt window that includes the core of the leader TRS (Fig. 1B) . From this analysis, it can be predicted that seven subgenomic mR- a Amino acids of the replicase proteins pp1a and pp1ab were numbered with the assumption that a Ϫ1 ribosomal frameshift occurs to express ORF1b, as in other coronaviruses (see text); the use of the slippery sequence UUUAAAC is predicted to result in a peptide bond between Asn4385 and Arg4386 in pp1ab. b The major transmembrane domains and a selection of the most conserved domains with enzymatic activities that have been characterized functionally and/or structurally in coronaviruses are listed. Abbreviations: PL2pro, papain-like proteinase 2; ADRP, ADP-ribose 1Љ-phosphatase; TM, transmembrane domain; 3CLpro, 3C-like cysteine proteinase; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; ZD, putative zinc-binding domain; HEL1, superfamily 1 helicase; ExoN, 3=-to-5= exonuclease; NMT, N7-methyltransferase; NendoU, nidoviral endoribonuclease specific for U; OMT, S-adenosylmethionine-dependent ribose 2=-O-methyltransferase. NAs carrying a 67-nt common leader sequence would be produced in HCoV-EMC/2012-infected cells, with sizes ranging from 4.7 kb for mRNA2 to~1.7 kb for mRNA8. Experimental studies are needed to confirm the correct identification of the TRSs in the genomes of HCoV-EMC/2012 and related lineage C betacoronaviruses. Furthermore, mRNA4 and -8 are predicted to be functionally bicistronic, with ribosomal leaky scanning being the likely translation initiation mechanism for both ORF4b and ORF8b. The ORF4b AUG codon is not preceded by a separate body TRS, and the 241-nt sequence separating the 5= ends of ORF4a and ORF4b is entirely devoid of AUG codons. The AUG codon of the current ORF8b, an internal ORF that is overlapped by the N protein gene (ORF8a) and is present in all betacoronaviruses, is the third AUG codon on mRNA8, but sequence analysis and comparison with the BtCov-HKU4 and -HKU5 sequences (8) suggests that the 5= end of ORF8b may have become truncated relatively recently (see Discussion). Twenty-two additional putative ORFs of 150 to 432 nt in length were detected throughout the genome of HCoV-EMC/ 2012, overlapping the major ORFs. In contrast to the ORFs shown in Fig. 1A , these 22 additional ORFs are not positioned (immediately) downstream of a body TRS, and hence it is unlikely that they are expressed. The synthesis of the replicase pp1ab polyprotein of HCoV-EMC/2012 involves Ϫ1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting, with nt 13427 to 13433 predicted to form the conserved "slippery sequence" (5= UUUAAAC 3=) in the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap region that is typical for coronaviruses (30) . The frameshift region is followed by a predicted RNA hairpin, formed by nucleotides at positions 13439 to 13450 base pairing with those at 13462 to 13473, with potential RNA pseudoknot formation occurring by base pairing of the loop of the hairpin (nt 13452 to 13460) with a downstream complementary sequence (nt 13506 to 13514). As is common in coronavirus genomes, nontranslated sequences are found only at the genomic termini, with the 5= and 3= untranslated regions (278 and 300 nt, respectively) having sizes similar to those found in other family members. The only other apparently untranslated region in the genome that is larger than 50 nucleotides concerns the intergenic region between ORF5 and -6 (nt 27515 to 27589). This region appears to be conserved between HCoV-EMC/2012, BtCoV-HKU4, and BtCoV-HKU5, with sequence identities ranging from 63% to 84%, but we have no explanation for this observation thus far. Phylogenetic relations and taxonomic position of HCoV-EMC/2012. Phylogenetic trees were inferred using nucleotide sequences for ORF1ab ( Fig. 2A) and a 332-nt fragment from ORF1b (Fig. 2B ) encoding the most conserved part of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain, which is commonly targeted in virus discovery studies. The first tree was produced for a representative set of coronaviruses for which complete genome sequences are available. In the second tree, we also included coronaviruses for which only partial genome sequences are known, particularly that of P.pipi/VM314/2008/NLD (31) which produced the best match with HCoV-EMC/2012. In both trees, HCoV-EMC/2012 clearly groups within lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus, relatively close to BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5. However, based on the 332-nt fragment from ORF1b, HCoV-EMC/2012 is more closely related to bat-derived isolate VM314/2008 (GenBank accession number GQ259977), which was isolated from Pipistrellus bats in The Netherlands 4 years ago. Phylogenetic trees were also constructed based on amino acid sequences, using coronavirus-wide conserved domains of replicative proteins in pp1ab (Fig. 3A ) as well as using conserved parts of structural proteins (Fig. 3B ). In both trees, HCoV-EMC/2012 clusters with betacoronaviruses, supporting its classification as a member of the genus Betacoronavirus. ICTV assigns newly identified members of the family Coronaviridae to a subfamily and genus on the basis of rooted phylogeny and calculation of pairwise evolutionary distances for seven repli-case domains (1, 21) . To establish whether HCoV-EMC/2012 indeed prototypes a new species, amino acid sequence alignments were generated for each of these domains and concatenated, after which the sequence identity of HCoV-EMC/2012 with closely related strains was calculated. For this purpose, the full genomes of 9 strains, derived from 3 species, belonging to Betacoronavirus lineage C were available (Table 2) . Amino acid sequence identity between conserved replicase domains of HCoV-EMC/2012 and those of other lineage C viruses ranged from 57% (ADP-ribose 1Љ-phosphatase [ADRP]) to 94% (helicase [Hel]). Overall amino acid sequence identities to BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 strains across the conserved domains were around 75% and 76.7%, respectively. These percentages are well below the threshold of 90% amino acid sequence identity that is used for coronavirus species identification by the ICTV. The distance between (Fig. 3) . Consequently, we propose that HCoV-EMC/2012 prototypes a novel species of lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus.
