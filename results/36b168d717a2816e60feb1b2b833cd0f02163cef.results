Intracellular uptake of GF9-HDL by macrophages and colocalization of GF9 with TREM-1 Previously, we reported that oxidation of apo A-I or its peptides H4 and H6 significantly enhances in vitro macrophage uptake of GF9-HDL [18] . In this study, using fluorescence microscopy and GF9-HDL with Rho B-labelled lipid, we first demonstrated a punctuated pattern of the interaction between GF9-HDL and macrophages ( Fig. 2A) , which closely mimics that of the physiological interaction between native HDL and hepatocytes, which is mediated by scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) [23] . To confirm intracellular uptake versus nonspecific cell surface binding, we next examined the interaction between J774 macrophages and GF9-HDL that contain Rho B-labelled lipid and DyLight 488-labelled oxidized apo A-I peptide H4. This interaction resulted in intracellular delivery of both lipid and peptide components of GF9-HDL (Fig. 2B) , suggesting that the whole GF9-HDL particle is uptaken by the cell, most likely by a receptor-mediated mechanism. Pronounced colocalization of lipid and apo A-I peptide H4 (Fig. 2B ) demonstrates that at this time-point, most of the GF9-HDL particles remain intact after uptake, when the others are degraded, releasing their lipid and peptide contents into the intracellular space. While the data illustrated in Figure 2A and B were generated using GF9-sHDL, similar results were observed for GF9-dHDL (data not shown). Our data also indicate that the use of an equimolar mixture of oxidized peptides GA31 and GE31 enhances uptake of GA/E31-HDL of discoidal and spherical shape by macrophages in vitro as compared with their unmodified counterparts (data not shown). Together, these findings suggest that oxidized apo A-I epitopes responsible for the interaction with macrophages are exposed in all types of the HDL particles used. T cell receptor (TCR) SCHOOL peptide, known as TCR core peptide [21] , colocalizes with TCR in the T cell membrane [21] . Recently, we demonstrated that another TCR SCHOOL peptide MG11, the peptide derived from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus fusion peptide sequence, colocalizes with TCR and exhibits predicted T cell-related therapeutic activity in CIA [19, 24] . In the present study, we show that GF9 self-inserts into the cell membrane and colocalizes with TREM-1 (Fig. 2C) . Importantly, colocalization of GF9 with TREM-1 is observed after incubation of macrophages with either free GF9 (data not shown) or sHDL-bound GF9 (Fig. 2C ). This indicates that GF9 can reach its intramembrane site of action from both outside and inside the cell. Thus, the use of HDL-based platform for macrophage-targeted delivery results in intracellular uptake followed by release of the incorporated GF9 and its self-insertion into the cell membrane from inside the cell (Fig. 1B, Route 2) . Further, as suggested, oxidized GA31 and GE31 not only assist in the self-assembly of HDL but also target these particles to macrophages.
