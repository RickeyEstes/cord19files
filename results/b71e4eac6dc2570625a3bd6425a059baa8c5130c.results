Our analytical results include an expression for the realized reproduction number <, its partial derivatives with respect to control parameters and relationship to < 0 , the intrinsic reproduction number (Appendix A). A Mathematica TM notebook that evaluates these expressions for user-supplied parameter values, comparing the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on any disease transmitted by close contact, is available from the Table 1 Parameter estimates (b represents infection, r isolation efficiency, f hospitalization; subscripts E, P and R refer to pre-symptomatic, prodrome, and acute respiratory stage) from fitting predicted to observed cumulative admissions to TTSH during the first 30 days of the outbreak (cf. Fig. 2 ). Times correspond to 14 and 24 March, and 8 April, when control efforts changed (e.g., began or intensified). Chi represents the per capita rate at which exposed individuals are quarantined. Assumed distributions before and after introduction of control measures on 3/24-including not only quarantine and isolation, but exemplary health communications-are either gamma (G) or triangular (T).
