Effective Construct and Efficient Uptake of CPMOs with Absence of Cellular Cytotoxicity. In this study, CPMO1 and CPMO2 were designed to bind to the AUG region of ORF1 and ORF2 of CHIKV genomic RNA, respectively ( Fig. 1 ). Both CPMO target sequences were structurally accessible with no complex secondary folding (Fig. 1a ) and the sequences were also predicted to be highly conserved among different geographical strains of CHIKV ( Fig. 1b ; Table 1 ). Quantification of cell viability was done following incubation with a combination of PMOs and Endo-Porter (EP) delivery reagent, EP or individual CPMO on confluent HeLa cells for at least 24 h. More than 96% of the cells remained viable across PMO + EP concentration range at 24 h post-treatment (supplementary Figure S1a ). Consistently, cell viablity was also close to 100% for EP control treatment (supplementary Figure S1b ) and at least 94% was observed for CPMO treatment at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h post-treatment (Fig. 2a) . Taken together, this suggests that EP delivery, the designed CPMO and their combination had no apparent toxcity on HeLa cells. In order to visualize CPMO intracellular distribution following cellular uptake, cells were incubated with fluoresceinated-CPMOs (10 μ M) and EP (6 μ M) for 24 h, stained with DAPI dye and observed under fluorescence microscopy. None of the mock-treated and EP-treated cells have any visible fluorescence signal under FITC channel (Fig. 2b,c) . In contrast, 99% of CPMO1 and 97% of CPMO2-treated cells showed diffused fluorescence occuring individually or freely in clusters around the cytosol, thereby suggesting an efficient EP-mediated cellular uptake of CPMO. Next, CPMO-treated cells were subjected to CHIKV infection (M.O.I. 0.1) in an attempt to investigate whether intracellular stability of CPMO is affected during post-CHIKV infection. Fluorescence signals of CPMO1 and CPMO2 were similarly detected in at least 84% of CHIKV-infected cells at day 1, 2 and 3 p.i (Fig. 2d ). Similar to post-treatment, CPMO signals were only located in the cell cytosol and most of them colocalized with CHIKV E2 protein stain. This suggests that CPMO could be distributed to the Endoplasmic reticulum where it inhibits CHIKV protein expression. Though CPMO signals were comparatively reduced at day 3 p.i., they have remained intracellularly stable among CHIKV-infected cells as observed by the evident fluorescence signal. Significant Reduction of CHIKV titre and viral Protein level in CPMO1-treated Cells. After pretreatment of HeLa cells with CPMO1 targeting the synthesis of CHIKV non-structural polyprotein or CPMO2 that is targeting the synthesis of structural polyprotein, CHIKV infection was carried out at M.O.I. 0.1 and virus titre in the culture supernatant was quantitated by viral plaque assays. Post-infection time-points, day 1, 2 and 3 were chosen based on CHIKV growth kinetic in HeLa cells, where the highest CHIKV titre was produced at day 3 p.i (supplementary Figure S2) . Mock, EP and sCPMOs treatments produced similarly high levels of CHIKV titre from Day 1-3 p.i (Fig. 3a) . Relative to mock-treated (a) CPMO1 binds to a sequence (25-mer) upstream of the first Open Reading Frame (ORF), which encodes the non-structural proteins (nsP1-4) while CPMO2 targets a sequence (25-mer) in the second ORF which is important for the expression of Capsid (C), E1 and E2 structural proteins. These structural proteins are required for the formation of the mature CHIKV virion. Black arrows indicate translation initiation. Secondary structures of CPMO target region in the CHIKV genome are predicted by mfold program (http:// mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q= mfold/RNA-Folding-Form). Both CPMOs are conjugated to a carboxyflurocesin tag (oval) at the 3' end. AUG translational start site is outlined in box. CPMO1 target site appears to be more accessible compared to CPMO2. (b) NCBI blast nucleotide alignment with representative geographical strains of CHIKV showed high similarity in CPMO target sequences except for a few mismatch base.

In contrast, pre-treatment with equal concentration of CPMO2 achieved only a 1 log 10 PFU/ml reduction in CHIKV titre at day 2 and 3 p.i. In parallel with quantification of virus titre, the total cell lysates of CPMO or sCPMO treated-cells were harvested at all three days p.i for Western blot detection of CHIKV E2 and nsP3 protein expression level. In mock, EP or sCPMO-treated cells, increasing level of expression of CHIKV E2 (Fig. 3b ,c) and nsP3 protein (Fig. 3d ,e) were observed from day 1 to day 3 p.i, correlating to the increasing virus titres (Fig. 3a) . On the other hand, viral E2 and nsP3 protein level was almost completely suppressed at day 1-3 p.i in cells pre-treated with 10 μ M of CPMO1. Similarly, CPMO2-treated cells showed strong reduction in both E2 and nsP3 protein expression relative to CHIKV-infected control ( Fig. 3b-e) . However, CPMO2 treatment seemed less effective in silencing the production of E2 protein and infectious CHIKV titre relative to CPMO1. Taken together, these findings highlight the strong antiviral efficacy of CPMO1 against CHIKV replication. In the interest of whether CPMO1 is specific in its inhibitory effect to CHIKV per se, we carried out similar treatment assay of CPMO1 on HeLa cells and subjected them to Sindbis virus (SINV) or Dengue virus (DENV) infection at M.O.I 0.1 for day 1-3 p.i. SINV was used in this study as it belongs to the Togaviridae family similar to CHIKV while DENV is a representative member of the flaviviruses. Quantification of virus titre by viral plaque assays demonstrated no significant difference in SINV or DENV titre for CPMO1-treatment relative to the mock-treated cells (Fig. 3f,g) . In support of this data, homology alignment of CPMO1 target sequence in CHIKV RNA (GenBank; FJ445502) to SINV (GenBank; NC_001547) and DENV genome (GenBank; M29095.1) revealed no significant similarity (data not shown). Therefore, we deduce that CPMO1 is highly specific against CHIKV with no cross-reactivity to the replication of other alphaviruses or flaviviruses.
