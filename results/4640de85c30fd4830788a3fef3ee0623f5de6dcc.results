The presence or absence of N. gonorrheae is determined by relating the absorbance of the unknown specimen to the cutoff value. The cutoff value is the absorbance of the negative control mean (NCX) plus factor 0.190. Unknown samples with absorbance values greater than or equal to the cutoff value established with the negative control are to be considered positive for N. gonorrhoeae a Gonozyme test according to Abbott Laboratories. b All solutions with antimicrobial agents. from urethral or endocervical swabs. This test may detect N. gonorrhoeae that fail to grow on selective media because of the sensitivity of the bacteria to an antibiotic or because they are not viable. In the Gonozyme test treated beads are incubated with a swab specimen and appropriate controls. The bacteria from the positive swab specimen adsorb to the bead. The bead is incubated with antibody to N. gonorrhoeae which reacts with gonococci on the bead. Next, the bead is incubated with antibody-enzyme conjugate containing horseradish peroxidase which reacts with the antigen-antibody complex on the bead. The enzyme reaction after incubation of the washed bead with o-phenylenediamine (OPD) containing hydrogen peroxide (H 2 0 2 ) is determined using a spectrophotometer with wavelength set at 492 nm. Current methods used to identify N. gonorrhoeae in endocervical cultures appear to detect less than 90%. Papasian et al. (1984) evaluated the commercial enzyme immunoassay kit and found a sensitivity and specificity of about 95-98% for specimens from males and 80-88% from females; it would appear that this kit is less suitable for the detection of N. gonorrhoeae in females. This study confirms other reports by Aardoom et al. (1982) and Schachter et al. (1984) but contradicts a similar evaluation by Danielsson et al. (1983) . All investigations agree that this assay has high sensitivity and specificity for detection in specimens from males. The wide discrepancies of results for specimens from females may be due to differences in specimen collection, or may, as Papasian et al. (1984) pointed out, be due to a lack of immunological specificity. The positive predictive value using this commercial kit was about 25% lower for females and needs improvement. It is possible, however, that the choice of culture as standard may not be optimal since this standard may be false negative, and the commercial kit result may in fact be correct, though studies of Stamm et al. (1984) suggest that this is not so. However, this assay could have a major impact on the control of the spreading of gonor-rhea if improved for cervical gonorrhea. For symptomatic gonorrhea, the Gram stain is inexpensive and adequate. In their study of Gonozyme kit, Smeltzer et al. (1985) found that the ELISA procedure, which is based on the detection of outer membrane complex of N. gonorrhoeae, is an alternative method of gonorrhoeae diagnosis in both men and women. Geiseler et al. (1985) pointed out that Gonozyme is comparable with Gram stain for rapid diagnosis of gonorrhea in females. Enzyme immunoassays, the Western blot, and related techniques were used for the characterization and detection of immunodominant surfaceexposed protein antigens of Treponema pallidum (Moskophidis and MÃ¼ller, 1985) . Using monoclonal antibodies to these antigens it was possible to diagnose human syphilis infection and to characterize T. pallidum protein antigens.
