Structure description. Our cryo-EM structure shows the nsp12 polymerase bound to an nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer with a second subunit of nsp8 occupying a distinct binding site (Fig. 1a, b) . nsp12 contains a polymerase domain (a.a. 398-919) that assumes a structure resembling a cupped "right hand" similar to other polymerases 17 (Fig. 1c) . The polymerase domain is comprised of a fingers domain (amino acids (a.a.) 398-581, 628-687), a palm domain (a.a. 582-627, 688-815), and a thumb domain (a.a. 816-919). CoV nsp12 also contains a nidovirus-unique N-terminal extension (a.a. 1-397) of which a.a. 117-397 were resolved in the cryo-EM map (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 and  Supplementary Table 1) . Although not previously predicted, the SARS-CoV nsp12 contains two metal-binding sites to which we have assigned zinc atoms. The first is in the nidovirus-unique extension and is coordinated by His295, Cys301, Cys306, and Cys310. The second is in the fingers domain and is coordinated by Cys487, His642, Cys645, and Cys646. All eight of these metal-coordinating a.a. are highly conserved across the CoV family ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Both of these metal-binding sites are distal to known active sites as well as protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Thus these ions are expected to be structural components of the folded protein rather than directly involved in enzymatic activity. The presence of structural zinc ions in nsp12 is reminiscent of bound zinc atoms in coronavirus nsp3, nsp10, nsp13, and nsp14 10, 13, 18, 19 and points to an extensive utilization of zinc ions for folding proteins of the viral replication complex. The outer surface of nsp12 carries a largely negative electrostatic potential (Fig. 2a) . However, the polymerase RNA template and nucleotide triphosphate (NTP)-binding sites carry a strong positive electrostatic potential. The nsp7 and two nsp8binding sites as well as the RNA exit tunnel are comparatively neutral. Similarly, the nsp7 and nsp8 surfaces contacting nsp12 are also relatively neutral. The second subunit of nsp8 contains some basic residues in the N-terminal region visible in the structure (a.a. 77-98) contributing to an extension of the positive electrostatics of the template-binding channel. Analysis of sequence conservation across the CoV family reveals that the template entry, template-primer exit, and NTP tunnels, as well as the polymerase-active site, are the most highly conserved surfaces on nsp12 (Fig. 2b) . There is also a conserved surface on the nsp12 nidovirus-unique extension, which may represent an interaction site for the N-terminal disordered domain of nsp12 (1-116) that is not resolved in the structure (Fig. 2c, d) . The binding site for the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer is well conserved and overlaps with the conserved regions of polymerase functional domains (fingers and thumb domains). Conversely, there is less conservation of the second nsp8-binding site on nsp12. More conserved nsp12 residues contact the nsp8 N-terminal region (77-126), while contacts with the nsp8 Cterminal head domain are mediated primarily by main chain atoms, which may have less stringent requirements in their a.a. composition to retain binding. nsp12 N-terminal extension. The SARS-CoV nsp12 is 932 a.a. in length, which is in contrast to the polymerases of the closely related picornaviruses that are typically closer to 500 a.a. While the C-terminal region of nsp12 contains the RNA polymerase domain, the large N-terminal nidovirus-unique extension has long remained enigmatic. Sequence analysis of polymerase subunits across the Nidovirales order, which includes CoVs, revealed three conserved sequence motifs within this region: A N (SARS-CoV a.a. 69-89), B N (a.a. 112-130), and C N (a.a. 202-222) 9 ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Further experimentation revealed that the equine arterivirus polymerase subunit could be covalently modified with GTP or UTP and that mutations within the identified conserved motifs had negative impacts on this activity as well as viral growth and recovery, the proposed active site being a lysine residue in A N (SARS-CoV Lys73) 9 . The conserved regions of the polymerase harboring this nucleotidyltransferase activity were termed NiRAN 9 . However, the role and mechanisms of this nucleotidyltransferase activity remain to be elucidated. The nsp12 nidovirus-unique extension contacts the polymerase on the outside of the fingers domain and at the base of the palm domain ( Fig. 1) . Despite attempts at focused refinement of the cryo-EM map, the N-terminal 116 a.a. of nsp12 are not visible in the structure. Diffuse density localized to this region in the cryo-EM reconstructions suggests that the N-terminus is present but highly flexible. The portion of the nsp12 N-terminal extension that we observe in the map (a.a. 117-397) forms a contiguous domain with the fingers domain using a large number of wellconserved hydrophobic interactions. the remaining nsp12 domains. The conserved a.a. from motifs B N and C N appear to form a single site on nsp12 (Fig. 2c, d) . Of the seven NiRAN a.a. that are strictly conserved across the Nidovirales order, we observe four. Asp126 forms the center of the conserved face while Asp218 and F219 are on an external loop near the bottom of the conserved face. While these three a.a. are surface exposed, Gly214 is in a loop turn and is directed away from the conserved face possibly indicating this residue's importance in proper positioning of the downstream Asp218 and F219 rather than direct involvement in NiRAN activity. nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. As noted above, the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase resembles a cupped right hand with fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains. Within the fingers domain are the index, middle, ring, and pinky finger loops. In positive-strand RNA virus polymerases, the index finger loop reaches over the active site to contact the thumb domain, positioning the ring-finger loop beneath it 20 . In SARS-CoV nsp12, the contacts between the index finger and the thumb domain are particularly extensive with the positioning of an alpha-helix in the index finger loop to pack with the thumb helical bundle. The index finger-thumb interaction site also forms the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer-binding site, with most of the contacts made between nsp12 and nsp7. All viral polymerases possess seven conserved motif regions (A-G) involved in template and nucleotide binding and catalysis 21-23 (Figs. 1a and 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Superposition of the elongation complexes of poliovirus 24 and norovirus 25 polymerases onto the SARS-CoV nsp12 reveals the path of the RNA past the active site and indicates a.a. involved in binding or catalysis (Fig. 3b) . Single-stranded RNA template threads its way past motif G before entering the active site composed of motifs A and C and supported by motifs B and D. Incoming NTPs would enter the active site through a tunnel at the back and interact with motif F. Motif E at the base of the thumb interacts with the 3′ nucleotide of the primer strand 26 . The primer-template product of RNA synthesis exits the active site though the RNA exit tunnel. This double-stranded RNA product would interact with the N-terminal region of motif G in the fingers domain via the major groove while a helix (SARS-CoV a.a. 851-864) from the thumb domain interacts with the minor groove. CoVs possess the largest known RNA genomes and require an RNA synthesis complex with the fidelity to faithfully replicate their RNA. In the polymerase-active site, incoming NTPs form a base pair with the template RNA while the 2′ and 3′ hydroxyls form hydrogen bonds with the polymerase. In SARS-CoV nsp12, the 2' hydroxyl of the incoming NTP is likely to form hydrogen bonds with Thr680 and Asn691 in motif B. In addition, Asp623 in motif A is positioned to interrogate the 3′ hydroxyl though hydrogen bonding. All three of these residues are conserved across the CoV family. Base pairing of the incoming NTP is also facilitated by stacking of the +1 template RNA base on a hydrophobic side chain in motif F. In SARS-CoV nsp12, this a.a. is Val557. The nucleoside analog GS-5734 is capable of impairing CoV RNA synthesis by targeting the viral RNA synthesis machinery 27 . When murine hepatitis virus, a Betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV, was passaged in the presence of GS-5734, two mutations in nsp12 with partial resistance arose: Phe480Leu and Val557Leu 27 (SARS-CoV nsp12 numbering). The presence of the bulkier leucine side chain at a.a. 557 is likely to create a greater stringency for base pairing to the templating nucleotide possibly enabling nsp12 to better exclude this analog from its active site. The 557 a.a. position has also previously been indicated in modulating polymerase fidelity 28 . A.a. 480 is located in the fingers domain contacting motif B and may impact active-site dynamics related to catalysis. Interactions of nsp12 with nsp7 and nsp8. The CoV RNA synthesis complex is governed by a large number of protein-protein interactions. Both nsp7 and nsp8 have essential roles in the formation and activity of the RNA synthesis machinery 7 (Supplementary Fig. 4) . The co-crystal structure of SARS-CoV nsp7 and nsp8 demonstrated that the nsp8 C-terminal head domain folds around the nsp7 helical bundle 14 . The N-terminal region of nsp8 (1-81) adopts a more extended or disordered conformation. In the crystal packing of the nsp7-nsp8 structure, the authors hypothesized the formation of a hetero-hexadecamer protein complex. However, for feline CoV, the co-crystal structure of nsp7 and nsp8 displayed a 2:1 stoichiometry and lacked the higher-order oligomer formation hypothesized in the SARS-CoV nsp7-nsp8 structure 29 . nsp8 has also been suggested to possess an activity polymerizing short RNA oligonucleotides proposed to be used as primers during RNA synthesis 15 . Mutagenesis has suggested that this primase activity lies in the N-terminal region of nsp8 and requires the formation of large oligomeric complexes to bring the active site residues into proximity 15, 16 . However, more recent work has shown that the SARS-CoV nsp7-nsp8-nsp12 complex was capable of de novo initiation and that this activity was dependent on the nsp12 polymerase-active site 7 . A number of studies have confirmed the direct interaction between nsp8 and nsp12 [30] [31] [32] . In addition, nsp12 has also been suggested to interact with nsp5, nsp9, and nsp13 30 while nsp8 has been suggested to interact with nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, nsp13, and nsp14 32 . The large number of interactions between nsp8 and nsp12 with the other viral nsps suggests that these two proteins form a hub for protein-protein interactions within the viral replication complex. However, the structures of nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 in complex, their stoichiometry, and how they present their surfaces for additional interactions had remained unclear. Examination of the cryo-EM map revealed density for a single complex of nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer bound to nsp12 resembling previously determined crystal structures (Fig. 4a) . This density includes nsp7 a.a. 2-71 and nsp8 a.a. 84-192 encompassing the nsp8 head domain while the N-terminal region of nsp8 appears to be disordered. The nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer binds to nsp12 on the polymerase thumb domain facing the NTP entry channel. Binding in this position sandwiches the nsp12 polymerase index finger loop between nsp7-nsp8 and the polymerase thumb domain. The nsp12 index finger loop has been previously identified as necessary for recruitment of nsp12 to replication complexes 30 . The binding of the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer to this loop suggests that nsp7-nsp8 facilitates the interaction of nsp12 with additional components of the RNA synthesis machinery for incorporation into viral replication complexes. Although nsp7 and nsp8 are known to form a 1:1 complex 14 and were provided in a 1:1 ratio, model building of the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complex revealed unexpected density for a second subunit of nsp8 (a.a. 77-191) without a bound nsp7. This second subunit of nsp8 interacts with the nsp12 interface domain proximal to the fingers domain and the RNA template-binding channel. The identification of an interaction of nsp8 with the N-terminal region of nsp12 is supported by a recent study of infectious bronchitis virus, a Gammacoronavirus, where nsp12 a.a. 1-400 was sufficient to interact with nsp8 31 . The head domain of the second nsp8 subunit (a.a. 127-191) resembles the nsp8 head domains of previously determined crystal structures as well as the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer bound to nsp12 discussed above (Fig. 4) . However, the region of the second subunit of nsp8 a.a. 98-126 appears to adopt a conformation unique from those previously observed and involves a refolding of loops and a helical region to participate in interactions with nsp12 and precludes an interaction with nsp7. SARS-CoV nsp7 and nsp8 have been extensively mutated and tested in in vitro polymerase activity assays 7 . Of the three nsp7 mutants previously found to diminish polymerase activity, the lysine of K7A hydrogen bonds to the carbonyls of the nsp7 25-42 helix that interacts with nsp12 and H36A and N37A mutations lie in the nsp7-nsp12 interface. Of the nsp8 residues previously mutated 7 and visible in the structure, four mutants were detrimental to polymerase function. Mutation of nsp8 P183A results in the mutation of a cis-proline residue and may result in an nsp8 folding defect. The three remaining mutated nsp8 residues make important contributions to interactions with nsp12 through the second nsp8 subunit, while these same nsp8 a.a. positions are distal to the observed interaction sites in the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer. nsp8 D99A would disrupt an electrostatic interaction with nsp12 K332. P116 sits in a turn between two nsp8 helices and mutation to an alanine at this position may disrupt the ability of this loop to adopt the unique nsp12-bound conformation. Mutation of nsp8 R190A would disrupt the hydrogen bonding of R190 with carbonyls of nsp8 helix a.a. 116-121, which may destabilize the unique conformation of this In three-dimensional (3D) classification of the SARS nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 complexes, we observed that a portion of the particles appeared to be missing the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Further 3D sorting and refinement of these particles yielded a reconstruction at 3.5-Å resolution, which largely resembles the larger complex ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). However, in addition to missing the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer, this structure also displays a significant amount of disorder in the fingers domain index and ring loops, which play a role in template and NTP binding (Fig. 5) . We hypothesize that the binding of the nsp7-nsp8 heterodimer to the index finger loop stabilizes the polymerase domain to permit template recognition. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that, while nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8 all individually recognize RNA with no or poor affinity, the complex of nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 is significantly more capable of binding RNA 7 .
