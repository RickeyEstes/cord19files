The apparent trend towards decreased human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV during the second half of 2013 may be a reflection of stochasticity rather than a true decrease in R eff Since 2011, there have been over 500 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, and over 140 associated deaths, suggesting a case fatality rate of 28% [32] . The persistent occurrence of small outbreaks is due to zoonotic spillover [33] [34] [35] . MERS-CoV may be a new virus, as the most recent common ancestor of viral samples from infected patients was estimated to have occurred after September 2010 [34] . The novelty of this virus and its high case fatality rate underscore the significance of monitoring the transmission of MERS-CoV. Although human-to-human transmission has been relatively limited so far, with R eff likely less than one, there is concern that future adaptation that could lead to spread similar to sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. Health authorities have prudently instituted a variety of infection control policies and procedures and a trend towards decreasing R eff has been reported [34] . Since verification of the effectiveness of control has important implications, we reconsidered the evidence for a trend towards decreasing R eff . To avoid artifacts of assembling multiple data sources, we restricted our analysis to the previously reported chain size distribution for all MERS-CoV cases in the Arabian Peninsula occurring before August 8, 2013 [34] . Previous analysis of these data shows that R eff is 0.74 (95% CI 0.53-1.03) before June 1, 2013 and 0.32 (95% CI 0.14-0.65) after June 1, 2013. Our results replicate the finding that independent evaluation of cases before and after June 1, 2013 results in an estimate of 0.7 and 0.3 for R eff respectively ( Figure 2 and Table 1 ). When our six models are compared, we do not find statistical support for models with different values of R eff before and after June 1, 2013. This is again consistent with the results of prior studies that determined a pvalue of 0.07 for change in R eff , but our analysis allows the possibility of a high degree of transmission heterogeneity. R eff is significantly different between transmission of measles in the United States (1997) (1998) (1999) and Canada (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) Local elimination of measles is dependent on vaccination programs, and the potential for re-emergence necessitates continued surveillance and re-assessment of vaccination strategy [1, 3, [36] [37] [38] . Even where elimination has been achieved, there can be sporadic clusters of infection due to a combination of geographic importation and pockets of susceptibility [39] [40] [41] . Geographical differences in transmission may arise due to differences in cultural practices, public health guidelines, population density and other factors. Methods that delineate whether differences in R eff are statistically significant for two different regions can therefore help to identify key differences in transmission potential and thus pinpoint opportunities for improved control. Measles data in the United States (1997) (1998) (1999) and Canada (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) are reported according to the size of infection clusters [39, 40] . Most infection clusters have a single primary infection, but even when multiple primary infections exist (as in the case of a cluster with six cases in the United States), the likelihood calculation needed for assessing differences in R eff is straightforward (Supplementary Material, Text S1). When the two data sets are compared, the results indicate that R eff for the United States and Canada are significantly different ( Figure 3 and Table 2 ). Meanwhile, the results also confirm previous studies that infer a A) The results of estimating the effective reproduction number, R eff , for six inter-related models of transmission are shown. The contours show the 95% confidence regions for three models that allow different values of R eff for cases occurring before versus after June 1, 2013. The distinction is that each model makes different assumptions about the degree of transmission heterogeneity (as explained in the text). The black dot shows the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) estimate of the R eff values for these three models. The dashed grey line indicates when R eff does not change with time. The dashed colored lines show the MLE estimate and 95% confidence interval of R eff for the three models that assume transmissibility of cases is independent of time. The slight displacement of the colored lines from the dashed grey line is only for visual clarity. B) The fit of our preferred model to the early MERS-CoV chain size data is shown ( Table 1 ). The error bars of the data correspond to 95% confidence intervals as determined by non-parametric bootstrapping of chain sizes. C) The fit of our preferred model to the late MERS-CoV chain size data is shown. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004452.g002 high degree of transmission heterogeneity in measles transmission [19, 23] . This can be seen from Table 2 since the MLE estimates for k USA and k Canada are less than one and the DAIC value of the model with k USA~kCanada~1 is large. On the other hand, there is negligible statistical support for distinct values of k in the two countries. The type I error for this situation was estimated to be 4.9% by parametric bootstrapping. Significant differences existed between primary and secondary transmission of smallpox in Europe, 1958 Europe, -1973 Smallpox is the only human disease to have been eradicated and thus represents a tremendously successful use of control [12] . During the endgame of smallpox eradication in the middle of the 20th century, smallpox cases in Europe resulted in rapid implementation of quarantine and control procedures. Transmission data for smallpox infections in Europe that occurred during this period provide an opportunity to investigate how control interventions impacted the transmissibility of primary cases caused by geographic importation relative to secondary cases resulting from local transmission [12] . Smallpox clusters were tabulated according to the number of cases in each generation of spread [12] . The inference results indicate that secondary cases transmitted significantly less than primary cases (seen by the lack of overlap of contours with the grey line in Figure 4 and by the statistical selection of the non-restricted model in Table 3 ). In fact, the effectiveness of control procedures can be quantified by looking at the ratio of reproduction numbers for primary and secondary transmission (Figure 4 inset). The ratio of the maximum likelihood values for R seconday to R primary suggests that control reduced R eff by 75%. Meanwhile, for both primary and secondary transmission, a high degree of transmission heterogeneity is evident (since the MLE estimates of k primary and k seconday are substantially less than one and the DAIC value of the k USA~kCanada~1 model is large). Based on selection of the unrestricted model, and the associated estimates of k, there appears to be significantly more heterogeneity of disease transmission for secondary cases than for primary cases. The type I error for this analysis was estimated to be 5.1% by parametric bootstrapping.
