We modelled 388 287 passengers travelling to 1297 airports in 168 countries or territories. The risk index of 2019-nCoV for these countries is presented in Figure 1 . A regularly updated risk map is hosted on PANDORA's website ( https://ncovdata.io/import/). Outside China, the countries with the highest risk of 2019-nCoV transmission from our model were Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which have reported at least one case. Among the top 25 countries identified with the highest risk of 2019-nCoV transmission (Fig. 2) , all countries except four (Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan and Qatar) have detected at least one case as of 5 February 2020 (Table 1) . According to our risk score classification, of the countries that reported at least one 2019-nCoV case as of 5 February 2020, 24 countries were in the 4 th quantile of the risk index, two (Sweden and Belgium) in the 3 rd quantile, one (Nepal) in the 2 nd quantile and none in the 1 st quantile [14] . Asian and European countries are dominant in the 3 rd and 4 th quantile (high-risk index) while African and South American Countries are the majority in the 1 st and 2 nd quantiles (low-risk index) ( Table 1) . Out of 43 countries in the 4 th quantile, 22 were from Asia and 13 from Pan-Europe, whereas in the 1 st quantile, 19 out of 42 countries were from Africa ( Table 1) . The overall risk of transmission of the virus into Africa is low. However, Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt and Mauritius have a The correlation coefficient between the estimated risk index of the countries and the WHO-reported confirmed cases was 0.97.
