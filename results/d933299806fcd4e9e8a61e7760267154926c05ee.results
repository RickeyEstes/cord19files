In total, 144,066 notifications of 28 different infectious diseases were included: 50,541 in period 1, 47,163 in period 2 and 46,362 in period 3. Numbers of included notifications per disease per period, numbers of cases for which delays could be calculated, median disease identification delay D1X, notification delay D3 and reporting delay D6, per disease and for all cases are displayed for each period in Table 1 . For all three delays, the medians for all cases together decreased over time (D1X from 29 to 23 days, D3 from 2 to 0 days, D6 from 1 to 0 days). The mathematical averages of median delays of all individual diseases decreased as well, but to a lesser extent (Table 1) . The disease identification delay was the longest delay and showed most variation between diseases, with medians ranging between 2 days (meningococcosis in period 1 and tetanus in period 2) and 55 days (brucellosis in period 3). The distribution of this delay per disease for period 3 is shown in Figure 2 . The median notification delay decreased in period 2 for most diseases (10/18, with 4/10 statistically significant), see The median reporting delays also showed a clear decrease in period 2 (medians of 7/19 diseases decreased, 6/7 statistically significantly). Malaria, psittacosis and pertussis, for which the legal timeframe for reporting to the RIVM was adjusted, were reported significantly faster (p < 0,05), see Table 1 . For the other diseases, the reporting delay did not decrease. In period 3, no further decrease in median delays was observed. When displayed per year, a gradual shortening was observed for the notification delay from the beginning of the study period (July 2003) until 2012. For the reporting delay, the main decrease was in 2009, the year following the new law ( Figure 3 ).
