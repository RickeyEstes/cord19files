DNA quantitation in the digital array is based on the partitioning of a PCR reaction into an array of several hundreds or even few thousands of chambers or wells. One panel of the digital array consists of 765 chambers and one can use up to 12 panels at a time. If the concentration of the target molecules is low in the DNA sample, most of the chambers capture either one or no molecules and the number of positive chambers at the end point of the PCR yields close approximation to the true concentration of the target. However, if the number of molecules is large, then there is greater probability of several molecules being in the same chamber, and therefore the number of positive chambers would be significantly lower compared with the number of molecules in the chambers. We are interested in estimating the true concentration of the molecules in the DNA sample from which we extracted 6 nl6765 = 4.59 ml of sample for each panel. Consider the universe of infinite number of the digital array chambers filled with an infinite amount of the DNA sample where the true concentration of the target molecules is l per chamber (per 6 nl). The true concentration is an unknown population parameter of this infinite DNA sample. If a chamber gets no molecule then it constitutes failure in the sense of Bernoulli experiment. If it gets one or more molecules, that is, if it gets a ''hit'' and is therefore positive, then it constitutes success. Let the probability of success be p. Note that p is an unknown population parameter. We will use the standard hat notation to denote sample estimators of population parameters. For example, p andl l will denote the estimators of p and l, respectively.
