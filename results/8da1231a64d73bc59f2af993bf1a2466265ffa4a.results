Detection of TBTV, TVDV and TBTD-associated RNA in different sources of tobacco with tobacco bushy top disease Total RNA was extracted from leaves of tobacco with suspected tobacco bushy top disease collected from three locations (JiangChuan county, MiDu county and BaoShan city) in China's Yunnan Province. RT-PCR and subsequent sequencing revealed that TBTV was present only in the samples from JiangChuan and MiDu. None of the samples contained the newly reported TBTDaRNA (Additional file 1: Table S1 ).
