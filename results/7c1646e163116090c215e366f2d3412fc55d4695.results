Production and characterization of monoclonat antibodies to JHM-DL virus Twenty-three cloned hybridomas produced antiviral antibodies as determined by RIA . The specificity of each antibody was determined by precipitation of JHMV-DL proteins from a lysate of infected cells . Figure 1 shows examples of the immunop r e c i p i t a t e s a n a l y z e d o n s i x 1 5 % g r a d i e n t polyacrylamide gels . Lysates harvested late in infection contained various quantities of the degradation products of the nucleocapsid protein (lanes 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 in Fig. 1 and lanes 6 and 8 in Fig. 5 ) . In addition, a few monoclonal antibodies immunoprecipitated other weak protein bands (see lane 13 in Fig . 1 and lane 11 in Fig. 5 ) which could be eliminated by increasing the SDS to 0. 5 % i n t h e r e a c t i o n mixture . Based on the data obtained by immunoprecipitation, the 23 monoclonal antibodies were placed in three groups . Table 1 shows. that 10 antibodies reacted with the major glycoprotein, gpISO/90, 10 reacted with the nucleocapsid protein, pp6O, and 3 reacted with the minor envelope glycoprotein gp25 . All the antibodies were tested for their ability to neutralize JHMV-DL . Six of the ten that reacted with gp18O/90 neutralized JHMV-DL . None of the antibodies reactive with either pp6O or gp25 were able to neutralize JHMV-DL (Table 1 ) . The heavy-chain immunoglobulin isotype of each antibody was tested by immunodiffusion . All the antibodies reacted with only a single anti-isotype antiserum. The isotypes for each monoclonal antibody are shown in Table 1 . Reactivities of antibodies with nucleocapsid protein pp60. Ten monoclonal antibodies reactive with the nucleocapsid protein of JHMV-DL, pp6O, were used to examine the antigenic conservation of this protein in MIIV strains that induce diverse types of disease. Antigenic preservation was determined in an RIA which tested the 10 antibodies with different MHV strains serving as antigens . Table 2 shows an example of this type of experiment . Anti-pp60 antibodies were tested for their ability to bind to the homologous antigen (JHMV-DL), the small-plaque variant of this virus (JHMV-DS), and a related murine coronavirus (MHV-A59), as well as control antigens (HSV-1, VSV) . Table 2 s h o w s b i n d i n g o f a t l e a s t 2 5 % o f t h e v a l u e s for homologous virus in 6 of 10 reactions of anti-pp60 antibodies with MHV-A59 and none of 10 with JHMV-DS . Since viral antigens were used in excess and binding of antibodies to the glycoproteins of JHMV-DS was equal to the binding to the glycoproteins of homologous virus (see below), we do not attribute the very low binding of antibodies to JHMV-DS nucleocapsid protein, pp6O, to limited antigenic density of the viral preparation. Anti-pp6O monoclonal antibodies did not react with control viral antigens, and control monoclonal antibody did not react with MHV antigens . The relative binding of antibodies to different MHV strains in a larger series of experiments was used to construct the block diagram presented in Fig . 2 . The pattern of reactivities indicates a moderate degree of antigenic conservation of ppGO among MHV strains . By inspection, the viruses tested could be divided into two broad groups based on their reactivities . The first group consisted of A59, MHV-3, MHV-D, MHV-K, and MHV-Nuu viruses, all of which did not react with monoclonal antibodies J.1.1, J .3.14, J.3.7, and J .3.15 . The antigenic sites recognized by these antibodies are apparently conserved in the second group, composed of MHV-2, MHV-S, and MHV-1 viruses . In addition to these two groups, two individual viruses, JHMV-DS and MHV-M, were notable for their l a c k o f m a r k e d b i n d i n g ( l e s s t h a n 2 5 % r p m versus homologous virus) with any of the 10 anti-pp60 monoclonal antibodies tested . Reactivities of antibodies with major glycoprotein 180/90. The major virion envelope glycoprotein, gplSO/90, is capable of a number of functions, including recognition of the host cell receptor (Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . It was therefore of interest to investigate the antigenic relationships of gp18O/90 in a number of different MHV strains which produce a variety of diseases. All monoclonal antibodies recognized antigenic determinants of the small plaque variant JHMV-DS equally well as the immunogen, JHMV-DL, indicating the close antigenic relationship of 'Monoclonal antibodies were obtained from hybridoma tissue culture supernatants. Antigen specificity was determined by RIP, neutralizing titer by microassay, and immunoglobulin isotype by immunodiffusion as described under Materials and Methods .Â° Symbol (-) indicates no neutralization at 1 :4 dilution . these two viruses (Fig . 3) . By contrast, very few of the antigenic determinants on the other MHVs were closely related to those of JHMV-DL, indicating the lack of conservation of JHMV major glycoprotein antigens among the rest of the MHV strains . Several antibodies, such as J.1.2, J .7.18, J.2.2, and J .7.2, recognize only JHMV variants DL and DS and thus may appear to have identical specificities. Nevertheless, differences in fine specificity were demonstrated in further experiments . We first isolated variant JHM viruses which escaped neutralization by monoclonal antibodies . When these variant viruses were used as antigens, each of the 10 anti-gp180/ 90 monoclonal antibodies in our panel showed a distinctive pattern of reactivity to them, indicating each antibody in this set recognized a unique antigenic determinant (Fleming, unpublished observations) . Reactivity of antibodies with minor glycoprotein gp25. The smaller viral glycoprotein, gp25, is embedded within and extends through the viral envelope . It has been suggested that it may function as a matrix protein and is essential in viral budding and in the formation of the viral envelope (Holmes et aL, 1982) . Three monoclonal antibodies were obtained which are specific for gp25 . This protein appears to be highly conserved among the MHV strains (Fig . 4) . Nevertheless, this finding must be regarded as tentative, in view of the small numbers of available antibodies with specificity for gp25 . Cross immunoprecipitations. To confirm the pattern of antibody binding determined by RIA, anti-JHMV-DL monoclonal antibodies were tested for their ability to im munoprecipitate the appropriate viral protein from a lysate of cells infected with the related MHV, A59. Figure 5 shows that those anti-JHMV-DL antibodies (J.7.5, J.2.1, J .1 .3, and J .2.7) which react with A59 by RIA were also able to immunoprecipitate the appropriate A59-specified protein, indicating that the shared antigens detected by RIA were in fact on the analogous protein . By contrast, those antibodies that were unreactive with A59 virus by RIA (J.2.5, J1.2, J .3.7, and J.1.1) did not immunoprecipitate detectable radiolabeled A59 virus proteins . Taken together, the immunoprecipitation data confirm the specificities of the anti-JHMV-DL antibodies as determined by RIA .
