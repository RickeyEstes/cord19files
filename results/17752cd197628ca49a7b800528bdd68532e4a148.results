The endodomain of the SARS-CoV S protein binds to the F1 lobe of the FERM domain of ezrin in yeast We hypothesized that cellular proteins may interact with the carboxy-terminal endodomain of the S envelope protein and either help or restrict processes involving S. To identify such cellular factors, we performed a genomic yeast two-hybrid screen using the SARS-CoV S endodomain as bait ( Fig. 1A-B) . A random-primed cDNA library from human placenta was screened and 233 positive clones were identified. The most prominent result of the screen was the identification of the interaction between S endodomain and the cellular protein ezrin (Fig. 1A , C) with a total of 82 positive clones (35%) corresponding to this protein (Accession number: NM_003379; Fig. 1C ). The S -ezrin interaction was classified with high confidence score (Predicted Biological Score = A; Fig. 1A ) and was not found in parallel screens performed with other viral baits [33, 34] and data not shown). These data indicate that ezrin specifically interacts with SARS-CoV S endodomain in yeast. To determine the binding region of ezrin to S endodomain, the 82 ezrin cDNA sequences were aligned using ClustalW multiple sequence alignment program. All ezrin cDNA shared a common sequence of 264 base pairs corresponding to amino acids 6 to 93 (Fig. 1C) . Interestingly, this region corresponds almost completely to the F1 lobe of the N-terminal FERM domain (amino acids 2 to 82 [35] , Fig. 1C and 1D ). This suggests that interaction of ezrin with S endodomain requires a complete F1 lobe. This region was subsequently named ezrin F1/S Binding Domain or F1/SBD (Fig. 1C ).
