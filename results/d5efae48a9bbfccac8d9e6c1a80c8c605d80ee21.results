To determine which viral glycoproteins are sensitive to the antiviral activity of SERINC5 we assessed infectivity of pseudotyped GFP-expressing lentiviral vectors produced in the presence or absence of SERINC5. Included in this panel was a diverse selection of retroviral Env glycoproteins, including those from human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), avian leukosis Similar to the findings of others (17, 18, 24) , we observed that SERINC5 causes a greater than 100-fold reduction in viral infectivity for HIV-1 and A-MLV pseudotypes, while no significant reduction was observed for EBOV and VSV pseudotypes ( Fig. 1A and Table 1 ). Interestingly, we observed >10-fold reduction of infectivity of H7/N1 influenza and RABV pseudotypes. No other pseudotypes displayed >10-fold reduced infectivity with SERINC5. These observations indicate that restriction by SERINC5 is not dictated by how the viral glycoprotein mediates fusion, as fusion mediated by influenza (27) or by RABV (28) occurs in a pH-dependent fashion in the endo-lysosomal compartment, while HIV-1-(29, 30), A-MLV-, M-PMV-and HTLV-1-mediated (31) fusion occurs in a pH-independent manner. Next we tested a panel of filoviral glycoproteins for sensitivity to SERINC5 restriction. All of these glycoproteins require proteolytic processing (32, 33) following internalization into the target cell and utilize the lysosomal protein NPC1 to initiate viral fusion (34, 35). In addition to the EBOV and MARV glycoproteins tested in Fig 1A, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/780577 doi: bioRxiv preprint shown in Fig. 1B , none of the filoviral glycoproteins were inhibited >10-fold in the presence of SERINC5. However, there may be modest differences in sensitivity to SERINC5 activity, specifically RESTV and TAFV GP appear slightly more sensitive (4.3-and 2.9-fold, respectively) to SERINC5 inhibition compared to either Mayinga or Makona Ebola virus glycoproteins (1.65-and 1.2-fold, respectively). HIV-1 Nef, MLV glygoGag, and EIAV S2 counteract SERINC5 antiviral activity by removing SERINC5 protein from the cell surface and relocalizing it to an endosomal compartment (17, 18, 22) . The ability of a viral glycoprotein to re-localize a normally plasma membrane localized antiviral protein has been previously shown for HIV-2 Env and human BST2 (38). Thus, we reasoned that viral glycoproteins may confer resistance to SERINC5 activity by re-localizing SERINC5 to an internal membrane compartment. To test this, we compared SERINC5 incorporation into HIV-1 virus-like particles (VLPs) pseudotyped with the various glycoproteins shown in Fig 1A. We found that HIV-1 VLPs universally incorporated SERINC5 irrespective of the viral glycoprotein present ( Figure 2 ). In replicate blotting, only HERV-K Env showed a consistently lower level of SERINC5 incorporation into viral particles (data not shown). However, this observation is likely to be caused by pleiotropic effects of cells transfected with this glycoprotein, as cell growth was significantly reduced compared to other transfections, and reduced levels of Gag and GFP were also observed ( Fig. 2 , data not shown). Regardless, no direct correlation between SERINC5 exclusion from virions and resistance to its antiviral effects was evident. A previous report indicated that MLV virions pseudotyped with RD114 Env are susceptible to the antiviral effects of SERINC5 (24). However, in the presence of SERINC5 we only observed a modest ~4.5-fold reduction in viral titer of RD114 pseudotyped HIV-1 virions ( Fig. 1A) . In response to this discrepancy, we sought to determine if the viral core modulates susceptibility to SERINC5 antiviral activity. Thus, we tested the same panel of glycoproteins for SERINC5 sensitivity when pseudotyped on different virion cores. First, we tested the SERINC5 sensitivity of the same panel of glycoproteins as in Fig. 1A on MLV viral cores ( Figure 3A and Table 1 ). We observed that the glycoproteins sensitive to SERINC5 restriction on HIV-1 cores (HIV-1, A-MLV, Flu, and Rabies) were also restricted when pseudotyped on MLV cores. Additionally, we observed that M-PMV Env was sensitive to SERINC restriction when pseudotyped onto MLV cores, whereas it was not when pseudotyped onto HIV-1 cores. .

(24). Due to observed differences in SERINC5 sensitivity with M-PMV pseudotypes of HIV-1 and MLV cores, we next tested for SERINC5 antiviral activity against our panel of glycoproteins pseudotyped onto M-PMV cores ( Figure 3B and Table 1 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/780577 doi: bioRxiv preprint DISCUSSION Initial reports indicated that the viral glycoprotein is a determinant of sensitivity to SERINC5 antiviral activity (17, 18, 25, 26) and suggested that viral glycoproteins which mediate fusion via a pH-dependent, endocytic entry pathway are resistant to SERINC5 antiviral activity (17, 24) . Here, to examine these issues further, pseudotypes using glycoproteins from diverse families of enveloped viruses were assessed for sensitivity to restriction by SERINC5. We observed that SERINC5 restricted virions pseudotyped with glycoproteins from several retroviruses (HIV-1, A-MLV, RD114, and M-PMV), influenza A (Orthomyxoviridae), and rabies (Rhabdoviridae). To our knowledge, this is the first time antiviral activity of SERINC5 has been described for a non-retroviral glycoprotein. As the glycoproteins of these viruses were studied as retroviral pseudotypes, it remains to be established if the infectivity of authentic influenza or rabies viruses are affected by SERINC5, or other SERINC family members. Additionally, our observation with influenza A and rabies glycoproteins demonstrates that mediating entry via an endocytic route does not, in itself, protect from the antiviral effects of SERINC5. While Env glycoproteins from the retroviruses HIV-1, MLV, and RD114 have all previously been found to be inhibited by SERINC5 (17, 18) , we now report that M-PMV glycoprotein is SERINC5-sensitive as well. Interestingly, we saw a ~100-fold reduction in infectivity of autologously pseudotyped M-PMV cores when produced in the presence of SERINC5. This observation was unexpected given that lenti-and gammaretroviruses encode accessory factors that counteract SERINC5 activity. And yet, functionally intact M-PMV (the only viral gene known to be missing from the GFP-expressing M-PMV vector is Env, which is complemented in trans during the transfection) was sensitive to the antiviral effects of human SERINC5. Surprisingly, we observed that particular glycoproteins displayed different sensitivity to the antiviral effects of SERINC5 depending on the viral core onto which they were pseudotyped.

A previous report demonstrated similar magnitude inhibition for RD114-pseudotyped MLV by endogenous SERINC activity (24). Regardless, RD114 showed little sensitivity to SERINC5 when pseudotyped onto HIV-1 cores. Neutralization by monoclonal antibodies that target the membrane-proximal domain of HIV-1 glycoprotein is altered by the presence of SERINC5 (19, 25) . Given that MA, the membrane proximal domain of gag makes contacts with the retroviral TM (40, 41), one can imagine that SERINC5 has the potential to influence interactions between MA and TM in the HIV-1 virion that are essential for infectivity. In similar fashion, SERINC5 might influence retroviral core interactions by the heterologous glycoproteins tested here, for which SERINC5 restriction activity was core-dependent, i.e., the rabies virus, MPMV, and RD114 glycoproteins.
