BtNoV is antigenically similar to HuNoVs. We first sought to identify if BtNoV maintained any antigenic similarity with noroviruses, specifically HuNoVs. Thus, we produced BtNoV VLPs using alphavirus replicon vectors in BHK cells. The BtNoV capsid sequence formed VLPs of approximately 40 nm in diameter that resembled VLPs generated from genotype II 4.1997.Lordsdale (GII.4.1997.Lordsdale) HuNoV (Fig. 1A) . To As anticipated, hyperimmune GI and GII.4 HuNoV-derived serums strongly reacted with their homotypic VLPs (Fig. 1B) (Fig. 1C) . Interestingly, BtNoV VLPs reacted with both GI and GII.4 serums similarly to the VLPs derived from heterotypic HuNoVs (Fig. 1B) . The BtNoV VLPs required significantly higher levels of GI (EC 50 of 1/340.4) and GII.4 (EC 50 of 1/694.4) serums than the homotypic VLPs for detection by EIA. It is noteworthy that the BtNoV and GII.4.Sydney.2012 VLPs had almost identical EC 50 s for binding GI HuNoV-derived serums. BtNoV binds histo-blood group antigens similarly to a historic HuNoV. Since we had established that BtNoV VLPs are antigenically similar to HuNoV-derived VLPs and since host receptor ligand differences are among the primary barriers to calicivirus cross-species transmission, we next sought to identify whether BtNoV VLPs could bind histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) in vitro. Additionally, as bats are heterothermic, their body temperatures fluctuate from ambient temperature during torpor to 37°C during their active state (54, 55) . Further, temperature changes have been shown to induce conformational changes in the HuNoV capsid, altering the presentation of antigenic epitopes (56) . Thus, we hypothesized that temperature changes would impact these potential VLP-carbohydrate ligand binding interactions (Fig. 2) . To address these issues, we utilized an in vitro synthetic HBGA carbohydrate binding assay and incubated the BtNoV VLPs in comparison with GII.4.Lordsdale.1997 HuNoV VLPs at a gradient of temperatures that capture a range of physiological temperatures identified in bats: 25°C, 32°C, and 37°C. As we hypothesized, BtNoV VLPs bound to HBGAs and their carbohydrate binding interactions were impacted by temperature in a manner similar to that seen with HuNoVs (Fig. 2) . Specifically, GII.4.Lordsdale.1997 VLPs bound significantly better to A type HBGA at 32°C and 37°C and ␣-2,6-sialic acid at 37°C. A similar trend, though the data were not statistically significant, was observed with these VLPs with respect to H type 1 HBGAs. Similarly, the BtNoV VLPs bound significantly better to H type 1 and A at 37°C and ␣-2,6-sialic acid at 32°C and 37°C. We noted no trends with respect to correlations between incubation temperature and the binding of either VLP to H type 3 or B HBGAs, though BtNoV VLPs did not bind to these HBGAs as well as HuNoVderived VLPs. These results indicate that the temperature may induce conformational changes within the BtNoV capsid similarly to HuNoVs (56) , that the transmission of these bat viruses may depend on the activity level and body temperature of bats, and that bats may carry or transmit HBGA-binding viruses under a gradient of physiological conditions. The A10 bat calicivirus is phylogenetically related to ؆recoviruses.؆ We next hypothesized that other caliciviruses are circulating in bats and, similarly to our observations with BtNoV, would be capable of binding HBGAs in vitro. In a previous report, we identified multiple viral sequences from Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Iflaviridae insect viruses, Tymoviridae plant viruses, and Podoviridae bacteriophage in several species of bats near an abandoned railway tunnel (Indigo Tunnel) in Allegany County, MD, USA, approximately 1 mi east of Little Orleans, MD ( Fig. 3A ) (52) . Additionally, we assembled two contigs of 865 nucleotides and 534 nucleotides from 232 and 3 sequence reads from the guano of Perimyotis subflavus, the tri-colored bat. A BLAST search showed that the assembled contigs most closely matched the capsid FIG 3 Identification of a novel North American bat viral sequence that is phylogenetically related to Caliciviridae. We identified a sequence from Perimyotis subflavus that was related to Caliciviridae capsid sequences. (A) The distribution of P. subflavus throughout North America and Central America is marked in red. The sampling site of Little Orleans, MD, is marked by a star (inset). The map was generated using data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with permission. (B and C) A maximum-likelihood cladogram (B) and radial phylograms (C) of 51 known calicivirus S domain amino acid sequences were generated based on the JTT matrix-based amino acid substitution model (SB) and the Jukes-Cantor genetic distance model (SC). BtNoV and BtCalV/A10 are indicated by yellow and blue arrows, respectively. Bat Caliciviruses Bind Histo-Blood Group Antigens ® sequences of GII HuNoVs and feline calicivirus, indicating the identification of a 510-amino-acid capsid sequence (GenBank accession number MH259583) of a bat calicivirus, BtCalV/A10/USA/2009 (here referred to as A10 bat calicivirus [BtCalV/A10]). It is noteworthy that we did not identify similar calicivirus sequences from the other sampled bat species. To identify how BtCalV/A10 and BtNoV are related to known Caliciviridae capsid sequences, we analyzed the amino acid sequences of the conserved shell (S) domain of the capsid protein due to the extensive variability within the protruding domain of the VP1 capsid protein (57, 58) . We generated S domain phylogenetic trees and cladograms from 51 known calicivirus S domain sequences ( Fig. 3B and C) . First, we noted that BtNoV and BtCalV/A10 clustered in separate clades. BtCalV/A10 was directly rooted by the nonhuman primate ЉrecovirusesЉ and further rooted a clade containing lagoviruses, human and animal sapoviruses, vesiviruses, and neboviruses. Based on this analysis, BtCalV/A10 is most closely related to rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) and the ЉrecovirusesЉ but likely belongs to a novel genus within Caliciviridae. Conversely, BtNoV clustered with murine norovirus (MNV) and rooted a clade of viruses that included BtCalV/A10, the animal caliciviruses, and GI and GIII noroviruses. While BtCalV/A10 clustered most closely with RHDV and next most closely with the Љrecoviruses,Љ it maintained only 22% sequence identity and 19% to 22% sequence identity with those viruses, respectively (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Conversely, BtNoV maintained 60% amino acid sequence identity with its closest relative, MNV, and only 23% similarity with BtCalV/A10. Similar phylogenetic relationships were observed in VP1 analysis (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Taken together, our phylogenetic results suggest that BtCalV/A10 most likely represents a genus and species distinct from all of the previously identified caliciviruses; in contrast, based on accepted norovirus classifications (59) , BtNoV likely belongs to genogroup V (GV) with MNV. Homology modeling of BtCalV/A10 and BtNoV using HuNoVs and MNV. Previous works have solved the capsid and P domain structures of several caliciviruses (60, 61) . To determine how the BtCalV/A10 and BtNoV capsids structurally compare to known human and animal norovirus capsids, we utilized predictive structural modeling to illustrate the full-length BtCalV/A10 and BtNoV capsid structures. First, we used PHYRE2 open source software to determine if BtCalV/A10 contained known calicivirus capsid structures followed by structural homology modeling using Modeller software from the Max Planck Institute Bioinformatics Toolkit (62) (63) (64) . Due to its low amino acid similarity to known calicivirus sequences, we also modeled the BtCalV/A10 sequence using HuNoVs (PDB identifiers [IDs]: 2OBT and 4WZT) and MNV (PDB ID: 3LQE) as backbones to capture multiple potential structures and predict potential sites of HBGA binding (see Fig. 5 ). As expected, the PHYRE2 software predicted the structure of several calicivirus full-length capsids, including GII.4.1997.Lordsdale HuNoV, MNV, GI.1 human sapovirus, and BtNoV (Fig. 4A) , supporting the use of PHYRE2 software for predictive homology modeling. These models folded into distinct structures similar to previously reported calicivirus structures (Fig. 4A) , including ␤-sheets in the S domain and P2 subdomains (46) . Conversely, PHYRE2 determined that the BtCalV/A10 capsid formed distinct S and P2 subdomains similar to those of other caliciviruses but contained extensive disorder and unpredictability within the P1 subdomain, which corresponds with the capsid sequence size of BtCalV/A10 being smaller than that seen with other caliciviruses. While the predicted BtCalV/A10 structure contained ␤-sheets in the S domain similar to those seen with the other calicivirus structures (Fig. 4A) , we also observed several ␣-helices within the P2 subdomain rather than the ␤-sheets observed in known calicivirus structures. The predictive modeling by PHYRE2 suggested two conclusions: the presence of ␤-sheets in the S domain suggested that the BtCalV/A10 capsid sequence resembled a calicivirus capsid sequence, but the unrecognized structures in P1 and ␣-helices in P2 suggested that BtCalV/A10 contained novel structures dissimilar from the structures in other caliciviruses, further supporting its tentative placement as a novel genus within Caliciviridae. As the PHYRE2 modeling software did not fully predict the structure of the BtCalV/ A10 capsid protein, we next modeled the BtCalV/A10 and BtNoV P dimers from the most closely related animal norovirus, MNV (Fig. 4B to D) . Alignment of the P domains revealed that the BtCalV/A10 sequence had four insertions within the P domain compared to the MNV P domain template; similarly, the BtNoV sequence contained three insertions and three deletions compared to MNV (data not shown). However, as expected, the homologous models for both BtCalV/A10 (Fig. 4C) and BtNoV (Fig. 4D ) resembled the MNV P domain backbone (Fig. 4B) . We also modeled the BtCalV/A10 and BtNoV P dimers on the backbone of two GII.4 HuNoVs (Fig. 4E to G) . Compared to the HuNoV sequences, the BtCalV/A10 P domain sequence had six insertions and four deletions, while the BtNoV P domain sequence had three insertions and five deletions (data not shown). These modifications did not affect modeling of the P dimers from HuNoVs for either of the bat virus sequences. The BtCalV/A10 dimer (Fig. 4F) and BtNoV dimer (Fig. 4G ) each resembled the P dimers of their HuNoV counterparts (Fig. 4E) . Additionally, the open source software 3DLigand-Site (65) indicated that the models retained ligand binding sites (red) for type A HBGAs (white spheres) similar to those seen with the GII.4 HuNoV backbone. BtCalV/A10 and BtNoV have different HBGA carbohydrate binding profiles, but both resemble HuNoV with respect to binding patterns. As we had shown that BtNoV VLPs could bind HBGAs (Fig. 2) , we sought to identify whether the phylogenetically unrelated BtCalV/A10 shared similar host receptor ligand binding interactions. and BtNoV (Fig. 5A) . Among the HuNoVs, GI.1.Norwalk.1968 VLPs primarily bound H type 3 and A antigens but weakly bound the H type 1 and B antigens and ␣-2,6-sialic acid. Conversely, GII.4.Lordsdale.1997 VLPs strongly bound H type 3, A, and B and ␣-2,6-sialic acid, with limited binding to H type 1. GII.4.Sydney.2012 VLPs displayed weak binding to all carbohydrates but bound most strongly to the A antigen. BtCalV/A10 VLPs bound strongly to A, B, and H type 3 HBGA carbohydrates but bound weakly to H type 1 and ␣-2,6-sialic acid. Of note, BtCalV/A10 VLPs bound strongly to the H type 3 and A HBGAs at a magnitude similar to that seen with the GII.4.Lordsdale.1997 HuNoV VLPs. Conversely, the BtNoV VLPs again bound to ␣-2,6-sialic acid but displayed modest binding to the H type 1 and H type 3, A, and B HBGA carbohydrates, as we showed previously (Fig. 2) . Each VLP in our panel displayed limited or weak binding to H type 2 antigen, Lewis antigens, or ␣-2,3-sialic acid (data not shown). The bat caliciviruses exhibited different binding patterns: the BtCalV/A10 VLPs strongly bound H type 3, A, and B antigens, with limited binding to H type 1 and ␣-2,6-sialic acids, while the BtNoV VLPs strongly bound ␣-2,6-sialic acid, with moderate binding to H type 1 and H type 3, A, and B HBGAs, suggesting that bat caliciviruses can bind to a range of host receptors and offer multiple routes for cross-species transmission. Both of these binding patterns overlapped binding patterns that were previously reported for other animal caliciviruses and HuNoVs (Fig. 5B ). Our results, coupled with those previous reports, suggest that multiple routes of cross-species transmission exist among caliciviruses.
