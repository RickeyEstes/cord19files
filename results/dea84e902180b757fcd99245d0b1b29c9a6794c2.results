A total of 150 clinical samples were included in this study to validate the MinElute kit in comparison to either the Iso-Quick (DNA detection) or RNAzol B (RNA detection) kit. Human ␤-actin DNA or RNA was detected in all nucleic acid specimens extracted by either MinElute or IsoQuick/RNAzol B kit, indicating these nucleic acid extracts were free of amplification inhibitors. All 101 NPS RNA specimens, which were extracted by the MinElute and RNAzol B, were tested for influenza A virus by RT-PCR-EIA. There was a 99% agreement between the MinElute and RNAzol B when influenza A virus was detected; one was detected in the MinElute but not the RNAzol B-extracted RNA (Table 1) . Twenty CSF samples were extracted by using the MinElute and RNAzol B in parallel, and tested for enteroviruses by RT-PCR-EIA. There was 100% agreement among all 20 samples between the two extraction methods (Table 1) . Twenty-nine CSF samples were extracted by using the MinElute and IsoQuick in parallel, and tested for HSV, EBV or VZV by PCR-EIA. There was 100% agreement again between the two extraction methods for herpesvirus detection. These results suggested that the MinElute possesses a similar sensitivity as with the IsoQuick/RNAzol B for both DNA and RNA virus detection. An analytical sensitivity of extraction kits was evaluated by extracting 10 CSF samples in parallel using the MinElute and IsoQuick/RNAzol B. Nucleic acid extracts were serially diluted and tested for RNA (enterovirus and influenza A virus) and DNA (HSV, EBV and VZV) by RT-PCR-EIA and PCR-EIA (Fig. 1 ). These extractions were tested at a Mean ± S.D. (recovery percentage) from triplicate runs. There were no statistical differences in recovery rates between MinElute and Iso-Quick/RNAzol B for both HIV-1 and CMV quantitation (p > 0.05). concentrations of undiluted, 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000. When RNA extraction methods (MinElute versus RNAzol B) were compared, the MinElute produced significantly larger optical density (OD) values than the RNAzol B (p < 0.001). Samples extracted by the MinElute tested positive to the 1:1000 dilution while those extracted by the RNAzol were only positive in the undiluted concentrations. The OD values were similar when DNA extraction methods were compared between the MinElute and IsoQuick (p > 0.05). Both extraction methods produced positive results to the 1:1000 dilutions. These data indicated that while both IsoQuick and MinElute yielded similar amounts of DNA, the MinElute might yield higher quantities of RNA than RNAzol. Nucleic acid recovery rates between the MinElute and RNAzol B were further determined by quantitating HIV-1 or CMV viral loads in extracted RNA or DNA specimens using a real-time TaqMan PCR. The samples were run in triplicate along with an unextracted control sample and the recovery rate was calculated by comparing the viral loads in the control. The MinElute and IsoQuick had recovery rates for CMV DNA of 74.3% and 66.9% and the MinElute and RNAzol B had recovery rates for HIV-1 RNA of 20.3% and 15.2% (Table 2) . While the DNA recovery rate was higher than the RNA for both extraction methods, there were no statistical differences in recovery rates between MinElute and IsoQuick/RNAzol B for both HIV-1 and CMV quantitation (p > 0.05). These data indicated that MinElute possesses a similar organism-specific nucleic acid recovery rate in comparison to the IsoQuick for DNA and the RNAzol B for RNA. Cost per test was calculated for each extraction kit, which included test kit and additional materials and reagents used for nucleic acid extraction. The cost per test was US$ 2.86 for the IsoQuick, which was cheaper than the costs of the (Table 3) .
