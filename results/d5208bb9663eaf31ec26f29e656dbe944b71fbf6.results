The crude means and standard errors (SE) for the I-, E-, and K-scores by institutions and disciplines are shown in Table 1 . There were significant differences in the mean values of the three scores among institutions and disciplines (P < 0.001 to P = 0.005 for each of the three items). The range of each crude score was wider across institutions (−0. 16 Overall, there were statistically significant differences in the mean values of each of these three scores across institutions (P < 0.001) and disciplines (P < 0.001 to P = 0.005). When we categorized the mean I-scores for the seven institutions into quartiles, we found that A was in the lowest quartile; B and C were in the lower-middle quartile; D, E, and F were in the upper-middle quartile; and G was in the highest quartile, with a 0.66-point difference from institution A (−0.17) to institution G (0.49; Table 2 ). Similarly, when we categorized the four disciplines, we found that "others" and "surgical" were in the lower-middle quartile, while "medical" and "ER/ICU" were in upper-middle quartile, with a 0.18-point difference between others (−0.03) and medical (0.15). Thus, in effect, the difference in mean I-score was larger and more significant across institutions than across disciplines. In addition, pairwise comparisons showed that institution G had a higher mean I-score than the other institutions, and that, across disciplines, "medical" and "ER/ICU" had the highest mean I-scores and "others" had a particularly low mean I-score (Table 2  and Table 5 ) Numbers in parentheses show ranks adjusted for equal ranks a Ranks are based on the values of the I-, E-, and K-scores shown in Tables 2-4 b Based on the rank sum Table 2 also shows the differences across institutions according to each discipline, when institutions and disciplines were combined. For the "ER/ICU" discipline, the mean scores differed by 0.87 points across institutions, from −0.29 for institution A to 0.59 for institution G. For the "surgical" discipline, the mean scores differed by 0.66 points across institutions, from −0.16 for institution B to 0.50 for institution G. The difference across institutions in the mean I-score was largest for the "ER/ICU" discipline. When the seven institutions were categorized into quartiles for their mean E-score, we found that B was in the lowest quartile; A, C, and D were in the lower-middle quartile; E was in the upper-middle quartile; and F and G were in the highest quartile, with a 0.42-point difference in mean E-score across institutions, from −0.35 for institution B to 0.07 for institution G ( Table 3) . Categorization of the four disciplines showed that "others" was in the lowermiddle quartile, whereas "medical," "surgical," and "ER/ ICU" were in the upper-middle quartile, with a 0.06-point difference between others (−0.21) and medical (−0.15). In effect, the difference in mean E-score was larger and more significant across institutions than across disciplines. In addition, pairwise comparisons showed that institutions G and F had higher mean E-scores than the other institutions, whereas the discipline "others" had a significantly lower mean E-score than the discipline "medical" (Table 3 and  Table 5 ). Table 3 also shows the differences across institutions according to each discipline, when institutions and disciplines were combined. For the "ER/ICU" discipline, the mean scores differed by 0.65 points across institutions, from −0.50 for institution B to 0.15 for institution G. The difference across institutions in the mean E-score was largest for the "ER/ICU" discipline. We also categorized the seven institutions into quartiles for their mean K-scores (Table 4 ). We found that institutions A and D were in the lowest quartile, B and C were in the lower-middle quartile, E and F were in the uppermiddle quartile, and G was in the highest quartile, with a 0.13-point difference in mean K-scores across institutions, from 0.64 for institutions A and D to 0.77 for institution G. The four disciplines were similarly categorized, with "others" and "surgical" being in the lower-middle quartile, while "medical" and "ER/ICU" were in the upper-middle quartile, with a 0.06-point difference between others (0.65) and ER/ICU (0.72). In effect, the difference in mean Kscores was larger and more significant across institutions than across disciplines. In addition, pairwise comparisons showed that institutions G, followed by F and E, had higher mean K-scores than the other institutions, whereas the disciplines "others" and "surgical" had significantly lower mean K-scores than "ER/ICU" and "medical" (Table 4 and  Table 5 ). Table 4 also shows the differences across institutions according to each discipline, when institutions and disciplines were combined. For the "surgical" discipline, the mean scores differed by 0.16 points across institutions, from 0.61 for institution B to 0.77 for institution G. Although the difference across institutions in mean K-scores was largest for the "surgical" discipline, these differences were smaller than those in the other scores. The grand mean K-score was 0.66, indicating that the overall correct knowledge level of preventive measures was 66%. Taking statistically significant differences in K-scores into account, we found that institution G had the highest knowledge level (77%), followed by institutions E and F (70%-71%), and institutions A through D (64%-66%) . Similarly, when sorted by discipline, the ER/ICU and medical categories had the highest knowledge level (69%-72%), followed by surgical and others (65%-67%). The rank by each of the three scores (I, E, and K) was compared with the total rank of the three scores combined for both institutions and disciplines (Table 5) . We found that, for both institutions and disciplines, the I-rank correlated best with the total rank. The E-rank correlated with the total rank, but was correlated to a lesser extent for institutions, and was correlated least for disciplines. The Krank was correlated least for institutions but was correlated well for disciplines. Regardless of the score used, institution G ranked higher than the others, followed by F, whereas institution B ranked lowest. Similarly, for disciplines, ER/ ICU and medical ranked highest, followed by surgical and "others".
