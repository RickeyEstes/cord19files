Totally, 273,385 adults aged ≥20 were hospitalized for all gallstone diseases and related complications during 1997-2005, but only 208,516 fulfilled the inclusion criteria of severe gallstone disease. Among them, 170,781 were identified with incident hospital admissions. After excluding patients with primary and metastatic cancer of the liver, pancreas, and bile duct (n = 5377); malignant neoplasm of other sites (n = 7826); hematological malignancy (n = 441); human immunodeficient virus infection/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (n = 9); and unavailable or incorrect gender or age information in the database (n = 800), Table 2 summarizes the average rates of hospital admissions for severe gallstone disease, gallstone-related complications, and gallstone-related procedures for men and women in the overall population and each age group. Figure 1 shows trends in the age-standardized incidence rates of gallstone-related complications during 1997-2005. Women had relatively stable incidence of severe gallstone disease and acute cholecystitis, whereas men had significantly increased incidence of severe gallstone disease and all related complications (test for trend p < 0.001). Furthermore, the increase in the incidence of acute cholangitis was more marked for men (91%) than for women (32%; test for interaction p < 0.001). The increase in the incidence of biliary pancreatitis was similar for men and women (test for interaction p = 0.07). Figure 2 shows the trends in the incidence of severe gallstone disease and complications among different age groups (20-39, 40-59, 60-79, and ≥80). In the younger population (aged 20-39), increase in the incidences of all gallstone-related complications was significant (82% for acute cholecystitis, 70% for biliary pancreatitis, and 63% for acute cholangitis; test for trend p values < 0.001) ( Fig.  2A) . In the elderly population (aged ≥60), the incidence increase was small for acute cholecystitis but significant for acute cholangitis and biliary pancreatitis, especially among those aged ≥80 (p values < 0.001) (Fig. 2D) . The mean age of patients with gallstone complications after 60 years increased significantly during the study period from 71.6 to 73.5 year-old for men and 71.9 to 73.7 year-old for women (test for trend p values < 0.001). For the age group 40-59, the incidence of all gallstone-related complications remained stable during the study period (Fig.  2B ).
