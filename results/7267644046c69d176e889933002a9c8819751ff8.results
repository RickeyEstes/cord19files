To comprehensively detect variants at the SLC10A1 locus conferring susceptibility to persistent HBV infection, we used two case-control populations, namely the Sample Set 1 (Guangxi population) and the Sample Set 2 (GWAS population) (Supplementary Table 1A ). The Sample Set 1 contains 1,299 PIs (cases) and 1,067 SRs (controls) recruited from Guangxi, China 10 . For the Sample Set 2, we re-used published GWAS data among totally 12,027 individuals of Chinese ancestry [29] [30] [31] [32] , and finally obtained five independent GWAS sub-populations totally including 1,251 PIs and 1,057 SRs by screening for HBV markers as previously reported (Methods) 10 . There was no significant difference between cases and controls in terms of sex and mean age distribution in the two sample sets (all P values > 0.05, Supplementary Table 1A) . Association between SNPs at the SLC10A1 locus and persistent HBV infection. Using the genotype data from Han Chinese in Beijing (CHB) and Han Chinese South (CHS) samples of the 1000 Genomes Project (http://browser.1000genomes.org/index.html), we reconstructed one major haplotype block totally ~80-Kb in length covering the entire SLC10A1 gene at chromosome 14q24. 1 (chr14:70,206,417-70,287,166) . This dataset derived from the 1000 Genomes Project contains nearly 7.5 times more common SNPs and low-frequency variants than those present in release 22 of Hapmap project (296 SNPs vs. 40 SNPs), including a much larger fraction of variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.01 (154 vs. 0), with 0.01 < MAF < 0.05 (28 vs. 3) , and with MAF > 0.05 (114 vs. 37). We chose 14 haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNPs) from these variants (Supplementary Figure 1) , and genotyped them in the Sample Set 1, including 1,299 cases and 1,067 controls of Southern Chinese ancestry. Then, genotype imputation was performed to generate additional genotypes in the locus across the SLC10A1 gene, using the genotype data from CHB and CHS samples of the 1000 Genomes Project as reference. The use of this reference population for imputation permitted a comprehensive evaluation of common variants and some rarer variants at SLC10A1 for susceptibility to persistent HBV infection. Genotype imputation was successful for 113 variants with most variants had MAF > 0.05, bringing the total number of variants evaluated in this haplotype block to 127 (Supplementary Table 2 ). By performing unconditional logistic regression analyses with adjustment for age and sex, we found little evidence of association between SNPs in the SLC10A1 haplotype block and risk of persistent HBV infection in the Sample Set 1 (the lowest nominal P is 0.031; see Fig. 1 Supplementary Figure 2 for dominant and recessive model tests). Therefore, common SNPs at the SLC10A1 locus are probably not associated with risk of persistent HBV infection in the Sample Set 1. We further validated whether or not common SNPs in this region were associated with risk of persistent HBV infection in the Sample Set 2 (GWAS population). As different genotyping arrays cover different SNPs at the SLC10A1 locus in the five GWAS sub-populations of the Sample Set 2, we imputed the missing SNPs in every sub-population with reference haplotypes derived from all Chinese samples of the 1000 Genomes Project. Genotyping or imputation was successful for 132 variants in at least one sub-population, of which, 118 variants (89.4%) have been evaluated in the Sample Set 1 (Supplementary Table 2 ). By performing unconditional logistic regression analyses with adjustment for age and sex, we found none of the 132 variants were associated with risk of persistent HBV infection in GWAS-derived populations with the lowest nominal P value 0.069 ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figure 2) , consistent with the negative association results observed in the Sample Set 1. To estimate the size of an overall effect, we performed meta-analyses of the two sample sets together by the Mantel-Haenszel test. The combined odds ratios (ORs) showed no evidence that any SNP was significantly associated with risk of persistent HBV infection with the lowest nominal P value 0.031 ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figure 2) . Therefore, common SNPs at the SLC10A1 locus are unlikely to be associated with risk of persistent HBV infection in individuals of Southern Chinese ancestry. To investigate whether or not multimarker haplotypes rather than single SNPs could mediate the association between SLC10A1 and risk of persistent HBV infection, we moved on to perform haplotype analyses and found that 14 haplotypes were contained in this region. However, no haplotypes showed significant association in the Sample Set 1 after correction for multiple testing (the lowest nominal P value = 0.035, Supplementary Table 3) . Besides, when the analyses were stratified by age and sex, no significant associations were found between single SNPs or haplotypes in this region and the risk of persistent HBV infection in the Sample Set 1 (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5) . Taking together, these results indicated that neither common SNPs nor haplotypes at the SLC10A1 locus were associated with risk of persistent HBV infection in subjects of Southern Chinese ancestry. Low-frequency non-silent variants at SLC10A1. We resequenced all exons and splicing regions of SLC10A1 in 244 unrelated HBV carriers randomly selected from the Sample Set 1 (Supplementary Table 1B) , to examine whether or not low-frequency non-silent variants at SLC10A1 contribute to risk of persistent HBV infection. We only found one recurrent low-frequency non-silent variation (rs148467625) in this region, a nonsynonymous Isoleucine to Threonine change at residue 88 in exon 1. Reanalyzing the genotype data of the 1000 Genomes Project showed that the frequency of rs148467625 is low in the Southern Han Chinese population (MAF = 0.015), and this SNP may not exist in the Northern Han Chinese population and other ethnic populations. We then genotyped rs148467625 in the Sample Set 1 (Methods). The results showed that the MAF of rs148467625 in the Guangxi population is 0.015, similar to it's MAF in the Southern Han Chinese population of the 1000 Genomes Project and the previous reports 21, 24 . We found that this SNP showed no association with risk of persistent HBV infection in the Sample Set 1 (Supplementary Table 6 ). Together, these results suggest that low-frequency non-silent variants at SLC10A1 may not individually represent a major risk factor for the risk of persistent HBV infection among Southern Chinese.
