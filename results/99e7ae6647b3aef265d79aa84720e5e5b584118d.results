In vitro and in vivo Expression of AAV8-encoding Anti-CCR4 h1567 A modified scFvFc minibody format was used as the antibody moiety in the AAV8 vector, in which the V domains of heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains of the humanized scFv h1567 were fused to the coding region of the hinge and constant domains 2 and 3 (CH2 and CH3) of the human IgG1 heavy chain, to yield bivalent binding to the target molecule hCCR4 (Figure 1a ) (DK. Chang et al., in press). The resulting recombinant AAV8 vector was used for both in vitro protein synthesis and virus production for in vivo antibody gene delivery. In a pilot dosing study, nude mice received a single injection of two different concentrations of AAV8-h1567 via intravenous tail vein injection. Serum h1567 minibody levels were followed for 15 weeks. H1567 minibody levels rose for the first 2-3 weeks, reaching levels of circa 65 and 96 ug/ml for the low (0.8610 11 vg/mouse) and high (2.0610 11 vg/mouse) vector doses, respectively and then through the remaining weeks of the study leveled off at near peak levels for the high dosed vector and circa 1/3rd that level (,35 ug/ml) for the low dosed vector ( Figure S1 ). Because 2610 11 vg per mouse gave higher serum levels of h1567, this vector concentration was used in the subsequent in vivo studies. CCR4 + Mac-1 tumor cells grow well in SCID-BEIGE mice and therefore we established a SCID-BEIGE/Mac-1 xenograft tumor model to evaluate the efficacy of AAV8-h1567 therapeutic minibody gene transfer. In SCID-BEIGE mice treated with a single intravenous tail vein injection of the AAV8 vectors, a timedependent increase in serum concentrations of the control 11A and h1567 minibodies, reaching steady state levels of circa 50 ug/ ml after 7-14 days and remaining at those peak levels through day 28, the last day of the study ( Figure 1b) . The control 11A is a irrelevant minibody that is directed against SARS Spike protein [21] . To determine whether the AAV8-minibody transduction in vivo could result in production of properly folded scFvFc, protein A-purified minibodies recovered from serum of SCID-BEIGE mice three weeks following intravenous delivery of AAV8 vectors were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting. As shown in Figure 1c , when examined under reducing conditions, the 11A and h1567 minibodies recovered from both in vitro and in vivo sources showed bands at the expected size for scFvFc, circa 60 kD. Analysis under non-reducing conditions showed dimer formation (mol wt circa 120 kD), thereby confirming that the minibodies were divalent in vitro and in vivo ( Figure 1c ). In addition, the ease of recovery of the AAV8-derived minibodies from serum using affinity purification on protein A, their reactivity on Western blot with the anti-human Fc antibody, and their stable dimer formation confirms the proper folding and structural integrity of their CH2-CH3 domains (Figure 1c and 1d ). Binding Activity of h1567 Minibody in Serum Following AAV8-mediated Gene Transfer To determine the functional integrity of the AAV8-derived scFvFc minibodies, sera obtained from mice 14 days after in vivo AAV8 transduction were examined for the level of binding to CCR4 by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 1e , the secreted h1567 minibody in the mouse serum could specifically bind to the CCR4 + Mac-1 cells and CCR4 + 293T cells but not to parental 293T cells, indicating that the scFv domain was correctly folded and that it retained full antigen-binding activity. Irrelevant 11A minibody, which served as a negative control, did not bind to CCR4-expressing cells.
