Of 148 specimens submitted from patients who were assessed by physicians to have possible mumps, only 85 were felt to have parotitis when assessed by Nova Scotia Public Health (Fig. 1) . The median age of this group was 26 years (13-68 years) 65% of whom were female. The remaining 63 did not have evidence of parotitis and were used as a comparative group. The median age, age distribution and gender ratio was the same as the parotitis group (26 years (7-68 years), 65% female). Overall 7 different viruses were identified between the two groups. Parainfluenza 3, influenza A and EBV was detected in patients with bilateral parotitis, and adenovirus and EBV was identified in the unilateral parotitis group (Fig. 1 ). In the non-parotitis group, parainfluenza 3, hMPV, rhinovirus, and EBV were identified. No CMV was detected in any group. Of 23 specimens where EBV was detected (13 in the nonparotitis and 10 in the parotitis groups), companion sera was evaluated for serologic evidence of primary infection or reactivation. As defined by the presence of EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgM and the absence of anti-EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG, 3 of 10 in the parotitis group and 1 of 13 in the non-parotitis group were found to be acute EBV infections. The remaining patients with detectable EBV all had anti-EBNA IgG suggesting viral shedding due to reactivation rather than primary disease. The average viral load for those with acute infection (7.02 log) was significantly higher (P < 0.005) than shedding due to reactivation (5.51 log).
