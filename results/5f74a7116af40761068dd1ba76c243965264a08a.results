The results are summarised in Table 2 . Prior to this study, the owner of Household C had attempted various Mutian X treatment regimes in her cats. A single dose treatment was attempted on two cats (C10 and C12) and while virus load reduced, it failed to clear infection and virus load increased again in Cat C10. Cat C1 was given a single injection of Mutian three days prior to oral treatment which had reduced her virus shedding from C T 20 to 32. Thus a single dose was ineffective at clearing infection and may have risked the emergence of resistant viruses.
