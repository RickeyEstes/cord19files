There were a total of 1378 consecutive patients during the study period. Fifty patients (3.6%) were excluded because their chest radiographs were unavailable for radiologists' review. Of 1328 cases included for analysis, 38.7% were males and 61.3% females. The mean (SD) age was 38.4 (17.0) years. There were 177 cases with final diagnosis of SARS, and the prevalence in this setting was thus calculated to be 13.3%. The SARS-CoV antibody status was positive in 171 patients (96.6%) of those diagnosed with SARS in our study. The reports on the initial chest radiograph were indeterminate in 55 patients (4.1%). After excluding these from the analysis, the initial chest radiograph had a sensitivity of 50.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 42.6-57.9), specificity of 95.0% (95% CI, 93.5-96.2), positive likelihood ratio of 10.06, negative likelihood ratio of 0.52, positive predictive value of 61.5%, negative predictive value of 92.3%, and an accuracy of 88.8% for predicting SARS ( Table 1) . The reports on serial chest radiography were indeterminate in 50 patients (3.7%). After excluding these from the analysis, serial chest radiography had a sensitivity of 94.4% (95% CI, 89. (Table 2) . For patients who have SARS with positive radiograph (n = 167), the mean (SD) duration from onset of symptoms to positive radiograph was 5.8 (5.4) days. Seventy-nine (47.3%) of these patients had negative or indeterminate chest radiographs at initial presentation, and the mean (SD) duration from initial presentation to positive chest radiograph was 5.4 (6.3) days. Of 829 patients who initially presented with a temperature of 37.58C or lower, serial chest radiographs identified 98 (11.8%) positive cases. Of these, 68 (69.4%) were finally diagnosed with SARS. Of 1028 patients who initially presented with a temperature of 388C or lower, serial radiographs identified 143 (13.9%) positive cases. Of these, 103 (72.0%) were finally diagnosed with SARS. The performance of serial chest radiography in identifying SARS in these 2 categories of cases is shown in Table 3 .
