We enrolled 360 cases and 334 controls. For case and control the median age was 8 months (IQR: 5-13) and 11 months (IQR: 6-18) (p = 0.001) respectively. Weight/age Zscore was -4.3 (SD ±0.7) for cases and -4.1 (SD ±1.1) for controls (p = 0.01). Among cases 68% had both clinical and radiological pneumonia, 1% had clinical pneumonia and 31% had only radiological pneumonia. Respiratory virus detection was high in cases compared to controls [69.9% (251) vs. 44  We screened a total of 656 SAM children for pneumonia and 507 SAM children with the same criteria for no pneumonia. Of those, 360 children were enrolled as cases and 334 were controls for our study (Fig 1) . Among cases, 68% (245) had both clinical pneumonia and radiological pneumonia, 1% (4) had clinical pneumonia and 31% (111) had only radiological pneumonia. Ninety-nine percent (356) of cases had cough with a median duration of 5 days (IQR: 3-7), 19% (46) had runny nose with a median duration of 3 days (IQR: 2-5), 48% (174) had tachypnoea, 24% (86) had chest indrawing and 13% (45) had hypoxaemia. For the case and control, median age was 8 months (IQR: 5-13) and 11 months (IQR: 6-18) (p = 0.001) and 62% and 61% were male (p = 0.7), respectively. Younger in age (8 months vs. 11 months, p = 0.001), lower Z score of weight for age (p = 0.01), congenital heart disease (p<0.001), exposure to cigarette smoke at home (p = 0.04), and getting antibiotics before hospitalization (p<0.001) were more common among the cases compared to the controls (Table 1) . Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) vaccination was higher (case: 37% vs. control 61%; p = <0.001)) among controls (Table 1) . There was no difference in gender, maternal education and occupation, exclusive breast feeding, weight for height and Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination between cases and controls. A similar proportion of cases and controls had a history of respiratory tract infection (RTI) among family members in last 14 days, household cooked in bedroom, low socioeconomic status, and were slum dwellers ( Bacterial pathogens were isolated from blood culture in 4% (16) cases. Isolates identified Pseudomonas 25% (4), Enterococcus 12.5% (2), Salmonella typhi 12.5% (2), Streptococcus pneumoniae 6.3% (1), Staphylococcus aureus 6.3% (1), Klebsiella 6.3% (1), Streptococcus spp 6.3% (1), Corynebacterium spp 6.3% (1),and Beta-hemolytic streptococcus 6.3% (1). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus which might be a contaminant was also isolated in 12.5% (2) of children. Antibiotic usage prior to admission was reported in 50% (8) 34 .5% (60); p = 0.003] was higher in controls when compared to cases (Fig 2) . Respiratory viral pathogens such as RSV [3.9% (7) (8)] were detected more frequently among younger children (< = 12 months vs. 13-60 months) of the cases (Fig 2) . Among the cases, fever was most frequent in children with influenza and subsequently in RSV, HPIV, adenovirus, and HMPV; all the children with respiratory viruses had cough except for those with adenovirus (90%). Compared to other respiratory viruses detected, tachypnea and chest in-drawing were higher in children with RSV; hypoxemia (SpO2<90%), grunting and head nodding were more common in children with HMPV; temperature was higher in children with influenza virus; and rales were more common in children with RSV and HMPV ( Table 2) . Pulmonary infiltration was reported in all cases of influenza and adenovirus detected. Consolidation was reported mostly in HMPV (Table 2) . Of the enrolled children, 3.7% (26/694; 24 cases and 2 controls) died in the hospital and another 2.0% (14/694; 12 case and 2 control) of the children died during post-discharge follow up period. We had 6.6% (24) inpatient and 3.3% (12) post-discharge deaths among the cases. Among inpatient deaths according to different viral etiology mortality was higher among Fig 3. RSV was detected constantly from September 2015 to August 2016, with a peak in winter from December 2015 to February 2016. Influenza virus was detected during the already defined influenza season in Bangladesh (May to October). HPIV was detected throughout the year, with a first peak in May 2015 and a second peak in March 2016. HMPV was detected from August to October in 2015 with a peak in September and from December 2016 to March 2017 with a peak in February. Adenoviruses and rhinoviruses were detected throughout the year without any seasonal variation. After adjusting for age, PCV vaccination, duration of illness onset to hospitalization, and use of antibiotics prior to hospitalization, RSV (OR 13.1; 95% CI: 1.6, 106.1), influenza (OR 8.7; 95% CI: 1.0, 78.9), HPIV (3.8; 95% CI: 1.0, 14.8), and HMPV (2.7; 95% CI: 1.3, 5.5) were Table 2
