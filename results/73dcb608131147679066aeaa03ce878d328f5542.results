Pre-existing anti-MHV antibody and resistance to MHV3 infection Table 1 , the fully susceptible H III mice were shown to have a lower pre-existing anti-MHVantibody titer (3.2 log 2 ) when compared to the resistant L III mice (5.9 log 2 ). The mortality rates of the hybrids and the segregants showed a co-dominance of the susceptible and resistance characters in all these populations, as shown by the mortality analysis. The survivors had pre-existing anti-MHV antibody titers higher (ranging from 7.2 to 8 log 2 ) than those found in mice which died (ranging from 4.7 to 5.6 log 2 ) and also higher than those found in the parental resistant L III mice; thus, for this phenotype, there exists an over dominance of high responsiveness. These data indicate a positive correlation between the antibody titers present in the serum and resistance to the experimental infection with MHV3. Animals showing higher antibody titers (> 5.9 log 2 ) survived the infection and those showing lower antibody titers (< 5.6 log 2 ) died. No variation of mean survival time was observed among the groups. Thus, it could be deduced from the data in Table 1 , that among the genetically heterogeneous mice, anti-MHVantibody titers greater than 5.9 log 2 would predict resistance and mice expressing titers less than 5.6 log 2 should be susceptible to MHV3.
