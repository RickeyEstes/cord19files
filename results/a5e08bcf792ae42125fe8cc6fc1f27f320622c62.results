Of the environmental attitude variables, there is no statistically significant relationship between environmental awareness and well-being. The variable measuring perceptions of environmental consciousness in the neighbourhood, however, is statistically significant with a positive coefficient. The results for the neighbourhood environmental consciousness variable reflect the public goods aspect of environmental activism (Hardin, 1982) . Improving the environment requires collective action and an improvement in environmental consciousness in the respondent's neighbourhood will result in a better environment for the individual. For example, if local factories reduce pollution emissions because of an improvement in environmental consciousness in the neighbourhood, this will improve the quality of the air the respondent breathes, having a positive effect on subjective well-being. The results for the other control variables in Table 2 are generally consistent with expectations and findings from previous studies. Of the personal characteristics of the respondent we find that household income has a positive effect on subjective well-being, while being unemployed has a negative effect on subjective well-being. We find a non-linear u-shaped relationship between age and subjective well-being However, education, gender and marital status are statistically insignificant. Of the social attitude variables, people who considered social protection and income inequality important as well as those who were pro-market report lower levels of well-being ceteris paribus, while those who considered national reunification and SARS important reported higher levels of subjective well-being ceteris paribus. The results for attitudes to income inequality and social protection could reflect concern about widening income disparities and large numbers of low income individuals, including sizeable numbers of laid-off workers, who have been the losers of the market reforms. However, it is likely that such attitudes will differ between different segments of the urban population and more detailed study is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn about these attitudes and subjective well-being. The results for pro-market attitudes differ from a study by Graham and Pettinato (2001) which found that having pro-market attitudes are associated with higher subjective well-being in Latin America and Russia. Comparing China and Russia the different results could lie in the speed of the reform. China's 'gradual approach' to market reforms has been much slower than Russia's 'big bang' reforms. Thus, individuals who support further marketization in China might have lower subjective well-being because they are frustrated with the relatively slow pace of the reforms.
