Nine patients eventually diagnosed with pertussis presented to the ED during our identified time period, with patient ages ranging from 1.6-18 years (mean, 9.6 years). The average LOS was 94 minutes (range, 62 to 294 minutes; standard deviation = 96.6). When combining all 9 cases, EMR review (alone) identified 45 potential contacts (Table 1 and Fig 1) . Thirteen health care workers were identified in the EMR but not identified by RTLS, including 2 physicians, 6 triage nurses, 1 discharge nurse, 1 scribe, 1 urology technician, 1 radiology technician, and 1 medical student. RTLS alone identified 77 contacts, of whom 45 were additional new contacts not identified from the EMR. Table 2 shows the roles of the health care staff identified by RTLS but not by EMR review. RTLS identified twice as many possible contact cases as those identified by EMR review (P < .01) increasing the number of potential contacts above those identified by the EMR from an average of 5 contacts per case to an average of 10 contacts per case (Fig 1 and Table 1 ).
