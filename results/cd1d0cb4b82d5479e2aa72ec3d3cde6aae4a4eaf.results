Viral outbreak in X-SCID rat colony. During quarterly diagnostic screening, serologic positivity for P. carinii was detected in an X-SCID rat breeding colony. Four (2 male and 2 female) rats exhibiting respiratory distress and chromodacryorrhea were euthanized, and lungs were collected for histopathology evaluation ( Fig. 1 ; see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). PCR testing confirmed infection with P. carinii (data not shown), and all rats in the colony began treatment with 250 mg/kg of body weight/day sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) pulse treatment for 2 weeks orally in water bottles. Rats were given 2 weeks off and a subsequent second round of SMZ. Follow-up serology performed at quarterly testing indicated no active infection for P. carinii or for other known rat pathogens, including cytomegalovirus and mouse adenoviruses 1 and 2 (Table 1) . Other than the 4 rats mentioned above, no rats within the colony displayed overt clinical symptoms. However, from a reproductive standpoint, female rats within this colony usually had 4 to 8 pups per litter, and the reproductive life span consisted of 2 litters per animal. Rarely, females had third litters with very poor survival rates, suggesting markedly reduced fecundity. Female rats were unable to maintain pregnancy after 6 months of age. Although diagnostic screening excluded all known rat pathogens except P. carinii, histopathological changes, such as inclusion bodies, suggested a viral cause that could not be explained by P. carinii infection of the lung alone (Fig. 1) . Therefore, a total of 8 additional rats (6 adults and 2 6-week-old weanlings) were examined via gross and microscopic pathology of all organs to look for pathological and immunohistochemical evidence of viral disease. Characteristic gross findings expected for the X-SCID strain (29) included severe thymic hypoplasia, unidentifiable lymph nodes, and hypoplastic spleens. In addition to gross findings indicative of pneumonia (see Fig. S2 and Table S2 in the supplemental material), we observed microscopic alterations, including intranuclear inclusions (Fig. 2) , inflammation, and hyperplastic and dysplastic changes in the epithelia of multiple organs: nasal mucosa and lung ( Fig. 1) , parotid and submandibular salivary and harderian glands, reproductive organs (prostate and uterine epithelium), and kidney (see Table S3 in the supplemental material). In the 1984 report mentioned above, a similar condition associated with polyomavirus infection was described in athymic nude rats (28) . We therefore applied a recently developed panpolyomavirus immunohistochemistry test (P-PIT) comprised of a cocktail of three antibodies that, when combined, can detect all known human PyV T antigens (21) . In all 12 rats, tissue sections showing intranuclear inclusion bodies by hematoxylinand-eosin (H&E) examination also demonstrated correspondingly strong nuclear immunoreactivity by P-PIT (data not shown; representative examples are presented in Fig. 3A and 7 ). Tissues not affected by inclusion body changes, such as the heart, liver, spleen, and brain, were immunonegative (data not shown). Some degree of selectivity or tropism for distinct types of epithelia is discernible. For example, lesions in the salivary gland (Fig. 3A) were significantly more prominent in the serous portions of the gland than in the mucinous portions, where there were rare areas of necrosis, mixed infiltrates, and intranuclear inclusions. Follow-up immunostaining using each of the three antibodies comprising the P-PIT cocktail singly revealed strong PAb416 reactivity and weak Xt7 reactivity, while 2t2 antibody was unreactive on the diseased tissues (data not shown).
