Ohio females (52.9%) and White race (62.5%) were represented higher than males and non-White race. Hispanic ethnicity was recorded only for 53% of the cases with 51% total being non-Hispanic. We looked at 19,056 cases of dengue, HA, IH, malaria, meningococcal bacteria, and mumps. Figure 1 shows the confirmed cases of malaria all with nonautochthonous travel with the most having traveled to country being India followed by Nigeria, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Eritrea, and Sierra Leone. Figure 2 shows the assignment of cases and controls to exposure to international air travel (derived from total number of US passports issued) and high enplanement (amount of boarding annually). Table 1 shows the risk of enplanement and international travels for malaria, HA, and IH. International travel's effect on nonendemic disease as represented by malaria (2.7) versus endemic disease as represented by IH and HA (0.031) provided a ratio of relative risk of 87.1 (95% CI 55. . For persons in proximity of an airport with high enplanement the ratio of relative risk of endemic HA and influenza versus nonendemic malaria was protective 0.397 (0.282-0.559). Modeling of malaria, HA, and IH regressed on the following independent variables: female sex, Hispanic ethnicity, non-White race, large metropolitan area, and any history of travel (Table 2)
