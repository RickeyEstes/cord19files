We analyzed 1,760 surveillance questionnaires, including 880 pen-and-paper questionnaires and 880 smartphone questionnaires. The majority of questionnaires (89%) were from cases aged 2-59 months. Of the 1,760 questionnaires, 413 (24%) met the ILI case definition and 1,344 (76%) met the SARI case definition while 3 questionnaires did not have the case classification specified (Table 1) . There was no difference in the distribution of ILI cases by age between data collected using smartphones and penand-paper (p = 0.16). There was also no difference in distribution of SARI cases by age across data collection methods (p = 0.15). There were more ILI cases recorded using pen-and-paper than smartphones.
