Monoclonal antibodies employed in both assays were the same for five out of the seven respiratory virus antigens tested, with the exceptions of parainfluenza type 1 virus and parainfiuenza type 2 virus (Table 1 ) . Since monoclonal antibodies used in TR-FIA for these two viruses were not satisfactory in Biotin-EIA, other monoclonal antibodies were tested. Clones 253-9D and 251-12A for parainfluenza type 1 virus, and 233-4D for parainfluenza type 2 virus were found to be best in Biotin-EIA. In the optimization tests, semipurified virus preparations and two TR-FIA positive and three negative specimens were included. The use of TR-FIA assay buffer increased the P/N ratio of the Biotin-EIAs at least twofold compared with the standard EIA assay buffer, which was PBS with 0.5% BSA and 0.2% Tween 20. DTPA was the most essential reagent in the assay buffer which improved the Biotin-EIA performance. With semipurified virus, TR-FIA was always more sensitive than Biotin-EIA, but with clinical specimens no difference was observed. No quantitative tests were done with highly purified virus preparations, so the sensitivities could not be expressed as ng/ml values. Next, we selected 257 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens to test simultaneously with Biotin-EIA and TR-FIA. The results are summarized in Table 2 . The overall agreement was 95.7%: 192 specimens (74.7%) were positive and 54 (21%) were negative in both assays. From 11 specimens with discrepant results, 9 were positive in Biotin-EIA but negative in TR-FIA, and 2 were positive in TR-FIA but negative in EIA. The range of OD values and cps are shown in Table 3 . The sensitivity of Biotin-EIA and TR-FIA was further tested by titrating three specimens positive for each virus. All specimens tested were positive in each assay at least up to a 1:500 dilution (data not shown). The specificity of Biotin-EIA was confirmed by selecting 10 NPA specimens positive in Biotin-EIA and testing them against the six other respiratory viruses by Biotin-EIA. None were positive in these cross-matched tests. Biotin-EIA was also tested by one-hour incubation format. The preliminary results obtained showed a slight decrease in the absolute optical density values, but the P/N ratios were similar to those obtained with the overnight format.
