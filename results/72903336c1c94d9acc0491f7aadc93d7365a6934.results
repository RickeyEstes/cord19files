We enrolled 784 patients (375 males and 409 females) across three different age groups (<20 years, n = 159; 20-49 years, n = 180; ≥50 years, n = 445). When hospitals were classified according to the number of beds, 650 patients were referred from primary care, 93 from secondary care, and 41 from tertiary care. When hospitals were classified according to medical specialty, 148 patients were referred from non-eye specialists, 545 were referred from eye specialists, and 91 were referred from eye specialists in trainee hospital (Table 1) . Under the current classification system, there were no significant differences in patients' sex or age between hospitals of different sizes ( p = 0.553, p = 0.898, respectively). There were also no differences in the rates of patient care (p = 0.898) or medical fees within the first six months after the initial hospital visit according to hospital sizes ( p = 0.372) ( Table 2) . When hospitals were classified according to doctors' medical specialty, there was no difference in patients' sex according to medical specialty ( p = 0.223); however, patients referred from non-eye specialists were significantly younger ( p < 0.001). A significant difference was observed among patients under the age of 20 ( p < 0.001), while no significant differences were observed among over the age of 20 (20-49, ≥50; p = 0.675, p = 0.064, respectively). When the proportion of the patients who required medical care were compared, an increasing rate were found in the order of non-eye specialists, eye specialists, and eye specialists in trainee hospital ( p < 0.001). Such differences were observed across all age groups (<20, 20-49, ≥50; p < 0.001, p = 0.029, p = 0.004, respectively). With respect to the medical fees paid for the six months following the initial hospital visit, the medical fees increased in the order of non-eye specialists, eye specialists, and eye specialists in trainee hospital ( p < 0.001). Such differences were observed across all age groups (p < 0.001, p = 0.011, p < 0.001, respectively) ( Table 3) . To further investigate the underlying causes for these differences, we examined patients' diagnoses according to their age and medical institution. Many of the patients under the age of 20 had strabismus and underwent ophthalmologic plastic surgery, and, patients who were referred from noneye specialists often had no ophthalmological problems, while those referred from eye specialists commonly had strabismus and those referred from eye specialists in trainee hospital frequently had retinal disease. Many of the patients between 20 and 29 years old had corneal or retinal problems; Values are presented as number (%) or mean ± standard deviation. those who were referred from non-eye specialists as well as eye specialists often had corneal disease and those referred from eye specialists in trainee hospital commonly underwent ophthalmologic plastic surgery. Retinal diseases were most common in the patients over the age of 50 (Fig. 1 ).
