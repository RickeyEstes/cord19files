All subjects were able to complete all trials. Compared with controls, the EAPR resulted in significant decreases in breathing rate at both work rates and significantly increased tidal volume at the 1.7-mph work rate; otherwise, there were no statistically significant differences in measured physiological variables (Tables 1 and 2) There were no significant differences in mean mixed inhalation/exhalation respirator dead space carbon dioxide concentrations at 1.7 mph and 2.5 mph (P 5 .61) or respirator dead space oxygen concentrations at 1.7 mph or 2.5 mph (P 5 .80) ( Table 2 ). There were no significant differences between controls and EAPR in mean exertion scores at 1.7 mph (P 5 .67) and 2.5 mph (P 5 .96), mean comfort scores (P 5 .67 for both comparisons), or EAPR moisture retention (P 5 .72) ( Table 3) . Subjective complaints and EAPR features associated with discomfort are listed in Table 3 .
