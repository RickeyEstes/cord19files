Four teams of 3 physicians completed 5 scenarios inside and outside of a bioisolation tent during 2 4-hour sessions. The results of univariate comparison of mean times to critical action completion are shown in Table 1 . The mean time for critical action completion within the total negative pressure isolation tent was 298 seconds and without the total negative pressure isolation tent, 284 seconds. The mean critical action completion time for the first versus second experiment was 317 seconds and 264 seconds. The time to completion for scenarios 1 to 5 was 328 seconds, 303 seconds, 287 seconds, 336 seconds, and 199 seconds, respectively. The impact of run order (ie, time to completion of critical actions, depending on whether it was the first or second time a scenario was performed by a group) yielded times of 338 seconds for the first attempt and 243 seconds for the second attempt. The elapsed time variables showed a nearly normal distribution, with 1 outlier and a z score of 4. Excluding the outlier, the skewness became 0.521; kurtosisœ≠0.009. The presence of the tent had little effect on the average time to completion of critical actions. Because groups did not complete all critical actions, the proportion of procedures completed was compared for each variable. We observed that completion rates differed among scenarios but not by whether the tent was present ( Table 2 ). Temperature and humidity in the total negative pressure isolation tent and in the adjoining room without the tent are shown in Figure E5 (available online at http://www.annemergmed.com). Participants answered questionnaire 1 after the first and second run of each scenario (Tables E3 and E4 , available online at http://www.annemergmed.com). The mean score for selfassessed performance (question 1a) did not differ between the setting outside of and within the total negative pressure isolation tent. Similarly, there was no statistical difference (when Bonferroni correction was applied) in the self-reported ability to perform procedures, though there was a strong trend toward greater ease outside of the tent. Significant differences were noted with regard to ease of access to equipment and patients, ease of communication, and level of comfort. In questionnaire 2 (administered after performance of the identical scenario inside and outside of the tent), 53% of participants (95% confidence interval 0.4% to 0.6%) believed that the total negative pressure isolation tent did not negatively affect patient treatment (Table E5 , available online at http:// www.annemergmed.com). Sixty-two percent of respondents indicated a positive or neutral response about their comfort level in the tent.
