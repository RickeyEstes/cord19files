Anti-VWF mAb SZ34 decreases the susceptibility of VWF to proteolysis by ADAMTS13 under shear stress In this study, we used rADAMTS13 and pVWF as the sources of enzyme and substrate to determine the effect of SZ34 on VWF proteolysis under shear stress. The cleavage product was determined by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions followed by Western blot. The results showed that the 350 kDa cleavage product of VWF under shear stress was reduced in the presence of SZ34 in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 1 ). The half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of the SZ34 was estimated to be approximately 50 mg/ml ( Figure 1 ). In contrast, other anti-VWF mAbs including 1C1E7 (an anti-VWF D'D3 mAb), SZ129 (an anti-VWF A1 mAb), SZ123 (an anti-VWF A3 mAb) and so on had no effects on the proteolytic cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13 (Figure 1 and Table 1 ). The control experiments established the lack of detectable proteolysis in the absence of ADAMTS13 or in the addition of 20 mM EDTA to reaction mixtures ( Figure 1 ). The proteolysis of VWF by ADAMTS13 in the absence and presence of anti-VWF mAbs was also determined by agarose gel electrophoresis visualizing VWF multimers. We showed that the decreased amount of the high and intermediate molecular weight multimers were dramatically reduced by mAb SZ34 in a concentration-dependent manner under shear stress (Figure 2 ), further confirming the role of SZ34 in decreasing the susceptibility of VWF to proteolytic cleavage by ADAMTS13 under physiologically relevant conditions. SZ34 had no effects on VWF proteolysis by ADAMTS13 under denaturing/static condition When pVWF was pre-denatured with guanidine-HCl before incubation with SZ34 and rADAMTS13, no obvious difference in the 350 kDa cleavage products was detected ( Figure 3 and Purified pVWF (150 nM) was preincubated with SZ34 (0-200 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37uC, and then incubated with 50 nM rADAMTS13. After 5 min of vortexing at 2,500 rpm on a mini vortexer, the 350 kDa cleavage products were visualized by 5% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and Western blot analysis. 1C1E7 (an anti-VWF D'D3 mAb), SZ129 (an anti-VWF A1 mAb) and SZ123 (an anti-VWF A3 mAb) were used as negative controls. (B) Changes in the cleavage products detected relative to that observed in the absence of mAbs were determined under shear stress by densitometry. The extent of cleavage was analyzed by detection of the intensity of the 350 kDa cleavage products. Results represent the mean 6 standard deviation of four independent experiments. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0022157.g001 Table 1 ). Thus, SZ34 had no effect on the digestion of unfolded VWF by ADAMTS13. In the meantime, anti-VWF mAbs including 1C1E7, SZ129, SZ123, etc, exhibited no effects on ADAMTS13-mediated proteolysis of the unfolded VWF under static conditions either ( Figure 3 and Table 1 ). To exclude the influence of denaturing condition on interaction between VWF and antibodies, we constructed and expressed VWF-R1597W mutant and investigated whether SZ34 inhibited its proteolysis by ADAMTS13. R1597W is the most frequent mutation in von Willebrand disease type 2A and the mutation site is adjacent to Tyr1605-Met1606 bond. This mutant VWF can be cleaved by ADAMTS13 under static condition and in the absence of denaturants such as urea and guanidine [8] . The results showed that with or without SZ34 R1597W VWF multimers were equally effectively cleaved by ADAMTS13 under static conditions (Figure 4 ), which suggested that SZ34 had no effects on the proteolysis of this VWF mutant by ADAMTS13. Preliminary experiments have shown that SZ34 binds to VWF-R1597W multimers by an ELISA method and the dissociation constants (Kd) is 0.6760.11 nM.
