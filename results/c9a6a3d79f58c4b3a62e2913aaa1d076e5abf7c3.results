sIQ: an epidemic model with (partial) isolation. Consider, to begin with, a random network of N nodes; each node represents a host, and nodes that are linked by edges are neighbors. The mean degree at a node is given by 〈k〉, and an important parameter for us is the density of connections m = 〈k〉/N at each node. In the absence of any control mechanism, the situation is as follows. Each host is in one of four discrete states: healthy and susceptible (S), incubating (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R). Infectious hosts infect their neighbors at rate β; infected nodes incubate the disease for a period of σ units of time during which they are assumed to be neither symptomatic nor infectious. At the end of the incubation period they become infectious. Infectious nodes remain in that state until they recover and gain immunity for a period that on average lasts 1/α units of time at the end of which they rejoin the susceptible group. To the setting above, we introduce the following isolation scheme: If a host remains infectious for τ units of time without having recovered, it enters a new state, Q (for quarantine), with probability p. The hosts that do not enter state Q at time τ remain infectious until they recover on their own. We use the terms isolation and quarantine interchangeably, and use the letter Q to better distinguish it from the infectious state I. A host in state Q does not infect others; it remains in this state for κ units of time, at the end of which it is discharged and joins the recovered class. Figure 1 depicts the model states and main parameters: The five states of this model are S, E, I, Q and R, representing respectively the healthy and susceptible, incubating, infectious, isolated and recovered groups within the population. The numbers σ, τ, κ > 0 and ∈ p [0, 1] are the new parameters of the model, with σ being the incubation period, τ representing the length of time between a host's becoming infectious and entering isolation if it is identified, and κ the isolation time. The number p is the probability that an infectious host is identified and isolated. We refer to p as the isolation probability, and τ as the identification time. Table 1 summarizes the main parameters of the SIQ model and their meaning. Continuum limit. We assume the total population is constant, and let S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t) and R(t) denote the fractions of susceptible, incubating, infectious, isolated and recovered nodes at time t, so that Assuming that links between the infectious and susceptible nodes are uncorrelated, we obtain, by moment closure, the following system of DDEs in the continuum limit as → ∞ N : Each term in the rate equation model (1)-(5) can be attributed to a specific transition between the compartments, see Fig. 1 . For instance, the terms βmS(t)I(t) in Eqs (1) and (2) correspond to the transition from S (susceptible) to E (incubating). It is proportional to the product S(t)I(t) that is, the contact probability of an infected and a susceptible node, the transmission rate β, and the density of contacts m. After time σ, these incubating www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ nodes undergo transition from E (incubating) to I (infectious), which is reflected in the terms βmS(t − σ)I(t − σ). The infectious nodes recover with the rate γ, therefore, out of the βmS(t − σ − τ)I(t − σ − τ) nodes entering I at time t − τ, only the fraction e −γτ βmS(t − σ − τ)I(t − σ − τ) remains infectious at time t. These nodes are then undergo transition from I (infectious) to Q (isolated) with probability p corresponding to the terms (3) and (4) . The derivation of system (1)-(5) is analogous to that in 22 where Once infected, a node incubates the disease for σ units of time, during which it is not symptomatic and cannot transmit the disease. At the end of incubation, these nodes become infectious. Infectious nodes recover on their own at rate γ gaining immunity against the disease. Immunity is lost at a rate α. Those infectious nodes that are not recovered after τ units of time are, with probability p, identified and isolated. They remain in isolation for a duration of κ at the end of which they are released and rejoin the healthy group. Table 2 for specific values of parameters for given diseases. Table 2 . Critical response capability p c and critical identification time τ c (in days) for various diseases with basic reproductive number r, and σ as well as 1/γ (in days). The critical τ c is calculated assuming that 80% of infected individuals are identified and isolated. www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ we provided a detailed derivation for a simpler model. The results below pertain to the continuum limit system (1)-(5). Disease-free states and minimum response needed to squash a small outbreak. Without isolation and assuming everyone is susceptible, whether or not an outbreak will spread is determined by the disease reproductive number that is, an infection spreads if and only if r > 1 23 . We are interested in the case r > 1, so that if no measures are taken the infection will spread and reach an endemic state. Our first result is that when the isolation probability is p and identification time is τ, the effective disease reproductive number r ε becomes The number ε can be thought of as the response capability of the affected community. Upon the sudden appearance of a small group of infected individuals, the incipient epidemic is squashed if and only if r(1 − ε) < 1, i.e., the isolation protocol as described above reduces the disease reproductive number by rε. This is under the assumption that the outbreak starts near the disease-free equilibrium ≡ S E I Q R ( , , , , ) (1, 0, 0, 0, 0). The case where a fraction of individuals is immune to begin with will be discussed later. We now consider separately the two components in the notion of response capability ε. Minimum isolation probability. An outbreak can be prevented only if p > p c where The number p c is a theoretical minimum: to have a chance to quell the outbreak, health authorities must have the ability to identify -and the facilities to isolate -a fraction p c of the infectious population immediately after an individual becomes infectious.
