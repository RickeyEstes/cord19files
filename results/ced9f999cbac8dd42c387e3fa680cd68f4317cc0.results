Three stable hematopoietic trichimeric dogs received a kidney transplant from 1 of their marrow donors 25 to 40 weeks after marrow grafting without postgraft immunosuppression [12] . All of the dogs' hematologic profiles and blood chemistries were within normal ranges. Table 1 shows that host cell contributions at the time of kidney transplantation and DLI ranged from 1% to 20% of peripheral blood granulocytes and from 16% to 50% of lymphocytes. Hematopoietic chimerism contributions from marrow donor 1 ranged from 18% to 96.9% of granulocytes and from 5% to 53% of lymphocytes, whereas those from marrow donor 2 (marrow 1 kidney) were 0.1% to 68% and 19% to 56% for the 2 respective populations. Two of the trichimeric recipients (G362 and G643) did not receive immunosuppressive therapy after day 35 after marrow grafting. Dog G513 required 15 weeks of CsA (7.5 mg/kg with taper to 2.5 mg/kg) before successful resolution of GVHD; in this dog, an additional 14 weeks elapsed between discontinuation of CsA and kidney transplantation. The kidneys were negative for lymphocytic infiltration for 17 to 23 weeks before DLI, as assessed by histological examination of needle biopsy specimens and measurement of kidney volume (Figure 2 , left column). Trichimerism remained stable and unchanged between kidney transplantation and DLI.
