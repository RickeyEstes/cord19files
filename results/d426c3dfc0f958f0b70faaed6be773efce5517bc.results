During July 1, 2014-June 30, 2017, 854,575 HCoV tests were reported by 117 laboratories in 42 states submitting to NREVSS. Overall, 18,804 (2.2%) were positive for HCoV-OC43, 8558 (1.0%) for HCoV-NL63, 7001 (0.8%) for HCoV-229E and 5225 (0.6%) for HCoV-HKU1. The number of HCoV tests submitted to NREVSS per week varied seasonally, with the testing peak occurring each year in winter, generally between December and March (Fig. 1A) . Overall HCoV testing increased during the three years (Fig. 1A) . The percent of HCoV positive tests varied throughout each year, and also peaked each year between December and March. The percent positive varied annually by HCoV species (Fig. 1B) . HCoV-OC43 demonstrated a distinct peak each of the three years, with a less pronounced peak in 2016. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 demonstrated similar patterns to one another; both had a small peak in 2015 and larger peaks in 2016, although only HCoV-NL63 had a small peak in 2017. HCoV-229E showed a slight peak in 2015, no peak in 2016 and a relatively large peak in 2017 (Fig. 1B) . The highest percent positive for any single species was 7.6% of tests positive for HCoV-OC43 in the week beginning December 31, 2016. Across each census region, minimal differences in seasonal and annual patterns of percentage of tests positive for each HCoV species were seen compared to national data (Fig. 2) . The most notable difference was in the percentage of positive HCoV-OC43 tests during the 2016-2017 season, with the West region showing a peak percent positive of 5.0% and the Midwest region showing a peak percent positive of 12.4%. Data reported to NREVSS through PHLIP was further analyzed to understand sex and age characteristics. During the study period, 20,806 specimens tested for all four HCoVs were submitted via PHLIP from six laboratories. Overall 1569 tests (7.5%) were positive for any HCoV; 852 (4.1%) were positive for HCoV-OC43, 255 (1.2%) for HCoV-NL63, 335 (1.6%) for HCoV-229E and 154 (0.7%) for HCoV-HKU1. The majority of specimens with a single HCoV detection (92.2% of 1543 specimens) included the sex of the patient, and approximately half (50.6%) of all these HCoV detections were reported as male. No significant difference was seen in the sex distribution between the four HCoVs (p = 0.19). Age was available for 1016 (67%) of specimens with a single HCoV detection and the median patient age of these specimens was 23 years (range 0-96 years). The patient age distribution of specimens with a single HCoV detection was significantly different between species (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3) . The median ages of patients with specimens testing positive for a single HCoV species were as follows: HCoV-OC43, 24 years; HCoV-NL63, 11 years; HCoV-229E, 30 years; and HCoV-HKU1, 19 years. For HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 > 45% of detections were in children < 18 years old (Fig. 3) . By contrast, 31% of HCoV-229E detections were in children < 18 years old (Fig. 3) . Among the 1569 HCoV positive detections reported via PHLIP, 1538 (98%) were also tested for parainfluenza viruses 1-4, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, human adenovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A and influenza B. Among these, 68.6% reported a single HCoV species detection only, 1.7% reported two or more HCoV species, and 30.2% detected another respiratory virus. The most common HCoV co-detections were HCoV-OC43 with HCoV-NL63 (8 specimens, 0.5%), and HCoV-OC43 with HCoV-229E (8 specimens, 0.5%). The most common co-detected non-HCoV viruses were RSV (11% of HCoV positive specimens), rhinovirus/enterovirus (6.6%), and influenza A (5.7%); 51 (3.3%) specimens had â‰¥2 viral species detected in addition to HCoV. Co-detection patterns were broadly similar among the four HCoVs (Table 1) .
