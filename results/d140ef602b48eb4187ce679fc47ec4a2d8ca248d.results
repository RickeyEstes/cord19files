Production and characteristics of BNeV VLPs and hyperimmune antiserum. The VLPs produced from the Spodoptera frugiperda ovarian (Sf9) cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus rMA415 had a size of 35 to 40 nm and appeared empty by electron microscopy (EM) due to the lack of viral nucleic acids (Fig. 1A) . Hyperimmune antiserum generated from a rabbit immunized three times with purified VLPs of rMA415 by CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation detected a specific signal by immunofluorescence in Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus rMA415 but not in wild-type baculovirus-infected SF9 cells (Fig. 1B) . Western blotting with rMA415 hyperimmune antisera detected a 58-kDa protein as expected and consistent with previous reports on other caliciviruses (48, 49) . Carbohydrate moieties act as attachment factors for BNeV. To examine whether carbohydrate moieties are used as attachment factors for BNeV, the carbohydrate moieties were removed from MDBK cells by pretreatment with sodium periodate (NaIO 4 ), which is known to remove the carbohydrate groups without altering cell surface proteins or membranes (50) . The binding of Alexa Fluor 594 (AF594)-labeled BNeV VLPs was slightly but significantly increased by pretreating the MDBK cells with 1 mM NaIO 4 but was markedly decreased with 10 mM NaIO 4 ( Fig. 2A) . Pretreatment of cells with NaIO 4 dose dependently decreased the binding of the SA-dependent FCV F9 strain, consistent with the high sensitivity of SA to periodate treatment (26) . HBGAdependent VLPs from the HuNoV strain VA387 showed a binding pattern similar to that of BNeV, indicative of binding to neutral sugars (51, 52) . However, 1 or 10 mM NaIO 4 pretreatment had no inhibitory effect on the binding of the coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) strain Nancy, which is known to use decay-accelerating factor (DAF) as a cellular receptor (7, 53) . To precisely quantify the inhibitory effect of NaIO 4 treatment, radioisotope (RI)labeled BNeV VLPs and the FCV and CVB3 strains were incubated with cells that were not pretreated or were pretreated with NaIO 4 (as mentioned above), and then the degree of binding was measured for each virus by liquid scintillation counting (28) . As expected, binding of BNeV VLPs increased to 124% with the 1 mM NaIO 4 treatment and decreased to 55% with the 10 mM NaIO 4 treatment compared with the mock-treated, VLP-inoculated control (Fig. 2B) . The binding of SA-dependent FCV was strongly decreased by both 1 and 10 mM NaIO 4 treatment, whereas DAF-dependent CVB3 was not influenced by the treatment (Fig. 2B) . Taken together, these results strongly suggest that neutral carbohydrate moieties are involved in the binding of BNeV VLPs to cells. Terminal SAs are not recognized by BNeV for attachment. SAs represent a family of sugar molecules that are found mostly at the terminal end of carbohydrates and attach to underlying glycans via ␣2,3, ␣2,6, or ␣2,8 linkages (4). Because several caliciviruses, including FCV, PSaV, and MNV, use terminal SAs as attachment factors (5, 26-28), we examined whether SAs act as attachment factors for BNeV using 100 mU Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (NA) ml Ϫ1 , which cleaves ␣2,3-, ␣2,6-, and ␣2, 8-linked SAs (26, 28) . Pretreatment of MDBK cells with NA increased the binding of AF594labeled BNeV VLPs to cells (Fig. 3A) , and the binding of RI-labeled BNeV VLPs to cells increased to 123% of the levels observed in the mock-treated cells (Fig. 3B) . A similar degree of enhanced binding was observed in the cells treated with HBGA-dependent HuNoV P particles (Fig. 3A) . However, SA-dependent FCV showed a marked reduction in cell binding, whereas with DAF-dependent CVB3 the NA pretreatment had no influence on the degree of binding to cells (Fig. 3) . These results support the notion that BNeV does not use terminal SAs as attachment factors and that it uses neutral carbohydrate motifs such as HBGAs instead. Wide binding spectrum of BNeV VLPs to HBGAs. Using a synthetic HBGA binding assay, we next determined whether HBGAs could be used as attachment factors for BNeV, as has been described for other viruses elsewhere (28, (54) (55) (56) . The BNeV VLPs strongly bound to the immobilized synthetic disaccharide (Fuc␣1,2Gal) (Fig. 4A) , a common motif in HBGAs (57) . Moreover, sialyl-Le a (SLe a ), Le y , Le x , ␣Gal, H2, H1, SLe x , A, and B type immobilized synthetic HBGA oligosaccharides interacted with the BNeV VLPs (ordered from highest to lowest binding degree) (Fig. 4A) . The recombinant FIG 1 Electron micrograph of BNeV VLPs from and detection of BNeV capsid protein in rMA415-infected insect cells by immunofluorescence assay. (A) The rMA415 VLPs were purified by CsCl gradients from the cell culture supernatants of rMA415infected Sf9 cells and visualized by negative staining with 3% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0). The panel on the right is a magnification of the panel on the left. The scale bars in the left and right panels correspond to 100 nm and 50 nm, respectively. (B) Sf9 cells were mock infected (left) or infected with rMA415. After 48 (middle) and 72 (right) h postinfection, cells were immunostained using the rabbit hyperimmune serum against BNeV capsid protein and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The scale bars for left and right panels correspond to 50 m. glutathione S-transferase (GST)-P particles of the HuNoV strain VA387 and the GST-VP8* proteins of the human rotavirus G11P [25] Dhaka6 and bovine rotavirus G6P [5] WC3 strains bound to their corresponding HBGA types, whereas the supernatant of wild-type baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and GST had no binding affinity to any HBGA (Fig. 4A) . These results indicate that BNeV VLPs recognize a wide spectrum of HBGAs. HBGA-binding moiety for BNeV VLPs. To identify HBGA-binding epitopes, we examined whether removal of each putative epitope from synthetic HBGAs by pretreatment with ␣1,2-L-fucosidase, ␣1,3/4-L-fucosidase, ␣-galactosidase, or ␣-Nacetylgalactosaminidase was able to decrease the HBGA binding of BNeV VLPs. The results showed that treatment with ␣1,2-L-fucosidase, which removes the ␣-1,2-linked fucose from galactose, significantly decreased the binding of BNeV VLPs to the H type disaccharide, H1 and H2 types, and Le y carrying an ␣1,2-linked fucose epitope (Fig. 4B) , suggesting that BNeV VLPs recognize the ␣1,2-linked fucose as an epitope. In contrast, pretreatment with ␣1,3/4-L-fucosidase resulted in a significant reduction in the binding of BNeV VLPs to SLe a , Le x , SLe x , and Le y , which all harbor the ␣1,3/4-linked fucose epitope (Fig. 4B) , confirming binding specificity for this epitope. An almost complete reduction in the binding of BNeV VLPs to Le y , containing both ␣1,2and ␣1,3/4-linked fucose epitopes, was observed by combined pretreatment of synthetic Le y with both enzymes, ␣1,2-L-fucosidase and ␣1,3/4-L-fucosidase, supporting the above-described results that BNeV VLPs recognize both ␣1,2-linked fucose and ␣1,3/4-linked fucose. Pretreatment of the Gal␣3Gal␤4GlcNAc␤ HBGA with ␣-galactosidase, which cleaves the ␣Gal epitope in Gal␣3Gal␤4GlcNAc␤ HBGA, had no inhibitory effect on the binding of BNeV VLPs to synthetic Gal␣3Gal␤4GlcNAc␤ HBGA (Fig. 4B) . However, it significantly reduced the binding of the control GST-VP8* protein of the ␣Gal-dependent bovine rotavirus P [5] WC3 strain to the synthetic Gal␣3Gal␤4GlcNAc␤ HBGA (Fig. 5) , suggesting that the ␣Gal epitope is not recognized by the BNeV VLPs. Altogether, these results suggest that BNeV VLPs recognize fucose residues in ␣1,2 and ␣1,3/4 linkages. Saliva binding profile of BNeV VLPs. Because saliva contains mucins carrying HBGAs that are similar to those expressed in the small intestine (2, 8), a saliva-binding assay was performed with the BNeV VLPs, the GST-P particles of the HuNoV strain VA387, and the GST-VP8* proteins of the bovine rotavirus P [5] strain WC3 and human rotavirus P [25] strain Dhaka6 using bovine and human saliva samples, as described elsewhere (55, 56, 58) . Prior to determining the binding affinity of BNeV VLPs in the bovine and human saliva samples, the expression levels of each HBGA in the bovine and human saliva samples were examined by enzyme immunoassays as described elsewhere (51, 52, 56) . Consistent with previous HBGA phenotyping results for bovine gastrointestinal mucosa (23), the bovine saliva samples contained individually various levels of A type, H type 2, Le y , and Gal␣3Gal␤4GlcNAc␤ HBGAs and were largely divided into two ABO blood types, H ϩ /A Ϫ /B Ϫ and H ϩ /A ϩ /B Ϫ (Fig. 6A ). In addition, the human saliva samples also had variable levels of HBGAs, in accordance with ABO and Lewis types (Fig. 6B) . Subsequently, the binding of BNeV VLPs to HBGAs in the bovine and human saliva samples was examined. The BNeV VLPs bound to HBGAs in the bovine saliva samples regardless of the contents of individual HBGAs (Fig. 6A) . As a positive control, the recombinant GST-VP8* protein of the bovine rotavirus strain WC3 bound to bovine saliva samples (Fig. 6A ). An analogous result was obtained for binding to a range of human saliva samples, regardless of the contents of individual HBGAs (Fig. 6B ). As controls, the recombinant GST-VP8* protein of the human rotavirus strain Dhaka6 preferentially bound to human saliva samples rich in A type HBGA (Fig. 7A) , whereas the recombinant GST-P particles of the HuNoV strain VA387 showed preferential binding to human saliva samples rich in A and B types of HBGAs (Fig. 7B ). All of these data are consistent with the conclusion that a broad range of HBGAs is recognized by BNeV VLPs. Binding epitopes for BNeV VLPs in the saliva samples. To identify binding epitopes in saliva HBGAs, the effect of pretreating the saliva samples with ␣1,2-L-fucosidase, ␣1,3/ 4-L-fucosidase, ␣-galactosidase, or ␣-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, either individually or in combination, was examined. Four bovine saliva samples were selected, two of which represented the H ϩ /A ϩ /B Ϫ type (samples 2 and 4) and two of which represented the H ϩ /A Ϫ /B Ϫ type (samples 6 and 10). As each bovine saliva sample expressed different levels of A type, H type 2, Le y type, and Gal␣3Gal␤4GlcNAc␤, pretreatment with individual enzymes reduced the binding of BNeV to each saliva sample only mildly (Fig.  8A ). However, pretreatment of saliva samples with a mixture of ␣1,2-L-fucosidase and ␣1,3/4-L-fucosidase resulted in greater inhibition (Fig. 8A ). In addition, pretreatment of the bovine saliva samples with ␣-galactosidase and ␣-N-acetylgalactosaminidase did not inhibit the binding of BNeV VLPs to any of the selected bovine saliva samples (Fig.  8A ), supporting the interpretation that the ␣Gal and GalNAc epitopes are not recognized by the BNeV VLPs. To assess the function of ␣-galactosidase, the inhibitory effect of ␣-galactosidase on the binding of the GST-VP8* protein of ␣Gal-dependent bovine rotavirus P [5] strain WC3 to each of the bovine saliva samples was examined.
