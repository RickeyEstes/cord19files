The Figure 1 ). All 64 sequences obtained from the HEV pig samples (GenBank accession numbers from KX092229 to KX092292) were found to belong to GT3 and clustered into three main clades ( Figure 2 ). All Vietnamese pig sequences clustered separately from the previously identified GT3 sequences circulating worldwide and the subgenotypes did not cluster with any previously known subgenotype (Figure 2 ). The anti-HEV IgG unadjusted seroprevalence was lower in the farmer cohort (16.0%; 95% CI: 11.7%-20.2%) than the general population (31.7%, 95% CI: 29.5%-33.8%) in Dong Thap (Table 1, Figure 1 ). There was no difference in seroprevalence by gender in either sample set. Although the seroprevalence in both populations increased with age, the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG was higher in children in the hospital population than in children enrolled in the farm cohort study (Figure 3 ). Breaking the comparisons into 10year-age bands, the hospital population had higher HEV seroprevalence for individuals aged 0-20 (both p < .001; one-way test on ELISA optical density); HEV seroprevalence was indistinguishable between the two groups when considering individuals aged >20 years (all p > .06) (Figure 3 ). HEV seroprevalence did not vary through time in the hospital population cohort. Due to the small sample size (n = 29) of farms with both molecular diagnostics on pigs and farmer plasma samples, there was insufficient statistical power to determine if there was a positive correlation between HEV RNA-positive pigs and seropositive farmers (Spearman pvalue = .38).
