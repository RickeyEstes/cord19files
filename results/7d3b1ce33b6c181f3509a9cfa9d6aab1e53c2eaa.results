From 2006 to 2008, 690 dengue PCR positive cases were reviewed. Males comprised 493 (71%) of the cases, and the median age of the cohort was 35 years (IQR: 27-43 years). A Charlson comorbidity index $3, which predicts increased one-year mortality [19] , was noted in 5 (0.7%) patients. With WHO 1997 classification, 62% had DF, 31% DHF, and 7% DSS. With WHO 2009 classification, 14% had dengue, 62% had dengue with warning signs, and 24% had severe dengue. Hence, by WHO 1997 classification, 38% of patients with DHF/DSS needed close monitoring, while by WHO 2009 classification, 86% of patients with warning signs or severe dengue required close monitoring. Median length of illness from onset to hospital presentation was 4 days (IQR: 3-5 days), while median length of hospital stay was 5 days (IQR: 4-6 days). Intravenous fluid was administered to 641 (93%) and platelet transfusion to 86 (12%). Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was required in 3 patients, and death occurred in 1 patient due to pneumonia. (1) Elevation of AST/ALT and risk of liver failure Overall, 595 (86%) had AST above the ULN, and 316 (46%) had ALT above the ULN. Seven patients (1.0%) had severe dengue according to WHO 2009 criteria concurrent with AST or ALT$1000 U/L while three additional patients had severe dengue due to AST or ALT$1000 U/L only. Of the former seven patients, 86% had severe plasma leakage, 29% had severe bleeding, and none had severe organ impairment other than isolated AST or ALT$1000 U/L. Among the 3 patients admitted to the ICU, AST or ALT values were above the ULN but below 1000 U/L. No patients in our cohort developed acute liver failure under AASLD or King's College criteria. With Child-Pugh scoring, 2 (0.3%) belonged to Child-Pugh class C. With MELD scoring, predicted three-month mortality of 6% were identified in 68 (10%)
