The pafB gene transcription. Our efforts failed so far to identify PAFB in the supernatant or cell extracts of P. chrysogenum Q176 grown under standard conditions (shaking culture in minimal medium MM at 25 °C for up to 6 days) (Fig. 1) . The same was true for the P. chrysogenum strain ∆paf that lacks the PAF-encoding gene 21 . We examined this mutant to increase the chance to identify PAFB in the absence of PAF (data not shown). Therefore, we performed Northern blot analyses to determine the abundance and timing of pafB transcription. Surprisingly, we found that pafB mRNA was detectable in P. chrysogenum Q176 shaking cultures with an expression maximum at 48 h after inoculation and a subsequent decrease in transcript amount upon further incubation time (Fig. 1a) . In contrast, gene transcripts of paf could be detected from 48 h after inoculation onwards and transcription reached its maximum at 72 h (Fig. 1b) . This expression pattern correlated with the secretion of PAF protein into the culture broth of P. chrysogenum Q176 during the stationary growth phase as reported 14 . This result was confirmed by Western blot by using a specific anti-PAF antibody 22 (Fig. 1c , Supplementary Methods). Incorrect mRNA processing could result in defective protein translation and the production of nonsense protein products that are readily degraded 23, 24 . Therefore, we next investigated if the pafB mRNA was correctly spliced. The verification of the pafB mRNA sequence was done by cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification of the pafB specific transcript and subsequent Sanger sequencing. The obtained sequence matched that of the exons of the pafB fragment (Pc24g00380) from the P. chrysogenum Wisconsin 54-1255 genome 4 and yielded an intact pafB open reading frame indicating correct splicing ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Similar to the paf gene 14 , two short introns (63 nt and 62 nt in length, respectively) are present in pafB that contain the consensus 5′-splice donor site (GT) and the consensus 3′-splice acceptor site (AG). A consensus sequence for the internal putative lariat formation element (RCTRAC) can be found in the first intron, but not in the second non-coding sequence ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The nt sequence of the pafB cDNA (deposited at European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), accession no. LT854946) codes for a 92 aa protein (Supplementary Table S1 ). Comparison of the PAFB primary sequence with that of the orthologous PgAFP revealed that PAFB differed in three aa, resulting in 97% identity of both proteins (Fig. 2) . A histidine to glutamine substitution at position 2 resides in the pre-sequence, serine to asparagine and threonine to arginine substitutions at positions 19 and 23, respectively, occur in the pro-sequence (Fig. 2a) . The predicted mature PAFB protein exhibited 100% identity with the mature PgAFP (Fig. 2b) . The similarity of PAFB with PAF was 43% for the prepro-proteins and 35% for the mature proteins (Fig. 2b) . Recombinant expression and purification of PAFB. As we could not detect and isolate PAFB from the P. chrysogenum Q176 culture supernatant, we employed the P. chrysogenum-based expression system 20 to produce recombinant PAFB for structural analysis and functional tests. To this end, the P. chrysogenum Δpaf strain was transformed with a PstI-linearized plasmid carrying the pafB gene under the control of the strong paf promoter 20 . Positively transformed, ptrA-resistant P. chrysogenum clones were tested for highest protein secretion over a time course of 96 h using small-scale fermentation (data not shown). Southern blot experiments with the best PAFB producer clone (P. chrysogenum pafB) revealed multiple random integration events of the transforming DNA into the fungal genome ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). This clone was selected and cultivated under large scale culture conditions. PAFB was purified from the cell-free culture broth by a single-step chromatography. A protein yield of 61 ± 11 mg/L supernatant was reached. Purity and identity of PAFB were verified by sodium-dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), respectively (Fig. 3) . On the SDS-PA gels one single band for PAFB was visible in the elution fractions (Fig. 3a) . ESI-MS detected one main peak corresponding to an average mass of 6.49 kDa, which represented full-length PAFB (Fig. 3b) . Two smaller peaks corresponding to 6.37 kDa and 6.29 kDa correlated with two N-terminally truncated PAFB forms: the 6.37 kDa peak corresponded to a variant without the N-terminal leucine and the 6.29 kDa peak to a form that lacked the N-terminal residues leucine and serine ( Fig. 3b; Supplementary Table S1 ). The average molecular masses of all three peaks matched the calculated theoretical molecular masses (ProtParam tool of ExPASy) 25 of the oxidized protein forms indicating the presence of three intra-molecular disulphide bonds in all three PAFB protein variants. They all lacked any post-translational modifications, except for the cleavage of the prepro-sequence, as reported for wild-type PAF 20 . We used the purified recombinant PAFB to generate polyclonal anti-PAFB antibodies with the aim to identify PAFB at higher specificity and sensitivity in the supernatant and cell extract of P. chrysogenum Q176 shaking cultures by Western blot technique (Supplementary Methods). The polyclonal anti-PAFB antibodies specifically recognized recombinant PAFB, but not PAF in Western blots ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). However, no PAFB-specific signals could be identified in the P. chrysogenum supernatants and cell extracts at the growth conditions applied, supporting our observation that PAFB was not present at concentrations that were sufficient for detection, although its encoding gene was transcribed ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ).
