Review selection, study characteristics and quality assessment Review selection The flow chart representing study selection, including reasons for exclusion, is summarised in Fig. 1 .

Additional file 4 provides a list of citations for the excluded studies in the final stage of the selection process, as well as a table describing the characteristics of the 12 studies excluded only on the basis of not having presented a methodological assessment of the quality of the included articles.
