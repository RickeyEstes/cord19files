Genetic Characterization. The epidemiological aspects of field studies of dromedary camels in Morocco, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, and Nigeria, including seroprevalence and RT-PCR detection of virus from nasal swabs, have been reported previously (6, 7) . An additional 102 nasal swabs were collected in the Afar region of Ethiopia in 2017. Of 173 RT-PCR-positive specimens detected in these studies, those with high viral load were selected, attempting to maximize diversity in geography and sampling dates, for full viral genome sequencing directly from the clinical specimen and for virus isolation (Dataset S1). Three viruses from Burkina Faso, one from Morocco, nine from Nigeria, and three from Ethiopia were fully sequenced, and an additional virus from Ethiopia was sequenced from the S2 gene region to the 3′ end of the genome (5,126 nt) . Genetic nucleotide identity was 99.17% within African camel virus genomes, >99.26% within human and camel MERS-CoV from the Middle East, and 99. .58% between viruses from the Middle East and Africa (GenBank accession nos: MG923465-MG923481). Phylogenetic analysis of these and other relevant viruses is shown in Fig. 1 . The tree was rooted against a MERS-CoVrelated bat coronavirus Neoromicia/PML-PHE/RSA/2011 (8) . Viruses from Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Morocco, and Ethiopia formed a monophyletic clade together with previously sequenced viruses from Egypt, which we now provisionally designate as virus "clade C." A time-resolved phylogeny of currently available MERS-CoV sequences, including those generated in this study from diverse parts of Africa, is shown in Fig. S1 . An analysis of synapomorphies (mutations inferred to have occurred once in the tree), homoplasies (repeat mutations), and reversions within available MERS-CoV full-genome sequences is shown in Fig. S2 . Viruses from Burkina Faso (n = 3), Morocco (n = 1), and Nigeria (n = 9) had signature deletions in the ORF4b and/or ORF3 gene regions ( Fig. S3 ) and are designated "clade C1" (Fig. 1 ). Clade C viruses from Ethiopia (n = 4) and Egypt (n = 3) did not have such gene deletions, nor do the majority of viruses from the Arabian Peninsula. However, sequences of two clade B human viruses detected in 2012 (Riyadh_1_2012 and Bisha_1_2012) available in public databases also have short (17-nt) deletions in the ORF4b region in a similar, although not identical, region as the African isolates (Fig. S3 ). Targeted sequencing of the ORF3/4b gene region was done on additional African camel viruses from which full genomes could not be obtained because viral load was too low. Overall, all 10 additional viruses from Burkina Faso carried these same signature deletions, frame shift mutations, or premature stop-codons that markedly reduced the size of the ORF4b, but none of the 10 additional viruses from Ethiopia did so (Fig. S3 ). Clade C1 viruses with ORF4b deletions appear to share a common ancestor, with a 6-nt and a 360-nt deletion in ORF4b denoted as the "ancestral type i ORF4b deletion" in the phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 1 ) and in the schematic of the deletion (Fig. S3 ). This deletion has been added to progressively, and these deletions are denoted as "ii," "iii," "iv," and "v" along the branches of the phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 1 ) and the schematic (Fig. S3 ). Some of these viruses (Nigeria/HKU NV1657-like and Burkina Faso/CIRAD-HKU697-like) have also acquired deletions in ORF3. Notably, the Ethiopian and Egyptian viruses encoded a full-length ORF3. The impact of the different ORF4b deletion events on the functional domains of the putative protein are shown in Fig. S4 . The type i/v deletion found in BF785 and BF434 viruses truncated the ORF4b protein from 246 aa found in the EMC prototype MERS-CoV EMC to 14 aa, deleting the whole of the nuclear localization signal as well as the enzymatic domain that cleaves 2′,5′-oligoadenylate (9) . Nig1657 retains the nuclear localization signal and part of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain and is truncated to 71 aa. All these deletions disrupt the PDE catalytic site. ORF4b encoded a polypeptide known to be an IFN antagonist (10, 11) . The N-terminal region of ORF4b encodes the nuclear localization signal. Deletion of this region abrogated nuclear localization and led to a loss of suppression of IFN-β induction via the IRF3-and IRF7-signaling pathways. However, it did not affect suppression of IFN-β via Tank-binding kinase 1 and IκB kinase, which was demonstrated in transient transfection experiments and appears to be mediated by the C-terminal domain of ORF4b (10) . These data come from ORF4b protein overexpression and may or may not be physiologically relevant. The two Saudi Arabian clade B viruses Riyadh_1 and Bisha_1 had less extensive deletions of the PDE domain, although they also disrupt the PDE catalytic site. Deletions and insertions at the 3′ end of ORF3 from viruses from Nigeria (including Nig1657) and five viruses from Burkina Faso (BF697, BF698, BF748, BF750, and BF764) resulted in the truncation of the 103-aa ORF3 polypeptide to 98, 88, or 84 aa (Fig. S3 ). The ORF3 deletions occurred only in those viruses from Nigeria with type i/ii ORF4b deletions and in some viruses from Burkina Faso with type i/iii ORF4b deletions. These deletions occurred near the 3′ end of ORF4b and ORF3 and did not affect the integrity of transcription regulator sequences (12) of downstream genes. They are therefore unlikely to affect the transcription of subgenomic RNAs. The amino acid residues of AH13, Nig1657, and BF785 that differ from the prototype clade A MERS-CoV strain EMC occur throughout the virus genome (Dataset S2). The amino acid sequence of the Egyptian virus NRCE-HKU270, an East African virus most closely related to the West African clade C1 viruses, is also included for comparison. The amino acid residues in the receptor-binding domain of the spike proteins of the BF785 had amino acid substitution T424I, while Nig1657 had amino acid substitutions L495F and L588F. None of these amino acid substitutions was at the receptor-interacting interface of the spike protein and thus likely did not affect the affinity of the protein for the host receptor, although L495F is close to the interacting interface. The antigenic similarity of BF785 and Nig1657 was compared with prototype strain EMC, AH13, and Egypt NRCE-HKU270 by microneutralization tests using serum from a dromedary camel immunized with a vaccinia-vectored MERS-CoV strain EMC spike vaccine (provided by B. L. Haagmans, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam) (13) and two fieldcollected dromedary camel sera from Saudi Arabia (Table S1) . Each serum neutralized all MERS-CoV to titer dilutions twofold or less than observed with prototype virus EMC. . A representative dromedary virus, BF785, with ORF4b deletion type i/v, the most extensive deletion of ORF4b without any ORF3 indel, and Nig1657, with partial deletion of ORF4b (type i/ii) together with an ORF3 deletion, were selected for detailed phenotypic characterization. We confirmed that the limited passage of virus isolates in cell culture had not extended the ORF deletions observed in direct sequences from the specimen. These viruses were compared with the prototype MERS-CoV EMC strain (clade A) and a dromedary virus isolated in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia AH13 (clade B). Neither EMC nor AH13 has truncations in ORF4b or ORF3. Calu-3 cells, a human adenocarcinoma cell line of bronchial epithelial origin that retains innate immune function, were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. EMC and AH13 strains replicated comparably with each other, while BF785 and Nig1657 replicated to significantly lower titer at 24 and 48 h postinfection ( Fig. 2A) and area-under-curve (AUC) analysis (Fig. S5A) . Similar observations were made in Calu-3 cells infected at an MOI of 0.1 with EMC, AH13, and BF785 viruses (Fig. S5 B and C) . In experimentally infected C57BL/6 mice made susceptible to infection with MERS-CoV by transducing the human dipeptidyl peptidase receptor (hDPP4) using an adenovirus type 5 vector expressing hDPP4 (14), BF785 viral titers in the lung were significantly lower than EMC or AH13 virus titers at both day 3 and day 5 post infection, the difference in viral titers being >2log 10 at 3 d post infection (Fig.  2B ), although histology did not reveal obvious differences in pathology (Fig. S6 ). MERS-CoV BF785 and Nig1657 replicated less efficiently than EMC in ex vivo cultures (15) of human bronchus and lung ( Fig. 2C; Fig. S5D shows the AUC). The immunohistochemistry of infected human bronchus and lung did not reveal any obvious difference in tropism (Fig. S5E) . A genetic feature observed in BF785 and Nig1657 was the deletion in ORF4b. ORF4b gives rise to a gene product that is reportedly associated with evasion of host cell IFN defense mechanisms (10, 11) , and these deletions would be expected to impact ORF4b function. We therefore compared innate immune responses elicited in Calu-3 cells by infection with EMC, AH13, BF785 (which has most of its ORF4b gene deleted), and Nig1657 (which has ORF4b partially deleted as well as an ORF3 deletion) viruses after infection at an MOI of 2 (Fig. 3) . A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, A/HK/483/1995(H5N1), was used as a positive control of cytokine and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. UpE gene expression in MERS-CoV-infected cells confirmed that BF785 and Nig1657 had lower replication than EMC and AH13 (Fig. 3A) . IFN-β, IFN-λ1/IL-29, IP-10 (CXCL10), ISG15, and Mx1 mRNA expression was strongly up-regulated as early as 24 h post infection in H5N1-infected cells, at which time there was minimal induction of these genes in MERS-CoV-infected cells (Fig. 3 B-G) . By 48 h after infection IFN-β, IFN-λ1/IL-29, IP10 (CXCL-10), ISG15, MX1, and TNF-α mRNA was detectable in cells infected with all (A) Calu-3 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.01, and virus titers in culture supernatants were determined by the 50% tissue culture infective dose per milliliter (TCID 50 ) assay. The horizontal dotted line denotes the limit of detection in the TCID 50 assay. Statistical significance was determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's correction: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 compared with EMC; ###, P < 0.001 compared with AH13; +, P < 0.05; +++, P < 0.001 compared with BF785. Each experiment was repeated once, and one representative experiment is shown. (B) Ad5-hDPP4-transduced C57BL/ 6 mice (7 wk old, female) were infected intranasally with 1 × 10 4 pfu of MERS-CoV strains EMC, AH13, or BF785. Virus titers in the lungs were measured. The horizontal dotted line denotes the limit of detection. Titers are expressed as pfu per gram of tissue. n = 3 mice per group at each time point. Statistical significance was determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's comparisons: ***P < 0.001 compared with EMC; ###, P < 0.001 compared with AH13. (C and D) Comparison of virus replication and tropism of MERS-CoV EMC, BF785, and Nig1657 in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus (C) and lung (D). Virus titers in culture supernatants were determined by TCID 50 assay. Data are the means and SEM of three individual tissue donors. The horizontal dotted line denotes the limit of detection in the TCID 50 assay. Statistical significance was determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's comparisons: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01 compared with EMC. four MERS-CoV isolates, but levels remained markedly lower than in H5N1-infected cells. IFN-β, IFN-λ1/IL-29, and IP-10 (CXCL-10) mRNA in BF785-infected cells was significantly higher than that seen in EMC but was not higher than in AH13-infected cells. Nig1657-infected cells had significantly lower levels of IFN-β, IFN-λ1/IL-29, IP10 (CXCL-10), ISG15, and MX1 mRNA compared with AH13-or BF785-infected cells (Fig. 3 B-F) . IP-10 (CXCL10) protein levels in the supernatants of the four MERS-CoV-infected cells were below the limits of detection or were very low compared with H5N1-infected cells (Fig. 3H) . We also investigated the sensitivity of the four MERS-CoV to increasing concentrations of IFN-β in Vero cells and found no biologically relevant difference between the Saudi Arabian and African viruses (Fig. S7 ). All four MERS-CoV were markedly more sensitive to IFN-β than has been reported for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (16) . Phenotype of ΔORF4b EMC Virus. To directly address whether the ORF4b deletion affects viral replication competence, we used reverse genetics to derive a recombinant EMC virus carrying the ORF4b deletion (rgEMCΔ4b) and compared this with an isogenic recombinant wild-type virus (rgEMC-WT). Replication competence of rgEMCΔ4b virus in Calu-3 cells infected at an MOI of 0.01 was not significantly different from rgEMC-WT virus as assessed by infectious virus titers at 24 h post infection, although it was reduced at 48 and 72 h post infection (Fig. 4A) . In Calu-3 cells infected at an MOI of 2.0, viral UpE gene expression was comparable or lower in rgEMCΔ4b-infected cells (Fig. 4B ), but the expression of IFN-β, IFN-λ1/IL-29, CXCL10 (IP-10), ISG15, Mx1, and TNF-α was significantly higher (Fig. 4C and Fig. S8 ).
