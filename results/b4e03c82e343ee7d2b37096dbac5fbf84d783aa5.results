Conversion of a non-functional short pseudoknot to a functional`k inked'' pseudoknot In our previous investigation of the in¯uence of IBV pseudoknot S1 length on frameshift ef®ciency, we made a series of constructs (the pKA series) encoding pseudoknots with different S1 lengths containing only GÁC (or CÁG) pairs (Napthine et al., 1999) . Two of the shorter constructs, pKA3 (5 bp S1) and pKA5 (6 bp S1), were the starting point for the present analysis and are shown in Figures 1 and 3 . The pKA3 construct ( Figure 1 ) is a frameshift reporter construct containing a short IBV-based pseudoknot cloned into the in¯uenza A/PR8/34 gene (Young et al., 1983 ) at a unique BglII site. The position of the pseudoknot in this construct is just upstream of a region of the PB2 gene where signi®cant lengths of open reading frame are present in all three frames. A frameshift into any one of these frames generates a product with a characteristic size (22, 28 or 85 kDa). This property was important for the analysis described here, since we wished to introduce single or pairs of nucleotides into the pseudoknot, which would change the exit phase of À1 frameshifted ribosomes. For pKA3-derived plasmids, ribosomes which terminate without frameshifting synthesise a 19 kDa non-frameshifted species. Ribosomes which undergo À1 frameshifting at the slippery sequence continue translation to produce a À1 frameshift product whose size is 22 kDa, 28 kDa or 85 kDa depending upon the exit reading frame, which is determined by the number of nucleotides introduced into S1. The inability of constructs like pKA3 and pKA5 to stimulate frameshifting was puzzling, since some of the highly ef®cient pseudoknots present at other viral frameshift sites are predicted to have similar S1 lengths (5 or 6 bp). Studies on the MMTV pseudoknot (Chen et al., 1995) have highlighted the functional importance of an intercalated, unpaired A nucleotide located between the two stems. The most likely explanation for the functional de®cit of pKA3 and pKA5 was thus their lack of such an unpaired A at the stem-stem junction, and we suspected that they could be rendered functional by providing this base. As indicated in Table 1 , however, inclusion of an A residue between S1 and S2 of pKA3 or pKA5 (to create pKA35 and pKA36) did not stimulate frameshifting and additional changes were therefore necessary. On the basis of published pseudoknot sequences, mutational analysis of the MMTV frameshift signal (Chen et al., 1995) and our own studies of the IBV pseudoknot stacking region (Brierley et al., 1991) , we suspected that the bases¯anking the intercalated A residue were inappropriate, and would not allow correct folding of the pseudoknot. For this reason, we tested a variety of paired and unpaired G and C residues at the top of S1 or bottom of S2 within the context of a pseudoknot containing either a 5 bp (constructs pKA35, 42, 44, 45, 53) or 6 bp S1 (constructs pKA36, 43, 46, 47, 48, 51) . Once again we were unable to prepare a structure which promoted ef®cient frameshifting. Variants of pKA35 and 36 with a 5 bp S2 were also inactive (pKA37, 38). We continued the search, concentrating on spacer length and loop nucleotides. Increasing the spacer distance from 6 to 7 nt (the same length of spacer as present at the MMTV gag/pro frameshift signal) led to a small increase in frameshifting in an RNA with a 6 bp S1 (pKA-G, 5 %). Alteration of the L1 nucleotides (5 H CA 3 H ) to either 5 H AA 3 H (pKA58, 60, 61) or a single A residue (pKA59, 62), within the context of a 6 or 7 nt spacer had no Figure 1 . The frameshift reporter construct pKA3. Plasmid pKA3 (Napthine et al., 1999; see Figure 3 ) contains a short, IBV-derived pseudoknot (white box) cloned into a reporter gene, the in¯uenza PB2 gene (shaded boxes). Linearisation of the plasmid with BamH1 and in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase yields an mRNA (2.4 kb) that, when translated in RRL, produces a 19 kDa non-frameshift product corresponding to ribosomes that terminate at the UGA termination codon (located immediately downstream of the slippery sequence UUUAAAC, shaded), and an 28 kDa À1 frameshift product. The 0-frame and À2/ 1 frames are also open (to some extent) in this construct. Ribosomes which enter these frames produce 85 kDa and 22 kDa products, respectively. A bacteriophage T7 promoter is present just upstream of the frameshift region; this promoter is employed to generate short, pseudoknot-containing transcripts from HindIII-digested templates for secondary structure analysis. Loop-Helix Interaction in an RNA Pseudoknot speci®c effect on frameshifting. When the spacer distance was 6 nt, frameshifting was very inef®cient (pKA61, 62; <2 %); constructs with a 7 nt spacer were slightly more active (pKA58, 59; 3 %). Having failed to restore functionality with the above approaches, we turned our attention to changes in L2, which proved to be more fruitful.
