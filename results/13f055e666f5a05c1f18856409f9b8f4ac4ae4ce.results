Expression and characterization of the CRD from mouse LSECtin LSECtin is a type 2 transmembrane protein in which the C-type CRD resides at the C-terminal end of the protein ( Figure 1A ). An initial survey of the distribution of LSECtin expression was undertaken using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify the LSECtin-coding region from a panel of cDNAs with a pair of primers that lie just outside the protein-coding region at each end ( Figure 1B) . Expression was detected exclusively in the liver, as was previously observed for human LSECtin in a survey of a similar set of human tissues (Liu et al. 2004 ). This distribution is consistent with the idea that mouse LSECtin performs a function similar to human LSECtin in sinusoidal endothelial cells, although it was not possible to document expression in lymph node as well because of the difficulty of obtaining a suitable cDNA library. The CRD from mouse LSECtin was initially expressed in a bacterial system previously used for production of the human protein (Powlesland et al. 2008) , in which the portion of the cDNA encoding the CRD is inserted immediately after the bacterial ompA signal sequence. The signal sequence allows folding of the CRD in the periplasm, so the protein could be extracted and purified directly by affinity chromatography on immobilized sugars (data not shown). However, for the mouse CRD, more efficient expression was obtained by production of the CRD as inclusion bodies that were dissolved in guanidine hydrochloride and renatured by dilution and dialysis ( Figure 1C ). Similar yields were obtained by purification on either fucose-or mannose-Sepharose. However, due to the relatively weak affinity of individual CRDs for the monosaccharide ligands, a 10-mL column was required to achieve effective purification. The CRD was used directly in the solidphase binding assays. For characterization of the binding specificity of mouse LSECtin by glycan array analysis, a tetrameric form of the CRD was created by attaching a C-terminal biotinylation sequence to the CRD and co-expressing the CRD and biotin ligase ( Figure 2A ). The resulting protein was purified by affinity chromatography as for the untagged protein. Incubation of an excess of biotin-tagged CRD with fluorescently labeled streptavidin resulted in formation of tetramers that could be purified away from uncomplexed CRDs by re-chromatography on a fucose-Sepharose. The tetrameric protein is efficiently retained on a 1-mL affinity column, whereas uncomplexed CRD washes through. The bound CRD-streptavidin complex was then eluted from the affinity column with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) ( Figure 2B ). Probing of version 4.0 of the glycan array created by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics revealed strong signals for a very selected subset of glycans ( Figure 2C ). The common feature of all of these glycan is the presence of terminal GlcNAcβ1-2Man disaccharides. Every oligosaccharide that gives a positive signal on the array contains one or more such terminal structures. Only two glycans that contain terminal GlcNAcβ1-2Man yield poor signals on the array, and in each case, these are bi-antennary oligosaccharides in which one branch is extended, which may lead to steric hindrance of binding of the remaining exposed GlcNAcβ1-2Man group. The specificity of mouse LSECtin for the GlcNAcβ1-2Man disaccharide was further demonstrated in competition binding assays ( Figure 3A and Table I ). In these experiments, the CRD was immobilized on polystyrene wells and probed with 125 I-labelled mannose-bovine serum albumin (BSA), a neoglycoprotein ligand with a high density of terminal mannose residues.
