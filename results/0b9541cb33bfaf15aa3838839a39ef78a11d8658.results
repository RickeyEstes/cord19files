The methods of analysis have been applied to the data obtained on the observed indicators as described in the previous section. These methods produce positive, negative, and non-existent coincidences of observed indicators with the concepts represented by them for each of the investigated actor groups involved in orphan drug development ( Table 1) . Comparison of the reported coincidences of an indicator with the concept it represents between the actor groups involved provides insight into the degree of consensus about the prevalence of the coincidence of that indicator with the concept it represents. After making such comparisons for all observed indicators, it is possible to determine the shared view of all actor groups to the barriers in the development of orphan drugs. In theory (Fig. 3) , the willingness to contribute to orphan drug development is expected to be influenced positively by non-financial benefits, image, and trialability of orphan drug development. The financial risks and complexity of orphan drug development are expected to negatively influence this willingness. Consequently, these five causal concepts become barriers to orphan drug development if non-financial benefits, image, and trialability have relatively low scores and financial risk and complexity have relatively high scores. Owing to the multi-faceted empirical appearances of these causal concepts depending on the context of technology or technological field investigated, these five concepts have been operationalized in this study according to the 20 empirical indicators reported in Table 1 . Consequently, 20 potential barriers are indicated in this study of orphan drug development in the Netherlands. As can be seen in Table 1 , all actor groups share only four perceived barriers to orphan drug development: facilitating registration, granting market exclusivity, knowledge of pathogenesis, and clinical trials. However, they still differ in the importance assigned to most of these shared barriers. Regarding the sixteen other barriers, the three groups do not have a shared view on their existence. In addition, with respect to the knowledge-sharing barrier there is a marked difference in perceptions of its existence and effects on the complexity of orphan drug development between the producers and consumers on one hand and the regulators on the other hand. A more detailed account of these results is given below. The lack of a shared view on 80% of the empirical barriers to orphan drug development represents a superseding barrier for this willingness to develop orphan drugs. Without a shared view on (the majority of) the barriers for increasing the willingness to contribute to orphan drug development, concerted actions to overcome these barriers by the three actor groups are unlikely to be jointly undertaken. This makes a further discussion of the effectiveness of such concerted actions to diminish the barriers obsolete. The willingness to contribute to orphan drug development within the producer and regulator groups is just a little positive reflecting intentions rather than actions. Within the consumer group there is disagreement about the willingness to contribute to orphan drug development. The regulators and consumers consider the financial risk of orphan drug development to be an enormous amount of the development costs. However, producers think quite different: they are acquainted with the relatively large costs of any drug development, but the small revenues that are expected from orphan drugs is more of a concern. The non-financial benefits of orphan drug development are considered to be negatively affected by the relatively small scale of production and the extra efforts needed to service its small market niches by the producers. Consumers think that the small scale of production improves the non-financial benefits of orphan drug development because they will mostly be produced by small biopharmaceutical enterprises. But most of these enterprises lack the financial resources to boost production and to develop market niches to a maximum to generate profitable economies of scale. Both producers and consumers stress the importance of getting help from governmental agencies in the form of achieving orphan drug status under the EODR and subsequently facilitating registration of and granting market exclusivity for orphan drugs. The regulators agree with the significance of the latter two measures but consider their contribution to be less important. This may be attributed to the fact that the regulators do not fully recognize the urgency of achieving the orphan drug status, which is perceived by producers as a necessary condition for developing orphan drugs, as a crucial non-financial benefit stimulating the willingness to develop orphan drugs. The improvement of the image of pharmaceutical companies due to actual orphan drug development and their cooperation with patients' organizations and medi-cal (research) institutions to gain societal support for burden sharing are perceived as important by the producers and consumers of orphan drugs but not by the regulators. The complexity of orphan drug development is rather high according to the producers and regulators owing to a lack of knowledge about their pathogenesis and a lack of suitable animal models. Consumers think less negatively about this complexity because they can contribute actively to the knowledge-base concerning orphan diseases. The regulators think that the available knowledge about financial support measures and registration procedures are widespread and shared, although the producers are less optimistic about this. With respect to knowledge sharing regarding orphan drug development, producers and consumers both think that this happens on a moderate but increasing scale, indicating the complexity of orphan drug development. Producers and consumers already participating in the development trajectory of orphan drugs also perceive knowledge sharing to increase the problem of complexity. Probably they foresee that knowledge sharing will further complicate the organization of orphan drug development with a negative marginal improvement of the development trajectory. Regulators think quite differently about this: they perceive a lack of knowledge about orphan diseases and orphan drug development within pharmaceutical companies and think that knowledge sharing needs to be stimulated to reduce the complexity of orphan drug development. As if those companies are not already cooperating and sharing knowledge with academic hospitals and research institutes. All actor groups involved in orphan drug development perceive the trialability of orphan drugs to depend on the possibilities of conducting clinical trials. Additionally, producers stress the importance of the participation of patients' organizations in these trials. But, consumers do not yet consider the importance of such a role for patients' organizations in orphan drug development. What can now be concluded about the perceptions of barriers to orphan drug development in the Netherlands that are held and shared among the three actor groups involved? Barriers perceived by the producers are: little expected revenues from an orphan drug due to serving only market niches by means of small-scale production; little support from the regulators in realizing these small expected revenues by helping the producers with achieving the orphan drug status, thereby subsidizing research and development costs, facilitating the registration of the drug, granting market exclusivity for the drug and subsi-dizing the use of the drug; little image improvement due to the small number of orphan drug approvals by 2005; little knowledge of the pathogenesis of orphan diseases and, subsequently, of suitable animal models in clinical trials; and low participation of patients and patients' organizations in clinical trials. The barrier of the financial risk of non-profitable orphan drugs is also recognized by the regulators as being due to little expected revenues of an orphan drug. The regulator-related barrier of producers requiring help to secure the small revenues from an orphan drug is not recognized as such by the regulators. In addition, the regulator-related barrier of image improvement due to the approval of orphan drugs is not sufficiently recognized as a barrier by the regulators. With respect to the knowledge-and testing-related barriers, all actor groups agree on their existence and the need for increased patient participation to lower these barriers. But regulators and consumers are not yet convinced that patients' organizations have a crucial role in promoting and continuing patient participation in knowledge creation and drug testing. In summary, the presented results indicate that especially lowering the barriers related to the regulators and consumers could help to secure and improve expected revenues from orphan drug development by producers. The derived causal order between the indicators of the innovation barriers derived from the adoption factors related to orphan drug development as argued above could be tested. This is done by assessing the correlations between these indicators according to the derived causal order as path coefficients in the causal sense. The assessment of correlations between indicators has been carried out as described in Section 4.3. The resulting path coefficients are presented in Fig. 5 as causal effects indicated by thin arrows accompanied by their sign. Via their coherence with the concept they represent, which is indicated by the thick arrows and the associated signs in Fig. 5 , the causal effects of the indicators of innovation barriers on the willingness to develop orphan drugs can be assessed. In addition, the actor groups most concerned with particular subsets of barriers are also indicated in Fig. 5 . Although it was not investigated as an indicator of one of the concepts, the approval of a drug is included as an indicator to Fig. 5 . It is included because it is the outcome of registration procedures based on the results of clinical trials and represents a necessary condition for generating revenue from drug development. A few other coincidences of indicators with the concepts they represent (as mentioned in Table 1 ) and associated non-zero correlations among indicators are not presented in Fig. 5 . These concern the non-coincidence of a prolonged patent period and the non-financial benefits for producers, the positive coincidences of image and cooperation with medical institutions and public health organizations, and the coincidence of knowledge sharing and complexity for which there was disagreement. The cooperation between producers and medical institutions is implicitly taken into account by putting medical institutions into the category of producers due to their tight relationships with universities, research institutes, and pharmaceutical companies. The cooperation between knowledge sharing and complexity is not taken into account because the regulator-driven effects in Fig. 5 imply this cooperation. The results shown in Fig. 5 support the derived causal ordering of the barriers to increasing willingness to develop orphan drugs from good intentions to actions, namely: (1) A high financial risk due to large development costs, small expected revenues and no realized approval of orphan drugs. The costs of orphan drug development are large due to the small scale of production, small market niches to be served and little subsidiary payments of research costs by the regulators (i.e. the government). Small expected revenues are perceived to be due to uncertainty about granting market exclusivity and the absence of an agreement until 2003 about subsidiary payments by the regulators (i.e. insurance companies) to consumers to reduce the costs of use. 10 Furthermore, until 2004, only a few orphan drugs had been approved by public health organizations. This is mostly due to problems concerning their registration. (2) The perception of small non-financial benefits from developing orphan drugs because of a required scale of production that is smaller than and different from conventional drug production, the need to serve market niches, which differs from serving a large consumer market for conventional drugs, and the prevailing uncertainties concerning registration, market exclusivity, and subsidiary payments for research. (Pharmacos, 2005) . (4) A high degree of complexity concerning orphan drug development owing to a lack of knowledge about the pathogenesis of orphan diseases, suitable animal models and patient participation in clinical trials (e.g. 10 versus 10,000 patients). Furthermore, orphan drug development takes place in an international setting, due to the relatively few internationally oriented pharmaceutical companies and start-ups actually involved in orphan drugs development (e.g. Genzyme (USA), Novartis (Switzerland), Bayer Healthcare (Germany), Amgen (USA), Pfizer (USA), Actelion (UK)), thereby further increasing the complexity of orphan drug development. (5) A low level of trialability resulting from insufficient possibilities to conduct statistically valid clinical trials, which in turn result from the conditions mentioned above. Concerted actions to improve these unfavorable conditions and subsequently to increase the willingness to contribute to orphan drug development remain unlikely as long as there is no shared view of the importance of the regulator-and consumer-related barriers among all three actor groups involved.
