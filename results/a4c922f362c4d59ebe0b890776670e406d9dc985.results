Since the amplification of virus sequences was performed using pooled specimens, virusrelated sequences identified in this study would be referred for virus population in the pools rather than per individual specimens. Contigs and reads related to viral origin were further sorted into families and species based on BLAST homologous classifications. The number of sequence reads was directly proportional to the relative abundance of DNA in the original samples, our study therefore compared the number of reads derived from the assembled contigs rather than the number of contigs alone. Virus enrichment followed by random nucleic acid amplification and MiSeq Illumina sequencing yielded 8,482 sequence contigs and singlets from HFMD patients that showed similarity to eukaryotic viruses, comprising 2,591 sequences from HFMD-lib01, 1,798 sequences from HFMD-lib02 and 4,093 sequences from HFMD-lib03. The sequences could be classified into nine viral families and twelve species including six families of RNA viruses: Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Paramyxiviridae, Reoviridae, and Picobirnaviridae, and 3 families of DNA viruses: Parvoviridae, Adenoviridae, and Polyomaviridae. The proportions of the identified virus families in decreasing number of reads are summarized in Fig 1 and general information of the sample in the HFMD pool is shown in S1 Table.
