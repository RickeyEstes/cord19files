Group 1 consisted of 113 cats with uveitis. Of the cats, 42 were from low flea risk states, 65 were from high flea risk states, and state was unknown for seven cats. Bartonella species seroprevalence was 54.9% (62 of 113 cats) with titers ranging from 0 to 1:512 and a median titer of 1:64. Group 2 (clinically ill cats without ocular disease noted) consisted of 156 cats. Of the cats, 60 were from low flea risk states, 92 were from high risk states, and state was unknown for four cats. Bartonella species seroprevalence rate was 62.8% (98 of 156 cats) with titers ranging from 0 to 1:1024 and a median titer of 1:64. Group 3 (healthy cats) consisted of 97 cats. Of the cats, 26 were from low flea risk states, 70 were from high risk states, and state was unknown for one cat. Bartonella species seroprevalence rate was 70.1% (68 of 97 cats) with titers ranging from 0 to 1:8192 and a median titer of 1:64. In the initial statistical evaluation, group 3 cats had a greater seropositive rate than group 1 cats (Table 1, P ¼ 0.0322). After the addition of variables (age and risk of flea exposure), the effect of group was still significant (P ¼ 0.0126). The likelihood of being seropositive for Bartonella species increased with higher flea risk (P < 0.0001; odds ratio (OR) ¼ 2.731) but decreased as age increased (P ¼ 0.0035; OR ¼ 0.779) ( Table 2) . Median titers were equal among groups; however, Wilcoxon's rank sum test revealed that the mean rank of titers in group 3 was significantly greater than that in group 1 (P ¼ 0.0024). Figure 1 provides a bar graph of the distribution of Bartonella species antibody titers.
