Significantly higher expression of CD69 on CD4 + T cells in PFCs from patients with TBP than in PBMCs from TB patients and healthy donors without any stimulation Our initial experiments assessed the surface expression of CD69 on CD4 + T cells from PFCs of patients with TBP and PBMCs from TB patients (PTB) and healthy donors (HD). As expected, without any stimulation, a significantly higher level of CD69 expression was observed on CD4 + T cells from PFCs of TBP patients than on PBMCs from either PTB or HD ( Fig. 1A and B, P,0.001). Moreover, higher levels of CD69 expression (11.60%611.93%, mean 6 SD) on CD4 + T cells were observed in 78% of the PFCs from individuals with TBP than on the PBMCs of PTB or HD (1.48%61.60% for healthy donors and 1.38%61.68% for TB patients, mean 6 SD). No significant difference in CD69 expression was observed on PBMCs from PTB and from HD ( Fig 1B, P = ns) . In addition, we also demonstrated that CD4 + CD69 + T cells expressed significantly higher levels of HLA-DR than CD4 + CD69 2 T cells, a molecule which is usually induced on CD4 + T cells after activation (Fig 1C and D , P,0.001). Unexpectedly, no significant difference was observed in the expression of CD25, another activation marker, which is usually temporally expressed on activated T cells or constitutively expressed on regulatory T cells (Fig 1C and D , P = ns). Significantly higher expression of T-bet and IL-12Rb2 by CD4 + CD69 + T cells than by CD4 + CD69 2 T cells In order to confirm whether CD4 + CD69 + T cells in PFCs were Th1 cells, we further evaluated the expression of T-bet, an important transcription factor specific for Th1 cells. The results showed that more than 90% of CD4 + CD69 + T cells and about 57.24% of CD4 + CD69 2 T cells expressed T-bet (Fig 2A) . The expression of T-bet on CD4 + CD69 + T cells was significantly higher than that on CD4 + CD69 2 T cells (Fig 2B, P,0 .01). We next examined the expression of IL-12Rb2, another marker highly specific for differentiated Th1 cells. Similar to the results obtained for T-bet expression, the majority of CD4 + CD69 + T cells constitutively expressed IL-12Rb2 ( Fig. 2A) , and the expression was significantly higher than that observed on CD4 + CD69 2 T cells (Fig 2C, P,0 .05 ), further confirming that the CD4 + CD69 + T cell subset was highly enriched for Th1 cells. ESAT-6 and CFP-10 peptides-specific Th1 cells were preferentially enriched within CD4 + CD69 + T cells Because CD4 + CD69 + T cells were predominantly Th1 cells, we aimed to examine whether direct ex vivo evaluation of surface expression of CD69 without in vitro upregulation permits direct assessment of MTB-specific Th1 cells. Our initial experiments indicated that stimulation of PFCs with ESAT-6 and CFP-10 peptides resulted in increased surface CD69 expression that is difficult to elucidate (Data not shown). Short-term stimulation of these cells includes incubation with secretion inhibitory brefeldin A (BFA), which can block the transport of newly synthesized CD69 molecules to the cell surface and thus allows for the direct assessment of the relationship between in vivo CD69 expression and cytokine production. After culturing PFCs with ESAT-6/ CFP-10 peptides and BFA, we analyzed the production of Th1 cytokines by intracellular cytokine staining and polychromatic flow cytometry. As shown in Fig 3A and B , CD4 + CD69 + T cells produced greater amounts of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a than did CD4 + CD69 2 T cells. Statistical results demonstrated that the percentages of IFN-c, IL-2 or TNF-a-producing CD4 + CD69 + T cells were significantly higher than those for CD4 + CD69 2 T cells (P,0.001, Fig 3C) . In order to further confirm that the responses of T cells were specific for MTB, we also stimulated PFCs from tuberculous pleurisy patients with other irrelevant antigens such as SARS-CoV S peptides (STFFSTFKCYGVSATKL) and (NFSQILPDPLKPTK RSFI) as well as hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). We found that these irrelevant antigens could not induce the production of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a by neither CD4 + CD69 + nor CD4 + CD69 2 T cells. However, following stimulation with MTB-specific peptides of ESAT-6/CFP-10, CD4 + CD69 + T cells from the same patients expressed high levels of IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a (data not shown).
