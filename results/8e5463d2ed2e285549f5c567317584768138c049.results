Farm personnel (mainly farm owners) from all 118 herds answered the questionnaire, giving a response rate of 100%. Three herds were excluded from the statistical analyses because of uncertain infection status at the time of the study, leaving the study with 115 herds comprising 47 nucleus herds and 68 multiplier herds. A total of 20 (43%) nucleus herds and 28 (41%) multiplier herds were classified as positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 by the diagnostic criteria previously described. This gave 48 positive herds and 67 negative herds for the study. Chronological data on presence of clinical signs of ILI from both humans and pigs were reported from 14 of the 48 positive herds. Twelve (85.7%) of these 14 herds had ILI in humans occurring before the pigs began to show typical signs of influenza infection. The median time between occurrences of clinical signs in humans and in pigs was 21 days.
