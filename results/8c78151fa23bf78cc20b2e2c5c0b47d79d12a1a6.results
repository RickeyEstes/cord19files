As mentioned above, our study is not aimed at calculating absolute values for the free energy of binding and for the affinity, but focuses on the ranking of acceptable conformations for the multiple solution space. Because of the different preferences in the selection of pareto-optimal solutions with ε-MOEA, the results of three different approaches will be compared with individual scoring functions, namely one with preferred energy score for ε-MOEA (MOEA_Nrg), the other with preferred contact score for ε-MOEA (MOEA_Cnt), and the third for EFMOGA.
