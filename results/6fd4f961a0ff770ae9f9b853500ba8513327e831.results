A protein phosphatase activity against purified N protein, which could be activated with Triton X-100 was detected in L.ceil homogenates. Subcdlular fractionation intended to ~eparate membraneous organdies was carried out by means of dual Percoll gradients [! 3],~ The data regarding distribution of marker enzymes oh. rained from such fractionatlon are summarized in Fig,  1 and Table 1 The data comparinl~ P PPase activities against ()-'P]N as substrata, relative to the activity in the total ceil homogenates, were obtained on subcellular fractions and are shown in Table I , It is evident from these data that the endosomal fraction was enriched 25,reid in this PPPase, Material from PerÂ¢oll 8radiant II in tile fractions enriched in plasma membranes contained only minor dephosphorylating activity (data not shown). The effect of the endosomal PPPasc on the [~'~PIN ~ubstrata, was also demonstrated autoradiographically, as illustrated in Fig, 3 , supporting the quantitative results. The endosomal PPPase activity was stable during storage at -20"C for over two months, but profoundly decreased upon freezing and thawinl~ more than once. The pH optimum, basd on measurements in buffers containing sodium acetate, Tris.maleate and TrIs-HCi, providing the appropriate pH range, occurred at about neutrality (data not shown). Mn -'+ at 1 mM was the required divalent cation for optimum PPPase activity, while Ca") and M8 ~'' were less effective and Zn=* and Fe ='" were inhibitory ( Activity of PPPase on ['uPIN was monitored by determining the release of ~"P from the substrate as described in section 2 and expressed as 070 dephosphorylation, Acid phosphatase was assayed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate, The reactions were run for 90 rain '-' denotes not done; O.A,, okadaic acid.
