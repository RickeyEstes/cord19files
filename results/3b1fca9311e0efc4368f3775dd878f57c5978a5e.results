Simvastatin Treatment Lowered the Serum Cholesterol Level in Gn Pigs and Resulted in Increased Early LDLR Gene Expression in a Porcine Enterocyte Cell Line (IPEC-J2) Serum cholesterol levels were monitored to measure the pharmacological activity of simvastatin in Gn pigs. Simvastatintreated pigs had significantly decreased serum cholesterol levels (81.567.5 to 90.467.4 mg/dL) at 8 to 14 days after treatment began, which were 1.6 to 2.4 times lower than the levels in the untreated pigs (147.0611.0 to 202.3625.5 mg/dL) during the same period (Fig. 1A) . We further investigated if a reverse relationship existed between the cholesterol level and the LDLR gene expression in a porcine jejunal epithelial cell line, IPEC-J2, because intestinal epithelial cells are a cell type critical for initiation of HuNoV infection [16] . Cells were treated with multiple concentrations (0 mM, 1 mM, 20 mM, and 80 mM) of simvastatin, and LDLR gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). At 12 hours after treatment with 80 mM simvastatin, LDLR gene expression levels in IPEC-J2 cells were significantly increased compared to 0 to 20 mM treated groups (Fig. 1B) . At 12 and 24 hours after treatment with 1 to 80 mM simvastatin, the LDLR gene expression levels were significantly increased by 2.4 to 2.7 times compared to untreated groups (Fig. 1B) .
