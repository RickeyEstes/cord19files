The mean bacteriophage load of seeded surfaces from phase 1 (predecontamination) was (1.59 AE 1.98) Â 10 6 PFU before the start of EMS calls and (1.89E AE 2.81) Â 10 5 PFU on completion of EMS calls. During phase 2 (decontamination per current practices), the mean viral load of seeded surfaces was (2.03E AE 1.86) Â 10 6 PFU prior to the start of EMS calls and (8.37 AE 7.43) Â 10 5 PFU after decontamination by firefighters. The mean viral load of seeded surfaces during phase 3 (decontamination after H 2 O 2 wipe intervention) was (2.93E AE 4.35) Â 10 6 PFU before the start of EMS calls and 8.14 Â 10 4 AE 2.26 Â 10 5 PFU after EMS personnel performed decontamination using the activated H 2 O 2 wipes. Viral loads of seeded surfaces were not significantly different before the start of EMS calls between phases (P ¼ .3113, Kruskal-Wallis), but they were significantly different after EMS calls Phage tracer movement in emergency medical services (EMS) vehicles: summary of field sampling protocol. *Only half of the seeded surface were sampled to obtain the approximate starting concentration of bacteriophage available for transfer to avoid removal of all bacteriophage. y Current practices were not standardized and varied from sample to sample. z During the intervention the firefighters were given hydrogen peroxide wipes and asked to disinfect any surfaces they recalled handling during the EMS call. (P ¼ .0005, Kruskal-Wallis) (Fig 2) . Decontamination per current practices did not significantly reduce viral loads of the seeded surfaces (P ¼ .2113, Wilcoxon rank-sum). Intervention with activated H 2 O 2 wipes significantly reduced the viral loads when compared with surfaces before any decontamination (P ¼ .0065, Wilcoxon rank-sum) and when compared with decontamination per current practices (P ¼ .0009, Wilcoxon rank-sum) (Fig 2) . Bacteriophage cross-contamination of EMS equipment surfaces was detected during all EMS calls (15/15), regardless of the phase. Cross-contamination occurred on a total of 56% (27/48), 54% (26/48), and 40% (19/48) of surfaces predecontamination, after disinfection per current practices, and after H 2 O 2 wipe intervention, respectively. Table 2 describes the frequency of cross-contamination and quantitative results for each site within each phase of the study. After decontamination per current practices and the hydrogen peroxide wipe intervention, the rubber jumpbag handle still had the greatest viral load of the cross-contaminated surfaces (226 AE 153 PFU, and 230 AE 315 PFU, respectively). Introduction of the activated hydrogen peroxide intervention decreased the total viral load on all cross-contaminated fomites combined from both disinfection per current practices and no decontamination; but the differences in total viral load of combined surfaces between phases was not significant (P ¼ .3703, Kruskal-Wallace) (Fig 3) .
