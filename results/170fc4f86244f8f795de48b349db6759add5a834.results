The findings of the present study illustrate five overarching themes that describe emergency nurses' perception of risk appraisal regarding the EID situations in the emergency care context. These themes are (1) the novelty of an EID, (2) the severity of an EID, (3) the proximity to an EID, (4) the complexity of an EID situation, and (5) the response levels towards an EID situation.
