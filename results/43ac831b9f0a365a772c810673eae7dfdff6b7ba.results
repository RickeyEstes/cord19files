Production of antibody-secreting hybridoma lines From the fusion described above, we have obtained nine stable cloned hybridoma lines which secrete vi- c Passive protection against lethal intracerebral challenge with MHV-A59.

The protein specificity of each antibody was determined by immunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting. Two hybridomas (7-1 OA and 4-l 1 G) were selected for further study, since they secreted MAbs which immunoprecipitated the 180-kDa form of S (Fig. 1 ). These MAbs were also able to neutralize virus infectivity and virus-induced fusion in vitro and passively protect mice in vivo (Table 1 and Fig. 2 ). Partial reciprocal competition in an ELISA and the absence of reactivity with the SDS-denatured protein on Western immunoblots (data not shown) or dot blots (Fig. 3) showed that MAbs 7-l OA and 4-l 1 G recognize two overlapping conformational determinants. However, the determinant recognized by MAb 4-l 1 G re- 3. Sensitivity of two S epitopes to protein denaturation.
