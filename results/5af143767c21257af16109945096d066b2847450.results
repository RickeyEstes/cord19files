Of the 68 mated female (FO) rats per group, the pregnancy rate was 88 to 96% among the four groups (Table 1) . Exposure had no detectable effect on the percentage of animals that maintained pregnancy. The initial random assignment was blocked on weight; therefore essentially the same mean initial body mass existed in the four groups (Table 1) . Gains in body mass throughout gestation appeared to decrease with increasing field strength for the two higher-level exposed groups of F0 females. Although approaching significance by the trend test (p = 0.063, this decrease was not statistically significant, as the overall test for equality of means indicated no significant differences among groups (p = 0.08 1). Parturition did not occur in four pregnant dams, three of which (each from a different exposure group) had one pup per litter and a fourth died, with a pup lodged within the birth canal. Mean litter size and pup mortality incidences in the period between 1 and 4 days of age and between 4 and 2 1 days of age were similar in all groups. The sex ratio (mean percentage of male pups) in each litter was not different among the treatment groups. Pup mean body masses were similar among the groups for both sexes at I and 4 days of age (Table 2) . Growth curves were similar for all groups within sex, although mafe pups exposed at the two higher field strengths tended to gain slightly less weight (p < 0.05) in the period between 4 and 2 1 days of age than did those in the other groups. Mean weight gains of female pups (females selected to continue on experiment after 21 days of age) did not differ among the groups. Mean body weights of dams at Day 1 after parturition were similar in the four groups. Rats exposed at 65 kV/m lost significantly more weight during lactation than did those of the other groups (Table 2) . equivalent among groups for the selected female rats that continued on study. Only two rats died during this period, of causes unrelated to exposure (broken tooth, bladder stones), and mean body weights among the groups were the same. Breeding procedures began when the FI female rats reached 11 weeks of age. Approximately equal numbers of females were mated daily from each group, and curves, calculated from the cumulative numbers of rats mated daily, did not differ among groups. Over a 12day period, mating was detected to have occurred in 8 1 to 9 1% of the rats in the four groups, the pregnancy rate of which varied between 87 to 94%. These values were not significantly different among groups (Table 3) . Mean numbers of consecutive daily mating periods were approximately equal among groups. Throughout the postweaning period mea-Mean body weights at 0 day of gestation sures of toxicity or animal well-being were were not significantly different among groups (p = 0.075). Mean weight gain through pregnancy was not affected by exposure, and extragestational weight gain (an indicator of dam well-being through pregnancy) was also not affected by exposure. In teratological examinations, mean gravid uterine weights were not affected by treatment (p = 0.52). Absolute mean liver weight was significantly less (p = 0.05) in rats exposed at the highest field strength than in the sham-exposed group. However, ratios of mean liver weight to body weight did not differ. No significant differences were observed among treatment groups with respect to the total number of corpora luteu per dam, implantation sites per dam, or preimplantation loss as indexed by implantation sites per corpus luteum (Table 4) . Postimplantation embryonic death was not affected by exposure, as indicated by the fact that none of the measures of implant resorption differed among groups. Mean number of live fetuses per litter was less in rats exposed to the 130 kV/m field, but it was not statistically different from the control group (p = 0.33). Mean fetal body weight and placental mass were the same among the groups. The sex ratio (number of males/litter) appeared to increase with field strength but did not differ significantly among groups (p = 0.08) and was within the range of expected variation. A total of 5076 fetuses in 375 litters were examined. In all cases, the number of litters examined per treatment group exceeded the 80 litters required for a statistical power of 0.8 or greater for comparison of malformation incidence. A wide variety of malformations were recorded, as would be consistent with the large number of litters examined (Table  TABLE 5 * A single fetus may be represented more than once if multiple defects were present. * p < 0.05 versus sham-exposed, x2 test. 5).

A few incidences of fetal variations were significantly higher for specific site/exposure group combinations, but no clear correlation of increasing incidence with increasing field strength was evident. For example, incidence of dilated ureter was significantly higher in fetuses of dams exposed to 65 kV/m electric fields on both a per fetus and a per litter basis ( Table 6 ). The associated variations of renal pelvic cavitation were also higher on a per fetus basis. Incidence of an additional ossification site at the first lumbar vertebra was significantly higher per fetus (but not per litter) in animals exposed to 65 kV/m; the incidence was not higher in rats exposed to 130 kV/m. During routine observation of the F0 dams, a rust-colored deposit (chromodacryorrhea) was observed on the muzzles and ear hair. Subsequently, the deposits were also observed on F, females during the 3 months of exposure following birth and the incidence and severity of chromodacryorrhea were recorded at termination. A statistically significant trend (p < 0.000 1) toward an increased incidence of deposits was recorded with increasing field strength in both lactating and pregnant animals. Seventy-eight percent of nursing dams exposed at the highest field strength had detectable amounts of such deposits (Table 7) .
