Composing a questionnaire is viewed, from the user's point of view, as 'shopping for' questions, that is, filling a 'basket' with the questions he wants to eventually have in the questionnaire. However, while the order in which the items composing the shopping basket were added does not matter in a usual consumer's purchase, here the questions composing a questionnaire must be appropriately ordered. The EpiBasket software helps the user draft a questionnaire and to exchange his draft (that we called a 'wish list') with his collaborators until he decides to obtain a ready-to-use paper questionnaire, for a paperand-pencil survey and/or an electronic file for an online survey. In addition, EpiBasket includes several tools enabling userÁuser and userÁEditorial Committee exchanges to promote collaborative epidemiology. Fig. 1 gives a snapshot of one of the windows. A demonstration of the different EpiBasket features of can be tried at http://www.epibasket.org. 1 These features are described below in more detail. Building the draft of the questionnaire First, the user must select the candidate questions pertaining to the event of interest: questions according to categories of the questions, time of study, study population and so on. For example, the user may want to consult all the questions belonging to the 'Knowledge' category, concerning healthcare workers and to be collected during the outbreak, which would require three 1 A password can be obtained upon request from the corresponding author (A-J V). In this example, the user chose the subcategory 'Travel history' in the 'Personal history' category (left column). Five questions are proposed in this subcategory (middle of the window). If the user is also interested in the related question dealing with 'past flight history', clicking on question 4 will open a window giving the reference to the paper with the highest impact factor (IF) in the database that posed that question, and the exact question formulation used in that paper. clicks. Because questions are labelled with keywords and linked to papers in which they were initially mentioned, suggested associations of potential appropriate questions can be easily accessed.
