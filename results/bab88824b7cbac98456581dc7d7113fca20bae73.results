The patients had conjunctival hyperemia and folliculosis (Fig 1) . Early subepithelial corneal infiltrates were present in 60% of the patients, preauricular nodes were present in 80%, and conjunctival pseudomembranes were present in approximately 10%. Of 50 specimens from patients with EKC, positive immunofluorescence for adenovirus was present in 22 cases. Cytoplasmic fluorescence was marked (Fig 2) , but stippled nuclear fluorescence was also observed (Fig 3) . Cultures and typing showed that 20 of these were a hybrid type 10-19, one was type 3, and one was type 11. In three persons with herpetic dendritic keratitis (Fig 4 and 5) , positive immunofluorescence was present (Fig 6) ; all were herpes simplex hominis type 1. Herpes simplex virions obtained from scrapings of dendritis lesions measured 100 nm in diameter and displayed mostly intact capsids (Fig 7) . A 2-year-old boy with ocular rubella had unilateral cataract (Fig 8) and microphthalmos. Smears of the cataractous lens revealed positive immunofluorescence with the positive serum in the form of diffuse and granular cytoplasmic fluorescence, and diffuse streaks of amorphous extracellular material. Molluscum contagiosum lid lesions displayed circumscribed nodules with a central umbilication (Fig 9) . Scrapings stained with hematoxylin-eosin revealed large basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in the granular layer. N~gative stain electron microscopy disclosed brick-shaped virions (Fig 10) measuring 250X200 nm with the usual interlacing pattern of surface threads. In one patient with a vaccinia lid lesion (Fig 11) , both mulberry (M) and capsule (C) forms were observed (Fig 12 and 13 ).
