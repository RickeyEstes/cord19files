The cellular chaperones Hsc70, iHsp70 and Grp78 were enhanced in the NE-associated RTCs of reactivated HEK-293T rKSHV.219 cells To investigate differential proteome changes which occur during KSHV lytic replication in NE-associated RTCs, we utilised the HEK-293T cell line containing a latent recombinant KSHV virus (rKSHV.219) [42] . This cell line can be reactivated into a full lytic replication cycle via chemical induction. Unreactivated cells were grown in isotopically labelled media (R6K4), while cells to be reactivated were grown in label-free media (R0K0). After isotopic labelling was complete, cells were reactivated for 48 h and nuclear envelopes (NEs) were then successfully purified using a recently described method [35] , with minor modifications. Western blot analysis of the NE preparations demonstrated an enrichment of nucleoporins (Nups), lamins and histones and a loss of cytoplasmic (GAPDH) and nucleolar (B-23, C-23) proteins compared with whole cell (WC) lysates (Fig 1) . The essential KSHV mRNA processing protein, ORF57 [43] , and viral RTA served as markers for lytic viral replication and RTC enrichment, as both of these proteins are known to be recruited to KSHV RTCs [31, 44] . The monoclonal antibody (Mab414), which recognises the phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-repeat motif present in numerous Nups, and the polyclonal antibodies against Nup160 and lamin B1 were used to assess enrichment of the NE region. NE preparations showed a higher number of Nups (closed arrows) than their respective WC preparations; although some Nups were lost following 0.3 M salt wash (open arrow). Following LC-MS/MS analysis and using a minimum of three unique peptides assigned to a single protein, most proteins (1072) remained unchanged in their abundance irrespectively of KSHV lytic infection and only five proteins had a significant reduction (ratio cut-off <0.5) in NEs of reactivated cells. In contrast, 216 proteins showed a significant increase (ratio cut-off >1.9) during lytic replication. Importantly, multiple cellular proteins that are known or expected to localize within herpesvirus RTCs; such as those associated with KSHV ori-Lyt, the HCMV transactivator IE2-p86 protein or the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) ICP8 protein were found significantly increased in the NE regions of reactivated cells using the less stringent ratio cut-off of 1.5 (S1 Table) . Some of these cellular proteins included CSNK2A1 [45] , BLM [32] , topoisomerases I and II [31, 46, 47] and DEAD box helicases DDX5 [32] and DDX17 [45] . Thus, LC-MS/MS results confirmed the correct isolation of the NE region and accompanying RTCs. Importantly, many of the 216 identified proteins most likely represent novel cellular proteins hijacked by KSHV, not only due to the subcellular fractionation carried out but also to the uncommon use of urea for protein extraction before LC-MS/ MS. All proteins identified by LC-MS/MS can be seen on S1 Dataset. Bioinformatical analysis revealed several upregulated pathways (ratio cut-off >1.9) in reactivated cells (S2 Table) . Of particular interest was an upregulated pathway which related to protein folding. This included several Hsp70 isoforms and their associated co-chaperones from the HSP40 (DNAJ) family ( Table 1) . Notably, the constitutively expressed chaperone Hsc70 presented a 4.1-fold increase with 41 unique peptides assigned. This protein had the highest fold increase associated with the most unique peptide number of all the proteins identified by LC-MS/MS. This could be due to increased Hsc70 expression or to the redistribution of Hsc70 from the cytoplasm into the NE region during KSHV lytic replication. Therefore, due to the vital importance of Hsp70 isoforms in the replication cycle of a wide range of viral families, we focussed our studies herein on the roles of the three main Hsp70 isoforms (Hsc70, iHsp70 and Grp78) during KSHV lytic replication. Hsc70 and iHsp70 are redistributed from the cytoplasm to both the periphery and within KSHV-induced RTCs To verify the enrichment of Hsc70 in the NE-associated RTCs of reactivated cells detected by our quantitative proteomic approach, indirect immunofluorescence was used to label endogenous Hsc70 protein in TREx BCBL1-RTA cells, a KSHV latently infected B-lymphocyte cell line containing a Myc-tagged version of viral RTA under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter [48] . Hsc70 protein was equally distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus of unreactivated cells in a fine punctuate pattern (Fig 2Ai) . Similar Hsc70 localization was seen during early lytic replication (12 h reactivation), when RTA protein was diffuse in the nucleus, Successful enrichment of the nuclear envelope region and associated KSHV RTCs in HEK-293T rKSHV.219 cells. Successful enrichment of NE regions in unreactivated (-) and reactivated for 48 h (+) HEK-293T rKSHV.219 cells was demonstrated by Western blotting. Equal amounts of total protein extracted from whole cell (WC) and nuclear envelope (NE) fractions were used. The monoclonal antibody Mab414 specifically recognises the phenylalanine-glycine (FG)-repeat motif present in numerous nucleoporins (Nups). Closed arrows point to Nups that were only detected by MAb414 after NE enrichment. Open arrow points to a nucleoporin lost during NE enrichment. Several FG Nups, together with Nup160, histone H3 and lamin B1 were all markedly enriched in the NE fractions compared with WC fractions. The nucleolar proteins B-23 and C-23 and the cytoplasmic GAPDH protein were all decreased in NEs fractions indicating correct subcellular fractionation. The viral RTC-associated ORF57 and RTA proteins were used to monitor lytic reactivation and assess RTC enrichment. ORF57 antibody detected both full length ORF57 protein (FL-ORF57) and the caspase-7-cleaved ORF57 (CL-ORF57). prior to RTC formation (Fig 2Aii) . In contrast, at later reactivation time points (20 h), in which RTA was organised into small viral RTCs peripherally located in the nucleus, numerous nuclear Hsc70 foci that were predominantly adjacent to RTCs were observed (Fig 2Aiii) . During late reactivation time points (26 h), cellular chromatin was marginalised to the nuclear periphery (Fig 2Aiv, nucleus highlighted in yellow) and larger Hsc70 foci avidly accumulated within these fully-developed RTCs (Fig 2Aiv) . Reduced levels of cytoplasmic Hsc70 were also observed at this time point (Fig 2Aiv arrows) , suggesting that Hsc70 is redistributed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during KSHV lytic replication. This is further supported by the fact that fractionation of TREx BCBL1-RTA cells into nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) fractions displayed an enrichment of Hsc70 in the nuclei of reactivated cells which occurred without a noticeable increase in Hsc70 protein levels in whole cell (WC) lysates ( Fig 2B) . Due to the observed redistribution of Hsc70 to KSHV RTCs, further co-localization studies between Hsc70 and the sites of viral DNA replication were performed in TREx BCBL1-RTA cells. Here, cells were triple-labelled with Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 and antibodies specific for RTA and Hsc70. In unreactivated cells, newly synthesized cellular DNA during mid-S-phase (EdU incorporated) occurred mainly at the nuclear periphery as previously observed in other cell types [49, 50] (Fig 2Ci) . During early reactivation, Hsc70 was adjacent to RTA which was present in small viral RTCs containing actively replicating viral DNA (Fig 2Cii arrow) . At this stage, a proportion of Hsc70 also co-localised with RTA (Fig 2Cii') . During late reactivation, when cellular chromatin was marginalised, much larger RTCs were visible and newly synthesized cellular DNA was not apparent, here Hsc70 completely co-localised with newly synthesized viral DNA and RTA (Fig 2Ciii and 2Ciii') . The location of the other two main Hsp70 isoforms (iHsp70 and Grp78) during KSHV lytic replication was also investigated by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. iHsp70 was cytoplasmic in unreactivated TREx BCBL1-RTA cells (S1Ai Fig), in contrast, an increase in nuclear iHsp70 labelling was observed in reactivated cells, which displayed similar chaperone foci as those seen during early reactivation for Hsc70 (S1Aii Fig). Occasionally, cells displayed RTCs completely filled by iHsp70 (S1Aiii and S1Aiv Fig, asterisks) . Large iHsp70 foci positioned adjacent to RTCs were also seen in reactivated cells at later time points (S1Aiv Fig  arrows) . Co-localisation of iHsp70 with actively replicating viral DNA was also observed during late reactivation (S1B Fig). Hsc70 and iHsp70 nuclear foci appeared at the same time as KSHV RTCs were assembled, suggesting that these chaperones could be involved in RTC assembly. Additionally, complete co-localization of Hsc70 and iHsp70 with viral DNA indicated that these chaperones could also participate in viral DNA replication and/or capsid assembly. In contrast, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Hsp70 isoform, Grp78, was not redistributed in reactivated TREx BCBL1-RTA cells (S2 Fig) , consistent with its ER retention signal [51] . Nevertheless, reactivated cells seemed to accumulate larger amounts of Grp78 in the ER. To confirm these results, immunoflourescence studies were also performed using HEK-293T prior to RTC formation, when RTA was diffuse in the nucleus (ii). At 20 h reactivation viral RTA was assembled into incipient RTCs. Hsc70 was not detected in the cytoplasm and instead numerous nuclear foci that were positioned predominantly adjacent to RTCs were seen (iii). At later reactivation times very large Hsc70 foci were completely recruited within RTCs. Hsc70 cytoplasmic depletion is indicated (iv arrows). Nucleus highlighted in yellow shows a typical KSHV fully developed-RTC with cellular chromatin marginalised to the nuclear periphery. (B) Unreactivated (-) or reactivated for 26 h (+) TREx BCBL1-RTA cells were fractionated into whole cell (WC), cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions. Equal amounts of total protein from each fraction were analysed by Western blotting. Nuclear fractions were characterised by enrichment of lamin B1 and absence of cytoplasmic GAPDH, while cytoplasmic fractions showed the inverse profile. A small decrease in cytoplasmic Hsc70 which correlated with a small increase in nuclear Hsc70 was detected in reactivated cells, further supporting that Hsc70 was redistributed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. (C) TREx BCBL1-RTA cells remained unreactivated (i) or reactivated for 24 h (iiiii') followed by triple-labelling with antibodies specific for RTA and Hsc70 and Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647, the latter allowed visualization of newly synthesized DNA. During early reactivation, a proportion of Hsc70 protein was adjacent to small viral RTCs. Arrow points to a small KSHV RTC filled with viral DNA (ii). Hsc70 also partially co-localised with viral DNA (ii) and RTA (ii') in small RTCs. During later reactivation times, Hsc70 completely moved within fully-developed RTCs strongly co-localising with viral DNA (iii) and RTA (iii'). rKSHV.219 cells, in which the presence of the recombinant virus is tracked by expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the EF-1alpha promoter and lytic reactivation levels are monitored by expression of the red fluorescent protein (RFP) from the KSHV lytic noncoding polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) RNA promoter. Unreactivated cells displayed cytoplasmic iHsp70 and Hsc70 labelling, whereas~40% of reactivated cells (24 h reactivation) revealed nuclear iHsp70 and Hsc70 accumulations that appeared to assemble within small RTCs (S3A Fig arrows and S3B Fig arrows respectively) . The incomplete redistribution of iHsp70 and Hsc70 foci into RTCs was likely due to a more asynchronous progression through the lytic cycle in induced cells by TPA and sodium n-butyrate than in doxycycline-induced TREx BCBL1-RTA cells. Similarly to TREx BCBL1-RTA cells, Grp78 was not redistributed in HEK-293T rKSHV.219 cells, although larger amounts appeared to accumulate in the ER of reactivated cells (S3C Fig), in agreement with the significantly increased amounts of Grp78 detected in the NE region of these cells ( Table 1) . These results clearly demonstrate that KSHV specifically redistributes the molecular chaperones, Hsc70 and iHsp70, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, in contrast to Grp78, which coincides with the initial formation of KSHV RTCs. Treatment with the small molecule inhibitor VER-155008 abrogated viral protein synthesis at non-cytotoxic concentrations Members of the HSP70 chaperone family possess an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain with ATPase activity which is essential for their function. To examine the implications of Hsc70 and iHsp70 redistribution into KSHV RTCs, a small molecule inhibitor, VER-155008, (a dibenzyl-8-aminoadenosine analog) was utilised. This is the only inhibitor that has been demonstrated to specifically target the highly homologous ATPase pocket present in the three main human Hsp70 isoforms [12, 13, 52, 53] , which is highly divergent structurally from the ATPase pocket found in chaperones of the HSP90 family [12, 54] . As such, VER-155008 functions as an ATP mimetic that specifically inhibits the ATPase activity of members of the HSP70 family. Initially, cytotoxicity of this compound was assessed in unreactivated TREx BCBL1-RTA cells. Following 24 h inhibitor exposure, using a non-radioactive MTS assay, which quantitatively assesses cell proliferation, a drastic reduction in cell metabolic activity was seen for inhibitor concentrations higher than 6 μM (S4 Fig) , thus concentrations ranging from 1 to 4 μM were used for further cytotoxicity characterization (Fig 3Ai) . The inhibitor triggered apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner as demonstrated by the caspase 3-mediated cleavage of full length poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase (FL-PARP1) protein into cleaved PARP1 (CL-PARP1) (Fig 3Aii) . Small amounts of CL-PARP1 were seen at 1 μM and 2 μM with a significant increase of this form after 3 μM. These results were confirmed with ApoTox-Glo Triplex Assay by quantitatively measuring viability, cytotoxicity and activation of effector caspases-3/7 in the same sample well after 24 h inhibitor treatment. A dose-dependent decrease in viability was evident from 2 μM to 50 μM while cytotoxicity and activation of caspases-3/7 were only considerably increased at concentrations higher than 3 μM ( Fig 3B) . Next, TREx BCBL1-RTA cells were reactivated for 24 h in the presence of drug vehicle DMSO (0.1%) or a range of increasing inhibitor concentrations. Cells treated with the inhibitor at non-cytotoxic concentrations (1 to 2.5 μM) revealed a drastic reduction in the levels of early ORF57 and late minor capsid (mCapsid) proteins. A moderate reduction in the immediateearly RTA protein was also seen ( Fig 3C) . Of note, when detecting the fusion protein RTA-Myc, which expression is not from the KSHV genome, with anti-Myc antibody, the decrease in RTA-Myc was not as dramatic as that seen for viral RTA, suggesting that the decrease in viral proteins was not due to a general cytotoxic effect of the inhibitor on the cells, and that viral, but not cellular proteins were specifically affected. As an additional cellular control, protein levels of the large subunit of RNAPII, which has a half-life of 12-16 h [55] , was assessed with antibodies specific for the different phosphorylated forms of RNAPII. Protein levels of these forms were not significantly changed in the presence of the inhibitor, nor were those of Hsc70 or Hsp90 proteins. Importantly, in the presence of VER-155008, iHsp70 levels were not upregulated. iHsp70 upregulation is a universal hallmark of Hsp90 inhibition not only in vitro [56] but also in clinical trials [57] , pointing to selectivity for Hsp70 isoforms by VER-155008. Hsp90 and Hsp70 chaperone machineries have been reported to be crucial for the stability and/or maturation of multiple viral proteins [7, 41, [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . Therefore to ascertain whether Hsp70 isoforms could stabilise the essential KSHV lytic proteins RTA and ORF57, TREx BCBL1-RTA cells were reactivated for 24 h to allow sufficient viral protein expression followed by addition of DMSO control or VER-155008 in conjunction with cycloheximide (CHX) at 50 μg/ml to block de novo protein synthesis. Protein lysates were then collected at different times after addition of CHX. The half-life of RTA and ORF57 proteins from inhibitor-treated cells were not altered compared with DMSO-treated cells (Fig 3D) . These results indicate that the observed decrease in viral protein synthesis was prior to translation and that neither viral RTA nor ORF57 protein were client proteins of the Hsp70 isoforms. As such, this highlights a potentially novel role of Hsp70 isoforms in the KSHV replication cycle independent of viral protein stability and maturation. To further corroborate these results, experiments were also repeated in HEK-293T rKSHV.219 cells. Again, cell metabolic activity, PARP1 cleavage, viability, cytotoxicity and activation of caspases-3/7 in unreactivated cells were all assessed at a range of increasing inhibitor concentrations (Fig 4A and 4B ). On this occasion, the inhibitor did not trigger apoptosis (Fig  4Aii and 4B ) but it caused a pronounced cell cycle arrest at 24 h exposure at concentrations of 20 μM demonstrated by a reduced number of metabolically active cells that exhibited no increased cytotoxicity [63] (Fig 4B) . It is known that the apoptotic potential of VER-155008 is cell line-dependent and that VER-155008 can cause cell cycle arrest in human colon, breast and lung tumour cell lines [54, 64] . HEK-293T rKSHV.219 cells were also reactivated for 24 h in the presence of drug vehicle DMSO (0.1%) or increasing inhibitor concentrations. Endogenous RTA, ORF57 and mCapsid protein levels were moderately reduced in cells treated at an inhibitor concentration of 10 μM and severely reduced at 40 μM while cellular proteins remain unaffected ( Fig 4C) . These were relatively high inhibitor concentrations compared with TREx BCBL1-RTA cells; nonetheless a concentration of 40 μM has been shown before to be necessary for inhibition of Hsp70 isoforms in human carcinoma cell lines [54] . As previously seen in TREx BCBL1-RTA cells, when blocking de novo protein synthesis with CHX at 100 μg/ml in HEK-293T rKSHV.219 cells, the half-life of RTA and ORF57 proteins were not reduced even in the presence of VER-155008 at 50 μM ( Fig 4D) . This supports the findings seen in TREx BCBL1-RTA cells, suggesting that the decrease in viral protein production was due to a pretranslation event. using an MTS assay. (ii) A dose-dependent cleavage of full length (FL) PARP1 protein into cleaved (CL) PARP1 was observed in the presence of VER-155008. (B) Unreactivated cells were exposed for 24 h to increasing inhibitor concentrations. Concentrations higher than 3 μM resulted in increased cytotoxicity and activation of effector caspases-3/7 as demonstrated by quantification with ApoTox-Glo Triplex Assay. (C) Immunoblot analysis showing that reactivated cells treated with non-cytotoxic inhibitor concentrations (1 to 2.5 μM) for 24 h revealed a decrease in viral proteins compared with DMSO-treated samples while cellular proteins remained unaffected. RNAPIIo denotes hypophosphorylated RNAPII. Ser5 and Ser2 RNAPII denote serine 5-and serine 2hyperphosphorylated RNAPII forms respectively. (D) Cells were reactivated for 24 h to allow robust viral protein production. Then, DMSO control (0.1%) or VER-155008 was added in conjunction with cycloheximide (CHX) at 50 μg/ml to block de novo protein synthesis. Protein lysates were collected at several times post-CHX addition (0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h) and analysed by Western blotting. VER-155008 did not alter the half-life of RTA or ORF57 protein, thus these proteins were not clients of Hsp70 isoforms. The small molecule inhibitor VER-155008 caused a significant reduction in viral transcripts, viral DNA and progeny at non-cytotoxic concentrations As the block in KSHV protein synthesis occurred pre-translationally, viral gene expression was quantified in the absence or presence of VER-155008. TREx BCBL1-RTA cells were reactivated for 24 h and two-step quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out to quantify a range of viral transcripts. A significant decrease in early (PAN, ORF57, K12 and vGPCR), late (gL and gB) viral transcripts and ori-Lyt transcripts was observed in a dose-dependent manner, with all transcripts with the exception of vGPCR being significantly reduced at an inhibitor concentration of 1 μM (Fig 5A) . To determine whether cellular transcription was negatively affected in the presence of VER-155008, firstly the stability of GAPDH transcript was determined in mRNA decay assays using the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (AcD) (2.5 μg/ml) in TREx BCBL1-RTA cells. After 6 h of AcD treatment, the amount of GAPDH mRNA was reduced by half (Fig 5B) , indicating a short stability of GAPDH mRNA in this cell line. We then plotted the raw cycle threshold (C T ) for GAPDH transcript from the same samples in which viral transcripts had been quantified after 24 h of VER-155008 treatment. As the same amount of total RNA was converted into cDNA for all samples, if cellular transcription was not compromised a very similar C T is expected for all samples. Indeed, samples treated with up to 3 μM VER-155008 were all within 0.4 C T from the 12.7 C T of DMSO-treated samples. Only after concentrations higher than 3 μM GAPDH mRNA levels were significantly reduced compared to DMSO-treated samples as shown by a significantly higher C T value ( Fig 5C) . This is consistent with the cytotoxicity profile of VER-155008 in TREx BCBL1-RTA cells (Fig 3A and 3B ) and the clear decrease in RTA-myc protein (which expression is not from the KSHV genome) at inhibitor concentrations higher than 3 μM ( Fig  3C) . Taken together, these results suggest that cellular transcription was compromised at concentrations of VER-155008 higher than 3 μM while at concentrations lower than 3 μM transcription was occurring normally. Interestingly, transcription of viral genes which also require host RNAPII for their expression was negatively affected even at VER-155008 concentrations lower than 3 μM. Next, we assessed whether the inhibitor also caused a reduction in viral DNA replication. TREx BCBL1-RTA cells were reactivated for 72 h, total DNA was isolated and realtime qPCR was performed using primers specific for ORF57. While DMSO-treated cells reached~9-fold increase in viral DNA load, inhibitor concentrations of 2 μM or higher resulted in a significant reduction (> 30%) in viral DNA ( Fig 5D) . Moreover, the production of infectious KSHV virions in TREx BCBL1-RTA cells was evaluated in the presence of VER-155008 at 2.5 μM or vehicle drug DMSO. For this, cells were reactivated and treated for 72 h, culture medium was centrifuged and incubated for 24 h with HEK-293T cells. Total RNA was then isolated and qRT-PCR carried out. A significant reduction (~80%) in the release of infectious viral progeny was observed in inhibitor-treated cells ( Fig 5E) . Viral transcripts were also quantified at 24 h reactivation in HEK-293T rKSHV.219 cells in the absence or presence of VER-155008. At non-cytotoxic concentrations of 10 μM there was a drastic decrease for all PARP1 was observed faintly. (B) Unreactivated cells were exposed for 24 h to increasing inhibitor concentrations. A reduced number of metabolically active cells accompanied by no increased cytotoxicity was observed in the presence of the inhibitor. There was no activation of effector caspases even in the presence of 60 μM VER-155008. This phenotype is consistent with cell cycle arrest. Results were quantified with ApoTox-Glo Triplex Assay. (C) Immunoblot analysis showing that reactivated cells treated with 40 μM VER-155008 for 24 h resulted in abrogation of viral proteins compared with DMSO-treated samples while cellular proteins remained constant. (D) Cells were reactivated for 24 h to allow robust viral protein expression. Then, DMSO control (0.1%) or VER-155008 was added in conjunction with cycloheximide (CHX) at 100 μg/ml to block de novo protein synthesis. Protein lysates were collected at several times post-CHX addition (0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h) and Western blotting was performed. As previously seen in TREx BCBL1-RTA cells, VER-155008 did not alter the half-life of RTA or ORF57 protein. Hsp70 Isoforms Are Essential for KSHV Lytic Replication Fig 6A) . It is intriguing that ORF57 mRNA levels did not show a clear dose-response with the inhibitor as seen for ORF57 mRNA in TREx BCBL1-RTA cells; however the levels were decreased compared with DMSO-control cells. This is the only transcript of all the viral transcripts tested in both cell lines that did not show a dose-response. However, Western blotting did reveal a complete reduction of ORF57 protein in cells treated with > 40 μM VER-155008 ( Fig 4C) . This suggests that Hsp70 isoforms may also play a role in the folding of ORF57 protein. In fact, Hsc70 has been previously reported to associate with at least 15-20% of newly synthesized proteins during their biogenesis [65] , thus, a role for Hsp70 isoforms in folding viral proteins cannot be ruled out. In order to evaluate cellular transcription activity in the presence of VER-155008, we first determined GAPDH transcript stability in mRNA decay assays using AcD (10 μg/ml) in HEK-293T rKSHV.219 cells. In contrast to TREx BCBL1-RTA cells, GAPDH transcripts were very stable, with no significant reduction in their levels after 10 h of AcD treatment ( Fig 6B) . The half-lives of two cellular transcripts, SRAG (a cellular mRNA export adapter) and histone H2A (H2A.1) were also determined in HEK-293T rKSHV.219 cells. SRAG transcripts were reduced to 50% following 4 h AcD treatment (Fig 6C) , while the H2A.1 mRNA was very unstable with nearly 100% reduction after 2 h AcD treatment ( Fig 6D) . We then plotted the raw C T values for GAPDH transcript from samples in which viral transcripts had been quantified after 24 h of VER-155008 treatment; these did not significantly change in the presence of VER-155008 ( Fig 6E) . Next, the unstable SRAG and H2A.1 mRNAs were measured in the same samples in which viral transcripts had been quantified after 24 h of VER-155008 treatment. In contrast to viral transcripts, both cellular transcripts were not significantly reduced, indicating that transcription of cellular genes was occurring normally even in the presence of high VER-155008 concentrations ( Fig 6F) . Taken together, these results demonstrate that inhibition of Hsp70 isoform function abrogated the expression of viral genes from various temporal classes; however cellular RNA-PII-mediated transcription was not compromised when using VER-155008 at non-cytotoxic concentrations.
