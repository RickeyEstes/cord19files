Growth of BCV and HEV in MDCK I cells MDCK I cells are a subline of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells which differs from other sublines in both functional and morphological characteristics (Richardsonetal ., 1981) . Strain Johannesburg/1 /66 of influenza C virus was found to grow to high titers in this cell line, while another subline-MDCK II-was resistant to infection because of a lack of cell surface receptors (Herrler and Klenk, 1987 ; Szepanski et al ., 1989) . Due to the similarity of the erythrocyte receptors for BCV ISOLATION OF THE ACETYLESTERASE OF CORONAVIRUSES 2 2 3 and influenza C virus, we tried to grow BCV in MDCK I cells . Strain L-9 of BCV, which had been grown previously in bovine cell cultures (Storz and Rott, 1981) , was able to replicate in MDCK I cells without adaptation . Hemagglutination titers of 256 HAU/ml were determined in the supernatant 48 hr p .i . The same growth kinetics was observed with strain NT-9 of HEV, which had been grown previously in porcine cell cultures (Hess and Bachmann, 1978) . These titers are equally high as or higher than those reported for BCV and HEV in other cell lines . Both MDCK-grown coronaviruses were found to have acetylesterase activity . Comparing virus suspensions with the same HA titer, the ability of both viruses to release acetate from p-nitrophenyl acetate was similar, HEV being somewhat more active than BCV (Fig . 1 ) . As expected from previous studies with influenza C virus and BCV (Muchmore and Varki, 1987 ; Vlasak et al., 1 988b) , the esterase activity of the MDCK-grown coronaviruses was abolished after treatment with DFP . This compound inhibits serine esterases and proteases by covalently attaching to the active-site serine . Up to the time of virus harvest no cytopathic changes were detectable in the monolayer of MDCK I cells infected with either BCV or HEV . Virions released into the medium were purified by centrifugation into a sucrose gradient and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . As shown in Fig . 2 for HEV, following Coomassie staining of the gel, the major bands visible are the known structural polypeptides : the nucleocapsid protein N, the membrane protein M, the surface protein S, and the hemagglutinin-esterase protein HE . The latter polypeptide is detected under nonreducing conditions as a disulfide-linked dimer, (HE) z . Several other coronaviruses require two rounds of gradient centrifugation for a satisfying degree of purification . Using the MDCK cell system a single gradient centrifugation step is sufficient to obtain both BCV and HEV in purified form .
