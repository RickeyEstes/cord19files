In this work we aimed to investigate the efficacy of the FML-saponin vaccines in immunotherapy of dogs with visceral leishmaniasis. The anti-FML serological response of the experimentally infected dogs submitted to immunotherapy with FML-QuilA vaccine (dogs 1-5) is represented on Fig. 1(A-D) . The IgG antibody started to increase at day 45 after infection (Fig. 1A) . All animals showed responses above cut-off at day 60, when mild kala-azar symptoms appeared (Table 1) . A rapid anti-FML IgG burst was noted after the first vaccine dose (day 127) reaching a plateau after the third dose (day 187) which was maintained during the whole experiment. On the other hand, the anti-FML IgG subtype responses, were only evident after the onset of vaccination schedule, reaching higher levels of IgG2 than of IgG1 ( Fig. 1B and C) . Dogs 1, 2 and 4, that were olygosymptomatic, became asymptomatic after complete vaccination (Table 1) and maintained a very potent intradermal reaction that disclosed the protective response achieved after FML-QuilA vaccination of these heavily infected animals (Fig. 1D ). Despite these results, dog 2 suddenly died, asymptomatic at day 330 after infection. Dog number 5, although polysymptomatic (Table 1) , survived resistant until the end of the experiment maintaining a positive, although minor IDR (Fig. 1D) .The IDR reaction to the L. donovani promastigote lysate was negative or at the limit of positivity for dog 3 which was polysymptomatic (Table 1) , developed the more rapid increase in IgG1 (Fig. 1B) and died of kala-azar on day 240 after infection ( Table 1 ). The analysis of the evolution of clinical symptoms shows that the protected dogs (1, 2 and 4) became asymptomatic 2 months after the complete vaccination (Table 1) . Leishmania amastigotes were absent from bone marrow smears of these animals at days 120 (before immunotherapy), 240 and 322 after infection, and from skin, spleen, liver, lymphnodes and bone marrow touch biopsies after sacrifice. Our results indicate that protection against visceral leishmaniasis was achieved in 3/5 infected dogs. The PBMC flow cytometry analysis of the FML-QuilAtreated dogs was performed on day 240 after infection. By this time, dog 3 was dead, dog 5 was polsymptomatic, dog 4 was asymtpomatic and dogs 1 and 2 were curing from skin lesions. The animals showed close related values for CD5 and Thy-1 lymphocyte markers ( Table 2 ). The low value for Thy-1 detected for dog 1 is probably an artifact. Although both average values lie outside of the respective healthy dog's confidence interval, they are still close to normal values. CD4 percent values remained within the range of normality, as compared with normal uninfected dogs from the endemic area. It is noteworthy that the CD8 percents were significantly increased in all vaccinated dogs while CD21 percentages remained slight below the confidence interval of normal dogs ( Table 2) . The potential immunotherapic effect of the FML-saponin R vaccine was investigated in a group of 21 L. chagasi naturally infected dogs from endemic area that received three vaccine doses when seropositive to FML but completely asymptomatic. The IgG anti-FML absorbencies oscillated from 0.434 to 0.784 at the beginning of the experiment (cut-off value = 0.433) and increased during the vaccination schedule, reaching their maximum at day 300 and maintaining the plateau until month 22 (Fig. 2A) . The IgG1 levels were high and relatively stable during the whole period (Fig. 2B) while the IgG2 antibodies, on the other hand, showed lower levels at the beginning, significantly increasing towards the end of the first year of experiment and after the first annual vaccine burst, reaching maximal values at month 22 (Fig. 2B) . The DTH response was positive in 79-95% of the animals during the whole experiment (Fig. 2C) . No significant variations with time were detected, either in the proportion of DTH positive reactions (P > 0.05) or in the size of the skin tests (P > 0.05). At month 22, no parasites were present in the dog's bone marrow smears and the PBMC flow cytometry analysis was performed ( Table 2 ). The mean averages of Thy-1 and CD5 population are close to the levels of normal controls and the CD4 and CD21 averages fall within the confidence interval of normal dogs. Only dog 10 showed a decline in CD4 levels being, however, asymptomatic by the time of evaluation. As detected for the FML-QuilA-treated dogs, the FML-saponin R vaccinees showed as well increased levels of CD8 lymphocytes (Table 2) . During the whole period, 19 dogs remained asymptomatic while mild kala-azar symptoms were detected only in two dogs (10%) (Fig. 2F ). The first one (cocker) showed lymphnode swelling, stomatites and fever at month 14. It was treated and cured with allopurinol. The second one (German shepherd) showed popliteal lymphnode enlargement with spontaneous regression at month 22. No parasites were found in smears obtained from these lymphnodes. Twenty-two months after complete vaccination, therefore, 90% of these dogs remain asymptomatic, healthy and parasite free, indicating that the FML-saponin R formulation was effective in inducing protection against visceral leishmaniasis in asymptomatic infected dogs. As a control group, we monitored 46 dogs seropositive to FML and asymptomatic that remained in the field and did not receive any treatment. The anti-FML IgG antibody level of the control group was not different from the vaccine-treated group, both at days 0 or 660 (P > 0.05) (Fig. 2D) . Also, while no differences were detected on the initial values for IgG1 and IgG2, between vaccinated and untreated controls (P > 0.05), the absorbency values at day 660 were lower in the untreated controls (IgG1 and IgG2; P < 0.05). A striking difference in survival rate of the vaccinated or untreated animals was detected confirming the protective potential of the FML-vaccine (Fig. 2F) . On the month 12, 15% of the animals were symptomatic while until the end of month 22, 37% (17/46) dead of kala-azar was recorded among the untreated control dogs. This value accounts for dogs that positivated in immunofluorescent assay, showing characteristic symptomatology and either spontaneously died or were sacrificed by the control program. The number of kala-azar cases could be underestimated since 10% of the untreated controls were lost due to other pathologies or to proprietary migration, and 44% were lost or died under undetermined reasons. Only 9% (n = 5) of the dogs remained alive and asymptomatics, on month 22. The day 660 absorbency values, on Fig. 2D and E, correspond to these survivors. On the other hand, no kala-azar obits were detected and 10% (2/21) of the dogs became symptomatic among the FML-vaccine-treated dogs, until month 22 (Fig. 2F ) disclosing the protective effect of the immunotherapy treatment.
