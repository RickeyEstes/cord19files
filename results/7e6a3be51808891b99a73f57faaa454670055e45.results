Twenty-five articles were identified from the PUBMED/Medline database, and twenty-seven articles were identified from the SCOPUS database with the initial search. Two articles from the PUBMED/Medline database and three articles from the SCOPUS database were excluded because they were not written in English. Sixteen articles were duplicated from the two databases, and thirty-one unique articles were identified from the two databases for assessment of their abstracts using the selection criteria. Eighteen articles were excluded based on their titles and abstracts. Seven articles were further excluded after reading the full text, leaving six articles to be included in the current study. Titles and abstracts of the references of these six articles were further reviewed, and one additional article was included. Therefore, the current study included seven articles for review [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .
