The mean values of laboratory indexes at the time of hospital admission in NCIP patients and CAP patients were demonstrated in table 1 and figure 1. Both NCIP patients and CAP patients had lower mean lymphocyte counts and platelet counts than healthy control. NCIP patients had significantly lower mean values for WBC, neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet counts, and ALP than did patients with CAP. NCIP patients had significantly higher mean values for hemoglobin, hematocrit, ALB, ALT, and AST than did CAP patients. There were no significant differences in mean values of erythrocyte mean levels of globulin (GLB), All rights reserved.
