In our hospital database, we found 352 patients with different types of asthma who had been treated at the Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Saarland, Germany, during the study period of 2011 to 2012. A total of 296 patients with asthma met the inclusion criteria for this trial. A total of 31 (10.47%, 95% CI, 6.98-13.96) patients with asthma were infested by germs microbiologically detected in their tracheal secretion. The most patients in this group were diagnosed with non-specified asthma, followed by allergic asthma, and the same-sized small groups of non-allergic and mixed asthmas (Table 1) . Following the results of this study, we could not find any evidence of microorganisms as a causal source of asthma (P ¼ 0.893, Table 1 ). Acute infection thus did not play a role in bacterial colonization in the respiratory tract of asthmatics (P ¼ 0.472). One of the smallest groups in this study, mixed asthma, was the most comparatively prone to microbial attacks caused by acute infections. In contrast, acute infections did not play a significant role in allergic asthmatics, the secondlargest group with microbial contamination in the respiratory tract (P ¼ 0.472). A statically significant difference was found between the 4 groups in terms of their age distribution (P ¼ 0.034). There were relatively more women affected by germs, without statistical significance (P ¼ 0.111), except in the group with allergic asthma. Diagnostic tools did not have any influence on the microbiological results in asthmatics (Table 1) . A comparison of the different species showed an increased incidence of individual microbes, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Respiratory synctial virus, and Candida albicans, but without statistical significance ( Table 2 ). The comparison of the blood test, lung function test, FeNO, and blood gas analysis results revealed no significant difference between the 4 asthma groups (Table 3) . Skin allergy testing presented various medical diagnoses of allergies in all groups of asthma patients (Table 4) . No difference was found between the groups when comparing the allergens, non-allergic asthmatics were allergic to adhesive, although most asthmatics had no plaster allergy in this study (P ¼ 0.033). The comparison of food and drug allergies between groups was without statistical significance (Table 5 ). Allergies and various comorbidities investigated in this study showed no statistical differences between the 4 asthma groups ( Table 6 ). The duration of hospital stay was 11 AE 8.8 days in the allergic asthma group, 13 in the non-allergic, 11.5 AE 3.54 in the mixed, and 6.5 AE 6.87 in the non-specified, which is not a statistically significant difference (P ¼ 0.407).
