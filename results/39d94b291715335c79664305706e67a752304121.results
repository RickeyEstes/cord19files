From November 2010 to July 2012, 290 children were recruited from the 301 hospitalized patients eligible. Eleven eligible patients refused to participate in the study, and they did not differ from included patients for age, sex or diagnosis on admission. The baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 . The sex ratio (male/female) was 1.3. The mean of age was 1.1 years [95% CI: 1.0 to 1.2], the age range was from 1 day to 5 years, and 250 (86%) patients were 2 years old or younger. The diagnoses on admission (Table S1 ) were significantly different between the age groups: bronchiolitis was found more frequently among patients under 6 months old (55%, p,0.01); LTRI and pneumonia were more frequent among patients aged over 12 months (respectively, 68% and 85%,p,0.01). Forty-nine (17%) patients had at least one underlying disease, with asthma being the most frequent (5%). Some of the children had underlying conditions, particularly atopy (52; 18%) and passive exposure to tobacco smoke (113; 39%). Seventy-one (24%) had been hospitalized during the previous 12 months. Patients aged under 18 months had significantly more prior hospitalisations (p = 0.01). The difference between sexes was not statistically significant. Around 45% (131/290) of patients had been treated with antibiotics before hospitalisation (Table S2 ). Significantly more patients under than over 12 months old had received antibiotic treatment before hospitalisation (p,0.01). The difference between sex was not statistically significant. The frequency of bacterial detection was lower in the group with prior antibiotic treatment (49% versus 65%, p = 0.01). No such relationship was found for viral results. Accurate information about immunisation was available on vaccination cards for 82 (26%) children. Eighty-seven percent of children had completed vaccination against BCG, 77% had received one Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccination. No child was vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae and only two were vaccinated against influenza. The average of duration of hospitalisation was 7.9 days [95% CI: 7.1 to 8.6], range 1 to 79 days. The median duration of hospitalisation was 7 days, and 61% of patients were hospitalised for more than 7 days. The duration of hospitalisation for living patients was 8.0 [7.2-8.7 ] days, and for fatal cases was 3.9 [1.4-9.2]. There were no significant differences between sex and age groups. Discharge information was available for all cases: 79% (230/ 290) of patients fully recovered without any complication during their hospital stay; the condition of 60 children worsened during hospitalisation, and nine patients (3%) died. All deaths were of children under 18 months of age, and six (67%) were of children less than 6 months old. For the patients who died, Streptococcus pneumoniae (56%, 5/9) was the pathogen most frequently detected, followed RSV (33%, 3/9) and Influenza type A virus (22% 2/9). For multivariate analysis of factors possibly associated with coinfection, sex, age group, number of rooms in the home and antibiotic treatment before hospitalisation were included in the initial model. The multivariate analysis indicated that children under 36 months of age were more often infected by more than one pathogen; the difference was statistically significant for the 19-24 months old group (adjusted OR = 8.0) ( Table 1) . Previous antibiotic treatment before hospitalization was a significantly protective factor against co-infection (OR = 0.5). In univariate analysis, Influenza A, Rhinovirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenza type B were significantly associated with co-infections. Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumo- niae were most often associated with co-infection (Adjusted OR = 20.5 and 11.1, respectively) ( Table 1) . Univariate analysis showed that a severe outcome was significantly more frequent for patients with comorbidity (OR = 3.9), including prematurity or congenital disease (such as heart disease or cerebral malformation). Also, two of the three patients presenting with malnutrition died. Hospitalization during the 12 months prior to admission was also associated with a severe outcome (OR = 2.1). A low household income, of less than 455 US$ (less than 182 US$ OR = 4.4 and between 182 and 455 US$ OR = 3.5) was associated with severe outcomes. For multivariate analysis, age group, monthly household income, admission diagnosis, comorbidities, previous hospitalisation, and infection with influenza virus type A, RSV and rhinovirus were included in the initial model. Multivariate analysis (Table 3 ) adjusted for these variables showed that age below 6 months (OR = 5.3), living in a household with low income (OR = 4.1), and the presence of comorbidities (OR = 4.6) were significantly aggravating factors. Infection with an influenza type A virus was a significantly protective factor against a severe outcome (OR = 0.4 [95% CI = 0.2-0.9]).
