During the 2003 outbreak in Hong Kong, a total of 1755 probable SARS patients (WHO criteria) 13 had been treated in 14 acute general hospitals under HA. As per defined exclusion criteria, 468 patients were excluded for reasons shown in Table 1 , resulting in a final cohort of major corticosteroid groups consisting of 1287 patients. The demographic and clinical parameters of these 1287 patients from 14 acute hospitals in Hong Kong are shown in Table 2 . The majority of patients, totalling 1188 (92.3%), had received corticosteroid. Two hospitals had used centre-specific treatment protocols 3,5 on most of their patients throughout the outbreak, in which the dosages and types of corticosteroids used were clearly defined, while the other 12 hospitals had utilised two or more corticosteroid regimens. Patients were grouped based on the commonest corticosteroid types used in 1188 patients, in order of frequency, as follows: hydrocortisone (Group HC), methylprednisolone (Group MP), pulsed methylprednisolone (Group Pulse), and prednisolone (Group P). Only 99 patients received no steroid (Group No Steroid) and were distributed in 13 hospitals. A step-down strategy in corticosteroid dosages was observed in all steroid treatment groups unless deterioration occurred which called for the use of pulsed methylprednisolone rescue. Details of individual patients in the Group No Steriod were not retrieved, but to our knowledge some patients had minor disease diagnosed only on or after discharge (in particular in the early part of the outbreak before the virus was identified and diagnostic tests developed), some presented late in the course of the outbreak with atypical symptoms (such as diarrhoea), while some physicians did not believe in administering corticosteroid in this unknown disease. All baseline characteristics and clinical parameters on admission were statistically different among the groups (Table 2 ). In particular, Group P consisted of the youngest patients with the largest number of health care workers (47%) and the mildest disease on admission, as evidenced by the lowest median CXR score, normal respiratory status and absence of ARDS. Group MP had the highest median CXR score on admission. The two groups with the highest prevalence of ARDS on admission (8.3% and 8.2% for Groups Pulse and No Steroid, respectively) also had the highest mortality rates (30% and 28.3%, respectively). Overall, crude death rates were lowest for Group P and Group MP. Table 3aec shows the details of 1188 patients who had received corticosteroids. Table 3a shows that general characteristics were significantly different amongst the groups. Steroid commencement was earliest in Group HC and latest in Group Pulse [median Days 4 (IQR 3e6) and 6 (IQR 4e8), respectively, after symptom onset]. Among the groups, Group MP had the lowest proportion of patients requiring pulsed corticosteroid rescue (41% compared to 53e100% in the other groups), which was also given at the latest time point (median Day 9 after symptom onset, compared to Days 6e8 in the other groups). The total cumulative corticosteroid dosage was highest in Group Pulse, while duration of steroid treatment was shortest in Group P (median 15 days) and longest in Group MP (median 21 days), the latter of which was dictated by protocol. 3 Table 3b shows the patients' clinical parameters at corticosteroid commencement. Group P still had the mildest disease. Comparatively, Group MP and Group Pulse had the worst clinical status as evidenced by the highest percentages of patients with ARDS (9.4% and 18.1%, respectively) and the highest median CXR score [4 (IQR 2e7) and 5 (IQR 2e9), respectively]. Table 3c shows the clinical parameters at pulsed corticosteroid commencement. Group P consistently had the mildest disease, with the lowest median CXR score and only 12.4% of patients in either ALI or ARDS. In contrast, patients in Group MP had the worst clinical status with the highest median CXR score, with 45.9% having either ALI or ARDS. To remove possible confounding effects due to ribavirin, 68 patients not having been treated with ribavirin (50 from Group No Steroid, 11 from Group HC, 1 from Group MP, 5 from Group P and 1 from Group Pulse) were excluded from further analyses of the final outcomes. Among the 99 patients in Group No Steroid, comparison between the 50 patients who had not and the 49 who had received ribavirin by univariate analysis failed to show any significant difference in demographics and all other characteristics including co-morbidity, percentage with laboratory confirmation and percentage of health care workers, admission parameters (respiratory status, white cell count, neutrophils, LDH, CXR scores), as well as major outcomes (data not shown). Univariate comparisons of the characteristics between survivors and fatal cases among 1219 patients (Table 4 ) indicated that age, sex, comorbidity, worst respiratory status at Days 8 to 10, worst X-ray score, LDH ratio, WBC and neutrophil counts on admission and corticosteroid treatment reached statistical significance (P < 0.05). In 1032 patients with complete data for multivariate analysis, the aggregate effect of corticosteroid usage compared with Group No steroid on survival was insignificant after controlling for age, sex, co-morbidity, highest CXR score, worst respiratory status at Days 8e10 and WBC on admission. Fig. 1 shows that Group P had the lowest percentage of survivors who had positive bacterial cultures throughout hospitalisation. Group MP, which had received the highest total dosage of corticosteroid (Table 3a) , showed slightly higher rates after Days 1e7, and both these groups also had the highest survival rates. Groups HC, No Steroid and Pulse had comparatively higher culture rates after Day 22 and higher mortality rates. Group HC had the highest positive culture and antifungal treatment rates while Groups P and MP had similar low rates. New cases of tuberculosis were uncommon, and again the rate was highest for Group HC.
