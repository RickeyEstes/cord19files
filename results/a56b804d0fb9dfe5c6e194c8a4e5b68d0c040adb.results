Raw data, including the demographic and clinical characteristics as well as the laboratory, CXR, LUS and microbiological results of patients, are presented in the Supplement (Supplementary dataset). Demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics. We included 73 (49.7%) females and 74 (50.3%) males. Pneumonia was caused by bacteria, atypical bacteria and viruses in 75 (51.0%), 20 (13.6%) and 52 (35.4%) subjects, respectively. The demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of participants according to the aetiology of CAP are presented in Table 1 . Blood culture was positive in only 4 patients (5.3% of all subjects with bacterial CAP), and Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in all cases. chest X-ray. CXR was performed in 120 (81.6%) patients with CAP; pneumonic infiltrates were detected in 92 (76.7%) of them. Infiltrates were detected in 50 (79.4% of those who underwent CXR) patients with bacterial CAP, in 12 (80.0%) patients with atypical bacterial CAP and in 30 (71.4%) patients with viral CAP. The radiological characteristics of patients who had CAP detected with CRX (in addition to LUS) are presented in Table 2 . Lung ultrasound. LUS was performed at admission in all 147 patients; multiple consolidations were detected in 60 (40.8%) and bilateral consolidations in 42 (28.6%) of them. A comparison of LUS characteristics in different types of CAP is presented in Table 3 . The ROC curve analysis ( Fig. 2) found that the optimal cut-off for discriminating between the bacterial and viral CAP is a consolidation size of 21 mm, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 75% for diagnosing bacterial CAP. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.85 (95% CI 0.79-0.92, p < 0.001). Similarly, the optimal cut-off for discriminating between the bacterial and atypical bacterial CAP is a consolidation size of 21 mm, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 60% to diagnose bacterial CAP. The area under the ROC curve was 0.68 (95% CI 0.52-0.85, p = 0.012). Regarding the discrimination between atypical bacterial CAP and viral CAP, the AUC was 0.65 (95% CI 0.50-0.80, p = 0.051). A weak positive correlation was found between the size of the (largest) consolidation and the WBC count (ρ = 0.28, p < 0.001). Single consolidation, two consolidations, three consolidations and four (or more) consolidations were detected with LUS in 87 (59.2%), 21 (14.3%), 14 (9.5%) and 25 (17.0%) patients, respectively. A weak to moderate negative correlation was observed between the number of consolidations and the WBC count (ρ = −0.35, p < 0.001). A significant agreement was found between the LUS and CXR regarding the presence of bilateral consolidations (κ = 0.45, p < 0.001). Follow-up LUS was performed in 111 (75.5%) patients, of whom 58, 14 and 39 patients had bacterial, atypical bacterial and viral CAP, respectively. A regression of consolidations was observed in 56 (96.6%), 7 (50.0%) and 13 (33.3%) patients with bacterial, atypical bacterial and viral CAP, respectively. Of these, we found a complete resolution of consolidations in 16 (27.6%), 2 (14.3%) and 1 (2.6%) patient with bacterial, atypical bacterial and viral CAP, respectively. A regression of consolidations was significantly more common in bacterial CAP than in viral CAP (p < 0.001, OR = 56.00 with 95% CI 11.77-266.41) and in bacterial CAP than in atypical bacterial CAP (p < 0.001, OR = 28.00 with 95% CI 4.83-162. 25 ). There was no significant difference in the regression of consolidations between atypical bacterial and viral CAP (p = 0.341, OR = 0.50 with 95% CI 0. 15-1.73 ). In addition, we analysed the association of LUS characteristics with the aetiology of CAP (viral vs. bacterial) using a regression model to adjust for age, sex, and laboratory characteristics. The regression model was statistically significant (p < 0.001), with 83.6% of the dependent variable variability explained. The accuracy of Scientific RepoRtS | (2019) 9:17957 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-54499-y www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the model was 90.9%. The size of the largest consolidation in the model was still significant for bacterial CAP (p < 0.001; OR = 1.13 with 95% CI 1.04-1.23). The presence of bilateral consolidations also remained significant (p = 0.042; OR = 0.05 with 95% CI 0.01-0.86) in favour of a decreased probability for bacterial CAP. When all the clinical characteristics were included in the logistic regression analysis, the regression model remained highly significant (p < 0.001), and the accuracy of the model increased to 93.3%. The size of the consolidation remained significant for bacterial pneumonia (p = 0.041; OR = 1.09 with 95% CI 1.01-1. 19 ).
