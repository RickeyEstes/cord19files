To determine the genetic diversity of PRRS viruses in the Netherlands, the ORF2-ORF7 sequences of 74 viruses, originated from different regions were compared with sequences in GenBank. All investigated viruses belong to PRRSV-1 (Fig 1) . Twelve viruses had a nucleotide similarity of 98.6-99.8% with Porcilis PRRS vaccine (strain DV; Genbank acc.no. KF991509) and are therefore considered as vaccine derived viruses (similarity >98%). Most other Dutch viruses seem to be divergent from other available sequences in GenBank with only a similarity of 87.5-90.0% with Lelystad virus (GenBank M96262), the type 1 reference strain. As a result, most isolates form a distinct Dutch cluster in the phylogenetic tree, based on the ORF2-ORF7 sequences (Fig 1) . Furthermore, within this Dutch cluster a high genetic diversity among the Dutch strains was observed (S2 Table) . For instance, nucleotide identity between NL/GD-2-8/ 2014 (84.7-89.3%), NL/GD-7-5/2016 (84.6-88.3%), NL/GD-4-5/2015 (84.6-89.1%) and NL/ GD-6-18/2016 (85.9-89.4%) was below 90% (viruses illustrated in blue, S2 Table) . Three viruses were placed with other European strains (Fig 1) , however the similarity with these strains is not high: NL/GD-2-9/2014 and NL/GD-3-7/2014 were placed with Belgium strains (GU737265 and KT159248) and are 90-92% similar and NL/GD-5-18/2015 versus the Austrian strain (KU494019) results in a nucleotide identity of only 90%. The distribution of the frequency of the similarities with Lelystad virus in percentages is presented for the complete ORF2-ORF7 sequence and for the individual ORF genes (S1 appendix). ORF6 and ORF7 have the highest nucleotide identity with Lelystad virus. Although lower similarities can be seen in ORF5, the lowest average similarity with Lelystad virus was observed in ORF3, since five viruses had lower nucleotide identities than 82% (S1 appendix and S2 Table) . While the length of ORF2, ORF5, ORF6 and ORF7 seems conserved compared to the Lelystad reference strain (GenBank: M96262), the length of ORF3 and ORF4 are quite diverse among the isolates (Fig 2 and S3 Table) . For ORF3, no less than eight variants in length were observed and five lengths were found more than once (Fig 2) . All deletions found in ORF3 are positioned at the 3'-end of this gene and affect automatically ORF4, since the open reading frames overlap. Two viruses (NL/GD-2-8/2014 and NL/GD-3-7/2014) with a short ORF3 length of 732 nucleotides are not caused by deletions, but due to an alternative stop codon. The prediction of the amount of putative N-glycosylation sites for ORF3 varied from 4-7 (S4 Table) . For ORF4, three variants in length in the Dutch strains (Fig 2) were observed, and whereas most Dutch viruses contain four N-glycosylation sites, two viruses have 5 putative sites (S4 Table) . The one ORF6 sequence (519 nucleotides) with a codon missing (Fig 2) , seemed to be unique among the known ORF6 sequences in GenBank. Besides analysing the complete ORF2-ORF7 sequences of 74 Dutch PRRS viruses, the individual ORFs were also compared with sequences in GenBank in phylogenetic trees (Fig 3) . For some viruses the phylogenetic topology varied per ORF. For instance, NL/GD-4-13/2015 was placed with viruses NL/GD-3-19/2014 and NL/GD-6-7/2016 in ORF5 and ORF6, whereas in ORF2, ORF3, ORF4 and ORF7 no clustering can be seen (Fig 3, highlighted in green) . Another example is the clustering of NL/GD-3-11/2015 with NL/GD-2-9/2014 and NL/GD-3-7/2014 (Belgium-likes) in ORF2 and ORF3, whereas in ORF4, ORF5, ORF6 and ORF7 NL/GD-3-11/ 2015 seems to be a totally different virus (Fig 3, highlighted in purple) . The most striking example is strain NL/GD-5-18/2015 that clustered with Austrian AUT/15-33/2015 (GenBank KU494019) in the phylogenetic trees constructed from complete ORF2, ORF3, ORF4 and ORF5 sequences (86.3-89.5% similarity), whereas in the ORF6 and ORF7 trees it clustered (96.2-96.9% identity) with Lelystad virus (Fig 3, highlighted in red; S2 Table) .
