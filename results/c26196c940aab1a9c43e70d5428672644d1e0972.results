Approximately 700 proteases are known in rodents. To reduce the number of candidate proteases we showed first that a model mAb (prone to proteolytic degradation) incubated in conditioned medium of CHO-K1 cells resulted in clipping of the mAb, demonstrating the involvement of secreted/shedded proteases (Fig. 1a) . Broad spectrum inhibitors of the different protease classes revealed that only serine protease inhibitors prevented clipping. Serine protease inhibitors of higher specificity highlighted the group of "S1A trypsin-like proteases" (Fig. 1a) . Comparison of the proteolytic degradation profile of several therapeutic proteins between CHO-K1 with another CHO cell line (CHO-A) revealed less degradation in CHO-A. Therefore expression of the involved protease(s) is likely lower in CHO-A. Gene expression profile analysis of both cell lines showed five secreted/shedded "S1A trypsin-like serine proteases" more than 1.5 fold lower expressed in CHO-CHO-A versus CHO-K1 (Fig. 1b) . Surprisingly, siRNA knockdown experiments of these five candidates identified "Matriptase" as the major protease involved in degradation of recombinant proteins expressed in CHO-K1 cells ( Fig. 1c upper panel) . Next, we generated a CHO-K1 matriptase knockout (KO) cell line. No proteolytic degradation product was detected when the model mAb was spiked into conditioned medium of the KO cell line (Fig. 1c lower panel) . Also, stable expression of the model mAb in the KO cell line resulted in no/significantly less clipping (Fig. 1e) . The protein titer and the cell growth behaviour of the matriptase KO cells were similar to the corresponding wildtype (wt) cells (Fig. 1d) as shown by comparative cultivation in AMBR system. Conclusions One major challenge for the production of recombinant proteins is CHO host cell mediated proteolytic degradation which can negatively impact or even result in termination of projects [2; 3] . Using a variety of techniques such as applying protease inhibitors, transcriptomics and siRNA mediated knock-down we were able to identify "matriptase" as the major protease involved in degradation of recombinant proteins expressed in CHO-K1 cells. Subsequently we generated a matriptase deficient CHO cell line. Protein candidates of diverse formats, severely degraded in wt CHO-K1 cell line, were not or significantly less cleaved in the matriptase KO cell line. Furthermore cell growth, viability and productivity levels were comparable between the wt and the matriptase KO cell line. In summary, we have generated a superior platform-compatible CHO production host cell line with the same favourable productivity properties as the parental host cell line [4; 6] , allowing expression of complex glycoproteins prone to clipping. Background CHO cell lines are common hosts for the production of biopharmaceutical proteins. So far, considerable progress has been made increasing productivity of cell culture to meet the rapidly growing demand for antibody biopharmaceuticals through increased cell densities and longer culture times. The downside is the increase of the process related impurities, bringing new challenges for process and harvest development. Among the process related impurities such as host cell proteins (HCPs) or DNA the potential impact of lipids production and release during cell culture is still poorly understood due to the complex nature and diversity of this class of molecules. Thanks to recent advances in analytical tools especially mass spectrometry, the advent of lipidomics offers now the feasibility to study several thousands of lipid species thus unraveling the possibility to understand and potentially control the interactions between high performance bioreactor processes, harvest conditions and purification. Lipid from CHO cells were successfully extracted with a yield between 80% and 95% depending on the different lipid classes. Stable isotope labeled lipids were used as internal standard in order to have comparable results between batches. The obtained results (Fig. 1) show that for a given cell line, lipid distribution is changing over the process. Moreover, this distribution may vary significantly depending on the cell line: CL-1 and in a lower extend, CL-3, show an accumulation of triglycerides from day 6 to the end of the process, while CL-2 doesn't seems to follow this trend. Conclusion Interestingly, in some cell lines/experimental conditions, we highlighted an overproduction of triglycerides and cholesterol leading to the accumulation of lipid droplets known as energy storage sink. At the metabolic level, these findings suggest a relative overflow of the carbon metabolism. From a process development perspective these findings can be considered on the one hand as a resource waste since the stored energy is not used for protein/biomass biosynthesis and on the second hand as the root cause of additional process challenges especially during the harvest and the first capture steps given the hydrophobic nature of these molecules. Implementation of lipidomics analysis enables us to highlight a new type of process variability and to anticipate potential problems for the downstream steps. The application of this methodology on our platform has helped us to design tailor made solutions (pretreatment selection, filter selection,…) at the clarification step which are now implemented in our harvest development platform approach. . Matriptase knock-out in CHO cells prevents clipping of recombinant proteins. a Serine protease inhibitors protect model mAb from proteolytic degradation in CHO-K1 cell derived conditioned medium. The model mAb was incubated in conditioned medium for 0h or 48h at 37°C, subsequently samples were analyzed by western blot. Broad spectrum serine protease inhibitors (Aprotinin, Leupetin) were added during incubation. Aprotinin and Leupetin are inhibiting proteolytic degradation. The intact mAb (upper band) and the clipped mAb (lower band) are indicated by arrows. b Gene expression profiling of CHO-K1 versus CHO-A by NGS. Shown is the gene expression profile of "secreted/shedded members of the S1A trypsin-like serine protease family" for CHO-K1 and CHO-A cell lines using next generation sequencing. The gene expression analysis highlights that five proteases were more than 1.5 fold higher expressed in CHO-K1 cells (labelled with a red asterix). The y-axis shows the transcript abundance as RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads). c siRNA knock-down identifies matriptase as major clipping protease and CHO matriptase KO clone shows no detectable clipping activity. Upper figure: siRNAs directed against the five protease genes and scrambled (scr.) siRNA were transfected and conditioned medium was collected three days after transfection. The model mAb was incubated in fresh medium as control (first lane) and conditioned medium from the siRNA transfected cells. Samples were analyzed by western blot. Only siRNA targeting matriptase (ST14) showed reduced proteolytic degradation. The intact mAb (upper band) and the clipped mAb (lower band) are indicated by arrows. Lower figure: The model mAb was incubated for 48h in conditioned medium collected from wt CHO-K1 as well as the matriptase knockout clone. Samples were analyzed by western blot. The intact mAb (upper band) and the clipped mAb (lower band) are indicated by arrows. No proteolytic degradation could be detected in the samples originating from the matriptase KO clone. d Cell growth, viability and productivity in AMBR (fed batch with temperature shift). Cell growth, viability and volumetric productivity profiles of wt CHO-K1 (red circles, N=2) and matriptase KO clone (blue squares, N=1) cultivated in 15-mL AMBR. No significant differences were seen between WT and matriptase KO clone regarding cell growth and viability. Comparable or slightly higher productivity was detected for the matriptase KO clone compared to the WT. e Significant reduced proteolytic clipping applying matriptase KO clone. The model mAb was stable expressed in CHO-K1 (WT) as well as the CHO-K1 matriptase KO clone. Samples were analyzed by western blot. The intact mAb (upper band) and the clipped mAb (lower band) are indicated by arrows. Significant reduced proteolytic degradation could be detected in the samples originating from the matriptase KO clone (3 samples each is shown for wt and KO cells) PEIpro® is the reagent of choice for virus production runs in most adherent and suspension cell culture systems from process development up to large scale clinical-grade virus production. Irrespective of the cell culture-based system and production scale, PEIpro® and PEIpro®-HQ have led to efficient viral vector yields in standard laboratory cell systems, such as in flasks, cell factories, and roller bottles, as well as in multilayers flasks or fixed-bed culture systems that take into account time and space concerns for the scaling-up process (Table 1) . For example, high viral vector yields superior to 10 7 IG/mL and 10 11 -10 12 VG/mL were obtained respectively for lentiviruses and AAVs in suspension HEK-293T and HEK-293 cells cultured in one of the commercially available synthetic cell culture medium BalanCD® HEK293 (Irvine Scientific®). Conclusion PEIpro® and its higher quality grade PEIpro®-HQ are the unique PEI suitable for efficient and reproducible production of therapeutic viral vectors. Efficient viral vector production yields can be achieved in most cell culture systems, irrespective of the production scale. With appropriate and advanced quality controls, the highest quality grade PEIpro®-HQ is commercially available to accompany academics and biopharmaceutical companies in terms of qualified raw material for their GMP-grade viral vector production needs. b Distinction between Fc and Fab glycosylation in Erbitux. Erbitux was diluted to a concentration of 200 μg/mL in TRIS buffer and measured in native and denatured conditions to distinguish Fab glycosylation (native Erbitux) from Fab and Fc glycosylation (denatured Erbitux). It could be confirmed that sialic acids are almost exclusively present on the Fab part of Erbitux and that the high mannose glycans are only found in the Fc part. c Lectin binding rates correlate with the levels of galactosylation and fucosylation. Two glycan variants samples of the same IgG from Merck were mixed in different ratios to yield glycosylation rates of 9 to 55% in terminal β-galactose and 8 to 100% in core-fucose, based on data from 2-AB UPLC analysis. The mixtures all contained 0.5 μg IgG per well. The measured lectin binding rates for all galactose and fucose markers correlate very well with the respective degree of glycosylation in the mixtures. All measurements were performed in triplicates (Irvine  Scientific®) . HEK-293T (lentivirus) and HEK-293 (AAV) cells were thawed directly into each medium and passaged every 3 to 4 days before going into a 2 Liter benchtop bioreactor. Cells were seeded and cultured for 3 days before being transfected by PEIpro® (Polyplus). For transfection, four plasmids were used for lentivirus and three plasmids were used for AAV. Lentiviral and AAV titer were measured 48 and 72 hours post transfection (Data kindly provided by Généthon) Table 1 (abstract P-004). PEIpro®, the reagent of choice for virus production runs in most cell culture systems in both adherent and suspension cells. Irrespective of the cell culture-based system and production scale, PEIpro® and PEIpro®-HQ have led to efficient viral vector yields superior to 10 7 IG/mL and 10 9 VG/mL, respectively for lentiviruses and AAVs Background Continuous perfusion process is making a comeback as a competing upstream manufacturing technology for the production of Biopharmaceuticals compared to the standard fed batch processes. This is primarily because of cost advantages such as reduced capital cost and increased product yield. The change in status of perfusion process from older perfusion to the new-age perfusion is due to availability of better cell retention devices leading to more efficient processes, improved cell lines, cell culture medium capable of supporting high cell densities and better bioreactor control strategies. In this work, we present the advantages, limitations and challenges of fed batch and perfusion type of processes through case studies. Table 1 Results The CHO cell culture cultivated under low nutrient conditions reached a 54% higher viable cell density than the reference culture (Fig. 1a) . The product titer was even increased by 109% (Fig. 1b) . The spent media analysis shows that some amino acids and vitamins were present at presumably limiting concentrations after day 5/6, mostly in the low nutrient level culture (down to 40 to 190 μM for TYR, GLN, ARG, and ASN, below 1 μM for pyridoxine, data not shown). The product quality showed significant changes for the changed feeding strategy ( Fig. 1c and d) . As expected, the glycation level decreased from 3% to 1% compared to the reference culture. The truncation level of C-terminal lysine at the heavy chain of the mAB increased from 79% to 88%. The glycosylation was also significantly influenced by the low nutrient level (Fig. 1e) : The nonfucosylated variants increased from 3% to 6% (Fig. 1f) , the degree of galactosylation increased from 31% to 39% (Fig. 1g) . The application of the cell culture automation is shown for two examples. The goal in the first application was to identify levers to reduce trisulfides. By a screening of 39 conditions in parallel (in 4-fold replication, 158 wells in sum) the reduction of Trisulfides by 97.5 % (normalized to start level) was possible. In addition the levers for Trisulfide reduction were identified. The best and start conditions were verified in bioreactor scale (Fig. 1c) . The goal in the second application was to increase product concentration without an impact on product quality. By a screening of 54 conditions in parallel (in 4-fold replication, 216 wells in sum) the increase of titer from 1.5 g/L to 3.7 g/L (> factor 2) was possible by media platform change and media optimization. An impact on product quality could not been shown. The best conditions were also verified in bioreactor scale (Fig. 1d) . We found that positively charged depth filters were suitable to clarify OMV suspensions. The cell culture medium, in which the OMV was produced, influenced the outcome of the depth filtration. A log reduction value (LRV) of 0.87 was determined for OMV present in serum-containing medium (SCM), whereas the titer of OMV in serumfree medium (SFM) was reduced 1.63 log levels. This indicates that without serum in the surrounding liquid, OMV will adsorb to the filter material. However, we must evaluate if the missing serum or other components present in SFM are responsible for this effect. Total protein was not relevantly reduced by the clarification using charged depth filters. For OMV present in SCM, the residual protein content was slightly less compared to OMV present in SFM (Table 1 ). In contrast, host cell DNA (hcDNA) was bound to the filter material. We achieved a 33% reduction of hcDNA for an OMV suspension in SFM. After clarifying an OMV suspension in SFM, the remaining hcDNA content was even lower being only 42 %. Conclusions Charged depth filters are suitable for the first clarification step of OMV downstream processing. Residual protein could pass the depth Scheme of the complete cell line development workflow support in Genedata Bioprocess. Showcasing integration of data from diverse measurement instruments, data visualization for decision making support as well as, tracking of full clone history filter almost unhindered, whereas the hcDNA content was already reduced to 42% at maximum. However, the OMV titer was also reduced by the depth filtration. This undesired effect was stronger for the OMV present in SFM. Because the agencies require avoiding serum in clinical-grade production processes, this is disadvantageous. Nonetheless, because SFM will be soon standard for OMV production, further experiments have to be done preventing the OMV reduction during clarification. One option can be to reduce the adsorption strength of the virus to the filter material by the addition of salt. Moreover, it is important to establish a standardized protocol for the upstream processing. We determined batch-to-batch variations within the clarification indicating a strong impact of upstream processing (USP) on the outcome of the DSP. Therefore, further studies must investigate the influence of USP parameter e.g. time of harvest and pH of the harvest solution on the OMV. High biosimilarity must be demonstrated by physicochemical and functional characterization for approval requirements of phase I and phase III studies in terms of efficacy, safety and immunogenicity. In this study, rounds of upstream and downstream processes were run to reach the CQA limits of the originator molecule. After conducting many different development strategies, the mirror plot images of the intact deconvoluted mass were found to be identical corresponding to similar levels of glycoforms. The UV chromatogram of reversed phase ultraperformance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) of tryptic peptide mapping demonstrated that the primary structure of TUR01 is identical to the originator as shown in Fig. 1a . Post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as oxidation, deamidation, N-terminal pyroglutamic acid, C-terminal lysine truncation levels were also comparable for two products. The glycosylation site (HC-Asn301) was confirmed by peptide mapping analysis and 100% glycan site occupancy was proven for TUR01 and originator. The glycosylation pattern for two products were highly similar in terms of major glycans (G0F, G1F, G0F-GN and etc.). Man5 level was lower in TUR01 compared to the originator product which may not have any clinical effect on the molecule. The secondary structure was determined by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Absorption bands (Amide I and Amide II) were overlapped completely and amounts of α-helix and β-sheet structures were comparable. Furthermore; size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis revealed that both products have the same level of purity (>99%) and aggregate (<1%) levels. The level of impurities were determined as below 4% by CE-SDS. The capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) experiments showed that the charge variant profiles of two products are indistinguishable and the isoelectric point of main peak is observed at 8.3 for both products. The association/dissociation rate constants and binding affinity for both TUR01 and originator were highly similar and similarity score was calculated greater than 99%, as shown in Fig. 1b . Using the cell settling method described above we have been able to achieve ≥90% cell retention efficiency. All media tested in this work were able to reach and maintain the 30x10 6 vc/mL target cell density at 1vvd (Fig. 1) . Performance of each media formulation was ranked based on specific productivity (Table 1) . Using "Intermediate Prototype", minimum steady-state CSPR was determined to be 33.3pL/c/d for this cell line. N-glycan analysis of ambr®15 and bioreactor samples via intact mass spectrometry displayed only slight differences in product quality profile (data not shown). The transfection process was modified to address the reduced titres and higher viable cell density (VCD) seen in the SUB cultures. Shake flask cultures were used to assess the standard (A) and modified transfection processes (B and C) (Fig. 1 , i & ii). Process C was identified as the process to be studied at SUB scale, offering the potential to mitigate the high viable cell densities (VCD) observed. Scaling up process C to 50L and 250L SUB resulted in cultures producing titres exceeding 1g/L with desired cell growth profiles. Based on extensive analytical data, the obtained response surface model provides a clear insight into the impact of particular TE and their combinations on process performance and product quality. The high model quality enables discriminations between clone dependent and clone independent effects. With an elevation in titer up to 25% in the best condition of the cell lines clearly show, that even state-of-the-art media can be outperformed by trace element rebalancing. Analyzing specific rates in combination with metabolic flux analysis improves the understanding of metabolic restructuring of the cell lines under distinct TE levels and combinations. Modulation of trace elements levels had a tremendous effect on the charge heterogeneity and glycosylation structure of the different proteins. This provides a toolbox for the fine tuning and control of product quality parameters. Of salient interest, we also demonstrated that various binding kinetic signatures, especially different dissociation kinetics could be correlated with distinct mAb glycosylation patterns and with therapeutic efficacies, as deduced from mass spectrometry and a surrogate ADCC assay, respectively. In parallel, we have also harnessed a SPR biosensor directly to a bioreactor, which permitted the at-line determination of the concentration of antibodies by hybridoma cells during a bioreactor culture. The clone's growth potential were preserved across the systems (Fig. 1 ). Clone #3 always reached the highest viable cell density (VCD), followed by clone #1. Clone #2 and #4 showed similar growth characteristics. It is interesting to note that in the perfusion bioreactor different patterns in terms of VCD were observed although the cell biomass signals were similar for all 4 runs. This reflects the fact that the capacitance measures the biomass and not the absolute cell count [5] . To estimate the minimum cell specific perfusion rate (CSPR min ) in the semi-continuous experiment, the perfusion rate was divided by the maximum viable cell density (VCD max ). This value was compared to the CSPR obtained during the 4 th set-point (SP4) of the perfusion runs. As expected, the bleed fraction decreased when the capacitance set-point was increased and went down to 5% or less of the total perfusion rate (data not shown). Since the bleed removes the excess biomass, it is an indication of how close to a limitation the system is. Therefore, the CSPR calculated at SP4 was considered as the minimum CSPR. The CSPR min obtained in both systems were very close ( Table 1 ). The semi-continuous system can therefore be used to identify the CSPR min before running a continuous bioreactor, it therefore facilitates the decision making early in the development (to define the target cell density for a defined perfusion rate). The specific productivity (Q p ) of the 4 clones was quantified at the maximum VCD (semi-continuous) or at SP4 (perfusion). Absolute values are not representative since the cell environment is so different in both systems. Nevertheless, a relative ranking proved to be indicative of the respective performances ( Table 1 ). The maximum cell growth in fed-batch, semi-continuous and perfusion were also compared, their ranking was always preserved. Both indications can be used to assess a performance ranking for different clones. Various supplements were evaluated in fed-batch cultures and resulted in 15-45% Ab galactosylation without compromising cell growth and Ab titers. Design of experiment analysis determined an optimal composition, deemed "Optimized Supplement," which was evaluated against a panel of galactose-modulating supplements from other suppliers. The Optimized Supplement resulted in a similar viable cell density (VCD) and cell viability compared to the fed-batch culture Control which had no supplements (Fig. 1a) . Supplements from Supplier 1 resulted in similar to half the VCD of the Control while supplements from Supplier 2 resulted in very low VCD and percent viability. All of the supplements except those from Supplier 2 resulted in Ab titers similar to the Control (Fig. 1b) . Due to the poor growth and subsequently low titer from Supplier 2's supplement, Supplier 2 was not further evaluated. The glycan profiles were analyzed and are presented in (Fig. 1c ). All the evaluated supplements were able to raise galactosylation; however, only the Optimized Supplement and the 2X Supplier 1 Supplement resulted in over 40% galactosylation. The function of the Abs was further evaluated in a CDC assay (Fig. 1d) . Abs from the Optimized Supplement were more effective than the Control Abs and had a significantly lower half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 , 1.19 μg/mL) than the Control (1.71 μg/mL). Abs from the 2X Supplier 1 Supplement had a similar EC 50 to the Control which may be due to the higher Man5% of the Abs. Performance qualification of each component were performed prior to implementing the HTS platform. Comparable cell growth profile and productivity were achived between shake flasks and 24 DWPs (Fig. 1a ), indicating compatable cell culture environment for the cells. Cell counts using NyONE gave identical cell growth ranking as the traditional count from Vi-Cell XR (Fig. 1b) . Freedom EVO's liquid handler was optimized to produce comparable activity results to manual operation while expediting the sample preparation with improved consistency (Fig. 1c) . Finally, implementing the liquid handler function of AMBR15 to support media and feed formulation significantly reduced the labor for each experiment. Summary of the capability comparison between the HTS platform and the traditional method are listed in Table 1 . A case study of a complex feed screening with definitive screening design was completed using the semi-automatic HTS platform. This experiment, containing more than 60 feed formulations in duplicates, was handled by one operator and delivered a 40% improvement in productivity within a 4 week period (Data not shown). In addition, implementing the HTS platform for this study also resulted into~80% reduction in labor while improving the traceability of formulation preparation. Two "de novo" prototype media were developed using DOE and MVA in HTS with TPPs and an ambr®15 [1] and one was chosen for further development after comparing to a basal medium enriched with feed in bioreactors. Eleven components were identified as significant effectors of critical parameters for perfusion processes across evaluated cell lines. DOE central composite experiments were run and component concentrations were optimized in the selected prototype. In parallel, amino acid specific consumption rates were calculated from bioreactor spent media samples and used to adjust the concentration of amino acids to target a reduced CSPR. Increasing specific amino acids concentrations resulted in a significant reduction of the minimum CSPR across all tested cell lines -for example the CSPR of CHO-S was reduced from 60 to 39pL/cell/day (Table 1 ). However, even at the lower CSPR, spent media analysis revealed excess concentration of some amino acids, so specific accumulating amino acids were reduced and components were streamlined for the final medium: EXCELL® Advanced HD Perfusion Medium. Using this medium, a CHO-S and a CHOZN® GS cell line producing a fusion protein were cultured at a CSPR of less than 40pL/cell/day with a VCD of 50*10 6 vc/mL. Metabolic profile, productivity, and product quality were constant over the 30 day steady state. The CHOZN® GS cell line was also tested at 80*10 6 vc/mL with a CSPR of 33pL/cell/day (Fig. 1 ). At first, the experimental space was estimated by simulating the responses for broad concentration ranges and calculating the multiple response desirability function (Fig. 1a) . This results in a small area (turquoise) suggested as experimental space. Experiments were planned within these boundaries and responses were either simulated ( Fig. 1b, 4 cultivations for fitting the model) or compared with the purely experimental responses (Fig. 1c, 16 cultivations). Optimal concentrations for glutamine and glucose with respect to the constraints are in the lower right corner and similar for both methods (red frame, Fig. 1 ). After three days of hyperosmotic culture, nine genes (ugp, slc35a3, slc35d2, gcs1, manea, mgat2, mgat5b, b4galt3, and b4galt4) were differentially expressed over 1.5-fold of the control, and all these genes were down-regulated. N-linked glycan analysis by anion exchange and hydrophilic interaction HPLC showed that the proportion of highly sialylated (di-, tri-, tetra-) and tetra-antennary N-linked glycans was significantly decreased upon hyperosmotic culture. Addition of betaine, an osmoprotectant, to the hyperosmotic culture significantly increased the proportion of highly sialylated and tetra-antennary N-linked glycans (P ≤ 0.05), while it increased the expression of the N-glycan branching/antennary genes (mgat2 and mgat4b). Thus, decreased expression of the genes with roles in the N-glycan biosynthesis pathway correlated with reduced sialic acid content of Fc-fusion protein caused by hyperosmolar conditions. Conclusions Taken together, the results obtained in this study provide a better understanding of the detrimental effects of hyperosmolality on N-glycosylation, especially sialylation, in rCHO cells. The identified genes, particularly mgat2 and mgat4b, are potential targets for engineering in CHO cells to overcome the impact of hyperosmolality on glycoprotein sialylation. Upstream processing and harvest treatment: Culture reached 0.5 g/ L (8x10 6 cells/mL; 90% viability), harvest treatment was found to be very effective in terms of impurities clearance. Capture: Capture strategies were evaluated from the point of view of simplification of downstream operations, with HCP impurities content monitored as a key performance indicator. -Protein A affinity chromatography: Advanced harvest clarification enabled major improvements in affinity capture, in terms of eluate purity and reduction of host cell impurities (<35 ppm in all conditions tested). (Fig. 1 ). -Cation exchange chromatography: CEx allows higher capacities (>100 g/L) than protein A, whilst being more affordable (from 2-to 6-fold cheaper). Low residual HCP (<500 ppm) was observed with all CEx resins tested. Without harvest treatment and clarification preceding the capture studies (either affinity or CEx), results showed a lower binding capacity of the resin, a higher content of HCP in the eluate (up to 2000 ppm), a higher content of HMW species in the elution fraction (up to 3-fold higher) and a significant turbidity of the neutralized eluate. -Continuous multicolumn chromatography: Further options to increase cost efficiency include using a continuous multicolumn setup (Table 1) . Two models were assessed based on two different static binding capacities (SBC), demonstrating that 4 to 6 columns of 100ml were able to process a 200L production in less than 24h. Our CHO DG44 cell lines grow to peak cell concentration of 4.5x10 6 cells/mL in Erlenmeyer flasks and 4.0x10 6 cells/mL in bioreactors. Similar productivity of approximately 50 mg/L was observed for cells cultivated in both cultivation vessels in a nonoptimized batch culture using chemically defined media. Analysing how cultivation conditions affect the fraction of polymers may offer clues about the assembly of polymers and the challenges of IgM production. We quantified polymeric distribution of IgM directly in the supernatant using a densitometric method [2] . Cultivated under standard conditions (37°C, pH 7) IgM012 is produced as 90% pentamers, whereas IgM012_GL only consists of approximately 80% pentamers. The purified IgM012_GL was analysed with SEC-HPLC and contained 81 % pentamer and 19 % dimer, which is comparable to the results achieved with densitometry. The purification of the IgM antibodies was quite challenging as the manufacturer recommend acidic elution, which led to aggregation and inefficient elution of our model IgMs. Therefore, we screened for different elution buffers that prevent denaturation and aggregation. By combining high salt concentrations with moderate pH reduction we optimized elution conditions to 88-99% IgM recovery, which corresponded to a five to six fold improvement compared to the manufacturers' conditions. SDS-PAGE analysis and SEC-HPLC showed that our elution strategy resulted in a very pure product after a single chromatographic step. The purification strategy was verified with the IgM103, IgM104 and IgM617. A daily medium exchange by centrifugation was implemented and cultivation parameters for shake flasks were identified. Based on performance parameter (cell specific VP titer) and the CQAs of the vaccine (cell specific IU titer and VP/IU ratio), equivalence between the production-scale and scale down systems was confirmed. The scale down model data fall into the 95% prediction intervals calculated on manufacturing data whereas scale down model data from batch mode experiments (using non optimized cultivation conditions) do not. In the first approach, four signal peptides SP (7), SP(8), SP(9) and SP(10) were screened for their potential to improve the product secretion of CHO DG44 cells expressing a model antibody (product A). The results revealed a 2.4-fold increase in average final fed-batch antibody titer of SP(9) when compared to the standard SP approach (standard SP = 0.44 g/L; SP(9) = 1.50 g/L). In the second approach, the enhancing capacity of SP(9) on secretion of four other IgG products (named product B to E, Table 1 ) was further evaluated. An improved performance was observed for all products when comparing SP(9) and the standard SP in a fed batch process (Fig.  1) . With an increase in average final fed-batch titers ranging from 28 to 354 % and up to 290 % in cell-specific productivities. Taken together, with a positive influence on the final concentrations of all tested products, the results obtained with SP(9) contribute to -Signal peptide SP(9) was identified as a promising candidate with an average 2.4-fold titer increase during screening of four signal peptides. -SP(9) was able to improve production titers up to 354 % compared to standard SP. -SP(9) was able to improve cell-specific productivities up to 290 % compared to standard SP. -Future usage of SP (9) contributes to the further optimization of Sartorius Stedim Cellca's standard cell line development process. Media and feed compositions were unaffected by filtration through the virus barrier filter. No significant differences in concentrations were observed with ICP-OES (trace metals) or HPLC (amino acids and water soluble vitamins). NMR showed no change in the organic composition of the media including poloxamer. The aromatic region with vitamin and amino acid signals is shown (Fig. 1a) . Cell cultures showed no differences in cell growth or titer, in either shake flasks or bioreactors (Fig. 1b) . Cell viability was unaffected, metabolite levels were within limits, and titer was consistent. The protein quality of the secreted antibodies showed no differences in the glycosylation pattern (Fig. 1c) , amount of aggregates or charge variants. A decrease in cell density was observed in response to an increase of glucose feeding concentration, regardless of temperature or specific growth rate (in this case μ=D) evaluated. The maximum cell densities were reached at 20mM, achieving 1.65 and 1.50 x10 6 cells/ml at 37/33°C and 0.018(h -1 ); and 1.10 and 1.33 x 10 6 cells/ml at 37/33°C and 0.010(h -1 ) respectively (Fig. 1a) . The increase in glucose concentration from 20 to 40mM resulted in an q P increase of 3 and 3.3 fold at 33°C/0.018(h -1 ) and 37°C/0.018(h -1 ) respectively. A lower increase of 2.4 and 1.8 fold was reached at 33°C/0.010(h -1 ) and 37°C/0.010(h -1 ) respectively (Fig. 1b) . The highest q P s were reached at 37°C and 0.010(h -1 ). However, a positive effect of MH was not observed, in contrast to that observed in batch culture [1, 2, 3] . This behaviour suggests that low μ is a main factor on increased r-protein production in batch cultures exposed at MH condition. The specific consumption rate of glucose was significantly increased by the glucose increase from 20 to 40mM and reduced by MH (Fig.  1c) . At 0.010 (h -1 ) the specific production rate of lactate (q Lac ) was increased by glucose increase, independent of the culture temperature used. While at 33°C/0.018(h -1 ) the q Lac decreased with increasing glucose concentration and at 37°C/0.018(h -1 ) a maximum consumption was observed at 30 mM glucose (Fig. 1d) . The lactate-glucose yield ( Fig. 1e ) not showed relevant changes at 0.010(h -1 ), while at 0.018(h -1 ) this yield showed a more efficient utilization of glucose, as glucose concentration was increased. However, this last behaviour was not reflected in an increase of r-protein production. This study proposed an innovative methodology based on dielectric spectroscopy to monitor in real time the cellular physiological state, by online estimating the specific growth rate (μ) of cells. Model of online estimation of μ was developed from cultures in batch mode, and was validated by comparing online estimated μ with the experimental ones calculated at the end of the culture. With this model, the moment when μ started to decrease significantly, which indicated that cells were no longer in the exponential growth phase, was identified as the critical moment. To demonstrate the interest of online estimation of μ, the developed model was applied to a feedharvest culture, where the medium renewals were performed at the critical moments indicated by the model. This culture was then compared with the traditional feed-harvest culture where medium renewals were performed by following offline measurements of glucose and glutamine. We found that the online strategy allowed to maintain the value of μ by renewing the medium at the right time, while the values of μ varied a lot when using offline strategy. Moreover, by using the online estimation of μ, the glycosylation of IgG was kept at a high level (about 95%) throughout the whole culture. However, for the culture using offline strategy, the glycosylation level decreased progressively and was only about 75% at the end of the culture (Fig. 1) . Prior to enzymatic modification glycan analysis of all 4 antibodies showed variable galactosylation and sialylation typical of human Abs. This included a distribution of FG0, FG1, FG2, FS1 and FS2 with galactosylation indices ranging from 0.22 for IL8 to 0.64 for EG2. There was minimal sialylation in IL8 but up to 11% in EG2. Glycan modifications were made as each antibody was held on a Protein A column in accordance with procedures shown in Table  1 . Agalactosylated glycans were enriched by treatment with the single addition of galactosidase and neuraminidase. This resulted in 83-95% of agalactosylated structures in the Mabs and 65% in the polyclonal antibody. Galactosylated antibodies (>95% yield) were produced by a single stage reaction involving sialidase and by galactosyltransferase with UDP-Gal. Breakdown of the glycans to a trimannosyl core was accomplished by treatment of the agalactosylated structures with hexosaminidase. This produced a yield of 76-80% of the FM3 structure with a small remainder of FA1. Sialylated antibodies (>95%) were produced by a 2 stage reaction involving sialidase, galactosyltransferase and finally treatment with 2,6 sialyltransferase in the presence of CMP-NANA. The latter reaction produced equimolar quantities of monosialylated and disialylated Cetuximab and polyclonal antibodies. The results suggest that for human antibodies (150 kDa) there may be a limitation for sialylation given the steric constraints between the two CH2 domains of the dimeric structure. The ability to sialylate the smaller camelid antibody (80 kDa) was greater resulting in a high (>90%) level of disialylated glycans. This suggests that the steric constraints for glycosylation may be lower. These sialylated antibodies have significant potential clinical importance for their ant-inflammatory activities. The growth of microvesicle-supplemented cultures had shorter lag-phase and achieved 1.2 fold higher maximum cell density (1.46x10 6 viable cells/mL) compared to untreated standard culture (1.21 x10 6 viable cells/mL) and maintained higher for the remaining period of batch culture (Fig. 1b) . However, microvesicle-free fraction did not had significant impact on growth. The viability of microvesicle-supplemented cultures, similar to microvesicle-free media supplemented, was also higher compared to standard culture suggesting potential use of microvesicles for regulating CHO growth in production cultures. This could be possibily because microvesicles have already been reported to be enriched with cell growth/death-regulating proteins and hence facilitating cell growth [2, 3] . We have also observed abundance of cell cycle regulators including cyclin D1 in microvesicle-fraction compared to microvesicle-free spent-media in our laboratory (data not shown); however, further investigation are required to prove the hypothesis. The overall productivity of human IgG secreting CHO cells was also observed to increase bỹ 4 fold following supplementation of microvesicles to the culture without significantly affecting per-cell productivity. Since microvesicle-supplementation facilitates cell growth, increased number of viable producer cells in the culture could be expected to be the basis of observed increase in the overall productivity of the culture [2, 3] . The further work is ongoing to in-depth explore the potential of microvesicles for improving recombinant protein production from CHO cells. The timing of transition from EFC+ to GTC+ made it possible to target specific glycosylation profiles. Modulating G0F from 75% down to 32%, while increasing G1F and increasing G2F (Fig. 1) . Transitioning to GTC+ early in culture resulted in a greater shift from G0F to G1F and G2F. Transitioning midway or late in culture resulted in a greater proportion of G0F compared to G1F and G2F. Growth performance during precultures and batch curves in plain shaking flasks did not show any differences among tested surfactants or lots thereof, and cell densities reached 10-12·10 6 cells/ mL ( Fig. 1a and b) . Experiments with HEK 293-F cells at elevated power input in baffled shaking flasks revealed distinct differences between Pluronic® F-68, F-127 and Kolliphor® P188, with F-127 showing the best performance. Peak viable cell densities reached with lots A and B of Pluronic® F-68 and F-127 were comparable to those in plain shaking flasks, while those for Kolliphor® P188 and lots C and D of Pluronic® F-68 were significantly lower. Peak viale cell densities were of 2 -12·10 6 cells/mL (Fig. 1c) . Similar transient transfection efficiency and mean fluorescence of transfected cells independent of applied surfactant and lot thereof indicated no major impact of respective poloxamer (Fig. 1d) . Interestingly, experiments using fluorescein-labelled Pluronic® showed a time-dependent uptake into HEK cells. Visual tracking revealed an endocytic uptake of poloxamers by the cells (>10fold increase in signal after 96 h) and its co-localisation with cell membrane and lysosomes. SEC (Fig. 1e) analyses showed differences between the tested poloxamers. Especially tested lots of Pluronic® F-68 revealed notable deviations in the low molecular weight fraction (peak 2, Fig. 1e ), compared to the other poloxamers. Among these antioxidants, baicalein showed the best mAb production performance. Addition of baicalein significantly reduced the expression level of BiP and CHOP along with reduced ROS level, suggesting oxidative stress accumulated in the cells can be relieved using baicalein. As a result, addition of baicalein in batch cultures resulted in 1.7 -1.8-fold increase in the maximum mAb concentration (MMC), while maintaining the galactosylation of mAb ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). Likewise, addition of baicalein in fed-batch culture resulted in 1.6-fold increase in the MMC while maintaining the galactosylation of mAb. One key element of adaptive model-assisted control is the underlying process model. In order to provide an adaptive character, model parameters should be easily identifiable from routine cultivation data, which is available during seed train and fed-batch without additional sophisticated measurements. Therefore, the usage of unstructured, unsegregated models is recommended. a) Example of an unstructured, unsegregated cell culture model (for adaptive model-assisted control) One example, describing cell growth, cell death, uptake of substrates and production of metabolites via a first order system of ordinary differential equations and Monod-type kinetics, is shown in Table 1 . This mathematical model includes 13 cell specific model parameters [2] . ii) b) Open-loop control sequence for seed train simulation and optimization [3] : Using model, a priori identified model parameters and starting concentration values, the temporal concentration courses can be predicted for the first scale. Subsequently, points in time for passaging and starting values for the next scale can be computed by adding a passaging strategy, seed train conditions and medium concentrations. Prediction for the following scales can be obtained iteratively. Integrating feedback from the process in terms of cultivation data enables increasing prediction accuracy and responding to possible changes in cell behaviour. Cells mixed in the cellulose sulfate solution under physiological conditions can be safely trapped within a liquid core during capsule formation. Encapsulated cells can reached cell densities ≤ 40 x 10 6 cells mL capsule -1 , whereas cells confined in alginate/PLL beads and non-encapsulated ones reached 11.3 x 10 6 cells mL bead -1 and 2.4 x 10 6 cells mL, respectively. One major advantage of these polyelectrolyte microcapsules (<1 mm) is the low MWCO (<10 kDa) (Fig. 1a-b) . This restricted permeability allows for a conditioning of the capsule core by autocrine factors, which in turn permits the use of basal cell culture medium instead of expensive T cell specialized media, hence does not necessitate high amounts of rhIL-2 and reduces the cultivation costs. Moreover, co-encapsulation of rhIL-2 had a beneficial effect on the growth kinetics in most cases (Fig. 1c) . Some evidence is presented that the SCS used to form the polyelectrolyte microcapsules, specifically adsorbs IL-2 (Table 1 ) -A cytokine which provides an essential signal for T-cell proliferation and differentiation [3] . Therefore, we postulate that the SCS used for encapsulation has biomimetic properties, creating an artificial extracellular matrix mimicking heparin sulfate which in turn positively affect T cell proliferation via trans-presentation of IL-2 (Fig. 1d) [4] . The reasons why the biotech and biopharma industry lags behind other sectors such as the automotive regarding the transformation to digital manufacturing are (i) the complexity and dissipative nature of biological systems, (ii) distributed heterogeneous data and (iii) limited at-line or on-line data sources. However, the costs of genomic sequencing, omics data generation, and computing resources are decreasing rapidly, and at the same time process analytical technologies, computational power and predictive modeling as well as data management infrastructures are greatly improving (Table 1) . By removing roadblocks that used to limit approaches, these changes have paved the way to transforming the bioeconomy into an industry that is based on digital knowledge. Such new and optimized manufacturing technologies as continuous biomanufacturing and 3D bioprinting can actually demand the interfacing of many sources of information, deep data Prior to ELISA, the various proteins were incubated at 37°C in SCS prepared as for encapsulation. As control, the SCS was replaced by PBS. Shown are mean values ± SD, n = 3 analysis including software sensors for metabolic fluxes, and model-based predictions of digital biomanufacturing. The application of predictive models for bioprocess optimization greatly improves established platforms and finally leads to a massively increased mechanistic process understanding. Results obtained for a 2-changepoint case are shown on Fig. 1 . Points on the right-hand graph represent new batches. The red triangle represents a failed batch. It appears that the control strategy fails to identify the failed batch. Two reasons can be considered: -The limits of the prediction region have been established based on 9 points, such a small sample size is likely to be insufficient for the definition of such a control chart. -The tested batches were produced out of set point. A control chart should be used on a stable process, ran in the same conditions, in order to be really relevant. This work was based on available historical data, which is never an ideal situation. Cultivation of Vero cells in medium with serum and in serum-free medium, was carried out in bench-scale compact fixed-bed bioreactors, to determine which culture conditions result in the highest growth rate, the highest cell biomass by carriers and virus production. Cells were inoculated at 0.05x10 6 cells/cm 2 and infected during the mid-exponential phase, following a complete media exchange. Viral infection took place in serum-free media. In-line clarification and purification is targeted to be performed in only a few steps (maximum one of two) without intermediary diafiltration. In such configuration, we measured that Vero cells can reach a cell density of 300-350x10 3 cells/cm 2 with PDL/day of 1.0-1.2 in serum-containing media. This new facility is expected to manufacture any type of viral vaccine at a very low cost and could be deployed at the site of the manufacturer in emerging countries, killing the two birds of cost of manufacturing and distribution with one stone. The presentation will feature the description of the engineering development, but also the preliminary results of cell growth, infections, and product quality, as well as a description of the COGS calculation. Efficiency of spread of recombinant viruses (Fig. 1a) could be mapped to a point mutation in one of the genes, A34R. However, although MVA-CR19 carries mutations in three structural proteins we detected no obvious differences to wildtype by electron microscopy (Fig. 1b) . The replacement of the left viral telomere by the right counterpart was the most surprising result of our new study (Fig. 1c) . This extensive rearrangement affects 15 % of the viral genome and has also increased the area of complementarity between the two telomeres. The recombination site was precisely located and shown via analysis of earlier and subsequent passages to be a stable property of MVA-CR19. Various viruses, including those with larger dual (DsRed1 and GFP) expression cassettes, were serially passaged at least 20-fold. Although the genotype of MVA-CR19 is advantageous for replication, all genomic and genetic markers of wildtype and MVA-CR19 were stably maintained in all passages of the recombinant viruses, independent of wildtype or MVA-CR19 backbone. Media screen result exhibits the highest transfection efficiency of around 50% transfected cells by Opti-MEM medium coming along with low cell growth and viability. To improve the transfection efficiency, basic parameters including cell density, pDNA, and PEI concentrations were varied and higher transfection efficiency was reached by reducing media or accordingly increasing cell density, PEI and pDNA concentration for transfection. Further optimization results show that the transfection of CHO-K1 cells in Opti-MEM (transfection medium) for 5 hours followed by addition of CHO-MACS CD (production medium) for further enhancing the transfection, cell count, and cell viability. The transfection efficiency (TE) increased up to 85 ± 2.6% coincide with increases in viable cell concentration (VCC) in comparsion to transfection and cultivation in Opti-MEM media alone Fig. 1a . Both conventional and insitu methods are successfully transfected CHO-K1 to the same similar high TE as shown in fluorescence microscope images of Fig. 1b . Insitu transfection shows super-priority for suspension cell transfection concerning the reduction of handling steps (one step) compared to the conventional way (two steps). The insitu transfection avoiding the optimization step required for the incubation period to prepare transfection polyplex but require a higher amount of pDNA and PEI than conventional way as shown in Table 1 . We have shown that the cumate-inducible promoter (CR5) was the strongest promoter we had tested so far in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. With this promoter, we were able to generate stable CHO pools capable of producing high levels of a Fc fusion protein (900 mg/L), outperforming by 3 to 4 fold those generated with CMV5 and hybrid EF1α-HTLV constitutive promoters. Besides the strength of the CR5 promoter, we demonstrated that the ability to control both the time and the level of expression during pool generation and maintenance gave a real advantage to the inducible expression system. Indeed, we observed that keeping the expression OFF during selection enabled the generation of pools with superior productivity compared with the pools whose expression was maintained ON. Moreover, preliminary results suggest that keeping recombinant protein expression down increases the frequency of high producer clones [2] . 8 cell lines expressing different recombinant products were investigated to calculate probability of having ≥ 2 cells/well after FACS sorting P(d), the apparent probability P(i) of having ghostcells (cells that are out-of-focus and, thus, are not visible during initial microscopic imaging), and the apparent probability P(k) of having ghostcells that outgrow the 384-well stage (Fig. 1 ). Using these results, the probability of obtaining a monoclonal cell by using Sartorius Stedim Cellca's single cell cloning approach was determined (Table 1) by Conservative examination: P(monoclonal, conservative) = 1 -(P(d) x P(i)) Realistic examination: P(monoclonal, realistic) = 1 -(P(d) x P(k)) Cell pools with low viability can theoretically impact the probability of monoclonality by e.g. diminishing microscopic imaging quality (cell debris). Therefore, pool cell line 1 with very low viability (≥36 %) was used to demonstrate, that the probability of monoclonality is still 99.9 % in case of low viability on day of sorting: P(monoclonal, conservative) = P(d) x P(i) = 99.9 % P(monoclonal, realistic) = P(d) x P(k) = 99.9 % Furthermore, cell pools with high aggregation levels can theoretically impact the probability of monoclonality by sticking together during FACS sorting and therefore increase the probability P(d) of having ≥ 2 cells/droplet. Therefore, pool cell line 8 with high aggregation levels (≥11.1 %) was used to demonstrate, that the probability of monoclonality is still ≥ 99.9 % in case of highly aggregated cell pools on day of sorting: P(monoclonal, conservative) = P(d) x P(i) = > 99.9 % P(monoclonal, realistic) = P(d) x P(k) = > 99.9 % Conclusions In summary, there is no obvious correlation between protein product type and the determined probabilities for monoclonality. Furthermore, pools with a viability as low as 36 % and pools with an aggregation level as high as 11.1 % can be used for SCC resulting in acceptable probabilities of monoclonality. Background ICH guidance [1] requires that any cell line used to produce biopharmaceuticals originates from a single progenitor cell. Recently, there has been increased scrutiny of the method(s) used to achieve this requirement. Here, we review the suitability of the legacy capillary aided cell cloning (CACC) method in light of this changing landscape of expectations. The CACC method is based on the 'spotting' technique [2] and relies on independent visual conformation by two scientists of the presence of a single cell in a 1 μL droplet. This method achieves a high probability of monoclonality in one cloning round. Although the method has since been replaced by FACS single cell deposition for routine use, it remains a viable cloning method. Initial screening experiments identified a lead vector, #39, and a vector, #37, which produced very low titers and relatively few minipools expressing detectable levels of IgG1. Analysis of GFP and RFP expression from the modified vectors indicated relatively high expression from the RFP/HC expression cassette of vector #37. A stronger promoter resulting in overabundance of HC, known to be toxic to cells, provides a possible explanation for the poor results with this vector. Interestingly, swapping the positions of the LC and HC in #37 resulted in a vector, #77, that outperformed the initially identified lead vector (Fig. 1 ). This same change was made to vector #39 without any resulting improvement in titers (vector #78, Fig. 1 ). Interestingly, vector #39 had a smaller difference in relative promoter strengths, based on mean channel fluorescence ratio of GFP to RFP, suggesting that overabundance of HC was not an impediment to IgG1 expression from #39. Poor titers were also seen with a modified version of vector #39 (vector #79, Fig. 1 ) in which the glutamine synthethase selection cassette was in the reverse orientation. This second screen identified vector #77 as the lead vector design (Fig. 1) . A full comparative study of vector #77 and the control vector was performed, cumulating in the generation and comparison of single-cell clones from each. These studies have demonstrated the equivalence of these vectors in terms of IgG1 titer. Transfection with the suicide gene proved to be 100% lethal within 2 days, with no outgrowth over two weeks. Protection by expression of the siRNA was shown to be efficient. Currently a comparison of stable cell line development programs based on siRNA selection and neomycin selection is ongoing. Conclusions The novel selection system should speed up cell line development, as the system kills rapidly and directly selects for cells transcribing the product gene on a high level. We expect to see more high producers earlier in the process, which will allow for an easier and faster selection in the following steps. siRNA based selection offers great opportunities. By directly selecting based on GoI transcription and not a proxy marker, we expect more relevant cells on a pool level. In addition, the elimination of an antibiotics resistance allows more cellular resources for GoI production. The system offers multiple ways of application, either by enriching wanted, or depleting unwanted cells. Background Single-cell cloning is an essential step used in the upstream development of transformed cell lines for therapeutic protein production. While single-cell clones are typically used to ensure product consistency, such low cell density cultures present a survival challenge; cells grow more slowly or may even not survive at low densities in protein-free media, costing the industry time and money and limiting the pool of candidate colonies for choice of production clones [1, 2] . To address this problem, we aimed to develop a highly efficient serum-free medium suitable for optimising single-cell cloning efficiency by studying a range of conditioned media (CM) samples isolated from different Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. Materials and methods CHO-S, DG44 and CHO-K1 were adapted to CHO-S SFM-II (Gibco) medium for a minimum of three passages. Conditioned media was then collected when the cultures reached a cell density of 1x10 6 cells/ml (typically day 2-day 3 depending on the growth profiles of each cell line and whether they grew in suspension or attached conditions). Samples were then centrifuged twice to remove cell pellet/debris and stored at -20°C. The ability of conditioned media to support CHO colony formation was then assayed using 96-well plates, seeding the cells at low cell density (1-10cells/well) by diluting down CHO cultures in media/conditioned media. After incubation at 37°C for 10 days, cloning efficiency was assayed using a standard XTT assay. Initial screening of the nine CM samples was performed using CHO-K1 cells due to their widespread use in industrial antibody production. Successful media candidates were subsequently screened using additional CHO cell lines. Table 1) . The K1-SFMII-CM product improved cell cloning efficiency for DG44 cells (avg. increase>1.5-fold) and CHO-S cells (avg. increase>3-fold) ( Fig. 1) and also the adherent CHO-K1 cell line growing in ATCC +5%FBS. We adapted our cell line development process by increasing the initial selection during the first selection phase, thereby allowing the omission of the 30 nM MTX amplification step. We observed that the capacity of amplifiability varied for different products. Cell lines with a protein titer ranging from >1 g/L to 1.5 g/L (DTE) in shake flask fed-batch showed to be more susceptible to increased initial MTX levels and were thus not amplifiable with 30 nM MTX. In contrast, cell lines with high protein titer >1.5 g/L were observed to adapt to 30 nM MTX easily and were amplifiable. Finale shake flask fed-batch data with CLD 2.0 clones of highexpressing products showed comparable titers to clones from the standard approach. CLD 2.0 clone titers for DTE proteins revealed in average a 2.0-fold increase compared to clones generated in the standard approach. Titers of top producing clones were in a range of 1.8 g/L to to 2.7 g/L (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, stability data of CLD2.0 cell clones from different DTE products showed a stable specific productivity in a range of +/-15 % over eight weeks cultivation. Fed-batch titer from t=2 weeks and t=8 weeks were in a normal range of +/-20% of the standard 30 nM projects. Our data showed 4 integration sites are in the high producing cell line. Among the 4 integration site, IS1 integration site was tested by CRISPR/ Cas9 for target integration of antibody gene for expression. The IS1target integrated cell pool present higher expression titer than cell pool generated by target integration into other integration sites (Fig. 1a) . The single cell clones derived from IS1-target integrated cell pool had low copy number of GOI (Fig. 1b) . After normalization with copy numbers, the single cell clones derived from IS1-target integrated cell pool showed high titer per copy (123~583 mg/L/copy) (Fig. 1c) . In this study, quantitative lipidomics was coupled with transcriptomics to further understand the physiological pathways of HEK, CHO-M and SP2/0 cells. Initial HP-TLC analysis indicated that major lipids in these industrial cell lines were PE and PC. Other polar lipids such as PI, PS, PG, PA, and SM were lower compared to PC and PE in exponential and stationary phases of each cell line. Figure 1 represents 2D HP-TLC results of HEK with the relative quantitation of polar lipids. In order to investigate the lipid subgroups, shotgun MS analysis was conducted for both exponential and stationary growth phases of the three cell lines. MS analysis indicated that lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) and lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) amounts were 4 -10 fold and 2-4 fold higher in HEK cells compared to SP2/0 and CHO cell lines. Sphingomyelin (SM) was another lipid subgroup that was shown to have a major difference between SP2/0 and other mammalian cell lines. SM was 30-65 fold lower in SP2/0 cell line compared to CHO and HEK. To understand these metabolic differences, transcriptomics analysis using Illumina HighSeq and Gene Expression Omnibus was conducted on these mammalian cells. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database was used to map the transcriptomics data to the lipid synthetic pathways. Transcriptomics data mapping to KEGG pathways demonstrated that differences in LPE and LPC pathways correlate with the expression profiles of secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), lysophospholipid acyltransferase (LPEAT), lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT), and lysophospholipase (LYPLA) [1] . Characterisation revealed the cell lines exhibited a range of values for productivity, growth, and intracellular (IC) antibody mRNA and protein expression, ideal for further ImageStream characterisation. Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that final titre correlated with both IC heavy chain (HC) protein and mRNA amounts (Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) = 0.70 and PCC = 0.80, respectively). To assess productivity at the single cell level, assays multiplexing IC HC protein and mRNA with cell attributes were therefore developed. Initial assay development focusing on HC mRNA and protein amounts has revealed interesting results; four cell lines displayed two distinct populations, one producing the antibody and another nonexpressing population. The ratio of these populations varied amongst the cell lines. Images obtained from the ImageStream have shown the cellular localization and expression of HC and LC message and protein (Fig. 1) . For both message and protein, HC and LC colocalize in the cell. Whether there is any relationship between IC HC protein and cell attributes at the single cell level was then also investigated, as well as correlations with cell culture parameters at the population level. At the population level, correlations were found between titre and IC HC protein and mRNA (PCC = 0.84 and PCC = 0.79, respectively) confirming the data obtained by western blot and qRT-PCR analysis. In the stable pools of CHO-S and DXB11 cells, the productivities per integrated target gene copy were about 11-13 mg/L/copy and 68-75 mg/L/copy in a batch culture, respectively. After single cell cloning, the integrated copy numbers in most cell clones were less than three copies per cell. In CHO-S and DXB11 cell clones, the productivities per integrated target gene copy were 20-60 mg/L/copy and 60-150 mg/L/copy in a batch culture, respectively. The productivity per integrated target gene in cell clones developed by the transposon system was much higher than that in cell clones developed by random integration (Fig. 1a and b) . To evaluate the productivity stability of cell clones developed by the transposon system, ten cell clones at generation 0, 30, 60, and 100 were applied in the analysis. Of interest, about 80% of cell clones were stable at generation 60, but lost the productivity at generation 100 (Fig. 1c) , implying the most cell clones could maintain the stability within 2 months. In cultures where pH was not controlled, two different metabolic phases were observed for CHO and HEK293 cells. During the first phase both cell lines produced large amounts of lactate as a consequence of the high glucose consumption rates. Interestingly, when pH dropped below 6.8, due to acid lactic secretion and accumulation, a second metabolic phase was identified, in which concomitant consumption of glucose and lactate was observed even during the exponential growth phase. Conversely, hybridoma cells were unable to co-consume lactate and glucose simultaneously even under noncontrolled pH conditions. Therefore, the hybridoma physiological data used for the FBA corresponded to only phase 1 of pHcontrolled cultures. A summary of the main cell growth and metabolic parameters obtained from the different experiments performed is presented in Table 1 . FBA shows ( Fig. 1 for HEK293 cell culture) that lactate is produced in phase 1 because pyruvate has to be converted to lactate to fulfill the NADH regeneration in the cytoplasm and only a small amount of pyruvate can be transported into TCA through Acetyl-CoA. Cell metabolism in phase 1 is highly inefficient, as the majority of the carbon source is not used for the generation of energy nor biomass. In phase 2, in which mitochondrial LDH was considered, TCA fluxes could be maintained as in phase 1 at the maximal rate encountered; hence, the energy available for cells to grow was similar in both phases, obtaining similar growth rate. Comparison of PEIpro® to other commercially available PEIs was achieved by transfecting suspension HEK-293 and CHO cells with plasmid DNA encoding for the luciferase gene reporter. Luciferase production yields obtained in HEK-293 and CHO cells were at least respectively 5-fold and 10-fold higher when using a similar amount of PEIpro in comparison to the other PEIs (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, PEIpro® was the only PEI that led to similar luciferase production yields when decreasing the amount of plasmid DNA per Liter of cell culture. Conversely, at least 1 mg of plasmid DNA and 4-fold more of PEI "Max" and L-PEI 25 kDa were needed to obtain a similar Luciferase expression range in both HEK-293 and CHO cells. We further assessed the compatibility and versatility of PEIpro® by measuring protein production yields obtained in most commonly used animal-free synthetic media. As shown in Fig. 2 , PEIpro® leads to high protein production yieds in several commercially avaialble media formulations for HEK-293 anc CHO cell lines. Both Tzmb and the fusion protein Tzmb-IFNα2b have been successfully expressed in CHO-S and HEK293, which use for heterologous protein expression have previously been optimized in prior works [3] . The tricistronic strategy resulted in the most efficient, showing a 3.5fold increase in terms of productivity with respect to the bicistronic double-transfection for Tzmb in CHO-S cells and a 5-fold increase in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1a) . In the case of Tzmb-IFNα2b, the tricistronic strategy also allowed to achieve higher productivities than the bicistronic one (Fig. 1b) . Regarding the differences of specific productivity between both cell lines tested, HEK293 emerged as the best production host candidate, for the two tested strategies (tricistronic and bicistronic) and for the two produced proteins, showing a 1.5-fold increase in terms of productivity with respect to CHO-S cells for Tzmb using the tricistronic strategy. Tzmb and Tzmb-IFNα2b were analysed in terms of their antigen binding capacity, and both were find to efficiently bind to HER2+ Skbr-3 cells (Fig. 1c) . Thus, the antibody affinity to HER2 antigen has not been affected when fused to INF-α2b. Finally, antiproliferative activity of Tzmb and Tzmb-IFNα2b were assessed on the same Sk-br-3 cells. At a concentration of 500 nM of Tzmb, and after a 72-hour incubation, Sk-br-3 cells presented a 83% growth with respect to the untreated control. However, no antiproliferative effect was observed for Tzmb-IFNα2b (Fig. 1d) . Concerning productivity and growing behavior, HEK 293T was the favored cell line for our serum-free LV manufacturing process. In addition, an additive screen revealed that sodium butyrate alone had the most promising effect on both GFP-LVV and CD20-CAR-LVV production. After PEI/DNA titration, we finally could increase LVV productivity by lowering PEI/DNA amount at higher cell densities referred to our standard transfection protocol. Furthermore, the titration for the optimal plasmid ration revealed, that for large transfer constructs higher amounts of transfer plasmid are required than for smaller constructs to achieve a high productivity (Fig. 1) . It was shown that miRNA expression was significantly reduced in mixed populations. A knockdown up to 95% was achieved for miR-23a, miR-23b and miR-24. The knockdown in miR-27a and miR-27b expression was considerably less -between 70-90% (n=3, * P ≤ 0.05, ** P ≤ 0.01, *** P ≤ 0.001) (Fig. 1b) . Furthermore, it was shown that various sizes of indels were generated by targeting the seed region. Smaller indels (+1/ +2/-1/-2 bps) seemed to be more common but larger deletions were detected as well (Fig. 1c) . MiR-23a, miR-23b and miR-27b showed increased viability in late stages of the culture. Depletion of miR-27a reduced growth significantly whereas knockdown of miR-24 showed increased proliferation as well as boosting IgG titers (Table 1) . Affinity evaluation of concentrated culture supernatants with protein A sensor tips showed a decrease of binding affinity of BM09 and a loss of binding of BM10. The protein A measurement showed an increased binding strength of SU01, SU02 and SU03 compared to su3H6 and BM07. SU01 and SU03 result in a higher binding affinity compared to SU02. These results can be confirmed with purified variants by the streptavidin bio-assay (Fig. 1) . We constructed four CHO cell lines stably expressing EBNA1, termed IgG1-EB01 to EB04. In capillary electrophoresis analysis, we observed a clear peak corresponding to the EBNA1 expression in all four cell lines. We tested the transfection efficiency by pOTC-GFP plasmids. In the best transfection condition, PEI/DNA ratio of 1/1, IgG1-EB01 cell showed the highest GFP-positive cell number (1.07×10 7 cell/mL) and transfection efficiency (95%) among the four cell lines. Therefore, IgG1-EB01 cell lines were selected for further study. After the transfection, the number of GFP-positive cells continued to increase even after the passage (Fig. 1) , suggesting that the pOTC-GFP plasmid was stably retained and replicated by EBNA1/oriP system in IgG1-EB01 cell lines. In preliminary experiments, we introduced three genes, MDH2, GSS and GCLM, into IgG1-EB01 cell lines. Cotransfection of these three genes led to an increase in IgG1 production from 287±18 mg/L (control) to 334±21 mg/L at day 8 (P<0.05, t-test, n=3). This result suggests that these three genes work as production enhancer genes. Conventional methods based on stable cells take up to 6 months to determine whether the gene of interest is beneficial for recombinant IgG1 production. In contrast, identification of production enhancer genes is achievable within 10 days by our proposed method based on EBNA1/oriP system. The three protein subunit genes were expressed from vectors with different selection markers. In the Reference constructs (without 2GUN), the α, β, and γ chains were expressed from vectors with marker genes for zeocin, blasticidin, and GS, respectively. A similar 3 vector combination was also generated with 2GUN elements integrated in each vector. In addition, 2 vectors with 2 subunits (γ-α and α-γ), each with a separate 2GUN element, promoter and polyadenylation signal, were generated with a GS marker gene. CHO GS -/cells were transfected with the 4 appropriate vector combinations in equimolar ratios and selected in bulk in medium lacking glutamine and 1 or 2 antibiotics. The 2-vector transfected cell pools recovered first, due to the presence of only 1 antibiotic in the medium (Fig. 1a) . The pools transfected with three 2GUN vectors recovered to maximum viability just a few days after the 2-vector 2GUN pools. Recovery of the Reference pools took up to a week longer than the 2GUN pools. Production of each pool was assessed in a batch production run in shaker flasks. All 2-vector 2GUN pools which recovered first produced titers around 0.1 g/L, which is almost 10-fold higher as compared to the production by Reference pools (Fig. 1b) . The highest titers of 0.5 g/L were obtained in the 3-vector 2GUN pools. These data show that the 2G UNic™ genetic elements can be successfully used to obtain a significant increase in the titer of difficult-to-express proteins. Similar results have been obtained with other DTE proteins, including fc-fusion proteins and bi-specific antibodies (not shown). We showed that growth rates and viabilities of the rhBMP2producing cells were similar to those of the parent cell line, while entry into the death phase was delayed in case of the recombinant cells. The maximum rhBMP2 concentration detected in the culture supernatant was low for stable clones but can be greatly improved combining the HEK-293 cells transient expression system and batch reactor cultivation which reflects a better compatibility of the codon usage in the human cells (Table 1) . hBMP2 protein is sensitive to slightly acidic pH and to a lesser extend to proteases (Fig. 1a ) and binds to both producers cell lines (Fig. 1b) -All this could incidentally contribute to the low product titers. Cell-free protein synthesis has been proposed as alternative for "difficult-to-express" proteins. Since native hBMP2 is glycosylated, a cell-free system based on eukaryotic cell lysates is required for its production. CHO cell lysates were chosen, since they had previously been established as the most productive eukaryotic system in our hands [1] , while concomitantly enabling a direct comparison to the production of hBMP2 in stable clones established in CHO-K1. The ability to perform post-translational modifications is a major advantage of eukaryotic systems. The CHO lysates prepared by the protocol used here have previously been shown to contain significant amounts of endogenous microsomes derived from the endoplasmatic reticulum during lysis [2] . To enforce translocation of the target protein into the microsomal structures, a melittin signal peptide was fused to the hBMP2 cDNA. The glycosylation of the protein was assessed by enzymatic treatment (PNGase, EndoH) and confirmed using 14 C-mannose for the de novo protein synthesis. Upon cell-free protein synthesis, the hBMP2 yield was 100-fold higher than the best one in the HEK-293 cells. The difference becomes even more dramatic, when productivities are considered (Table 1) , i.e. the fact that maximum product titers are reached within 3 h in the cellfree system compared to 120 h in the cell-based ones. This demonstrates that the cell-free expression system is most suitable compared to mammalian cell expression method for the production of glycosylated human BMP2 (Table 1 ) [3] . Based on the hydrodynamic radii of the polyplexes, the investigated nano-stars could be divided into three subgroups (Table 1) . Middle, but also high arm density nano-stars formed smaller polyplexes with hydrodynamic radii ≤ 300 nm, a size that is considered suitable for endocytosis and transfection. Transfection efficiencies and cytotoxicities varied systematically with the nano-stars architecture, with viability showing a more pronounced dependency on the characteristics of the transfection agent than the transfection efficiency itself. The arm density was particularly important, with values of approximately 0.06 arms/ nm 2 yielding the best results (Fig. 1a) . The end-capping the polycation arms with PDEGMA significantly improved the serum compatibility (Fig. 1b) . The gene delivery potential of a given nano-star and its ability to render the cells magnetic did not correlate. Although, compared to the non-separated cells, EGFP-expressing cells were consistently more frequent in the magnetic cell fraction, while the non-magnetic fraction was slightly depleted. When the EGFP-expressing cells were further divided into low, middle and high producers, a statistically significant shift towards the high producers was observed in the magnetic cell fraction (Fig. 1c) . A nonparametric Spearman correlation analysis was used to statistically evaluate possible links between the molecular characteristics of the nano-stars, the physicochemical properties of the corresponding polyplexes, the transfection conditions, and the cellular reactions. The resulting correlogram is shown in Fig. 1d . The yield obtained with Matyash extraction method was higher than with Folch method for each lipid class tested. Besides, Matyash method presents also the advantage to be less toxic and suitable for high throughput analysis since the organic layer is above the aqueous layer. Lipids separation by HILIC is based on their polar head. Since lipid classes are defined by polar head, the lipids are eluted class by class, making their identification easier. The separation of lipids by reverse phase was correct but the method is longer and we observed a massive carryover of triglycerides on the column. Finally each lipid class was screened in MS/MS parent ion mode. Target daughter ion was set according to the lipid class structure and fragmentation pattern. This detection technique enabled the identification of 50 different lipids. To ensure the absolute quantification of the detected lipids and to guarantee comparable results between batches labeled internal standard were added prior to extraction. As shown in Fig. 1a , the virus concentration and incubation time exert the highest influence on the transduction efficiency. Obviously, a higher concentration of viral particles and longer incubation of cells with virus increases the probability for hits between cells and virus particles. Additionally, the surrounding fluid can have a negative impact on the transduction. This is due to the interaction of medium components with the baculovirus. Therefore, PBS containing Ca 2+ & Mg 2+ is recommended as surrounding fluid for transduction experiments. In Fig. 1B , the transduction conditions resulting in the highest percentage of GFP+ cells are displayed: 150 virus particles per cell (PPC) and an incubation time of 5 h with hMSC-TERT. Our strategy allowed us to obtain 20 mg of pure (>95%) and stable DLL1-ECD-FC as confirmed by SDS PAGE and thermofluor assay. DLL1-EGF3-FC yield was very low and buffer screenings are ongoing to optimize protein stability. Functional studies performed in human breast cancer MCF7 cells showed that both ligands are biologically active as they increased the expression of the Notch-dependent genes HES-1, HEY-L and HEY-1. Recombinant DLL1 and peptides were used to select for monoclonal antibodies by Phage Display. After three rounds of panning with DLL1 peptides we identified 13 scFv positive clones, 2 of which presented high affinity to DLL1-ECD-FC. Currently we are performing more phage display selections to increase the number of positive clones. scFv with higher affinities will be reformatted into IgGs and their ability to inhibit the Notch pathway will be evaluated. The anti-oncogenic effects of anti-DLL1 IgGs will be assessed in breast cancer cells in viability/apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and invasion assays. By optimizing the DNA amount for transfection of 293-F cells more than 90 % of the cells were reproducibly transfected. Batch cultivations in shaker flasks revealed that rAAV were produced in the first 24-96 h after transfection. Figure 1b shows viable cell densities and viabilities in relation to the genomic titer. Genomic titers were determined from raw cell extracts and up to 10 9 copies/ml were repetitively achievable. A decrease in viability marked the decline in genomic copies per ml showing that a prolongation of the process e.g. by addition of a feed would probably not increase yield. In a first scale-up, the rAAV production was transferred to a 2 l bioreactor (Fig. 1c) . Transfection efficiencies in bioreactors of up to 55% were comparable to that obtained in a simultaneous shaker flask experiment. Transfection efficiencies were lower compared to prior experiments due to controlled conditions in the bioreactor. Nonetheless the titer with up to 1×10 5 genomic copies per cell was elevated compared to that of shaker flasks. -Media: A media exchange at 5 hours post transfection with DMEM substituted for FreeStyle medium resulted in an 8x increase in specific productivity. 1 (abstract P-349) . a Schematic overview of rAAV production in HEK293 cells with triple-transfection system. b Viable cell densities (VCD), viabilities and genomic copies per ml (GC) of a rAAV production with 293-F batch cultivations in shaker flasks. Genomic copies per ml refer to the titer determined in 1 ml culture volume. Error bars represent biological and technical duplicate measurements of samples. c Viable cell densities and genomic copies per cell of a rAAV production with 293-F batch cultivation in a 2 l bioreactor. For reasons of comparability between shaker and bioreactor data genomic copies are given per cell. Error bars represent technical duplicate measurements of samples -Cell density at transfection: Cells were seeded at 6,000 cells/cm 2 and reached 200,000 cells/cm 2 at Day 5 which was determined to be the optimal cell density for transfection. -pDNA/cell ratio: Reducing pDNA by 50% had no significant effect on productivity. -Lysis: Use of Trion x-100 at 0.5% with 100 mM NaCl at pH 8 resulted in >100% virus recovery compared to sampled carriers. -Scaling: Specific productivity was maintained as the system was scaled from 0.8 m 2 to 4.0 m 2 . -Overall, an average yield of 4x10 13 VG/m 2 was achieved. Generic 2D monolayer and 3D suspension iPSC derived cardiomyocytes differentiation protocols were established. Beating cardiomyocytes were first seen on day 8 in monolayer as well as in spheroid culture. Cardiomyocytes show up to 64% cardiac troponin T positive cells and 44% myosin heavy chain positive cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 1g, h) . Myosin II heavy chain, α-actinin, myosin 9/10, myosin 11 and caldesmon expression was shown by immunohistochemistry ( Fig. 1a-d) . Due to the exclusion of a lactate enrichment of cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts are also expressed in the spheroids shown by vimentin staining. Those cardiac fibroblasts lead to a physiological heterologous cell population similar to the human heart. Beating spheroids were cultivated for 7 days under dynamic culture conditions in the Multi-Organ-Chip. The integrated on-chip micropump provides physiological-like pulsatile circulation at a microliter scale and leads to better nutrition and oxygen supply. In static conditions Sk-Hep-1 cells showed, for a period of 6 months, a stable FVII production with an average of 8,03 IU/mL of FVII, 83% of cell viability and 77% of cells expressing the GFP gene. After purification with VIISelect column it was possible observe a recover of 65% of the purified protein with 95% degree of purity (Fig. 1) . This recombinant purified FVII is being used in in vivo experiments to determine the pharmacokinetics parameters and to evaluate the posttranslation modifications profile. The combination of CI-huOB cells with the magnetic 3D bioprinting technology enabled the establishment of reproducible and consistent 3D spheroids. Single spheroids per well were formed independent of the amount of cells (1.000-50.000 cells) (Fig. 1a) . Formed spheroids were stable for a culture period of up to 50 days (Fig. 1b) . Neither cell death nor cell proliferation were observed in the bioprinted spheroids which is indicated by the stable size of the spheroids throughout the cultivation (Fig. 1c) . After treatment with a differentiation stimulus the 3D bioprinted spheroids became fully functional "mini bones". This was highlighted by the alkaline phosphatase activity and the Ca 2+ deposits within the 3D bioprinted spheroids (Fig. 1d,e) .
