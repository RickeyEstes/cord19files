LiCl and DG cytotoxicity in LLC-PK1 cells. The cellular cytotoxic effect of LiCl and DG in LLC-PK1 cells was determined using the CCK8 kit. The structure of DG is shown in Figure 1A . The maximum LiCl and DG concentrations that resulted in a cell viability higher than 80% were 60 mM and 1250 µg/mL, respectively ( Figure 1B ,C). No differences in cell morphology compared to the mock-treated cells were observed (data not shown) at concentrations of 60 mM LiCl and 1250 µg/mL DG; therefore, 10-60 mM LiCl and 125-1250 µg/mL DG were used in subsequent antiviral assays. LiCl and DG inhibit PDCoV replication. Next, we investigated the effect of LiCl and DG on the replication of PDCoV in LLC-PK1 cells. PK-1 cells were infected with PDCoV at MOI 0.05 for 1 h and treated with 10-60 mM LiCl or 125-1250 µg/mL DG for 24 h. The relative mRNA expression was detected by real-time qPCR. Treatment with 10-60 mM LiCl or 125-1250 µg/mL DG inhibited viral mRNA levels significantly (Figures 2A and 3A) . Infectious virus loads in cell culture supernatants were determined by TCID 50 . We found that 10-60 mM LiCl or 125-1250 µg/mL DG significantly inhibited viral replication compared to mock-treated cells ( Figures 2B and 3B ). In IFA, the fluorescence intensity declined after treatment with 10-60 mM LiCl or 125-1250 µg/mL DG in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures 2C and 3C ). The fluorescence intensity was quantified, showing that the number of infected cells decreased in a drug dose-dependent manner ( Figures 2D and 3D ). These results indicate that LiCl and DG inhibit PDCoV replication in a dose-dependent manner.  LiCl and DG cytotoxicity in LLC-PK1 cells.

These results indicate that LiCl and DG inhibit PDCoV replication in a dose-dependent manner. DG but not LiCl inhibits virus attachment to cells. To further explore in which step of the viral life cycle the drugs work, viral attachment and entry assays were performed in LLC-PK1 cells. There were no significant differences between mock-treated cells and cells treated with 60 mM LiCl in viral attachment or entry based on the mean relative viral mRNA levels ( Figure 4A ). In the entry experiments, there were no significant differences between mock-treated cells and cells treated with 1250 µg/mL DG in the mean relative viral mRNA levels. In viral attachment assays, DG treatment led to a significant reduction of viral mRNA levels compared to mock-treated cells ( Figure 4B ). LiCl and DG have no viricidal effect on PDCoV virions. To understand whether LiCl and DG have a direct (viricidal) effect on virions, we incubated PDCoV (MOI 0.05) with 60 mM LiCl or 1250 µg/mL DG for 2 h at room temperature or 37 • C before infection of LLC-PK1 cells. The infectious titer was determined by TCID 50 at 48 hours postinfection (hpi). We found that none of the drugs directly inhibited PDCoV infectivity ( Figure 5A,B) . The antiviral effects of LiCl and DG occur at the early stage of PDCoV replication. To further illustrate the effect of LiCl and DG on PDCoV infection, we performed time of addition experiments ( Figure 6A ). Therefore, LiCl or DG was added to infected LLC-PK1 cells at different times. In the '0 hpi' experiment, drugs and virus were added together to LLC-PK1 cells for 1 h. The cells were then washed, and the incubation was continued in the presence of the drugs. In the other experiments, LLC-PK1 cells were infected with PDCoV for 1 h, the cells were then washed, and the drugs were added at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 hpi. In all experiments, the cells were infected with PDCoV [ multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 0.05], and 60 mM LiCl or 1250 µg/mL DG was added. The viral contents were significantly reduced in cells treated with LiCl at 0 to 16 h, but no significant reduction was detected after 16 h ( Figure 6B ). For DG, the latest effective time point of drug treatment was 12 hpi ( Figure 6C ). Therefore, we can conclude that the antiviral effects of LiCl and DG occur at the early stages of PDCoV replication. Green fluorescence represents PDCoV replication, while blue fluorescence represents the nuclear distribution. (D) The fluorescence intensity in C was quantified with the software ImageJ.

The AnnexinV Alexa Fluor647/PI kit was used to detect cell apoptosis. We found that PDCoV could cause apoptosis within 36 hpi. The percentages of apoptotic cells infected by mock-treated, LiCl-treated viruses, and DGtreated viruses were 30.1%, 2.3%, 3.3%, respectively (Figure 7) . Additionally, both drugs presented the same apoptosis-inhibition trend. Therefore, it can be concluded that LiCl and DG can inhibit PK1 cell apoptosis caused by PDCoV infection.
