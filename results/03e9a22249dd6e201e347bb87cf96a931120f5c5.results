A new multicycle viral replication assay enables assessment of high-risk viral pathogens under BSL2 conditions The multicycle replication assay that we described previously [20] as well as other BSL2 amenable assays [22, 23, 24] , require production of pseudotyped stocks specific for each new emerging virus. This significantly adds to the time required to establish an assay for each new virus. In order to facilitate more universal application of this technology, we have established a simple system for multiple viruses that can be used for evaluating antivirals and antibody efficacy. We modified the original assay by using only a single pseudotyped virus for infection. The pseudotyped virus used in this system is prepared with a VSV background, using VSV delta G pseudotyped with VSV G. This enables virus entry mediated by VSV G, but does not result in subsequent rounds of infection by VSV. By supplying the envelope glycoproteins of the ''new'' virus in trans, the resulting virus production and release is of a pseudotyped ''new'' virus, which mimics native virus in terms of infection, replication and release (see Fig. 1 ). To test this concept, 293 T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the surface glycoproteins of NiV (G/F), concomitantly with YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) to allow visualization of the transfection. Transfected cells were then either infected with pseudotyped VSV-DG carrying RFP (allowing visualization of infected cells) or left uninfected. A set of control wells with cells transfected with a control plasmid were also infected with the pseudotyped virus. The virus underwent multicycle replication in transfected cells as indicated by an increase in RFP expression over time after infection (Fig. 2) . Even though the initial infection event is mediated by VSV pseudotyped virus, the second, and subsequent, rounds will be those of NiV due to the expression of the transfected glycoproteins (G/F). For high-throughput screening (HTS) a universal measure of assay quality and robustness, is the Z value. A Z9 value 1.0 is considered to be perfect, and assays with a value above 0.5 are required. The Z9 value for the multicycle replication as compared to the uninfected control was 0.83 (table 1) , rendering it amenable to HTS.
