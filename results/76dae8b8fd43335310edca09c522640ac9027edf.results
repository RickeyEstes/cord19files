The nsp4C monomer possesses a novel fold The crystal of WT nsp4C belongs to space group C2 and the structure covers amino acid residues from T408-T492, while the C425S mutant belongs to space group P4 1 2 1 2 and covers residues from T408-L495. The monomer structure of WT nsp4C. The WT nsp4C monomer contains four a-helices (a1-a4) and two short b-strands (b1-b2). The N-terminal starts from a short a-helix (a1, T408-T415), followed by a short b-strand (b1, T416-T420) connecting a1 and another short a-helix (a2, E422-S430), which is connected to a long a-helix (a3, S432-Y446) by a short loop. Notably, a long loop connects helix a3 and another long a-helix (a4, D454-N474); a-helices a3 and a4 point towards each other, and the loop connecting them enables a4 to turn to the back of a3 and connect by a short loop to b-strand b2 (b2, D480-Q484). The strands b2 and b1 are anti-parallel, while b2 is extending further via a long loop to the C-terminus of the molecule (Fig. 1) . A DALI search for structural similarity reveals no close homolog to nsp4C in the Protein Data Bank, indicating this structure should have a new fold ( Fig. 2A and 2B) . The refined WT model contains two nsp4C molecules in one asymmetric unit, termed A and B respectively. The structures of molecule A and B are generally similar with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between equivalent Ca atoms of 0.47 Å , although there was a notable lack of electron density for residues S489-Q496 in molecule A and residues S493-Q496 in molecule B. From the crystal packing of WT dimer shown in Fig. 3D , it is evident that C-terminal of molecule B in the dimer (colored in magenta) intersects with the Cterminal of another symmetry-related molecule (colored in blue); the same interaction is not observed in the C-terminal of molecule A. Thus, the interaction with symmetry-related molecules at the C-terminal of molecule B helps to stabilize its conformation and results in detectable electron density from S489-T492. The lack of this interaction in molecule A results in its flexibility and undetectable electron density from S489-Q496. The electrostatic surface potential of molecules A and B is shown in Fig. 3A and 3B respectively. Notably, the surfaces of both molecule A and B show a hydrophobic cavity formed by residues Ile419, Met453, Thr455, Tyr458, Ala461, Ala462, Gln465, Leu466, Ala469, Phe473, Val481, Leu482, Tyr483, Pro485, Pro486, Thr487 and Ala488. The region from Ala488 to Thr492 bends over the hydrophobic patch located in the loop connecting the helices a3 and a4 to form a hole on the surface. Amino acids located in the Ala488 -Thr492 and Ser450-Met452 loops are critical in forming the hole. The positively charged amino acids Tyr443 and Arg447 in a2, and Lys467 in a3, form a positive charged region around this hydrophobic cavity. The monomer structure of nsp4C mutant C425S. Both WT nsp4C and the C425S mutant contain two monomers in one asymmetric unit, and the conformation of the WT and mutant monomers are quite similar, with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) between equivalent Ca atoms of less than 1.0 Å . The major differences arise from three regions in the monomer (Fig. 3D ). The first is the loop from Ser449 to Met452 which forms an additional b-strand b3 in the C425S mutant; interaction of this region with the C-terminal of the monomer in the mutant dimer produces this deviation. The second region is located between Asn476-Asn479, which is formed by interaction with symmetry related molecules as a result of crystal packing (Fig. 3D ). The third occurs in the C-termini of the monomers, where an additional bstrand b4 in the mutant monomer is observed with detectable electron density from Ser493 to Leu495, while the equivalent region of the wild-type monomer exists as a long loop. Thus, the mutant C425S monomer structure contains four ahelices (a1-a4) and four b-strands (b1-b4). The conformation of the four a-helices and b-strands b1-b2 are identical to WT, while a short b-strand (b3, S449-M452) between a3 and a4 and a long b-strand b4 (b4, T487-S493) at the C-terminal are formed for stability of the dimer during the crystal packing. The electrostatic surface potential of the mutant monomer is similar to WT nsp4C but with the addition of an extended hydrophobic surface formed by the elongated C-terminal, the hydrophobic cavity is similar in both the WT and C425S mutant structures, and the Ala488-Leu495 (b4) and Ser450-Met452 (b3) loops are critical in forming the hole in the surface of mutant monomer (Fig. 3C) . It is also likely that the C-terminal is essential for stability both in the WT nsp4C and C425S mutant, since the expression of a DF484-Q496 deletion mutant has very low yield compared to the WT nsp4C protein.
