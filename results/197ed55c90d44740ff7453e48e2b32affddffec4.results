No appreciable signs of illness could be detected in Arsv-challenged or unchallenged birds, except the presence of slight nasal and ocular discharges on day 8 after challenge in four unvaccinated Arnv-challenged birds. These signs were not seen after day 10 after AIBV challenge. The data on effects of AIBV challenge on egg production, egg weight, eggshell weight and internal egg quality are presented in Figs I to 4. An overall comparison of percentage egg production, average egg weights, eggshell weights, SWUSA and Haugh unit scores of eggs from birds of various treatment groups is summarised in Table I  Overall total 40 days study period t Shell weight (mgl per egg surface area Icm 2 ) * Mean and standard deviation data ยง 1 Massachusetts killed virus vaccinated unchallenged 2 Unvaccinated (Massachusetts killed virus) unchallenged 3 Massachusetts killed virus vaccinated AIBV challenged 4 Unvaccinated I Massachusetts killed virus I AIBV challenged a.b Any two means carrying the same superscript in the same column are not significantly different from each other 25 production occurred between AIBV challenged and unchallenged birds from day 15 after challenge onwards. The birds in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups had significant drops in production throughout the post-challenge period (Fig I) . In addition the AIBV challenge in both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups caused laying of soft-shelled, misshapen and small eggs. Quite a large number of eggs (3' 9 per cent) laid by the AlBv-challenged birds were either soft-shelled, small or had calcareous papule-like deposits on the egg shells. These types of effects were negligible (0' 75 per cent) in the unchallenged birds. The differences in mean egg weights are presented in Fig 2. Mean egg weights from unchallenged and AlBV challenged groups were also significantly different. Although all the birds receiving AIBV challenge showed a decrease in egg shell weight (Fig 3) , the birds that were vaccinated as adults and challenged had relatively lower effects on shell weights up to day 15 after challenge than those challenged birds not receiving MlBV vaccine as adults. The SWUSA of unchallenged birds remained more or less at similar levels throughout the study period, whereas a trend towards a decrease in SWUSA score was noted in challenged birds. The average SWUSA scores of eggs from unchallenged birds were significantly higher (P<0'005) than those of challenged birds. The mean egg surface area (cm-) and SWUSA scores of eggs from birds in various treatment groups are presented in Table 2 . The Haugh unit scores are presented in Fig 4 and the overall percentages of egg production by grades are summarised in Table 3 . The Haugh unit scores of eggs from AIBV challenged groups dropped significantly (P<O' (05) on day 10 after AIBV challenge and remained less than those from the unchallenged groups throughout the study. The HI te;t did not detect any significant antibody titres to AIBV or MIBV in the prevaccination serum samples taken from adult birds. The prevaccination sera from birds had GMT titres of 20, or less, and 24, or less, for xmv.and MIBV, respectively. The killed MIBV vaccine proved to be quite effective in elaborating the humoral antibody response of the birds as a rise in MIRV GMT-HI titres in birds receiving killed MIRV vaccine was noted from day 14 to day 22 after vaccination. The highest MIBV GMT-HI titres (GMT>723) were observed in killed MIBv-vaccinated birds on day 22 after vaccination. A consistent drop in MIRV GMT-HI titres was noted from day 22 after vaccination to the end of the study. Very low MIBV GMT-HI titre (GMT<20)were detectable on day 231 after killed MIRV vaccination in unchallenged birds. The unvaccinated and unchallenged birds had quite negligible HI titres (MIBV or AIBV) throughout the study period (GMT<28). The MIBV GMT-HI titres for post-challenge period are presented in
