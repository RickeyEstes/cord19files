A total of 200 respondents completed the interview during June 26-30, 2015. Although small, a sample size of 200 allows an estimate of population prevalence of 50% in risk perceptions or attitudes with a 95% confidence interval and with a margin of error of ±7%, considered acceptable in preliminary surveys. Among the respondents, 51% were women, 18% were older than age 60 years, and 57% obtained at least tertiary education (Appendix Table S2 ). The mean scores, standard deviation, and values of internal consistency of risk perception constructs and attitudes toward quarantine are shown in Table 1 . Risk perceptions toward MERS were low. Only 9% of respondents perceived their personal probability of being infected with MERS to be greater than the average level for the population, whereas 24% perceived the severity of MERS to be greater than average levels of severity; 32% indicated worry about being infected with MERS. Men expressed less worry than did women (odds ratio [OR], 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.99; P = .049). Perceived selfefficacy in preventing MERS and awareness of social normative pressure to prevent against MERS were at moderate levels ( Table 1) . Only 33% of the respondents expressed (agree/strongly agree) trust in the adequacy of government control measures. Level of trust in government was marginally lower in higher educated groups (OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27-1.01 for tertiary or above referenced against secondary or below; P = .053). Compared with respondents aged 20-39 years, respondents aged 40-59 years (OR, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.05-9.74; P < .001) and those aged 60 years or older (OR, 5.99; 95% CI, 2.36-15.18; P < .001) indicated more trust in the government. Respondents on average indicated moderate anxiety about the current MERS outbreak (Table 1) . Men reported less anxiety (β, −0.26; t(199) = −3.70; P < .001). Mean scores of the 9 items used to measure quarantine attitudes were calculated, with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes toward quarantine. Respondents held generally unfavorable attitudes toward quarantine (Table 1) . Of the respondents, only 1 (0.5%) agreed that "a person who is quarantined should stay away from others," 6% agreed that "people who ignore quarantine orders are very selfish," 73% agreed that "quarantine is not every effective to stop the spread of MERS," 79% agreed that "so many people are affected by MERS that quarantine is pointless," 85% agreed that "MERS is not very infectious so quarantine is pointless," 86% believed "I don't understand why quarantine is needed for MERS," 82% agreed that "implementation of quarantine may increase risk of spreading MERS," 57% agreed that "I can understand why people ignore quarantine instructions," and 56% agreed that "the way in which the government implemented quarantine is not effective to control MERS." Respondents with higher educational attainment held less favorable attitudes toward quarantine (β, −0.29; t(199) = −4.17; P < .001).
