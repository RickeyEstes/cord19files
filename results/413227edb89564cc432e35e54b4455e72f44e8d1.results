The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the S glycoprotein gene including four antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) of four TGEV strains (133, KT2, KT3 and KT4) isolated in Korea and KT2 strain (HKT2) passaged 104 times on ST cells were determined and compared with the sequences of published TGEV and PRCV strains (Fig. 1) . Korean TGEV isolates had nucleotide sequence similarity between 98.5% (KT2 and 133) and 99.5% (KT3 and KT4) with each other and they had nucleotide sequence similarity between 96.5% (KT2 and TFI83) and 99.0% (133 and NEB7 and PUR46-MAD) with non-Korean TGEV strains (Table 1 ). Korean TGEV isolates had amino acid sequence similarity between 97.2% (KT2 and 133) and 99.0% (KT3 and KT4) with each other and they had amino acid sequence similarity between 94.9% (KT2 and TFI83) and 97.6% (133 and NEB72) with foreign TGEV strains (Table 1) . Korean TGEV strains had six and five specific nucleotide and amino acid sequence differences, respectively, compared to foreign TGEV or PRCV strains. The seven Korean Fig. 1 . The deduced amino acid sequence comparisons of the amino terminal half region of S glycoprotein gene in Korean TGEV isolates KT2, KT3, KT4 and HKT2 strains with Korea field TGEV 133 strain isolated in 1997 (Kwon et al., 1998) , TFI83 (Chen et al., 1995) , MIL65-AME and BRI70-FS (Britton and Page, 1990; Wesley, 1990a) , PUR46-MAD, NEB72, TOY56 and PRCV isolate HOL87 strains (Sanchez et al., 1992) . The shaded regions indicate four antigenic site amino acids. Symbol (-) indicates positions where the sequences are identical to those of KT2. Deletions within the sequences are shown with asterisks. The five Korean TGEV-specific amino acids changes were underlined. TGEV-specific nucleotide changes were 1212 (T to C), 1234 (T or C to A), 1241 (C to T), 1321 (T to C), 1689 (C to A) and 1798 (G to C), and five amino acid changes were 412 (L to I), 414 (T to I), 441 (F to L), 563 (N to K) and 600 (D to H) (Fig. 1) . Korean TGEV KT2 strain had nine and seven specific nucleotide and amino acid sequence changes, respectively, compared to other Korean TGEV isolates and non-Korean TGEV or PRCV isolates. The nine Korean TGEV KT2-specific nucleotide changes were 926 (T), 1369 (T), Phylogenetic analysis of the S glycoprotein genes of Korean TGEV isolates and non-Korean TGEV or PRCV strain is shown in Fig. 2 . Four distinct branches were observed in the phylogenetic trees. Korean TGEV KT3, KT4 and HKT2 strains were branched into one group. Non-Korean TGEV or PRCV strains (TFI83, HOL87, BRI70-FS, MIL65-AME, TOY56, PUR46-MAD and NEB72) were branched into another group in which NEB72 and PUR46-MAD strains formed a subgroup different from the other foreign strains. Korean TGEV KT2 and 133 strains was separated distinctly from the other two groups.
