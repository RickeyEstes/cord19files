Clinical signs and virus isolation: All eight clinically suspected farms were serologically positive, even vaccinated farms had a very high titer of antibody ab to 1.4 Ã‚ 10 4 , in most of the farms the ELISA titer was increased in the second sampling, which indicate that reaction is not due to the vaccination. The IBV-Ab-test kit used allows differentiating between vaccinated and nonvaccinated farms, depending on the Antibody titer. The virus has been detected in all 8 poultry farms. The mortality in these farms was approximately 30% in the first 5 days of the onset of the disease and the birds suffered mainly from kidney damage and urolitheasis. In addition to kidney damage, respiratory signs and lesions were found in two broiler farms, where the disease was further complicated with other infections such as Airsacculitis due to E. coli infection, in which 4/91 was isolated, with a mortality rate of approximately 50-60%. These two farms lucked the hygienic measures and the birds had been vaccinated with 4/91 vaccine two weeks before the onset of the disease. The sequences of the isolated viruses from these two vaccinated broiler farms were identical with vaccine strain 4/91. A local isolate Sul/01/09 has been detected in five broiler farms, where the birds were suffering from nephropathologic lesions. On culturing the virus in egg embryos, one third of the embryos died after each passage of 4/91 strain. Dwarfism has been observed in both 4/91 and Sul/01/09 infected embryos. S1 sequence analysis: The first 1116 nucleotides encoding S1 spike glycoprotein subunit including the hyper variable regions were sequenced. Comparative analysis of the nucleotides and the deduced amino acid sequence of S1 subunit were performed to assess the relation of Sulaimani (Sul/01/09) isolate with other sequences and to find similarities with vaccine strains H120, MA5 and 4/91. It has been found that Sul/01/09 isolate is 27-28% different from all vaccine strains. However, it only deviates in 6% from Egypt/Benisuef/01 isolate and 5% from IS/885 and Israel/720/99 isolates from Israel (Table 2) . Nucleotide sequences of these four isolates are identical with about 96-97% similarity (Table 2) . Only a few restriction enzymes can be used to differentiate between these closely related isolates (Fig. 1) , these enzymes can be used for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) to identify and differentiate between them. Multiple sequence alignment of 14 different strains and isolates have been performed using CLUSTAL W version 1.83 (www.genome.jp) (Fig. 2) , which indicate that the regions at the positions 27-36, 95-114, 164-178, 207-247 and 335-363 of S1 subunit based on 4/91 strain (accession no. AF093794) are significantly conserved regions in almost all compared sequences. Hyper variable regions (HVRs) of 14 selected S1 amino acid sequences from geographically different regions are located in positions 50-78, 115-148, and 284-292 (Fig. 2) . The phylogenetic tree of the aligned amino acids was also produced using MEGA5 Beta version 6.1 online software (www.megasoftware.net) which shows a typical relatedness between sul/01/09 isolate and reference IBV strains from Israel, but not with isolates from our neighbor country Iran (Fig. 3) .
