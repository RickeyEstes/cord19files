A total of 424 samples were tested using RPM v.1 assays and parallel reference assays (culture and/or PCR tests). The sensitivity and specificity of the RPM v.1 assay were determined using various prototype strains and clinical samples in a previous study [15] . In this study, influenza virus was the most commonly identified respiratory pathogen by all methods. With respect to all reference assays, the RPM v.1 method showed a detection sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 96%, and an overall agreement of 98% (Table 2) for influenza A virus. For influenza B, the RPM v.1 detection sensitivity and specificity were 98% with an overall agreement of 97% (Table 2 ). All but three influenza culturepositive specimens were also positive on microarrays. However, two specimens identified as influenza A-positive by culture were clearly detected as influenza B on microarrays. Real-time RT-PCR later concurred with the microarray results and not culture that these 2 specimens were indeed influenza B-positive. The RPM v.1 also demonstrated excellent detection sensitivity, specificity, and overall agreement with respect to the reference assay results for other pathogens detected (Table S2-S3) . The capability of the RPM v.1 system for the identification of complex mixtures of pathogens [15, 16, 17] were further demonstrated through assessment of the incidence of co-infections in the 424 samples. Of these samples, 58 (13.7%) showed viral or viral/ bacterial co-infections as determined by RPM and/or culture (Table 4 ). These co-infections were further verified using published type-specific PCR assays and in-house specific PCR primers (Table S1 ). It is well known that S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis colonize the mouth and upper respiratory system, so it is not surprising that these were common co-infections found in clinical samples. However, consistent with our previous study [15] , quantitative real-time PCR data showed that most of the S. pneumoniae present in influenza-positive samples harbored a high titer ($10 4 genome copies/ml) as compared to influenza-negative samples (data not shown). The high titer bacteria present in these clinical samples was possibly virally induced bacterial superinfection, as first suggested by the findings of Madhi et al. [21] and Peltola and McCullers [22] . A critical aspect for influenza epidemiology is to track genetic changes within influenza strains, since antigenic drift is the mechanism by which influenza viruses escape from immunological pressure induced by previous natural exposures and vaccinations. Analysis of the key amino acids (deduced from nucleotide sequence) in the HA3 sequences of all influenza A H3N2 positive isolates revealed two major circulating strains: A/New York/258/ 2005 (Group I) and A/Aichi/133/2005 (Group II) ( Table 3) . Group I belongs to the A/California/7/2004 lineage and carries signature amino acids substitutions in antigenic site D: valine to isoleucine at position 226 (V226I) and serine to proline at position 227 (S227P). Group II showed an A/Wellington/1/04 lineage signature amino acid substitution at position 227 (S227P), and serine to asparagine at position 216 (S216N), the key amino acid at antigenic site B. Surprisingly, the only outlier sample was identified as A/Wyoming/3/03 (with IS)-like isolate. Amino acids position at 216 correspond to 188, 226 corresponds to 198, and 227 corresponds to 199 on the tiled prototype sequence (Table 3) . Using 15 representative samples, phylogenetic analysis comparison between the sequences generated from RPM v.1 (68 to 96% resolved bases) (Fig. 1A ) and the sequences generated via conventional sequencing (100% resolved bases) (Fig. 1B) , showed similar results, indicating that ambiguous base calls from the microarray did not affect phylogeny determination for influenza A viruses (Table 3 , Fig. 1 ). The representative samples were the A/ Wyoming
