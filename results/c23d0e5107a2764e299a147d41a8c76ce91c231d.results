The E1, E2, E6 and E7 protein sequences from all high-risk HPV strains were collected from UniProtKB and aligned using multiple sequence alignment software clustalW. The multiple alignment files for all the four protein data sets with conserved regions are shown in Supplementary File 1. The conserved fragments within aligned strains of sequence datasets were analyzed by PVS with variability threshold (H) B 2.0. Typically, positions with H C 2.0 are considered variable, whereas those with H B 1 are consider highly conserved (Litwin and Jores 1992) . Additionally the positions with H B 2 and H [ 1 are also considered as conserved regions (Gupta et al. 2009 . The default cutoff value (H = 1) was too strict, resulting in fewer and smaller targets for the following analysis so the cutoff threshold value was set as 2.0 in the present analysis to identify reasonable conserved fragments with length C9 amino acid residues. The consensus sequences of all the conserved regions with length C9 amino acids in four datasets of E1, E2, E6 and E7 proteins from high-risk HPV strains are shown in Table 1 . To generate immunological responses against any pathogen, the binding of antigenic peptide from pathogen and its binding affinity to MHC molecules is one of the crucial steps (Roomp et al. 2010 ). Using NetMHC 3.2 server, we predicted a total of 65 unique epitopes from the consensus sequences dataset of E1 protein. Likewise, 8 from E2, 5 from E6 and 2 unique epitopes from E7 protein consensus sequence datasets were predicted by the server with either strong or weak binding affinity (Supplementary Table 1-4). As epitopes were predicted from the consensus conserved peptide fragments of protein datasets through NetMHC 3.2 server, there are chances that some of the epitopes may not show 100 % identity with any of the protein in the datasets due to presence of consensus amino acid residues substituted during conservancy analysis. To verify this, epitopes were realigned with the primary protein datasets of E1, E2, E6 and E7 proteins collected for various high-risk HPV strains. Those epitopes which were not completely mapped with any of the primary protein sequences of high-risk HPV strains were filtered out. In this process, 16 epitopes from E1, 2 from E2, 2 from E6 and both the epitopes from E7 datasets were discarded. To predict the long immunogenic peptide fragments, all the overlapping epitopes were merged (Table 2 ). In total, 15 immunogenic conserved peptide fragments were identified, of which 11 fragments were from E1, 3 from E2 and 1 fragment was from E6 protein dataset of high-risk HPV strains. To further identify the minimal set of immunogenic peptide fragment datasets to target all the high-risk HPV strains, we discarded those peptide fragments where the targeted HLA alleles and high-risk HPV strains were the subsets of other highly efficient peptide fragments shown in Table 2 . In this process, immunogenic peptide sequence ECAIFYKAR (Table 2 : E2-F2) from the high-risk HPV strain 69 was filtered out as it can be considered the subset of immunogenic fragment E1-F6 which is also present in type 69 HPV strain and also target the same allele besides its affinity with other alleles. Thus, in total, we have identified a peptide pool of 14 sequences that might be effective to generate immunogenic responses against any of the high-risk HPV strains. The interaction map of immunogenic peptide fragments, their HLA allelic responses and their presence in various HPV high-risk strains are shown in Fig. 1 . To discard peptide fragments that can be recognized as self protein for the immune system we performed BLAST screening of all the 14 immunogenic peptides with entire human proteome. None of the peptide was similar to human proteome. We finally performed the population coverage analysis of generated immunogenic peptide pool using population coverage analysis tool available at IEDB server (http://tools. immuneepitope.org/tools/population). The percentage population coverage of the immunogenic peptide pool generated from the current analysis in various ethnicities is shown in Table 3 .
