The effect of rat strain was highly significant in the first week of the experiment (Table 2 ) and the different rat strains had different response profiles on P if (Fig. 1,  upper left) . However, this effect did not appear on other rats the following week (Fig. 1, upper right) . There was a significant effect of the interaction term Strain Â Week, while none of the main effects, Strain or Week were significant although Strain was of borderline significance (Table 2 ). This implies that the response pattern for each rat strain was different in the two experimental periods. There was a significant effect of time on the repeated measurements, i.e. the curves were not horizontal. The P if was falling throughout the 1 h recording procedure a pattern recognized in an inflammatory response . There was a significant interaction term for Time Â Strain in the experiment done in the first week, indicating that the reaction curves for the different strains had different shapes and/or slopes. However, the following week's experiment produced response curves that were not different between strains. The strains contribute differently to this effect. Wistar and F344 are the main contributors to the difference between the weeks in the three last time periods, as can be exemplified in a Strain Â Week leverage plot for the 16-30 min time period (Fig. 2) . There was a significant interaction term for Strain Â Food (Table 2 ). This effect could be seen in Fig. 1 , where the mean response curves for the feeding groups appear in the reverse order in the consecutive weeks. Only 12 of the 46 rats behaved like 'normal controls' (i.e. with horizontal curves throughout the 1 h recording and no mean total P if less than À2 mmHg, . A log-linear analysis could not identify an increased likelihood of 'normal controls' in any experimental group (data not shown). When the statistical analysis was performed with n ¼ 23; i.e. in effect by stating that only one measurement can be obtained from all animals in the same cage, the statistical differences above disappeared (see below).
