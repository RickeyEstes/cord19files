As described in Materials and Methods, we assembled a data set of 12 experimentally validated pairs of overlapping protein-coding genes (table 1), in which the ancestral and the de novo genes could be unambiguously identified from the phylogenetic distribution of their homologs. We predicted the structural and functional organization of their protein products ( fig. 2 , discussed further later, see also Materials and Methods). All overlapping regions were longer than 220 nucleotides (table 1) . Among the 12 de novo genes in our data set, nine genes overlap completely with their ancestral gene, whereas three overlap only partially: the machlomovirus p31 gene, the omegatetravirus p17 gene, and the ilarvirus 2 b gene ( fig. 2 ).
