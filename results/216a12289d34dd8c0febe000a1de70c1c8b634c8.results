We collected sputum samples from all pilgrims hospitalized in 15 hospitals of two cities in Saudi Arabia who were diagnosed with severe CAP during the 2013 Hajj season. Thirty-eight patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria; they were predominantly elderly (mean age 58.6 years, range 25-83 years) and male (68.4%). All patients were from developing countries, the majority of whom (78.3%) were from Asia. The nationalities most represented were Indonesia (32.4%), Pakistan (18.9%), and India (10.8%). Of the 38 patients, 30 (78.9%) required ICU admission. Fourteen (36.8%) patients died, while the remaining patients recovered and were discharged. The mortality rate among those admitted to the ICUs was 46.6%. MERS-CoV was not detected in any of the sputum samples. Other respiratory pathogens were detected in 26 (68.4%) of the 38 samples, while the remaining samples were negative for the 22 respiratory pathogens in the testing panel (Table 1 ). Of the positive samples, bacterial pathogens were detected in 84.6% (22/26) and viruses in 80.7% (21/26). Twenty-one (80.7%) samples were positive for more than one respiratory pathogen and 17 (65.3%) were positive for both bacteria and viruses. The most common respiratory virus was human rhinovirus, which was detected in 57.7% of the positive amples, followed by influenza A virus (23.1%) and human coronaviruses (19.2%). H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae were the predominant bacteria, detected in 57.7% and 53.8%, respectively, of the positive samples, followed by M. catarrhalis (36.4%).
