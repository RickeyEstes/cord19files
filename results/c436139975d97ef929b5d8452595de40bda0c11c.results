Between January 2011 and April 2015, a total of 113 participants were screened for the study (Figure 1 ). Fifteen participants were excluded: 8 did not have a positive test for influenza at the site, 2 had blood types for which ABO matched plasma was not available, 2 were judged unable to tolerate a 500ml volume, and 3 were excluded for other reasons. Twenty of the 29 participating sites enrolled at least one participant into the trial. The study was stopped in 2015 at the end of the influenza season, after being within 2 participants of the enrollment goals. Ninety-eight participants were randomized. Eleven participants were excluded from the Primary Efficacy Population (PEP) because their initial samples were PCR negative by central laboratory testing. The median age of the randomized participants was 53 years (range 0-95 years). Eleven children and two pregnant women were enrolled ( Table 1 ). The majority of participants had underlying medical conditions, with hypertension and chronic pulmonary disease being the most common (medical conditions present in ≥ 10% of participants are presented in Table 1 ). Participants had a median 4 days of influenza illness prior to enrollment, and 61% (N=60) had received antivirals prior to randomization (median 2 days of antivirals prior to enrollment). All participants received antibiotics (the protocol did not dictate which antibiotics would be used). No participants received naproxen, and only 6 participants received azithromycin. At baseline, 79 (82%) of participants required oxygen, 56 (58%) were in the ICU, and 41 (43%) were on mechanical ventilation. Adults had a median APACHE II score of 13, reflecting an anticipated 15% mortality, [7] whereas children had a median PRISM III score of 3 reflecting an anticipated 2% mortality. [8] The participants randomized to receive standard care had slightly more severe illness at baseline compared to those randomized to plasma (oxygen requirement in 43 participants (88%) vs. 36 (77%) and mechanical ventilation in 24 participants (49%) vs. 17 (36%)). Thirty five (57%) participants had multi-lobar infiltrates on chest X-ray and was similar in both arms, and 31 (51%) had pleural effusions which were more common in the standard care arm (59% (19) vs 41% (12)). The protocol did not mandate any evaluation of the pleural effusions, though no empyema's were reported. Loss to follow up for completion of the study (Day 28) was higher in the participants that received standard care (22% (N=10) vs. 10% (4)), though follow up through the primary endpoint (or Day 28 if not reaching endpoint, or death) was similar (82% (37) vs. 86% (36)). Forty-five (92%) participants randomized to the plasma received the full planned treatment. Four participants (8%) randomized to receive plasma did not actually receive plasma (see Figure 1 for reasons). One pediatric participant randomized to standard care was inadvertently administered plasma. For participants that received plasma, the first unit of plasma was administered at a median of 3·9 hours (IQR 2·4, 6·1) following randomization, with a median 2·5 hours between units (IQR 1·7, 3·4). 99% of participants received antivirals (97% oseltamivir monotherapy). Twenty-eight (67%) participants randomized to receive plasma had documented resolution of tachypnea and hypoxia by Day 28, compared to 24 (53%) of control participants (p = 0·069) ( Figure 2A ). The hazard ratio of plasma + standard of care vs. standard of care alone was 1.71 [95% CI: 0·96, 3·06]. From the Kaplan-Meier analysis, with the caveat that the study evaluated tachypnea and hypoxia at Days 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 and 28, the estimated median time to resolution of tachypnea and hypoxia was 7 days (lower quartile 2 days) among participants randomized to receive plasma versus 28 days (lower quartile 7 days) among participants randomized to the control arm. Due to the higher than expected loss to followup, sensitivity analysis was performed with follow-up censored at last available assessment with sufficient respiratory status data (p = 0·086). Six participants randomized to receive plasma resolved the tachypnea and hypoxia present at screening by the time of baseline (prior to receiving plasma), as compared to one among participants that received standard care. With these participants excluded, 22 (61%) participants in the PEP randomized to receive plasma had resolution of tachypnea and hypoxia by Day 28, compared to 23 (52%) of controls (p = 0·26). The benefit was primarily seen in participants who were enrolled within 4 days of symptoms (treatment by subgroup interaction p-value = 0·038). ( Figure  2B ). As the participants randomized to standard care had slightly more severe disease at baseline, in order to evaluate the influence of these baseline differences, analysis was performed stratified by use of oxygen, mechanical ventilation, ICU requirement, and presence of ARDS. All demonstrated similar results as in the primary analysis (stratified logrank p=0·019 to 0·12). Participants randomized to the plasma arm had a better disposition after hospital discharge (p=0·029; Table 2 ). A similar finding (p=0·020) was noted in a post-hoc analysis using a 6step scale of clinical status at Day 7 (death, in ICU, hospitalized on oxygen, hospitalized not on oxygen, not hospitalized but not returned to normal activities, or not hospitalized and returned to normal activities). Better outcomes among participants randomized to receive plasma in the PEP across multiple other pre-specified measures of efficacy were also observed though they did not achieve statistical significance (Table 2 ). For participants randomized to receive plasma, there were fewer days in the hospital after randomization (median 6 vs. 11, p= 0·13), fewer participants with hospital readmissions (2 vs. 7, p=0·096), fewer participants with ICU admissions (57% vs. 69%, p = 0·097), and fewer days on mechanical ventilation (median 0 vs. 3, p=0·14). In contrast, the days on oxygen after randomization were not different (median 7 vs. 8, p=0·52), nor were the days in the ICU after randomization (median 2·5 vs. 3, p = 0·37). As in the case of the primary endpoint, the benefit appeared greatest in participants who had ≤ 4 of symptoms prior to randomization ( Figure 2B , proportional hazards model p = 0·038). In those without ARDS at baseline, no participant randomized to receive plasma developed ARDS, whereas 3 receiving standard care (11·5% of the standard care participants without ARDS at baseline) did so (p=0·067). No difference between the treatments was found for the time to resolution of typical influenza symptoms (p = 0·57) nor resolution of fever (p=0·99). (Supplemental Figures 1 and 2) Six participants died: 1 of 49 (2%) randomized to receive plasma compared to 5 of 49 (10%) among participants randomized to receive standard care (Randomized Population ITT analysis, p = 0·093, hazard ratio: 0·19 [95% CI: 0·02, 1·65]). The one participant that died after receiving plasma died 8 days after plasma infusion due to septic shock. All deaths were judged not related to study interventions. Analysis by treatment received (2% vs. 10%, p = 0·096), and restricted to the PEP (2% vs. 10%, p = 0·10) gave similar results. Participants randomized to receive plasma had about 1 log copies/mL lower nasal and oral influenza viral loads (detected by quantitative PCR) at baseline (nasal: median 2·8 vs. 3·8 log 10 copies/mL; oral 2·4 vs. 3·3 log 10 copies/mL), although viral loads in the 23 participants who had an endotracheal aspirate (5·0 vs. 5·1 log 10 copies/mL) were similar. (Table 3 ) There was no appreciable difference in time to virus becoming undetectable (nasal: p = 0·95; oral: p=0·56) ( Figure 3) The HAI titer achieved by infused plasma cannot be determined separately from the participant's pre-existing immunity and immune response. For H1N1 2009, which was a strain in circulation throughout the study, the geometric mean HAI titer in study participants at baseline was 1:26·4 [95% CI: Thirty percent of the study population had serious adverse events (SAEs). Fewer plasma recipients than controls had SAEs (9 (20%) vs. 20 (39%), p= 0·041). The most common SAEs were acute respiratory distress syndrome and stroke. Each of these occurred in 3 participants (3%): 1 plasma recipient, 2 controls (Table 4 ). No category of SAE appeared more frequently among plasma recipients. The most common adverse events occurring in the first 7 days were hyperglycemia, increased aspartate aminotransferase, diarrhea, anemia, and fever (Table 5 ).
