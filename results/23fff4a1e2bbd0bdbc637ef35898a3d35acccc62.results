A total of 518 patients were studied and the isolation rates for the various organisms are outlined in Table I . The adenoviruses were predominantly found on EM rather than culture. The largest single group was made up of non-specific cases whichamountedto 238 patients (46per cent). The contribution of EM to the diagnosis can be measured by the fact that if this procedure had not been employed, 44o patients (85 per cent) would have fallen into the nonspecific category. Picornaviruses were defined as small round particles of about 28 mm diameter seen on EM, but not cultured. Of the I32 rotavirus cases, 23 were associated with other organisms: I I type-specific Esch. coli, five ECHO viruses, four adenoviruses, two picornaviruses and one coxsackie B 2. The identification rate for rotaviruses was higher in winter than in summer; a reversal of this pattern was noted for adenoviruses (Table II) . The control group comprised a total of Io8 cases, 59 males and 49 females, with a mean age of I I-6 months and a range of four days to five years. The adenovirus was less commonly found compared to the study group and in all five cases was cultured. No rotaviruses were identified in this group (Table III) . In the study group the isolation rate for rotaviruses was relatively higher in the 6-I8 month age group (35"8 per cent) and lower in infants of less than six months (I6"4 per cent). Comparison of the rotavirus and non-specific groups yielded many results outlined below (Tables IV, V and VI) . Pyrexia was significantly commoner in the rotavirus cases (P < o.oo2) and maximum temperatures recorded in hospital tended to be higher in this group (Table IV) . Minor differences were observed in mean age, sex distribution, hospital stay, duration of diarrhoea, previous history of gastroenteritis and the incidence of vomiting, but these differences were not statistically significant (P > o-o5). The reporting of vomiting occurring before diarrhoea was significantly commoner in the rotavirus group (P < o.0I). Although a history of contact with another case of gastroenteritis was found more commonly in the rotavirus group, the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance (o. IO > P > o'o5); however, when such a history was confined to contact with adult cases, the difference was more pronounced and was statistically significant (P < o'o5). A significantly larger proportion of the rotavirus cases had symptoms or signs of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (P < o.oi) and a similar difference was noted for patients with visibly inflamed tympanic membranes (P < o.ooi). Three cases with pneumonia, diagnosed on both clinical and radiological criteria, and two of bronchitis, were observed amongst the rotavirus group; no such features were encountered in the non-specific group. Rectal bleeding, rashes, conjunctivitis, meningism and febrile convulsions were noted in a small number of cases and, interestingly, in none of the cases with a rash was there evidence of an enteroviral infection. The necessity to use intravenous fluids was significantly higher in the rotavirus group (P < o.ooi). The gastroenteritis patients as a whole tended to be of lower weight than normal on admission although the skewing of these figures may be partly accounted for by dehydration. Small differences in haemoglobin, ESR, urea, electrolytes and bicarbonate levels in the blood were noted, but none of these reached statistical significance. Hypernatraemic dehydration, a condition seen less frequently nowadays in association with gastroenteritis, was not significantly commoner in any group of patients.
