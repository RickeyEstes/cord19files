The output files listed in Table 2 containing the details of these analyses are provided as supplementary information for the web http://est.llnl.gov/forensics. The main results are summarized in Tables 3, 4, 5. The large number of genomes, variable sites, and character haplotypes illustrate the utility of this software for focusing in on the most informative combinations of sites. Only some of the mumps virus or SARS virus genomes can be uniquely discerned from other genomes of the same species. Unresolved clusters are given in Additional file 2. Computational prediction of PCR amplicon length variation (without restriction digest) for mumps virus indicates there are no variable length amplicons using the parameter values and definitions used here. Therefore, this method when restriction digest is omitted is not appropriate for genotyping mumps virus. A comparison of the SARS phylograms created using full genome sequences, SNPs, or PCR-RFLPs (Figures 2, 3 , 4, 5) illustrate that although there are similarities within the fine branch structure showing the relationship of very similar genomes, the basic structure of the trees differs. lists the genome groupings that correspond to each of the character haplotypes character_haplotypes lists the co-segregating SNPs or PCR-RFLPs that characterize each haplotype all_discriminating_sets for each genome, lists haplotype combinations ("sets") that will discriminate the specified genome to the maximum degree possible sim_anneal_results_summary lists combinations of sets of haplotypes to discriminate all the input genomes to the maximum degree possible using the fewest haplotypes. Each row is a unique combination that has the best score found, where the score is the number of haplotypes required. The minimum number of assays indicates the fewest haplotypes that need to be queried to discriminate all the input genomes to the maximum degree possible, that is, the number of assays that would need to be done to classify an unknown isolate in terms of its similarity to the currently sequenced strains using this type of forensic marker. The number combinations of Amplicon X Unique Fragment Length Distributions is the number of unique fragment length distributions summed over all variable amplicons. The number of combinations of Amplicon X Enzyme X Unique Fragment Length Distributions is summed over all variable amplicon, enzyme combinations in the PCR-RFLP analyses. Genetic distances, indicated by the lengths of the branches, vary among the trees, and the particular genome clusters predicted to be the least similar (longest branches) contrast among the trees. A tree created from an optimal solution for SNP forensics has little branching structure and homogeneous branch lengths, and does not appear very similar to or to provide as much information as trees created from all the SNP data or from the multiple genome alignment. Table 6 shows that the ranking of enzymes that most frequently generate RFLP variations in SARS virus are similar but not identical to the rankings for generating RFLP variations in mumps virus.
