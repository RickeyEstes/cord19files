Among 935 ARI patients, influenza A virus was detected in 260 specimens and influenza B virus was detected in 76 specimens using SRT-PCR, and influenza A virus was detected in 251 specimens and influenza B virus was detected in 69 specimens using MRT-PCR. There was significant agreement on influenza results between assays; for influenza A, kappa = 0.97, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) = 0.95-0.99, and Chi-square < 0.001; for influenza B, kappa = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.91-0.99, and Chi-square < 0.001; and for overall results, kappa = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.94-0.98, and Chi-square < 0.001. The sensitivity was 96% and 91% and specificity was 99.8% and 100%, respectively, for influenza A and influenza B, when SRT-PCR was treated as the gold standard ( Table 1) . The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value from SRT-PCR for influenza A was 27.4 (standard deviation (sd) = 5, = 250) and for influenza B was 27.2 (sd = 5.4, = 69). Among the SRT-PCR positives but MRT-PCR negatives for influenza A, the Ct values ranged from 21.7 to 39.3, with most (8 of 10 where data were available) being above 32.4 (which was 1 sd above the influenza A mean), suggesting that these were weak positives. Two of these SRT-PCR influenza A positives but MRT-PCR negatives were also positive for another virus in the multiplex assay (respiratory syncytial virus and human rhinovirus). Among the SRT-PCR positives but MRT-PCR negatives for influenza B, the Ct values ranged from 22.2 to 38.7, with most (4 of 7 where data were available) being above 32.6 (which was 1 sd above the influenza B mean), suggesting that these were weak positives. Three of these SRT-PCR influenza B positives but MRT-PCR negatives were also positive for another virus in the multiplex assay (respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus). Forty-seven percent of the discordant results and 49% of the concordant results were from persons who were vaccinated. The mean Ct value for ribonuclease P (RNaseP, a protein that may reflect sample quality) for 594 persons who were PCR negative was 28 (sd = 2.5) versus 29.1 (sd = 2.8) for those who were PCR positive. The one person who was MRT-PCR positive for influenza A but SRT-PCR negative had a RNaseP value of 24.7, suggesting that the sample quality was good. The RNaseP values for the SRT-PCR positive but MRT-PCR negative ranged from 24.7 to 32.9, with 3 specimens being higher than 31.9 (a level >1 sd above the RNaseP values for the other positives), suggesting that sample quality was good in the majority of such specimens.
