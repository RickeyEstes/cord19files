A total of 80 participants positive on influenza rapid antigen testing were randomized, 40 each to placebo and paracetamol. None was lost to follow up; one participant withdrew after 4 days due to a serious adverse event (acute kidney injury). Demographic and clinical characteristics of participants are shown in Table 1 . The majority had taken anti-pyretics in 48 h prior to randomization (median dose 1 g/day of paracetamol and 400 mg/day of NSAID in 50 and 29 participants respectively). Most patients (54/80) were referred by their general practitioner following attendance with an influenza-like illness. There were 46 participants who were PCR influenza-positive (A/H3N2 n = 33, A/H1N1 n = 4, A not typed n = 1, B n = 8): 22 in the placebo group and 24 in the paracetamol group (Fig. 1) . In 20 participants a non-influenza respiratory virus only was identified by PCR, and in 14 participants no virus was identified by PCR.
