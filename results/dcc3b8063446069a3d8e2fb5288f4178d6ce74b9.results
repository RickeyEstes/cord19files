A total of 295 hospital staff and 244 control cases (control group) were tested. The mean ages and sex ratio of the 2 groups are shown in Table 1 . With HI â‰¥ 40 as the cut-off value for seropositivity, the SPR of the hospital staff was significantly higher than that of the control group (20.0% vs. 2.9%, p < 0.001) ( Table 1) . To further delineate the possible role of close patient contact, the hospital staff were divided into first-line risk personnel (group 1) that included 120 doctors from the Division of Infectious Diseases, and inpatient nurses and staff from the Emergency Department, and second-line risk personnel (group 2) that included 175 general medical doctors, laboratory staff and administrative personnel. The SPR of group 1 was significantly higher than that of group 2 (30.8% vs. 12.6%, p < 0.001) ( Table 1) . There was no statistically significant difference in GMT antibodies to H1N1 influenza virus between the hospital staff and control group (47.2 vs. 48.8, p = 0.925) (Figure 1 ). There was also no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 (47.4 vs. 46.8, p = 0.962).
