Over the study period, a total of 624 placentas from deliveries were examined. Another 58 placentas accompanied by the fetuses were examined from spontaneous or elective mid-trimester abortions. Seven placentas satisfied the study criteria. They were denoted as P1 to P7 in the chronological order that the placentas were received. This designation is used to refer to either the patients or the placentas in the subsequent text. The first placenta (P1) was received in early April 2003 and the last placenta (P7) was received in November 2003. The uterine curettage specimen from a 9-week pregnant SARS patient was excluded from the study. Table 1 summarises the clinical and pathological findings of these cases and details of the control placentas.
