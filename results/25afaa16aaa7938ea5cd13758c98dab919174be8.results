The standard curve for the in-house rtRT-PCR assay generated from serially diluted standard RNA was linear (slope = −3.757) 4 http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/products/statistics/. The assay was linear over 6 orders of magnitude and was able to detect as few as 70 genomic equivalents per reaction. ( Fig. 1 ) and the coefficient of linear regression (R 2 ) was 0.998. The assay efficiency was estimated to be 84.6%. The developed assay was sensitive and able to detect 70 genomic equivalents of the target NSP5 gene per reaction. Furthermore, it was specific, with no amplification detected from DNA or RNA from other pathogens known to cause diarrhea in animal species. The assay was reproducible with intra-and inter-assay CVs ranging from 0.009 to 0.022 and 0.004 to 0.033, respectively. The limit of detection (95% confidence interval) for the RT-iiPCR reagent set was 4 and 3 copies of dsRNA, based on using log dilutions of in vitro transcribed dsRNA containing target bovine and equine rotavirus sequences, respectively. The comparison between sensitivity of the RT-iiPCR assay and commercially available rtRT-PCR assay using 10-fold serial dilutions of nucleic acid from a positive sample showed that the RT-iiPCR reagent set had a 100fold increase in sensitivity. Like the in-house assay, this assay was also specific, with no amplification in any of the samples used for specificity testing. There was variation in the percentage of positive samples detected by each assay. The RT-iiPCR assay detected the most, while EM detected the least. The overall percentages of positive samples by each diagnostic assay are shown in Table 2 . There was a significant difference in the number of positive samples detected with the in-house rtRT-PCR assay versus the other two molecular tests. These differences are evident when comparing the Kappa coefficients (Table 3) . The EM assay results showed substantial agreement in comparison to ELISA results. This agreement becomes fair when compared to the RT-iiPCR reagent set and the commercial rtRT-PCR kit, and moderate in comparison to the in-house rtRT-PCR assay. The ELISA showed moderate agreement with the RT-iiPCR reagent set and commercial rtRT-PCR assay but had substantial agreement with the in-house rtRT-PCR assay. A perfect agreement was found between the RT-iiPCR reagent set and the commercial rtRT-PCR assay (Table 3) . Comparison between the different assays showed a strong correlation for samples containing high viral loads (Ct values ≤25) (Table 4) .
