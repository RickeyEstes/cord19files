Two surveys in Guangzhou were conducted in May-June 2013 (Survey U1), and between December 2013 and January 2014 (Survey U2), with 500 and 549 interviews completed, respectively. Two surveys in the rural area of Zijin County recruited 308 subjects in July 2013 (Survey R1), and 300 between December 2013 and January 2014 (Survey R2). More young adults were recruited in the urban than rural area in all surveys. Urban subjects reported having relatively higher educational level on average in Survey U1 than those in Survey U2 (S1 Table) . Around half of the urban respondents (53.8%) reported having visited LPMs in the previous year in the first survey, around double that reported in the second survey (27.7%). Urban respondents in the first survey reported purchasing an average of 36.5 live poultry in the past year, while respondents in the second survey reported an average of 26.7 live poultry purchased in the past year. Of those who reported buying live poultry at least once, the proportion of respondents who would always touch live poultry declined considerably from 50.2% in the first survey to 20.6% in the second survey. In the rural surveys, around half of the subjects reported raising backyard poultry in the past year in the first survey, and this increased to 83.2% in the second survey. Around 70%-80% urban subjects in both surveys reported buying less live poultry since H7N9 cases were detected in China. During the second survey, 58.5% of rural subjects reported that they changed live poultry purchase behavior since the H7N9 virus reemerged in winter 2013-14. One third of urban subjects supported the permanent closure of LPMs in the first and second surveys while only 11% of rural subjects supported LPM closure in the second survey. Urban subjects showed a higher general anxiety and more worry about H7N9 in the second than the first survey while rural subjects had slightly lower general anxiety score (1.74 vs 1.86) but greater worry about H7N9 (5.71 vs 4.20) in the second survey ( Table 1 ). The proportion of urban subjects who perceived a higher absolute susceptibility to H7N9 (2.6%) and higher relative susceptibility (0.7%) in the first survey is lower than that reported in the second survey, 4.3% and 3.8% for absolute and relative susceptibility, respectively. In the rural area, few subjects perceived higher absolute and relative susceptibility to H7N9 in the first survey while a considerably increased proportion of subjects perceiving higher absolute (16.3%) and relative (10.4%) susceptibility was observed in the second survey. In general, both urban and rural subjects had a higher ILI symptom-induced worry against H7N9 in the second than the first survey. We examined factors affecting poultry purchase behaviors and support of LPM closure ( Table 2) . We found that married subjects and those having received higher level of education were likely to have lower exposure to live poultry after adjusting for other confounding factors. Touching poultry during purchase in LPMs also declined in the second survey (odds ratio (OR): 0.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2, 0.6), and those worrying more about H7N9 were likely to touch less. Female sex, older age, and those having higher level of worry, perceiving higher severity or knowing that H7N9 can be transmitted by contact were associated with changes in poultry purchase behaviors (Table 2) , while support for the permanent closure of LPMs was only associated with female sex, higher level of worry towards H7N9 and ILIinduced worry, and marginally associated with the perceived effectiveness of H7N9 control by the government. In rural respondents, we examined factors affecting backyard poultry, support for LPM closure and changes in purchasing behaviors (S2 Table) . We found that respondents were more likely to support closure of LPMs if they were female, had greater worry about H7N9, higher perceived susceptibility, greater ILI symptom-induced worry, or lower perceived severity of H7N9 relative to H5N1. Rural respondents were more likely to report a change in their purchasing behavior if they were more educated, had greater ILI symptom-induced worry, perceived greater severity compared to seasonal influenza or H5N1, knowing that H7N9 can be transmitted by contact, or perceived less effectiveness of H7N9 control by the government.
