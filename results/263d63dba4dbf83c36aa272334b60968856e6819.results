In the DID regression analysis, Ansan Danwon showed a significantly greater increase in the prescription rate of antidepressants compared to Cheonan city following the Sewol Ferry disaster (difference of 5.6%, P=0.003; Table 2 and Fig. 2) . Ansan Danwon showed a non-significant trend of a greater increase in the prescription rate of sedative/hypnotics compared to Cheonan city after the disaster (difference of 6.9%, P=0.086). Finally, there was no significant difference in changes in the prescription rates of anxiolytics between Ansan Danwon and Cheonan city after the disaster (P > 0.1). In the total population combining residents of Ansan Danwon and Cheonan city, the prescription rate of antidepressants significantly increased between before and after the disaster (difference of 7.8%, P < 0.0001), while the prescription rate of anxiolytics significantly decreased (difference of 11.1%, P < 0.0001; Table 2 ). The prescription rate of sedatives/hypnotics did not change between before and after the disaster (P > 0.1). Across the whole period from January 2013 to June 2016, the prescription rate of antidepressants was not significantly different between Ansan Danwon and Cheonan city (P > 0.1); however, the prescription rates of anxiolytics and sedatives/hypnotics were significantly higher in Ansan Danwon compared to Cheonan city (anxiolytics: difference of 39.3%, P < 0.0001; sedatives/hypnotics: difference of 11.7%, P=0.001; Table 2 ). In a secondary analysis, we explored changes in the prescription rates of antipsychotics in Ansan Danwon and Cheonan city following the disaster using the same statistical methods as those in the main analysis of antidepressant prescriptions. We found that Ansan Danwon had a significantly greater increase in the prescription rate of antipsychotics compared to the control community following the disaster (difference of 11.5%, P < 0.0001; Supplemental Table 1 ), supporting the results of our main analysis. We also investigated the short-term effects of the disaster on changes in the prescription rates of psychotropic medications in Ansan Danwon compared to a control community. In this analysis, we examined changes in psychotropic medication prescriptions between January 2013 and June 2014 (3 months after the disaster) using the same statistical methods as those in the main analysis. We observed no significant difference between Ansan Danwon and Cheonan city with regard to changes in the prescription rates of antidepressants, anxiolytics, sedative/hypnotics, or antipsychotics after the disaster (all P > 0.05, Supplemental Table 2 ).
