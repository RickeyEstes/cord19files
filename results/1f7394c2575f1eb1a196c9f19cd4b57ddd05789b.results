Measurement of surveillance: the q2 coefficient. We propose a quantitative measure of pathogen surveillance that reflects both the evolutionary rate and the biodiversity of a given population. For each host and subtype, sequences were first temporally ordered from the oldest sequence to the newest. For each sequence, we identified the sequence from the past with the highest homology and recorded its genetic distance, such that for N sequences, we compiled a vector of N distances. We defined the surveillance measurement q2 coefficient, a measurement between 0 and 1, as the proportion of sequences within genetic distance R of the most closely related ancestor. Given a viral evolutionary rate of substitutions per site per year, R ϭ t ϫ is thus the expected proportion of mutations that have accumulated over the span of t years. In this report, we examine short time periods on the order of a decade and do not expect the true genetic distance to diverge greatly from the Hamming distance. However, we calculate the q2 coefficient by using a number of distance methods, including Hamming distance, Jukes-Cantor, Kimura, Tamura, Tajima-Nei, Hasegawa, and Nei-Tamura, and find little significant change (see Results). If the surveillance of a pathogen in a given time and place is sufficient, we would therefore expect a maximal number of viral isolates to have a closest ancestor in the sequence database with a sequence identity of greater than 1 Ϫ R. For the q coefficient, we chose to use t ϭ 2 years since antigenic variant strains of influenza virus emerge and become predominant over a period of roughly 2 to 5 years (23); however, any value of t can be used. One consideration is that substitution rates can vary over time and across different lineages. To incorporate such variability into our calculation of the q2 coefficient, we used the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval of the evolutionary rate collected from the literature (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) (24) (25) (26) . A major motivation behind use of the q2 coefficient is the ability to evaluate the surveillance of different strains, hosts, and geographic regions. Sampling during variable windows of time, however, can compromise an appropriate comparison. For example, a high q2 coefficient derived from a local weeklong outbreak should not be extrapolated to surveillance during an entire season. For any comparisons of surveillance over a span of years, we therefore exclude from analysis any groups not sampled for more than a month. Influenza virus surveillance. Complete coding sequences of hemagglutinin (HA), the major antigenic segment of influenza virus, were collected from the NCBI (National Center for Biotech-nology Information) and GISAID databases and multiply aligned. To compare the levels of surveillance of different strains, we separately considered sequences for human (H3N2, seasonal H1N1 pre-2009, SOIV H1N1 post-2009, and H5N1), avian (H5N1 and non-H5N1), and swine H1N1 influenza viruses. Figure 1A and B depict the absolute number of sequences isolated across time as a first measure of surveillance. However, we wanted a measure of surveillance that would take into account the evolutionary rate of the virus, as well as the biodiversity of the viral pool. Calculation of Shannon's entropy in Fig. 1C is an effective measure of genetic diversity but, by itself, is no measure of surveillance. Toward a measure that synthesizes both the absolute number of isolates and the evolutionary rate, we calculated the q2 coefficient as a function of time for each influenza virus strain in Fig. 1D as a representation of surveillance history. We also tabulated their final q2 coefficients (see Tables S2 and S3 in the supplemental material) and mapped these values among WHO transmission zones (27) in Fig. 2 (and Fig. S2 in the supplemental material) to denote the present state of surveillance around the world. We showed that our q2 coefficient calculations did not drastically change for different genetic distances (Ͻ0.035 difference in the q2 coefficient). Analysis of each strain reflects a different state of geographic and host surveillance. Overall, surveillance of human seasonal strains was high; the q2 coefficient values of both human seasonal H3N2 and seasonal H1N1 viruses, which had been sampled and sequenced long before 2003, approached 1 from 2003 to the present (Fig. 1D ). Clustering of sequences by transmission zone began to uncover weakness in the surveillance of seasonal H3N2, particularly in central Asia (see Fig. S1A and S2A in the supplemental material). In addition to central Asia, several parts of Europe, western Asia, and especially central Africa, yielded lower q2 coefficients of seasonal H1N1 (see Fig. S1B and S2B in the supplemental material). As a testament to the global response to the pandemic, human SOIV H1N1 shot up to a q2 coefficient of 1 shortly after its arrival in March 2009 in all transmission zones except central and southern Africa and central Asia ( Fig. 1D ; see Fig. S1C and S2C in the supplemental material). In contrast, despite a moderate increase in the number of sequences following H1N1pdm's arrival (Fig. 1B) , the q2 coefficient of classical H1N1 swine isolates has lagged much further behind (Fig. 1D) and is consistently high only in the eastern Asian (q2 coefficient ϭ 0.753, Hamming distance) and North American (q2 coefficient ϭ 0.877, Hamming distance) transmission zones ( Fig. 2A ; see Fig. S1D in the supplemental material). These findings suggest that surveillance of pigs is still not enough to capture the high biodiversity of swine flu, as indicated by entropy (Fig. 1C) . Analysis of H5N1 influenza virus describes the effects of implementing international sequencing initiatives like GISAID. Immediately following the second outbreak of HPAI virus among humans in 2003, the q2 coefficient of H5N1 in both human and avian hosts rose to approximately 0.7 to 0.85. With the establishment of GISAID in 2006, both human and avian H5N1 influenza virus q2 coefficients increased further to high levels of around 0.9, affirming the effectiveness of the global consortium. Beyond 2007, however, the surveillance of human H5N1 influenza virus has waned compared to that of avian H5N1 influenza virus (Fig. 1D ). This discrepancy is most likely due to the fact that human HPAI cases represent a subsampling of avian H5N1 influenza virus genotypes, as reflected by the slight drop in human H5N1 entropy compared to that in birds (Fig. 1C) . Within H5N1, there is biased sampling in different transmission zones. Following particularly large outbreaks, H5N1 human surveillance is high, with q2 coefficients of roughly 0.9 in northern Africa and eastern and southeastern Asia. Over time, the q2 coefficient has decreased in eastern and southeastern Asia most likely because of a decline in the number of sporadic introductions into the local human populations compared to that in northern Africa, specifically Egypt (see Fig. S1E and S2D in the supplemental material). H5N1 avian influenza virus surveillance is high in northern and western Africa; eastern, southeastern, and southern Asia; and eastern, southwestern, and northern Europe. On the other hand, the q2 coefficient indicates less avian H5N1 influenza virus surveillance in North America. In the United States, for example, only until 2006 were the reporting and tracking of H5 in birds mandated by the USDA (28) . The smaller push for reporting stems from the low pathogenicity displayed by North American avian H5N1 influenza virus strains, which have antigenic and genetic differences from the Asian HPAI virus lineage (see Fig. S1F and S2E in the supplemental material) (29) . These results indicate that H5N1 influenza virus surveillance of avian hosts is much more complete than H1N1 surveillance of swine. However, potential zoonotic transmission from other avian strains is possible, as well. Performance of the same analysis of non-H5N1 avian influenza virus strains yielded a low q2 coefficient beginning at 0.5 in 2003 and plateauing at a level just below 0.7 in spite of GISAID (Fig. 1D ) and the resulting increase in sequenced isolates (Fig. 1B) . This finding potentially reflects the extremely high genetic diversity of influenza A virus in its natural reservoir (Fig. 1C ) that is not fully captured by current surveillance systems. Transmission zone analysis of non-H5N1 avian influenza virus strains indicates that non-H5N1 surveillance is concentrated in southwestern Europe, the Central American-Caribbean region, North America, northern Africa, and eastern and southeastern Asia ( Fig. 2B ; see Fig. S1G in the supplemental material). Calculation of the q2 coefficient for other complete coding segments of influenza virus was also performed. Since observed differences in sequences should reflect the evolutionary rates of each segment, any differences in the q2 coefficient should reflect differences in sampling alone. For H3N2, H1N1pdm, and seasonal H1N1, the q2 coefficient exhibited little change among different segments (differences of Ͻ0.02) and moderate change for other strains. The largest change in the q2 coefficient was 0.186 between swine H1N1 HA and PB2. Despite such differences between segments, results showed that generally surveillance of human H3N2, H1N1pdm, and seasonal H1N1 across all segments surpassed that of human H5N1, avian H5N1, swine H1N1, and non-H5N1 avian influenza viruses (see Tables S2 and S3 in the  supplemental material) . Dengue and West Nile virus surveillance. As a proof of concept, we have also shown that the q2 coefficient can be used to monitor surveillance efforts for other RNA viruses, such as dengue virus and West Nile virus. Here, we focus on the env gene of these viruses, as it encodes the longest of the structural proteins, which is prevalently sequenced for subtyping and has the bestdocumented evolutionary rates of all flavivirus proteins (25, 26, 30, 31) . Calculation of the q2 coefficients of dengue virus subtypes 1, 2, and 3 depicts poor surveillance in general ( Fig. 3 ; see Fig. S3 and Table S4 in the supplemental material). These sampling gaps may reflect the current limited funding and staff in many tropical countries around the world (32) . The incorporation of other genetic distances besides Hamming distance produced a Ͻ0.118 change in the q2 coefficient of dengue virus. The q2 coefficient of West Nile virus in the United States, on the other hand, was higher in the first few years after its introduction into the United States (see Fig. S4 and Table S5 in the supplemental material). However, despite the implementation of early warning systems for West Nile virus, by sampling dead birds (33) and mosquito populations (34), the q2 coefficient beyond 2003 dropped over time, even with the addition of multiple isolates within a short period of time. This decline in the q2 coefficient coincided with a rapid population growth of West Nile virus in the United States during 2002 and 2003 spurred by the establishment of the WN02 strain marked by a V159A mutation in its E protein (35) . This analysis suggests that current surveillance is being outpaced by the growing diversity of the virus in the New World. Other genetic distances besides the Hamming distance produced a Ͻ0.094 change in the q2 coefficient of West Nile virus. Comparison to phylogenetic methods. One may wonder if other alternative methods that account for pathogen evolution may suffice to characterize the genetic surveillance of a pathogen. Phylogenetics has been used in many studies to characterize pathogen surveillance qualitatively without producing a quantitative measure of sampling completeness (36) . A possible phylogenetic analogue to the q2 coefficient might entail the reconstruction of a tree based on available sequences and measurement of the distribution of branch lengths. The true distance between two isolates, A and B, is represented by the sum of their patristic distances, d A and d B , which are the branch lengths from each respective sequence to their common ancestral node. Sequences are time ordered, however, and if we assume an approximate molecular clock, then d A Ͻ d B given that sequence A occurs before sequence B. An estimate of distance is then the larger patristic distance. A parallel to our q2 coefficient would predict high surveillance to correspond to a maximal number (#) of patristic distances d to their closest ancestor in the past less than 2 years as follows: Phylogenies can be divided into those that are distance based and those that are character based. Since the q2 coefficient readily incorporates different genetic distance methods, it is equivalent to any p2 coefficient calculated from distance-based trees. On the other hand, character-based trees, including maximumlikelihood and Bayesian inference methods, incorporate site heterogeneity by considering one character (a site in the alignment) at a time to reconstruct a tree (37); moreover, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods like BEAST (38) can incorporate relaxed clock rates. The q2 coefficient does not take into account either site or clock rate heterogeneity. To determine the impact of site and clock rate heterogeneity in quantifying surveillance completeness, we calculated the p2 coefficient of the human H5N1 HA data set of 158 sequences by using BEAST (see Materials and Methods). We accounted for site heterogeneity by using the gamma model (39) and reconstructed trees under both strict and relaxed molecular clocks. We calculated the p2 coefficients to be 0.848 (0.740 to 0.917) and 0.860 (0.721 to 0.911) for the strict and relaxed clocks, respectively. Given our q2 coefficient of 0.821 (0.795 to 0.848) for human H5N1 HA, we concluded that incorporating site heterogeneity and a relaxed molecular clock did not make a significant difference. While these phylogenetic techniques can examine the fit of a number of evolutionary models, they suffer from problems of robustness. For example, tree topology can be highly unstable; the addition or deletion of a single sequence can radically restructure the tree. Moreover, different methods of phylogenetic inference, such as maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference, can lead to variable results, rendering interpretation of surveillance complicated. Finally, computation time, particularly for BEAST, can be very expensive; for data sets of more than 1,000 sequences, several weeks may be needed for the MCMC to converge to a stable tree solution. In our analysis of 158 human H5N1 HA sequences, p2 coefficients needed days of computation to complete, whereas q2 coefficient analysis was finished in a matter of seconds. Comparison to clustering methods. Another possible surveillance measurement characterizes the cluster structure of isolates. In an ideal situation, a well-sampled population of sequences separated by genetic distance would be represented by points densely and homogeneously spread across a continuum. Therefore, clustering techniques such as hierarchical, k-means, or expectationmaximization clustering can be used to ascertain how poorly sampled a pathogen is on the basis of the number of clusters in a data set. Bar coding is an alternative strategy based on the field of per-sistent homology that identifies topologically invariant clusters in cloud data; in particular, it calculates the b 0 Betti number, the number of connected components in a set of simplicial complexes constructed from sequences at different filtration Hamming distances (see Materials and Methods) (40) . A lower b 0 would indicate better sampling. As a comparison to the q2 coefficient, we applied bar coding to determine the b 0 values of different influenza virus strains at filtration Hamming distances ranging from 0 to 200 (Fig. 4A) . This threshold is analogous to the R threshold of the q2 coefficient: 2 years of influenza virus evolution equivalent to 2 ϫ (5 ϫ 10 Ϫ3 ) ϭ 1% genetic distance. We therefore considered b 0 at a Hamming distance of 1% of the length of HA, or roughly 17 nucleotides, to be appropriate for comparison to the q2 coefficient (Fig. 4B) . For the most part, the q2 coefficient and b 0 are inversely correlated. For example, the low b 0 and high q2 coefficient of human H3N2, seasonal H1N1, and H1N1pdm indicate good surveillance. Non-H5N1 avian influenza virus has an extremely high b 0 and a low q2 coefficient. It should be noted that the non-H5N1 avian influenza virus data set contains 15 different HA subtypes, as opposed to all of the other single-subtype HA data sets considered. Thus, b 0 may need to be normalized by the expected number of HA subtypes. Nevertheless, b 0 for non-H5N1 avian influenza virus remains high even with normalization. However, as with p2, calculation of b 0 demands substantial computing power and time on the order of hours. Comparison to diversity metrics. Other alternative methods of gauging sampling bias may exist. For instance, there are many diversity metrics in ecology, including Chao's estimate of asymptotic species richness (41) , and in information theory, techniques like Shannon's entropy, which was applied in Fig. 1C . In particular, it is well known that the empirical Shannon entropy of a sample underestimates the entropy of the true distribution. Bootstrapping techniques can be used to estimate the bias produced by a low number of sequences. This method is attractive for its ability to measure surveillance by assaying the diversity of a pathogen directly. However, like the phylogenetic and bar coding methods considered, implementation for a large number of trials is substantially more difficult, computationally expensive, and time-consuming.
