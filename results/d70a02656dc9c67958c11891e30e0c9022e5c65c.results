Comparison of the replication of wt JHMV and S 1 deletion variants in primary glial cultures from SJL /J and CD. 1 mice Growth of wt JHMV and the AT11f cord variant was assessed on primary glial cultures derived from resistant SJL/J or susceptible CD .1 mice . Our wt JHMV was originally obtained from the ATCC and shown to contain no deletions in either S or HE when propagated under the culture conditions we employed ." The AT11 f cord variant of JHMV18 has been shown to possess a 441 nucleotide deletion in the middle third of the S1 portion of S in addition to a 738 nucleotide deletion in the coding region of HE . 17 This variant was shown to be more fusogenic and capable of replicating to higher titers in G26-24 oligodendroglioma cells than wt JHMV . the inoculum consisted of concentrated, extracellularly released virus, 10 a 100-fold difference in growth between wt and variant virus was observed (Table 1) . This difference was usually only 10-fold when the inoculum consisted of membraneassociated virus preparations derived from disrupted cells as described in Materials and methods (Table 2 ) . In spite of the enhanced replication observed with variant virus, production was still 1-2 orders of magnitude less in SJL/J than in CD .1 glial cultures ( Table 1 ) . The foci of fusion observed in SJL/J cultures inoculated with wt JHMV were significantly smaller than those produced in AT11f cord infections at equivalent time points post-inoculation (p .i .) . Polykaryons evident at 3 days p .i . in AT11f cord infected cultures contained 697±245 (SD) nuclei versus 142±118 nuclei in those induced by wt JHMV (P < 0 .001, t-test) ( Fig . 1 A and B) . The syncytia contained predominantly GFAP + astrocytes while among the overlying oligodendrocytes there was usually some evidence of lysis ( Fig . 1 C, D, E and F) . More rapid replication in CD .1 cells was accompanied by accelerated and more extensive syncytia formation, culminating in massive cell killing by 3 days p .i . (Table 1 ) . By contrast, even at 10 day p .i . the cytopathic effect due to AT11f cord virus involved no more than 30-40% of the area occupied by SJL/J glial cultures . In order to determine which deletions in the AT11f cord variant were responsible for the enhanced efficiency of replication in SJL/J glial cultures, we compared growth of AT11f cord, V5A13 (88), AT11f brain and wt JHMV viruses . V5A13 (88) which was selected in vitro from wt MHV-4 infected SAC--cells on the basis of resistance to neutralization with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5A13 .5, 13 possesses a 447 nucleotide deletion in the S coding region 19 that overlaps that present within AT11f cord (Fig .  2 ) . In addition, MHV-4 apparently does not express detectable levels of HE (M . Buchmeier, pers . comm .) . The AT11f brain variant was an independent isolate from the same animal that the AT11f cord virus was derived" and possesses the identical deletion in the HE gene as AT11 f cord but has no deletion within S . 17 AT11 f brain variant was therefore used as a control to assess the defect in HE expression observed in both AT11f cord and V5A13 (88) . It is evident from the data in Table 2 , that AT11f cord and V5A1 3 (88) variants grew to 10-fold higher titers than both AT1 1 f brain virus and wt JHMV . In some experiments however, AT11f brain virus grew about twice as efficiently as wt JHMV (data not shown) . These results indicated that the enhanced growth of the AT11f cord variant could most likely be attributed to the alteration associated with the S coding region . Nevertheless, the coincidental defect involving the HE envelope glycoprotein may also play a contributory role . Interestingly, infection of SJL/J glial cells never progressed to the point where total destruction of the culture was observed . In fact, a gradual but progressive decrease in titer was observed with all viral strains assayed as a function of time p .i . When viral gene expression of wt JHM, AT11f brain and AT11f cord virus infected SJL/J glial cultures was assayed at 24 and 48 h p .i ., the magnitude of expression of viral RNA paralleled the differences observed in progeny virus release and fusogenic potential (Fig . 3 ) . Thus, virus-specific RNA synthesis of All if cord virus was greater than AT1 1 f brain virus, which in turn was greater than wt J H MV . These data, however, do not enable us to distinguish with certainty which step(s) in the interaction between virus and host is responsible for the advantage observed with the S deletion variant . Comparison of replication efficiency and the disease process in resistant SJL/J and susceptible CD . 1 mice inoculated with wt JHMV and variant AT 11 f cord virus In view of the enhanced replication obtained by AT11f cord virus in primary glial cultures, we next determined whether the CNS disease process was also affected . SJL/J mice were inoculated i .c . with varying doses of either wt JHMV or AT11f cord variant at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 11 weeks of age . Comparison was made with age-matched, susceptible CD .1 mice as controls . The data, summarized in Table 3 , demonstrate that in the case of SJL/J mice an age-related resistance developed . Thus, at 1 and 2 weeks of age, SJL/J sucklings were completely susceptible and by 6 weeks uniformly resistant to both viruses . Some differences were evident between the wt and variant at 4-5 weeks of age when SJL/J mice demonstrated full resistance to wt JHMV and partial resistance to AT1 1 f cord variant . This age dependent development of resistance, although similar to that previously reported, 6 differs with respect to the exact ages at which the shift from susceptibility to resistance was observed . However, our data were virtually in complete agreement with those reported by another group' where encephalitis was only observed in 1-week-old SJL/J animals following intranasal inoculation with JHMV . As anticipated, CD .1 mice remained fully susceptible at all ages tested and their mean time to death ranged from 1 .5-5 .3 days p .i ., depending on the age at inoculation, size of inoculum and virus used . Generally, AT11f cord virus produced acute encephalitis in CD .1 mice in half the time required by wt JHMV at equivalent doses . The rapidity of the disease process in CD .1 mice corresponded with the efficiency of virus replication in primary glial cultures (Table 1) . Interestingly, it has been previously reported 13 that S deletion variants of MHV-4 were neuroattenuated in BALB/c mice based on increased LD 50 s and the propensity to induce chronic, demyelinating, rather than acute, encephalitic, disease . This, however, has not been our experience with CD .1 mice and the doses of inoculum we have employed . Since even the more efficent S deletion variants of JHMV replicated in SJL/J glial cultures to titers that were at least one order of magnitude lower than those observed with CD .1 cells, we hypothesized that some additional factor such as the host immune response may be involved in controlling the acuity of a potentially slow, progressive CNS disease process . The role of the host cellular immune response was therefore studied by administration of the immunosuppressant Cyclosporin A (C5A) . As Table 4 illustrates, CsA treatment of animals following i .c . inoculation with either Table 4 Effect of cyclosporin A on disease and mortality caused by wt-JHMV and AT11f cord virus in SJL/J mice 'Cumulative data were obtained following i .c . inoculation at the times and virus concentrations indicated . Animals were treated with 25 mg/kg body weight CsA beginning either the day before or the day of inoculation with virus and continued for an additional 5-10 days following inoculation . ND = Not done. Note that uninoculated control mice from both 4 and 11 week old age groups showed no observable toxic effects to cyclosporin administration (6 consecutive days for 4 week old animals and 10 consecutive days for 11 week old animals) . wt JHMV or AT11f cord variant led to a significant breakthrough of resistance in the 4-week-old age group . Clinical signs consisted of lethargy and piloerection which progressed to irritability and seizures . The mean days to advanced disease was 8 .1 +1 .8 and 8 .0±2 .6 days p .i . for wt and variant viruses, respectively . This was longer than the development of advanced disease observed for age-matched CD .1 mice or 1 -and 2-week-old SJL/J mice, the latter of which succumbed to advanced disease in half this time . In the 5-week-old age group, the AT11 f cord variant produced a significantly higher incidence of encephalitis as compared with wt JHMV inoculants (P=0 .035, Fisher's exact test) . Again, an age-related shift in resistance was observed in spite of CsA treatment, though not as pronounced as that observed in the non-CsA-treated group . Consistent with the observed growth of wt and variant virus in tissue culture, AT11f cord virus appeared to demonstrate a growth advantage over wt J H MV in vivo as well (Table 5 ) . Histopathology included perivascular cuffing and mononuclear cell infiltration within the forebrain, loss of neurons within Ammon's horn of the hippocampus and vacuolation of the neuropil within the midbrain (Fig . 4) . Viral antigen was localized primarily to cells possessing glial morphology, as well as to fiber tracts surrounding the hippocampal formation (Fig . 4) . Interestingly, those animals not developing acute encephalitis did not subsequently go on to develop chronic demyelinating disease as assessed both clinically and histologically during the 60 day period following inoculation . Infectious virus was never recovered from the livers of mice that had developed signs of clinical disease . This, combined with the preceding data, strongly suggests that these animals were succumbing to an encephalitic disease .
