CHIKV fidelity variant phenotypes are supported in vitro by growth curves and bacterial cloning. The CHIKV fidelity variants (Fig. 1A ) used for this study were generated and characterized previously (20, 21, 35) . We first sought to confirm the established phenotypes in both BHK-21 and C6/36 cells. Both high-fidelity variants replicated to higher titers than the WT (P Ͻ 0.0001 by repeated-measures analysis of variance [ANOVA]), with the greatest differences observed 6 (P Ͻ 0.001 by Dunnett's post hoc test) and 12 (P Ͻ 0.01) h postinfection (hpi) ( Fig. 1B and C) . In both cell types, the specific infectivities (ratio of genome equivalents to PFU) (Fig. 1D) were lower for both high-fidelity variants and higher for LoFi than for the WT (P Ͻ 0.01 by Tukey's post hoc test). Mutation frequencies of each fidelity-variant virus and WT were quantified by bacterial cloning and Sanger sequencing, similar to methods originally used to establish these CHIKV mutants as fidelity variants. In BHK-21 cells, HiFi and DM HiFi CHIKV populations had 10% and 40% lower mutation frequencies, respectively, than the WT, and the LoFi CHIKV population had a 40% higher mutation frequency than the WT (Fig.  1E ). Similar relationships were observed in C6/36 cells, except for the DM HiFi mutant. Because this was unexpected, we measured the mutation frequencies of DM HiFi and the WT in C6/36 cells in 3 additional biological replicates, comprising approximately an additional 168,000 nucleotides (nt) sequenced. Each of the additional analyses showed that DM HiFi generated a lower mutation frequency than parallel WT replicates. A Grubbs' outlier test determined the initial elevated DM HiFi mutation frequency value was an outlier (P Ͻ 0.05), although no methodological differences across replicates explain the outlier. Given that the fidelity genotypes and phenotypes measured here were similar to those previously observed, we proceeded with an infection experiment in adult mice. High-fidelity, but not low-fidelity, CHIKV elicits more severe foot swelling than WT CHIKV. Adult C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with 10 3 PFU WT or fidelity-variant CHIKV in the rear footpads to test effects of CHIKV fidelity on clinical disease, as determined by rear foot swelling (36, (38) (39) (40) . Mice infected with LoFi CHIKV exhibited significantly less foot swelling than mice infected with the WT ( Fig. 2A) (P Ͻ 0.05 by one-way ANOVA). Conversely, mice infected with either HiFi or DM HiFi exhibited more severe early footpad swelling than the WT at 3 and 4 days postinfection (dpi) (P Ͻ 0.01 by one-way ANOVA). CHIKV HiFi-infected mice also exhibited greater peak disease severity than those infected with the WT 7 dpi (P ϭ 0.003 by one-way ANOVA). We next evaluated the relationship between clinical disease and viremia (Fig. 2B ). Mean viremia titers were significantly reduced in LoFi-infected mice 1 and 3 dpi relative to the WT (P Ͻ 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA). Lower viremia titers were also observed for DM HiFi-infected mice 1 dpi (P Ͻ 0.001 by one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 2B) , despite elevated clinical disease at later time points. Mean viremias 5 and 9 dpi were not different across groups. These results demonstrate that the high-and low-fidelity mutations elicit more and less severe arthritic disease in adult mice, respectively, and the magnitude of peak CHIKV viremia correlates with disease severity. Tissue CHIKV levels are attenuated in LoFi-but not HiFi-infected adult mice. Infectious CHIKV titers and CHIKV RNA levels in primary target tissues, muscle and ankle, and secondary tissues, brain and liver, were measured to determine whether clinical disease severity was associated with differential viral loads. Similar to viremia kinetics, LoFi CHIKV RNA and infectious virus titers in brain, liver, and muscle were significantly reduced relative to those of the WT 3 dpi (Fig. 3 ) (P Ͻ 0.05 by two-way ANOVA). In contrast, HiFi and DM HiFi CHIKV RNA and infectious virus levels were not different from that of the WT in any tissue (P Ͼ 0.05 by two-way ANOVA). At 9 dpi, low titers (Ͻ10 3 PFU/g) were detected in at least one mouse ankle for all variants, with significantly lower titers in DM HiFi-infected mice than WT-infected mice (P ϭ 0.04 by two-way ANOVA). These results indicate that the low-fidelity mutation reduces CHIKV RNA and infectious virus levels in mice but that the high-fidelity mutations do not. Intrahost CHIKV mutant spectra vary by individual mouse and tissue. CHIKV populations from inocula and ankles of 3 mice per treatment group were wholegenome sequenced using Illumina NGS, while sequencing of calf muscle isolates was FIG 2 High-fidelity CHIKV produces more severe clinical disease than the WT in adult mice. Adult female C57BL/6J mice were bilaterally inoculated subcutaneously in the rear footpads with 10 3 PFU of either WT CHIKV, HiFi CHIKV, DM HiFi CHIKV, LoFi CHIKV, or virus-free cell culture supernatant (mock). (A) Bilateral foot swelling was measured as percent increase in dorsoplantar diameter of hind feet from day 0 preinoculation. Numbers of feet per group were the following: for CHIKV cohorts 1 to 3 dpi, n ϭ 32; 4 to 9 dpi, n ϭ 20; 10 to 11 dpi, n ϭ 8; for the mock-inoculated group, 1 to 3 dpi, n ϭ 16; 4 to 9 dpi, n ϭ 10; 10 to 11 dpi, n ϭ 4. (B) Adult mouse viremia titers were determined by qRT-PCR of CHIKV RNA in whole blood. Each symbol represents an individual mouse. LOD is the limit of detection. Error bars represent standard deviations. P values for both graphs were calculated by one-way ANOVA. a, P Ͻ 0.05; b, P Ͻ 0.01; c, P Ͻ 0.001; d, P Ͻ 0.0001; all other cases, P Ͼ 0.05. limited to the whole genome for 1 mouse and partial genome for the remaining 2 mice per group. Sequencing from LoFi-infected muscle was not possible due to poor PCR amplification. For all isolates, the mean depth of coverage postprocessing ranged from 1,126 to 2,622 (Table 1 ). Comparing mutant spectra of CHIKV isolates from ankles by specific nucleotide substitution frequencies, the only significant differences from the WT were greater frequencies of AϾC and GϾU substitutions in LoFi CHIKV populations (P Ͻ 0.01 and P Ͻ 0.0001, respectively, by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test) (see Fig. 5B ). Shared SNPs detected in more than one mouse at Ͼ1% frequency were identified to characterize tissue-and variant-specific mutations ( Table 2 ). Four trends in the tissue distribution of shared SNPs were observed: (i) SNPs present in inocula and in both ankle and muscle, (ii) SNPs present in inocula and the ankle but not muscle, (iii) SNPs detected in only the ankle or muscle, and (iv) SNPs detected in both the ankle and muscle (Fig. 4) . None of the shared SNPs were consensus changes (Ͼ50% frequency). The only SNP restricted to a single CHIKV variant was a revertant SNP at nsP4 483, where the LoFi mutant reverted to WT. By 3 dpi in the ankles of LoFi-infected mice, nsP4 483G mutated to 93% G483C in one mouse, 48% G483C and 43% G483V in the second mouse, and 92% G483C and 6% G483V in the third mouse. Valine at nsP4 483 has been previously reported to confer WT fidelity (20) . In addition to the consensus changes at nsP4 483, four other consensus changes arose de novo in ankles of LoFi-infected mice, but none were detected in any other group of mice. The absence of shared SNPs or consensus changes in HiFi-and DM HiFi-infected tissues suggests that the differences observed in clinical disease and population diversity are unlikely to be the result of particular secondary or compensatory mutations. The four observed distribution patterns show that CHIKV populations are tissue dependent and that SNPs present in inocula can sometimes persist in different tissues. High-and low-fidelity CHIKV diversify more than the wild type in adult mice. In addition to comparing mutant spectra, we also compared overall population diversity by number of SNPs (Fig. 5A ) and by two proportional diversity metrics, Shannon entropy ( Fig. 5C ) and root mean square deviations (RMSD) (Fig. 5D) . As a metric of virus population genetic variance, RMSD is skewed by high-frequency variants and therefore is useful for comparing high-frequency variants between groups. In contrast, Shannon entropy is maximized at a variant frequency of 0.5 and less biased by variant frequency, so it is better for comparing low-frequency variants between groups. More highfrequency (Ͼ5%) SNPs were detected in ankles of HiFi-, DM HiFi-, and LoFi-infected mice, although the differences were not statistically significant (P Ͼ 0.05 by chi-squared test) (Fig. 5A ). Unexpectedly, HiFi and DM HiFi populations in ankles and muscles were comparably or more diverse than WT populations. In ankles, the diversities of HiFi and DM HiFi populations were significantly elevated relative to that of the WT by Shannon entropy (P Ͻ 0.05 by one-way ANOVA) ( Fig. 5C ) but not RMSD (P Ͼ 0.05 by one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 5D ). Diversity of LoFi populations was significantly higher than that of the WT by RMSD (P Ͻ 0.001 by one-way ANOVA) ( Fig. 5C ) but not Shannon entropy (P Ͼ 0.05 by one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 5D ). In muscle, no differences in population diversities were observed between HiFi and DM HiFi populations relative to the WT by Shannon entropy or RMSD (P Ͼ 0.05 by one-way ANOVA) ( Fig. 5C and D) . The pCHIK and pCHIK-PCR sequencing controls had no SNPs at more than 1% frequency (Fig. 5A ) and low Shannon entropy and RMSD values ( Fig. 5C and D) , indicating that falsepositive mutations derived from library preparation and NGS had minimal effects on the diversity metrics of CHIKV populations. These results show that relative in vitro diversity calculated from mutation frequencies by bacterial cloning and Sanger sequencing does not parallel relative CHIKV population diversities in adult mice, as measured by NGS, or that mutation frequencies detected by these methods change as a function of host environment. High-fidelity CHIKV populations diversify more than the WT, as measured by NGS after single and serial passage in vertebrate cells. Despite corroborating HiFi and DM HiFi as high fidelity in vitro by bacterial cloning, the unexpectedly expanded diversity of HiFi and DM HiFi populations in vivo warranted further investigation. NGS was applied to measure the diversity of CHIKV populations after a single 24-h passage in BHK cells, as was done for bacterial cloning. Mutation frequencies were calculated by NGS across the whole genome and across the same E1 region used for bacterial cloning. We found that the differences in mutation frequencies established by bacterial cloning were not paralleled by our NGS observations (Fig. 6 ). Differences in mutation frequencies measured by NGS between both high-fidelity variants and the WT were not statistically significant (P ϭ 0.48 by one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 6B ). Only small differences were observed between NGS whole-genome and partial E1 mutation frequencies. The discordance in mutation frequencies measured by bacterial cloning and NGS called into question the attribution of these variants as fidelity variants and prompted further examination of mutation frequencies after serial passage in cell culture. We reasoned that 5 serial passages on BHK-21 cells would amplify real differences in population mutation frequencies. Over serial passages, the viral titers did not vary significantly between passages or virus variants (P ϭ 0.95 by two-way ANOVA) (Fig. 7A ). The populations from the first passage (p1) and fifth passage (p5) were sequenced by NGS and compared (Fig. 7B to E). The mean depth of coverage for each sample ranged from 2,084 to 2,645 (Table 3) . Over five passages, WT CHIKV developed more lowfrequency SNPs, while HiFi and DM HiFi developed more high-frequency SNPs (Fig. 7B ). RMSDs at p5 were marginally elevated for HiFi and significantly elevated for DM HiFi (P ϭ 0.0003 by two-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test) (Fig. 7D ). In contrast, Shannon entropy was not significantly different across CHIKV variants at p1 or p5 (Fig.  7C ). The elevation in RMSD and accumulation of high-frequency SNPs in both highfidelity variants relative to WT CHIKV further indicate that HiFi and DM HiFi do not always produce less genetically diverse populations than WT CHIKV. Furthermore, there were no specific nucleotide substitutions in which HiFi and DM HiFi populations had significantly lower frequencies than the WT after p1 or p5 (by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test) (Fig. 8A ). After p1, the only significant difference from the WT was a greater GϾA frequency for DM HiFi (P Ͻ 0.05). After p5, HiFi populations exhibited greater frequencies of AϾG, GϾU, and UϾC substitutions (P Ͻ 0.05, P Ͻ 0.0001, and P Ͻ 0.01), and DM HiFi populations had greater frequencies of CϾA, CϾU, GϾA, GϾU, and UϾC substitutions (P Ͻ 0.0001, P Ͻ 0.01, P Ͻ 0.0001, P Ͻ 0.01, and P Ͻ 0.0001). For p5 populations of HiFi and DM HiFi, a trend of GCϾAU substitutions at a higher frequency than reciprocal AUϾGC substitutions was observed ( Fig. 8A and C). For both HiFi and DM HiFi, the GϾU/UϾG substitution ratios were significantly greater than those for the WT (P Ͻ 0.0001 and P ϭ 0.02, respectively, by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test) (Fig. 8C) , while the differences in GϾA/AϾG and CϾA/AϾC ratios were not statistically significant. To determine if the GCϾAU trend was genome wide, we evaluated the mutant spectra and GCϽϾAU ratios by frequency of mutated sites (Fig. 8B and D) . A mutated site was defined as any nucleotide position with evidence of a substitution regardless of frequency. By mutated site frequency, the observed GCϾAU trend is no longer evident (Fig. 8B) , and the GCϽϾAU ratios of p5 populations are similar between HiFi, DM HiFi, and the WT (P Ͼ 0.05 by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's post hoc test) (Fig. 8D) . These results indicate that the CHIKV fidelity variants in this study did not show differences in mutation bias after 5 serial BHK-21 cell passages. Fidelity mutant CHIKV impair serum neutralization of less diverse WT CHIKV in vitro. Since these high-fidelity mutations are being investigated as safety enhancers for CHIKV LAVs in our other projects, we tested the effect of CHIKV fidelity on neutralization of WT CHIKV populations of low and high relative population diversity. Sera from the four mice in each treatment group at 30 dpi were serially diluted and tested for neutralization of passage zero (p0) and p5 WT CHIKV by PRNT. Sera from WT-inoculated mice neutralized low-diversity p0 WT CHIKV inocula better than any of the fidelity-
