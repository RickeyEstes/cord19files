Effects ofintrade-al injection. Five out of seven assayed skin products induced polyarthritis in the DA rat ( Table 1 ). The incidence varied from 10 to 40%, and rats of both sexes were affected. Mean day of arthritis onset was between 13 and 24 days after injection. The arthritis often started symmetrically in the hind paws and later also affected the front paws. The severity of arthritis reached its maximum 2-3 weeks after injection and became less severe during the following weeks, without any detectable signs of ankylosis or functional disorders. Duration of the arthritis was from 5 to almost 9 weeks. Intradermal injection with skin creams with high viscosity or with the vaginal gel (Replens) did not induce any arthritis. However, development of ulcers was observed at the injection site of animals receiving Replens. A high incidence of arthritis was recorded in DA rats injected with the medicinal mineral oils Medicway and Kaydol (Table  1) . Six out of 10 DA rats developed arthritis after injection with Medicway. Kaydol induced very aggressive arthritis in 90% of the DA rats. Lewis rats injected with Kaydol in the same manner did not develop any arthritis. Animals treated with Natusan Baby Oil or Kaydol mineral oil exhibited similar clinical pictures of arthritis as the positive control group receiving FIA (Fig. 1) . Effects ofpercutaneous application. One of the products, Natusan Baby Oil, which was arthritogenic by intradermal injection, was also tested for its capacity to induce arthritis after repeated percutaneous (PC) application on abrased skin. By this route, the DA rats developed joint inflammations that were, in general, mild and transient and predominantly affected single joints in the forepaws. The mean day of onset of arthritis was 13 days after start of treatment, and the maximum arthritic score was 4. The duration of the arthritis was 4-6 days (Fig. 2) . Control rats did not develop any signs of arthritis. Skin irritation tests with Natusan Baby Oil gave no macroscopic changes of the skin, and microscopic evaluation performed on biopsies from Natusan-treated skin did not show any signs ofinflammation (data not shown). Effects oforal soundfeeding. One of the medicinal mineral oils, Kaydol, which is permitted as a food additive and which exhibited arthritogenicity in DA rats when injected intradermally, was also investigated for its potential arthritogenicity after oral sound feeding to DA rats. However, no arthritic reaction was detected in these animals during an observation period of7 months ( Table 2) . Effects of intravaginal application. Arthritogenicity was assesed by adminstration 12 Effects of silicone implants. Silicone implants or the silicone envelope did not cause any arthritis in DA rats. The animals were observed for a 6-month period ( Table  2) . Elevated fibrinogen levels were observed in silicone treated animals on days 6 and 17 after implantation of silicone; however, these levels had decreased to those of sham operated animals a month later. Histopathology. Histology of arthritic joints at days 21, 25, and 33 postinjection from animals injected ID with Natusan Baby Oil verified arthritic reactions with infiltration of mononuclear cells, synovitis, and marginal erosions (Fig. 3 ). Tendinitis and tendovaginitis were also evident (Fig. 4) . Histology of lymph nodes (Fig. 5 ) from the same animal showed an increased number of cells, diffuse germinal centres, and large round vesicles, probably disseminated oil droplets in the marginal zone (Fig. 6) . The spleen was cell rich and vesicles were not evident. Serological analysis. ANAs assayed by IIF of tissue sections were negative in DA rats treated with Natusan or Barnangen baby oils, Margaret Astor cream, Kaydol, or FCA/FIA by different treatment regimes (Table 3) . However, ANAs analyzed by HEp-2 cells showed positive Golgi or centromere antibodies in 3/10 DA rats administered Kaydol orally. In 4/11 silicone-implanted animals, positive Golgi antibodies could be detected. One sham operated rat also had Golgi antibodies. RF was positive in 5/10 DA rats orally treated with Kaydol, but was also positive in some animals treated intradermally with Barnangen Baby Oil or Margaret Astor skin cream. In one control rat, positive RF could be detected. CII antibodies were detected in 4/10 animals previously injected with Margaret Astor skin cream containing collagen, oils, and liposomes. One of the, CII-positive animals had arthritis.
