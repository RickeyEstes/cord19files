Study population. Thirty-two healthy, unselected term-born infants completed the study period of 1 year, with a weekly telephone interview to assess respiratory health and biweekly nasal swab sampling by parents. After exclusion of low-quality results for either virus or microbiota, a total of 559 nasal swabs were evaluated both for bacterial and virological analyses (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). This corresponds to a mean of 17.5 swabs (range, 11 to 24; standard deviation [SD], 3.3) per infant. For demographics and other risk factors, see Fig. 1 and Table 1 and see Table S1 in the supplemental material.
