The results of the molecular detection of CIRD-associated agents are reported in Tables 2-4. A total of 48 (34.78%) out of 138 sampled dogs were found to be infected by one or more CIRD agents, including 37/78 (47.44%) clinically ill, 5/22 (22.73%) exposed and 6/38 (15.79%) convalescent animals (Table 2) . Positive samples were obtained with higher frequency in purebred (25/51 dogs, 49.02%) than mixed-breed (23/87 dogs, 26.44%) animals. Accordingly, the majority of dogs infected by CIRD agents were client-owned (38/86, 44.18%) rather than kenneled dogs (10/52, 19.23%). As depicted in Table 3 , the most frequently detected agent was CPIV, which was detected in 18 dogs, including 16 (20.52%) ill, one (4.55%) exposed and one (5.27%) convalescent animals. Detection of CRCoV was achieved in 10 animals, of which 7 (8.98%) were clinically affected, one (4.55%) had been exposed to clinically ill dogs and two (5.27%) were CIRD convalescent. Other pathogens present in CIRD clinically ill dogs were B. bronchiseptica (8 animals, 10.26%), M. canis (7 animals, 8.98%), M. cynos (6 animals, 7.70%), and CnPnV (5 animals, 6.41%). Coinfections with more than one CIRD agent occurred in 9 animals, all of which were early acute clinically ill, and included two triple infections with B. bronchiseptica, M. cynos and CPIV, two dual infections with B. bronchiseptica and M. canis and single cases Table 1 Clinical score used to evaluate the respiratory disease of the samples dogs.
