The h5n1 ns1 Protein inhibits the rigi(n)-Mediated activation of iFn-β via its c-Terminal eD in an rna Bindingindependent Manner With the aim of elucidating the mechanism by which IAV NS1 protein counteracts the host innate immune responses, we generated four truncated H5N1 NS1 proteins, NS1/1-73, NS1/74-225, NS1/1-125, and NS1/126-225 ( Figure 1A) . In order to investigate the function of wtNS1, and its truncated peptides, we assessed its effect on IFN-β promoter activity using a luciferase reporter assay in 293T cells. Our results showed that wtNS1, NS1/74-225, and NS1/126-225 significantly decreased the IFN-β reporter activities driven by RIG-I or RIG-I(N). Conversely, NS1/1-73 did not change the activity of IFN-β reporter, and NS1/1-125 only slightly increased the activity compared to an empty vector control ( Figure 1B) . In addition, we found that wtNS1 and all truncated peptides had inhibitory effects on IFN-β reporter activities induced by Sev or rNS1-SD30 virus infection or transfection of poly(I:C) ( Figure 1B) . This suggests that NS1 N-terminal RBD alone is sufficient to inhibit the activation of IFN-β only in the presence of dsRNA; the C-terminal ED of NS1 could inhibit the activity of IFN-β reporter in all tested conditions. Driven by RIG-I(N), NS1/126-225 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of IFN-β promoter activity and IFN-β transcription ( Figure 1C) . Previous studies indicated that IAV NS1 sequesters dsRNA and binds RIG-I at its RBD, subsequently inhibiting the activation of IRF3 and preventing the induction of IFN-β (11, 16) . Our findings reveal that C-terminal ED of NS1 (NS1/126-225) blocked RIG-I(N)-mediated IFN-β induction in an RNA binding-independent manner.
