Sensitivity. We designed ZIKV genotype-specific LAMP primers that targeted conserved sequences in the E protein-coding region (Table 1) . Each genotype-specific primer recognised the same genomic position. To detect all known ZIKV strains, we used a mixture of primers specific for each genotype in a single reaction. First, we examined the sensitivity of the assay using serial 10-fold dilutions of in vitro synthesised standard RNAs from strain 976Uganda, which was isolated from a rhesus macaque in Uganda, and strain PRVABC59, which was isolated at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from a patient who travelled to Puerto Rico in 2015 32 . Ten copies of the RNA standards were detected from both strains in quadruplicate reactions (Fig. 1a) . The times to obtain positive results (Tp) for RNA standards ranging from 10 6 to 10 1 copies were mostly less than 15 min, and within this range, Tp was correlated with the number of RNA copies ( Fig. 1b and c) . Single copies of the standard RNAs from the 976Uganda and PRVABC59 strains were detected with 75% and 50% positivity, respectively, and Tp values were dispersed. These results suggested that the RT-LAMP assay could be used as a rapid, sensitive diagnostic test for ZIKV, the Tp value (i.e., less than 15 min) can be used as an indicator of the number of RNA copies in each reaction.
