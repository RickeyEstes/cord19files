Domain structure, expression, and purification of macro domain proteins Figure 1a and b shows the domain structure and amino acid sequence alignment of human macro domain proteins MDO1, MDO2, and GDAP2 with the macro domains from Semliki Forest virus (SFV; an alphavirus), HEV (sole member of the Hepeviridae family), and SARS-CoV. MDO1 and MDO2 do not contain any other predicted domains, although they have significant amino acid stretches attached, respectively, to the N-terminus or the C-terminus of the macro domain. However, a high level of sequence homology between them extends for ∼ 230 aa, although the macro domain comprises only ∼170 aa of these proteins. GDAP2 includes in its C-terminus a predicted Sec14 domain, which is a putative lipidbinding domain. 27 The viral macro proteins form parts of viral replicase polyproteins. SFV macro domain is located at the N-terminus of nsP3, followed by a unique alphavirus domain of unknown function and, after that, a hypervariable phosphorylated region. 24 In HEV, the macro domain is immediately preceded by a proline-rich region and a putatively unstructured spacer in the replicase protein, and followed by the viral helicase coding region. 28 In coronaviruses, the macro domain is flanked, depending on the virus, by papain-like protease domains or other domains of unknown function that remain in the same mature protein with the macro domain. 29 To study their biochemical properties, we expressed the macro domains derived from MDO1, MDO2, GDAP2, SFV nsP3, and HEV in Escherichia coli as N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged proteins. The previously characterized yeast protein Poa1p 7 was produced as control, and the SARS-CoV macro domain was obtained as previously described. 30 The proteins were purified by metal chelate chromatography, in some cases followed by a second puri-fication step ( Fig. 1c ; see Materials and Methods). The purified proteins were used in enzymatic and binding assays with ADP-ribose and its derivatives.
