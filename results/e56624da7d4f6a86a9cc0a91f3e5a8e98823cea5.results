Identification of chANXA2 as a novel binding protein to ALV-J Env. The pcDNA-env_DF1 cell line expressing ALV-J Env protein was previously constructed and shown to be resistant to ALV-J infection 18 . To use this cell line to isolate novel functional receptors for ALV-J, we first extracted the membrane proteins from the pcDNA-env_DF1 cells and then performed immunoprecipitation with the single monoclonal antibody (mAb) JE-9, which is specific to ALV-J Env 19 . Silver staining for SDS-PAGE of the immunoprecipitation revealed several different bands in the lysate that was immunoprecipitated with ALV-J-specific mAb JE-9 and not with the control antibody (Fig. 1A) . Mass spectrometry further revealed that one of these bands was chicken Annexin A2 (chANXA2), a member of the annexin family 20 . To further confirm this finding, a recombinant adenovirus rAd-SUJ-rIgGFc expressing fusion protein SUJ-rIgGFc (Fig. 1B) was constructed and the purified SUJ-rIgGFc was used to precipitate the membrane protein extracted from DF1 cells. SDS-PAGE and Mass spectrometry (MS) revealed that chANXA2 was also found in the precipitate with purified SUJ-rIgGFc, but not in the precipitate with rabbit IgG control protein (Fig. 1C) . Moreover, we cloned the fulllength cDNA encoding chANXA2 from the total RNA of the DF1 cells into the pcDNA3.1 vector, and did co-transfection with plasmid pcDNA3.1_EnvJ and chANXA2 in 293T cells. The co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) using mAb JE9 revealed that ALV-J Env protein could efficiently interact with chANXA2 (Fig. 1D ). All these data clearly demonstrate that chANXA2 is identified as a novel binding protein to ALV-J Env. Antibody or siRNA to chANXA2 significantly inhibiting ALV-J infection and replication. To test whether chANXA2 serves as a functional receptor for ALV-J infection, we used antibodies against chANXA2 to perform blocking assays to evaluate the effects of chANXA2 on ALV-J infection in DF1 cells. Our results revealed that the viral infection/replication of ALV-J was significantly inhibited in groups that had been treated with anti-ANXA2. As shown in Fig. 2A , there was little visible immunofluorescence in the cells that were treated with 50 or 25 mg/ml of the antibody against chANXA2 in the IFA. Moreover, only a few positive cells were found among the cells that were treated with 5 mg/ml of antibody against ANXA2. In contrast, many positive cells were found among the cells that were treated with the control IgG and among the untreated cells. Consistent with the IFA results, the viral titres of the cells that were treated with 50 and 25 mg/ml of antibody against chANXA2 were approximately 50-fold and 10-fold less, respectively, than those of the cells that were treated with the control IgG (Fig. 2B) . The inhibitory effect on ALV-J infection/ replication conferred by the antibody against ANXA2 was also confirmed by western blot (Fig. 2C) . As a viral control, we also performed a blocking assay for ALV-A infection in the DF1 cells. As described in Fig. 2D , the p27 expression levels of ALV-A in the groups that were treated with the antibody against chANXA2 were similar to those of the mock group, which indicates that the antibody against ANXA2 could not inhibit ALV-A infection/replication in DF1 cells. These data clearly demonstrate that blocking chANXA2 with a specific antibody can effectively and specially inhibit the infection/replication of ALV-J. To further evaluate whether the low expression of chANXA2 could confer resistance to ALV-J infection in its susceptible cells, we did siRNA against chANXA2 in DF1 cell, and then tested the effect on the ALV-J infection/replication. As described in Fig. 3A , real-time PCR showed that all four siRNA against chANXA2 tested could efficiently reduce chANXA2 mRNA level. And the western blot showed that all these four siRNA against chANXA2 tested could significantly decrease the infection/replication of ALV-J in DF1 cells (Fig. 3B ). Over-expression of chANXA2 permitting the entry of ALV-J into its non-permissible cells. To extend our finding and investigate whether the over-expression of the chANXA2 protein in ALV-J non-permissible cells could induce susceptibility to ALV-J infection, the replication of ALV-J in the 293T cells transfected with chANXA2 was analysed by IFA and real-time PCR. Real-time PCR revealed that the relative expression of the ALV-J envelope gene was increased in the chANXA2-transfected 293T cells at 72 h postinfection (Fig. 4A ). However, the 293T cells that were transfected with chANXA2 exhibited no visible specific fluorescence with the JE9 antibody to ALV-J Env. These data indicate that ALV-J could enter the 293T cells that were over-expressing chANXA2, but the viral replication of the ALV-J was restricted in the transfected 293T cells. To further confirm this finding, we also transfected chANXA2 into goose embryo fibroblast (GEF) cells in which the ALV-J could not grow. After 48 h, the transfected GEFs were infected with ALV-J. The GEF cells were maintained in DMEM medium for 2 days. Next, the mixture of GEF cells and supernatants were inoculated into fresh DF1 cells. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 4B , virus was recovered from the GEF cells transfected with chANXA2, but no virus was obtained from the GEF cells that were transfected with the control plasmid. Together, these data demonstrate that the over-expression of chANXA2 in 293T or GEF cells can support ALV-J entry into these ALV-J non-permissible cells.
