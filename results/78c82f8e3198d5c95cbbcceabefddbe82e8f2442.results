In order of importance, the participants identified severity of illness in humans, epidemic/ pandemic potential in humans, socio-economic burden, prevalence/incidence and availability of interventions (weighted scores assigned to each criteria were 0.23, 0.22, 0.21, 0.17 and 0.17 respectively), as the criteria to define the relative importance of the diseases. The The final list of diseases to be prioritized included 36 diseases/pathogens. The distribution of calculated weight and rank for each of the five criteria from each of the five groups is given in Table 2 . The criterion evaluating illness in humans was ranked highest in three of the five groups and second in the remaining groups and ranked highest overall. Overall, the top five priority diseases in descending order were anthrax, trypanosomiasis, rabies, brucellosis and RVF (Table 3 ). Viral and bacterial zoonoses made up 60% of zoonotic pathogens at 36.1% and 25% respectively; zoonoses caused by helminths were 13.9%, protozoan and fungi 8.3% each, ecto-parasites 5.5% and others 2.8%. Overall, zoonotic diseases with limited data including West Nile virus fever, Lassa fever, diphyllobothriasis or no local or regional data including, hantavirus fever, and histoplasmosis generally ranked lowest since two of the criteria, epidemic potential and prevalence of disease relied on presence of local data. For severity of illness, diseases with a CFR of >50% such as Ebola, Marburg, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and rabies were scored highly and diseases/events with a CFR 5% including RVF, brucellosis, salmonellosis and AMR scored lower. While pathogens classified as viral hemorrhagic fevers were generally scored higher on adjusted disability weights, HAT, Ebola, rabies and yellow fever were assigned the highest score by three or more groups. In the assessment of epidemic potential, endemic zoonotic diseases that are reported in humans and animals annually in multiple counties in Kenya through the Ministry of Health's Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) System and the Directorate of Veterinary Services surveillance system were assigned high scores. This includes diseases such as anthrax, RVF, rabies, Q-fever, dengue fever and brucellosis. High scores were assigned to anthrax, brucellosis, RVF and Mycobacterium species, diseases for which outbreaks in livestock are associated with high direct and indirect losses in productivity and market losses associated with quarantines and trade bans. Diseases that had reported high prevalence and in multiple counties including brucellosis, schistosomiasis and RVF were assigned high scores while diseases that had not been reported in Kenya or reported less than 1% prevalence in less than two counties including a number of viral hemorrhagic fevers (Ebola and Marburg), plague, Lassa fever, hantavirus and fungal diseases including histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis were assigned a score of 0. Anthrax, brucellosis and most of the bacterial infections were scored highly for potential for intervention since vaccines and treatments are available for humans or animals. However, most of the viral diseases with the exception of RVF, yellow fever and influenza scored low in this category due to the unavailability of vaccines and drugs.
