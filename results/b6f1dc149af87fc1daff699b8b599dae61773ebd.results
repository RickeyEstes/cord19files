The leading cause of death in the eastern Mediterranean region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90·3 deaths per 100 000 people). 8 It surpassed both diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory infections as the leading cause of death in 1990, increasing by 17·2%. There was a shift in main causes of death from communicable to non-communicable diseases in the region. Causes of death and their rates of change varied by country. 8 For example, diarrhoeal disease was the leading cause of death in Somalia and accounted for 186·7 deaths per 100 000 people in 2013, a decrease of 26·9% from 1990. 9 All countries observed an increase in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy since 1990, although at different rates (appendix pp 7-8). Afghanistan had the lowest life expectancy and healthy life expectancy (56·5 years vs 49·0 years for men, 56·0 years vs 48·8 years for women, respectively), whereas Qatar had the highest (81·2 years vs 69·2 years for men, 83·1 years vs 69·5 years for women, respectively). Lebanon had a higher increase in healthy life expectancy than life expectancy. Global life expectancy for both sexes increased from 65·3 years in 1990, to 71·5 years in 2013. 4 There was a change in causes of years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2013 in all countries (appendix p 9). Overall, regional YLLs decreased from 45 312 years per 100 000 people in 1990 to about 24 160 years per 100 000 people in 2013. 8 Cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and transport injuries increased, especially in high-income and middle-income countries in the region, whereas neonatal disorders, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections decreased. HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis were large contributors to YLLs in 2013 in Djibouti. War was a large contributor to YLLs in Syria in 2013 (38·1% of total YLLs). 8 Overall, regional years lived with disability (YLDs) increased from 9526 years per 100 000 people in 1990 to about 10057 years per 100 000 people in 2013. 8 Musculoskeletal disorders and mental disorders and substance abuse were major contributors to YLDs in 2013 and had the highest increase (appendix p 10). Nutritional deficiencies (mainly iron-deficiency anaemia) decreased in the region overall, but remained a large burden in low-income countries. For example, nutritional deficiencies remained one of the leading causes of YLDs in Yemen although the YLDs per 100 000 people decreased slightly by 2% from 1990. 8 Overall, regional DALYs decreased from 54 838 years per 100 000 people in 1990 to about 34 217 years per 100 000 people in 2013. DALYs vary disproportionately by age and sex. Children younger than 5 years contributed to about 33% of total DALYs with a rate of 94 884 years per 100 000 people, compared with 34 217 years per 100 000 people for the general population. 8 Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of DALYs in the region in 2013 in males and when data for both sexes were combined, whereas diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause in 1990 (table 1) . Lower respiratory infection was the leading cause of DALYs for females. Causes of DALYs varied by income; lower respiratory infection was the leading cause of DALYs in low-income countries (appendix p 15), ischaemic heart disease in middle-income countries (appendix p 16), and road injuries in high-income countries (appendix p 17). Causes of DALYs and their change from 1990 by country varied widely (appendix p 11). Causes of DALYs varied by age. For example, DALYs for mental health peaked in early adulthood and declined with age, whereas DALYs for cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms increased with age (appendix p 1). Different patterns of DALYs were observed in different income levels (appendix pp [12] [13] [14] . High blood pressure was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 2013, which increased by 83·3% from 1990 (from 8·5 million to 16·1 million DALYs; table 2; 8 however, the number of DALYs per 100 000 people increased by only 14%. High blood pressure increased from the fifth highest cause of DALYs in 1990 to first in 2013. Risk factors for DALYs varied by country, with childhood wasting as the leading cause in Somalia, Afghanistan, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause of DALYs in Djibouti. Conversely, noncommunicable disease risk factors were the leading cause of DALYs in high-income countries and middle-income countries (figure 1). DALY risk factors varied by age; child malnutrition and suboptimal breastfeeding affected the younger age groups (aged 7 days to 4 years) and high bodyweight and systolic blood pressure affected the older age groups (aged 60-80 years; appendix p 2). The annualised rates of change for DALY risk factors by burden for the region, low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries are shown in the appendix (pp 3-6). DALYs per 100 000 people attributed to high body-mass index increased by 28% from 1990 to 2013 (from 1961 years per 100 000 people to 2506 years per 100 000 people) and accounted for over 7·3% of total DALYs. 8 For high-income countries, high fasting plasma glucose, high body-mass index, alcohol use, and drug use accounted for the highest annual increase with a high DALYs burden. Decomposition tables for the impact of ageing and population growth on the changes in DALYs from communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, and injuries for the region are shown in table 3, and in the appendix (pp 18-21) for low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries. DALYs caused by non-communicable diseases and injuries increased (mainly because of population growth), whereas DALYs caused by communicable diseases decreased, although the actual rates of DALYs decreased for all risk factors (table  3) . Conversely, a steady decrease in life expectancy was observed in Syria because of the continuing war. Therefore, between 1990 and 2013 life expectancy for Syria would have been 6 years higher than observed for males and 5 years higher for females had the crisis not happened. Moreover, our analyses showed that several countries in the region have experienced a slow-down in lowering infant mortality rate. For example, in Syria the annualised rate of reduction in infant mortality between 2010 to 2013 was -9·1%, in sharp contrast with the rate of decrease of 6·0% before 2010. 9
