DNA sequence analysis of 409 bp PCR products showed the fragment of strains tested to have 94% nucleotide sequence identity to CCV Insavc (reference strain). Sequence and alignments are not shown. As showed in Table 1 , only 14/71 (19.71%) of the samples examined were positive in the PCR assay; in contrast, 30/71 (42.25%) of the samples were positive in the n-PCR assay. The n-PCR positive samples included the 14 PCR positive samples. CCV was isolated in cell culture from only three of the 30 n-PCR positive samples. Negative staining ultramicroscopic examination of the 45 samples showed viral particles resembling coronavirus morphologically in four cases. The virions were pleomorphic, 90 -120 nm in diameter and had the typical spikes. Using IEM some groups of aggregated particles covered by a fuzzy halo of antibodies were seen. Two of those samples resulted positive in isolation assay, while the third and fourth were negative by virus isolation. Three out of the four EM positive samples were positive by PCR and n-PCR.
