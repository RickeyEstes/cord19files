In total nine air samples were taken over a period of one month. The results have been summarised in Table 1 . From Figure 3 , it can be seen that even in the three months prior to the air sampling study period, the levels of AdV DNA in the routine NPA samples varied dramatically over a range of 1000 to 100 million (i.e., over 5 log 10 ) AdV DNA copies/mL. During the air sampling period, this variation was more limited (from 10,000 to 10 million AdV DNA copies/mL). This large variation and lack of viral clearance was likely due to the establishment of some degree of AdV latency in the adenoids with ongoing reactivation in a child with an underlying primary (congenital) immunodeficiency. Between each air sampling session, the button sampler and accompanying tubing were thoroughly washed with warm soapy water, rinsed, then air-dried to physically remove any respiratory virus nucleic acid that might be present on the inside surfaces. 'Dry' runs using just the gel filter dissolved in VTM failed to detect any AdV DNA. This VTM was also used on the wards for daily routine clinical sampling, and as a negative extraction and PCR control during normal diagnostic testing, so any potential for viral contamination was monitored on a daily basis. After discussion with our local institutional review board (IRB) it was agreed that this air sampling constituted environmental sampling and therefore did not require a formal ethics approval.

Figure 3 . Variable AdV DNA levels in the routine patients nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs). Note that the date increases from left to right along the x-axis, and the y-axis (placed on the right-hand side to allow easier comparison with dates of sampling) shows the AdV DNA in copies/mL VTM. Air sampling was performed on the dates indicated by the vertical black arrows. Despite high NPA AdV DNA levels at times, no AdV DNA was detected in any of the air samples with the same routine commercial diagnostic respiratory PCR assay (spiked samples with positive AdV DNA extract showed no inhibition from the gel filter).

Despite high NPA AdV DNA levels at times, no AdV DNA was detected in any of the air samples with the same routine commercial diagnostic respiratory PCR assay (spiked samples with positive AdV DNA extract showed no inhibition from the gel filter). Despite the varying and occasionally very high levels of AdV DNA levels in the corresponding NPA samples, no AdV DNA was detected in any of the air samples. In addition, none of the ETA samples were positive for AdV DNA. As well as the negative controls described in the Methods section, further control experiments involving spiking the gel filters prior to extraction and PCR with the patient's positive AdV NPA samples showed no inhibition. There was minimal (1 Ct or less) impact of the dilution factor due to the gel filter being dissolved in 2 mL VTM compared to the neat NPA PCR signal. This indicates that during this study period, despite these high levels of AdV present in the patient's nasal and oropharyngeal cavities, very little if any virus was being released into the air around the patient's breathing zone whilst the tracheostomy was in situ.
