Self-structures ruined a high temperature CHA (HT-CHA) at room temperature. Our demonstration started from specifically designing a HT-CHA for potential MERS-CoV virus detection. The reaction followed a classic four-step pathway 9 shown in Fig. 1A and general rules summarized in our report of HT-CHA 15 . The catalyst (C1) sequence was designed as a selected 29-mer fragment within ORF1A region of MERS-CoV virus gene (MRES-1A, Fig. 2A ) 31, 33 . Customarily, we describe the DNA reaction components in terms of numbered domains, each of which contains 10-15 mer short sequence. Complementarity between numbered domains is denoted by an asterisk (*). In presence of C1, its domain 1 serves as a toehold to bind domain 1* on H1 and initiates a branch migration reaction to open the H1 stem (Fig. 1A, Step I). Domain 3 on H1 then serves as a second toehold to initiate another strand displacement reaction to open the H2 stem, forming the C1-H1-H2 intermediate (Fig. 1A, Step II). C1 can automatically dissociate from H1 and serve as a catalyst to trigger one other round of hairpin assembly reaction, leaving H1-H2 duplex as final product (Fig. 1A, Step III). Meanwhile, overhanging fragment (4*-3*-2*-5*-6*) on H1-H2 initiates one more toehold-mediated strand displacement that releases a fluorescence quencher (Q1) from a fluorescein amidite (FAM)-labeled oligonucleotide (F1), allowing the reaction process being monitored (Fig. 1A, Step IV). As shown in Fig. 2B gotten at 55 °C, a sharp fluorescence increase was clearly observed when only 2.5 nM C1 was added into the CHA reaction, on contrast to a quasi-flat curve gotten from the reaction without any C1. Such high signal-background resolution was obtained through a temperature range from 47 °C to 60 °C ( Figure S2 ), well meeting the high performance of a HT-CHA 15 . However, when the temperature was decreased to our room temperature fluctuating between 20 °C and 25 °C, the reaction with same amount of 2.5 nM C1 showed almost ignorable fluorescence increase during a whole 3 h monitoring period (Fig. 2C) , which was more visually reflected by an almost 100-fold decrease in initial reaction rate (Δ relative fluorescent unit/Δ time 0-30min , Δ RFU/Δ t 0-30min ) compared with the one at 55 °C. According to our previous study 15 , it was predictable the HT-CHA could lose some catalytic efficiency at cooler temperature due to the slower dissociation of C1 from H1-H2-C1 complex (Fig. 1A, Step III). Here the completely loss in catalytic activity was more attributed to the undesirable secondary structures in C1 and fragment 4*-3*-2*-5*-6* formed at around 20 °C ( Fig. 2A , left, and S3A). Calculation was made on open-access online software, Nupack, developed by Caltech University 34 . They seriously blocked the toehold binding and thus slowed down further branch migration step, finally ruining the whole reaction. This assumption could be confirmed by observing gradually recovered catalytic activities along with heating-up the reaction ( Fig. 2B and S2 ). Upon temperature increase, these secondary structures would be gradually dissolved, and even eliminated when the temperature approached 60 °C ( Fig. 2A , right, and S3B). Formamide significantly improved the buffering abilities of a CHA circuit against unexpected cooling and self-folding. When we started importing formamide (from 10% volume concentration) into the above reaction at room temperature, a formamide concentration-dependent recovery in catalytic rate (with 2.5 nM C1) was observed. In presence of 40% formamide, the catalytic rate reached as high as 50-fold compared to that without formamide ( Fig. 2C and S4) . Meanwhile, the non-catalytic reaction rate (without C1) still kept unchanged "zero" in the same recipe, about 500-fold less than that of catalytic reaction. Above surprising improvement could be partially explained by earlier finding [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] and our experiments ( Figure S5 ) that formamide could accelerate the hybridization rate. Being identically consistent with one other pioneering literature 22 , we also observed formamide could linearly decrease duplex melting temperature at a rate of approximate − 6.5 °C/ volume fraction (× 100) formamide ( Figure S6 ), suggesting formamide was meanwhile destabilizing the nucleobase pairs. In a mechanism derived from our and other's understanding 22 , this phenomenon probably resulted from the special molecular size and composite of formamide. Carbonyl oxygen atom on formamide might serve as a hydrogen-bond competitor that directly occupies the position of one base, finally breaking-up a normal base pair. But meanwhile, formamide is also likely to just soften but not destroy a base pair through forming a base-formamide-base intermediate, in which both carbonyl oxygen atom and amino hydrogen atom take part in hydrogen bond formation. Formamide thus happened to gain similar function as heating and opportune force to unwind/soften those unexpected self-structures blocked the strand exchange reactions during the HT-CHA pathway. More intuitionally, formimade with appropriate amount was strong enough to melt those unexpected, relatively weaker self-folding structures in C1 and fragment 4*-3*-2*-5*-6*, but mild enough to remain the expected, stronger H1, H2, and H1-H2 duplexes. The softening effect also facilitated the process that C1 dissociated from H1-H2-C1 intermediate at low temperature. Overall, it was formamide's synergistic function of both accelerating and destabilizing that greatly enhanced the fluidity of a suppressed HT-CHA at room temperature. A detection limit of 50 pM C1 was gotten at 25 °C ( Figure S4 ), as sensitive as that gotten from a HT-CHA functioning at its desirable high temperature 15 . Summarized from our systematic discussion in both main text (Figs 3 and 4) and supporting information ( Figure S5 -S9), it could be concluded that the formamide-enhanced structure-buffering and thermo-buffering abilities could be generalized to any one step strand exchange reaction (Fig. 3 ) and CHA circuit (Fig. 4) , no matter it was a HT-CHA (Fig. 2C ) or regular CHA that was ought to proceed at around 37 °C (Fig. 4 ). Just through slightly adjusting the formamide content, we could more or less revive a CHA reaction from self-folding-lagged passivation, and at the time widen its efficient region to cooler circumstances than desired functional temperature Table S2 for convenient reading. Note: To meet different temperature requirements and prove the instrument-friendly property of our method, we used more than one fluorescent outputting instrument (Seeing Instruments section of supporting information). Therefore the data of y-axis of different figures may be in different scales. ( Fig. 2C and S9) . However, as a hydrogen-bond softener, the effect of formimade on an ideal (no self-folding) strand exchange or CHA reaction would not be definitely positive at desired functional temperatures or above, but highly depends on the toehold length (or sequence) of each strand exchange step. Notably, the advantage of using formamide in a circuit would be especially dramatic, much more obvious compared with in a one-step strand exchange reaction or simple hybridization. The reason was a nucleic acid circuit was an integration of multiple strand exchange reactions. Therefore, the promotional effect of formamide on each strand exchange step would be correspondingly integrated and accumulated in a circuit.
