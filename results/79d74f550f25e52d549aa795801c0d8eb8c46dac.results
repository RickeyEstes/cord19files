A summary of the COVID-19 confirmed cases by age group and symptom status onboard the Princess Cruises Ship is illustrated in Distributions of median R t for entire study period for overall, for type and by each transmission type are shown in Figure 3 . Median R t are 5.8 (95%CrI: 0.6-11.0), 6.1 (95%CrI: 0.5, 11.8), 0.9 (95%CrI: 0.3, 1.5) for overall and by type (passenger, crew). Examining inter-type and within-type transmission, R t estimates greatly vary across transmission types: 5.6 (95%CrI: 0.3, 10.9) for passenger to passenger, 0.6 (95%CrI: of R t estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0. Passenger and crew also have total (within-type and inter-type) R t values largely below the epidemic threshold, with only small percentages at 0% and 9% above the epidemic threshold, respectively (Table   3 ).
