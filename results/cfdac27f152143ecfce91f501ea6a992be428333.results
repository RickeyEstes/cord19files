A random sample with 41 TCM systematic reviews was selected from a database developed in a previous study [10] . Of which, only 9 reviews were written in English, and the majority (78%) was published in Chinese journals . The sample included 35 paper-based reviews and 6 Cochrane reviews; there was only one updated Cochrane review. According to the International Classification of Diseases 10 (ICD-10), the topics of the reviews ranged across 9 systems, and mainly focused on diseases of circulatory system Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3 (15 SRs or 37% of the sample, such as stroke and other cardiovascular diseases), infectious and parasitic diseases (7 SRs, like HBV, SARS), genitourinary system (5 SRs, such as ectopic pregnancy), digestive system (4 SRs, like ulcerative colitis), nervous system (3 SRs, such as Parkinson's disease), and musculoskeletal system and connective tissue (3 SRs, osteoporosis). The number of pages of included TCM SRs ranged widely from 2 to 80 with a median of 6 pages, of which, Cochrane systematic reviews had more pages than non-Cochrane reviews (P < 0.001), with medians of 31 (range: 16-80) and of 5 (range: 2-11), respectively. Less than half of the reviews (41.5%) were presented by clinicians. Total mean scores on AMSTAR ranged from 2 to 10 (out of a maximum score of 11) with a mean percentage score of 55.1%. The total mean quality scores on OQAQ ranged from 3 to 8 (out of a maximum score of 9) with a mean percentage score of 63.6%. The overall scores for the global assessment instrument (item 10 in OQAQ) ranged from 1 to 6 (out of a maximum score of seven) with a mean of 3.3 (95% CI: 2.9, 3.6), and overall scores using the self-developed 100-point rating scale ranged from 15 to 73 with a mean of 47.6 (95% CI: 43.4, 51.7). 3.1. Agreement and Reliability. Substantial agreements (>80% or nearly 80%) were observed in majority of the individual items (item 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11) on AMSTAR, with a mean percentage of 84% (95% CI: 71.1%-91.9%); agreements on item 5 and item 9 were mild at a percentage of less than 60%. Kappa ranged widely from −0.03 to 1.00 with a mean of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.73); five items (item 2, 3, 4, 10, 11) scored a kappa of >0.70 (0.70 to 1.00); the highly agreements in four items (item 1, item 6, item 7, item 8) ranged from 80% to 95% and inversely low kappa (−0.034, 0.40, 0.36, 0.36) may be explained by a skewed distribution of responses, that is, approximately 80% (in item 6) to 90% (in item 1, 7, 8) of reviews in which the assessors agreed on the score "yes." However, items 5 (list of included and excluded studies) and 9 (appropriate method to combine studies) scored relative low either in agreement percentage or in kappa parameter (Table 1) . Agreements on individual items of OQAQ were inferior to AMSTAR, with a mean percentage of 79% (95% CI: 64%, 89.5%), and the mean of kappa was relatively low too, with a mean of 0.35 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.62). The interobserver ICC to the total score was excellent for AMSTAR at 0.84 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.91), and superior to OQAQ, 0.67 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.82). The interrater agreement (kappa) between two assessors for the global assessment (item 10 in OQAQ) was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.48 to 0.85), and better than the self-developed 100-point rating scale: 0.50 (95% CI: 0.07-0.74).
