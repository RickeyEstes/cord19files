Ten MICU nurses participated in the study on day 1; 9 completed both days. All participating nurses were white, and most (90%, n ¼ 9) were female, with an average age of 35 (range: 24-48) years. Most (60%, n ¼ 6) had a bachelor's degree and were not a charge nurse (80%, n ¼ 8). Participants had an average of 11 years of experience wearing an N95 and 9.5 years of nursing experience; 60% (n ¼ 6) worked day shift. All but 1 (90%) were overweight as determined by having a body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 25, and half (n ¼ 5) were obese (ie, BMI ! 30).
