FIPV positive cells were found in cell suspensions from exudates and pyogranulomas in all cats. The percentage of FIPV positive cells varied from <1 to 10% (Table 3 ). The majority of the FIPV positive cells (95 AE 5%) belonged to the monocyte/macrophage lineage (mononuclear and DH59B positive) (Fig. 1 , lane A). Less than 1% of the FIPV positive cells showed a polymorphonuclear nucleus. Staining 2 revealed that no infected cells showed expression of viral antigens on their surface (Fig. 1,  lane B) . After cultivation of the FIPV positive cells, viral antigens were re-expressed on the plasma membrane as soon as 2 h post-seeding. Re-expression only occurred in 52 AE 10% of infected cells (Fig. 2) . The results of the MHC I staining (staining 3) in isolated cells of cats 6, 7, 8 and 9 showed that MHC I expression was present on 98 AE 3% of the FIPV positive cells (Fig. 1, of MHC I expression was observed between live and dead cells.
