A total of 209 articles were analyzed and coded (21% CDC communications, 79% broadcast transcripts). Dominant thematic frame and authoritative voice were determined for each month and for the overall period of analysis by communications source. To determine a dominant frame, the frequency of each frame within each month and overall was tallied; frames that were equal in frequency were both coded as dominant. As a result, some primetime broadcast news shows had up to four dominant frames or authoritative voices per month. Communications frequency, dominant thematic frame and authoritative voice were also analyzed by the primary ideological orientation of audience. This study hypothesized that ideological orientation could affect the dominant framing of communications; patterns emerged during analysis that indicated framing may have been influenced by ideological orientation. Using Pew Research Center data that scaled audience ideological orientation by television network, primetime broadcast news shows were classified on a scale from more conservative to more liberal in the following order: The O'Reilly Factor, The Kelly File, Anderson Cooper 360, All In with Chris Hayes, The Rachel Maddow Show (Pew Research Center, 2012).
