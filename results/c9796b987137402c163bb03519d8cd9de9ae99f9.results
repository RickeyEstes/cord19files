On average, participants preferred more intense interventions and disfavoured death and tax. The number of infections did not significantly influence respondents' responses. We identified two broad classes of respondents: those who were mortality averse and those who were expenditure averse. Education was found to be a predictor of group membership. On average, participants preferred more intense interventions, and preferred scenarios with fewer deaths and lower tax. The number of infections did not significantly influence respondents' responses. We identified two broad classes of respondents: those who were mortality averse and those who were expenditure averse. Education was found to be a predictor of group membership. The remaining households were found to have at least one eligible respondent (citizen or permanent resident aged 21 and over). For those with multiple eligible respondents, one was randomly selected to take the survey. Trained interviewers administered the paper survey face-to-face in English, Malay, Mandarin or Tamil. Participants were guided through the discrete choice experiment by the interviewer. The study was approved by the National University of Singapore Institutional Review Board. All methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.
