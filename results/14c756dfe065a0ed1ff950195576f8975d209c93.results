Hong Kong has a larger population than Guangzhou (6.8 million versus 3.7 million) during our study period. On average, Hong Kong has a slightly higher temperature, relative humidity and vapor pressure, and smaller annual variations than Guangzhou ( Table 1 ). The mean of the weekly proportions of specimens positive for influenza A or B was higher in Hong Kong than in Guangzhou. In 2004 and 2006, there were two peaks of virus activity in Hong Kong (one in February/March and another in June/July), but only one broad peak in Guangzhou ( Figure 2 ). The influenza seasonality was similar between these two cities in 2005. More deaths with underlying causes of cardiorespiratory, pneumonia and influenza or all-cause were recorded in the low temperature (or low vapor pressure) periods for both Guangzhou and Hong Kong ( Table 2) . For both cities, the mortality counts did not show any obvious difference across levels of relative humidity. High influenza virus activity coincided with high levels of temperature, relative humidity or vapor pressure, with the only exception of Guangzhou which had higher mean proportions when temperature is within the middle range. Significant interaction between temperature and influenza on the mortality risks was only found in cardiorespiratory mortality in Hong Kong (p < 0.05), and the interaction between relative humidity and influenza was found significant for all-cause mortality in both Guangzhou and Hong Kong, and for cardiorespiratory mortality only in Guangzhou ( Table 3 ). The patterns of influenza impact across the low to high temperature periods were not consistent among the two cities. In Guangzhou, the highest risk of mortality tended to be observed in the middle-temperature period, whereas for Hong Kong the largest changes in risk were found in the periods with high temperature for the three mortality categories ( Table 3 ). An increasing pattern of influenza associated mortality risks could be observed along low-, mid-and high-relative humidity periods in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, but most of estimates for low-and high-periods were not statistically significant ( Table 3) . The interaction between vapor pressure levels and virus activity were found to be significant (p < 0.05) for allcause and cardiorespiratory mortality, but not for pneumonia and influenza mortality (Table 3) . Consistently higher mortality risks were found at the high levels of vapor pressure, with only exception of P&I mortality in Hong Kong. The influenza effects on mortality of cardiorespiratory, pneumonia and influenza, and all causes were found significant during the middle-and highvapor pressure periods (with the only exception of allcause mortality in Hong Kong), but not significant when vapor pressures remained at the relatively low levels. For the high vapor pressure periods, all-cause excess mortality counts attributable to influenza would increase by 0.35% and 0.26% for per 1% increase of virus activity, and the corresponding increases for cardiorespiratory mortality were 0.54% and 0.49% for Guangzhou and Hong Kong, respectively (Table 3) . We also assessed the effect modification of environmental factors on influenza effects (i.e. interaction of each factor and influenza) for the age group younger than 65 years (< 65) and the elderly aged 65 years or older (≥65). The results of the ≥65 age group were consistent with those for the all-ages group, with an increasing trend over vapor pressure levels observed for all-cause and cardiorespiratory mortality in the two cities (Figure 3 ). For the < 65 age group, this trend could also be observed in most city-specific disease categories, with the only exception of all-cause mortality in Hong Kong. But the interaction terms were statistically significant (p < 0.05) only in the ≥65 group. The modifying effects of temperature and relative humidity on influenza effects were found quite similar between the all-ages and ≥65 age groups, but not between the allages and < 65 age groups (data not shown). The models with indicators for different cutoff points returned similar estimates for temperature, relative humidity and vapor pressure (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ). We did not observe any significant interaction between influenza and environmental factors in terms of their effects on the control mortality category of accidental mortality in Hong Kong. Influenza associated accidental mortality risks were also not statistically significant. To ensure the standardized comparison between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, we decided to apply the same modeling approach to the data of same study period, because the core model would have been slightly different if we used the longer time series of Hong Kong. To check the robustness of our conclusions, we repeated the above analysis using a longer time series data of Hong Kong during 1998-2006 and the estimates were shown in Additional file 1: Table S1 . The statistical significance of interaction terms was close to those from the study period of 2004-2006. The estimates for the low temperature periods became larger and statistically significant; those for the high relative humidity periods were smaller and comparable to the middle relative humidity; and for the low vapor pressure periods, the estimates were similar but became significant. The increasing trend across the low, middle and high levels of temperature and relative humidity was less evident. The results of stratification analysis by anomalies are shown in Additional file 1: Table S2 . The estimates were similar to those for the periods defined by absolute values of meteorological factors, in terms of magnitude and changing patterns. But the likelihood ratio tests showed more significant interaction for temperature or vapor pressure, and less for relative humidity.
