We have used NimbleGen tiling arrays to analyze the genomic variability of 13 BCG strains, including BCG-Russia, -Japan, -Moreau, -Sweden, -Birkhaug, -China, -Prague, -Glaxo, -Danish, -Tice, -Phipps, -Frappier and -Pasteur. All of these strains, except BCG-China, have previously been subjected to genomic analysis by other methods [18, 20, 22, 24, 25] . The complete genome sequence of BCG-Pasteur 1173P2 is available [24] . The same BCG-Pasteur strain was included in the analysis to serve as an internal control for our experiments in addition to validating the NimbleGen technique. In each experiment, genomic DNA from M. tb H37Rv [29] acted as the common referent.
