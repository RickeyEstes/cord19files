The characteristics of the study group regarding sex, birth weight and atopic risks are shown in Table 1 . A total of 22% of 186 infants suffered from obstructive bronchitis in the first year, and 11% of 184 (minus 2 incomplete questionnaires) experienced this condition in the second year of live. The frequency of occurrence of various airway symptoms is catalogued in Table 2 . As is shown attacks of breathlessness occurred very seldom. The frequency of obstructive bronchitis decreased for the whole cohort between the first and second year of life (c 2 5.6; p 0.02). About two thirds (66%) of the parents reported the redecoration of their apartment during pregnancy. Only 19% redecorated their apartment during the first or second year of the child's life (c 2 34.3; p < 0.01) The numbers of smoking, pet keeping, and/or dampness are also given (Tab. 3). Influences of redecoration of the apartment during the different periods of time on the occurrence of obstructive bronchitis and wheezing are shown in Table 4 . No association existed between overall redecoration or the various redecoration events during maternal pregnancy and infantile obstructive bronchitis or wheezing during the first or second year of life. Redecoration during the first year of the infant's life had a significant influence on obstructive bronchitis up to the first birthday (OR 3.6) but not in the second year. However, the influence on wheezing was not significant. Furthermore there was a significant relation between overall redecoration of the apartment during the children's second year of life and obstructive bronchitis (OR 4.3) and wheezing (OR 3.7). No significant influence from laying new wallto-wall carpets in children's rooms on airway diseases in the 1 st and 2 nd year of life could be proven. The next calculation should answer the question whether additional confounders such as smoking, dampness or house pets in the apartment influence the significant association between the redecoration of the apartment and the occurrence of obstructive bronchitis. All indoor contamination during pregnancy which was recorded on the questionnaires had no effect on the frequency of obstructive bronchitis appearing during the first and second year of life. (18) Percentages are referred to the total cohort of 186 children. A single character can contain several others. 1 Both parents with asthma, hay fever or atopic dermatitis. 2 One parent and one sibling or both parents with asthma, hay fever or atopic dermatitis. During the first year of life redecoration of the apartment led to an increase in the risk of obstructive bronchitis up to the first birthday, even after consideration of confounders, the strongest being male sex. In addition, smoking in the apartment also had an effect, although it was a smaller one (Tab. 5). Redecoration of the apartment during the second year of life was also an influential factor for obstructive bronchitis and wheezing during the children's second year of life even after the above mentioned confounders were considered (Tab. 6). In further models the effect of more than one simultaneous exposure was calculated. A simultaneous contamination from redecoration activities and an additional exposure such as smoking, a pet or dampness in the apartment increased the risk for obstructive bronchitis in the first year (OR 9.1; 95% CI 2.3 ± 34.8; n 172) as well as in the second year (OR 5.1; 95%CI 1.6 ± 15.6; n 178; Odds Ratios adjusted for cord-blood-IgE > 0.9 kU/l, birth weight 2500 g, male sex and double positive parental atopy anamnesis). 3.6 (1.4 ± 9.1)** 2.5 (0.9 ± 7.3) 1.6 (0.5 ± 5.1) 1.5 (0.5 ± 5.1) During 2 nd year 4.3 (1.6 ± 12.2)** 3.7 (1.3 ± 10.1)** Never redecoration 0.7 (0.3 ± 1.5) 0.6 (0.2 ± 1.4) 2.2 (0.7 ± 6.4) 0.9 (0.3 ± 2.5) The OR are adjusted for cord-blood-IgE > 0.9 kU/l, birth weight 2500 g, male sex, and double positive parental atopy anamnesis. Male sex had a significant influence on obstructive bronchitis in the first year (OR 5.1; CI 2.1 ± 12.5) but not in the 2 nd year.
