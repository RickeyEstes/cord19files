Construction of a highly specific RDT kit ZIKV E and NS1 proteins were exposed to the surface of the virus to be candidate targets as antigens. DNA sequences for the E and NS1 each were obtained from the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (http://viralzone.expasy.org) and cloned for the 261 amino acids of E and 354 amino acids of NS1 proteins. These 2 sequences are located adjacent to each other in the genome. Using these sequences, the ZIKV proteins were successfully expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as 37 and 45 kDa of molecular weight (Fig. 3) . Monoclonal antibodies showing high affinity constant to recombinant proteins were selected among the various hybridoma types. IgG1 from hybridoma J5E1 showed a 1.5 to 10 fold strong affinity (5.55× 10 9 ) to recombinant E antigen compared to isotypes from other hybridomas (3.12× 10 8 -4.02× 10 9 ). On the other hand, IgG1 from hybridoma J2G7 showed an even stronger response to recombinant NS1 antigen, with a 5 to 100 fold strong affinity (3.32× 10 9 ) to NS1 protein compared to isotypes from other hybridomas (0.25× 10 8 -6.22× 10 8 ) ( Fig. 4 ; Table 1 ).
