Since the two items (chance and confidence) were highly correlated (r = .78, p < .05), they were averaged to form the dependent variable ''expectations.'' An ANOVA was run on the composite dependent variable with valence of prior outcome (negative vs. positive) and domain (losses vs. gains) as independent variables. Consistent with Hypothesis 1, there was a main effect for valence of prior outcome. Participants who had won the first two lotteries felt that their likelihood of winning the third was significantly higher than participants who had lost the first two lotteries (M = 5.53 vs. 3.94; F (1,66) = 14.09; g 2 p =.18; p < .001). There was no observed main effect of domain. In addition, as predicted in Hypothesis 2, there was a significant valence · domain interaction on expectations of winning the third lottery (F (1,66) = 5.91; g 2 p = .08; p < .05). The pattern of the interaction is displayed in Fig. 1 To test the mediating role of affect (Hypothesis 3), two independent judges coded participants' thoughts leading to their responses to the two focal questions (i.e., chance of winning and confidence of winning). The judges were given basic information about the study, but were blind to the conditions the participants were in. They were asked to indicate whether, in terms of affect, a participant's response was negative, positive, or neutral. A negative response was defined as one in which the participant had written that his/her responses to the expectation questions were based on some negative feelings (e.g., ''I was sad because I didn't win either lottery.'') A positive response was defined as one in which the participant had written that his/her responses to the expectation questions were based on some positive feelings (e.g., ''I have won the two lotteries in the beginning, so that makes me feel pretty good about winning.''). A neutral response was defined as one in which the participant did not indicate any positive or negative feelings as the basis for his/her response (e.g., ''My chance is still 50% because there are only two options.''). 6 Subjects were undergraduate Business-school students who completed a mandatory research requirement by participating in this study; they were not required to participate in any more studies during their academic careers. Hence, there likely are no concerns that our procedure contaminated these subjects for future researchers who might employ real money gambles as their stimuli. 7 The significant 2-way interaction and the stronger effect in the domain of losses versus gains are supportive of our predictions. However, based on the recommendations of an anonymous reviewer, we conducted further contrast analyses. First, in order to determine whether the negative-valence-losses-domain cell was exerting a disproportionately strong effect on the dependent variable, a weight of À3 was given to this cell and a weight of +1 was given to each of the other three cells. We found that the contrast was significant (F (1,66) = 15.68; p < .01). Next, to determine whether the results are indeed due to an enhancement of prior outcome effects in the domain of losses, a weight of À3 was given to the negative-valence-losses-domain cell, a weight of +3 was given to the positive-valence-loss-domain cell, a weight of À1 was given to the negative-valence-gains-domain cell, and a weight of +1 was given to the positive-valence-gains-domain cell. We found that the contrast was significant (F (1,66) = 20.22; p < .001). Finally, in order to assess whether the results are driven only by the two negatively valenced cells, a weight of À1 was given to the negatively valencedlosses-domain cell and a weight of +1 was given to the negatively valenced-gains-domain cell, while the other two cells were given a weight of zero. Here again, we found that the contrast was significant (F (1,66) = 4.61; p < .05). The negative, neutral, and positive responses were coded as À1, 0, and 1, respectively. Since the responses of the two judges were highly correlated (r = .91, p < .001 and Cronbach's a = .95), they were averaged to form the affect variable. To assess whether affect mediated the effect of prior outcomes on expectations, we followed the procedure prescribed by Baron and Kenny (1986) . Using regression analyses we observed that the effects of both valence and the valence · domain interaction on the expectation regarding the future event were mediated by affect. When the mediator (affect) was used as the dependent variable, valence was significant (b = .41; t 66 = 4.11; p < .001), as was the valence · domain interaction (b = À.33; t 66 = À3.32; p < .01). When expectation was used as the dependent variable, we again observed a significant effect of valence (b = .40; t 66 = 3.80; p < .001) as well as the valence · domain interaction (b = À.26; t 66 = À2.43; p < .05). In this equation, when affect was introduced as a covariate, we found a significant effect of affect (b = .48; t 65 = 4.14; p < .001), and a lowered significance for both valence (b = .20; t 65 = 1.91; p = .06) and the valence · domain interaction (b = À.09; t 65 = À.94; p = .34). Sobel's (1982) test provided converging statistical evidence that affect mediated the main effect of valence (z = 2.92; p < .01), as well as the valence · domain interaction (z = 2.59; p < .01) on expectations of the future. As in Experiment 1, a composite dependent variable (expectation of winning the third lottery) of the two measures (chance and confidence) was computed (r = .86, p < .001). An ANOVA was run on the composite dependent variable with valence of prior outcome and domain as independent variables. The results were similar to those that were obtained in Experiment 1, providing evidence that the earlier results were robust. As predicted in Hypothesis 1, there was a main effect for prior outcome such that participants who had won the first two lotteries felt that their likelihood of winning the third was higher than participants who had lost the first two lotteries (M = 5.83 vs. 4.13; F (1,50) = 13.47; g 2 p ¼ .21; p < .01). In addition, consistent with Hypothesis 2, there was a significant valence · domain interaction (F (1,50) = 6.09; g 2 p ¼ .11; p < .05). The pattern of the interaction is displayed in Fig. 2 , and is similar to Again, as in Experiment 1, two independent judges coded participants' thoughts in order to examine the mediating role of affect (Hypothesis 3). Since the responses of the two judges were highly correlated (r = .84, p < .001 and Cronbach's a = .91), they were averaged to form the affect variable. Following the procedure prescribed by Baron and Kenny (1986) , we employed regression analyses and found that the effects of valence as well as valence · domain were mediated by affect. When the mediator, affect, was used as the dependent variable, valence was significant (b = .34; t 50 = 2.68; p < .05), as was the valence · domain interaction (b = À.26; t 50 = À2.08; p < .05). When expectation was used as the dependent variable, we again observed a significant effect of valence (b = .44; t 50 = 3.77; p < .001) as well as the valence · domain interaction (b = À.29; t 50 = À2.46; p < .05). In this equation, when affect was introduced as a covariate, we observed a significant effect of affect (b = .60; t 49 = 5.94; p < .001), and a lowered significance for both valence (b = .24; t 49 = 2.46; p < .05), and the valence · domain interaction (b = À.13; t 49 = À1.39; p = .16). Sobel's (1982) test provided converging statistical evidence about affect mediating the main effect of valence (z = 2.44; p < .05), as well as the valence · domain interaction (z = 1.96; p < .05). Responses to the preference scale were submitted to an ANOVA with valence of prior outcome and domain as independent variables. The pattern of results was similar to the expectations pattern we observed in Experiments 1 and 2. Consistent with Hypothesis 4, we observed a significant valence · domain interaction (F (1,51) = 4.27; g 2 p ¼ .08; p < .05) (Fig. 3) . Prior outcome valence (positive vs. negative) had a stronger effect on preferences for the risky versus certain choice when prior outcomes were in the domain of losses (M = 5.29 vs. 3.57; Cohen's d = 1.04) rather than gains (M = 4.62 vs. 4.79; Cohen's d = 0.09). In addition, there was a marginally significant main effect of valence of prior outcomes such that participants who had experienced positive prior outcomes preferred the riskier option (M = 4.95 vs. 4.18; F (1,51) = 2.87; g 2 p ¼ .05; p < .10). There was no main effect for domain. An examination of the proportion of choices made by subjects in each of the four conditions reveals a (not surprisingly) similar pattern. In the domain of losses, only 14.29% of the subjects who 11 Because our goal was limited to comparing a risky option to a riskless option, we chose only one version (gain frame) of the Asian Disease problem. However, we would expect to see similar results in the loss-frame version of the problem. experienced negative prior outcomes chose the risky option, compared to 35.72% of the subjects who experienced positive prior outcomes (z = 1.31; one-tailed p < .05). In the domain of gains, 43% of subjects experiencing negative prior outcomes selected the risky option, as did 38% of subjects experiencing positive prior outcomes (z = 0.23; one-tailed p > .20).
