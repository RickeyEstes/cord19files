BST2 specifically binds μ1 of AP1, but not μ2 of AP2 or μ3 of AP3 To identify the AP complexes involved in the trafficking of BST2, we investigated their ability to bind BST2. BST2 CD contains a putative tyrosine motif that is believed to bind to the μ subunits of AP complexes, and intracellular interactions between BST2 and the μ subunits of either AP1 or AP2 have been reported (Rollason et al., 2007; Masuyama et al., 2009) . We tested interactions between BST2 CD and the C-terminal domains (CTD) of the μ subunits of three AP complexes (AP1, AP2, and AP3). The purified μ1-CTD of AP1 bound BST2 CD as the two co-migrated as a higher molecular weight complex on a size exclusion column ( Figure 1A ). In contrast, no such binding was observed for either the μ2-CTD Figure 1. BST2 interacts with µ1 but not µ2 or µ3. (A-C) Size exclusion chromatograms and SDS PAGE analysis of purified MBP-BST2 CD (purple curve), MBP-µ CTD (green curve), and their mixture (red curve). A MBP-µ1 CTD and MBP-BST2 CD complex is formed in (A), as indicated by the shift (P1) of its elution volume from those of the individual components (P2 and P3). No complex formed between BST2 and µ2 (B) or µ3 (C). (D) Yeast 2-hybrid assays showing binding of BST2 CD to µ1, but not µ2 or µ3. Growth on -Leu/-Trp/-His + 3 mM 3AT plates indicates interaction.

The BST2 CD -µ1 interaction is abolished by the tyrosine motif mutation Y6/8A in BST2 CD or the tyrosinebinding pocket mutation D174A in µ1. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.02362.003 The following figure supplements are available for figure 1: Figure 1B ) or μ3-CTD ( Figure 1C) . These observations were further confirmed by a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay ( Figure 1D ). Consistent with the in vitro binding assay, BST2 CD exhibited binding to μ1, but not μ2 or μ3, in the Y2H assay. As controls, the TGN38 peptide containing a canonical YxxΦ motif displayed binding to all three μ subunits, and a mutant μ1 subunit (μ1 D174A) with a disrupted binding pocket for tyrosine-based motifs bound neither TGN38 nor the BST2 CD . Furthermore, this binding was abolished by the double alanine mutation of the YxY motif (Y6/8A) in BST2 CD . These results indicate that BST2 CD not only contains a tyrosine-based motif to allow for AP binding, but also a specificity determinant to select specifically for μ1. Our results support the involvement of AP1 in trafficking of BST2 and are consistent with a previous observation that BST2 binds to the μ1 subunit of AP1, but not μ2 of AP2 (Masuyama et al., 2009) . In the absence of Vpu, BST2 has been suggested to localize to the TGN through clathrindependent trafficking (Kupzig et al., 2003; Rollason et al., 2007; Masuyama et al., 2009) , and the BST2-AP1 interaction may be responsible for this localization. In contrast, an involvement of AP2 in BST2 trafficking has been suggested to occur through its α appendage domain. However, this interaction was not detected in our in vitro binding test using size exclusion chromatography (Figure 1figure supplement 1) . A specific site on AP2 for BST2 binding remains to be clearly elucidated. HIV-1 Vpu binds to multiple subunits of both AP1 and AP2, but not μ3 of AP3 Given the native affinity of BST2 for AP1 and the retention of BST2 in the TGN by Vpu, we sought to define the potential interactions between Vpu and AP1. As the functionally active ELV motif in Vpu CD is a putative acidic dileucine sorting signal, we hypothesized that Vpu binds AP1 at the acidic dileucinebinding site located at the γ and σ1 subunits. To test this, we created a truncated AP1 core with the μ1-CTD removed. Such a truncation construct (AP1t) mimics the open conformation of AP1, exposing the dileucine binding site on AP1 for interaction with cargo (Jackson et al., 2010) . We co-expressed Vpu CD with casein kinase II (CKII) to phosphorylate Vpu CD at S52 and S56 to mimic its cellular state ( Figure 2-figure supplement 1) . Unless mentioned otherwise, doubly phosphorylated Vpu constructs were used in all in vitro studies. Indeed, MBP-Vpu CD co-migrated with the μ1-truncated AP1 as a complex on a size exclusion column ( Figure 2A) . Importantly, the binding was abolished by the alanine-mutation of the ELV motif, signifying the crucial role of the ELV motif in the interaction between Vpu and AP1 ( Figure 2B ). We further tested the binding between Vpu CD and μ1-CTD and observed complex formation using size exclusion chromatography ( Figure 2C ). These interactions demonstrate that Vpu has evolved the ability to associate with multiple subunits of AP1, potentially allowing it to modulate the cellular trafficking machinery to target host proteins such as BST2. We next investigated the interaction between Vpu and subunits of AP2 and AP3. We used size exclusion chromatography to test the binding between Vpu CD and a truncated hemicomplex of AP2, α (1-398)-σ, which contains the binding pocket for the acidic dileucine sorting motif; an interaction complex was observed ( Figure 2D ). Furthermore, binding between Vpu CD and the μ2-CTD of AP2 was also observed ( Figure 2E ), while no such binding was observed between Vpu CD and the μ3-CTD of AP3 ( Figure 2F ). Altogether, these results suggest specific interactions between Vpu and AP1 and AP2, which may allow the viral protein to hijack the associated trafficking pathways. However, because BST2 CD specifically binds only to μ1, but not to μ2 or μ3 (Figure 1) , AP1 may play a more significant role than AP2 in the Vpu-mediated antagonism of BST2. This notion is supported by multiple observations, with one exception (Iwabu et al., 2010) , that Vpu does not increase the rate of BST2 internalization from the cell surface (Mitchell et al., 2009; Dube et al., 2010; Andrew et al., 2011; Schmidt et al., 2011) .
