To demonstrate the potential of iterative strain-level identification, we compared TaxIt against classic comprehensive search strategies based on non-iterative taxonomic identification supported by either unique PSMs or the abundance similarity correction of Pipasic 44 . The final selections of the top taxa candidates for all samples and all three compared identification strategies are summarized in Table 1 . For the cowpox sample, identification results agree the most. TaxIt (Figure 2) and Pipasic (Supplementary item 1 - Figure S1 ) are both able to identify the expected Cowpox virus (Brighton Red) strain. However, unique PSMs are limited to the parent Cowpox virus species and not available at the strain level. For this reason, an incorrect identification of Bat astrovirus Hil GX bszt12 could occur based on a single unique PSM (Supplementary item 1 -Figure S1 ). The results also show that the original TaxIt counts are not an All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

However, the weight-based correction method implemented in TaxIt resolves the present tie and emphasizes the correct Cowpox virus strain (Brighton Red). In comparison, bronchitis and bacillus samples feature notable variability in proposed taxa candidates. For bronchitis, TaxIt could identify the expected Avian infectious bronchitis virus (strain Beaudette CK) strain. Despite applying a small correction based on weighting, however, final candidate selection is not limited to a single strain but additionally includes a closely related strain, namely Avian infectious bronchitis virus (strain Beaudette US) ( Figure 3A) . Nevertheless, TaxIt provides a highly constrained selection of candidates in the first place. In contrast, the Pipasic-based strategy results in considerably more initial candidates and eventually promotes an incorrect strain, namely Avian infectious bronchitis virus (strain 6/82) (Figure 3B ). Since no unique PSMs are available for the bronchitis sample, strain-level identification was not possible with this strategy. Using TaxIt, the expected B. subtilis str. 168 strain is identified correctly in the reduced as well as in the complete sample (Supplementary item 1 - Figure S3 and S4) . Pipasic consistently misses the correct strain and species in favor of incorrect strains such as Bacillus cereus SJ1 and Bacillus cereus B4264. The unique-PSMs-based strategy includes the correct strain B. subtilis str. 168 into the final candidate list of the bacillus 1k sample. However, it fails to separate the strain from several distinct species due to equal amounts of unique PSMs (Supplementary item 1 -Figure S3) . Furthermore, the data analysis on the complete bacillus sample results in the incorrect species Paenisporosarcina quisquiliarum being predominantly present in terms of uniquely assigned PSMs. Besides identification efficiency, computational performance may delimit the potential application as routine or expeditious method in research or clinics. Therefore, we compared runtime and memory consumption for all samples and strategies (as illustrated in Table 2 and Figure 5) . Analysis was performed with X!Tandem as database search engine and limited to 24 threads on a server with Debian GNU/Linux 8.9 (jessie), 64 cores (128 threads) of type Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-4667 v4 @ 2.20 GHz, 512 GB of RAM and SSD storage. Applying the iterative approach reduces memory usage down to one third for viral strain identification and two third for bacterial strain identification. While the runtime of Pipasic is comparably high, TaxIt shows no substantial change in runtime in comparison to the unique-PSMs-based strategy for small databases such as the collective viral sequences or small sample sizes. However, analyzing the full bacillus sample reveals an increased runtime when using NCBI RefSeq proteins plus selected strain proteomes instead of the extensive NCBI Blast NR database.
