Observational study with AchPV1 and AchPV2 in ferrets. Two adult male ferrets aged 11-13 months were given 10 5 TCID 50 AchPV1 oronasally in 1 ml of inoculum and another two adult male ferrets aged 11-13 months were given 10 5 TCID 50 AchPV2 oronasally in 1 ml of inoculum. The animals were observed daily for clinical signs and then electively euthanased at 21 days post challenge (pc). One of the two ferrets exposed to AchPV1 remained clinically well and was electively euthanased at the end of experiment on day 21 pc. The other ferret showed signs of upper respiratory tract infection (sneezing, coughing) and weight loss from day 1 pc, and was euthanased at day 14 pc when it had reached a predetermined humane endpoint of 10% bodyweight loss. Post mortem examination revealed a pleural effusion and bronchopneumonia of the right intermediate lung lobe. Each ferret developed neutralising antibody against AchPV1, with titres of 1:320 (healthy) and 1:80 (ill) ( Table 1) . One of two ferrets exposed to AchPV2 remained clinically well and was electively euthanased at the end of the experiment on day 21 pc. The other ferret maintained normal play activity but showed signs of upper respiratory tract infection (sneezing, purulent nasal discharge) from day 3 pc and which resolved by day 11 pc. The animal was electively euthanased at the end of the experiment on day 21 pc. Each ferret developed neutralising antibody against AchPV2, with titres >1:1280 (healthy) and 1:1280 (ill/recovered) ( Table 1) . In summary, it is unclear whether the signs of respiratory tract disease in one of two ferrets given either AchPV1 or AchPV2 were attributable to infection by the challenge virus or by co-infection of an unknown pathogen. As higher neutralising antibody titres were observed in ferrets infected with AchPV2, and as there was prior serological evidence of this virus in people, AchPV2 was selected for a time-course study with ferrets. Observational study with AchPV1 and AchPV2 in guinea pigs. Four adult female guinea pigs were given 10 5 TCID 50 AchPV1 oronasally in 1 ml of inoculum and another four adult female guinea pigs were given 10 5 TCID 50 AchPV2 oronasally in 1 ml of inoculum. The animals were observed daily for clinical signs and then electively euthanased at 21 days pc. All four guinea pigs exposed to AchPV1 remained clinically well and were electively euthanased on day 21 pc. Each guinea pig developed neutralising antibody against AchPV1, with titres of 1:320, 1:80, 1:80 and 1:40 (Table 1) . Similarly, all four guinea pigs exposed to AchPV2 remained clinically well and were electively euthanased on day 21 pc. Each guinea pig developed neutralising antibody against AchPV2, with titres of 1:320, 1:160, 1:80 and 1:40 (Table 1) . Based on the same rationale as for ferrets, AchPV2 was selected for a time-course study with guinea pigs. Observational study with AchPV1 and AchPV2 in mice. Ten mice (five female BALB/c mice aged 12 weeks and five female BALB/c mice aged over 12 months) were given 10 3 TCID 50 AchPV1 intranasally in 50 µl of inoculum and another ten mice (five female BALB/c mice aged 12 weeks and five female BALB/c mice aged over 12 months) were given 10 3 TCID 50 AchPV2 intranasally in 50 µl of inoculum. The animals were observed daily for clinical signs and then electively euthanased at 21 days pc. All ten mice exposed to AchPV1 remained clinically well and were electively euthanased on day 21 pc. Neutralising antibody against AchPV1 was not detected in any mouse. Likewise, all ten mice exposed to AchPV2 remained clinically well and were electively euthanased on day 21 pc. Neutralising antibody against AchPV2 was not detected in any mouse. As mice had no detectable signs of disease and did not seroconvert to either AchPV1 or AchPV2, no further studies were conducted with mice. Time course study with AchPV2 in ferrets. Clinical and Pathological findings. For this study, eight adult female ferrets were given 10 5 TCID 50 AchPV2 oronasally in 1 ml of inoculum and then two animals were pre-allocated for euthanasia on each of days 6, 8, 10 and 21 pc. All eight ferrets in this study showed a mild but significant increase in rectal temperature over baseline on day 4 pc (p = 0.02), and a mild but significant loss of bodyweight compared to baseline on days 4 (p = 0.03) and 5 (p = 0.0004) pc (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Otherwise, the animals remained clinically well until elective euthanasia, apart from one of two ferrets scheduled for euthanasia on day 8 pc. This ferret (#9) showed signs of upper respiratory tract infection (sneezing, serous and then purulent nasal discharge) between days 2 and 6 pc and was euthanased on humane grounds on day 6 pc following markedly decreased play activity. Other than ferret #9, no significant gross abnormalities were observed at post mortem examination in any of the ferrets. The three ferrets euthanased on day 6 pc had minor histopathological changes associated with viral replication. Ferret #12 (day 6 pc) showed very mild acute bronchiolitis. Immunohistochemistry revealed viral antigen in germinal centres of the retropharyngeal lymph node but not in other tissues. In ferret #14 (day 6 pc), significant histopathological changes were confined to mild acute tonsillitis, and viral antigen was detected in the tonsillar and pharyngeal epithelium, retropharyngeal lymph node (particularly the parafollicular areas), bronchial epithelial cells, bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (BALT), perivascular spindle cells in lung, and germinal centres and periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths of the spleen. In ferret #9, euthanased on day 6 pc with respiratory disease, there was moderately severe acute bronchiolitis, hyperplasia of the BALT, excess mucus production by bronchial glands, and focal lipoid pneumonia consistent with chronic bronchial disease. Post mortem examination of ferret #9 also revealed marked nodular hyperplasia of the liver with hepatic steatosis, but this lesion was considered to be unrelated to virus exposure as no AchPV2 viral antigen was detected in the liver. In ferret #9, AchPV2 viral antigen was identified in tonsillar and pharyngeal epithelium, germinal centres, parafollicular area and medulla of the retropharyngeal lymph node, tracheal epithelium, bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium ( Fig. 1 ), BALT and perivascular connective tissues of the lung, bronchial and mediastinal lymph node, periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths and red pulp of the spleen, mononuclear cells in the intestinal lamina propria and cells either within or lining the hepatic sinusoids. In the single ferret euthanased on day 8 pc (ferret #16), there was mild focal acute tracheitis and bronchiolitis. The distribution of viral antigen was similar to ferret #9, with the addition of occasional bile duct epithelial cells and mononuclear cells of the portal triads, gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and transitional epithelial cells in the bladder. The two ferrets euthanased on day 10 pc showed only small amounts of viral antigen by immunohistochemistry. Ferret #11 (day 10 pc) had mild focal acute bronchiolitis, and detection of viral antigen was limited to small amounts in tonsillar lymphoid tissue, bronchiolar epithelial cells, periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths of the spleen, and a diffuse scattering throughout the retropharyngeal lymph node. Ferret #13 (day 10 pc) also showed very mild acute bronchiolitis, with AchPV2 viral antigen confined to scattered gastric epithelial cells, GALT, and sparse deposits throughout tonsillar lymphoid tissue, bronchial and retropharyngeal lymph nodes. Of the two ferrets euthanased on day 21 pc, one (ferret #15) had very mild acute bronchiolitis and tracheitis and one had no detectable lesions. AchPV2 viral antigen was not detected in any tissue from either of these two ferrets. Detection of viral genomes. AchPV2 RNA was detected by RT-qPCR in the oral swabs of 4 ferrets on day 2 pc and in all ferrets by day 4 pc until euthanasia: the highest levels were typically recorded on day 6 or 8 pc (Table 2) . Similar results were seen for the nasal washes: viral RNA was detected in 3 ferrets on day 2 pc, and in all ferrets by day 4 pc until euthanasia, the highest levels typically were recorded on day 6 or 8 pc. Rectal swabs first detected AchPV2 on day 4 pc, when all ferrets were positive, the highest levels occurred on day 6 or 8 pc. Viral RNA was commonly detected in blood samples from days 2 to 21 pc. Where viral RNA was found in successive blood samples from individual animals, highest levels were recorded on day 6 or 8 pc ( Table 2) . All tissue samples analysed from ferrets #9, #12 and #14 euthanased on day 6 pc were positive for viral RNA (data summarised in Fig. 2) , with the highest levels in bronchial and retropharyngeal lymph nodes and the lowest levels in heart, kidney and brain. Each tissue sample tested from ferret #16 (euthanased 8 days pc) was also positive for viral RNA, with the highest reading in retropharyngeal lymph node. On day 10 pc, ferrets #11 and #13 SCIEntIfIC REPORTS | (2018) 8:12744 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-31193-z exhibited generally similar distribution and quantities of viral RNA to the animals above. However, on day 21 pc the levels of viral RNA in ferrets #10 and #15 were substantially lower, and largely limited to the retropharyngeal and bronchial lymph nodes and the spleen. Virus isolation. Virus was reisolated from the nasal wash and from the oral and rectal swabs of ferret #9 on day 6 pc, the nasal wash of ferret #10 on day 6 pc, the oral swab of ferret #11 on day 6 pc, and from the oral swabs of ferret #16 on days 6 and 8 pc, plus the nasal wash of this ferret on day 8 pc (Table 2) . Virus was reisolated from ferrets killed on day 6 pc from tonsil, bronchial and retropharyngeal lymph nodes, lung and brain (ferret #9); trachea, tonsil, bronchial and retropharyngeal lymph nodes, and bladder (ferret #12); and tonsil and bronchial and retropharyngeal lymph nodes (ferret #14) (Fig. 2) . Virus was reisolated from tonsil and trachea of ferret #16 (which was killed on day 8 pc) and from the retropharyngeal lymph node and kidney of ferret #13 (day 10 pc), but not from ferret #11 (day 10 pc). Virus re-isolation from ferrets killed on day 21 pc was limited to the retropharyngeal lymph node of ferret #15. Serology. No neutralising antibodies were observed at day 2 or 4 pc but by day 6 low levels of neutralising antibodies were detected in the ferrets (Table 4 ). They showed an increase in neutralising antibody titre across the time points, with the animals bled at day 21 pc having neutralising antibody titres >1:1280. Time course study with AchPV2 in guinea pigs. Clinical and Pathological findings. For this study, eight adult female guinea pigs were given 10 5 TCID 50 AchPV2 oronasally in 1 ml of inoculum and then two animals were pre-allocated for euthanasia on each of days 6, 8, 10 and 21 pc. In guinea pigs, there were no significant differences in temperature or bodyweight over baseline up to day 6 pc, and the animals remained clinically healthy until elective euthanasia (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 ). No significant gross abnormalities were observed at post mortem examination, apart from enlarged bronchial lymph nodes in one guinea pig euthanased on day 6 pc. The only histopathological changes observed were: mild acute tracheitis in all animals, two animals with mild acute bronchitis and/or bronchiolitis, and four with mild chronic interstitial pneumonia attributable to inhalation of plant material. In contrast to the observations in ferrets, the pattern of respiratory tract lesions did not correlate with the time post-exposure to AchPV2; very few histopathological changes were observed and all sections of tissues from all guinea pigs were negative for AchPV2 antigen by immunohistochemistry. Detection of viral genomes. Low levels of AchPV2 were detected in the oral swab of one guinea pig on day 6 pc and of another on day 8 pc (Table 3) . Rectal swabs were positive in four of six guinea pigs on day 8 pc, and from Table 2 . Analysis of viral shedding and viraemia in ferrets by RNA detection and virus isolation. Average cycle threshold (Ct) values were obtained from testing oral and rectal swabs, nasal washes and blood from AchPV2 ferrets using RT-qPCR. KEY:-indicates sample was negative (Av Ct > 38); NA indicates sample was unavailable for testing; * indicates virus re-isolated at neat dilution; ** indicates virus re-isolated at 1:5 dilution and *** indicates virus re-isolated at 1:50 dilution. Most tissue samples analysed from guinea pigs euthanased on day 6 and 8 pc were positive for viral RNA (data summarised in Fig. 3) , with highest levels present in nasal turbinates, bronchial and retropharyngeal lymph nodes, and spleen, and lower levels in trachea, lung, and liver. Detection of viral RNA was lowest and inconsistent from heart, kidney and brain. By day 10 pc, viral genome detection was limited to bronchial and/or retropharyngeal lymph nodes, lung, spleen, and nasal turbinates (one of two animals). On day 21 pc, one guinea pig was negative by RT-qPCR for all tissues; in the other, viral genome was detected only in bronchial lymph node and spleen. Virus isolation. Virus was not reisolated from any of the clinical samples, including those that were positive by AchPV2-specific RT-qPCR (Table 3 ). In addition, virus was not reisolated from any tissue sample, including those that were positive by AchPV2-specific RT-qPCR (Fig. 3) . Table 4 . The serum neutralisation titres against AchPV2 for ferret and guinea pig serum collected on days 6, 8, 10 and 21 pc. Sera collected on day 2 and 4 pc were also tested but were negative for neutralising antibodies (data not shown). * This animal became ill and was euthanized at day 6 pc instead of day 8 pc. Oral Swab - Serology. No neutralising antibodies were observed at day 2 or 4 pc but by day 6 low levels of neutralising antibodies were detected in the guinea pigs (Table 4 ). There was a slight increase in neutralising antibody titre across the time points with a titre of 1:160 by day 21 pc.
