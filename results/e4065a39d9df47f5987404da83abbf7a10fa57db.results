Magnolol and honokiol inhibited the amyloid formation of human calcitonin. Thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence based assay was used to monitor amyloid formation of hCT. 25 μ M hCT gave a strong ThT emission, reaching the plateau stage after 40 h incubation with a lag time of 22 .84 ± 2.03 h ( Fig. 2A,B) . As a control, addition of an equimolar amount of EGCG significantly inhibited the aggregation of hCT ( Fig. 2A,B) , which agrees with a previous report 55 . Mag and Hon both inhibited hCT aggregation in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of an equimolar amount of Mag extended the lag time to 33.34 ± 1.67 h (P < 0.05) without significantly reducing the maximum ThT fluorescence intensity ( Fig. 2A) . However, in the presence of 3-fold molar excess of Mag, the maximum ThT fluorescence intensity was substantially decreased to 42% of that of the control, accompanied with a prolonged lag time of 47.19 ± 3.62 h (P < 0.05). When the molar ratio was further increased to 5:1, the aggregation of hCT was significantly inhibited, with a lag time of 57.44 ± 5.59 h (P < 0.05). Compared to Mag, Hon was less potent on inhibiting hCT aggregation. The presence of an equimolar amount of Hon slightly decreased the maximum ThT fluorescence intensity to 74% of that of the control, without prolonging the lag time (Fig. 2B ). The addition of 3-fold and 5-fold amount of Hon showed stronger inhibitory effects, which decreased maximum ThT fluorescence intensity by 35% and 55%, with the lag time prolonged to 37.78 ± 1.48 h (P < 0.05) and 36.32 ± 4.67 h (P < 0.05), respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was then used to observe the morphology of hCT aggregates to corroborate the ThT fluorescence assay results 56 . After 72 h of incubation, hCT formed extensive linear fibrils (Fig. 2C) . Addition of an equimolar amount of EGCG significantly inhibited the fibril formation of hCT (Fig. 2D) , which is consistent with a previous report 55 . In the presence of Mag and Hon, hCT showed no obvious fibrils after 72 h of incubation ( Fig. 2E-J) . Amorphous aggregates were observed for hCT samples co-incubated with Mag and Hon at molar ratios of 1:1 or 3:1 (Fig. 2E ,F,H,I), whereas fewer aggregates were observed in the presence of 5-fold molar amount of Mag or Hon (Fig. 2G ,J).
