Out of 149 patients eligible to ATS/IDSA NTM lung disease criteria, 51 patients were included in the study, of who 25 (49%) received and 26 (51%) did not receive anti-NTM treatment (Fig. 1 ). The median age was 68 (interquartile range [IQR], 59-75) year-old with a male/ female ratio of 0.76. Etiologic NTM agents were Mycobacterium avium (n = 17, 33.3%), M. chimaerae (n = 14, 27.5%), M. xenopii (n = 9, 17.6%), M. intracellulare (n = 9, 17.6%), M. simiae (n = 3, 5.9%), M. kansasii (n = 1, 2%), and M. abscessus (n = 1, 2%), with three patients having â‰¥2 concomitant NTM lung diseases. Importantly, the evidence of NTM lung disease has led to diagnose six underlying chronic lung diseases, of which a genetically documented cystic fibrosis in a 61 year-old women. On descriptive analysis, patient's characteristics did not significantly differ, to the exception of a lower BMI (p = 0.023) and a higher number of previously known NTM lung disease (p = 0.038) in treated versus untreated patients (Table 1) . Notable percentages of missing data at diagnosis have to be acknowledged for active tobacco smoking (64.7%, n = 33), respiratory functional testing (23.5%, n = 12) with a very few patients having a 6-min walk test, baseline arterial blood oxygenation levels (58.8%, n = 30), CT-scan follow up within 24 months after diagnosis in untreated patients (46%, n = 12). Factors leading the patient referent physician to initiate anti-NTM treatment were assessed using bivariate analysis. Table 3 ). The probability of treatment initiation over time according to the presence or not of targeted variables was investigated. The probability was significantly higher in case of BMI < 18 vs. > 18 kg/m 2 (p = 0.006), of hemoptysis vs. no hemoptysis (p = 0.009), of Aspergillus spp. co-infection vs. no co-infection (p = 0.029), of pulmonary excavation(s) vs. no excavation (p = 0.005) (Fig. 2a, b, c and d, respectively) . (Table 2) . Finally, all-cause mortality was not different between treated and untreated groups, although lost to follow-up was high in the untreated group (n = 10, 38.5%). Regarding the four patients that deceased (n = 3 in the treated group and n = 1 in the untreated group), the cause of mortality was linked to the underlying diseases rather than NTM-related mortality.
