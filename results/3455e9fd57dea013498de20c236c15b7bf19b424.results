Global genetic diversity and swine H1 clade designations. Substantial genetic diversity was demonstrated in H1 viruses circulating in swine over the past 5 years (2010 to present) and among geographic regions ( Fig. 1 and 2) . Three major first-order H1 lineages continued to circulate in pigs ( Fig. 1 ; also see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material): the 1A classical lineage, viruses related to the 1918 human influenza pan- demic; the 1B human seasonal lineage, the result of multiple human-to-swine transmission episodes of human seasonal H1 strains over decades; and the 1C Eurasian avian lineage, arising from an introduction from wild birds into pigs in the 1970s. The majority (~87%) of the viruses from 2010 to the present were placed into seven clades. The numerically dominant clades reflected intensive surveillance in the United States (24, 25) , investigator sequencing efforts in Canada (e.g., references 32 and 33), and the rapid dissemination of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus (H1N1pdm09) across global swine populations (7, 16) . Similarly, coordinated surveillance in Europe (26, 34) and Asia (6) captured two primary clades of 1C Eurasian avian lineage currently circulating in the two continents. Clade designations for 1A (classical) swine lineage. The 1A (classical) lineage contained 1,889 viruses from 34 countries collected from 2010 to the present ( Fig. 1 and  2 ). According to our nomenclature rules, we refined the classification of 1A viruses into three second-order divisions, each of which corresponds to earlier, regional classifica- Table 2 . Each clade had an APD of Ͼ7% from other clades and an APD of Ͻ7% within the clade, although some minor exceptions were made when all other clade-defining criteria were met and mitigating circumstances supported the exception. Within-clade exceptions were made for the first-order 1A.1 (APD, 7.8%) and the extensive 1A.1.1 second-order clade (APD, 9.5%) that represented multiple monophyletic clades of viruses that individually did not meet our criteria for further division based on the number of recent sequences. The exception to the Ͼ7% distance between-clade threshold was associated with clades nested within 1A Clade designations for 1B (human seasonal) swine lineage. The 1B (human seasonal) lineage contained 1,447 viruses from 13 countries collected from 2010 to the present ( Fig. 1 and 2 ). Applying our nomenclature rules led to two second-order divisions corresponding to established clades: the 1B.1 viruses, related to a reassortant H1N2 virus that emerged in Great Britain in 1994 (n ϭ 132, 7 European countries) (20) , and 1B.2 viruses, related to the "␦-1 H1" and "␦-2 H1" viruses (n ϭ 1,315, 6 countries) (22) . We defined two third-order 1B. The 1B.2 clade contained two third-order clades that corresponded to previously described "␦-2 H1" (1B.2.1) and "␦-1 H1" (1B.2.2) clades. Based on average pairwise distances, and a large number of viruses, the third-order 1B.2.2 clade met the criteria for further subdivision into 1B.2.2.1 (n ϭ 360) and 1B.2.2.2 (n ϭ 636). In addition to these named subdivisions, the 1B.2 clade from 2010 to the present contained sporadic human-to-swine transmission episodes (n ϭ 7) in Argentina, Chile (36), China, Mexico, and Vietnam; these spillovers did not warrant the designation of a clade either due to failure to establish in swine populations or due to insufficient numbers to meet our criteria. Similarly, 1B.2.2 (22) included viruses collected from spatially isolated swine populations in Argentina and Brazil (23) and in Mexico that represent human-to-swine transmission episodes, but the number of viruses is too low to be able to confidently infer a separate clade. To link these viruses to their source population and maintain flexibility should additional surveillance detect more samples, we classified these viruses as "Other-Human." The 1B human seasonal lineage within-and between-clade APDs are presented in Table 3 . For the most part, each clade had an APD of Ͼ7% from other clades and almost all had an APD of Ͻ7% within the clade. The within-clade exceptions were the 1B.1 and 1B.2 clades (APD, 9.9% and 7.5%, respectively). The 1B.1 second-order clade (n ϭ 5) had too few representative sequences to calculate genetic distance, and 1B.2 represented multiple monophyletic clades that individually did not meet our criteria for further division. Similarly, the extensive 1B.1.1 clade (APD, 7.8%) did not meet criteria for further splitting. The exception to the between-clade threshold was associated with clades nested within 1B.2.2 (1B.2. 2.1 and 1B.2.2.2) . These third-order clade designations were made because of the considerable number of viruses in 1B.2.2 (n ϭ 1,016 from 2010 to present), strong bootstrap support (100%), and moderate between-clade support (APDs of 6.4% and 5.8%, respectively). Clade designations for 1C (Eurasian avian) swine lineage. The 1C (Eurasian avian) lineage consisted of 315 viruses from 14 countries collected from 2010 to the present ( Fig. 1 and 2 n ϭ 127) in China and South Korea. Avian H1 HA sequences were generally restricted to two monophyletic clades distinct from, but sister to, the 1C swine viruses: these HA sequences were defined as "Other-Avian." The within-and between-clade APDs are presented in Table 4 . For the most part, each clade had an APD of Ͼ7% from other clades and an APD of Ͻ7% within the clade. The one within-clade exception in this lineage was 1C.2 (APD, 7.9%), which had multiple monophyletic subclades without adequate statistical support to further divide the data. 1 1B.1.1 1B.1.2 1B.1.2.1 1B.1.2.2 1B.1.2.3 1B.2 1B.2.1 1B.2.2 1B.2 Consistency of proposed classifications. The clades identified by these global phylogenetic analyses and pairwise-distance criteria were consistently segregated by different phylogenetic approaches and with randomly subsampled data sets. While tree topology varied slightly between Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods, the monophyletic grouping and bootstrap support (or posterior probability) were consistent. There were a number of minor discrepancies in our classification (n ϭ 7 or 0.28% of the randomly subsampled 2,528 viruses [see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material]). Of the 7, 1 HA was incorrectly classified (i.e., 1A.2 virus classified to 1A.3), 1 HA was incorrectly assigned to a lower-order division (1A.1 virus was placed in the 1A.1.2 clade), and the remaining 5 viruses were incorrectly assigned to a higher-order division (1A.3.3 classified to 1A.3). Automated classification of swine H1 hemagglutinin sequences. The representative phylogeny used for classifying global swine sequences contained 239 H1 viruses of predominantly swine origin, with a few H1 viruses from human and avian hosts to represent the diversity of nonswine H1 viruses. The swine viruses were selected to capture the diversity within each of the defined clades. We used this algorithm to classify all sequences in the final data set of 7,070 IAV HA/H1 sequences from swine, avian, and human hosts, described in Materials and Methods. The classifier ascribed the correct clade in all but 41 instances. Of these 41 sequences, three from clade 1A.3.3.1 were incorrectly assigned clade 1A.3.3. The remaining 38 sequences were assigned a "-like" classification very close to the correct value. For example, five 1A.1 swine sequences were assigned the classification "1A.1-like." One 1C.2.1 swine sequence was assigned the classification "1C.2-like." Overall, the classifier was highly accurate in correctly capturing the classifications assigned by the earlier expert phylogenetic curation. Thus, this tool will be valuable for rapidly assigning the appropriate, biologically meaningful clade to new viruses not studied in our analyses. Its implementation on the web, through IRD (http://www.fludb.org), will allow classification of novel sequences to be carried out in clinical or diagnostic settings.
