To evaluate siRNA approach for SPAG9 gene silencing, we identified two independent sets of siRNA target sequences within ORF region of SPAG9 according to the criteria used in earlier studies [17] . Briefly, we inserted DNA fragments that acted as template for the synthesis of small RNAs under the control of mouse U6 promoter that directs the synthesis of a Pol III-specific RNA transcripts. The resulting RNA is composed of a single RNA that forms a stem-loop structure in which the sense and antisense strands form the stem of the hairpin (Fig. 1A) . Termination of transcription at a stretch of thymidine bases is predicted to generate a 2-4 bp uridine-nucleotide overhang at the 3 0 end, identical with the overhang that is normally produced by the Dicer enzyme. To investigate siRNA-mediated gene silencing, we first analyzed the effectiveness of gfp siRNA (BS/U6/gfp) in suppressing chimeric (SPAG9 fused with GFP) expression. COS-1 cells transfected with SPAG9-GFP revealed strong fluorescence after 48 h of transfection demonstrating GFP (green, Fig. 1B ) as well as SPAG9 (red, Fig. 1B ) expression in the same cells. Further, to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of BS/U6/gfp, SPAG9-GFP was cotransfected with the empty vector BS/U6 or BS/U6/gfp, respectively, with a ratio of 1:20 (target versus effector plasmids). The data indicated that empty vector BS/U6 had no effect on SPAG9-GFP expression (Fig. 1C) , whereas BS/U6/gfp greatly reduced the expression of SPAG9-GFP to near background levels as shown in Fig. 1C . Subsequently, two independent sets of SPAG9-specific siRNAs were evaluated for their effectiveness in inhibiting chimeric SPAG9 expression. A constant dose of 0.5 lg SPAG9-GFP was cotransfected with increasing concentrations of siRNAs ranging from 0.5 to 6.0 lg (Fig. 2) . No appreciable difference in fluorescence intensity of the cells treated with 0.5 and 1.5 lg BS/U6/spag9 was observed under fluorescence microscope ( Fig. 2A) . In comparison, a higher dose of 3.0 lg BS/U6/spag9 resulted in diffused fluorescence in the treated cells indicating the inhibition of SPAG9-GFP expression ( Fig. 2A) . The strongest inhibition of SPAG9-GFP expression was observed with a concentration of 6 lg BS/U6/spag9 as demonstrated by abrogation of reporter (GFP) gene expression in the transfected cells ( Fig. 2A) . In these experiments, treatment with BS/U6/spag9 showed a greater impact than BS/U6/spag9-I on ablation of SPAG9 expression (data not shown). Hence, the subsequent experiments were restricted to siRNA BS/ U6/spag9. A more accurate assessment of dose-dependent inhibition of chimeric SPAG9 expression was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACs) analysis. COS-1 cells were transfected with 0.5 lg SPAG9-GFP and increasing concentrations of BS/U6/spag9 ranging from 0.5 to 6.0 lg. The percentile fluorescence intensity in the treated cells is indicated by marker1 as compared to the control (only COS-1 cells), which is indicated by marker 2. The expression of SPAG9-GFP in the presence of empty vector BS/U6 revealed a fluorescence intensity of 78.37% as compared to 0.11% in the control cells (Fig. 2B ). Further the fluorescence intensity of SPAG9-GFP was measured in the presence of different concentrations of BS/U6/spag9. The results indicated a positive correlation between target gene (SPAG9-GFP) versus effector siRNA (BS/U6/spag9) ratio and the suppression of SPAG9-GFP expression as shown in Fig. 2B . The fluorescence intensity decreased drastically to 2.42% in the cells treated with 6.0 lg of BS/ U6/spag9 (Fig. 2B ) as compared to 78.37% fluorescence intensity of SPAG9-GFP alone, indicating the effective and dose-dependent suppression of SPAG9-GFP expression using RNAi approach. Our initial experiments established that BS/U6/spag9 is capable of inducing siRNA-mediated gene silencing, therefore we intended to assess the specificity of BS/U6/spag9. An independent experiment involving cotransfection of pcDNA-SPAG9 and pEGFPN2 with BS/U6 or BS/U6/ gfp or BS/U6/spag9, respectively, was performed into COS-1 cells. Results indicated that BS/U6/gfp had no effect on SPAG9 expression (Fig. 3C) , whereas a reduced expression was observed in GFP expressing cells (Fig. 3D) . In contrast, a reduction in SPAG9 (Fig. 3E ), but not in GFP (Fig. 3F) (Figs. 4B and D) . However, BS/U6/spag9 resulted in remarkable reduction in the expression of SPAG9 (Fig. 4E ) without affecting JNK-3 expression (Fig. 4F) . The results thereby demonstrate that the BS/U6/spag9-mediated specific gene silencing of SPAG9 without any effect on the expression of unrelated genes. Therefore, as previously published [18] , our results confirm the efficiency and specificity of the siRNA silencing strategy. The inhibition of SPAG9-GFP expression at the protein level was also analyzed by Western blotting using anti-SPAG9 antibody. In a dose-dependent experiment, cells cotransfected with SPAG9-GFP and BS/U6/spag9 demon-strated a gradual decrease in the expression of SPAG9-GFP with the increasing concentrations of BS/U6/spag9 ranging from 0.5 to 6.0 lg (Fig. 5A) . Intriguingly, 6.0 lg pBS/U6/spag9 resulted in remarkable suppression of the SPAG9-GFP expression (Fig. 5A) . In contrast, the treatment with BS/U6/spag9-I did not reveal decrease in the expression of SPAG9-GFP with increasing concentrations (Fig. 5A) . To further strengthen the results, the expression of SPAG9-GFP was evaluated in the presence of BS/U6/ gfp or BS/U6/spag9, respectively. No detectable expression of SPAG9-GFP was observed in either BS/U6/spag9 or BS/U6/gfp treated cells (Fig. 5B ) as compared to the cells treated with empty vector BS/U6 (Fig. 5B ). In addition, the specific knockdown of SPAG9 expression was investigated by cotransfecting 0.5 lg pcDNA-SPAG9 with BS/U6/spag9 (6 lg) or BS/U6/gfp (10 lg) or empty vector BS/U6 (10 lg) into COS-1 cells. In Western blot analysis, a drastic knockdown of SPAG9 expression was observed in BS/U6/spag9 treated cells (Fig. 5C) , whereas the cells treated with BS/U6 or BS/U6/gfp revealed no inhibition in SPAG9 expression (Fig. 5C) .
