To identify the virion proteins of CIV, the proteins of purified virion particles were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Staining of the gel with colloidal blue revealed at least 21 proteins ranging from 10 to 250 kDa ( Fig. 1 ) much in line to what has been found previously Devauchelle, 1979, 1985; Cerutti and Devauchelle, 1985; Kelly and Tinsley, 1972; Orange and Devauchelle, 1987) . The gel lane was divided into 6 slices containing proteins with a molecular mass lower than 26 kDa, ranging from 26-34 kDa, 34-43 kDa, 43-55 kDa or 55-95 kDa and higher than 95 kDa, respectively. The proteins were digested with trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. A decoy database strategy (Elias and Gygi, 2007) was used which, after applying the appropriate filters, Virology 405 (2010) 253-258 resulted in 89 protein hits: 54 CIV proteins, 34 contaminants and 1 decoy hit giving a False Discovery Rate of 1.1%. Out of the 54 CIV proteins, 46 of the more abundant proteins were identified with 2 or more peptides (Table 1) , while relatively small proteins like ORFs 342R, 227L or 104L as well as some less abundant proteins could be identified with one peptide only ( Table 2) . The proteins with one hit were manually verified to correlate well to the theoretical b+y ion spectrum and to be unique for one protein only (see also Supplementary Material S1). The proteins identified are indicated in Fig. 1 . A genomic map of CIV ORFs that encode polypeptides represented in the proteome of CIV particles is shown in Fig. 2 . For individual CIV virion proteins, 2.7% to 70% of the amino acid sequence was covered with peptides retrieved from the analysis. The major capsid protein (MCP) encoded by ORF 274L is one of the most abundant CIV proteins Devauchelle, 1979, 1985; Cerutti and Devauchelle, 1985; Kelly and Tinsley, 1972) and this is clearly reflected by its relative abundance in the current analysis compared to all other CIV proteins ( Table 1 ). The nature of the other major band is not clear at this moment. Functional domains alluding to possible functions were found in fifteen other identified virion proteins, including three putative serine/ threonine kinases (ORFs 209R, 380R and 439R), one dual specificity phosphatase (123R), a protein with homology to the N-terminal domain of viral DNA polymerases (232R), carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase (355R), nucleoside triphosphatase (NTP I) (22L), fasciclin (96L), ribonuclease III (142R), tyrosine protein kinase (179R), cathepsin (361L), DNA binding protein (401R), protein disulfide isomerase (453L), lysosome associate membrane glycoprotein (061R), and a ranavirus envelope protein homolog (118L). For the 38 remaining proteins in the virion, we have no clear idea about their specific function at this moment (Tables 1 and 2). Some of these show partial homology to viral proteins of poxvirus, coronavirus or baculovirus origin. Recent cryoelectron microscopy studies on the capsid of CIV revealed, in addition to MCP, a group of relatively less abundant capsid proteins (Yan et al., 2009 ). These proteins form a complex which contains a "finger" protein, a "zip" protein, a pentameric complex and an anchor protein. The molecular mass estimations for the finger and zip proteins, the anchor protein and the monomer of the pentameric complex were estimated to be 19.7, 11.9, 32.4 and 39.3 kDa, respectively. For the finger protein the standard deviation was 1.5 kDa, giving a size range of 18.2-21.2 kDa (Yan et al., 2009 ). Based on this range, seven candidate genes for the finger protein were found in the CIV proteome: ORFs 234R, 111R, 096L, 374L, 325L, 203L, and 084L from large to small (Table 1 ). The zip protein with an expected size range of 10.5 to 13.3 kDa (1.4 kDa standard deviation) may correspond to three candidate ORFs represented in the proteome: 010R, 138R and 321R. The monomer of the pentameric complex estimated at 39.3 kDa corresponds most closely in size to ORFs 329R and 219L. Anchor protein candidate genes in the CIV proteome could be 457L or 142R, with sizes close to 32.4 kDa (Table 1) .
