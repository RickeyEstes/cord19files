Different modalities of mechanical ventilation affect the extent of lung injury. Following the application of different modalities of mechanical ventilation, lung tissue was collected and evaluated via H&E staining, as presented in Fig. 1A . The control, LV2, LV4 and low-PIP groups exhibited a normal histology. HV2, HV4 and high-PIP groups presented an abnormal histology compared with the control group. These abnormalities included alveolar septal thickening indicative of edema formation, mononuclear cell infiltration of the alveolar walls, hemorrhage, fibrin exudation and intra-alveolar erythrocyte infiltration. To validate the VALI model in mice, total protein from BAL fluid was detected. As presented in Fig. 1B , total protein concentration in BAL fluid of LV2, LV4 and low-PIP groups did not differ from the control group. Total protein concentration in BAL fluid of HV2, HV4 and high-PIP groups was greater compared with the control group. Therefore, these observations suggested that LV2, LV4 and low-PIP modalities of mechanical ventilation are safe, whereas HV2, HV4 and high-PIP may result in lung injury.
