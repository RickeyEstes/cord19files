A total of 27 CRESS-DNA genomes were recovered from 21 marine invertebrates ( Table 1) . Most of the recovered genomes (66.7%) were identified from Crustacea, mainly from the order Decapoda. Recovered genomes ranged in size from 1063 to 2469 nt and exhibited a variety of genome architectures. Of the 27 genomes identified, 23 exhibited a common putative ori marked by a conserved nonanucleotide motif (NANTATTAC) at the apex of a predicted stem-loop structure ( Table 1) . The remaining four genomes lacked a stem-loop structure (n = 2) or a stem-loop structure and a nonanucleotide motif (n = 2). Genomes lacking the canonical nonanucleotide motif could not be assigned to any genome type; therefore only 25 genomes were assigned to genomic architecture types previously described by Rosario et al. (2012a) (Figure 1) . The predominant genomic architecture observed was Type I (n = 13), which is typical of members of the Circovirus genus. However, other genomic architectures were observed including Types II (n = 5), III (n = 1), IV (n = 1), V (n = 3), and VII (n = 2) (Figure 1) . It is important to note that genomes exhibiting a Type VII genome architecture only exhibit a single major ORF encoding a Rep. This type of architecture is observed in genomic components of multipartite viruses from the Nanoviridae family and satellite DNA molecules that require helper viruses for encapsidation (Gronenborn, 2004; Briddon and Stanley, 2006) . Therefore genomes exhibiting only a single major ORF may represent partial genomes of multipartite viruses or non-viral mobile genetic elements such as plasmids (Rosario et al., 2012a) . The majority of the CRESS-DNA viruses detected in marine invertebrates were most similar to viral sequences identified through metagenomic surveys of marine samples (Supplementary Table S1 ). However, one of genomes, Lytechinus variegatus variable sea urchin associated circular virus_I0021, was most similar to plant viruses from the Geminiviridae family. Most of the viral genomes had database similarities for the Rep; except for Sicyonia brevirostris brown rock shrimp associated circular virus_I0722, which only had similarities for the putative Cap (Supplementary Table S1 ). Similar to several previously described CRESS-DNA viruses (Li et al., 2010a; Rosario et al., 2012b; van den Brand et al., 2012; Sikorski et al., 2013b; Du et al., 2014; Ng et al., 2014; Dayaram et al., 2015a,b; Kraberger et al., 2015) , three viral genomes (Artemia melana sponge associated circular virus_I0307, Didemnum sp. sea squirt associated circular virus_I0026_A7, and Palaemonetes kadiakensis Mississippi grass shrimp associated circular virus_I0099) exhibited Reps interrupted by introns (Supplementary Table S1 ). FIGURE 1 | Genome types of novel CRESS-DNA genomes identified in this study (Rosario et al., 2012a) . Genome schematics illustrate a major ORF encoding the replication initiator protein (Rep), putative origin of replication (ori) marked by stem-loop structure, and a second major ORF.
