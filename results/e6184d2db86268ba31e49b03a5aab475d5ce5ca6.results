Three sets of CO1 sequences were used; the details of which are available via the Internet [7, 8] . The "CO1-animal" data was from 96 species of animals representing the seven dominant phyla of animals, the "CO1-insect" data was from 92 species of insects representing eight of the largest orders of insects and the "CO1-moth" data was from 201 species from three superfamilies of moths found near Guelph, Canada. After being aligned using ClustalX [9] with default parameters, the same region was selected from all three datasets for analysis; see Methods. The selected regions, the "test-sequences", were 604, 603 and 595 nucleotides long respectively in the three sets. Comparable random test-sequence datasets were constructed. The three sets differed greatly in diversity: the CO1-animal set was the most diverse with an average nucleotide difference, ignoring positions that had gaps for alignment, between all pairs of sequences of 35.2% (S.D. 8.3%) with a range from 12.4% to 57%; the CO1-insect set had a mean nucleotide difference of 22.2% (S.D. 4.2%) with a range from 7.4% to 39.5%, and the CO1-moth set had a mean difference of 12.9% (S.D. 1.9%) with a range from 1.0% to 19.4%. Random sequence datasets were constructed that matched the length and average nucleotide composition of each test-sequence dataset, and had mean nucleotide differences of 72.1% to 73.3% (S.D. 1.8% to 1.9%). The CO1-animal sequences yielded a pool of 112,800 sub-sequences 6 nts long that included all replicates. Pools of sub-sequences up to 31 nts long were also produced and these were, of course, a little smaller. The CO1-insect sequences produced pools that were almost the same size, whereas those from the larger CO1-moth dataset were about twice as large.
