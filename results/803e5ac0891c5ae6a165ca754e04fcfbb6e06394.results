Spatial characteristics of H7N9 cases and H5N1 cases. As the temperature varied heterogeneously in gradients in different provinces, we classified the affected provinces into the three commonly used geographical sectors that have similar meteorological characteristics: South (south area of the Yangtze River), Central (the Yellow River to the south and the Yangtze River to the north), and North China (north area of the Yellow River). South China is comprised of Guangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces, Central China is comprised of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Shanghai, and Zhejiang provinces, and North China is comprised of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Liaoning provinces, as well as Beijing and Tianjin (municipal cities). As shown in Table 1 , the H5N1 influenza infection cases mainly occurred in South, Central, and Northwest China, with the most (eight cases) in Hunan Province. In contrast to H5N1, the occurrence of H7N9 in mainland China was concentrated in the coastal areas of South China. Climatic characteristics of H7N9 cases and H5N1 cases. To understand the discrepancies in climate factors between H7N9 and H5N1 infections, the null hypothesis was tested using the T-test. As shown in Table 2 , the p-values for RHU.mean, PRS.mean, and WIN.mean were < 0.05. These results imply that there were significant differences between H7N9 and H5N1 infections in terms of humidity, pressure, and wind speed. H5N1 infections occurred with the highest frequency in a humidity range of 60-70%, while H7N9 infections occurred in the 70-80% rage (Fig. 1B) . In terms of atmospheric pressure, the cases of H5N1 were concentrated at 990-1020 kPa, while the occurrences of H7N9 infection were found at 1000-1030 kPa (Fig. 1C ). In addition, as the composition of meteorological factors, the wind speed during H5N1 cases was concentrated at 1-2 m/s, while the occurrences of H7N9 infection were found at 2-3 m/s wind speed (Fig. 1F ). Temperature and specific humidity were the best individual influence factors for influenza infection. According to null hypothesis 1, both the mean value of the air temperature and the mean value of the ground surface temperature displayed no significant difference comparing H5N1 and H7N9 infections. H5N1 influenza occurred with the highest frequency in a temperature range of 5-10 °C, with a second peak in the range of 15-20 °C. H7N9 influenza occurred with the highest frequency in a temperature range of 10-15 °C, with a second peak in the interval of 5-10 °C. Consistent with the TEM value, the H5N1 influenza infection cases were relatively more prevalent when the ground surface temperature was 5-10 °C, with a second peak at 15-20 °C; H7N9 influenza infection cases peaked at 10-15 °C and 5-10 °C, respectively (Fig. 1A,D) .
