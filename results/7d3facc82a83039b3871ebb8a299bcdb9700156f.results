Structure of the USP9X CD. USP9X is a large protein of over 2,500 aa, with little domain annotation outside the CD (Fig. 1A) . The crystal structure of the USP9X CD (amino acids 1,551-1,970) was solved at 2.5-Å resolution in space group P2 1 using the USP7 CD as a molecular replacement search model. The asymmetric unit contains four copies of USP9X that show a noncrystallographic pseudo C2 symmetry. Electron density for residues 1,593-1,631, 1,839-1,858, 1,891-1,895, and 1,959-1,960 of chain A and similar regions in chains B, C, and D is not observed, and these regions are presumably disordered ( Fig. 1 A and B) . Chain A in the asymmetric unit was used in structural analysis unless otherwise specified. A Dali search (25) revealed the core structure of USP9X is closest to the USP7 CD, with an rmsd of about 2.4 Å over 350 aligned amino acids and a z-score of 34. The overall structure represents a canonical USP fold, comprising thumb, palm, and fingers subdomains (Fig. 1B) . Additional features common to other USP CDs are also found in USP9X. For example, the tip of the fingers subdomain contains a CHC2-type ZnF motif with a zinc ion coordinated by residues Cys1727, His1729, Cys1771, and Cys1774 arranged in a tetrahedron (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A ). Unexpectedly, a nearby Cys1724 is not involved, as seen in other known USP structures, where the zinc is coordinated by four cysteines. Structural alignment of USP9X with a USP7/Ub-aldehyde covalent complex (PDB ID code 1NBF) reveals that the catalytic triad (Cys1566, His1879, Asp1901) superimposes well with the catalytic triad of USP7 in the active conformation (Fig. 1C) . Notably, a Gln1683 residue is positioned close (3.6 Å) to the catalytic Cys1566 in the apo structure (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B ). It must adopt a different rotamer conformation to accommodate the C terminus of a Ub substrate as observed for an equivalent Gln293 in the USP7-Ub complex structure (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C ). Interestingly, Gln1683 is conserved among USP DUBs and often with a juxtaposed second Gln residue. Close to the active site, USP9X contains two blocking loops, BL1 (1,801-1,810) connecting β13 and β14 and BL2 (1,872-1,879) connecting β16 and β17 ( Fig. 1B and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ), similar to those in USP7 (5) (6) (7) 26 ) that form the binding cleft for the C-terminal tail of Ub. A unique USP9X β-hairpin insertion is located next to the two blocking loops (Fig. 1B) , suggesting the insertion may have some effect on the recognition of the Ub tail. Interestingly, a loop connecting helices α4 and α5, which corresponds to the switching loop of USP7 (6), is 2 aa longer than that of USP7, and protrudes into space otherwise occupied by the C-terminal activating tail in USP7 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D ). The extension may exclude a regulatory mechanism similar to that of USP7 (6) . The USP9X CD contains three large insertions in the sequence. Two of them are located at the common insertion points of the core domain (2) . A 39-aa insertion (1,593-1,631) between boxes 1 and 2 (helices α2 and α3), and a 22-aa insertion (1,838-1,859) between boxes 4 and 5 (helix α8 and strand β16) ( Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ) cannot be traced in the electron density map and are presumably disordered. The importance of these loops remains unclear, but a high percentage of negatively charged Asp and Glu residues in the α2-α3 loop may be of significance. A third 20-aa insertion (1,924-1,943) between α9 and β22 within box 6 forms an unexpected β-hairpin structure in the palm subdomain of the USP fold. Sequence alignment revealed the β-hairpin insertion is completely conserved among USP9X from different species, as well as in the related USP9Y, whereas the two other insertions are not (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ). This suggests the β-hairpin insertion may be functionally important. Analysis of the evolutionary conservation profile of USP9X CD using ConSurf algorithm (27) indicates the active site, the Ub C-terminal tail binding region, and a patch of the fingers subdomain, are highly conserved (SI Appendix, Fig. S3) . A survey of USP domain structural features reveals the ZnF and β-hairpin insertion in USP9X may be functionally significant (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 ). Both USP9X and the K63 and M1 dualspecific USP, CYLD, have a large insertion within sequence box 6. The insertion in CYLD forms helices/bend structural elements (28) located next to the two blocking loops and also extends a β-hairpin in the palm subdomain that contributes to proximal Ub recognition (8) . Similarly, the insertion in USP9X may also be involved in polyUb chain specificity. Furthermore, the fingers subdomain of some USPs is known to bind to a distal Ub of a polyUb chain, as shown in the USP21-linear diUb complex (9) . Based on structural modeling and comparison with other USPs, we postulate that the USP9X CD may harbor three Ub binding sites (S2, S1, and S1′) (Fig. 1B) and cleave a polyUb chain linkage-dependently. DUB Activity of USP9X. We first measured the DUB activity of USP9X CD against fluorogenic 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)-derived Ub and Ub-like modifiers (UBLs). Unlike some other USPs that show cross-activities toward UBLs, such as SUMO and ISG15 (29, 30) , USP9X is only active toward Ub, with no measurable activity for SUMO1-, NEDD8-, or ISG15-AMC (Fig. 1D ). Using the Ub-AMC substrate, we determined the kinetic parameters for USP9X CD with k cat = 0.25 ± 0.01 min −1 and K m = 0.10 ± 0.02 μM (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A and Table S1 ). The k cat and K m of USP9X CD are vastly different from those of the USP7 CD (k cat = 4.6 min −1 and K m = 44.2 μM) (31) . The specificity constant (k cat /K m ) of USP9X (2.5 min −1 μM −1 ) is 25-fold higher than that of USP7 CD (0.10 min −1 μM −1 ). We next assessed the activity of USP9X CD toward eight diUb substrates of different linkages. USP9X CD displayed various cleavage efficiencies, with a preference for K11-, K63-, K48-, and K6-linkages ( Fig. 1E and SI Appendix, Fig. S5B ). Low level of cleavage was observed for K27-, K29-, and K33-diUbs and no cleavage observed for M1-linked diUb (Fig. 1E) . We further assessed the cleavage of K6-, K11-, K63-, K48-linked tetraUb substrates and observed that K11-linked tetraUb was processed more efficiently than K63-or K48-linked chains, with poor cleavage of K6-linked tetraUb (SI Appendix, Fig. S5C ). PolyUb Probes for Interrogating USPs. ABPs capture DUBs in action. To study the three potential binding sites of USP9X, we generated a set of ABPs. We systematically name the ABPs based on the chemical bond subjected to DUB cleavage, which can be a cleavable native peptide bond (CL), a noncleavable linker (NC), a Michael acceptor (MA) warhead, or the abbreviation of a specific reactive group, followed by a number to indicate the location of the bond of interest. We previously reported K48-and K63-diUb probes with an internal MA (32) , which are now denoted K48-or K63-diUb-MA1. In this study, we additionally generated K6-and K11-diUb-MA1 ABPs (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 ). These diUb-MA1 ABPs interrogate the Ub binding to the S1 site and a potential S1′ (proximal) site in the DUB catalytic core. To probe the Ub binding at a potential S2 site in DUBs, we prepared K6-, K11-, K48-, and K63-linked diUb probes that contain an NC linker (33) and a terminal propargylamine (PA) warhead (diUb-NC1-PA2) ( Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S6 ). For enzymatic kinetics quantification, we generated fluorogenic AMC derivatives of diUbs (diUb-NC1-AMC2) ( Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S7 ). We also designed and synthesized two classes of hybrid triUb probes ( Fig. 2B and SI Appendix, Fig. S8 ) (see Methods for details). TriUb-NC1-CL2 (Fig. 2B ) ensures that DUB-catalyzed cleavage only occurs when the middle Ub binds to the DUB S1 site, while the distal and proximal Ubs occupy the potential S2 and S1′ sites, respectively. TriUb-MA1-CL2 (Fig. 2B ) differentiates two binding modes in one assay. If the DUB S1 site engages the middle Ub of a triUb-MA1-CL2, we expect a cleavage at the native isopeptide bond to produce a diUb-MA1 and a Ub. If the DUB S1 site engages the distal Ub, we expect labeling of the DUB active site cysteine by the probe's MA that gives a triUb conjugated product. These ABPs were synthesized and the identity characterized by mass spectrometry (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 ). The USP9X Zinc-Finger Is a Crucial Structural Motif. A ZnF motif in the fingers subdomain is found in many USPs, although its function is not entirely clear. The ZnF of USP21 is important for binding the distal Ub in a linear diUb (SI Appendix, Fig. S9A ) as well as the distal UBL domain in ISG15 (9) . To evaluate the role Crystal structure of the USP9X CD. The fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains are colored blue, orange, and green, respectively. The β-hairpin insertion (Ins3) is salmon-colored, and the two blocking loops are colored in red. Residues in the catalytic triad and the ZnF are shown in sticks. The zinc ion is shown as a sphere. S2, S1, and S1′ indicate three potential Ub binding sites. (C) Superposition of the USP9X and USP7/Ub-aldehyde (PDB ID code 1NBF) structures. Ub-aldehyde is shown in surface and ribbon representations (red), whereas USP7 (teal) and USP9X (orange) are shown in ribbon. (Right) A zoomed-in view of the overlay of the active sites of USP7 and USP9X. The catalytic triad residues in USP9X and USP7 and Ub Gly76 are labeled. (D) Activity assay using fluorogenic substrates showing that USP9X CD hydrolyzes Ub-AMC substrate efficiently but not SUMO1-, NEDD8-, or ISG15-AMC. (E) Gel-based cleavage assay of the USP9X CD using native M1-, K6-, K11-, K27-, K29-, K33-, K48-, and K63-diUb substrates. of the ZnF of USP9X, we mutated residues chelating the zinc ion, C1727A, or H1729A, and measured their activities. For Ub-AMC substrate, the C1727A and H1729A mutants showed a five-and sevenfold increase in K m compared with WT, respectively, without substantial change in k cat (SI Appendix, Fig.  S9B and Table S1 ). We next used internally quenched fluorescence (IQF)-diUb substrates of K11-and K63-linkage to monitor the continuous isopeptide cleavage and observed reduced cleavage activity of the C1727A mutant (SI Appendix, Fig. S9C ), again supporting the importance of the ZnF in the S1 site Ub binding. This is also consistent with the reduced labeling of the ZnF mutants by monoUb-based ABP (SI Appendix, Fig. S10A ). To measure the effect of the ZnF on S2-S1 diUb binding, we interrogated the USP9X CD using diUb-NC1-PA2 ( Fig. 2A) and observed reduced labeling of the ZnF mutants compared with WT at a single time point (2 h) by K6-, K11-, and K48-probes, but with little change for the K63-linked probe (SI Appendix, Fig.  S10B ). To confirm the result, a time-dependent labeling was carried out. The results show a clear reduction in the labeling efficiency for the K11-diUb-NC1-PA2 probe but little change for the K63-diUb probe (SI Appendix, Fig. S10C ). These results reveal that the ZnF in USP9X plays an important role in chain linkage-specific recognition of diUb. Role of the USP9X β-Hairpin Insertion on Catalysis. An insertion in CYLD sequence box 6 is important for the recognition of the proximal Ub in M1-and K63-diUbs (8) . The insertion in box 6 of the USP9X CD could play a similar role. Unlike the CYLD insertion that is partially disordered in the apo structure and induced into an extended β-hairpin upon substrate binding (8, 28) , the USP9X β-hairpin insertion is ordered in the apo structure. Crystal packing analysis revealed the β-hairpin pairs with the β-strands of the fingers subdomain of a symmetry-related molecule (SI Appendix, Fig. S11A ). Secondary structure (34) and disorder (35) predictions suggest this insertion has no strong propensity to adopt an α-helix, β-strand, or disordered conformation (SI Appendix, Fig.  S11 B and C) . This implicates that the observed conformation of the β-hairpin could have been influenced by crystal packing, and it may adopt a different conformation upon substrate binding. Structure overlay of USP9X CD with CYLD CD in complex with diUb (PDB ID code 3WXE) shows that the USP9X β-hairpin is close to, but on the opposite side of a modeled S1′ Ub compared with the CYLD β-hairpin (Fig. 3A) . To understand the role of the USP9X β-hairpin insertion, we generated a deletion mutant Δ (1924) (1925) (1926) (1927) (1928) (1929) (1930) (1931) (1932) (1933) (1934) (1935) (1936) (1937) (1938) (1939) (1940) (1941) (1942) (1943) and assessed its activity. We only observed a slight change of the mutant in k cat and K m toward Ub-AMC (SI Appendix, Table S1 ), and monoUb-based Ub-PA probe labeling compared with WT (SI Appendix, Fig. S12  A and B) . Furthermore, labeling with diUb-NC1-PA2 probes, which measures S2-S1 binding, also only showed slightly reduced labeling efficiency for the deletion mutant (SI Appendix, Fig.  S12C ). Together, these observations suggest that removal of the β-hairpin insertion has a minimal impact on S2-S1 Ub binding. We next accessed S1-S1′ site engagement using diUb-MA1 probes. The WT USP9X CD is most strongly labeled by K48-followed by K63-and K11-diUb-MA1 probes, but not by K6-diUb-MA1 in the time frame treated (1 h) (SI Appendix, Fig. S12D ). Labeling of USP9X Δ (1924) (1925) (1926) (1927) (1928) (1929) (1930) (1931) (1932) (1933) (1934) (1935) (1936) (1937) (1938) (1939) (1940) (1941) (1942) (1943) showed similar linkage preference (SI Appendix, Fig. S12D ). Using a gel-based DUB assay, the deletion mutant showed reduced cleavage of K11-, K48-, and K63-linked diUb (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B ) and triUb substrates (SI Appendix, Fig. S12E ) compared with WT. To quantify the activity, we used the IQF-diUb substrates for continuous monitoring of diUb cleavage. With K11and K63-linked IQF-diUb, the β-hairpin deletion reduced the cleavage efficiency significantly (Fig. 3B) . Overall, the β-hairpin insertion is important for the S1-S1′ cleavage activity. Labeling by K11 DiUb-MA1 Probe Reveals the Reactivity of a Noncatalytic Cysteine. In the WT USP9X CD labeling experiment with diUb-MA1 probes of different linkages, we observed an interesting difference in the labeling pattern. As expected, the K48and K63-diUb-MA1 probes yield one upshifted product band. Surprisingly, with the K11-diUb-MA1 probe, we observed two labeling bands with comparable intensities (Fig. 3C) , which we denoted HMW and LMW bands (for high-and low-molecular weights). To understand the nature of the labeling products, we subjected the HMW and LMW bands to tryptic digestion and MS/ MS analysis. The results suggest that conjugation of Cys1808 on Notably, when the C1566S mutant was incubated with HA-Ubvinyl methyl ester (VME), which bears the same MA as that in the diUb-MA1 probes, no labeling band was observed (Fig. 4B) . This indicates the proximal Ub in the K11-diUb-MA1 is required for the alternate labeling of Cys1808 in USP9X CD. We also subjected the ZnF mutant C1727A and the β-hairpin deletion mutant Δ (1924) (1925) (1926) (1927) (1928) (1929) (1930) (1931) (1932) (1933) (1934) (1935) (1936) (1937) (1938) (1939) (1940) (1941) (1942) (1943) to the same labeling assay with a K11 diUb-MA1 probe. Interestingly, of the two labeling bands, the LMW band was diminished for the ZnF mutant (Fig. 4A) . The opposite was observed for the deletion mutant Δ(1924-1943) with a reduced HMW band. We generated a Q1683A mutation to unblock the access to the catalytic triad (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C ) and subjected the mutant to labeling with the K11-diUb-MA1 probe. Notably, the LMW band (labeling of catalytic Cys1566) showed a more increased intensity than the HMW band (SI Appendix, Fig. S13A ), suggesting improved access to the active site. The Q1683A mutant also showed a large increase in K m and little decrease in k cat for Ub-AMC substrate compared with the WT (SI Appendix, Fig. S13B and Table S1 ). However, no significant change in k cat and K m values was observed for the IQF-K11-diUb substrate (SI Appendix, Fig. S13C ). USP9X Displays Linkage-Specific Endo-and Exo-DUB Activities. The multiple Ub binding sites and linkage specificity of USP9X CD prompted us to investigate its endo-and exo-Ub chain cleavage activity. Using the diUb-NC1-AMC2 substrates ( Fig.  2A) , we performed a kinetic analysis of S2-S1 diUb cleavage and found that USP9X CD possesses robust endo-DUB activity for K11-and K63-diUb substrates. USP9X CD showed a twofold higher catalytic activity (k cat /K m ) for K11-compared with K63-linked diUb-NC1-AMC2 (SI Appendix, Table S2 ). Notably, USP9X CD is much less active against K48-diUb-NC1-AMC2 with an eightfold lower k cat /K m , suggesting that the positioning of the distal Ub influences the endo-cleavage activity. We then used the hybrid triUb probes that mimic polyUb chain substrates (Fig. 2B ). Three binding modes are possible with two of them leading to chain cleavage (endo and exo) (Fig. 5A) . To probe the effect of simultaneous binding of a polyUb substrate to all three potential DUB Ub binding sites (S2, S1, and S1′, mode 1), we used the triUb-NC1-CL2 probes (Fig. 2B) , cleavage of which indicates an endo-mode. We found that USP9X CD endo-cleaved K11-and K63-triUb-NC1-CL2 into diUb and monoUb efficiently ( Fig. 5B and SI Appendix, Fig. S14 A and B) . However, little cleavage of K48 triUb-NC1-CL2 was detected ( Fig. 5B and SI Appendix, Fig. S14C ). These assays were run in parallel with native diUb substrates, and for all linkages (K11, K48, and K63) efficient cleavage by the USP9X CD was observed (SI Appendix, Fig. S14 ). We also used USP2 CD, which is permissive for different Ub chain linkages, as a comparison and observed efficient cleavage of triUb-NC1-CL2 of all three linkages (K11, K48, and K63) (SI Appendix, Fig. S14 ). Next, the triUb-MA1-CL2 probes (Fig. 2B ) were used to detect both endo-and exo-cleavage modes by DUBs in one assay. We envisioned three possible outcomes (SI Appendix, Fig. S15A ) In scenario 1, the DUB engages the triUb substrate in a binding mode that leads to endo-cleavage of the triUb-MA1-CL2 to yield di-and monoUb species. The resulting diUb-MA1 probe may in turn label the DUB. In scenario 2, the DUB engages the triUb substrate exclusively in an exo-binding mode that leads to the labeling of DUB by the triUb probe. In scenario 3, both endo-or exo-binding modes are possible, and it will lead to simultaneous cleavage of the triUb at the native isopeptide bond and labeling by the warhead in the triUb probe. For K48 triUb-MA1-CL2, we observed no cleavage by USP9X CD but a robust labeling product in a timecourse experiment (Fig. 5C ). The identity of the upshifted labeling product band was confirmed by comparison with labeling of USP9X CD using K48-diUb-MA1 probe (SI Appendix, Fig. S15B ), consistent with scenario 2. For K63-triUb-MA1-CL2, both cleavages of and labeling by the triUb were observed (Fig. 5D) , agreeing with scenario 3. For K11-triUb-MA1-CL2, a robust cleavage of the triUb probe was observed with a low level of labeling product (Fig.  5D) , suggesting a dominant scenario 2. We further compared the cleavage of K11-and K63-triUb-NC1-CL2 by WT, the ZnF mutant (C1721A), and the deletion mutant Δ(1924-1943) of USP9X CD. Although little effect was observed for the ZnF mutation, we observed a clear reduction in cleavage efficiency for the β-hairpin deletion mutant for both linkages of triUb (Fig. 5 E and F) . In contrast, the effect of the β-hairpin deletion was less pronounced toward K11-and K63-diUb substrates (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B ).
