The crystal structure of EBOV GP CL reveals the NPC1 receptorbinding site that is unmasked upon endosomal cleavage. Purified EBOV GP 1,2 ectodomains (expressed without mucin-like domains; hereinafter referred to as GP) were treated with thermolysin, which mimics host endosomal protease processing of EBOV GP (8) , in order to generate EBOV GP CL trimers for crystallization. EBOV GP CL crystallizes in the space group H3 (R3:H) with four GP monomers and four KZ52 Fabs in the asymmetric unit (ASU). The ASU contains one full GP trimer and one remaining GP monomer, which itself forms a biologically relevant trimer with two symmetry-related protomers about a crystallographic 3-fold axis. The overall changes to the tertiary structure upon cleavage of GP are minimal, reflected in a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.419 Å compared to the structure of uncleaved EBOV GP (Fig. 1A) (4) . This finding corroborates a previous model of EBOV GP CL which suggested only limited changes in the GP CL structure upon thermolysin digestion (23) . The structure of EBOV GP CL is more compact than that of EBOV GP and exhibits more stable crystal packing, less disorder, and improved resolution of X-ray diffraction over that of the previously determined uncleaved GP (4) . New regions of EBOV GP can now be visualized in the EBOV GP CL structure. These include C-terminal residues of GP 2 , the disulfide link between C53 of GP 1 and C609 of GP 2 , and an intra-GP 2 disulfide bond between C601 and C610. As EBOV GP 2 descends from the base of the GP trimer structure, it forms a tightly ordered loop structure that is stabilized by the intra-GP 2 disulfide bond between C601 and C610. This disulfide link turns the peptide chain back toward the body of GP where it is anchored to GP 1 by the C53-C609 inter-GP 1,2 disulfide bond prior to turning downward toward the transmembrane domain and viral membrane (Fig. 1B) . The most striking structural feature of GP CL is the full exposure of a charged hydrophilic crest and a large hydrophobic trough structure in immediate proximity to the GP 2 fusion loop. The trough becomes exposed upon proteolytic excision of the glycan cap from EBOV GP and is 13 Å wide, 23 Å long, and 10 Å deep (Fig. 1C) . Residues I113 and L111 form an exposed hydrophobic face inside the trough, while residues V79, T83, W86, F88, L122, V141, and I170 line the bottom of the trough. Mutation of GP residues exposed after removal of the glycan cap affects viral infectivity and binding to the filovirus receptor NPC1. Previous work utilizing scanning mutagenesis of EBOV GP identified multiple residues important for viral infectivity (24) (25) (26) . These studies were carried out prior to the availability of a crystal structure of EBOV GP (4) or GP CL (this work) and prior to identification of the endosomal receptor, NPC1 (17, 18) . Here, we map these residues onto the crystal structure of EBOV GP CL and determine whether mutations in EBOV GP that reduce infectivity specifically correlate with defects in GP CL -NPC1 binding. Previous work identified three lysines at positions 114, 115, and 140 (16, 25) and hydrophobic residues F88, L111, and L122 (25) (26) (27) for which mutation to alanine diminishes infectivity (16, 25) . These deficits in infectivity correlate with reductions in NPC1 binding, as determined by coimmunoprecipitation (28) . The crystal structure of EBOV GP CL illustrates that K114, K115, and K140 lie along the crest and F88, L111, and L122 line the trough of EBOV GP CL . These hydrophobic residues are buried in uncleaved EBOV GP (4) but become solvent exposed in the trough of EBOV GP CL . We systematically mutated residues that the GP CL crystal structure shows to be surfaceexposed after cleavage, in order to determine their importance for NPC1 binding and viral infectivity and to define the GP 1 receptor-binding site (RBS). We pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles with 73 mutant GP proteins and tested them for viral incorporation of GP relative to the incorporation of the wild-type (WT) protein, and for binding to the conformational antibody KZ52 (4, 21) , which only recognizes properly folded GP (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). The 68 VSV-GP mutants that met these quality benchmarks were then evaluated for their capacity to recognize a purified, soluble form of human NPC1 domain C in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as described previously (27, 29) . We report that WT EBOV GP CL binds to NPC1 domain C with a 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of Ϸ0.5 nM, consistent with a high-avidity binding interaction between these proteins. In comparison, we find that mutants that demonstrate reduced infectivity are also defective for binding to NPC1 domain C (see Fig. S1 and S2 in the supplemental material). Furthermore, a few single point mutations that cause drastic reductions (Ͼ10fold) in the GP CL -NPC1 domain C-binding EC 50 are located in or around the hydrophobic trough and hydrophilic crest. These mutants allow us to map those residues of EBOV GP 1 that are critical to NPC1 domain C onto the EBOV GP CL structure and to better The trimeric EBOV GP CL structure is shown, with GP 1 colored teal, GP 2 colored light blue, the fusion loop colored orange, and disulfide bonds displayed as sticks and colored gold. The former position of the glycan cap, now absent in the GP CL structure, is illustrated in semitransparent red and is derived from an alignment with the uncleaved EBOV GP structure (PDB code 3CSY). (B) Additional residues at the C terminus of GP 2 are now visible in this higher-resolution structure. These residues include C601-C608, contained within GP 2 , as well as the C53-C609 disulfide bond that cross-links GP 1 and GP 2 together. (C) The structure of EBOV GP CL is displayed to the right, with the same coloring as described for panel A. An enlarged illustration of the putative EBOV GP 1 RBS is shown to the left, in two orientations. Residues forming the hydrophilic crest and hydrophobic trough are labeled and colored green and purple, respectively. The disulfide bonds present around the crest and trough, C108-C135 and C121-C145, are colored gold. define the RBS (see Fig. S1 and S2). Interestingly, mutation to alanine of two trough residues, F88 and L111, reduces viral infectivity dramatically (by Ͼ3 log 10 units) but has more modest effects on GP CL -NPC1 binding (see Fig. S2A ). The disparity between strong reduction in infectivity but modest effect on NPC1 binding suggests that these residues may be important for steps in viral entry post-NPC1 binding and prior to membrane fusion, such as conformational changes or release of GP2. The hydrophobic trough exposed on GP1 upon endosomal cleavage is the primary binding site of NPC1 domain C. We performed further mutagenesis of the hydrophobic trough to better define its precise role. Since most of the point mutations to alanine within the hydrophobic trough had only modest effects, we postulated that replacing them with bulkier methionine residues would more completely occlude the trough and prevent GP-NPC1 binding. We selected two trough residues, T83 and I113, which did not inhibit NPC1 binding when mutated to alanine, for additional mutagenesis to methionine ( Fig. 2A and B ). To prevent misfolding or disruption of the GP structure, we engineered compensatory mutations with interacting residues of the glycan cap to fit the larger methionine residues and prevent steric clashing. We engineered the following mutants: I113M (trough)/F225A (cap), T83M (trough)/F225VϩY232F (cap), and T83MϩI113M (trough)/F225AϩY232F (cap) (Fig. 2C to E). For simplicity, since the compensatory mutations are removed along with the glycan cap upon proteolysis, we will only refer to these mutants by the mutations remaining on EBOV GP CL : T83M, I113M, and T83MϩI113M. All engineered VSV-GP mutants maintain high levels of incorporation compared to the incorporation of WT GP (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). As posited, the single T83M and I113M mutations, as well as the T83MϩI113M double mutation, lead to defects in NPC1 domain C binding and pseudovirus infectivity by GP CL bearing them ( Fig. 2A to C). We further find that a single point mutation, L122A, located in the bottom of the trough, abrogates both NPC1 domain C binding and pseudotyped virus infectivity (Fig. 2E ). The position of L122 suggests that it has a structural role; the L122A mutation may destabilize the local trough structure, preventing NPC1 binding and subsequent infectivity. Together, these findings provide evidence that supports a direct correlation between NPC1 binding and infectivity and effectively maps the GP CL trough as a critical component of the NPC1-binding site. An overall basic charge on the GP 1 crest is required for GP binding to NPC1 domain C and viral infectivity. Experiments performed prior to the identification of the filovirus endosomal receptor NPC1 demonstrated that K114A, K115A, and K140A mutations (now mapped to the GP CL crest) significantly reduce viral infectivity (16, 25) . Here, we investigated whether the observed reductions in viral infectivity from these mutations correlate with defects in binding to NPC1 domain C. We show that while the individual mutations K114A and K115A have only modest effects (see Fig. S1 and S2 in the supplemental material), the double mutation (K114AϩK115A) dramatically inhibits GP CL -NPC1 domain C binding and viral entry ( Fig. 3A and B ). In contrast, the K140A mutant showed no significant defect in viral infectivity or NPC1 domain C binding (see Fig. S2 ). To test the hypothesis that these crest residues participate in electrostatic interactions with NPC1 during virus-receptor engagement, we engineered and analyzed VSV-GPs in which these lysines were replaced with either basic or acidic residues. The K114RϩK115R double mutant, which maintains the basic charge, remains fully functional. In contrast, the K114EϩK115E double mutant, which reverses charge, displays an even greater deficit in receptorbinding function and entry activity than the neutral K114AϩK115A mutant (Fig. 3A and B) . To determine whether it is the overall charge of the site or specific basic residues within the site that are important, we mutated two glutamic acid residues in proximity to positions 114 and 115 to alanine. The resulting quadruple mutant (K114AϩK115AϩE112AϩE120A), which is predicted to have WT-like electrostatics, exhibits receptor-binding activity and infectivity at nearly WT levels ( Fig. 3A and B) . The importance of a set of basic residues but lack of a specific requirement for any one of them individually suggest a need to maintain an overall basic charge on the GP CL crest (Fig. 3C) . Neutralizing antibodies raised from a Marburg virus survivor demonstrate potential panfilovirus neutralization activity. The high degree of sequence and structural conservation in the NPC1-binding site of filovirus glycoproteins makes it an attractive target for the development of broadly neutralizing MAbs with therapeutic potential (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Unfortunately, no such MAbs against ebolaviruses have been isolated. Instead, most known neutralizing anti-ebolavirus MAbs target a conformational epitope at the base of the GP 1,2 trimer (4, 5, 30, 31) . Recently, however, several MAbs isolated from a human survivor of MARV infection were found to recognize the hydrophobic GP CL trough and inhibit GP-NPC1 domain C binding (11, 22) . Of significance, one anti-MARV MAb from that study, MR72, cross-reacts with purified GP and GP CL of EBOV, while three other MAbs, MR78, MR111, and MR191, cross-react only with EBOV GP CL (22) . MR72, MR78, MR111, and MR191 bind to similar locations on MARV GP but approach from significantly different angles (22) . The third complementarity-determining region of the heavy chain variable region (CDRH3) of MR78 binds into the expected MARV GP 1 RBS (see Fig. S3 ) (11) . As the RBS is conserved in sequence and structure across known filoviruses, we evaluated the capacity of MR72 and two additional GP CL -reactive antibodies, MR78 and MR191 (22) (2, 32) . Remarkably, we find that MR72 effectively neutralizes VSVs pseudotyped with GP CL derived from all known filoviruses (Fig. 4A ). In contrast, MR191 neutralizes VSV bearing other filovirus GPs only weakly, and MR78 fails to neutralize VSVs bearing GP CL derived from any species other than MARV. We speculate that the steeper angle of approach of MR191 to MARV GP CL compared to that of MR78 may enhance the breadth of neutralization by improving access to the shared RBS ( Fig. 4A and S3 ). Of significance, we found that MR72 failed to bind VSVs bearing uncleaved EBOV GP on the surface (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). This finding is in contrast to a previous observation of MR72 binding to uncleaved soluble EBOV GP ectodomain (see Fig. S3 ) (22) . It is likely that there are differences in the presentation of EBOV GP on the surface of actual virions that prevent MR72 from binding and effectively neutralizing either wild-type EBOV or VSV bearing uncleaved EBOV GP. The contrasting neutralization breadth properties of MR72 and MR78, despite their similar binding angles and shared epitope, led us to explore our panel of GP CL mutations to identify specific residues in the GP RBS that can affect MR78's neutralization of EBOV GP CL (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). We find that a single point mutation, V79A, allows MR78 to neutralize EBOV GP CL : although MR78 cannot neutralize VSV bearing wildtype EBOV GP CL , it can neutralize V79A-bearing VSV-EBOV GP CL (Fig. 4B) . Position 79 in EBOV GP is equivalent to position 63 in MARV. Structural alignment of EBOV GP CL with MARV in the MARV GP-MR78 crystal structure (11) suggests that the wild-type V79 may sterically clash with the light chain of MR78. Replacement of valine with the smaller alanine residue (V79A) may improve neutralization by relieving the steric clash (Fig. 4B) . Furthermore, previous studies have shown that, unlike MR72, MR78 fails to block NPC1 domain C binding to EBOV GP CL (11) . Therefore, we performed NPC1 domain C competitive-binding assays to determine whether MR78 neutralizes EBOV GP CL -V79A by inhibiting GP-NPC1 binding. Curiously, even though MR78 is now able to neutralize VSV bearing EBOV GP CL -V79A, it remains unable to prevent binding of NPC1 domain C to EBOV GP CL or EBOV GP CL -V79A (Fig. 4B) . MR72, however, does block NPC1 binding to EBOV GP CL . Therefore, our data suggest that MAbs MR72 and MR78 may neutralize by distinct mechanisms. MR72 effectively blocks GP CL -NPC1 binding for all filoviruses, whereas MR78 does not block EBOV GP CL -NPC1 binding. We speculate that MR78 neutralizes EBOV entry by inhibiting viral membrane fusion downstream from virus receptor recognition. In order to gauge the neutralization potentials of MR72 and MR78 relative to those of other MAbs with demonstrated protective efficacy in vivo, we performed a comparative analysis with the combined MAbs of the EBOV-specific ZMapp cocktail: 2G4, 4G7, and 13C6 (31, 33) , as well as with KZ52, a known neutralizing MAb from a human survivor (21) . Our analysis demonstrates that MR72 can neutralize pseudoviruses at 10-fold lower concentrations of antibody than are required for KZ52 and the ZMapp cocktail (Fig. 4C) . Thus, MAbs such as MR72, which target the highly conserved GP 1 RBS, represent a novel avenue for both broad and potent neutralization of filoviruses, if they can be delivered to the endosomal compartments where GP CL is generated during entry.
