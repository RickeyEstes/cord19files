For the 10,000 stochastic simulations, the SEIR model was computed by using the Gillespie algorithm with initial values S = 100,000; E = 10; I = A = H = R = 0 and the parameter values [10] b = 0.085, l 1 = 0.2, l 2 = 10, k = 1/6.6, r = 0.585, g a = 0.6403, g I = 1/5, and g r = 1/7. The control measure was used by changing the value l 2 from 10 to 8.5. Figure 1 depicts the box plots of incidences I (t) + A (t) + H (t) of the MERS-CoV depending on the time of the control intervention on the 20th, 40th, and 60th days after the identification of the index case. The box plots showed that there was a significant difference between the non-intervention and intervention groups (the 20th day, 40th day, and 60th day groups) and seemed to show no significant difference based on the time of intervention. However, the ANOVA in Table 1 revealed a significant difference between the averages in the intervention groups and showed that early intervention promotes a good strategy to control the disease. In particular, these results were evident from the average and standard deviation, which were smaller in the early intervention period. The difference was markedly larger 100 days after the identification of the index case, and the difference in the effect of the intervention over time showed a decreasing trend.
