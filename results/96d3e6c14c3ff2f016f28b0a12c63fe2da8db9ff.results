To analyze the structure-function relationship of the stem-loop involved in stimulation of frameshifting in the dnaX gene of E. coli: (1) the conformation of the frameshift region was investigated using enzymatic and chemical probes and (2) mutations, predicted to disrupt or alter the proposed structure, were engineered, and tested in vivo in a functional assay using b-galactosidase as a reporter. A region of the dnaX gene between nucleotide 1406 and nucleotide 1468 (Yin et al., 1986) was used because this sequence contains all the elements required for dnaX frameshifting ( Figure 1 ).
