The search strategy described above returned 284 publications (Ovid: 165; PubMed: 112; CINAHL: 6; Cochrane: 1). Having excluding 129 duplicates, C.C.C. and B.C. reviewed the titles and abstracts of 155 remaining papers. Of these, 126 did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 29 publications underwent full-text review. Hand search yielded five additional papers for eligibility assessment (Figure 1 ). The most usual reasons for study exclusion were testing an intervention other than isolation precautions (N ¼ 39) or a bundled intervention (N ¼ 9); reviewing or presenting data that were not original (N ¼ 28); describing the prevalence of MDRO (N ¼ 17) or infection prevention practices (N ¼ 14); or examining isolation through observation alone (N ¼ 16). Of these, three attempted to estimate isolation precaution efficacy using mathematical models. 24e26
