Clinical Features and Laboratory Findings. Fifty patients with NSIP were included. Their clinical, radiologic, and physiologic measurements, which were obtained at the time of the initial visit, are shown in Table 1 . Their mean age was 49.2 ± 10.7 years (range, 23-68 years), and 33 (66%) of the patients were women. The patients comprised 43 (86%) nonsmokers, 5 (10%) ex-smokers, and 2 (4%) current smokers. The median duration from the onset of respiratory symptoms to lung biopsy was 6 months (range, 1.0-36 months). Twenty patients were diagnosed with CTD-NSIP (polymyositis/dermatomyositis, n = 7; rheumatoid arthritis, n = 7; Sjögren's syndrome, n = 4; and systemic sclerosis, n = 2). Twelve patients were serologically positive for at least one autoantibody but did not meet the diagnostic criteria for CTD, and 18 patients who were serologically negative were diagnosed with idiopathic NSIP.
