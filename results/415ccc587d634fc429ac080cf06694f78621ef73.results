There is marked co-linearity between the variables 'presence of child in household' , 'age-category' and 'household size'. For example, respondents aged 35 -44 years had significantly greater odds of having a child in the household than those aged 18 -24 years (OR 53.2 (13.0, 217)), while no participant aged more than 55 years lived with a child. The relationship between the household size distribution and presence or absence of children is depicted in Figure 2 . We retained 'presence of child in household' in the final multivariate model for transmission due to its strong predictive role, intuitive appeal, presumed causal role in our observed (univariate) association with age-category, and previous research indicating an association between transmission and children [18, 22, 23, 29, 36] . In the multivariate model, the observed increased risk of transmission with female sex remains (OR = 2.45 (1.01, 5.93), p = 0.047). Presence of children in the household is both the strongest and most statistically significant factor associated with transmission (OR = 2.63 (1.18, 5.88), p = 0.018).
