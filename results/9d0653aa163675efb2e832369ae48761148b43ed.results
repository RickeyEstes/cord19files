Within the 2009 routine surveillance of study 4, 4724 samples from 452 herds were tested for antibodies against SIV (Table 1 ). In total, 16 herds were found seropositive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Retrospectively, the earliest seropositive samples were collected from a herd in the county of Rogaland on the 30th of September 2009, suggesting that pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has been circulating in the Norwegian pig population since September 2009. The results from the surveillance program in 2010 show that 41% of 459 tested herds were seropositive ( Table 1 ). The proportion of seropositive herds in different counties varied from 21% in the low pig density counties of Vestlandet to 57% in the high pig density county of Rogaland and Agder. Simple regression analysis shows that herd prevalence is positively correlated (r = 0.013, p = 0.023) with the pig density by county (Figure 1) . Moreover, the surveillance program in 2010 shows that 42% (19 positive/45 tested herds) of nucleus and 44% (30 positive/68 tested herds) of multiplier herds were seropositive. Questionnaires with epidemiological information were available from 35 pig herds confirmed positive by laboratory testing (serology or PCR). In 60% (21/35) of these infected herds, there was evidence to suggest that humans were the most likely source of infections. In these herds, the farmer, farm worker, or the farmer's family members were diagnosed with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (33% or 7/21) or had ILI just before or during the outbreak (66% or 14/21). Twenty percent (7/35) reported contact with another infected farm through humans or movement of infected animals as source of infection. One farmer of a positive herd had bought pigs from a positive herd and also had one farm worker with ILI during this period. Forty-nine percent (17/35) had reported that clinical signs were observed in the pigs. The most common clinical signs reported were coughing, fever, and loss of appetite, lasting for less than two weeks. No mortality was reported. Nineteen percent (8/43) of the herds from which epidemiological information was gathered tested negative although 3 of these herds had histories of contact with humans with ILI. Full genome sequence analysis was carried out on nasal swab RNA from an infected pig in the index herd, as well as from the virus isolated from a sick staff member at the same farm. The sequences of these two full viral genomes were virtually identical (99.9985% identity) (Acc. no JQ253790-JQ253797). Moreover, the HA sequence showed at least 99.8% identity to other pandemic (H1N1) 2009 circulating in humans in Norway at the same time. The complete sequence further indicated that the virus had not acquired known resistance mutations in the neuraminidase gene.
