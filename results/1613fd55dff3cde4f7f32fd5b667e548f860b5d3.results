From 2009 to 2012, 17,363 samples were collected from 18 health clinics in six provinces of Cambodia and screened for influenza virus, dengue virus and Plasmodium spp (Figure 1 ). From amongst the samples that tested negative for these agents, we selected 6 clusters representing 85 patients with unexplained acute respiratory illness for further analysis. 88% (75/85) of the patients exhibited influenza-like symptoms ( Table 1) . The archived specimens from the 6 clusters were screened by MassTag PCR for viral respiratory pathogens [9, 10] . At least one virus was detected in 44% (37/85) samples ( Figure 2A ). Infection with two viruses was detected in 8 samples. Rhinovirus (HRV) was the most frequently detected virus (n = 17), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; n = 15), and enterovirus (HEV; n = 9) ( Figure 2B ).
