mRNA 3, but not mRNA 3-1, is made in cells infected with the Purdue-116 strain of TGEV Northern analyses of Purdue-116 virus-infected cells carried out previously in our laboratory with oligonucleotide probes specific for the 3Ј end of the genome (i.e., a sequence from within the 3Ј-proximal HP ORF) had identified eight species of mRNA, leading us to conclude that ORFs encoding the 7.7-kDa (gene 3a) and 27.7-kDa (gene 3b) proteins are each 5Ј-terminal on separate mRNA species (Sethna et al., 1989) . To test this conclusion, separate Northern analyses were done with probes specific for the 90-nt leader and for genes 3a and 3b. Our rationale was that mRNA species 3 and 3-1 would be distinguishable with probes binding within ORFs 3a and 3b because transcripts of 3875 and 3561 nt (or even 4075 and 3761 nt if they included poly A tails of 200 nt in length) are resolvable on a gel of 1% agarose. Northern analyses with the separate probes revealed bands with identical mobilities, indicating the presence of mRNA 3, but not mRNA 3-1, in RNA from Purdue-116 virus-infected cells ( Fig. 2A, lanes 4-9) . To test this conclusion by a second method, RT-PCR analysis was done with oligonucleotide primers specific to gene 3b and the minus strand of the leader. Amplified products of 463 and 876 nt would be expected from mRNAs 3-1 and 3, respectively. A product of 5248 nt Northern blot analysis using gene-specific probes. (B) RT-PCR analysis of RNA from Purdue or Miller virus-infected cells using a plus-strand-detecting oligonucleotide from within ORF 3b as the first primer (for RT and subsequent amplification) and a minus-strand-detecting oligonucleotide from within the leader sequence for amplification. Products were electrophoresed on a gel of 1% agarose and stained with EtBr. might also be found from mRNA 2, the mRNA encoding the spike protein. From RT-PCR analysis only a single product of 876 nt with the proper sequence as determined by cloning and sequencing was obtained (Fig. 2B , lane 3; sequencing data not shown), indicating the presence of mRNA 3 but not mRNA 3-1. To establish that the experimental protocol would have detected mRNA 3-1 if present, RNA was extracted from Miller virus-infected cells and used in parallel. From this, the expected 463-nt mRNA 3-1-derived product was obtained (Fig. 2B , lane 4). No product was obtained with RNA from uninfected cells (Fig. 2B, lane 2) . Genes 3a and 3b, but not gene 4, are translated in vitro from synthetic mRNA 3-like transcripts containing all three ORFs To test by in vitro translation whether the 27.7-and 20-kDa gene 3b products (O'Connor and Brian, 1999) are synthesized when ORF 3b is positioned downstream of ORF 3a (beginning at base 337) on synthetic transcripts, uncapped transcripts of pORF3a-3b-4 DNA linearized at the BamHI site 50 nt downstream from the stop codon of gene 4 (Fig. 1C) were translated in either wheat germ extract or rabbit reticulocyte lysate. In both, products from genes 3a (the 7.7-kDa protein containing one methionine) and 3b (the 27.7-kDa form of the protein containing eight methionines and the 20-kDa form presumably containing seven methionines), but not gene 4 (the 9.2-kDa E protein containing four methionines), were obtained (results for wheat germ extract are shown in Fig. 3A , lane 5; note the marker positions in lanes 2-4 and the absence of endogenous product in lane 1). Because a nearly 27-kDa protein was also synthesized from an endogenous transcript in (some) rabbit reticulocyte lysates and the presence of abundant globin protein in the lysate interfered with the resolution of small proteins (data not shown), all subsequent studies described were carried out in wheat germ extract. Thus, from uncapped transcripts bearing similarity to mRNA 3 the first methionine codon in gene 3b (for synthesis of the 27.7-kDa protein) and also the second (assuming synthesis of the 20-kDa protein initiates at the second methionine codon [O'Connor and Brian, 1999] ) are accessed for translation. On a molar basis, the amount of 27.7-kDa gene 3b product is approximately one-fifth of that from gene 3a (Fig. 3B ). There was no evidence of a 9.2-kDa E protein from ORF 4 in this (Fig. 3A , lane 5) or in subsequent experiments, indicating ribosomal accessibility of ORF 3b was probably not the result of template fragmentation. An upstream leader-containing sequence in transcripts of pLORF3a-3b-4 ( Fig. 1C) , although containing an additional 14 nts not found on mRNA 3, had only a small effect on the rate of translation from ORF 3b relative to 3a (Fig. 3A , lane 7, and Fig. 3C ), indicating the leader se-quence may not strongly influence translation from the downstream ORF; however, this needs confirmation with transcripts precisely mimicking the 5Ј end of mRNA 3. As with transcripts of pORF3a-3b-4, no product was evident from ORF 4. Translation of gene 3b from mRNA 3-like transcripts shows a pattern not fully consistent with a leaky scanning model From precedents in eukaryotic mRNAs, it is unlikely that ribosomes would approach ORF 3b on mRNA 3 by a mechanism of translation reinitiation, since three inframe strong stop codons follow ORF 3a (Fig. 1B) . However, an approach by leaky scanning according to the model of Kozak (1989 Kozak ( , 1991a ,b) might be expected, since the initiator codon for ORF 3a (UGUA123UGG, in the Quantitation of products from the indicated constructs as determined from AMBIS radioanalytic imager scans of the gel shown in (A). Note that only detected proteins are represented in the bar graph. * denotes a putative aggregate of the ORF 3b product; † indicates plasmid DNA was linearized at the ScaI site within ORF 3b before transcription. same reading frame as ORF 3b) and for three other potential small ORFs within gene 3a (UAGA167UGC, CAUA283UGC, and UCCA424UGC, all in the ϩ1 reading frame relative to ORF 3b) are within contexts considered weak for initiation, whereas that for ORF 3b (AAAA432UGA) is considered relatively strong. To test for ribosomal scanning on mRNA 3-like transcripts, three approaches were taken. In the first, the effect of a 5Ј cap on the synthesis of 3a and 3b gene products was measured. Increased synthesis from both would be expected if 5Ј cap-dependent entry followed by leaky scanning were used (Kozak, 1989 (Kozak, , 1991a . Increased synthesis from 3b might also be expected if a cap-dependent shunting mechanism were used (Jackson, 1996; Mathews, 1996) . As can be observed in Fig. 3A , lanes 6 and 8, and Figs. 3B and 3C, enhanced translation of both ORFs 3a and 3b resulted when capped transcripts of pORF3a-3b-4 and pLORF3a-3b-4 were translated. These results are therefore consistent with the mechanisms of leaky scanning and cap-enhanced ribosomal shunting. In the second approach, the competitive effect of a soluble cap analog on the translation of ORFs 3a and 3b from capped transcripts of pORF3a-3b-4 was measured. With either leaky scanning or cap-dependent shunting, but not with cap-independent internal entry, competitive inhibition of translation from both ORFs would be expected (Iizuka et al., 1994; Jackson, 1996; Mathews, 1996) . Nearly the same rate of inhibition was found, 70-75% with 0.1 mM and 85-90% with 2 mM cap analog (Figs. 4A and 4C), indicating either mechanism of capdependent entry could be functioning in the translation for ORF 3b. In the third approach, the sequence context surrounding the 3a start codon in transcripts of pORF3a-3b-4 was modified to become strongly favorable for translation (GCCGCCATGG) (Kozak, 1991b) and the relative amounts of 3a and 3b gene products were measured. With leaky scanning, a diminished synthesis from 3b relative to 3a would be expected regardless of the capped status of the transcripts (Kozak, 1991b) , whereas with shunting a change in the relative amounts would not necessarily be expected. As can be noted in Figs. 5A and 5B, whereas the accumulation of 3a product increased almost 20% relative to 3b with the improved Kozak consensus for capped transcripts, no increase was observed with uncapped transcripts. Intriguingly, the absolute amount of gene 3b product appeared nearly identical under all conditions of translation. These results, therefore, are not fully consistent with the leaky scanning model for ORF 3b Translation of ORF 3b is not blocked by the upstream insertion of an 884-nt-long sequence containing three sequential ORFs To test for an internal entry of ribosomes onto ORF 3b, pORF3a-3b-4 was modified to psCATORF3a-3b-4 by the placement of an 884-nt-long sequence containing three sequential ORFs upstream of ORF 3a (Fig. 1C ) and the products of translation were quantitated. An internal entry of ribosomes, either directed by an IRES element or by a shunting mechanism, would typically not be blocked by the presence of upstream ORFs of this dimension (reviewed in Jackson et al., 1995; Jackson, 1996; Mathews, 1996) . Transcripts of psCATORF3a-3b-4 possessed a 5Ј UTR of 59 nt; a five-methionine-containing 450-nt sCAT ORF beginning within an excellent Kozak context (AAAATGG) at base 60; a five-methionine-con-taining 4.4-kDa protein-encoding ORF beginning within a fair Kozak context (ATCATGC) at base 534; a one-methionine-containing 4.5-kDa protein-encoding ORF beginning within a fair Kozak context (CGGATGA) at base 685; and ORF 3a beginning at base 944, ORF 3b beginning at base 1253, and ORF 4 beginning at base 1974. In addition, there is a 66-kDa protein-encoding ORF beginning within a fair Kozak context (TCCATGA) at base 346 within the sCAT ORF (in the ϩ1 reading frame relative to sCAT). All in all, 29 AUG codons exist upstream of ORF 3b. When transcripts of psCATORF3a-3b-4 were translated the following features were noted: 1. From uncapped transcripts, only products from the sCAT and 3b ORFs, in a molar ratio of approximately 1:0.15, were obtained (Fig. 3A, lane 9; Fig. 3D ), indicating that among the downstream ORFs, translation from ORF 3b had been a selective one and was probably not the result of initiation on fragmented transcripts. 2. From capped transcripts, an enhanced accumulation from the sCAT ORF was observed but not from the 3b ORF (Fig. 3A, lane 10; Fig. 3D ), unless an inexplicable putative aggregated form of ORF 3b (identified by an asterisk in Fig. 3A , lane 10, and noted earlier [O'Connor and Brian, 1999] ) was included in the total. (The aggregate was not included in the bar in Fig. 3D.) 3. From capped transcripts in the presence of soluble cap, a similar rate of inhibition was observed for products of both the sCAT and 3b ORFs (50-70% with 0.1 mM and 80-90% with 0.2 mM cap analog; Figs. 4B and 4D), mirroring the results with mRNA 3-like transcripts of pORF3a-3b-4 (Figs. 4A and 4C). 4. No translation of the remaining five ORFs was observed from either uncapped or capped transcripts. These results show that translation of ORF 3b positioned 1263 nt downstream from the 5Ј terminus in the synthetic construct is initiated by some form of internal entry of ribosomes and not by scanning, is influenced by a cap, and is not the result of a fragmented template.
