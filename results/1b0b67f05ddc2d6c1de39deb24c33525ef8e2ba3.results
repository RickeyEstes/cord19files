Fixed effect models are selected over pool model by Ftests, which rejects null hypothesis that individual effects are constant among all individual samples, and over random effect models by Hausman tests, which rejects null hypothesis that the variance of individual effect is zero. The demand depends significantly on price in rural model, of which elasticity inflates up to âˆ’1.07. Price elasticity becomes positive, 0.00221 in national model, as well as 0.00323 in urban model, which are nearly zero. Positive and relatively large non-cash elasticity is estimated with significance in national model and rural model, while negative and insignificant in rural model. The former results contradict our anticipation. With negative coefficient, activity level of local economy is significant as a determinant of the demand in all models.
