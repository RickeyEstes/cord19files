Normal and UV-treated Chilo iridescent virus induce apoptotic blebbing in spruce budworm cells To determine if CIV replication was necessary for induction of apoptosis in C. fumiferana (CF) cells, we treated these cells with normal and UV-inactivated CIV (CIV UV ) as described in Materials and methods. Normal, active CIV was used at two concentrations: high dosage (CIV XS ; 400 μg/ml) and standard dosage (CIV; 10 μg/ml). Infected cells were incubated at 28°C as well as 21°C for 24 h and observed for cell blebbing. Fig. 1 shows that CIV XS induced 70% blebbing (A), whereas CIV induced 10% blebbing and 55% lysis in these cells (B). Lysis was indicated by the presence of cell debris. CIV UV (10 μg/ml) induced 62% blebbing and 5% lysis in CF cells (C). Mocktreated cells incubated at 21°C or 28°C did not undergo significant blebbing or lysis (D). The above results are consistent with apoptosis induction using CIV virion protein extract (CVPE) (Bilimoria, 2001; Paul et al., 2007) .
