A total of 371 samples were collected and tested for IBV by the real-time RT-PCR test. The overall prevalence of IBV was found to be 17.52% (65/371). Among the selected types of chicken, the highest prevalence of IBV was found in commercial layer chicken that was 42.22% (19/45) and the lowest prevalence was showed broiler chicken as 11.94% (16/134). The prevalence of 17.24% (10/58) and 14.93% (20/134) was showed in Sonali and broiler breeder chicken, respectively (Table-3) . According to the age of the chicken in both commercial layer and Sonali chicken, the highest Available at www.veterinaryworld.org/Vol.12/June-2019/28.pdf -GCC ATG TTG TCA CTG TCT ATT G-3'  533-512  IBV5 G probe  5'-FAMCAC CAC CAG AAC CTG TCA CCT C-BHQ1-3'  494-473 IBV=Infectious bronchitis virus RT-PCR=Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction Figure-1 : Phylogenetic tree of amino acid sequences of S1 genes of isolated infectious bronchitis virus. The isolates used in this study indicated by red color. prevalence was found in age between 41 and 60 weeks, which was 54.55% (6/11) and 27.27% (3/11), respectively. However, in case of broiler breeder chicken, it was highest at 21-40 weeks of age than 41-60 weeks of age, which was 16% (4/25) and 14.68% (16/109), respectively. On the other hand, in broiler chicken, age divided into two groups due to short life cycle and found prevalence 12.5% (1/8) at 0-16 days of age and prevalence 11.9% (15/126) at 17-32 days of age (Table-4 ). Three years (2014-2016) were observed during the study period, among three seasons, highest 22.67 (34/150) and lowest 11.58% (11/95) prevalence was found in winter and summer season correspondingly. In rainy season, 15.87% (20/126) prevalence was found (Table-5 ). The identified IBV samples were inoculated into 9-day-old SPF ECE through chorioallantoic membrane route. The chicken embryos were shown characteristic lesions of growth such as curled and dwarfed embryos with covered by a thickened amnion after the third passage propagation. Then, IBV was isolated and reconfirmed by RT-PCR. The partial nucleotide sequence analysis of S1 glycoprotein gene was performed in the isolate CK/ BD/IBV/NPHL1, CK/BD/IBV/NPHL2, and CK/ BD/IBV/NPHL3 and found further defined genetic relationship with two IBV subtypes; one isolate was QX-like IBV and another two isolates were 4/91 IBV circulating in the selected regions, shown in phylogenetic tree (Figure-1 The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the isolates of QX-like IBV are 99% related with isolated of China (accession no. KX107695.1) and two isolates of IBV 4/91 were related with Indian isolates (KF809773.1) and Poland isolates (KT886452.1). The results indicate that both QX-like IBV and 4/91 strains are circulating in chickens in Bangladesh.
