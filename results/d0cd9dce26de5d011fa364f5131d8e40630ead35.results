Descriptive statistics were first calculated to determine the distributions of the core model constructs. Structural equation models in the form of path analyses were performed to evaluate the relative impact of each construct on the intention to wear a pollution mask. The fit of the model was assessed through the examination of these fit indices: chi2 test, the comparative fix index (CFI) and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics of the core variables. Overall, 53% of respondents were females, and 47% males; 77% came from urban areas, and 33% had a rural origin. Respondents were on average 22 years old. Although the mean value of the construct intention was quite high (5.13), the average of the frequency with which respondents used a facemask in the past was quite low (3.46). Subjective norm, attitude, self-efficacy, and PBC were also relatively high. The next step was to estimate the structural equation model in the form of path analysis using maximum likelihood method. The model with standardized coefficients and p-values is reported in Fig. 2 . Except for PBC, attitude, social norm, and self-efficacy were all statistically associated with behavioural intention (their coefficients were, respectively β A➔I = 0.2, β SN➔I = .21, and β SE➔I = 0.47, p < 0.01). In the model' s structure, past behaviour was employed as a proxy for actual behaviour. The path connecting intention to behaviour was units, as in our case, it is very common to obtain a significant chi-square, even when the model is accurate [30] . Therefore, other fit indices should be considered. The CFI is above 0.90 indicates that our model does 92% better than a null model that assumes that all the coefficients are unrelated to each other, but the RAMSEA not below the recommended 0.1. In order to observe how each model factor affected intention, OLS stepwise regression models were successively run. As reported in Table 3 , each model adds a new predictor in the specification. As long as more constructs were included in the model, the R-squared substantially improved, going from R 2 = 0.119 in Model 1 where only attitude was included, to R 2 = 0.416 in Model 4 were all the predictors were added. Attitude, social norm, self-efficacy, and past behaviour were all positively related to the intention of wearing a pollution mask and also highly significant (specifically, β A = 0.23, p < 0.01, β SN = 0.37, p < 0.01, β SN = 0.32, p < 0.01, β PB = 0.12, p < 0.01). PBC was instead not significantly correlated with intention.
