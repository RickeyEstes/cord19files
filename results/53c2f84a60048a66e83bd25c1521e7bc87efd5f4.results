In silico docking yields high hit rate and streamlines screening A library of 727 FDA-approved drugs and their diastereomers were docked into the GPVI ligand binding site, with an emphasis on the electrostatic environment at the Lys41 position (Figure 1a and 1b). Lys41 lies within the floor of the groove that forms the collagen binding site of GPVI [21, 26, 27] and compounds were ranked on their ability to bind in this region. Using a single point screen (Ca 2+ release) with a high dose of drug (100 mM) and a high dose of cross-linked collagen related peptide (CRP-XL, 10 mg/ml), we found that docking yielded a high success rate; of the top 20 compounds, 14 inhibited CRP-XL-induced Ca 2+ release from fura2-AM-loaded washed human platelets by $50% (Figure 1c and 1d). Then, using light transmission aggregometry over a limited (5-6 point) 3-fold dilution series from 100 mM to 300 nM, we re-screened those drugs that had demonstrated inhibition of Ca 2+ release and were commercially available, to identify those which gave concentration-dependent inhibition of GPVI-mediated aggregation (Figure 1e-k) . Of these drugs, some were false positives (e.g. altanserin and pirenpirone - Figure 1i and j) while others showed only weak antagonism (e.g. zaleplon and deoxyadenosine - Figure 1g and h) . Cinanserin and losartan both demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition with suitable IC 50 values (Figure 1e and f) and were therefore selected for further investigation. Cinanserin (Figure 1l ) was the highest ranking hit (#1) from the docking and preliminary experiments indicated that it had an IC 50 in the micromolar range. The angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist losartan (Figure 1m ) also ranked highly as a potential antagonist (#10). Retrospective literature searches revealed that this compound had previously been reported to interact with the collagen binding pocket of GPVI [28] and inhibit platelet aggregation both in vitro [29] and in vivo [30] . The fact that losartan has been shown to interact with GPVI at the collagen binding site in an independent study validates our methodology and provides confidence that our docking parameters are appropriate. Losartan was included in subsequent experiments as it serves not only as a positive control, but also as a potential drug for repurposing if found to be selective and efficacious; losartan is a well-tolerated drug. Cinanserin was also included for further characterisation as it was ranked with the greatest probability of interacting with GPVI, and exhibited robust inhibition of Ca 2+ release ( Fig. 1c and 1e) . The high success rate of our computational screen (14 out of 20 compounds inhibited CRP-XL-induced Ca 2+ release in vitro) validates the use of an in silico docking strategy for identifying potential receptor antagonists. Losartan and cinanserin inhibit Ca 2+ release and aggregation in washed human platelets We next conducted more detailed studies to determine precise IC 50 values for losartan and cinanserin using platelet functional assays. Ca 2+ release induced by the GPVI-specific agonist CRP-XL, and the endogenous ligand collagen, was measured and quantified. Both drugs inhibited Ca 2+ release in a concentrationdependent manner in response to both CRP-XL (Figure 2a-c) and collagen (Figure 2d-f ). Cinanserin and losartan had IC 50 values in the micromolar range, with losartan having an IC 50 value of 4 mM, 10-fold greater than that of cinanserin (40 mM). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of losartan and cinanserin on Ca 2+ release could be translated into effects on gross platelet function, we carried out light transmission aggregometry using washed human platelets. Both drugs exhibit dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation in response to both CRP-XL (1 mg/ml, Figure 2g -i) and collagen (1 mg/ml, Figure 2j -l). IC 50 values were comparable to those for Ca 2+ release and are summarised in Table 1 .
