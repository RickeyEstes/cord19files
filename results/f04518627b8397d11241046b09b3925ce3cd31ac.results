Shuttle peptides enable delivery of Cas RNP to NK cells. The first-generation shuttles were designed by fusing the endosomolytic peptide CM18 and the CPP PTD4 with six-histidine tags, at one or both ends of the peptide (CM18-PTD4) 35 . The activity of CM18-PTD4 constructs was demonstrated by delivering different protein cargoes to multiple cell types. We then further modified peptide sequences to increase their delivery efficacy 37 . Here, we present a subset of three rationally designed peptides termed Shuttle10 (S10), Shuttle18 (S18), and Shuttle85 (S85). Figure 1a shows peptide sequences aligned with CM18-PTD4. While the peptides share features, including an improved hydrophobic cluster derived from the CM18 domain and an optimized hydrophilic/cationic tail derived from the cell-penetrating PTD4 peptide, they diverge in others. In addition to their variable length (25-34 amino acids), S10 contains five highly hydrophobic residues in the CM18-derived domain, while S18 and S85 have eight, the S85 linker was reduced to a single glycine, and the PTD4-derived domain of S18 contains six cationic residues compared to four in S10 and S85. Using these three rationally designed peptides, we demonstrate improved editing of NK cells when co-incubated with Cas12a RNP for 90 s. Figure 1b presents the editing measured at the NKG2A locus following Cas12a RNP delivery to NK cells. RNP delivery by S10, S18, or S85 improved editing, achieving indels of 25%, 23%, and 26%, respectively, compared to the previously reported CM18-PTD4 that enabled 10% editing 35 . Shuttle peptides deliver protein to airway epithelial cells. As shuttle peptides enabled Cas12a RNP delivery to NK cells, we hypothesized that they could deliver proteins and Cas RNPs to hard-to-transduce well-differentiated primary cultures of human airway epithelial (HAE) cells (Fig. 1c ). As differences in peptide length, hydrophobicity, linker, and charge may influence delivery efficiency when applied to new cell types, we first test the feasibility of peptide-mediated delivery in HAE with CM18-PTD4, S10, S18, and S85 using GFP protein. Shuttle peptides were combined with recombinant nuclear-targeted GFP protein and applied to the apical surface for 15 min, and then the GFP signal was quantified by fluorescence imaging (Fig. 1d, left panel) . At a 20 µM concentration, S10 achieved the greatest GFP delivery. En face images demonstrated GFP signal throughout the epithelium (Fig. 1d, right panel) . Similar results were obtained when the same four shuttle peptides were used to transfer GFP protein to primary cultures of porcine tracheal epithelia, a large animal model of CF 38, 39 (Supplementary Fig. 1) . To identify the cell types transduced in human airway epithelia, we co-localized GFP and specific cell type markers. Fifteen minutes after applying S10 and GFP, we observed GFP-positive (GFP + ) nuclei in cells positive for acetylated α-tubulin, a ciliated cell marker (Fig. 1e , left panel, white arrows). GFP also co-localized with non-ciliated cells (Fig. 1e , left panel, white arrowheads) and Muc5AC, a marker of goblet (secretory) cells (Fig. 1e , right panel, white arrowhead). By morphometric analysis, the S10 transduction efficiency ranged from 27 to 35% for all cell types of the surface epithelium (32 ± 2.0, mean ± SE, n = 3). We also applied the S10 peptide and GFP to the apical surface of freshly excised human tracheal tissue explants. One hour later, GFP + nuclei co-localized with ciliated and non-ciliated surface epithelia (Fig. 1f) . Shuttle peptides deliver Cas RNPs to airway epithelia. As a proof of principle, we delivered Cas12a RNP targeting CFTR intron 22-23 to HAE from non-CF donors with the four shuttle peptides used to deliver GFP. This intronic region is the site of a CFTR splicing mutation termed 3849 + 10C>T that introduces a premature termination codon and causes CF 40 (see diagram in Fig. 2a) . We assessed Cas12a RNP-induced indels using the Surveyor assay and quantified by Sanger sequencing 3 days after delivery (Fig. 2b) . We observed an indel frequency of 9-26%, with S10 conferring the most efficient Cas12a RNP delivery. Figure 2c , d shows the effects of S10 dose and duration of incubation on editing efficiency. While increasing the peptide concentration improved editing, the duration of incubation did not. To investigate the editing efficiency of Cas12a RNPs for another target, we selected the HPRT1 locus (Fig. 2e ). S10 and S85 achieved the greatest indel% (Fig. 2e) . We also tested a Cas9 RNPs designed to CFTR exon 11 in non-CF epithelia (Fig. 2f) . CFTR exon 11 is the site of the common F508del mutation. The CM18-PTD4, S18, S10, and S85 peptides achieved similar indel%. To illustrate the difficulty in delivering macromolecular cargo to HAE, we transfected Cas9 and Cas12a RNPs with three commercial Lipofection reagents and observed no editing of two different CFTR loci ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Shuttle peptides deliver protein in vivo. To investigate the utility of shuttle peptides in vivo, we delivered nuclear-targeted GFP protein to the airways of adult BALB/c mice by nasal instillation. We selected the S10 peptide based on its performance in HAE (Fig. 1) . We administered S10 and GFP once or twice over an 8 h period. Approximately 18 h after the final treatment, mice were euthanized and GFP distribution evaluated. We observed widespread nuclear GFP signal within large and small airway epithelia (Fig. 3a) and co-localization confirmed that GFP was delivered to ciliated and non-ciliated secretory (club) cells (Fig. 3b, c) . These represent the two predominant surface cell types of the murine large (Fig. 3b) and small (Fig. 3c) airways. Non-ciliated club cells are a wellcharacterized progenitor cell type 41 . In the distal lung, we observed occasional GFP + cells that co-localized with SP-C, a marker of alveolar type II cells (Fig. 3d , white arrows). The transduction efficiency in the large airways was 27 ± 8% and 46 ± 5% (mean ± SE) for one or two doses, respectively. In the small airways, the delivery efficiency was 32 ± 1% and 30 ± 2% (mean ± SE) with one or two doses, respectively (Fig. 3e) .
