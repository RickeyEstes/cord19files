The ZIKV isolates reported in this study were obtained from the sera of three Brazilian patients who presented mild symptoms of ZIKV infection (malaise, exanthema, mild fever, headache, muscle pain, and peri- Table I ). The serum was collected from a female patient from Rio Grande do Sul state (RS) in January 2016, one year after the confirmation of the first cases of ZIKV in the country. A summary with information about the patient samples used for the ZIKV isolations and the GenBank accession numbers is presented in Table I . The viruses that were recovered from the cell culture supernatant at passage three were fully sequenced. All ZIKV full-length genome sequencing resulted in a 10,807 nucleotide (nt) assembled sequence; this sequence contained an ORF of 10,269 nucleotides in length with 5ʹ (107 nt) and 3ʹ (431 nt) untranslated regions (UTRs). The numbers of nucleotide and amino acid differences among the isolates are shown in Table II . Phylogenetic analyses of either the complete sequence ( Fig. 1) a: determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) with the following primers/probe: ZIKV1086, ZIKV1162c and ZIKV1107-FAM. (10) b: sequence generated from P3. c: sequence generated directly from patient sera which is identical to P3 sequence. d: sequence generated from P0 which is identical to P3 sequence. in Supplementary data (Fig. 1) ]. We have also analysed our datasets in search of any sign of potential recombination among these new isolates, but none was detected. An alignment of the Brazilian isolates included in the phylogenetic analysis can be found in the Supplementary data. The positions where mutations were identified among the newly reported isolates are evidenced by a light blue arrow. This alignment also includes sequences from the PE243 and MR766 strains (highlighted in green and yellow, respectively) that have been used in the biological characterisation experiments. A genomic analysis comparing the P3 sequences of the two ZIKV isolates recovered from the patients' serum from the Brazilian northeast region (RN state) obtained during the same epidemic event three months apart (ZV BR 2015/15098 versus ZV BR 2015/15261) was performed; this analysis showed six amino acid substitutions, more specifically in the E, NS2A and NS3 coding regions (Tables II-III) . The genome of the isolate ZV BR 2016/16288 showed two exclusive amino acid substitutions when compared with the others two isolates studied, mapping at NS1 and NS4B proteins. Additionally, only the ZIKV ZV BR 2015/15098 showed a nucleotide substitution at 3' UTR. As shown in the RNA fold analysis (Supplementary data), this change does not seem to have any impact in secondary structure. To study the biological characteristics of the ZIKV Brazilian isolates ZV BR 2015/15098, ZV BR 2015/15261 and ZV BR 2016/16288 and to compare them to the extensively studied and well-characterised ZIKV strains such as MR766 and PE243, different mammalian and insect cell lines were used (Fig. 2) . This kinetics analysis was also used to choose the best time and MOI to observe the differences between the virus isolates (Fig. 2) . A period of incubation of 48 h and a MOI of 0.1 for the mammalian cell lines (A549, Huh7.5 and Vero E6), and 72 h and an MOI of 1 for the insect cell lines (AP61 and C6/36) were selected. Further studies with Aag2 were not carried out after this cell line was demonstrated to have low susceptibility to the ZIKV isolates tested (Fig. 2B) . The abilities of the ZIKV isolates to infect the different cell lines were evaluated based on the percentage of infected cells; this was determined based on the presence of viral E protein, the quantification of viral RNA in infected cells by RT-qPCR, as well as the titration of the cell culture supernatants to access the amount of released infectious viral particles [ Fig. 3, Supplementary data  (Fig. 3) ]. However, when compared to the MR766 and Comparisons between the three newly described isolates showed that ZV BR 2015/15098 had the highest infection rate in A549 cells and the highest viral progeny production rates in A549 and Huh7.5 cells. On the other hand, viral RNA accumulation was not significantly different in those cells. Aiming to evaluate the ability of different ZIKV isolates from Brazil to infect a primary human cell target, monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDC) were used. After a 24 h infection period, it was possible to demonstrate the presence of envelope protein (4G2 + ) of ZIKV in mdDCs infected with the three clinical isolates of ZIKV (Fig. 4A-B) . Flow cytometry analysis showed that the frequency of mdDCs (CD11c + /CD14 -/CD209 + ) infected (4G2 + ) with ZV BR 2015/15261 (25.54% ± 21.12) was similar to the frequency of infection with ZIKV PE243 (27.47% ± 16.98) and ZIKV MR766 (24.84% ± 20.49). Conversely, the ZIKV strains ZV BR 2015/15098 (8.31% ± 6.29), that presented a better viral fitness on A459, Huh7.5 and Vero E6 cells, as well as the ZV BR 2016/16288 (10.40% ± 6.03), were shown to be less efficient in infecting mdDCs compared to the infection efficiencies of the ZV BR 2015/15261, PE243 and MR766 strains (Fig. 4A-B) . Unlike the high infection rates observed after 48 h in mammalian cells or 72 h in insect cells, the mdDC infection rates with all ZIKV strains tested decreased over time (data not shown). The virus titration of cell culture supernatants confirmed the results of the abilities of viruses to replicate and release infective particles in cell supernatants (Fig. 4C) . Corroborating the flow cytometry data, ZV BR 2015/15261, MR766 and PE243 showed higher titers compared to the titers of ZV BR 2015/15098 and ZV BR 2016/16288 (Fig. 4C) . Finally, quantitative real time PCR confirmed the previous data obtained by FACS and cell culture titration (Fig. 4D) . Curiously, in part the results with primary human mdDCs cells were divergent from the results observed in the mammalian cell lines. Despite lower viral fitness in A549 and Huh7.5 cells, ZV BR 2015/15261 strain displayed the highest infectivity rates in the mdDC compared to others ZV BR 2015/15098 and ZV BR 2016/16288 strains. In contrast, ZV BR 2015/15098 that displayed the highest infection rates in A549 and Huh7.5 cells, it has low productive infection in mdDC. As a whole, however, the reference ZIKV strains, MR766 and PE243, and ZV BR 2016/16288 showed the same pattern of infection in both mammalian and mdDC cells.
