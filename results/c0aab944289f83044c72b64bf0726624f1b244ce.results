In this section we describe the results of fitting various models and calculating ensemble estimates across those models using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) [2, 16] (see supplementary material for details). Our BMA-based estimates, which provide a weighted average of estimates across five different models, formalize uncertainty in model selection. This is because the weighting is done by using posterior model probabilities which measure how well each model is supported by the data. There is significant discordance across models in the measures of model fit (Table 1) . Model C, the model with incubation periods performs the best. Notably, Model A, the only model that does not allow for successive infections with decreased levels of infectiousness, performs significantly worse as measured by posterior model probability.
