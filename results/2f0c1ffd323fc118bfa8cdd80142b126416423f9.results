Proteomic screen for DENV-2 UTR-interacting proteins. A previous study utilized HeLa cell lysates and RNA affinity chromatography coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry (qMS) to identify proteins that interact with the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of DENV-2 (New Guinea C strain) 10, 12 . We performed a similar screen with HuH-7 cell lysates to identify proteins that bind to the DENV-2 UTRs in a commonly used cell culture model for Flavivirus replication. We defined DENV-2 UTR-interacting proteins as those enriched ≥ 2-fold over the control RNA in three independent experiments with at least ≥ 2 ratio counts. Thirty-seven (37) proteins met these criteria ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1 "Pos strand RBPs"). Of these, twenty-one (21) proteins had been identified in our previous screen as candidate DENV-2 UTR-interacting proteins in HeLa cells 10 ; among these 21 was the putative DEDD RNA exonuclease ERI3 (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S1 "New screen v Ward et al. 10 "). ERI3 was enriched for binding to the UTR RNA 2.6-fold, on average (SD = 0.255) ( Supplementary Table S1 ). Indeed, ERI3 was independently identified as a candidate 'hit' in an RNAi screen for templates to generate RNA for chromatography. T7 promoter, aptamer sequence and nucleotide coordinates of sequences from DENV-2 NGC are indicated for the control NS2A and UTR constructs (figure adapted from 10 ). (B) Scatter plot comparing the results from two independent quantitative mass spectrometric analyses of DENV-2 UTR-interacting proteins (three independent experiments were performed in total). In the experiment plotted on the y-axis (forward experiment), the control RNA was incubated with lysate from cells labeled with light arginine and lysine (K0R0) and the DENV-2 UTR RNA was incubated with lysate from cells labeled with heavy arginine and lysine (K8R10). In the experiment plotted on the x-axis (reverse experiment), the control RNA was incubated with heavy lysate and the DENV-2 UTR RNA was incubated with light lysate. The minimum of 2 or more fold change for both reverse and forward experiments were used to select the most confident interacting partners (red dots in upper left quadrant).

ERI3 associates with DENV-2 and YFV17D, but not EV71 and MuV RNA. In order to validate and extend the role for ERI3 suggested by the proteomic screens, we utilized RNA immunoprecipitation and qPCR to test whether ERI3 interacts with DENV-2 RNA during infection. To determine if ERI3 interacts with other viral RNAs, we also performed RNA immunoprecipitation using cells infected with the Flavivirus YFV17D, the Picornavirus Enterovirus 71 (EV71) or the Paramyxovirus Mumps virus (MuV). We generated HEK293 cells expressing N-terminal FLAG-tagged ERI3 under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Expression of FLAG-ERI3 was induced and, 24 hours later, cells were infected with DENV-2 (MOI = 1.0), YFV17D (MOI = 1.0), EV71 (MOI = 0.3) or MuV (MOI = 1.0). 24 hours post-infection, lysates were harvested and immunoprecipitated using a mouse FLAG antibody or a mouse IgG control. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by western blot using antibodies to FLAG and the RNA binding protein DDX6. RNA precipitates were analyzed by qPCR for GAPDH and viral RNA. As seen in Fig. 2A ,C,E,G, only FLAG antibody efficiently immunoprecipitated FLAG-ERI3 from lysates. We analyzed the input and pellet for viral RNA and determined that immunoprecipitation of FLAG-ERI3 significantly enriched DENV-2 genomic RNA (gRNA, 21.9-fold enrichment, P = 0.02) compared to the IgG control ( Fig. 2B) , demonstrating that ERI3 interacts with DENV-2 RNA during infection. To determine if FLAG-ERI3 immunoprecipitation preferentially enriched for gRNA or subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), we performed qPCR using primers specific for sequence within the 3′ UTR and calculated the sfRNA concentration 18 . In contrast to gRNA alone, FLAG-ERI3 immunoprecipitation did not significantly enrich sfRNA (21.9-fold enrichment for gRNA, P = 0.02 vs. 0.45-fold enrichment for sfRNA, P = 0.09) ( Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1A ), suggesting that ERI3 preferentially binds to DENV-2 gRNA. Thus ERI3 is one of several factors identified by this RNA affinity chromatography method that have been shown to bind in infected cells and have functional importance 10, 18, 19 . To determine whether ERI3 interacted with RNAs from other RNA viruses, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation and qPCR as described above using the YFV17D-, EV71-or MuV-infected cells expressing FLAG-ERI3. We analyzed the input and pellet using qPCR and determined that immunoprecipitation of FLAG-ERI3 significantly enriched YFV17D RNA (8.63-fold enrichment, P = 0.03) compared to the IgG control (Fig. 2D) , suggesting there is an interaction between ERI3 and YFV17D RNA during infection. When we performed RNA immunoprecipitation using EV71-or MuV-infected cells expressing FLAG-ERI3 we determined there was a modest and not statistically significant enrichment of EV71 RNA in FLAG precipitates (EV71 = 2.45-fold enrichment, P = 0.05) and no enrichment for MuV (MuV = 0.426-fold enrichment, P = 0.85) (Fig. 2F,H) . These results demonstrated that ERI3 preferentially associated with DENV-2 and YFV17D RNA compared to other viral RNAs such as EV71 or MuV and suggested a Flavivirus-specific function. ERI3 is required for DENV-2 and YFV17D, but not EV71, replication. RNA chromatography and immunoprecipitation experiments revealed an interaction between ERI3 and DENV-2 and YFV17D RNA, but not EV71 RNA (Figs 1 and 2) . Additionally, ERI3 was a candidate 'hit' in an RNAi screen for DENV-2 host factors in HuH-7 cells (Barrows et al., manuscript in preparation). In order to test the functional importance of ERI3 for DENV-2 infection, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown and infection with DENV-2, YFV17D or EV71. ERI3 knockdown was performed using two independent siRNAs (siERI3_III and siERI3_VII) transfected 48 hours prior to infection. As a positive control for knockdown of DENV-2 host factors, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (ATP6V0C) that is required for endosomal acidification and efficient virus replication 20, 21 . At 24 hours post-infection, total cell lysates were harvested for western blot analysis or total cellular RNA was harvested and analyzed for viral RNA levels by qPCR. Tissue culture supernatants were harvested for foci forming assays or plaque assays. ERI3 knockdown was validated by western blot using an ERI3-specific antibody (Fig. 3A ,D,G) and qPCR for ERI3 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S2A-C) . Knockdown of the vATPase subunit or ERI3 led to a 3-to 10-fold reduction in DENV-2 gRNA accumulation compared to the control knockdown (One-way ANOVA, P < 0.0001, Dunnett's post-test P < 0.05) (Fig. 3B ). Since the qPCR primers target the NS2A region of the viral genome and gRNA is incompletely degraded to generate sfRNA, we wanted to determine if gRNA was being degraded to sfRNA in the absence of ERI3. We performed qPCR using gRNA-specific primers and a set of primers that targets the 3′ UTR, which detects both gRNA and sfRNA. In vitro transcribed DENV-2 replicon RNA, containing both target sequences, was used to generate cDNA, perform qPCR and plot a standard curve for absolute quantitation of gRNA and sfRNA levels, as described in Bidet et al. 18 . Knockdown of the vATPase subunit led to a 10-fold reduction of the sfRNA:gRNA ratio compared to the control knockdown (One-way ANOVA, P < 0.021, Dunnett's post-test, P < 0.05) ( Supplementary Fig. S2D ). DENV-2 replication is restricted early following knockdown of the vATPase subunit and RT-qPCR would primarily detect incoming viral genomes, leading to a reduction in the sfRNA:gRNA ratio ( Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S2D ) 21 . Similarly, knockdown of ERI3 led to a 5-to 10-fold reduction of the sfRNA:gRNA ratio compared to the control knockdown (One-way ANOVA, P < 0.021, Dunnett's post-test, P < 0.05) ( Supplementary Fig. S2D ). These results suggest that ERI3 is required for accumulation of both gRNA and sfRNA, and, therefore, an early process in replication is defective in the absence of ERI3. Since ERI3 was shown to interact with YFV17D, but not significantly with EV71 viral RNA, we wanted to determine if ERI3 played a role in the accumulation of either YFV17D or EV71 RNA, similar to its role with DENV-2. Knockdown of the vATPase subunit or ERI3 led to a 3-to 90-fold reduction in YFV17D RNA accumulation compared to the control knockdown (One-way ANOVA, P < 0.0001, Dunnett's post-test, P < 0.05) (Fig. 3E ). In contrast, knockdown of the vATPase subunit or ERI3 led to a 0.7-to 2-fold reduction in EV71 RNA accumulation and statistical significance only with siATPase and siERI3_III (One-way ANOVA, P = 0.0012) (Fig. 3H ). These results demonstrate that ERI3 is required for accumulation of DENV-2 and YFV17D gRNA, but not for EV71 RNA accumulation, suggesting a Flavivirus-specific function for ERI3. Since knockdown of ERI3 reduced the accumulation of DENV-2 and YFV17D RNAs, we wanted to determine if ERI3 was required for production of infectious particles. Knockdown of the vATPase subunit led to a 19-to 88-fold reduction in YFV17D and DENV-2 infectious particle production, respectively, whereas ERI3 knockdown led to a 7-to 19-fold reduction in DENV-2 and YFV17D infectious particle production (One-way ANOVA, P < 0.0001, Dunnett's post-test, P < 0.05) (Fig. 3C ,F). In contrast, knockdown of the vATPase subunit or ERI3 did not lead to significant reduction of EV71 infectious particle production (One-way ANOVA, P = 0.0965) (Fig. 3I ). These results suggest that ERI3 is required for DENV-2 and YFV17D, but not EV71, replication. In addition, qPCR analysis of DENV-2 and YFV17D infection samples for expression of IFN-ß or IFITM2, an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG), showed that there was no significant difference in the levels of IFN-ß or IFITM2 expression in the absence of ERI3 (Supplementary Fig. S2E -H), suggesting ERI3 is required for a virus-specific function and not induction of the innate immune response. These results reveal that ERI3 is a host factor for both DENV-2 and YFV17D, but not EV71, and suggests a Flavivirus-specific role in replication in human cells. DENV-2 infects both human and mosquitoes of the Aedes genus and we wondered whether the ERI3 requirement would be shared in these invertebrate hosts. We identified a single putative DEDD 3′ -5′ exonuclease gene (AAEL007801) in Aedes aegypti, the major arthropod vector for DENV, and asked whether this gene was important for DENV-2 infection. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were injected with double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) targeting AAEL007801 or GFP and then infected with DENV-2 via blood meal. Virus titers in mosquito midguts were then determined ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Compared to the GFP control, dsRNA targeting AAEL007801 resulted in a modest (~30%) but statistically significant reduction in DENV-2 midgut titers, suggesting that AAEL007801, the mosquito homolog of ERI3, is also a mosquito host factor for DENV-2 (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S2 ).
