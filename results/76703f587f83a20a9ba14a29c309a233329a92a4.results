Data were obtained from all 16 countries involved in the EUNID project and reflected the position in mid-2006. Data were complete and accurate from 12 countries, where national health authorities performed a survey recently (e.g. in Greece, where a complete survey of these facilities was performed in 2004, for the occasion of the Olympic Games in Athens), or where data furnished by EUNID partners had been confirmed by national authorities or official documents. Information from Belgium and France was complete but not detailed, because only data about number of hospitals and rooms are held centrally. Finally, in the opinion of national representatives, data from Spain and Portugal may be partial. The results are summarised in Table I . At least 211 hospitals had HIRs, with at least 1789 hospital beds. In particular, six hospitals in three countries (Germany, Italy and UK) had 14 hospital beds in 'advanced' isolation units, with direct connection with BSL 3e4 laboratory area. The mean number of hospital beds in each country was 112, ranging from 0 in Austria to 726 in Italy, with a median of 67. The number of HIR hospital beds per million of population served is given in Table I , and ranged from 0 in Austria, to 31.5 in Luxembourg. The geographical distribution of HIRs is shown in Figure 1 . Thirteen countries were able to provide information on intensive care capability. The total number of beds in HIRs equipped with such capability was 342, mostly present in Italy (245 beds) and Denmark (40 beds) where this was provided by means of portable devices, as was the case in The Netherlands (four beds). The other 56 beds with intensive care capability, distributed in six countries, were mostly located in intensive care units. The mean number of hospital beds in HIRs equipped with intensive care capability in the 13 countries from which these data were available, was 26.3 (median: 4; range: 0 in Austria, Estonia, Ireland and Spain to 245 in Italy). Data about the way that air was exhausted were available from 11 countries. In almost all countries, the air was exhausted to the outside through HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters; in two countries, air was exhausted directly to the outside, without HEPA filtration. Information about sealing of such rooms was obtained from nine countries. In all but two (Luxembourg and Portugal), HIRs were sealed. The location of HIRs was explored, and these data were available from 13 countries. In four countries these rooms were located in a separate building or in a separate ward with a separate entrance; in four countries these rooms were located in the same ward as other rooms, mainly in infectious disease or intensive care wards. In five countries, both approaches were used. Specific data about each country are available on the EUNID website (www.eunid.eu).
