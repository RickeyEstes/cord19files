The most common infections in feral cats were B. henselae and FCoV, followed by Mycoplasma spp., D. immitis, and T. gondii (Table 1) . Of the 101 (18.3%) cats that had antibodies to FCoV, most had low antibody titers with only 7 cats having titers of 1:320 or greater. Three of 553 cats (0.5%) were positive for both FeLV and FIV. All D. immitis Ag positive cats were D. immitis Ab positive, but only 7 of 64 (10.9%) D. immitis Ab positive cats were D. immitis Ag positive. Concurrent M. haemofelis and M. haemominutum infections were detected in 19 of 484 cats (3.9%). Of the 67 (12.1%) T. gondii seroreactive cats, 11 (2.0%) were positive for IgM alone, 49 (8.9%) were positive for IgG alone, and 7 (1.3%) were positive for both IgM and IgG. Male cats were at significantly higher risk for FIV, M. haemofelis and M. haemominutum. Female cats were at slightly higher risk for B. henselae and T. gondii IgM (Table 2) . Associations between the retroviruses and Mycoplasma spp. were the most noteworthy (Table 3) . Infection with FeLV was associated with increased risk for coinfection with and detection of both FIV Ab and M. haemominutum DNA. Infection with FIV was associated with increased risk for coinfection with FeLV, M. haemofelis, and M. haemominutum. Cats infected with one species of Mycoplasma were at risk to be coinfected with the other. Coronavirus was associated with FIV, T. gondii IgM, and M. haemominutum. Cats with an IgG titer for T. gondii were at increased risk for D. immitis Ab or Ag. B. henselae was the most common infection (33.6% prevalence) and was the only organism that did not have any associated risk for coinfection with other organisms.
