A total of 43 patients suspected with COVID-19 were admitted to CMUH during January 20 th to February 19 th 2020. Two of them were later confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR. As shown in Table 1 , the ages of patients ranged from 3 to 68 years (mean age of 34.0 years). The male-to-female ratio was 0.65. Of all patients, 23% (n=10) came back from Guangdong province, 9% (n=4) from Wuhan city, and 2% (n=1) from Hubei province areas other than Wuhan city, and 7% (n=3) went to other country but transited from Hong Kong airport. Of the 10 patients who had contact history, 4 had close contact with people who visited Guangdong or Hubei province, and 6 had connected to COVID-19 patients. The two COVID-19 patients confirmed in this study had no travel or contact history with people who had been to China but had a family dinner on 27 th January with the patient who was the first COVID-19 mortality case (Taiwan NO. 19) confirmed on 15 th February. About 44% of the non-COVID19 patients had at least one comorbidity; however, the two confirmed cases, COVID-19 patients A and B, presented no comorbid conditions.
