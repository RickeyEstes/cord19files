Introducing spatially-heterogeneous population mixing into the infection model results in a spatiallyheterogeneous distribution of infection. The degree of heterogeneity is primarily controlled by the parameter δ H i -the proportion of infections acquired from an individual that occur in that individual's home region. This can be seen in Figs. 3 and 4 , which show the spatial distribution of infection for each of the OD matrices. Figure 3 shows these distributions for δ C = 0.33 (i.e., mixing in the CBD primarily involves visitors) and Fig. 4 shows them for δ C = 0.67 (i.e., mixing in the CBD primarily involves CBD residents). As δ H i → 1 (red points) the dynamics approach that of the non-spatial infection model (and when δ H i = 1 the epidemic would be confined to the region(s) where infections are introduced). The public transport JTW matrices clearly capture the impact of the spoke-and-hub structure of the public transport network on spatial interactions, with Inner Melbourne (SA4 206) home to an extra 20% of all infections. Smaller increases (≈ 1% of all infections) are clustered in the inner east/south: Boroondara (Inner East 1), Whitehorse -West (Inner East 3), Stonnington East (Inner South 4), and Monash (South East 5); and also in the inner west: Maribyrnong (West 3, adjacent to the CBD). The private transport JTW matrices and GPS matrices produce spatial distributions that are (a) similar to each other; and (b) markedly different to those of the public transport JTW matrices. The combined private and public transport JTW matrices also yield results that are near-identical to the GPS matrices, because more than two-thirds of the working population reported that they used private transport to travel to work. This supports our initial assumption about the bias towards private transport in the GPS dataset. As the value of δ C increases, so too does the proportion of all infections that occur in the CBD (20604). Relative to the spatially-uniform scenario, this proportion only ever decreases when using the GPS OD matrices and only for small values of δ C (δ C < 0.5). This is apparent in the top-left panel of Fig. 3 . For all other mixing matrices (i.e., those using JTW data and/or large values of δ C ) there is always an elevated proportion of infections in the CBD. This highlights the CBD-centric nature of the JTW data in general, and public transport trips in particular. While the results obtained from the public transport JTW matrices are straightforward to interpret -a marked increase in infections in the central and inner east regions -the geographic trends obtained from the other mixing matrices are not immediately evident in Figs. 3 and 4 . The results capturing the increase or decrease of the proportion of predicted cases relative to the spatially-uniform scenario by SA3 for each mixing matrix (Fig. 5) show a consistent increase in infections within and around Inner Melbourne (206), and a decrease in the peripheral SA3s in all directions: North East (209), North West (210), Outer East (211), South East (212), and West (213). There are also clear differences between the results from JTW and GPS matrices, particularly in the Inner South (208) and North East (209), and also in the inner regions of the North West (210), Outer East (211), and South East (212). The JTW matrices produce a lower proportion of infections in the Outer North (209) and West (213) than the GPS matrix, which also yielded an increased proportion of infections in the inner north-west. The division between SA3s with increased and decreased infections is not aligned with the SA4 boundaries shown in Fig. 1 . This suggests that SA4 regions are not a suitable higher-level spatial aggregation of metropolitan Melbourne for characterising patterns of urban mobility and their consequences for influenza infection. Instead, the boundary between inner SA4s (206-208) and peripheral outer SA4s (209-213) should be pushed outwards, while retaining the radial division of the outer SA4s. In comparison to the model results, the distribution of influenza cases exhibits less clustering of SA3s where disease activity is consistently increased or decreased. The blue SA3s (decreased activity) and green SA3s (increased activity) are scattered amongst each other to a greater degree than observed for the model simulations. Figure 7 shows the spatial variation of the differences between the spatially-uniform scenario and the median annual proportion of notified cases (over the 2010-16 seasons) in each SA3. These variations share a number of similarities with the spatial distributions of infection that are produced by the simulation model for each of the OD data sets (shown in Fig. 5 ): There are also clear differences between the median distribution of influenza cases and the model outputs: The smallest differences between the distribution of influenza cases and the distribution of model infections, for both the JTW data and the GPS data, are shown in Fig. 8 . Here we can see a trend in overprediction of incidence in the west, north-west, and mid-east, and an under-prediction of incidence in the inner east, inner south-east, outer north-east, and outer south-east. Results are shown relative to the spatially-uniform scenario. The GPS data and private journeys to work data exhibit similar trends, where increases in disease occur along a north-west to south-east axis, extending beyond the inner-most SA4 regions, and moderate to large decreases in disease in the outer-most regions and inner north-east. The public journeys to work data exhibit a greater concentration of disease in and around the CBD, and also in the inner-east, but without increases in the north-west or south-east We also examined the effects of allowing δ H i to vary between SA3s, by setting it to the proportion of residents in each SA3 who work within their SA3. This had a relatively small effect on the proportion of infections in each SA3, and did not improve the model agreement with the observed distribution of notified influenza cases. To account for the near-ten-fold difference in resident populations (ranging from 27,426 to 233,138 in each SA3), we also compared the relative risk of infection in the model to the relative risk of influenza case notifications, as shown in Fig. 9 . This figure shows model results for δ C = 0.2, which is the region in parameter space where both the absolute and population-weighted differences between the relative risks were smallest. The primary differences are similar to those previously identified: under-estimated risks in the Inner South (208), North East (209), and South East (212), and over-estimated risks in the mid-east (outer regions of 207 and inner regions of 211), and West (213).
