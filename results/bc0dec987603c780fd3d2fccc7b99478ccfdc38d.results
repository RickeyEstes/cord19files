Sequence analysis of the 3' end of the CCV genome CCV cDNA clones were prepared and selected as described under Materials and Methods. Most clones were derived from CCV strain K378, a field isolate from The Netherlands (Fig. 1) . A clone derived from the laboratory strain l-71 (Binn et al., 1975) was partially analyzed. The nucleotide sequences from these strains were more than 99% identical. We obtained a contiguous sequence of strain K378, extending 2.5 kb from the poly(A)-tail in the 5' direction ( Fig. 2) . Translation of the nucleotide sequence revealed three ORFs corresponding to the N protein and ORFs 6a and 6b of FIPV. The organization of the 3'end of the CCV genome was compared to that of FIPV and TGEV (Fig. 5 ). CCV contains an ORF 6b and an ORF 6a with 69 additional nucleotides which are lacking in ORF 7 of TGEV. The amino acid sequences were aligned with the corresponding sequences of FIPV and TGEV to determine the percentages of identical amino acid residues (Table 1). The N and 6a amino acid sequences have a higher level of identity when compared between CCV and TGEV than between CCV and FIPV. The same was found when the nucleotide sequences were compared. The 6b amino acid sequences of CCV and FIPV were only 58% identical and several small insertions in the CCV sequence were found. Nevertheless, the hydrophobicity plots of the putative 6b proteins were remarkably similar (data not shown), including a short hydrophobic amino-terminus, which may function as a signal sequence. In contrast to the FIPV ORF 6b, the CCV ORF 6b contains no potential N-glycosylation site. PCR amplification of cDNA derived from the 3' end of the FECV genome The nucleotide sequences flanking the ORFs 6a and 6b of FIPV and CCV and ORF 7 of TGEV were aligned to design primers for cDNA synthesis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The positions of the primers are indicated in Fig. 3 . Synthetic oligonucleotide 179 was used to prime cDNA synthesis on total RNA isolated from FECV and CCV-infected cells. The cDNA synthesis was followed by PCR amplification after addition of primer 178. The CCV product had the expected size of approximately 1 kbp (data not shown). The FECV product was considerably smaller, being approximately 750 bp. The controls with RNAfrom mockinfected cells and without RNA were both negative. The sequence analysis presented below revealed that the FECV ORF 6b extended into the sequences used to design the PCR primers. Therefore, cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification were repeated with synthetic oligonucleotides 185 and 178, resulting in a fragment of approximately 950 bp (data not shown).
