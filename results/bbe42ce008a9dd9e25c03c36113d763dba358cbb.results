To identify putative host proteins associated with the RCNMV replicase complex, we expressed six-His/FLAG-tagged p27 and p88 pol replication proteins (p27-HF and p88 pol -HF, respectively) together with an RNA2 replication template via agroinfiltration in N. benthamiana. Twodays after infiltration (dai), RCNMV replication proteins were purified via sequential affinity purification using nickel-agarose beads and FLAG-affinity resins as described in the Materials and Methods section. Note that p27-HF and p88 pol -HF replication proteins can support RNA2 replication in N. benthamiana plants, although their activities were low compared with those of non-tagged p27 and p88 pol (S1 Fig) . The purified fraction was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to separate the proteins that copurified with RCNMV replication proteins. A silverstained gel showed the presence of many protein bands that were absent in the control fraction prepared from Agrobacterium-infiltrated N. benthamiana leaves expressing non-tagged p27 and p88 pol together with RNA2 (Fig 1) . LC/MS/MS analysis of the isolated proteins excised from gels led to the identification of many host proteins (Fig 1 and S1 Table) . These proteins included PLDα and PLDβ, and several Arf1 effector proteins, such as coatomer subunits and clathrin heavy chain, in addition to previously identified host factors, HSP70 and HSP90 [16] , and Arf1 [15] . It is known that the activities of yeast and mammalian PLDs are stimulated by Arf1 [37] and Arf1 is an essential host factor in RCNMV RNA replication [15] . Therefore, we investigated whether PLDα and PLDβ are also required for RCNMV RNA replication. We isolated cDNAs encoding PLDα and PLDβ from N. benthamiana leaves. Deduced amino acid sequences and peptide sequences identified from LC/MS/MS analysis are presented in S2 Fig. To confirm the association of N. benthamiana (Nb)PLDα and NbPLDβ with RCNMV replication proteins, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay in N. benthamiana plants using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused NbPLDα or NbPLDβ as bait proteins. We co-expressed p88 pol -HF together with p27 and RNA2, because p88 pol can be detected by immunoblot in N. benthamiana only when viral RNA replication takes place [12] . Both p27 and p88 pol -HF were co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-NbPLDα or GFP-NbPLDβ, but not with GFP (Fig 2A) , confirming the association of these PLDs with RCNMV replication proteins. To investigate whether PLDs localize at VRCs, GFP-NbPLDα or GFP-NbPLDβ was co-expressed with mCherry-fused p27 (as a marker of VRC), p88 pol , and RNA2 via agroinfiltration Identification of proteins copurified with RCNMV replication proteins. The solubilized total fractions prepared from Agrobacterium-infiltrated leaves expressing p27 plus p88 plus RNA2 or p27-His-FLAG (p27-HF) plus p88-His-FLAG (p88-HF) plus RNA2 were subjected to affinity purification with Ni-NTA agarose beads, followed by anti-FLAG affinity resins. The affinity-purified fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained using MS-compatible silver staining. Protein bands were excised, subjected to in-gel digestion, and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Some of the proteins that were identified in LC/MS/MS analysis are listed in S1 Table. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004909.g001 Roles of Phosphatidic Acid in Virus RNA Replication PLOS Pathogens | DOI:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004909 May 28, 2015 in N. benthamiana. At 4 dai, the fluorescence of GFP-NbPLDα and GFP-NbPLDβ was partially merged with the fluorescence of p27-mCherry in large aggregate structures (Fig 2B panels I  and II) , which are induced by p27 and are thought to be the site of RCNMV RNA replication [13, 15, 16] . The expression of GFP-NbPLDα or GFP-NbPLDβ alone did not induce such aggregated structures (Fig 2B panels III and IV) , suggesting that both NbPLDα and NbPLDβ are recruited to viral replication sites during RCNMV replication. To investigate whether p27 or p88 pol interact with NbPLDα and NbPLDβ, we performed a co-IP assay in cell lysates prepared from evacuolated tobacco BY-2 protoplasts (BYL) [38] . Cterminally HA-tagged viral replication protein (p27-HA or p88 pol -HA) was coexpressed with C-terminally FLAG-tagged PLD (NbPLDα-FLAG or NbPLDβ-FLAG) from capped transcripts in BYL. In BYL, p88 pol -HA was easily detected by immunoblot using anti-HA antibody in the absence of other viral components after 2 hour of in vitro translation ( Fig 2C) . After in vitro translation, the extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using FLAG-affinity resin. Immunoblot analysis showed that p88 pol -HA, but not p27-HA, was copurified with both NbPLDα-FLAG and NbPLDβ-FLAG ( Fig 2C) . p88 pol -HA was not copurified with C-terminally FLAG-tagged firefly luciferase (FLuc-FLAG) that was used as a negative control, excluding the possibility that p88 pol -HA binds to FLAG-affinity resin nonspecifically. In reciprocal co-IP experiments using HA antibody, we also found copurification of NbPLDα-FLAG with p88 pol -HA, but not with FLuc-HA or p27-HA (S3 Fig). However, as NbPLDβ-FLAG was co-purified not only with p88 pol -HA but also with FLuc-HA or p27-HA (S3 Fig), we could not confirm the specific interaction of p88 pol with NbPLDβ in BYL.
