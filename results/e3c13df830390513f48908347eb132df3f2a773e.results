Initially, 749 newspaper articles were retrieved, of which 161 articles, 74 from UK papers and 87 from US newspapers remained following removal of duplicates and excluded articles (Figure 1 ). Inter-rater kappa values ranged from 0.5 to 1.0, indicating moderate to perfect agreement between coders [24] . The mean inter-rater kappa value across all of the coded variables was 0.65; this is similar to the level of inter-rater agreement reported in previous quantitative content analyses involving the newspaper media [19, 25] .
