Etiology and demographics of the subjects with ARIs 1610 healthy adults were prospectively enrolled before the influenza seasons of 2009-10 and 2010-11. Of these, 142 (8.8%) who subsequently developed a moderate influenza-like illness were enrolled for follow up; none met the criteria for severe respiratory disease. Of the 142 enrolled ill subjects, 133 reported for all scheduled study visits and had technically adequate gene expression data (vide infra). Table 1 summarizes the infection and demographic data for these 133 subjects. Viral culture and RT-PCR for respiratory viruses indicated that 64 were infected with influenza A virus, and 9 were infected with influenza B virus. Infection with a rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSVA/RSVB), coronavirus (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1), or enterovirus (Entero) was also detected in a number of the subjects with influenza-like symptoms. There were 24 individuals with an influenza-like illness for whom no virus was identified. The subjects were predominantly European-Americans (80.5%), consistent with the study area population.
