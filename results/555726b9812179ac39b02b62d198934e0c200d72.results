The 293 respiratory samples were collected from 156 females and 137 males (mean age: 13.1; median: 2.7; range: 0 months to 99 years). The mean age from those 148 from the French Flu survey network was 24.5 years and median was 16.9 years. The mean age from those 145 collected from children attending the Pediatric Unit of the Toulouse University Hospital was 1.6 years and the median was 0.4 years. The PLEX-ID TM and the RespiFinder 速 reference assay gave discrepant results for 19 samples. Of these, 7 were PLEX-ID TM positive and RespiFinder 速 negative. There were 5 influenza A: three H1N1 pdm09, one non-H1N1pdm09 and one H3N2 influenza A virus. Three of these samples were positive for RSV with the RespiFinder 速 DC kit assay and were collected from children attending the emergency unit. Twelve samples were PLEX ID TM negative and RespiFinder 速 positive: ten samples were influenza A positive and two were influenza B positive.
