We begin with the stochastic system described first, in which binding to the gene is coupled with n-mer formation (this could be either because the binding to the gene is itself cooperative or because it is very fast once the n-mer is formed). In the described regime, whose deterministic solutions yield at best decaying oscillation, we now explore the possibility of noise-induced oscillation. We note that the system in this case is between truly oscillatory and simply two-state with reasonably frequent switching. Simple two-state switching would lead to a 'period distribution' (time between maxima) with a normalized standard deviation of that period rt t of 1 ffiffi 2 p . Fig. 1b shows rt t , and Fig. 1a shows the coherence (generalized from the definition used in Ref. [2] ). Coherence is defined as 2 P t Hðd/ðtÞÞ P t jd/ðtÞj À 1 where / is the angle in mRNA-protein space from the average concentration, and d/ðtÞ ¼ /ðtÞ À /ðt À 0:1Þ. It is, in essence, a measure of how often a system goes forward (clockwise) instead of backward (counterclockwise) in its oscillation. Both the coherence and rt t strongly imply that increased cooperativity yields a steadier oscillatory behavior, but that in the regions explored there is no coherent oscillation (which would require a coherence close to 1 and a value of rt t significantly less than 1). So far, the only pieces of the puzzle considered have been multimer binding of proteins to genes, mRNA, and noise. We now add the final piece, the possibility of proteins binding together before they bind to the gene. The number of steps involved here keeps oscillation from occurring at a cooperativity of 1, but increased n causes oscillatory behavior when combined with the rest of the system. Specifically, Fig. 2 shows a stochastic system with n ¼ 16 and the distribution of periods, defined here as time between local maxima in protein number which are at least 0:4 Á s mRNA (in order to remove less significant fluctuations from consideration). This system is clearly oscillatory, with a reasonably sharp period distribution. It should be noted that 16 is at best a marginally reasonable value for cooperativity in a simple genetic system. However, it is clear now that simple intermediate steps can interact with cooperativity, and between them can produce oscillations in which neither is the primary factor in the behavior. Furthermore, examining the parameter space in more detail, we find telling behavior in both deterministic and stochastic cases. Fig. 3a shows the deterministic phase diagram of the system, made using timeseries calculations. Region I is oscillatory, region II displays decaying oscillation, and region III is non-oscillatory. High cooperativity and synthesis rate are both clearly necessary for this; also, it should again be noted that the additional intermediate step as compared with the system from Fig. 1 is necessary for deterministic oscillation. In Fig. 3b , we see, in the same region, a graph of the coherence. It corresponds well with the deterministic calculations: the system reliably goes in the correct direction (associated with time going forward) in the stochastic case when its parameters would predict that it is deterministically oscillatory. Fig. 3c shows rt t , which again corresponds well, although not perfectly; some loss of specificity in period at very high cooperativity and synthesis implies that the oscillation may be imperfect or require that other parameters be very specific at some level. However, the increase in rt t at these points is slight. From these figures, it is apparent that coherence is possible with higher rates of synthesis, and that there is a tendency towards higher coherence with higher cooperativity. Additionally, we note that in the stochastic case there is no jump in coherence or rt t as we would find if the system exhibited the phase-transition behavior from the deterministic system, Fig. 3a ; in the stochastic case ( Fig. 3b and c) , the line between oscillatory and non-oscillatory is blurred. It is important to note that noise alone is not sufficient for reliable or even semi-reliable oscillation. The deterministically oscillating region clearly has more stable oscillation in the stochastic regime, and systems close to it are more capable of reliable behavior than those far away from it. For comparison, we now choose a point in the region of deterministic decaying oscillations, and make plots comparable to Fig. 2. In Fig. 4 we see a system whose behavior seems similar in many ways; the main difference in this case is a slightly widened period distribution. While this system is definitely in region II of Fig. 3a (with a cooperativity of 8) , and the period distribution may be too wide for a truly accurate clock, it is obvious that the line between coherent oscillation and incoherent oscillation-like behavior is blurred in this case by noise. We see in these figures that the optimal cooperativity for this number of intermediate steps in binding is still, at best, at the very high end of cooperativity in reasonable biological systems. Therefore, we have attempted a less complete search of parameters considering additional steps (instead of monomer to n-mer, monomer to dimer to tetramer, etc.). While our searches were not exhaustive, we found at least one region in which such a system can oscillate at quite reasonable values for n, as low as 8 (octamer). For reference, this is not an uncommon amount of cooperativity for these sorts of proteins. SARS-CoV nsp10, for instance, forms a dodecameric structure (n ¼ 12) [19] ; Rhizobium leguminosarum NodD has been shown to bind to DNA preferentially in octamer form [20] ; and k phage CI, while it has a small autoregulatory effect with tetramer and even dimer forms, only fully represses itself when an octamer form of the protein links distant sites on DNA together [21] .
