Ninety-nine pediatric HCWs were recruited in this study. Fortynine HCWs were recruited in October 2012 and 50 in August 2013. In our study, across both periods, the rate of positive respiratory ID badge-lanyard samples was 1.0% (95% confidence interval, 0-5.5) ( Table 2 ). This compares with an overall 56.4% positive rate in tests ordered on pediatric patients across the study period for respiratory viruses. One ID badge-lanyard swab over the study period was positive for parainfluenza virus type 3. This is in the context of 11 positive parainfluenza virus type 3 results out of 286 pediatric samples in the preceding 60 days prior to the positive HCW ID result, with no parainfluenza outbreak during that time. There were no positive HCWs samples for gastrointestinal viruses (Table 2 ). During the overall study period, 4.9% of pediatric fecal samples tested positive for norovirus and rotavirus.
