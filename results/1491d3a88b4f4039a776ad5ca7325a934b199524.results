Unsolicited fecal samples from 38 dogs were identified as submitted by veterinarians for T. foetus PCR testing from years 2007 to 2010. PCR assays performed on DNA extracted from each sample identified 2 and 18 dogs respectively, as infected with T. foetus or P. hominis. One of these dogs was positive for amplification of both T. foetus and P. hominis. PCR amplification products from 17/19 dogs identified as positive for P. hominis by PCR were available for bi-directional sequencing. All 17 samples had >98% sequence identity to P. hominis (GenBank #HQ149970). Extracts of fecal DNA from the remaining 19 dogs were PCR negative for T. foetus and P. hominis and amplicons Campylobacter spp. 10 (71) 6 (43) 7 (37) Clostridium difficile Toxin A 0 (0) 0 (0) 1 (5) Clostridium difficile Toxin B 0 (0) 0 (0) 1 (5) Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin A 4 (29) 8 (57) 1 (5) Salmonella spp. 1 (7) 0 (0) 0 (0) Canine distemper virus 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) Canine enteric coronavirus 6 (43) 2 (14) 0 (0) Canine parvovirus 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) Cryptosporidium spp. 3 (21) 4 (29) 2 (11) Giardia spp. 4 (29) 2 (14) 2 (11) Pentatrichomonas hominis 13 (93) 0 (0) 0 (0) a Tritrichomonas foetus 2 (14) 0 (0) 0 (0) a Group A; dogs with diarrhea and trichomonosis.

Positive results for PCR amplification of 16S bacterial rRNA genes were obtained from all fecal samples and contamination was not observed in any negative control DNA extractions or PCR reactions. Medical records information was obtained for 36/38 (95%) of the dogs. These records included 18 dogs that tested PCR-positive for trichomonosis (Group A) and 18 dogs that tested PCR-negative for trichomonosis (Group B). Twelve dogs (10 Group A and 2 Group B) resided in a military working dog facility in South Africa. The location of 6 dogs was not recorded and the remaining 20 dogs resided in different geographical locations within the U.S. The dogs were represented by 20 different breeds. German Shepherd Dogs were most common (11 dogs) of which 8 resided in the non-U.S. facility. Age of the dogs ranged from 10 weeks to 10 years (median, 2.0 years). Twenty-one dogs were male (14 intact, 7 castrated) and 15 were female (8 intact, 7 spayed). No differences in breed, age or sex were observed between Group A and Group B dogs. Fecal consistency was recorded in the medical record of 33/36 dogs. All dogs had diarrhea that was variably described as soft, mucoid, hemorrhagic, or watery. Fecal diagnostics results were reported for a subset dogs. A direct examination of feces revealed flagellated protozoa in 17/17 dogs in Group A and 5/8 dogs in Group B. A fecal flotation revealed parasite ova in 3/5 dogs in Group A and 3/8 dogs in Group B that corresponded in identity to Toxocara spp. (2 dogs), Coccidia spp. (3 dogs), and Giardia spp. (3 dogs). Giardia spp. specific antigen test results were positive for 4/5 dogs in Group A and 1/6 dogs in Group B. No differences in recorded fecal diagnostic test results were identified between Group A and Group B dogs. Three dogs from Group B had an active history of underlying primary gastrointestinal disease including histiocytic ulcerative colitis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis. An underlying primary gastrointestinal disease was not recorded in the medical record of any dogs in Group A. Extracts of fecal DNA from Group A and B dogs (n = 14 each) and a control group of dogs without diarrhea or trichomonosis (Group C; 19 dogs) were tested by means of real-time PCR for evidence of concurrent infection with a known canine enteropathogen. Five samples from both Groups A and B had insufficient quantity or quality of DNA for comprehensive infectious disease testing and were not included in the assays. Enteric infections with pathogenic potential other than P. hominis or T. foetus were identified in 12/14 dogs (86%) in Group A, 12/14 dogs (86%) in Group B and 10/19 dogs (53%) in Group C. The presence of >1 possible enteropathogen was identified in 9/14 (64%) Group A dogs, 6/14 (43%) Group B dogs and only 3/19 (16%) Group C dogs. The number of enteropathogens identified was generally higher among dogs with diarrhea compared to those without diarrhea. However, there were no significant differences in number or specific identities of enteropathogens present between diarrheic dogs with or without trichomonosis. The specific infectious agents identified in each Group are listed in Table 1 .
