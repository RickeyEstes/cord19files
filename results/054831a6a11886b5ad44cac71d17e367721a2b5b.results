Quantitative proteomic analysis was used to investigate the potential changes in the host cell proteome in response to infection with HRSV. Cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts to reduce sample complexity for LC-MS/MS but also to provide an excellent way to further probe the interaction of a cytoplasmic replicating virus with the nuclear and cytoplasmic proteomes. To our knowledge, no previous study has used SILAC coupled with LC-MS/MS to identify and quantify proteome changes in cells infected with HRSV or any other single-stranded negative sense RNA viruses. The observed changes were then validated and investigated using a combination of immunofluorescence to study subcellular localization, Western blot to study protein abundance, and functional assays applied where appropriate.
