Details on age, outcome, vaccination status, and leukogram of the dogs included in the present study are summarized in Table 1 . The majority of animals included were puppies, unvaccinated or intermittently vaccinated against CPV, and showed leukopenia in their whole blood count. All samples submitted to CPV sequencing (n ¼ 24) were typed as CPV-2b. Forty dogs (48.8%) were positive for C. perfringens type A, but only three strains were also positive for the enterotoxin-encoding gene (cpe) ( Table 2 ). One of these strains was also positive for netE and netF. The stool sample of this dog was positive for CPE in the commercial EIA kit. Two out of the three dogs positive for enterotoxigenic C. perfringens, including the one positive for C. perfringens netF þ , survived after treatment. C. difficile was isolated from ten (12.2%) dogs, but only one (1.2%) strain was toxigenic (A þ B þ CDT-) ( Table 2 ). This stool sample was also positive for A/B toxins in EIA. This dog also recovered after treatment. No dog was simultaneously positive for CDI and enterotoxigenic C. perfringens in the present study.
