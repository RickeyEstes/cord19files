FGL2 is highly induced in the plasma of fgl2 +/+ mice following infection with LCMV WE Following infection of fgl2 +/+ mice with 2610 6 PFU LCMV WE, plasma levels of FGL2 increased from basal level of 0.860.2 ng/ml reaching a peak of 7.860.5 ng/ml on day 8 pi and remained elevated at all time points studied (up to day 50) when compared to uninfected (naive) mice (Figure 1 ). FGL2 was undetectable in the plasma of fgl2 2/2 mice both pre and post LCMV infection as expected (data not shown). Targeted deletion of fgl2 leads to enhanced maturation of DC following infection with LCMV WE Expression levels of the DC maturation markers CD80 and MHC class II were assessed on DC which were isolated from spleens and lymph nodes of LCMV-infected fgl2 +/+ or fgl2 2/2 mice on day 1 post LCMV WE infection. As shown in Figure 2A , the expression levels of CD80 and MHC class II on DC from fgl2 2/2 mice were significantly higher compared to fgl2 +/+ mice indicating that targeted deletion of fgl2 leads to increased activation of DC following infection with LCMV WE.
