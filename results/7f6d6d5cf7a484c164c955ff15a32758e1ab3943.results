With respect to the participants' basic information and the sex distribution within the two groups, male students accounted for 64.6% (53 people) while female students accounted for 35.4% (29 people). For the experimental group learning the core curriculum through the flipped classroom, the average score on graduation was 88.2 ± 4.9 while for the control group learning through the traditional teaching method, it was 87.3 ± 5.4; thus, no statistical difference was observed in the two groups. The average age for the experimental and control groups was 26.9 ± 0.9 and 26.5 ± 1.1, respectively, which was also not a statistically significant difference. In terms of the distribution of divisions in the experimental and control groups, the number of students from general medicine was 8 and 9, respectively; from general surgery, 8 and 8, respectively; and from other divisions, 23 and 26, respectively; again, no statistically significant difference was noted Table 3 outlines these results. Other Divisions 26 23 The correlation between the variables in the theoretical model of reasoned action and the intention of participating in learning the core curriculum through the flipped classroom reached the significance level. The correlation between self-efficacy and behavioral intention was the highest (r = .491, P < .01), followed by attitude (r = 0.365, P < 0.01) and subjective norms (r = 0.360, P < 0.01). All three showed positive correlations with behavioral intention; among attitude, subjective norms, and self-efficacy, the pairwise correlations also reached the significance level (Table 4 ). Furthermore, by including self-efficacy in the regression model with attitude and subjective norms, it was revealed that self-efficacy had the greatest influence on behavioral intention (β = 0.385, P < 0.001) while the effects of attitude and subjective norms on behavioral intention were identical (β = 0.155, P < 0.01) ( Table 5) . This study mainly focused on employing the theory of reasoned action to predict and explain the participants' behavioral intention to participate in learning the core curriculum through the flipped classroom. The following points attempt to synthesize the relationship of the various key variables (Fig 2) to verify whether they correspond with this study's theoretical viewpoints and investigate the theory's suitability for studying the behavioral intention to participate in learning the core curriculum through the flipped classroom. The findings are as follows: 1. The correlation of attitude, subjective norms, and self-efficacy with the behavioral intention to participate in the learning of the core curriculum through the flipped classroom reached significance level; learning intention was most correlated with the participants' self-efficacy while its correlations with subjective norms and attitude were identical. 2. With regard to behavior belief, outcome evaluation, normative belief, and motivation to comply, the participants reached overall significant differences. 3. The sum of the cross products of attitude and behavior belief was significantly and positively correlated with outcome evaluation and that of subjective norms and normative belief with motivation to comply also showed the same correlation. 4. The study supports the theory of reasoned action: students' attitudes and subjective norms in performing a certain behavior were the two main factors affecting their behavioral intention; the effect can be further enhanced if self-efficacy is added to attitude and subjective norms. Moreover, after the intervention of the learning of the core curriculum through the flipped classroom, these students were assayed of daily clinical works and basic tests by clinic physicians, and significant differences were observed in the knowledge and attitudes of the students of the experimental group. They became more independent in their learning, their attitude assessment (360˚evaluation, six core competencies) indicated greater mutual cooperation, and they showed more confident in their work (Table 6 ).
