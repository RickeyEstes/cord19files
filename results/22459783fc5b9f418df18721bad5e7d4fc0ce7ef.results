3.1. The distribution of single nucleotide polymorphism loci of SARS-CoV genome Eight hundred and seventy-six mutation loci were identified among the 145 complete or partial SARS-CoV genomes (the over all mutation rate was 2.94%, 876/29 751), of which 174 loci were identified in more than two genome sequences. To avoid errors that might be introduced by sequencing and cell culture passages, only the latter group of 174 loci was analyzed. Different characteristics of the polymorphism sites were found. The loci related to T mutation accounted for 60.9% (106/174), and C, A and G mutation loci accounted for 39.6% (69/174), 39.0% (68/174) and 27.0% (47/174), respectively. It was obvious that T mutation had the priority. Most of the loci, except for 7 sites, were limited to one pair of nucleotide variations. One hundred and twenty loci were transition mutations (78 CT, 42 AG), and 48 loci were transversion mutations. The ratio of transition mutations to transversion mutations was 2.5 (120/48), and 6 loci were of deletion mutation.
