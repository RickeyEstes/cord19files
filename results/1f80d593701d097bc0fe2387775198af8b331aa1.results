A total of 210 dairy calves were necropsied during this study, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 10 calves necropsied on a given day. Of those necropsied, 88% (184) were ≤30 d of age, 9% (19) were >30 but ≤60 d of age, and 3% (7) were weaned and >60 d old. Budgetary constraints dictated that 122 (58%) cases were submitted to WADDL. Of those submitted to WADDL, 89% (109) were ≤30 d of age, 9% (11) were >30 but ≤60 d of age, and 2% (2) were weaned and >60 d old but ≤90 d of age. Treatment-based diagnoses of causes of death based on input from calf health managers and relevant treatment records categorized almost two-thirds (65%; 137/210) of the deaths due to diarrhea or diarrhea and respiratory (Table 1 ). An additional 16% (34) of the total deaths were attributed to respiratory disease alone. Of the other categories for dairy calf deaths, 10% (20) of deaths fell under postnatal death, 4% (8) were unknown, and ≤2% (≤4) were accounted for by each of the categories "congenital defects," "joint or navel," "other digestive," and "other known," in contrast to the findings with causes of death based on additional input from on-farm necropsy-based postmortem analysis without input from WADDL. Overall, necropsy-based postmortem diagnoses categorized 21% (44/210) of deaths due to diarrhea or diarrhea and respiratory disease. Respiratory disease alone was indicated in only 6% (13) of all cases. However, the "other digestive" category captured almost 50% (104) of cases primarily because of diagnosing necrotizing, ulcerative enteritis 4419 and typhlitis. For those 122 cases with diagnostic input from WADDL, the percent of deaths attributed to diarrhea or diarrhea and respiratory fell to 16% (19) , and respiratory disease alone accounted for only 3% of deaths (4). On the other hand, "other digestive" deaths rose to 56% (68) due to additional histopathologic diagnoses of necrotizing, ulcerative GI lesions. Based on postmortem evaluation, each of the other categories for dairy calf deaths contained ≤4% of cases, both with (≤5) and without (≤8) input from WADDL, aside from the 9% of cases assigned to postnatal death both with (11) and without (19) input from WADDL. Comparative results of diagnostic agreement between the standard treatment-based records with and without input from on-farm necropsy-based postmortem analyses are presented in Table 2 (part a). The proportion The primary driver of discrepancies between treatment-based diagnoses and those established following postmortem evaluations had to do with the reassign-ment of cases from diarrhea or diarrhea and respiratory to the category "other digestive" (Table 1) . Only occasional treatment-based diagnoses entirely failed to account for the pathophysiologic system underlying the mortality phenotype identified through postmortem evaluations. For those few cases, treatment-based diagnoses such as diarrhea or unknown overlooked issues such as esophageal tubing injuries (accidents) or omphalitis (joint or navel). Many of the cases that presented clinically with and were treated for diarrhea and potentially respiratory distress ultimately proved to suffer from specific lesions and infections that could only be diagnosed by necropsy or histopathology (Table 3) . This was especially apparent for 83 cases of necrotizing, ulcerative enterocolitis Cause of death comparisons were based on modified categories for dairy calf deaths ( Figure 1 ) and focused on diarrhea, diarrhea and respiratory, respiratory, and other categories collapsed together. Agreement between on-farm treatment records with or without input from necropsy-based postmortem evaluations but no input from WADDL is shown in part (a); agreement between on-farm treatment records with or without input from postmortem evaluations including WADDL results is shown in part (b); agreement between on-farm treatment records with input from postmortem evaluations but with or without input from WADDL results is shown in part (c Although those necrotizing, ulcerative cases arguably had clinical signs and lesions aligned along a pathophysiologic continuum from GI injury to sepsis, the lack of detail inherent to standard treatment-based causes of death led to different categorizations along the calf death loss flowchart and failed to identify meaningful characteristics necessary for understanding the progression of disease and pathways for intervention. Informative phenotypic detail across the spectrum of dairy calf death categories was provided by postmortem evaluations founded on necropsies with input from WADDL when available (Table 3) . Aside from the specific lesions and infectious agents detailed within the "other digestive" category, most cases assigned to the other broad categories also benefited from insight into aspects of disease progression, severity, duration, and infection. For example, enterocolitis could be found across categories (diarrhea, diarrhea and respiratory, other digestive), but associated pathology (e.g., bronchopneumonia, peritonitis, septicemia) and level of severity (e.g., mild, suppurative, ulcerative) ultimately dictated how a case aligned within the calf death loss categorization scheme. The specificity of the mortality phenotypes stood in stark contrast to the otherwise generic cause of death diagnoses derived from treatments alone and provided meaningful insight into pathophysiological processes capable of informing therapeutic and preventive practices. This held true even for those cases that were assigned to the postnatal death category as a straightforward function of the timing of death (≤24 h of age). Specific pathologic findings and infections still spoke to consequential problems beyond an ill-defined maladaptation to life. In fact, postmortem evaluations were informative even for the 1% (3/210) of cases for which a cause of death remained unknown, to the extent that the findings documented the absence of specific issues of concern.
