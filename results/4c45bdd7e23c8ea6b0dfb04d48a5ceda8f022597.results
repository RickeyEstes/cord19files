The lung is an essential respiration organ with complex threedimensional configuration. About 90% of the lung is filled with air. IL-XPCI Computed tomography study was performed on a 1-dayold mouse. The results showed that the major features of the lung, including bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli can be clearly displayed. Moreover, it is remarkable that the alveoli can be observed in three dimensions. A CT projection image of the mouse lung is shown in Figure 1A . Although in this image, all the tissues overlapped with each other, some bronchi, lobes and many alveoli can be discerned. Figure 1B and C are two slices of the CT reconstruction images. Compared to conventional X-ray CT, in-line X-ray phase contrast CT had a much higher resolution (about 13 mm in our experiment). Bone, bronchi and alveoli were easily discernible with clear edges, which made it possible to separate different anatomical structures using the image segmentation technique. In order to extract the lung tissue and remove background noise, we applied a threshold-based image segmentation method to the CT slices. A comparison between original CT slice and threshold-based segmentation result is presented in Figure 2 . The threshold was chosen at the valley of the histogram ( Figure 2B ). Other pixels with intensity lower than the threshold were set to zero. After gray scale transformation, the resulted image was shown in Figure 2D . From the profiles at the white line drawn in the same place of the two CT slices, the background noise in the image was considerably reduced. Surface rendering method was used to visualize the lung, which allowed a clear depiction of complex spatial relationships and provided a strong space sense. By manually selecting the value of the reconstruction iso-surface, 3D models of tissues in the mouse chest cavity were obtained. All 3D models can be varied in size and rotated in real time to facilitate a detailed assessment of each structure (Video S1). As shown in Figure 3 , a surface rendering view of lung is displayed. The three-dimensional relationships among bronchiole, alveolar duct and alveoli were all visible. Through the segmentation of the CT slices, three models were acquired. Figure 3A and B give an overview of chest which combines ribs, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. Figure 3C focuses on the display of bronchi and alveoli. Figure 3D is the result of image segmentation; it highlights the bronchial tree. The virtual endoscope video is also provided in the supporting information (Video S2). Moving down the respiratory tract from the trachea, the air ducts divided more into smaller branches. The alveoli are the final branching of the respiratory tree, where the gas/blood exchange occurs. The distribution of the alveoli reveals information regarding lung health. Immature 1-day-old mouse alveoli range in diameter from 100 to 150 mm [15] . The diameter of most alveoli in our reconstruction image was in this range. Figure 4 is a detailed demonstration of one small section of the lung. These images provided a magnified view of the alveolar sacs and the alveoli. The model could be cut at any angle, varied in size, and rotated in real time. As shown in Figure 4 , it was easy to measure the morphological characteristics, which was of great importance in the diagnosis of diseases related to alveolus and alveolar scar. In order to illustrate the alveoli more precisely, we only focused on several of them. Twenty-one single alveoli were chosen from different part of the lung. The three-dimensional images of the alveoli were shown in Figure 5A . The maximum diameter and the minimum diameter were measured in Figure 5B . The ratio of maximum and minimum diameters reflects the morphology of the alveoli to some extent. If this ratio approximates one, the shape of the alveolus is closer to a spheroid. The alveoli provide an enormous surface area for respiratory exchange; the change of alveolar surface area is closely related to lung health. For this reason, we calculated the surface area of each alveolus, as shown in Figure 5C .
