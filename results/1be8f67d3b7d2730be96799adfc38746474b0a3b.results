Antigen-positive rate of PCV2-and/or PRRSV-inoculated swine AMs During 18 to 108 HPI, a steady positive rate of pin-like intracytoplasmic signals for PCV2 antigens, ranging from 91.7 ± 2.3 to 96.3 ± 0.5%, was detected in all groups receiving PCV2 ( Figure 1A) ; a low but constant intracytoplasmic PRRSV antigen-positive rate, about 5.2 ± 1.0 to 9.9 ± 0.2% and 6.1 ± 0.5 to 9.1 ± 1.3%, was noted in the groups of PRRSV and PRRSV/PCV2, respectively ( Figure 1B ). No intranuclear PCV2 or PRRSV antigens were observed during the experimental period. In the groups of PCV2/ PRRSV and PCV2-PRRSV, however, the PRRSV antigenpositive rates were 5.6 ± 1.1% and 4.2 ± 0.1% at 36 HPI, but it gradually reduced to 1.2 ± 0.2 % and 3.5 ± 0.4% at 72 HPI, then further dropped to 0.9 ± 0.3% and 2.9 ± 1.1% by 108 HPI, respectively. They were constantly and significantly lower (P < 0.041) than those of PRRSV and PRRSV/ PCV2 groups during 54 to 108 HPI ( Figure 1B) . Neither PCV2 nor PRRSV antigens were detected in AMs from the pigs in the Mock group.
