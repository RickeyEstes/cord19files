Complete genome sequence of a serotype I FECV field isolate. In this study, we aimed to establish a reverse genetics system based on a serotype I FECV field isolate. As starting material, fecal samples from a clinically healthy cat with a long-term history of FECV shedding were collected. The full-length genomic sequence was determined by sequence analyses of overlapping reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) fragments amplified from viral RNA and was deposited in GenBank (see below). The 29,298-nucleotide (nt) genome of the serotype I FECV field isolate had the typical genome organization of FCoVs. The 5= untranscribed regions (5=UTRs) and 3=UTRs of the FECV genome were found to comprise 311 and 276 nt, respectively. Downstream of the replicase gene (nt 312 to 20416), four structural protein genes coding for the spike protein (S) (nt 20413 to 24810), envelope protein (E) (nt 25897 to 26145), membrane protein (M) (nt 26156 to 26947), and nucleoprotein (N) (nt 26960 to 28087) are located. Accessory genes 3a, 3b, and 3c (nt 24822 to 25910) are located between the S and E genes, whereas accessory genes 7a and 7b are located downstream of the N gene (nt 28092 to 29022). Recovery of chimeric FECV with serotype II S gene. Vaccinia virus-based systems have been shown to be excellent tools for the generation and genetic manipulation of full-length coronavirus (CoV) cDNA clones that can be used to produce full-length genome RNA that, following transfection, initiates a viral replication in suitable cells (40, (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) . Generally, virus titers obtained after transfection (passage 0) are low and the production of high-titer virus stocks of the recombinant viruses requires an amplification step in vitro. Accordingly, reverse genetic systems have been established only for CoVs (including FCoVs) for which cell culture systems are available that efficiently support viral replication (40, (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) . Serotype I FECV field isolates cannot be propagated in standard cell culture systems. To address this problem, we sought to recover recombinant FECV without any in vitro passaging steps. As a first step toward this goal, we generated a recombinant serotype I FECV in which the S gene was replaced with that of serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146. The latter virus was chosen as an S gene donor because previous experiments had demonstrated that this particular S gene conveyed efficient viral growth in vitro (40, 47) . Using this approach, we sought to address the issue of whether the genome of the FECV field isolate characterized in this study supports the replication of and gives rise to the production of infectious FECV progeny when engineered as a chimera with the 79-1146 S gene. On the basis of vrecFCoV-II containing the full-length cDNA of serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146 (40), we constructed recombinant vaccinia virus vrecFECV-S 79 , which contains the serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146 S sequence in the backbone of the serotype I field isolate-derived cDNA. As shown in Fig. 1A , the modification of vrecFCoV-II was carried out in multiple steps by vaccinia virus-mediated homologous recombination. First, the 79-1146-derived sequences downstream of the S gene (3a, 3b, 3c, E, M, N, 7a, 7b, and the 3=UTR) were replaced by the corresponding parts of the FECV field isolate cDNA, resulting in vrecFCoV-II-FECV 3a-3´UTR . Second, serotype II-derived 5=UTR and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) sequences were removed from the cDNA and the serotype II ORF1b was replaced by the corresponding FECV part. Thus, the resulting vrecFECV 1b-3'UTR -S 79 vaccinia virus contained the FECV-derived ORF1b, ORF3abc, E, M, N, 7ab, and 3=UTR sequences and the S gene of serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146. Finally, to generate vrecFECV-S 79 , the missing parts (5=UTR and ORF1a) of the FECV field isolate were introduced into this cDNA construct. The sequence of the full-length FCoV cDNA inserted into the vaccinia virus genome was verified by sequence analysis. To recover recombinant FECV with serotype II S protein (recFECV-S 79 ), vaccinia virus DNA derived from vrecFECV-S 79 was prepared, cleaved with ClaI restriction enzyme, and used as a template for in vitro transcription as described previously (46) . The in vitro-transcribed RNA was electroporated into BHK cells, which express the homologous FECV N protein (BHK-Tet/ON-FECV-N). After 24 h of incubation, the supernatant of electroporated cells was harvested. Upon infection of feline cells with recFECV-S 79containing supernatant, a cytopathic effect (CPE) developed. The identity of recFECV-S 79 was confirmed by sequence analysis of RT-PCR products generated from viral RNA of infected Felis catus whole-fetus (FCWF) cells. The recombinant virus displayed growth characteristics similar to those displayed by serotype II FCoV strain 79-1146 and reached peak titers of 6 ϫ 10 6 PFU/ml at 18 h postinfection (p.i.) (Fig. 1B) . The plaque Taking the results together, we were able to generate a FCoV clone that contained a serotype II FCoV S gene sequence in the genomic background of serotype I FECV field isolate cDNA. Successful recovery and in vitro cultivation of recombinant viruses (recFECV-S 79 ) in feline cells led us to conclude that the serotype I FECV field isolatederived virus backbone is fully functional and enables efficient virus replication if the virus contains an S protein of an established laboratory strain. Generation and characterization of recombinant serotype I FECV. Our ultimate goal was the generation and recovery of a recombinant serotype I FECV without any heterologous sequences. Accordingly, the experiment performed with chimeric virus recFECV-S 79 as described above was only an intermediate step. To generate recombinant serotype I FECV field virus with its authentic FECV S gene, the serotype II S sequence in vrecFECV-S 79 was replaced with the appropriate S gene from the FECV field isolate, resulting in vrecFECV ( Fig. 2A) . The recovery of recombinant viruses from the full-length FECV cDNA was performed as described above. Since serotype I FECV cannot be propagated in vitro, we expected that recombinant viruses would not be able to grow in cell culture. It was therefore not surprising that inoculation of FCWF cells with the supernatant of electroporated cells did not lead to a CPE. Moreover, FECV-specific antigens could not be detected with a monoclonal antibody (anti-M) by immunofluorescence. To address the issue of whether FECV particles were released from the electroporated cells, the cell culture supernatant was subjected to an ultracentrifugation step and the pellet obtained was used for further analyses, including (i) electron microscopy, (ii) Western blotting, and (iii) RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2B , transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that in the supernatant of electroporated cells, virus particles with coronavirus-like morphological features, including the typical spike structures, were present which looked indistinguishable from recFECV-S 79 particles. To verify that the recFCoV particles contained CoV structural proteins, we performed a Western blot analysis using an M protein-specific monoclonal antibody. As shown in Fig. 2C , a prominent band corresponding to the FECV structural M protein could be detected, corroborating the release of recFCoV particles from the transfected cells. Next, the incorporation of viral genome RNA into these particles was assessed by using a capsid protection assay as described previously (49) . For this purpose, purified particles were subjected to RNase treatment to remove any free viral RNA prior to RNA extraction from the virus particles. The presence of viral genome RNA in these particles was confirmed by RT-PCR. These experiments provided convincing evidence that recombinant serotype I FECVs had been recovered from the full-length cDNA clone generated in the current study. As indicated above, the titer of this virus could not be determined by plaque assay. We therefore decided to use a Western blot analysis to estimate the amount of M protein present in purified recFECV particles. As a reference, we used the M protein content of a control virus that was known to produce infectious virus progeny following electroporation of viral genome RNA and that can be titrated by virus plaque assay. Following electroporation of in vitro-transcribed full-length genome RNAs of recFECV and recFECV-S 79 , respectively, in a parallel experiment, cell culture supernatants of electroporated cells were collected and subjected to two rounds of ultracentrifugation. The pellet fractions were resuspended in identical volumes of NTE buffer. Equal amounts of the purified recFECV and recFECV-S 79 stocks, along with 1:2 and 1:10 dilutions prepared from these stocks, were subjected to Western blot analysis using an M protein-specific monoclonal antibody to compare the amounts of M protein present in the viral rescue experiments performed with recFECV and recFECV-S 79 , respectively (Fig. 2D) . Quantification of the M protein signals in the respective diluted and undiluted fractions revealed very similar amounts of this protein for recFECV and recFECV-S 79 (Fig. 2E ). On the basis of the comparison of the M protein contents and the titers determined for recFECV-S 79 using a virus plaque assay with FCWF cells (5 ϫ 10 6 PFU/ ml), we concluded that recFECV also contained about 5 ϫ 10 6 virus particles/ml. To further support this conclusion, we also determined the genome copy numbers in all fractions (stock and dilutions 1:2 and 1:10) of recFECV and recFECV-S 79 by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) after removal of possible RNA molecules outside the particles (capsid protection assay). This experiment revealed very similar genomic RNA amounts of recFECV and recFECV-S 79 in both the undiluted and the diluted material (Fig. 2F ). . The intensity of the bands was analyzed using a ChemiDoc imaging system and Image Lab software. The intensity of each band was compared to that of the recFECV-S 79 stock. (F) Ten-microliter volumes of purified viruses (recFECV and recFECV-S 79 ) as well as their 1:2 and 1:10 dilutions were subjected to RNase A digestion to remove RNA outside viral particles. Upon RNA extraction, genome copy numbers in each of the fractions (stock; 1:2 and 1:10 dilutions) were determined (by qRT-PCR) and compared. GE, genome equivalents. Taken together, the data provide conclusive evidence that recombinant serotype I FECVs could be recovered from the cDNA clone generated in this study. While the virus particles with serotype II spike (recFECV-S 79 ) enabled efficient infection of cat cells, the authentic FECV spike did not allow the virus to grow and spread in a cell monolayer in vitro. The lack of CPE development and FECV-specific antigens in FCWF cells inoculated with recFECV-containing cell culture supernatant suggests that the in vitro propagation of recFECVs critically depends on the particular S gene used to construct this virus rather than on other viral genes. Furthermore, in spite of the inability to passage recFECV in vitro, we showed that similarly large amounts of recFECV and recFECV-S 79 virions could be recovered from cells in passage 0 without further amplification by viral passaging in permissive cells. Infection of cats with recFECV and recFECV-S 79 . Following successful recovery, the recombinant viruses were used to assess their ability to establish infection in the natural host. FCoVs with the serotype II strain 79-1146 spike have been reported to efficiently infect cats irrespective of the virus backbone (37, 40) . Accordingly, recFECV-S 79 was used as a control. Four 5-month-old seronegative specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats were infected with 1 ϫ 10 7 PFU of recFECV (cats 1 and 2) or recFECV-S 79 (cats 3 and 4). The numbers of virions used for the cat infection experiments were determined by plaque assay for recFECV-S 79 and estimated for recFECV as described above. To avoid cross-contamination, the two groups were housed separately. Previously, oronasal and intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection routes had generally been used for experimental infections of cats with FCoVs (16, 18, 40, 41, (50) (51) (52) (53) . To mimic the natural route of FCoV infections, one animal in each of both groups (cats 1 and 3) received the virus inoculum oronasally. The remaining two cats (cats 2 and 4) were inoculated intraperitoneally. The animals were monitored for clinical signs on a daily basis for a period of 8.5 weeks. To assess virus shedding, fecal swab samples were collected from each cat on a daily basis and analyzed by nested reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Furthermore, blood samples were collected weekly to monitor FCoV-specific antibody responses in serum samples during the course of the experiment. After infection, all four cats developed slight fever that disappeared 3 to 4 days postinfection (p.i.). During the remaining 8 weeks, no notable clinical symptoms could be observed in any of the four cats. While FCoV-specific viral RNA was detected in fecal swab samples from the cats infected intraperitoneally (cats 2 and 4) as early as 1 day p.i., FCoV-specific viral RNA was detected 1 day later in the animals that had been inoculated via the oronasal route (cats 1 and 3). Fecal swab samples from the cats infected with recFECV (cats 1 and 2) remained positive during the entire 8.5-week period except for a few days (Fig. 3A) . In contrast, fecal swab samples from the cats infected with recFECV-S 79 (cats 3 and 4) remained FCoV positive for only about 1 week. Later, fecal samples from these cats were found to be positive only sporadically until the end of the study (Fig. 3A ). To rule out the possibility that the negative results were due to the detection limit of the nested RT-PCR used in these studies, we subsequently used a qRT-PCR assay to reevaluate a total of 16 fecal samples (2 samples/week/cat) collected from cats 3 and 4. Two samples collected from cats 3 and 4 at 1 week p.i. that had tested positive by nested RT-PCR also tested positive using the qRT-PCR assay. The swabs obtained from cat 3 were found to contain 4.7 ϫ 10 3 and 2.9 ϫ 10 3 genome copies, respectively, while the swabs obtained from cat 4 contained 2.3 ϫ 10 3 and 1 ϫ 10 4 genome copies. Similarly, samples collected from cats 3 and 4 at 4 weeks p.i. that had tested positive by nested RT-PCR tested positive by qRT-PCR (3.45 ϫ 10 2 and 4.14 ϫ 10 2 genome copies for cats 3 and 4, respectively). The remaining samples collected from cats 3 and 4, respectively, that had tested negative by nested RT-PCR (week 2 to 8) remained also negative by the qRT-PCR assay. These data indicate that analyses of the results from the two assays (nested RT-PCR and qRT-PCR) led to the same conclusions. In addition, we measured FCoV-specific antibody titers in serum samples by end point dilution using immunofluorescence on FCoV-infected Crandell Reese feline kid-ney (CRFK) cells (Fig. 3B) . The titers against recFECV were determined using type I FCoV-infected CRFK cells, whereas the recFECV-S 79 titers were measured using type II FCoV-infected cells. Upon infection with recFECV (cats 1 and 2), the serum antibody peak titers that developed were lower than the titers observed for the cats infected with recFECV-S 79 (cats 3 and 4). In the cats inoculated intraperitoneally (cats 2 and 4), serum antibodies developed faster and reached peak titers earlier. After intraperitoneal infection of cat 4 with recFECV-S 79 , the serum antibody reached peak titers of Ͼ1: 20,480 at 3 weeks p.i. and, after a few more weeks, declined to 1:2,560. The serum antibody titers determined for cat 3, which was infected oronasally with the same virus, reached similar peak titers (Ͼ1:20,480) but only after 7 weeks p.i. The serum antibody responses were found to be similar for the two cats infected with recFECV (cats 1 and 2), with slightly higher titers being regularly observed for cat 2, which had been infected via the intraperitoneal route. While the serum antibodies reached a peak titer of 1:2,560 in cat 2, a peak titer of 1:320 was measured for cat 1, with no further increase being recorded after week 5 p.i. The data show that both recFECV-S 79 and recFECV cause productive infections in cats. Note that the authentic recombinant serotype I FECV recovered from a full-length cDNA clone induced a symptomless but persistent infection in the cats that was very similar to what was seen in the cat from which this particular virus originated. Furthermore, the experiments revealed that, regardless of the route of infection, the recombinant FECVs caused persistent infections in the gut as judged by continued virus shedding in feces. To verify that the infection of cats with recFECV can reproducibly induce a harmless persistent infection, two additional cats were infected oronasally in a separate experiment. Virus shedding and the antibody response of cats 5 and 6 were monitored for 8.5 weeks as previously described. Similarly to the first experiment, viral RNA was detected at day 2 p.i. Furthermore, all fecal swab samples collected on a daily basis (Fig. 3C) . The antibody titers determined for cats 5 and 6 ( Fig. 3D) were similar to the ones observed earlier for cat 1. Taken together, these data further confirm our conclusion that recFECV reproducibly causes a harmless persistent infection in cats infected via the natural route. Postmortem sample analyses. To conclude the animal experiment, we performed additional studies using postmortem samples obtained from cat 1, which had been infected oronasally with recFECV. To analyze virus spread in vivo and determine sites of viral replication, the cat was euthanized and a range of organs, including lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and abdominal lymph node samples as well as gut sections, were collected and used for subsequent analyses. Using nested RT-PCR, FCoV-specific RNA could be detected only in the colon samples. To clarify whether the negative results were due to the detection limit of the nested RT-PCR, we reinvestigated all organ samples by a qRT-PCR assay. The obtained results were in complete agreement with the outcome of the nested RT-PCR assay. As before, FCoV RNA was exclusively detected in colon samples (4.6 ϫ 10 5 genome copies/g tissue). Consistent with this, an immunohistochemistry (IHC) study revealed that FCoV-specific antigens could be detected only in samples originating from the colon (Fig. 4) . These data are in agreement with the localization of FECV nucleic acid and proteins reported for naturally occurring persistent FECV infections (18, 54, 55) and corroborate our conclusion that the recFECV generated in this study is able to establish persistent infections that are similar to those caused by FECVs from the field. Finally, we determined the full-length FECV genome sequence originating from cat 1 (recFECV -cat1 ). Fecal samples were collected right before the cat was euthanized and used for amplification of a set of overlapping PCR products covering the entire FECV genome. By comparing the FECV sequences derived from viral RNA isolated from fecal samples, 10 nucleotide differences from the recFECV input virus sequence were identified (Table 1) . Notably, six nonsynonymous mutations were found in the S gene, two in the M gene, and one in nsp4. These data showed that the genomic sequence of the input recFECV was barely altered after 8.5 weeks (61 days) and that most of the changes were located in the S gene. Very similar results were also obtained in another study
