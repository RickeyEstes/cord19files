Immunological and molecular screenings of respiratory samples. Five hundred consecutive nasopharyngeal or tracheal aspirates from children admitted to Odense University Hospital due to upper and/ or lower respiratory tract infection during the winter period of 2002 -2003 were procured and analyzed for viral and bacterial pathogens. Molecular and limited epidemiological data from these screenings is reported in the supplementary results section, supplementary figure S1 and supplementary tables S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5. The Identification and prevalence of a novel human parainfluenza virus type 4. An initial screening experiment of 92 pooled clinical samples on the GS FLX Titanium platform resulted in a total of six contigs and 39 singelton reads from one particular sample (459) with a significant local BLASTn-mediated GenBank match of 87-96% identity to HPIV4a. Presently, four complete genomes have been sequenced across both HPIV4 subtypes (one HPIV4a and three HPIV4b) [20] [21] [22] . Given that relatively little is known about these viruses we set out to recover the full genome in this sample (described below). We provisionally refer to this sequence as strain HPIV4_DK(459). The exclusion of routine HPIV4 screenings in the public health setting in Denmark prompted us to also test the prevalence of this virus in 493 respiratory specimens (7 samples of the original 500 could not be located) using reverse transcriptase (RT) real-time PCR. PCR primers were designed from the HPIV4_DK(459) sequences discovered during GS FLX Titanium sequencing. The primers amplify a 61-bp fragment of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene (see Material and Methods and table S6) . PCR amplification was observed in a total of 13 samples (2.6%). Through an epidemiological perspective, the prevalence of HPIV4 described in this study corresponds to similar prevalence estimates to that of hMPV, Adenovirus, and B. pertussis using PCR-based screenings (see Supplementary Table S1 ). Full genome of HPIV4_DK(459). Following the GS FLX screening and analysis, we sequenced sample 459 on the PacBio RS to recover HPIV4_DK(459) through a viral metagenomic framework. A total of 3,356,192 reads was generated from 5 SMRTcellsH of sequencing. Viral read filtration of HPIV4 was achieved by mapping all sequences using Pacific Biosciences BLASR software to five HPIV reference genomes (x1 HPIV1, x1 HPIV2, x1 HPIV3, x1 HPIV4a, x1 HPIV4b). This resulted in 116,109 reads (,3.5%) mapping to the virus. Contigs were generated from filtered reads by de novo assembly, resulting in an assembly of 29 contigs, which were subsequently taxonomically identified through BLASTn (NCBI's non-redundant database). Despite sequence-independent amplification in the viral metagenomic preparation resulting in predominately short fragments as input (100-500 bp), up to 98% of the genome was covered at 700X average coverage from the contigs alone. A comparison of the coverage obtained from viral metagenomic sequencing of HPIV4_DK(459), (GS FLX and PacBio data) can be seen in Figure 1 . We later confirmed the full genome sequence of HPIV4_DK(459) using conventional primer walking RT-PCR and 1 st generation Sanger sequencing from GS FLX data output (GenBank accession number KF483663). The extremities (39 and 59 ends) of the genome were acquired in similar fashion using a consensus alignment and degenerate PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. A list of the primers used for primer walking is shown in Supplementary Table S7 . Using a simple majority-rule consensus approach, all positions with more than 100X PacBio coverage were identical to the Sanger sequenced genome, supporting the usefulness of this technique. HPIV4_DK(459) genome analysis. The recovery and subsequent alignment of the divergent Danish strain confirmed a similar genomic orientation and content as found in the four other sequenced HPIV4 genomes. The genome spans 17,098 nucleotides, 46-nt longer than the only reported complete HPIV4a genome and more than 200-nt shorter than all three complete HPIV4b genomes www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 2468 | DOI: 10.1038/srep02468 described to date. An initial comparison of nucleotide changes across aligned HPIV4 genomes suggests that HPIV4_DK(459) appears more closely related to the 4a subtype than any of the 4b subtype strains (see Table 1 ). This is confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of an alignment of the concatenated coding regions ( Figure 2 ) as well as of alignments of the entire genome (Supplementary Figure S2) , and each gene separately (Supplementary Figures S3-9 ) making it the second HPIV4a genome sequenced to date. The L gene in the Paromyxaviridae encodes the catalytic subunit of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein used to transcribe and replicate the HPIV genome 3 . As this gene is likely to be relatively conserved, we chose it for inference of phylogenetic relationship to other viruses within the Paramyxoviridae using amino-acid sequences (see Figure 3 ). The analyses included members across seven genera including, the Avulavirus, Henipavirus, Morbillivirus, Respirovirus Rubulavirus, Pneumovirus and Metapneumovirus. As expected, tree topology clustered HPIV_DK(459) with all other HPIV4 genomes. Other members of the Rubulavirus genus, HPIV2 and mumps, formed a sister clade to HPIV4. The overall topology is congruent with previously published results 23 . Comparative genomics. Although HPIV4_DK(459) clusters most closely with HPIV4a than HPIV4b in all phylogenies, it shares four distinct features with the HPIV4b isolate SKPIV4 20 , which are absent in all other completely sequenced HPIV4 genomes. Firstly, the isolate does not obey the 'rule of six' (the number of nucleotides in the genome being a multiple of six), a feature common for most but not all paramyxoviruses 24 , which is thought to confer the ability of the RNA polymerase to increase genome replication 25 . Second, a 57-nt sequence-section is present at the 39 leader intergenic region upstream of the NP gene. This 57-nt sequence is identical with the corresponding SKPIV4 sequence in all but 3 nucleotides. An initial prediction of this section's RNA folding structure using mfold 26 demonstrates an impressive stem-loop configuration, which folds into the exact same secondary structure (Supplementary Figure  S10 ) as the SKPIV4 isolate, despite the minor differences at the nucleotide level. However, since single sequence secondary structure alone is generally not statistically significant for determining the presence of a structured RNA 27 , we undertook a more elaborate analysis incorporating multi-sequence comparison and structural RNA alignments. We extended the analysis to include 17 additional Figure S11) shows that taxa can be divided into two groups -those with , 100 nts 3' proximal sequences and those with , 150 nts 3' proximal sequences. The insert appears to be present in some Rubulaviruses whereas it is absent in the other genera. In order to estimate the reliability of the potential RNA structure we performed a comparative RNA structure analysis with a number of Rubulaviruses with 3' intergenic regions of similar lengths to the HPIV4_DK(459) sequence. Figure 4 shows the structural alignment produced using StrAl 28 and PETfold 29 via the WAR web server 30 Thirdly, both genomes share an identical stretch of 13 amino-acid residues within the HN gene (TQLLTYISYNGTI), only one of which is conserved in all published complete HPIV4 genomes. Importantly, visual examination of aligned HN ORF nucleotide sequences (from all currently available HPIV4 sequences in GenBank [n 5 29] ) identified this stretch of amino acids in all but nine strains across both HPIV4 subtypes, which suggests a high prevalence among the HPIV4 strains. The differences observed in this section are due to three insertions-deletions (indels) across the strains that result in a frame shift at the amino acid level in this section. Based on this observation, up to five distinct genotypes can be visually identified from this data, three of which differ at only a single amino acid. This information is visually represented in Figure 5 . An amino acid alignment of the HN gene from completely sequenced HPIV4 strains to two other paramyxoviruses (HPIV3, NDV) whose three-dimensional protein structure has been described using X-ray crystallography 32, 33 , places this stretch of 13 residues in the second Beta sheet, third strand (b 2 S 3 ) of the globular head of the molecule. Meaningful inference of this sort is supported by the fact that the position of the protein structures of NDV and HPIV3 are highly conserved even though they are phylogenetically more distant, than either is to HPIV4. This structure is shown for HPIV3 and NDV to be immediately preceded by the a1 helix, which is seemingly crucial for the enzymatic activity of the protein 32 . Lastly, both HPIV4_DK(459) and SKPIV4 have a longer ORF at the C-terminal end of the HN gene, which codes for an extra five amino acids, the two first of which are identical. However, as above, (from a comparison of available HN sequences) the presence of the longer HN ORF appears more prevalent than its absence across strains. Using the same paramyxovirus alignment above, the C-terminal end of the HN gene can be inferred to reside in the end of the 6th Beta sheet, third strand (b 6 S 3 ) of the globular head of the protein molecule. This beta sheet has been identified as having catalytic/active sites in both the first and second strand 32 . The amino acid residue differences within the HN gene of
