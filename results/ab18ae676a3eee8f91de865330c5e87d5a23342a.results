The distribution of samples positive for rotavirus amongst diarrhoeic and nondiarrhoeic animals, and management system is shown in Tables I and II, respectively. An overall prevalence of rotavirus infection in livestock (29.4%; 138/470) was found in this study. A laigher prevalence was observed ill diarrhoeic (39.9%) than in non-diarrhoeic (13.4%) animals and the difference was statistically significant (P~-0.001; X"). A similar trend was detected in each of the four species studied and the differences in rotavirus detection between diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic faecal samples for each animal species had significance as follows: calves and lambs (/~-0.001; X'-') ; piglets (P~--0.05; X"). The prevalences of rotavirus infection were highest in the extensive (66.7%) husbandry systems; followed by the semi-intensive (32.9%) and intensive (28.1%) systems. However, the differences in prevalences of rotavirus infection in animals under different husbandry systems were not significant (P~-0.05; X'2). The youngest animals positive for rotavirus infection were calves and lambs aged 1 week and piglets aged 2 weeks. The prevalence rate was highest in calves between the ages 1 to 6 weeks, 72.6% (53/73); piglets 2 to 8 weeks, 91.1% (41/45) and lambs 1 to 8 weeks, 88. 9% (16/18 ). The prevalence rates peaked at 3 weeks, 20.5% (15/73) for calves, 8 weeks for piglets 31.1% (14/45) and lambs, 38.9% (7/18).
