Results of the diagnostic tests carried out on the 29 postvaccinal faecal samples from diarrhoeic dogs are reported in Table 2 . CPV field strains (virulent virus) were identified alone in 15 samples-12 were type 2a and 3 were type 2c [17] . b [18] . c [11] . viruses. Thirteen samples were from dogs vaccinated with CPV-2, one sample was from a dog vaccinated with CPV-2b and one sample from a dog vaccinated with an unknown formulation. A CPV-2 vaccine strain and a CPV-2a field strain were detected simultaneously in the other three samples; two were from dogs administered a type-2-based vaccine and one from a dog given an unknown vaccine. Eleven samples, including seven and three samples collected from dogs vaccinated with CPV-2 and CPV-2b, respectively, and one sample from a dog administered an unknown vaccine, were found to contain only the vaccine virus. Other canine pathogens were detected in 8 of 11 samples, including CCoV type I, CCoV type II and Isospora canis. The remaining three samples contained only vaccine strains: CPV-2 (one sample); CPV-2b strain SAH (two samples). There was no evidence of other viral, bacterial or parasitic pathogens. In the two samples positive for CPV-2a (128/05; 206/05), the co-presence of MRV strains was found that gave a signal only in the nested PCR assay. The MRVs could not be characterised by type-specific RT-PCR assays [20] . One sample (206/05) was found positive for CDV by a real-time RT-PCR assay [25] . In order to rule out the vaccine origin of the CDV strain, partial sequences of the haemagglutinin gene were obtained by RT-PCR amplification and subsequent sequence analysis showed that it clustered with field strains of the European lineage [29] . Eleven out of the 16 post-vaccinal faecal samples collected from healthy dogs were found to contain the vaccine virus. Eight samples were from dogs vaccinated with CPV-2 and threes samples were from dogs administered a CPV-2b vaccine (data not shown).
