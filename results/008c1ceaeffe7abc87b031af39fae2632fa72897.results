The performance of the networks is evaluated on the training and test datasets for each of the PTM types. During training of the feed-forward neural network with back-propagation learning algorithm, the learning rate (η) and acceleration factors (δ) are chosen as 0.8 and 0.8 respectively. The classification performance is described by the following measures of accuracy: where, TP is the number of true positives, FP is the number of false positives, TN is the number of true negatives, and FN is the number of false negatives. The classification error (E) is used to provide an overall error measure, recall (R) corresponds to the percentage of correct predictions, precision (P) measures the percentage of observed positives that are correctly predicted, true positive rate (TPR) is similar to recall or sensitivity measure and false positive rate (FPR) estimates the false alarm rate or fall-out. We also estimate the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) by plotting the fraction of true positives (TPR) vs. the fraction of false positives (FPR). More specifically, the ROC curves are drawn for both training and test datasets in each of the three runs of experiment, i.e., optimal AUC, recall and precision values. This ROC analysis provides a tool to select possibly optimal network models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from the class distribution. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is also calculated in the current experiment and presented in Table 1 . The AUC is equivalent to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one [31] . The detailed performance analysis of the current software using three random sub-sample validations on training and test datasets of different PTM types is given in the Additional file 1. The three sets of results (corresponding to the AUC, Recall and Precision optimizations) for each PTM type corresponds to the training of the network based on the optimized AUC area, recall and precision values for the random test dataset under consideration. Each such network is trained with possible variations of hidden neurons from 2 to 20 (with step size 2). The number of hidden neurons, for which a given net-
