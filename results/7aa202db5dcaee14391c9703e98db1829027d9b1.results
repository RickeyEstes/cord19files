In order to de®ne the thermodynamics of unfolding for the mIAP frameshifting pseudoknot, the compensatory base-pair substitution and deletion mutants shown in Figure 1 (b) were prepared and subjected to thermal denaturation. Unless otherwise indicated, all thermal melts were collected in 50 mM monovalent K and no added divalent cation, so that the complete melting pro-®le could be obtained in the accessible temperature range (5-120 C). Optical melting profiles of the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot and stem 1 hairpins The optical melting pro®les acquired at 260 nm and 280 nm (plotted as dA/dT versus T) (Banerjee et al., 1993) for the wild-type 41-nucleotide mIAP pseudoknot and two stem 1 hairpins in the absence of exogenous Mg 2 are shown in Figure 2 (b) with the thermodynamic parameters compiled in Table 1 . Unless otherwise noted, the experimental data are presented in the left-hand side of each panel and are superimposed with a continuous curve which describes an optimized non-linear least-squares ®t to an unfolding model consisting of a set of sequential, interacting, two-state transitions. The individual transition ®ts are shown on the right-hand side of the Figure for clarity. Initially, melts were collected on a wild-type mIAP pseudoknot and mIAP-HP with a short singlestranded 5 H tail. The 5 H single-stranded tail was omitted from the mIAP wild-type pseudoknot RNA and subsequent mutant RNAs when it was observed that it did not signi®cantly affect the stability of the pseudoknot as determined from optical melting pro®les (data not shown). The wild-type mIAP pseudoknot optical melting pro®le is shown in Figure 2 (b). The pro®le exhibits hyperchromicity in two transitions, a broad low intensity transition between 30 and 50 C and a sharper, higher intensity transition above 80 C, both with signi®cant hyperchromicity at 280 nm as expected for the high G-C content of the two helical stems (Fresco et al., 1963) . Even though initial inspection gives the appearance of only two tran-sitions, it was necessary to ®t the data to four sequential two-state transitions in order to eliminate the periodic deviation in the residuals observed when ®tting to fewer transitions. Turner rules compiled at 1 M NaCl predict an enthalpy of 68 and 77 kcal mol À1 for the melting of stems 1 and 2, respectively, provided seven base-pairs are formed in stem 2 and the 3 H single-stranded nucleotide stacks against the stem (Turner et al., 1988; He et al., 1991; Xia et al., 1998) . The predicted stabilization due to stacked Watson-Crick base-pairs was calculated using the modi®ed individual nearest-neighbor model (INN-HB) parameters which account for the difference in stabilization between internal and closing A-U base-pairs (Xia et al., 1998) . The thermodynamic parameters for hairpin and bulge loops reported by Turner et al. (1988) were used. In good agreement with these predictions, the ®rst two transitions have a combined ÁH 75 kcal mol À1 and the ®nal transition has an ÁH 66.7 kcal mol À1 , suggesting that stem 2 unfolds ®rst in two steps with stem 1 unfolding at much higher temperature. Two stem 1 hairpin RNAs were constructed to unambiguously de®ne the optical signature of stem 1 unfolding: these are mIAP-HP RNA, which consists of the ®rst 23 nucleotides of the mIAP pseudoknot sequence, and AA-HP RNA, a variant of the mIAP-HP RNA in which the hairpin loop nucleotides 9 and 10 were converted from guanosine to adenosine as shown in Figure 2 (a). Unexpectedly, the optical melting pro®le of the mIAP-HP shows three distinct transitions. The ®rst transition is unusual in that it has signi®cant hyperchromicity (dA/dT) only at 260 nm with a very high enthalpy (ÁH 76 kcal mol À1 ) at t m 47 C. The second transition has an ÁH 42 kcal mol À1 and an (dA 260 /dT)/(dA 280 /dT) value (A 260 / A 280 ratio) of %0.26, while the third transition is characterized by ÁH 57 kcal mol À1 and A 260 / A 280 % 0.36. The melting pro®le was superimposable in both the folding and unfolding directions (data not shown). The combined enthalpy of these transitions is 175 kcal mol À1 , much larger than would be predicted from the nearest-neighbor model for the stem 1 hairpin (64 kcal mol À1 ). The molecular origin of the ®rst unfolding transition is unknown; however, it is observed calorimetrically as well with essentially identical van't Hoff thermodynamic parameters (data not shown). The second transition shows a concentration dependence over the 2-55 mM range consistent with predictions for formation of some kind of intermolecular structure. The high enthalpy and t m and low A 260 /A 280 ratio of the third optical transition are consistent with predictions for the unfolding of a stem consisting of six G-C basepairs. In an attempt to simplify the hairpin melting pro®le, a second stem 1 hairpin (AA-HP) was constructed with the 5 H single-stranded tail eliminated and two G 3 A substitutions in the hairpin loop to potentially disrupt any loop structure. As shown in Figure 2 (b), the melting pro®le is simpli-®ed with the complete disappearance of the ®rst mIAP-HP transition and a signi®cant reduction in the intensity of the second unfolding transition. The optical signature of the ®nal transition was identical in the two hairpin RNAs and in the wildtype mIAP pseudoknot and was therefore assigned to the unfolding of stem 1. We interpret the penultimate transition as some type of unstacking in the loop, the intensity of which is strongly affected by the identity of the loop purines. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot and compared to that obtained for a nucleotide deletion mutant, termed ÁA35 RNA, in which a stem 2 unpaired adenosine is deleted and all seven possible stem 2 base-pairs are predicted to form (Figure 1(b) ). Comparisons of the optical and calorimetric melting pro®les for these two RNAs are shown in Figure 3 with the ®tted thermodynamic parameters from the optical and calorimetric data presented in Table 2 . The calorimetric and optical melting pro®les were ®t independently and returned internally consistent thermodynamic parameters for the individual unfolding transitions, with the caveat that the enthalpies and t m values of the ®nal transitions are more accurately determined from calorimetry, since the optical data could only be collected to 95 C. The optical and calorimetric melting pro®les of the ÁA35 RNA (shown in Figure 3 (b)) were ®t to three sequential transitions. The second and third transitions were observed to be consistent with the hairpin loop unstacking and stem 1 unfolding transitions previously assigned in the wild-type pseudoknot. The ®rst unfolding transition at 63 C is assigned to unfolding of stem 2. Comparing the wild-type mIAP and ÁA35 RNAs, the transitions observed at lower t m differ signi®cantly in hyperchromic intensity. However, the ®rst ÁA35 RNA transition and the combined ®rst and second mIAP RNA transitions return the same total calorimetric enthalpy as determined by the area under the curve. The calorimetric enthalpy observed for these two molecules con®rms that stem 2 unfolding in the wild-type mIAP pseudoknot occurs in two tightly coupled transitions with base stacking interactions similar to that observed in the ÁA35 RNA. More importantly, the van't Hoff. Enthalpics determined for each transition from calorimetry and from optical melts are in excellent agreement with one another and, whem summed, agree well with the osberved total calorimetric enthalpy. This suggests that ÁC p for the overall unfolding process is small. As discussed below, the impact of this A35 deletion on the global stability of the molecule is essentially as predicted for an extrahelical, unpaired nucleotide.
