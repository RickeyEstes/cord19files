During routine diagnostic work on patients with acute enteritis in a municipal health service, a stool sample from a 30 year-old female kitchen worker with acute enteritis displayed a cytopathic effect (CPE) on cultured African Green Monkey Kidney (GMK) cells. The CPE resembled that of enteroviruses, including rounding and blebbing, shrinking, and detachment of cells from the monolayer. The virus isolate could be passaged to uninfected cells but showed no detectable neutralisation if subcultured with several different pools of polyclonal anti-enterovirus sera. RT-PCR for Norovirus and Enterovirus, PCR for Adenovirus, and antigen-EIA for Astro-and Rotavirus were negative on the supernatant and on the original patient material. The unknown isolate was termed BNI-788st. In order to type it, supernatant was subjected to VIDISCA, with an additional ultracentrifugation step as opposed to the original protocol [8] . In the second amplification stage, one of 16 PCR reactions yielded a distinct amplification product (Figure 1 ). Sequencing showed a 188 nucleotide DNA fragment that was homologous in a nucleotide BLAST search with the capsid (P1) protein region of HPeV strains. It should be noted here that no specific Parechovirus diagnostics (serotyping of cell culture, RT-PCR) had been done because these viruses are known to occur almost exclusively in children, and this patient was an adult. The VP1 protein gene of BNI-788st was determined as described in [16] . Phylogenetic analysis showed that it clustered with that of a group of contemporary HPeV1 strains ( Figure 2 ). As observed earlier [14] , the prototype Echovirus 22 strain Harris had only basal relationship with these strains. Amino acid identity with prototype strain Harris was around 92%. Because no full sequence of Original agarose gel photograph obtained from second ampli-fication step of VIDISCA Figure 1 Original agarose gel photograph obtained from second amplification step of VIDISCA. Numbering of the 16 second-stage PCR products is shown above the first and last three lanes. The product in lane 4 was sequenced and showed a parechovirus as described in the text. A 100 bp marker is used on the gel (500 bp band enhanced, 400, 300, 200, 100 bp). any contemporary HPeV1 was available in GenBank, the complete genome sequence of BNI-788st was analysed. Genome length was 7337 nucleotides excluding the poly(A) tract. Genome organization matched that of other parechoviruses, including a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 709 nucleotides, followed by a large open reading frame of 6537 nucleotides that encoded the putative polyprotein precursor of 2179 amino acids; and a 3' UTR of 91 nucleotides followed by a poly(A) tail. Interestingly, the 5' UTR was most similar to that of HPeV4 viruses, showing 88.9% and 90.8% nucleotide identity with type 4 prototype strains T75-4077 and K251176-02, respectively. The predicted RNA secondary structure elements of the 5' UTR of BNI-788St are depicted in Figure 3 . The shown structures were selected from alternative energetically possible structures to resemble most closely the structures of HPeV1 Harris and HPeV2 Williamson [18, 19] . Differences were observed in stem-loop elements B, C, G and H. In BNI-788st, corresponding sequences formed only 2 stem-loops, designated B-C and G-H. The other stem-loop elements were well conserved, including I to L which form a type II internal ribosome entry site (IRES) as described for cardioviruses and aph-thoviruses [20] [21] [22] . A polypyrimidine-rich tract typical of picornaviruses was present 17 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon, including a Kozak sequence (ANNAUGG). The predicted secondary structure of the 3' UTR of BNI-788st is also shown in Figure 3 . The conformation in terms of relative sizes of loop structures was more similar to HPeV 3 protype strains than to the HPeV 1 prototype strain ( [11] ). The region was organised in one continuous stem-loop element as recently described for HPeV 1-3 [11] . This was in contrast to other enteroviruses whose 3'noncoding regions form 2 to 3 such stem loops [23] . A conserved repeat structure as recently described for prototype HPeV [14] was also present. The genes coding for structural proteins VP0, VP3 and VP1 were most similar to HPeV1, as listed in Table 1 . An RGD motif as present in all HPeV except HPeV 3 was present [10, 12] . This element is critical in attachment and entry into host cells in other picornaviruses [24] and has been shown to be essential for infectivity in HPeV [25, 26] . All of the genes coding for the non-structural proteins were more similar to HPeV3 than to HPeV 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6. Con-Phylogenetic analysis of P1 protein regions (amino acids 76-773, isolate Harris), analysed using the p-distance substitution model Figure 2 Phylogenetic analysis of P1 protein regions (amino acids 76-773, isolate Harris), analysed using the p-distance substitution model. VP1-based HPeV-types are shown next to clades on the right margin. Analysis was conducted in MEGA4 [42] . The evolutionary histories were inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method [44] . Relevant boostrap values from 500 replicate trees are shown next to the branches [45] . The scale shows evolutionary distance from each root. GenBank accession number of strain BNI-788st is EF051629. The tree was rooted against Ljungan virus, a murine parechovirus. served elements such as the 2C helicase motifs GXXGXGK(S/T) and DDLXQ, the 3C protease active-site motif GXCG, and the 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase motifs YGDD, KDELR, PSG, and FLKR were all confirmed. As suggested from above results, as well as from similarity values listed in Table 1 , the protein-coding genes of BNI-788st might result from recombination between HPeV1 and another HPeV type, potentially type 3. To investigate this further, similarity plot analysis on the full polyprotein open reading frame was conducted as shown in Figure 4 . Structural proteins had closest identity with HPeV1 (see below). The non-structural protein portion was 87-92.8% identical to HPeV3 (Table 1) , which is less than the degree of identity between HPeV3 prototype strains (96-99%) but more than between prototype strains of non-homologous types (always below 87%, Table 1 and data not shown). Bootscan analysis was done next. Within the structural gene portion, analysis yielded co-segregation values between BNI-788st and the prototype HPeV1 strain Harris in the order of 95% in VP0 and 90% in VP1. For VP3, a maximum co-segregation value of 70% could be identified only in a very small part of the protein. An abrupt halt of co-segregation with the HPeV1 prototype was observed beyond the VP1 protein portion by bootscan analysis.

Capital letters as used in [19] denominate structural elements of the 5'-noncoding region. Latin numbers for the 3'-nonconding region are used in analogy with [11] . the VP1/2A border a crossing point with HPeV4 was identified by the software, but the region in which co-segregation occurred was rather short (Figure 4 ). Over the rest of the non-structural protein gene, no relevant evidence of recombination with any other HPeV type was observed. Thus, only the degree of nucleotide identity (see above) suggests that the closest relative in the non-structural protein gene portion may be an HPeV3 strain. For comparison, bootscan analysis was repeated using each of the reference strains for HPeV types 1-6 as the comparison sequence ( Figure 5 ). Most of them showed significant co-segregation with other reference strains alternating over parts of their non-structural genes. Such an observation would be compatible with mosaic recombination in the non-structural genes. No reference strain showed recombination with BNI-788st. Similarly, no indication of past recombination with relatives of other prototypes was seen in the HPeV3 reference strains (see Figure 5 , panels D and E). To appreciate in more detail the composition of structural protein genes of BNI-788st, these were compared phylogenetically with that of other contemporary viruses co-circulating in Germany as identified in a recent study [16] . As shown in Figure 6 , there was a group of related viruses (BNI-788st, R9, R15, R32) whose VP3 portions were directly originating from the root point of contemporary type 1 viruses, suggesting that they stemmed directly from a common ancestor of all contemporary type 1 viruses. Other circulating strains from Germany (BNI-R21, R30, R90) and Japan [10] formed separate evolutionary lineages. For VP1 the same group of viruses related to BNI-788st existed, but one strain (BNI-R30) was placed between this group and the common ancestor of contem-porary strains. BNI-R30 may thus have obtained its VP1 protein earlier than the 788st-related viruses from a common source. Nevertheless, for the 788st-related group (BNI-788st, R9, R15, R32) the length of the internal branch leading to its basal node suggests that their VP1 has been obtained from a non-recent ancestor common to these and most other contemporary HPeV1. In VP0 the BNI-788st-related group was not so close to the root of contemporary strains, suggesting that VP0 may have been acquired by a more recent ancestor of the group by recombination.
