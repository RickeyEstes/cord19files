To determine whether substituted sialic acids exists on the circulating coelomocytes, 2 M acetic acid treatment was used to release sialic acids from glycoconjugates without destroying the substitutions that may be present on the sialic acid molecule. Released sialic acids were then derivatized with 1,2-diamino-4,5methylenedioxybenzene dihydrochloride (DMB) and separated by CapLC-ESI-MS/MS and retention times-CID fragments were compared with standards: an acid hydrolysate of bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) which is a rich source of sialic acids and Oacetylated sialic acids [4] and other standard sialic acids (Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc and KDN). Sialic acids derivatized with DMB ( Fig. 1) analysis also provides useful information regarding the identity and location substituents of sialic acids, even without knowing the relative retention times of standard sialic acid derivatives [4] . But, this approach is limited in ion trap systems due to an inherently low mass cutoff (LMCO) derived from CID. The ion trap fails to trap the ions at lower end of the m/z range when using CID for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) [41] . Therefore, [M þ H-18] þ ions obtained from MRM of sialic acids are very useful for screening the chromatogram and the spectrum in MS/MS system [15] . Twelve different sialic acids were detected in BSM by DMB derivatization-CapLC-ESI-MS/MS (data not shown). The peaks for Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc, Neu5,9Ac 2 along with additional sialic acid peaks were assigned by comparison of the elution times and CID fragments ([M þ H-18] þ ions and others (m/z)) as reported by Refs. [4, 15] using bovine submaxillary mucin and other sialic acidcontaining glycoconjugates. We found the presence of ten different types of sialic acids (Neu5Gc, Neu5Ac, Neu5Gc7Ac, Neu5Gc8Ac, Neu5,7Ac 2 , Neu5-Gc9Ac, Neu5,8Ac 2 , Neu5,9Ac 2 , Neu5Gc7,9Ac 2 , Neu5,7,9Ac 3 ) isolated in limited amounts of total coelomocyte population (Fig. 2) by comparison with the data obtained for the analysis of sialic acids of BSM (data not shown) and standard sialic acids (KDN, Neu5Gc and Neu5Ac) (Fig. 3) . The peaks were identified by extracted ion chromatogram. The highly abundant fragment ions were used for quantification and others used for confirmation of sialic acid derivatives. All DMB derivatives of sialic acids in our samples show clear molecular ions at [M þ H] þ and [M þ H-18] þ . The fragment pattern of the MS/MS spectrum of sialic acids in total coelomocyte population (see Table 1 ) was consistent with that of DMB derivatives of sialic acids in mucin and the previous reports [4, 20] . The most abundant sialic acids were determined as Neu5Gc in coelomocytes. Mass spectral data revealed that the peaks of Neu5Ac and O-acetylated sialic acids were lower mass than Neu5Gc. Di-O-acetyl derivatives of Neu5Gc (Neu5Gc7,9Ac 2 ) and Neu5Ac (Neu5,7,9Ac 3 ) were observed respectively at m/z ¼ 526 -18] þ in the mass chromatogram on total coelomocyte population. 7, 8, 9-O-acetylated of Neu5Ac was obtained at Also, Neu5Gc type of sialic acids and its acetylated compounds (Neu5Gc7Ac, Neu5Gc8Ac and Neu5Gc9Ac) were identified at m/z ¼ 484 The distributions of sialic acids in total coelomocyte population were shown Fig. 4 . KDN is a structurally related a-keto acid that is also found in glycoconjugates [13] . However, under the conditions used in this study, KDN was not found both coelomocytes and BSM. Hence, Neu5Gc was established as the predominant sialic acid on circulating coelomocytes of P. lividus.
