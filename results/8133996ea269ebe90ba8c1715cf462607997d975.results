Analyzing real CPI networks in two representative Chinese colleges. Using the PEARL application, we collected real CPI data from two representative Chinese colleges, namely, SCAU, and USTB. Figure 1 shows two examples of the SCAU CPI networks acquired on October 31, 2011 (weekday, denoted as SCAU1031) and November 5, 2011 (weekend, denoted as SCAU1105), where nodes represent students and edges represent CPIs, with line width proportional to the aggregate interaction duration during one day. Supplementary Fig. S2 shows two examples of USTB CPI networks in the same manner. In fact, the real CPIs can be divided into two categories according to interaction duration, namely, transient CPIs formed by purely random interactions, and regular CPIs representing meaningful interactions among students 4 . We therefore employed a mixture statistical model to describe the CPI durations (Supplementary Methods S1), and determined the optimal duration threshold to distinguish these two categories as 30 minutes ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). To remove the biases in network statistics introduced by purely random CPIs, the CPIs with an aggregate duration of less than 30 minutes were filtered out before calculating network statistics. To understand the detailed characteristics of real CPI networks, a collection of idealized CPI networks was constructed for comparison, including small-world (SW) networks generated using the Newman-Watts model, scale-free (SF) networks generated using the Barabási-Albért model, and uniformly-random (UR) networks generated using the Erdös-Rényi model 20 . For unbiased comparison, all the idealized CPI networks were generated with identical numbers of individuals and CPIs to counterpart real CPI networks (Supplementary Methods). To understand the distinct characteristics of CPI networks in Chinese colleges, we compared them with the real CPI networks acquired using Bluetooth and similar wireless techniques from a US undergraduate dormitory (denoted as USD) 11 , a US high school (denoted as USHS) 4 , and a French primary school (denoted as FRPS) 12 . For both real and idealized CPI networks, a variety of descriptive statistics were calculated, including degree distribution, CC, efficiency, modularity, and periodicity (see Supplementary Methods for detailed definitions). It is worth pointed out that the generated idealized networks are un-weighted, and the network statistic calculations are applicable only to un-weighted networks, too. For fair comparison, un-weighted version of real CPI networks should be employed. A straightforward strategy to achieve this objective is to simply ignore the duration of real CPIs, no matter how strong or weak they are. However, this strategy might lead to deviation in calculation of network statistics, as CPIs greatly vary in durations (Figs 1 and S2 ). In fact, the CPI durations can be perfectly fitted by the mixture of a Poisson distribution and a truncated Gaussian distribution (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. S3 ). These two distributions were used to describe transient CPIs formed by purely random interactions, and regular CPIs representing meaningful interactions among students, respectively. Based on the intersection point of these two distributions, a threshold to separate transient and regular CPIs can be reasonably determined as 30 minutes, i.e., CPIs with duration no more than 30 minutes were treated as transient. Here, only regular CPIs were considered in calculations of network statistics, and idealized networks were generated with same size to the real CPI networks with transient CPIs removed. The analysis of network statistics are described as below. • Degree distribution: In a CPI network, the degree of an individual refers to the number of partners that have interactions with this individual. It is well known that a uniformly random network approximates a Poisson degree distribution, and that a scale-free network is featured by its power-law degree distribution; thus, degree distribution is commonly used as a criterion to judge whether a network is scale-free or uniformly random 20 . As shown in Fig. 2 , the SCAU1031 network has a degree distribution that is significantly different from both the Poisson distribution and power-law distribution. Thus, the CPI networks acquired on weekdays are neither uniformly random nor scale-free. However, SCAU1105, a CPI network acquired on a weekend, exhibits a typical power-law degree distribution. This observation is consistent with the viewpoint that on weekends, CPI networks are mainly determined by friendship among students 10 , and friendship networks usually exhibit a power-law degree distribution 21 . Similar observations were made from other real CPI networks in SCAU (shown in Supplementary Fig. S4 ). • CC and efficiency: These two features are commonly used to quantify the small-world behavior of networks. Specifically, CC describes the extent to which nodes in a network tend to cluster, and efficiency measures the speed at which bacteria or viruses spread across a human contact network. In general, a small-world network has a high CC but low efficiency; thus, CC and efficiency are commonly used as criteria to judge whether a network is small-world or not 20 . As shown in Fig. 3A , our SCAU networks on weekdays from October 31 to November 4, 2011 have a CC of ~0.70 while the CC of the counterpart small-world networks has a maximum of 0.55. Furthermore, the CC of SCAU networks on the weekends (November 5 and 6, 2011) are at least 0.60, which are substantially higher than that of the counterpart small-world networks (less than 0.1). However, the efficiency of SCAU networks were found to be lower than that of the corresponding small-world networks, especially those on weekends. Together, these statistics demonstrated that SCAU networks are not small-world networks. Our SCAU networks also exhibited higher CC than that in the US and French schools. The SCAU CPI networks displayed a lower efficiency than that studied in the US schools, but higher than that observed in the French school. Interestingly, the USTB networks exhibited a similar pattern to that of SCAU networks except for the larger deviations of CC as well as efficiency. • Modularity: As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5 , the network SCAU1031 consists of a set of tightly interacting modules. This observation was confirmed by quantitative analysis of modularity, which measures the degree that a network can be separated into disconnected communities. There, the SCAU networks possess an average modularity of ~0.82, which is considerably higher than that of the counterpart small-world (0.62), scale-free (0.23), and uniformly-random networks (0.25). Supplementary Fig. S5 also reveals the complicated dynamics of communities, including community merging and diversification. Therefore, it is not sufficient to understand CPI patterns merely based on the CPI network acquired on a single day. If there is a CPI between two students, an edge is drawn between the two corresponding nodes with line width proportional to the aggregate CPI duration in the entire day. The two CPI networks are shown as examples since the CPI networks on weekdays exhibit nearly identical characteristics, and so do those on weekends ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).

As shown in Table 1 , the SCAU CPI networks exhibit an average modularity (0.78) that is significantly higher than USD (0.49) and USHS (0.43) networks. • Periodicity: A strong periodicity of CPI networks was expected according to the weekly school schedule of college students. However, similarity analysis of the daily CPI networks from October 31 to November 27, 2011 shows that this periodicity is weak ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ), highlighting the necessity of investigating long-term real CPI data. In summary, our analysis provided us with two main insights into the statistics of real CPI networks. First, the CPI networks in the two representative Chinese colleges are different from the CPI networks acquired from the US as well as French schools. One explanation is that Chinese college students commonly have highly organized lifestyle, such as living in neighboring dormitories on the same campus, having meals in large-capacity canteens altogether, and being organized into classes for taking identical courses. This highly organized lifestyle is reflected in the formation of a set of small but tightly-interacting communities. Second, the SCAU CPI networks acquired on weekdays are neither scale-free, small-world, nor uniformly random. This challenges the basic assumption of idealized CPI networks adopted in traditional approaches to epidemic research [5] [6] [7] [8] . Such assumption might result in a large deviation in disease dynamics, which has been confirmed by the difference in epidemic dynamics across real CPI networks with that across idealized CPI networks (shown below). Simulating influenza spread across real CPI networks. Using a SEIR model, we simulated the spread of influenza across the acquired CPI networks, and compared with real influenza records 4,6 . Unlike the calculation of network statistics, all CPIs, including both transient and regular ones, were considered in epidemic simulation. In fact, simply ignoring transient CPIs would lead to deviations in epidemic behavior (Supplementary Fig. S7 ). Among the widely-used ranges of SEIR parameters 4,15-19 , the parameter setting that best fit the real SCAU infection data was determined as β 0 = 2.5 × 10 −4 sec −1 , δ = . As shown in Fig. 4 , the disease prevalence prediction using SCAU CPI networks is in good accordance with real influenza records of the Figure 2 . Degree distribution of SCAU1031 network (panels A,B) and SCAU1105 network (panels C,D). Panels A and C are shown in linear scale, while panels B and D are shown in log-log scale. As shown in panel A, the degree distribution of the SCAU1031 network can be well fitted by applying a mixture of two Gaussian distributions (blue line), which significantly deviates from the idealized Poisson distribution of the counterpart uniformly-random network with the same number of nodes and edges (red line). As shown in panel B, the SCAU1031 network exhibits a degree distribution significantly different from the power-law distribution. Thus, the CPI data acquired on weekdays are neither uniformly random nor scale-free. In contrast, SCAU1105, a CPI network acquired on a weekend, exhibits a typical power-law degree distribution (panels C,D). SCAU undergraduate volunteers. Using the same setting of SEIR model parameters, we repeated the disease spread simulation across the USHS CPI networks 4 . Similarly, we observed that the disease prevalence prediction using USHS CPI networks is in good accordance with the real influenza records in USHS. These results justified both parameter setting and epidemic simulation for studying epidemic dynamics of respiratory infectious diseases. To investigate whether idealized CPI networks can also be used to study disease transmission, we compared real CPI network from different regions as well as idealized CPI networks in term of epidemic behavior. Surprisingly, idealized CPI networks substantially differ from the real SCAU CPI networks in simulating spreading of influenza as well as infectious diseases that transmit relatively slowly (Fig. 5) . Specifically, in the simulation of influenza spreading using idealized small-world networks, almost all individuals were found to be infected, and the basic reproductive number R 0 was estimated to be as high as 9.5. In contrast, the percentage of individuals infected is only 55%, and R 0 is only 3.8 when real SCAU CPI networks were used for simulation (Fig. 5A,B) . Furthermore, the epidemic dynamics of infectious diseases that transmit relatively slowly was simulated by setting relatively small parameter β 0 ≤ 1.0 × 10 −4 sec −1 . As shown in Fig. 5A , all individuals are infected in the simulations using idealized CPI networks; however, the percentage of infected individuals is less than 35% in the simulations using real SCAU CPI networks. In addition, the disease spreading across real SCAU CPI networks shows early peak epidemic time but short epidemic duration (Fig. 5C,D) . These results reveal the potential risk of overestimating disease prevalence when simply using scale-free, small-world, or uniformly random networks in epidemic simulations. Furthermore, in order to understand the effects of CPI patterns on influenza spreading behavior, we repeated the epidemic simulation using the CPI networks acquired from the US and French schools 4, 11, 12 , and compared the simulation results with that in Chinese colleges. Figure 5 clearly shows the differences of these schools in disease spreading behavior. First, in both the simulations of influenza and the simulations of the diseases that transmit relatively slowly, the percentages of total individuals infected in SCAU and FRPS are less than half of those of the US schools. Second, the simulations across SCAU and FRPS networks show a R 0 of less than 3, which
