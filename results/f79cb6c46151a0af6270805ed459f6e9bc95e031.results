A total of 102 medical staff members participated in this study, among which 26 were doctors, 62 were nurses, and 14 were interns. 20.59% of these staff members satisfied the symptomatic criteria for PTSD. Among the participants, 20 were from the respiratory department, 61 were from the ICU, and 21 were from the emergency department. In terms of training and experience, 63 had related experience in treating H7N9 patients, while 40 had received related training ( Table 1 ). The mean total PCL-C score of the sample was 30.00 Â± 9.95, and the scores ranged from 17 to 74. Among the three dimensions of the PCL-C, intrusive syndrome received the highest score followed by hyper-arousal syndrome ( Table 2) . Demographics (occupation, gender, age, professional title, and years of work experience), frequency of contact with H7N9 patients, related training, and related experience all influenced the PCL-C scores. Statistically significant differences were observed between the scores of doctors and nurses (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), but not between those of interns and doctors or nurses. The male and female participants also showed statistically significant differences in their PCL-C scores. The participants aged between 20 years and 30 years received the highest PCL-C scores, and statistically significant differences were observed between the avoidance syndrome and total PCL-C scores of participants aged 31 yearse40 years and those aged >40 years. Those participants with low professional titles and high contact frequency obtained higher PCL-C scores than the others. Those participants who received related training received lower intrusive syndrome, avoidance syndrome, and total PCL-C scores and higher hyper-arousal syndrome scores than those who did not receive such training. Those staff members with less than five years of work experience received higher scores in all dimensions than those who were working for more than five years (Table 3) .
