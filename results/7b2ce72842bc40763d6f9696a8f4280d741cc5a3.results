During August 2007 and December 2012, we tested swab samples from 4,308 domestic waterfowl from four live bird markets. Most (86%) were adult waterfowl and 96% appeared healthy (Table 1) . Most (93%) had been raised in backyards, and the remainder were from free ranging small-scale commercial flocks ( Table 1 ). The average backyard flock had 18 birds (95% CI: [18] [19] [20] , and the average small scale and commercial free ranging flock had 325 birds (95% CI: 293-358). Two hundred fifty (6%) of the sampled birds raised in backyards and 63 (19%) of the sampled birds raised as free ranging waterfowl flocks had at least one death from illness in their flock in the week preceding sampling. The poultry mortality ratio between the backyard and free ranging waterfowl were not significantly different (average mortality in backyard poultry was 1.2% vs. 0.9% among small-scale free ranging poultry, p = 0.07) ( Table 1) . Out of 4,308 waterfowl samples, 191 (4.4%) were positive for influenza A viruses in the live bird markets, including 74 (1.7%) that were influenza A/H5 positive. Influenza A virus prevalence varied from 3% [95% CI: 1.9-5.3%] to 5% [95% CI: 3.7-6.2%] depending on the market and ranged from 0.5% to 3% for influenza A/H5 viruses with the highest percentage observed at Chittagong (Fig. 1) . Besides influenza A/H5 viruses, we also identified H1 (n = 6, 0.1%), H3 (n = 9, 0.2%), H4 (n = 8, 0.2%), H6 (n = 2, 0.001%), H9 (n = 9, 0.2%), and H11 (n = 10, 0.2%) among the influenza A positive waterfowl samples (Fig. 2 , Appendix - Table 1 ). Hemagglutinin type for the remaining influenza A positive samples (38%) were not determined due to inability to propagate virus, amplify genomic material by PCR, and/or co-detection of Newcastle Disease virus RNA. Compared to the samples collected from backyard raised waterfowl, the small-scale operation raised waterfowl had more influenza A virus detections in their samples (3.6% vs. 5.4%, P < 0.01). However, the backyard raised waterfowl samples yielded more diverse hemagglutinin and neuraminidase subtypes (i.e. H1N1, H3N2, H3N6, H3N8, H4N1, H4N2, H4N6, H5N1, H5N2, H5Nx, H6N1, H9Nx, H11N2 and H11N3) compared to the viruses identified in the small scale raised waterfowl (i.e. H1N1, H1N3, H4N6 and H11N6). We did not identify evidence of co-infection by multiple influenza A subtypes through individual waterfowl sampling. From 2007 to 2010, the majority of the influenza A virus detections in the live bird market occurred during the colder months (4.8% during October-March vs. 2.0% during April-September, p < 0.01). We also identified H5N1 in the live bird markets more often during the colder months (78% of the total H5 test positive samples were collected during October-March) of the year, though the difference was not statistically significant (0.2% Table 1 ). The domesticated waterfowl sampled during October-March were more likely to test positive for influenza A viruses compared to the waterfowl sampled during April-September (odds ratio (OR) 1.5; 95% CI 1.1-2.0) ( Table 2) . Domesticated ducks were more likely to be infected with influenza A virus compared to geese (OR: 5.2, 95% CI: 2.1-12.7), and when infected, they were more likely to appear healthy at the time of sampling (OR: 3.4, 95% CI: 1.1-10.6) ( Table 2 ). Birds raised in larger flocks with >20 birds and the birds raised in backyard flocks (vs. raised in small-scale operations) were less likely to be infected with influenza A/H5 viruses ( Table 2) . We collected 590 pooled environmental samples from May 2009 through December 2012. One hundred and seventy three (29.3%) were positive for influenza A viruses and 74 (12.5%) were positive for influenza A/H5 virus by rRT-PCR (Fig. 3 , Appendix Table 2 ). Besides H5 subtypes, H3 (n = 1, 0.2%), H7 (n = 2, 0.3%), H9 (n = 59, 10.0%), and H11 (n = 1, 0.2%) RNA were identified (Fig. 3) . Among the pooled, influenza A positive environmental samples, 11 (1.9%) had RNA from multiple subtypes (Fig. 3 , Appendix- Table 3 ). A low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A/H7N9 virus was identified in one environmental sample. BLAST analysis 19 confirmed the virus to be of Eurasian lineage descent closely related to other LPAI H7 viruses circulating in the region but phylogenetically distant to the Chinese lineage H7N9 viruses 20 . Pooled environmental swabs collected from both urban and rural markets tested positive for influenza A viruses by rRT-PCR. In the four rural live-bird markets, 17.6% (95% CI: 11.8-24.7%) of the 148 environmental specimens were rRT-PCR -positive for influenza A viruses, and 4% (95% CI: 3.4-14.8%) were positive for H5 virus. In the 16 urban markets in Dhaka, 33.3% (95% CI: 28.9-37.9%) of the 442 environmental specimens were rRT-PCR positive for influenza A viruses and 69 (15.6%) were positive H5N1 virus RNA. The environmental samples collected from the urban live bird markets were twice as likely to contain influenza A viruses (33.3% in urban vs. 17.6% in rural, p < 0.001) and five times more likely to contain influenza A/H5 viruses (15.6% in urban vs. 3.4% in rural, p < 0.001) than samples collected from rural live bird markets. Until the end of 2010, the majority (n = 20, 80%) of the H5 positive environmental samples in urban Dhaka markets were identified between October and March. Following the identification of clade 2.3.2.1a in March 2011, this seasonal trend was no longer apparent in 2011 and 2012 (15% in October-March vs. 10% in April-September, p = 0.09) (Fig. 3 ).
