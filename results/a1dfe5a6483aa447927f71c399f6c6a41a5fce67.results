Hotel managers all perceived the WG as a positive stimulus to Kaohsiung City tourism development from a long-term perspective. The transformation of the city image, the marketing of the city brand name, and the improvement in basic infrastructure were deemed to be strong advantages to attract a diverse array of visitors in the future. In particular, the newly built US$145 million World Games stadium was highly regarded as an effective venue to host large events in Kaohsiung City. Compared with the Deaflympics in Taipei, hotel managers indicated that 2009 WG received greater praise and positive publicity, demonstrating that local government had the ability to stage a large-scale activity. This perspective was further confirmed by the endorsement of the IWGA officials in claiming this event as the "the best World Games ever" (International World Games Association, 2011). However, for the short-term operation, hotel managers all stated that the WG generated only a modest one-time peak in demand and did not maintain a steady tourism volume afterward; at least, the effect was not observed during the 3-month period after the WG (AugusteNovember, 2009). Fifteen hotels (75%) indicated that room sales during the event were lower than expected, whereas only one hotel indicated a 30% sales increase during July compared with typical monthly revenue. Four hotel managers (20%) declined to comment on that issue directly. Hotel managers provided various factors that may help to address this unsatisfactory sales figure during and shortly after the event period. Their opinions are summarized in the following.
