The cytoplasmic domain is required for S protein particle assembly To identify the sequences in the TM and/or CD that control the S protein's virion assembly, we constructed chimeric spike proteins of which either the TM (MFM) or the CD (MMF) of MHV S was replaced by a corresponding domain of FIPV S (Fig. 1 ). In the three-letter designation of the constructs the first letter refers to the viral origin of the ectodomain, the second and third letters indicate the origin of TM and CD, respectively. In the chimeric MFF and MFM gene, the transition from the MHV S ectodomain to the FIPV S TM was at the highly conserved KWPW(W/Y) VWL amino acid sequence motif (Fig. 1A) . The junction between the TM and the CD in the MFM and MMF chimeras was at the conserved TGC motif occurring in the cysteine-rich region (Fig. 1) . The proper folding, transport to the plasma membrane, and membrane fusion capacity of the chimeric proteins MFF, MFM, and MMF were confirmed by looking at their acquisition of endoglycosidase H (endoH) resistance, their cell surface expression, and their cell-cell fusion induction, respectively (data not shown). To evaluate the ability of the recombinant S proteins to interact intracellularly with the M protein we employed a previously developed co-immunoprecipitation assay . In addition, assembly of the recombinant spike proteins into VLPs was examined using a VLP affinity-isolation assay (de Haan et al., 2000) . Thus, the MHV M and E protein were co-expressed using the vaccinia virus expression system in OST7-1 cells in combination with either the MHV S protein or the MFF, MFM, or MMF S proteins. Cells were radiolabeled from 6 to 9 h post-infection (pi) after which cell lysates and media were prepared and subjected to coIP and VLP affinity isolation, respectively, with either the anti-MHV serum or the anti-S mAb (Fig. 2) . The intracellular expression of the M protein and the (recombinant) S proteins was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with the anti-MHV serum ( Fig.  2A) . The immunoprecipitation performed on cell lysates expressing the MHV M + E + S proteins using the anti-S mAb not only brought down the S protein but, as anticipated, also the MHV M protein, indicating that the proteins occurred in association (positive control). The chimeric proteins MFF and MMF, both containing the CD of FIPV S, did not interact with the MHV M protein, as judged from the absence of co-precipitation (negative control). In contrast, the M protein was co-precipitated when co-expressed with the MFM chimera, indicating that the CD of MHV S is required for the interaction and that replacement of just the transmembrane domain of MHV S by that of FIPV S does not affect this interaction. The assembly of the MHV-FIPV S chimeric proteins into viral particles was examined by performing affinity-isolations of VLPs present in the culture media (Fig. 2B ). VLPs were formed whenever the MHV M and E protein were coexpressed, as shown by the presence of the M protein in immuno-isolations done with the anti-MHV serum. Copurification of M from the culture media using the anti-S mAb was observed when the M and E proteins were coexpressed with either the MHV S protein or the chimeric protein MFM, but not with the MFF and MMF chimeras. These results are consistent with the conclusions from the co-immunoprecipitation experiments and confirm that the CD of MHV S is essential for interaction with the MHV M protein and for its assembly into virus-like particles. To obtain further confirmation for the essential role of the S protein CD in these processes we tested the different S proteins also in a reciprocal system by analyzing their interaction with the FIPV M protein using the co-immunoprecipitation assay. The FIPV M and E proteins were coexpressed using the vaccinia virus expression system with MHV S or with the MHV/FIPV S chimeras MFF, MFM, or MMF. Radiolabeled viral proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using an anti-FIPV serum and the anti-S mAb and the precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C ). The immunoprecipitation with the anti-FIPV serum confirmed the intracellular expression of the FIPV M protein. The anti-S mAb immunoprecipitated the (chimeric) spike proteins and co-immunoprecipitated the FIPV M protein but only when co-expressed with the chimeric S proteins MFF and MMF, both of which contain the CD of FIPV S. Co-immunoprecipitation of FIPV M protein was not seen when MHV S or the MFM chimera were coexpressed, confirming that the S protein's CD is required for the specific interaction with the M protein. Due to the low yields of FIPV VLPs we were unable to examine the assembly of the MHV-FIPV S chimeric proteins into viral particles through VLP affinity isolation. S protein cytoplasmic domain is sufficient for particle incorporation Because coronavirus S protein TM domains are sufficiently conserved (65% identity; Fig. 1A ) to potentially explain the lack of effect of their swapping between MHV S and FIPV S on the interaction of the S proteins with the M proteins and on their incorporation into VLPs, we could not conclude that the CD by itself is responsible for these observations. To further study the importance of this domain we investigated whether the MHV S CD is sufficient to mediate the assembly of a foreign viral membrane protein into the MHV envelope. Thus we made vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G/MHV S chimeras in which the entire carboxy-terminal domain (G-STC) or just the CD (G-SC) of the non-related G protein were replaced by that of MHV S (Fig. 1B) . The chimeric proteins were examined for their ability to interact with MHV M protein and for their incorporation into MHV-based VLPs using again the coimmunoprecipitation and VLP affinity isolation assays. The MHV M and E protein were co-expressed alone or in combination with either the wild-type VSV G protein or one of the chimeric G-STC or G-SC proteins as described before. Co-immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled viral proteins from the cell lysates and VLP affinity isolation from the culture media were performed using the anti-MHV serum or the anti-VSV serum. The SDS-PAGE analyses of Fig. 3A show that the M protein, the VSV G protein, and the VSV G/MHV S chimeras were indeed produced. Where the chimeric proteins were expressed, the anti-VSV serum also precipitated an approximately 62-kDa protein. Most likely this protein corresponds to a soluble form of the VSV G/ MHV S chimeras, as has been observed previously for VSV G in infected cells (Garreis-Wabnitz and Kruppa, 1984; Graeve et al., 1986) . For wt VSV G this protein band was only apparent in the culture media (data not shown) indicating that during the chase the soluble form of VSV G was efficiently secreted. The MHV M protein was coimmunoprecipitated using the anti-VSV serum when coexpressed with G-STC and G-SC, but not with wild-type VSV G. This provides evidence that replacement of just the CD of VSV G by that of MHV S is sufficient for interaction with the MHV M protein. Consistently, VLPs could be affinity isolated from the culture medium using the anti-VSV serum (Fig. 3B ) when the M and E proteins were coexpressed with G-STC and G-SC but not with the wild-type VSV G protein, indicating that the S protein transmembrane domain is not required for interaction with the M protein and for subsequent VLP incorporation. Only the membrane-proximal part of the CD is required for S protein particle assembly Knowing the importance of the CD for S protein particle incorporation we wanted to further define this role by studying a series of increasingly truncated forms of the protein. The MHV spike protein has a 38-residue CD containing a conserved cysteine-rich region (boxed sequence in Fig. 1B ). This is probably the region where palmitoylation of the S protein occurs, while the region has also been implicated to play a role in membrane fusion (Bos et al., 1995) . Three S protein mutants were constructed in which the CD was truncated by 12, 25, and 35 residues, respectively. When expressed in cells the proteins could be detected at the cell surface by immunofluorescence (data not shown) indicating their proper transport to the plasma membrane. Their membrane fusion capacity was tested in a cell-cell fusion assay (Fig. 4) . Truncation of the spike CD by 12 or 25 residues (SD12 and SD25, respectively) did not abolish cell-cell fusion, although less fusion was observed with the SD25 mutant. No cell-cell fusion was seen with the SD35 mutant supporting the importance of the cysteine-rich region for membrane fusion. The truncated spike proteins were then assessed for their interaction with M protein and for their VLP incorporation by co-expression with the MHV M and E proteins as described before. The resulting cell lysates and culture media were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation and VLP affinity isolation, respectively, using the anti-MHV serum and the anti-S mAb followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. As the co-immunoprecipitation patterns of Fig. 5A demonstrate, the SD12 protein was able to interact with the M protein as efficiently as the wild-type S protein, whereas SD25 and SD35 showed a strong reduction in their ability to associate with the M protein. Consistently, the VLP affinity isolation showed the SD12 to be efficiently incorporated into VLPs whereas VLP inclusion of the spike mutants lacking the C-terminal 25 and 35 amino acids was almost completely abolished (Fig. 5B) .
