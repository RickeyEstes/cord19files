To demonstrate the suitability of our in-house developed software tool PCRv, we determined the in silico sensitivity and specificity of three PCR tests for West Nile virus (WNV) recommended by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) (Eiden et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2001) . These WNV PCR tests represented three different formats; a real-time PCR test, a conventional PCR test and a nested PCR test (Table 1) .
