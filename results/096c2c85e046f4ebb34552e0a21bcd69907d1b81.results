We have analyzed a total of 263 patients who have donated stem cells either for autologous or allogeneic usage between 1996 and 2014. The male to female ratio was 1.39 to 1. An approximate equal number of autologous and allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell collections were undertaken. The median age for Autologous donors is 35 years, whereas that of Allogeneic donors is 25 years. The infectious disease of the patients has been enumerated and shown in Table 1 . Transplants carried out are broadly classified into two major groups; autologous and allogeneic transplants. Each of these two major groups is further sub classified on the basis of sex and the various age groups of the donor. This is enumerated in Chart 1. We have tabulated the distribution of the male and female donors among the various age groups from autologous and allogeneic donors which is shown in Table 2 . Infectious disease screening was done for all donors irrespective of the nature of transplantation. We have seen the prevalence of infectious diseases in 20 of the 263 donors/patients that have been identified for transplantation. This can be seen in Chart 2. Of the 263 stem cell donors, we found 18 patients (autologous condition) and 2 donors (allogeneic) to be infected
