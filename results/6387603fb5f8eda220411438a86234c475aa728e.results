Phenotypic and Functional characterization of activated spleen-Derived (sp)-MΦ Nitrite and urea production are known to be effective functional measures of M(LPS + IFN-γ) and M(IL-4) polarization, respectively (6, 8) . Therefore, to demonstrate plasticity of Sp-MΦ, we characterized the biochemical properties profiles of polarized BM-MΦ and Sp-MΦ following IFN-γ (16 h) + LPS (8 h) or IL-4 stimulation (24 h). In agreement with previous publications, BM-MΦ and Sp-MΦ induce significant nitrite production after M(LPS + IFN-γ) stimulating conditions ( Figure 1A : left panel), while producing urea following IL-4 treatment ( Figure 1A : right panel) confirming previous published data (6, 8) . Thus, both BM-MΦ and tissue-derived Sp-MΦ show similar biochemical profiles when polarized into M(LPS + IFN-γ) and M(IL-4) status as reported previously (8) . Professional antigen presenting cells (pAPC) such as MΦ are needed for the activation of adaptive immune cells (30) , as they are involved in antigen presentation via both MHC-I and MHC-II as well as their expression of costimulatory molecules (31) . Nevertheless, LCMV has evolved mechanisms to interrupt APC activation and costimulatory molecule expression (32) . Therefore, in order to assess the ability of polarized Sp-MΦ to engage CD8 + T-cell receptors, we characterized surface expression of activated Sp-MΦ markers following 24 h of LCMV infection ( Figure 1B) . With regard to CD80 expression, M0 and M(LPS + IFN-γ) cells increased surface levels following viral infection, while M(IL-4) cells expression of CD80 remained largely unchanged (column 1). Interestingly, M0 cells slightly decreased CD86 expression following LCMV infection compared with M(LPS + IFN-γ) and M(IL-4) cells where no change was detected (column 2). M0 cells exhibited slight MHC-I reduction but not M(LPS + IFN-γ) or M(IL-4) Sp-MΦ (column 3). In addition, we also assessed expression of the inhibitory molecule PD-L1 (column 4). We observed that M(LPS + IFN-γ) cells expressed the greatest levels of PD-L1, while M0 and M(IL-4) had similar expression levels, which confirmed data in BM-MΦ published by another group (33) . LCMV infection increased expression of PD-L1 in M0 and M(IL-4), while reduced expression in M(LPS + IFN-γ) Sp-MΦ. These data demonstrate that polarized cells are not negatively affected by LCMV infection when considering CD80/86 or MHC-I expression, while LCMV increases inhibitory molecule PD-L1 expression in M2 and M0 cells, but not M(LPS + IFN-γ). To characterize further the functional profile of polarized cells, we investigated the release of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines in uninfected and LCMV-infected (24 h) Sp-MΦ. As expected, for the secretion of the cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 ( Figure 1C ), M0 and M(IL-4) cells were poor, while M(LPS + IFN-γ) stimulation produced substantial levels agreeing with what has been described previously (34) . Interestingly, 24 h post-LCMV infection, M0 and M(IL-4) cells both significantly increased production of TNF-α and IL-6. Moreover, M(LPS + IFN-γ) cells had reduced production of TNF-α after infection but were still producing significantly higher amounts than M0 and M(IL-4). No changes in IL-6 secretion were observed with M(LPS + IFN-γ) after the infection. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection significantly decreased production of IL-12p40, in M0 and M(LPS + IFN-γ) cells while the opposite is true for M(IL-4), where production levels increased. Collectively, these data point to LCMV-promoting M(IL-4) cells to acquire a mixed M(LPS + IFN-γ)/M(IL-4) phenotype considering the ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines post-infection. For the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, LCMV infection increased secretion in all subsets; however, M(LPS + IFN-γ) and M(IL-4) produced substantially less amounts than M0 infected cells ( Figure 1C ).
