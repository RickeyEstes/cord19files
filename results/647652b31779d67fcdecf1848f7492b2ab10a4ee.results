The overall trends are shown in Fig. 1 , including the representative keywords " " ("MERS (in Korean)") obtained via Google search and Twitter, the number of new laboratory-confirmed cases, and the number of quarantined cases. Peaks on Google search and Twitter with regard to use of the "MERS (in Korean)" search term are shown for June 2. New confirmed cases peaked 5 days later (i.e., June 7) and quarantined cases peaked 15 days later (i.e., June 17) . In addition, overall graph patterns among them were similar. The raw data in Fig. 1 are shown in Supplementary Table 1. Figure 2 and Table 1 show high lag correlations between the laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV and the Google search results (Fig. 2a) and tweets on Twitter (Fig. 2b) . Three days earlier, the results obtained using the three keywords "MERS", "MERS (in Korean)", and " " ("MERS hospital (in Korean)") in Google search showed high correlations (r > 0.7). These three keywords maintained high correlations until the four day time-lag; however, " " ("MERS symptoms (in Korean)") had the highest correlation (r = 0.786, p < 0.05) at a zero day time-lag, and this high correlation was preserved for two days. The trends for the comparisons with Twitter data were similar to those of the Google search data with high correlations and maintenance. "MERS symptoms (in Korean)" was high, but the correlation of "MERS" began decreasing from the start, similar to the results of "MERS symptoms (in Korean)" in the Google search data. Figure 3 and Table 1 also show the high lag correlations between the number of quarantined cases and Google search results or Twitter tweets. However, there were some differences in the trends of the results of the quarantined cases. Contrary to the results of the new laboratory-confirmed cases, the lag correlation coefficients of all keywords continuously increased for both the Google search and Twitter results. The highest correlation coefficients of these keywords were approximately 0.9 for seven days, and they were higher than those of the new laboratory-confirmed cases. The rank of correlation for the keywords was different according to the type of cases (refer to Figs 2 and 3) and the Google/Twitter results (refer to a) and b) in Fig. 3 ). For example, "MERS symptoms (in Korean)" had the highest correlation coefficient with new laboratory-confirmed cases on Twitter (Fig. 2b) and with quarantined cases on Google search (Fig. 3a) but the lowest correlation coefficient for new laboratory-confirmed cases on Google (Fig. 2a) and quarantined cases on Twitter (Fig. 3b) . The raw data for Figs 2 and 3 are shown in Table 1 . The subgroup analyses focusing on the new laboratory-confirmed cases of the acceleration and deceleration period are shown in Fig. 4 . Most correlation coefficients are higher than 0.7 and are maintained highly during this time lag. The ranking of correlation coefficients of the keywords during this period was similar to that of the entire study period. The results of the other subgroup analyses are provided in Supplementary Figures 1-3 . Scientific RepoRts | 6:32920 | DOI: 10.1038/srep32920 Correlation coefficients between the search keywords and tweets were high but peaks among them were somewhat different. Among the search keywords in Google, correlation coefficients were higher than 0.8, but the correlation coefficient between "MERS symptoms (in Korean)" and "MERS hospital (in Korean)" was 0.792 (Supplementary Table 2 ). The peak of "MERS symptoms (in Korean)" was on June 2 but the other keywords had peaks on June 2 or 3 (Supplementary Table 1 ). In Twitter, all correlation coefficients were higher than 0.9 except for that between "MERS" and "MERS symptoms (in Korean)" (r = 0.871, p < 0.05). The peaks of "MERS" and "MERS (in Korean)" are shown on June 2 but peaks of "MERS symptoms (in Korean)" and "MERS hospital (in Korean)" on June 7.
