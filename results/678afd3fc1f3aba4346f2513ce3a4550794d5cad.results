LaCl 3 -Induced JA Generation in S. baicalensis Seedlings As shown in Fig. 1 , S. baicalensis seedlings responded to LaCl 3 treatment by rapidly generating JA. JA levels in JAMe was used in this work to investigate the effects of exogenous JA on baicalin production in the absence of LaCl 3 (Fig. 3) . JAMe stimulated baicalin production, exceeding as much as 90 % of the LaCl 3 response after 5 days of treatment.
