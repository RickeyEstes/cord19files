Display of the cDNA library from N2a cells on T7 phage T7 phage was enumerated using the plaque assay method on LB semi-solid medium. Based on the PFU after in vitro packaging, the T7 phage display library from the N2a cells was calculated to contain 1.5 × 10 7 independent clones. The amplified library with a titer of 6.4 × 10 10 pfu/mL was used for the subsequent screening. Amplification of the inserts in randomly selected clones revealed that the library contained >90% recombinants, with an average insert size of >300 bp. Because the size of the phage display library exceeded the estimated number, most of the expressed genes were represented in this library (Fig. 1) .
