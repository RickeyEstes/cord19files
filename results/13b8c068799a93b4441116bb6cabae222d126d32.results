Oligonucleotide microarray for rapid detection of AIV, NDV, IBV, IBDV In the result of analysis of nucleotide sequences from NCBI "Influenza Virus Sequence Database"genes encoding M and NP proteins were chosen for AIV identification. Nucleotide sequences of gene encoding NP protein were selected for NDV. Segment A of VP2 protein was used for IBDV. Nucleotide sequences of gene encoding S1 protein were chosen for IBV identification. Oligonucleotide primers and probes were produced in the course of standard automatic synthesis in DNA/ RNA Synthesizer H-16 (K&A Laborgeraete, Germany), their sequences are shown in Tables 3 and 4 . The selected oligonucleotide probes were used to develop a microarray for rapid diagnosis of AIV, NDV, IBV, and IBDV. Probes were applied on the support by the method of contact printing in Nano Print LM60 (Arrayit Corp., USA). The study has shown that amplification products hybridize on the microarray only in case of obtaining sufficient number of single-chain fluorescently-labeled fragments of NP and M (AIV), NP (NDV), VP2 (IBDV), and S1 (IBV). The electrophoregram has shown PCR products-305 bp (AIV), 411 bp (NDV), 421 bp (IBV), 593 bp (IBDV) (Fig. 1) . Hybridization on the microarray of the obtained fluorescently-labeled fragments of NP and M2 (AIV), VP2 (IBDV), S1 (IBV), NP (NDV) genes of the viruses under study resulted in formation on glass slide of stable hybridization complexes with high binding energy and oligonucleotides the sequences of which were complementary to sequences of hybridized NP and M2 of AIV, VP2 of IBDV, S1 of IBV, NP of NDV gene fragments. For interpretation of the results the microarray layout is shown on Fig. 2 . The first two horizontal rows contain universal oligonucleotide probes to NP and M2 genes of AIV, next are probes for detection of VP2 gene of IBDV and S1 gene of IBV. Last row contains probes for detection of NP gene of NDV. In the microarray layout there are 16 identical subarrays arranged into 2 columns and 8 rows containing oligonucleotide probes that are complementary to antisense strand of AIV, NDV, IBV and IBDV genes. The DNA-chip was scanned with InnoScan710AL ("Innopsys", France) by Cy5 channel activation. The results were interpreted with use of Mapix ver. 5.5.0 software. The signal exceeding the background value was adopted as a positive result. The finding of the study considered reliable if in the course of scanning by Cy5 channel bright fluorescent spots were observed. In the assay of samples the value of specific fluorescence reliably exceeded the value of the background signal (P < 0.05) (Figs. 3 and 4) . As Figs. 3 and 4 show M2 and NP genes of AIV, VP2 gene of IBDV, S1 gene of IBV and NP gene of NDV were reliably detected in all specimens. For testing specificity of the method direct sequencing of the PCR-products in ABI PRISM 3130 xl Genetic Analyser, Applied Biosystems was carried out. The synthesized nucleotide sequences were analyzed using BLAST program. These nucleotide sequences that are the fragments of NP and M2 (AIV), VP2 (IBDV), S1 (IBV), NP (NDV) genes were compared with the data of the Genbank Database. Computer analysis has shown the amplified specific PCR-products of AIV, NDV, IBV, IBDV to be parts of their genomes. So, homology of compared sequences confirms specificity of the developed method. The results of the performed experiments prove again that the used fragments of tested genes are highly specific for AIV, NDV, IBV, IBDV. The limit of detection of the assay method is 10 2 copies of RNA. Testing of the microarray with use of viruses from the RIBSP microbial collection Different strains of AIV, NDV, IBV and IBDV were used to test the oligonucleotide microarray. Testing was carried out in comparison with real-time RT-PCR (Table 5) . Fifteen different strains of AIV, NDV, IBV and IBDV, diverse in their origin, epidemiological and biological characteristic, were identified correctly with use of DNA microarray. Diagnostic results of testing DNA microarray with use of virus strains from the RIBSP microbial collection were comparable to the results of the realtime RT-PCR. Sensitivity of the microarray was comparable to the sensitivity of real-time RT-PCR.
