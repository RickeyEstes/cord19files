The main clinical manifestations observed in both groups included fever, cough, and dyspnea. However, the HRV positive group had a significantly lower proportion of cases with fever (62%, p = 0.001), and more comorbidities than the other group (40% vs. 27%, p = 0.043). Although immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, and heart disease were the major medical conditions present in both groups, chronic lung disease was more frequent in the HRV group (17%), but without significant difference. Concerning the diagnosis of SARI, there were fewer patients diagnosed with this syndrome in the HRV group (60%, p = 0.006) than in the other CRV group. In the multivariate analysis of the relationship between clinical characteristics significantly different between the HRV-and other CRV-groups, only the higher prevalence of previous comorbidities in the HRV group was significant. Patients with no comorbidities were 1.6 (95% CI: 1.04---2.34) times more likely to be infected CRVs other than HRV, in comparison to patients with comorbidities. Despite the fact that most of chest X-rays of HRV infected cases were missed (53%), radiologic alterations were described in 83% of the performed exams. Most of the findings observed were interstitial infiltrate (33%) and pulmonary consolidation (28%), with no significant difference between both groups. Severe disease was defined as that requiring mechanical ventilatory support, or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or death during hospitalization; no significant difference was found between the groups. Two HRV infected patients died during hospitalization, both from respiratory infection complications. HRV had the highest rates of coinfection (69%) of the 128 samples with more than one CRV detected. The viruses most co-detected with HRV were EV (40/88; 45%) and RSV (29/88; 33%), as shown in Fig. 1 . In 52% of cases, the co-detection involved HRV plus another virus, and in 16% of cases, HRV was associated with two or more viruses. In 65 cases, HRV was the only virus detected. A comparison of the clinical characteristics of monoinfected HRV patients with co-infected HRV patients was performed, and no relation between viral co-detection and disease severity (p = 0.717) was found. The clinical features significantly associated with HRV co-detection were as follows: age 6---48 months (OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.3---8.1), length of hospitalization more than 30 days (OR = 9.7; 95% CI: 2.5---36.8), and no SARI diagnosis (OR = 4.0; 95% CI: 1.7---9.3). As co-infection with HRV alone was not related with severe disease, a second analysis was performed comparing disease severity between HRV co-infected patients and patients infected with other CRVs. Neither the presence nor absence of HRV co-detection was associated with disease severity (p = 0.196). Cases of HRV infection occurred throughout the study period (Fig. 2) . The months of May to August demonstrated the highest number of HRV infections during 2012, peaking in August (17 cases; 10%). In 2013, the seasonality of HRV infection was from March to May, peaking in May (19 cases; 12%). Comparing the monthly distribution of HRV cases with average temperature ( • C) and rainfall (mm), a negative correlation between the number of HRV cases and the average temperature (rs = −0.636, p < 0.001) was demonstrated, but there was no significant correlation with rainfall (rs = −0.036, p = 0.866).
