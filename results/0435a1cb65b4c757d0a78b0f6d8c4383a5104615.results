The infection control unit has completed 17 audits at this institution within the last 13 years. The wards and services reviewed included intensive care, emergency department, orthopedic surgery, solid organ transplantation, outpatient clinics, spinal cord injury unit, pathology and clinical laboratory services, morgue, food and nutrition services, occupational therapy kitchens, respiratory services, operating room, radiology, and hemodialysis. On average, each audit occurs over 3 to 6 months and entails approximately 50 to 100 ICP hours. Approximately, 1525 staff members have been contacted during the audit periods. Questionnaires on routine precautions have been completed by 401 staff. There were 390 forms available for demographic analysis of which 60% were submitted by nursing staff ( Table 1 ). The age range was 20 to 65 years with an average of 14.5 years in health care. Approximately half of respondents had attended an infection control education session; however, the majority felt that they understood basic principles of infection control, particularly barrier use (Table 2 ). When formal knowledge was assessed, however, deficiencies were noted in application of routine precautions, barrier use for airborne infections, and hand hygiene practice (Table 3) . A total of 257 recommendations have been made, and 95% have been acted on ( Table 4 ). The most common recommendations focused on proper environmental cleaning (11%), proper equipment cleaning protocols (11%), correct use of personal protective equipment (11%), hand hygiene procedures (8%), and separation of clean and soiled supplies (8%). In many instances, once a problem or deficiency was identified, it was corrected prior to completion of the audit. Large scale improvements resulting directly from the audit process include the introduction of standardized orders for antimicrobial prophylaxis (arising from the first operating room audit in 1996); the addition of alcohol handrub dispensers throughout the institution beginning in 1995 (to address observed lack of hand hygiene stations); the introduction of a template in 1998 to address additional costs associated with enhanced infection control measures in the tendering process for new construction and renovations (a response to physical plant design constraints observed in the audits); and, more specifically, the addition of 102 negative-pressure rooms in the new acute care tower (20% of all beds). Other improvements arising from audit recommendations include use of the hands-free technique for passing sharps (2000); enhanced personal protective equipment and new safety protocols in the autopsy suites (1999); revised protocols for cleaning of dialysis machines; and introduction of syndromic surveillance for gastrointestinal and respiratory infections in the emergency department (2003).
