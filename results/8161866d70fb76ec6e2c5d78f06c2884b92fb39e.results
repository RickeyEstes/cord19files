A total of 170 cDNA samples tested positive for HPIV (N = 19, 24, 85 and 42 for HPIV1-4, respectively). Of these, 90 patient samples tested positive for only a single HPIV species while 11 were co-infections of two HPIV species; HPIV2 and HPIV3 (N = 1), HPIV2 and HPIV4 (N = 1), HPIV3 and HPIV4 (N = 9) ( Table 1 ). The remaining 69 (41%) HPIV-positive samples also tested positive for other respiratory viruses. In general, HPIV3 and HPIV4 were more commonly associated with viral co-infections, with Rhinovirus/Enterovirus most frequently co-detected, being present in 47 of 170 (28%) of HPIV infections. Notably, bocavirus was found as a co-infection with each HPIV species, and was found in 15 of 170 (9%) HPIV-positive samples. We first examined the clinical presentation of HPIV in the outpatient study that recruited children under 16 years with ARI. In this study, the median age and gender distribution of infected children and frequency of clinical presentation (fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose and nasal congestion) as well as vital signs (pulse and respiratory rate) and duration of illness at presentation were similar between HPIV species (p > 0.05). For all the HPIV species, presentation as an illness with wheeze was more common than with crepitations. Next, we compared the clinical diagnosis at presentation and follow-up. The proportion of pneumonia or bronchiolitis at presentation was 4/12 (33%), 1/14 (7%), 21/56 (38%), 6/28 (21%) for HPIV1-4, respectively. Further, the proportion presenting as lower respiratory infection was high both at presentation [10/12 (83%), 8/14 (57%), 39/56 (70%) and 18/28 (64%)] and follow-up [10/12 (83%), 9/12 (75%), 36/52 (69%), 16/28 (57%)] for HPIV 1-4, respectively, indicating a high morbidity and poor resolution of symptoms. The inpatient study consisted of children under 2 years of age with a diagnosis of ALRI 17 . The age, gender distribution and clinical presentation were similar between viral species. For all 4 HPIV species, at least one clinical sign of ALRI (rapid respiratory rate or intercostal in-drawing) was present in the majority of children [HPIV1 6/7 (86%), HPIV2 10/10 (100%), HPIV3 25/29 (86%), HPIV4 14/14 (100%)]. Bronchiolitis was more commonly seen with HPIV1, 2 and 4 (5/7, 71%; 5/8, 63%; 12/14, 86%; respectively) compared to HPIV3 (15/28, 54%). Complete clinical recovery at 7 days post-admission was infrequent for HPIV1 and HPIV4 (1/7, 2/14, 14% each, respectively) compared to HPIV2 and HPIV3 (4/8, 50% and 13/28, 46%, respectively) (p > 0.05). The duration of the ALRI episode as inferred by a telephonic interview at 4-6 months, was similar for all HPIV species (p > 0.05). Oxygen therapy at admission was only required for a subset of patients infected with HPIV3 (2/29, 7%) and HPIV4 (1/14, 7%), while only the two HPIV3 infected patients were admitted to intensive care. We were able to generate sequences from 71 (42%) of the available 170 cDNA samples from both studies. In total, we obtained 293 viral gene sequences, wherein 201 were above 90% total gene coverage. For co-infections, sequences were obtained from the HPIV species with the lower C q value. The individual virus names, sampling dates, sequenced viral genes and corresponding accession numbers are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . We reconstructed the temporal phylogeny using the newly generated full-length HN gene of HPIV1-4 (N = 6, 4, 30 and 1, respectively) and publicly available data (N = 182, 30, 489 and 24, respectively). Results indicated that HPIV1 has been circulating in humans since the 1940's, with time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) estimated as 1948 (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 1944-1952) ( Table 2 ). Since the mid-1990s, HPIV1 has diverged into two distinct monophyletic lineages (clades 1 and 2) that co-circulate worldwide. All Vietnamese viruses sequenced within this study clustered in clade 2 along with viruses from Argentina, Japan and USA (Fig. 1A) . Limited genetic data is available for HPIV2 and HPIV4 and this may influence the estimation of dates and these results must therefore be interpreted with caution. The mean TMRCA for HPIV2 was estimated as 1896 (95% HPD: 1850-1925). HPIV2 also diverged into two clades with clade 1 viruses predominant in the 1980s until they were superseded by clade 2 viruses during the early 2000s (Fig. 1B) . All Vietnamese HPIV2 viruses sequenced from this study, as well as all sequences obtained after the year 2000 from Asia, belong to clade 2. The mean TMRCA of the HPIV4 viruses was estimated at 1955 (95% HPD: 1938-1968), while the TMRCAs for HPIV4A and HPIV4B were estimated as 1989 (95% HPD: 1981-1994) and 1994 (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) , respectively. The single Vietnamese HPIV4 sequence grouped with HPIV4A subspecies viruses but was relatively distant and in a basal position to other known HPIV4A virus sequences. The mean TMRCA of HPIV3 was estimated at 1943 (95% HPD: 1938-1948), which is similar to the age of HPIV1 (Table 2 ). HPIV3 has also diverged into two major monophyletic clades (clades 1 and 2 in Fig. 2) . In marked contrast to other HPIVs, the HPIV3 phylogeny exhibits more extensive lineage diversification in the 2000s, with some indication of continuous genetic drift, indicated by a ladder-like phylogeny 27 , that is more evident within the clade 1 than clade 2 ( Fig. 2A) . Viral lineage turnover is also present, whereby older virus strains become extinct and are replaced by newer strains. Clade 1 viruses also demonstrated greater diversification of multiple independent lineages and inter-continental mixing of the viruses than clade 2 viruses. Our results also show that the HPIV3 infections in Viet Nam during 2009-2010 resulted from at least five independent virus introductions that are highlighted as clades V1-V5 in Fig. 2A . The viruses detected in Viet Nam were generally closely related to viruses from East Asia, although clades comprised viruses from diverse geographic areas (for examples see Fig. 2B and C). In clades V2 and V4 there is one cluster each of HPIV3 viruses from Viet Nam that were detected over a period of 14-15 months, suggesting sustained endemic circulation. The mean TMRCA of clade V4 was estimated as 2005 (95% HPD: [2004] [2005] [2006] suggesting that these viruses may have been circulating in Viet Nam for at least 5 years. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this may be due to inadequate global sampling and sequencing of HPIV3 viruses. We also reconstructed the HPIV3 phylogeny using 24 newly generated whole genomes and 138 publicly available genomes. The whole-genome HPIV3 phylogeny was largely congruent with the HN phylogeny, showing multiple clades of viruses that circulate globally (Supplementary Fig. 1) . We further performed phylogeographic analysis to investigate the extent of HPIV3 migration into and out of Viet Nam during 2009-2010. Our results show that the total diffusion rates of HPIV3 into Viet Nam from all other areas are significantly greater than from Viet Nam into all other regions . This indicates that Viet Nam was not acting as a source population for epidemics elsewhere but was a net importer of HPIV3 diversity in 2009-2010.
