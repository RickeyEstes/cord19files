The number of patients in the initial outbreak of SARS in Amoy Gardens is shown in Figure 1 . The demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of patients residing in E block (where the index patient resided) and those residing in non-E blocks were compared (Table) . Seventyfive patients (94.9%) were Chinese and 4 were Filipino. There were 38 male and 41 female patients. The mean (SD) age was 39.4 (11.5) years (range 20-72 years). Fiftythree patients (67.1%) were residents of E block; 10 (12.7%) were residents of E7 and 25 (31.6%) were residents of E8. The relationships between viral load and distribution of patients from E7 and E8 are shown in Figure 3A and B, respectively. In E7, patients who resided within a few stories of the 16th floor had higher viral loads. For cases in neighboring E8, the distribution of patients and viral loads was random. The median nasopharyngeal viral load in E block patients (5.09 log 10 copies/mL) was much higher than in non-E block patients (0 log 10 copies/mL) on admission (p<0.001). On admission, no statistically significant differences were found between E block patients and non-E block patients in terms of all demographic characteristics, initial radiographic findings, and baseline laboratory results (Table) . The mean day of collection of nasopharyngeal specimens from E-block and non-E block patients did not differ significantly. Overall, the mean (SD) number of days from onset of symptoms to collection of nasopharyngeal samples was 3.22 (1.5), and no correlation was found between initial nasopharyngeal viral load and time elapsed from symptom onset date to the day of sample collection (Spearman ρ -0.16, p = 0.156). Median viral loads of each unit of different blocks are shown in Figure 2 . The initial nasopharyngeal load of patients was highly correlated with the distance in relation to the block of the index patient (Spearman ρ -0.63, p<0.001, Figure 4 ). The percentage of specimens with a negative nasopharyngeal viral load in each block in order of patient distance from block E was as follows: block E (4/52) 7.7%; block D (4/7) 57.1%; block F (2/2) 100%; block C (1/6) 15.2%; block G (2/2) 100%; block A (1/1) 100%; block B (2/6) 33.3%; and block H (1/1) 100% (p = 0.04 by chi-square test). Subgroup analysis showed that patients in E7 and E8 had the highest median viral load, 6.80 and 5.98 log 10 copies/mL, respectively. Patients from these 2 units also accounted for 12.7% and 31.6% of the total number of patients, respectively. This pattern of distribution is strongly affected by the distance of the patients' units from the index patient (Figures 2 and 4) . On the basis of a visual inspection of the layout of the units (Figure 2 ), the direction in which patients' flats faced may also have influenced the viral load; patients in flats that faced away from the index patient's unit had a lower viral load. The overall case death rate among the 79 patients was 24.1%. The highest rate was in block E, which accounted for 79% of all deaths, while the death rate in patients living in E7 (the same block as the index patient) was 70% (7 patients). This rate is significantly higher than in other units (p = 0.001 by χ 2 test). The index patient was one of the few patients from E7 who survived the disease.
