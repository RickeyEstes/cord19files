Ninety-two serum samples from giant pandas from three captive facilities were tested for antibodies against CDV, CAV-1, CCV, CPV-2 and CPIV (Table 3 ). In this study, antibody titers were classified as negative (negative at the lowest test dilution), suspect (low positive), and positive. Titers up to 1:16 for CDV and CAV-1 and 1:20 for CPV were classified as suspect. Positive titers were categorized as >1:16 for CDV and CAV-1 and >1:20 for CPV.
