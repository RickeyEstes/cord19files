The 5 0 -poly(U) of enterovirus negative strands is significantly shorter than the 3 0 -poly(A) of the positive RNA strands Using 3 0 -tailing and 5 0 -RACE reactions, we determined the lengths of the 3 0 -poly(A) of virion RNA and the 5 0 -poly(U) in (À) RNA for four different enteroviruses; CVB3, ECHO9, enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21) ( Figure 1A and B) . In all cases, the average size of the poly(A) was 80-90 nt, whereas the length of the poly(U) was only $20 nt ( Figure 1C ). The poly(A) of CVB3 RNA from purified virions recovered from different cell cultures (BGM, HeLa and COS) was of a similar average size (data not shown). OriR controls the initiation efficiency of negative RNA synthesis and the poly(A) length of virion RNA but not the size of the poly(U) of negative strands A simple explanation for the smaller size of the 5 0 -poly(U) tract compared with its 3 0 -poly(A) template is that (À) strand RNA synthesis is initiated on an internal position of the poly(A) template and there exists a spatial mechanism controlling the choice of this position. One can hypothesize that this mechanism involves the oriR. To examine this, two mutant RNAs, N70/A and N70/B, were generated, in which oriR was replaced by random sequences of 70 nt (Table 1) . These RNAs proved to be viable but exhibited a reduced rate of replication [cytopathic effect (CPE) developed 4-6 days after transfection versus 2 days in the case of wild-type (wt) transcripts]. Sequencing the virus pools showed that N70/A had retained the engineered mutations while an adenosine insertion was found in N70/B within an  The stop codon of the open reading frame (ORF) is shown in italics, the sequences acquired after transfection are in bold, the canonical cellular polyadenylation signal, AAUAAA, is underlined and the partial SalI site is double-underlined.

The recovered viruses showed impaired replication (!10-fold decrease in the single-cycle growth yield at 8 h p.i.) and small-plaque phenotypes (Figure 2A,B) . Luciferase-expressing CVB3 replicons with the 3 0 NCR replaced by the randomized RNA segments were assayed for RF accumulation in a cell-free system. The assay was performed with RNA transcripts containing two 5 0 -terminal non-viral G residues (originating from T7 RNA polymerase promoter), which suppressed (+) strand RNA synthesis, allowing thereby estimation of the (À) strand synthesis (14, 38) . Randomization of oriR resulted in a severe deficiency in RF accumulation ( Figure 2C ), suggesting impairment of the (À) strand initiation. OriR randomization also inhibited RNA replication in BGM cells, as determined by using luciferase-expressing CVB3 replicons ( Figure 2D ). The replicon RNAs used to transfect BGM cells contained authentic 5 0 -ends (owing to the presence of a ribozyme sequence), improving replication kinetics (14, 38) . The viral RNAs extracted from virions harboring randomized oriRs possessed a markedly shortened 3 0 -poly(A) (30-35 nt on average) but their 5 0 -poly(U) on (À) RNA retained a wt length of $20 nt ( Figure 2E ). These data confirmed the oriR involvement in the replication of (À) strands and uncovered its role in controlling the poly(A) length of the viral RNA. On the other hand, oriR has little, if any, effect on the poly(U) length in (À) strands.
