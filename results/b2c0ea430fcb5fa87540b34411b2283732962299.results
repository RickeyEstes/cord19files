The posterior probability of influenza appeared to be very sensitive to prior probability of influenza ( Fig. 3B and E) . Especially, if the prior probability of MERS was high (e.g., 90% due to widespread community transmission of MERS or if we have to examine cases at high risk such as those following close contact), the posterior probability of influenza was apparently smaller than A and B) The posterior probability of influenza given illness onset at t days since immigration (as compared to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)), calculated by using Eq. (11). We assumed that the travelers stay in country A for 5 days with two different rates of exponential growth (where exponential 1 corresponds to exponentially distributed generation time, while exponential 2 corresponds a constant generation time) or the uniformly distributed risk over time. The prior probability of influenza was assumed as 0.50. R 0 of MERS was assumed to be 0.63. (C and D) The average probability of influenza given illness onset from 0 to t days since immigration (as compared to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)), calculated by using Eq. (13). Only the results that assumed exponential growth with exponentially distributed generation time are shown, but other assumption yielded quantitatively similar estimates. Other parameters are identical to those adopted in panels A and B. 50% for those developing illness within 2 days since immigration. In the realistic situation with much greater endemicity of influenza than MERS for general travelers, the illness onset within 2 days from immigration was clearly suggestive of influenza. R 0 of MERS had little impact on the prediction of influenza diagnosis (Fig. 3C and F), which is in line with the limited sensitivity of the posterior probability to the growth rate of infection in Fig. 2 . The findings are summarized in Table 1 . It appeared that the posterior probability of influenza for those developing illness within 2 days since immigration is strongly influenced by the prior probability of influenza. This indicates that the high probability of influenza would not be the case even for those developing illness in 2 days if MERS transmission was more widespread than influenza or if the cases were at high risk of MERS (e.g. with suspected exposure to camels or other MERS cases in hospital) (Assiri et al., 2013b; Reusken et al., 2013a Reusken et al., , 2013b .
