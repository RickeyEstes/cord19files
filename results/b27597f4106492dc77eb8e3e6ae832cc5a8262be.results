Characterization of AnExILs and liposomes loaded with b-galactosidase and/or pDNA Cell-free protein synthesis was used to transcribe and translate the lacZ gene encoding for E. coli b-galactosidase either in bulk, inside liposomal compartments (AnExILs-IN) or adhered onto the surface of liposomes (AnExIL-ON) (For details of liposome preparation see materials & methods section). The volume-weighted mean diameter of b-galactosidase-loaded liposomes and AnExIL formulations was approximately 1.5 lm. The dose of b-galactosidase was standardized to 800 mU per formulation (see ''Materials and methods''), which corresponds to approximately 2 lg of active b-galactosidase from a commercial source (Sigma). The S30 extract used for IVTT was derived from E. coli BL21 Tuner TM strain, which is devoid of endogenous b-galactosidase. This is important to avoid interference of endogenous b-galactosidase in the experiments (Amidi et al. 2010 ). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of S30 extract made from E-coli Tuner TM strain proved absence of endogenous b-galactosidase in S30 extract (Fig. 2) . Importantly, Western blot analysis confirmed that the expressed b-galactosidase was recognized by polyvalent anti-bgalactosidase antibodies and the antigenicity of b-galactosidase was preserved in IVTT mix (Fig. 2) . Systemic antibody responses after i.m. immunization in mice To investigate the potency of AnExILs as alternatives for conventional protein or DNA vaccines, we compared systemic humoral responses of mice immunized i.m. with AnExIL-IN, AnExIL-ON, pCMV-Lac-Z encapsulated in liposomes (further referred to as liposomal DNA vaccine), b-galactosidase encapsulated in liposomes (further referred to as liposomal protein vaccines) and b-galactosidase coencapsulated with pDNA (pIVEX-Lac-Z) in liposomes (further referred to as liposomal protein/DNA vaccines). The liposomal DNA vaccine was poorly immunogenic and induced very low serum IgG titers in only some of the vaccinated animals after single dose i.m. immunization (Fig. 3a) . In contrast, AnExIL-IN induced high serum antibody responses after i.m. immunization, which were significantly higher than those achieved after i.m. injection of liposomal protein and liposomal protein/DNA vaccines (Fig. 3b) (P \ 0.001). Single i.m. vaccination with AnExIL-ON could elicit substantially higher serum antibody responses than those elicited by other vaccines (Fig. 3a , b) (P \ 0.001). It has been shown that surfacelinked liposomal antigens could enhance presentation of antigens to APCs and induce stronger immune responses (Taneichi et al. 2006a; Naito et al. 1996; Uchida and Taneichi 2008) . Altogether, these results point to strong immunostimulating effects of AnExIL vaccines and robust impact of surface antigen presentation on systemic antibody response. Since there are usually needs for booster vaccinations in order to induce prolonged and strong immune responses, the effect of a booster immunization on the systemic antibody production was studied in mice. After booster immunizations all group of mice showed higher IgG titers but not significantly higher than those after prime immunization (Fig. 3) . To exclude that the observed anti-b-galactosidase serum titers were induced by components within the S30 bacterial extract, serum antibody titers of mice injected with AnExILs without the pDNA encoding b-galactosidase were measured. After i.m. immunizations with pDNAlacking AnExILs, mice showed a negligible b-galactosidase specific antibody response (Fig. 3b) . This clearly indicates that the antigen specific immune response is exclusively mediated by the genetic input. To gain more insight into the nature and quality of the systemic immune response, IgG1 and IgG2a subclasses of b-galactosidase-specific antibodies (Fig. 4a, b) were determined. After i.m. immunizations with liposomal DNA vaccine, there were no detectable levels of IgG1 or IgG2a in the sera of the vaccinated mice. As compared to liposomal protein and protein/DNA vaccines, AnExIL-IN and the AnExIL-ON vaccines showed superior IgG1 (P \ 0.05) and IgG2a (P \ 0.001) responses and those induced by AnExIL-ON was the highest (Fig. 4a, b) . The IgG1 and IgG2a responses of control and tested formulations largely corresponded to the total IgG responses (Fig. 4a, b) . Remarkably, the AnExIL-ON induced significantly higher IgG2a antibody levels (Fig. 4a) and consequently notably higher IgG2a/IgG1 ratios after booster vaccination compared to the other formulations (Fig. 4d) . Sera were collected 14 days after each immunization. Antibody titers are expressed as mean of the responding mice; the bars represent the 95% confidence intervals. The numbers above the columns indicate the number of responders per group. Asterisks indicate titers that are significantly (* P \ 0.05; ** P \ 0.001) higher than those of the group immunized (booster vaccination) with liposomal protein/DNA vaccines. Circles indicate titers that are significantly (Â°P \ 0.05) higher than those of the group immunized (booster vaccination) with AnExIL-IN
