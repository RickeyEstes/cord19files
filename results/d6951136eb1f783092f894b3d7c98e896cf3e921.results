Three hundred dogs were enrolled in this cross-sectional study: one hundred dogs from each of 3 Northern California regional dog parks. The dog parks all had chain link fences, separate small and large dog sections, water spigots with water bowls, light tree cover, free public access, and benches. The 3 parks were approximately 1.5, 2, and 2.5 acres, respectively. One of the parks had artificial turf, whereas the other 2 had natural grass. The 2.5-acre park with grass would occasionally become flooded in the winter season due to poor drainage; however, fecal specimens were not collected from any of the parks during the winter season. The mean AE standard deviation (SD) age was 3.9 AE 3.2 years (range 3 months to 17 years) and differed significantly among dog park groups (P = .049). The mean AE SD ages of dogs attending each of the 3 dog parks were 3.5 AE 3.2 years, 3.5 AE 2.8 years, and 4.5 AE 3.5 years, respectively. The majority of dogs were mixed breed (54%). Forty-nine purebred dog breeds were represented, including Labradors ( , and there were no significant differences in dog breed distributions among the 3 dog parks. All other breeds present had a frequency of 5 or fewer dogs. There were 172 males (57%) and 128 females (43%), and the sex distribution did not differ significantly (P = .056) among parks. Seventy-three of the 266 (27%) scored investigatorfecal specimens were deemed to be diarrheic (fecal score ≥4) on the day of sample collection. One or more enteropathogens were detected in 114 of the 300 dogs (38%), and the prevalence of enteropathogens did not differ significantly among dog parks. There was a significant positive association between the presence and absence of 1 or more enteropathogens and increasing fecal score (P = .0039), and between the number of enteropathogens detected and fecal score (q S = 0.17, P = .0050). Dogs previously diagnosed with intestinal parasites were significantly more likely to have a higher fecal score (P = .038). Age was negatively correlated with the number of different enteropathogens (q S = À0.16, P = .0049) and was also negatively correlated with fecal score (q S = À0.11, P = .066). Risk factors evaluated including access to water in outdoor locations other than the dog park (P = .25), the presence of other household pets having diarrhea (P = .93), contact with dogs outside the household, (P = .58), attendance of the dog at day-care facilities within the previous 6 weeks (P = .29), and frequency of dog park attendance (P = .099) were not significantly associated with fecal score or the presence of enteropathogens. Twenty-six of 300 dogs (8.7%) attended the dog park at least once daily, 51 dogs (17%) attended the dog park 5-7 times weekly, 64 dogs (21%) attended the dog park 3-4 times weekly, 85 dogs (28%) attended the dog park 1-2 times weekly, and 50 dogs (17%) attended the dog park 1-2 times monthly. The frequency with which a dog attended a dog park was not significantly associated with detecting ≥1 enteropathogens (P = .099); however, there was a significant positive correlation between the frequency of dog park visits and increased fecal score (q S = 0.12, P = .047).
