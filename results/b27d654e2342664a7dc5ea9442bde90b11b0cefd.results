Hyperimmune colostrum (Gastrogard-R W ) The hyperimmune colostrum (HIC) is used as a positive control and therefore tested in the antiviral titration assay with MA104 cells in several concentrations ( Figure 1A ). The concentration of 1 μg/ml showed an inhibition of infection with 50% compared to the maximum infection with RRV. The effect of two rotavirus strains on the transepithelial resistance (TER) with Caco-2 cells was first determined. Only the SA-11 rotavirus strain, and not RRV, showed a decrease in TER. An infection of SA-11 resulted also in a progressive increase in the paracellular permeability to HRP (a 40 kD molecule) and FITC-dextran (a 4 kD molecule) in correlation to the time post infection (data not shown). The decline in TER of Caco-2 cells by SA-11 and the effect of the HIC (100 μg/ml) on the TER during SA-11 infection is depicted in Figure 1B . Infection of Caco-2 cells with SA-11 results in a decline of the TER for more than 80%. Infection in the presence of HIC showed a complete maintenance of the TER, comparable to non-infected Caco-2 cells in the presence of HIC.
