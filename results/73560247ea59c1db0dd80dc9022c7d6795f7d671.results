In our biological validation experiment, measured FCM concentrations ranged from 7.1 to 361.6 ng/g feces. Baseline values, calculated for each tested individual as the mean of the FCM levels measured prior to capture, ranged from 24.0 to 48.4 ng/g feces (when several sample were collected from an individual on the same day, the mean daily FCM level was considered in these calculations). In the three individuals, the cortisol EIA detected an increase in FCM concentrations by 440%, 747% and 1041% respectively (absolute peak values between 198.4 and 361.6 ng/g), within 24 to 48 hours of the capture event. Within 48 to 96 hours, this peak was followed by a downward trend towards baseline FCM values, validating the cortisol EIA for the analysis of wolf fecal samples. We analyzed a total of 450 samples from Abruzzo (n = 165), Mercantour (n = 121) and Yellowstone (n = 164). Measured FCM ranged from 1.1 to 397.7 ng/g feces. We defined extreme high values as those beyond the limit of Q3 + 3 x IQ, where Q3 = upper quartile, IQ = interquartile range. Hereafter, these values (> 47.2 ng/g feces) are referred to as 'extreme values'. The limit for extreme low values, Q1-3 x IQ (where Q1 = lower quartile) was zero.
