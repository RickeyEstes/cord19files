Three states contributed insufficient numbers of complete reporting years (<5 over the 10-year study interval) and were excluded from further analyses: Florida (0 complete years), Georgia (1), and Delaware (4) (Fig. 1a) . Only three (4.5%) of Florida's 67 counties and 67 (42.1%) of Georgia's 159 counties ever submitted complete surveillance reports (Fig. 1a) . The final data set contained 713 counties within 16 states and generated 6,072 county-years of complete rabies test reporting (Table 1 ). The number of complete reporting years submitted by a given state ranged from six to ten years; complete reporting from all 16 states occurred only in 1996 ( Fig. 1a and b) . The median number of rabies tests reported per county-year ranged from 0 to 867 (Fig. 2) . The overall median percentage of rabid animals testing positive per county-year was 6.5% (N = 713; Fig. 1c , Table 1 ). Counties reporting no rabies reported the lowest median of seven animals tested for rabies per year (interquartile range [IQR] 5, 15) and a The independent city of Baltimore was omitted, and its reports were assigned to the county of the same name. b The independent cities of Charlottesville, Covington, Emporia, Falls Church, Harrisonburg, Lexington, Manassas, Manassas Park, Martinsville, Norton, Poquoson, Staunton and Winchester had no reports and were omitted. The independent cities of Fairfax, Bedford, Franklin, and Roanoke were omitted, and their reports were assigned to counties of the same names. counties with rabies-but not raccoon-associated rabies-reported a median of 22 (IQR 9, 54) . Counties with raccoon-associated rabies reported significantly more rabid animals, median = 34 (IQR 14, 88), than other counties (Table 2 ). Laboratory counties (N = 31) among 9 of 16 states reported the highest median annual number of 213 (IQR 88, 322) animals tested (Fig. 2 and Table 2 ); the 612 non-laboratory counties reported a significantly lower annual median of 25 (IQR 11, 63, p < 0.01). The median annual percentages of animals testing rabid were indistinguishable between laboratory and non-laboratory counties (6.5% and 6.4%; Table 2 ). Univariate analyses revealed that county human population size accounted for >30% (adjusted p < 0.01 for each state) of total variance in the median number of animal rabies tests reported per county-year within each state; r 2 values exceeded 60% for 12 of 16 states. Similarly, median annual county expenditures within each state accounted for >60% ( p < 0.01) of total variance in the median number of animal rabies tests per county-year for 11 of 16 states. Other covariates accounting for >30% of the variance among rabies tests performed were county human population density, percentage college graduates and percentage of the population below the poverty level. Results from stratified analyses were, with a single exception, completely concordant with state county-level analyses; total county expenditures explained a higher percentage of the variance (33%) among laboratory counties than did human population size (20%). In regional univariate analyses of all 713 counties human population size accounted for 70% of the variance in the animals tested per county-year and total county expenditure accounted for 63% of the variance. The estimated minimum number of humans in a county and minimum threshold of county expenditures required for any animal to be tested for rabies was 1256 persons or $1,256,500 ( Fig. 3a and b) . Multivariable regression models separately assessed the association of human population size and total county expenditures on total animal rabies tests reported per county as colinearity (r = 0.94) precluded their simultaneous inclusion in models. County human population size accounted for 70%-75% of the variance in median number of animals tested per county-year in stratified county analyses and 72% in the regional analysis (Table 3) . Similarly, county expenditures explained 45%-69% variance in stratified county analyses and 67% in the regional analysis (Table 3) . Covariates other than human population size and total county expenditures explained <1.0%-7% of the total variance in multivariable models (Table 3 ). Residual diagnostics indicated that none of the multivariable models violated assumptions of normalcy or variance in the error term, with the exception of the regional model containing county expenditures; as only one outlying county was influential no changes were made in this individual model. The median number of rabid raccoons reported per county-year was significantly correlated (r 2 = 0.54) with the total number of raccoons tested; the ''required'' minimum number of raccoons tested to detect a single rabid raccoon was approximately 2.6. Mapping the locations of the 288 counties testing <2.6 raccoons per year indicated that most of the counties reporting no rabies present or no raccoon-variant associated rabies were outside the known endemic area of raccoon-associated rabies or in states (Maine and New York) at the boundary of the expanding wavefront of the raccoon rabies epidemic in 2001 (Fig. 4a) . However, counties with low annual rates of testing raccoons were also evident within endemic regions of raccoon-associated rabies and were common throughout regions rabies reported, rabies reported but not among raccoons, and no rabies reported. Areas of low reporting and of special interest as sites of oral rabies vaccine (ORV) delivery are circled. (b) Counties reporting >2.6 and 2.6 raccoons tested for rabies, the suggested threshold needed to on average detect a single rabid raccoon. Enlarged circled areas indicate regions with low rabies reporting considered to be at risk for rabies introduction through long distance translocation. immediately adjacent to known epidemic or endemic activity in Ohio, West Virginia, and Alabama (Fig. 4b) .
