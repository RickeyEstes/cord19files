151 dogs infected with rabies were reported in Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic between the 6th January 2003 and the 6th March 2012. Of these, 123 cases had a date of report available, as well as a geographical location and viral genome sequences (Fig 2) . Pairwise distances between these 123 cases are shown in Fig 3, separately for temporal, spatial, and genetic distances. The distribution of spatial distances was unimodal, with an average pairwise The top left panel shows the incidence of reported cases of rabies over time, by date of report; cases identified as belonging to the same outbreak cluster (using all distances) are shown in the same colour (grey indicates singletons). The top right panel shows the geographic distance of 3.9km. In contrast, the distribution of temporal distances exhibited two peaks, one at very short time differences, and one around 4 years, likely driven by the multiple peaks in the observed incidence time series (see Fig 2) . The distribution of genetic distances was multimodal (as expected from the phylogeny in Fig 2) , with a main mode at 4 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), and the presence of distinct lineages shown by some sequences differing by over 700 SNPs. Fig 3 shows , overlaid onto the observed pairwise distances, the distributions for the expected distances (in time, space or genetic) between a case and its closest observed ancestor based on the literature and given an assumed reporting rate of 20% [39] . The equivalent distributions with no underreporting, i.e. the distributions of expected distances between a case of rabies and its infector are shown in S1 Fig. Based on these input distributions, we defined cutoffs for each data stream corresponding to the 95% quantiles (90 and 98% quantiles were also considered in sensitivity analyses, see S1 Text). The observed temporal, geographic, and genetic distances were combined with the input cutoffs to produce pruned graphs for each data stream (Fig 4A-4C ). These graphs were in turn intersected to produce the final graph whose connected components are clusters of cases connected in all dimensions, therefore representing cases likely linked by transmission ( Fig 4D) . Interestingly, the clusters identified in the final graph ( Fig 4D) could not be revealed by any data stream alone (Fig 4A-4C) , which illustrates the value of integrating all data streams to identify outbreak clusters. The temporal data alone identified only three clusters of size 2, 23 and 98 respectively; the spatial data could not distinguish any separate introductions; finally, the genetic data led to 9 singletons, three pairs, and three larger clusters of size 7, 17 and 84 respectively. Using all data streams together, a total of 23 distinct clusters were identified, including 16 singletons, two pairs and 5 larger clusters containing respectively 5, 6, 8, 9, and 75 observed cases. These clusters are overlaid on the original data in Fig 2. Importantly, the fact that spatial data alone did not identify any cluster does not mean that this data contained no information on potential clusters. In fact, spatial data was useful in combination with temporal and genetic information, allowing to disentangle outbreak clusters which were otherwise seen as a single outbreak when considering temporal and genetic data only. For a given reporting rate, the size of outbreak clusters contains information on transmissibility, as measured by the reproduction number (R). Intuitively, low values of R will result in many sporadic cases, imported from outside of the reporting area but without subsequent transmission, while higher values of R would result in a smaller number of larger clusters. Using the distribution of the cluster sizes (Fig 4D) , we were able to estimate R as well as the number of unobserved outbreak clusters, which we translated into a rate of importation of rabies into the population over the monitored time period. The estimated reproduction number was 0.92 (95% confidence interval CI 95% : [0.85; 1.01]) and the estimated rate of importation of rabies into the population was 4.91 (CI 95% : [3.60; 6.65]) importations per year (see Table 1 ). The results presented above were obtained by assuming a reporting rate of 20%, and using a cutoff corresponding to the 95% quantile of the input distance distributions at the pruning step. We explored the extent to which results were affected by changes in these assumptions in sensitivity analyses presented in S1 Text, where reporting rates of 10%, 20% and 50%, and locations of the reported cases using the same colour coding as the incidence panel. The bottom panel shows the unrooted phylogeny obtained by Neighbour-Joining on Hamming distances (i.e. number of different nucleotides) between sampled sequences; the full tree showing two distinct strains more than 700 nucleotides apart is plotted on the left. Details of the two clades are provided in inset A) and B). A reporting rate of 20% was assumed, and pruning cutoff distances corresponding to the 95% quantiles of the input distance distributions were used (see S1 Text for sensitivity analyses on these assumptions). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006554.g002 Distribution of pairwise temporal (top), spatial (middle) and genetic (bottom) distances for rabies in Bangui. The temporal distance is defined as the time between reporting of the cases. The spatial distance is defined as the Euclidean distance between the geographic locations of cases. The genetic distance is defined as the Hamming distance between the sequenced isolates. The grey histograms show the observed pairwise distances between any two cases reported in Bangui. The solid black lines show the input distribution of distances between a case and its closest observed ancestor, given an assumed reporting rate of 20% (see S1 Text for sensitivity analyses to this assumption). Distributions have been rescaled to fit on the same graph as the histograms. The red vertical lines show the cutoffs corresponding to the 95% quantiles of these distributions. For a given data stream and a given choice of cutoff, pairs of cases with observed distance above the cutoff are considered not connected, and the corresponding graph edges are removed at the pruning step (see Fig 1) . https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006554.g003 cutoffs corresponding to the 90%, 95% and 98% quantiles were considered. Lower reporting rates and higher quantiles generally led to fewer, larger clusters (S3-S6 Figs). The number of Pruned (A-C) and final graph (D) used to define clusters of cases in the rabies outbreak, obtained using A) only temporal distances, B) only spatial distances, C) only genetic distances and D) all three combined. Nodes represent cases, and edges potential epidemiological links, according to the corresponding data. The inner colours of the nodes indicate the final clusters obtained by combining all data streams (D), whilst the outer colours correspond to the clusters obtained using one data stream at a time. Grey indicates singletons. A reporting rate of 20% was assumed, and pruning cutoff distances corresponding to the 95% quantiles of the input distance distributions were used (see S1 Text for sensitivity analyses on these assumptions). In each graph, the transparency of the vertices was adjusted according to the number of vertices in the graph, with more transparency in graphs with more vertices, to improve readability. More detailed results of these sensitivity analyses are presented in S1 Text. We have illustrated our method by applying it retrospectively to the data on dog rabies in Central African Republic. However, our method would also be extremely useful in real-time for disentangling clusters of related cases from isolated cases due to separate introductions of the pathogen into the population. Indeed, this could have a direct impact on control policies, providing information in real time on whether to prioritise control measures aiming at reducing transmission or at reducing importations (or both). In S1 Text, we present a sensitivity analysis where our method is applied to the rabies dataset at two intermediate time points, as well as at the end. We show that our method is robust to application in real-time, with very few differences between the allocation of cases to different clusters in real-time and retrospectively (see S1 Text for detailed results). We also performed a simulation study to assess the extent to which our method was able to correctly identify clusters of cases linked by transmission and accurately estimate the underlying reproduction number and reporting rate. Results are presented in Fig 5. Our method performed generally very well, but the cutoff choice affected the results dramatically. In our main analysis of simulated datasets aiming to reproduce the Bangui epidemiological situation, the mean sensitivity (measured as the True Positive Rate, TPR, see materials and method) was 99.3% with a mean specificity (measured as the True Negative Rate, TNR) of 99.7%. The corresponding median relative error in the estimated parameters was low, at -2.5% for the reproduction number and -0.8% for the importation rate (see S1 Text for more results). These results were obtained assuming the same reporting rate as in the simulation, and with a cutoff corresponding to the 95% quantile of the input distributions. Using higher quantiles generally led to a higher sensitivity, but a lower specificity. The average between sensitivity and specificity was very high for all but the highest cutoff considered (99.9% quantile), and was maximal for the 95% quantile (S12 and S13 Figs). Misspecifying the reporting rate led to lower performances: underestimating and overestimating the reporting rate were associated respectively with lower specificity and lower sensitivity (Fig 5A) . In other simulation scenarios with different reporting rates, using the 95% quantile for pruning led to good although slightly poorer performance, with a mean average between sensitivity and specificity greater than 82%. Varying the degree of diversity in the pathogen sequences of the imported cases didn't affect much Table 1 . Estimates of the reproduction number (R) and rate of importation of rabies into the canine population (total and unobserved). The rate of importation was defined as the estimated number of outbreaks per unit of time over the whole study period. The rate of unobserved importation was defined as the estimated number of unobserved outbreaks per unit of time over the whole study period. A reporting rate of 20% was assumed, and pruning cutoff distances corresponding to the 95% quantiles of the input distance distributions were used (see S1 Text for sensitivity analyses on these assumptions).
