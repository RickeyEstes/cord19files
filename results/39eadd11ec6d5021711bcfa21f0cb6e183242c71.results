MARV and EBOV GP 1,2 -mediated entry is restricted by IFITM1, 2, and 3 The IFITM proteins restrict IAV HA-mediated entry, and an early stage in the replication of several flaviviruses [1] . The entry process of each of these viruses is pH dependent. We sought to determine if additional viruses that require access to late endocytic or lysosomal compartments were similarly restricted by these proteins. The entry processes of MARV and EBOV require activation by one or more cathepsins, whose activity is localized to lysosomes [10, 12, 13, 17] . Both EBOV and MARV require cathepsin L activity to infect cells, whereas EBOV also requires cathepsin B activity [10, 12, 13] . Accordingly, we incubated MLVbased pseudoviruses bearing the entry proteins of MARV, EBOV, H5 or H7 IAV, MLV, or MACV with A549 lung epithelial cells transduced to express human IFITM1, 2 or 3, or with vector alone [18, 19, 20] . As we have previously reported [1] , infection mediated by the entry proteins of MLV or MACV was unaffected by the presence of IFITM proteins (Fig. 1A) , despite their efficient expression (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, as reported, IAV HA-mediated entry was markedly inhibited by the same proteins. Similarly, we observed that entry mediated by MARV and EBOV GP 1,2 proteins was inhibited by IFITM1, 2 and 3 (Figs. 1A and S1A). Comparable results were obtained in Vero E6 cells, an African green monkey kidney epithelial cell line and the standard cell line for laboratory propagation of these viruses (Figs. 1C and D), and for human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), a primary cell target of filovirus infection (Figs. 1E and F). We have repeatedly observed that IFITM-mediated restriction is less efficient in human embryonic kidney 293T cells. Consistent with this observation, both IAV HA-and filovirus GP 1,2 -mediated entry were only partially suppressed in these cells, whereas control pseudoviruses remained unaffected (Figs. 1G and H). Our data indicate that IFITM1, 2, and 3 each restrict MARV and EBOV GP 1,2 -mediated entry, and identify cell-type differences in the efficiency of restriction. We speculate that these differences arise from expression differences of necessary restriction cofactors or proteins that interfere with IFITM protein activity.
