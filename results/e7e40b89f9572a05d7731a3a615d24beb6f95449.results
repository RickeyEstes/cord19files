The cDNA hybridization probe reacted equally with infected cell culture supernates of all cytopathic strains (72, Auburn, NADL, Singer, Oregon C24V) and non-cytopathic strains (2724, 7443, New York-l, TGAN, and NEB) tested. Previously, as little as 10-20 pg of purified BVDV RNA resulted in detectable hybridization signals with the hybridization probe used in this study (Brock et al., 1988) . To determine the minimum detection level of BVDV in serum, serial tenfold dilutions of BVDV infected cell culture supernatant (105 CCIDso/ml) were made in BVDV negative, fetal bovine serum. Virus was detected by dot blot hybridization assay to minimum level at a 10 -4 dilution in the serum. A total of 141 serum samples from different calves were tested and 55 ( 39%) of these samples were positive by dot blot hybridization for BVDV RNA. An autoradiograph of a hybridized dot blot membrane filter containing 22 test samples is shown in Fig. 1 . Virus isolation was attempted on the first 30 samples collected in addition to dot blot hybridization assay. BVDV was present in 8 of the 30 samples determined positive by dot blot hybridization assay ( Table 1 ) . Virus was isolated from three of the 30 samples. One of the serum samples from which virus was isolated was negative for BVDV by dot blot hybridization assay. Serum antibody levels of the eight dot blot hybridization positive samples ranged from < 1:40 to 1 : 160 (Table 1 ) . Serum from eight calves (33%) out of 24, tested 3 to 4 weeks later, remained positive for BVDV RNA. Results from the dot blot hybridization assay were available within 36 to 48 h.
