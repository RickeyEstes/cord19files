Of the articles and planning documents/reports screened, 41 references were deemed relevant. These included 22 journal articles, 1 book chapter, and 18 published reports, regulatory standards, and/or planning documents. There was significant overlap among these sources when summarizing the infection prevention issues that should be addressed by a home health emergency management plan. Common infection prevention issues mentioned included having policies and procedures related to infection prevention, preparing for a surge in potentially contagious patients, screening patients for communicable diseases, and educating patients and family members on infection prevention practices. Differences identified by the sources tended to be related to the types of appropriate infection prevention interventions that should be implemented, such as instituting isolation in the home, 6, 8, 10, 15, 17, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] screening staff for illness before each shift, 6, 17, 28 or having home care staff deliver infection prevention supplies to patients. 29 No single document or article identified all of the infection prevention issues that should be addressed by a plan. Table 1 presents the complete list of the infection prevention issues that should be addressed in a plan categorized by themes, or domains. Home health agency disaster planners can use this table as an assessment tool for evaluating their plans and developing policies and procedures aimed at decreasing the risk of infection transmission during an MCE. It is important to note that the information provided in this article consists of compiled published recommendations that are not considered mandates or regulations, except for the Joint Commission standards for accredited home health agencies. 30 Domain 1: Home health agency emergency management plan and biological annex A home health agency emergency management plan needs to address all biological threats, including bioterrorism, outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, and pandemics. The plan must be updated regularly based on lessons learned from disaster exercises, actual events, and published evidence of best practices. The plan needs to be coordinated with local, state, and federal plans, and contact names and information for key response agencies need to be included. Lists of contact names and information should be evaluated and updated regularly to ensure accuracy. The plan's biological annex needs to define how biological events are different from other types of MCEs, how interventions will be stratified by pandemic stage/phase or nature of the biological attack, and the epidemiologic clues of a potential biological event.
