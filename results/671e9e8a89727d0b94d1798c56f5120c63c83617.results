Detection and genotyping of SAFV in three cohorts of patients. A total of 6052 patients (1647, 2013, and 2392 patients in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were recruited into the study, 3810 (62.9%) of which were boys. Ages ranged from 26 days to 14 years (median, 12 months). More boys were included in cohort 1 (P 5 0.044), and older age was presented in cohort 3 (P ,0.001) ( Table 1 ). Among all the tested patients, 115 (1.9%) were SAFV-positive, [17 (1.0%), 12 (0.6%), and 86 (3.6%) from cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively (Table 1) ]. A significantly higher detection rate was found in HFMD patients among the three cohorts (P ,0.001). A total of 911 specimens (352 throat swab, 423 sera, and 136 stools) were collected from asymptomatic children. The age ranged from 4 months to 78 months (median, 29 months), and 553 (60.7%) were boys. No positive detection was found in any type of samples from asymptomatic children. From the 115 SAFV-positive patients, 82 patients were successfully sequenced for VP1 nucleotide sequences, and four genotypes were identified: SAFV-1 (8, 9.8%), SAFV-2 (41, 50.0%), SAFV-3 (29, 35.4%), and SAFV-6 (4, 4.9%). For cohort 1, the SAFV determined from 13 of the 17 positive patients were successfully grouped into three genotypes: SAFV-1 (3, 23.1%), SAFV-2 (9, 69.2%), and SAFV-3 (1, 7.7%). In cohort 2, nine of the 12 detected SAFV were assigned to two genotypes: SAFV-2 (4, 44.4%) and SAFV-3 (5, 55.6%). In cohort 3, 60 of the 86 SAFV-positive patients were successfully sequenced, and four genotypes were identified: SAFV-1 (5, 8.3%), SAFV-2 (28, 46.7%), SAFV-3 (23, 38.3%), and SAFV-6 (4, 6.7%). The uncommonly seen SAFV-6 was only found in the HFMD patients (Table 1) . Co-detections with other viruses were found in 70.4% (81/115) of the SAFV-positive patients, including 77 co-detections with one virus, three with two viruses, and one with three viruses. The patients with SAFV single infection had a median age of 20 months (range, 9 months-108 months), and 13 (70.6%) were boys, which were comparable with codetection patients (all P. 0.05). Three cohorts had comparable codetection rates (82.4%, 75.0%, and 67.4%, P 5 0.459) ( Table 1 ). In cohort 1, the most frequent co-detection occurred between SAFV and PIV (5 patients), followed by SAFV and RSV-B (4), HAdV (2), HBoV (2), COV (2), influenza virus A (1), influenza virus B (1), and HRV-A (1). In cohort 2, nine patients were found to have co-detections, including co-detection with norovirus GII (6), rotavirus group A (2), and HAdV (2). In cohort 3, 58 patients were found to have co-detection of SAFV with EV71 (23), CVA16 (17), and other EVs (18) . Demographic and clinical characteristics of the SAFV-positive patients. The median age of the SAFV-positive patients was 24 months, and ranged from two months to 108 months. Of these patients, 70.4% were males. In cohort 1, the SAFV-positive patients were significantly older than the SAFV-negative patients (36.0 months vs. 9.0 months, P ,0.001; Table 2 ). The infection rate increased significantly with age among children below 6 years old (Cochran-Armitage trend 5 25.21, P ,0.001). The highest positive rate (4.3%) was found in 4-to 5-year-old patients (Supplemental Table 1 ). In cohorts 2 and 3, the age and gender profiles were highly comparable between the SAFV-positive and SAFV-negative patients (all P. 0.05). In cohort 1, seven (41.2%) of the SAFV-positive patients, which is significantly higher than that of the SAFV-negative patients (41.2% vs. 14.2%, P 5 0.002), developed asthma that were related with this disease episode. By contrast, the opposite trend was found for pneumonia (47.1% vs. 73.4%, P 5 0.015). Other clinical manifestations were highly comparable between SAFV-positive and SAFV-negative patients (all P. 0.05). In cohort 2, the diarrhea duration was comparable between SAFV-positive and SAFVnegative patients. No SAFV-positive patients exhibited symptoms of vomiting, but 928 (46.3%) SAFV-negative patients did (P 5 0.009). Within cohort 3, the severe HFMD patients had significantly higher SAFV-positive rate than the mild HFMD patients (5.2% vs. 2.6%, P 5 0.001). Furthermore, SAFV-positive patients presented with significantly higher frequency of nervous system manifestation than the SAFV-negative patients (52.3% vs. 37.1%, P 5 0.004). For all three cohorts, the clinical manifestations of patients with SAFV single detection were insignificantly different from those with SAFV co-detection ( Table 2 ). We additionally analyzed whether the co-detection of SAFV might aggravate the clinical outcome of EV infected HFMD patients ( Table 3 ). The results demonstrated that 18 out of 23 (78.3%) SAFV/EV71 co-detected patients developed severe HFMD, significantly higher than that of patients with EV71 single detection (78.3% vs. 42.6%, P 5 0.001). By contrast, there was no significant difference between patients with CVA16 single detection and patients with SAFV/CVA16 co-detection (P. 0.05). Similarly, no difference was attained for other EVs co-detected patients either. Genetic characterization of SAFVs. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the VP1 nucleotide sequences of Saffold cardiovirus detected in clinical samples of 82 patients in the current study, and sequences downloaded from GenBank by maximum likelihood method using MEGA 6.0 (Figure 1) . A spatial pattern of the genetic clustering was identified for each genotype. For SAFV-1, four lineages were formed, and all the Chinese strains were grouped into one lineage (Figure 2A ). For the Chinese lineage, an obvious geographic-specific distribution was observed, with strains from three locations grouped separately into three sublineages. All the SAFV-1 cases from the current study were grouped into the Chongqing sublineage, regardless of the cohort group. In SAFV-2, five lineages were constructed, which included European, North American, Middle-Eastern, Japanese, and East Asian lineages ( Figure 2B ). The strains from the present study were grouped into East Asian lineage, which, however, diverged from those from Beijing or Thai strains. In SAFV-3, six lineages were formed depending on the geographical origin. The Chongqing strains in this study were classified into the Asian lineages, forming a sublineage that was distinct from the strains of other regions ( Figure 2C ). In SAFV-6, the strains from three locations were classified into three clusters. The Chongqing strains formed a separate cluster, which is different from those of Japanese and Pakistani strains ( Figure 2D ). Detection of SAFV in sera and CSFs. Additional 171 CSFs were collected from patients with HFMD-associated encephalitis, and six (3.5%) were found to be SAFV-positive using real-time RT-PCR, and five were further confirmed by nested RT-PCR targeting the 59-UTR. Two of six SAFV-positive CSFs were successfully sequenced for VP1, and only SAFV-3 was identified. Among 760 serum samples collected from HFMD patients (355 from mild HFMD patients and 328 from severe HFMD patients), eight HFMD patients (1.1%) were detected positive for SAFV, including seven patients with encephalitis and one patient with myocarditis. Among 328 sera from severe HFMD patients, 322 were collected from patients with HFMD-associated encephalitis, and seven (2.2%) were found to be SAFV-positive using real-time RT-PCR, and five were further confirmed by nested RT-PCR targeting the 59-UTR. Two out of eight SAFV-positive sera were successfully identified to be SAFV-2 and all from patients with HFMD-associated encephalitis. From three of the six SAFV-positive CSFs and four of eight SAFVpositive sera, no HEV was detected.
