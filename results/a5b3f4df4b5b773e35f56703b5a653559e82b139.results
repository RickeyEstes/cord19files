Network reconstruction and estimated R c values. Between 2010 and the first two months of 2016, a total of 91 cases of malaria were confirmed by microscopy in El Salvador, of which 30 were classified as imported. There were a total of six cases of P. falciparum, all of which were imported. Our estimated transmission network is shown in Fig. 1 . Overall, the temporal dimension, informed by the prior distribution for the serial interval (Fig. 1a) , dominates the identification of infector-infectee pairs (Fig. 1b) . We identified two locally acquired cases which could not be plausibly linked to other cases within the dataset (Fig. 1c) . These were estimated in periods in which a clear gap in the data was apparent, and may therefore represent unidentified importations, relapse cases or unreported locally acquired sources of infection. We estimated the mean individual reproduction number over 2010-2016 to be 0.61 (95% CI = 0.56,0.65). This is consistent with the ratio of locally acquired to total cases (61:91 = 0.66), which has been proposed elsewhere as an approximate estimate of R c 2 . When fitting a generalised additive model (GAM) to the data, the overall trend was a decline from a fitted R c of 0.73 at the start of the observation to 0.47 by the end of the period (Fig. 2) . Individual reproduction numbers showed seasonal fluctuations through time, with regular peaks observed in December, which coincides with the end of harvest season for many crops in El Salvador and Guatemala, and August, which coincides with a period of national holiday and the end of the rainy season. Spatial distribution of cases and R c . Data were highly focal, with 70% of cases originating from two adjacent administrative departments neighbouring Guatemala, and 32% of cases originating from just two municipalities within these regions (Jujutla and Acajutla) (Fig. 3a, b) . This pattern was also reflected in the spatial distribution of R c . While most areas of the country are predicted to have a low risk of R c reaching above one over the time observed, several regions have a much higher predicted risk of R c > 1 (Fig. 3c ). In these regions, the majority of cases imported into the region could be expected to result in at least one onward transmission event. However it is important to note that uncertainty in these predictions is high in areas where we have not seen cases. The area where we have the least uncertainty in our estimate, around the borders of Guatemala, suggest that most cases occurring there did not contribute to onward transmission. Impact of imported cases on transmission. The mean marginal gain to the likelihood of including infections from imported cases into the constructed transmission networks was much higher than including locally acquired cases (0.081 compared to 3.44e âˆ’7 ), suggesting that imported cases are a major driver of transmission. Visual inspection of the most likely chains of transmission ( Fig. 1c ) also are suggestive of this, where the index case in a cluster of linked cases was almost always an imported case. Endgame predictions based on R c and stochasticity. To investigate potential timelines to elimination (i.e., the absence of local transmission) we characterised heterogeneity in the reproduction number using a Gamma distribution which, when fitted to the data, suggests a threshold mean R c of 0.22, below which there would a <5% chance of any individual reproduction number exceeding one. Using our fitted trend in the mean R c , we expect this level to be reached by 2023, assuming no change in the rate of importation (Fig. 2c ).
