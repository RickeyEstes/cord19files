We identified 54 studies about SARS or coronavirus and we included 19 studies only. We excluded 35 studies since 14 of them were in vitro studies, 15 corticosteroid studies, and 6 were nontherapeutic studies. Overall, we analyzed 19 studies, nine used ribavirin alone or with interferon (Table 1) [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , two used lopinavir and ritonavir (Table 2) 17, 18 , six used convalescent plasma (Table 3) [19] [20] [21] [22] , there was one study of Interferon alpha (Table 4) 23 and one study comparing Interferon alpha versus ribavirin 13 . Summaries of the different studies are presented in Tables 1-4.
