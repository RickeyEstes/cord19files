Between January 2013 and May 2014, a total of 41 patients with community-acquired pneumonia were included. After the empirical start of antibiotic treatment in all study patients, 17 of them were found to have pneumococcal pneumonia. Of these 17 patients, 13 were in the intervention group and 4 were in the control group. In these 13 patients, 10 completed the 48 h (four dosages) of rifampicin treatment, 2 received three dosages and 1 received two dosages. The median number of infected lobes was one. The median age of the total cohort was 69 years, 58% were male and the median CURB-65 score was 2 (Table 1) . Twenty-six patients received ciprofloxacin as empirical treatment on top of a b-lactam antibiotic with or without rifampicin. Since groups are small, some differences exist between the treatment groups. Baseline characteristics are outlined in Table 1 [and Table S1 (available as Supplementary data at JAC Online)]. The diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia in the 17 patients was based on positive blood cultures in 5 patients, positive sputum cultures in 6 patients, positive BinaxNOW antigen test in 9 patients and a positive IMIA test in 10 patients. Various S. pneumoniae serotypes were detected. Interestingly, two patients had an infection involving more than one serotype (Table S2) .
