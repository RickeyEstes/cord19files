A total of 229 H1N1 influenza positive samples and 267 H1N1 negative samples were screened for the presence of common respiratory viruses. Influenza samples originated from 133 (58.0%) adults (age> Z 18 yrs) and 96 (42.0%) children (age < 18 yrs) with a median age of 20.3 yrs. Thirty (13.1%) influenza samples screened positive for the presence of 31 viral copathogens including 19 (61.3%) rhinovirus, 5 (16.1%) coronaviruses, 2 (6.4%) adenovirus, 2 (6.4%) human parainfluenza type 2 (HPIV2), and 1 (3.2%) each for WU polyomavirus, HPIV1 and RSV (Table 1) . One pediatric patient was identified having co-infection with both HPIV2 and coronavirus HKU1 in addition to influenza. Neither hMPV nor HCoV NL63 were detected. With the exception of RSV and HIPV1, The proportion of patients positive for all tested viruses was similar for patients with and without influenza H1N1 infection. Median age for coinfected individuals was 19.2 yrs and included 17 adults (median age 37.7 yrs) and 13 children (median age 7.4 yrs). More adults had rhinovirus co-infection than children (12 vs. 7 respectively). Charts for 196 (98.0%) monoinfected and 30 (100%) coinfected patients were available for chart review and clinical severity was calculated. Median clinical severity of both monoinfected and coinfected groups were 1 (Table 2) . However, influenza patients coinfected with rhinovirus tended to have lower clinical severity (median 0), whereas non-rhinovirus co-infections had substantially higher clinical severity (median 2). As a group, coinfected individuals had a higher proportion of severe disease (CSS > 3) compared to influenza monoinection (26.7% vs 11.2%, P < 0.05), the majority of which is derived from non-rhinovirus co-infections (62.5%). Coinfected adults and children had severe disease at similar rates (29.4% vs 23.0%). The majority of influenza monoinfected patients with severe disease were adults (17, 15 .2%) compared with only 5 (6.0%) children. Influenza patients with rhinovirus co-infection tended to have less admission to the hospital (52.6% vs. 69.8%) and oxygen use (21.1% vs. 31.0%) ( Table 3) . Non-rhinovirus coinfections had significantly higher ventilator use (45.5% vs. 8.5%) and severe hypoxia (36.4% vs. 9.0%) compared to influenza monoinfected patients (P < 0.05). Coronavirus co-infection had a surprisingly high CSS (Median 4) with 80% being admitted to the hospital and requiring oxygen use as well as 60% requiring mechanical ventilation. Influenza viral load was calculated by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1 ). No significant difference in mean viral load was observed between coinfected or monoinfected groups (P Z 0.36). Influenza titer originating from samples coinfected with rhinovirus was similar to influenza samples coinfected with other viruses.
