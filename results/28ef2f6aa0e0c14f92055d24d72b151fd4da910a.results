Sequence requirements for IBV frameshifting in E. coli The ef®ciency of frameshift signals of the IBV type in the eukaryotic rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) in vitro translation system has been shown to be in¯uenced by the nature of the slippery sequence, the integrity of the downstream RNA structure and the precise spacing between the two elements (Brierley et al., 1991 (Brierley et al., , 1992 . We began by con®rming that these requirements were maintained in E. coli. Complementary DNAs (cDNAs) containing variants of the IBV signal were subcloned (see Materials and Methods) into the E. coli expression vector pET3xc (Studier et al., 1990) to create the pMM series of plasmids (see Figure 1 ). pET3xc contains the ®rst 783 bp of coding sequence of the bacteriophage T7 gene 10,¯anked by a T7 promoter and transcription termination signal. In E. coli BL21 cells, which contain an IPTG-inducible T7 RNA polymerase, a 261 amino acid residue portion of gene 10 is expressed from pET3xc as an abundant, Triton-insoluble product that is relatively easy to purify (see Materials and Methods). In the pMM plasmids, the IBV cDNAs were cloned in frame with and downstream of the gene 10 sequence of pET3xc at a unique BamHI site. In BL21 cells, these constructs were predicted to express a 33 kDa non-frameshifted product corresponding to ribosomes that terminated at the IBV 1a stop codon and a 50 kDa frameshift product from ribosomes which frameshifted prior to encountering the stop codon and continued to translate the 1b ORF in the À1 frame. The constructs tested are shown in Figure 2 , the expressions in Figure 3 and the results are summarised in Table 2 . For the pET3xc plasmid, which does not contain an IBV insertion, only two major species were present, the N-terminal portion of gene 10, with an apparent molecular mass of about 34 kDa and lysozyme, carried over from the puri®cation procedure (see Materials and Methods). For the pMM expressions, three species were seen; lysozyme, a 36 kDa species corresponding to the non-frameshifted product and for most constructs, a 50 kDa frameshift product. The identity of the 36 kDa and 50 kDa proteins was con®rmed by demonstrating that both proteins reacted in Western blots with a monoclonal antibody directed against the N terminus of gene 10 (AMS Biotechnology Ltd, Europe; data not shown). We also con®rmed that the 36 kDa and 50 kDa proteins were restricted to the insoluble fraction of E. coli cell extracts; no soluble non-frameshifted or frameshifted protein was detected (data not shown). Figure 1 . The basic plasmids used in this study, the pMM series, were prepared by subcloning 585 bp NheI-EcoRI fragments containing the IBV frameshift region from plasmids pFS7, pFS8 or mutant derivatives (Brierley et al., 1989 (Brierley et al., , 1991 into BamHI-cleaved, plasmid pET3xc (Studier et al., 1990) . Both fragment(s) and vector were end-®lled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I prior to ligation with T4 DNA ligase. The resulting plasmids contain the IBV ORF 1a/1b frameshift signal (sequence information from base-pairs 12,286 to 12,511; Boursnell et al., 1987) ¯anked by portions of the in¯uenza A/PR8/34 PB1 gene (sequence information from base-pairs 1140 to 1167 (5 H ) and 1167 to 1500 (3 H ); Young et al., 1983 ) located downstream of, and in frame with, the ®rst 783 bp of coding sequence of the bacteriophage T7 gene 10. The ensemble is under the control of the bacteriophage T7 promoter and a T7 transcription termination signal is present at the end of the coding sequences. In the relevant T7-expressing bacteria (see Materials and Methods), the constructs are predicted to express a 33 kDa non-frameshifted product, corresponding to ribosomes that terminate at the IBV 1a stop codon and a 50 kDa frameshift product from ribosomes that frameshift prior to encountering the stop codon and continue to translate the 1b ORF in the À1 frame. Figure 2. Frameshift constructs tested in E. coli. A, Slippery sequence variants. In each construct, the slippery sequence is boxed. Nucleotides that differ from the wild-type sequence (pMM2) are indicated in bold. In pMM10 and pMM11, the distance between the slippery sequence and RNA pseudoknot was decreased (GGG deleted) or increased (UAC inserted) by 3 nt, respectively. In pMM6 and pMM5, the pseudoknot was deleted (as in construct pFS7.6; Brierley et al., 1989) . B, Pseudoknot variants. Complementary and compensatory changes were created within the pseudoknot region. In this representation of the pseudoknot, the stems are arranged vertically and the loops are shown as thick lines. For each base-pair(s) studied, the two complementary changes (no base-pairing) and the compensatory change (base-pairing restored) are boxed and labelled with a mutant number. C. Stem ±loop constructs tested. Two constructs were tested that formed a stem± loop structure rather than a pseudoknot. Plasmid pMM23 forms only stem 1 due to a deletion that removed the downstream pseudoknot-forming region (as in construct pFS7.6; Brierley et al., 1989) . Plasmid pMM7 is a stem±loop construct in which the stem nucleotides are of the same length and nucleotide composition as the stacked stems of the pseudoknot in pMM2 (as in construct pFS8.26; Brierley et al., 1991) .
