Eleven hospitals participated in the pilot study selected through stratified random sampling of the volunteers. There were three level A and eight level B teaching hospitals. The level A teaching hospitals are all tertiary care medical centers. Of the roughly 100 teaching hospitals, about 20 were level A teaching hospitals. Geographical distribution was taken into account; the three medical centers were in northern, central and southern Taiwan. As to the level B teaching hospitals, three are from the northern region, three from the center and two from the south. Pass and fail is assessed on a standard-by-standard basis. The overall pass rate was 89.1%. Investigators then looked at the pass rate for each category and each standard ( Table  1 ). For category one--educational resources--the pass rate was 91.8% and for 12 of 20 items, 100% passing was achieved. The lowest pass rate was 45.5% for standard 1.1.5: All training plans of resident doctors and medical students should have a qualified program director. For category two teaching and training plans and outcomes, the pass rate was 91.6% and 100% passing was achieved for 21 standards (out of 42 items). The lowest pass rate was 54.6% for standard 2.2.11: The average overall pass rate for internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics board exams for the past three years was above 80%. For category three, research and results, the pass rate was 78.8% and 100% passing was achieved for four standards (out of nine items). This category had the lowest overall pass rate of the six categories. The lowest pass rate was 54.6% for two standards: 3.2.2 stipulating that physicians should have good research results, and 3.2.3 stating that the execution and results of paramedicals' research must be good. For category four, development of faculty and continuing education, the pass rate was 84.1% and 100% passing was achieved for three standards (of eight items). The lowest pass rate was 63.6% for two standards: 4.1.1, requiring a faculty development system for physicians, which is effectively operational, and 4.1.4, teaching incentives for paramedicals should be clearly promulgated and executed fully so as to encourage dedication to teaching activities. For category 5, academic exchanges and the roles and function of the hospital in the community, the pass rate was 94.4% and 100% passing was achieved for six standards (out of eight items). This category had the highest overall pass rate of the six categories. The lowest pass rate, 63.6%, was for standard 5.2.2: participating in international medical aid and disaster relief and assisting in establishing systems and personnel training. For category 6, administration, the pass rate was 80.7% and 100% passing was achieved for only one of eight standard items. The lowest pass rate was 54.6% for standard 6.3.1, mandating separate funding for teaching, research and advanced study, which could be supported by budgeting and final accounting data, and appropriate proportionate allocation (including physicians and paramedicals). After post-test revision, although there are still 6 categories, some of the category titles and 16 standards were modified. There are finally 95 remaining standards ( Table  2 ). The whole set therefore consists of 6 categories and 95 standards. The final version includes specifically educational resources (20 items), teaching and training plans and outcomes (42 items), research and results (9 items), development of clinical faculty and continuing education (8 items), academic exchanges and community education (8 items), and administration (8 items).
