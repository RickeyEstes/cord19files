We studied a total of 583,000 deaths and 18.9 million hospitalizations recorded from 1 January 1998 through 9 June 2013, with the population of Hong Kong increasing from 6.52 million persons in 1998 to 7.18 million in 2013. During the study period of 15.5 years, influenza viruses circulated for prolonged periods in most years, with two distinct epidemics in some years such as 2000, 2003 and 2008, and prolonged epidemics in other years such as 2002 and 2004 (Fig. 1) . Using regression analysis, we estimated that influenza was associated with 6.27 (95% credibility interval (CrI): 5.21, 7.32) excess respiratory deaths per 100,000 persons per year, and 184 (95% CrI: 170, 199) excess respiratory hospitalizations per 100,000 persons per year (Table 1) . This corresponded to an average of 431 (95% CrI: 358, 503) excess respiratory deaths per year and an average of 12,700 (95% CrI: 11,700, 13,700) excess respiratory hospitalizations per year, which were 1.14% (85% CrI: 0.95%, 1.34%) of all deaths and 1.04% (95% CrI: 0.96%, 1.12%) of all hospitalizations over the study period, respectively. Rates of influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality were much greater in adults ≥65 y than in all other age groups, while rates of influenza-associated respiratory hospitalizations had a U-shaped relation with age, being greatest in those <1 y and ≥65 y, and lowest in those 16-44 y. Whereas 96% of excess respiratory deaths were estimated to occur in persons ≥65 y, only 57% of excess respiratory hospitalizations were estimated to occur in this age group. When examining the contribution of different types and subtypes of influenza virus, we found that influenza A(H3N2) had the greatest impact, contributing around half of the excess respiratory mortality and respiratory hospitalizations on average, with influenza B contributing the second largest average during the study period of 15.5 years. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was associated with the highest excess respiratory hospitalization rate in older children 6-15 y and young adults 16-44 y among all types/subtypes of influenza virus (Table 1) . We found that the proportions of cause-specific mortality and hospitalization attributable to influenza varied across different types/subtypes of influenza virus. The estimated contribution of influenza viruses to all-cause mortality and all-cause hospitalizations was approximately double the impact on respiratory mortality and hospitalizations respectively ( Table 2) . Influenza A(H3N2) was associated with approximately half of the influenza-attributable excess mortality and excess hospitalization across different causes of disease. Influenza B had a greater contribution to the excess all-cause hospitalizations (177 per 100,000 persons per year) than that to excess cardiorespiratory hospitalizations (75 per 100,000 persons per year), while cardiorespiratory diseases accounted for majority of excess hospitalizations for different subtypes of influenza A viruses ( Table 2) . Seasonal influenza A(H1N1) was generally associated with the lowest excess hospitalizations among the four types/subtypes of virus while the estimated excess mortality was largely similar to influenza B and A(H1N1)pdm09 across different causes of disease classifications. We estimated that the ratio of excess respiratory deaths to excess respiratory hospitalizations was 34.2 (95% CrI: 27.6, 41.1) deaths per 1,000 hospitalizations in all ages for influenza viruses overall. In other words, for every 1,000 estimated excess respiratory hospitalizations associated with influenza, we estimated that there were around 34.2 influenza-associated excess respiratory deaths in Hong Kong. When stratifying analyses by age, the estimated ratios were unstable with wide credibility intervals in most age groups because of the low numbers of excess deaths, but we were able to estimate ratios for adults 45-64 y and ≥65 y. The ratios were smaller for 45-64 y, with an average of 26.5 (95% CrI: 15.6, 39.3) excess respiratory deaths for every one thousand excess respiratory hospitalizations in this age group, compared to 58.8 (95% CrI: 49.1, 69.1) excess respiratory deaths for every thousand excess respiratory hospitalizations in persons ≥65 y. Estimates of excess death in persons ≥65 y allowed us to compare these ratios of deaths to hospitalizations between the different influenza types/subtypes. In this age group, the ratio of deaths to hospitalizations for H1N1pdm09 was a factor of 2.7 (95% CrI: 1.1, 5.9) higher than the ratio of deaths to hospitalzations for H3N2 (Table 3) . Similarly, the hospitalization to death ratio was significantly higher for seasonal H1N1 compared to H3N2 by a factor of 3.6 (95% CrI: 1.4, 14.5), and was significantly higher for H1N1pdm09 compared to influenza B by a factor of 3.8 (95% CrI: 1.2, 10.0), and for seasonal H1N1 compared to influenza B by a factor of 5.8 (95% CrI: 1.4, 25.8). There was no significant difference in the death to hospitalization ratio for influenza B compared to H3N2 (ratio 0.8, 95% CrI: 0.4, 1.4) and for H1N1pdm09 compared to seasonal H1N1 (ratio 1.8, 95% CrI: 0.4, 7.5). We were unable to evaluate similar ratios for other age groups because of the greater uncertainty in the estimated death-to-hospitalization ratios.
