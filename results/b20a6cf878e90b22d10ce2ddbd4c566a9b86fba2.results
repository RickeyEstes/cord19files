Remodeled ER membranes associate with reovirus inclusions. ER cisternae surround and contact reovirus inclusions in HeLa and MDCK cells (22) . Here, we studied the association of ER with VIs by confocal and electron microcopy (Fig. 1) . The ER was immunolabeled with an antibody specific for the ER membrane marker calreticulin. Fluorescence confocal microscopy showed that reovirus infection triggers a massive transformation of the ER that becomes thin, undulated, and fragmented ( Fig. 1A and B ). Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of serial transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that groups of thin, undulated ER tubules concentrate around VIs (Fig. 1C) . Similar findings were obtained in studies of reovirus-infected mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). ER membranes were observed surrounding and inside VIs using confocal microscopy (Fig. S1A ). TEM of VIs at various magnifications showed rough ER (RER) surrounding and contacting the VIs, and membrane fragments were often seen inside VIs (Fig. S1B) . To determine whether remodeled ER membranes associate with reovirus inclusions early in infection, we used correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM). HeLa cells expressing mCherry fused to the first 230 amino acids of NS, which incorporate a domain required to interact with several other viral proteins and localize to VIs (23), were cultured on photoetched gridded coverslips, infected with reovirus, and imaged using fluorescence microscopy ( Fig. 1D and E) . Fluorescent mCherry-NS protein was recruited to nascent VIs that were selected for ultrastructural analysis. TEM of ultrathin sections showed membranes inside and at the periphery of early VIs (Fig. 1F) . ER proteins and newly synthesized viral RNA are detected inside VIs. The Tokuyasu cryosectioning technique does not require sample dehydration and provides optimal preservation of membranes and the highest accessibility of antigens to antibodies for immunostaining (24, 25) . We prepared Tokuyasu cryosections of reovirusinfected cells for immunogold labeling of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and calreticulin, luminal, and membrane ER proteins, respectively (Fig. 2) . Both anti-PDI ( Fig. 2A and B) and anti-calreticulin ( Fig. 2C and D) antibodies labeled characteristic ER cisternae in the cytosol as well as membrane fragments, vesicles, and viral particles inside inclusions. To determine whether tubulovesicular elements of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) are present inside VIs, we immunogold labeled the ERGIC marker KDEL-R. In mock-infected and reovirus-infected cells, KDEL-R was detected in pre-Golgi and cis-Golgi membranous elements but not in VIs (data not shown). HeLa cells were adsorbed with reovirus T1L M1-P208S. At 14 h postadsorption, cells were immunolabeled with a rabbit anti-calreticulin (CLT) polyclonal antiserum, a mouse anti-NS monoclonal antibody, and the corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 (green) and Alexa 594 (red). Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). (A) A mock-infected cell with normal ER cisternae. (B) Reovirus-infected cell with altered ER.

Selected fluorescent cells (dashed squares) were imaged using TEM (F). An early VI is surrounded by rough ER (RER) and mitochondria (mi). Membranes distribute inside (black arrows) and at the periphery (arrowheads) of the inclusion. Bars, 10 m (A and B), 500 nm (C), and 200 nm (F). ER Remodeling in Reovirus Factory Biogenesis ® Immunogold labeling with an antibody specific for dsRNA that labels viral replication sites (26, 27) and reovirus ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) showed signals in viral particles and membranes inside the VIs (Fig. 2E) . Colocalization of dsRNA with PDI also was observed (Fig. 2E ). To localize viral RNA synthesis relative to VIs, we assessed bromouridine (BrU) incorporation via immunogold labeling of Tokuyasu cryosections (Fig. 2F ). BrU labeling was observed in inclusions associated with viral particles, marking viral RNA that had accumulated during the 5-h labeling window (Fig. 2F ). These particles are viral cores in which genome replication takes place (28, 29) but also likely mature virions, which may retain signal due to the prolonged labeling window. BrU labeling also was associated with membranes inside VIs (Fig. 2F) . Although BrU was maintained in the cell culture medium for 5 h, BrU signal was found only in VIs. A total of 258 labeled structures in VIs from 5 cells were photographed. BrU labeling was Thawed cryosections were processed for immunogold labeling using a rabbit polyclonal anti-PDI antiserum and a secondary antibody bound to 10-nm colloidal gold particles (A and B) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-calreticulin (CLT) antiserum and a secondary antibody bound to 10-nm colloidal gold particles (C and D). (E) Cryosections were double labeled with a rabbit polyclonal anti-PDI antiserum and a secondary antibody bound to 5-nm colloidal gold particles (arrows) and a mouse monoclonal anti-dsRNA antibody and a secondary antibody bound to 15-nm colloidal gold particles (arrowheads). Anti-PDI antibody labels RER cisternae in the cytosol and membranes inside inclusions. Anti-dsRNA antibody labels membranes and viral particles inside VIs. (F) Cryosection labeled with a mouse monoclonal anti-BrU antibody and a secondary antibody bound to 10-nm colloidal gold particles. The anti-BrU antibody labels membrane fragments (white arrows) and viral particles (black arrows). (G and H) Cryosections were double labeled with a mouse monoclonal anti-BrU antibody and a secondary antibody bound to 15-nm colloidal gold particles (arrowheads) and an antiserum specific for the 3 viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase and a secondary antibody bound to 5-nm colloidal gold particles (arrows). Low-and high-magnification views of VIs show that both antibodies label viral particles and membrane fragments (inset in panel G). Bars, 200 nm (A, B, and E), 100 nm (C, D, F, G, and inset in G), and 50 nm (H). detected in viral particles (35%) and membranes (46%) as well as in some labeled structures that were not clearly identified (19%). Double labeling with antibodies specific for BrU and the 3 viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which resides in the virion core, showed that inside VIs, both antibodies label viral particles ( Fig. 2G and H) and membrane fragments (Fig. 2G , inset). These results suggest that the ER-derived, tubulovesicular membranes inside VIs support viral replication and assembly. Considering that genome replication of Reoviridae viruses occurs inside viral cores (28, 29) , the significance of membrane fragments labeled with anti-dsRNA or anti-BrU antibodies inside VIs is uncertain. Nonetheless, our findings raise the possibility that reovirus genome segments associate with membranes prior to assortment into viral particles inside VIs. The 3D membranous internal organization of VIs was analyzed in detail by electron tomography of Tokuyasu cryosections. The tomographic volumes revealed that VIs consist of groups of thin tubules and vesicles (Fig. 3) . The diameter of the thin tubules is approximately one-third of the normal ER cisternae. Mitochondria and ER cisternae are adjacent to the inclusions. Remarkably, all viral particles inside the VIs are attached to membranes (Movies S1 and S2). We conclude that the membranous compartment primary involved in construction of reovirus inclusions is the ER. ER remodeling during the initial stages of reovirus infection. To visualize ER remodeling during reovirus infection, HeLa cells were transfected with mCherry-KDEL and adsorbed with reovirus. ER remodeling during infection was visualized using real-time, live-cell microscopy. Early in infection, the ER fragmented, collapsed, and aggregated ( Fig. 4A ; Movie S3). Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy imaging after video recording confirmed that cells with the observed ER remodeling were indeed infected ( Fig. S2 ; Movie S4). For a more precise, higher-resolution analysis of ER remodeling during infection, we used confocal microscopy to image HeLa cells transfected with mCherry-KDEL and infected with reovirus ( Fig. 4B ). ER remodeling in infected cells was found to occur by a process that begins with tubule thinning, followed by fragmentation, and concludes with collapse. Similar findings were obtained using live-cell imaging and confocal microscopy of U-2 OS cells engineered to stably express mCherry-KDEL, transfected with an N-terminal-tagged green fluorescent protein (GFP) construct expressing residues 1 to 230 of the NS protein, and infected with reovirus (Movie S5). Live-cell imaging showed that VIs interact with the remodeled ER during infection. Stimulated emission depletion (STED) superresolution microscopy revealed additional fine details of the remodeled ER in reovirus-infected cells (Fig. 4C ). The reovirus NS protein was found to associate with ER thin tubules and fragments surrounding and inside nascent, small inclusions (arrows in Fig. 4C ). VIs of a variety of sizes remained attached to the remodeled ER. Based on these observations, we conclude that the ER undergoes rapid remodeling in an ordered process after infection and that VIs associate with the remodeled ER to build large inclusions and replication factories. Reovirus NS and NS remodel the ER. To identify the viral proteins that induce ER remodeling, we ectopically expressed the reovirus NS and NS proteins and HeLa cells were adsorbed with reovirus, incubated for 14 h, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and sectioned at Ϫ120°C. Thawed cryosections were processed by electron tomography. A single-axis tilt series was obtained between Ϫ63°and ϩ60°with an angular interval of 1.5°. Images were recorded using an Eagle 4k-by-4k slow-scan charge-coupled device (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands) with FEI software and a Tecnai G2 microscope (FEI) operating at 200 kV. Images were aligned, and the tomogram was reconstructed using the IMOD software package. The tomogram was subjected to noise filtering and automated segmentation to visualize membranes. The 3D model was constructed using Amira. RER, yellow; viral particles, light blue; mitochondria, red; tubules and membrane fragments inside the VI, brown; vesicles inside the VI, orange. The VI is a collection of vesicles and tubules with viral particles attached to membranes (arrows). (30, 31) , although precise functions for each are not well understood. HeLa cells were transfected with mCherry-KDEL, NS, and NS and imaged by confocal microscopy. Experiments with expression plasmids encoding NS and NS from reovirus strains T1L and T3D produced similar results ( Fig. 5 and S3 ). The expression of these viral proteins caused ER remodeling like that observed during reovirus infection, with ER tubulation followed by fragmentation and culminating in collapse (Fig. 5A) . To determine the effect of independent expression of NS and NS on alterations in ER structure, HeLa cells were transfected with mCherry-KDEL alone or in combination with either NS or NS and imaged by confocal microscopy 24 h posttransfection. Cells expressing NS showed an altered ER with separated, thin, branched tubules ( Fig. 5B and S3). The NS protein concentrated in the gaps between the tubules, producing a ring-like pattern (Fig. 5B) . Cells expressing NS showed long, thin ER tubules without branches (Fig. S3 ) and a fragmented ER (Fig. 5C ). NS associated with ER tubules and fragments ( Fig. 5C and S3) . To investigate how NS induces ER fragmentation, we localized NS molecules with metal-tagging TEM (METTEM), a highly sensitive labeling technique (32, 33) . HeLa cells engineered to express mCherry fused to NS residues 1 to 230 and metallothionein (MT) (mCherry-NS-MT) were adsorbed with reovirus, incubated with gold and silver, ER Remodeling in Reovirus Factory Biogenesis ® fixed, and embedded in resin. Ultrathin sections were stained and imaged using TEM ( Fig. 5D and S4 ). Gold-silver particles bound to MT revealed the precise location of MT-tagged NS molecules. We observed that prior to VI assembly, mCherry-NS-MT distributes with vesicles near the nucleus where the mCherry fluorescent signal concentrates (Fig. 5D) ; mCherry-NS-MT gold-silver molecules also distributed to thin, strangled ER cisternae where they distribute with near-uniform spacing (Fig. 5E) . Together with the confocal images shown in Fig. 5C , this finding suggests a role for NS in ER fragmentation. Results from gene silencing experiments using either NSor NS-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in reovirus-infected cells showed only minor ER remodeling. This finding is consistent with the observation that NS expression is diminished following NS silencing and vice versa (Fig. S5) . The ER morphological changes caused by reovirus infection or ectopic expression of NS and NS were quantified microscopically (Fig. 6) . In this analysis, NS causes a thinning of the tubular ER, whereas NS disrupts the branches of the thin tubules and cleaves those structures into small pieces. At later stages of infection, the ER collapses and aggregates, leaving large gaps in the cytosol.
