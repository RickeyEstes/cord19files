The 323 positive clinical specimens contained a total of 464 respiratory pathogens as detected by laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays (Table 1) . As shown in Table  2 , the 57 nonnasopharyngeal (non-NPS) specimens comprised 69 of the total 464 respiratory pathogens. Testing all samples with the RP panel resulted in an overall agreement for 452 (97.4%) targets from 311 specimens, prior to discrepant analysis. Of the specimens containing a single pathogen, the detected targets were concordant in 209/217 specimens. For samples with coinfection, the same pathogens could be identified in 77/81, 22/22, and 3/3 in the case of 2, 3, and 4 pathogens present, respectively. Eight of 12 discordant targets (PCR ϩ /RP Ϫ ) had a positive result with threshold cycle (C T ) values of Ͼ35 (Fig. 3) . Retesting with a third assay confirmed 10 of 12 real-time PCR-positive targets being human bocavirus (hBoV; n ϭ 3), rhinovirus (RV; n ϭ 2), parainfluenza virus type 2 (PIV2; n ϭ 1)), human coronavirus (hCoV) OC43 (n ϭ 1), hCoV 229E (n ϭ 1), hCoV HKU1 (n ϭ 1), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV; n ϭ 1). The two unresolved PCR ϩ /RP Ϫ results consisted of two hMPV-positive samples (C T values of 33.2 and 38.3). The RP panel yielded a positive result in 17 specimens, where the laboratorydeveloped test (LDT) remained negative (PCR Ϫ /RP ϩ ), including 15 additional pathogens previously undetected by LDT in the 323 positive specimens and one influenza A H1N1 2009 virus that was detected as influenza A virus by LDT ( Table 1) . Seven of these 15 additional targets could be confirmed, including three of RV/enterovirus (EV) (all confirmed as RV), two of PIV4, and one each of hBoV and hCoV NL63. One of the selected negative samples tested positive for human adenovirus (hAdV) in the RP panel but could not be confirmed by discrepant testing. All other negative specimens tested negative in the RP panel as well. Both Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) isolates could be detected by the RP panel. By testing a 10-fold dilution series of both isolates, it was shown that MERS-CoV with a C T value of Ͻ30 in the laboratory-developed real-time PCR assay could be detected using the RP panel, while detection with a C T value of Ͼ30 was achievable but was not reproducible in every instance. Of the 12 specimens from the Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD) 2016 Respiratory II Pilot external quality assessment (EQA) study panel, 10 were detected in full agreement with the content as reported by QCMD ( Table 3 ). The 2 false-negative tested specimens both contained hCoV NL63, of which one was a coinfection in an hMPV-positive sample. Both specimens had been tested with the laboratory-developed real-time PCR assay as well and were found positive for hCoV NL63, both with C T values of 37.4. The Qnostics evaluation panel consisted of 17 samples, including 15 different respiratory pathogens and one negative sample ( Table 3 ). The RP panel detected 15 of the specimens in agreement with the content, whereas hAdV type 1 and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were not detected. Real-time PCR detection of these specimens was performed to confirm the presence of the respective pathogen in the specimen and was found positive for both hAdV (C T value of 31.4) and C. pneumoniae (C T value of 35.4). The hybridized molecule is then exposed to another sequence-specific probe that is bound to a solid phase, which is a gold electrode (A). Upon binding of the two molecules, the ferrocene comes in close proximity to the gold electrode, where an electron transfer that can be measured using GenMark's eSensor technology on the ePlex system can occur (B).
