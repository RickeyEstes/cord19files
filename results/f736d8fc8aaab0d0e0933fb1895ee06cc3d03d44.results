The measured sodium concentration of the saline-filled capillary tube was 146 mmol/L, and that of the MAH gel contaminated tube was .180 mmol/L. On the other hand, the sodium concentrations of all six disinfectants were found to be ,5 mmol/L, while their potassium concentrations were ,0.5 mmol/L using ICP-MS. These findings showed that MAH gel significantly interfered with sodium analysis on the RP400 analyser. Figures 1 and 2 show that contamination of blood specimens with any of the six hand disinfectants can interfere with sodium and potassium analyses on all three POC analysers. MAH gel contamination at concentrations >1% (10 mL per 1000 mL whole blood) caused marked increases in measured sodium concentration on the RP400 analyser. The RL865 and i-STAT analysers were also affected, but to a much lesser extent. For potassium analysis, all three analysers had similar interference showing progressive Electrolytes in capillary whole blood specimens were analysed by the pointof-care Rapidpoint 400 analyser using direct ion-selective electrodes (ISE); heparinised venous plasma specimens were taken within 10 min of the capillary samples and analysed in the main chemical pathology laboratory by the DP Modular analyser using indirect ISE. (Fig. 1a, 2a) . Contamination with Microshield Handrub did not affect sodium measurement on any analyser, but caused marked increases in measured potassium concentrations on the RP400 and RL865 analysers (Fig. 1b, 2b) . Hexol Antiseptic Lotion did not affect sodium measurement using the i-STAT, but significantly decreased sodium results from the RP400 and RL865 analysers. On all three analysers, potassium concentration started to falsely elevate from 1% contamination (Fig. 1c, 2c) . At >4% contamination, Swashes Handrub (Swashes Chemical Co., China) caused small but statistically significant negative and positive interferences with sodium measurements on the RL865 and i-STAT analysers, respectively. However, potassium results were significantly increased on all analysers (Fig. 1d, 2d) . Avagard Antiseptic Handrub (3M Pharmaceuticals, Australia) at low concentrations did not cause significant changes in measured sodium concentrations, but resulted in markedly increased measured potassium concentrations on all analysers (Fig. 1e, 2e) . Compared with the other five disinfectants, AiE Hand Sanitizer (DeVos Cosmetics Asia, China) caused the smallest interference in sodium and potassium measurements on all analysers. While sodium concentrations tended to decrease, there were no consistent changes in potassium measurement (Fig. 1f, 2f) . Tables 3 and 4 summarise the test statistics for the measurements of both sodium and potassium concentrations by RL865, RP400 and i-STAT, respectively, comparing the absence and the presence of varying amounts of different brands of hand disinfectants as contaminant. In summary, of the six products tested, MAH gel caused the greatest and most clinically important changes in measured sodium concentrations on the RP400 analyser. Apart from AiE Hand Sanitizer, all of the other products significantly increased the measured potassium concentration, especially on the RP400 and RL865 analysers, both of which use a direct ISE method for electrolyte measurement.
