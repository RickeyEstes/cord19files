Two subtropical cities Guangzhou and Hong Kong shared similar meteorological conditions, while the tropical city Singapore tended to be hotter and more humid with much less variations in both temperature and humidity (Table 1) . Among the three cities, Hong Kong had the largest population, while Singapore had the youngest ( Table 1 ). The crude mortality rate of Guangzhou was slightly higher than that of Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively. More than 75% of deaths were in the 65 or older age group in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, whereas this number was only 66% in Singapore. CRD was the major cause of death in all three cities, but P&I mortality in Guangzhou and COPD in Singapore was the lowest among the three cities ( Table 1) . The proportion of specimens positive for influenza A or B in Singapore had an average of 4.0%, which was lower than that in Guangzhou and Hong Kong (10.1% and 13.9%, respectively) ( Table 2 ). This could be due to less stringent diagnosis criteria adopted by Singapore for recruitment of patients into its surveillance network, using the case definition of acute respiratory illness instead of ILI. Influenza seasonality was similar between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, but the winter peak was less pronounced in the latter. There were no clear epidemic periods in Singapore, despite one sharp spike around June of 2006 (Fig. 1) Influenza was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with all-cause mortality as well as with underlying cause of CRD, P&I, COPD and IHD for the all-ages group in all three cities, with the exceptions of COPD in Guangzhou and Singapore, and IHD in Singapore (Table 3) . During the study period of 2004-2006, Hong Kong had the highest percentages of excess deaths associated with influenza among the three cities, with the only exception of IHD deaths. For the all-ages group, Hong Kong had the highest excess deaths for all causes and for underlying causes of P&I and COPD, whereas Guangzhou had the highest excess deaths due to CRD and IHD. The excess death rates for the old population were highest in Guangzhou for all-cause and CRD death. Note: CI, confidence interval; CRD, cardiorespiratory diseases; P&I, pneumonia and influenza; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases; IHD, ischemic heart diseases. The annual death rates attributable to influenza revealed the greatest disease burden of influenza in the year 2005 for Guangzhou and Singapore, but in 2006 for Hong Kong. The year with the lowest disease burden was 2004 for Hong Kong and Singapore, and 2006 for Guangzhou (Fig. 2) . In Guangzhou, an annual rate of 8. Between the two types of influenza virus, influenza A accounted for the majority of excess deaths in all three cities (data not shown). As the denominator of subtype proportion of Singapore was not comparable with that of the other two cities, we only estimated deaths attributable to influenza A subtypes, A/H3N2 and A/H1N1, in Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Comparison between the two subtypes showed that A/H1N1 accounted for slightly more excess deaths in the all-ages group for all the disease categories under study in both Guangzhou and Hong Kong (Fig. 3) . This pattern was also observed for the 65+ age group.
