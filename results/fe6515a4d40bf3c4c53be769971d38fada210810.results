From January 2012 through December 2016, 6,857 respiratory viruses were detected and 3,065,789 antibiotic prescriptions were filled with distinct seasonality from December through February (Fig. 2-A) . Peak precipitation and temperature were noted from June through August annually (Fig. 2-B ). There were 16,419 bacterial pathogens identified: 2,354 C. difficile, 4,026 MRSA, 9, 767 GNB, and 272 S. pneumoniae (Fig. 2-C) . The level of detection of bacterial pathogens varied in month of onset, peak prevalence and duration of detection. The peak in antibiotic prescriptions filled occurred 3 months before the peak in detection of C. difficile (OR = 1.24, 95% C.I., 1.07-1.43; P = 0.006; Table 1 ). Peak detection of MRSA occurred 7 months after the peak in antibiotic prescriptions filled (OR = 1.69, 95% C.I., 1.21-2.35; P = 0.003) and 10 months after the peak in respiratory virus detection (OR = 1.04, 95% C.I., 1.01-1.06; P = 0.003). The peak GNB detection occurred 2 months after the peak mean monthly temperature (OR = 1.69, 95% C.I., 1.20-2.39; P = 0.004). The peak in detection of S. pneumoniae occurred at the peak in detection of respiratory viruses (OR = 1.01, 95% C.I., 1.00-1.01; P = 0.015).
