Design and operation of the micro-optofluidic platform. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the micro-optofluidic platform. The 150-μ m-deep polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic channel was fabricated using conventional soft-lithography processes 38 . The micro-optofluidic platform is based on single-layer PDMS channel and has four inlets (one sample inlet, one dye inlet, and two hydraulic focusing sheath inlets), and one outlet for waste. It consists of four main components: sample and dye inlets, a mixing region, a hydraulic focusing zone, and a sample optofluidic detection component (see Fig. S1 ). We used SYTO82 dye (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR, USA) with an excitation wavelength of 541 nm and an emission wavelength of 560 nm for nuclear staining of live cells in the microfluidic mixing zone. SYTO82 provides cell-permeant nucleic acid staining and exhibits low intrinsic fluorescence in cell-free systems, with marked enhancement upon binding to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) 39, 40 . Following injection of the sample and dye using a syringe pump (KDS200; KD Scientific Inc., Holliston, MA, USA), the two fluids mixed rapidly at the entrance to the mixing zone. Numerical analysis was carried out using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package CFD-ACE (ESI US R&D Inc., Huntsville, AL, USA) to identify the optimal design and operating conditions. The Navier-Stokes equations were solved with Fick's law of diffusion to describe the dynamics and homogenization of the mixing process in the channel. Figure 1 (B-1,B-2) show the results of the CFD simulations and optical micrographs of the mixing of the sample and dye in the micro-mixer part. The numerical simulations show that the mixing of the two fluids was complete approximately 0.1-0.4 mm from the entrance of mixing zone with flow rate conditions for each fluid in the range 2.5-25 μ L/h (simulation duration, ~72-180 ms) (Fig. S2 ). The mixing zone was 136.8 mm long and 50 μ m wide. The residence time for mixing (and hence for the reaction between the sample and dye) was in the range 25-246 s for total flow rates in the range 5-50 μ L/h. After passing through the mixing zone, the mixed sample fluid was focused horizontally using a dual sheath flow with sterilized distilled water (SDW) in the hydraulic focusing component (see Fig. 1 (A) ). The focused core flow was 7.5 μ m wide, which is one-twentieth the width of the channel. This minimized variation in the optical signals among locations in the particle detection zone 30 . Figure 1 (C-1) shows a schematic diagram of real-time detection of target particles in the core flow, as well as the optical setup for continuous detection and signal quantification. A diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and an output power of 2.0 mW (CNI laser, Changchun, China) was coupled with a single-mode optical fiber (core diameter: 3.5 μ m, cladding diameter: 125 μ m). The laser beam was focused on the core fluid using an objective lens (RMS20x-PF; 20x/0.5; Thorlabs) located beneath the microfluidic channel (~7 μ m beam spot size at full-width half-maximum). A highly sensitive multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) (C10507-11-50U; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan) module was used to detect the SC and FL signals from the target particles. The particle FL was collected using the objective lens, and entered the MPPC via the optical long-pass filter and focusing lens. To bring the SC light from the particles, multi-mode optical fiber with a core diameter of 105 μ m and a cladding diameter of 125 μ m (Thorlabs) was carefully inserted into the channel with the axis of the fiber at 90° to the direction of flow, and linked to the MPPC. A data acquisition (DAQ) unit (NI USB-6356; National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) was employed to collect the analog data from the MPPC modules, which were recorded using a desktop computer. An oscilloscope (DPO 2012B; Tektronix, Beaverton, USA) was used to monitor the signal in real-time, as shown in Fig. 1  Performance evaluation of the micro-optofluidic platform using standard PSL particles. The particle detection performance of the optofluidic platform was evaluated under various microfluidic and sample conditions, such that the sample flow rate and the mixing ratios of FL and non-FL particles were varied. We used standard spherical polystyrene latex (PSL) and fluorescence PSL (FLPSL) particles that were 1 μ m in diameter. Figure 2 shows the particle FL and SC signals with flow velocities in the range 1.42-14.3 mm/s. The FLPSL particle suspension (~1.45 × 10 3 /μ L) was injected into sample inlet. The ratio of the flow rate of the FLPSL particle suspension to that of the SDW was 1:19 in the narrow core region (which had dimensions of 7.5 × 150 μ m). As the flow velocity increased from 1.42 to 14.3 mm/s, the frequency of the particle SC and FL signals increased in proportion to the particle flow velocity, and the average intensity of the measured SC and FL signals (SC/FL) decreased from ~140 arbitrary unit (a.u.)/~60 a.u. to ~46 a.u./~30 a.u., respectively ( Fig. 2 (A) ). This is attributed to the decreased photon integration time of the photodetector with decreasing residence time of the particles in the detection zone of microchannel 41 . Figure 2 (B) shows that the event rate (i.e., number of counts per second) of the particle SC and FL signals followed a linear relationship with the particle flow velocity; for FL we have y = 1.04x + 0.37, with r 2 = 0.996, and for SC we have y = 1.07x + 0.52, with r 2 = 0.998. The index of coincidence between the total frequencies of particle SC and FL signals was ~96.5% over the entire range of particle flow velocities. McClain et al. reported that only ~5% of the particle SC signals were unaccompanied by coincident FL signals, which was attributed to unresolved FL peaks due to the relatively low signal intensity 36 . When the number of counts of the particle SC and FL signals are plotted as histograms as a function of the signal intensity, both sets of signals form Gaussian-like distributions, as shown in Fig. S3 . The variation in the intensity results from variations in the particle size and particle position in the detection zone. As expected, the particle SC signal was significantly stronger than the FL signal. We evaluated the particle detection performance of the micro-optofluidic platform with various mixing ratios of FLPSL and PSL particles. The total particle concentration was fixed at ~1.45 × 10 3 /μ L, and the total flow rate of the mixed suspension was 25 μ L/h, giving a flow velocity of ~7.1 mm/s. The mixing ratio of FLPSL and PSL particle suspensions was varied in the range 0 -100%. As shown in Fig. 3 (A) , the ratio of the count rate of FL signals to SC signals increased in proportion to the mixing ratio of FLPSL particles. Figure 3 (B) shows fluorescence microscopy images of the FLPSL particles in the mixing suspension. When the mixing ratio of FLPSL particles was 0%, the FLPSL particle number concentration in the micrographs was 0/μ L; at a mixing ratio of 50%, the FLPSL particle number concentration was 688/μ L (~95% of the initial FLPSL particle concentration); and at a mixing ratio of 100%, the FLPSL particle number concentration was 1406/μ L (~97% of the initial FLPSL particle concentration). PSL particles could not be enumerated using normal bright-field microscopy because of the limit of resolution and small field of view. From this performance evaluation (Figs 2 and 3) , we may conclude that the micro-optofluidic platform demonstrated not only real-time and continuous particle detection, with suitable performance for standard PSL particles, but also quantitative and accurate discrimination between FL and non-FL particles. Real-time detection of airborne microorganisms. To simulate a hazardous airborne bacteria-contaminated environment, we prepared a 1 × 1 × 1 m test chamber containing live, airborne Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis bioaerosols separately. Details of the experimental setup can be found in the Methods and Supplemental Information (Fig. S4) . Figure 4 shows the size and morphology of the bacterial bioaerosols in the test chamber. Real-time particle size distribution data of the bacterial bioaerosols were obtained using an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS; 3321; TSI Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA). As shown in Fig. 4 (A) , the bacterial bioaerosols exhibited mono-modal curves with a specific geometric mean diameter (GMD), peak diameter, and geometric standard deviation (GSD). Table 1 lists these data for the three bioaerosols; the GMDs of E. coli and B. subtilis were similar at ~1 μ m, and that of S. epidermidis was somewhat smaller, at ~0.8 μ m. Airborne bacterial bioaerosols in the test chamber were collected using a BioSampler (SKC Inc., Eighty Four, PA, USA), which is a highly efficient collection device that traps airborne microorganisms in a swirling liquid for subsequent analysis 42 . The airborne particle collection efficiency of the BioSampler was ~94.3% for the 1-μ m-diameter PSL particles (Fig. S5) . Figure 4 Samples containing the bacterial suspension were injected into the micro-optofluidic platform using a syringe pump to evaluate the device performance for the real-time detection of airborne bacterial particles. Figure 5 (A) shows the acquired SC and FL signals of the test bacterial bioaerosols. The average SC/FL signal intensity ratios were ~555/240 for E. coli, ~565/227 for B. subtilis, and ~433/142 for S. epidermidis. Because of the size of these bacteria (i.e., 0.5 -1.6 μ m), they may be considered to lie within the Mie scattering regime, and the intensity of the SC signals may be assumed to be proportional to the cross-sectional area of particles 36 . In the same manner, the FL signal intensity increased proportionally with the size of the bacteria because larger particles have a higher concentration of nucleic-acid fluorescent dye 33, 36 . The particle number concentration was determined based on the frequency data for the SC and FL signals. Table 2 lists the SC signal concentration, which corresponds to the total particle number concentration. This was higher than the FL signal concentration, which corresponds to the total concentration of microorganisms. The difference between the total particle count (SC signals) and the total bacterial concentration (FL signals) was ~7% for E. coli, ~16% for B. subtilis, and ~23% for S. epidermidis. It follows that the sample included other particles; i.e., non-microorganism particles or impurities, such as non-dyed particles or small debris. To evaluate the particle detection efficiency for airborne microorganisms, the total concentration of bacteria obtained from the FL signal of the micro-optofluidic platform was compared with the conventional fluorescence microscopy cell counting and colony counting methods. Figure 5 (B) shows a comparison of the concentration of bacteria measured using fluorescence microscopy and colony counting, both of which were normalized to that measured using the micro-optofluidic platform. For E. coli the normalized cell concentration by microscopic cell counting was 88 ± 4.6%, and was 67 ± 8.5% using colony counting; for B. subtilis, the normalized cell concentration using microscopic cell counting was 88 ± 4.7%, and was 77 ± 6.6% using colony counting; and for S. epidermidis the normalized cell concentration using microscopic cell counting was 85 ± 11.1%, and was 73 ± 12.4% using colony counting. The concentration of bacteria measured using both conventional cell-counting methods was lower than that using the micro-optofluidic platform. The micro-optofluidic platform exhibited the highest cell counts and the lowest standard deviation, which is indicative of superior performance. Photobleaching of fluorophores may occur during cell counting via conventional fluorescence microscopy, which results in a reduction in the fluorescence intensity. Furthermore, the low signal-to-noise ratio in the imaging process may lead to underestimation of the number of cells. An inappropriate image threshold intensity setting is required to discriminate fluorescence particles from the background, and this may exclude particles that either have a low fluorescence intensity or are slightly out of focus 43 . Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the total concentration of particles with sizes of less than 1 μ m is limited by the resolution and the field of view of bright-field microscopy. As shown in Figure 5 (B), the colony counting method resulted in the lowest cell concentration of the three methods. The colony counting method measures only culturable cells in the medium. Therefore, it is difficult to apply the colony counting method for the analysis of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) microorganisms, or microorganisms that require a specific growth environment and/or specific nutrients 44 . The micro-optofluidic platform with integrated sample preparation and detection simplifies the system, can significantly reduce the measurement time, and can yield more accurate quantitative results 48 . The number concentration of the particles in air was recorded for each APS channel size, divided by the logarithmic interval of the corresponding particle size range and plotted as a function of the aerodynamic diameter 48 Table 1 . Size characteristics of test airborne bacterial particles. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) is defined as exp( where d j is the diameter of an individual particle, n j is the number of particles in the j th group, N is the total number of particles, and ln d g is the natural logarithm of the geometric mean diameter (GMD) of the particles, defined as ∑ / n d N ln compared with the abovementioned conventional methods. Furthermore, our system provides additional information on the total particle number concentration of aerosols, which is difficult to obtain using conventional methods.
