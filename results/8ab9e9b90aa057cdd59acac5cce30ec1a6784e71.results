Neutralization antibody-positive animals were detected in all 16 case farms (100%) and in 6 of 64 non-case farms (9.4%; Table  1 ). The proportion of seropositive animals from case farms was 63.7% (212/333), significantly different from that of non-case farms (4.3% (53/1,223), P<0.05; Table 2 ). The mean NT titer for seropositive animals of case farms was not significantly different from that of non-case farms (Table 3) . Within-farm level, maximum proportion of seropositive animals in case farms was 100% (18/18) while the minimum was 20.0% (6/30) ( Table 2 ). In non-case farms, the maximum and minimum values were 90.0% (9/10) and 5.6% (1/18), respectively ( Table 2 ). The proportions of seropositive animals in farrow-to-finish (FF) and wean-to-finish (WF) case farms were 74.0 and 57.3%, respectively, whereas they were 8.74 and 0.87% in FF and WF non-case farms, respectively. The proportion of seropositive animals in FF farms was significantly higher than in WF for both case and non-case farms (P<0.05).
