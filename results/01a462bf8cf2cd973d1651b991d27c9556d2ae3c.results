The crystal structure of C-terminally truncated TYMV PRO/DUB reveals a mobile loop, closure of which constricts the P side of the active site In order to get an atomic view of a conformation of PRO/DUB not constrained by the crystalinduced PRO:PRO interaction, we generated a recombinant mutant harbouring deletion of the five C-terminal residues (hereafter ΔC5), corresponding to residues 728-874 of the TYMV 206K polyprotein. Crystals of ΔC5 diffracting to beyond 2 Å resolution were obtained [38] , and we have since collected data extending to beyond 1.7 Å resolution. We therefore used these new data to solve the ΔC5 structure by molecular replacement from WT PRO ( Table 1) . The ΔC5 crystal contains two molecules per asymmetric unit, hereafter referred to as molecules 'A' and 'B'. Molecule 'B' is slightly less ordered as revealed by a 10 Å 2 higher average Bfactor (Table 1, S2A Fig) . Clear electron density is present for residues 730-874 of molecule 'A', and 732-874 of molecule 'B'. Both molecules have their C-termini far from the catalytic sites of other molecules in the crystal packing. We thus have two independent views of PRO/ DUB not engaged as a substrate in a PRO:PRO complex. Superimposition of molecules 'A' and 'B' of the ΔC5 mutant with the WT (engaged) PRO/DUB (Fig 1A) shows that PRO/DUB retains the same conformation in all three environments, with the exception of loop 864-868. This loop was strongly constrained in the previous structure due to the cleaved PRO molecule's loop being bound by the cleaving PRO molecule. It is now released in both molecules of the mutant protein ΔC5, and displays high mobility in this disengaged form. In molecule 'B', Pro866 at the tip of the loop (Fig 1B) In fact, in molecule 'B', the mobility of this loop leads to the closure of a hydrophobic zipper between Pro866 and Pro867 on one side, and Leu820 and Leu781 across the catalytic cleft on the other side ( Fig 1B) . His869 and Cys783 also come significantly closer together. Presence of unidentified atoms (S3 Fig) , possibly covalent adducts with DTT or sulfur compounds present in our cryosolution (see Materials and Methods), complicated the unambiguous modeling of the Cys783 side chain. However, it is clear that, in this closed conformation, His869 is now close enough to abstract a proton from Cys783. The large movement of the 865-GPP-867 motif observed in molecule 'B' as compared to the WT engaged PRO is due to a distinct flexing of the tip of the beta sheet into which it is inserted. This flexing extends to the neighboring 842-845 loop and, particularly, to the Asp843 at its tip that follows loop 864-868 ( Fig 1C) . In contrast, the conserved GPP motif itself, with its two cis-prolines, changes very little, although Gly865 shifts slightly, moving in the Ramachandran plot of molecule 'B' to a region that is disallowed to non-glycine residues. In summary, the crystal structure of ΔC5 indicates that, while TYMV PRO/DUB is a rigid molecule, it harbours a very mobile loop, 864-TGPPS-868, that can shift the GPP flap at its tip with its atypical double cis-proline, from an "open" state where it can be recognized by another PRO molecule [21] , to two other states: a "closed" one where it forms half of a hydrophobic zipper, and an "intermediate" one, halfway in between. The closed zipper constricts the P side of the catalytic cleft and also brings the catalytic His869 closer to the catalytic Cys783.
