The total number of ECoV positive horses was 504/5247 (9.6%). The seroprevalence per state ranged from 4.0-19.7% (Table 1 ). Fig. 1 shows the number of horses sampled in each region and the rates of seropositive samples (%). Horses aged >20 years (13.0%), Draft horses (17.6%) and ranch/farm horses (12.0%) had the highest seroprevalence ( Table 2 ). The median age of the study population was 11 years (range, 2-40 years). Statistically significant risk factors in the mixed effects univariate analysis included region (Mid-West), age (>20 years old), breed (Draft horse, Thoroughbred) and use (ranch/farm). There was no significant difference in risk for ECoV seropositivity between male and female horses. In the mixed effects multivariate model, horses from the Mid-West displayed the highest odds ratio of seropositivity in the region category when compared to the reference region (Table 3) . Draft horse showed the highest odds ratio of seroprevalence in the breed category, while Thoroughbreds had the lowest odds ratio of seroprevalence. Ranch/farm and breeding horses displayed the highest odds ratio of seroprevalence in the use category. There was no significant difference between male and female horses and between the reference age group and the other age groups. The total number of ECoV negative horses was 4743/5247 horses (90.4%). Table 2 shows the number (%) of seropositive and seronegative horses sampled for each of the risk factor categories. In the univariate model, horses aged 1-5 years old had 91.7% seronegativity, Thoroughbreds had the highest % seronegativity (95.1%) and competition horses had the highest % seronegativity (92.4%). In the mixed effects multivariate model, horses from the Mid-West were least likely to be seronegative, Thoroughbreds were most likely to be seronegative and Draft horses were least likely to be seronegative (Table 3 ). There was no significant difference in odds for seronegative status by age group, sex and use.
