A total of 324 pancreata were processed for use in all CIT clinical protocols. The overall success rate in producing PHPI lots that met product release criteria was 52.5% (170 of 324 total CIT lots), which is consistent with previously reported rates (48) (49) (50) . Manufacture success among the centers ranged from 24.5 to 89.5%. The main factor associated with manufacturing failure was insufficient number of islets to meet the minimum required product dose. Subjects in Protocol CIT-07 received 75 of the 170 successfully manufactured PHPI lots, and the remainder of this report focuses on these 75 lots.
