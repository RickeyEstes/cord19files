In the vaccination group, all cats showed increases in antibodies against P25 antigen and TM antigen after three vaccinations ( Figs. 1 and 2) . After the three vaccinations, the protected), the mean ELISA O.D. values for P25 antigen and TM peptide remained high until at least 30 weeks after challenge (Fig. 2) . On the other hand, the mean ELISA O.D, values for P25 antigen and TM peptide gradually decreased in Cat No. 13 in the same group as well as in the protected cats in other groups (Figs. l and 2). Table 2 shows the neutralizing antibody titers for Petaluma and Shizuoka strains on the day of challenge. The neutralizing antibody titer for Petaluma strain was 1:20-1:640 in all cats except Cat No. 16, 20, 23, and 24, but that for Shizuoka strain was < 1:10 in all cats including those in the Petaluma + Shizuoka vaccine group.
