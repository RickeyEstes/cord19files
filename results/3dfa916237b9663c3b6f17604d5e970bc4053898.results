The plasma-theophylline half-life was significantly longer during serologically proven upper-respiratorytract infection in five of six asthmatic children than 1 month after the illness (see accompanying table). Four additional subjects having febrile illness without seroconversion had no change in half-life; their mean halflife was 317 (&plusmn;66) during the illness and 332 (&plusmn;64) min 1 month afterwards (P>0-1). Subject 1 experienced acute theophylline toxicity during the febrile illness (plasma-theophylline 43.3 3 g/ml). DISCUSSION Our data suggest that patients with influenza A and adenovirus infection may have longer theophylline plasma half-lives during acute infection than 1 month afterwards. This could be the result of viral infectioninduced acute-phase prolongation or convalescent-phase shortening of half-life. We have insufficient data to determine the exact mechanism. Future confirmation of our data, by means of steady-state clearance determinations, may help us to understand this phenomenon. Since subjects' liver transaminases remained normal, and there was no evidence of dehydration or important alteration of renal function, it is quite possible that influenza and adenovirus infection specifically affected the enzymatic mechanism for theophylline metabolism. The fever accompanying infection is unlikely to have induced this change since febrile patients in whom there was no serological conversion showed no change in plas-,ma-theophylline half-life. While in other subjects changes were striking, the magnitude of change in plasma-theophylline half-life in subject 6 was less than 1%. This result is compatible with the hypothesis that certain, but not all, viral infections may affect theophylline metabolism. Since theophylline concentrations may increase to toxic levels during certain acute viral infections or, alternatively, may fall afterwards, concentrations should be monitored both when symptoms of theophylline toxicity, such as nausea, vomiting, or seizures, accompany acute viral infection and when asthma is poorly controlled with an unchanged theophylline dose after viral infection.
