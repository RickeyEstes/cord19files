Two hundred and sixty cats and kittens were admitted to the shelter during the observation period, however, only 209 of these were available to be observed. An additional 108 cats were already present in the shelter at the start of the study, thus a total of 317 cats were observed during the study period. Fifty-one cats were either dead on arrival or immediately transferred to foster homes or a critical care clinic for emergency treatments. These cats were only included when comparing intake reports, while the 104 cats already residing in the shelter were excluded from analysis of intake reports. The 317 cats that could be observed in the shelter contributed a total of 2339 days of observation (care days) during the period of the study. Healthy cats and kittens contributed 1174 and 246 cat care days respectively, while 486 care days were spent on 78 cats and 24 kittens that had clinical signs of URI at some point during their shelter stay, accounting for 21% of the total cat care days. Ninety-two feral cats accounted for 433 cat care days and could not be evaluated for age or URI status. Inventory reports: When accounting for all cats reported in the observer-collected inventory data and the software system a inventory reports, a total of 2339 cat observations were included. Ninety-five percent (2230 of 2339 care days) of data in the inventory reports were complete in that the cats were reported in the software system a inventory reports and were observed in the shelter on the same day. The incomplete data included 90 care days (4%) reported in the software system a when the cat was not observed in the shelter and 16 care days (1%) when cats were observed in the shelter but not included in the software system a inventory reports. From the complete reports 99% (2189 of 2230 data points) were accurate in that the cats were reported in the correct location in the shelter. Intake reports: Intake data generated from the software system a reports were 77% complete (199/260 cats) when compared to observer collected data, and of these 96% were accurate. The inaccurate records included cats with an incorrect intake date or incorrect location. Size and age: Age was not entered by shelter staff into the shelter software in the field available for this purpose. Instead, the size field was used, on the premise that "small" would represent a kitten, while medium and large would represent adult cats. Using size as a substitute for recording age resulted in a 76% accuracy compared to observer classification. The majority of cats classified as adults by the observer (172) were reported as medium or large and only 12 cats classified as adults by the observer (7%) were reported as small. However, the consistency between observer age estimates and the classification according to size was lower as only 12 kittens (as classified by the observer) were reported as small and 41 kittens as classified by the observer (77%) were reported as large or medium. Vaccination: Both vaccination status and vaccination date reports were compared. Fifty-two percent of the software system a reports were complete as 165 from 317 cats were reported as vaccinated in both the software system a and manual data sets. Of the incomplete records five cat were manually reported as vaccinated but had no vaccination date entered in the software system a ; and 25 cats (8%) were of unknown vaccination status as they had no vaccine reported in the software system a , on their cage card or in the medical records. One hundred twenty two cats (39%) were not vaccinated due to behavior and were noted as such on their cage cards, but had no vaccine status reported in the software system a . If we were to assume that the shelter policy was to leave the vaccine status field in the software system a blank when no vaccine was given the data could have been considered as 92% complete (292/317), while the accuracy would be 90.5% (287/317). Comparisons of vaccination dates entered in the software system a and the medical records showed that 165 vaccination dates (97%) were accurately entered into the software system. Upper respiratory infection: The overall agreement between the observer and the software system a for URI diagnosis was only 59%. Two hundred and twenty three cats were assigned a positive or negative URI diagnosis by the observer; another 92 cats were hiding and could not be evaluated. In the software system a reports cats with clinical signs of URI being incorrectly reported as healthy were twice as common as cats with an accurate URI diagnosis in the software system a ( Table 3 ). The predictive value of the URI status in the software system a compared to observer diagnosis was below 60% both for negative and positive diagnosis (Table 4) . Timeliness: The software system a report and observer agreement when comparing the number of days from admission until diagnosis of URI was poor ( Figure 1 ).
