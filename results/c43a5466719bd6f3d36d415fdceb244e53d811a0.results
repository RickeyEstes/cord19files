Tracheal explants maintain normal histological architecture for up to 7 days, with progressive loss of ciliary activity Uninfected tracheal explants preserved their normal histology without major alterations for up to 7 days after removal from the animal ( Figure 1A -E), with signs of sporadic cell degeneration in the transitional layers between the epithelium and the submucosa. The overall structure of both the pseudostratified columnar epithelium, and the underlying lamina propria were maintained. A progressive increase in the amount of mucus on the epithelial apical surface was observed from day 3 onwards (Figure 1D,E) . Periodic acid-Schiff staining showed that explants maintained overall carbohydrate levels (Figure 2A-D) . Van Gieson staining showed that the elastic fibres present in the submucosa had a wave-like form after day 4 indicating a small level of fibre relaxation ( Figure 2E-H) . The average thickness of the epithelium did not change significantly (P = 0AE4) for the duration of the organ culture ( Figure 3A) . A bead clearance assay was used to evaluate co-ordinated ciliary activity. Tracheal explants were tested immediately after collection and every 24 hours thereafter. Beads were cleared in less than 30 minutes in all pieces examined. However, a progressive increase in the time for complete
