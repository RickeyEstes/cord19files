A molecular diagnostic panel for detection of 12 viruses was applied to 510 lower respiratory samples from 433 adult patients hospitalized with pulmonary diseases. The most common respiratory illnesses in the patients were: COPD, 45.3%, pneumonia (30.5%) and acute respiratory illness (ARI, 17.1%); 19.6% of patients were in the intensive care unit, and 17.5% were receiving assisted ventilation (Table 1) . Two hundred and fifteen specimens (42.2%) were positive for a respiratory virus ( Table 2) . The most common viruses were HRV (32.9%), FLU-A (9.0%) and hCoV-NL63 (2.0%). The frequency of the other viruses ranged from 0.2 to 1.4%. In 30 out of 510 samples (5.9%), corresponding to 29 out of 433 patients (6.7%), more than one virus was detected. Multiple detection included HRV + FLU-A (2.9% of total samples), HRV + FLU-B and HRV + hCoV-NL63 (0.6% each combina- tion), HRV + hCoV-OC43 (0.4%), HRV + AdV, HRV + PIV-1, HRV + RSV, FLU-A + hCoV-OC43, AdV + hCoV-NL63, HRV + FLU-A + PIV-1 and HRV + FLU-A + AdV (0.2% each combination). The association with the sample type (either EA, or SP, or BAL) could be evaluated only for the most frequent viruses, i.e. FLU-A and HRV, showing that HRV, and not FLU-A, was unevenly distributed (more frequent in SP and BAL than in EA, Table 2 ). Data on the smoking status was available for 403/433 patients: the frequency of patients positive to any virus was similar in smokers and non-smokers (49.4% vs. 50.6%, p = 0.742), and the frequency of individual viruses did not significantly differ according to the smoker status (for instance, HRV positive patients were 42.2% in smokers and 34.5% in non-smokers, p = 0.137). In addition, similar frequencies of virus-positive samples were obtained when comparing patients with COPD vs. patients without COPD (57.1% vs. 56.7%); patients with pneumonia vs. subjects with no record of pneumonia (54.4% in both cases); or patients with ARI vs. subjects without ARI (44.7% vs. 51.5%, p = 0.342). In addition, the frequency of virus-positive samples did not significantly differ among patients with pneumonia, COPD and ARI (p = 0.207). The monthly distribution of respiratory agents over the study period (Fig. 1) highlights a peak in January-February for HRV and FLU-A.
