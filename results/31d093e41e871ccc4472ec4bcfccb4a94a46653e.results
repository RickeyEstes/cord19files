Because of illnesses and severe injuries (fractures) as a result of capture stress, 7 animals had to be removed at various times throughout the study; one animal (K06) in the transmission group and 6 animals (K26, K25, K30, K37, K44, K45) in the vaccination groups between 26 and 78 days prior to infection (Tables 1-3) . As a release of those animals back into the wild could not be justified, for reasons of animal welfare they had to be humanely euthanized. None of the animals showed clinical signs suggestive of rabies. Transmission studies. While all four animals (K02, K12, K13, K18) inoculated with the high dose Kudu RABV isolate (10 5.3 TCID 50 ) were seronegative at B0 and succumbed to infection between day 12 and 16 p.i., all but one low dose infected (10 3.3 TCID50) Kudus (K03, K15, K16) died or had to be euthanized between day 93 and 245 p.i. (Table 1, Fig. 4) . Two of the latter animals (K15, K16) had rabies specific antibodies at B0 (Tables 2,  S2 ). The Kudu (K21) that survived the low dose challenge virus infection seroconverted at day 261 p.i. Clinical signs included swallowing movements associated with moderate salivation, paresis, and mild frothing at the mouth in two cases. The remaining animals in the group mostly tried to stay away from and avoid contact with those displaying clinical signs. Six animals that succumbed to the infection were FAT positive while two were regarded FAT inconclusive, with the latter two being positive in RT-qPCR. All but two of the contact animals survived the 261 days observation period. Two of 12 contact animals died 99 (K11) and 156 days p.i. (K05), however, only in the latter were viral antigen and RNA detected by FAT and PCR, respectively (Tables 1, 2, Fig. 4) . Sequencing of the RABV isolate of the FAT positive contact animal revealed a 100% sequence identity with the challenge virus including the insertion. Of the 11 survivors (Tables 1, 2, Fig. 4 ), three contact animals (K17, K19, K20) were rated antibody positive at B0 and remained seropositive during the observation period of 261 days. Contrastingly, three out of 8 surviving contact animals (K04, K08, K10) were considered seronegative at the beginning of the study but seroconverted (Tables 2, S2) . S3, Fig. 5 ). There was a significant difference (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.0031) in the parenteral versus the DOA vaccinated group. In general, with < 31.4% the DOA vaccinated animals showed only a 1.3 fold increase in ELISA mean PB values at days 28 and 56 p.v. compared to day 0 and remained below the ELISA cut-off of positivity. Though there was a 1.7-2.0 fold increase compared to day 0 the GMT of VNAs of orally vaccinated animals remained below 0.5 IU/ml until challenge (Tables 3, S3, Fig. 5) . Only 3 of 10 Kudus (K40, K43, K46) vaccinated by the oral route survived the challenge (30%) ( Table 2 , Fig. 4 ). While two of these animals remained seronegative prior to infection, one Kudu (K46) had detectable levels of antibodies at the time point of capture but turned seronegative at days 28 and 56 p.v.. After challenge infection all three survivors developed high levels of rabies specific antibodies; the GMT of these individual animals increased to 1.27 IU/ml at day 183 p.i., resembling a 5.8 and 2.9 fold increase compared to day 0 and day 56 p.v., respectively (Tables 3, S3, Fig. 5 ). Of the 7 initially seronegative (B0, time point of capture) DOA vaccinated Kudu that succumbed to infection, two animals (K35, K36) developed rabies specific antibodies p.v.. All animals died between 12 and 26 days p.i. (Table 1, Fig. 4 ). Six animals were FAT-positive, while one FAT-negative animal tested positive in rt-PCR. There was no (Log-rank/Mantel-Cox test, p = 0.0786) difference in the survival curves of orally vaccinated vs. high dose infected animals from the transmission study.
