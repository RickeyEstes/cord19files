Silencing proteasome subunits results in a reduction in WNV FLuc, but not VEEV FLuc, activity To aid in identifying host proteins that facilitate WNV infection and/or genome amplification, a library of siRNAs was screened for its ability to suppress firefly luciferase (FLuc) signal encoded by WNV viral replicon particles (VRPs) (Fayzulin et al., 2006) . VRPs are replicons (viral genomes lacking the sequences for the structural genes) packaged into particles with structural proteins that are provided in trans by packaging cells. WNV VRPs are particularly useful as they mimic WNV infection and genome amplification in nearly all aspects; however, because the packaged replicons do not encode the structural genes, VRP infections do not produce progeny virions. Thus, VRPs can be used to easily study infection and/or genome amplification independent of assembly and release. Additionally, because they are unable to spread beyond the initially infected cell, VRPs are safe to use under biosafety level 2 (BSL2) conditions. The siRNA library utilized for these studies was a human druggable genome library purchased from Ambion that consisted of 3 individual siRNAs designed to silence approximately 5500 genes. Huh7 cells stably expressing Renilla luciferase (RLuc) were transfected with each siRNA (30 μM), infected with the WNV VRP expressing FLuc (WNV FLuc VRP) 72 h later, and then assayed for both FLuc (WNV VRP infection/genome amplification) and RLuc (cell number) activity 24 h post infection. These studies identified 50 candidate genes for which transfection of 2 of the 3 individual siRNAs into Huh7 cells resulted in a greater than 60% reduction in RLuc-normalized WNV-dependent FLuc activity and did not result in a reduction in RLuc activity of greater than 40% (data to be published elsewhere). To validate the 50 candidate genes obtained from screening the 5500 gene library, several confirmatory tests were performed utilizing the siRNAs corresponding to these 50 genes. The three individual siRNAs for each of the 50 genes were assayed for inhibition of WNV FLuc VRP activity in 3 additional human cell lines (HeLa, Hec1B and SK-N-SH cells), and also tested for their ability to reduce βgalactosidase (β-gal) activity encoded by a WNV β-gal VRP (Fayzulin et al., 2006) and to reduce antigen synthesis by 'live' WNV. To ensure that the candidate genes were important specifically for WNV infection, siRNA-transfected cells were infected with a FLuc-encoding Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) VRP and tested for the ability of the siRNAs to inhibit the infection and/or genome amplification of this alphavirus. As a final confirmation, pools of 4 individual siRNAs targeted against each candidate gene were purchased from a second source (Dharmacon) and assayed in the Huh7 cells. These secondary screens resulted in approximately 10 confirmed candidate genes (data to be published elsewhere). Interestingly, 2 of these 10 confirmed candidate genes were subunits of the proteasome. In fact, 2 of 3 individual siRNAs (Ambion) and the pools of 4 siRNAs (Dharmacon) targeted against two alpha subunits, PSMA1 and PSMA2, were shown to consistently reduce WNV infection or genome amplification (N60% decrease in RLuc-normalized FLuc activity) when transfected into cells with little or no effect on cell number. Fig. 1A shows an example of a typical silencing experiment showing that transfection of a pool of 4 siRNAs (Dharmacon) targeted against either PSMA1 or PSMA2 dramatically lowered WNV replicondriven FLuc activity compared to cells transfected with a nontargeting control siRNA (NEG; Fig. 1A ). However, VEEV replicondriven FLuc activity was not impaired following transfection with either PSMA1 or PSMA2-specific siRNA (Fig. 1A) , indicating the specificity of the siRNA interference. Additionally, although FLucspecific siRNAs reduced FLuc expression derived from both WNV and VEEV VRPs, siRNAs targeted against the WNV genome were, as expected, specific for WNV replicon-driven FLuc activity (Fig. 1A ). Transfection with PSMA1 or PSMA2 siRNAs also resulted in a greater than 60% reduction in WNV antigen expression following 'live' WNV infection (data not shown). To confirm the effectiveness of the siRNAs, Western blot analysis was performed on the siRNA-transfected cell lysates. Analysis indicated that transfection of PSMA1 or PSMA2 siRNA resulted in reduced PSMA1 and PSMA2 expression, respectively, compared to NEG control or WNV-specific siRNA transfection (Fig. 1B) . Interestingly, transfection of either PSMA1-specific or PSMA2-specific siRNAs resulted in decreased expression of both subunits, although the expression of the specific target gene always demonstrated greater knockdown. Even so, the silencing of one subunit had an effect on the steady state levels of the other subunit of the proteasome, possibly through the destruction of subunits that are not stabilized by their assembly into the multi-molecule complex or by the ability of one or more of the siRNAs targeted against PSMA1 will also partially recognize PSMA2, and vice versa. To demonstrate a corresponding decrease in WNV antigen expression following the silencing of PSMA1 or PSMA2, membranes were also probed with a WNV-specific antibody. Results showed a dramatic reduction in the expression of WNV NS3 following transfection with PSMA1, PSMA2 or WNV siRNAs compared to transfection with the NEG siRNA (Fig. 1B) .
