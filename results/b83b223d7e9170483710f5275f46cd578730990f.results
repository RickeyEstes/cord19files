The SARS epidemic was an unpredictable and inevitable time frame during which nurses were required to be involved. It not only challenged their personal psychosocial and professional readiness but also forced them to deal with new and different situations that involved diverse responses to the individuals who were present during this disaster. The first-layer findings of this study regarding nurses' difficulties were sought and organized according to three stages of the caring process: precaring, tangible caring, and postcaring. The results revealed that each stage reflected on the background context of this sophisticated phenomenon, and they were approached as such noting that these stages are continuous rather than three static ones.
