In this section we study the model's implications for business cycle synchronization. To quantify the degree of business cycle synchronization, we focus on the cross-country correlation of quarterly HP-filtered fluctuations in output in the tradeable sector z T it , which we denote as corr z T . We focus on correlations for tradeable sectors because our model is designed to study the role of trade in business cycle synchronization and abstracts from considerations that are important for understanding correlations of total GDP, such as cross-country and cross-sector comovement of aggregate shocks. We examine, for our range of parameter values, how corr z T varies with the share of trade in country 2's tradeable output s X 2 , and with the share of production sharing in country 2's exports, s P 2 . We first fix the share of trade in country 1's tradeable output (s X 1 ) at 5%, and vary s X 2 and s P 2 separately. We then consider regressions of the form discussed in Section 2 using artificial data generated by the model where we jointly vary s X 1 , s X 2 , and s P 2 at the levels of the grids defined above. Result 1. Fixing s P 2 , corr z T is increasing in s X 2 and fixing s X 2 ; corr z T is increasing in s P 2 : Fig. 3 , panel A, displays the relation between s X 2 (x-axis) and corr z T (y-axis) for different values of s P 2 . Each vertical cluster of dots represents the range of corr z T for various levels of s P 2 ; holding the overall level of trade in country 2 (s X 2 ) constant. We focus first on the impact of trade volume on bilateral correlations. The plot shows that for any level of s P 2 there is a positive relationship between the correlation and the volume of trade. For example, for s P 2 ¼ 5% (represented by the lowest dot in each vertical cluster), an increase in s X 2 from 1% to 30% (moving along the x-axis) raises corr z T from 0:03 to 0:1. To understand how an increase in trade volume, all else constant, leads to higher output correlations, consider a positive productivity shock in country 1. For simplicity, here we abstract from the vertically integrated composite by assuming o ¼ 1. Firms in country 1 produce more final output, which requires
