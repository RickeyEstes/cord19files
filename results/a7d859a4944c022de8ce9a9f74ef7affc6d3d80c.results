Between Feb 17, and July 22, 2016, we sequentially enrolled 75 participants, 25 assigned to each dose group (figure 1). Participant demographic characteristics are in table 1. Reasons for non-enrolment are in the appendix (p 10), including 15 individuals who were excluded for increases in creatine phosphokinase related to vigorous exercise regimens. Mean age of participants was 32·2 years (SD 9·3). Ten participants were excluded from the per-protocol analysis because they did not complete all study visits (figure 1). 67 (89%) of the enrolled participants completed the entire three-dose vaccination series (figure 1). The most common adverse events were injection-site reactions, reported in 70 participants (93%) of 75. 73 participants (97%) of 75 reported at least one solicited adverse event (table 2; appendix p 3). One or more injection-site reactions were reported by 92% or more participants in all dose groups. Systemic reactions were reported by 32% of participants in the 0·67 mg group, 62% in the 2 mg group and 32% in the 6 mg dose group. The most common solicited systemic adverse event was headache, followed by malaise or fatigue, and myalgia; most solicited adverse events were mild in all groups. One participant in the 6 mg dose group reported one episode of severe induration following the third vaccination that resolved within 24 h. One serious adverse event was reported: a second-degree burn reported to have occurred 15 days after the third vaccination. The participant provided no further information and did not return for follow-up. The principal investigator deemed the incident as unrelated to study treatment. There were no grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormalities that were related to study treatment. Laboratory abnormalities were uncommon, except for 15 increases in creatine phosphokinase occurring in Figure 1 : Trial profile Ten participants did not complete the vaccination series: four relocated, three were lost-to-follow-up, two became pregnant during the study, and one declined the final vaccination. 25 2A) . Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 48 participants (66%) of 73 at week 4 just before the second vaccination, and in 59 (86%) of 69 at week 12 just before the third vaccination. There were no differences in S1-ELISA response rates between dose groups from week 4 onward (figure 2, appendix p 12). S1-ELISA seroconversion was also noted 0·67 mg GLS-5300 (n=25) 2 mg GLS-5300 (n=25) 6 mg GLS-5300 (n=25) Total (n=75) in 59 participants (86%) of 69 after two vaccinations and in 61 (94%) of 65 after three vaccinations. S1 ELISA seroreactivity was maintained in 52 participants (79%) of 66 up to study end at week 60. There was a significant difference in S1-ELISA geometric mean endpoint titres between dose groups at week 1, with none thereafter ( figure 2, appendix pp 13, 14) . A similar pattern of antibody responses was noted when measured by full-length S-ELISA, with 58 vaccinated participants (92%) of 63 seroconverting at week 14 and 38 (58%) of 66 maintaining through week 60 (appendix 4). Neutralising antibodies against MERS coronavirus EMC-2012 infection of Vero cells were detected in 27 participants (43%) of 63 at week 14 and 25 (39%) of 65 at week 24, but only two (3%) of 66 maintained neutralisation activity to end of study. Overall, 34 participants (50%) of 68 had detectable neutralising antibodies at one or more timepoints during the study. Half-maximal neutralising geometric mean endpoint titres peaked at week 14 with a range between 7·9 and 508 ( figure 2B ). Pearson's correlation of S1-ELISA and neutralising titres was r²=0·8855 and full-length S-ELISA correlation with neutralisation was r²=0·0669 (appendix 4).
