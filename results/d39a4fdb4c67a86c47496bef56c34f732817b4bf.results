SFSV NSs inhibits IFN induction. SFSV NSs expressed by recombinant RVFV was previously shown to inhibit the upregulation of the IFNB gene (44, 45) . Accordingly, infection with parental SFSV strain Sabin resulted in only limited upregulation of IFN-␤ mRNA, as measured by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Fig. 1A) . As controls, we used RVFV strain MP12 (expressing a functional RVFV NSs) and clone 13 (expressing an internally deleted RVFV NSs) in parallel (33) , which suppressed and activated IFN induction, respectively, in the expected manner. Unlike RVFV, neither a natural nor a recombinant NSs-deficient strain is available for SFSV. In order to abort NSs function, we designed a pool of four small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that specifically target the NSs gene sequence. The efficiency of the siRNAs was tested by cotransfection of an expression plasmid for 3ϫFLAG-tagged SFSV NSs and either the NSs-targeting siRNA pool or a control siRNA. The specific siRNAs caused a significant reduction of SFSV NSs RNA levels in RT-PCR and a complete loss of the FLAG signal in immunoblot analysis, while the control siRNA had no effect (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, RNA and protein levels of the 3ϫFLAG-tagged NSs of PTV-A were not affected, confirming the specificity of the siRNA pool for SFSV NSs. We then combined transfection of the NSs-specific siRNA pool with infection by either SFSV or RVFV MP-12, followed by RT-qPCR analysis. Of note, in infected cells the siRNA pool as well as the PCR primers can target not only the NSs transcript but also the entire S genome segment. Therefore, we could not determine whether only the NSs mRNA was affected by the siRNAs or whether the viral genome was also affected. However, due to encapsidation of the genome, we expect a certain level of protection, which in turn would result in an underestimation of siRNA effects on NSs transcripts. In any case, a substantial depletion of NSs sequence-containing RNA species (fold reduction, 3.3 Ϯ 0.3) was observed (Fig. 1C) . Moreover, in the presence of the NSs-specific siRNAs, SFSV infection upregulated the amounts of IFN-␤ transcripts (fold increase, 5.1 Ϯ 2.6) (Fig. 1D) , despite the fact that virus replication (measured via analysis of L segment levels) was diminished (fold reduction, 2.0 Ϯ 0.42) (Fig. 1E) . For RVFV MP12, in contrast, the SFSV NSs-specific siRNAs affected neither the IFN-␤ mRNA levels (Fig. 1C ) nor the accumulation of its S segment (Fig. 1F) . The same applied to clone 13, TOSV, and the closely related sandfly fever Turkey virus (data not shown), demonstrating both the specificity of the siRNA pool and its effect on the induction of IFN-␤ by SFSV. Furthermore, no intrinsic IFN-stimulatory activity of the siRNA pool was observed in the mock samples (Fig. 1C) . Taking into consideration the opposing effects of the siRNA on IFNB induction and on SFSV replication, a normalized fold induction of 9.8 Ϯ 3.7 was calculated for IFNB, compared to 1.0 Ϯ 0.4 for RVFV (Fig. 1G, right column) . Of note, the impairment of SFSV replication by the NSs-specific siRNA was far less pronounced in IFN-incompetent Vero B4 cells (data now shown), indicating that it was largely mediated by the antiviral IFN system rather than by interference with the integrity of the genomic S segment. In summary, siRNA knockdown of SFSV NSs resulted in simultaneous upregulation of IFN induction and downregulation of SFSV replication in IFN-competent cells, reminiscent of the behavior of NSs-deficient phleboviruses. Together with the data from recombinant NSs-expressing RVFV (44, 45) , this validates the identification of SFSV NSs as an IFN induction antagonist. SFSV NSs acts in a nondegradative manner. Many pathogenic phleboviruses are known to counteract the IFN response by diminishing the levels of key host factors (3) . The NSs of RVFV induces proteasomal degradation of cellular proteins such as TFIIH-p62 (to block IFN induction) and protein kinase R (PKR) (to prevent the antiviral action of IFN) (35, 44, (46) (47) (48) . The NSs of TOSV was also shown to cause PKR degradation and to block IFN induction by decreasing RIG-I levels (39, 49) . We investigated whether the NSs protein of SFSV might execute a similar form of degradative activity on host proteins. As controls, we employed TOSV NSs and RVFV NSs, and we also included the so far hpi, and analyzed by RT-qPCR analysis for IFNB (n ϭ 4; mean Ϯ SD). (B) A549 cells were cotransfected with expression constructs for 3ϫFLAG-tagged SFSV or PTV-A NSs and nontargeting control siRNA or SFSV NSs-specific siRNA. Samples were subjected to RT-PCR analysis (upper panels) and immunoblotting using anti-FLAG and anti-tubulin antibodies (lower panel) 24 h after transfection. To exclude amplification of NSs sequences from plasmid DNA, a duplicate set of reactions was performed without the reverse transcription step (no RT). (C to F) A549 cells were pretransfected with control or SFSV NSs-targeting siRNA and infected with SFSV or RVFV MP12 at an MOI of 1. RNA was isolated 12 hpi for RT-qPCR analysis for NSs-containing RNA (C), IFNB (D), the L segment of SFSV (E), and the S segment of RVFV MP12 (n ϭ 3; means Ϯ SD) (F). (G) Summary of the relative fold induction data depicted in panels C to F, normalized to the mock sample pretreated with control siRNA as well as the fold induction of IFNB in siNSs-treated cells over siCTRL-treated cells that occurred in a manner independent of the viral burden (means Ϯ SD). n.a., not applicable. little-investigated PTV NSs, which is known to inhibit host cell transcription (45) . For PTV, there are two distinct strains, namely, Adames (PTV-A) and Balliett (PTV-B), which strongly and weakly suppress IFN induction, respectively (45, 50) . To directly compare the degradative capacities of the NSs proteins of RVFV, TOSV, SFSV, PTV-A, and PTV-B, we infected A549 cells with recombinant RVFV encoding the respective NSs genes and monitored the intracellular levels of the known phleboviral targets TFIIH-p62, PKR, and RIG-I, as well as of the central RIG-I signaling factors MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3. As shown in Fig 2A, levels of TFIIH-p62 were reduced only by RVFV NSs. Moreover, and in agreement with previous studies (44, 45, 49) , PKR levels were decreased upon expression of the NSs of RVFV and TOSV but not by those of SFSV and PTV. RIG-I levels were left unchanged by the NSs of RVFV or PTV-A, strongly decreased by the NSs of TOSV, and upregulated after infection with the recombinant RVFV expressing NSs of SFSV (weakly) or PTV-B (strongly). In fact, in the presence of PTV-B NSs the upregulation of RIG-I was indistinguishable from the level seen with the NSs-deficient control virus rZHΔNSs. The levels of MAVS, TBK1, and IRF3 were not affected by any of the NSs proteins. These results were confirmed in cells infected with the parental SFSV strain Sabin (Fig. 2B) . Thus, the NSs proteins of SFSV and PTV do not degrade the host targets of other phleboviruses. SFSV NSs inhibits the IRF branch of IFN induction. For our further investigations, we focused on the NSs of SFSV but also included those of RVFV (as a well-characterized control) and PTV. To interrogate their activity on IFN induction, we performed luciferase reporter assays. Human HEK293 cells were transfected with increasing amounts of expression plasmids encoding the respective NSs proteins, along with a reporter construct harboring the firefly luciferase (FF-Luc) gene under the control of the IFN-␤ promoter and a constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase (R-Luc) plasmid for normalization. Activation of the IFN-␤ promoter was stimulated by cotransfection of a MAVS cDNA plasmid. As expected, overexpression of MAVS strongly activated the IFN-␤ promoter, which was undisturbed by increasing doses of the N terminus of the human MxA protein (ΔMx [35] ) which was used as a negative control (Fig. 3A) . Expression of the NSs proteins of RVFV, SFSV, and PTV-A, in contrast, suppressed the promoter in a dose-dependent manner. PTV-B NSs showed only a partial effect in response to large plasmid amounts, in line with previous observations (50) . The IFN-␤ promoter contains several positive regulatory domains (PRDs), among which PRDI binds transcription factors of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family and PRDII binds NF-B (51, 52) . Reporter assays showed that the inhibitory effect of SFSV NSs on the PRDI promoter element was comparable to that seen with the full IFN-␤ promoter but that PRDII activity was inhibited only weakly ( Fig. 3B and C). This is in contrast to the NSs of PTV-A, which, like the RVFV NSs, inhibited the two PRD reporters indiscriminately. As similar results were obtained when TBK1 was used for stimulation instead of MAVS (data not shown), we concluded that SFSV NSs specifically targets the IRF branch of IFN induction at the level of TBK1 or further downstream, whereas PTV-A NSs blocks IFN induction in a broad manner, as shown previously (45) . SFSV NSs interacts with IRF3 in a highly specific manner. Previously, we took part in a large proteomics screen to identify host cell interactors of viral IFN antagonists that included SFSV NSs (53) . The SFSV NSs cDNA, equipped with the sequence for a C-terminal tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag, was inserted into recombinant RVFV to replace the RVFV NSs gene (rRVFVΔNSs::NSs SFSV -CTAP). 293T cells were infected with this recombinant virus, tandem affinity purification was performed, and protein complexes were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Strikingly, IRF3 was among the host cell interactors of SFSV NSs, which is compatible with the results of our reporter assays. In order to test the data obtained by mass spectrometry, , as well as stimulation-dependent firefly luciferase (FF-Luc) and constitutively active Renilla luciferase reporters. Firefly luciferase was under the control of (A) the entire IFN-␤ promoter (n ϭ 3; means Ϯ SD), (B) IRF-driven PRDI (n ϭ 3; means ϮSD), or (C) NF-B-driven PRDII (n ϭ 3; means Ϯ SD). Cell lysates were harvested 24 h after transfection for dual-luciferase assays. Firefly reporter activities were normalized to the Renilla reporter activities, and the positive controls were set to 100% prior to calculating means and SD across biological replicates. we performed pulldown analyses. An enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-IRF3 fusion protein was coexpressed with the recombinant 3ϫFLAG-tagged NSs of SFSV, RVFV, PTV-A, or PTV-B or with the negative-control ΔMx. Cell lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation using a plate coated with a nanobody directed against GFP. The NSs proteins of RVFV and PTV-A negatively affected the coexpression of eGFP-IRF3 ( Fig. 4 and data not shown), but eGFP-IRF3 was enriched in all GFP precipitates nonetheless. SFSV NSs clearly coprecipitated with eGFP-IRF3 but not with eGFP alone. In contrast, neither of the other phleboviral NSs proteins interacted with eGFP-IRF3. Similar results were also observed in an inverse setting; i.e., SFSV NSs was able to pull down eGFP-IRF3 (or hemagglutinin-IRF3 [HA-IRF3]), while PTV-A and ΔMx were not (data not shown). This confirms our earlier mass spectrometry data (53) and demonstrates that SFSV NSs is unique among the tested phleboviral proteins in its interaction with IRF3. We extended our assays to include other members of the IRF family. IRF7 is the family member most closely related to IRF3 in both sequence and function (31) . However, SFSV NSs did not coprecipitate with eGFP-IRF7 (Fig. 5A) . Likewise, eGFP-IRF2, eGFP-IRF5, and eGFP-IRF9 did not interact with SFSV NSs (Fig. 5B) . Hence, we conclude that SFSV NSs selectively targets the immediate early-acting IFN transcription factor IRF3. SFSV NSs does not inhibit IRF3 activation. In uninfected cells, IRF3 localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm. Upon activation, IRF3 becomes phosphorylated by TBK1/IKK, dimerizes, and accumulates in the nucleus, where it associates with the transcriptional cofactors CBP and p300 (52, (54) (55) (56) (57) . Transiently expressed SFSV NSs, on the other hand, localized diffusely to both the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm (data not shown), suggesting that it could interfere with IRF3 activation or function at any level. We thus simultaneously investigated the three classic hallmarks of IRF3 activation in SFSV-infected cells. First, immunoblot analysis showed that IRF3 phosphorylation was affected neither in SFSV-infected cells (Fig. 6A ) nor in cells infected with a recombinant RVFV expressing SFSV NSs (Fig. 6B) . The latter experiment also demonstrated that PTV NSs was acting downstream of IRF3 phosphorylation. Also, IRF3 dimerization (Fig. 6C ) and virus-triggered accumulation in the nucleus (Fig. 6D) were not impaired by SFSV infection. Thus, SFSV-like RVFV, which was used as a control (33)-was not preventing phosphorylation, dimerization, or nuclear localization of IRF3. We tested the impact of SFSV NSs on specific IRF3 mutants. IRF3(5D) is constitutively active and dimerized due to phosphomimetic aspartate residues that replace five serine and threonine phosphorylation sites in the region from amino acid (aa) 395 to aa 407 (54, 55) . SFSV NSs was able to inhibit both IFN induction and PRD I activation by IRF3(5D) (Fig. 7A and B) , just like the NSs of PTV-A, which was used in parallel. SFSV NSs, however, was additionally able to pull down IRF3(5D) (Fig. 7C ). SFSV NSs also interacted with IRF3 mutants that are deficient in dimerization, namely, IRF3(S385A/S386A) (58) (Fig. 7D ) as well as IRF3(S385A/S386A-R211A/R213A) and IRF3(S385A/S386A-R285A/ H288A/H290A), further derivatives with additional mutations of essential arginine and histidine residues within the dimerization interface (data not shown). In summary, these experiments demonstrated that SFSV NSs inhibits a molecular step that takes place after the nuclear importation of activated IRF3 but prior to IRF3-driven transcription and that the interaction interface on IRF3 is accessible in both the inactive and the active states. SFSV NSs interacts with the DNA-binding domain of IRF3. IRF3 possesses an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD; aa 1 to 113) (59) which also contains the bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS; K77/R78 and R86/K87) (60, 61) , followed by an activation domain comprising the nuclear export signal (NES; aa 139 to 150) (52, 60), a proline-rich domain (Pro; aa 150 to 190), an IRF association domain (IAD; aa 190 to 384) (62) , and a serine-rich domain (SR; aa 384 to 427) that is phosphorylated upon activation (63) (Fig. 8A ). Crystal structures of the C-terminal portion of IRF3 (aa 173/175 to 427) indicate that IRF3 phosphorylation induces a marked conformational change in the IAD, resulting in the exposure of residues that facilitate dimerization and the interaction with CBP/p300 (58, 64, 65) . We employed systematic deletion analysis to map the IRF3 domain that is bound by SFSV NSs. As a first step, we cut GFP-tagged IRF3 into two halves at position 190. As shown in Fig. 8B , only the N-terminal part, ranging from aa 1 to 190, was able to pull down NSs. We then removed the remaining domains from this fragment one by one in the C-to N-terminal direction. In this way, we found that the N-terminal DBD alone (aa 1 to 113) was sufficient for binding SFSV NSs (Fig. 8C) . Unfortunately, fine mapping by further C-terminal deletions was inconclusive, as were our attempts to map the corresponding IRF3-interacting region within SFSV NSs (data not shown). SFSV NSs prevents IRF3 from binding to the IFN promoter. We hypothesized that SFSV NSs might interfere with the promoter-binding activity of IRF3. To investigate this, we established an assay in which we used biotinylated IFN-␤ promoter oligonucleotides to pull down MAVS-activated IRF3 via the use of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. eGFP-IRF3 and MAVS were coexpressed in HEK293 cells either on their own or together with increasing doses of 3ϫFLAG-tagged SFSV NSs or the negative-control ΔMx. As observable in the input samples, overexpressed MAVS induced the phosphorylation and dimerization of eGFP-IRF3, as expected (Fig. 9 , left panels, and data not shown). The presence of SFSV NSs did not affect IRF3 activation, confirming our observations of SFSV-infected cells. Analyzing the precipitated proteins (Fig. 9 , right panels), we detected activated eGFP-IRF3 but not eGFP, indicating specific binding to the IFN-␤ promoter oligonucleotide. Furthermore, no protein precipitation was observed when empty beads without the biotinylated oligonucleotide were used (data not shown). The sequence specificity of eGFP-IRF3 binding was confirmed by the addition of an excess of nonbiotinylated IFN-␤ promoter oligonucleotide, which strongly diminished eGFP-IRF3 binding, whereas a scrambled control oligonucleotide had no such effect. Importantly, coexpression of SFSV NSs reduced the amount of promoter-bound eGFP-IRF3 in a dose-dependent manner, but the control protein ΔMx had no influence. Of note, SFSV NSs did not coprecipitate with the promoter oligonu- cleotide, indicating the absence of intrinsic or indirect DNA-binding activity. Thus, we conclude that SFSV NSs stoichiometrically impairs the binding of IRF3 to the IFN-␤ promoter by covering essential amino acid residues within the DBD.
