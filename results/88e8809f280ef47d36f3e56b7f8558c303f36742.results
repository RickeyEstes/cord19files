The total number of people attending the education sessions was 140. This included 65 students from 2nd, 4th and 7th semester. 18 faculty members attended and 57 support staff. While the sessions were mandatory, not all staff, students and faculty attended. Faculty members who did not attend were asked to prepare sessions for their students on MERS-CoV using the material collected by the Task Force or other materials. Two policies were created to guide the College Executive Committee in making decisions during the epidemic. One policy guided staff on when they should return to work after displaying symptoms during the epidemic. The other established protocol around when students should be pulled from clinical placements. All students and staff were exposed to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health videos, posters, and handouts. 20 posters from the Ministry of Health on MERS-CoV prevention were placed throughout the building in elevators, washrooms, hallways, library, etc. Students were directed to use the MERS-CoV Ministry of Health hotline if they had any questions, to refer to the World Health Organization's and the Ministry of Health KSA. It was emphasized that these website have accurate updates. Students were also encouraged to increase the use of hand sanitizer and wash their hands frequently. Over 200 pamphlets created by the Task Force outlining the pertinent information on MERS-CoV for nursing students and staff were handed out during sessions or distributed through other means (classrooms, student lobby, etc.).
