Hybridization-based target enrichment enhances sensitivity of HTS for detection of virus in complex environmental samples Enhanced detection of viruses from various clinical sample types using filovirus-or respiratory virus-specific probes has recently been demonstrated [9, 10, 13] . To expand the range of viruses that could be detected, in this study those two probe panels were combined with new probes for 41 additional viruses that are of biosurveillance and biodefense concern, for a full panel targeting 83 diverse viruses (Table 1 ). In order to test this newly expanded probe panel and to specifically assess the effect of hybridization-based viral enrichment on the sensitivity of HTS for detection of a single virus within a complex environmental sample, commercial bat guano was spiked with increasing concentrations of Influenza virus (IFV). Spiked samples were split into two parts each, with each part being processed in parallel with unbiased, shotgun sequencing versus target enrichment sequencing using an expanded panel of probes. As expected, a dose-dependent effect in the proportion of sequencing reads derived from IFV was observed as the number of spiked genome copies increased ( Fig. 1a and Additional file 1: Table S1 ), in both the unbiased shotgun sequence data as well as the virus enriched sequence data. However, in this context, hybridizationbased target enrichment resulted in approximately 20-to 100-fold more sensitivity for detection of IFV as compared to detection via unbiased, shotgun sequencing. At the lowest concentration tested (1250 genome equivalents (GE) per mL), only 0.5% of sequencing reads produced by unbiased shotgun sequencing were derived from IFV ('on target' reads), whereas by stark contrast, the majority of reads produced by target enrichment sequencing (54.4%) were derived from IFV. Given the dramatic increase in sensitivity observed when complex samples were spiked with an individual virus's genetic material and subjected to target enrichment, we next sought to evaluate whether these effects would still be observed in the presence of an additional virus and at lower concentrations of IFV gRNA overall. Therefore, IFV gRNA was spiked into total RNA derived from Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) cell culture lysate at an overall lower range of increasing concentrations than IFV was spiked in the prior experiment. As before, the samples were aliquoted into two parts that were processed by each method. In these synthetic co-infection samples, target enrichment sequencing resulted in a simultaneous increase in sensitivity for both viruses as compared to unbiased, shotgun sequencing (Fig. 1b) . As expected, a constant high proportion of reads mapping to MERS-CoV was observed and the proportion of reads mapping to IFV increased in a dose-dependent fashion with the number of genome equivalents spiked (Additional file 2: Table S2 ).
