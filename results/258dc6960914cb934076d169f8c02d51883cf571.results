We recruited 79 patients with angiographically proven obstructive CAD. No patient was lost to follow up and the median follow-up was 10.6 years (IQR 9.6-10.9 years). The clinical and biochemical characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1 . The cohort comprised 65% males with a mean ± SD age of 66 ± 12 years and BMI of 27.4 ± 4.4 kg/m 2 . Patients were at significant CV risk with 69% having a smoking history, and a history of CAD in 66%, dyslipidaemia in 60%, hypertension in 82%, diabetes in 24% and AF in 11%. With regard to pharmacological therapy at the time of presentation, 59% were on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), 58% on beta-blockers, 72% on statins and 100% on aspirin. . Patients were categorized according to plasma ACE2 activity above / below the median ACE2 level. Patients with above-median plasma ACE2 activity were more likely to be male and have AF ( Table 1 , both p < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify variables that influence plasma ACE2 activity. Male gender was the only independent predictor of higher ACE2 activity (p = 0.022). The prevalence of CAD and cardiac risk factors including dyslipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes and cigarette smoking were similar in the two groups, as was LVEF <50%, the use of pharmacological agents, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides levels, kidney function and troponin level (all p > 0.05). Over the follow-up period, there were 18 deaths, 19 myocardial infarcts and 16 hospitalisations with HF. The primary endpoint of MACE, a composite of CV mortality, HF hospitalisation or MI occurred in 36 patients (46%). Above median levels of ACE2 (>29.3 pmol/ml/min) were significantly associated with a higher incidence of MACE (log-rank test, p = 0.035; Fig 1A) and HF hospitalisation (p = 0.01; Fig 1B) compared with those with below-median ACE2. There was no significant difference in the incidence of CV death (p = 0.195) or MI (p = 0.35). In a subgroup analysis including male patients only, there was no significant difference in the incidence of MACE according to median levels of ACE2 (p = 0.124). Survival analysis using the Cox regression model indicated that age, history of atrial fibrillation, history of diabetes and log ACE2 were univariate predictors of the primary endpoint of MACE. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, Log ACE2 activity remained the only significant predictor of MACE (HR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.24 to 4.72; p = 0.009) ( Table 2) . With regard to the secondary endpoint of HF, both log ACE2 (HR: 4.03; 95% CI: 1.42-11.5; p = 0.009) and age (HR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.12, p = 0.026) were independent predictors of heart failure.
