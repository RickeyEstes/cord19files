The total sample size of this study was 94 ERRPs (out of 137 ERRPs; response rate 69%). The ERRPs had a mean age of 27 years, 65% were male, and 37% were married. Fifty-six percent of the ERRPs rated their knowledge about MERS-CoV as inadequate while 63% had had direct contact with at least one patient infected with MERS-CoV (Table 1) . The majority of the ERRPs (91%) agreed that their work put them at risk of infection, but most (65%) did not agree that they should not be looking after patients infected with MERS. Despite that, 54% of ERRPs were afraid of contracting the infection from infected patients and only 4.2% of them were willing to change their current job. The majority felt that their job would expose their families (85%), parents (83%), and close friends (77%) to risk of infection (Table 2) . Table 3 summarizes the perceived impact of MERS-CoV and readiness for an outbreak. Of the ERRPs, 48% would be afraid of telling their families about the risk of exposure, 42% agreed that there would be inadequate staff in the workplace to handle the increased demand, and 42% would feel more stressed at work. Furthermore, 57% of ERRPs had received infection control training and 55% reported that their hospitals have enough infection control staff to deal with such an outbreak. There were no significant differences in level of concern by rotation except that first year training levels residents were more likely to be afraid of being infected than other training levels ( < 0.003). There were also no significant differences in terms of knowledge of MERS but respondents who had previously provided care for MERS patients were more likely to agree that the job put them at risk and were more afraid of being infected ( = 0.016 and = 0.040, respectively) (data not shown in tables).
