In our study, there were a total of 1,242 opportunities for hand hygiene by 225 individuals observed during the period from January to December 2006. Along the mouth healthcare performed by categories, compliance with hand hygiene was below the expectation ( Table 1) . Wearing of gloves occurred in all procedures within all categories. The group of the residents reached 49.4% of compliance on the 190 opportunities observed. The professor's group of reached the highest compliance, 81% of the 361 opportunities of compliance (Table 1) . Graduation students constituted the greatest numbers of caregivers. Because they work more directly with the patients, they had the highest amount of opportunities at 691, and they reached 45% of compliance (Table 1 ). In the initial opportunities-start of the shift, after snacks, meals and using the bathroom-an increased negligence was observed as compared with the subsequent opportunities such as between patients and at the end of the shift (Table 1) . Results were statistically significant when the groups were compared: professors versus residents opportunities (for hand hygiene adhered (P<.05) and the choice of water and soap for hand hygiene (P<.05)); professors versus graduation students (opportunities not adhered (P<.001)), and residents versus graduation (opportunities for hand hygiene adhered (P<.01) and not adhered (P<.001); following opportunities adhered (P<.05) and not adhered (P<.05), and the choice of water and soap for hand hygiene (P<.01)) ( Table 1) . For both residents and graduation students, the rate of compliance did not reach 50%. The subgroup of females showed the lowest adherence among all the groups, highlighting the initial compliance of female residents, where compliance did not occur at all (Table 1) . In all the compliances observed in the study, the use of water and soap was the preferred method of hand hygiene (Figure 1 ). Hand friction with alcohol immediately after using water and soap was the less-applied technique, accounting for only 9% of the opportunities (Figure 1 ).
