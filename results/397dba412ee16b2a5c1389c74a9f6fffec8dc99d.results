We will make an investigation on the conditions guaranteeing an epidemic and stability. Unlike in continuous compartmental methods where a threshold, R 0 , widely known as the reproduction number, depends on the transmissivity rate, the recovery rate and the initial number of susceptibles, we will show here that a critical value for our model depends on the infectivity parameter, α * , and the largest of the degrees of the vertices in the network. Recall that we denote the maximum degree of G by ∆. A vertex with the biggest degree represents an actor with the largest number of sexual partners. In most considered homogeneous models all actors are assumed to have the same degree, i.e., ∆. For brevity we denote the quantity ∆−1 α * ∆ by R 0 . We will prove that R 0 is a threshold for this model though it possesses no obvious direct relationship with the reproduction number for standard models.
