Patient population. We studied 57 MS patents: 42 females and 15 males. The mean age at the time of the study was 43.9 yr. There were 35 patients with a retapsing-remitring form of MS and 22 patients with a primary or secondary chronic progressive course of the disease. Controls (n = 59) had similar mean age (45.7 yr) and sex ratio as MS patients. Forty-eight patients (84%) and all controls originated from the southwest of France or from Spain. For technical reasons, some data was missing but neither the size of the MS patient group nor that of the control group was ever lower than 53. Antibody titers in MS patients and controls. Mumps antibody titers were significantly higher in MS cases than in controls; mean geometric titets were 6.31 and 5.66, respectively (p = 0.002). As shown in Table 1 , patients and controls had comparable andbody titers against the six other viruses. Antibody titers against measles were slightly higher in MS patients than in controls but the difference was not statistically significant.
