The Constitutive HERP Turnover Is Regulated by UBC6e, RNF5, UFD1, p97, and the 26S Proteasome Unlike other components of the HRD1 dislocon, such as HRD1, SEL1L, DER1, AUP1, UBXD2, BAP31, ERLIN1, ERLIN2, and others (Cambridge et al., 2011; Christianson et al., 2012) , endogenous HERP has a much shorter half-life regulated by the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) (t 1/2 of about 60 min; Figures 1A, lanes 1-5, and 1B) (Hori et al., 2004; Miura et al., 2010; Sai et al., 2003) . Consistently, HERP turnover was substantially inhibited upon inactivation of 26S proteasomes with PS-341 and remained unaffected upon cell exposure to lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine (Figures 1A, lanes 6 and 7, respectively, and 1B). To identify the components of the UPS involved in HERP turnover, we first monitored variations in the intracellular level and in the half-life of endogenous HERP upon silencing of select ER membrane-embedded E3 ubiquitin ligases. Individual silencing of HRD1, gp78, RNF103, or RNF166 or combined silencing of HRD1 and gp78 (Figures 2A, S1A , and S1B available online) did not significantly alter the intracellular level (Figures 2A, lanes 1 -4, 6, and 7, and 2B) Figures 2A, 2C , and 2E) remained unchanged upon RNF5 silencing.
