As shown in Fig. 1 , Vero cells infected with rubella virus exhibit clear changes in organelle distribution and organization, most notably recruitment of mitochondria to the perinuclear region, dissociation of the nucleolar components, and formation of dense deposits on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane, as reported previously (Lee et al., 1996) . Characteristic CVs in association with mitochondria and cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (Magliano et al., 1998) were observed. While in control, noninfected cells, mitochondria of a medium electron density were randomly distributed ( Fig. 1A) , infected cells at 16 h.p.i. had elongated mitochondria with increased electron density that clustered around CVs formed in perinuclear regions (Fig. 1B) . When low-magnification fields of cells sectioned through an equatorial plane were studied (approximately 100 control and 100 infected cells were analyzed) 73% of mitochondria in infected cells were seen attached to CVs, while only 12% of mitochondria in control cells were detected close to a vesicle or a vacuolar structure. We frequently detected Golgi stacks containing virions in close proximity to these CV-mitochondria-RER complexes; this was a novel observation (Fig. 1C ). Higher magnification of CVs ( Fig. 1D ) revealed small vesicles attached to the internal membrane surface. These vesicles (arrows in Fig. 1D ) had a diameter of roughly 30 nm and contained a dense core. The morphology and distribution of CVs were similar to those described by Kujala et al. (1999) . By 48 h.p.i., noticeable cell degeneration had occurred. At this time p.i. intact Golgi stacks were difficult to detect and numerous cells contained "empty" mitochondria ( Fig. 1E) . Rubella virus replication in BHK cells is noncytopathic, although infected BHK-21 and Vero cells produce equivalent yields of virus. No significant alterations on cellular ultrastructure were distinguished at 24 or 48 h.p.i., with the exception of the formation of numerous characteristic cytopathic vacuoles (Figs. 2A and B) which were smaller and found in higher numbers than in infected Vero cells (Fig.  2B ). These CVs were totally filled with vesicles 50 -70 nm in diameter and contained an internal small dense spot (Fig.  2C ). As in Vero cells, CVs accumulated on the perinuclear region, where the first viral particles were also distinguished (Fig. 2C) . Analysis of viral particles in Vero cells was done at four different times p.i. representative of "early" (12 and 16 h.p.i.) and "late" (24 and 48 h.p.i.) replication. Because of the relative scarcity of virions at early times we had to scan a larger number of sections (around 500 -700 infected cells per time point) than in later times. More than 400 control, noninfected Vero and BHK-21 cells were also studied to discard the potential presence of small structures of cellular origin in the locations of rubella replication and assembly (the whole study included observation of close to 5000 cells). At early times budding profiles and virus particles were detected inside Golgi stacks. These particles exhibited a predominant morphology, shown in Figs. 3A to E, with a diameter of 64.3 Ϯ 3.8 nm and a homogeneously dense interior. Some particles were still attached to the budding membrane (Figs. 3C and D), while others showed fine contacts between the internal dense material and the particle membrane (Fig. 3E) . Particles representative of a minor pop-ulation are shown in Fig. 3F . In these, the majority of the interior of the particle was occupied by a dense material, but the center was less dense and had an annular structure, most probably representing an intermediate stage in the process of core formation. The third virion morphology inside the Golgi stack is shown in Fig. 3G and consists of viral particles with an internal core clearly separated from the viral envelope. This was the morphology previously described for rubella virions; in our sections it was the only virion morphology detected in secretory vesicles and the extracellular medium and thus represents the mature particle (Fig. 3H) . At late times, coincident with significant deterioration of cell ultrastructure, the relative amount of intra-Golgi immature (uniformly dense) viral particles decreased and mature intra-and extracellular particles were the predominant class. By 48 h, the number of intracellular particles was very small and primarily extracellular virions were detected. All virion assembly detected in infected BHK cells was similar to that described in Vero cells, namely, homogeneously dense particles and particles with defined internal cores were observed inside Golgi stacks and in the perinuclear region (Figs. 3I and J), while extracellular particles were solely of the mature morphology (Fig. 3K ). Fig. 4 shows a collection of images of representative extracellular virions. In all of the extracellular particles the viral envelope was very dense and clearly delineated. Small differences in density of the viral core content were apparent (compare, for example, Figs. 4A and B with C and D) and some cores exhibited a clear geometrical contour (Fig. 4B) . In some virions some details of the core wall were distinguishable (arrow in Fig. 4E ). Dense, fibrous connections between the internal core and the viral envelope were frequently observed (arrows in Figs. 3K, 4F and 4G). These connections were more evident in distorted viral particles (arrows in Figs. 4H and I). Extracellular virions were homogeneous in size, with a diameter of 61.5 Ϯ 2.7 nm for the whole particle and 36.6 Ϯ 2.1 nm for the internal core. Table 1 summarizes a quantitative analysis of rubella viral forms and their location in cells at different times postinfection.
