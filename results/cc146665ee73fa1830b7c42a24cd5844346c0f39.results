A total of 74 patients, all from North Sulawesi, were enrolled with a clinical suspicion of CNS infection during the 18-month study period (Fig 1) . Details of clinical features, laboratory investigations, and clinical outcomes are presented in Table 1 . Forty-nine of the patients (66.2%) were male with a median age of 31 years (range 15-72). Median illness day at admission was 7 days (range 1-90), while the median duration of hospital stay was 12.5 days (range 2-51). Median duration of hospital stay was 11.5 (range 4-38) for deceased patients and 12.5 days (range 2-51) for those survived. Twenty-three patients (31.1%) were HIV-positive, while 33 (44.6%) had TB from previous medical history. Most patients (73.0%) had a high-grade fever on admission as well as headache (67.6%), altered consciousness (74.3%), or seizures (37.8%). CT scan results were abnormal in 68.9% of patients (42 out of 61) mostly with meningeal enhancement and focal brain lesions in 36.7% and 20.0% of the patients, respectively. Only 38 patients who gave consent for lumbar puncture had CSF available in sufficient quantities for viral testing, while 36 patients had only serum and/or throat swabs (Fig 1) . The CSF and serum specimens were screened with two arbovirus (alphavirus and flavivirus) and six non-arbovirus degenerate primer sets and by two serological assays (anti-DENV IgM and anti-JEV IgM). In addition, throat swab samples were tested for the six non-arbovirus panels. The viral diagnostic assays performed and viruses identified were summarized in Table 2 . A confirmed viral etiology was identified in three (HSV-1, CMV, DENV) (4.1%) and a probable/ possible association in 11 (HSV-1, JEV, EBV, EV-D68, RV-A) (14.9%) of enrolled patients. Twelve cases were identified by PCR/RT-PCR while two were identified by serology. The most common viral agent HSV-1 was identified in seven patients (9.5%). Other viruses found were EBV (n = 2, 2.7%), CMV (n = 1, 1.4%), EV-D68 (n = 1, 1.4%), RV-A (n = 1, 1.4%), DENV (n = 1, 1.6%), and JEV (n = 1, 1.6%). There were no viruses isolated from any of the CSF samples. Patients with identified viral infection were found to have lower GCS (median 10.5 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] vs 13.5 [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , P < 0.01) and higher fatality (57.1% vs 20.0%, P < 0.05) than those undiagnosed (Table 1) . In our study with a small sample size, no distinguishable clinical or laboratory characteristics were observed between the different viral agents ( Table 3) . Five of eight deaths were associated with HSV-1 infection while the remaining three were associated with EBV, CMV, and JEV infections. One HSV-1 and two EBV cases were both HIV-positive and TB history-positive, while one HSV-1 and EV-D68 were HIV-positive only. Thrombocytopenia, the hallmark of dengue fever was not present in the DENV case on admission and throughout the hospitalization based on serial hematological examination as it might not manifest by the time of neurological presentation. The leukocyte count was slightly high in admission but well within the normal range one week after admission, which was not unusual as peripheral leukocytosis was reported in an earlier study [19] . The patient had a history of fever for five days followed by decreased consciousness and general seizure for three  days before admission. Other features of dengue fever including retro-orbital pain, rashes, petechiae, and myalgia were not reported. The patient survived with mild cognitive sequelae on discharge. DENV NS1 antigen, an early marker of DENV infection, was negative in the CSF by using SD Bioline Dengue NS1 Ag rapid test kit (Standard Diagnostics, Inc., South Korea). Serum was not tested for DENV NS1 antigen due to insufficient volume. Furthermore, pan-flavivirus RT-PCR was also negative for both CSF and serum samples. The fatal JEV case identified in this study was negative for DENV IgM and experienced myalgia for 20 days accompanied by high-grade fever, seizure, altered consciousness, and skin rash for two days prior to hospitalization. CSF sample is not available from this JEV patient and an attempt to isolate the virus from the serum was not successful. Furthermore, the two EV cases (EV-D68 and RV-A) identified in this study presented to the hospital without highgrade fever or respiratory symptoms, although the EV-D68 case suffered multiple generalized seizures for 30 days prior to admission. These EV patients were discharged without any cognitive sequelae.
