The principle of guanine quenching was used to detect the amplification process in the novel rRT-LAMP. Fluorescence quenching is detectable in real time because QPrimer reduces the fluorescence once it is incorporated within the LAMP product. Thus, the fluorescence signal is at a maximum at the beginning of the amplification reaction and is quenched progressively throughout the amplification process down to a stable plateau, where it remains until the end of the reaction. On the other hand, the precipitation of magnesium pyrophosphate increases as the LAMP reaction proceeds in the turbidity-based rRT-LAMP assay (Fig. 1) . The reaction times of rRT-LAMP for IAV in the two types of LAMP detection, namely, turbidity and QPrimer, were examined. To compare the reaction times in the two formats, various concentrations of in vitro-transcribed RNA were used. The RNA detection time at each dilution point by QPrimer was earlier than that by turbidity measurements, and the detection rate of target RNAs was more stable in the novel QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP assay compared with the turbiditybased RT-LAMP assay ( Table 3 ). The analytical sensitivity of the QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP assays was observed using testing various dilutions of quantified in vitrotranscribed RNA of each target gene in triplicate. As shown in Table 4 , the assays enabled the detection of each target gene at 25-250 copies/ reaction at the lowest concentration, and no false positive results were observed for any of the negative control samples in either assay. The type/subtype specificity of the assays for IV were validated using 24 representative IAVs and IBV ( Table 2 ). The assay showed positive reactions only for each target type/subtype virus and no cross-reactivity with any other subtypes of IAV and IBV (data not shown). To assess the utility of the QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP assay for the clinical diagnosis of IV and RSV, an evaluation of 113 clinical specimens collected from patients with influenza-like illness was conducted. Table 5 summarizes the comparison of results between QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP and rRT-PCR. The QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP assays had higher than 85.0% sensitivity and 100% specificity for all targets. The average threshold cycle (Ct) values in the reference rRT-PCR assay for samples, which were positive by both QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP and rRT-PCR, were 24.9 (range, 18.6-32.7) for IAV, 26.1 (range, 18.6-33.9) for IBV, 26.2 (range, 20.9-34.1) for A/H1pdm virus, 24.0 (range, 17.8-29.1) for A/H3 virus, 23.6 (range, 19.5-32.9) for RSV A, and 28.2 (range, 21.4-37.2) for RSV B. Among the samples, 1-3 showed false negative results in the QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP assay, with Ct values between 31.0 and 39.8 in the reference rRT-PCR assay. Four specimens were co-infected with IV and RSV in this evaluation. Of these, IBV and RSV B were not detected by QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP in 1 specimen co-infected with IBV and RSV A or in 1 specimen co-infected with RSV A and RSV B. On the other hand, both pathogens were detected by QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP in the other 2 specimens co-infected with RSV A and RSV B. Among the 113 specimens, 14 (12.4%) that were negative for all pathogens tested by rRT-PCR were also negative via the QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP assays. Furthermore, the QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP did not amplify RNA from specimens that contained other respiratory viruses not targeted by RT-LAMP in this study. That is, none of the samples showed false positive results via QPrimer-based rRT-LAMP assay.
