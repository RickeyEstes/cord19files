The alphavirus nonstructural protein 2 regulates genome replication fidelity. In a previous study we identified a novel mutagen- resistant variant of CHIKV nsP2 at position 641 (G641D), suggesting that nsP2 may play an important role in maintaining replication fidelity (10) . To address this possibility, we introduced this substitution into our infectious clone and measured the mutation frequencies of the resulting viral populations in multiple cell types compared to wild-type (WT) CHIKV (Fig. 1A) . This variant manifested increased fidelity in every cell type, indicating that nsP2 is indeed involved in regulating CHIKV genome fidelity. Furthermore, given that both the CHIKV high-fidelity polymerase variant nsP4 (C483Y) and the novel nsP2 (G641D) variants were isolated in the same antiviral treatment, we addressed their additive roles in resistance to the RNA mutagens ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil (Fig. 1B) . Both individual variants were resistant to each drug, and the combination of the two variants (DM) enhanced this further. We then addressed the mutation frequency of each virus in the absence (black bars) or presence (white bars) of ribavirin to examine the extent of mutagenesis (Fig. 1C) . As expected, the wild-type population was mutagenized by the drug to the greatest degree, whereas the higher-fidelity nsP4 variant resisted mutagenesis, as previously reported (10) . The nsP2 G641D single variant led to an even higher-fidelity phenotype than the nsP4 variant. Interestingly, the nsP2 and nsP4 double mutant completely resisted the mutagenic activity of ribavirin. These data suggest that these two proteins work together to regulate fidelity by nonredundant mechanisms, so the nsP2 mutation may have been selected based on the antimetabolic activities of ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil. Given the seemingly synergistic role of nsP2 and nsP4 in regulating fidelity, we sought to determine whether the nsP2 fidelityincreasing mutation could compensate for the low-fidelity activity of a mutator variant of the nsP4 polymerase ( Fig. 1D and E) . To analyze this, we took advantage of a previously identified nsP4 variant C483G that has an increased mutation frequency and found that the combination of low-fidelity nsP4 with high-fidelity nsP2 yielded an intermediate mutation frequency, further suggesting these two viral components both contribute to replication fidelity. Finally, we were interested in whether this novel function of nsP2 was conserved among the alphavirus genus. A protein alignment of the alphavirus nsP2 revealed that CHIKV and a close relative, O'nyong nyong virus (ONNV), also contain a glycine at this corresponding position, whereas other alphaviruses contain a glutamic acid (Fig. 2A) . Interestingly, the increase in fidelity observed in G641D was conferred by a change to negatively charged aspartic acid, mirroring the charge of the naturally occurring glutamic acid in other alphaviruses. Therefore, we hypothesized that there is an essential requirement for a negative charge at this position for maintaining fidelity. To address this, we introduced a glutamic acid at position 641 of CHIKV and observed a decrease in mutation frequency similar to the G641D variant (Fig. 2B) . In a previous study, we had observed that SINV maintained a lower basal mutation frequency (higher native fidelity) than CHIKV (11) . When we changed the analogous residue in SINV from a glutamic acid to the glycine normally observed in CHIKV, the mutation frequency of SINV E650G nearly doubled (Fig. 2B ). In addition, we found that SINV with the nsP2 E650G change was sensitive to ribavirin treatment (Fig. 2C) , a phenotypic confirmation of reduced replication fidelity (6, 11) . Taken together, these data implicate nsP2 as a key regulator of alphavirus replication fidelity, which functions together with nsP4 to maintain genomic integrity. High-fidelity CHIKV variants have increased in vitro replicase activity and an increased access to nucleotides. To further study the role of these high-fidelity variants and their function in the viral life cycle, we determined one-step growth curves to address viral replication and RNA production and yet found no differences between these variants ( Fig. 3A and B) . This does not, however, rule out differences that may occur intracellularly or early during infection. nsP2 functions as the viral protease early during infection, cleaving the viral polyprotein in a temporal manner, which regulates multiple steps in RNA replication (35) (36) (37) . To address the kinetics of polyprotein processing, we performed pulse-chase experiments on the WT and the nsP2 G641D variant, looking specifically at the cleavage of nsP1 and nsP2 dur- ing the initial steps of infection, and yet no differences were observed ( Fig. 3C and D) . In addition to being the viral protease, nsP2 functions as a helicase and NTPase. To address these functions, we took advantage of a recently developed biochemical assay using purified nsP2 (21, 33) . We purified WT nsP2 and the G641D variant and found no difference in protein purity by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4A ) or protein folding by circular dichroism spectroscopic analysis (Fig. 4B) , suggesting that this mutation does not affect protein structure. Next, we addressed the in vitro protease activity of nsP2 by using a substrate containing the nsP2/3 cleavage site linking two larger protein fragments (21) . We found no difference in nsP2 protease activity at 6 min (early events) or 1 h (late events), confirming our results from tissue culture pulsechase analysis (Fig. 4C) . Interestingly, when we used a more sensitive FRET based protease assay using the nsP3/4 cleavage site, we observed a slight increase in protease activity with the G641D variant ( Fig. 4C and D) . The nsP2 5A-PG variant was used as a negative control. In addition, we addressed the helicase activity of the G641D variant, and we found no difference in helicase activity in the presence or absence of ATP and Mg 2Ï© after incubation for 1 h (Fig. 5A and B) . To address this further, we performed kinetic assays to look at the early events in RNA unwinding ( Fig. 5C and   D) . Here, we found the G641D variant to present impaired helicase function early in the boost phase of unwinding and to plateau at a lower level compared to wild-type nsP2. Finally, we looked at the relative NTPase activity of these purified proteins and found that the nsP2 high-fidelity variant G641D exhibited increased NTPase activity for all NTP substrates in vitro ( Fig. 5E and F) . The 5A-PG variant was used a negative control. These data suggest that nsP2 G641D may play a role in the replication complex's ability to hydrolyze nucleotides; however, since the other nonstructural proteins have not yet been successfully biochemically purified and tested in vitro, we could not test this further. As an alternative approach, we isolated functional replication complexes by differential centrifugation from infected cells to determine the kinetics of in vitro RNA synthesis and biochemical characteristics of these complexes, which contained equal amounts of all viral proteins (Fig. 6A) . We found that highfidelity nsP4 variant C483Y and the double mutant had more rapid kinetics compared to wild-type, whereas the nsP2 variant G641D had an intermediate phenotype ( Fig. 6B and C) . These increased replication kinetics and NTPase activities of nsP2 lead us to hypothesize that the high-fidelity variants are better able to access or utilize nucleotide pools, increasing the overall rate of polymerization. Because ribavirin is known to deplete GTP pools, we hypothesized that increased polymerization in limiting NTP conditions could lead to the resistance we observe in the presence of ribavirin. To study this, we incubated isolated replication complexes in low nucleotide concentrations and addressed the amount of RNA synthesized in vitro ( Fig. 6D and E) . We found that whereas wild-type replication complex activity was reduced roughly 2-fold when nucleotides were limiting, the activity of all three high-fidelity variants was reduced to a greater extent under these conditions (Fig. 6E) . Taken together, these data suggest that high-fidelity variants of nsP4 and nsP2 may reduce their replicase activity to become more selective to nucleotide pools and replicate more efficiently even at low nucleotide concentrations. CHIKV high-fidelity replicase variants confer resistance to inhibitors of nucleoside biosynthesis. The nsP2 and nsP4 variants were selected in the presence of ribavirin, an RNA mutagen that is also a purine biosynthesis inhibitor. Therefore, we hypothesized that the antiviral effects of ribavirin on viral growth should be at least partially complemented by the addition of exogenous nucleosides. Indeed, we found that the viral growth of the highfidelity variants increased with low concentrations of guanosine, and at high concentrations all viruses, including wild type, were rescued (Fig. 7A) . As a control, we added uridine, which was unable to rescue viral growth to the extent of guanosine. These data reinforce previous studies that the antiviral effect of ribavirin contributes at two levels: at the primary level of nucleotide depletion and at the secondary level as a RNA mutagen. The results obtained by ribavirin treatment in conjunction with rescue by addition of nucleotides suggest that the nsP2 variant may have an advantage in nucleotide-depleted cells, similar to what we observed by measuring of mutation frequencies in the presence of ribavirin, and in our biochemical assays. We thus sought to determine whether these variants were resistant to other nucleotide-depleting compounds, using mycophenolic acid and brequinar, which are not nucleoside analogues. Mycophenolic acid inhibits IMPDH, acting analogously to ribavirin to deplete GTP pools. In contrast, brequinar is a compound that acts by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in pyrimidine synthesis, depleting both CTP and TTP (38, 39) . By treating cells during viral infection with each compound, we found that the high-fidelity nsP2 variant and double mutant were more resistant to both nucleotide-depleting compounds ( Fig. 7B and C) , similar to what we observed with ribavirin treatment. Interestingly, the nsP4 high-fidelity variant was not resistant to pyrimidine depletion and the addition of this variant to nsP2 G641D did not further enhance the resistance of the single nsP2 mutation, suggesting that nsP2 and nsP4 may function independently under these condi- tions. Furthermore, viral growth was restored with the addition of relevant exogenous nucleosides, whereas the addition of irrelevant nucleosides was not effective for restoring viral growth, confirming that nucleotide depletion was leading to viral attenuation. Taken together, these data show that high-fidelity variants are more resistant to nucleotide-depleting conditions and that the selection of these variants in the presence of these compounds suggests that RNA viruses can regulate their fidelity to compensate for such intracellular changes.
