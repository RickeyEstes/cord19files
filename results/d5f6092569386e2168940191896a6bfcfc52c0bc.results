Ninety initial survey requests were sent; 41 surveys (46%) were completed. Responding institutions were diverse in type, size, and geographic location. The majority (71%) of responding physicians were affiliated with academic medical centers. Other institutional affiliations included government institutions (15%), community hospitals (10%), other health care facilities (2%) (described as a freestanding children's hospital), and unanswered (2%). Responses were split between ETCs (41%), EVD assessment centers (32%), and frontline health care facilities (22%). Thirty-eight responding institutions were located in the United States: 14 (34%) in the South US Census Region, 11 (27%) in the Northeast Census Region, 7 (17%) in the West Census Region, and 6 (15%) in the Midwest Census Region. Three (7%) institutions were located in Canada. Sixteen institutions had >800 beds (39%), 13 (32%) had 400-799 beds, and 11 (29%) had <400 beds. Of the 17 institutions that were identified as designated ETCs, the majority (n = 13, 77%) had 2 beds designated to care for PUIs or patients with confirmed EVD. Two ETCs had just 1 designated bed, and 2 had 3 designated beds. Approximately half of ETCs had designated beds as part of a stand-alone unit (47%), whereas half were part of a larger unit (53%). Most institutions (n = 28; 68%) reported having a pool of 0-20 physicians who were trained and prepared to care for a PUI or patient with EVD, whereas 22% had 21-50 physicians, and only 5% had more than 50 physicians. The predominant specialties trained in the care of patients with EVD included adult infectious disease (n = 30), adult critical care (n = 29), emergency medicine (n = 25), pediatric critical care (n = 21), and pediatric infectious disease (n = 13). In all cases, only attending physicians were trained to care for a patient with EVD; fellows, residents, and students were excluded from training. The majority of institutions used both in-person training (93%) and simulations (80%) to train personnel. At the time of the survey, only 1 responding institution had cared for patients with confirmed EVD and approximately half (n = 19; 46%) of responding institutions had cared for a PUI. Nine (22%) institutions had cared for 1-2 PUIs, 4 (10%) had cared for 3-4 PUIs, 5 (12%) had cared for 5-9 PUIs, and just 1 (2%) had cared for â‰¥10 PUIs. At those institutions that had cared for PUIs, half (n = 10) had 3-4 physicians involved in the care of the PUIs, whereas 21% had only 1-2 physicians involved, 10% had 5-9 physicians involved, and 21% had â‰¥10 physicians involved. Physicians designated to care for patients with EVD were selected on a voluntary basis in most institutions (n = 32; 78%). The vast majority of physicians were not granted protected time (n = 31; 76%) nor received additional pay (n = 37; 90%) to train to care for PUIs or patients with EVD. In addition, most physicians who cared for PUIs (63%) were not removed from other clinical, educational, and/or administrative duties at the time; physicians at the institution who cared for patients with confirmed EVD also were not relieved of other duties. Finally, 9 (22%) physician respondents reported various negative consequences that resulted from their training or actual care of PUIs or patients with EVD. These are summarized in Table 2 .
