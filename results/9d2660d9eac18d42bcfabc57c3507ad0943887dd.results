Initially, mitogen titration studies were done on peripheral blood lymphocytes from 5 CPV-negative mongrel dogs to determine optimum ConA and PHA-P mitogen doses. Maximum ConA stimulation of l x l05 lymphocytes was obtained with O /ag per well (Fig. 1) . The PHA-P stock diluted to 1:10 5 per well provided maximum stimulation (Fig. 2) . In these phytomitogen studies with both ConA (Fig. 3 ) and PHA-P (Fig. 4)
