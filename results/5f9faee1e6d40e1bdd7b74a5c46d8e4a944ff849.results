Oral challenge with virulent bovine coronavirus resulted in a decrease in fecal consistency, which improved over the 7 d postchallenge data collection period ( Figure 1 ). Dietary treatment with bovine serum did not influence fecal consistency (Table 2) . Treated calves tended (P = 0.12) to be more responsive following challenge than control as measured by calf attitude (Table  2) . Decreased attitude score for all calves reached a peak on d 3 and improved to baseline values by d 7 (Figure 1 ). This improvement in calf responsiveness was reflected by a higher (P = 0.02) total feed intake by treated calves than control (Table 2) . Although coronavirus challenge resulted in clinical morbidity, there were no instances of mortality for either treatment. Calf rectal temperature tended (P = 0.06) to be lower for treated calves than control (Table 2) ; however, this difference was minor and probably of no biological significance. PCV is a common measure of hydration. Calves fed bovine serum had a higher (P < 0.01) PCV than control (Table 2) . Respiration rate was greatest on d 1 following challenge and decreased over the following 7 d (Figure 2 ). Respiration rate of treated calves tended to be lower (P = 0.06) than control (Table 2) . Starting and ending BW were similar for both treatments (Table 3) . Change in BW and daily BW gain at 14 d following challenge also was similar for both treatments (Table 3) .
