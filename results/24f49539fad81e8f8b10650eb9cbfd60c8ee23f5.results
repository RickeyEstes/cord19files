Evidence showing that the N-terminal 13aa motif of the STMV CP is obligatory for replication. The genome organization of STMV RNA and the sequence of the first N-terminal 25 aa of the CP gene are shown in Fig. 1A . Among these 25 aa, the first 13aa are rich in basic residues and are predicted to interact with RNA inside the assembled capsid 10 . Application of DisProt 11 predicted that the N-terminal 25 aa region is disordered while the remaining 134 aa are highly ordered (Fig. 1B) . Preliminary data on the replication of STMV in plant protoplasts suggested a role for STMV CP and more specifically for the N-terminal13aa in replication 7 . We opted to extend the Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression system (agroinfiltration) developed recently for STMV in our lab 9 in dissecting the mechanism involving the CP-regulated STMV replication. To this end, we constructed three independent variant agrotransformants of wt STMV (pSTMV; Fig. 1C ). These are as follows: (i) Agrotransformant CPKO was constructed by substituting the translation initiating methionine codon located at nucleotides 162-164 with a stop codon (i.e. 162 AUG 164 → 162 UAG 164 ) (Fig. 1C) ; (ii) agrotransformant CPΔ 13aa was designed to express the CP devoid of the first 13aa by engineering a stop codon at the translation initiation site and a start codon at aa14 (Fig. 1C) and (iii) agrotransformant CP13aa was designed to express only the first 13aa by engineering a stop codon at aa position 14 (Fig. 1C) . Each of the above-mentioned three agrotransformants was mixed with agrocultures of pRP to provide the HV-RdRp (Fig. 1C) and was co-infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves. Plants co-infiltrated with pSTMV and pRP served as positive controls. At five days post infiltration (dpi), total RNA and protein preparations were isolated and subjected respectively to duplicate Northern blot hybridization to detect progeny (+ ) and (− )-RNA and Western blot analysis. Duplicate Northern blots probed for assessing the affect of CP on the accumulation of progeny (+ ) and (− )-strands are shown in Fig. 2A . Quantitative analysis of progeny RNA with respect to the wt control is tabulated and shown in Fig. 2B . This experiment was repeated three times and we consistently observed that the presence of CP, more specifically the N-terminal 13aa, had profound influence on progeny accumulation. Quantitative data in Fig. 2B represents the relative (+ ) and (− )-strand accumulation for each CP mutant when compared internally to that of wt. It was observed that, complete absence of CP, exemplified by the behavior of CPKO, decreased the plus-strand accumulation by 90% while minus-strand accumulation was not affected. By contrast, CP lacking the N-terminal 13aa motif (i.e. CPΔ 13aa) reduced the plus-strand accumulation by 47% while a 3-fold increase in minus-strand accumulation was observed. Interestingly, expression of only the N-terminal 13aa motif had no detectable effect on plus-strand accumulation while a 4-fold increase in minus-strand accumulation was observed (Fig. 2B ). Taken together, these results suggested that the N-terminal 13aa motif of the STMV CP has two independent roles for regulating (− ) and/or (+ )-strand synthesis (see Discussion). With respect to CP accumulation, as expected, in addition to the wt control, a detectable level of a faster migrating CP was accumulated for variant Δ 13aa but not for other variants ( Fig. 2A) . To detect the 13aa motif by Western blot, the 13aa motif was FLAG tagged and its expression was confirmed by using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (see below) . Recently, we demonstrated that production of a truncated form of STMV RNA is a hallmark feature associated with STMV replication in N. benthamiana 9 . It was observed that with either mechanical inoculation of STMV with its HV or co-expression of STMV with HV-RdRp via agroinfiltration, a truncated non-replicative form of STMV lacking the 3′ terminal 150 nt (i.e. STMVΔ 150) was also accumulated along with the wt genomic RNA. Additional experiments demonstrated that production of STMVΔ 150 is linked to HV-dependent replication and is not a product of ribonuclease activity 9 . To verify the production of STMVΔ 150 in leaves expressing each of the three variant agrotransformants (CPKO, ∆ 13aa and 13aa), total RNA preparations were subjected to RT-PCR. Production of STMVΔ 150 was associated with either wt STMV ( Fig. 2A , lane 1 in RT-PCR panel) or a variant competent to express the 13aa (i.e. CP 13aa in Fig. 2A , lane 5 in RT-PCR panel) but not with those variants defective in expressing the 13aa i.e. CPKO or CPΔ 13aa ( Fig. 2A , lanes 3 and 4 in RT-PCR panel). Since the production of STMVΔ 150 is linked to HV-dependent replication 9 and the fact that expression of the 13aa plays a crucial role in STMV replication (Figs 2A and 3B ) 7 , these observations suggest that expression of the 13aa is linked to the production of STMVΔ 150 by an unknown mechanism. To test the effect of the N-terminal 13aa deletion on virion assembly, agrotransformants of CPKO, CPΔ 13aa and 13aa were co-expressed with agrotransformant pRP in N. benthamiana leaves. Plants co-infiltrated with pSTMV and pRP served as positive controls while those infiltrated only with empty vector served as negative controls. At 4 dpi, virions were purified, negatively stained and examined by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Icosahedral virions of 18 nm characteristic of STMV were recovered from leaves infiltrated with pSTMV and pRP (Fig. 2C ). By contrast, no virions were detected in leaves infiltrated with any of the three CP variants (Fig. 2C ). In agreement with previous findings 5 , our observations further confirm that the N-terminal 13aa region is required for virion assembly. and minus (− ) strand progeny RNA and CP were respectively probed by Northern and Western blot analysis. RT-PCR assays of wt STMV and the indicated CP variants were performed using total RNA isolated from leaves harvested at 4 dpi. (B) Quantitative analysis of (+ ) and (− ) progeny RNA of wt STMV and each CP variant was performed by scanning the autoradiographs using a Typhoon Phosphoimage scanner (Model 9410, GE Health Care) followed by ImageQ software analysis. Data was quantitated and compared internally with each levels of (+ ) and (− )-strands to that of wild type. Conditions for Northern and Western blots and RT-PCR analysis are as described previously 9 Results shown in Fig. 2A accentuate the importance of the N-terminal 13aa region in STMV replication. To precisely identify the role of positively charged aa encompassing the N-terminal 13aa of STMV CP on replication, an alanine residue was substituted singly for each arginine or lysine residues normally located within the N-terminal 13aa motif resulting in the construction of a set of five variants of CP 13aa (i.e. 13aa/3A, 13aa/5A, 13aa/7A, 13aa/10A and 13aa/11A in Fig. 3A ). Each of these CP agrotranformants was co-infiltrated with pRP into N. benthamiana leaves and progeny were evaluated using Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 3 ). Northern blots were probed for assessing the affect of CP and its variants on the progeny accumulation ( Fig. 3B ) and quantitated as described above (Fig. 3C) . First, we evaluated the affect of the N-terminal 13aa motif and five variants on plus-strand accumulation (Fig. 3B , panel i). Except for variant 13aa/3A, plus-strand accumulation for the remaining four variants was indistinguishable from that of the internal control (i.e. wt) (Fig. 3C ). Secondly, we evaluated the effect of these mutants on minus-strand accumulation (Fig. 3B , panel ii). Since each of the five alanine substitutions were engineered into the genetic background of the wt 13aa construct, data was normalized against wt 13aa. Except for variant 13aa/3A, where the (− )-strand accumulation was equivalent to that of the control (i.e. 13aa), a 3-fold increase in minus-strand accumulation was observed for the remaining four variants (Fig. 3C ). Taken together, these observations accentuate the significance of having a positively charged residue at their respective positions, and specifically that the 3 rd position is obligatory for sustained replication. Results of RT-PCR analysis evaluating the production of STMV Δ 150 are shown in Fig. 3B . Production of STMV Δ 150 was found associated with all variants except for 13aa/3A (Fig. 3B) . Collectively, data encompassing replication profiles (Fig. 3B ), quantitative analysis of strand asymmetry (Fig. 3C ) and RT-PCR (Fig. 3B ) analysis suggested that the arginine and the lysine residues at the N-terminus play a significant role for maintaining wild type replication of the STMV RNA. More specifically a positively charged residue at the 3 rd position is intimately involved with the replication of STMV (also see below).
