Initially, the recovery of dried virus infectivity from the stainless steel carriers was investigated. In relation to the input virus titer applied to the stainless steel carriers, the recovery titer was reduced by 2.1 and 0.7 log 10 TCID 50 /mL (mean, n ¼ 6) for H5N1 and BVDV respectively. Reo III (n ¼ 6) and MVM (n ¼ 10) remained unchanged. The latter results indicated that virus infectivity could be completely recovered and that the drying on stainless steel had no impact on MVM and Reo III infectivity. Dry Fog disinfection using a PAA/HP solution at 0.4 mL/m 3 (run design I) revealed rapid inactivation of all influenza viruses investigated (H5N1, H3N2 and Flu B), to a titer below the detection limit after 5 min of treatment in 8 out of 12 sample series of the virus inactivation runs performed (Table 1A ). In contrast, BVDV was inactivated at the same disinfectant concentration after 59 min treatment by merely 1.6 log 10 (Table 1A , Fig. 2A ). Doubling the amount of PAA/HP solution (0.8 mL/m 3 , run design II) resulted in inactivation of BVDV by 2.6 log 10 after the total inactivation time of 59 min (Table 1A , Fig. 2A ). Similar inactivation kinetics were found for Reo III, of which 1.9 log 10 virus infectivity were inactivated after 59 min treatment with run design I and 1.6 log 10 at the higher disinfectant concentration (run design II; Table 1B , Fig. 2B ). After the complete inactivation period of 174 min Reo III was inactivated by 2.3 log 10 in run design I and 2.1 log 10 in run design II, respectively (Table 1B, Fig. 2B) . MVM was only inactivated by 1.1 log 10 at the low PAA/ HP solution amount in run design I after 174 min (Table 1B , Fig. 2C ). Application of a PAA/HP solution amount of 0.8 mL/m 3 including repeated re-fogging to maintain a nearly constant PAA/ HP concentration during the first 59 min treatment showed inactivation of 1.6 log 10 MVM (Fig. 2C ). Inactivation to below the detection limit could be achieved with MVM after 174 min treatment with 2.9 mL/m 3 PAA/HP solution (run design IV; Table 1B , Fig. 2C ). For an assessment of the accuracy of the experimental setup, the variability of results was evaluated by comparing distinct reduction factors obtained with the same virus and run design, respectively. The variability of reduction factors ranged between 0.1 log 10 (Reo III, run design II (n ¼ 2)) and 0.4 log 10 (BVDV, run design I (n ¼ 4)), and the mean overall reduction factor variability was 0.2 log 10 (n ¼ 7).
