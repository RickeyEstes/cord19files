LRI deaths decreased by 30.2% from 273,714 (95% UI 239,890-306,648) in 1990 to 191,114 (95% UI 170,934-210,705) in 2015 in EMR countries. In spite of the decrease, LRI is still the third-leading cause of death for all ages in 2015. The death rate per 100,000 was 74.0 (95% UI 64.8-82.9) in 1990 and decreased to 29.5 (95% UI 26.4-32.5) in 2015, a 60.1% reduction. The age-standardized death rate for LRI was 65.4 (95% UI 58.6-73.4) in 1990 and declined by 38.5% to 40.2 (95% UI 36.0-45.2) in 2015. In 2015, 4.8% (95% UI 4.3-5.2) of all deaths and 13.0% (95% UI 11.5-14.7) of under-5 deaths were due to LRI. At the regional level, the highest death rates and numbers of deaths were among children under 5 years old, followed by those aged 65 years or older. However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the age pattern of LRI deaths between the countries of the EMR. In all high-income countries (Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and UAE), and some of the middle-income countries (Iran, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, and Tunisia), the LRI death rates among older age groups were greater than the mortality rates among children under 5 years. Death rates were 31.5 per 100,000 (95% UI 27.3-35.4) in men compared to 27.4 per 100,000 in women (95% UI 23.9-31.2) in the region. The LRI death rate was not different in EMR countries in boys versus girls under 5 (2015). Figure 1 shows the age-standardized death rates for LRI by EMR country in 2013. Somalia, Djibouti, and Afghanistan had the highest death rates in the region. Among the etiologic causes, pneumococcus had the highest mortality rate (16.6 per 100,000, 95% UI 10.0-22.9), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (1.5 per 100,000, 95% UI 0.9-2.4), Haemophilus influenzae type b (1.1 per 100,000, 95% UI 0.0-2.3), and influenza virus (0.8 per 100,000, 95% UI 0.5-1.2). Figure 2 demonstrates the contribution of different etiologic causes to LRI deaths by age. The rate of YLLs per 100,000 population decreased by 69.5% from 5579 (95% UI 4,831-6,320) in 1990-1702 (95% UI 1,510-1,902) in 2015. However, LRI was still the third-leading cause of YLLs in 2015. e- Table 1 shows age-standardized incidence rates of LRI in males and females of the EMR countries. The highest incidence rate was observed in Afghanistan and the lowest in Tunisia for both sexes. In all countries but Afghanistan, Bahrain, and Djibouti, the incidence rates were higher among men than women, with the highest male-to-female ratio in Iran and Libya. The rate of YLDs per 100,000 decreased from 15.8 (95% UI 10.7-22.9) to 9.7 (95% UI 6.5-13.6) per 100,000 during 1990-2015. Total DALYs from LRI decreased by 40.6%, from 20, 746,747 (95% UI 17,954,899-23,444,142) in 1990 to 11,098,243 (95% UI 9,857,095-12,396,566) in 2015. LRI, which was the leading cause of DALYs in 1990, was ranked fourth in 2015, behind ischemic heart disease, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy. LRI DALY rates were 5594 (95% UI 4851-6334) and 1712 (95% UI 1520-1912) DALYs per 100,000 population in 1990 and 2015, respectively, a 69.4% reduction. About 4.9% (95% UI 4.3-5.5) of DALYs in all ages and 12.2% (95% UI 10.8-13.8) of DALYs in children under 5 were due to LRI in 2015. Age-standardized DALY rates were 3411 per 100,000 (95% UI 2,993-3,824) in 1990 compared to 1518 per 100,000 (95% UI 1357-1673) in 2015 in the EMR. Global age-standardized DALY rates for LRI were lower than those in the EMR: 3310 (95% UI 3033-3551) in 1990, and 1428 (95% UI 1330-1511) in 2013. There was a 56.9% reduction in age-standardized DALY rates at the global level, which was similar to the EMR (55.5% reduction) during 1990-2015. Figure 3 presents trends in age-standardized and all-ages LRI DALY rates between 1990 and 2015 globally and for the EMR. Figure 4 shows age-standardized LRI DALY rates in the EMR countries. The highest rates were seen in Somalia, Afghanistan, and Djibouti. LRI DALY rates did not differ significantly between males and females. Figure 5 shows DALY rates for different etiologies of LRI in EMR countries in 2015. The largest variation in country-specific DALYs (highest to lowest ratio) was observed for Hib (2068.7) compared to 125.5 for pneumococcus, 109.4 for RSV, and 30.6 for influenza. The DALY rate for Hib was less than one DALY per 100,000 in UAE and Qatar, compared to 916.7 in Somalia and 458.5 in Afghanistan (Fig. 5) . Figure 6 shows the LRI DALY rates attributable to different risk factors in 2015. Childhood undernutrition, household air pollution from solid fuels, ambient particulate matter pollution, suboptimal breastfeeding, secondhand smoke, no handwashing with soap, and zinc deficiency were the most important risk factors for LRI in children under 5. Among those aged 70 years or older, ambient particulate matter pollution, household air pollution from solid fuels, smoking, no handwashing with soap, secondhand smoke, and alcohol use were the main risk factors.
