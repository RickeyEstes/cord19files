CVB3 3A-H57Y RO Formation Is Impaired under PI4KB Inhibition First, we set out to study the morphology of the ROs induced by CVB3 3A-H57Y under conditions where PI4KB is not inhibited. Infected BGM cells were prepared for electron microscopy (EM) by high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution at different times post-infection and analyzed for the presence of membrane modifications. The first ROs induced by CVB3 3A-H57Y were detected at 5 hr post-infection (hpi). At this stage, single-membrane tubules were predominant, interspersed with DMVs ( Figure 1A ). The emergence of ROs coincides with disintegration of the Golgi apparatus in wild-type (WT) infection (Limpens et al., 2011) and, concordantly, the Golgi apparatus was not observed in cell sections that contained ROs at any time point in this analysis. Later in infection, tubules had largely transformed into DMVs ( Figure 1A , 6 hpi) and multilamellar structures ( Figure 1A , 7 hpi). This progression closely reflects observations of WT CVB3 RO development with regard to both the specific morphologies induced and the time frame over which they develop (Limpens et al., 2011) ( Figure S1A ). Together, these results indicate that the 3A-H57Y substitution does not affect RO development or their general architecture. Next, we investigated the effect of PI4KB inhibition on RO development during CVB3 3A-H57Y infection. To determine suitable time points for EM analysis of cells infected in the presence of a PI4KB inhibitor, we first measured viral replication in the presence of BF738735, a potent and specific PI4KB inhibitor without overt cytotoxicity (also known as compound 1; van der Schaar et al., 2013; MacLeod et al., 2013) . Unlike CVB3 WT ( Figure S2A ), CVB3 3A-H57Y was resistant to BF738735 ( Figure S2B ), although its replication was nevertheless delayed and impaired in the presence of BF738735 with regard to both vRNA and infectious progeny virus. This is in agreement with observations using other PI4KB inhibitors (e.g., PIK93; van der Schaar et al., 2012) . To examine whether the impairment of replication upon PI4KB inhibition was the consequence of a decrease in the number of infected cells and/or a reduced level of vRNA replication, we collected cells infected with EGFP-CVB3 3A-H57Y at different time points post-infection and analyzed them with flow cytometry. PI4KB inhibition reduced the number of CVB3 3A-H57Y-infected cells (by $3-fold), delayed replication (by $1-2 hr), and limited viral protein production, as reflected by reduced EGFP levels ( Figure S2C ). These results indicate that the PI4KB inhibitor imposes a critical barrier to CVB3 3A-H57Y replication in a subpopulation of cells and reduces the efficiency of replication in those cells where infection is established. Based on the growth curve analysis, cells were fixed and processed for EM between 5 and 8 hpi, as this period encompasses the exponential phase of vRNA replication for CVB3 3A-H57Y under PI4KB inhibition. Remarkably, while ROs were detected at a frequency of $50% in EM cell sections from infections in the absence of PI4KB inhibitor (n = 43 cell sections assessed at 6 hpi), neither archetypal enterovirus ROs (i.e., clusters of single-membrane tubules and/or DMVs) nor cellular membranes with atypical morphologies were detected in cells infected under PI4KB inhibition (n = 153 cell sections), even at late time points (7-8 hpi, n = 47 cell sections, example shown in Figure 1B ). Seemingly intact Golgi cisternae were apparent in these cells and detected at a frequency similar to that of mock-infected or BF738735-treated cells (Figures S1B and S1C, respectively). Corresponding immunofluorescence microscopy data showed a high percentage of cells positive for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) labeling, confirming that the lack of membrane modifications in the EM analysis was not simply due to a low number of infected cells ( Figure 1B , right). These data show that RO development is impaired by PI4KB inhibition and suggest that replication may be taking place instead at a cellular organelle. CVB3 3A-H57Y Replicates Its Genome at the Golgi Apparatus under PI4KB Inhibition As an initial indicator of the replication site under PI4KB inhibition, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy on infected cells (Figure 2A ). Cells were fixed at 5 hpi in the absence of inhibitor and at 6 hpi in the presence of inhibitor given the delay in replication. Similar to findings for WT virus (Hsu et al., 2010; van der Schaar et al., 2012) , both 3A and dsRNA were detected throughout the cytoplasm in cells infected with CVB3 3A-H57Y in the absence of PI4KB inhibition ( Figure 2A , left panels). Golgi disassembly could be readily visualized through the signal reduction and dispersion of the cis-Golgi marker GM130 and the trans-Golgi network marker TGN46, whereas the PI4KB signal overlapped with the 3A labeling. Upon PI4KB inhibitor treatment, however, 3A and dsRNA were primarily confined to the perinuclear region (Figure 2A, right panels) . In wide-field images, the strength and distribution of GM130 and TGN46 signals were largely maintained and overlapped with the viral 3A signal. These results suggested that both the 3A-H57Y protein and dsRNA reside at the Golgi apparatus in the presence of the inhibitor. To confirm that these observations were due to specific inhibition of PI4KB, the localization of 3A-GFP was assessed using different PI4KB inhibitors. Similar to BF738735, enviroxime, GW5074, or PIK93 treatment resulted the accumulation of 3A specifically at the Golgi region, although confocal imaging revealed that 3A did not directly co-localize with the cis-Golgi marker GM130 ( Figure 2B ). To unambiguously determine the subcellular location of the 3A-H57Y protein under PI4KB inhibitor treatment, correlative light and EM (CLEM) was performed. For this, we employed the split-GFP system (Cabantous et al., 2005) to label the 3A-H57Y protein, using an approach similar to that previously reported for WT CVB3 (van der Schaar et al., 2016b). To produce a split-GFP CVB3 3A-H57Y mutant, the final beta sheet of GFP (i.e., strand 11), further referred to as GFP(S11), was introduced into the 3A-H57Y protein to produce CVB3 3A-H57Y(S11). Upon CVB3 3A-H57Y(S11) infection of BGM cells stably expressing the remaining portion of GFP (GFPS1-10), the two fragments of GFP self-assemble to produce GFP-tagged 3A-H57Y. GFPtagged 3A-H57Y was then visualized by confocal microscopy before chemical fixation and processing for EM. Overlays of 3A-H57Y-GFP signal with the corresponding EM cell sections fixed at 6 hpi revealed that the 3A protein localized specifically to the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 3A ). The presence of the 3A-H57Y protein at the Golgi apparatus suggested that vRNA replication occurs at this compartment under PI4KB inhibition. To further investigate this, metabolic labeling was performed to detect newly synthesized vRNA in situ. Infected cells were pretreated with 10 mg/mL dactinomycin to inhibit cellular transcription and incubated with tritiated uridine for 45 min prior to fixation to label newly synthesized vRNA. As a control, mock-infected cells underwent the same treatment. After processing for EM, radiolabelled uridine was detected by autoradiography. In cells infected with CVB3 3A-H57Y without PI4KB inhibition, abundant autoradiography signal was found in regions containing typical ROs ( Figure 3B ). Although RO membranes in chemically fixed samples appeared somewhat distended in comparison to high-pressure frozen material (Figure 1 ), they were recognizable as clusters of single-membrane compartments ( Figure 3B , black arrowhead) interspersed with DMVs ( Figure 3B , white arrowhead) that closely resemble the ROs observed in chemically fixed PV-infected (Dales et al., 1965; Belov et al., 2012) or WT-CVB3-infected cells (van der Schaar et al., 2016b) . In CVB3-3A-H57Y-infected cells treated with PI4KB inhibitor and fixed at 7 hpi, ROs were not observed (n = 148 cell sections), and abundant autoradiography signal was found at the Golgi apparatus ( Figure 3C CVB3 3A-H57Y can replicate its genome in the absence of ROs on a seemingly intact Golgi apparatus. Under PI4KB Inhibition, ROs Form Late in CVB3-3A-H57Y-Infected Cells Our results thus far show that under PI4KB inhibition, CVB3 3A-H57Y replication is possible in association with an apparently intact cellular organelle. We next set out to establish whether PI4KB inhibition precludes Golgi disintegration and RO development entirely or simply delays the process. Confocal microscopy of live cells expressing mCherry-GM130 was performed to monitor the Golgi apparatus across the course of CVB3 3A-H57Y(S11) infection, either with or without BF738735 treatment ( Figures 4A-4C ). In the absence of inhibitor, the process of Golgi fragmentation following CVB3 3A-H57Y(S11) infection was similar to that of WT split-GFP CVB3 infections (van der Schaar et al., 2016b). The onset of Golgi fragmentation occurred in conjunction with or even preceded 3A protein accumulation in the Golgi area, and Golgi disintegration was typically complete within 25 min (n = 23 cells) (Figures 4A and 4C, top graph) . In the absence of PI4KB inhibition, the early 3A signal was often located at peripheral foci ( Figure 4A arrowheads), and under PI4KB inhibition, the first 3A signal was often found in the Golgi region ( Figure 4B , arrowheads). Remarkably, the Golgi apparatus of most CVB3-3A-H57Y(S11)-infected cells did disassemble during infections under PI4KB inhibition, but with markedly different dynamics. The onset of disintegration under these conditions did not coincide with 3A protein accumulation at the Golgi but suffered a relative average delay of 30 min (n = 48 cells). Additionally, the time needed for Golgi disintegration was highly variable under PI4KB inhibition. In a minority of infected cells treated with BF738735, Golgi disassembly was as rapid as in untreated cells. However, in most cells, the Golgi disintegration process was substantially prolonged (by up to 10 hr) under PI4KB inhibition ( Figures 4B and 4C , bottom graph). To determine whether Golgi disassembly under PI4KB inhibition was associated with the development of ROs, CLEM was performed on cells infected with split-GFP 3A-H57Y(S11) virus under BF738735 treatment and fixed at 9 hpi. While some cells retained seemingly intact Golgi membranes at this late stage in infection, in those cells lacking recognizable Golgi membranes, the 3A-GFP signal was found at structures resembling typical early ROs ( Figure 4D ; see Figure 3A by immunofluorescence microscopy, PI4P did not accumulate in cells infected under PI4KB inhibition ( Figure S3 ), suggesting that the ROs that develop during CVB3 3A-H57Y infection under PI4KB inhibition do so independently of high PI4P levels.
