In general, for all the estimates, control variables considered as de-terminants of tourism flows are statistically significant and with the expected sign. The coefficients for both LnGDPpc jt and LnPop jt are significantly positive and slightly higher that unity, implying that a 1% increase in the destination GDP per capita and population will lead to an increase higher than 1% on tourist arrivals to the country. The coefficient for the RTA ijt , that controls for the existence of a trade agreement between country pairs during specific years, is also significant and positive. In this case, due to the binary nature of the explanatory variable used, the estimated coefficient (slightly higher that 0.04) implies that the existence of a trade agreement increases the number of tourists to a destination by more than 4%. Finally, and as expected, the variable related to low levels of security and safety at the destination country (Crime jt ) shows a negative effect, indicating that an increase in the number of homicides (per 10,000 inhabitants) reduces tourist arrivals. In reference to the different types of disasters, for events associated with Tsunamis, Floods and Volcanoes, all the significant parameters are found to be negative, indicating that these three types of disasters constitute substantial negative motivators for prospective visitors. A more detailed examination of coefficients highlights that volcanic eruptions appear most deterring to international tourists. This circumstance could be related to the severity of the damage caused by volcanic eruptions, including potentially irreversible damage to infrastructure or the complete loss of a natural asset. For the occurrence of an eruption, and for every increase in the number of deaths (for every 1000 people), affected (in millions of people) and costs (in millions of US$), there will be a decrease in international tourists to the destination between 1.07% and 1.32%, 2.13%-1.78% and 4.51%-3.44%, respectively (according to whether the 6 or 12 months delay is considered). Wildfires, Earthquakes, Industrial Accidents, and Storms present mixed effects on international tourist arrivals. For all types of disasters, and Note: ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, *p < 0.1. Dyadic and origin-year fixed effects are included in the model but estimates are not reported. Robust standard errors clustered by pairs. when economic costs are considered, a negative and significant relationship is found. In other words, the economic damage from these events, for example to infrastructure, is likely to reduce tourist arrivals. Wildfires appear as the second most detrimental type of disaster when measured in economic damage, leading to an expected fall of 0.03% of tourist arrivals for every million US$ cost associated with the disaster. Interestingly and perhaps paradoxically, a significant positive relationship is evident between the number of people affected by Wildfires and tourist arrivals. For every million affected people, an increase between 0.34% and 0.35% is expected. Consequently, and considering the negative effect of economic damage mentioned above, the net effect of Wildfires on tourism should consider the two different types of disaster impact measures. Earthquakes show a similar negative impact compared with Tsunamis (see above) in terms of the economic costs of the disaster, with falls around 0.002% for every million US$ cost. However, the other impact metrics do not show a negative relationship. In terms of number of fatalities, there is even an increase in tourism for the number of deaths per 1000 people by 0.002%. Thus, the overall impact of an earthquake is a combination of decreases in response to economic damage and number of deaths. Industrial Accidents and Storms show similar patterns in that there is a positive relationship between the number of fatalities and affected people, but a negative relationship between the economic impact of the disaster and tourism arrivals. For example, for Storms there is a decrease in arrivals by 0.003% for every million US$ cost but increases between 0.018% and 0.024% for every death/1000 people and between 0.018%-0.024% and 0.03-0.04% for every million people affected. Droughts emerged as the only type of disaster that did not show a significantly negative relationship between disaster cost and tourism, but instead arrivals were significantly linked to the two other disaster impact metrics. More specifically, for every death/1000 people an increase higher than 1% is obtained, while for every million people affected a decrease of 0.001% is estimated. It is perhaps not surprising that the relationship between disaster costs and tourism is not significant for Drought. Overall, it is less likely that drought conditions produce direct impacts on tourism-relevant infrastructures and supplies, as tourism businesses might absorb the extra costs of supplying water during water constrained times. There could be indirect costs, for example due to more expensive food supplies, but such effects do not seem to result in significant changes in visitation. Epidemics, Landslides, Cold waves, and Heat waves do not achieve significant results for any of the six regressions considered, and for this reason they were not considered in the final estimation presented in Table 1 . In the case of Epidemics, and Landslides we should note that these two variables have a strong structural component. For instance, epidemic episodes, such as Cholera, Dengue, and Ebola, as well as land movements with consequences on people are recurrent in the same types of countries at different times, but rarely are these factors extended to other countries. In a similar way Rossellï¿½ o, Santana-Gallego, and Waqas (2017) evaluated the effects of Dengue, Ebola, Malaria, and Yellow Fever on international tourism flows showing how these diseases have a strong structural component and are often recurrent in the same countries. The case of Cold and Heat waves is different. It should be noted how travel booking decisions (especially in international travel) are often taken months in advance, when no reliable weather predictions exist. Although it is possible to cancel travel plans in case of extreme temperatures, tourist might assume the conditions are temporary and unlikely to impact their trip. In terms of longer lasting risk perceptions of a destination, heat or cold waves might not be seen as particularly threatening, and hence easily forgotten. Visitors might expect that their tourism service provider is dealing with adverse conditions, for example by providing air conditioning or heating. Instead, extreme temperatures are more likely to impact local people (e.g., farmers) leading to wider economic damage (but not attributed to tourism). Regarding the distribution of the potential effects of each one of the disasters during the next 12 months (columns from one to three) and during the next 6 months (columns from four to six) no significant but only minor differences are found. Additionally, different attempts to discriminate disaster by geographical regions did not yield significantly different conclusions. As mentioned earlier and in order to explore the bidirectional effects between disaster events and tourism flows, a second research strategy is implemented. Based on two initial general regressions (one for each of the delay periods considered), including all the considered variables, a reduction is undertaken in order to get the specific regressions presented in Table 5 . Regarding the distribution of the potential consequences of each type of disaster during the next 12 months (columns one to three) and during the next 6 months (columns four to six), in general, no significant differences are found. With the exception of Floods and Storms, the coefficients for the remaining disasters (in absolute terms) are higher for the 12 month impact regressions than for the 6 months ones, thus, indicating that effects are probably better captured by longer time lags. In contrast, the effects of Floods and Storms seem to have a shorter life span, since the 6 month timeframe captures a higher impact. The analysis of the different disaster impacts reveals how, on the one hand, costs always present a negative relationship with international tourist arrivals. This confirms that the economic costs of a disaster are an important measure for tourism managers, probably because of the inherent damage to local infrastructure that is captured. On the other hand, the impact of some types of disaster evaluated in terms of deaths shows a positive relationship with tourist arrivals. This does not mean that the occurrence of these disasters will have a net positive effect on the arrival of tourists, since the negative effect of the associated costs must be taken into account when deriving an overall estimate of impact. As outlined earlier, the number of deaths could be related with the arrival of people for humanitarian reasons, or with a flow of people who travel to see (and support) friends and relatives affected by the event. This could present a significant effect in relative terms for those countries with a low base level of arrivals. The total effect also should Note: ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, *p < 0.1. Dyadic and origin-year fixed effects are included in the model but estimates are not reported. Robust standard errors clustered by pairs. consider the impacts of the number of affected people that for some disasters have a reducing effect (Droughts, Tsunamis and Volcanoes), while for others there seems to be an increase in the number of tourists (Industrial Accidents, Wildfires and Storms).
