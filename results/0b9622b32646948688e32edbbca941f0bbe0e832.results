Porcine PCIS were successfully established and TGEV infection was visible in two of the three tested virus strains. First, PCIS were tested for their integrity for up to 6 h, but no TGEV infected cells were visible (data not shown). To further check for complete epithelial layers of the jejunum conventional HE staining was performed ( Fig. 2A, B) . The epithelial cell layer was complete up to 24 h. PCIS have an ellipse shape where the villi always pull over to the outside because of the muscularis mucosae. For vitality ATP concentration of the slices was measured by relative luminescence units (RLU). To compare the values we used ATP tenfold dilutions starting at 16500 μM. Directly after PCIS production the highest value of ca 0.63 μM ATP was measured. Further time points at 3, 9, 12, 16, and 24 h showed lower ATP values (Fig. 3) . However, statistical analysis showed no significant differences in ATP of 3 h and 9 h slices compared to the first time point. After 12 h and 16 h the ATP measurement showed significant differences compared to the start of PCIS incubation (Fig. 3) . The 16 h and 24 h ATP, was the lowest measured with 0.018 μM and 0.013 μM. ATP concentration of the PCIS after several hours in culture is reduced slightly, and showed low levels after more than 16 h. The three tested strains of TGEV showed differences in their ability to infect the PCIS. Generally, HE staining could not show any differences in the structure of the PCIS or their villi post infection compared to uninfected controls. The different time points and TGEV strains were further analyzed by antibody staining for their N protein in the epithelial cell layer of jejunal villi. The infection with TGEV GFP, the recombinant TGEV strain, was tested for 6, 9, 12, 16, and 24 h post infection ( Table 1) . Except of the first timepoint, immunohistochemistry of PCIS showed viral N protein at all time points tested; in contrast to non-infected control slices ( Fig. 2G -J, Table 1 ). Viral antigen of TGEV MIL65 was also detectable in PCIS at 12, 16 and 24 h p.i., but not after 9 h of infection ( Fig. 2 O-R, Table 1 ). Finally, TGEV PUR46-MAD was not able to infect PCIS at any time point analyzed (Fig. 2C , D, Table 1 ). This demonstrates a high strain dependency of intestinal infection that can be visualized in porcine jejunal PCIS.
