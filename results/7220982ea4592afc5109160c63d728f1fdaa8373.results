In 2018, the MOHW allocated USD 435.1 million for major R&D funds, corresponding to about 3% of the government's 2018 regular budget. Leaving out the non-disease portion of the budget, the MOHW allocated 35.9% of the remainder of its R&D budget to communicable diseases, 64.1% to non-communicable diseases, and 0% to injuries and violence. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the 2018 MOHW fund allocations across the diseases categories. In this figure, R&D funds and the burden of disease in Korea were not correlated. For example, much part of the MOHW R&D funds were allocated to upgrading the national system for responding to communicable diseases, focusing on prevention of variant infectious disease inflow and spread and on-site responses. However, communicable diseases in Korea only accounted for 2.8% of DALYs in 2015. 7 Non-communicable diseases, on the other hand, accounted for more than 87% of Korean DALYs but were only allocated 64.1% of the MOHW R&D funds. The most salient findings, though, were in the injuries and violence disease group. There was no MOHW funding whatsoever for this disease group. However, injuries and violence such as self-harm, interpersonal injury, or transport injury accounted for 10.1% of the total 2015 DALYs in the KNBD study, even higher than those of the communicable disease category. 6 To further investigate whether the economic burden and funds allocation are aligned, we also compared the differences between them. We noted that the funds were also skewed when compared to economic burden. The economic burden of injury and violence was 9.1%, but injury and violence did not receive any portion of the MOHW total funding (Fig. 2) . We undertook sub-analysis to investigate the relationship between DALYs for level 2 disease groups and MOHW allocation. Budget which could not be allocated to each level 2 disease group is not sub classified. We identified 20 budget lines for "non-disease specific budgets." Non-disease specific budget refers to big data in healthcare, cutting edge medical technology development, medical device development, and so on. They accounted for roughly USD 275.8 million in 2018 and were excluded from our three diseases categories. diseases. However, the allocation of R&D funding for neoplasms was more than nine times that of musculoskeletal disorders. Neurological disorders, which include Alzheimer's dementia, were ranked second after neoplasm in the MOHW R&D funds. In prioritizing health resources, risk factors should also be considered. 4 Some of the R&D budget was directly targeted for risk factors in 2018. Fig. 3 shows the R&D budget for risk factors. We compared four risk categories in the DALYs of the 2013 KNBD study (behavioral, socio-economic, environmental, and metabolic) with R&D budgetary allocations. As a result, mismatches between R&D budget allocations and DALY distributions were found. For example, it is difficult to locate the fund for socioeconomic risk in the MOHW R&D budget. In the behavioral risk category, even though tobacco smoking was the most dangerous risk factor, only "alcohol use" had its own funding.
