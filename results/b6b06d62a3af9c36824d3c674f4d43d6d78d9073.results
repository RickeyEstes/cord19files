The inactivator agents including temperature and UV showed variable effects on the survival of FMD (O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012) virus. Effect of temperature on (in vitro) replication of FMDV is represented in Table-1. The virus suspension when was exposed to heat treatment at 37°C was not inactivated after 15, 30, and 45 min of exposure, and showed CPE on BHK cell line. However when the virus suspension exposed to heat treatment at 57 and 77°C, it was got inactivating after 15, 30, and 45 min of the interaction time. These results showed that complete inactivation was done after exposure to temperature ≥57°C for 15 min. Effects of UV treatment on survival of virus have been shown in Table- Table-2. No CPE was observed by the virus negative control wells l as well as virus inactivated samples while the significant CPE was noted in positive control virus. Table-3 demonstrated that the antigenicity of control virus before inactivation was 1/32, antigenicity was not changed after inactivation in cases gamma radiation and binary with formaldehyde and slightly decreased to (1/16) Tables-4-6 and Figures-5-10 demonstrated that the immune response of inactivated FMD vaccine by gamma radiation and binary with formaldehyde lasted to 9 months post-vaccination, while the binary (BEI) only still up to 8 months post-vaccination (MPV) but heat and UV inactivator vaccines were not effective.
