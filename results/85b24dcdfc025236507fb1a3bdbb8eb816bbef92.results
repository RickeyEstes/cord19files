ADCC-mediated killing of anti-CAIX antibodies and choice of CAR-targeting moiety We have previously reported on a panel of high-affinity human anti-CAIX antibodies that differed in their epitope mapping, expression levels, and ability to internalize CAIX. 23 Our first aim was to investigate the antitumor activity of five of these anti-CAIX single-chain antibodies as candidates for CAR construction. To test for anti-CAIX mAb-mediated ADCC, the scFvs were converted to scFv-Fc (hIgG1) minibodies. 23 We found that all scFv-Fcs exhibited antigen-specific tumor lysis. For tumor cell line sk-rc-09 with high CAIX + expression, specific lysis ranged from 40 to 57% and for sk-rc-52 with moderate CAIX + expression, specific lysis ranged from 46 to 60%, with background of lysis of < 5% for the CAIX − tumor cell line sk-rc-59. For negative control scFv-Fcs such as anti-CXCR4 48-Fc 23 and anti-SARS 11A-Fc, 24 only background levels of cell lysis were seen ( Figure 1 ). Based on ADCC killing and other published analyses, scFvG36 was chosen for further evaluation as the CAR-targeting moiety. Construction and expression of CAIX-specific chimeric receptors Two generations of anti-CAIX CARs were constructed: firstgeneration G36 CD8 CAR, with scFvG36 linked to CD8, truncated extracellular, hinge, and transmembrane domains plus signaling domain of TCRζ (G36-CD8z). To deliver costimulatory signals, second-generation CD28 CAR was generated, consisting of scFvG36 fused to truncated extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains of CD28 plus signaling domain of TCRζ (G36-CD28z) ( Figure 2a ). Irrelevant second-generation CD28 CAR was made by using anti-HIV CCR5 (clone A8) scFv. 25 In order to detect the expression of these constructs, human rhodopsin C9 tag were inserted between the scFv and CD8 or CD28 domains, respectively and ZsGreen was expressed after the IRES sequence. High concentrations of viral stocks were obtained at comparable levels among the different constructs that were tested by cotransfection of vector plasmids into 293T cells (data not shown). For transduction, PHA mitogen was used to stimulate peripheral blood lymphocytes for 3 days. Concentrated lentivirus supernatants were used to infect human primary T cells in the presence of cationic reagent diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-dextran) as it increased the transduction rate of 1.5-2×-fold as compared with polybrene (data not shown). The transduction rate of primary T cells ranged , is composed of a specific anti-CAIX scFv that is coupled to truncated human CD8α extracellular and hinge domains, transmembrane (TM), and intracellular (IC) regions, then to the signaling domain of human TCRζ. The second-generation CAR, scFv-CD28-TCRζ (CD28 CAR), contains anti-CAIX scFv fused with human CD28 extracellular, TM, and intracellular signaling domain to TCRζ. Both anti-CAIX CARs were cloned into a bicistronic selfinactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector with expression driven by an internal eF1α promoter. The CAR control construct contains an irrelevant anti-HIV CCR5 specific A8 scFv substitution. (b) FACS analysis: Reporter gene ZsGreen was used to quantitate primary T cell transduction efficiency by the lentiviral CAR constructs. In addition, anti-CAIX scFv CARs were stained with CAIX-Fc fusion protein and C9-tag (TETSQVAPA) was stained with 1D4 antibody. Untransduced activated T-cells, LAK only were served as unstained cell control (i) or stained with second antibody ((ii) PE-anti-human IgG and (iii) APC-anti-mouse IgG) were used as staining controls. (c) Western blot: molecular sizes of monomer/dimer structures of anti-CAIX (clone G36) CD28 and anti-CCR5 (clone A8) CD28 CARs, as well as endogenous TCRζ chain of untransduced T cells were indicated. ZsGreen expression in circa 25% by primary CART cells following lentivirus transduction is shown in Figure 2b , left column. CAIX-Fc fusion protein can bind to the G36-CD8z and -CD28z CART cells but not to control A8-CD28z CART cells (Figure 2b , middle column). C9-tag expression was only detected at circa one-third the level of the CAIX-Fc protein (Figure 2b , right column), which is likely related to the finding that mAb 1D4 preferentially recognizes the rhodopsin nonapeptide C9 when presented as a carboxy-terminal versus internal polypeptide sequence (data not shown). Transduced cells that were cultured in vitro for 6 weeks maintained their expression of ZsGreen. On western blot under reducing conditions, G36 and A8 CD28z CARs migrated with a molecular weight of circa 53kD whereas endogenous TCRζ was 16 kDa. G36-CD8z CAR migrated with a molecular weight of circa 48 kD. Under nonreducing conditions, these two CD28z CARs formed homodimers (Figure 2c , data of CD8z CAR not shown).
