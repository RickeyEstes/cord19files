A marked shift in fluorescence intensity is seen using flow cytometry after the addition of loop-specific sequence BeadCons were prepared as described in Materials and Methods to test whether the system is functional. A molar excess of biotinylated molecular beacon specific for HCV was added to 6.7 mm streptavidin-bound microspheres. It is important to note that the biotinylated thymidine in the molecular beacon is on the stem proximal to the quencher molecule as described previously (13) . Target DNA was then added to the washed beads to determine whether there was a shift in the mean fluorescence of the beads. An HCV-specific positive control DNA yielded an MFI of 27.0 -1.5 compared with an MFI of 2.06 -0.11 for an HIV target sequence (see Figure 2 ). Therefore, the signal-to-noise ratio (STNR) for the molecular beacons with a direct conjugation to the beads was 13.1, higher than the 2-5 STNR of other molecular beacon systems that use a solid or immobilized phase (18, 19) , but lower than the standard 25 STNR that is typically seen in solution (6,20,21). The commercial availability of biotinylated beads led us to test the possibility of using streptavidin to bridge the beacon and bead. Such an approach has previously been used to increase the signal of molecular beacons as functional biosensors (13) . Streptavidin was added to 6.7 mm biotinylated beads in excess to limit the possibility of bead cross-linking, with a high enough level of streptavidin so that no two beads would share a single streptavidin molecule. Initial experiments with lower streptavidin levels revealed the production of a doublet population, formed as a streptavidin molecule-bridged two biotinylated beads. When prepared and thoroughly washed beads were hybridized with the HCV-specific positive control DNA, an MFI of 49.8 -3.6 was seen compared with an MFI of 2.06 -0.15 for the unrelated HIV control. Therefore, an STNR of 24.1 was achieved through the use of a streptavidin bridge, comparable with the typical, optimized results in solution for this fluorophore/quencher set. An asymmetrical PCR product derived from an HCV-infected serum sample yielded an MFI of 14.1 -0.9, for an STNR of 6.8 (Supplementary Figure 1) . The reduction in STNR is probably due to self-annealing of the amplified asymmetric PCR strand; however, qualitative gating showed that the binding of the single-stranded product was much more effective than that of the symmetric PCR product (negative using the current hybridization conditions).
