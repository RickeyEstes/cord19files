In this paper, we introduce a new epidemic model to study the outbreak of SARS in China. We begin with a brief review on a classical epidemic model, the so called Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model which is simple and useful when one tries to understand the propagation of many real-life epidemics. We then point out the shortcomings of the SIR model and explain our motivations of building a new epidemic model. While this new model is still relatively simple, it has some nice properties which makes it possible to model better the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong and other cities.
