Objective 1: Identifying the conceptual elements of ID hospital surges The Hospital ID Surge Framework (Fig. 1 ) has two core, opposing yet complimentary elements: Capacity and Capability. As one nurse summarised these: 'So surge [capacity] is a sudden increase in numbers in a short period of timeâ€¦ [and capability] something like in your ability to control [surge events] within your own limits.' -N7. Capacity is broadly referred to in respect to crowding, and as such is known as the quantitative arm of surge management [13] and having enough of what is needed such as beds, medicine and people to manage it [14, 15] . Capacity was readily understood by our participants as such, for example: 'So I suppose Surge is a statistical term laah, so it refers to incident within a period of time.' -C2. Capability is broadly conceptualised by the complexity of disease management. It is the qualitative sister to capacity. It refers instead to the specialised ability needed to understand a pathogen and offer related specialized care [15, 17] . Capability was anchored in competencies and necessarily the 'knowability' of a pathogen, and quality and safety procedures. These were notably based on institutional memory: 'So when you build these capabilities and you have an institutional memory, then you are better able to react and respond more intuitively to the next sets of uncertainties. So, I think that is what we have in place.' -BM3. The Framework for ID hospital surge planning & response, Fig. 1 , anchors these two known core concepts as well as the known structure of staff, space, supplies and systems [14, 15] : the 'four Ss' (boxed in grey), to our narrative analysis. We then present new concepts that emerged beyond, across, and within these existing known elements. The Framework shows the concepts that emerged inductively from the interviews (boxed in white). We found the concept and understanding of a Hospital Surge Event itself important. We therefore begin the narration of the framework by elaborating the nature of Surge Events in our setting, as an extension of our first Objective and to situate our findings. These events are ultimately related to Typologies, described by Objective 2, which are represented by more or less emphasis on capacity and capability; all of which lead squarely to Coordination with respect to the 'four Ss'. The bulk of our new concepts largely include sub-components of the 'four Ss' , which will be further elaborated under the lessons learnt Objective 3.
