The time-course of disease entry into the U.S is presented in Fig. 2 as aggregate pandemic waves from all points of origin seeded for three R 0 's. For response planning purposes, we are most interested in the time leading up to the day in which ten infectious people appear in the U.S. (red dot). It is apparent that at least two clusters of median early disease arrival times appeared for each panel of Fig. 2 . The separation in clusters was most pronounced from the R 0 Z 1.53 simulation, followed by a decrease in separation as the R 0 values increased (see Fig. 3A ). More specifically, median early disease arrival times in the 25th and 75th percentile were under and over 25 days, respectively (see Table 1 ). This observation suggests that response planning could be conducted differently for points of origin depending on their respective quartile and R 0 classifications. When points of origin were grouped by their respective world regions (see Table 2 ), median early disease arrival times from Central America, the Caribbean, South America, Europe, the Near East, and Oceania (Honolulu) were shorter than those from Asia, Africa, Southeast Asia including India, and Oceania (Australia). Fig. 3B , in which median early disease arrival times into the U.S were plotted in decreasing magnitude for each point of origin and R 0, further elucidates this trend. A summary examination of how U.S. airports would be affected by the first ten symptomatic people entering the U.S. revealed that New York, Miami, Newark, Atlanta, Los Angeles would experience the earliest impact (Fig. 4A) . Further, detailed examinations of how these airports would be affected by points of origin from specific world regions are also presented: Central America, Caribbean, or South America (Fig. 4B) , Africa (Fig. 4C) , Europe (Fig. 4D) , Asia and Southeast Asia (Fig. 4E and F) , Near East (Fig. 4G) and Oceania (Fig. 4H ). Our analysis indicated that Los Angeles and San Francisco airports would experience the earliest impact for disease originating from Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania, while New York and Atlanta airports would experience one of the earliest impacts for diseases originating from all other world regions. Unlike our points of origin analysis, when we validated our model based on data from the 2009 pH1N1, we did not treat the U.S. and Mexico as one mixing body. Rather, we used Mexico City as a proxy for the village of La Gloria, Veracruz, Mexico, from where some of the earliest pH1N1 cases were reported. 3 In addition, we replicated the mean U.S. incidence rate of 0.997%, as reported by the CDC for pH1N1 cases in the U.S. between April and July 23, 2009 33 based on the U.S. cities used in the model (listed in Supplemental Table 2 ). In order to replicate the mean incidence rate of 0.997%, we evaluated two parameters: 1) The basic reproduction number, which represents a measure of the average number of people in a totally susceptible population to whom one infected individual transmits a disease, was allowed to vary between 1.4 and 1.7 in increments of 0.01. 2) The number of days it takes the model to predict the targeted mean incidence rate which best matches July 23, 2009, i.e., the 165th day after Feb 15th, 2009. We confirmed that our model generated a U.S. incidence rate of 1.0482% (standard deviation of 0.0067%) on the 165th day after disease onset for an R 0 of 1.53; these parameters are very close to the reported mean incidence rate of 0.997% by July 23, 2009. An R 0 of 1.53 is well within published estimates of R 0 for the 2009 pH1N1 which ranged from 1.4 to 1.6. 3,34
