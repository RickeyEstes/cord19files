The intracellular effects of IFN-a are mediated through a number of signalling pathways that are regulated by phosphorylation of signalling proteins and transcription factors. Therefore, we hypothesise that the neurological disease phenotype caused by IFN-a is the consequence of the differential activation of signalling pathways that primarily involve protein phosphorylation cascades (the 'phosphoproteome') ultimately leading to the regulation of transcription factor activity. Methods: High-throughput phosphoproteomics was used to determine the global and cell-type specific phosphoproteome in the murine CNS and glial cells, respectively. To determine the effects of IFN-a on the global phosphoproteome in the CNS, we used transgenic mice that chronically produce IFN-a in the CNS (GIFN mice). These mice recapitulate many of the key features of IFN-a related neuropathologies and symptoms. To assess cell-type specific changes, we analysed the phosphoproteome of IFN-a treated primary astrocytes and microglia. Results: Preliminary results showed a significant change in the phosphorylation of more than 800 proteins in the brain of GIFN mice. Gene ontology revealed that increased phosphorylation was associated with protein complex assembly, vesicle transport, antiviral response and ossification, whereas proteins with decreased phosphorylation related with cytoskeleton regulation, homeostasis and neurogenesis. Surprisingly, analysis of the phosphorylation sites revealed that members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family are major regulators of protein phosphorylation in the CNS of GIFN mice. : Their function was also tested in a human PBMC assay, in which few antibodies show a total inhibitory activity on all the lymphocyte populations while others are able to increase Treg proliferation, inhibiting at the same time CD4 and CD8. Conclusion: Current efforts are devoted to understanding the correlation between the different activities and the antibody characteristics, and in vivo testing in humanized mouse models is underway.

It is released by damaged cells and stimulates proinflammatory signaling pathways in various cell types such as T cells, innate lymphoid cells, mast cells and macrophages. IL-33 signals through a receptor complex at the cell membrane consisting of the IL-33 receptor (ST2) and the co-receptor IL-1RAcP. Blocking the IL-33/ST2 signaling axis with the soluble (extracellular) form of the IL-33 receptor (sST2) has been shown to be beneficial in experimental models of asthma. However, the effect is rather weak due to the low ligand binding affinity of sST2, implicating a need for better and stronger antagonists. We show here that a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domains of mouse ST2 and IL-1RAcP, further referred to as IL-33trap, is much more potent than sST2 in inhibiting mouse IL-33 activity in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to study the affinity of sST2 or IL-33trap for IL-33. To further compare sST2 and IL-33trap in vivo, mice were injected intra-peritoneally for 5 consecutive days with IL-33trap or sST2 followed by IL-33. Peritoneal eosinophil infiltration, as well as IL-5 and IL-13 production by splenocytes upon in vitro re-stimulation with PMA, were analyzed at day 6. Finally, the effect of the IL-33trap was analyzed in the house-dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma model in mice. Results: Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that IL-33trap has at least 30-fold higher affinity for IL-33 compared to sST2. We further studied the ability of sST2 and IL-33trap to neutralize the activity of recombinant IL-33 in vivo. Again treatment with IL-33trap showed considerably bigger potential to inhibit IL-33 activity when compared to sST2. Furthermore, IL-33trap delivery at the sensitization phase of HDM-induced asthma model strongly prevented infiltration of eosinophils and type II innate lymphoid cells in the lungs of sensitized mice challenged with HDM. Currently, we are further testing the therapeutic potential of IL-33trap when administered at later time points. Conclusion: Together, our studies demonstrate the improved potential of IL-33trap cytokine blockers for therapeutic use. Introduction: In response to viral infection, type I and type III interferons (IFNs) exert common antiviral activities through distinct receptor complexes, both of which activate shared IFN-triggered Jak-STAT pathway. Although the contributions of type I IFNs to antiviral defense have been well characterized, understanding of a distinct role for type III, or -k, IFNs for overall antiviral protection is still emerging, and their functions beyond antiviral protection are largely unknown. Methods: Mice lacking mature lymphocytes (Rag2 KO) and mouse strains with total or cell type-specific deficiency in IFN-k signaling were used to investigate contributions of adaptive immunity and type III IFNs to protection against heterologous simian rotavirus (RRV) infection in suckling mice. Results: We recently demonstrated that both type I and type III IFNs serve as important mediators for limiting replication of heterologous simian rotavirus RRV in suckling mice, and cooperate to engage antiviral defenses in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract. However, we also demonstrated that levels of RRV replication in the GI tract were not directly associated with diarrheal disease. Rag2 KO mice developed chronic infection but resolved RV-triggered diarrheal disease with the same kinetics as wild type mice, which clear RV infection. We also unexpectedly observed that, while RRV replicated to higher titers in Ifnlr-deficient animals, diarrhea was better controlled in the absence of IFN-k signaling. Reduced diarrhea with elevated viral titers was also detected in mice lacking IFN-k receptor only in intestinal epithelial compartment (villin-Cre-Ifnlr fl/fl mice), revealing dependency of the observed effect on the presence of IFN-k receptor in intestinal epithelial cells. Conclusion: Therefore, type III IFNs may exert a double-edged action in the GI tract by restricting of RV replication on the one hand, but promoting the intestinal pathology on the other. Introduction: Immunotherapy is currently used in combination with radio-and chemotherapy in order to improve the clinical outcome after surgical resection. IL-15 is of particular interest, as it targets and stimulates the immune system, but the optimal dosing regimen still needs to be determined. The aim of the present study is to define these treatment modalities with an IL-15 agonist. Methods: In order to study different tumor types, we used two models in two different mouse strains. We then compared two dosing regimens, depending on whether it was a metastatic or solid tumor model. For comparison, Kruskall Wallis and Kaplan Meier analyses were performed. We also looked at the role of CD8 T cells and NK cells, and their interaction within in vivo depletion studies and ex vivo proliferation assays. In each case, expansion of immune cells was tested by flow cytometry. Results: It appears that in the metastatic model, two injections of the IL-15 agonist are sufficient to reach the maximal therapeutic effect, whereas several injections are needed to get a therapeutic benefit in solid tumors. A pharmacological analysis showed that this difference was correlated to a decrease in NK cell response to several injections of the IL-15 agonist, whereas the CD8 T central memory cell response remained high, even after multiple injections. Interestingly, the lack of NK cell response was restored by CD8 T cell depletion, suggesting a close relationship between NK and CD8 T cells. : We found activation of cord blood myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, with concordant increases in inflammatory cytokines in preterm infants compared to controls. Preterm infants had higher levels of central memory cells with a Th1 phenotype, as well as increased expression of T cell activation genes compared to healthy controls. Importantly, fetal T cells proliferated robustly and produced IFN-k when stimulated with fetal antigen presenting cells and maternal antigens in patients with PTL, while such alloreactivity was low in healthy pregnancies. The levels of maternal microchimerism were increased among preterm infants, a possible source of priming. Finally, products of T cells immune activation, resulted in uterine contractility in vitro, and direct fetal liver injection of activated T cells in pregnant mice resulted in fetal resorption, a process that can be prevented by the injection of IFN-k KO and TNFa KO activated T cells. : Surprisingly, neither IRF5 expression nor activation showed any significant difference between risk and non-risk carriers. Furthermore, the percentage of naïve B cells and transitional B cells did not show significant differences. However, the percentage of plasmablasts was significantly higher in homozygous risk carriers as compared to non-risk carriers. Conclusion: Results from the GAP Registry indicate alternate function(s) for IRF5 that is not directly related to expression or activation. Given that plasmablasts are over-represented in SLE, these findings support an early effect of the IRF5 risk genotype on SLE disease onset. Furthermore, the fact that autoantibodies occur in SLE patient blood prior to disease onset, data presented here suggest a contribution of the IRF5 risk genotype to multiple aspects of disease pathogenesis. In conclusion, this is the first finding of an IRF5 genotype-phenotype effect on SLE susceptibility in healthy donors. Introduction: Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a potent immunoregulatory enzyme which catalytic and non-catalytic effects are involved in the regulation of immunity and autoimmune diseases. Cytokines are important modulator of the expression of IDO1: interferon-c upregulates IDO1 in dendritic cells while interleukin 6 (IL-6) promotes proteasomal degradation of the enzyme. Current data show that approximately 25% of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) exhibit a post-translational (and not genetic) defect of IDO1 in a subset of PBMC which is characterized by a IDO1 high IDO1 low IL-6 high phenotype. Interestingly, this phenotype can be completely corrected by co-incubation of PBMCs with tocilizumab, a licensed IL-6 receptor blocker. Therefore, data indicate the existence of a subset of individuals with T1D who may gain clinical benefit in restoring IDO1 immunoregulatory mechanisms by treatment with tocilizumab. Methods: We aim to verify whether the profile identified from PBMCs may also be demonstrated in pancreata by using tissue specimens obtainable from the network of pancreatic organ donors (nPOD). Pancreatic sections from T1D, T2D patients and non-diabetic were analysed for IDO1 and IL-6 expression and localization by mmunohistochemistry. Results: Results show that IL-6 can be produced by alpha and beta cells in diabetics and non-diabetic donors. Compared to islets from non-diabetic controls, expression levels of IL-6 tend to be higher in T2D donors and lower in double autoantibody positive donors. On the other hand, IDO is predominantly produced by beta cells. Interestingly, IDO is not expressed in insulin deficient islet from T1D donors whereas it is still expressed in insulin containing islets. Introduction: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is often thought of as a disease driven by molecular pathways related to autoreactive B cells and anti-nuclear antibodies. However, therapeutics targeting of B cells, including BAFF blockade, have been only partially effective in SLE. NF-jB Inducing Kinase (NIK) mediates BAFF signaling and also noncanonical NF-jB signaling downstream of non-BAFF/BR3 TNFR family members. We thus hypothesized that a NIK inhibitor might be more efficacious than BAFF blockade in lupus. Methods: IFNa-AdV treated NZB/W F1 lupus prone mice were used. Gene expression was monitored by RNAseq, ELISA and Fluidigm. Results: To address this, we generated NIK small molecule inhibitors that are highly selective and potent. In cellular assays, these molecules inhibit noncanonical NF-jB signaling downstream of multiple TNFRSF family member signaling, including CD40, OX40, and TWEAK. In order to differentiate the effects of NIK inhibition and BAFF blockade in vivo, we compared NIK inhibition with BAFF blockade in the context of IFNa-accelerated NZB/W F1 lupus prone mice. As predicted, NIK inhibition recapitulated the pharmacological effects of BAFF blockade. Furthermore, we were also able to demonstrate a role for NIK in OX40 driven T cell costimulation in vitro, and T effector cell number in IFNa-NZB/W F1 mice. Finally, TWEAK inducible genes in renal tubulointerstitial cells were highly NIK dependent, and their expression correlated with disease associated pro-inflammatory genes in IFNa-NZB/W F1 lupus prone mice. Indeed, expression of these genes was suppressed in NIK SMI treated, but not anti-BAFF treated, IFNa-NZB/W F1 lupus mice. Conclusion: Collectively, our data suggest that NIK inhibition affects multiple disease-relevant pathways and will therefore have superior efficacy compared to BAFF inhibition in SLE. Introduction: ABCF1 is an ABC transporter family protein that has been shown to regulate innate immune response and is a risk gene for autoimmune pancreatitis. Unlike other members of ABC transporter family, ABCF1 lacks trans-membrane domains and is thought to function in translation initiation through an interaction with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2). Methods: In order to study ABCF1 in development and disease, we used a single gene trap insertion in the ABCF1 gene in embryonic stem cells (ES cells) that allowed lineage tracing of the endogenous ABCF1 promoter by following the expression of a b-galactosidase reporter gene. From the ES cells, heterozygous mice (ABCF1+/-) were produced. No live born ABCF1-/-progeny were ever generated and the lethality was not mouse strain specific. Results: ABCF1-/-mice were found to be embryonic lethal at 3.5 days post coitum (dpc), while ABCF1+/-mice appeared developmentally normal. ABCF1+/-mice were fertile and showed no significant differences in their anatomy when compared to their wild type littermates. The ABCF1 promoter was found to be active in all tissues in adult mice, with varying levels in different cell types. Furthermore, we observed high promoter activity in the blastocysts and embryos. Conclusion: Overall, ABCF1 expression in embryos is required for development and its expression in adults was highly correlated with actively proliferating and differentiating cell types. Introduction: IL-17A drives the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease but promotes immunity to fungal infections. To date, the IL-17 signaling pathway is still not well understood. IL-17A binding to the IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) initiates recruitment of adaptor proteins such Act1 and TRAF6, leading to activation of the NF-jB and MAPK pathways. These pathways are negatively regulated by the A20/ TNFAIP3 ubiquitin editing protein. The TNIP1 gene is associated with autoimmune diseases in GWAS studies. Its gene product, ABIN1, is an A20-associated factor. Accordingly, we hypothesized that ABIN1 might function as an inhibitor in the IL-17 signaling pathway. Methods: Using ST2 cells or murine fibroblasts, we performed siRNA knockdown, mRNA extraction for RT-PCR analysis, or protein extraction for western blot analysis, and analysis of the supernatant by ELISA. Additionally, HEK293T cells were used to analyze proteinprotein interaction by overexpression of proteins of interest, immunoprecipitation and WB. Promoter activation was measured by luciferase assays. Results: First, knockdown of ABIN1 in the murine stromal cell line ST2 led to enhanced expression of IL-17-dependent genes such as lipocalin 2 (Lcn2). Reconstitution of ABIN1-deficient fibroblasts with the ABIN1 gene normalized Lcn2 expression. Surprisingly, A20 was dispensable for ABIN1-mediated inhibition, as ABIN-1 knockdown enhanced IL-17-dependent signals in A20-deficient cell lines. Similar to A20, TRAF6 deubiquitination was enhanced in the presence of ABIN1. Since many negative regulatory signals are part of ligandinducible feedback loops, we investigated whether expression of ABIN1 was regulated by IL-17R signaling. Interestingly, while mRNA expression of ABIN1 was upregulated following IL-17A stimulation of cells, ABIN1 protein levels decreased. Conclusion: Collectively, these data indicate that ABIN1 inhibits the IL-17R signaling pathway independently of A20 through a feedback loop that differentially impacts ABIN1 mRNA and protein. Methods: Here, we have evaluated the proinflammatory role of OSM in a mouse model of skin inflammation induced by intradermal injection of murine OSM-encoding adenovirus (AdOSM) in comparison with AdIL-6. We then adressed its contribution in the model of imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Results: Firstly, we showed that OSM potently regulates the expression of genes involved in skin inflammation and epidermal differentiation in murine primary keratinocytes. In vivo, intradermal injection of AdOSM in mouse ears led to skin inflammation with epidermal thickening and keratinocyte proliferation, while minimal effect was observed after AdIL-6 injection. OSM overexpression in the skin increased the expression of antimicrobial peptides, chemokines and Th1/Th2 cytokines, in correlation with neutrophil and macrophage infiltration. In contrast, OSM downregulated the expression of epidermal differentiation genes, such as cytokeratin-10 or filaggrin. However, OSM expression was not required in the murine model of psoriasis induced by topical application of imiquimod, as demonstrated by the inflammatory phenotype of OSM-deficient mice or wild-type mice treated with anti-OSM antibodies. Conclusion: Collectively, these results support the proinflammatory role of OSM when it is overexpressed in the skin, but its expression is not necessary for the development of psoriasis-like skin inflammation after topical application of imiquimod. Methods: We constructed experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model to detect whether CCDC134 expression is correlated with autoimmune disease. In EAE model, CCDC134 transgenic mice and rhCCDC134 protein were used. Moreover, the disease symptoms were observed and histopathology changes were analyzed. Inflammation reaction was detected by FACS, ELISA and real-time PCR. Results: In this study, we found that CCDC134 level in mouse sera was increased in the onset and peak stage of EAE. Moreover, we demonstrated that CCDC134 was efficacious in a model of EAE that mirrors chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. A short-term systemic treatment with recombinant CCDC134 reduced clinical severity and incidence of EAE. In addition, we used CCDC134transgenic mice model and found that the onset and severity of EAE, the appearance of inflammatory infiltrates in spinal cord and the subsequent demyelination and axonal damage were significantly alleviated in CCDC134-transgenic mice compared with control mice. We further sought to elucidate the basis of CCDC134 protective effect on EAE by characterizing the T effector/regulatory responses. And the presence/activation of encephalitogenic Th1/Th17 cells and several inflammatory mediators in peripheral lymphoid organs and central nervous system were down-regulated in CCDC134-transgenic mice. Conclusion: These findings indicate that CCDC134 plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of EAE and provide insights into the role of recombinant CCDC134 as a unique therapeutic agent for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

S100A8 also triggers the differentiation of myeloid cells. In this study, we investigated the contribution of S100A8 to differentiation and chemotactic activity in the human eosinophilic leukemia cell line EoL-1. Conclusion: Collectively, these findings reveal the ASC/IL-18 axis as a potential therapeutic target in GC. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Stroma plays an important role in breast cancer occurrence and development, and fibroblasts are the main components of the breast cancer stroma. In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the effect of cancer stromal fibroblasts on breast cancer, in this study, FSP-1(fibroblast-specific protein-1) expression was investigated in human fibroblasts co-cultured in vitro or co-growth in vivo with human breast cancer cells and its impact on breast cancer growth. Methods: Human fibroblast line ESF was co-cultured with human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 using Transwell method. The level of FSP-1 mRNA was examined in the co-cultured ESF cells by RT-qPCR. The expression levels of FSP-1 protein were detected by immunofluorescence flow cytometry. The proliferation of cocultured and single cultured MDA-MB-231 cells was tested using Cell Counting Kit-8(CCK-8) method. FSP-1 expression in the breast cancer tissue of tumor-burdened nude mice was analyzed using immunofluorescence and laser confocal microscope, and the effect of FSP-1 on tumor growth of tumor-burdened nude mice was examined. Experimental data were analyzed using SPSS statistics software, version 17.0. Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation. The differences between two groups were analyzed by the Student's t-test. A probability value (P) of <0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Results: We demonstrate that in the absence of STAT1, the lethal virus-induced disease caused by intestinal MNV infection is associated with MNV dissemination beyond mucosal barrier surfaces and hyperactive cytokine production in virus-specific T cells. In a model of natural MNV exposure where STAT1-sufficient and deficient littermates acquire MNV as a part of their commensal microbiome, Stat1 -/mice accumulate elevated numbers of virusspecific effector T cells and have high viral burdens in multiple tissues that are associated with pathological tissue inflammation. Mechanistically, the combination of uncontrolled viral replication, heightened activation and impaired resolution of antiviral T cell responses contributes to widespread viral-induced disease. Conclusion: Together, these data suggest that in addition to limiting early viral replication in infected cells, STAT1-dependent signaling is critical for establishing tolerance to persistent enteric viral exposure and limiting viral-induced disease.

A growing body of evidence demonstrates that type I IFN plays a detrimental role in TB pathogenesis, likely by interfering with IFN-k-dependent immunity. Methods: Using the murine aerosol model of TB and a virulent strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (BTB 02-171) that induces high levels of type I IFN, we reveal a novel mechanism by which type I IFN may confer protection to M. tuberculosis infection in the absence of IFN-k signaling. Results: Absence of both type I and type II IFN receptors led to a strikingly increased level of arginase 1 (Arg1) gene expression and activity in infected lungs, characteristic of alternatively activated macrophages. This correlated with increased bacterial burden and pathology, and decreased survival, as compared to mice deficient in either receptor. Increased expression of other genes associated with alternatively activated macrophages, as well as increased expression of Th2-associated cytokines and decreased TNF expression, were also observed. Thus, in the absence of IFN-k signaling, type I IFN suppressed the switching of macrophages from a more protective classically activated to a more permissive alternatively activated phenotype. Conclusion: Together, our data support a model in which suppression of alternative macrophage activation by type I IFN during M. tuberculosis infection, in the absence of IFN-k signaling, contributes to host protection. Disclosure of Interest: None declared. Introduction: Similar to Type I IFNs (IFN-a/b), Type III IFNs (IFN-k1,2,3,4) exert antiviral and antiproliferative effects through a JAK-STAT mediated pathway that activates ISGF3 (STAT1/STAT2/IRF9) and consequently induces the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). IFN-ks signal through a receptor complex distinct from that of IFNa/b, composed of IL-10R2 and IFN-kR, which appears to be preferentially expressed on epithelial cells. This suggests that IFN-k's primary role is to provide antiviral protection to mucosal compartments. IFN-kR-deficient mice have been developed, but due to the overlapping activities of type III and type I IFNs, a unique role for IFN-k in antiviral immunity has yet to be elucidated. Most viral infections induce the expression of both type I and type III IFNs, but it is unclear which cells are responsible for IFN-k production in vivo, and whether IFN-k production is induced by the same mechanisms which trigger type I IFN synthesis. Methods: In order to identify the source(s) of type III IFNs in the course of an in vivo virus infection, we have generated a novel IFN-k reporter mouse in which the IFN-k2 coding sequence was replaced with eGFP by homologous recombination, while maintaining the IFN-k2 promoter regions and UTRs intact. While both IFN-k2 alleles have been replaced by eGFP, these mice retain the gene encoding IFN-k3 intact. Using the IFN-k reporter mouse we have now been able to identify IFN-k-producing cell populations following Poly I:C treatment and RNA virus infection in vivo. : Results from our IFN-k reporter mice show that intravenously administered Poly I:C (a dsRNA mimetic) induces IFN-k expression predominantly from CD8a dendritic cells in the spleen. Infection of the gastrointestinal tract of the indicator mice with rhesus rotavirus (RRV), a dsRNA virus of the family Reoviridae, shows the epithelial cells of the small intestine as the predominant source of IFN-k induced by this pathogen. We also observed that viral titers between IFN-k reporter mice and non-reporter wild type mice of the same genetic background were equivalent following RRV infection, suggesting that IFN-k3 alone is sufficient to elicit adequate type III IFN-based antiviral response and, therefore, the reporter mice are not expected to show enhanced susceptibility to virus infections. Methods: Monocytes were isolated by CD14 selection, and differentiated into macrophages in vitro with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF) alone, or in the presence of IFNL3. Monocyte and macrophage IFNL responsiveness and IFNL receptor expression were assayed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) of interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression, Western blot (phospho-STAT1) and flow cytometry. The pro-inflammatory role of IFNL3 during macrophage differentiation was examined using RNA sequencing and qPCR, mass spectrometry, and functional readouts including chemotaxis and phagocytosis assays. Fluorescent microscopy was used to identify IFNL receptor expressing macrophages in tissues affected by chronic inflammation. Results: Upon examining IFNL sensitivity in vitro, we demonstrate macrophages but not monocytes are more responsive to IFNL3 than myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells; the only other leukocyte populations with a significant IFNL response [4] . To investigate the role of IFNLs on macrophage maturation and function, human monocytes from healthy subjects were differentiated into macrophages using either GM-CSF (pro-inflammatory) or M-CSF (antiinflammatory), alone or in combination with IFNL3. Macrophages matured with GM-CSF expressed more IFNL receptor (IFNLR1) and were more responsive to IFNL3, supporting their role as proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, IFNL3 increased the expression of numerous inflammatory/chemotactic cytokines and activation markers as measured by qPCR and flow cytometry respectively. Functionally, macrophages differentiated in the presence of IFNL3 were more phagocytic towards apoptotic cells and more chemoattractant towards CD3, NK and NKT cells. Lastly, we demonstrated an accumulation of IFNLR1 expressing macrophages in numerous chronic inflammatory conditions, supporting their potential to drive a pro-inflammatory state. Conclusion: Our data suggests that IFNLs may contribute to chronic inflammatory disease by stimulating a pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages, thus driving an adverse immune cell response. : Tofacitinib-treated mice displayed decreased serum cytokines levels including IL-17, IFN-k, and TNF-a and splenocytes showed reduced expression of type I/II IFN signature genes (IP-10, MX1, and STAT1). Reduced renal and skin inflammation, lower levels of ANA, diminished deposition of immunoglobulin complex and decreased albumin/creatinine ratio in the urine were also observed. Furthermore, neutrophils derived form the treated mice showed reduced production of neutrophil extracellular traps and the drug induced significant improvements in endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and endothelial differentiation. Conclusion: Taken together, these data suggest that, by modulating both the adaptive and innate arms of the immune system and interfering with cytokine signaling and the interferon-driven genetic program, tofacitinib ameliorates the SLE phenotype and vascular dysfunction in lupus-prone mice. This supports the concept that tofacitinib and other JAK inhibitors may be beneficial in SLE. Despite their high metabolism, bats have very long lifespans 3.5 times those of comparably sized non-flying mammals 3 . However, the molecular mechanisms for these observations are totally unknown. As aberrant or excessive inflammasome activation has recently been linked to viral pathogenesis and age-related disease, one can hypothesize that differential regulation of inflammasome signaling may play a role in some of the biological features of bats. Methods: Here we investigated the inflammasome activation in bat primary immune cells and cell lines. Results: Our data show that activation is significantly reduced in bat cells compared to human or mouse counterparts. There is low induction of ASC speck formation and caspase-1 activation in response to various natural and synthetic stimuli. Conclusion: Our result so far suggests the involvement of multiple molecular mechanisms at different steps of the signaling pathway. These include unique loss of a sensor gene family at the genomic level and altered expression and function of key inflammasome proteins. inflammation. The non-chemotactic function of CCR6 in the CD4 T cells during inflammation and autoimmunity is not known. Being a GPCR, CCR6 has the ability to activate battery of downstream signaling pathways in the cell. Thus we hypothesized that intrinsic signaling from CCR6 along with other co-stimulatory signals can influence the differentiation, plasticity and function of Th17 and regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs) during autoimmunity. Methods: Acute colitis was induced in the C57BL/6 or CCR6 -/mice by giving 2% dextran sodium sulphate (DSS, w/v) in the drinking water. Development and progression of colitis was monitored daily for weight loss, loose stool and bloody diarrhea. Spleen, mesenteric lymph node, Payer's patches and lamina propria CD4+ effector T cells and CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells (Treg) were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunohistological staining. Splenic CD4+CD25-T cells from naïve C57BL/6 or CCR6 -/mice were cultured in presence of anti-mouse CD3e mAb, IL-2, and irradiated T cell depleted spleenocytes together with CD4+ T cell polarizing reagents (for Th17, IL-6, TGF-b and IL-23; for Treg, TGF-b). CCR6-CCL20 signaling was studied in CCR6gfp-Jurkat cells and in primary CD4 cells sorted from CCR6gfp +/mice by stimulating them with recombinant CCL20. Results: CCL20 inhibits TGF-b1 induced Treg differentiation and directing them towards pathogenic Th17 lineage. CCL20 increased the expression of Th17 associated molecules such as Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), IL-21, IL-22, IL-23 and IL-23R on the cultured Tregs, and inhibited the surface expression of suppressor molecules such as CD39, CD73 and FasL on cultured Tregs. Under Th17 differentiating condition, CCR6 signaling further increased the RORct expression and Th17 associated molecules. Furthermore, CCR6 induces phosphorylation of Akt, mTOR, and STAT3. CCR6 activation promotes binding of RORct on conserved non-coding region 5 (CNS5) of IL-17A promoter. CCR6-/-CD4 T cells showed reduced phosphorylation of STAT3 and differentiation of Th17 cells and prevented the development of autoimmune colitis. Analysis of PBMCs of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients showed increased RORct+ expression on CCR6+ CD4 T cells compared to healthy volunteers.
