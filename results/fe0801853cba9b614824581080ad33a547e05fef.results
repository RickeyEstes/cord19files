There were 383 hypotensive bradycardic patients treated by paramedics during the study period from 1 December 2001 to 30 November 2003; 232 responded to initial treatment and did not meet the study inclusion criteria (Figure 1 ). There were 151 patients (39%) eligible for TCP or dopamine and 83 (55%) were enrolled successfully. Demographic characteristics of the 68 eligible cases that were not enrolled were similar to those of enrolled patients, with the exception of a slightly higher initial heart rate and systolic blood pressure in the patients not enrolled (Table 1) Of the 83 cases successfully enrolled by paramedics, only 1 case was rejected by the CVC; a patient randomized to dopamine after arrival at the Emergency Department (ED), and 82 were included for analysis. Follow-up to discharge or survival to 30 days in hospital was obtained in all cases.
