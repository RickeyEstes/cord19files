The first step in this study was to select case and control populations for GWAS based on available information. Multidimensional scaling of case and control cats from both the USA and Denmark indicated that the two populations were closely related but geographically distinguishable, but with no stratification between cases and controls within the same countries (Fig. 2 ). Given these facts, and assuming that FIP susceptibility traits have been under neutral selection since 1925 when the breed was formally recognized, a decision was made to first compare all case and control cats regardless of country of origin (Table 1) . A second analysis involved stratifying cases and controls by limiting cases to cats 1½ years of age or younger (the most susceptible) and the controls to cats 2 years of age or older (the most resistant) ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). Genomic inflation factor (GIF) values for both analysis groups were 1.35 and 1.43, respectively. The highest ranking SNPs in both analyses are shown in Table 2 . All potential candidate genes involved with immune responses within 500 kb of each SNP were identified, Table 2 Highest ranking SNPs from analysis-1 (34 cases vs. 151 controls) and analysis-2 (20 cases vs. 88 controls) based on unadjusted P(raw) and corrected P(Bonf) probabilities, and candidate genes known to be strongly involved in immune responses. and if no candidate genes were identified the search was extended to a distance of 1 Mb. When the 34 FIP cases and 151 controls were analyzed (analysis-1), the strongest associations (−log 10 P(raw) ≥ 5.0) were found on chr.A2, chr.C2 and chr.D4 (Table 2, Fig. 3a) . Given a Bonferroni correction of −log 10 P(raw) ≥ 5.8 for genome-wide significance, only the highest ranked SNP on chr.A2 attained significance (p = 0.048) ( Table 2 ). The Manhattan plot of analysis-2 cats demonstrated 3 peaks with 6 SNPs having −log 10 P(raw) ≥ 5.0 on chr.A1, chr.A3, and chr.E2 (Table 2, Fig. 3b ). Only the three highest ranking SNPs on chr.A1 and highest ranked SNP on chr.E2 had genome-wide significance after Bonferroni correction (p = 0.009-0.043) ( Table 2) . Two SNPs on chr.A2 (log 10 P(raw) = 4.86) and chr.C2 (−log 10 P(raw) = 4.93) were just below the cutoff at −log 10 P(raw) ≥ 5.0 ( Table 2 ). The SNP on chr.A2 was identical to the highest ranking SNP identified in analysis-1, further bolstering its significance. The chr.C2 SNP identified in analysis-2 was separated by only 300 kb from the second ranking SNP on analysis-1. Although neither SNP was significant upon Bonferroni correction, their proximity and high ranking by both analyses was taken as reason to also interrogate this chr.C2 region for candidate genes. GWAS of analysis-1 and -2 cats identified five potential candidate genes on four different chromosomes: engulfment and cell motility protein 1 (ELMO1), Ras-related GTP binding A (RRAGA), tumor necrosis factor superfamily 10 (TNFSF10), and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 and 2 (ERAP1 and ERAP2) ( Table 2) . No candidate genes were identified on chr.A3 and chr.E2, both of which demonstrated strong associations in analysis-2. Only a single high ranking SNP was associated with ELMO1 ( Fig. 4) and RRAGA (Fig. 5) , while several high ranking SNPs were associated with TNFSF10 (Fig. 6) . Nineteen of 30 highest ranking SNPs in analysis-2, including the top three ranked SNPs, were on chr.A1 (data not shown). Seventeen of the 19 SNPs formed a 10.5 Mb region flanked by the three highest ranking SNPs (Fig. 7) . This region contained 31 or more genes, two of which (ERAP1 and ERAP2) were strong candidates at positions chr.A1.158,772,633 and chr.A1.158,978,956 bp, respectively. These two genes were near the center of the 10.5 Mb region. (b) analysis-2 containing 20 cases (1½ years and younger) and 88 controls (2 years or older).
