3.1. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that epidemic PEDV strain SH2012 belongs to genotype 2b, so its S gene was used to construct a VSV-based PEDV vaccine Currently, all four PEDV subtypes are endemic in pig farms in China, including vaccine strains (G1a), new variants (G1b), past epidemic strains (G2a), and current dominant epidemic strains (G2b) (Lee, 2015) . Given this issue, G2b epidemic or related strains circulating in the field should be employed to develop next generation vaccines. However, a commercial vaccine against G2b strains is still unavailable. SH2012 is a virulent PEDV isolate collected in 2012 in Shanghai, China; this strain caused âˆ¼100% morbidity and > 90% mortality in suckling piglets. In our study, a phylogenetic analysis based on the PEDV S gene indicated that SH2012 maps to G2b (Fig. 1) and is very closely related to AH 2012, which is regarded as the origin of the PEDV outbreak during 2013-2014 in the USA and Canada (Huang et al., 2013) . However, SH2012 has a long genetic distance from the prototype CV777, which was identified as belonging to the G1 genotype (Fig. 1) . There are at least four neutralizing domains in the PEDV S protein: 1) N-terminal domain (NTD) region (Li et al., 2016) ; 2) COE domain (residues 499-638) (Chang et al., 2002) ; 3) S1D region (residues 636-789), which spans the S1-S2 junction region (Sun et al., 2008) , and 4) an epitope at the S protein C-terminus (residues 1371-1377) (Cruz et al., 2008) . Alignments of full-length S protein amino acid sequences indicated that the similarity between SH2012 and CV777 is 93.2%, and those between SH2012 and AH2012 or Corolado 2013 were each more than 99% (Supl. Fig. 1 ). The major differences among various strains existed within the S1 region, particularly the NTD domain. Similarities of S1 amino acid sequences among SH 2012, AH 2012, and the US representative strain Colorado 2013 could reach 100%, whereas their similarity to CV777 was only 82.71%, typically with 5 AA insertion at two sites (AA59-62, AA140) and 2 AA deletions at site AA160 in the S protein of G2b strains (SH 2012 , AH 2012 , or Corolado 2013 in contrast to CV777 (Supl. Fig. 1 ). There were a total of 11 mutations existing in the COE and S1D regions of SH2012 compared with CV777, of which three were located in S1D and eight in the COE domain. The Cterminal epitope is a highly conserved epitope; not surprisingly, no difference was identified among CV777 and the G2b strains included in our study. The observed differences, especially within the neutralizing epitope(s), may have contributed to the current CV777 vaccine failure in the field . Thus, given the high similarity of the SH2012 S protein to the predominant PEDV G2b strains, it was used to construct a VSV-based PEDV subunit vaccine.
