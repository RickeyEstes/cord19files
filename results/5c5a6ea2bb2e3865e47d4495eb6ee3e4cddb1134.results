Using a 4-fold rise in IFA immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody titers between the paired acute and convalescent serum specimens to define acute infection, 11 6 .1% (11 of 180) of the patients were diagnosed with acute murine typhus and 3.9% (7 of 180) were with acute scrub typhus. Using a cut-off titer of 400 as evidence of acute infection as previously described, 12 the sensitivity and specificity of acute specimen IgM IFA were 14.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4-57.9) and 97.7% (95% CI: 94.2-99.4) for scrub typhus, 9.1% (95% CI: 0.2-41.3) and 99.4% (95% CI: 96.7-100) for murine typhus (raw data not shown), respectively. One hundred and four whole blood fractions and 180 buffy coat fractions were tested by JBAIDS PCR. Three and six corresponding serum fractions were tested for the O. tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia assay, respectively. The overall positivity of the O. tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia assays was 1.7% (3 of 180) and 2.2% (4 of 180), respectively, when any of the blood fractions gave a positive result. The specificity of O. tsutsugamushi assay was 99.0% (95% CI: 94.6-100) using whole blood, 99.4% (95% CI: 96.8-100) using buffy coat, and 99.4% (95% CI: 96.8-100) when the results of all blood fractions were combined. The sensitivity of the assay using whole blood, buffy coat, and combined blood fractions was 50.0% (95% CI: 6.8-93.2), 28.6% (95% CI: 3.7-71.0), and 28.6% (95% CI: 3.7-71.0), respectively. Serum fractions did not correctly identify either of the patients with positive whole blood or buffy coat fractions. A total of seven patients had serologically confirmed acute scrub typhus infection by paired IgM IFA. Of these, three patients were children and only the buffy coat fraction was tested by PCR, none of which gave positive results. Of the four adult patients, two were positive by PCR in both whole blood and buffy coat fractions, but were negative in the serum fraction. There was perfect correlation between results obtained from whole blood and buffy coat fractions. One additional adult patient who had no evidence of acute scrub typhus infection by paired IgM IFA was positive for PCR in all blood fractions. For Rickettsia assay, the specificity was 100% in all blood fractions, although as a consequence of the small number of serum specimens tested (N = 6), the 95% CI for the serum fraction result was wide (2.5-100). The sensitivity of the assay using whole blood, buffy coat, serum, and combined blood fractions was 30.0% (95% CI: 6.7-65.2), 27.3% (95% CI: 6.0-61.0), 40.0% (95% CI: 5.3-85.3), and 36.4% (95% CI: 10.9-69.2), respectively. A total of 11 patients had serologically confirmed positive acute murine typhus infection by paired IgM IFA. One patient was a child and only buffy coat fraction was tested by PCR, which had a negative result. Of the 10 adult patients, four patients were positive by PCR in whole blood and/or buffy coat fractions. There was poor correlation between the results obtained from whole blood and buffy coat fractions and the corresponding serum fraction. For PCR was more sensitive than acute specimen IgM IFA. It is probable that a combination of both molecular and antibodybased detection assays would be the ideal panel to adequately cover all diagnostic window periods and might allow confirmation of infection quickly enough to be useful for patient management. 13, 14 A further evaluation of these real-time PCR assays in a larger prospective study is warranted.
