Inhibition of HTNV production in Vero-E6 cells by shRNAs shRNAs were designed to specifically target the S and M genes of HTNV. The efficacies of the shRNAs in the inhibition of HTNV replication were evaluated by transfecting the Vero-E6 cells with 60 nmol/L of S1, S2, M1 and M2 shRNAs fol-Liu YY et al Acta Pharmacologica Sinica npg lowed by the infection of the cells with 100 TCID 50 /0.2 mL of HTNV76-118. As illustrated in Figure 1A and 1B, the transfections of the 4 shRNAs resulted in the inhibitions of viral RNA transcription at 24 hpi of 65.72%±1.7% (S1), 56.8%±4.8% (S2), 55.17%±6.9% (M1) and 64.9%±5.7% (M2) (P<0.05 vs the virus group). When the cells were treated with the shRNAs at 48 hpi, the efficiencies of viral gene inhibition were 91.76%±2.29% (S1), 78.28%±6.46% (S2), 68.72%±8.8% (M1) and 95.23%±6.25% (M2) (P<0.05 vs virus group). No protective effect was observed in the Vero-E6 cells treated with shCRK. For the yield-reduction assay, culture samples were collected at 96 hpi, and the titers were determined. The inhibitory effects of the four shRNAs against HTNV replication were evaluated. The four shRNAs reduced the HTNV yields by approximately 4 log 10 (S) and 2 log 10 (M) compared with the control ( Figure 1C ). Based on these results and the viral antigen expression results detected by IFA (data not shown), we concluded that the shRNAs that targeted the S and M segments of the HTNV gene were able to inhibit RNA transcript and virus production in the HTNV-infected cells and that shRNA-S1 and shRNA-M2 exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect against HTNV. Thus, shRNA-S1 and shRNA-M2 were further selected for insertion into the pSilencer-3.0-H1 of the RNAi vector, and the resultant vectors were designated pSilencer-S and pSilencer-M.
