With regards to the judges, two of the judges had finished 3 years of specialty training in Internal Medicine, 1 judge had finished 1 year of specialty training in Internal Medicine, and 1 judge had finished medical school. The calculated interclass correlation coefficient was sufficiently large at 0.599 (95% CI 0.503, 0.689), so the results of the inter-rater reliability study show that reliability was sufficient for the judges' responses to be used as a reference standard.
