Thirty-two confirmed patients, each with a single severe episode of HRV infection were admitted during 2012. Cases presented a seasonal pattern along the year but were detected continuously during 8 months from March to October (summer to spring in southern hemisphere) (Fig. 1) . Of 135 adult patients admitted with SARI during year 2012 with a confirmed viral etiology, HRV ranked second only to influenza infections (23.7% versus 37.8% for influenza). Mean age was elevated (79.5 years) and 90% were older than 60 years (Table 1) . Only two patients lived in a longterm care facility, but near 20% were bedridden. Over 50% of the patients had two or more comorbidities, mainly chronic pulmonary conditions, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or neurologic diseases. Cancer, morbid obesity, or kidney disease were not common. No case was associated with chronic liver disease and only one patient was immunosuppressed. Previous tobacco smoking affected near a third of this population and current smoking was still admitted by two out of 32 patients. Almost one-third of patients with chronic lung disease were domiciliary oxygen users (Table 1) .
