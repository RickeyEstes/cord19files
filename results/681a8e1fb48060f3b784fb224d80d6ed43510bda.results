RSV was detected in nasal swabs from only two infants (1.8 %). By contrast, rhinovirus was detected in nasal swabs from 16 infants (14.5 %) with a median cycle threshold value of 29 (IQR 26-34). Molecular typing assay revealed rhinovirus species: six rhinovirus-A (5.5 %), one rhinovirus-B (0.9 %), eight rhinovirus-C (7.3 %), and one untypeable (0.9 %). Infants with detected rhinovirus were older than those without (4.3 vs. 2.6 months; P = 0.03), and were more likely to attend daycare (43.8 vs. 9.6 %; P = 0.002) and be exposed to passive smoke in home (12.5 vs. 2.1 %; P = 0.04). There were no other significant differences in demographic or clinical characteristics between the two groups (Table 1) . In a sensitivity analysis, we limited our analysis to infants who were completely symptom-free at the time of the screening phone call and enrollment. In this subset of 96 infants, RSV was detected in one infant (1.0 %) and rhinovirus in 11 (11.5 %). Molecular typing assay revealed six rhinovirus-A (6.3 %), no rhinovirus-B, four rhinovirus-C (4.2 %), and one untypeable (1.1 %).
