Full-length genome sequence analysis. The sequence analysis showed that the full-length genomic sequence of JSCZ1601 (accession no. KY070587) was 28,033 nt long, excluding the polyadenylated sequences, and included the following genes and UTRs: 5′ UTR (293 nt), ORF1a (12,354 nt), ORF1b (8,037 nt), S (4,155 nt), ORF3 (675 nt), E (231 nt), M (681 nt), N (1,326 nt), and 3′ UTR (334 nt). We compared the full-length JSCZ1601 genome with the genomes of the reference PEDV isolates shown in Table 1 . The comparative analyses showed that the nucleotide identities between JSCZ1601 and the strains identified post-2010 (e.g., Chinese strains JS-HZ2012, GD-A, and AH2012, and American strains PC21A, USA/Minnesota61/2013, and USA/Michigan252/2014) ranged from 98.0-99.0%, while the nucleotide identities with genomes determined ante-2010 (CV777, JS2008, DR13, and attenuated DR13) ranged from 96.6-97.4%. The full-length genome sequence of JSCZ1601 shared the highest levels of nucleotide identity (99.0%) with PEDV strains PEDV-LYG, JS-HZ2012, and YC2014. However, among the ORFs, the S genes had the lowest nucleotide identities 98.2-98.4% with these strains. The amino acid identity between the deduced S proteins of JSCZ1601 and PEDV-LYG was only 97.6%. These data indicate that a high level of variation may have occurred in the S protein of the JSCZ1601 strain. The deduced ORF1b protein of JSCZ1601 shared ≥ 99.3% amino acid identities with all the reference strains except AH2012, which shared only 94.3% identity. The 5′ UTR of JSCZ1601 shared 83.2-98.9% identities with the other PEDV strains. The 3′ UTR of JSCZ1601 showed higher genetic conservation than the 5′ UTR and shared 94. 5 Phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic trees were generated based on the nucleotide sequences of the full-length genomes and each of the seven ORFs (i.e., ORF1a, ORF1b, S, ORF3, E, M, and N) of JSCZ1601 and the other PEDV strains ( Fig. 1a -h, respectively). As shown in Fig. 1a , the phylogenetic tree of the full-length genome indicated that the PEDV strains fell into two groups designated G1 and G2. G1 had two subgroups, 1a and 1b, and consisted of CV777, virulent and attenuated DR13, SM98, and an earlier Chinese strain JS2008. G2 also had two subgroups, 2a and 2b (Fig. 1a) . Notably, all the strains identified from 2011 to 2015 were in G2. The phylogenetic trees of the full-length genome, ORF1a, ORF1b, E, and M showed that JSCZ1601 fell into G2b. However, the S gene of JSCZ1601 formed a sole subgroup that was separate from the other G2 strains (Fig. 1d) . These data indicate that significant variation had occurred in the S gene of JSCZ1601. Moreover, the phylogenetic tree of the S genes revealed that the S-INDEL strains formed a single subgroup in G1. Comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of complete S genes. As shown in Fig. 2 , compared with the S protein sequence of G1 strain CV777, the deduced S protein of JSCZ1601 had two insertions (55TGENV58 and 136 N) and one deletion (157NI158), which is the same as the S proteins of the G2 strains AH2012, GD-A, and PEDV-LYG. Notably, the N-terminal of the JSCZ1601 S protein had an additional two-amino-acid deletion (N58 and S59) compared with the S protein of the representative strain CV777. And this deletion was also existed in JSCZ1601 compared with G2 strains, such as AH2012 and GD-A. Further, the two-amino-acid deletion in the JSCZ1601 S protein eliminated a potential N-glycosylation site that was located at positions 62-64 and 57-59 in the amino acid sequences of the S proteins in AH2012 and CV777, respectively. An additional 16 unique amino acid substitutions were detected in the S protein of JSCZ1601 compared with the S proteins of all the reference strains (Fig. 2 ). In addition, five unique substitutions (500 L/S, 520 H/P, 521 S/G, 590 D/N, and 600 G/V) occurred in one neutralizing epitope (amino acids 499-638) of the JSCZ1601 receptor-binding subunit S1 protein compared with all the reference strains. Moreover, the deduced S proteins of three S-INDEL strains, OH851, USA/IL20697/2014, and US/Iowa106/2013, had the same amino acid deletions and insertion as the G1 strains CV777 and JS2008. Nucleotide sequence comparison of 5′-RNA termini. The 5′ UTR of JSCZ1601 was 293 nt long, which is 3-nt shorter than the 5′ UTR of CV777. As shown in Fig. 3 , 1-nt deletion, 4-nt deletions, and 1-nt insertion were detected in the proximal regions of the 5′ UTRs of the CV777 and LZC strains compared with the other strains. Conversely, the 5′ UTRs were relatively conserved between G2 members. Interestingly, a 'G' insertion was observed in the 5′ terminal of the 5′ UTR of JSCZ1601. And two another nucleotide substitutions, 137 C/T and 225 C/T were existed in the 5′ UTR of JSCZ1601, when compared with the reference strains. Besides, the core sequence (5′ -CUAAAC-3′ ) of the PEDV leader transcription-regulating sequence was well conserved with no nucleotide substitutions detected in any of the PEDV strains. The pathogenesis of JSCZ1601 in newborn piglets. To determine the pathogenicity of JSCZ1601 in newborn piglets, suckling piglets were orally inoculated with the inocula prepared by the intestine tissue sample. While control animals were inoculated with PBS. During the acclimation period, the clinical signs were monitored and piglets in the JSCZ1601 challenge group exhibited lethargy and diarrheic feces by 2 day post-inoculation (DPI) and diarrhea lasted through the study period ( Fig. 4a and b) . The piglets in the negative control group remained active and clinically unaffected throughout the 7-day study period. Due to severity of clinical signs, these piglets were euthanized and necropsied at 7 DPI. The quantitative genomic copies/ml of PEDV RNA in fecal samples rectal was shown in Fig. 4c . The average virus shedding in JSCZ1601 group increased about 10 2.5 to 10 9.5 genomic copies/ml through the study period. Negative control piglets remained active with normal feces and fecal shedding of PEDV remained undetected throughout the study period. Necropsy examinations showed that the virus inoculated piglets displayed typical PED-like lesions. The small intestine was thin-walled and contained soft to watery contents (Fig. 4d) . Small intestine contents obtained at necropsy were also tested by PEDV RT-qPCR and had 10 7.2 to 10 10.1 genomic copies/ml. Histopathological examination showed severe necrosis and villous atrophy of the small intestinal enterocytes in JSCZ1601 inoculated pigs (Fig. 4e) . Villus height and crypt depth were measured, and the mean villous height/crypt depth (VH/CD) ratio of the mock-inoculated piglets (6.5± 0.8) was higher than those of JSCZ1601inoculated piglets (1.3± 0.5).
