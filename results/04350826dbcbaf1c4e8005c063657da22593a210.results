There were 845 pediatric patients enrolled in our study; 506 were included in the first phase and 339 in the second. In the first phase, 81.6% had fever and 46% were 10 years. Among them, 187 patients (37.0%) had positive IRT results and 319 had negative results. In patients with positive results, 126 (62.5%) were boys and the median age was 11 years (range: 1e18 years). In those with negative results, 190 (59.6%) were boys and the median age was 7 years (range: 3 months to 18 years). Several significant factors were identified in patients with positive test results: family with influenza A infection, classmates with influenza A infection, fever with body temperature 38 C, age 5 years, myalgia, lethargy, sore throat, cough, and headache (Table 1 ). Patients younger than 5 years had a lower risk of positive rapid test results. Fever duration longer than 3 days was more common in patients with negative results (3.2% vs. 6.9%) and gastrointestinal tract symptoms were not significantly different in these two groups. Multivariate analysis showed no significant single predictor. A scoring system was designed according to the correlation coefficients to predict the results of IRT and it was simplified for convenient use in the general population ( Table 2 ). The receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted and a score 5 points had an acceptable sensitivity (69.5%) and specificity (63.6%) (Fig. 1 ). In the second phase, 179 patients had positive results and 160 had negative results. In patients with positive results, 83 were boys and the median age was 12 years (range: 8 months to 18 years). In patients with negative results, 115 were boys and the median age was 8 years (range: 4 months to 18 years). We analyzed the questionnaires with our scoring system and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 68.9%, 57.8%, 52.0% and 73.8%, respectively (Table 3 ).
