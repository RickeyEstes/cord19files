By February 1, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was correctly identified in the index COVID-19 patient sample using mNGS and globally accessible bioinformatics. An mNGS library was prepared, multiplexed, and sequenced. Notably, the sample generated 4,773,430 reads with 1,903,800 of those being non-host reads. The resulting non-host fastq files were processed using the IDseq platform which utilizes open-source components. When processed on IDseq pipeline version 3.18 with a February 2020 NCBI index, which included 54 SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited by the international research community, sequences from the index patient aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome ( Figure 1A , 582 reads, at 100% identity to the reference sequence; NCBI accession MN985325.1). Further analysis resulted in 33.2% coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 reference at an average depth of 2.2x ( Figure 1B ). Assembly and alignment on Geneious resulted in 50.5% coverage at 2.6x of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (NCBI accession MN908947.1). Re-sequencing the index case to a total sequencing depth of 8,786,916 single reads resulted in a greater number of SARS-CoV-2 alignments (819 reads) but had no impact on overall coverage -32.3% coverage breadth at an average depth of 2.7x. Using the target enrichment strategy, the overall fold enrichment was 6.4x. In terms of improving genome coverage, particularly at the 5' end of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the resulting 3,077 reads mapping to SARS-CoV-2 assembled into a single contig which provided full coverage of the reference genome at an average depth of 14.9x ( Figure 1C )(NCBI accession MN988668.1). All human SARS-CoV-2 genomes are very similar, including the SARS-CoV-2 genome from the Cambodian case as we would expect given that he transited directly from Wuhan. One SNP was noted at position 25,654 in ORF3a resulting in a valine-to-leucine substitution when compared to NCBI accession MN908947.1.
