In the 38 PED-positive herds, PED was diagnosed in 23 herds in April, in 14 herds in May and in one herd in June. The median PED period was 43.5 days (range, 13 to >90 days). During the PED epidemic, clinical signs were identified in farrowing barns (36 herds, 94.7%), nursery barns (25 herds, 65.8%), finishing barns (23 herds, 60.5%) and pregnant sow barns (29 herds, 76.3%). The means and confidence intervals (CI) for AFI in the PED-negative, S-PED-positive and L-PED-positive herds were 580 (95% CI, 378-782), 464 (95% CI, 234-695) and 1,259 (95% CI, 620-1897), respectively, and the L-PED-positive herds had significantly higher AFI than the PED-negative herds (P<0.05). In the repeated-measure analysis, the time factor and the interaction between time and group were significant for PRWM, POWM, PWL and MP. However, only the time factor was significant for PBA and LMFY. The expression as "time factor was significant" means average values of all 3 groups differ significantly among different time points. For example, the average preweaning mortality was significantly higher in April-June 2014 than at other time points. The mean values of all the parameters differed significantly at different time points, so the time factor was significantly associated with all the variables investigated in this study. The expression as "interaction between time and groups was significant" means some groups (S-PED-positive and L-PED-positive groups) had significantly lower or higher values for these variables at specific time points compared with the other group (PED-negative group). For example, the average preweaning mortality in April-June was significantly lower in the PED-negative group than in the L-PED-positive group, even though it did not differ among the groups at the other sampling times, which can be explained by the interaction between time and group. We observed significant time-group interactions for PRWM, POWM, PWL and MP, in that the values for these parameters were significantly lower in specific groups (S-PED-positive and L-PED-positive) than in the other group (PED-negative) at specific time points. During the PED epidemic, L-PED-positive herds had significantly higher PRWM and POWM than the PED-negative herds, but no significant difference was observed between the S-PED group and the other groups ( Figs. 1 and 2) . The L-PED-positive and S-PED-positive herds had significantly lower PWL than the PED-negative herds during the PED epidemics (Fig. 3) . No significant difference was observed in PBA or LMFY among the groups during the study period (Figs. 4 and 5). During October-December 2014, the L-PED-positive herds had significantly fewer MP than the PED-negative herds, whereas the S-PED-positive herds did not differ significantly from the other groups (Fig. 6) .
