Overall structure of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S trimers. We produced the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S trimers by fusing a T4 fibritin trimerization motif and 6X Histag at the C-terminal end of the ectodomain construct. For the MERS-CoV S protein, we also mutated the S2 cleavage site to enhance the stability. The resulting uncleaved MERS-CoV S ectodomain forms a trimer that can bind to the dimeric CD26 receptor protein, and then precipitate easily ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). We then used thrombin enzyme to remove the C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif and 6X Histag, and found that the MERS-CoV S ectodomain trimer protein can be separated into two peaks in the gel filtration profile ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). One peak is the tag-removed MERS-CoV S ectodomain trimer, and the other is the mixed disassociated S1 and S2 subunits ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The cleaved form of the MERS-CoV S ectodomain was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and further N-terminal sequencing revealed that the S ectodomain protein was cleaved after residue R748 ( Supplementary Fig. 3) , three residues ahead of the S2 cleavage site. This indicated that once the MERS-CoV S ectodomain is cleaved into S1/S2 form, the S1 subunit tends to dissociate from S2. By contrast, the SARS-CoV S protein remains uncleaved after thrombin cleavage, and binds its receptor Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2(ACE2), confirmed by gel filtration survive assay ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . Structures of both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S trimers were studied by single particle cryo-EM. Strikingly, for both trimers we observed two different classes of particles during threedimensional classification, representing two conformations of the trimeric S protein with RBDs in different states (standing or lying) (Fig. 1) . For MERS-CoV S trimer, two classes were found with one or two of the three S1 RBDs in the S trimer in the 'standing' state. The reconstructed maps of these two conformations were refined to 4.1 and 4.2 Å resolutions without symmetry imposed, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Aside from the RBD, the rest of the S1/S2 protein remained the same as in the trimer. To improve the resolution in the rest of the protein, we combined the data from both classes and determined the structure of MERS-CoV S ectodomain trimer with three-fold symmetry imposed at a resolution of 3.7 Å ( Supplementary Fig. 5 , see Methods). We also solved the crystal structure of the RBD-preceding N terminal domain (NTD, residues 18-353) in the S1 subunit at a resolution of 1.5 Å. An atomic model of the cleaved MERS-CoV S1/S2 trimer was built de novo using the 3.7 Å map, except for the flexible regions of S1 CTD and part of S1 NTD, which were fitted by crystal structures. For SARS-CoV S trimer, the structures of the two conformations with none or one of the three S1 RBDs in the 'standing' state were determined to resolutions of 3.2 Å (three-fold symmetry) and 3.7 Å (no symmetry), respectively (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). We also solved the crystal structure of the NTD at a resolution of 2.2 Å. An atomic model of the uncleaved SARS-CoV S trimer was built de novo using the 3.2 Å map, except the flexible RBD and part of the S1 NTD which were from fitted crystal structures. The final model includes residues 18-1,104, with several breaks due to the poor densities. The atomic model was used to interpret the 3.7 Å map after being fitted into the map by domains. The MERS-CoV S ectodomain is a 140 Å long trimer with a triangular cross-section varying in diameter from 50 Å, at the membrane proximal base, to 140 Â 130 Å at the membrane distal head (Fig. 1a) , resembling a blooming flower. By contrast, the SARS-CoV S ectodomain has a smaller membrane distal head with dimensions of 135 Â 120 Å (Fig. 1b) . In the MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV S trimers, compared with the rest of the maps, the RBD region in the standing state features weaker and poorer density and has lower local resolution (Supplementary Figs 7
