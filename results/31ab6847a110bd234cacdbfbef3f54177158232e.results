Mean patient age was 37 years AE8.7. The male to female ratio was approximately 7:1. About one-half of participants were employees (non-medical staff). Saudi nationals represented 48.8% of the study subjects ( Table 1 ). The attack rate for ARI among members of the mission during Hajj season or within two weeks of returning was estimated as 25.6% (64/ 250). Table 2 and Figure 1 , show that 36.1% of Saudi mission members had ARI compared to 15.6% of non-Saudi staff, representing a 3-fold higher risk for Saudi nationals (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.6-5.8). Subjects over 45 years of age were 91% less likely to contract ARI compared to the youngest age group ( 30 years old) (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.4). There was a trend showing the overall risk of developing ARI decreasing with advancing age (x 2 for trend = 11.6, p = 0.001). Furthermore, smokers were found to have 2.5-fold greater risk of developing ARI compared to non-smokers (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.02-6.2). Direct contact with pilgrims during healthcare services carried an extremely high risk of acquiring ARI (OR 12.0, 95% CI 1.6-92.7). No statistically significant association was found between ARI and occupation or vaccination against influenza (either more than two weeks or less than two weeks or not immunized at all). Using facemasks intermittently carried more risk of acquiring ARI than using facemasks all the time (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.0). Medical personnel who never used alcohol for hand disinfection developed ARI five times more often compared to those who practiced regular alcohol hand disinfection (OR 5.1, 95% CI 2.2-11.8). In addition, there was a statistically significant negative trend for alcohol use in hand disinfection. Alcohol use for hand disinfection was found to be protective against ARI comparing those who regularly used alcohol to those who used alcohol intermittently (with nearly double the risk), and to those who never used alcohol (with nearly five times the risk) (x 2 for trend = 19.1, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis of factors related to acquiring ARI revealed that contact with pilgrims imposed a very high risk of infection (adjusted OR 13.2, 95% CI 1.5-117.6) ( Table 3) . Moreover, never using alcohol for hand disinfection carried more than eight times the risk of acquiring ARI compared to those who always used alcohol for hand disinfection (adjusted OR 8.4, 95% CI 2.2-32.3). Unexpectedly, the logistic regression model showed that Saudis were three 270 S. Al-Asmary et al.
