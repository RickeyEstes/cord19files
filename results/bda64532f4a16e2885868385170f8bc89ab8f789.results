It has been previously demonstrated that the estrogen dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cells are highly sensitive to rapamycin (IC 50 -~10 nM). In contrast, the triple negative MDA-MB-231 are insensitive to the drug (IC 50 -5900 nM) [38] due to relatively high level of phosphatidic acid that competes with rapalogues for binding to the FRB domain [9] . Our results also show that while in MCF-7 cells rapamycin induces clonogenic death with an IC 50 of ~50 nM, in the MDA-MB-231 cells concentrations up to 2 ÂµM did not significantly affect cell survival (Table S2 in File S1).
