In preliminary experiments with a swine antiserum with a NT titre of 256 against the TO-163 strain, specific reaction was observed when each well of the Microelisa plates received 10--2.5 pg protein in the virus antigen, as determined by Lawry's method. In the following experiments, 2.5 pg protein was delivered in each well. Serum samples were collected from 78 specific pathogen-free pigs on a farm where no TGE outbreaks were experienced in the past. These serum samples had an average ELISA value of 0.131 with a standard deviation of 0.051. In order to give an ample safety margin, ELISA values of 0.284 (0.131 + 3 X 0.051) or higher were taken as positive. Serial 2-fold dilutions of four swine antisera having NT titres of 16 000, 2048, 256 and 32 were tested by the ELISA. The end point dilutions of these serum samples were 1:25 600, 1:5000, 1:600 and 1:400, respectively, being closely correlated with their NT titres.
