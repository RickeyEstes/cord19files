3.1. HBD 2-conjugated Ag stimulates the Nod2 signaling procedure, which leads to type I IFN production in macrophage-like THP-1 cells MERS-CoV infection inhibits the production of IFN-α/β and the host antiviral immune response . We evaluated the influence of MERS-CoV infection of THP-1 cells on the innate immune response (Fig. 1) . The expression level of the upE gene was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR at 24 h post-infection of THP-1 cells with 10 3 , 10 4 , and 10 5 plaque-forming units (PFU) of MERS-CoV (Fig. 1A) . Importantly, MERS-CoV infection dose-dependently decreased the expression of factors critical in antiviral innate immunity, such as Nod2, IFN-α, and IFN-β ( Fig. 1B-D) . To analyze whether HBD 2 affects immune induction, we determined the expression levels of the IFN-β, Nod2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α genes in THP-1 cells treated with S RBD or S RBD-HBD 2 ( Fig. 2) . S RBD-HBD 2 significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced the expression of IFN-β and Nod2 by 2.18-and 7.35-fold, respectively, compared to S RBD alone-treated THP-1 cells ( Fig. 2A and B) . The expression of TNFα, an NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory cytokine, was increased in S RBD-HBD 2-treated cells compared with that in S RBD alone-treated cells, albeit not significantly so (Fig. 2C) . We next assessed the levels of the Nod2-associated signal transducing mediators, receptor interacting protein-2 (RIP2) and IRF3, in S RBD-or S RBD-HBD 2-treated THP-1 cells (Fig. 3) . As expected, treatment with S RBD-HBD 2 remarkably upregulated the phosphorylation of RIP2 and IRF3 and the Nod2 protein level. In addition, HBD 2-conjugated S RBD reduced IκBα accumulation, degradation of which requires NF-κB activation (Fig. 3C) . Therefore, HBD 2-conjugated Ag treatment induces the production of the type I IFN, IFN-β, and the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, through Nod2-associated RIP2 response by activating the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB. 3.2. HBD 2-conjugated Ag-mediated induction of a type I IFN response was mediated by CCR2 signaling β-Defensin-fused proteins retain their antibacterial and chemotactic activity for C-C chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6)-expressing cells, as do monocytes that do not express CCR6 (Röhrl et al., 2010a) . In addition, the β-defensin-conjugated proteins induced CCR2-specific chemotaxis on CCR2-transfected HEK293 cells, human peripheral blood monocytes, and mouse peritoneal exudate cells in a dose-dependent manner (Röhrl et al., 2010b) . Therefore, we determined whether HBD 2 binds to CCR2 rather than CCR6 (Fig. 4) by immunofluorescence assay in THP-1 cells (Fig. 4A ). CCR2 and S RBD-HBD 2 co-localized, suggesting a direct interaction, but no such co-localization with CCR2 was observed for S RBD alone (data not shown). We next evaluated whether the interaction of HBD 2 with CCR2 mediates intracellular signaling. Interestingly, the significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced IFN-β expression by S RBD-HBD 2 was abrogated by the CCR2 antagonist, RS 102,895 (Fig. 4B) . Moreover, the Nod2 expression and Nod2-associated RIP2 and IRF3 expression enhanced significantly (p < 0.05) by S RBD-HBD 2 was abrogated by the CCR2 antagonist ( Fig. 4C-E) , as was TNF-α, whose expression is dependent on NF-κB activation (Fig. 4F) . Thus, HBD 2 interacts directly with CCR2, which promotes signal transduction, activation of type I IFN, and an inflammatory response.
