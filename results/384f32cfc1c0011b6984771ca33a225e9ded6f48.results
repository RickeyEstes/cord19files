170 children (86 male; 147 white) aged 1-8.6 (3.7 ± 1.6) years, distributed as 60 children in year 1, 56 in year 2, and 54 in year 3 were studied. A total of 956 independent virus assays was done (5.7 ± 2.6 samples/child); 415 (43%) were and 541 (57%) were not +PCR for virus detection. Of the 425 CFLI episodes sampled, 270 (64%) were and 155 (36%) were not +PCR for virus detection (P < .001). Of the 531 non-CFLI periods sampled, 145 (27%) were and 386 (73%) were not +PCR for virus detection (P < .001). Overall, the proportion of +PCR−CFLI was 35% for all +PCR detections (i.e. subclinical infections). Of all +PCR detections for CFLI and non-CFLI periods, rhinovirus/picornavirus was most frequent, followed by mixed viruses, RSV and then influenza, adenovirus, coronavirus and parainfluenza viruses (see Table 1 ). About 85% of RSV, influenza A and adenovirus detections were associated with a CFLI (+PCR+CFLI), but that association for the other viruses was less than 62% for the other viruses. Pairwise comparison of that frequency between rhinovirus and each assayed virus was significant for RSV (P = .015) and approached significance for influenza A (P = .067).
