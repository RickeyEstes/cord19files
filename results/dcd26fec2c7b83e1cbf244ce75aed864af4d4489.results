Initially, we estimated the effect of CCL2 G-2518A on susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection in Beijing community population consisted of 352 patients with SARS and 392 controls. The observed genotype frequencies for this polymorphism conformed to the HWE in both patients and controls (P > .05). On the basis of logistic regression analysis with adjustment for age and sex, the subjects carrying the GG genotype had a significantly increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection, compared with ones carrying the À2518A allele (i.e., AG plus AA genotype) (OR 1.41, 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.92, P Z .031; Table 1 ). To test for replication of the association, we then genotyped the G-2518A in three additional caseecontrol sample sets. The genotype distributions of all groups did not deviate from the HWE. Again, there was an excess of GG genotype in patients than in controls in Beijing HCW (P Z .025), Tianjin (P Z .038) and Hong Kong population (P Z .010), respectively. Meta-analysis on pooled data from all the four Chinese populations provided unequivocal evidence for a relationship between CCL2 G-2518A and susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 1 ). OR associated with GG genotype was 1.58 (95% CI, 1.28 to 1.96, P Z 2.3 Â 10 À5 , P heterogeneity Z .43, I 2 Z 0%; Fig. 1a ). Given there was no significant heterogeneity for the four Chinese populations, we further analyzed the pooled data by logistic regression, and a strong support for an association between the G-2518A and susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection was observed (P Z 1.6 Â 10 À4 ), with the OR being 1.48 (95% CI, 1.21e1.82) for the at-risk GG genotype, compared with the AG plus AA genotype. On the basis of the ORs combined with the frequencies of GG genotype, PAFs were estimated to account for 12.8e53.1% of SARS cases in the 4 individual populations, and 14.6% in the overall population (Table 1) . We also reassessed the association between SARS and the codon 54 variant (A/B) in MBL, which were previously reported to be associated with SARS in both Beijing community and Hong Kong population (Table 1 ). 3, 9 Again, we replicated that the subjects bearing the variant B allele (BB plus AB genotype), which is associated with low serum MBL, 30 have a significantly increased risk of SARS-CoV infection in both Beijing HCW (P Z .019) and Tianjin population (P Z .012), compared with those homozygous for the wild-type A allele. Combined analysis of the 4 caseecontrol populations by meta-analysis yielded a stronger support for the association (OR 1.82, 95% CI, 1.47 to 2.25, P Z 5.3 Â 10 À8 , P heterogeneity Z .50, I 2 Z 0%; Fig. 1b ). Logistic regression gave a similar result (OR 1.79, 95% CI, 1.45 to 2.21, P Z 4.9 Â 10 À8 ; Table 1 ). The PAFs were 18.8e53.3% for the 4 individual populations, and the pooled PAF was 21.9% for the overall population (Table 1) . We further evaluated whether the effects for the CCL2 G-2518A and MBL codon 54 variant (A/B) on risk of SARS- Fig. 1c) . The joint PAFs for the combination of at-risk genotypes of CCL2 and MBL were 29.1e41.0% in the 4 individual populations, and the joint PAF was 28.5% in the pooled population (Table 2) . We next calculated statistics for AUC to estimate the ability of each of three models to distinguish case subjects from control subjects. In the four individual populations, the AUC was 53.2e61.0 for model 1 (sex, age, and the number of at-risk genotypes at CCL2), 53.9 to 63.6 for model 2 (sex, age, and the number of at-risk genotypes at MBL), and 55.7 to 65.8 for model 3 (sex, age, region, and the number of at-risk genotypes at both CCL2 and MBL) with all P values equal or less than .10 ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). In the pooled population, the AUC was 53.7 (95% CI, 51.1 to 56.3; P Z 4.8 Â 10 À3 ) for model 1, 55.5 (95% CI, 52.9 to 58.1; P Z 2.9 Â 10 À5 ) for model 2, and 57.0 (95% CI, 54.5 to 59.6; P Z 1.0 Â 10 À7 ) for model 3 ( Supplementary Fig. 1) . We also assessed whether there was an association between the CCL2 G-2518A and MBL codon 54 variant (A/ B) and severity of SARS, but found that the two SNPs were associated with the severity of SARS neither individually nor jointly (Supplementary Table 3 ).
