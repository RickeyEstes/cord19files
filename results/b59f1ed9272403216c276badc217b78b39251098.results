SeV copy-back DVGs trigger a robust and sustained activation of IRF3 and NF-kB independent of type I IFN feedback To further investigate the cellular mechanisms responsible for the efficient activation of the antiviral response by SeV DVGs, we evaluated the phosphorylation of transcription factors that are critical for the expression of type I IFNs in cells infected with equivalent amounts of infectious particles of a SeV strain Cantell stock containing high levels of copy-back DVGs (SeV Cantell HD) or with SeV Cantell depleted of DVGs (SeV Cantell LD). Virus stocks were prepared from the same parental virus and their content of DVGs was determined by calculating the ratio of infectious particles to total particles (ratios are specified in the material and methods section). In addition, copy-back DVGs of these stocks were identified by PCR. One predominant copy-back genome was present in cells infected with SeV Cantell HD (amplicon of 278 bp), while no copy-back defective genome was detected in cells infected with SeV Cantell LD up to six hours after infection (Figs. 1A and S1). Cloning and sequencing of the 278 nt long amplicon confirmed that it corresponded to a previously described SeV Cantell copy-back DVG of 546 nt in length (DVG-546) [28] . Phosphorylation of IRF3 and of the NF-kB repressor IkBa in response to SeV Cantell HD occurred rapidly and was sustained even in type I IFN receptor KO cells (Ifnar1 2/2 ) ( Fig. 1B and C), while no phosphorylation of IRF3 or IkBa was observed for up to ten hours post-infection with SeV Cantell LD despite equivalent or higher expression of the viral protein Np (Fig. 1D) . Corresponding with the strong activation of transcription factors, Ifnb mRNA was expressed in Ifnar1 2/2 cells infected with SeV Cantell HD (Fig. 1E ). In contrast, type I IFN signaling was required for the cellular response to Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian virus that only partially inhibits the type I IFN pathway, triggering the expression of type I IFN and other cytokines in the absence of DVGs. To further validate the role of SeV copy-back DVGs as triggers of type I IFN-independent antiviral responses, we cloned DVG-546 under the control of the T7 polymerase promoter and used this construct to prepare a SeV stock containing a single recombinant DVG (rDVG). For this purpose we used SeV strain 52 that normally does not produce highly immunostimulatory copy-back DVGs [24] . Equivalent infectious units of SeV 52 and SeV 52 plus rDVGs had similar levels of total RNA (Fig. 1F ) but infection with virus containing rDVGs strongly induced the antiviral response while virus that lacked DVGs did not (Fig. 1G) confirming the DVG immunostimulatory activity. In addition, presence of rDVGs significantly reduced the expression of SeV Np mRNA, demonstrating their strong interfering capacity (Fig. 1G) . Notably, mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking the type I IFN receptor expressed Ifnb mRNA in response to SeV 52 containing rDVG (Fig. 1H ) and virus containing rDVGs triggered IRF3 phosphorylation independently of type I IFN feedback (Fig. 1I) , mirroring the response to SeV Cantell HD. Altogether, this evidence conclusively shows that SeV copy-back DVGs confer potent immunostimulatory ability to SeV stocks, independent of type I IFN feedback. Notably, potent Ifnb mRNA expression in response to SeV DVGs was independent of IRF1, IRF5, and IRF8 while only partially dependent on IRF7 (Fig. S2 ). This response was maintained in a variety of cell types (Fig. S3) . DVGs accumulate at a high rate in infected cells and are a primary source of pathogen associated molecular patterns that trigger RLR signaling To determine whether standard viral genomes and DVG RNAs have distinct intrinsic properties that explain their differential immunostimulatory activities, we compared naked RNA purified from a stock of SeV Cantell LD with in vitro transcribed DVG-546. RNAs were transfected into cells before or after treatment with phosphatase or with RNase A that cleaves 39 of single stranded C and U residues, and/or RNase V1 that cleaves base paired nucleotides. Both genomic RNA and DVG RNA were susceptible to treatment with phosphatase, as well as to treatment with RNases ( Fig. 2A) , corresponding with the literature that demonstrates a crucial role for 59-triphosphate-RNA in the induction of type I IFNs. While transfected DVGs induced stronger expression of Ifnb than an equivalent concentration of gSeV ( Fig. 2A) , transfection of equivalent molar amounts of genomic and DVG RNA resulted in higher immunostimulatory activity of genomic RNA compared to DVG RNA (Fig. 2B) , demonstrating that SeV LD RNA can strongly trigger the host response to infection when delivered naked into the cells. Paradoxically, cells infected with SeV Cantell LD alone failed to induce strong type I IFN production even when used at a 10 times higher infectious dose than SeV Cantell HD (Fig. 2C) . Although the amount of gSeV RNA was significantly higher in cells infected with an moi of 15 of SeV Cantell LD compared with ten times less SeV Cantell HD at 6 h post-infection (Fig. 2C) , DVGs were only detected in cells infected with SeV Cantell HD, confirming a strong correlation between the presence of DVGs in the infected cells and the induction of the host response to infection. To determine whether the amount of total input viral RNA affected the immunostimulatory activity of SeV Cantell LD and HD, we measured the RNA content in equivalent infectious doses of these stocks. SeV Cantell HD had less than two fold higher the amount of total RNA than SeV Cantell LD and total RNA levels were equivalent between SeV Cantell LD and HD when LD was at twice the infectious dose (Fig. 2D) . Thus, differences in the net input amount of viral RNA cannot explain the more than .1000 fold difference in the expression of Ifnb mRNA between cells infected with equivalent infectious doses of SeV Cantell LD and HD. DVGs have an increased rate of replication compared to standard viral genomes due to their shorter size and promoter properties [29] . To determine whether DVGs replicate faster than gSeV, we calculated the rate of replication of gSeV and DVGs in cells infected with SeV Cantell HD. Although at an early time point more copies of gSeV than DVGs were detected in the cells, DVGs dominated by 12 h post-infection (Fig. 2E ) accumulating at a 4 times faster rate than gSeV (Fig. 2F) . These data demonstrate that DVGs rapidly surpass the number of gSeV in infected cells, providing large quantities of pathogen associated molecular patterns.
