There were 2537 patients, 1242 females and 1295 males, involved in the present study, and their demographic characteristics were listed in Table 1 . Thirty-eight percent fewer patients visited the dental emergency center at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic compared with one month ago (970 vs. 1570). The age of the patients was between 2 years and 92 years with the mean of (38.9 AE 19.3) years. There was no significant difference between the minors' proportion of the two periods (P Z 0.077). There were more female patients than male patients pre-COVID-19. However, the situation was reversed during the COVID-19 epidemic (P < 0.001). The dental pulpal or periapical lesions (44.7%) were the main reason for emergency visits, followed by cellulitis or abscess (14.2%), trauma (12.8%), and other problems. Although the total and per type patients' number declined when the fears of COVID-19 grew after the expansion of the epidemic, the distribution of dental problems has changed significantly (Fig. 1) . The proportion of dental and oral infection raised from 51.0% of pre-COVID-19 to 71.9% during COVID-19 and dental trauma decreased from 14.2% to 10.5%. Meanwhile, the non-urgency cases reduced to threetenths of pre-COVID-19. There was a significant difference between the test and control periods (P < 0.001).
