Cross-species transmission for each viral particle is assumed to be a function of the phenotypic plasticity of the viral genome and the genetic variability produced during replication [13, 15, 19] . The probability of a transmission event occurring can be represented as: where λ ∈ [0, ∞) is the weighted contribution of plasticity over variability in promoting crossspecies transmission and L is the length of the viral genome. Although a relationship between genome size and phenotypic plasticity is probable, little work has enlightened the nature of this relationship. What is clear is that transcription and gene regulation networks can become more complex with increasing number of nucleotides [20, 21] . Variability produced with each replication event can be more accurately approximated. Variability is produced via mutation and recombination (reassortment, non-homologous and homologous). Given per nucleotide rates of mutation (µ) and recombination (R), the accumulation of variability per genome should increase linearly as (µ + R(1 − µ))L. When µ and R are small, this variability can be expressed as (µ + R)L. Lethal mutagenesis and incompatible recombinants reduce viability of viral products. Viability converges to e −µγL across mutational models [18] and is calculated as ρ for recombination [17] (see supplement), where γ is the proportion of lethal mutations, ρ is the genome-specific tolerance to recombination events, and D ∈ [0, 1] is the sequence divergence between co-infecting viruses. Per nucleotide variability (dV /dN ) produced with each replication event can be given as: Per genome variability (dV /dG) can be given as: Assuming the number of polymerase enzymes scales with genome size [22, 23] , a rate of production of variability can be derived. The efficiency of replication of each genome can be represented as L/(I + L), where I is the product of the time required for replication initiation and termination, and r, the rate of polymerase-mediated replication. Figure 1 displays equations 2-4 parameterized to represent positive sense ssRNA viruses. Per nucleotide variability production decreases with genome size due to reduced fitness with accumulated substitutions (Fig. 1A ). However, genome-level variability production increases almost linearly with genome size, revealing that the rate of fitness reduction from the accumulation of deleterious substitutions does not outpace the increased variability associated with increase in genome size (Fig. 1B) . Because more genomes can be replicated in a fixed amount of time for smaller genomes, the total variability produced in unit time gives indication of whether population-level variability increases with genome size. In fact, Fig. 1C shows that population-level variability is maximized within the known size range of ssRNA(+) viral genomes. Variability production per unit time continues to decline for genome sizes larger than 50,000 nt, though no known ssRNA viruses have genomes larger than 35,000 nt [12] . The maximum variability production per unit time is dependent on the efficiency of replication. Because Coronaviruses have much larger genomes than other ssRNA(+) viruses, they have evolved 3 − → 5 exoribonuclease repair and have lower mutation rates than other ssRNA(+) viruses [24] . Substituting this mutation rate in equation 4 produces a curve ( Fig. S2 ) with a maximum shifted to the right, reflecting that production of genetic variability is 5 .

Considering these theoretical results, variability is greater per virion produced for viruses with larger genomes. Because population-level production of variability has been shown to improve viral survival via immune evasion [14] , there is likely strong selection toward viral genome sizes close to the peak described by equation 4 (Fig. 1C) . Even in the absence of phenotypic plasticity conferred by large genomes, viruses with large genomes have high potential to generate variability that promotes cross-species transmission events. Zoonotic viruses should, therefore, possess larger genomes than other viruses. To examine the relationship between viral genome size and likelihood of zoonosis, this study compiles a comprehensive list of all known viral zoonoses and leverages the entire NCBI database of viral genomes [12]. Peer-reviewed literature from 1920 to 2019 was searched via the Web of Science electronic library for viral zoonoses. Search key words included "zoonotic", "zoonoses", "emerging disease", "viral spillover", "animal to human transmission", and "animal reservoir virus". After cross examination of all viruses yielded through this search, all confirmed zoonotic viruses transmitted from animals to humans in the past 100 years that also had a complete genome sequence were included in the analysis. This set encompasses 126 viral species from 40 genera in groups 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the Baltimore classification system, grouped by genome structure. Genome sizes for all viruses were retrieved from the NCBI genome database or from peer-reviewed reports of fully sequenced genomes. The entire NCBI viral genome database of 9238 sequenced genomes was downloaded and filtered to remove incomplete, prokaryote, fungus, protist, and plant associated viral sequences. 2088 animal associated virus species in the five evaluated Baltimore groups remained after removal of zoonotic virus sequences. All species were categorized by genome structure according to the Baltimore classification system. One-tailed Welch's T-tests for sample means were performed for each Baltimore group, comparing the genome sizes of zoonotic viruses with all other non-zoonotic viruses. Table 1
