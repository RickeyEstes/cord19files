Derivation and Characterization of L-CA-Deficient T Cell Clones Mutational analysis has been a powerful tool in deciphering protein functions. We directed these methods toward the understanding of the function of L-CA. We chose to mutate mouse T cell clones because they maintain normal physiology and do not display a transformed phenotype. T cell clones were mutated with N-methyl-N'-nitro-Nnitrosoguanidine, and L-CA-cells were selected by treating with antibody directed against a common L-CA determinant and rabbit complement. In one experiment, one (6) Analysis of clonally isolated populations of cells. A.E7-M2-2, -3, and -11 were isolated from negatively sorted cells, and A.E7-M2-1P was isolated from positively sorted cells. A.E7-M2-D3 was cloned directly from A.E7-M2 population. Cells were stained with anti-L-CA W2.3 and a fluoresceinated second antibody. Each line was stained with secondary antibody alone as a negative control. The negative control for A.E7-M2-2 is shown. Cells were analyzed on a Secton-Dickinson FACS 440. culture of a T cell clone, A.E7 (I-Ek restricted and specific for pigeon cytochrome c), contained a cluster of cells that appeared to be abnormal in morphology and growth. This culture, termed A.E7-M2, was expanded and examined by flow cytometry ( Figure 1A ). It is apparent that approximately half of the population of cells failed to react with anti-L-CA antibody W2.3. Individual T cells were isolated and expanded either by limiting dilution cloning directly from the A.E7-M2 line or by cloning after positive and negative selection by cell sorting. The clones isolated by positive cell sorting, for example, A.E7-M2-1P (Figure lB), appeared to be identical to the parent line by morphology, growth parameters, and cell surface molecules (data not shown). Six L-CA-clones were isolated by cloning directly from the A.E7-M2 line and 11 clones were isolated by cloning after negative selection. One clone from the di-rect cloning, A.E7-M2-D3, and three clones from the negatively sorted cloning, A.E7-M2-2, -3, and -11, were examined further. As shown in Figure 16 , these cells were completely negative for L-CA as determined by flow cytometry using the antibody 13/2.3. Identical results were obtained with either 3OFll.l or MV9.3.4HL.2 monoclonal antibodies, which also recognize common epitopes on L-CA. Also, the anti-allotypic antibody 104-2, which recognizes the Ly-5.2 determinant, failed to stain (data not shown). This indicates that the lack of L-CA detection was not merely due to the loss of the antigenic epitope. To confirm the flow cytometry data, immunoprecipitation of surface-labeled cells was performed. Although analysis of the immunoprecipitate by SDS-PAGE showed no detectable surface-labeled L-CA from the L-CAclones, a single band at approximately 180,000 M, is im- bodies used were: anti-L-CA (1312.3) (lanes l-4); anti Pgpl (IM7.8.1) (lanes 5-8); and total 200cell lysates (lanes 9-12). The ceils were: A.E7 (lanes 1, 5, and 9); A.E7-M2-2 (lanes 2, 6, and 10); A.E7-M2-3 (lanes 3, 7, and 11); and A.E7- M2-11 (lanes 4,8, and 12) . The arrow marks the position of the high molecular weight protein seen in lane 9 and not found in lanes W-12. Lanes l-8 were exposed overnight; lanes 9-12 were exposed for 7 days. (lane 4). The arrow denotes the position of the higher molecular weight band found in the AE7 parent but not the mutant cell lines. The gel was exposed for 7 days. (B) Northern blot analysis. Totat RNA was prepared and 5 trg was electrophoresed per lane. The gel was blotted onto Zetaprobe (BioFtad) and hybridized with a fulllength L-CA cDNA (Thomas et al., 1987) . The The filter was exposed overnight. normal size mRNA were found in the parent and L-CAcells ( Figure 36 ). SDS-PAGE of immunoprecipitated L-CA from parent A.E7 cells, labeled overnight with [%]methionine, revealed two molecular weight species of 180,000 and 180,000 M,. However, each of the L-CA-mutant clones contained only the 180,000 M, form, albeit in lesser amounts. These data indicate that neither the transcription nor the translation of L-CA is impaired, but the defect is in the maturation and surface expression of the glycoprotein. Thy-l, Fgp-1, and CD4 were examined by flow cytometry (Figure 4 ). Unlike surface L-CA, there was no detectable difference in the expression of these glycoproteins between the A.E7 parent and the L-CA-T cell clones. The combined immunoprecipitation and flow cytometry data strongly suggest that the defect in the L-CA-clones is specific to the L-CA glycoprotein. Analysis of the Proliferative Capacity of L-CA T Cell Clones To determine whether or not the defect was specific for The L-CA-clones were visibly different from the parent L-CA, the expression of the cell surface molecules LFA-1, line (data not shown). While a few scattered cells were IL-2 CONCENTRATlON [U/ml] similar in shape to the parent line, most cells were larger and spherical. In contrast, the parent line contained between 20%~50% cells with amoeboid morphology. The L-CA-clone cultures also contained more cellular debris and a higher frequency of dead cells. This is reflected in total cell growth. Table 1 displays the number of cells obtained at the end of a series of biweekly passages. Consistently, the mutant cell lines gave approximately 4-fold fewer cells. To examine the growth parameters between the parent and mutant cells, we compared the proliferative response to antigen and IL-2 ( Figure 5 ). As expected, both the parent and the L-CA-clones failed to respond when only the spleen filler cells were present ( Figure 5A ). Remarkably, when the specific antigen pigeon cytochrome c was added to the cultures, all the L-CA-clones failed to respond appropriately (Figure 58 ). This was not merely a result of a shift in the antigen dose response of the mutants ( Figure 6A ). The L-CA-clones failed to respond even to doses as high as 1 mg/ml. In comparison, both the parent and the L-CA-clones proliferate in response to 11-2, although the response is weaker for the L-CA-clones (Fig- ure 5C). In five separate experiments, the response of the L-CA-clones to antigen was on average 9% of the response of the parent, while the response to IL-2 was 77%. The IL-2 source for the experiments shown in Figure 5 was from phorbol-stimulated EL-4 cells, however, similar results were obtained if recombinant IL-2 was used ( Figure  6B ). In a dose response assay, the L-CA-clones did respond to 11-2, but the response was not as great as that of the AE7 parent. Examination of the ~55 chain of the IL-2 receptor by flow cytometry indicated that the mutant not only expressed this component but that the L-CA-clone increased the surface expression to a greater degree than that of the parent after stimulation with antigen and IL-2 (Table 2 ). This indicates that the diminished growth was not due to the lack of the IL-2 receptor in the L-CAclones. When antigen and IL-2 were added simultans ously to the cultures, the proliferative response of the parent and the mutant clones was always less than when only IL-2 was present ( Figure 5D ). Since the L-CA-clones fail to respond to antigen, our ability to grow these cells in vitro is presumably a result of the addition of an exoge nous IL-2 source. a Fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry using a Becton-Dickinson FACS 440. Fluorescent intensity was measured on a four-log scale and was divided into 255 channels. b Cells were stimulated with antigen and IL-2 on day 1. For each experiment, IL-2 receptor was measured on the last day prior to stimulation (day 15 and day 13 of the previous stimulation for experiments 1 and 2. respectively) and then either day 6 or day 5 poststimulation. To determine whether the L-CA-cells expressed the afi T cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a recently described monoclonal antibody to a framework determinant on the a8 T cell receptor (Figure 7 ) (Kubo et al., 1989) . There was no detectable difference between the parent and mutant cells, indicating that lack of proliferation to antigen was not due to the failure to express the a8 T cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex. Since the L-CA-clones expressed CD3, it was of interest to determine whether or not they would proliferate in response to an anti-CD3 antibody. As shown in Figure  8 , while the parent responded to doses as low as 20 nglml, the A&'-M2-2 clone failed to respond to any dose. We interpret these data to mean that signaling through the antigen receptor-CD3 complexes is impaired in the L-CAclones.
