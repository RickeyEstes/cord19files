Data were collected 1.3 (0.8), mean (SD), days post admission. Respiratory virus infection was present in 63 (70%) subjects, with a negative respiratory virus result in 27 (30%) subjects. The viruses detected were: rhinovirus (n = 52, 83%), enterovirus (n = 18, 29%), RSV (n = 1, 2%), Influenza A (n = 5, 8%) and Influenza B (n = 2, 3%). In 14 subjects dual viruses were detected and in one subject three different viruses were detected. Table 2 describes the subject characteristics for the virus positive and virus negative groups. There was no difference in the proportion of subjects with atopy, smoking status or gender between the groups. Those with a positive virus result had a lower percent predicted FEV 1 , were younger than the virus negative group and had a similar asthma control score (Table 2) .
