We captured and collected tissues from 175 coyotes (91 males, 84 females) in 15 townships (statistical mean 11 coyotes/township, SE = 0.63) within DMU 452 and 14 control coyotes (8 males, 6 females) from Michigan's Upper Peninsula. For coyotes sampled from DMU 452, we were able to classify 101 (51 males, 50 females) as juveniles (<2 years old) and 67 (34 males, 33 females) as adults. Age data were not collected from control coyotes. We identifi ed 58 M. bovis-positive coyotes from DMU 452; 16 (28%) positive coyotes were trapped within the boundaries of property owned by 7 private hunt clubs distributed throughout DMU 452. Seven coyotes (5 males, 2 females) whose age could not be determined were negative for M. bovis. All control coyotes were negative for M. bovis, and they were not included in subsequent analyses or summary statistics. Unweaned pups were not sampled. Apparent prevalence of M. bovis infection did not differ by age (Ï‡ 2 = 3. 16 M. bovis (n = 58) was the most common mycobacterium isolated, but M. avium complex species (n = 12), M. intracellulare (n = 1), and M. kansasii (n = 1) were also identifi ed by culture. M. bovis was the most common mycobacterial isolate found within the mesenteric lymph nodes. In 31 positive cases in which anatomic location of lymph nodes was identifi ed, 14 animals were positive only in mesenteric lymph nodes, 14 were positive in both mesenteric and combined head and thoracic lymph nodes, and 3 animals were positive only in combined head and thoracic lymph nodes. No coyotes were detected concurrently infected with multiple Mycobacterium types. Lymph node lesions caused by M. bovis varied from focal to multifocal and ranged in size from 1 to 15 mm. Frequently, an affected lymph node contained several 1-to 5-mm granulomas. A single animal was found with multiple, large, 1-to 1.5-cm granulomas within the liver, lungs, pleura, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Microscopically, both lesions and the number of acid-fast bacilli within lesions were variable. Most lesions contained occasional acid-fast bacilli with fewer lesions containing numerous acid-fast bacilli. The most common microscopic lesion was a granu-loma in the cortex of lymph nodes with large central areas of acellular, eosinophilic debris, with or without basophilic mineralized debris, and numerous cholesterol clefts. Necrotic debris was surrounded by a thin rim of macrophages, epithelioid macrophages, fi brous connective tissue, lymphocytes, only a few neutrophils, and plasma cells. Multinucleated giant cells were infrequent or absent (Figure 3 ). Less commonly, in some granulomas the central area of necrotic debris was almost entirely mineralized. A second type of lesion found in the cortex of the lymph nodes consisted only of small, poorly delineated aggregates of macrophages and epithelioid macrophages intermixed with low numbers of lymphocytes. In some animals, these small aggregates of macrophages were the only lesions identifi ed ( Figure 4 ).
