By continuously subculturing, a primary cell culture of bovine caruncular epithelial cells the removal of contaminating fibroblastoid cells was possible within the first four passages, and resulted in a population of cells displaying epithelioid morphology only. During the first 8 passages the cells reached confluence after 11 days (AE2). The following three passages were characterised by a low viability of the cells (Fig. 1) and confluence was hardly reached. By day 14 in culture no further proliferation was observed. Subculturing at this time point stimulated cell proliferation and from passage 12 onwards the proliferation rate accelerated markedly resulting in confluence within 7 days (AE1) in culture and remained constant for the subsequent 18 passages. From passage 30 onwards the proliferation rate decreased and because the amount of cryopreserved cultures was deemed sufficient, it was decided to stop further subculturing after the 32nd passage. During the process of subculturing cultures of various passages were successfully cryopreserved for later experiments. The cell line was termed BCEC-1 (Bovine Caruncular Epithelial Cell line 1). Characterisation of BCEC-1 cells at various time points during subculturing revealed the presence of cytokeratin, zonula occludens-1 and vimentin while the cells remained negative for both a-smooth muscle actin and desmin (Fig. 2) . This result was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 ). In addition, TEM and SEM analysis confirmed the presence of epithelium specific characteristics as they show a polarised morphology, the presence of apical microvilli and junctional complexes (zonula occludens, zonula adherens and desmosomes) as well as the growth pattern as a homogenous monolayer of cells (Fig. 4) . All BCEC-1 cultures used for TEER experiments displayed marked increases in TEER values with progressing confluence independent of culture conditions in comparison to confluent fibroblasts which never developed TEER > 200 U/cm 2 . Culturing cells on coated membranes resulted in an earlier attainment of confluence and subsequent earlier increase of TEER values (Fig. 5) . All cultures tested negative for the BVD virus (Fig. 6) . After 48 h of incubation with non-cytopathogenic BVD virus, virus protein could be detected in the cytoplasm of the BCEC-1 cells. Corresponding to the controls (MDBK cells) no cytopathogenic effect was observed.
