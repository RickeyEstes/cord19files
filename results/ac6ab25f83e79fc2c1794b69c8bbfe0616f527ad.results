Vaccine efficacy in immunized horses was assessed against the clinical, virologic, and pathologic features of HeV infection in 4 unvaccinated control horses. Infection characteristics for 3 of these unvaccinated animals have been described (6) ; data from the fourth control animal was gathered as part of the current work. In that fourth control, onset of fever accompanied by a rising heart rate was noted on postchallenge day 6. On postchallenge day 7, the horse became clinically depressed, its temperature and heart rate continued to rise, and it was euthanized. Gross postmortem findings included pleural thickening and moderate dilation of the lymphatic vessels on the ventral 10 cm of the cardiac lung lobes. Histologic examination revealed systemic vasculitis affecting the lung (Figure 1, panel A) , spleen, kidney, nasal epithelium, lymph nodes, and brain; alveolitis; and lymphadenitis. HeV antigen was identified in endothelial cells and vascular walls within lung, brain ( Figure 1, panel B) , nasal epithelium, lymph nodes, spleen, kidney, liver, myocardium, salivary gland, pharynx, small intestine, uterus, ovary, and adrenal gland, as well as in myocardial fibers and glomeruli. Viral RNA from this fourth control horse was detected in nasal swabs collected on postchallenge day 3 ( Table 2 ; summarized in Table 3 ) and also in blood collected immediately before the onset of fever. After onset of fever, but before development of other clinical signs of illness, HeV RNA was also detected in the oral swab sample. On the day of euthanasia, genome was detected in oral and nasal swab samples, blood, rectal swab, and urine samples; however, virus was not reisolated from any sample collected before postmortem examination. Viral RNA was detected in all tissues sampled at postmortem examination except cerebrospinal fluid. Reisolation of virus was attempted for all tissues: HeV was recovered from lung, submandibular lymph node, small intestine, large intestine, and adrenal gland. In a series of vaccine efficacy studies, 10 horses were immunized with HeVsG glycoprotein and then exposed to an otherwise lethal dose of HeV by the oronasal route. Each study also included a pathogenicity control for the virus inoculum. In the first of these, the pathogenicity control was the fourth control horse described above. Together with historical data gathered from 3 horses following their exposure to HeV under equivalent experimental conditions (5), data from this horse completed the requirements of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for defining the horse infection model. In subsequent studies, guinea pigs or ferrets were used as pathogenicity controls to maximize the number of vaccinated horses that could be accommodated in the BSL-4 facility. These animals duly displayed signs, lesions, tissue antigen and viral genome distribution, and virus reisolation data consistent with acute HeV infection. In contrast to unvaccinated control horses, vaccinated horses remained clinically healthy during the observation period after exposure to HeV. Following elective euthanasia at the time of predicted peak viral replication, there was no gross or histologic evidence of HeV infection in vaccinated horses; all tissues examined were negative for viral antigen by immunohistochemistry; and viral genome was not recovered from any tissue, including nasal turbinates, pharynx, and guttural pouch (Table 3 ). For 9 of 10 vaccinated horses, viral RNA was not detected in daily nasal, oral, or rectal swab specimens or from blood, urine, or feces samples collected before euthanasia, and virus was not reisolated from any of these clinical samples. For 1 (V9) of 3 horses exposed to HeV 6 months after completing the vaccination course, low viral gene copy numbers were detected in nasal swab samples collected on postchallenge days 2-4 and 7 ( Figure 2 ); this finding was consistent with self-limiting local replication. Virus was not reisolated from these samples. Serum neutralization titers before HeV challenge ranged from 128/256 to >4,096 for horses V1-V7 when challenged 21 days after the second vaccination and from 16 to 32 for horses V8-V10 when challenged 6 months after the second vaccination (Table 3 ). At the time of euthanasia, no rise in antibody titer was detected in any vaccinated horse following exposure to HeV.
