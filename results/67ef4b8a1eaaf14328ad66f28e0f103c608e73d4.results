Human MDMs Isolated from the LP Group Display Enhanced Expression of CD11b, TLR2 and TLR4, Compared to HPs Since neurological symptoms are often exacerbated by infection [26] , we initially assessed plasma levels of the inflammatory reactant CRP in plasma from HP and LP groups. No significant difference in plasma CRP concentration was found between groups ( Figure 1A ). PBMCs predominantly constitute lymphocytes and monocytes, with lower numbers of natural killer (NK) and dendritic cells. CD11b is an adhesion molecule primarily expressed on the surface of monocytes, but also on activated lymphocytes and a subset of NK cells, where it mediates leukocyte adhesion and migration to orchestrate an inflammatory response [27] . Indeed, CD11b expression is upregulated by many inflammatory mediators including cytokines [28] . CD11b expression was unchanged on PBMCs isolated from the HP and LP groups ( Figure 1B , C, P = 0.45) and no difference in MDM CD14 mRNA was observed between groups ( Figure 1D ) suggesting that differentiation of monocytes to macrophages was similar in LP and HP individuals. However, the percentage of CD11b + cells in the MDM preparation was significantly greater in the LP group, compared with the HP group ( Figure 1E , F, P,0.05) and the CD11b staining intensity was also higher on MDMs from the LP group, compared with the HP group ( Figure 1G , P,0.05). Although CD11b mRNA was also enhanced in MDMs from the LP, compared with the HP, group the difference did not reach statistical significance ( Figure 1H , P = 0.19). Since macrophages and other cells of the innate immune system recognise distinct microbial products via TLRs, we next assessed the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 since they are specifically implicated in inflammatory changes associated with neurodegeneration [14, 29] . TLR2 expression on CD11b + cells was similar on PBMCs isolated from the HP and LP groups ( Figure 1I , J) but expression in MDMs from the LP group was higher than the HP group, although it did not reach statistical significance ( Figure 1K , L, P = 0.056); MFI values for the HP and LP groups were 88.1 and 77.2 respectively. TLR2 mRNA was significantly greater in MDMs prepared from the LP group compared with the HP group (P,0.05; Figure 1M ). TLR4 expression on CD11b + cells was similar on PBMCs isolated from the HP and LP groups ( Figure 1N , O) but expression on MDMs from the LP group was significantly greater than from the HP group (P,0.05; Figure 1P , Q); MFI values for the HP and LP groups were 37.1 and 28.3 respectively. TLR4 mRNA was significantly greater in MDMs prepared from the LP group compared with the HP group (P,0.05; Figure 1R ). Overall, this indicates that differentiated MDMs, but not freshly prepared PBMCs, isolated from the LP cohort display elevated expression of CD11b and TLR2/4.
