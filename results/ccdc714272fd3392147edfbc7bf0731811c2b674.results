The investigation revealed that during this period a total of 46 passengers were symptomatic during transit on board aircraft, meaning that at least 2 and at most 9 passengers per day were found to be symptomatic during their flight. Since the flying time from Hong Kong to Kaohsiung is only 45 to 60 minutes, it is reasonable to suspect that symptomatic passengers were actually aware of their symptoms before boarding the aircraft. Thus they fully understood that they were possibly infected with the SARS virus when departing from an endemic area and before heading for Taiwan, despite the aggressive screening procedures put in place by the Hong Kong Customs and Department of Health at Hong Kong's International Airport. In order to explain the circumstances for this observed phenomenon and the underlying reasons for such behavior, we proceeded to the second part of our study. Here, six patients visiting the emergency department of E-Da Hospital, from March 19 to 22, 2003, were found to show symptoms from respiratory tract infections, after they had departed from a SARS endemic area and had entered the territory of Taiwan by air. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, although none of the six patients were eventually diagnosed wild SARS, this observed phenomenon disclosed a very important loophole in the control aspect of international quarantine procedures: the inability to prevent persons with a highly contagious virus from slipping past undetected and thus preventing the further spread of epidemics like SARS on international travel routes. All of these patients admitted that extraordinarily high medical fees for non-residents in Hong Kong, was the major reason for them to hurry back to Taiwan, where the cost medical care is significantly lower.
