Like any assay, ICH Q2 should be used to validate ES-DMA for any particular application, e.g., testing particle size distributions of vaccines or gene therapy vectors. According to ICH Q2, "the objective of validation of an analytical procedure is to demonstrate that it is suitable for its intended purpose." This guidance recommends evaluation of a quantitative assay along seven lines of inquiry; namely specificity, linearity, range, accuracy, precision, robustness, system suitability, limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ). In the remainder of this article, the phages were considered as though they were the models for industrially relevant virus preparations of interest and the performance of ES-DMA was evaluated as a quantitative assay relative to ICH Q2 criteria to measure the viral analyte present in the sample.
