Eighteen patients (6 men and 12 women; average age, 41.7±21.6 years) were accommodated with our ECMO transport system. Of these, 2 patients were Values are presented as mean±standard deviation or number (%). ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. children. Sixteen patients were transported to our hospital for ECMO therapy and 8 of these patients required lung transplantation. Two patients were transported to other hospitals for multiple trauma management and lung transplantation. Transfer was necessitated by an acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in 7 patients (38.9%), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring lung transplantation in 1 patient (5.5%), and severe ARDS in 10 patients (55.6%). The causes of ARDS are shown in Table 2 . Ten patients were candidates for lung transplantation at the time of transport. The average Murray score [4] was 3.4±0.2, and the average sequential organ failure assessment score was 12.7±1.6. All patients required inotropic agents such as norepinephrine, and the mean lactate level was 6.8±3.0 mg/dL. The average PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 57.4±11.0 and all patients met the criteria for severe respiratory failure. VV ECMO was used in 14 patients. Four patients with cardiogenic shock required VA ECMO to support cardiac function. Of those, 3 patients had right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension, and 1 had a severe pulmonary thromboembolism ( Table 2) . All transport was conducted on the ground by ambulance. The distances covered ranged from 26 to 408 km (average, 65.9±88.1 km) and the average transport time was 56.1±57.3 minutes (range, 30 to 280 minutes). All patients were transported without adverse events. There were no adverse events involving mechanical or vehicle problems during transport (average gas flow, 6.1±3.8 L/min; average blood flow, 3.5±0.7 L/min) ( Table 3) . All patients maintained a stable mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and O 2 saturation during transfer (Table 4) . After transport, 4 patients (22.2%) underwent lung transplantation because of ILD. Eight patients who had severe ARDS showed recovery of heart and lung function after ECMO therapy. Four patients died in the hospital. Of these, 3 patients died of multi-organ failure during in-hospital ECMO support, and 1 patient died of ventilator-associated pneumonia after successful withdrawal of ECMO. The average duration of ECMO therapy was 14.3±13.9 days and the average ICU stay was 17.7±13.9 days. A total of 13 patients (70.6%) were successfully taken off ECMO, and 11 patients (61.1%) survived. − 12 −
