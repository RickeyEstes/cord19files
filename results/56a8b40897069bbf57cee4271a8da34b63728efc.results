All calves were healthy at the start of the study and had adequate transfer of passive immunity; STP was 5.91 ± 0.13 and 5.94 ± 0.14 g/dL for control and treated calves, respectively. There were no interactions between treatment and time for any measurements in this study. Providing SCB treatment in the MR did not alter MR intake, which averaged 7.2 L/d during the first 5 weeks and 4.0 L/d during week 6. Starter intake also was not affected by treatment; however, it did significantly increase with age, averaging 173 g/d during the first 5 weeks, 892 g/d at week 6 and 2383 g/d during week 7 and 8 ( Table 2 ). The MR intake (Fig. 1A) and starter intake (Fig. 1B) of calves were similar between treatments. The most rapid increase of starter intake occurred during the week of weaning. There was no difference between treatments for ADG ( Fig. 1C ) and final BW, which was 88.02 ± 1.92 kg for Control and 87.42 ± 1.52 kg for Treat at week 8 of life (data not shown). Ratio of ME intake:gain was unaffected by treatment (Table 2) , and averaged 8.64 ± 0.54 Mcal/kg and 7.68 ± 0.42 Mcal/kg for Control and Treat, respectively. In addition, fecal score ( Fig. 1D ) was also not affected by treatment. However, there were significant age effects (P < 0.01) for ME intake, ADG, ME intake:gain and fecal score ( Table 2 ). The highest values for ME intake and ADG were both at week 8 (7.11 Mcal/g and 1044 g/d, respectively), whereas the lowest values were at week 6 (5.09 Mcal/g) and week 2 (422 g/d), respectively. The highest ME intake:gain was at week 2 (11.22 Mcal/kg) and the lowest was at week 1 (4.89 Mcal/kg). The highest fecal scores were at week 2 (averaged 1.56), and the values dropped close to 0 from week 5 of age to the end of the study. The number of days in which calves had diarrhea (fecal score ≥ 2) averaged 5.14, and were not different between treatments. Moreover, the nasal and ear scores of calves were not altered by treatment. Almost all calves scored 0 (i.e., normal) during the entire study (data not shown). There was no treatment effect on fecal populations of total bacteria, E. coli, Clostridium cluster XIVa, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii or Bifidobacterium (Table 3) . However, there were significant time effects (P < 0.01) for populations of total bacteria, E. coli, Clostridium cluster XIVa and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. The fecal E. coli population was reduced (P < 0.01) with age, with the highest value being at day 7. In contrast, populations of total bacteria and Clostridium cluster XIVa from day 35 and 56 were higher (P < 0.01) than those from day 7. In addition, the Faecalibacterium prausnitzii population was increased (P < 0.01) from day 7 to Table 2 Intake, growth performance and fecal score of claves treated with or without yeast probiotic (Saccharomyces cerevisiae var boulardii) during the first 8 weeks.
