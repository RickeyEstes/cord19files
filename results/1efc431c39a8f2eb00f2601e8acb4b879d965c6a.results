Twelve experiments resulted in 223 colonies (7.4% of wells seeded) which survived at least 15 days, 23 (0.8%) of them survived for several months and were stored in liquid nitrogen after propagation in HAT-medium for 2 weeks. Under the conditions described above, the fusion experiments did not result in more than one colony per well, i.e. there was one developing colony in 5 x 10 6 cells seeded. No heterohybridomas secreting feline IgM or IgG could be detected by ELISA. The heterohybridoma cells were larger than their parental lines. Typically, one clone (37/5C5) was 15.13 _ 1.14#m dia, compared to 12.71 _ 0.69/tin for its parental line Ag8 (Fig. 1) . Depending on the parental line heterohybridomas generally multiplied slower [ Fig. 2(a), (b) ] and had a lower maximum cell density compared to NSO or Ag8.
