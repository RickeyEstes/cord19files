EBOV GP mediates cell-cell fusion mediated fusion is much longer than for some viral fusion proteins, such as IAV HA [28] , but comparable to others, such as HIV Env in some studies [29] . We thus tested, at various times, whether some of the cell pairs that had not yet fully fused had hemifused: the addition of 0.5 mM CPZ to cell pairs ruptures hemifusion diaphragms that have formed between cell pairs, and this is a standard means to test for hemifusion [30, 31, 32] . We used thermolysin-treated effector cells to maximize cleavage of EBOV GP and found that adding CPZ either 30, 45, or 60 min after reneutralization did not induce any dye spread above that already observed, strongly indicating that a negligible percentage of cells were hemifused, but not fused, at any given time. NPC1 is an intracellular receptor for EBOV GP [14, 33] . We compared extents of fusion for target parental HEK 293T cells versus target HEK 293T cells that stably overexpressed NPC1. Effector cells that were not treated with thermolysin yielded fusion at pH 7.2 ( Fig 3A, bar 2) , and a greater extent of fusion after a 10-min acidic pH 5.7 pulse (Fig 3A, bar 1) . The extent of calcein spread was greater for target cells overexpressing NPC1 (Fig 3A, bars 3 and 4) than for parental 293T cells (Fig 3A, bars 1 and 2) for matching conditions. Fusion was still pH-dependent for target cells overexpressing NPC1: calcein spread was greater 2 hr after a 10-min pH 3 (merged) . The viral proteins expressed by transfecting effector cells are shown to the right of the images. Cells expressing EBOV GP were treated with 200 μg/ml thermolysin for 20 min; fusion was augmented with a 10-min pH 5.7 pulse. For cells expressing JSRV Env, a 10-min pH 5.0 pulse was used to trigger fusion. Effector cells expressing influenza virus (IAV) HA were treated with trypsin and neuraminidase as described [28] , bound to HEK 293T cells, and fusion was triggered with a 10-min pH 4.8 pulse. For mock-transfected effector cells, a 10-min pH 5.7 pulse was employed. Fused cells are marked by arrowheads. For this set of experiments, the extent of fusion 1 hr after reneutralization was about 80% for EBOV GP, 50% for JSRV Env, and 70% for IAV HA. Thermolysin treatment results in greater extents of fusion between cells. (A) schematic of the experimental protocol is shown above the bar graph. E, effector cells; T, target cells, Th, thermolysin. Bar graph: Fusion of thermolysin-treated effector cells expressing EBOV GP (columns 1 and 2, dark red) was greater than for untreated cells (columns 3 and 4, dark yellow). For both thermolysin-treated and non-treated cells, a 10-min pH 5.7 pulse applied at room temperature augmented fusion, measured after an additional 2 h incubation at neutral pH. For each condition, at least 7 experiments were performed. Typical images used to obtain the data of the bar graph are shown on the right: in top images, cells were treated with 200 μg/ml thermolysin; in bottom images, cells were not treated. Cells that have fused are marked by arrows. (B) The kinetics of fusion for thermolysin-treated (dark red squares) and untreated (dark yellow circles) effector cells. Cleaving EBOV GP by thermolysin speeds fusion kinetics, but extents of fusion are the same for treated and untreated cells after a pH 5.7 pulse at 10°C is followed by a 4 h reneutralization. * p <0.05; *** p < 0.001. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1005373.g002 5.7 pulse (Fig 3A, bar 3 ) than in the absence of the pulse (Fig 3A, bar 4) . We confirmed that fusion was dependent on the presence of NPC1 by generating and purifying a recombinant soluble protein consisting of domain C of NPC1 fused to GST (denoted sNPC1). The purity and size of sNPC1 was confirmed (Fig 3B, inset) . We added sNPC1 to the external solution and found that the extent of fusion increased monotonically with the amount of sNPC1 added ( Fig  3B) , in accord with the prior demonstration that by binding NPC1, EBOV GP undergoes conformational changes favorable for fusion [18] . The augmentation of fusion by sNPC1 indicated that, although there was a sufficient amount of NPC1 on cell surfaces to stimulate fusion, this amount was relatively small and fusion was consequently limited. NPC1 is an endosomal protein [34] , but a small fraction of NPC1 may be present on the plasma membrane of a cell. We assessed this possibility by using flow cytometry to measure Overexpression of NPC1 (second set of two bars) led to greater fusion with effector cells than did mock-transfected target cells (first set of bars). For these experiments, the effector cells were not thermolysin-treated (i.e., these experiments relied on endogenous levels of GP cleavage). For each set of experiments, a 10-min pH 5.7 pulse (labeled "pulse pH +") led to more fusion than when pH was never lowered (-). For each condition, n = 4. binding with an antibody against NPC1 (from LifeSpan Biosciences) on parental 293 cells; shRNA that targeted NPC1 was stably expressed in one set of these 293 cells, and NPC1 was overexpressed in another set (Fig 3C and 3D ). The level of binding of the secondary FITClabeled antibody against endogenous NPC1 (as measured by mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) was 3-fold greater than in the absence of the primary Ab ( Fig 3C, bar 1 vs. bar 4, and Fig  3D) . Expression was reduced for cells in which NPC1 was knocked down by shRNA (bar 2), and was greater for cells in which NPC1 was overexpressed (bar 3). These results demonstrate that copies of NPC1 reside in the plasma membrane of the 293 cells we used as targets in cellcell fusion experiments. EBOV GP is certainly cleaved within endosomes as part of viral infection [26] . Because we observed cell-cell fusion at acidic pH without adding thermolysin, it is extremely likely that a fraction of GP on the cell surface was cleaved into a fusion-competent form. An antibody that only recognizes cleaved GP has not been reported, so we had to devise an alternate means to quantitatively measure the extent of cleavage. We were able to distinguish between the two forms of GP by using the property that NPC1 binds to cleaved, but not uncleaved, EBOV GP. We used a sNPC1 to examine cleaved GP by flow cytometry; in parallel, we measured the total amount of GP on cell surfaces by using an anti-FLAG antibody that bound to the FLAG tag on our GP construct. We also created a GP construct that was intrinsically more likely to be cleaved on the cell surface: we inserted the furin recognition site RRKR at amino acids 203-206 of GP1 (referred to as GP furin ), the putative cleavage site for CatL in GP1 [16, 35] . We reasoned that because exogenous expression of furin facilitates cleavage at this inserted site, generating the fusion-active 18-19 kDa subunit, the extent of cleavage of GP on the plasma membrane as well as the extent of cell-cell fusion would be greater for this construct than for WT. We experimentally confirmed our expectations: We determined the amount of cleaved GP on the cell surface by adding sNPC1 (fused with GST) to cells expressing either EBOV GP or GP furin , and measuring their binding to an anti-GST antibody. This antibody was detected by a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Fig 4) . The fraction of WT GP cleaved on parental cells ( Fig 4A, bar 1 ) was the same for cells that were transfected with both GP and furin (bar 2). The specificities of sNPC1 and antibody binding were confirmed by the 4-5 fold higher fluorescence than was seen for cells that did not express GP (bar 5). It is notable that cotransfection of cells by GP furin and furin resulted in greater cleavage (bar 4 vs bar 3). We found that the expression of total WT GP as measured by the anti-FLAG antibody was not significantly altered by coexpression of furin ( Fig 4B, columns 1 and 2 ), but cells that coexpressed GP furin and furin consistently showed a decreased total GP (compare bar 3 and 4), possibly due to non-specific degradation of GP furin . To determine the relative percentage of cleaved GP, we normalized cleaved GP by total GP. (These are relative and not absolute percentages because different antibodies were used to detect cleaved vs. total GP.) We found that a higher percentage of GP on the plasma membrane was cleaved for cells coexpressing GP furin and furin than for cells expressing WT GP or GP furin alone ( Fig 4C) . Western blot analyses, using an anti-FLAG or an anti-GP1 antibody (kind gift of James Cunningham), showed that the addition of furin increased the amount of cleaved GP furin construct as compared to GP furin alone (Fig 4D, lanes 4 and 5 in left and right panels). Furin did not cleave any WT GP (lanes 1). We used these constructs to verify that an increased cleavage of EBOV GP led to a greater extent of fusion ( Fig  4E) . Cotransfecting cells with GP and furin (bar 2) led to the same extent of fusion as did transfection of GP alone (bar 1). In contrast, cotransfecting with GP furin and furin led to more fusion (bar 4) than transfecting only GP furin (bar 3). Control experiments of transfecting only furin showed that furin, per se, did not promote fusion (bar 5). These experiments, taken together, establish that EBOV GP does appear on the cell surface, that some of it is cleaved, and that for the GP furin construct, cleavage is augmented by coexpression of furin. To further confirm that the observed fusion was indeed mediated by EBOV GP, we utilized mutations that had previously been shown to greatly reduce viral infection [36] . We used MLV pseudovirus expressing GP, and observed that, indeed, the level of infection caused by the point mutant W597A (Fig 5, bar 2) , the double mutant G598A/G599A (bar3), and the point mutant I610A (bar 4) were all substantially less than for WT GP ( Bar 1) . We then measured the extents of cell-cell fusion mediated by each of the mutant proteins. The extent of fusion in absence of thermolysin treatment supported by all three of the mutants (Fig 5B, bars 2 , 3, and 4) was much less than for WT GP (bar 1). Flow cytometry measurements, using the same cells as for fusion experiments, showed that each of the mutant GPs was well expressed on the cell surface ( Fig 5C) . These experiments provide support that reduced infectivity by EBOV correlates with reduced GP-mediated fusion. We next tested 3.47, a small molecule inhibitor against NPC1, which prevents EBOV entry, as well as testing a neutralizing antibody (KZ52) against EBOV GP. We found that both significantly reduced EBOV GP-mediated cell-cell fusion (Fig 6A and 6B ). The inhibitor 3.47 greatly reduced EBOV GP-mediated fusion but did not significantly alter cell-cell fusion induced by either Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) E1/E2 or IAV HA (Fig 6A, 3 .47 at 1 μM). Similarly, the neutralizing antibody KZ52, which recognizes the interface between GP1 and GP2 [37] , reduced EBOV GP-mediated fusion, but not SFV-E1/E2 or IAV HA-induced fusion ( Another central fingerprint of GP-mediated fusion is inhibition of EBOV infectivity by Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). By neutralizing endosomes, BafA1 inhibits infection, at least in part, by reducing cathepsin activity which in turn results is reduced cleavage of GP1. We found that addition of BafA1 (25 or 100 nM) reduced the amount of cleaved GP that appeared on the cell surface ( Fig 6C, bar 2 vs bar 1). This occurred despite a consistently greater amount of total GP in the plasma membrane after the addition of BafA1 (Fig 6D) . (This greater amount was unexpected. Possibly, BafA1 prevented lysosomal degradation of GP.) Normalizing the amount of cleaved GP by the total shows that cleavage of cell surface GP was significantly reduced by BafA1 ( Fig 6E) . Thus, all data support the conclusion that the aqueous dye spread we observe is due to fusion induced by EBOV GP.
