Inactivated MERS-CoV was characterized by WB and was shown to contain S and NP viral components (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Purified NTD, RBD and NP were found to be highly pure and antigenic by WB (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Normal controls, i.e., sera from 40 healthy blood donors, were used to determine background values and calculate cutoff levels. IgG and IgM against inactivated MERS-CoV, S, NTD, RBD and NP and IgG against S1 Figure S2) . A longitudinal profile of binding antibodies (IgG and IgM) and NAb against MERS-CoV in sera from the first case of imported MERS-CoV in China was analyzed depending on the whole MERS-CoV and recombinant protein ELISAs and the ppNT. Figures 1 and 2 showed that the ELISAs readily detected specific antibodies in the patient's sera. The MERS-CoV S-based ELISA showed the highest sensitivity, followed by the S1-and RBD-based ELISAs; the inactivated MERS-CoV-, NTD-and NP-based ELISAs were not as sensitive as the S-, S1-and RBD-based ELISAs. Moreover, the S-, S1-and RBD-based ELISAs showed broader measurement ranges than those based on inactivated MERS-CoV, NTD and NP. In the ppNT assay, NAb positivity appeared as early as anti-S antibody positivity, as determined by the ELISAs (Figure 1 ). Anti-S antibodies were first detected by ELISA (IgM on day 6 and IgG on day 5 after admission), followed by antibodies against S1 and RBD, then antibodies against MERS-CoV particles and NTD and, finally, antibodies against NP (by days 12-13 after admission) (Supplementary Figure S3) . The whole virus-based ELISA kit was able to detect antibodies specific for all structural components of the virus. In the present study, correlations of the recombinant protein-based ELISAs with that based on inactivated MERS-CoV were analyzed. The scatter plots in Figure 3 show excellent correlations between the MERS-CoV ELISA and the S1, RBD and NP ELISA, with Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.9292-0.9488. S and NTD ELISAs were less strongly correlated with the MERS-CoV ELISA, with Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.8122-0.8420. Subsequently, correlations of the S, NTD and RBD ELISA results with those of the commercial S1 ELISA were examined. The scatter plots in Figure 4 show excellent correlations between the S1 ELISA and the S and RBD ELISAs, with Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.9234-0.9701, and the NTD ELISA was less strongly correlated with the S1 ELISA, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.8807. The MERS S ppNT is a sensitive and specific assay used for detecting NAbs against MERS-CoV. Here we examined the relationship between the ppNT and various ELISAs. The scatter plots in Figure 5 show that only the S ELISA had a strong correlation with the ppNT, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.9319. The MERS-CoV, S1, NTD and RBD ELISAs were less strongly correlated with the MERS S ppNT, with Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.71-0.8439.
