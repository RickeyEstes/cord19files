A total of 120,330 hospitalizations were observed for the seven selected ACSCs during four time periods (pre-SARS, SARS, post-SARS-1 and post-SARS-2) in 2003. Table 1 displays the actual number of hospitalizations for each selected ACSC and appendicitis, as well as the percentage changes in the number of hospitalizations from 2002 to 2003. Among the seven ACSCs, COPD had the most hospital admissions, with approximately 42,000 patients. All the hospitalizations for selected ACSCs were reduced in the SARS period compared with those in 2002, most notably among circulatory and respiratory conditions. The hospitalizations for most conditions were still reduced in the post-SARS-1 period, with the exception of diabetes and hypertension, which increased more than 10%, when compared with the numbers in 2002, during the post-SARS-2 period. For appendicitis, the admission numbers had stable reductions in pre-and post-SARS periods. As well as ACSCs, the number of appendicitis admissions decreased substantially in the SARS period. Table 1 also presents the number of outpatient visits for each selected ACSC, and the patterns for outpatient visits were similar to those for ACSC admissions in the SARS period. However, for diabetes, the reduction in outpatient visits was much more than the reduction in the admissions. Table 2 presents the predicted hospitalization rates, the associated 95% CI obtained from the ARIMA model, and the differences between the actual and predicted hospitalization rates among the four periods. During the pre-SARS period, admission rates for all conditions did not differ significantly from their predictive values. However, during the SARS period, admission rates for pediatric asthma, COPD, and angina without procedure were reduced by 5.28, 7.47, and 2.50 per 100,000 population per month, and were significantly (p < 0.05) different from their respective predictive values. In general, the actual hospitalization rates for respiratory and circulatory conditions were lower than the predicted rates in the post-SARS periods. The admission rates for all respiratory conditions were lower compared with their predictive values in the post-SARS periods; however, the differences were significant only in the post-SARS-1 period. Yet they were higher than the predicted rates for hypertension (during post-SARS-2) and diabetic conditions. The diabetes admission rates increased by 0.52 per 100,000 population per month, which was significant (p < 0.05) in the post-SARS-2 period. Compared with the ACSCs, the admission rate for appendicitis remained insignificant during all study periods. Figures 1-3 display the monthly trends in hospitalization rates for the seven selected ACSCs, with predicted values and 95% CI indicated for 2002 and 2003. During the SARS period, the actual hospitalization rates for all selected ACSCs were significantly lower than the lower boundary of the 95% CI of the predicted rates for at least 1 month, except for diabetes. The differences in hospitalization rates for respiratory conditions during the post-SARS-1 period, shown in Figure  1 , were also significant for at least 1 month. Yet, only the differences in pediatric asthma remained significant in two of the three months during the post-SARS-2 period. In Figure 2 , the actual hospitalization rates for the three circulatory conditions all fell within the range of the 95% CI of their predicted values in both post-SARS periods. Figure 3 shows that the actual admission rates for diabetes also fell within the 95% CI during both post-SARS periods. Nonetheless, the actual admission rates for diabetes were significantly higher than the predicted rates and exceeded the upper limit of the 95% CI at the end of 2003.
