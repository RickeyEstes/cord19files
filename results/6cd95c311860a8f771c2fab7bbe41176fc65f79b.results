The total number of admitted patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia during the study period was 1059 (23% of total hospital admission). Among them, 792 (74.8%) patients were males, and 267 (25.2%) were females. The male-to-female ratio was 3:1. The mean age was 56.8 years (range 48âˆ’64 years). 331 (31%) were admitted to the ICU, and the remaining 728 (69%) were admitted to the ward. Fig. 1 shows the detailed annual distribution of pneumonia admissions in the hospital throughout the study period. In general, ICU admissions gradually declined over the study period (39 to 17 patients) with regards to the need for ventilation. (Fig. 2) The majority of patients were from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and North African countries. This finding could be explained by the fact that there were a larger number of pilgrims from these countries compared to other countries who participated in the Hajj. (Fig. 3) The main risk factors were age >50 years, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 76 (7.17%) patients, bronchial asthma in 83 (7.84%), diabetes mellitus in 369 (34.84%), and cardiovascular diseases in 247 (23.32%) patients. The mean duration of symptoms before presentation was 6.46 community-acquired MRSA (6.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.1%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1%). Multiple causative pathogens were isolated in 158 (14.92%) patients. The association between X-ray findings and positive microbiological test results was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The mean length of stay in the ward was 5 days (range 3-7 days) while in the ICU was 14.5 days (range 10-19 days). The mortality rate was 2.4% in the ward and 21.45% in the ICU. (Fig. 4)
