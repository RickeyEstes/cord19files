Of the 308 individuals enrolled in the study, 181 participants experienced 284 ARI episodes. We were unable to measure IP-10 levels during 59 of the ARI episodes due to challenges getting samples within 72 h of onset of symptoms, as required by protocol (Fig. 1 ). Thus, we were able to collect serum samples for IP-10 concentration during 225 ARI episodes that occurred in 157 individuals ( Table 1) . Characteristics of these 225 ARI episodes with corresponding IP-10 collection can be also be found in Table 1 . There were no statistically significant differences in ARI global severity or ARI duration between the ARI episodes where IP-10 was collected as compared to the ARI episodes where IP-10 was not collected. In addition, we were unable to collect IP-10 on the same day as the WURSS symptom scores for five ARIs (n = 220 for same day symptom level analyses). Serum IP-10 at baseline correlates with age (rho = 0.31 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.16-0.44]; p < 0.0001) and BMI (rho = 0.37 [95% CI: 0.22-0.49]; p < 0.0001). While men had lower IP-10 than women at baseline (median = 138 (IQR: 109-183) vs median = 154 (123-199), respectively), these differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.27). Serum IP-10 correlated with ARI severity, duration, and symptoms (Fig. 2 ). An ARI induced an increase in IP-10 over baseline almost 80% of the time with serum IP-10 increasing from baseline (median: 152 pg/ml [IQR: 119-192]) to ARI (median: 295 pg/ml [IQR: 172-433]; p < 0.0001). While baseline IP-10 did not correlate with ARI outcomes, both ARI IP-10 and change in IP-10 correlated with all of the ARI outcomes (Table 2) . ARI IP-10 correlates significantly with ARI global severity (rho = 0.28 [95% CI: 0.15-0.39]; p < 0.001) and duration (rho = 0.14 [95% CI: 0.01-0.27]; p = 0.03) (Fig. 2) . After adjusting for age, sex, and BMI, for every unit increase in log-based 10 IP-10, there was an increase in log 10 ARI global severity of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.28-0.72) ( Table 3 ). This implies that an IP-10 concentration of 100 pg/ml predicted a 50 unit (95% CI: 44-67 units) increase in ARI global severity. For every 10% increase in IP-10 from baseline, there was a 1.8% increase in ARI global severity (95% CI: 0.9-2.7%). IP-10 with ARI correlates with the ARI severity on day of serum collection in the expected positive direction both for the daily severity score (rho = 0. 34 Table 2 ). These relationships remain after adjusting for age, gender, and BMI (Table 3) . Finally, serum IP-10 concentrations are higher in individuals with an ARI in which a viral pathogen was detected a As modeled using log-based 10 transformation. b All models include the following covariates: age, gender, and BMI at baseline. c Observed on the day of the IP-10 blood draw.
