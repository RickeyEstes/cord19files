LoD and validation of the designed EV-D68 RT-nested PCR. Using serial dilutions of the assay EV-D68-positive control, the minimal amount of virus detected by the specific PCR assay was 1 CCID 50 /ml. A set of 15 EV strains from species A to C and four EV-D68 isolates was analysed for testing the RT-PCR efficiency. Only EV-D68-positive samples were amplified ( Table 1) . The cross-reactivity with other viruses was also studied. Rhinoviruses (RV) or human parechoviruses (HPeV) were not detected. EV genotype identification. From the total of 546 EV-positive respiratory samples included in the study, 410 (75.1%) were successfully amplified with EV-A, B, C or D68 RT-nested PCRs. RV was identified in 41 samples and in the remaining 95 untyped EV, the presence of EV-D68 was excluded by using a RTnested PCR in 5´-non-coding region of the EV genome [27] and subsequent sequencing. EV-D68 was the most frequent serotype detected (N = 191, 46.6%), followed by EV-A71 (N = 31, 7.6%), coxackievirus (CV)-A6 (N = 25, 6.1%), echovirus (E)-30 (N = 19, 4.6%) and E-6 (N = 12, 2.9%). Other EV types were also identified in minor proportion ( Figure 1 ). Overall, the distribution of EV species was 46.6% for EV-D, 27.8% for EV-B, 25.1% for EV-A and 0.5% for EV-C ( Figure 1 ). Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of EV-D68 infections: comparison with EV-A or B infections. Overall, EV-A and B types were detected throughout the year whereas EV-D68 was identified during the cold months (from October to March) ranged from 20 to 54% of the total EVs in those periods. In 2016 and 2018, in addition, a high incidence of EV-D68 infections was detected between April and September (warm months) with 121 and 22 cases which represented 74.2 and 70.9% respectively of the total EV typed in those months ( Figure 2 ). In 175/191 (91.6%) EV-D68 infections, the virus was the only known respiratory infectious agent detected in the samples. RV, human adenovirus (HAdV) and bocavirus (HBoV) were co-detected in nine, three and two of the EV-D68 patients, respectively. In addition, one patient was co-infected together with HAdV and HBoV, and another with RV, HAdV and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV). However, coinfection with one (N = 30), two (N = 11), three (N = 1) or even four (N = 2) respiratory viruses was identified in 44 out of 217 EV-A or B-positive patients (20.3% vs. 8.4% in EV-D68 infections, p = 0.000001), RV being the most frequent (N = 20). Also identified were respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, HAdV, HBoV, HPIV, human coronavirus OC43 and influenza A virus. Clinical data were available in 346 characterized EV infections: 172 were EV-D68-positive patients, 138 children (mean age, 3.2 ± SD 3.1 years, interquartile range 3.3) and 34 adults (mean age 57.2 ± SD 19.1 years, interquartile range 29.8); 174 were patients with EV-A/B infections, 164 children (mean age 2.1± SD 2.1 years, interquartile range 2.1) and 10 adults (mean age 65.4 ± SD 16.6 years, interquartile range 25.9). Bronchitis were more frequently diagnosed in EV-D68-infected children compared to EV-A/EV-Bpositive patients (p < 0.01), whereas EV-A or EV-B genotypes were mainly detected in upper respiratory tract infections (p < 0.01) ( Table 2 ). There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients who were admitted to the ICU when comparing EV-D68 with EV-A or B-positive patients (23/172, 13.4% vs 18/174 10.3%, p = 0.3904). All patients but two admitted to ICU were children. Regarding previous clinical history, 49 out of 346 patients had an underlying disease (leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, cystic fibrosis, liver transplantation, congenital heart disease, and asthma or recurrent wheezing). Of them, 28/172 patients were infected by EV-D68 (16.3%) and 21/174 by EV-A or B (12.1%) (p = 0.1654). Only 4 of these patients required admission to the ICU.
