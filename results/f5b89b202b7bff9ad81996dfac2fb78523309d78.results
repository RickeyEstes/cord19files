A retrospective study, described here, was conducted to determine if PDCoV was introduced at approximately the same time as PEDV or if this may have occurred independently. The 1734 clinical samples tested for PDCoV represents 903 ISU VDL cases from eighteen states submitted from early October 2012 to December 2013 to detect various enteric pathogens. A total of five samples tested positive for the presence of PDCoV RNA with C T values of 14.6, 15.1, 28.1, 36.6 and 36.7, respectively. The states, pathogens and specimens tested from the 903 cases are given as a total and percentage in Table 1 . The numbers of PDCoV positive cases are also included in Table 1 . The PDCoV genome was first detected in a fecal sample collected on August 19th 2013 from a pig in Minnesota with a history of diarrhea and positive for Salmonella krefeld but negative for PEDV by PCR followed by detection of PDCoV in another fecal sample collected on August 20th from a pig in Iowa with lesions of ileitis and positive for Lawsonia intracellularis but negative for PEDV by PCR. RNA extracted from a fixed intestine sample collected on August 27th 2013 from Iowa that was negative for PEDV and positive for Rotavirus group A, group B and group C also tested positive for PDCoV. Thereafter, PDCoV was detected in fecal samples collected on August 29th 2013 in two additional pigs from Illinois which were negative by PCR for PEDV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and L. intracellularis and also negative by immunohistochemistry for PEDV, group A rotavirus and TGEV.
