Mice infected with H5N1 HPAI virus exhibit severe pneumonia with insufficient induction of humoral immune responses. Our experiments were designed to compare pathogenic processes that occur during H1N1 pdm and H5N1 HPAI viral infection in mice. Naïve BALB/c mice were infected with either H1N1 pdm virus or H5N1 HPAI virus at the same infectious dose (1 × 10 4 PFU in a volume of 50 μ L per mouse) (Fig. 1) . The H5N1-infected mice exhibited marked decreases in body weight through day 9 (Fig. 1a) , and all of these animals died or were humanely euthanized since symptoms reached a humane endpoint (see Methods) by 10 days post-infection (dpi) (Fig. 1b) . In contrast, mice infected with H1N1 pdm virus exhibited moderate decreases in body weight before recovering without mortality (Fig. 1a,b) . Pathological analyses demonstrated that the mice infected with H5N1 HPAI virus developed severe pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage at 7 dpi and that the symptoms were markedly aggravated at 9 dpi (Fig. 1c) . In contrast, the mice infected with H1N1 pdm virus showed only partial inflammation (Fig. 1c) . The day-9 histopathological scores in the mice infected with H5N1 HPAI virus were significantly higher than those in the mice infected with H1N1 pdm virus (5.2 ± 0.8 vs. 2.2 ± 0.7 (mean ± SD), respectively; Fig. 1d ). To investigate differences in immune responses against H5N1 HPAI virus and H1N1 pdm virus infection in mice, we measured half-maximal titer of neutralizing antibody (NT 50 ) and titer of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) against each virus. In mice infected with H1N1 pdm virus, the NT 50 titer increased markedly from 5 dpi, reaching a mean value of 3487 ± 1250 at 9 dpi (Fig. 1e) . The HI titer achieved a mean value of 207.5 ± 1.7 at 9 dpi (Fig. 1f) . In contrast, the NT 50 and HI titers in all H5N1 HPAI-infected mice (with the exception of one H5N1-infected mouse) remained below the limits of detection (4 in NT 50 titer and 10 in HI titer; Fig. 1e and f) during the experimental period.
