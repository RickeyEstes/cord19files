Polyclonal antibodies to the SARS-CoV unique proteins, 8a and 8b For SARS-CoV isolated from humans infected in the middle phase of the epidemic, the subgenomic RNA 8 encodes two proteins, 8a and 8b, of 39 and 84 aa, respectively (Figs. 1A and B) . Mouse polyclonal antibodies were raised against bacterially expressed GST-fusion 8a and 8b proteins. To determine the specificity of these antibodies, Western blot analysis was performed to detect 8a, 8b and 8ab expressed in transiently transfected Vero E6 cells. As shown in Fig. 1C , mouse anti-8a polyclonal antibody specifically detected 8a and 8ab whereas mouse anti-8b polyclonal antibody detected 8b and 8ab. 8a and 8b migrated close to their predicted molecular weight of 4.5 kDa and 9.6 kDa, respectively, whereas two forms of 8ab, ∼ 14 kDa (major) and ∼ 12 kDa (minor), were detected (Fig. 1C ). As the predicted molecular weight of 8ab is 13.8 kDa, the minor form is likely to have arisen from cleavage of the full-length protein. Expression of 8a and 8b in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells SARS-CoV 2003VA2774, an isolate from a SARS patient in Singapore, was used to infect Vero E6 cells as previously described (Tan et al., 2004b ) and anti-8a or anti-8b polyclonal antibodies were used in indirect immunofluorescence experiments to determine the expression of 8a and 8b, respectively, in infected cells (Figs. 2A and B) . The 8a and 8b proteins were detected in SARS-CoV-infected cells and were found to be localized in the cytoplasm. The same antibodies were used to examine the detailed cellular localization of 8a, 8b and 8ab, expressed from DNA constructs, in Vero E6 cells (Figs. 2A and B) . Whereas 8a and 8b were found in punctuate vesicle-like structures throughout the cytoplasm, 8ab was found to be diffused in the cytoplasm. Hence, there appears to be significant differences in the conformations of 8a and 8ab although 35 out of 39 aa of 8a is present in the 8ab Fig. 2 . Cellular localizations of 8a and 8b in SARS-CoV-infected cells and Vero E6 cells transfected with DNA constructs for expressing 8a, 8b and 8ab. Specific mouse anti-8a and anti-8b polyclonal antibodies were used in indirect immunofluorescence experiments to determine the expressions of (A) 8a and (B) 8b, respectively. The top two panels showed the specific reactivities of the anti-8a and anti-8b antibodies to proteins expressed in SARS-CoV-infected cells (right panels) as no unspecific staining was observed for the mock-infected cells (left panels). The bottom two panels showed the reactivities of the antibodies to 8a and 8ab (A) or 8b and 8ab (B) expressed in Vero E6 by transfection of cDNA constructs. a These proteins were immunoprecipitated using myc-polyclonal antibody and protein A-agarose. b These proteins were co-expressed with the bait proteins and coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed to be determined if they could bind the bait proteins. The strengths of the binding were classified as strong, weak or no interaction. protein (Fig. 1B) . Similarly, 77 out of 84 aa of 8b is present in 8ab, but the cellular localization of 8b is distinct from 8ab.
