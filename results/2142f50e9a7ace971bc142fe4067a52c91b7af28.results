In general, all virus inactivation data over time were non-linear, with tails and shoulders in the curves. Because of this, the Weibull model was generally a better representation of the data, resulting in greater Adj. R 2 values compared with those obtained with the log linear model. Delta values from the Weibull model (time necessary to reduce virus concentration in 1 log) were compared among feed and feed ingredient samples for PEDV, PDCoV and TGEV to characterize virus inactivation kinetics ( Table 2 ). There were no differences in delta values for PEDV among the different feed or ingredient samples. Delta values were greater for PDCoV in soybean meal (42.04 days) and corn (25.60 days) samples compared with the other ingredients, indicating lower inactivation kinetics of PDCoV when incubated in soybean meal and corn. A similar trend was observed for TGEV, where soybean meal had a greater delta value (41.94 days) compared with that observed for the other ingredients. At the conclusion of the 56-day incubation period, the titers for all PEDV samples were 0.50 log TCID 50 /mL, except for soybean meal, which was greater at 0.83 log TCID 50 /mL (Table 3) . For PDCoV, day 0 titers were greater than those for PEDV, and ranged from 3.72 to 6.61 log TCID 50 /mL (Table 4 ). After the 56-day storage period, the greatest log reduction for PDCoV was observed in low oil DDGS (5.78) and high oil DDGS (5.45). The greatest virus survival occurred in soybean meal, with only 1.44 log reduction. A similar trend was observed for TGEV survival, where samples inoculated with TGEV had the greatest initial virus titers ranging from 3.51 to 7.17 log TCID 50 /mL (Table 5) . After the 56-day storage, the greatest log reduction was achieved in high oil DDGS (6.56) and medium oil DDGS (5.67) samples. Similar to PDCoV, the least log reduction was observed in soybean meal, with only 2.22 log reduction in the initial virus concentration. A Pearson correlation was performed to examine associations between ingredient chemical composition and virus survival. There was a moderate positive correlation for TGEV (r = 0.41, P = 0.02) and PDCoV (r = 0.49, P = 0.01) survival with moisture content. This suggests that increased moisture content may lead to increased virus survival, but this correlation was not observed for PEDV (Table 6 ). Furthermore, there was a moderate negative correlation between TGEV survival and ether extract content (r = -0.51, P = 0.01), suggesting increased ether extract content may reduce virus survival time, but this correlation was not observed for PEDV or PDCoV (Table 6 ).
