Bioinformatics approach to deducing molecular mimicry As described in the materials and methods section, the sequence of the African prototype of CHIKV S27 EI glycoprotein (Q8JUX5) was obtained from the SWISSPROT database and subjected to immune epitope analysis using five algorithms in IEDB and EMBOSS programs. The results are depicted in Fig 1. The scores obtained for the five algorithms were uploaded into an MS Excel sheet to generate a combined graph which yielded the putative epitopic regions of E1 glycoprotein of CHIKV. Analysis of the peaks in the graph with respect to antigenic propensity, surface accessibility, flexibility, hydrophilicity and B turns enabled prediction of the following epitopic regions: These regions of CHIKV E1 glycoprotein satisfy all the criteria necessary for a given peptide to be considered immunogenic and capable of eliciting an immune response in the host system. Subsequently multiple sequence alignment of E1 glycoprotein of Alphaviruses-CHIKV, Onyong Onyong Virus (ONNV), Ross River Virus (RRV), Semiliki Forest Virus (SFV), and Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV) was done through CLUSTALW. The results of the alignment are depicted in Fig 2. As evident from the figure, the alignment revealed two motifs SKD and KCA present only in arthritogenic Alphaviruses (CHIKV,ONNV, RRV) and not in encephalitogenic Alphaviruses (SFV, EEEV). Furthermore, the amino acid sequences SKD and KCA were present in the immunodominant peptides 1 and 2 deduced from E1 glycoprotein respectively. All further experiments using human serum samples and mouse models were therefore restricted only to these two peptides. The sequence similarity between the CHIKV E1 glycoprotein and HLA-B27 was determined using BLAST. The alpha chain of HLA-B27 molecule shared a partial homology from the stretch ranging from 216-220 of CHIKV E1 glycoprotein as well as the immunodominant region of Peptide A (Fig 3) . The output obtained through the BioXGEM 3D BLAST performed on the CHIKV E1 was limited to first 100 hits. The output of the BLAST was further analyzed and limited only to human proteins ( Table 2 ). Further analysis of these human proteins was limited to those that are known to contribute to the inflammation and arthritic pathology. Amongst these, six human proteins-Human complement component 3, complement component 5 [6] , fibronectin [7] , kelch like protein [8] , mast/stem cell growth receptor [9] and beta arrestin 1 [10] which exhibited maximum similarity to CHIKV EI protein were only considered for further analysis. Prominent among these six were complement proteins C3 and C5. When the structural similarity between the E1 glycoprotein and complement component C3 was analyzed, the sequence of amino acids in the region of CHIKV E1 glycoprotein which shared homology with complement component C3 were also present in Peptide A and Peptide B (Fig 4) .
