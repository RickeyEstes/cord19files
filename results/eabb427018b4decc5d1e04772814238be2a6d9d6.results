We present the results of our prior estimation techniques and our evaluation of forecast accuracy for the 2013-2014 influenza season. Again, to restrict our forecast to only one seasonal outbreak and avoid modeling influenza dynamics during the dormant summer months, our maximal influenza season is defined to be between the 32 nd and 20 th epidemiological weeks, or from mid-August to mid-May, for successive years. Our forecasts are only valid during this time period.
