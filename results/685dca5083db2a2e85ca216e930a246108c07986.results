Generation of Tc goat. Previously, we engineered a HAC, named isKcHAC∆, that comprises the entire human Ig genetic repertoire in the germline configuration in which the regulatory genomic sequences involved in pre-B cell receptor (preBCR) and BCR signaling during B cell development and those mediating human Ig class switch recombination are replaced with the respective genomic sequences from an ungulate (bovine) 6 . We have demonstrated in the Tc bovine system that the ungulate regulatory sequences engineered into the HAC allows high levels of hIgG expression and a hIgG subclass distribution with IgG1 dominancy, closely mimicking hIgG expression in humans 6 . We reasoned that these ungulate regulatory elements, due to their high similarity in sequence among ungulates, may also render the HAC to function well in Tc goats. Based on this rationale, we established single cell-derived Tc goat fibroblast cell colonies by transferring the isKcHAC∆ into goat fetal fibroblast cells via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) and used the produced Tc goat fibroblasts as nuclear donors for Tc goat production by SCNT. In total, 194 cloned embryos were generated using five isK-cHAC∆ containing fetal fibroblast colonies and were transferred into 14 estrus-synchronized does ( Table 1) . Pregnancy checks conducted with ultrasonography at day 40±3 of gestation confirmed that 4 out of 14 (28.6%) recipients were pregnant ( Table 1 ). The pregnancies were obtained only from colonies #10 and #18. Two of the pregnancies aborted between day 40 and day 60 of gestation, and one more had a mummified fetus that was lost at day 129 of gestation. One pregnancy initiated from colony #10 went to term and resulted in the birth of a healthy Tc goat (Fig. 1 ).
