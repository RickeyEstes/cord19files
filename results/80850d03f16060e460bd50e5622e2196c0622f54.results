Subunit vaccine against Ebola virus. 9mer peptides. In our study, we have generated all the possible overlapping 9mer peptides for each of the ebolavirus. We have removed the redundant as well as peptides found in human reference proteome (Table 1) . Further, the peptides present in 1000 Genomes-based human proteome were also filtered to avoid any cross presentation with any individual. We have observed 2 peptides from RESTV and single peptide from SUDV, which were shared with human reference proteome. In addition to that, we have also observed a peptide from EBOV that was not present in the human reference proteome but present among the peptides of 1000 Genomes-based human proteome. The protein-wise distribution of peptides from different ebolaviruses is shown in supplementary files ( Figure S1 ). Vaccine candidates. The conservation in a peptide among the different ebolaviruses is helpful for its applicability in a broad spectrum. Therefore, we have extracted conserved peptides (9mer), and found that 629 peptides were shared among all the five ebolaviruses in our study ( Figure S2 ) and 812 peptides were conserved among four human pathogenic ebolaviruses (excluding RESTV) (Fig. 2, Table 2 ). These common peptides, shared among different ebolaviruses, have the potential to design vaccine for all types of ebolaviruses. We computed protein-wise distribution of conserved peptides among different species of Ebola virus ( Figure S3 , Table S1 ). In order to identify conserved regions, we computed multiple sequence alignment of each protein of virus using ClustalW (Figures S4 and S5) . We also predicted immunogenicity of these peptides, particularly of conserved peptides, using our immuno-pipeline. In our analysis, we have not found any of the conserved peptides with B-cell epitopes and promiscuous MHC binders. There were 21 peptides that were common among all the four human pathogenic ebolaviruses (excluding RESTV, not pathogenic to human). These peptides are highly promiscuous vaccine candidates (Table 2) . We further analyzed 14 peptides that can activate most of the arms of the immune system ( Table 3) . Out of these 14 peptides, 2 were conserved in three species and three peptides were conserved in at least two ebolaviruses. siRNA-based therapy. Alignment of mRNA sequences. We performed the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) for genes across all the five ebolaviruses in order to identify the conserved regions in different genes. We were unable to locate a single 19mer oligonucleotide, common in all the five ebolaviruses. We got a stretch of maximum length of nine nucleotides across five ebolaviruses. In this study we used ClustalW software 24 for MSA and Jalview 39 visualization of alignment ( Figure S6 ). Potential siRNA suppressors. The specific 19mer oligonucleotides were generated in all the five ebolaviruses. Figure 3 shows the architecture of the Ebola RNAi pipeline, which presents the strategy adopted to identify potential therapeutic siRNAs. First, we computed the efficacy of each 19mer oligonucleotide using desiRm software at default threshold value of 0. Next, we identified 19mers, which were present in human genome in order to eliminate off-target interaction. Finally, we selected all those siRNAs, which may silence targets gene with efficacy more than a value of 0.80. We wanted to identify promiscuous siRNA that could target all five ebolaviruses. Unfortunately, we did not find a single common 19mer oligonucleotide in any of the five ebolaviruses ( Figure S7 ). The distribution of siRNAs selected against Ebola across the five ebolaviruses at gene level has been shown in Fig. 4 . The distribution of potential siRNAs against each target gene in ebolaviruses is shown in Table 4 and the number of siRNAs targeting common ebolaviruses is enlisted in Supplementary Table S2 . Our server shows potential siRNAs against target genes in the form of tables with the Circos plots 40 for visualization. Users can get detailed information like strain ID, gene, siRNA sequence, cognate mRNA sequence, starting position and efficacy from our website. Users can sort the table according to a position or efficacy to get the most efficacious siRNA along with other details. The detailed gene-wise distribution of siRNA from different ebolaviruses is shown in supplementary files ( Figure S8 ).
