JEV replicates in porcine nasal mucosa explants. As a first step, we challenged porcine nasal mucosa explants from four different pig donors with both JEV genotype 1 strain Laos and genotype 3 strain Nakayama, in comparison to mock control (Fig. 1) . After 48 h postinfection (hpi), JEV envelope (E) protein was detected in epithelial cells ( Fig. 1A and B) , with a more efficient infection found with the Laos strain-challenged tissues. An increase in JEV RNA loads from both strains was also detected in porcine nasal mucosa, indicative of virus replication (Fig. 1C ). JEV Laos RNA showed an increase in expression from 24 hpi on, further increasing at 48 hpi. The Nakayama strain displayed a slower viral RNA increase, with only three out of four positive samples 48 hpi (Fig. 1C) . JEV efficiently infects primary porcine NEC. To confirm and further investigate the ability of JEV to infect porcine NEC from their apical side, we utilized well-differentiated ALI cultures established from porcine nasal mucosa. These experiments showed that both JEV strains infected cultures from the apical side, resulting in virus replication (Fig.  2) . Again, the Laos strain showed statistically significantly higher levels of viral RNA than the Nakayama strain. Despite that, the two JEV strains tested displayed similar replication profiles, reaching a maximum at 72 hpi ( Fig. 2A) . To test for apical and/or basolateral live virus shedding upon infection, we collected basolateral chamber culture media and performed apical washings of the infected NEC. The results demonstrate that JEV was apically shed after infection with both JEV strains (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, similar JEV titers were detected in the culture media collected from the basolateral and apical sides of the inserts (Fig. 2C) , supporting the idea that infection of epithelial cells could result in a systemic infection. With respect to RNA levels, the maximum titers were reached at 72 hpi in both compartments of the ALI system. At 72 hpi, as shown in Fig. 2D , we visualized JEV infection of NEC by labeling of virus (E protein, green), nuclei (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride [DAPI], dark blue), tight junctions (ZO-1, light blue), and cilia (␤-tubulin, red). While we observed mainly isolated E protein-positive cells for the Nakayama strain, the Laos strain led to the formation of clusters of E protein-positive cells (Fig. 2D) and colocalization of E protein and ␤-tubulin signals, suggesting replication in ciliated epithelial cells (Fig. 2E) . Porcine nasal mucosa explants were challenged with JEV Laos or Nakayama at 10 5 TCID 50 /sample for 2 h, followed by wash steps and culture in medium for 48 h. In panel A, nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), cilia with anti-␤-tubulin (red), and JEV with anti-E protein 4G2 (green). The scale bar represents 10 m. Three-dimensional (3D) scans were acquired using confocal microscopy. In panel B, a higher magnification of panel A is shown. In panel C, viral RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Results were calculated as fold change of the threshold cycle and are represented as 25 to 75% interquartile boxes showing the mean and 95% confidence intervals. Different superscript letters indicate significant difference (P Յ 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without or with apostrophe for JEV Laos and Nakayama strain, respectively); significant differences between distinct JEV strains at the same time postinfection are shown by an asterisk. JEV infection of NEC is associated with limited cell death. In NEC cultures, JEV induced limited cell death, visualized as increased membrane permeability (dark blue in Fig. 3A ). This cell death was at least partially mediated by apoptosis since cleaved caspase 3 was detected in the infected cultures (red in Fig. 3B ). Relating to the higher rate of infection, the Laos strain induced more cell death than the Nakayama strain. JEV induces poor innate immune responses in NEC. Following infection of airway epithelial cells by respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus type 1, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, several proinflammatory cytokines are induced, including interleukin-1␤ (IL-1␤), IL-6, IL-8, and interferon lambda 1 to 3 (IFN-s) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) . We therefore assessed the innate immune response following JEV infection of NEC. Only JEV Laos induced significant IL-6 gene expression at a late time point (72 hpi [Fig. 4A] ). Both JEV strains induced a significant induction of IL-8 mRNA at 48 and 72 hpi (Fig. 4B) . Nevertheless, at the protein levels no virus-induced IL-1␤, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was detected at any of the time points tested (data not shown). Interestingly, IL-8 secretion was enhanced at 72 hpi (P Յ 0.001) in JEV Laos-infected NEC (2,055 Ϯ 595 pg/ml) compared with those in the mock control (1,201 Ϯ 595 pg/ml) and JEV Nakayama (1,151 Ϯ 595 pg/ml) challenges (values are means Ϯ standard deviations [SD]) (Fig. 5) . Although IFN-3 mRNA was upregulated in a few samples, neither of the JEV strains induced a statistically significant increase in expression for this gene at the investigated time points, suggesting an impact of JEV infection on the IFN pathway response (Fig.  4C ). It has been described that suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), a negative regulator of IFN responses, is upregulated in cells infected by JEV (36) . Interestingly, 48 to 72 hpi both JEV strains induced a significant upregulation of SOCS1 in NEC, with higher gene expression in Laos-infected cells (Fig. 4D) . JEV infection of NEC induces chemokines mediating monocyte recruitment. Considering that the establishment of innate immune responses by virus-infected cells may also involve the production of chemokines responsible for the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, we measured the gene expression of several chemokines in JEV-infected porcine NEC (Fig. 6 ). mRNA expression levels of CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10 were significantly upregulated by the virus at 48 and 72 hpi compared to those in mock controls ( Fig. 6A to C). Nevertheless, for CCL2, only JEV Laos induced a significant mRNA upregulation at 48 hpi (Fig. 6A) . CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10 have been described as important chemokines for monocyte recruitment (37) (38) (39) . Consequently, we determined the monocyte chemoattractant . The experiment was repeated three times in duplicate. Data are shown as 25% to 75% interquartile boxes with means and 95% confidence intervals. Different superscript letters indicate significant difference (P Ͻ 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama, respectively); differences between distinct JEV strains and the mock control at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks (*, P Յ 0.05; **, P Յ 0.002; ***, P Յ 0.001). activity of basolateral medium collected from JEV-infected NEC at 72 hpi (Fig. 6D ). We observed that medium from Laos strain-infected NEC induced a significant increase of porcine monocyte migration (Fig. 6D ). supernatants were collected and IL-8 levels were determined by ELISA. The experiment was repeated three times in duplicate. Data are shown as 25% to 75% interquartile boxes with means and 95% confidence intervals. Different superscript letters indicate significant difference (P Ͻ 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama, respectively); differences between distinct JEV strains and the mock control at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks (*, P Յ 0.05; **, P Յ 0.002; ***, P Յ 0.001).
