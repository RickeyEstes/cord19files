An overview of studies and the monkey groups are depicted in Fig. 1 . Study 1. Microbial translocation, colon histology, and microbiome of healthy young (n = 9) and old monkeys (n = 10). Subject's health characteristics are shown in Supplementary Table S1 . Old monkeys were in good health but had weight redistribution leading to a higher waist circumferences, however values are all within the normal, non-obese range for this species and this specific population 21 . Chow consumption was assessed in a separate cohort of age-matched young (n = 22) and old monkeys (n = 11). The monkeys were sourced from the same vervet colony and showed no significant differences in daily intake (104 vs. 104 g/day, p = 0.33). MT rates in old monkeys were significantly elevated as portal vein endotoxin levels, a direct measure of translocated Gram-negative bacterial product, had a distribution that indicated higher amounts in the blood draining the gut and travelling to the liver ( Fig. 2A) . Accordingly LBP-1, which is produced in the liver as a result of endotoxin exposure, was nearly five-fold higher in old monkeys ( Fig. 2B ; p < 0.05 for both endotoxin and LBP-1). sCD14 levels were not different between young and old monkeys in this cohort (845 vs 734 µg/mL; p = 0.73). The histostructure of the colon did not differ with age (Table 1) . Innate immune responses, measured as circulating secretory IgA and antimicrobial peptide, α-defensin 5, were both greater in old monkeys by 16% and 25% respectively (p < 0.05 for both), consistent with responses to a leakier gut (Fig. 3A,B) . Mucosal samples from old monkeys had higher DNA content (Fig. 4A ). Microbial abundance on the mucosal surface trended higher in old monkeys (Fig. 4B ,C). Average bacterial DNA sequence depth after amplification was higher in older monkeys (34% greater), consistent with the greater bacterial loads in mucosal scrapings seen by qPCR. While none of these measures are perfect indicators of total bacterial number, together they support a hypothesis of higher loads on the aged colon mucosa. Goblet cells produce protective mucus which physically separates bacteria from the cells of the gut barrier and an inverse relationship between the bacterial abundance and goblet cells was also observed (Fig. 4D ). There were no differences by age grouping in the amount of mucus detected within goblet cells of the colon ( Table 1 ). The microbiome profiles across the 3 sampling sites were not significantly different between the young and old monkeys, which was expected based on the consistent diet and our prior evaluations from the same colony ( Fig. 4D ; Supplementary Tables S2-S4) 10 . Diversity of microbiome profiles differed by sampling location, with the mucosa being significantly less diverse than the feces or colon lumen content at the phylum level (p < 0.001 and p = 0.004 respectively after post-hoc Tukey's honest significant difference test; Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Similarly, there were no statistically significant associations between the relative abundances of individual taxa and the numeric age or the age group of the monkeys at a false discover rate of 0.05. Supplementary Table S6 . Six young and 6 old monkeys transitioned to a Western diet (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6 ) for 8 weeks, while 6 additional old monkeys stayed on the chow diet after baseline assessments to control for changes over time. At the end of the diet challenge old monkeys exhibited significantly elevated liver enzymes, plasma cholesterol, and glucose values, whereas young monkeys consuming the Western diet and old monkeys remaining on chow were unaffected (Fig. 5 ). Healthy old monkeys went from having normal to impaired fasting glucose values (>100 mg/dL fasting glucose). Five of the 6 old monkeys were available to re-evaluate ALT values 8 weeks after return to the healthy chow diet, and notably ALT remained significantly elevated in 3 of the 5 animals ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). This indicated that old monkeys are both less resilient to the nutritional stress of a diet challenge, and individuals are susceptible to persistent hepatitis. Cholesterol increased in both young and old monkeys consuming the Western diet, but more than doubled in value from baseline in the old monkeys (p < 0.001) as compared to more nominal changes in young monkeys (p > 0.05) (Fig. 5B ). MT markers were measured in Western diet-fed monkeys and they did not further increase in old monkeys, while young monkeys' values did not change significantly in response to the 8-week diet challenge (Supplementary Table S7 ). We did not measure the microbiome, as prior diet studies have shown this intervention is not long enough to enable the detection of stable changes in fecal profiles with this number of subjects 4, 22 . Study 3. Serum Bovine Immunoglobulin (SBI) therapy in old Western diet-fed monkeys. Old monkeys (n = 6) were given placebo or 6 g/day of SBI daily added to 80 g of their daily food allotment for 2 weeks in a cross-over study, with 4 weeks of washout between treatment periods. There was with 100% compliance in all monkeys orally consuming the SBI doses, verified by direct observation of dose consumption. No changes in food intake or fecal characteristics were observed. SBI was not effective (Table 2) in changing health related parameters after 2 weeks of dosing. MT markers remained high as did hepatic and metabolic markers.
