Differential mRNA expressions of molecules in JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways iDCs were prepared from monocytes purified from peripheral blood by induction with GM-CSF and IL-4. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that 90.8% and 92.9% of DCs were positive for CD80 and CD11c, respectively, and only 3.5% and 6.8% of cells were positive for CD3 and CD83, respectively, confirming that they were indeed iDCs. At 1/2 h, 2 h, 8 h and 24 h p.i., iDCs were collected and the expressions of molecules in JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways were examined by PCR arrays. The results showed that the mRNA levels of MEK3/6, MEK4/7, JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, and p38 MAPK(α/β) were upregulated by 2.02 -3.08 -fold at different times of EV71 p.i. in different time, while c-Jun and c-Fos were increased by 3.03 to 9.17 -fold. In addition, the mRNA levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α, and IFN-β were upregulated by 2.24 -4.32 -fold at different times of EV71 p.i. (Table 1) .
