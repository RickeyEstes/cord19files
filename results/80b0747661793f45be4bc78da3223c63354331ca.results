RCA was used to identify 62 strains belonging to eight species causing human eumycetoma. Since black grain eumycetoma species are known to be phylogenetically distant, it is easy to find unique sites for their identification. The ribosomal ITS region was sufficient for identification of all species and showed no intraspecific variability within a set of 100 M. mycetomatis strains in our collection. For M. mycetomatis, M. tropicana, M. pseudomycetomatis, and F. senegalensis the ITS1 region was
