Initially, mink sera were examined in IFAT using acetone fixed monolayers of secondary swine kidney cells infected with TGEV as substrate and FITCconjugated protein-A to detect specific binding of antibodies to TGEV. Of 71 sera collected during 1990 for routine testing of ADV antibodies, 68 were found to contain TGEV cross-reacting antibodies in IFAT at a dilution of 1 / 2. The pattern of fluorescence was most often diffusely cytoplasmic and very similar to that seen with sera from FIPV-infected cats. The serological data on mink sera have been summarized in Table 1 . All of 23 sera from a farm showing high neonatal mortality contained TGEV cross-reacting antibodies in IFAT at a dilution of 1/2. These sera represented adult females as well as 6 months old male and female kits. Also, all of 17 sera from experimental animals were positive in IFAT for TGEV cross-reacting antibodies. Sera obtained during 1981-1988 were titrated in TGEV PLA and 31 of 41 samples were positive with titres ranging from 5 to 320. Positive samples were evenly distributed over the years with no obvious time-clustering. Due to cytotoxicity some of the sera included in this study could not be examined in neutralizatioti test. All of the 17 sera originating from experimental animals were tested in neutralization tests against TGEV and PRCV (initial dilution 1 / 10), CCV, FIPV and FECV (initial dilution 1/5 ) and none of the sera neutralized any of these viruses. Furthermore, 20 sera ( 13/20 positive by PLA) tested against TGEV and PRCV and 16 sera ( 16/16 positive by PLA or IFAT) tested against FIPV and FECV were also negative for neutralizing antibodies. A high-titered mink antiserum and representative high-titered antisera against TGEV, PRCV, CCV, FIPV and PEDV were selected for further studies of the serological relationship of the putative mink coronavirus to other coronaviruses. These sera were used to develop western blots of TGEV, CCV and PEDV. It should be noted, that antisera to CCV and FIPV are field sera and not homologous to the strains applied in this study. It is apparent, that antisera against TGEV, PRCV, CCV and MCV all react strongly with all three major structural proteins S (200K), M (27K) and N (47K) of TGEV (Fig. 1) . A fourth polypeptide (14-15K) is revealed by antiserum to TGEV only. In contrast, FIPV antiserum reacts primarily with N and M of TGEV. Antiserum against PEDV reacts weakly with S and N of TGEV. A similar pattern was found when using CCV instead of TGEV as antigen (Fig. 2) except that staining of the S protein was only evident with CCV antiserum. In parallel experiments weak staining of the S protein of CCV has been observed with TGEV, PRCV and MCV antisera (not shown). Antiserum against PEDV reacts with S, M (28K) and N (55K) of PEDV whereas antisera against TGEV, PRCV, CCV and FIPV barely reacts with N of PEDV (Fig. 3 ) . Mink antiserum occupies an intermediate position in that there is a distinct reaction with both M and N of PEDV. By cross-neutralization TGEV, PRCV, CCV, FIPV and FECV were found to be very similar, all being neutralized by antisera to TGEV, PRCV and CCV (Table 2) . On the other hand antisera to FIPV, PEDV and MCV did not neutralize any of the viruses. In particular, antiserum to FIPV did not neutralize the strains of FIPV and FECV applied in this study. Neutralization of PEDV was not attempted, due to the extreme dependance of replication on trypsin. The reactivity of these sera was also tested in PLA against TGEV, FECV/ FIPV and PEDV (Table 3 ). The titres of antisera against TGEV, PRCV and CCV are higher against TGEV and FECV/FIPV than against PEDV. Antiserum against FIPV and MCV are broadly reacting with TGEV, FECV/FIPV and PEDV whereas antiserum against PEDV reacts strongly with the homologous virus and only weakly with FECV.
