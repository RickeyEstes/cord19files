Large-volume electron microscopy resolves RO ultrastructure during enterovirus infection. To assess the resolving power of SBF-SEM on enterovirus-infected cell ultrastructure, Vero E6 cells were infected with coxsackie B virus 3 (CVB3) and fixed at 6 h postinfection (hpi). Our previous studies with electron tomography showed that enterovirus ROs with different morphologies (i.e., single-membrane tubules, doublemembrane vesicles, and multilamellar vesicles) are present at this time point. After fixation, cells were prepared and imaged by SBF-SEM along with mock-infected cells for comparison. These data revealed expansive fields of ROs in infected cells, which dominated a large volume of the cell cytoplasm ( Fig. 1A ; see also Movie S1 in the supplemental material). Although the individual membranes of single-and doublemembrane ROs were not resolvable by SBF-SEM under the imaging conditions used, single-membrane ROs (white arrowheads) were distinguishable from doublemembrane (hatched arrowheads) or multilamellar (black arrowheads) ROs by the apparent thickness of the stained membrane (Fig. 1A, left) . To support this interpretation, SBF-SEM images were compared with higher-resolution TEM images collected from the same type of samples ( Fig. S1A and B) , confirming that enterovirus ROs were discernible in the SBF-SEM data. Cellular organelles like the ER, lipid droplets, cis-Golgi cisternae, and trans-Golgi network, could be unambiguously identified in SBF-SEM reconstructions of mock-infected cells through comparisons with TEM images (Fig. S1C ). In infected cells, prominent cellular organelles, like the nucleus, ER, and mitochondria, were also identified (highlighted in Fig. 1A , right). While Golgi cisternae were absent throughout these infected cell volumes, Golgi cisternae were clearly visible in all mock cell volumes assessed (n ϭ 13). These whole-cell visualizations confirm that Golgi apparatus cisternae disintegrate during enterovirus infection, as was previously inferred from live-cell imaging studies monitoring Golgi markers across infection, and two-dimensional (2D) ultrastructural data at early and late infection time points (12, 17, 19, 22) . In order to obtain quantitative insights into the abundance and volumes of enterovirus ROs at this stage of infection, the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of the viral ROs was highlighted by manual segmentation of the RO regions, nucleus, and the cytoplasm in two reconstructed cells, A and B (Fig. 1B) . CVB3-induced RO clusters accounted for large parts of the cytoplasmic volume, at 16% of in cell A (104 m 3 ) and 6% in cell B (37 m 3 ). The difference likely reflects a more advanced infection stage in cell A, which is supported by the appearance of extensive ER dilation (Fig. 1A ) characteristic of later stages of enterovirus infection (12, 23) . The nanometer resolution achievable by SBF-SEM allowed RO clusters in close proximity to be segmented apart to analyze their size distribution (Fig. 1C) . For both cells, most ROs were not homogeneously distributed across the cytosol but instead accumulated in a single large cluster (bright green segmented volumes, 98 m 3 in cell A and 27 m 3 in cell B) proximal to the nucleus. Most of the remaining ROs could be found in relatively small clusters (colored), with more than 90% of these clusters smaller than 0.1 m 3 in both cells (Fig. 1C) . Enterovirus RO biogenesis occurs at distinct ER-or trans-Golgi networkderived foci. Our previous live-cell imaging data demonstrated that the onset of Golgi apparatus disintegration in CVB3 infection is concomitant with the accumulation of viral protein (e.g., 3A) in the Golgi region (19, 21) . Intriguingly, the first foci of 3A protein Sites of Enterovirus Replication Organelle Biogenesis ® arise in the cell periphery, often ahead of the dramatic 3A accumulation in the Golgi region that expands to dominate the cell cytoplasm as infection progresses (Movie S2, white and black arrowheads, respectively). It is unknown whether both the peripheral and Golgi-proximal 3A foci that emerge during this phase represent developing ROs. One possibility is that the small peripheral 3A foci that form early in infection are replication independent and that these 3A accumulations are merely the result of translation of the incoming vRNA delivered by uncoating of virus particles. To test this, we inhibited vRNA synthesis by treating infected cells with guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) and monitored these cells by live-cell imaging. The CVB3 3A was visualized by utilizing a split-GFP system (21) . Neither peripheral nor any other 3A-GFP signal emerged under GuHCl inhibition, demonstrating that their formation is not a product of translation of only incoming vRNA but depends upon vRNA replication (Fig. S2 ). Next, we investigated whether virus-induced membrane structures could be detected at both peripheral and Golgi-associated 3A foci. To do so, we imaged living cells expressing mCherry-GM130, a cis-Golgi marker, and infected them with CVB3 encoding split-GFP-tagged 3A (21) . Confocal z-stacks were collected of cells with emerging 3A-GFP signal but at different stages of Golgi disassembly (ϳ5 hpi), which were then fixed and prepared for SBF-SEM. Acquired SBF-SEM volumes were manually segmented to highlight Golgi cisternae and RO clusters based solely on morphological features, which could then be compared with 3D reconstructions of corresponding confocal data ( Fig. 2A , workflow illustrated in Movie S3). A striking correspondence was found between 3A-GFP foci in the confocal data and the location of ROs highlighted by the SBF-SEM segmentation, although in some cases, a shift in the relative positions of 3A-GFP foci and RO clusters was apparent (e.g., hatched arrowheads, Fig. 2A ). This may be explained by migration of RO clusters in the delay between confocal z-stack acquisition and fixation (ca. 10 min for CLEM data sets), as peripheral 3A-GFP foci are often dynamic (Movie S2, hatched arrowheads).
