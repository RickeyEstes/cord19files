The PrP-specific Mabs that were evaluated for their ability to prevent PrP C to PrP Sc conversion have linear epitopes that span the entire prion protein from the amino to the carboxy terminus ( Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). We used N2a cells persistently infected with the 22L mouseadapted scrapie strain (N2a/22L) to evaluate the affect of each Mab on PrP Sc formation ( Fig. 2A and 2B) . Treatment with the Mabs did not result in any cytotoxicity to the N2a/22L cells throughout the incubation period. Further, incubation of the. N2a/22L cells with 10 mg/ml purified, irrelevant mouse IgG had no effect on PrP Sc formation compared to untreated N2a/22L cultures (Figs. 2A and 2B). Mab 3F4 did not reduce PrP Sc formation compared to control N2a/22L cultures lacking Mab. Mab 3F4 does not react with mouse prion protein so this was not surprising [38] . The ability of a singly added Mab to inhibit PrP Sc formation was not related to a specific epitope since all of the remaining singly added Mabs inhibited PrP Sc formation to varying degrees. Of the individually added Mabs, 5D6 was the most effective at inhibiting PrP Sc formation (95% inhibition) while 3A2 was the least effective (38% inhibition). Targeting the amino terminus with Mab 7E4 was effective at inhibiting 73% PrP Sc formation as was targeting the octapeptide repeat region using Mab 10E4 which resulted in almost 90% inhibition. Strangely, although their epitopes overlap, Mab 11F12 was less effective than Mab 5D6 at inhibiting PrP Sc formation (53% vs 95% inhibition). This is in contrast to Mabs 8E9 and 1B11, which have overlapping epitopes with 8E9 being more expansive, and resulted in 52% and 42% inhibition, respectively. The combination of 5D6 and 11F12 did not result in an additive inhibitory effect and, in fact, resulted in less inhibition than either one alone. This was confirmed in studies where the addition of 8E9 to 5D6 and 11F12 caused a 45% PrP Sc inhibition, which was slightly better than 8E9 alone, although the predicted additive inhibitory effect of 63% for the three Mab combination (48% for 8E9 plus 15% for the 5D6 and 11F12 combination) was not observed. Studies were performed with PMCA to determine whether a cell-free system can recapitulate the effect of Mabs on PrP C conversion observed in infected cells. This system also allowed us to evaluate whether accessibility of Mab to membrane associated PrP C in the living cells influences the PrP C to PrP Sc conversion process. Mabs (12-50 mg/ml final concentration) were added throughout the sPMCA 40 protocol along with the 10% NBH spiked with a 10 24 dilution of 263K infected brain homogenate as described in the Methods section. This dilution of infected brain homogenate does not result in detectable PK resistant PrP Sc immunostaining (Fig. 3A) and, therefore, did not interfere with the detection of newly formed PrP Sc . At the completion of sPMCA 40 , the samples were digested with PK (100 mg/ml) and analyzed on immunoblots using biotinylated Mab 2F11 which reacts equally with both hamster PrP C and PrP Sc . It is interesting to note that although the 263K-infected brain homogenate displayed the 3 band pattern typical for the multiple glycosylated forms of PrP C and PrP Sc (Fig. 3A) , the sPMCA 40 products in the positive controls and Mab-treated reactions consisted of only a single diglycosylated 30 kDa PrP Sc band observed after PK digestion at the higher levels of inhibition, .50%, but had two bands or a smear when there was less inhibition (Fig. 3B) . PMCA in the presence of Mabs was also used to study the importance of binding site specificity in the PrP C to PrP Sc conversion process (Fig. 3) . We performed sPMCA with different Mab concentrations to determine the minimum amount of Mab necessary to inhibit the conversion process. Using a 10 24 dilution of 263K-infected hamster brain homogenate as the PrP Sc seed and a 10% normal brain homogenate (NBH) as the source of PrP C , we tested the ability of Mabs to inhibit the conversion of PrP C to PrP Sc . For each Mab, final concentrations of 12 mg/ml (lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24), 25 mg/ml (lanes 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22 and 25) and 50 mg/ml (lanes 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, and 26) were prepared in hamster NBH and used in the sPMCA reactions. Compared to sPMCA 40 , which contained no Mab (lane 1) and with the exception of 02-3/3A2, the majority of the PrP-specific Mabs inhibited the conversion process in a dose-related manner although some were more effective than others. Mabs 7E4, 10E4, 11F12, 8E11, and 8E9 completely inhibited the conversion process at 50 mg/ml while Mabs 1B11 and 2F7 inhibited the conversion process to a lesser degree. The inhibition caused by the Mabs was a specific response since sPMCA 40 studies replacing Mabs with purified normal mouse IgG (at 12-50 mg/ml) in the 10% NBH did not cause any inhibition of PrP Sc formation (data not shown). It is interesting to note that, with the exception of only 8E9, the epitopes for all the Mabs that caused complete inhibition are located in the amino half of the PrP while those that caused incomplete inhibition are located in the carboxy half of PrP. There was good correlation between the extent of PrP Sc inhibition when 10 mg/ml Mab in cell culture was compared to 12 mg/ml Mab with sPMCA 40 . A separate study using sPMCA 40 demonstrated that Mabs 3F4 and 5D6 caused complete inhibition of PrP Sc formation at 12-50 mg/ml (Fig. 4) . Therefore we extended those studies and evaluated the effects of Mabs 3F4 and 5D6 using a wider range of Mab concentrations (1.5-50 mg/ml). Compared to the other antibodies in this study, Mabs 3F4 and 5D6 had the most pronounced effects on PrP Sc formation as demonstrated by the low concentrations of 3 and 6 mg/ml, respectively, causing complete inhibition (Fig. 4) . The potent inhibitory effect of 5D6 on PrP Sc observed using sPMCA 40 coincides with its dramatic effect in the N2a/22L culture model. Furthermore, the poor PrP Sc inhibition by 3A2 with sPMCA 40 (Fig. 3B) corresponded well with the poor inhibition (only 32% reduction compared to negative control) observed in the cell culture system ( Fig. 2A  and 2B ).
