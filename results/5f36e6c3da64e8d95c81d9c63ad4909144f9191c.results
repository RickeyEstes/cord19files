More than half of the patients (132/246, 53.6%) were less than one year of age, and almost one half of the remaining children, whose age was recorded (40/83, 48.1%), were under two years of age (Table 1) . Respiratory tract viruses were detected in 189 (77%) of the 246 children. The overall rate of virus positivity was similar in children less than 1 year of age (102/132, 77.3%), between 1 and 2 years (32/40, 80.0%), and above 2 years of age (33/43, 76.7%) and slightly lower among the 13% of children whose age was not recorded (22/31, 71.0%). The most frequently detected virus groups, both found in about one third of the children each, were HRV and PIV, with type 3 of PIV being the most prevalent serotype in the latter group (Table 1) . Adenoviruses, influenza virus C, hMPV, and HBoV were also found in considerable numbers. Influenza virus types A and B and RSV were detected less frequently. Seven specimens tested positive for HEV and negative for HRV ("true HEV"), whereas 16 other additional specimens yielded a positive result by the HEV and the HRV test. While the overall proportion of virus-positive specimens was similar in children aged under or over two years, as well as in the group with unrecorded age, all adenovirus, influenza virus A, RSV, and all but one HBoV and "true HEV" detections were in the youngest age group (Table 1) . Altogether 224 virus findings were obtained from the 246 children, if only those HEV-positive results were accounted where the same specimen was negative in the HRV test ("true HEV"). The number of findings was 240 if all positive test results for HEV were included. Twenty-nine specimens contained two different viruses and another two specimens three different viruses. No obvious pattern could be seen in the mutual associations of two or three viruses (Table 2) . However, there were more multiple infections in children older than 2 years than in the younger than 2 years group (33% versus 9% of children, P = 0.0001 (2-sample t-test for equality of proportions), data not shown.
