The average monthly number of outpatient visits at base year was 52317 ± 4204. The numbers for the year SARS that happened and the following two years were 55% (28950 ± 11731), 82% (42906 ± 4047) and 84% (43715 ± 2758) of the base year respectively (Table 1) . Average emergency numbers was 4382 ± 356 visits per month at base year. This number decreased to 45% (1975 ± 1242) of the base year for the year SARS happened, and came back to 77% (3395 ± 345) during the first year after SARS, and 87% (3824 ± 346) of the base year during the second year after SARS. The average inpatient service volume was 8520 ± 909 inpatient days per month at base year. The number decreased to 43% (3678 ± 2350) of base year for the year SARS happened, and came back to 81% (6863 ± 486) and 87% (7371 ± 471) of the base year for the following two years. Only the emergency service volumes recovered to the level of non-significant difference at the second year after SARS. Services volumes for outpatients and inpatients were still significant different (p < 0.05). Using the pre-SARS year as the training dataset in the ARIMA model, the ARIMA IAR (2,1,0) model was the most suitable. Similar result about the delayed recovery of outpatient services is noted (figure 1). The MAPE of the ARIMA (2,1,0) model for the pre-SARS year was 6.94%. The MAPE for the year of SARS was 43.24%, improving to 10.58% for the 1 st post-SARS year, and to 6.20% for the 2 nd post-SARS year. On examining the various outpatient departments, family medicine, metabolism and nephrology recovered during the year that SARS happened. Family medicine was even higher than the base year during the first and second years after SARS. Nephrology was also higher than the base year during the second year after SARS. The departments that recovered during the first year after SARS included neurology, cardiology, infectious diseases, neurosurgery, urology, plastic surgery, dentistry and psychiatry. Among these, psychiatry was even higher than the base year. Pediatrics recovered during the second year after SARS. The departments that still have not recovered include general surgery, ophthalmology, orthopedics, ENT, internal medicine, pulmonary medicine, gastroenterology, OBS/GYN, dermatology, rehabilitation and Chinese medicine ( Table  2 ). The numbers of physicians were 165 for the base year, 162 for the SARS year, 170 for the first year after SARS, and 173 for the second year after SARS. The numbers of physicians in each department were also similar for these years with differences ranging from 0 to 2 physicians.
