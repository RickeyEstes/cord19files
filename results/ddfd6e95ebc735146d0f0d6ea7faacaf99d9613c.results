We are interested in investigating the extent of perturbation of model membranes caused by a functional concentration of the peptides, i.e, peptide concentration that is already known to promote fusion of model membranes. At this concentration, what are the changes in the structural dynamics, curvature and hydration of the lipids and in the thermodynamic parameters of the membranes that lead to membrane fusion? It has been shown that SARS FP and SARS IFP are able to induce membrane fusion only at high peptide-to-lipid molar ratio 15, 22 . Thus, we chose a 20:1 lipid/peptide molar ratio for most of the experiments and compared the effects of the peptides on model membranes that present very different physicochemical properties.
