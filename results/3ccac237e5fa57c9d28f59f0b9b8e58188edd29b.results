RNAi screening of DDX RNA helicases points to DDX19 as a factor required for efficient IAV multiplication. A targeted RNAi screen was performed to identify human DDX proteins involved in IAV multiplication. Small interfering RNAs targeting 35 DDX proteins (Table S1 ) were transfected in A549 cells. For DDX2A/DDX2B, DDX19A/DDX19B and DDX39A/DDX39B, siRNAs targeting the A and B forms were used alone or in combination. Anti-Nup62 siRNAs, known to inhibit IAV replication 29, 30 , were used as a control. The toxicity of siRNA treatment and the silencing efficiency were evaluated as described in the Methods section. No reduction of the cell viability signal was measured compared to control siRNA-treated cells, except in cells silenced for DDX2A, DDX2A + B, DDX39A + B and DDX48 ( Figure S1a ). Efficient silencing (> 70% decrease of the protein expression signal) was achieved for most DDX proteins except for DDX2B, 13, 18, 20, 31 and 52 (16% to 69% decrease) ( Figure S1b ). A549 cells were transfected with each of the non-toxic siRNAs and subsequently infected at a low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) with a recombinant A/WSN/33 virus carrying a luciferase reporter gene (WSN-PB2-Nanoluc). Luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates prepared at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) to monitor the efficiency of viral replication. As shown in Fig. 1a , IAV replication was significantly impaired upon silencing of 14 DDX proteins: DDX3X, DDX5, DDX13, DDX17, DDX19A, DDX19B, DDX24, DDX25, DDX28, DDX31, DDX39B, DDX41, DDX46 and DDX47. Among the DDX proteins that had been previously found to positively regulate IAV replication, DDX3X, DDX5 and DDX17 19 and DDX39B 15 were recovered in our screen, but not DDX2B, possibly due to low knock-down efficiency ( Figure S1b ). DDX21 silencing, shown by others to negatively regulate IAV replication 14 , had no significant effect in our screen. Upon co-silencing of DDX19 A and B forms (96% identity at the protein level), the reduction of luciferase signal was significantly greater than upon silencing of DDX19A or DDX19B alone (a 90% reduction compared to 48% and 59%, respectively, Fig. 1a) , indicating a synergistic effect of DDX19A and DDX19B depletion. We repeated the experiment with three individual siRNAs targeting conserved regions between DDX19A and DDX19B (Fig. 1b,c) . A strong 76 to 90% reduction of the luciferase signal was observed with all three individual siRNAs (Fig. 1b) , thus ruling out any off-target effect. In the experiments described below, the combination of DDX19A and DDX19B siRNAs (thereafter named DDX19 siRNAs) was used. The effect of DDX19 knock-down on the multiplication of several wild-type IAV was then examined. A549 cells treated with DDX19 or control siRNAs were infected at low m.o.i. and the production of infectious viral particles was evaluated at 24, 48 and 72 hpi for A/WSN/33 (WSN, Fig. 1d ), and at 24 hpi for the other strains ( Fig. 1e ). At all time points, the WSN virus titers in the supernatant of DDX19-silenced cells were decreased by 2-4 log compared to control cells (Fig. 1d ). At 24 hpi, similar reductions were observed upon infection with the Scientific RepoRts | 6:33763 | DOI: 10.1038/srep33763 The results are expressed as the mean percentages ± SEM of luciferase activity relative to the non-target siRNA condition, and the significance was tested with a Holm-Sidak's multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism software (**p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001). (c) At 48 hours post-transfection (hpt) with the control non-target siRNAs (C) or with individual siRNAs targeting DDX19A+ B (#1, #2 and #3), the levels of DDX19 protein were evaluated by immunoblot using an antibody that recognizes both A and B forms of DDX19, and the levels of DDX19A and DDX19B mRNAs were determined by RT-qPCR and were expressed as percentages of the control. Cropped blots are shown. The corresponding full-length blots are shown in Figure S2 . hpi (e), the viral titers were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells (d-f) or immunostaining (g). The results are expressed as the mean ± SEM of triplicates and the significance was tested with an unpaired, 2-tailed Student t test using GraphPad Prism software (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001). (Fig. 1f) , a negative-stranded RNA virus from the Rhabdoviridae family that replicates in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the production of infectious Adenovirus 5, a double-stranded DNA virus from the Adenoviridae family, was decreased by 1-log upon DDX19 depletion (Fig. 1g ). These results confirm that DDX19 is essential for IAV multiplication, and suggest its potential implication in the life cycle of other viruses that replicate in the nucleus.
