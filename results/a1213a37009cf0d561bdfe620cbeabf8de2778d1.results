To study the structure of the spike-ACE2 complex, we infected Vero E6 cells with SARS-CoV and purified supernatant virus by iodoxanol density gradient centrifugation. Previously, we have shown that specimens could be c-irradiated with a sufficient dose (2Mrad) for viral inactivation, while still preserving protein antigenicity. Inactivation was verified by passage in cell culture and testing by quantitative PCR [29] . Purified c-irradiated SARS-CoV preparations had a fusogenic activity when added to Vero E6 cells at high multiplicity (,500-3000 virions per cell), causing the formation of syncytia in the absence of replication or cytopathic effects ( Figure 1A ). These syncytia had identical morphology to those observed in cytopathic studies of SARS-CoV in tissues and in tissue cultured cells; syncytia have also been observed upon expression of coronavirus S protein, or following addition of cells expressing the S-protein to cells with surface-expressed ACE2. [22, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . The same inactivated c-irradiated virus preparations were incubated with a human ACE2-human Fc chimeric protein, for analysis of the complex by cryo-EM, 3D image processing, and immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM) ( Figure 1 , Movie S1). The ACE2-Fc construct was selected since it is soluble and dimeric, and it was anticipated that the additional mass was would be beneficial in locating the receptor attached to the spike. Immuno-EM confirmed that recombinant ACE2 protein bound to virions, and that binding affinity was not affected by c-irradiation ( Figure 1B) . We did not observe any structural changes associated with prior irradiation. Image averaging further suppressed any possible random radiation induced structural changes.
