As outlined in the Scenarios Section, the results represent an exploration of how variation in a region's local response capacity, and additional interventions (either health care system support or behavioural modification) affect the controllability of an outbreak. We then use Papua New Guinea as a case study of these scenarios in the context of a specific health care system.
