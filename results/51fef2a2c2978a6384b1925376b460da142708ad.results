The demographic and epidemiologic characteristics of the 3 patients with confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009, including the estimated disease incubation period and their travel histories, are listed in Table 1 . Their clinical characteristics are shown in Table 2 . All 3 patients were Chinese students who had been studying abroad (2 in United States and 1 in Canada Table 3 ). The dynamic virologic monitoring of pharyngeal swab samples from the 3 case-patients showed that realtime RT-PCR results for influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus were negative on day 5, day 7, and day 6, respectively (Table 3) . Only 1 sample from a total of 186 close contacts tested positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus by real-time RT-PCR. This sample came from the 48-year-old mother of patient 3, who had lived with patient 3 for 2 days before her illness and had taken care of her for 2 days after her illness began. On the fifth day (May 16) after exposure to patient 3, the woman's sample became positive ( Table 3) . As with all the other close contacts, this woman had no fever or ILI symptoms.
