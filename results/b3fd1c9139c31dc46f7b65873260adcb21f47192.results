We initially recruited 387 children; six of them withdrew prior to the completion of the study ( Figure 1 ). A total of 381 children ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ) from 358 families were followed up over 13 weeks from 30 July 2010, at which date children were aged 0Á92-3Á4 years. Of these 381 children, 340 (89%) were recruited through childcare and 41 (11%) were through one GP clinic. In our study, we were unable to estimate the number of parents of potential participants we approached during recruitment. The dates that we attended particular childcare centres were recorded, but because the total number of children attending a centre differed every day of the week, it was impossible to obtain the exact total number of children of the target age group attended each centre. Almost always we spoke to only a subset of those parents because carers might drop off or pick up their children while we were conversing with a few.
