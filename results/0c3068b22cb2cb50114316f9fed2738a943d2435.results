The primary search identified 1723 citations using predefined criteria, of which 1719 references were from electronic databases, other 4 references were identified from relevant reference lists, and no references were obtained from conference proceedings or dissertation abstracts. Finally, a total of 17 studies [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] from electronic databases were included in this review.

Table 2 shows the characteristics of 17 identified trials. All eligible studies were carried out in China and were published in Chinese. The mean sample size of these studies was 57 with a range from 25 to 110. All participants were ≥18 years with ARF due to acute exacerbations of COPD. Male approximately accounted for half of the total patients in each study. No dropouts were observed in these studies. AECOPD diagnostic criteria were based on Guidelines of Diagnosis and Treatment of COPD (Revised 2002 (Revised , 2007 (Revised , 2010 and Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of COPD (Revised 2011). The PIC window was selected as timing for replacing invasive ventilation with noninvasive support among these trials. Ventilator modes were various in the included studies.
