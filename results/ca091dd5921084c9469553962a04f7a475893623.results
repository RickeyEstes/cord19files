Between April 2009 and November 2015, rhinoviruses and adenoviruses were present throughout the year. Rhinoviruses were present most days of the year (84.7%), followed by adenovirus which was present on 52.3% of the days. RSV (36.4%), HMPV (32.8%) and IAV (32.7%) were present in around 1/3 rd of the year. HPIV-3 was present in 24.6% of days, followed by HPIV-1 (15.5%) and IBV (15.2%). HPIV-2 was present for the fewest number of days (6.5%) ( Table 1) . Children ≤10 accounted for 45% of the number of samples tested. The age groups of those tested are in Table 2 . Figures 1-3 plot the weather conditions and the virus prevalence during the study period. Mean air temperature ( Fig. 1) showed the expected seasonality, with a peak in July (14 °C to 16 °C) and a trough in January (−1 °C to 4 °C). Mean dew point (Fig. 1 ) and the variation in humidity within a day (i.e. "humidity-range", Fig. 3 ) showed a similar pattern. Mean dew point was highest in August (10 °C to 12 °C) and lowest in February (−2 °C to 3 °C). "Humidity-range" was larger in the summer months (40% to 44%), and least variable in winter (15% to 18%). Mean relative humidity however showed the opposite pattern, typically highest in December (88% to 91%) and lowest in June (70% to 74%). Air pressure, wind speed and duration of daylight did not show clear seasonality (data not shown). Many viruses have a definite seasonality (Figs 1-3 ). RSV and IAV have the largest seasonal peaks, appearing in November-December and December-January respectively. IBV (February-March), HMPV (March), and HPIV-3 (April-May) follow sequentially. IBV has a biennial distribution occurring every other year. HPIV-2 has two peaks, a major peak around October-November and a minor peak in July. A clear seasonality is not noticeable for HPIV-1. Adenovirus and rhinovirus are present throughout the year. Rhinovirus also has two peaks, a major peak around October-November and a minor peak in March. Adenovirus has a smaller peak in March-April. Temperature appears to have the greatest effect on viral seasonality (Fig. 1) . The average temperature during the study was 9.2 °C. In keeping with their year-round presence, the mean temperature when adenovirus and rhinovirus are present is closer to the annual mean at 8.8 °C and 8.9 °C respectively. A preference for colder temperatures is noticeable for RSV, IAV, and IBV (6.3 °C, 6.7 °C and 6.3 °C respectively). HMPV is most prevalent when the temperature becomes slightly warmer (7.4 °C). HPIV-3 is the only virus to prefer above average temperatures (9.4 °C). The average dew point was 6.0 °C (Fig. 1) . Dew point has a similar pattern of relationship to viruses as temperature, with RSV (3.7 °C), IAV (3.9 °C), IBV (3.3 °C) and HMPV (4.4 °C) preferring lower dew points. In contrast, HPIV-3 prefers a higher dew point (5.9 °C). Temperature and dew point are both significantly lower on days adenovirus, RSV, IAV, IBV, and HMPV are present ( Table 3) . The average relative humidity was 81% over the study period (Fig. 2) . RSV (84%), IAV (82.9%) and HPIV-1(82.6%) prefer higher relative humidity. HPIV-3 is more active when the relative humidity is lower (79.9%) ( Table 3 ). The average variation in humidity within the day (i.e. "humidity-range") was 25%. "Humidity-range" is significantly narrow for most viruses apart from rhinovirus, HPIV-2 and HPIV-3 (Table 3) . RSV (21.8%) and IAV (23.8%) prefer much narrower ranges then other viruses. HPIV-3, in contrast to the other viruses, appears to prefer a wide "humidity-range" (29.7%). Though HPIV-2 seems to prefer raised humidity and a narrow "humidity-range", the difference in these variables between days the HPIV-2 is present or absent is insignificant (Table 3) , potentially a reflection of the lower number of HPIV-2 cases. Table 4 shows the results of the binomial logistic regression carried out to determine the effect of multiple metrological factors on virus activity. It demonstrates how a unit increase in each meteorological variable (either 1 °C for mean temperature, or 1% for mean relative humidity or "humidity-range") alters the odds of a virus being present. Only results that were found to be significant in the t-test were examined using logistic regression (i.e. rhinovirus and HPIV-2 were excluded). Following the logistic regression, no significant association was found for HPIV-1. A mean temperature increase by 1 °C reduces the odds of detecting adenovirus, RSV, IAV, IBV and HMPV. Adenovirus has a small decrease (2.8%), while RSV (17.3%), IAV (13.7%), IBV (13%) and HMPV (9.9%) have larger decreases. A 1% increase in relative humidity reduces the odds of HPIV-3 being present (2.6%). A 1% increase in "humidity-range" also decreases the odds of detecting RSV (3.8%) and IAV (1.7%). Air temperature has a significant effect against the most number of viruses (n = 5) followed by "humidity-range" and relative humidity. The smaller effect of "humidity-range" in comparison to mean temperature may be due to an interrelationship between mean humidity and "humidity-range", since logistic regression takes multiple variables into account. Figure 4a -c are the generalised linear models (GLM), examining each virus' incidence across a year, averaged over the entire study period. This was compared with temperature over the same period. These models confirm a preference for colder temperatures for RSV, IAV and IBV, and the timings of their seasonal peaks in and around 17 th December, 12 th January and 8 th February respectively. Even though rhinovirus and adenovirus are present throughout the year, their GLM's point to periods of increased activity (around the 5 th of March for Adenovirus and around the 6 th November for rhinovirus). The GLM corroborates HPIV-3's preference for warmer temperatures and its seasonal peak around the 4 th of May. Finally, the GLM suggests that HMPV peaks around the 11 th of March, HPIV-1 peaks around the 31 st October, and HPIV-2 peaks around the 15 th of November. From Fig. 4a -c, a rough order of seasonal peaks is noticeable for the different viruses, beginning with IAV in January. After this, there are peaks of IBV in February, HMPV and Adenovirus in March, HPIV-3 in May, HPIV-1 in the end of October, rhinoviruses, and HPIV-2 in November, and ending with RSV in December. Since temperature and humidity appear to have a significant impact on viral incidence when analysed individually, we Table 3 . Comparison of mean meteorological values on the days a virus is detectable or undetectable. CI: Confidence interval, p value from T test. Significant p values in bold. We measured the mean of each meteorological factor on days when we received positive samples for a given virus and on days where we did not receive a positive sample for that virus. Hence a larger difference in means denotes that a virus is commonly present at an extreme of that meteorological factor: e.g. RSV more often being present when temperature is lower. Scientific RepoRts | (2019) 9:929 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37481-y calculated the difference in mean temperature and humidity preferred by the different viruses and arranged them in the order as above (Table 5 ). Figure 5 represents this pattern visually using results from ANOVA. Starting with the seasonal peak of IAV in January, there is a decrease in relative humidity from 82.9% to 81.7% in February, along with a decrease in mean temperature from 6.7 °C to 6.3 °C. These changes are associated with peaks in incidence of IBV. Following this, relative humidity stabilises until March. However, the mean temperature rises significantly to 7.4 °C in March corresponding with the peak in HMPV and then further to 8.8 °C when a peak in adenovirus occurs. Next, there is a further increase in temperature to 9.4 °C along with a significant reduction in relative humidity to 79.9% in May when a peak in HPIV-3 is observed. A slight drop in mean temperature (8.4 °C) and a significant increase in mean relative humidity (82.6%), from May to October is associated with a peak in HPIV-1. With mean temperatures being fairly constant, a further drop in relative humidity (81.6%) is associated with a peak in rhinovirus activity in November. A slight increase in humidity and a drop in temperature in November is associated with the presence of HPIV-2. A dramatic drop in temperature to 6.2 °C and an increase in relative humidity to 84.0%, leads to the peak in RSV in December. Then the cycle begins anew with IAV in January.
