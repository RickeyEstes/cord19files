We analysed 26 infectious diseases using the NIDS and NHICS. We analysed 22 diseases of interest for 90 months of the surveillance period, and the other 4 infectious diseases presented different time frames due to a change in the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act since January 2010: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), HAV, Lyme disease, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). The list of the national notifiable diseases investigated, number of reported and claimed cases, and observation period are presented in Table 1 . The number of claimed cases was more than that reported for the 24 infectious diseases, except enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection and legionellosis. The total R/C ratio of the 26 infectious diseases was 0.43. Given that the ideal R/C ratio is 1.0, the average ratio for cholera was 0.02 and 0.03 for rubella. On the other hand, the R/C ratio of legionellosis was 2.11, and that of EHEC infection was 1.56. The overall annual R/C ratio increased sharply from 0.37 in 2010 to 0.78 in 2017 (Table 2 ). Monthly reported/claimed cases and R/C ratio. We compared the monthly reported/claimed cases and monthly R/C ratios of the 2 surveillance systems based on the 26 infectious diseases. Figure 2 demonstrates 9 infectious diseases; the remaining 17 diseases are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 . Scarlet fever, mumps, and varicella presented a sharp rise in R/C ratio, with the graphs of the monthly cases of the two systems almost identical over time. Particularly, scarlet fever showed a dramatic rise in R/C ratio and varicella presented a decreasing trend of cases in the claim-based surveillance, although an increase was observed in the report-based surveillance, with relatively fast rising R/C ratio. Dengue fever and murine typhus showed a good concordance (R/C ratio between 0.7-1.0) of the 2 surveillance systems, although baseline noises were observed in the claim data. Diseases such as rubella, Q fever, and legionella showed a large R/C ratio variation over time.
