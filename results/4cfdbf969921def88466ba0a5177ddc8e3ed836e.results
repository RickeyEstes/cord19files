All cats were examined for FeLV antigen, and antibodies to FHV, FCV, FPV, FCoV, FeSFV and FIV. They were all negative for FeLV p27 antigen by ELISA, and for antibodies to FHV (<1:20), FCV (<1:20), FPV (<1:25), FCoV (<1:25) and FeSFV (<1:25). Cats of group 1 from which FIV had been re-isolated numerous times (Hofmann- Lehmann et al., 1997) , were positive for antibodies to TM measured by ELISA, while cats of group 2 were ELISA-negative (Table 1) . Cats of group 1 had significantly lower absolute CD4 lymphocyte counts (p0.0025, Fig. 1 ), and significant lower CD4 :CD8 ratio (p0.0043, data not shown) than cats of group 2. Gross visual dental inspection and probing with a dental explorer revealed subgingival resorption in six of 10 FIV-positive cats (group 1) and in only three of the FIVnegative controls of group 2 (Table 2) . Resorptive lesions were confirmed by dental radiographs in one cat and were recognized as radiolucent areas as described (Harvey and Flax, 1992; Harvey, 1993; Berger et al., 1996b) . In addition, ankylosis was demonstrated in some teeth in question. FIV-positive cats had significantly more often gingivae with increased tendency for bleeding upon probing than FIV-negative cats (p0.0055), and they had slightly more often hyperplastic gingivae (p0.0867). In sum, signs characteristic of FORL such as subgingival lesions, granulomatous or easily bleeding or hyperplastic gingiva were found significantly more often in FIV-positive cats (nine of 10) than in the controls (three of 9, p0.0198). Signs of FORL were most frequently found in premolar teeth 3 and 4, to a lesser extent in molar and canine teeth, and not at all in incisor teeth. In addition, teeth were examined for the occurrence of tartar. The extent of tartar was scored for each tooth as strong positive (2), positive (1) or negative (0). Scores of all teeth of one cat were added up to a total tartar score. Surprisingly, FIV-positive cats had significantly lower mean tartar score than FIVnegative cats (p0.0172, Table 2 ). Gingivitis was found in the majority of the FIVpositive cats (90%). This is significantly more often than for FIV-negative cats (p0.0055, Table 2 ). Furthermore, FIV-positive animals suffered slightly more frequently from gingival tissue recession than the controls (p0.867). Gingivae recession was found predominantly at the canine teeth.
