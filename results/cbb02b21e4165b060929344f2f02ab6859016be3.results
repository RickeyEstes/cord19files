There were 400 (31%) respondents, 212 male and 188 female students sampled in 38 schools. Characteristics of respondents, including age, gender and class 4 showed significant variation, p < 0.05; however, there was no significant variation in the religion of respondents. The most predominant student age bracket was 14-17 years, forming 67.8% of the sampled population. We observed wide geographical variations in prevalence rates of communicable diseases among schools with the highest being malaria at 20.7% and the lowest being pneumonia at 5.2% (Fig. 1) . There was significant variation 5 in the prevalence of communicable diseases among secondary schools in Kisumu County. This study found a significant association between the communicable disease prevalence rates and age (X 2 4, 0.05 = 2.458, Fig. 2 ) of students, school size (X 2 12, 0.05 = 18.636, Fig. 3 )/enrollment, gender (X 2 4, 0.05 = 5.723, Fig. 4 ) and class (X 2 12, 0.05 = 15.202, Fig. 5 )/form of student, bed spacing in hostels (X 2 6, 0.05 = 8.21, Fig. 6 ) and desk spacing in classrooms. However, for both the locality and type of school there was no significant association with prevalence rates of communicable diseases. Further analysis using ANOVA showed strong evidence that age has an effect 6 on prevalence rates of communicable diseases among secondary school students. The prevalence rates of tuberculosis and pneumonia were 7.2 and 5.2% in schools where standard bed spacing in hostels was not observed and 0% for other observations. A significant association 12 between bed spacing and prevalence rates of tuberculosis and pneumonia was observed among students; however, there was no strong evidence that the intervention had an effect. Prevalence rates of tuberculosis and pneumonia were high at 4.8 and 5.0%, respectively, in schools where standard desk spacing in classrooms was not observed and almost zero percent in schools that observed standard bed spacing.
