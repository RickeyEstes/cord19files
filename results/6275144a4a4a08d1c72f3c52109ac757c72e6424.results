The database searches found 1415 articles, 1039 of which met the inclusion criteria based on assessment of titles and abstracts and were exported into EndNote. After automatically removing duplicates, 670 articles remained and after manually removing the remainder of the duplicates, 586 articles remained. 586 titles and abstracts were read and categorised based on the above inclusion and exclusion criteria. One study was hand-picked as it met the inclusion criteria, bringing the total number of extracted articles to 587. After screening titles and abstracts, nine articles were classified under incentives in health and medical research. These articles were then read in full, and one of them was judged as an incentive that satisfied the inclusion criteria. The PRISMA [13] flow chart that outlines the journey of the articles from identification to inclusion is in Fig. 1 . The categorisation of all 587 articles into the sub-fields and article type is in Table 1 . A review of the reference list for the one included intervention was undertaken [15] . The titles and abstracts of the full reference list of this study (23 papers) and those that cited the study (5 papers) were read, but none met the inclusion criteria of this systematic review. 17 articles were irrelevant, bringing the total number of screened articles to 570. The distribution of articles across type of study was similar for both health and medical research and non-health and medical research ( Table 1) . Observational studies were the most common type (n = 106, n = 124), then opinion pieces (n = 85, n = 89), then articles testing strategies (n = 76, n = 89), and articles testing incentives were uncommon (n = 1, n = 0).
