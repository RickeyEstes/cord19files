PEDV PC22A-P100C4 and-P120 replicated in the gut but did not cause diseases in weaned pigs All six pigs inoculated with P3 had diarrhea [fecal consistency (FC) score = 2] at 4-5 dpi and one pig had watery diarrhea (FC score = 3) for one day at 4 dpi. Diarrhea lasted for 1 to 4 days and ceased in individual pigs by 5 to 11 dpi (Fig. 1A ). In addition, P3-inoculated pigs did not gain weight (− 0.30 ± 2.67 kg) during the first week (Table 1) . However, the growth retardation did not last after 7 dpi. Conversely, pigs in the other groups had no clinical signs, except that transient mild diarrhea/soft feces were observed in 2 pigs around 1 to 3 dpi when fecal PEDV RNA shedding was around the detection limit or undetectable. The first-week body weight gain profiles post-inoculation were similar among pigs in the P100C4, P120, and mock groups. No fecal PEDV RNA was detected in the pigs of the mock group (Fig. 1B) . In the P3 group, all pigs shed medium-high PEDV RNA amounts (> 8 log 10 copies/ mL) in feces as early as 2 dpi. The mean titers peaked at 10.58 ± 0.99 log 10 copies/mL at 3 dpi but dropped to a mean of 6.00 ± 2.94 at 4 dpi and 5.90 ± 2.69 log 10 copies/ mL at 5 dpi. Afterward, the mean titers peaked (10.81 ± 1.54 copies/mL) again at 6 dpi, decreased gradually and ceased by 19 dpi (11-19 dpi among pigs). Four of six (66.67%) pigs in the P100C4 group began shedding of fecal PEDV RNA at 5 dpi with mean titers of 10-12 log 10 copies/ml, which were also the peak mean viral RNA titers of those pigs. However, the fecal viral RNA shedding was delayed in the fifth pig to 9 dpi and was not detected in the sixth pig. At 6, 9 and 11 dpi, individual pigs in the P100C4 group had low fecal PEDV RNA titers (4.8-7.5 log 10 copies/mL) and stopped shedding by 13 dpi. All pigs in the P120 group shed fecal PEDV RNA with a mean titer peak (11.63 ± 0.41 log 10 copies/mL) at 5 dpi and stopped shedding by 7 dpi.
