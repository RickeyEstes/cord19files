Five of 12 tested bat cell lines are susceptible to MERS-CoV EMC/2012 infection Since lineage C betacoronaviruses closely related to MERS-CoV were detected in bats, we developed 12 diverse primary bat cell lines from seven different bat species, including Hipposideros pomona, Miniopterus pusillus, Myotis ricketti, Pipistrellus abramus (the host of Pi-BatCoV HKU5), Rhinolophus sinicus (the host of SARSr-BatCoV and Rs-BatCoV HKU2), Tylonycteris pachypus (the host of Ty-BatCoV HKU4), Rousettus leschenaultii (the host of many viruses including Ro-BatCoV HKU9), which were subjected to infection with MERS-CoV at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Viral titers were determined by RT-qPCR on day 5 p.i. Five of the 12 cell lines (M. ricketti lung, P. abramus kidney, R. sinicus kidney and lung, and R. leschenaulti kidney cells) and Vero cells propagated MERS-CoV with at least one log 10 increase in viral load. The highest increase in viral load was observed in R. sinicus kidney and lung cells, which was comparable with that observed in Vero cells (Fig. 1 ). Cytopathic effects (CPEs) were observed in infected M. ricketti lung and R. sinicus lung cells with rounding of cells (Fig. 2) . The infectivities of the viruses from culture supernatants were confirmed by passage in Vero cells with CPE. H. pomona kidney, M. pusillus kidney, M. ricketti kidney, P. abramus lung, R. leschenaulti lung, and T. pachypus kidney and lung cells did not support MERS-CoV infection.
