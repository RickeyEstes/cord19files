Out of 36 faecal samples of giant pandas and 97 canine rectal swabs screened by PCR assay using Hfor/Hrev primers, 1 giant panda and 62 dog samples yielded a specific amplicon of 611 bp, respectively. The amplified PCR products of 11 randomly selected canine samples and one giant panda sample were subjected for sequencing using primer pair Hfor/Hrev. Primer pair Hfor/Hrev [11] encompasses informative amino acid residues which are of significance in characterizing the CPV types. All the CPV samples under study were found to be new CPV-2a (CPV-2a with nucleotide variation T→G at position 3675 or CPV-2a with amino acid variation 297-Ser→Ala). In comparison to prototype new-CPV-2a (AY742953), the samples under this study had amino acid residue variations at Tyr324Ile caused by mutation TAT →ATT at nt 3756-3758 of the VP2 gene. It was a unique mutation within the VP2 of Chinese and Korean strains of "new CPV-2a". Critical positions of the CPV VP2 gene products of samples sequenced in this study are summarized in Table 1 . In addition to the nucleotide variations at positions 3675 and 3756, three additional mutations were observed in the canine parvovirus sequences under study. One was at nucleotide position 3584 where a mutation (U→A) resulting in the codon change from UUC→UAC, with amino acid variation 267-Phe→Tyr. All the sequences under this study except B03, B06 and B11 showed this variation. The second one was at nucleotide position 4110, where variation A→G was observed and which changed the codon from ACG→GCG, with amino acid variation 442-Thr→Ala. This variation (A→G) at nucleotide position 4110 was observed in strains A10, A11, A12, B01, B02, B05, B07 and B12 in this study (the dog samples). The last mutation was at nucleotide position 3894 where a mutation (A→G) resulting in the codon change from CAA→CGA, with amino acid variation 370-Gln→Arg. This variation only was revealed in strain B11 (the giant panda sample). To analyse the phylogenetic relationships of the China isolates with other CPV strains isolated in various parts of the world, we constructed a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. The panda field isolate B11 was found to be phylogenetically closely related to new CPV-2a strains of Jilin strain CNJL0804. B06 and B03 are the closest of Chinese dog sequences examined in this study. Rest of the other sequences had distinct lineage but shared molecular relationship with new CPV-2a reference strains ( Figure 1 ).
