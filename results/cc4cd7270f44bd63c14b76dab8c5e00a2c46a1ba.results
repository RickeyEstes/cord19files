3.1. ADE and neutralizing activities of MAb 5-7-2, MAb 6-4-2, and MAb 7-4-1 against mar mutant viruses ADE and neutralizing activities of MAb 5-7-2, MAb 6-4-2, and MAb 7-4-1 against mar mutant viruses were analyzed (Fig. 1 ). All these MAbs exhibited potent neutralizing and ADE activities for the parent strain, FIPV 79-1146. On the analysis of mar mutant virus reactivity with each MAb, both neutralizing and ADE activities of MAb 5-7-2 were reduced for mar 5-7-2.C1, mar 5-7-2.C2, and mar 5-7-2.7-4-1. Reductions of both neutralizing and ADE activities of MAb 6-4-2 for mar 6-4-2.C2 and mar 6-4-2.7-4-1 and MAb 7-4-1 against mar 7-4-1.C2, mar 5-7-2.7-4-1, and mar 6-4-2.7-4-1 were also observed. Interestingly, the three MAbs exhibited potent neutralizing activity but no ADE activity for the FECV 79-1683 strain.
