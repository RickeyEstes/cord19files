Data-mining workflow and identification of consistently differentially expressed genes in seven human cancer types Raw data from 7 datasets (Table S1 ) was first obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Each dataset corresponds to one cancer type: breast, colon, lung, oral, pancreatic, prostate and gastric cancers. These datasets include expression microarray profiles from cancer tissues and corresponding normal tissues. After determining dysregulated genes in each cancer type, the Consistent Differential Expression Pattern (CDEP) methodology was implemented to identify differentially expressed genes across the seven datasets. 911 genes were up-regulated and 618 genes were down-regulated. Using DAVID, these genes were then functionally classified and the immune-related genes were identified ( Figure S2 , Table S2 ). To further improve the signalto-noise ratio, genes which showed a fold change (FC) ,2 in five or more cancer types were excluded. This resulted in a robust inflammatory profile, termed iCAMP, of 44 up-regulated and 52 down-regulated genes at the mRNA level ( Figure 1 ). The protein expression of iCAMP was verified by IHC in 6 cancer types: breast, colon, lung, pancreatic, prostate and gastric by mining the Human Protein Atlas (Table S3 , Figure S5 ). The clinical significance of iCAMP was determined by using Oncomine database. Finally, the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool was used to pinpoint the function of iCAMP in cancer-associated inflammation.
