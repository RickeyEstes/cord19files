Sample flow of ALI cases is presented in Supplemental Figure  S1 . Characteristics of the ALI case, population control, and at-risk control populations are contained in Table 1 . In Phase 1, the mean age of the ALI cases was 45 years, 70% were male, 92% had blunt trauma and the mean ISS was 27. The mean age of the controls was 9 years and 57% were male. In Phase 2, age, gender, ISS, and mechanism of trauma were similar between cases and controls. Supplemental Table S1 presents subject characteristics by site. Age, gender, and ISS were similar according to individual sites within cases and controls. Following QC and filtering, the genomic inflation factor for the Phase 1 discovery set was 1.027, indicating minimal differences in underlying population structure between cases and controls ( Figure 2) . Figure 3 represents a Manhattan plot of 2log 10 (pvalue) in the Phase 1 discovery cohort. A total of 5815 genotyped SNPs demonstrated association in the Phase 1 discovery cohort at p,0.01; these SNPs were carried forward to the replication phase (Phase 2). Supplemental Table S2 presents results of 28,618 imputed SNPs from Phase 1 that were associated with ALI at p,0.01. A total of 159 SNPs achieved p,0.05 in the Phase 2 replication set with similar direction of OR when adjusted for age, gender, ISS, and mechanism of trauma (Supplemental Table  S3 ). Of note, several of these SNPS were in genes that could plausibly be associated with mechanisms contributing to ALI (Table 2) , including members of the thrombospondin [37, 38] , tetraspanin [39] , and chitinase families [40, 41] . One replicated variant resulted in an amino acid substitution in the corresponding gene product, a Leu29Ile substitution in CCL24 (or eotaxin-2) [42] . These 159 SNPs that replicated in Phase 2 were next carried forward to functional evaluation in Phase 3. In eQTL analyses of TLR-7 stimulated HAPMAP B-LCL, there was significant differential expression of PPFIA1 mRNA (p = 0.0021) according to genotype of rs471931, a cis-acting SNP on 11q13.3 ( Table 3 ). The PPFIA1 gene encodes liprin alpha, a protein involved in cell adhesion and cell-matrix interactions [43] . We additionally screened our discovery phase to test the association of loci with prior reported association with ALI (Table 4) . Notably, the IL10 SNP (rs1800896 at 21082 in the promoter region) showed a similar effect on ALI risk as in prior reports [12] . However, as our GWA platform was not specifically designed to provide adequate coverage for these loci of interest, many of the previously associated SNPs in other genes were not available. Therefore, we also report results for other SNPs within the same candidate genes in Table 4 . Several of these candidate genes contained additional loci associated with ALI risk including IL10, FAS [44] , MYLK [45] , and ANGTP2, although the specific SNPs from prior publications did not replicate in the case of FAS and MYLK.
