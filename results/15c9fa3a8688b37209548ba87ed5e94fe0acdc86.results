The sequence of the peptide we originally designed and chemically synthesized for nanoparticle formation (Raman et al., 2006) is shown in Fig. 1A . The related peptide of this study, ''P6c'', contains an additional His-tag sequence (22 amino acids) at the N-terminus and a longer trimeric coiled-coil domain at the C-terminus (20 amino acids; Fig. 1B) . Furthermore, the two cysteine residues in the original design were replaced by alanine residues (A55 and A64 in P6c) in an attempt to avoid aggregation caused by the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges. The His-tag facilitates the purification process after recombinant protein expression in E. coli. The trimeric domain was extended by three heptad repeats to increase the stability of the trimeric coiled coil (Burkhard et al., 2000a (Burkhard et al., ,b, 2002 . The engineered P6c peptide has a calculated molecular weight of 12.6 kDa. On SDS-PAGE it ran as two bands one at a relative molecular weight (MW) of about 12 kDa corresponding to a monomer, and the other at the relative MW of about 36 kDa corresponding to a trimer (Fig. 1C) . The presence of trimers on the denaturing SDS-PAGE gels implies that the P6c peptide indeed forms a very stable trimeric coiled coil. Modeling predicts that when trimeric and pentameric coiled coils form from the two P6c oligomerization domains the SAPN will either accommodate 60 peptides in T = 1 icosahedral symmetry and have a diameter of about 20 nm or accommodate 180 peptide chains in T = 3-like icosahedral symmetry and have a diameter of about 25 nm (Fig. 1D) .
