As a starting point to gain a better understating of the phylogenetic relationships between alphacoronaviruses, we generated a phylogenetic tree of key representative species and strains based on complete genome nucleotide sequence alignment (Fig. 1A) . As expected, the Alphacoronavirus 1 FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV strains formed a welldefined monophyletic group. The analysis also reveals the clearly delineated branching of coronavirus strains that infect ferrets and mink, FrCoV-NL-2010, MinkCoV-WD1127, and MinkCoV-WD1133, which were recently proposed to form a separate species, Alphacoronavirus 2 (23) (Fig. 1A) . Two main subgroupings within the Alphacoronavirus 1 species were observed, with CCoV and TGEV partitioning into one subgroup and FCoV forming a second, separate subgroup. The complete genome-based phylogenetic tree clusters CCoV and FCoV strains according to their respective host species. Analysis based on the ORF1ab polyprotein sequence reveals very similar phylogenetic relationships, with a partitioning of FCoV strains in one subgroup and CCoV and TGEV strains in another (Fig. 1B) . Similarly to the complete genome analysis, the ORF1ab polyprotein-based phylogenetic groups strains according to host species. Both complete genome and ORF1ab polyprotein cases fail to recapitulate the biologically relevant antigenic demarcations. In particular, the CCoV-A76 recombinant strain clusters with other serotype II CCoVs and TGEVs in both trees. However, we have previously shown that this strain harbors a recombinant S protein that has a distinct antigenic profile compared to other serotype II CCoVs, such as the CCoV-1-71 prototype strain, as it showed no reactivity to any of the serotype II-specific monoclonal antibodies tested (19) . The whole-genome and ORF1ab phylogenetic tree analyses again show their limitations, as they fail to discern the unique biological properties of the CCoV-A76 strain. In contrast, when a phylogenetic analysis based on full-length S protein alignment is performed (Fig. 2A) , a different partitioning of Alphacoronavirus 1 strains is revealed. Serotype I FCoV and CCoV cluster in one group, and serotype II FCoV, CCoV and TGEV are grouped in another. Furthermore, the CCoV-A76 strain is found at an intermediate position between the two serotypes (19) , a result that reflects the recombinant nature of its S protein. This phylogenetic analysis clearly demarcates strains according to the previously characterized serotypes and not according to which host species the strains infect, as was observed when performing the analysis with complete-genome or ORF1ab sequences. Since the coronavirus S protein S1 and S2 are functionally distinct domains, with S1 involved in receptor binding and being the main target of neutralizing antibodies while S2 governs viral fusion, we further analyzed these domains separately using Alphacoronavirus 1 strains and closely related species (Fig. 2B and C) . The S1 analysis shows similar relationships as in the complete spike analysis but with the recombinant CCoV-A76 strain being more closely related to clade A viruses, reflecting its serotype I-derived NTD ( Fig. 2A and B) (19) . For the S2 analysis, while the serological demarcations are retained, the CCoV-A76 strain is found more closely related to clade B or Improved Alphacoronavirus 1 Species Classification serotype II strains due to its recombinant S protein (Fig. 2C) . A characteristic feature of serotype I FCoV and CCoV is an S cleavage site containing a polybasic furin recognition motif at the junction between the S1 receptor-binding domain and the S2 fusion domain, S1/S2 (Fig. 2D) . Alignment of protein sequences of alphacoronavirus S1/S2 S cleavage sites reveals that serotype I CCoV and FCoV contain a 16-to 19-amino-acid insert, with a stretch of basic residues, flanked by fairly well conserved N-and C-terminal regions. This feature is absent in serotype II FCoV, CCoV, TGEV, and ferret CoV, mink CoV, or other alphacoronaviruses. The lack of an S1/S2 furin site in CCoV-A76 S protein sequence is in agreement with the fact that only the NTD of the CCoV-A76 S protein is serotype I-like, with the rest of the protein being serotype II-like, including the region around the S1/S2 site. Overall, these alignment observations are in good agreement with the complete S, S1, and S2 phylogenetic tree analyses. Using such S-based analyses, we propose that the Alphacoronavirus 1 species be subclassified as clade A, corresponding to serotype I FCoV and CCoV, and clade B, corresponding to serotype II FCoV and CCoV and TGEV-like viruses.
