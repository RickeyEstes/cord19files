A total of 210 children were randomized; one child discontinued the study medication, and another used it improperly. Of 208 children who acceptably completed the study, 105 received FP, and 103 received placebo. The demographic characteristics of the groups were comparable, except that parental smoking was more frequent in the FP group (Table I) . Compliance to medication was good; a single dose was missed by 10 children in the FP group and 14 children in the placebo group. There were 8 adverse events recorded: blood-tinged nasal mucus (2 in the FP and 4 in the placebo group); herpes simplex vesicle (one in the placebo group); and hospitalization caused by pneumonia (one in the FP group). Of the 105 children in the FP group, AOM developed during the treatment in 40 (38.1%) children. In the placebo group AOM was diagnosed in 29 (28.2%) of the 103 children, and the difference was not statistically significant (P = .13). The median day for diagnosing AOM was day 7 of the study (ie, the day of the preplanned control visit). Sixteen (23%) of 69 cases of AOM were diagnosed before day 6 and 3 (4%) of 69 cases before day 3 of the study. The median durations of rhinitis, cough, and fever after commencement of the study medication were 6.0, 3.0, and 0.0 days, respectively, in both groups. The specific viral cause of URI was determined in 167 (86.1%) of 194 children from whom a nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen was obtained (Table II) . Rhinovirus was the most frequently found causative agent, occurring in a total of 74 (38.1%) children. Enteroviruses were detected in 48 (24.7%) children. Among both rhinovirus-and enterovirus-positive children, the demographic characteristics were comparable between the treatment groups, as well as between these and other children (data not shown). In the 69 children with rhinovirus as a single causative agent, AOM developed in 16 (45.7%) of 35 FP recipients compared with 5 (14.7%) of 34 children receiving placebo (P = .005, Table III ). Even after adjustment with known risk factors for AOM (age, sex, breast-feeding, parental smoking, use of pacifier, and daycare outside home), the use of FP was significantly associated with the increased incidence of AOM (odds ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-14.5; P = .027). No significant differences were observed in the occurrences of AOM between the FP and placebo groups in children with any other cause of URI (Table III) .
