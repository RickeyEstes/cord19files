No attempt was made to evaluate the initial information phase. Data were collected for the screening phase. Table 1 summarizes the screening results for inbound and outbound HAN screening measures. As of July 5, 2003, a total of 1,172,986 persons received either yellow or cherry HANs. A total of 2,889 persons answered yes to at least 1 screening question on the HAN and were referred to secondary screening according to protocol. None of the 411 outbound passengers who were referred for secondary screening in Toronto were asked to defer their travel. All persons were cleared, and none were referred for additional medical examination. In addition, 763,082 persons (467,870 inbound and 295,212 outbound) were screened by the thermal scanners (Table 2 ). Only 191 persons had an initial temperature reading >38Â°C and were referred for secondary evaluation. No data were collected systematically to correlate thermal scanner results with results of temperature taking by secondary screening nurses. Some of the persons arriving or departing Toronto and Vancouver airports were screened by both HAN and thermal scanning measures. During this period, no screening measure put in place by Health Canada detected any cases of SARS at border entry points. Careful analysis of the travel histories of suspected and probable SARS patients who traveled to Canada showed that persons became ill after arrival and would not have been detected by airport screening measures. Table 3 summarizes the travel histories of persons departing Canada whose ilnesses were subsequently diagnosed as SARS-like illness. Health Canada collaborated with many international public health authorities to document travel and illness histories of possible SARS patients who departed Canada and whose illneses were diagnosed and reported internationally (7) (8) (9) . Health Canada investigated >40 such reports, of which 11 are now attributed to Canada (10) . In all but 2 cases (cases 2 and 11), onset of illness occurred after departure from Canada. Of these 11 persons who traveled from Canada, all met the WHO prob-able SARS case definition. Only 3 of these case-patients met the Canadian probable case definition. Another 3 casepatients would meet the Canadian geo-linked case definition; 1 case met the Canadian "person under investigation" category; and 4 case-patients did not meet any Canadian SARS case definition. Of the 3 case-patients who did meet the Canadian definition, none would have been detected by exit screening. Only 2 (patients 2 and 11) of the 11 persons had symptoms at the time of travel, but both would have been cleared by the criteria established in the secondary screening protocol. We identified 18 symptomatic probable or suspected SARS patients on 29 flights (10 patients traveled on >2 flights). No documented transmission was identified. Detailed results of Canada's airplane passenger contact tracing can be found elsewhere (6) .
