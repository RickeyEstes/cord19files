A total of 440 samples were collected from 210 children during the study period. After excluding samples from patients aged 19 and above, samples obtained after the first collection, and failed runs, the total number of samples analyzed was 176; only a single sample was tested per patient. While there were no failures with the LDTP, the total number of failed runs by FilmArray was 11 and with ResPlex was 15. The mean age of children with samples included in the analysis was 6.9 years, ranging from 2 months to 18 years. The vast majority of samples were NPW with 167 samples (94.9%), followed by TA with 6 samples (3.4%), BAL with 2 samples (1.1%) and one NPS (0.6%). Over 80% of tested samples came from children who were 13 or younger: samples from children two years or less accounted for 27.3% (48) of samples, between three and five years inclusive were 24.4% (43), between six and 13 were 32.4% (57), and 15.9% (28) of samples came from children aged between 14 and 18, inclusive.
