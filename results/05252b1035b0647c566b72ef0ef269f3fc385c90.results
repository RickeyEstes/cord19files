In both corpora of #CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns tweets, all three predictor variables of interest and the four potential confounders were found to be significant in the univariable analyses, and they were entered into the multivariable negative binomial regression model ( Table 3) . For the #CDCGrandRounds corpus, after controlling for users' followers count, friends' count, status count, and favorite count, it was found that a unit increase in the number of hashtag will increase the retweet frequency by 8% (adjusted prevalence ratio, aPR = 1.0784, 95% CI, 1.0302, 1.1292, p < 0.001); increasing mention by one will reduce the retweet frequency of 14% (aPR = 0.8613, 95% CI, 0.8152, 0.9100; p < 0.001); and increasing URL link count by one will increase the retweet frequency by 78% (aPR = 1.7773, 95% CI, 1.6729, 1.8890; p < 0.001) ( Table 3) . For the #VitalSigns corpus, after controlling for users' followers count, friends' count, status count, and favorite count, it was found that adding one more hashtag would decrease retweet frequency by 3% (aPR = 0.9688, 95% CI, 0.9472, 0.9908, p < 0.001), while adding one more mention and one more URL link would increase retweet frequency by 17% (aPR = 1.1748, 95% CI, 1.1404, 1.2104, p < 0.001) and 22% (aPR = 1.2155, 95% CI, 1.1587, 1.2752, p < 0.001) respectively. Tables S1 and S2 in the Online Supplementary Materials present the top retweet for each cycle of the #CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns corpora respectively, and whether they contain visual cues, as well as their retweet frequency. Figure 1 presents the per-cycle probability ratios of retweets for original tweets with images or videos as compared to those without. Detailed results are presented in Tables S3 and S4 in the Online Supplementary Materials. Here we highlight a few important findings. Of the 58 #CDCGrandRounds cycles, 29 were found to have statistically significant difference between tweets with and without visual cues (Table S3) . Of these 29 cycles, one had a PR estimate < 1; twenty-four had PR between 1 and 3; and four had PR > 3. Two cycles were outliers: 'Preventing Suicide: A Comprehensive Public Health Approach' (September 2015) with PR = 36.353 (95% confidence intervals, CI, 4.869-343.845, P < 0.001) and 'Understanding the Causes of Major Birth Defects: Steps to Prevention' (January 2015) with PR = 34.713 (95% CI, 7.662-261.591, P < 0.001). Of the 42 #VitalSigns cycles, 19 were statistically significant (Table S4 ). The PR estimates of six of these 19 cycles were between 1 and 3; and for 7 cycles, PR were between 3 and 5; for 6 cycles, PR was > 5. There were three outliers:
