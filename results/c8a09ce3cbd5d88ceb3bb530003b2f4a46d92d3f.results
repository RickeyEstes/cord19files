All the initial samples (a total of 213) collected from Christmas Hills, Allansford and Naracoorte (January 2016) were negative for the presence of adenoviruses and RNA viruses (i.e. ABLV, filoviruses, coronaviruses and henipaviruses). Therefore, no further testing for these viruses was undertaken on subsequently collected samples. In contrast, herpesvirus DNA was detected in 146 (i.e. 31%; n = 467) bats examined. All PCR negative control reactions, and extraction negative control reactions, were negative for the presence of herpesvirus DNA. All positive extraction controls and PCR positive control samples were positive for the presence of the herpesvirus DNA. Herpesvirus DNA prevalence was higher in eastern bent-winged bats (41%; n = 116) than in southern bent-winged bats (27%, n = 351), with the lowest prevalence at Naracoorte (Table 1) . All the dead bats tested negative for herpesvirus, except for two southern bent-winged bats from Naracoorte, one from a liver sample and another from a lung sample. However, the DNA was of insufficient quality to confirm the positive results by sequencing. All oral swabs collected from dead bats tested negative for herpesvirus DNA. Herpesvirus DNA suitable for sequencing was obtained from 89/146 of the PCR positive samples. Analysis of the herpesvirus sequence data from these 89 samples revealed six different consensus viral sequences or sequence types (S1 Table) , including one gammaherpesvirus (referred to as N7050-like viruses) and five betaherpesviruses (referred to as D15, NG46, CH20, E22 and CH6-like viruses). The viral sequences were compared with bat herpesviruses in GenBank and the maximum percentage predicted amino acid identity to other known bat herpesviruses was found to range from 61% (for CH20-like viruses) to 96% (for CH6-like viruses) ( Table 2 ). This region of the genome is highly conserved in gammaherpesviruses (e.g. 93% amino acid pairwise identity between the closely related equine gammaherpesviruses 5 and 7, GenBank accession numbers AF141886.1 and AKE07652.1, respectively) and betaherpesviruses (e.g. 98% amino acid pairwise identity between the closely related human Table 1 . Prevalence of herpesvirus DNA in oropharyngeal swabs, including proportion of sequence-confirmed positive swabs (confirmed), collected from populations of southern and eastern bent-winged bats from south-eastern Australia. All bats are adults unless otherwise indicated. betaherpesviruses 6A and 6B, GenBank accession numbers APO39176.1 and AB283024.1, respectively), suggesting that the detected viruses may be novel viruses, although further genome sequencing is required to confirm this. A phylogenetic tree demonstrating the relationship of the six virus sequence types with each other and with other known herpesviruses is presented in Fig 1. A similarity matrix of aligned amino acid sequences and a nucleotide phylogenetic tree are available as supplementary information (S2 Table and S1 Fig) . This analysis, despite the small fragment of protein sequence available for assessment and low posterior support values for some internal branches, highlighted that the detected viruses clustered within the Herpesviridae subfamilies, Gammaherpesvirinae and Betaherpesvirinae.
