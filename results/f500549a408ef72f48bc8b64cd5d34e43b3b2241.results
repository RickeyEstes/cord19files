The coronavirus 3CLpros and their cleavage sites are evolutionarily conserved among different genera. To study the genetic diversity and evolution of 3CLpro cleavage sites of coronaviruses pp1a/1ab, 308 primary sequences of 3CLpro cleavage sites (ranging from P4 to P2 ) of 28 species of coronaviruses were collected and listed in Tables S1-S4, including the predicted and verified cleavage sites. 11 canonical cleavage sites of each coronavirus were joined end to end to produce a spliced sequence which was then used to produce a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1A ). In addition, the sequences of all coronavirus 3CLpro were used to generate another phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B) . The analyses showed that the phylogenetic distances and taxonomic positions of each virus, in both phylogenetic trees, were mostly consistent with that classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (http://www.ictvonline. org/virusTaxonomy.asp). These results implied that the cleavage sites of coronaviral 3CLpros might co-evolve with 3CLpros, and the genetic diversity of both 3CLpro and its cleavage sites are relatively conserved between different genera of coronaviruses. However, on the phylogenetic tree generated with 3CLpro cleavage sites (Fig. 1A) , the members of the genus Gammacoronavirus, although clustered closely, is split into alphacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses, suggesting that the cleavage sites of gammacoronaviruses may have undergone recombination events during evolution.
