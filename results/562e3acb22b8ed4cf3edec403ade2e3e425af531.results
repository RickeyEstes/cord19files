Among two HBV-and immune-related SNPs in the CFB and CD40 regions (14, 15) and three hepatitis C virus-related SNPs in the IFNL4 regions, (16) (17) (18) allele type differences can be found between Africa and Europe or between Africa and South Asia ( Fig. 2A ). All these immune-related SNP genotypes differed significantly between Esan in Nigeria and Toscani in Italy and between Luhya in Webuye, Kenya (LWK) and Gujarati in India (GIH) ( Table 1 ; P < 0.001). Among 12 HBV-and HLA-related SNPs, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) the allele frequency showed marked differences between South and East Asian genome samples (Fig. 2B) . Eight of the 12 SNPs differed significantly between Bengali in Bangladesh (BEB) and Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna, China (CDX); these areas represent the junction of South and East Asia ( Table 2 ; P < 0.001). Three of the 12 HBV-and HLA-related SNPs (Fig. 2B , dotted lines; rs9276370, rs3128917, and rs9380343) also showed significant differences between LWK in Africa and GIH in South Asia ( Table 2 ; P < 0.001). In contrast, we found the allele frequency of NPC-related SNPs (18) (19) (20) to be relatively stable among different populations (Fig. 2C ).
