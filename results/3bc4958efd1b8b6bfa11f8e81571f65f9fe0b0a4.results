We evaluated the survival of human coronavirus (HCoV) infectivity after various incubations that may reflect clinically relevant situations. Results of these experiments were expressed as the percentage of infectivity recovered after the various treatments compared with the starting infectious titre. Figure 1 shows virus survival in aqueous suspensions. Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 could survive for at least six days in our experimental conditions. The half-life was approximately five days in PBS and between two and three days in the other two media. Figure 2 shows survival after drying, with time zero representing the time just after drying. Rapid loss of virus infectivity was remarkable for the two viruses on all surfaces but HCoV-229E infectivity was still detectable after up to 3 h. Figure 3 describes the infectivity of HCoV after inactivation by chemical disinfectants in suspension at the dilutions of disinfectants that did not interfere with the biological viral titration assay (Table I) .
