We evaluated the effects of ribavirin at 1 μM, 10 μM and 100 μM on cytokine production in human PBMC following polyclonal activation with 10 g of PHA and following the addition of tetanus toxoid as a recall antigen. Cytokines release (IL-2, IFN-, IL-4, IL-10 and TNF-) was measured in absence or presence of ribavirin (Figures 1 and 2) . The effects of ribavirin on cytokine released by human PBMC in response to PHA and TT has shown great variation among individuals. No significant changes were observed between 1-10 μM ribavirin in the production of TNF-, IFN-and IL-10 by both PHA and TT-stimulated PBMC. Ribavirin significantly inhibited TNF-, IFN-, and IL-10 in both PHA and TT-stimulated PBMC at 100 μM. PHA and TT production of TNF-and IFN-by PBMC was reduced by 74 % to 85 % compared to baseline (p <0.05). PHA-induced IL-10 production was reduced in 95 % (p < 0.01) while TT stimulated was reduced in 50% (p < 0.01). Ribavirin at 100 μM induced an increase of 124% in the production of IL-2 by PHA-stimulated PBMC (p < 0.05). IL-4 was not detectable in supernatant of PBMC stimulated with PHA or TT in absence or in presence of ribavirin.
