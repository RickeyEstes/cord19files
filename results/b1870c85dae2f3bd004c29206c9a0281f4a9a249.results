Intranasal Inoculation of4-wk-old Mire with MHVJHM. After 10-d-old C57BL/6 mice were inoculated intranasally with MHVJHM, viral RNA was detected in the olfactory and trigeminal nerves and their intermediate connections (15). To prove that MHVJHM spreads transneuronally, we attempted unilateral ablation of the olfactory bulb in these suckling mice . In preliminary experiments, we found that denervation by surgical methods was very difficult due to the small size of these animals. On the other hand, 4-wk-old mice, which are significantly larger, survived surgery and anesthesia, and the absence of fully calcified skulls facilitated the surgery. According to published reports, MHV causes an acute nasoencephalopathy in weanling and adult mice after intranasal inoculation (19) (20) (21) , so it was anticipated that MHVJHM would readily enter the CNS of 4-wk-old mice after this route of inoculation . To verify that this was true, the brains of 4-wk-old C57BL/6 mice were analyzed by in situ hybridization at several times after intranasal inoculation (Fig. 1) . At 5 d post-infection, viral RNA could readily be detected in parts of the brain connected anatomically to the olfactory and trigeminal nerves, such as the olfactory bulb, the fornix, the hypothalamus, the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, and the reticular nuclei (Fig. 1 B) . By 8 d post-infection, mice showed signs of severe encephalitis, including irritability, hunching, and ruffled fur. Viral RNA was detected diffusely throughout the brain, with very prominent labeling in the reticular formation (Fig. 1 C) . Effect o,fSurgical Ablation ofOlfactory Bulb The above results suggested that MHVJHM entered the CNS of 4-wk-old mice, 1128 Entry of a Coronavirus into the Central Nervous System as in suckling mice, via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves, and that spread to other parts of the brain occurred via neuroanatomic connections of these two nerves . If this interpretation is correct, surgical interruption of one of the neuroanatomic pathways should prevent viral spread. The olfactory pathway is amenable to surgical intervention at the level of the nasal epithelium, the olfactory nerve, or the olfactory bulb. Removal of the olfactory bulb is readily accomplished in 4-wk-old mice, and this operation was performed in order to interrupt spread of MHVJHM via the olfactory pathway. In addition, only one olfactory bulb from each mouse was removed, so that the intact bulb served as an internal control for virus spread . This surgical procedure should have no effect on the spread of the virus via the trigeminal nerve on either side of the brain . Unilateral olfactory bulbectomy was performed on 28 4-wk-old C57BL/6 mice, and, as described in Materials and Methods, 17 mice could be evaluated, Consistent results were obtained with all mice . At 4 d postinfection, viral RNA could be detected by in situ hybridization in the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nuclei, and lateral olfactory tract on the control side of the brain, with no virus present on the side of the brain from which the bulb had been removed (Fig.  2) . No labeling was evident in the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve when analyzed by film autoradiography, but a few small foci of viral RNA could be detected in some mice on both sides by emulsion autoradiography and light microscopy (data not shown) . These results are consistent with previous data showing that MHVJHM was transported more rapidly via the olfactory than trigeminal nerves (15) . By 5 d post-infection, viral RNA could be detected in several locations on both the control and experimental sides of the brain. In particular, the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve was labeled on both sides (Figs. 3, 4) , indicating that the surgical procedure did not affect transport 1129 Perlman et al . of virus via the trigeminal nerve. In marked contrast, no viral RNA could be detected in the most anterior part of the brain from which the olfactory bulb had been removed, but was clearly present in this region in the control hemisphere. In addition, viral RNA could be detected bilaterally in more distant connections of the olfactory system, such as the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, the fornix, the mammillary nuclei, and the limbic cortex. This spread of virus on the operated side most likely occurred via olfactory fibers known to cross to the opposite side of the brain via the anterior commissure. To show that viral RNA crossed from the olfactory bulb and nuclei on the control side to the operated side via the anterior commissure, the latter structure was analyzed for the presence of viral kNA. Viral RNA was present in the anterior commissure on both the control ( (Fig. 5, B and D) sides of the brain.
