Perceived risk and precautionary behavior by age, sex and household size The age and gender distribution of the respondents approximated that of the US adult population ( Table 2) . Most respondents (95%) reported that they had heard about H1N1 influenza before opening the survey, but familiarity was positively associated with age (r = 0.18, p < 0.001). Women gave higher mean responses than men on the perceived likelihood scale (33.2% vs. 30.4%, t(1288) = 1.96, p = 0.05). In contrast, men were more pessimistic with regard to the number of deaths from H1N1 influenza, and a larger proportion of men expected over 1,000 deaths (34.3% vs.21.7%, c 2 = 25.6, p < 0.001). A higher proportion of women showed interest in taking pharmaceutical interventions than men (72.6% vs. 66.7%, c 2 = 5.33, p = 0.02 for preventive intervention; 86.7% vs. 79.5%, c 2 = 11.8, p < 0.001 for curative intervention), and engaged in information seeking activities (61.8% vs. 49.2%, c 2 = 20.8, p < 0.001). There was no significant sex difference in the scores of the WTP scales, or in the zzzproportion of respondents who took quarantine measures. There was no consistent correlation between age and the perceived likelihood scale or engagement in precautionary activities (Table 3) . However, older respondents estimated a higher death toll. Scores on the willingness to pay scale for pharmaceutical interventions were negatively correlated with age. The willingness to accept pharmaceutical intervention increased with household size, as did the engagement in information seeking activities.
