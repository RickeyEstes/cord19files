Clinical description of the patients (Table 1) : noncritically ill patients were slightly older than critically ill ones (p < 0.1). Male patients accounted for the vast majority of the cases in the non-ICU group. Sex distribution was more equal in the group of critically ill patients. CAP at admission was more frequent in the ICU group. No differences in the frequency of viral infection were found between groups. On the contrary, bacterial or fungal infection was more frequent in the ICU group. While both groups showed severe hypoxemia at admission, critically ill patients showed higher levels of CO 2 in their blood. Five critical patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation. None of the critically ill patients showed higher lymphocyte counts in their blood. On the contrary, critically ill patients showed higher neutrophil counts. None of the patients died. Microbiological results revealed the following distribution of viral and bacterial infection: Respiratory virus infection: Non ICU group: Rhinovirus (n = 4); Influenza A/H1N1 nv (n = 1); Metapneumovirus (MPV) (n = 1); Coronavirus 229E (n = 1). ICU group: MPV (n = 1); Influenza A/H1N1 nv (n = 2); Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) (n = 1). Bacterial/fungal infection: Non ICU group: P aeruginosa (n = 2); Candida glabrata (n = 1). ICU group: A. fumigatus (n = 1); C. pneumoniae (n = 1); S. pneumoniae (n = 3); S hominis (n = 1); P aeruginosa (n = 1); S. epidermidis (n = 1). (Table 4 ). Patients in the ICU group not only showed increased neutrophil counts in blood, but also higher levels of RNAm corresponding to a group of proteins known to participate in neutrophil-mediated antimicrobial defense and tissue injury ( Figure 1 ). Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2 ).
