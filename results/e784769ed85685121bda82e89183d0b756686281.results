Results focus on the accumulated number of infected nodes over time after the introduction of a disease. In the absence of control strategies, a 5% infection rate leads to 100% of nodes being infected within approximately 100 weeks (Fig 3, red line) . In the case of non-vector-borne diseases, i.e. when the transmission channel is restricted to the trade network, the MRP is an effective control strategy. If the detection tools are perfect it can immediately stop the spread of the disease (Fig 3, green line) . In cases where the disease can be transmitted through both geographic and trade networks (as in the case of vector-borne diseases), the outbreak cannot be contained by movement restrictions alone even if the detection and control rates are 100% since the geographic channel cannot be closed by the MRP (Fig 3, blue line) . However, the MRP helps to slow the disease spreading. When a disease is difficult to detect (γ close to 0) the benefits of the MRP are severely dampened (S2 Fig). When both the geographic and trade networks are considered, a disease with a 5% infection rate infects half of the nodes around periods 275, 185, and 125 for detection rates equal to 100%, 50%, and 20%, respectively. When the strategic behavior of agents is incorporated the outcome of the MRP changes significantly. The anticipation effect increases the speed of infection, and for a low detection rate, γ = 20%, the benefits of the MRP are severely reduced (Fig 4) . As the detection rate increases, the anticipation effects become less relevant since infected farms are removed from the network before they can sell. Although there exists some overlap in the results of the simulations under different scenarios, the mean trajectory of infected nodes under the MRP with anticipation effects is significantly higher than in the case without anticipation. Such overlapping disappears when the 15% most extreme outcomes are omitted from the analysis (S3 Fig). The effect of anticipation Anticipatory behavior-connectivity of a susceptible node. A susceptible node can be located in the RZ or the unscathed zone (UZ). If located in the RZ, the node is unable to sell (probability of selling = pr = 0) and has no effect on the dissemination of the disease. A node located in the UZ can face two situations: A) The node is not connected to any node located in the RZ so it will decide to sell or not according to pr = p s , which is associated with its type (farm, dealer, market; see Table 2 ); B) The node is connected to a node located in the RZ so q i;t > b q, which triggers anticipatory sales (pr = 1). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0157450.g002 can be assessed using the efficiency index, which decreases from 1.06 without anticipation effects to 0.41 when anticipation effects are included. The rank correlation coefficients, whose range is [-1,1], are small and positive for the degree and closeness of the initially infected node (between 0.02 and 0.18), and large and negative for the time at which the first hub is infected (between -0.53 and -0.88, see Fig 5) . Finally, the size of the monetary transfer required to prevent anticipatory selling is derived for two option values that correspond to different penalties (10% and 30%) on the value of the animal, considering that too old/heavy animals
