A full-length PB1-F2 protein is conserved at a higher rate in avian viral isolates compared to mammalian isolates Previous analyses indicated that the full-length PB1-F2 ORF was more often conserved in IAV strains isolated from avian hosts than those isolated from mammalian hosts. To verify and extend these data, we downloaded all full-length PB1 influenza segment nucleotide sequences from the NCBI database for avian, swine and human hosts, removing duplicate sequences. Subsequently, 24 803 PB1 nucleotide sequences were analysed in the +1 reading frame to determine the length of the PB1-F2 ORF. We defined full-length PB1-F2 as 87 aa or longer since this is the length of the well-studied PB1-F2 protein of PR8 virus, and has been shown to enable mitochondrial targeting in all instances where it has been assessed. Other published analyses have used a PB1-F2 length of 79 aa or more (Zell et al., 2007) , based on the minimal length for an intact mitochondrial targeting sequence of porcine isolates in HeLa cells (Zell et al., 2007) , but this is a notional cut-off bearing in mind mitochondrial targeting has been seen for a PB1-F2 of only 75 aa for PR8 in Vero cells (Yamada et al., 2004) vs 87 aa in HeLa cells (Gibbs et al., 2003) and even then not all PB1-F2 proteins of length greater than 89 aa localize to the mitochondria (Chen et al., 2010) . However, a reanalysis of our data for length at least 79 aa indicates little alteration of the frequencies from using 89 aa or more (Table S1 , available in the online Supplementary Material). The percentage of full-length PB1-F2 in human, swine and avian hosts was calculated as 43, 48 and 93 %, respectively (Table 1) .
