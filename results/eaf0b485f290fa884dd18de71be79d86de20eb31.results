In total, 510 respondents in Wuhan and 501 respondents in Shanghai completed the interview, and the overall response rate was 14.8% (1,011/6,836) (Appendix Figure 1 ). Respondents in Wuhan and Shanghai were generally similar in terms of sex, marital status and occupation, but in Shanghai respondents tended to be older and had higher education and income levels than in Wuhan (Table 1 ). Our sample was consistent with characteristics of the general population in the two cities, as Shanghai is more developed and has an older population than Wuhan. Expectedly, respondents in Wuhan were much more intensely exposed to the COVID-19 outbreak and paid attention to the outbreak earlier than those in Shanghai. We first investigated patterns of usual exposure to live animals before the outbreak ( Table 2 Panel of 55, 58.2% in Shanghai, p=0.339); more than 90% of respondents always arranged for slaughter of purchased animals in wet markets, with no noticeable differences between the two cities. However, residents in Wuhan reported wild animal consumption at a higher rate than those in Shanghai; 47 (9.2%) of 510 respondents in Wuhan and 23 (4.6%) of 501 respondents in Shanghai reported eating All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is To investigate effects of the outbreak, we further assessed behavioural changes in exposure to live animals before and during the outbreak (Figure 2) , and intention to change after the outbreak ( Table 2 Panel B). We found that respondents dramatically reduced exposure to live animals during the outbreak, with respondents in Wuhan changing their exposure much more significantly than in Shanghai. Specifically, the frequency of visiting LPMs decreased from 23.3% (n=119) to 3.1% (n=16) in Wuhan (p<0·001), and from 20.4% (n=102) to 4.4%(n=22) in Shanghai (p<0·001; Figure 2 ). The proportion of respondents buying live poultry or wild animals also decreased from around 11.0% to 2.6% in both cities (p<0·001). We also asked whether respondents intended to change their habit of buying live poultry or wild animals since the outbreak among those exposing to live animals at usual ( (4/55) of respondents in Wuhan and 25.5% (14/55) in Shanghai stated they would continue to buy these products as usual. The proportion of respondents consuming wild animals declined significantly, 10.2%(n=52) to 0.6%(n=3) in Wuhan (p<0·001) and 5.2%(n=26) to 0.8%(n=4) in Shanghai (p<0·001) (Figure 2 ).

Table 3 presents socio-demographic factors associated with public support for the governmental containment measures implemented (i.e. closure of LPMs, banning the wild animal trade, and city quarantine) and confidence in the effectiveness of governmental response. There was evidence that females were more supportive towards all three containment measures and that there was a positive association between education level and the likelihood of supporting regulations on wet markets and trade of wild animals.

We did not find any difference in population profiles of those who support Wuhan quarantine or show confidence in the effectiveness of governmental response.
