used in its assembly (the complete data set is available upon request). At three positions in the consensus sequence there have been insertions or deletions of blocks of sequence in more than one element. The deleted regions are indicated in the consensus by dashed lines. At present, each element characterized at these positions has at least one block of sequence deleted relative to the consensus. Whether there are full-length elements corresponding to the consensus sequence remains to be shown. At a number of positions we observed alternative bases occurring with sufficient frequency that no particular base could be unambiguously chosen (Fig. 2) .
