During the study period, 220 consecutive patients screened as eligible. After further screening 213 were eligible for enrollment and 119 consented to enrollment and nasopharyngeal swab for POC-PCR testing. Fig. 1 , illustrates patient enrollment. Among 119 participants, gender proportion was fair (50.4% female) and median age was 7.6 years (range 0.3-91). Most were Hispanic (55.5%), White (18.5%), or Asian/Pacific Islander (13.5%). More than half (56.3%) had received the seasonal flu vaccine. Approximately 10% of participants had a history of smoking. Additional sample characteristics are detailed in Table 1 . Of 119 participants, 52.9% (n = 63) had positive POC-PCR. Influenza (58.8%, n = 37) was more prevalent than RSV (41.3%, n = 26) with influenza A (42.9%, n = 27) more prevalent than influenza B (15.9%, n = 10). The median age of participants infected with influenza A (15.4 years, range 0.6-79.4) and influenza B (14.7 years, range 6.5-71.4) was similar (p = 0.972) while RSV infected a younger population (3.0 years, range 0.5-78.1, p = 0.008). One-quarter (25.4%, n = 17) of patients who received the seasonal flu vaccine were POC-PCR influenza positive. Of the 38 patients who also received the laboratory-PCR panel, 28.9% (n = 11) were positive for viruses other than influenza or RSV including two who were co-infected with one of these additional viruses and influenza A or RSV. Table 2 displays room placement type and TAT for laboratory-PCR test results. Less than half of all participants were placed in a private room (32.8%) with the majority of POC-PCR positive patients (69.8%) placed in a shared room. Time to room placement varied widely for Table 3 , in the 38 samples that were incidentally tested with both laboratory-PCR and POC-PCR, POC-PCR was highly sensitive (100.0%, 95% CI 80.5-100.0%) and specific (95.2%, 95% CI 76.2-99.9%) when compared to the laboratory-PCR panel. Table 4 details oseltamivir and antibiotics ordered by physicians. Antibiotics were ordered for 18.5% (n = 22) of patients. Six (9.5%) patients were POC-PCR positive and received antibiotics; four were immunocompromised or had a chest x-ray suggestive of communityacquired pneumonia. Oseltamivir was ordered for 11 patients, all but one were POC-PCR positive for influenza A or B. Of the 27 influenza positive cases, 77.8% (n = 21) who were eligible to receive oseltamivir -those < 2 and > 65 years old, with history of pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, or with an illness duration < 48 h -did not receive therapy. Eligibility was determined using criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). [35] . A POC-PCR test could potentially modify treatment decisions and improve proper utilization of antimicrobial therapies in up to 19.3% of cases (n = 23 of 119).
