Between March 26-May 31 2003, 304 patients fitting the case definition of probable SARS were hospitalized. Of these, 271 were laboratory confirmed following the detection of SARS-CoV-specific IgM and/or IgG antibody by immunofluorescence [6] and/or by the detection of SARS-CoV RNA by RT-PCR. The mean age of the cohort was 36 Â± 16 years. There were 92 (33.9%) healthcare workers who acquired SARS, including 51 nurses, 30 physicians, 5 logistics staff, 3 pharmacists and 2 laboratory technicians (one of whom was believed to be infected after handling sputum and stool samples from SARS patients in a diagnostic laboratory). A total of 112 people were infected following exposure to SARS patients in the hospital setting, either as healthcare workers, patients or visitors, and another 62 cases were household contacts of known SARS cases. Common clinical features on admission included fever (100%), subjective shortness of breath (57%), nonproductive cough (55%), malaise (52%), myalgia (38%), headache (30%), dyspnea (21%), chills (17%), diarrhea (11%) and sore throat (6%). The mortality rate was 9.2% (25/271) amongst laboratory-confirmed cases. Sera, throat washes and stool samples were tested for SARS-CoV RNA by RT-PCR. A total of 614 sera (ranging from 1-7 per patient) were collected 1-78 days after the onset of illness from 271 cases. Overall, 31.3% (192/614) of sera had detectable amounts of SARS-CoV RNA detected, with viral loads ranging from 10 1 -10 3 copies/ml serum (Table 1) . Sera collected within 9 days of disease onset were more likely to be RT-PCR positive (54%) than later in the disease course, although SARS-CoV RNA was still occasionally detected in sera out to 24 days of illness. A single throat wash was self-collected by 96 patients 1 to 35 days after the onset of disease. A total of 50 (52.1%) had SARS-CoV RNA detected by RT-PCR (Table 2) , with viral loads ranging from 10 1 -10 5 copies/ml wash fluid. The highest detection rate was 61% in throat washes collected between days 5 and 14. Of 224 stool samples self-collected by 188 patients (1-2 samples each), 127 (56.7%) had SARS-CoV RNA detected by RT-PCR (Table 3) . Stool samples were not collected in the first 10 days of illness, but high rates of SARS-CoV RNA detection (44/51, 86.3%) were seen in stools collected between 10 and 19 days after onset. Viral loads in stool were as high as 10 10 copies/g feces from day 10. Fecal samples collected 40 days or more after onset of disease contained SARS-CoV RNA in 29.8% (17/57) of samples, with a mean load of 7000 copies/g feces. The fecal load of SARS-CoV was at least between 2 and 3 logs higher than in throat washes or sera at comparable time points.
