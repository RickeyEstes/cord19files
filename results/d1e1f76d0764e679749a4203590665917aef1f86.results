The No. 7 bus line connects the famous Lingyin Temple to the Hangzhou Railway Station, passing such prime tourist destinations as West Lake and half of the central business area (Fig. 2a) . At 17:03 h on 3 July 2014, during Saturday afternoon rush hour, a crowded bus with >80 passengers, comprising foreign tourists and commuters returning home, was set aflame. According to the in-bus monitor, the terrorist set the bus on fire by dumping a bottle of lacquer thinner on the floor and igniting it with a cigarette lighter. The back half of the bus was completely engulfed in flames and smoke within only 4 s ( Fig. 2b and c) . Dozens of civilians, building safety guards, and private car/taxi/bus drivers at the scene broke the windows to help evacuate the trapped passengers and doused the fire using fire extinguishers and fire hoses (Fig. 2d ). Within 5 min, the fire was extinguished when the fire engine arrived, and the first evacuated victims were transported to the nearest hospitals by private cars and taxis. The Hangzhou public health event and disaster emergency plans were activated. The Hangzhou health bureau set up a scene command center, and 21 ambulances were mobilized to first assess and triage the patients. Within 40 min, all 33 patients were triaged to the five nearest hospitals. However, before the scene command center setup and ambulance arrival, the first 10 evacuated patients were transported by civilian cars to the two nearest hospitals, which did not have a burn ward. The command center then conducted the secondary triage ( Fig. 3b ). At the same time, the blood center was mobilized to supply >50 000 ml of plasma within the first 24 h.
