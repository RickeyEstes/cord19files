The UFS structure is conserved among the flavivirus genus Although the U-rich region in the 5 0 end of the MBFV genome has been shown to enhance vRNA replication (Friebe and Harris, 2010; Lodeiro et al., 2009) , there were controversial opinions regarding the detailed structures downstream of SLA in flaviviruses Gebhard et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013; Villordo and Gamarnik, 2009; Zhang et al., 2008) . To clarify the structural characteristics of the region downstream of SLA, representative sequences derived from various flavivirus species were subjected to the mfold RNA folding server (Zuker, 2003; Zuker and Jacobson, 1998) . Because the region of interest is involved in genome cyclization, both the 5 0 end sequences and the query sequences composed of the 5 0 and 3 0 ends were analyzed. Figure 1A shows the representative results of the RNA structure prediction. The local RNA structures in the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of DENV4 vRNA are demonstrated, and elements involved in long-range interactions are highlighted. Structure prediction of the 5 0 end local structures showed that the U-rich region of most MBFVs (except the YFV clade) forms a duplex with complementary sequences in or near the viral translational starting region ( Figure 1B ). Because this duplex confines the 5 0 UAR/ SLB element between its two strands, we designated it as the UFS. Furthermore, the UFS duplex was predicted to unwind due to the formation of the panhandle structure between the 5 0 and 3 0 ends when long-range interactions between the genome termini were considered (Figure 1-figure supplement 1 and Supplementary file 1). Because the local folding pattern of the 5 0 end and the mode of genome cyclization in the YFV clade are different than those in other MBFVs ( Figure 1B) , the corresponding hairpin including the U-rich region in the YFV clade was recognized as yUFS. Local structures similar to UFS were also identified in ISFVs ( Figure 1B) and Modoc virus (MODV) among the NKVs ( Figure 1B) , whereas the non-vectored Rio Bravo virus (RBV, Figure 1B ) was shown to contain a yUFS structure. The UFS and yUFS in NKVs were also involved in genome cyclization, similar to the corresponding structures in MBFVs. In contrast, the UFS-like structures were not predicted to be involved in genome cyclization in ISFVs, suggesting that the UFS in MBFVs and UFS-like structures in ISFVs function differently. Finally, the UFS/yUFS structure was not identified in TBFVs or in the Yokose virus clade of NKVs; instead, a short hairpin with a large loop occupied the analogous location of the UFS in these viruses (Supplementary file 2). Taken together, the above results demonstrated the conservation of UFS elements among the flavivirus genus and suggested that the secondary structures of UFS elements are affected by genome conformation.
