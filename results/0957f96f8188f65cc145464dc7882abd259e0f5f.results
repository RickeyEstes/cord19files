There were 1343 (64.3%) specimens positive for at least one of the respiratory viruses, 81 (3.9%) specimens positive for more than one respiratory virus, and two specimens positive for three respiratory viruses. Overall, EnV/RhV (19.6%) and IFVA (23.4%) were the two most frequently detected viruses throughout the 4 years. On comparison of the two age groups, viral aetiology was detected significantly more frequently in the younger age group than in the older age group (Table 1) . Specifically, IFVA and IFVB were detected significantly more frequently in the older age group, whereas most of the other non-influenza viruses were more frequently detected in the younger age group, with the exception of CoV, which was detected at similar frequencies in the two age groups. We further stratified the analysis by separating 2009 from the other 3 years, to determine whether the occurrence of the pandemic H1N1 IFVA in 2009 had affected the seasonal pattern of other common respiratory viruses. On comparison with the other 3 years with usual seasonal influenza activities, the detection pattern of other respiratory viruses during 2009 was broadly similar, with most non-influenza viruses being more frequently detected in the younger age group. Important exceptions included CoV and IFVA, which were more frequently detected in the older age group, and IFVB and BoV, for which no significant difference was seen between the two age groups for 2009 (Table S2 ). AdV was more frequently detected in the younger age group in 2009, but not in the other 3 years. Co-detection of more than one virus was, overall, more frequent in the younger age group than in the older age group (5.6% vs. 2.8%) ( Table 1) . For specific viruses, this mainly involved co-detection of EnV/RhV, RSV, PIV, and BoV. After stratification by pandemic (2009) and other years, the codetection pattern was generally preserved, with overall codetection and co-detection of BoV being significant in 2009 but not in the other years, and co-detection of PIV not being significantly different for all years (Table S2) . Among children with positive viral detection, the most frequently reported clinical symptoms at presentation included cough (81.8%), runny nose (83.4%), fever (59.2%), and sputum (55.2%) (data not shown). On comparison of infections with different viruses detected (BoV was excluded here, because there was no detection of BoV in the older age group), fever was reported significantly more often for IFVA (83.2% and 79.7%), IFVB (80.6% and 82.2%) and AdV (82.8% and 75.0%) than for the other viruses, in both age groups (χ 2 , p < 0.001) ( Table 2 ). Cough was more frequent for MPV (100%), BoV (100%) and RSV (96.7%) in the younger age group, and for MPV (97.6%) and IFVA (85.5%) in the older age group (FE, p < 0.001). The presence of a runny nose was most frequent for EnV/RhV in the younger age group (FE, p 0.003), but was not significant in the older age group. Sputum was most frequently reported for RSV (72.2%) in the younger age group, and for MPV (81.0%) in the older age group (χ 2 , p < 0.001). Results from logistic regression suggested that the occurrence of fever was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of influenza virus (IFVA and IFVB) infection vs. infection with other respiratory viruses (OR 4.78, 95% CI 2.96-7.74) in the younger age group. Cough, runny nose and sputum were also associated with an increased likelihood of influenza virus detection in the older age group (Table S2 ). Fig. 1 shows the percentages of all positive specimens attributable to each viral pathogen during different seasons in 2009 and other years. IFVA and EnV/RhV were generally the two most frequently detected pathogens in all seasons. IFVA was most frequently detected in winter, both for 2009 (57.3%, p < 0.001) and for the other years (31.3%, p < 0.005). In fact, in 2009, when the pandemic H1N1 IFVA was predominant, it was responsible for the vast majority of all positive specimens (30.2-57.3%) in different seasons. EnV/RhV was next most frequently detected virus over the whole year, particularly in spring and autumn. RSV was more frequently detected in nonwinter seasons (12.7%) during all years, but this was less marked in 2009. For other viral pathogens, the seasonal patterns were similar and not significantly different. For various meteorological factors, logistic regression results showed that influenza virus was negatively associated with temperature, whereas RSV was positively associated with temperature. EnV/ RhV was positively associated with precipitation, and none of the other viruses was significantly associated with any of the three meteorological factors (Table S3 ).
