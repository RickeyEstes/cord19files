Sensitivity of two-step real-time RT-PCR with SYBR Green I To examine the sensitivity and specificity of HCoV-NL63 detection, viral genomes were extracted from 200 mL diluted supernatant containing 10e1000 pfu/mL HCoV-NL63, and then quantitated using two-step real-time RT-PCR assays. The C t values were 30 for two copies, 27 for 20 copies, and 24 for 200 copies of HCoV-NL63. Melting curve analysis revealed HCoV-NL63 N-specific amplicon melting at 81 C. The PCR products were separated using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis, where a 251-bp band was clearly observed in the PCRs with 20 copies and 200 copies of HCoV-NL63 post gels stained with ethidium bromide. The results indicated that the detection limit of the two-step real-time RT-PCR assay was around 20 copies of HCoV-NL63. In addition, cultured supernatants of coxsackie virus 16, enterovirus 71, and influenza viruses were not detectable using two-step real-time RT-PCR assay with HCoV N-specific primers. Therefore, the two-step real-time RT-PCR assay with HCoV N-specific primers had high sensitivity and specificity, as applicable for high-throughput detection of HCoV-NL63 infection.
