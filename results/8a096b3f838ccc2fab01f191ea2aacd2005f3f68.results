The solution of Eq. (1) for all T above and at criticality is given by the intersection of f A and f B , which can be derived by solving the determinant equation jJ{Ij~0, where I is the identity and J is the Jacobian matrix of Eq. (1). The only possibility to have a non-epidemic regime is that none of the branches of infection spread, i.e. f A~fB~0 . Therefore below and at criticality f A~fB~0 , an evaluation of the Jacobian matrix J ij~( Lf i =Lf j )j fA~fB~0 given by allow us to obtain a quadratic equation for T c with only one stable Disease Spreading in Multiplex Networks solution [38] given by, where k~1z1=T c is the total branching factor and k A , k B are the isolated branching factors of layer A and B respectively. For q?0 we recover the isolated network result T c~1 =(k A {1), which is compatible with our model in which the infection starts in layer A and, because q~0, the disease never reaches layer B. In contrast, Note that T c (q?1)vT c (q?0). In general, T c decreases as a function of q. This is the case because an increase in the overlapping between layers causes an increasing in the dispersion of the degrees of the nodes, therefore the total system becomes more heterogeneous in degree making the total branching factor to increase, i.e., the total branching factor is equal to or bigger than the branching factor of the isolated layers. Figure 2 shows this behavior with a plot of a phase diagram in the plane T{q for Erdös-Rényi (ER) layers [39] whose degree distribution is Poissonian P(k)~SkT k e {SkT =k! and its branching factor is given by k~SkTz1. Figure 2 shows the critical lines T c given by Eq. (3) as a function of the overlapping fraction q when one of the layers is fixed at Sk B T~4 for the different average connectivities Sk A T of layer A. The colored areas correspond to the epidemic-free phase for a given connectivity in layer A, and the region above the critical lines belongs to the epidemic phase. The left and right extremes of the critical lines correspond to the limits q?0 and q?1 for Eq. (3) mentioned above. In the steady state, the fraction of nodes reached by the branches of infection, i.e., the recovered individuals in each layer, can be written and the total fraction of recovered individuals R is given by where j~q ½1{G A 0 (1{Tf A )G B 0 (1{Tf B ) is the fraction of shared nodes that have recovered in the steady state. The factor (2{q) appears because the total number of individuals in the system is (2{q)N. Figure 3 plots the total fraction R of recovered individuals, obtained from Eq. (5), as a function of T for different values of the overlapping fraction q and compares it with In the steady state of the epidemic, the recovered individuals are denoted by orange circles. The branches of infection start in the link denoted by a red arrow, which leads to an infected orange node denoted with a black contour. Two branches expand through the two available links of that node. One of the branches denoted by green dotted lines corresponds to a branch of infection that only spreads through layer A that is described by the first term of f A in Eq. (1) . The other branch denoted in blue dash-dotted lines is a branch of infection that spreads through both layers and is described by the second term of f A in Eq. (1). An analogous interpretation holds for the terms of f B of Eq. (1). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092200.g001 from top to bottom. The limit q?0 corresponds to a disease spreading in layer A when it is isolated and the limit q?1 represents the fully overlapped multiplex network. Colored regions correspond to the epidemic-free phase for each value of Sk A T, while the region above T c corresponds to the epidemic-phase. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092200.g002 ð3Þ simulation results for N~10 5 nodes and 10 5 realizations. Figure 3 shows the results for (a) two ER layers with Sk A T~6 and Sk B T~4 and (b) two power law distributed layers with an exponential cutoff c~20, where P(k)*k {l e {c=k , and exponents l A~2 :5 and l B~3 :5. In both cases we observe the typical second order phase transition of the SIR process with the transmissibility T as the control parameter-with perfect agreement between the theory and the simulations. As the overlapping fraction q increases [see Eq. (3)] the critical threshold moves to the left and the increase in R becomes more abrupt but the second-order character of the SIR for isolated networks is preserved [40] . In the case of the powerlaw distributed layers, when c??, (k A {1)??, which eliminates any dependence of the critical threshold on q, as can be inferred from Eq. (3). Finally we investigate the effect of the overlapping fraction by observing the epidemic in each layer separately, shown in Fig. 4 . When q~1, the threshold [see Eq. (3)] is at its minimum and both layers have the same fraction of recovered nodes. This is the case because the layer with the bigger isolated threshold (or the smaller isolated branching factor) can be infected by either its own infection branches or by those coming from the other layer. This second possibility decreases with q. For lower values of q the epidemic threshold increases because the total branching factor is lower and the layer with the lower isolated threshold cannot as effectively infect the other layer. As a consequence, when TwT c the fraction of recovered individuals of the layers detach from each other and show a difference that increases as q?0 [see Eq. (3)]. In this limit, the joined threshold approaches quadratically the threshold of the isolated layer with the higher branching factor. Thus no matter how small the overlapping fraction is, when q?0 the epidemic threshold of the system is given by the lower isolated threshold that corresponds to the layer with the higher propagation capability. This limit is consistent with the results found in Ref. [24] for the SIS model in which the epidemic threshold of the system is dominated by the layer with the lower isolated threshold. Thus although a system of two completely isolated layers is indistinguishable from a system of two layers that share only a few nodes (q?0), the isolated epidemic threshold of the less propagating layer will change discontinuously and acquire the isolated threshold of the other layer.
