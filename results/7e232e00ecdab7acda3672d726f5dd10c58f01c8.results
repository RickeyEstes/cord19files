From the mixed virus population of a clinical sample, receptor binding variants were isolated by the differential plaque formation in MDCK cells in the presence of trypsin. After 3 plaque passages, 2 plaque variants were obtained: variant I formed fuzzy plaques with a size of 1.5 k 0.4 mm in diameter 80 h p.i. and agglutinated erythrocytes from guinea pigs but not from chicken. Variants I and II differed in their receptor specificity, as shown in Table 1 . Red blood cells from guinea pigs bound all viruses analyzed, whereas untreated chicken cells agglutinated all Hl viruses except for variant I. To further elucidate the receptor specificity, desialylated chicken cells were reconstituted by sialic acid (SA) either in a2,3-or in (~2,6 linkage and then used for virus agglutination. In contrast to variant I, variant II recognizes sialic acid in (~2,6 linkage as do strains PR/8 and WSN. The ability of variant II to utilize SAa2,6Gal sequences agrees with previous findings for other Hl isolates since 1977, which all have this receptor specificity (Rogers and D'Souza, 1989) . On the other hand, since variant I did not bind to either of the resialylated erythrocytes used here, its exact receptor specificity is still unknown. Because of their different receptor specificities, both variants had to be expected to have structurally distinguishable HAS. Therefore, the variants were first analyzed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. The subunit HA, of variant I migrates more slowly than that of variant II (Fig. 1A) . The shift in molecular weight of about 3000 Dalton might be caused by one carbohydrate side chain. Complete removal of carbohydrate by the treatment with endoglycosidase F resulted in HA, subunits (designated as HA;), which are identical in size, indicating that the carbohydrate is responsible for the molecular weight shift (Fig.  1B) . To localize the attachment site for the additional carbohydrate on HA of variant I, the HAS of both variants were compared by RNA sequencing. As only up to 98% of the primary structure could be characterized by the primer extension sequencing method, the residual sequences were determined by cloning and cytidine of the variant I is replaced by uridine. This exchange leads to isoleucine in the amino acid position 133 of the amino acid sequence of variant HA (Fig. 2) . The HA of the variant I possesses a threonine residue at that position, which provides a N-glycosylation signal in combination with the asparagine at position 131. Thus, the HA of the variant II has lost that N-glycosylation site. Both variants contain 6 glycosylation sites at the amino acid positions 21, 33, 95, 158, and 289 on HA, and 154 on HA, not affected by the change of receptor specificity (Fig. 2) . The asparagine at position 20 is not glycosylated (Waterfield et al., 19801 , because of sterical hindrance of the carbohydrate at asparagine,,. By using the primer extension method and T7 sequencing on the cloned gene fragments of both variants, lysine was surprisingly found to be the single amino acid, which connects HA, with HA, (Fig. 21 . We were interested to see whether other Hl viruses, isolated at the same time, also contain lysine at their HA cleavage sites. Therefore, additional virus isolates which we obtained from Tiibingen and Hannover in the same time course between 1985 and 1989, were analyzed at that critical site of HA on the level of vRNA and cDNA. However, only the Tiibingen/l2/85 isolate contained lysine at the HA cleavage site. All HAS of the other human influenza virus isolates analyzed so far, had a single arginine at that position. As a consequence of the unusual HA cleavage site of the A/ Tiibingen/ 12/S isolate, an endoproteinase specific for lysine should activate that influenza virus in vitro, but not-an enzyme specific for arginine. Therefore, HAS of variant II and, as controls, of two other influenza viruses with a corresponding arginine residue at that site were treated with either trypsin or endoproteinase Arg-C from mouse submaxillary gland or endoproteinase Lys-C from Lysobacter enzymogenes, respectively, and thereafter analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 3) . As expected, all viruses were activated by trypsin (Klenk et al., 19751. However, endoproteinase Arg-C did not cleave the HA of the Tiibingen isolate, whereas the HAS of the influenza A virus strains WSN and Virus N with a single arginine at that position were cleaved. Endoproteinase Lys-C degraded the HAS totally and was therefore unsuitable for proteolytic activation.
