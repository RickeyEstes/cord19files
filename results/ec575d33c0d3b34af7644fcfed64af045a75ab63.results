The F protein TM domains are in close proximity and likely form a three-helix bundle The TM domain is not part of the solved crystal structure of either the prefusion form of PIV5 F 7 or the postfusion form of hPIV3 F. 6 Although it is thought likely that the TM domain of F would be αhelical because the hydrophobic packing of an αhelix would aid in spanning a lipid bilayer, this has not been determined. It is also unknown if the TM domains of the PIV5 F monomers interact to form a trimer. It has been shown recently that TM peptides of influenza virus HA associate with each other in model membranes. 33 In the prefusion form of F, HRB forms a three-helix bundle (3-HB) and HRB is separated from the TM domain by only seven residues. Therefore, it seems likely that the F TM domain monomers would be in close proximity in the membrane if not in a 3-HB. We used oxidative disulfide cross-linking to examine the structure of the F TM domain. This method has been used to investigate the arrangement of TM domains for several membrane proteins, such as the Escherichia coli chemoreceptor, [34] [35] [36] the aspartate receptor, 37 the influenza virus M2 ion channel, 38 and CD39. 39, 40 The PIV5 F protein contains 10 disulfide-bonded cysteine residues in the ectodomain and one free cysteine residue in the TM domain. This latter cysteine at residue 492 was mutated to serine, and single-cysteine substitutions were made in the TM domain in this pseudo wild-type (wt) Cys− background. All mutants in the Cys− background were expressed at the cell surface equivalently to pseudo wt F (data not shown). The fusion activity of these mutants was determined by using the luciferase reporter gene assay (Fig. 2) . Most mutants showed fusion activity similar to that of pseudo wt (Cys−, C492S) and wt F protein (denoted as 492). Mutants 485, 486, 488, 497, and 503 exhibited some decrease in fusion activity, with the maximum reduction being ∼ 50% for mutant 486 (see Fig. 2 ). Mutations in the TM domain of influenza virus HA have been shown to affect raft association. 41 However, none of the cysteine substitutions affected raft association of the F protein (data not shown). We examined the effect of oxidative cross-linking of these F TM domain single-cysteine substitutions. For each mutant, there are three available cysteines in each trimer. If these cysteines are oriented toward each other in the membrane and are within disulfide bond-forming distance, two will form a disulfide bond and leave the third cysteine unbonded. On the other hand, if the helices are not specifically interacting, one might expect that high concentrations of oxidants would be required to induce any disulfide formation in the membrane and that there would be no clear pattern for forming disulfides between residues along any one face of the helix. In Fig. 3a are shown untreated F mutants analyzed under nonreducing conditions on a 3.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Disulfide bonds formed by air oxidation should occur only in the extracellular aqueous phase and the headgroup region of the outer leaflet of the bilayer. 38 Air oxidation is much slower in the hydrophobic region of the bilayer, and the reducing intracellular environment minimizes air oxidation on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Cysteine residues in the outer leaflet Each residue of the F protein TM domain was substituted with cysteine in a background in which the naturally occurring cysteine residue 492 was mutated to serine. The luciferase reporter gene assay was used to measure cell-cell fusion mediated by the single cysteine mutants in the Cys− background (pseudo wt). Vero cells were cotransfected to express HN, pseudo wt F or mutant F protein, and a luciferase reporter construct. Shown is the average of three experiments each done in triplicate and normalized to pseudo wt Cys− F. of the bilayer at positions 485, 486, 487, and 489 did form disulfide bonds, indicating the individual F TM domains are in close proximity to themselves and that these positions occur near the head-group region of the outer leaflet of the bilayer. The data are in very good agreement with the expected orientations of the TM helices, as inferred from deletion mutagenesis and crystallographic analysis of the protein. In the prefusion structure of F residues 446 to 476 form a three-stranded coiled coil. Not in the atomic structure is a short linker that connects to the TM domain near residues 485. Four residues (481-484) can be deleted with full retention of function, while a two-residue deletion (483-484) caused a decrease in fusogenic activity. 10, 42 More strikingly, deletion of eight residues (477-484), which compose the end of the coiled coil and the entire linker, leads to nearly full retention of fusogenic activity, while deletion of only six residues (479-484) leads to a protein that is less well-expressed on the cell surface and highly inactive in fusion. 10 Interestingly, if the HRB coiled coil continues into the TM region, the four-residue and eight-residue mutants would position the side chains of residues 485 and 486 in close proximity, consistent with their high level of crosslinking in Fig. 3a (see also Supplemental Fig. 2 ). On the other hand, there would be a strong mismatch between the axial rotation of the helical axes in the HRB coiled coil versus the TM bundle in the sixresidue deletion mutant, explaining its lack of stability and function. Cu(II)(1,10-phenanthroline) 3 (CuP) was used to induce disulfide cross-linking within the lipid interior, 38, 43 which is otherwise resistant to oxidation. When the F TM mutants were treated with 3 mM (final concentration) of CuP for 10 min at 37°C, more extensive disulfide cross-linking was observed (Fig. 3b ). Under conditions required to induce oxidation of the membrane-spanning regions, much more extensive cross-linking is observed in the aqueous-accessible region (residues 485-491). Within the TM region, residues 493, 494, 496, 498, 501, 504, 506, and 508 all showed disulfide bond formation. CuP (3 mM) was also added at 4, 10, and 22°C for 10 min (data not shown). All residues near the ectodomain (485-491, 493, 494) formed disulfide bonds at all temperatures, even at 4°C. Mutants that formed disulfide bonds after treatment with 3 mM CuP for 10 min at 37°C also formed disulfide bonds when treatment with 3 mM CuP was for 1 or 5 min (data not shown). The effect of cross-linking on fusion could not be determined after oxidation due to the toxicity of the CuP on the live cells that are required for the fusion assays (data not shown). Cross-linking occurs in a pattern suggestive of that of a helical bundle. Even at a qualitative level, it is clear that the extent of cross-linking follows the same periodicity as that of an α-helix (approximately 3.6 residues per turn), suggesting that one face of the helix interacts in the core of a bundle. Furthermore, the extent of cross-linking under these conditions is similar to that observed with previously characterized membrane proteins of known three-dimensional structure, suggesting that the TM domain folds into a well-defined structure. 38, 43 One unusual feature, however, is that three consecutive residues near the outer leaflet of the bilayer (489-491) form cross-links quite efficiently, suggesting some malleability in this region of the protein. To better determine the nature of the interface, the extent of disulfide cross-linking was quantified and fit to a sine wave. The raw CuP crosslinking data were normalized by dividing the amount of disulfide formed by the total amount of protein (disulfide linked plus not linked). The CuP data at 37°C were used for most of the TM domain, positions 492-509. Because cross-linking was stronger in the outer leaflet of the bilayer, low-temperature (4°C) CuP data were used for residue positions 485-491 so that data from the two regions would be on the same scale (and to maintain linearity of the image plate response to radioactivity). This type of approach was previously used to model the structure of the TM domain of the influenza virus M2 protein, 38 where a similar level of cross-linking was observed. It was considered that the disulfide cross-linking could occur between two trimers. However, when more than 100-fold different amounts of F protein were expressed, there was no change in the level of cross-linking as would be expected to occur for intertrimer cross-links (data not shown). In addition, higher molecular weight species of trimer-trimer formation, in addition to cross-links within a trimer, were not observed on gels (data not shown). Further, the extensive nature of the cross-links for some mutants and not others argues for cross-links within the TM domains within a trimer. Examination of the F TM domain data showed that the cross-linking efficiency oscillated as a function of the sequence position with approximately the same periodicity as the α-helix (3.6 residues per turn). However, G497 deviated from this trend, showing a lower degree of cross-linking than expected. Given the unusual characteristics of glycine residues, residue 497 was removed from the calculation and separate fits were made to the data before and after this residue. The periodicity was also indicative of a helical conformation (residues 485-496: 3.65 ± 0.18 residues per turn; residues 498-509: 3.40 ± 0.21 Polypeptides were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 3.5% acrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions. (b) Cells were transfected and labeled as above, Dounce homogenized, and treated with 3 mM CuP for 10 min at 37°C. Samples were then solubilized, immunoprecipitated with an anti-F2 PAb, and polypeptides were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 3.5% acrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions. Circled residues indicate interacting residues in the predicted helix. (c) Periodicity of the predicted TM domain helix. The raw CuP cross-linking data in (b) were normalized by dividing the amount of disulfide formed by the total amount of protein. Also shown is the sine wave fit of the data. The data obtained with oxidation occurring at 4°C were used for residue positions 485-491, and the data obtained with oxidation occurring at 37°C data were used for the remaining positions (492-509). This was done to compensate for the greater disulfide bond formation that takes place in the outer leaflet and to maintain the signal on the image plate used to detect radioactivity within the linear range. (d) Ideal helix (left) and pi bulge (right) models of the TM helices. Interface positions predicted from disulfide cross-linking are shown in green spheres. For the first model, the TM domain is predicted to form a helix with a pi bulge at residues 497-500 (arrow). (e) Model of the TM helix trimer containing a pi bulge (in green). On the left is a view from within the membrane and on the right is a view from above. As in (d), interface positions are shown in green spheres. (f) Model of the TM trimer containing a stutter (in red). On the left is a view from within the membrane and on the right is a view from above. Interface C β positions for the model are shown in red spheres (C α shown for G497). residues per turn; Fig. 3c ). The pattern is interrupted by the insertion of one residue near residue 497. Thus, the fit parameters suggest a packed helical TM interface made up of residues 486, 489, 493, 501, 504, and 508 (circled in Fig. 3b ) with a potential distortion to the helix around residue 497. To create models for the TM region, we assume it forms a trimeric bundle and that efficient crosslinking occurred only at residues close together in the three-dimensional structure. One way to allow insertion of a single residue into α-helices is by inserting a pi bulge. 44, 45 Figure 3d shows an example of a 3-fold symmetric bundle created by using the backbone of a TM helix containing a pi bulge from the Nadependent aspartate transporter structure (Protein Data Bank code 2nwl, 2.96 Å). 46 The sequence of the TM region of F was threaded onto this backbone, and Gly497 was positioned within the pi bulge. The effect of a pi bulge on the positioning of the residues that cross-link efficiently (when mutated to Cys) can be seen by comparing it to the result expected for an ideal helix and without a pi bulge (Fig. 3d ). The pi bulge allows both the interfaces above and below the bulge to occur on the same face of the helix. A bundle was created from this helix by applying C3 symmetry followed by energy minimization (Fig. 3e) . A second way insertions are accommodated in coiled coils is by variation of the helix packing in a common structural motif known as a "stutter." 47 A geometric model incorporating this insertion was created by correlating the cross-linking data with the C α distances of the trimeric coiled coil from influenza virus HA. As the stutters in HA result in different local distortions, 48 pre-and postfusion HA structures 49, 50 were searched for one that matched the cross-linking data as described in Supplemental Methods. Threading the sequence of the TM helix onto this backbone template gave a model in good qualitative agreement with the cross-linking data (Fig. 3f ). In summary, the cross-linking data show good evidence to support the formation of a 3-HB, and stereochemically reasonable bundles can be constructed that are consistent with the data.
