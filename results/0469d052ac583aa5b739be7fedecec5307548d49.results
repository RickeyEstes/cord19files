Respondents (47% male) were classified into five age categories: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-59, 60 years and above. Overall, 63% were married, and 42% had at least 1 child. In total, 19% had no educational qualifications, 51% had high school diplomas, and 29% had university degrees ( Table 1) . Table 2 summarizes the respondents' self-evaluated knowledge of infectious diseases and their level of anxiety. AIDS was the most well-known infectious disease since 93% of respondents confirmed they had adequate knowledge of it. Avian influenza was second (75%). The percentage of subjects with adequate knowledge of avian influenza was even higher among those who worked with animals (78%), had children (79%) and lived in the Ain district (88%), an area in France where avian influenza epidemic had previously been reported [8] (data not shown). Meningitis came in third (68%), followed by viral hepatitis (56%) and nosocomial infections (48%). In total, 40% of respondents indicated they had no knowledge of SARS. With regard to the anxiety generated by the abovementioned diseases, 63% expressed concern about nosocomial infections, 61% about AIDS, 59% about meningitis and 46% about viral hepatitis. The reported anxiety of meningitis was significantly higher among subjects who had children (66%). The extent of anxiety of SARS and avian flu was in general lower, with 42% and 39%, respectively, expressing concern about these diseases. Analysis by gender indicated that, except for nosocomial infections, women were significantly more worried than men (data not included). Over 60% of women reported feeling anxious about all the infectious diseases mentioned, compared to 35% of men on average. A higher level of anxiety for nosocomial infections and SARS was associated with lower socio-economic status (68% vs 63% on average and 48% versus 42% on average respectively). Table 3 enumerates the self-reported knowledge of infectious diseases by gender, age categories and socioeconomic status as well as items considered to be a major threat for the study population. Women were generally better informed than men. Knowledge about nosocomial infections was significantly higher among older subjects (>60 years old), compared to other age categories, while 18-to 34-year-olds were significantly more familiar with AIDS. Knowledge of meningitis was significantly higher among 35-to 44-year-olds. Respondents belonging to lower socio-economic classes had significantly less knowledge of nosocomial infections and viral hepatitis. Cancers were reported as the most important threat for the study population (74%) followed by diseases related to atmospheric pollution (62%), unemployment (50%) and terrorism (46%). Epidemics were perceived as a real risk by 27% of respondents. All subjects who indicated they had knowledge of avian influenza (n = 567, 88%) were invited to answer questions about its routes of transmission, their individual behaviours at the time of the outbreak in certain poultry farms in France, and their opinions about measures taken by French health authorities (Table 4 ). Contact with contaminated poultry was the main transmission route (n = 459, 81%) cited. Most respondents (n = 430, 76%) did not consider poultry or egg consumption a route of transmission, but their opinions about possible transmission by close contact with contaminated individuals were more equivocal. Overall, 36% (41% of males) believed that avian influenza could undergo inter-human transmission, while 54% said the opposite (65% in high socio-economic categories). Overall, behavioural changes were more significant among women. Only a small percentage indicated that they had stopped eating poultry (n = 113, 20%) or avoided travelling to countries at risk (n = 107, 19%) or to places such as farms where the risk of contamination was high (n = 96, 17%). The percentage of subjects who avoided travelling was greater among those aged 45 years and over (24%) and among women (22%). An even smaller percentage (n = 28, 5%) indicated they had consulted a physician or bought antiviral drugs (n = 23, 4%). The percentage was higher (7%) among the elderly (>60 years old) and subjects belonging to lower socio-economic categories (9%). The behavioural changes were still in effect at the time of the survey but in a smaller proportion, suggesting that the media had influenced the population's attitude. Of the 82% (n = 465) who indicated they were aware of the decisions taken by the French authorities during the avian influenza epizootic, 68% approved them. The degree of approval was even higher (79%) among subjects over 60 years of age. Moreover, 76% of respondents expressed their solidarity with the professions involved, such as poultry stockbreeders. When asked about their possible behaviours during official announcement of a highly contagious disease in France, almost all respondents said they would follow the advice of their physician (96%) or the public authorities (92%) ( Table 5 ). The rate rose to 97% in higher socio-economic categories. Approximately 80% said they would buy existing drugs. Fewer than 50% indicated that they would avoid contact with others (30%) or leave the country (12%). Most subjects stated that they would follow the preventive measures announced by public authorities. As a result, 96% would accept being quarantined, 91% would wear a mask in public places, and 97% would wash their hands more than 10 times a day. A large percentage (83%) would also encourage their friends and family to comply with the official recommendations. However, only 21% (27% among 45-to 59-year-olds) would report those who did not follow preventive measures. In terms of trusted sources of information in case of occurrence of a highly contagious disease, respondents were mostly confident in their physicians (97%) and scientists (89%), followed by the Ministry of Health (68%). The study population had strong reservations about politicians, deputies and the media, and under 10% said they would not fully trust them (Figure 1 ).
