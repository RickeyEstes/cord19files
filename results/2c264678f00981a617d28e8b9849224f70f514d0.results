We illustrate some of the key findings using numerical simulations. We assume the parameter values b ¼ 5; d ¼ 3; e ¼ 0:5; f ¼ 5; g ¼ 2:5; h ¼ 0:1; m ¼ 2; j ¼ 0:4; k ¼ 0:1; l ¼ 0:01; c ¼ 3, which remain unchanged for all numerical simulations. The main goal of this paper is to investigate the effects of infection rate a as well as the effects of different types of interactions for different values of a and b. For a ¼ 1:6 and a ¼ 1:36; b ¼ 0:98 we obtain the positive interior equilibrium point E Ã ð0:5371; 0:1585; 0:1198; 11:1964Þ. For the above set of parameter values we have r 1 ¼ 0:2504 > 0; r 4 ¼ 0:0016 > 0; r 1 r 2 À r 3 ¼ 0:0367 > 0 and r 3 ðr 1 r 2 À r 3 Þ À r 4 r 2 1 ¼ 0:0000203 > 0 which implies that the system (2) is locally asymptotically stable around positive equilibrium E Ã . We have shown system's dynamics for different values of a; b and infection rate a in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. From Fig. 2 and   Fig. 3 , we observe that the system (2) have periodic oscillations as well as chaotic bands for different general Holling parameters and infection rate. From Figs. 4 and 5, we observe limit cycle, period-2 to period-7 and chaotic dynamics. The global stability behaviour of the system (2) with different initial conditions is presented in Fig. 6 for different Holling parameter values a and b. Therefore, oscillatory as well as stability nature of the diseased prey population can be captured for a range of Holling parameter values. Das et al. [28] observed chaotic dynamics of the system (2) for a ¼ 1:15, the period-doubling for a ¼ 1:17, the limit cycle oscillation for a ¼ 1:2 and finally stable steady state distribution of all four species for a ¼ 1:3 for a particular value of a ¼ 1 and b ¼ 1 using above set of parameter values. Here we have investigated the dynamics for a ¼ 1:15 with different Holling interactions through bifurcation analysis.
