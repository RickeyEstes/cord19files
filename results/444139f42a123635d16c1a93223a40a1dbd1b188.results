According to the SIM, 20 of 42 patients in the CPV-affected group were considered to have a metabolic acidosis, 10/42 had a metabolic alkalosis and in 12/42 patients the overall effect was neutralizing. Of the 20 patients affected with metabolic acidosis, all had a SID acidosis and within this group, 19 had a concurrent A tot alkalosis and one had a mild A tot acidosis, due to mild hyperphosphataemia (Fig. 1a) . Of the individuals with metabolic alkalosis, 9/10 had a SID alkalosis and 1/10 had a SID acidosis. All 10 patients had a concurrent A tot alkalosis (Fig. 1b) . Within the neutralizing group, 8/12 had a SID acidosis, with all eight of these having an A tot alkalosis. The remaining four dogs had a SID alkalosis and, within this group, two had an A tot alkalosis, with the remaining two having an A tot acidosis (Fig. 1c) . From these data, it was concluded that the dominant metabolic acid-base change was an acidosis, characterised by a SID acidosis, which was partially offset by a concurrent A tot alkalosis, due to hypoalbuminaemia. The sum of all the components was not noticeably different from the control group, due to a wide range of possible outcomes in the CPV-affected group and similar medians (Table 1) . Sodium, chloride (not corrected) and albumin were significantly lower in the CPV-affected group (Table 1) . When chloride was corrected for changes in free water, the value was not significantly different from the control population and neither was the chloride effect. When each of the variables used in the quantitative assessment were correlated with the sum of all the effects, the strongest correlation was seen with the chloride effect (Fig. 2) . None of the other variables correlated significantly with the sum of all the effects. Furthermore, when each of the SIM variables were statistically compared, according to clinical disease severity, a significant difference was noted within the chloride effect (Fig. 3) , where mildly-affected puppies tended to have a hyperchloraemic acidosis and severely-affected puppies had a hypochloraemic alkalosis. According to these findings, and those of the Spearman's rank correlation, knowledge of the chloride effect most consistently predicted the outcome of the metabolic compartment in CPV-affected dogs according to the SIM. According to the SM, the SID 4 of the CPV-affected group was 35 ± 3.0 mEq/L, compared to 39.2 ± 6 mEq/L for the control group and 39 mEq/L, experimentally determined by Constable and Stampfli (2005) . The difference was significant for the CPV-affected group compared to the control group (P = 0.01). A tot of the CPV-affected group, using albumin alone, was 8.9 ± 2.9 mEq/L, compared to 10.5 ± 1.5 mEq/L for the control dogs and 15.8 mEq/L (Constable and Stampfli, 2005) . This difference between CPV-affected dogs and the controls was significant (P < 0.005). When the diagnoses were categorised (A-D), using the simplified method (based on comparison to the experimental values), and the outcomes using this method compared to the diagnosis using the base excess algorithm, there was good agreement between the two models (kappa = 0.72). When A tot was calculated from total protein (A tot-tp ), the value was 12.58 ± 2.3 mEq/L and 14.6 ± 1.8 mEq/L for the CPV-affected and control dogs, respectively (P = 0.006). When the diagnostic outcomes were performed using the A tot-tp instead of A tot-alb (compared to experimental values) and compared to the base excess algorithm, the diagnosis only changed in two cases (A tot normal), and there was still good agreement between the two models (kappa = 0.71).
