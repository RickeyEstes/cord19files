Fig. 2 shows the number of potentially eligible articles by year. Not surprisingly, the number of studies that investigated health-related misinformation increased over the years, from 7 in 2012 to 41 in 2018 (November) with a sharp rise in 2017. The trend implied the growing scholarly interest in the social phenomenon, potentially amplified by major political events in 2016. We exclude certain articles (n = 74) due to their lack of analysis or interpretation of misinformation as mentioned above, and the remainder of this result section relates only to the 57 remaining papers after full-text analysis. Key features of the studies included are in the web appendix. We first investigated what health-related topics have been studied in relation to misinformation. The largest category relates to communicable diseases (n = 30), including vaccination in general (8) and specifically against Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) and influenza (3, 2 and 1 respectively), as well as infections with Zika virus (9), Ebola (4), influenza (1), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (1) and Nile Virus (1). Many articles concern chronic noncommunicable diseases such as cancer (3), cardiovascular disease (3), psoriasis (1) and bowel disease (1). Some also address issues of diet and nutrition (3), smoking (3) and water safety or quality (2). Five studies cover a broad range of health-related misinformation or rumour online, while the remaining studies were placed in a miscellaneous category, addressing other specific diseases, health problems or medical interventions (Fig. 3) . We now briefly describe each of these in turn. 3.1. Health-related issues and findings
