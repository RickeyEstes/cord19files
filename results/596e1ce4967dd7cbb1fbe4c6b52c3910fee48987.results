In total, 1,984 HCWs received detailed information about the Impact of SARS Study and 769 (39%) completed survey A. The interval between the last SARS patient discharged or deceased and study participation was 13-25 (median 19) months. To determine how representative participants were of all eligible hospital staff, after the Impact of SARS Study a representativeness study was presented to 258 Toronto HCWs who had been eligible; it was completed by 255 (99%) of these HCWs. Exposure to SARS patients was more common in HCWs who participated in the Impact of SARS Study than those who did not. However, study par-ticipants and nonparticipants did not differ in age range, job type, years of healthcare experience, or overall subjective impact of SARS on their lives (Table 2) . Of the 769 participants, 73.5% were nurses (69.4% staff nurse, 3.1% manager or educator, 1.0% infection control practitioner). The next most prevalent job types were clerical staff (8.3%), physicians (2.9%), and respiratory therapists (2.3%). The remaining 99 participants (12.9%) were distributed among 14 different job types. Other characteristics of study participants, by city of employment, are presented in Table 3 . Most Toronto participants (71.6%) reported contact with SARS patients, and Toronto participants were much more likely than Hamilton participants to have experienced quarantine (47.9% vs. 1.6%, p<0.001), which confirms the anticipated difference in SARS-related experience between comparison groups. A higher proportion of Hamilton participants were nurses (Hamilton 84.1% nurses vs. Toronto 71.2%, p = 0.001). Survey B was completed by 187 HCWs (survey A and B participants). Survey A and B participants did not differ significantly from participants who only completed survey A by sex, job type (nurse or other), or city of employment. Survey A and B participants were older (mean 45 ± standard deviation 9 years vs. 41 ± 10 years, p<0.001) and more experienced in healthcare work (21 ± 10 years versus 16 ± 10 years, p<0.001). Survey A-only participants and Survey A and B participants did not differ with respect to exposure to SARS patients, working >5 shifts in intensive care unit, emergency department or SARS isolation unit during the outbreak or with respect to traumatic stress symptoms, psychological distress, or burnout. During the study period (13-25 months after the SARS outbreak), Toronto HCWs reported significantly higher levels of burnout (Toronto median score 19, interquartile range 10-29; Hamilton 16, 9-23, p = 0.019), psychologi-cal distress (Toronto 15, 12-19; Hamilton 13, 11-17, p<0.001), and posttraumatic stress (Toronto 11, 4-21; Hamilton 7, 0-19, p<0.001). To make these differences more clinically meaningful, the prevalence of high scores was calculated (Table 4 ). The prevalence of the following functional indicators of distress since the SARS outbreak was higher in Toronto HCWs: decrease in patient contact and work hours, increase in substance use and other traits that interfere with function, and more days off work (Table  4 ). Of the 7 adverse outcomes reported in Table 4 , Toronto HCWs were more likely to be experiencing >1 problem (Toronto 68.1% vs. Hamilton 50.1%, p<0.001)) and were almost twice as likely to be experiencing multiple (>2) problems (Toronto 44.0% vs. Hamilton 22.5%, p<0.001). Personal and occupational characteristics of participants and the relationship of these variables to adverse outcomes are shown in Tables 5 and 6 . Univariate relationships significant at the level of p<0.05 were retained for stepwise regression analysis to determine which of these variables accounted for significant variance in each adverse outcome (Table 7) . Maladaptive coping and perceived adequacy of training together with protection and support explained 18% of the variance in burnout. The same 2 variables explained 21% of the variance in posttraumatic stress. Maladaptive coping and attachment anxiety, together with a protective effect of experience in healthcare, explained 31% of the variance in psychological distress. Finally, the functional impact of vulnerability factors on the full survey A sample was tested by using duration of perceived risk after SARS as a proxy for the SARS-related vulnerability factors identified in the regression analysis. Duration of post-SARS perceived risk was correlated with maladaptive coping (Spearman ρ = 0.28, p = 0.001) and perceived adequacy of training, protection, and sup-
