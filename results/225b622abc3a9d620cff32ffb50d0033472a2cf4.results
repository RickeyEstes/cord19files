For the 50 diarrheal samples from Okinawa, 25 (50.0%) were C. parvum antigen-positive, 14 (28.0%) were rotavirus antigenpositive, one (2.3%) was coronavirus-positive, and two (4.7%) were E. coli K99 antigen-positive. Eight samples were positive for both C. parvum and rotavirus, and one was positive for both C. parvum and coronavirus. The properties of the diarrheal samples are summarized in Fig. 2 , and watery stools were significantly correlated (p b 0.05) with C. parvum infections (Table 3) . Among the samples from Okinawa, the OPG values ranged from 12 to 4.5 Ã— 10 4 . Cryptosporidium oocysts were not found in seven of the samples although they were positive for C. parvum antigen (Ishigakijima Island; Table 1 ). No significant difference was observed in OPG values between C. parvum single infections and mixed infections with rotavirus (Fig. 3) . Eimeria spp. oocysts were detected in three calves from Okinawa (Table 1) . SSUrRNA and GP60 genes were analyzed for accurate species identification and for subtyping analysis, respectively, and PCR amplicons were obtained from 29 and 20 samples in the both targeting regions ( Table 2 ). The SSUrRNA gene was amplified in one sample from Ishigakijima Island, two samples from Iriomotejima Island, and one sample with no location data, even though all were negative for C. parvum antigen. In contrast, GP60 gene was not amplifiable from three Ishigakijima Island samples despite being positive for C. parvum antigen. Surprisingly, we could not obtain a GP60 amplicon from one sample from Kuroshima Island and another sample with no location data, although both were C. parvum antigen-and oocyst-positive. However, the two DNA target sequences were successfully amplified from the 25 samples from Hokkaido ( Table 2) . The nucleotide sequences of all the 786-bp SSUrRNA PCR amplicons from the two prefectures were identical to that of the C. parvum sequence deposited in GenBank (accession no. AB746195). The nucleotide sequences of all the GP60 PCR amplicons (925bp) were also identical to each other, and shared 100% similarity values with the IIaA15G2R1 subtype sequence deposited in GenBank (Fig. 4) . Nucleotide sequences representative of the SSUrRNA and GP60 genes have been deposited in GenBank under accession nos. AB968045 to AB968048.
