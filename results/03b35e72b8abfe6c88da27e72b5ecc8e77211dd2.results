A total of 168 rabbit fecal samples from various sources were included in the final analysis: 86 pooled commercial meat, 54 companion, 14 pooled laboratory, and 14 shelter animals. Twenty-three samples (14 commercial meat, 8 companion, and 1 shelter) were not included in the final analysis either due to an inability to produce bands following DNA extraction, amplification, and purification, an insufficient quantity of DNA within the sample (< 12.5 nM) at the time of normalization prior to sequencing or an insufficient number of sequences (< 5000) present following the completion of all quality control filters. A total of 10,897,154 V4 16S rRNA gene sequences passed all quality control filters. Sequence numbers per sample ranged from 6359 to 325,029, with a mean of 64,864, median of 53,721, and a standard deviation of 46,279.
