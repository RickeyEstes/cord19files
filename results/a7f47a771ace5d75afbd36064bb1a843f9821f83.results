At smaller population sizes, all parameters had a substantial impact on an invading strain's probability to persist (figure 2), generally, a steeper gradient and magnitude of change across the range of parameter values in smaller market sizes. When N was 5000 and h was 0.1, the probability of persistence was approximately 0.98, when h was increased to 1.2, the probability of persistence decreased to approximately 0.25 (74%). However, when N was 15 000 and h was 0.1 and the probability of persistence was 1. When the h was 1.2 the probability of persistence was 0.7 (a 30% decrease) (figure 2). Differences in the probability of persistence across the parameters were least substantial when looking at h, suggesting assumed values of viral decay rate may be a less important driver of persistence relative to the other parameters examined. By contrast, for any given N, the greatest variation in the probability of persistence was seen for v (figure 2; electronic supplementary material, figure S4 ). Market turnover rate and hence average daily market population size played a key role in determining the probability of persistence. For our baseline parameters (electronic supplementary material, table S1) and an instantaneous market turnover rate of 50%, a sigmoidal relationship between the probability of persistence and CCS was observed (electronic supplementary material, figure S5a). Following increases in the population size above 11 800, no further marked increases in the probability of persistence were seen, suggesting the CCS for a single strain in this scenario was approximately 11 800 birds (figure 3a), with a corresponding R 0 of 1.01 (electronic supplementary material, table S3). Assuming the baseline parameter values but where 50% of birds were sold gradually on a daily basis the estimated CCS was approximately 19 800 (figure 3c; electronic supplementary material, figure S5c), a 68% increase in the CCS compared with instantaneous turnover. As the market turnover rate increased, and hence the average duration of stay for a bird within the market decreased, the estimated CCS also increased (figure 3a). For our baseline parameters and an instantaneous market turnover rate of 10% (electronic supplementary material, table S1), the CCS was Figure 3 . The CCS estimated through simulation analysis for 1000 realizations, for a range of market turnover rates.

(b) Estimated CCS for the co-infecting strains across a range of instantaneous market turnover rates for the baseline parameters (red), when transmissibility of a single founding strain was increased by 75% (green), when the transmissibility of the co-infecting strain was reduced by 25% ( purple).

R. Soc. B 284: 20170715 200 birds (R 0 1.67), when 10% of the market population was sold gradually the CCS was approximately 250, a 25% increase in the estimated CCS. If an instantaneous market turnover rate of 90% was assumed the estimated CCS was approximately 120 000 birds, but if 90% were sold gradually the estimated CCS was approximately 400 000 birds (figure 3b), a 233% increase in the estimated CCS. As the transmissibility, viral decay and shedding rates, and duration of infection for a single strain increased by 75% from the baseline values (electronic supplementary material, table S1), the CCS at any given rate of market turnover was reduced ( figure 3a,c) . However, if transmissibility of the strain was increased by 75%, the estimated CCS was approximately 3500 birds (R 0 1.32, electronic supplementary material, table S3) (figure 3a). As with the baseline parameters, estimates of the CCS with gradual turnover were consistently higher than with instantaneous turnover, however, the proportional differences in the CCS between turnover frequencies were consistent when parameter values were increased by 75% ( figure 3 ).
