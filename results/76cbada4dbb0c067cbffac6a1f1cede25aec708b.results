The total number of patients who visited the ED during the MERS epidemic period ( Table 1 ). Fig. 2 shows a significant decrease in ED visits from June 1 to July 31, 2015 in comparison to the same period in 2013 and 2014. While the number of total pediatric patients in 2015 decreased, the proportions of infants (1.8%) and school-age children (4.8%) increased compared to those of the previous two years ( Table 1) . The most common symptom during the MERS period was fever (adult patients: 9.9%, pediatric patients: 31.5%). The most common diagnosis in adults was acute gastroenteritis (30.0%), followed by headache (7.5%) and dizziness (7.5%). The most common diagnosis in pediatric patients was acute gastroenteritis (19.0%), followed by acute pharyngitis (14.0%) and upper respiratory infection (6.0%). The most common symptom during the same period in 2013 was abdominal pain (8.7%) in the adult emergency room (AER) and fever (34.0%) in the pediatric emergency room (PER). For the same period in 2014, the most common symptom was also abdominal pain (9.7%) in the AER and fever (30.8%) in the PER. For 2013, the most common diagnosis in adults was acute gastroenteritis (22.4%) and for 2014 it was also acute gastroenteritis (15.3%). For 2014, the most common diagnosis for pediatric patients was acute pharyngitis (13.6%) and for 2014 it was upper respiratory infection (24.1%). More patients were admitted to the ED by ambulance in 2015 compared to the 2013-2014 period in both the adult and the pediatric groups. The proportion of ESI level 1-3 increased in both adults (0.5%) and children (6.0%) and this change was statistically significant only in pediatric patients (P < 0.001). The number of adult patients who visited the ED due to illness increased, whereas the number who visited due to trauma decreased (1.4%). In children, these changes were diametrically opposite; proportion of visit due to trauma increased by 4.1% (P < 0.001). More adult (1.3%) and pediatric (7.2%) patients were admitted compared to the 2013-2014 periods. The EDLOS of hospitalized patients was significantly reduced in both adult (2.7 hours) and pediatric (1.8 hours) patients (Table 2) .
