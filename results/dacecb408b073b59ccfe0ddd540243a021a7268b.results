Temporal-spatial trends in the adoption of lunatic asylum facilities in French départements from 1617 to 1981 Fig. 1 shows the time trend in the proportion of départements adopting the asylum model of care (i.e. for each year, the proportion of départements that had established at least one asylum). The diffusion of these psychiatric institutions through France lasted almost 400 years, from 1617 to 1981. As shown on Fig. 1 , the diffusion process is still incomplete, because eight départements out of 95 have never had a specialised, public sector psychiatric hospital, whereas the 'deinstitutionalisation' of psychiatric care began in the 1960s with the introduction of acute psychiatric units for the provision of care within general hospital structures. Four of these eight départements had been accommodating people with mental disorders in specialised wards in general hospitals since the 19th century. The other four départements had never previously provided a specialised public hospital service for mentally ill patients but currently provide acute psychiatric beds in multi-specialty hospitals. The general form of the curve is consistent with the typical pattern of development of innovation diffusion processes. The curve is similar to an 'S-shaped' logistic form, apart from a perturbation caused by the resumption of new adoptions after the 1940s, as registration of new hospitals recommenced in France after a hiatus during World War II. Particularly notable is the absence of any change in the trend associated with the introduction of the 1838 Act. The rate of innovation had started to progress most rapidly well before this date, and the rate of diffusion of the asylum model across départements in France actually slowed down shortly after the 1838 Act was passed. Therefore, it seems that at most the Act only confirmed a pre-existing trend of introducing the process, but there is no evidence that it led to its acceleration. As is typical of diffusion processes, four main phases in the introduction of French asylums can be identified, similar to the stages of 'emergence', 'expansion', 'consolidation' and 'new expansion' proposed by Hägerstrand (1953) . These are marked on Fig. 1 and the départements involved in each phase are plotted on the maps in Fig. 2 . Details of the type of locality in which the new institutions were set up are also given in Table 2 .
