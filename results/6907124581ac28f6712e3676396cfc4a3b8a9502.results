SSEA-1 and -3 positive cells are present at the wound site after skin injury. Since fibroblasts become activated and proliferate 32 , and several types of hematopoietic cells infiltrate into the wound site 33 during healing, we are interested here to examine whether SSEA-positive multipotent stem cells are present in the wound site after injury. Skin wounds were created by full-thickness punch biopsy in mice. SSEA-1, a marker for various types of endogenous multipotent stem cells 30, 34, 35 , ESC and iPSC 36 , was used to detect multipotent stem cells. Indeed, we were able to detect SSEA-1 positive cells in wounded skin but not normal skin (Fig. 1A) . After isolating single cells from wounded or normal skin of mice by collagenase, staining with SSEA-1 antibody, and analyzing by flow cytometry, we detected a significantly higher number of SSEA-1 positive cells in isolated skin cells from wounded skin, as compared to those from normal skin (9.26 ± 2.84% vs 0.37 ± 0.15%, P < 0.01, Fig. 1B ). When cells isolated from either wounded or normal skin were cultured in a medium containing M-CSF for 48 hrs, and then stained with SSEA-1 antibody, we confirmed SSEA-1 positive cells could indeed be isolated from wounded but not normal skin (Fig. 1C) . Taken together, these data imply that SSEA-1 positive multipotent stem cells are present in the wound site after injury. To further demonstrate that SSEA-1 positive cells in wound site are the same type of multipotent stem cells as described by our previous in vitro study 24 , we examined another marker, SSEA-3, which a number of studies have indicated as a marker for murine multipotent stem cells [36] [37] [38] . As expected, by using immunofluorescence staining we have here revealed that these SSEA-1 positive cells in wounded skin are also SSEA-3 positive ( Fig. 2A) . To further confirm SSEA-1 positive cells in wounded skin are the same type of stem cells induced by M-CSF as previously reported 24 , we examined the expression of the M-CSF receptor in SSEA-1 positive cells by staining wounded skin with both antibodies. As expected, we found the SSEA-1 positive cells are collocated with the M-CSF receptor in wounded skin (Fig. 2B) , suggesting SSEA-positive stem cells in wounded skin are the same type of stem cells derived from hematopoietic cells, as previously reported. To study whether SSEA-positive cells were proliferating, we stained wounded skin with SSEA-1 antibody and a proliferation marker, the antigen Ki67. Figure S1A We then compared the expression of SSEA-1 or SSEA-3 positive cells in wounds of seven days and fourteen days after injury. In our skin injury model, the wounds are usually healed around day ten after injury. Thus, wounds at day seven after injury represent unhealed wounds while wounds at day fourteen after injury represent healed wounds. As shown in Fig. 3A ,B, when skin wounds are completely healed (as shown here on day fourteen) SSEA-1 or SSEA-3 positive cells are markedly reduced or absent at the wound site. To quantify the expression of SSEA-1, we measured the ratio of corrected total SSEA-1 fluorescence to corrected total DAPI fluorescence (SSEA-1/DAPI) in the wounds of day 7 and day 14, respectively, by using imageJ program. The result revealed a significant increase of SSEA-1 expression in wounds on day 7 as compared to that in wounds on day 14 [0.1784 ± 0.0643 (day 7) vs 0.0012 ± 0.0009 (day 14), ratio of CTCF of SSEA-1/CTCF of DAPI, n = 6, P < 0.001]. A possible explanation is that either SSEA-positive cells have differentiated into skin cells in which SSEA-1 and SSEA-3 are not expressed, or SSEA-positive cells have died as fibroblast-released M-CSF may reduce significantly after the wound is healed. In addition, our result revealed that the expression of M-CSF receptor in stem cells was found in wounds of seven days but not in wounds of fourteen days (Supplementary Figure S2 To do this, skin excisional wounds were topically administered with either a control of phosphate buffer saline (PBS), or M-CSF, or a neutralizing antibody against M-CSF, from day one until day six. The mice were sacrificed on day seven. Skin wounds were collected and fixed in 10% formalin for immunofluorescence staining with SSEA-1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 , a higher number of SSEA-1 positive cells were seen in wounds receiving M-CSF treatment, compared to the number in untreated wounds. In concert with this result, the application of M-CSF neutralizing antibody remarkably reduced the number of SSEA-1 positive cells in the wound site, as compared to the number untreated wounds. These data suggest that the presence of SSEA-1 positive cells in the wound site can be affected by M-CSF at the wound environment, which normally is produced and released from proliferating fibroblasts, and some infiltrated immune cells, during the wound healing phase. Since M-CSF can increase the number of SSEA-positive stem cells in the wound site, we were next interested to evaluate the effect of M-CSF on skin wound healing. As described above, skin excisional wounds in mice received either 0.1 ml PBS as controls, or 2 ng/0.1 ml of M-CSF, or 1 μ g/0.1 ml of M-CSF neutralizing antibody per wound daily from day one to day nine. Wound size was measured on day one, day five and day ten, and the mice were sacrificed on day ten. Skin wounds were collected for histological evaluation. As shown in Fig. 5 , M-CSF treatments significantly accelerated skin wound healing as compared to untreated wounds on day five (55.9 ± 9.3% vs 37.5 ± 8.2% in wound size, control vs M-CSF, p < 0.0001, n = 12) and day ten (18.5 ± 4.8% vs 6.7 ± 2.3% in wound size, control vs M-CSF, p < 0.0001, n = 12). Consistent with this result, the topical application of a neutralizing antibody against M-CSF slowed skin wound healing as compared to controls on day five (55.9 ± 9.3% vs 62.4 ± 12.3% in wound size, control vs antibody of M-CSF, p = 0.102, n = 12) and day ten (18.5 ± 4.8% vs 24.0 ± 5.4% in wound size, control vs antibody of M-CSF, p = 0.0052, n = 12). These data demonstrated that M-CSF level in the wounds site can influence the outcome of skin wound healing. healing, we cultured enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) positive FLCs obtained from the splenocytes of UBC-EGFP transgenic mice by culture in a medium containing M-CSF. Three million EGFP + FLCs per mouse were injected into the blood circulation of syngeneic mice via tail vein (Fig. 6A ). Skin wounds were created by punch biopsy simultaneously. After fourteen days, blood, spleen, liver, heart, lung, and bone marrow cells, and both wound-surrounding normal skin and wounded skin were collected. Fluorescence microscopy failed to detect any EGFP-positive cells in spleen, lung, liver, heart or kidney of mice receiving EGFP stem cells (Supplementary Figure S3A) , and flow cytometry similarly detected none in splenocytes or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Supplementary Figure S3B) . Furthermore, there were no EGFP-positive cells detected in the surrounding normal skin (Supplementary Figure S3C) . However, EGFP-positive cells were found in the dermis and some parts of the epidermis of healed skin (Fig. 6B) . Furthermore, our results revealed that injected splenocyte-derived multipotent stem cells could also differentiate to blood vessel-like structures in the wound sites (Fig. 6C) . To examine whether EGFP-positive cells in the dermis could contribute to the skin healing process through differentiation into fibroblasts, we performed an immunofluorescence staining with type-1 pro-collagen antibody. While undifferentiated FLCs are known to be negative for type 1 pro-collagen 24 , results from this study revealed that almost all infiltrated EGFP-positive FLCs in dermis express type-1 pro-collagen (Fig. 6D) , suggesting hematopoietic cell-derived stem cells are able to differentiate into functional skin cells.
