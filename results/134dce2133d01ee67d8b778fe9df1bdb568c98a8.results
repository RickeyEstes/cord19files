In an attempt to test for their susceptibility to transcription suppression by flanking sequences, the 18-nt or the 12-nt sequences were independently placed in the middle of different 0.4-kb sequences that had been inserted in a complete MHV DIss EcDNA clone, DE5-w3 (Makino and Lai, 1989b) between the AflII site and the SacII site ( Fig. 1) ; this placement of the intergenic sequence resulted in its being flanked by two 0.2-kb sequences. We called the 0.2-kb-long regions that were located upstream and downstream of the intergenic sequence the 0.2-kb upstream flanking sequence and the 0.2-kb downstream flanking sequence, respectively.
