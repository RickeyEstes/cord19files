Sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR assay To evaluate the prevalence of hMPV infection in adults, we developed an RT-PCR assay targeting the hMPV P gene in order to detect the hMPV genotypes A and B. The limit of detection (LOD) of the RT-PCR assay was 52 molecules per reaction when the RNA templates of the full-length P gene were obtained from in vitro transcription and used as standards for quantification. No cross reactivity of the developed primers was observed when stocks of other respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses A/H1N1 2009 and A/H3N2, influenza B, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, adenovirus 5, 7 and 35, and parainfluenza 3, were tested (data not shown). In addition, our sequence analysis showed that all amplicons generated from the clinical specimens collected for this study were specific for the hMPV P gene, further indicating the specificity of this RT-PCR assay.
