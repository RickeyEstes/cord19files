CPE was observed at 9 days in the Caco-2 cells and all other cell lines exhibited no viral changes after a total of 14 days incubation. Further, the Qiagen ResPlex II assay and all of the real-time (RT)-PCR assays were negative. To further investigate the agent that had grown in the Caco-2 cells, the isolate was extracted using the Qiagen Viral RNA mini kit and tested with the same panel of molecular assays as those used for the primary sample; all results were negative. At this time the submitting laboratory was contacted to obtain additional patient information that may elucidate what could be propagating in cell culture. The clinician reported that there was nothing relevant of note in the history. The virus cultures were then prepared for shipment to the CDC for EM. Briefly, 1:1 mixtures of infected scraped cells and 5% glutaraldehyde were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant of the centrifugate was adsorbed to formvar-carbon coated grids and negatively stained with 5% ammonium molybdate-1% trehalose, pH 6.9. Subsequently, thin-section electron microscopy was performed on the centrifuged cell culture precipitate using routine methods, similar to those described previously [7] [8] [9] . Specimens were viewed within a Tecnai BioTwin electron microscope operating at 80-120 kV (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR). Images were captured digitally by using a 2K × 2K CCD camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp., Woburn, MA). The images observed on EM were consistent with either a togavirus or a flavivirus (Fig. 1A and B) . Consequent to this observation, nucleic acid from the Caco-2 isolate was amplified using a pan-flavivirus conventional RT-PCR assay that targets a portion of the NS5 region [10] . PCR products of the expected size were sequenced using the PCR primers. Resulting sequences were combined and BLAST analyzed, demonstrating the highest sequence similarity (99%) to YF virus. The student health clinic was contacted for further discussion on the patient history. They provided additional information, including their administration of the YF vaccine to the patient 8 days prior to the collection of the original respiratory specimen, and also that the patient had recovered. To further characterize this YF virus, published primers [11] and primers designed in this study using Geneious Pro 5.6 (Biomatters, San Francisco, CA), were used to further sequence the Membrane (M), and envelope (E) gene regions (Table 1 ). These targets further identified the virus as having the highest similarity to YF vaccine.
