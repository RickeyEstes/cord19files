A total of 242 patientsrepresenting a real-life population -were randomised between February 2010 and January 2011 and received at least one dose of the study medication. Both treatment groups were well matched with respect to the baseline characteristics ( Table 1 ). The mean age of the participants at entry was 41.0 and 43.9 years in the respective groups. The mean duration of the patients' acute bronchitis was 3.9 and 4.0 days, respectively. The medication generally was not changed during the 10 days treatment period. The baseline parameters in both treatment groups were comparable. Treatment compliance was determined by counting the study medication at each visit and was found to be high and comparable across the treatment groups.
