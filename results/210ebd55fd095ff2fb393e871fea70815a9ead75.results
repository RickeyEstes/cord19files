Transient cellular transfection and analysis of the targeted gene and EGFP expression in BHK-21 cells Different siRNAs suppressed the expression of fusion green fluorescent protein in BHK-21 cells is different. The siRNAs targeting to the conserved region of GTPV genome were generated in vitro by human recombinant Dicer enzyme, as described in Figure 1B . To identify an effective inhibitory effect of siRNAs, the cDNA cassettes of these regions were inserted into the 5' end of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene to construct reporter plasmids ( Figure 2 ). The reporter plasmids were used to cotransfect BHK-21 cells with either the homologous siRNAs or the heterologous siRNAs. The results showed that the number of EGFP-expressing cell was markedly reduced in the sample transfected with homologous siRNAs than sample transfected with heterologous siRNAs or non-transfected ( Figure 3A ). FACS demonstrated that the levels of inhibition mediated by the siRNAs were similar among the different experiment groups and significantly higher than the control group (cotransfection with heterologous siRNAs or without siRNAs). The inhibitory effects of the siRNAs on expression of EGFP were quantitatively validated by flow cytometry 48 h posttransfection. The extent of EGFP down regulation was assessed by the mean fluorescence of the positive cells (LR-values) and the rate of EGFP positive cells Figure 3B ). Compared with the pC, the LR-values of the EGFP positive cells were reduced in the cells transfected with ORF095 siRNA-specific expression plasmids p61, p70, p165 and p296, and were reduced by 90.9%, 96.7%, 66.0%and 69.32%, respectively. To further demonstrate the levels of inhibition, cells were collected 48 h post-transfection and RT-PCR analysis was performed. The level of target RNA, as determined by RT-PCR, was also significantly reduced in cells transfected with homologous siRNAs ( Figure 4A) . To measure the level of gene suppression accurately, QPCR primers and Taqman probes directing to ORF095 were designed. We also designed probes and primers directed toβ-actin sequence (serve as internal reference). When normalized for loading differences using the βactin mRNA, the ORF095 message in the cells transfected with p61, p70, p165 and p296 were reduced by 69%, 97%, 22%and 57% (ORF095 message copies ratios of cells transfected with shRNA expression vectors/cells transfected with empty vector)( Figure 4B ). There was no significant inhibition in cells transfected with the empty vector pEGFP-N1 and nonspecific shRNA expression vector pC. mRNA levels of ORF095 (average ORF095 mRNA levels in cells treated with p61, p70, p165, p296, pC and empty vector were 0.416, 0.036, 1.046, 0.580, 1.345, respectively) or β-actin suggested that the reductions in ORF095 message did not result from poor transfection, nonspecific inhibition or toxicity, because the average mRNA levels of β-actin for experimental cells were not significantly reduced compared to the control cells. In addition, the suppressive effect was found to be gene-specific, because the inhibitory effect of empty vector and nonspecific shRNA expression vector pC were negligible. These results suggest that the siRNA generated by in vitro transcription effectively and specifically inhibit the expression of GTPV ORF095 conserved regions in BHK-21 cells.
