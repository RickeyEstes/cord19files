From the Perspective of O-Antigen Synthesis Genes, Y. pestis Might Have Evolved From One of Several Specific Evolutionary Branches of Y. pseudotuberculosis Y. pseudotuberculosis strains possess an O-antigen, the production of which was lost by Y. pestis during evolution. Based on a recent study on the evolution of Y. pseudotuberculosis (12), we sequenced six O-antigen synthesis genes ( Figure 1A ) just outside of waaL ( Figure 1B ) of 39 strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis and eight strains of Y. pestis to investigate the changes in these genes during evolution (12) . As shown in a summary (Figure 2) , unlike Y. pestis, the genes from the Y. pseudotuberculosis strains showed extreme diversity, which echoes the conclusion of the Cui's study (12) . However, there are several new findings; (1) wbyL: Only one Y. pestis strain from the eight analyzed showed a non-synonymous mutation in wbyL compared to Y. FIGURE 2 | Y. pseudotuberculosis rather than Y. pestis, isolated from China, show the multiple mutations of O-antigen synthesis genes. In the heatmap, rows represent six O-antigen synthesis genes, and columns represent data from Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis strains. Red cell indicates the gene was detectable in this strain while green cell indicates the gene was undetectable. In the phylogenetic tree, red branches are Y. pestis, and the rest are Y. pseudotuberculosis.
