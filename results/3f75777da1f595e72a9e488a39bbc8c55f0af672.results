A total of 18 volunteers participated, all HCWs with previous experience in using PPE. Seventeen were right-handed, and 1 was left-handed. The frequency of virus transfer to hands, face, clothing, and inner gloves (during double-gloving) is shown in Table 1 . Transfer of virus to participants' hands during PPE removal was significantly more frequent in the single-gloving phase than in the double-gloving phase ( The quantities of infectious virus recovered from previously uncontaminated sampling sites were measured (Fig 2) . The mean amount of virus applied per site across all PPE contamination sites was 5.13 log 10 PFU (95% CI, 5.14-5.46). The amount of virus transferred to hands after PPE removal ranged from 0.15 log 10 MPN to 2.5 log 10 MPN. In the single-gloving phase, larger quantities of virus were transferred to participants' dominant hands compared to their nondominant hands. In the double-gloving phase, more virus was transferred to inner gloves than to hands. The paired t test for dependent samples was used to compare the quantity of infectious virus transferred to each site during the single-gloving phase versus the double-gloving phase ( Table 2) . Significantly more infectious viruses were transferred to participants' hands during PPE removal after single-gloving than after double-gloving. Double-gloving also was associated with significantly less transfer of virus to participants' scrub shirts; however, virus transfer to pants did not differ significantly between the study phases. Despite the fact that participants reviewed the protocol before beginning PPE removal and had it available during removal, deviations from the protocol were common during removal (Table 3) . Errors included removal of PPE items in the wrong order and touching of an area of an item identified by the protocol as contaminated. The most common error was touching the N95 respirator and eye protection on the front (where it is most likely to be contaminated), rather than by the straps or edges. The paired t test was used to compare the quantity of infectious virus transferred to hands by participants who deviated from the protocol and by participants who did not. A comparison of the quantity of virus transferred to the dominant hand in participants who made errors and those who did not showed that only errors in gown removal (most frequently grabbing the gown and pulling it off by the sleeves instead of the neckline) were associated with a significant increase in the quantity of virus transferred (P < .0001).
