Initial frontal chest radiographs were obtained for the 201 patients (84 male and 117 female). Fifteen patients were health care workers and 116 were residents of Amoy Gardens, a residential area where a community SARS outbreak had occurred. Fifty-two patients had a history of recent travel to SARS-infected areas in Mainland China. Nasopharyngeal aspirate or stool specimens from 135 patients (67%) yielded positive results by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Of 182 patients who underwent serology testing for the SARS coronavirus, 169 (93%) had a fourfold or greater increase in antibody titers between acute-phase and convalescentphase sera tested in parallel. Overall, 50 patients (25%) required intensive care. Forty-two patients (21%) needed assisted ventilation, of whom 24 (12%) died. Normal chest radiographs were seen in 16 patients (8%) on admission. The middle and lower zones were more often affected than were the upper zones (Table 1 ). Almost half of the patients (47%) had single zone involvement. The majority (79%) had a predominant lobular pattern of disease. Most patients (84%) showed air space consolidation. One patient had right pleural effusion on the initial chest radiograph. An interstitial pattern and other associated findings such as cavitation or lymphadenopathy were not seen in any of the patients. The level of agreement and the percentage of complete concordance among the radiologists regarding assessment of the various radiographic features varied (Table 2) . Interobserver agreement was generally good for normality, laterality, and number of zones involved, but fair to poor for location and type of opacification. Patients with more than two zones of lung involvement presented significantly later than patients with fewer zones of involvement (6 Ϯ 3 days vs. 4 Ϯ 2 days after onset of symptoms, P ϭ 0.001) ( Table 3) . Although patients with more zones of involvement had significantly higher levels of total white blood cell and neutrophil counts, the absolute value of these variables for the two groups of patients were within normal range. Patients with greater lung involvement more often had elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (56% vs. 24%, P ϭ 0.001). They also had significantly worse outcomes in terms of admission to the intensive care unit and mortality. Forty-two patients (21%) reached the endpoint of the need for assisted ventilation, death, or both. One patient with hepatitis B compensated cirrhosis died of liver failure. Three patients with underlying heart disease (1 with chronic rheumatic heart disease, 2 with ischemic heart disease requiring percutaneous coronary angioplasty) died of respiratory failure. The risk of an adverse outcome increased significantly from 13% (21/165) to 58% (21/ 36) for patients with more than two zones involved. In the ROC curve analysis, involvement of more than two zones was selected as a cutoff with a sensitivity of 0.51 and a specificity of 0.91. The area under the ROC curve was 0.7 (95% confidence interval: 0.6 to 0.8). In the bivariate analysis, variables associated with an adverse outcome were bilateral disease, involvement of more than two zones, diffuse infiltrate and infiltrates in both peripheral and central locations, older age, male sex, shortness of breath, and elevated alanine aminotransferase level (Table 4 ). Days between the onset of symptoms and admission were not significantly associated with clinical outcome. As there was a strong collinearity among involvement of more than two zones, bilateral disease, and diffuse pattern and distribution (both peripheral and central) of disease, zonal involvement was chosen for analysis as it represented the extent of disease involvement and was easily assessed objectively. Other factors associated significantly with an adverse outcome by bivariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that older age (odds ratio [OR] per 10 years ϭ 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1 to 2.0; P ϭ 0.01), shortness of breath (OR ϭ 2.8; 95% CI: 1.1 to 7.4; P ϭ 0.04), and involvement of more than two zones (OR ϭ 7.0; 95% CI: 2.7 to 17.9; P ϭ 0.01) were independently associated with an adverse outcome.
