Colony sizes on Annob√≥n were estimated at approximately 1000 -1500 bats (sampled colony) and 600-1000 bats (observed colony). Captured individuals were classified as adult (n = 43, comprising 14 females and 29 males) or sexually immature (n = 32, comprising 19 females and 13 males) ( Table 1 ). Most adult females (13/14) were in early stages of gestation, and based on a gestation period of 4 months [31] , the birthing time was estimated as mid-September. Sexually immature individuals could be further classified based on size, weight and reproductive status into those which were estimated at 8 months old (n = 21) and those which were estimated at 20 months of age (n = 11). Adult body size and forearm length were significantly smaller (p,0.001) than E. helvum on either continental Africa or the other Gulf of Guinea islands ( Figure 3) . Consistent with previous studies in Ghana [18] and in continental Africa (unpublished data), Luminex binding MFIs were higher against NiV than HeV in all samples above background levels. We interpret this as a greater cross-reactivity (and presumably relatedness) between African henipaviruses (or henipavirus-like viruses) and NiV, than with HeV. For this reason, although the full set of results is presented in Table S1 , the data discussed below refer to NiV only. In a previous study [18] , three times the average MFI of negative bat sera was used as a threshold for positive reactivity for the binding assay and samples with an MFI. (Table S1 ). No significant differences in MFI values were observed between males and females overall, or between the sexes within age classes (p.0.05, Figure 6 ). Of 69 samples with sufficient plasma to enable testing by VNT, one sample (#331) neutralised HeV at 1:40 dilution and NiV at 1:80 dilution. Presence of antibodies was confirmed using western blot analyses (Figure 7) in 7 of 11 samples tested using this method. Reactivity to the recombinant NiV nucleocapsid protein, varied among positive samples from strong (#302, 353) to intermediate (#301, 331, 317, 323, 328 ). All bats with positive results in western blot analyses were adults, except for bat #331, a primiparous female.
