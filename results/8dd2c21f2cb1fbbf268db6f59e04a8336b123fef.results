Effect of color additive on 0.5% sodium hypochlorite efficacy against S. aureus using AOAC 961.02 Table 2 shows the results of studies GLP1540 and GLP1550, in which 0.5% sodium hypochlorite was tested alone and in combination with color additive against S. aureus at a contact time of 10 minutes. To pass EPA performance criteria for successful disinfection, 3 lots of the test substance must be tested, with at least 59 of the 60 test carriers for each lot confirmed negative for any surviving S. aureus. Three lots of 0.5% sodium hypochlorite successfully disinfected 60, 60, and 59 of the 60 carriers. Three lots of 0.5% sodium hypochlorite with color additive successfully disinfected 60, 60, and 59 of the 60 carriers. Both met EPA efficacy performance guidelines. Effect of color additive on 0.5% sodium hypochlorite efficacy against human coronavirus 229E using ASTM E1053 Table 3 and Table 4 show the results of studies GLP1538 and GLP1536, in which 0.5% sodium hypochlorite was tested alone and in combination with color additive against human coronavirus 229E at a contact time of 10 minutes. To pass EPA performance criteria for virucidal efficacy, test substances must demonstrate complete inactivation of the virus at all dilutions. The 2 lots of 0.5% sodium hypochlorite alone demonstrated 3.00 log10 and ≥3.25 log10 reduction of virus, and infectious viral particles were recovered in 1 of the 10 −1 dilution wells. The 2 lots of 0.5% sodium hypochlorite with color additive both demonstrated ≥4.50 log10 reduction of virus. Under these test conditions, the combination of 0.5% sodium hypochlorite with color additive completely inactivated human coronavirus 229E and met EPA performance criteria for virucidal efficacy, whereas 0.5% sodium hypochlorite alone failed the disinfection success criteria due to recovery of infectious viral particles from 1 lot. Effect of color additive on 0.2% calcium hypochlorite efficacy against V. cholerae using ASTM E2315 Figure 1 shows the results of studies NG8285 and NG9679, in which 0.2% calcium hypochlorite was tested alone and in combination with color additive against V. cholerae at a contact time of 3 minutes. 0.2% calcium hypochlorite alone and with color additive were prepared immediately before efficacy testing and demonstrated 5.99 log10 and >6.03 log10 reduction of V. cholerae, respectively. For study NG9679, both test substances were prepared and allowed to rest at room temperature 4 hours before efficacy testing, and both demonstrated 6.58 log10 reduction. Effect of color additive on 0.5% NaDCC efficacy against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus using ASTM E1153 Figure 2 shows the results of study NG8156, in which 0.5% NaDCC was tested alone and with color additive against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a contact time of 5 minutes. Against S. aureus, 0.5% NaDCC alone and with color additive both reduced the bacteria below detectable limits, with a reduction of >4.9 log10 (>99.9988%). Against P. aeruginosa, both test substances demonstrated >3.54 log10 (>99.97%) reduction. Overall, the efficacy results of 0.5% NaDCC with and without color additive both met ASTM passing criteria of >3 log10 reduction. Effect of color additive on chlorine disinfectant efficacy against P. aeruginosa after 4-hour resting time using ASTM E1153 Figure 3 shows the results of studies NG8698 and NG9375, in which 0.5% sodium hypochlorite, 0.2% calcium hypochlorite, and 0.5% NaDCC were prepared alone and in combination with their respective formulas of color additive, allowed to rest for 4 hours, then tested against P. aeruginosa using a contact time of 5 minutes. 0.5% sodium hypochlorite alone and with color additive achieved >4.1 log10 (>99.992%) and 3.8 log10 (99.98%) reduction, respectively. 0.2% calcium hypochlorite alone and with color additive both demonstrated 3.8 log10 (99.98%) reduction. 0.5% NaDCC alone and with color additive both achieved >4.34 log10 (>99.995%) reduction. Overall, the addition of color additive to all 3 chlorine solutions did not affect their ability to achieve the ASTM-required >3 log10 reduction, even after prolonged resting time. Skin irritation profile of chlorine disinfectants with and without color additive Table 5 shows the results of direct primary skin irritation tests performed on rabbits using the 3 chlorine disinfectants alone or with color additive. The PII is a quantitative evaluation of the ability of a test substance to provoke inflammatory response in the skin and is determined based on triplicate testing of animals on 2 test sites through 3 time points. Any PII score above 0 indicates that erythema or edema occurred at least once during the observation period. Based on FDA evaluation criteria, test substances with a PII score of less than 0.5 are considered negligible irritants; a PII score of 0.5-<2.0 indicates a slight irritant; and a PII score of 2.0-<5.0 indicates a moderate irritant. Substances with a PII score of >5.0 are considered severe irritants. 31 No signs of erythema or edema were found on any of the untreated bandaged control sites for every animal. 0.5% sodium hypochlorite alone or with color additive and 0.5% NaDCC alone or with color additive produced no signs of erythema or edema on any animal, thus yielding a PII score of 0. For 0.5% calcium hypochlorite alone, a small area of moderate erythema (score of 2) was found on Test Site 1 of Animal 60617 at the 72-hour time point, yielding a final PII score of 0.1 when averaged across all animals and test sites. For 0.5% calcium hypochlorite in combination with color additive, 1 rabbit (Animal 60612) was observed with slight erythema (score of 1) on both test sites at the 1-, 24-, and 48-hour time points, yielding a final PII score of 0.2. All test substances yielded PII scores of below 0.5 and were considered negligible irritants.
