A total 135 papers were identified through the literature search. Among them, 10 in vitro studies, 25 phytochemistry studies, and 9 phytochemistry with in vitro studies were considered for screening after 86 non-Saposhnikoviae divaricata and 5 non-phytochemistry related papers were excluded. Phytochemistry papers were further screened according to the selection criteria and 21 papers were excluded due to non-PSVN (n = 17), different reporting standards of measure standard (n = 2), standard procedures of reporting chromatographic profile not followed (n = 1) and study on soil element of SD (n = 1). As a result, 4 SD phytochemical studies only [4] [5] [6] [7] adhered to the scientific rigors that ensure the integrity in validation and robustness in quantitative outcomes. Among 9 phytochemistry papers with in vitro studies [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , 5 [11, [13] [14] [15] [16] were selected based on their relevance, but the phytochemistry component did not adhere to the selection criteria. A total of 10 in vitro studies only were included in this review [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Fig. 1 illustrates the study selection process.
