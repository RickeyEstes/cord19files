Visualization and efficiency of aerosol sampling as determined by electron microscopy. To develop and validate the ionizing technique for collection and identification of viral pathogens, we used several viruses of clinical importance; calicivirus, rotavirus and influenza virus (H3N2, strain Salomon Island) as well as latex particles. Canine calicivirus (CaCV, strain 48) was used as a surrogate 27 for human norovirus, the aetiological agent behind the "winter vomiting disease", causing outbreaks of great clinical and economic importance 28 . Rhesus rotavirus was used as a surrogate marker for human rotavirus 29 . The device (Fig. 1a) consists of a small portable 12 volt operated ionizer, with a collector plate of positive charge attached to the ionizer, attracting negative particles from the air by electrostatic attraction. To determine optimal time collection parameters, latex particles with sizes ranging from < 1 to > 10 μ m were nebulized into a room of 19 m 3 . Testing revealed that 40-60 min was required to eliminate > 90% of free latex particles in the air as determined by real-time particle counting (PortaCount Plus). The particle counter can detect particles with size greater than 0.02 μM. Visualization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on grids from active-and inactive ionizer collector plates showed that accumulation of latex particles was dramatically enhanced on active ionizer collector plates compared to the inactive (Fig. 1b,c) . Next, high numbers of rotavirus and formalin-inactivated influenza virus were aerosolized under the same conditions. While, after 40 min the inactive collector plates contained few (< 5) rotavirus and influenza virus, the active collector contained > 50 virus particles, as determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), (Fig. 1d,e) .
