We performed two basic real-time PCR experiments. The first test was conducted with four samples having a master mix with identical contents of the cDNA of DENV template to verify real-time PCR system uniformity and repeatability as well as temperature settings by performing MCA. The second test mimicked the actual field test having three samples and a no template control (NTC) (Supplementary Section  B) . The captured analog-to-digital converter output values of PCR Fig. 1 . The schematic diagram demonstrates the IoT system that could be applied for DENV spread monitoring. Once the sample potentially containing the DENV is processed at point of interest location, the results of diagnoses as well as GPS coordinates of the location are automatically transferred via the user's mobile phone interface through a global network to a control center. All results can be collected as cloud data by a network to create a disease outbreak map showing the disease outbreak area and carry out continuous monitoring. amplification data, as well as MCAs, were displayed on the integrated thin film transistor (TFT) screen of the PCR unit. Then they were transferred to the smartphone via BT to be displayed by the mobile system and also further processed by subtracting the background noise and normalization. The data were then averaged from four consecutive runs and plotted in a linear (Fig. 3B) and logarithmic (Fig. 3C) scale. We then calculated the C T as the value of the cycle number with 10% of relative fluorescence amplitude as (20.07 ± 0.17) cycle (mean ± standard deviation from four measurements), showing an excellent point to spot result uniformity. We also extracted the MCA (Fig. 3D ) and performed the curve fitting using a modified Boltzmann curve obtaining a T M value of (81.98 ± 0.16)°C (mean ± standard deviation from four measurements). We subsequently performed a numerical differentiation of the fitted curves for better visualization (Fig. 3E) by showing the values of T M as peaks of the -dF/dT curve. Concurrently, we performed identical testing using a commercial real-time PCR system getting comparable results for both, C T and T M (Supplementary section A) . Then, the data containing the time of experiment and GPS location could be sent via LTE to the centralized location for further analysis of the disease spreading.
