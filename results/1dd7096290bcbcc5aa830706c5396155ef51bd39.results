Physical properties and complete drying time of mucus. We performed a rheological analysis of the fluid flow properties of saline and the mucus samples (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). All mucus samples showed characteristics of a pseudoplastic fluid (a fluid whose viscosity decreases as the shear-rate increases). The viscosity of the mucus was significantly higher than that of saline (P Ͻ 0.001) at all shear rates (0.01 to 100 s Ϫ1 [Fig. 1A] ). We also measured other physical properties ( Fig. 1B ; see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The mean contact angle (the angle between the liquid and contact surfaces) of the mucus samples was higher than that of saline (54.9 Ϯ 2.7 versus 21.8 Ϯ 0.8°; P Ͻ 0.001). Additionally, the mean surface tension of the mucus samples was lower than that of saline (46.9 Ϯ 2.0 versus 71.4 Ϯ 0.6 mN/m; P Ͻ 0.001), and the density of the mucus samples was lower than that of saline in the normal temperature range of 20 to 37°C. Furthermore, the time required for 5 l of saline or mucus samples to completely dry and solidify on a glass plate was measured. The mean complete drying time of the mucus samples was longer than that of saline (33.1 Ϯ 2.7 versus 18.7 Ϯ 0.8 min; P Ͻ 0.001 [ Fig. 1C] ). Ethanol diffusion in mucus. Coefficients were determined for ethanol concentrations of 10 to 80%, and a fitting curve was prepared from the values (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). In the presence of 80% ethanol, the mean diffusion coefficient in mucus was 1.8 ϫ 10 Ϫ10 Ϯ 6.9 ϫ 10 Ϫ11 m 2 /s, and the coefficient in saline was 3.6 ϫ 10 Ϫ10 m 2 /s (Fig. 1D) . In a simulation of changes in ethanol concentration that was conducted in Opensource Field Operation And Manipulation (OpenFOAM) software, considering only diffusion phenomena (and using the diffusion coefficients shown in Fig. S2 ), the ethanol concentration increase rate (ECIR) was indeed lower in mucus than in saline (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material).
