A full clinical overview of these patients was previously published [11] . Briefly, patient 1, a 64-year-old man, had undergone renal transplantation in 1998 for renal failure secondary to diabetes. Regular medications included mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, and prednisone. Clinical symptoms began on April 22 upon returning from travel to Duba√Ø; he was transferred to the Lille University Teaching Hospital intensive care unit (ICU) and intubated on April 30. On May 8, the patient required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, and died on May 28 from refractory multiple organ failure. Patient 2, a 51-year-old man, was admitted on April 26. His medical history included a histamine-induced angioedema treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. He shared patient 1's room from April 26 to April 29. On May 8, he presented with asthenia, myalgia, and cough. On May 12, he was intubated and transferred to the Lille University Teaching Hospital ICU. The patient required ECMO support on May 14 for refractory hypoxemia despite optimal treatment. The patient was successfully weaned off ECMO on June 17. On July 2, percutaneous tracheotomy was performed. He required 3 days of intermittent haemodialysis per week until mid-July. As previously described, for patient 1, MERS-CoV RNA was detected for the first time in a broncho-alveolar lavage sample two days after the onset of symptoms [11] . Afterwards, between the 13th and the 30th day after the onset of illness, MERS-CoV RNA was detected in each pharyngeal and tracheal swab obtained. During the same period, MERS-CoV RNA was not detected in nasal swabs. MERS-CoV RNA detection was also tested in urine, blood samples and rectal swabs. Viral RNA was detected in blood samples from the 13th to the 30th day after the onset of illness. Urine samples were collected from the 20th to the 30th day after the onset of illness and MERS-CoV RNA was always detected. Detection of MERS-CoV RNA in rectal swabs always remained negative. These results are summarized in Table 1 with corresponding cycle points for UpE and Orf1a. For patient 2, MERS-CoV diagnosis was confirmed after detection of the viral RNA from an induced sputum sample collected on day 3 after the onset of illness [11] . In the following days, MERS-CoV RNA was positive in endotracheal aspirates collected from the 6th to the 33rd day after the onset and illness. After the 33rd day of the onset of illness, viral RNA was no longer in tracheal swabs. Detection of MERS-CoV RNA in all other biological samples tested was negative throughout the course of infection. These results are summarized in Table 2 .
