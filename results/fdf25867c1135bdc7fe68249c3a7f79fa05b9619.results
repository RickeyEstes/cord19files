Immunofluorescence assay for localization of non-structural protein B1. In whole viral infection. Western blotting was used to detect the expression of B1 and immunofluorescence assays were used to localize the protein. B1 protein expression was detected in RGNNV-infected cells at 24 hours post-infection (hpi) and continued to increase until 48 hpi (Fig. 1a, lanes 2-3) . B1 protein expression in RGNNV-infected cells at 24 hpi was mainly localized to the cytoplasm (100%) partially to the nucleus, in up to 45% of cells (Fig. 1b , e-h; indicated by white arrows; Fig. 1c ), whereas at 48 hpi, B1 expression was mainly detected in the cytoplasm (100%) and targeting to nucleus in up to 95% of cells (Fig. 1b , i-l; indicated by the red arrow; Fig. 1c ). EYFP-transfected cells were used as a control (Fig. 1c , a-d). In trans-transfection assay using EYFP-B1 fused-genes. The EYFP, EYFP-B1 and EYFP-B1ΔC (for details see Methods) fusion constructs were used to directly trace B1 protein targeting to the nucleus. Western blot analysis was used to confirm the expression of the EYFP-B1 fusion protein (Fig. 2a, lanes 4-6) , the EYFP-B1ΔC fusion protein (Fig. 2a, lanes 7-9 ) and the EYFP protein (Fig. 2a, lanes 1-3) in cells harvested at 0 h, 24 h and 48 hours post-transfection (hpt). A degraded form of the protein is labeled by arrows in the figure. DAPI staining revealed that although the EYFP-B1 fusion protein was targeted to the nucleus ( Fig. 2b : e, f, g, h and n [enlarged image]), this targeting was not observed for EYFP alone ( Fig. 2b: a, b , c, d and m [enlarged image]). Loose nucleus targeting was observed for the EYFP-B1ΔC fusion protein ( Fig. 2b : i, j, k, l and o [enlarged image]), which was distributed throughout the whole cell, including the cytoplasm and nucleus at 48 hpt. In the nucleus targeting test, in EYFP-B1ΔC fusion protein also lost its targeting ability (Fig. 2b, o) , as compared with that of EYFP-B1 (Fig. 2b , n) and EYFP alone (Fig. 2b, m) . Quantitative analysis of the EYFP, EYFP-B1 and EYFP-ΔB1 proteins targeting into cytoplasm or nucleus (Fig. 2c) showed that GF-1 cells transfected with pEYFP, pEYFP-B1 and pEYFP-B1ΔC plasmids exhibited a significant targeting into the nucleus in EYFP-B1-transfected cells (up to 99%) at 48 hpt (*p < 0.01; **p < 0.05) compared with cells transfected with EYFP (100%) and EYFP-B1ΔC plasmids (10%), which apparently lost targeting ability. The reasons for these observations are discussed below. Identification of two arginine-rich nuclear targeting domains in the B1 protein. Potential targeting signal peptides in the B1 protein were identified by running the iPSORT and TargetP 1.1 programs (Fig. 3) for the R and K residues. The predicted targeting domains were labeled domain A ( 32 PRRAR 36 ), domain B ( 46 ARRSRR 51 ), domain C ( 63 VRDKRPRR 70 ) and domain D ( 101 VRQRQRRR 108 ) (Fig. 3) . Domain deletion experiments were used to determine which targeting domain(s) played a role in the nuclear targeting of B1 (Fig. 4a) . Western blot experiments were used to compare the localization of the EYFP-B1 fusion protein (~40-kDa) with (1) domain A deletion (<40-kDa, designed as ΔA), (2) domain B deletion (ΔB), (3) domain C deletion (ΔC), (4) domain D deletion (ΔD), (5) domain A and D double deletion (ΔAD) and (6) domain B and C double deletion (ΔBC) (in Fig. 4b , lanes 3-9, respectively). Untransfected GF-1 cells and EYFP-transfected cells were used as negative controls (Fig. 4b, lanes 1-2, respectively) . These data, along with nuclear targeting analysis ( Fig. 5a ; Table 1 ) showed that deletion of domain C resulted in the biggest decrease in nuclear targeting (in ΔC panel: panels e1-e4; indicated by arrows) and deletion of domain B resulted in a minor decrease in nuclear targeting (panels d1-d4; indicated by arrow). In contrast, deletion of domain A (panels c1-c4) and domain D (panels f1-f4) had no significant effect on nuclear targeting. Simultaneous deletion of two domains (B1ΔBC; panels g1-g4 and B1ΔAD; panels h1-h4) ( Table 1 ) also showed that domains B and C played an important role in the nuclear targeting of B1, whereas domains A and D were not involved in the nuclear targeting of B1. Nuclear targeting of the B1 protein is correlated with an induction of G1/S cell cycle arrest in GF-1 cells. We have previously shown that anti-sense RNA-mediated decreases in B1 protein expression decrease the viability of RGNNV-infected host cells 8 . In the present study, we investigated whether B1 plays a role in cell division during a specific phase of the cell cycle. Cells transfected with pFlag and pFlag-B1 and selected for receiving the different producing cell line as term Flag-1 for negative control and Flag-B1-4 and Flag-B1-5 for B1-producing cell lines. These cells were subjected to cell cycle analysis at 48 hpt by measurement of DNA content by using PI staining. Representative cell cycle profiles and histograms of Flag-1, Flag-B1-4 and Flag-B1-5 cells are presented in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. There was also a significant increase in the percentage of cells arrested at the G0/G1/phase in the Flag-B1-4 and Flag-B1-5 samples compared with the Flag-1 sample (69.1% vs. 64.1% vs. 53.2%, respectively) (*p < 0.01). There was a significant decrease in the percentage of cells arrested at the S phase In contrast, there was a minor significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase among the three samples (8.4% vs. 8.4% vs. 4.5%, respectively) (*p < 0.01; **p < 0.05). To summary B1 protein can arrest cell cycle progression at G1/S phase. B1-induced G1/S cell cycle arrest was correlated with upregulation of p53 and p21 and downregulation of Cyclin D1, CDK 4 and Mdm2. The G1/S transition is regulated by a number of molecules including the cyclin-Cdk complexes, pRb, Mdm2 and CKIs such as p21 25 . We investigated the key molecules responsible for RGNNV B1-induced cell cycle arrest by examining the expression profiles of host G1/S transition proteins. GF-1 cells were transfected with Flag, Flag-B1 and Flag-B1ΔC plasmids and then assayed for expression of these cellular proteins by western blotting at 24 hpt and 48 hpt. There was a significant increase in the expression of p53 and p21 (
