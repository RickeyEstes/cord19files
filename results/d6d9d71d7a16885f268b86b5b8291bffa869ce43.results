Headspace-solid phase microextraction -gas chromatographic mass spectrometry (HS-SPME -GC-MS) analysis Chemical analyses of EOs were performed by GC-MS techniques. Identified compounds and percentage evaluation of the volatiles are shown in Table 1 . In all samples, the amount of the detected components was above 93%. In accordance with the literature and our previous observations, the main volatiles of the headspace of cinnamon bark, eucalyptus, thyme, peppermint, and clove oil were trans-cinnamaldehyde (45.9%), 1,8-cineole (91.0%), thymol (46.1%), menthol (27.2%), and eugenol (66.9%), respectively. Beside the main constituents, γ-terpinene (3.2-6.5%), p-cymene (3.2-27.9%), menthone (19.8%), and β-caryophyllene (1.3-26.5%) were determined as minor components in the above mentioned EOs. In citronella oil, citronellal (42.3%), limonene (12.8%), and nerol (12.9%) were dominant. Scots pine oil contained α-pinene in higher amount (26.1%), but β-pinene (18.0%) and limonene (17.0%) were also detected in lower concentrations. On the whole, we presume that the above mentioned components play the main role in the antibacterial activity of EOs in VP.
