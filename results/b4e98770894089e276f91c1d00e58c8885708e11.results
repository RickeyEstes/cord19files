Two invalid tests occurred and four subjects were diagnostically indeterminant because of specimen leakage or rejection. Of the remaining 54 patients, the immunoassay correctly identified 92% (22/24) of subjects as negative for infection (95% CI: 74.2Á97.7), 80% (16/20) of confirmed bacterial infections (95% CI: 56.3Á94.1), and 70% (7/10) of confirmed viral infections (95% CI: 39.7Á89.2). The percent negative and positive agreement of the test was calculated according to the charts in Table 1 . Of the 41 enrolled patients with LRTI, 26 were males and 15 were females with an age range of 22Á89 and a mean age of 51 years. Of the 19 patients enrolled with pharyngitis, 8 were males and 11 were females with an age range of 18Á69 and a mean age of 37 years. Viral pathogens detected by PCR included influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza 2, parainfluenza 3, and HSV-1. Three asymptomatic controls had rhinovirus detected without an associated elevation in MxA; this was deemed likely colonization and was excluded from the microbiological confirmation. If both a viral and bacterial infection were confirmed microbiologically, this was characterized as a bacterial infection.
