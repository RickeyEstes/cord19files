The results are summarized in Table 1 . FCV survived on telephone buttons and telephone receivers for a maximum of 3 days (48-72 hours). However, the rate of 90% virus reduction was higher on telephone receivers (4-8 hours) as compared with that on telephone buttons (12-24 hours). On computer mouse and telephone wire, the virus survived for 24 to 48 hours, and 90% virus reduction occurred in less than 4 hours. On brass and computer keyboard keys, the virus survived for 8 to 12 hours only, and 90% virus reduction time was ,4 hours. Overall, FCV survival was longer on telephone-related items than on computer keyboard and brass.
