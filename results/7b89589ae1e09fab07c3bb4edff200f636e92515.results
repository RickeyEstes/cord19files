The programme was initiated in October 2006 in a single orthopaedic ward, followed by a subsequent roll-out to all targeted wards within the hospital that was completed by June 2010 (Figure 1 ). By the end of June 2008, all adult intensive care units, and up to 30% of general wards including the majority of surgical general wards, had been included in the programme. Figure 2 shows the incidence-density of all MRSA clinical isolates since 1999, all MRSA blood isolates since 2004, and MRSA acquisition rates since 2006. There is strong evidence of a rising incidence of all MRSA clinical cases until a peak in the first quarter of 2008 (95% CI: Q1-2007 to Q2-2009) with a notable decline thereafter ( Figure 2a) ; this peak is consistent with the completion of the roll-out by the end of the second quarter of 2008 (P ¼ 0.57) but not with the first roll-out of the programme in the fourth quarter of 2006 (P ¼ 0.005). The decline after the change-point was 2.3 times (95% CI: 1.3e4.7) as rapid as the preceding rise. The MRSA acquisition rate is presented in Figure 2b empirical and modelled MRSA bacteraemia rates are presented in Figure 2c . Here, there was a significant fall from 0.26 cases (95% CI: 0.18e0.34) per 1000 inpatient-days in the first quarter of 2004 to 0.11 cases (95% CI: 0.07e0. 19) in the first quarter of 2012, but no evidence of the fall levelling off, with the 95% CI for a change-point spanning almost the entire period of recorded data. The evolution of hand hygiene compliance is displayed in Figure 2d . Compliance rose significantly since audits started, from 47% (95% CI: 44e49%) in the first quarter of 2009 to 69% (95% CI: 68e71%) in the first quarter of 2012. There was, however, evidence that compliance stalled around the last quarter of 2010 (95% CI: Q1-2010 to Q2-2011) with a rate of change after that time that was not statistically distinguishable from 0 (P ¼ 0.5). Throughout the period of the study, the changes in consumption of the antibiotics measured did not correlate with the improvement in MRSA rates (Figure 3) , and therefore antibiotic prescription per se did not affect MRSA rates at our institute.
