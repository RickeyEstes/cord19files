The nucleotide sequences of a region extending from the E gene through the 5b gene of six US strains of IBV (Gray, Mass41, Ark DPI, Holl52, Conn, and Iowa) and putative amino acid sequences were determined and compared with each other and the published sequences of the Beaudette (Boursnell et al., 1987) and KB8523 (Sutou et al., 1988) strains. The E, M, 5a, and 5b genes were sequenced for one new field isolate (Ala1). In addition, the M genes of two new field isolates from California were sequenced. This region represented a 1780 nucleotide sequence from the KB8523 strain genome (Sutou et al., 1988) , but was shorter in the Beaudette strain (Boursnell et al., 1987) and in the Iowa strain due to lengthy deletions. The remaining five strains had about the same number of nucleotides as the KB8523 strain. The longest sequence of complete conservation was a stretch of 38 identical bases near the 5 end of the M gene. For each strain examined, the intergenic (IG) consensus sequence CTTAACAA, found at positions 78 through 85 upstream from the start codon of the M gene, positions 9 through 16 upstream from the start codon of the 5a gene, and positions 96 through 103 upstream from the N gene, was identical and in the same positions in the previously published strains.
