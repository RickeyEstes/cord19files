Proliferative responses of (04+(08+ i-IEL from aged rats to OnaK (E. coli HSP70) We have previously reported that i-lEL from aged F344 rats but not from young rats respond to syngeneic spleen cells (15) , and NAKAMURA et al. has recently reported that the proliferation of the i-IEL from aged Lewis rats was enhanced by mycobacterial HSPs (26) . To confirm these earlier findings, we first examined the proliferative responses of whole i-IEL from 6 month-old Wistar rats against E. coli HSP70 (DnaK) in the presence of syngeneic antigen presenting cells (APC). Consistent with our previous report with F344 rats (15) , the i-lEL from the aged Wistar rats showed proliferative response in the presence of MMCtreated syngeneic splenocytes, whereas such response was not detected in the i-IEL of young (8 week-old) Wistar rats (Fig. la) . The proliferative response of CD4+CD8+ i-IEL respond to E. coli hsp 70 . 555 the aged rats i-IEL was significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) in response E. coli HSP70 (Fig. 1 b) , but those of the young rats did not respond to the HSP70. To further determine which cell population in the i-IEL from aged rats was able to respond to the bacterial HSP70, we purified CD4-CD8+ i-IEL and CD4+CD8+ i-IEL from aged rats by using EPICSÂ® Elite ESP of COULTER cell sorting system. The purity of each subset was 99.3% for CD4-CD8+ i-IEL or 97.5% for CD4+CD8+ i-IEL (Fig. 2a) . As shown in Figure 2b , the purified CD4+CD8+ i-IEL responded to syngeneic spleen cells and much more vigorously to HSP70 in the presence of syngeneic spleen cells, whereas CD4-CD8+ i-IEL showed little, if any, proliferation in response to HSP70 with syngeneic spleen cells. These results indicate that CD4+CD8+ i-lEL of aged rats can respond to E. coli HSP70 in the presence of syngeneic APC. Comparison of appearance of CD4+CD8+ i-IEL among aged rats fed CL-2 diet or home-made diet under conventional conditions or germfree conditions i-lEL were recovered from 6 month-old rats bred under conventional conditions, which were fed commercial CL-2 diet or home-made diet. After staining with various mAbs, the i-IEL were examined by FCM analysis. A representative FCM profile from 5 rats of each group was shown in Figure 3 and the data were summarized in Table 3 . In 6-month old rats bred under conventional conditions, which were fed CL-2, a much larger proportion of CD4+CD8+ i-IEL were detected (Fig. 3a, Table 2 , p < 0.005). Although most of the i-IEL expressed TCRa~ in these rats, an appreciable number of CD3+ TCRa~i-IEL corresponding to TCRyb i-IEL were detected in the i-IEL (Fig. 3b) . The CD3-TCRa~i-IEL were also detected at an appreciable level in the rats. The CD3-TCRa~-CD4-CD8-i-IEL did not belong to B cells because they did not express surface 19 as accessed by staining with anti-IgK chain mAb (data not shown). The CD4+CD8+ cells were reported to be detected, albeit only a few, in the GALT including PP and lamina propria in mice (10) . To confirm that the CD4+CD8+ i-IEL were really located within the epithelium, we carried out immunohistochemical analysis of the small intestine of aged conventional rats. Two color staining using naphtol and DAB revealed that CD4+ i-lEL coexpressed CD8 in these rats (Fig. 4a) . The CD4+CD8+ i-lEL were detected at the intraepithelium and preferentially located at the lateral surface in the longitudinal sections of villi from the terminal ileum, whereas these CD4+CD8+ i-lEL were rare in the crypts or dome epithelium overlying PP (Fig. 4b, 4c , and data not shown). To further characterize the CD4+CD8+ i-IEL, three color staining analysis with anti-CD4 mAb, anti-CD8 mAb, and anti-CDS mAb was carried out for lymph nodes (LN) and IEL from aged rats fed CL-2 diet under conventional conditions. As shown in Figure 5 , only a few CD4-CD8+ i-IEL expressed CDS, which is a pan T cell marker, but all CD4+CD8+ i-IEL expressed much the same intensity of CDS as the peripheral mature T cells, suggesting that the lineage of CD4+CD8+ i-IEL may differ from that of CD4-CD8+ i-IEL. The phenotype of i-IEL from aged rats fed home-made diet under conventional conditions were found to be quite different from those fed CL-2. The i-IEL consisted of a large number of CD4-CD8+ cells and appreciable numbers of CD4-CD8-cells and CD4+CD8-cells but very few, if any, CD4+CD8+ cells (Fig. 3a) . Thus, these results suggest that the composition of a diet may deeply influence the increase in the CD4+CD8+ i-IEL with age. To elucidate whether diets affect directly or indirectly the expansion of CD4+CD8+ i-IEL, we examined cell surface markers on i-IEL from aged rats fed CL-2 diet or home-made diet which were bred under germfree conditions. Representative FCM profile from data of five rats of each groups was shown is Figure 6 and the data were summarized in Table 3 . i-IEL in aged germfree rats, irrespective of home-made or CL-2 diet feeding, consisted of a large number of CD4-CD8+ cells, CD4-CD8-cells and only a few CD4+ cells but no CD4+CD8+ cells. These results suggest that intestinal microflora play important roles in expansion of CD4+CD8+ i-1EL in aged rats fed CL-2 and exclude the possibility for direct stimulation of antigens in CL-2 diet to expand the CD4+CD8+ i-IEL. Comparison of intestinal microflora between aged rats fed CL-2 diet and those fed home-made diet To determine the effects of diets on microflora, bacterial counts of the contents in the small intestine and feces were examined in three aged rats fed CL-2 diet or home-made diet under conventional conditions. There was no significant difference in total bacterial counts both in the contents and feces between aged rats fed CL-2 diet and those fed home-made diet. However, the number of Enterobacteriaceae, especially E. coli, in contents and feces of rats fed CL-2 diet were approximately 100-fold higher than those in rats fed home-made diet (p < 0.05), while fewer H2S-producing bacteria were detected in rats fed CL-2 diet (p < 0.05, Table 4 ). The counts of the other bacterial group present in the rats fed CL-2 diet were much the same as those in rats fed home-made diet.
