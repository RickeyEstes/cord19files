When it comes to isolated people were as follows: 944 (57.0%) females, 795 (48.0%) jobless people, 33 (2.0%) with history of psychiatric illness, 375 (22.6%) with history of physical illness, 195 (11.8%) people reported medical expenses due to MERS, and 173 (10.5%) people reported financial losses and decrease in sales. The most common infection route was patients from the same hospital (33.3%), then visitors (26.7%), hospital workers (16.1%), and patient's family members (9.9%) ( Table 1) . In isolated people, 8.5% experienced fever, 7.0% cough, and 4.1% diarrhea. Compared to isolated people, MERS patients experienced more symptoms related to MERS such as fever, cough, and diarrhea (p< 0.001). Eighty seven point three percent of isolated people reported having enough food and water. Ninety six point six percent of isolated people could bathe during the isolation period, and 97.0% of isolated people felt equipped with daily necessities. Compared to MERS patients, isolated people received more food and shelter support (p< 0.001). There was no significant difference between MERS patients and isolated people in social activity such as phone calls, texts, email, or Internet use. For isolation location, 91.7% of MERS patients stayed in the hospital and 8.3% stayed with family at home, wher- eas 68.4% of isolated people stayed with family at home and 6.3% stayed in the hospital. This revealed a statistical difference in the location of isolation between MERS patients and isolated people (p< 0.001) ( Table 2) . During isolation, 47.2% (95% CI, 30.9 to 63.5%) of MERS patients had symptoms of anxiety and 52.8% (95% CI, 36.5 to 69.1%) had feelings of anger. Four to six months after removal from isolation, 19.4% (95% CI, 6.5 to 32.3%) of MERS patients had symptoms of anxiety and 30.6% (95% CI, 15.6 to 45.7%) had feelings of anger. In isolated people during isolation, 7.6% (95% CI, 6.3 to 8.9%) had symptoms of anxiety and 16.6% (95% CI, 14.8 to 18.4%) had feelings of anger. Four to six months after removal from isolation, 3.0% (95% CI, 2.2 to 3.9%) had symptoms of anxiety and 6.4% (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.6%) had feelings of anger (Table 3) . After adjusting for sex and age, risk factors for experiencing anxiety symptoms and anger at four to six months after release included symptoms related to included symptoms related to MERS during isolation, inadequate supplies (food, clothes, accommodation), social networking activities (email, text, Internet), history of psychiatric illnesses, and financial loss (Table 4 ). In 1,032 people with verified ranks, 27 people were in the 0th rank (2.6%), 514 in the 1st rank (49.8%), 60 in the 2nd rank (5.8%), 368 in the 3rd rank (35.7%), and 63 in the 4th rank (6.1%). On analysis of prevalence differences of anxiety symptoms and anger based on the likelihood of exposure (prioritized in ranking system), the prevalence rate of anger increased with priority in rank evidence by the following distribution: 18.1% in the 1st rank, 16.7% in the 2nd, 15.2% in the 3rd, and 6.3% in the 4th (p for trend< 0.001). The prevalence rate of anxiety symptoms in each rank were as follows: 31.7% in the 1st rank, 28.3% in the 2nd, 22.8% in the 3rd, and 20.6% in the 4th (p for trend< 0.001), which revealed that the prevalence rate of anxiety symptoms increased with priority in rank (Figure 2 ).
