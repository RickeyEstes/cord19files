After the reintroduction of rabies into France in 1968, the number of rabid animal cases increased to reach a maximum of 4,212 cases in 1989 [18] , followed rapidly by a maximum of 9,763 RPEP prescribed for 15,948 patients consulting at ARMC recorded in 1990 ( Figure 3 ). In 2001, France was declared free Rabies Reemergence and Antirabies Prophylaxis www.plosntds.org of rabies in non-flying terrestrial mammals based on OIE criteria [19] and, as a consequence, the number of patients consulting ARMC and receiving RPEP began to decline progressively to respective minima of 7,788 and 3,378 in 2003 ( Figure 3 ). However, the numbers of patients consulting at ARMC and given RPEP suddenly rose in 2004. Therefore, 2000-2005 data were further investigated using ARIMA modeling to describe in greater detail the trends observed. Between 1 January 2000 (week 1) and 31 December (week 312) 2005, five rabid dogs illegally imported from Morocco and one rabies-infected human from Gabon were detected in France. During the period examined, the first event #1 dog (5 months old) was confirmed as being rabid in May 2001 (week 74) and the second, event #2 dog (3 months old) in September 2002 (week 139); they entered France from Morocco, 2 months and 2 weeks before their deaths, respectively. The human case (event #3) was a 5-year-old boy, who traveled from Gabon and died 2 months later, in October 2003 (week 199) [20] . Event #4, #5 and #6 dogs were diagnosed as being rabid, respectively, in February 2004 (week 213), May 2004 (week 229), and August 2004 (week 243) [21] . Event #6 was a 4-month-old puppy, illegally imported by car from Morocco to Bordeaux, France, via Spain, who died of rabies in August 2004 (week 243); he was not officially vaccinated. Between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2005, 56,924 rabiesexposed individuals in France (all patients exposed abroad were excluded from the analysis) consulted in an ARMC, among whom 56,446 had valid exposure dates and bite/contact locations. Among them, 50,930 had valid consultation dates and 56,406 had valid treatment information (Figure 4 ). Because the data presented 52-week seasonality, the time preceding event #1 was too short to be analyzed. In such a case, Box and Jenkins recommend using at least two seasonality periods to calibrate the model [14] . Data analyses concerning events #1, #2, #4 and #5, corresponding to rabid dog importations, were simple and rapidly done, as these dogs had had no known contact with animals and humans other than their owners during their communicable risk periods. As a consequence, events #2, #4 and #5 were not reported in the major national newspapers and were not associated with any significant increase of ARMC activity. In contrast, events #3 and #6 were reported in 6 and 54 published articles retained for this study, respectively, and significantly affected the numbers of patients consulting at an ARMC ( Figure 5 ). Until event #3 (October 2003), the weekly number of patients consulting an ARMC declined significantly (slope = 20.34; p,0.0001), with 52-week seasonality that peaked during the summer ( Figure 5 ). In October 2003, the weekly number of ARMC patients was significantly higher than the predicted number during the 6 weeks surrounding event #3 (weeks 198-203), with an estimated NCAE of 355 (IR = 54.7%, 95% CI = 30.0-83.0). Furthermore, event #3 was followed by a significant flattening of the decreasing slope of ARMC activity (20.23 versus 20.34; p = 0.0003). No RPEP-or ARIG-rate modification associated with event #3 was observed. In the summer of 2004 (event #6), the weekly number of ARMC patients differed significantly from the predicted number during the 26 weeks surrounding it (weeks 238-263). The total 26week number of additional ARMC patient load was estimated at 2,928 (IR = 84.0%, 95% CI = 57.0-123.3) over the model predicted 3,486 ( Figure 5 ). During that period, the observed mean RPEP and ARIG rates were significantly higher than those recorded during the period preceding event #6, IR = 19.7% and 43.4%, respectively ( Table 1) . The slopes of the ARMC-consultation decline after week 263 and before week 238 were estimated at 20.12 and 20.23, respectively; p,0.001. Surprisingly, between weeks 264 and 312, the mean RPEP rate remained persistently and significantly higher Rabies Reemergence and Antirabies Prophylaxis www.plosntds.org than before the reference period, as did the ARIG rate, which was more than two-fold higher than before week 237 ( Table 1 ). The increased number of patients consulting at an ARMC in response to the newspaper articles concerning event #6 peaked at the same time as the media coverage in the three different French areas defined according to their rabies experience ( Figure 6A ). In area 3, the exposure dates reported by ARMC patients corresponded to the risk period coinciding with the dog's movements and infectivity, whereas in areas 1 and 2, patients reported exposure dates more compatible with newspaper coverage than with the risk period ( Figure 6B ).
