Optimisation of the transfection method resulted in transfection efficiencies averaging 30% (Fig. 2) . Helper cell line clones (CRFK/tas) were developed over a 5-month period, with cell clones being grown to confluency, expanded, tested and frozen as stocks. Thirty-two CRFK/tas single cell clones were identified. Seven of these clones were found to express functional Tas, with efficiencies ranging from 25-60% (Fig. 3) . PCR of the functional helper cell line clones for the presence of the tas gene insert revealed all to be positive for a 600 b.p. band, consistent with the expected size of the tas gene. The homogeneity of expression of the helper cell lines has subsequently been assessed and further studies into Tas are underway. Helper cell lines were transfected with the replication-incompetent, tas-deleted vectors, containing the eGFP gene cassette. Fluorescence was detected in 10-20% of cells using an inverted fluorescence microscope. The ability of these vectors to replicate in the helper cell lines and transfer to independent cell cultures is being investigated.
