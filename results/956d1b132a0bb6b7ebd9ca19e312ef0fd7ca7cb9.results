The optimal protocol of RT-LAMP assay and inspection of products Following standardization and optimization, the optimal ratio of primer (inner-outer-loop) concentrations for the RT-LAMP reaction was found to be 8:1:4 equivalents to 1.6, 0.2 and 0.8 mM. Gene amplification was detected by an increase in turbidity, as well as adding dye for color change indication (Figure 3 ). Restriction enzyme analysis performed with EcoRI and EcoRV on the RT-LAMP product validated no nonspecific reaction in RT-LAMP assay. The RT-LAMP assay amplified the 199-bp target sequence of the VP6 gene of BRV (Figure 4 ). For the reproducible sensitive and specific results of RT-LAMP assay, the optimal reaction time and incubation temperature was found to be 60 minutes at 63Â°C.
