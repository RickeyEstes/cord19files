We approached 31 households to take part in the pilot study and 30 (96.8%) agreed (28 unique households; two households took part twice). These represented 15 ill adults and 15 ill children (Table 1 ). All households reported in the follow-up call that they had obtained the sample, and we received 29 samples (96.7%) (most samples [n=28] by mail, and one specimen brought directly to the laboratory). Of those who mailed the specimen, most (78.6%) reported mailing it within 1 day; all reported mailing it within 2 days. The median time between the kit being dropped off and arrival to the laboratory was 8 days (range: 3-99 days). Of the 29 swabs received, 18 (62.1%, from seven adults and eleven children) had a corresponding research swab that was positive for a respiratory pathogen. Seven (87.5%) corresponding self-swabs were concordant with the positive research swabs for influenza, and eight (80.0%) corresponding self-swabs were concordant with the research swab for noninfluenza pathogens ( Table 2 ). The kappa statistic between research and self-swab was 0.84. There were no differences in demographic variables, including education level or days between drop-off and receipt of swabs, among participants whose self-and research-staff obtained swabs correlated versus those whose swabs did not correlate (Table 1) . Of the self-swab samples that had a corresponding positive research swab, the longest time a self-swab sample took to arrive was 17 days; this swab was positive for respiratory syncytial
