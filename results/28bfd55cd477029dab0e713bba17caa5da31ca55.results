The mean age of the 74 children was 12.7 months (SD, 6.0 months); 11 children were aged 3 to 5 months, 22 were aged 6 to 11 months, and 41 were aged 12 to 23 months. Fifty-seven (77%) children were male, 22 (30%) of 73 had allergen-specific IgE sensitization, 28 (38%) had eczema, 15 (21%) of 72 had atopic eczema, 17 (23%) had parental asthma, and 18 (24%) had virus codetection, and the mean level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was 85 nmol/L (SD, 23 nmol/L; see Table E1 ). The 2 randomly assigned study groups (prednisolone versus placebo) did not differ in any of the patient characteristics. Compared with outpatients, inpatients had lower oxygen saturation (median, 97% [interquartile range, 95% to 98%] vs 98% [interquartile range, 96% to 99%]; P 5 .02), higher respiratory rate (mean, 52 [SD, 13] vs 45 [SD, 10] breaths/min, P 5 .03), and higher body temperature (37.78C [0.78C] vs 37.28C [0.48C]; P 5 .002) at study entry. The study groups did not differ with respect to use of nonstudy medications from the index hospitalization or emergency department visit through day 14 (data not shown). No difference was found between the treatment groups in the delay of prednisolone initiation at study entry (prednisolone vs placebo: mean, 45 [SD, 22] vs 52 [SD, 29] hours; P 5 .27; Table I and Table E1 ). In addition, the delay was not associated with the primary or secondary outcomes (results not shown).
