Necropsy, capture ELISA for detection of the MERS-CoV N protein, real-time qRT-PCR screening assay and viral culture Necropsy of the dromedary calf with sudden death showed that the cause of death was cryptosporidiosis and colisepticemia. The nasal sample, but not trachea, lung, and tonsil samples collected from the dromedary calf were positive for the N protein (OD 3.712, OD of negative control 0.065), real-time qRT-PCR, and virus isolation. In contrast, the nasal swabs of the other 254 dromedaries as well as the milk produced by the 133 female adult dromedaries were all negative for the N protein, real-time qRT-PCR, and virus isolation.
