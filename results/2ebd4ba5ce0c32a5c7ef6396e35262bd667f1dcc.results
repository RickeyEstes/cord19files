Administration of an S1P 1 Agonist Blunts Cytokine Storm Previously, we reported that treatment of influenza virus-infected mice with AAL-R, a promiscuous S1P receptor agonist for S1P 1 and S1P 3-5 receptors, inhibits early proinflammatory cytokine expression and innate immune cell accumulation within the lung Marsolais et al., 2009) . To assess the contribution of S1P 1 receptor signaling in inhibition of influenza virus-induced early inflammation, infected mice were treated with the S1P 1 receptor-specific agonist CYM-5442 (Gonzalez-Cabrera et al., 2008) . Treatment with 2 mg/kg of CYM-5442 twice daily significantly inhibited secretion of cytokines and chemokines associated with influenza virus-induced pathology, including IFN-a, CCL2, IL-6, TNF-a, and IFN-g ( Figure 1A ) in addition to CCL3, CCL5, CXCL2, and IL-1a ( Figure S1A ), compared to vehicle-treated mice 48 hr postinfection. CYM-5442 reduction of IFN-a, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, IL-1a, and IL-6 expression was as complete as treatment with the promiscuous agonist; however, it was not as effective as AAL-R in suppressing CXCL2, TNF-a, and IFN-g ( Figure 1A and Figure S1A ), suggesting a role for other S1P receptors in modulating those cytokines. In addition to inhibiting cytokine/chemokine production, AAL-R and CYM-5442 administration to influenza virus-infected mice blunted the accumulation of innate inflammatory infiltrate characterized as macrophages/monocytes (CD11b + , F480 + , Ly6G À ), neutrophils (CD11b + , LyG6 + , F480 À ), and NK cells (NK1.1 + , CD3 À ), although AAL-R was more effective at inhibiting macrophage/monocyte and NK cell accumulation in the lung ( Figure 1B) . We also observed significantly reduced CD69 expression on macrophage/monocytes and NK cells following treatment with either CYM-5442 or AAL-R 48 hr postinfection, demonstrating diminished cell activation ( Figures 1C and 1D ). Despite significant blunting of innate immune cell recruitment and cytokine/chemokine responses, we observed no differences in viral titers following AAL-R or CYM-5442 treatment compared Data represent average ± SEM from four to mice per group. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.005; ***p < 0.0005. Results are representative of greater than six independent experiments. See also Figure S1 and Figure S2 . to vehicle-treated mice ( Figure S2 ), demonstrating that S1P 1 agonism neither inhibits nor enhances viral replication. Collectively, these results reveal that activation of a single sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor, S1P 1 , is sufficient to blunt global innate inflammation following mouse-adapted influenza virus infection in mice. We next asked whether S1P 1 receptor agonism could suppress early innate cytokine and chemokine responses following infection with a human pathogenic isolate of influenza virus. To test this, we infected mice with a virulent isolate of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus that was isolated from a hospitalized patient and has never been passaged through mice (A/Wisconsin/WSLH34939/09) (Itoh et al., 2009) . Infection of C57BL/6J mice with this strain causes severe disease, resulting in rapid mortality beginning between days 4 and 6 postinfection (data not shown). Similar to infection with mouse-adapted WSN influenza virus, treatment with CYM-5442 following infection with H1N1:2009 significantly suppressed cytokine and chemokine responses and the accumulation of activated innate immune cells 48 hr postinfection (Figures 2A and 2B) . We also tested an additional S1P 1 receptor-selective agonist (RP-002) to provide support for S1P 1 receptor specificity and to show directly that S1P1-selective agonists share this modulation of innate immunopathology. We infected mice with H1N1:2009 pandemic influenza virus as above and treated mice with RP-002 at 1 and 25 hr postinfection. Similar to what we observed with CYM-5442, RP-002 treatment significantly inhibited the production of multiple proinflammatory cytokine and chemokines ( Figure 2C ) and suppressed the accumulation of activated (CD69 + ) macrophages/monocytes and NK cells in the infected lung 48 hr postinfection ( Figure 2D ). Moreover, RP-002-mediated suppression of innate immune cell recruitment and cytokine/chemokine production occurred without altering lung viral titers ( Figure S3 ), demonstrating that S1P 1 agonist-mediated suppression of cytokines and chemokines is not due to direct effects on influenza virus replication. S1P 1 Agonist-Mediated Suppression of Early Innate Immune Responses Results in Protection to Human Pathogenic Influenza Virus Challenge in Mice Early dysregulated innate immune responses in the lung have been associated with morbidity and mortality during infection with highly pathogenic strains of influenza virus (Cilló niz et al., 2009; Kobasa et al., 2007) . Therefore, we asked whether blunting early innate cytokine/chemokine responses using an S1P 1 agonist could protect mice from lethal infection with a virulent human isolate of pandemic 2009 H1N1 that had not been passaged in mice (A/Wisconsin/WSLH/34939/09). In order not to impose additional stress on the infected lung and because oral delivery is a popular route for drug administration, we orally administered the S1P 1 agonist, RP-002, at 6 mg/kg by gavage to C57BL/6J mice infected with 1 3 10 5 PFU of Figure 3B ). Early administration of RP-002 resulted in enhanced survival time after lethal challenge with A/Wisconsin/WSLH/34939/09, with death initiating in vehicle-treated mice on day 6 postinfection compared to day 11 postinfection for RP-002-treated mice ( Figure 3C , p < 0.005). Moreover, RP-002 treatment resulted in significant improvement in overall survival compared to vehicle-treated mice (20% mortality in RP-002 versus 80% mortality for vehicle, p < 0.005; Figure 3C ). These findings demonstrate a significant biological phenotype resulting from early S1P 1 receptor agonist treatment following pathogenic influenza virus infection. By showing directly that aborting an early step in cytokine amplification significantly protects against an ordinarily lethal human pathogenic H1N1:2009 infection, the findings expand previous observations of an association between humans and animal models in which dysregulation of innate immune responses contributes to morbidity and mortality. Importantly, treatment with RP-002 ameliorated morbidity and mortality associated with human pathogenic H1N1:2009 severe influenza infection. Effects upon survival are in keeping with our previously published data (Marsolais et al., 2009 ) that this mechanism does not alter virus-specific neutralizing antibody response, affinity maturation, and class switching. This documents that the cytokine storm plays a direct and cardinal role in influenza-mediated lung disease. We then sought to delineate the mechanism of S1P1 suppression of cytokine amplification.
