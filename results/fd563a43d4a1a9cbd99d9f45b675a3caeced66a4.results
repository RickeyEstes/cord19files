We examined (NPA/Sputum and BAL) samples from 387 cystic fibrosis patients at respiratory exacerbation in a tertiary care center. All samples collected from the years 1984e2016 were included in the analysis. A total of 159 patients had pulmonary exacerbation, and viral PCR was performed. Fifty-eight out of 159 patients (36%) had positive viral PCR. Out of the 58 patients, 30 patients were males (52%) and 28 patients (48%) were females. Forty-five out of 58 patients (78%) were alive and 13/58 patients (22%) died. Twenty-five out of 58 patients (43%) were referred from the Eastern region, 11 (19%) from the central region, 10 (17%) from the North, 10 (17%) from the South and only 2 (3%) from the western region. Methods of sample collection were mostly by nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) in 34 (59%), broncho-alveolar lavage BAL in 5 (9%), and induced sputum from 19 (32%). Seventy-four positive first viral PCR were obtained from the total 58 PCR samples (some patients had more than one type of viruses). The most frequently reported virus was rhinovirus in 33/ 74 sample (45%), adenovirus in 12 (16%), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) in 10 (14%), bocavirus in 6 (8%), enterovirus in 4 (5%), coronavirus OC43 in 4 (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in 2 (3%), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 1 (1%), influenza A virus in 1 (1%), and influenza B virus in 1 (1%). Out of 74 viral PCR, 41 (55.4%) were during the colder seasons (OctobereFebruary) and 33 (44.5%) during the warmer seasons (MarcheSeptember) (Fig. 1) . This shows that the frequency of viral infection was higher during colder seasons. Rhinovirus infection had two peaks during winter and summer seasons. Out of 33 Rhinovirus cases, 19 (58%) patients were infected in December and 14 (42%) patients in June, respectively (Fig. 1) . During the viral infection, we collected 50 (86%) respiratory samples from the 58 patients for bacterial culture that resulted in 37 positive results. Some patients were infected with more than one type of bacteria. Thirteen out of 37 (35%) were infected with (PA), 8 (22%) with (S. aureus), 7 (19%) with (S. pneumonia), 3 (8%) with Escherichia coli (E. coli), 3 (8%) with (H. influenzae), 1 (3%) with (Pseudomonas cepacian), and 2 (5%) had other bacterial organisms (Table 1) . On follow up over 6 months period, post viral infection, 58 bacterial samples were obtained, resulting in 42 positive culture. 12 out of 42 (29%) were infected with S. aureus, 9 (21%) with Mucoid P. aeruginosa, 7 (17%) with H. influenzae, 2 (5%) with E. coli, 5 (12%) with S. pneumonia, 1 (2%) with Klebsiella, 5 (12%) with other organisms, and 1 (2%) patient was infected with other gram-negative bacteria (Table 1) .
