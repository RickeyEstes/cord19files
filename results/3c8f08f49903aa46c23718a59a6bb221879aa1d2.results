In silico analysis of NL63-N NL63-N is a basic protein (predicted pI, 9.78) comprising 377 amino acids (aa). The predicted molecular weight is 42,252.47 Da. Literature data indicate that the full length coronaviral nucleocapsid protein consists of two folded domains linked by an unstructured region. In more details the N protein includes following elements: N-tail, N-terminal domain (NTD), R.S.A.G. rich linker, C-terminal domain (CTD) and C-tail [50] . The constructs of NTD and CTD used in this study were designed based on literature data, HCoV-NL63 N protein amino acid sequence alignment with known homologs and on the comparative analysis of currently available crystal structures of these homologs. According to Saikatendu et al. the NTD of HCoV-NL63 N encompasses residues 17-141 [51] . Our sequence alignment and structural analysis suggests that NL63-N 2-144 fragment better reflects the full N-terminal domain. NL63-N fragment encompassing its CTD was chosen exclusively on the basis of sequence alignment and structural analysis which suggests that fragment 221-340 contains full, structurally stable CTD. The sequences and structures of N proteins used in above analysis are listed in Table 1 . The analysis strategy is summarized in S1 File and the amino acid sequences of the final constructs of CTD and NTD are presented in S2 File. In silico analysis conducted using PSORT II revealed that two nuclear localization signals (NLS) are buried within NL63-N: pat4 (aa 232-KKPR-235) and pat7 (aa 234-PRWKRVP-240). No bipartite NLS were detected.
