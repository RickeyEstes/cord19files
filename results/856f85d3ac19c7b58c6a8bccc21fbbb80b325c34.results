two images of nonstimulated cells (baseline calcium) were recorded before addition of virus, antibodies, or control liquids. MHV prepared and thereby obtain the maximal fluorescence (F max ). Subsequently, the minimal fluorescence (F min ) was measured after addition of an cells an immediate increase in fluo-3 fluorescence in excess of EGTA (5 mM). Fluorescent intensities (F) were then transthe cytoplasm as well as in the nucleus that ranged lated into [Ca 2/ ] using the equation [Ca 2/ ] Å K d (F-F min /F max -F), where between 1.5-and 4.7-fold (mean, 2.9; SD, 0.8; n Å 26 K d is the dissociation constant [18] . sity values for the nuclear compartment ( Fig. 2A) . How-with approximately 15% responding cells. A higher virus titer (m.o.i. of 10) only marginally increased the ever, transformation of the fluorescence intensities into [Ca 2/ ] i after calibration of the respective areas (see Ma-percentage of responding cells (data not shown), but decreasing virus titers resulted in an exponential re-terials and Methods) demonstrated that baseline [Ca 2/ ] i is slightly lower in the nucleus than that in the duction of the number of responding cells. For example, at a m.o.i. of 1, the percentage of responding cells was cytoplasm (Fig. 2B) . After the addition of MHV, the [Ca 2/ ] i is 10-fold higher than that in control cells. A reduced to 0.29% (SD, 0.63; n Å 11), and a further dilution to 0.5 pfu/cell practically failed to evoke any similar difference was observed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B) .
