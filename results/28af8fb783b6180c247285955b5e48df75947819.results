Of 1197 persons screened, 413 were randomized, and 390 completed the trial (Fig 1) . Participants tended to be female (76%), white (85%), educated (77% completed college), and middle aged (mean age 49.6 Â± SD 11.6 years) ( Table 1) . Of 138 assigned to MBSR, 83% attended at least 5 of the 9 training opportunities. For the EX group, 80% met this predefined per protocol criterion. Weekly self-reports of day-to-day EX and MBSR practice found that 79% of exercisers and 62% of meditators achieved target rates of 150 minutes/week of practice for at least half of the 37 weeks monitored. High rates of MBSR and EX practice continued throughout 37 weeks of observation. In the MBSR group, there were 112 ARI episodes and 1045 days of ARI illness, compared to 120 episodes and 1010 illness days in the EX group, and 134 episodes with 1210 days of ARI illness for controls ( Table 2; Table 2 is based on full n = 413 data set.). Mean global severity was 256 for MBSR (95% confidence interval 176, 335), 224 (161, 287) for EX, and 326 (240, 412) for control. The mean number of ARI episodes per person randomized was 0.81 (0.66, 0.97) for MBSR, 0.88 (0.72, 1.03) for EX, and 0.97 (0.80, 1.15) for control. The mean number of ARI days (duration) per person was 7.6 (5.6, 9.6) for MBSR, 7.4 (5.7, 9.1) for EX, and 8.8 (6.8, 10.7) for control. For the 58% of participants who did experience an ARI, the mean duration and Scores on the self-report questionnaires suggested improvements in mental health for both intervention groups, as shown in Table 3 (Table 3 includes all available data for time points represented;baseline values are in Table 1 ). General mental health (SF12) was significantly (p<0.05) improved in the MBSR group at 3 of 4 time points and trended towards improvement at all time points for both EX and MBSR groups. Significant reductions in perceived stress (PSS10) were seen at 3 of 4 time points in both EX and MBSR groups. Sleep quality (PSQI) was significantly improved at all time points for EX and trended towards improvement at all time points for MBSR. Self-efficacy (MSES, ESES) was significantly improved in both EX and MBSR at 5 of 6 time points for MBSR, and all time points for EX. Depressive symptoms (PHQ9) were significantly lower in the EX group at 2 of 3 time points, and trended towards benefit for MBSR. Mindful attention (MAAS) was significantly improved in both MBSR and EX groups, compared to control, at all 4 follow-up time points, from November to April. As expected, self-reported physical activity (GPAQ) was much higher in the EX group than in either MBSR or control. Positive and negative emotion (PANAS), perceived social support (SPS), and the sense of feeling loved were not significantly influenced by either MBSR or EX. Inflammatory biomarkers from nasal wash and blood collected during ARI illness are shown in Table 2 . Biomarker levels at the two standardized follow-up visits in December and March when participants were not ill are shown in Table 3 (baseline values in Table 1 ). While all biomarkers did increase as expected during ARIs, statistically significant between-group differences were only observed for IP-10, where both MBSR (p = 0.01) and EX (p = 0.02) seemed to enhance IP-10 response to ARI, and in IL-8, where EX may have increased IL-8 response (p = 0.03) ( Table 2) . Biomarker levels at standardized non-ill time points were not significantly different when comparing between treatment groups (Table 3 ). There were, however, a few within-group-over-time comparisons that were statistically significant. For example, median CRP for MBSR decreased from 1.6 mg/L at baseline to 1.3 in March (p = 0.002);  similar changes did not occur in the EX or control groups. A subgroup analysis of the 177 people with CRP !2.0 at baseline found that 38.3% in the MBSR group experienced an ARI, compared to 64.4% of control participants (p = 0.004). One other potentially relevant observation was that in the EX group, median IP-10 decreased from 156 pg/mL at baseline to 146 in March (p = 0.017); corresponding reductions were not seen in either the MBSR or control group. Comparing the two MEPARI trials, it is apparent that the magnitude of observed ARI reduction was larger in the first trial (Table 4 and Fig 2) . In the first MEPARI, proportional rate reductions of ARI incidence, days-of-illness, and global severity were 33%, 43% and 60% for MBSR, and 29%, 42%, and 31% for EX, compared to controls. The corresponding proportional rate reductions for MEPARI-2 were 16%, 14%, and 21% for MBSR, and 10%, 16%, and 31% for EX, respectively. Compared to control, ARI-related absenteeism was 76% lower for MBSR and 48% lower for EX in the first MEPARI, but only 30% lower for MBSR and 21% lower for EX in MEPARI-2. Pooling the two datasets, we found that unadjusted estimates of proportional reductions of incidence, days-of-illness, and global severity were 20%, 22%, and 33% for MBSR and 14%, 23%, and 31% for EX, compared to control. Pooled estimates for reductions in ARI-related absenteeism were 48% for MBSR and 32% for EX. Pooling individual level data also allowed an exploratory meta-analysis using zero-inflated multivariate regression models. These models suggested a reduction in ARI incidence attributable to MBSR (p = 0.044), and a decrease in total days of illness for EX (p = 0.004), but no statistically significant effect on global severity. See S1 File for model parameters and coefficients. 3 Economic costs were calculated by summing the estimated salary lost from missing work, cost of medical provider visits, and cost of medications used. 4 Lab visits were within first 72 hours of ARI. Reasons for missing data include: lab closed on weekends, participant unable to get in, etc. 5 Comparisons are for between group change from baseline (reference group: Control). Neutrophils were not collected at baseline, so no change from baseline could be computed. See Table 1 for baseline biomarkers values. 6 Hodges-Lehmann estimation for shift in location, with 95% CIs. 7 More than one virus was identified in 10 separate ARIs. In the EX group, one ARI yielded both BoV and CoV, two ARIs had CoV and HRV, and one ARI had EV/ HRV and PIV. In the MBSR group, one ARI yielded EV/HRV and CoV, and one ARI had EV/HRV and PIV (parainfluenza virus). In the control group, one ARI yielded HRV and BoV, one ARI had MPV (metapneumovirus) and CoV, one ARI had RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and HRV, and one ARI yielded CoV and BoV. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0197778.t002
