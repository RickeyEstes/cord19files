Of 53 hospitalized infants (median age 58 days, range 17-109 days, 34 [64.1%] boys) with pertussis infection enrolled, 28 (median age 51.5 days, range 17-102 days, 17 boys) had B. pertussis alone and 25 (median age 62 days, range 22-109 days, 17 boys) had viral coinfections. Among 25 patients with a coinfection, 9 were coinfected with hRV, 3 with hCoV, 2 with RSV, 2 with influenza virus (1 IVA and 1 IVB), 1 with PIV, 1 with AV, 1 with hMPV, 1 with hBoV and 5 patients had multivirus coinfections. Of these 53 patients, 3 had a (Fig. 1) . Clinical severity score and days hospitalization were similar in children with B. pertussis infection alone and those with B. pertussis and viral coinfection ( Table 1 ). The questionnaire indicated that infants with B. pertussis alone were younger than infants with coinfections (p = 0.044 by Mann-Whitney test). Questionnaire answers also showed that infants with B. pertussis alone were less often breastfeed at admission than infants with coinfections (p = 0.048 by χ-square test) and for a shorter time (p = 0.004 by Mann-Whitney test). Finally, infants with coinfections more frequently had a higher number of cohabitants though not significantly (p = 0.076 by χ-square test). The two groups had no significant differences for other demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data (Tables 2, 3 and 4).
