The P-values reported in this study for MR and LOS are close to 0.05 which is the cut-off value for level of statistical significance. This is partly due to the small sample size of patients available for this mid-term retrospective study. The authors are planning a final 10-year retrospective review where larger number of skin allograft recipients will be available for further analysis.
