All quantitative results are expressed as median (range). With the Hi-Ox 80 mask, subjects' minute ventilation and PETCO 2 (pooled for all O 2 flow rates) were 5.8 L/minute (2.3 to 9.5 L/minute) and 39.9 mm Hg (34.9 to 44.5 mm Hg), respectively, at rest and 14.9 L/minute (9.0 to 23.1 L/minute) and 29.2 mm Hg (24.7 to 33.9 mm Hg), respectively, during hyperventilation. The PETCO 2 (our marker for ventilation) for the N95 O 2 mask and the nonrebreathing mask (also pooled for all O 2 flow rates) was equivalent to that obtained by testing the Hi-Ox 80 (39. 6 The Hi-Ox 80 consistently delivered a higher FIO 2 than the other masks, with greater margins at higher O 2 flow rates ( Figure 3 ). The FIO 2 obtained from the N95 O 2 mask was clinically equivalent to that from the nonrebreathing mask for both resting ventilation and hyperventilation. During resting ventilation and at 8 L/minute O 2 flow, the FIO 2 delivered by the Hi-Ox 80 was 0.90 (0.79 to 0.96), consistent with that predicted by the package insert. Under these conditions, the FIO 2 with the N95 O 2 mask and nonrebreathing mask was 0.68 (0.60 to 0.85) and 0.59 (0.52 to 0.68), respectively. For protective function, the N95 O 2 mask provided the same efficiency of filtration of outside particles as the N95 mask at O 2 flow rates of 2 and 10 L/minute (Figure 4 ). Median particle concentrations inside the N95 and N95 O 2 masks at 2 and 10 L/minute were less than 1% of those outside the mask (0.0% to 3.0%). In contrast, high particle concentrations were found inside the nonrebreathing mask, with O 2 flow at 2 L/minute (53% [37% to 87%]) and with O 2 flow at 10 L/minute (17% [3% to 37%]). For isolation function, the N95 O 2 mask provided the same efficiency of filtration of inside particles as the N95 mask. There was no increase in external particle concentrations above background values measured outside either mask, regardless of distance from the mask or O 2 flow into the N95 O 2 mask ( Figure 5A , B). In contrast, particle concentrations measured outside the nonrebreathing mask were markedly higher than background values at 6 cm and 50 cm from the mask: 800% (62% to 3100%) and 450% (100% to 12,000%), respectively, when O 2 flow rates were 2 L/minute and 330% (15% to 1300%) and 95% (33% to 3000%) when flows were 10 L/minute.
