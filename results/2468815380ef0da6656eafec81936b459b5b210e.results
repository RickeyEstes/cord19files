Fifty drills at 41 clinics were conducted. In total, 25 clinic networks participated with 14 networks participating in multiple rounds (Table 1 ). Twenty clinics representing 18 networks participated in round 1 of drills in April 2015; 14 clinics representing 13 networks in round 2 from March through April 2016; and 16 clinics representing 13 networks in the third and final round from November through December 2016. In terms of clinic type, 45 (90%) of the clinics were FQHCs, 4 (8%) were primary care clinics, and 1 (2%) was a FQHC look-alike (a center that fulfills requirements to be a FQHC but is not yet formally certified). Clinics from all five NYC boroughs participated, with 19 in Brooklyn, 16 in Manhattan, 6 in the Bronx, 6 in Queens, and 3 in Staten Island. In terms of drill scenario, 32 were for ILI and 17 were for measles; the scenario for one drill is unknown due to missing data. All but one drill screened the patient within the specified time; in that drill, 18 min elapsed without the patient being called. In the remaining 49 drills, time to screening from entry was known for 45 drills, with a median duration of 2 min (IQR 1-6 min); seven drills (16%) took more than 10 min to screen. HSEEP grading for screening was known for all 50 drills; 35 (70%) of the drills performed the screening without any challenges, 8 (16%) with some challenges, 6 (12%) with major challenges, and 1 (2%) was unable to perform screening. Masking status was known for 47 drills, of which the patient was masked in 38 (81%) drills. Among the 38 drills in which the patient was masked, 30 (79%) completed this step at the first point of contact in the clinic. Patients presenting with ILI were more likely to be masked compared with patients presenting as measles cases; 28 (93%) of 30 ILI patients were masked compared to 10 (59%) of 17 measles patients (p = 0.007), and 23 (77%) of 30 ILI patients were masked at the first point of contact compared to 7 (41%) of 17 measles patients (p = 0.026). Masking status data were missing from 3 drills. Among the 49 drills in which the patient was screened, 47 isolated the patient. In the remaining 2 drills, the patient was referred out either to an urgent care clinic or to an emergency room. Time to isolation from screening was known for 41 drills; median time was 1 min (IQR 0-2 min), with no drill taking more than 5 min to isolate. HSEEP grading for isolation was known for all 50 drills; 29 (58%) of the drills performed isolation without any challenges, 17 (34%) with some challenges, 2 (4%) with major challenges, and 2 (4%) were unable to perform isolation. Analyses for trends across rounds of the drill are shown in Table 2 . There were statistically significant trends in the number of patients masked at the first point of contact (47% in round 1 to 75% in round 3; p trend = 0.048) and median time to isolation (0-2 min; p trend = 0.022). There were no statistically significant trends by round in terms of drill scenario (ILI vs. measles), percentage of patients masked, median time to screening, percentage of drills that performed screening without any challenges, or percentage of drills that performed isolation without any challenges. Table 3 shows the median change in duration and quality of screening and isolation per round among 13 clinic networks that participated in multiple rounds of the drill. Six clinic networks participated in all three rounds, whereas seven participated in two of three rounds. There were no significant differences in either duration or quality for either screening or isolation in later rounds. In terms of perceived usefulness, among 132 drill participants from 42 drills representing 22 clinic networks, approximately 95% agreed or strongly agreed to each of Time to isolate 2 (0-2) min 0 (-0.5, 0.5) min .97 HSEEP grade S (S, P) 0 (0, + 0.5) categories .10 the following statements: the drill (1) was plausible and realistic, (2) included participants from appropriate disciplines, (3) engaged participants actively, (4) was appropriate for their level of training and experience, and (5) made them better prepared to deal with the hazards addressed. Qualitative analysis of after-action reports revealed recurring themes across drills for strengths of both screening and isolation (Table 4 ); these included presence of established protocols, trained staff, effective communication during the drill, and availability of relevant personal protective equipment and other technical requirements (e.g., masks, alcohol-based hand sanitizer, designated room for isolation). In terms of areas for improvement, recurring themes for screening were masking at the first point of contact (e.g., clarifying indications to include a measles-like case of fever and rash without respiratory symptoms), improving visibility of signage instructing patients with pre-specified symptoms and travel history to wear a mask, and optimizing registration procedures on paper-based or electronic medical records such that they do not hinder screening. For isolation, recurring themes for improvement were hand hygiene compliance, awareness and adherence to requirements (e.g., use of masks), explaining isolation protocol to patients to reduce psychological impact of sudden isolation, and using signage to indicate an occupied isolation room.
