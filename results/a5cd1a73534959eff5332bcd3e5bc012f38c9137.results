This study presents a novel approach to detecting viral transcripts in human tumor transcriptomes. In contrast to related approaches such as RINS and CaPSID that rely on subtracting reads homologous to human transcripts from the analysis, our novel method Virana assigns sequence reads to a combined human-viral reference database without discarding homology information (see Figure 1 ). By employing a particularly fast and sensitive read mapper, Virana gains sensitivity at discovering highly divergent and chimeric viral transcripts. In addition, this configuration allows for exploitation of multimaps (e.g., sequence reads mapping to several reference genomes with varying mismatch rates) to discover the homologous context of sequence reads with regard to viral and human reference sequences. Last, Virana employs chimeric alignments as well as de-novo assembly of unmapped sequence reads followed by taxonomic annotation in order to discover proviral integration events and novel viruses, respectively.
