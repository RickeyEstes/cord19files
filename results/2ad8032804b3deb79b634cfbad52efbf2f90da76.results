Quinoline compounds have shown potential as new scaffolds for the development of drugs with pharmacological activities against various human pathogens, including viruses. In order to investigate the possible antiviral potential of several new quinoline derivatives, we synthesized a number of derivative compounds and tested their ability to impair infection by DENV2 in a medium-throughput assay based on cellular ATP detection. Synthetically, substituted quinolines can be accessed from quinoline or quinoline N-oxide precursors. The N-oxides are typically prepared by N-oxidation of quinolines [22] . Several methods have recently been developed to prepare substituted quinolines from the unsubstituted precursors [23, 24] . We found that a modification of our recently developed N,N,N′,N′tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA)-catalyzed synthesis of 2-substituted quinolines [25] provided optimal yields and purity of quinolines 4 and 5 from 8-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (3), although the copper-catalyzed reaction of Grignard reagents [26] gave similar results (Scheme 1). Using the TMEDA-catalyzed reaction, 2-alkylated quinolines 4 and 5 were isolated in 54 and 79% yields, respectively. Subsequent chlorination with N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) under acidic conditions afforded the desired quinolines 1 and 2 in 78 and 80% yields, respectively Scheme 1 and Supplementary Materials). The final purity of both compounds 1 and 2 was verified to be higher than 97%. A total of 29 compounds, derivatives of the quinoline scaffold and related compounds (Table  S1 , Supplementary Materials), were tested at the prescreening stage, where both antiviral activity and cytotoxicity were assayed at a single concentration point of 30 µM (data not shown). Most of the tested compounds at the prescreening step either did not show inhibition against DENV2 or displayed evident cytotoxicity (data not shown). Based on the results of the prescreening stage, three compounds were selected for confirmatory tests, where antiviral activity and cytotoxicity were explored using a dose-response approach. In the confirmatory viral yield reduction assay, only compounds 1 and 2 showed consistent inhibitory activity against DENV2 in vitro ( Figure 1 ). Compound 1 showed inhibitory activity with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 3.03 µM and a half maximal cytotoxic concentration Scheme 1. Synthesis of quinoline derivatives, compounds 1 and 2.

In the confirmatory viral yield reduction assay, only compounds 1 and 2 showed consistent inhibitory activity against DENV2 in vitro ( Figure 1 ). Compound 1 showed inhibitory activity with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 3.03 µM and a half maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) of 16.06 µM, for an estimated selectivity index (SI) of 5.30 (Figures 1 and 2) . Compound 2 was also active, showing a higher SI of 39.5 (IC 50 : 0.49 µM, CC 50 : 19.39 µM) (Figures 1 and 2) . To further explore the mechanism of action of these compounds, we measured their capacity to impair the production of the viral envelope glycoprotein; a key protein of the flavivirus life cycle, the E glycoprotein was assessed by Western blot. For this purpose, DENV2-infected cells were treated with several concentrations of compounds 1 or 2. Forty-eight hours post infection, infected cells treated with compounds showed a significant dose-dependent reduction in the amount of envelope protein detectable by Western blots (Figure 3 ). The reduction was statistically significant for compound 1 at concentrations of 3 and 10 µM (p = 0.0016 and p = 0.0054, respectively) and for compound 2 at 10 µM (p = 0.0001).

The effect of this compound was not significant when added at the pre-infection period or during the adsorption phase only, suggesting that its action is not due to virucidal activity. While not significantly different from the virus control, compound 1 did show a small effect on virus infectivity when added only during the adsorption phase, suggesting some possible virucidal activity or impairment of the attachment/entry process. Compound 2 also significantly reduced the viral yield when present from the 1 h time point ( Figure 4B ). Similarly, its effect was not noticeable when added at pre-infection or during the viral adsorption. These results suggest that both compounds act, at least, affecting the early events of the virus life cycle. Since certain active antiviral molecules may act upon direct contact with virions, we wanted to further evaluate if compounds 1 and 2 had virucidal activity. Incubation of the DENV2 virions for one hour with 3 µM of compound 1 or 2, or the corresponding vehicle (DMSO), prior to adsorption to the monolayers did not show any significant reduction in the viral titer ( Figure 4C ). This result suggests that the antiviral effect of these molecules is not due to direct virucidal activity. Figure 4A ).
