The study population characteristics are provided in Table 1 . A comparison between our cohort of patients and patients hospitalized in the medical ward is shown in Table 2 . All patients were residents of Reunion Island and none had traveled recently. All patients were admitted for respiratory failure caused by viral pneumonia, but three patients also presented with pulmonary edema and one with septic shock. The median age of patients was 71 [67;76] years. Infections occurred in elderly patients presenting with several comorbidities who were admitted for serious conditions as evidenced by a high SAPS II and PSI scores. Time between onset of clinical signs and ICU admission was short for two patients presenting with chronic disease failure. The other patients presented with influenza-like illness several days before hospitalization. Chest radiographic findings were abnormal for all patients. Biological results revealed that all patients had leukocytosis with lymphopenia. Three patients required mechanical ventilation for 4, 6, and 7 days. No patient needed a respiratory assistance with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. All patients but one were treated with empirical antibacterial drugs: spiramycin and cefotaxime or piperacillin/tazobactam. One (14%) patient died: a 79-yearold woman presenting with type 2 diabetes, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and prior exposure to traditional firewood for cooking. She was admitted for acute exacerbation
