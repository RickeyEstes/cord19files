Of the 955 children studied, 595 (62.3%) were male. The median age was 14 months, with a range from 6 days to 15 years; the age distribution is shown in Table 1 . HCoVs OC43, HKU1, 229E and NL63 were detected in 19 stool samples (2.0%) and 50 nasal swab samples (5.2%). As expected, no SARS-CoV or SARS-like CoV was detected. In all but two cases of an HCoV RNA-positive stool sample, the same coronavirus was concomitantly detected in the nasal swab sample. HCoV RNA was not detected in any of the 20 available serum samples from the HCoVpositive children. The seasonality of the HCoV findings is shown in Fig. 1 . HCoV 229E and HKU1 circulated mainly during the first season, from September 2009 to August 2010, and OC43 and NL63 during the second season, from September 2010 to August 2011. HCoV OC43 was detected in the ARTI and AGE/ARTI groups but not in the AGE group (difference between the groups was statistically significant, p = 0.036; Table 2 ), whereas HKU1, 229E and NL63 were all found in each of the three study groups, with no significant differences between the AGE, ARTI and AGE/ARTI groups (p = 0.486 for HKU1, p = 0.079 for 229E and p = 0.362 for NL63; Table 2 ). The most commonly detected virus was HCoV NL63 (15 cases), followed by OC43 (13 cases), 229E (13 cases) and HKU1 (11 cases). HCoV NL63 was detected concomitantly in stool and nasal swab samples in seven (47%) of the positive cases, and OC43 in six (46%) of the positive cases. HKU1 and 229E were mainly detected in the nasal swab samples only. HCoVs were detected in eight (4.7%) stool samples of children in the AGE group, and in six of the eight cases, both stool and nasal swab samples were positive for the same HCoV. Additionally, in six of the eight cases another virus, rotavirus (three cases) or calicivirus (three cases), was also present in the same stool sample. In one child, an HCoV (HCoV 229E) was detected in the stool sample without other viruses and without a positive nasal swab sample. This 2-year-old boy was hospitalized overnight and received intravenous rehydration. In the ARTI group, HCoV RNA was found in 24 children (4.4%); in 19 cases, it was only found in the nasal swab and in five cases, it was concomitantly in stool sample and nasal swab. In the AGE/ARTI group, 17 children (7.1%) were positive for HCoVs. Both the stool and nasal swab samples were positive in six children, and the nasal swab was positive alone in 11 children. In five children with a positive stool sample, a known gastroenteritis virus (calicivirus in three cases, astrovirus in one and both in one) was detected in the same sample.
