Time-series plots of trends in crude asthma mortality, hospitalization rates, and pattern of drug utilization for each selected country are shown in Figures 1-3 . For Figure 1 , 3-year moving averages were plotted to smooth out fluctuations in mortality rates, and log-scale was also chosen to show the trends more clearly. Where no deaths were recorded in any year, 0.5 deaths was replaced to obtain valid estimates with log-transformation. A summary of data availability is presented in Table 1 . Results from regression analyses of trends and correlation analyses are presented in Tables 2-4 . Mixed trends in asthma mortality and hospitalizations were observed across Asia Pacific (Figs. 1, 2) . However, 6 of 9 selected countries with data available showed a decrease in mortality, albeit not statistically significant except for Japan (␤ 1 ϭ Ϫ0.163, P Ͻ 0.001). A small but significant increase was noted for Thailand (␤ 1 ϭ 0.093, P ϭ 0.006) ( Table 2) . Similar results were found for hospitalizations, with 4 of 5 countries registering a decrease, with significant decreases in both Singapore (␤ 1 ϭ Ϫ0.090, P Ͻ 0.001) and Australia (␤ 1 ϭ Ϫ0.067, P Ͻ 0.001), whereas a significant increase was observed in Taiwan, ROC (␤ 1 ϭ 0.065, P Ͻ 0.001) ( Table 2) . The general decline in asthma mortality and hospitalizations across Asia Pacific (Figs. 1, 2) coincided with significant increases in C:R ratios across the region (Fig. 3) . Despite China having the highest increase in C:R (␤ 1 ϭ 0.190, P Ͻ 0.001), an increase in mortality was observed, although not significant. In contrast, Japan, which had a comparable increase in C:R (␤ 1 ϭ 0.188, P Ͻ 0.001), showed the highest significant decrease in mortality rates (Table 2) . Negative associations were also observed for both asthma mortality and hospitalizations with C:R in Australia, Hong Kong SAR, and Singapore, but these were not statistically significant (Table 3) . No significant correlations existed between trends in prevalence of current wheeze and trends in asthma mortality or hospitalizations. Interestingly, a negative correlation (P ϭ 0.072) was found between prevalence in 13-to 14-year-olds and mortality (Table 4) .
