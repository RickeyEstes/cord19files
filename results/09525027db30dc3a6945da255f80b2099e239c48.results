PRV utilizes both human and swine nectin-1, but not HVEM, for cell entry Of the thus-far identified gD receptors, nectin-1 has been shown to mediate the cell entry of multiple alphaherpesviruses [5, 8, 12] . Several previous studies demonstrated that both human (HU-nectin-1) and swine nectin-1 (SW-nectin-1) serve as a cellular receptor for PRV [13, 28] . As a step towards understanding the basis of receptor recognition by the virus, we first reconfirmed the nectin-1 mediated viral entry using the PRV vaccine strain Barth K61 (28) in CHO-K1 cells. CHO-K1 cell lacks any of the known alphaherpesvirus receptors and is therefore resistant to PRV infection [29] . Transient expression of HU-and SW-nectin-1 in CHO-K1, however, suffices the cells for PRV entry. In the presence of either the human or the swine receptors, PRV infection with significant cytopathic effects was observed; whereas HU-HVEM failed to promote the entry of the virus (Fig 1A) . This is consistent with previous reports showing that nectin-1, but not HVEM or 3-O-S-HS, could mediate the PRV infection [8] . To quantitatively compare the cell entry mediated by HU-and SW-nectin-1, we further set up a cell based fusion assay as previously applied in the HSV studies [22] . With CHO-K1 cells, remarkable cell fusion could be observed when the nectin-1-expressing cells are mixed with cells expressing HSV gD along with the viral fusion executor of gB, gH and gL. By replacing the HSV glycoproteins with the PRV homologs, significant increase in the luciferase activity was recorded, which is highly indicative of fusion of the cells. On the whole, the cell fusion mediated by HU-and SW-nectin-1 is quantitatively equivalent (Fig 1B) , indicating similar capacities of gD engagement by the two receptors.
