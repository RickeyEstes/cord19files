In March of 2019, we detected Betacoronavirus in three animals from two sets of smuggling Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) (n=26) intercepts by Guangdong customs [11] . All three animals suffered from serious respiratory diseases and failed to be rescued by the Guangdong Wildlife Rescue Center [11] (Table S2) . Through metagenomic sequencing and de novo assembling, we recovered 38 contigs ranging from 380 to 3,377 nucleotides, and the nucleotide sequence identities among the contigs from these three samples were 99.54%. Thus, we pooled sequences from three samples and assembled the draft genome of this pangolin origin coronavirus, so called pangolin-CoV-2020 (Accession No.: GWHABKW00000000), which was approximately 29,380 nucleotides, with approximately 84% coverage of the virus genome ( Figure 1a ). Strikingly, genomic analyses suggested the pangolin-CoV-2020 has a high identity with both 2019-nCoV and Bat-CoV-RaTG13, the proposed origin of the 2019-nCoV [10] (Figure 1b; Figure 1c ). The nucleotide sequence identity between pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV was 90.23% whereas the protein sequence identities for individual proteins can be up to 100% (Table S3; Table S4 ). The nucleotide sequence between pangolin-CoV-2020 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 was 90.15% whereas that for the corresponding regions between 2019-nCoV and author/funder. All rights reserved.

The nucleotide sequence identities of the surface glycoprotein Spike (S) protein genes between pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV was 82.21%, and the Bat-CoV-RaTG13 and 2019-nCoV shared the highest sequence identity of 92.59% (Table 1 ). There was a low similarity of 72.63% between the S genes of pangolin-CoV-2020 and SARS-CoV. Nucleotide sequence analyses suggested the S gene was relatively more genetic diverse in the S1 region than the S2 region ( Figure   2a ). Furthermore, the S proteins of pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV had a sequence identity of 89.78% (Table 2) , sharing a very conserved receptor binding motif (RBM) ( Figure S1 ), which is more conserved than in Bat-CoV-RaTG13. These results support that pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV, and SARS-CoV could all share the same receptor ACE2. The presence of highly identical RBMs in pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV means that this motif was likely already present in the virus before jumping to humans. However, it is interesting that both pangolin-CoV-2020 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 lack a S1/S2 cleavage site (~680-690 aa) whereas 2019-nCoV possess ( Figure S1 ). Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the S genes of pangolin-CoV-2020, 2019-nCoV and three bat origin coronaviruses (Bat-CoV-RaTG13, Bat-CoV-CVZXC21, and Bat-Cov-CVZC45) were genetically more similar to each other than other viruses in the same family ( Figure 2b ). The S gene of Bat-CoV-RaTG13 was genetically closer to each other than pangolin-CoV-2020, Bat-CoV-CVZXC21, and Bat-Cov-CVZC45. Similar tree topologies were observed author/funder.

At the whole genomic level, the 2019-nCoV is also genetically closer to Bat-CoV-RaTG13 than pangolin-CoV-2020 ( Figure 1c ).
