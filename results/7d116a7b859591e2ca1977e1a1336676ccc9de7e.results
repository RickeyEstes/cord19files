IFNg, CXCL9, and CXCL10 levels track together and accompany the deteriorating presentation of laboratory and clinical features of sHLH in mice. An increase of circulating cytokines has been described in the TLR9induced sHLH model. 16 To strengthen these data, we conducted experiments which followed the kinetics of IFNg and IFNg-dependant chemokines (CXCL9 and CXCL10) in blood and in tissues. The stimulation of TLR9, provoked by DNA rich in CpG-ODN motifs repeatedly injected led to hypercytokinemia (Fig 1A) . Within 6 hours after the first TLR9 stimulation, IFNg, IL-6, TNFa, CXCL9, and CXCL10 were elevated in the blood. This was accompanied by de novo messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis of proinflammatory mediators in the liver ( Fig 1B) and spleen ( Supplementary Fig 1) . After subsequent TLR9 stimulations, IFNg, CXCL9, and CXCL10 levels oscillated similarly suggesting that these chemokines may be biomarkers of fluctuations in IFNg activity. Conversely, IL-6 and TNFa levels were measured at a more stable rate (Fig 1) . Development of hypercytokinemia leads to weight loss and alterations in hematological parameters. Within 24 hours after the first CpG-ODN injection, mice lost a significant amount (7%) of their starting weight (Fig 2) . Lymphocyte counts in the blood also decreased rapidly and remained low throughout the study (Fig 2) . With repeated TLR9 stimulation, platelet and erythrocyte counts steadily decreased, whereas splenomegaly was increasingly evident (Fig 2) . Interestingly, serum ferritin, a marker of an inflammatory response, spiked at day 7, after the 4th CpG-ODN injection (Fig 2) , which correlated with the observed maximal levels achieved in blood for the inflammatory mediators studied (Fig 1A) . Taken together, we observed that repeated TLR9 stimulation with CpG-ODN in mice recreates a hypercytokinemia albeit with peaks and troughs that manifest as a steady deterioration in laboratory and clinical parameters. IFNg production in tissue compartment correlates with TLR9-induced hypercytokinemia. Owing to our detailed study of blood cytokines, we revealed a dynamic fluctuation of IFNg in the blood while disease progression was sustained. We hypothesized that most IFNg may be produced and consumed in tissues, whereas the fluctuating serum levels represent a spillover of the cytokine into the blood. To investigate this possibility, we set out to quantify the amount of IFNg produced in tissues, by injecting the anti-mIFNg mAb, XMG1.2, to mice while receiving the disease inducing CpG-ODN. We took advantage of a previously described phenomena, 32 in which IFNg in tissues is captured by XMG1.2, that then drains via the lymphatics into the blood leading to accumulation of the cytokine as a complex to the mAb. Thus, this cytokine-mAb complex measured ex vivo in blood samplings is thus directly proportional to the total amount of IFNg produced by the organism. Administration of XMG1.2 before the first CpG-ODN injection resulted in IFNg measured at 1.7 ng/ mL in serum, reflecting the basal level of production in naive mice (Fig 3A) . After CpG-ODN injection, a marked increase in total IFNg reaching .100 ng/mL (Fig 3A) was measured in the XMG1.2-injected mice as compared to the levels measured without cytokine-mAb complex stabilization (0.6 ng/mL; Fig 1A) . Peak levels of total IFNg reached 280 ng/mL (Fig 3A) , a 169-fold increase over the basal total IFNg levels in naive mice and a 470-fold increase over levels detected in serum of CpG-ODN treated mice without XMG1.2 (Fig 1A) , demonstrating the considerable production of IFNg in tissues from mice undergoing TLR9induced hypercytokinemia. Owing to these levels of total IFNg produced in this model and our experience with other IFNg-induced disease models, for example, pHLH, 31 we next evaluated if the dose of 100 mg/kg or XMG1.2-treated mouse.

IFNg, interferon g; sHLH, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. To this end, mice were injected with XMG1.2 24 hours post CpG-ODN administration, and the mRNA expression in liver of the IFNg-dependent gene, CIITA pIV, was evaluated over time. As a robust induction of CIITA pIV, mRNA was observed after the first CpG-ODN injection, the elimination of CIITA pIV expression after XMG1.2 administration demonstrated that complete neutralization of IFNg in tissues was achieved (Fig 3B) . Tissue-derived IFNg is responsible for clinical and laboratory features in TLR9-mediated cytokine release syndrome. Having made the novel observation that high levels of IFNg originate from the tissues after TLR9 stimulation, we performed a kinetic study to determine the degree to which the cytokine was associated with the features of sHLH throughout the duration of the model. XMG1.2 was administered on day (d) 1 (post the peak of total IFNg), d3, and d6 to mice challenged with CpG-ODN on d0, 2, 4, and 7. Serum levels for both IL-6 and TNFa were significantly lower and maintained close to baseline ( Fig 3C) . Interestingly, neutralization of IFNg in tissues resulted in the decrease in mRNA levels for IL-6 in the liver ( Fig 3D) and spleen (Fig 3E) , and for TNFa in the liver (Fig 3D) . IFNg neutralization significantly reduced body weight loss, splenomegaly, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hyperferritinemia ( Fig 4A) . Liver inflammation, illustrated by cellular infiltration creating inflammatory cell foci, was also reduced after administration of XMG1.2 ( Fig 4B) . The role for IFNg at a later stage of disease was also investigated, that is, when clinical features and laboratory abnormalities were established (Fig 2) , and total IFNg production was at a plateau ( Fig 3A) . Neutralization of IFNg from d4 resulted in the abrogation of the hyper-release of IL-6 and TNFa to the blood (Fig 5A) . Moreover, this delay IFNg neutralization resulted in a reduction of body weight loss and an improvement in splenomegaly (Fig 5A) . Thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hyperferritinemia were ameliorated although lymphopenia remained unchanged (Fig 5A) . The delayed inhibition also controlled liver inflammation as a significant drop in cellular infiltration as well-decreased IL-6 and TNFa mRNA expression were observed (Fig 5B) . Taken together, the efficient neutralization of the high rate of tissue production of IFNg was required to induce a significant amelioration of the cytokine release syndrome parameters. Blood and tissue CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels are associated with IFNg activity in TLR9-induced cytokine release syndrome. To further support the hypothesis that these 2 chemokines mirror IFNg activity, we demonstrated that IFNg neutralization (starting at either at d1 or d4 of disease onset), resulted in a significant decrease in liver mRNA levels of CXCL9 and CXLC10 levels ( Fig 6A) . The significant decrease in CXCL9 and CXCL10 in blood (Fig 6B) is further testament to the shutdown of chemokine production in tissues. These results suggest that serum levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 reflect IFNg activity in TLR9induced sHLH. Confirming this association, a significant correlation of serum IFNg levels with serum concentration of CXCL9 and CXCL10 was observed in CpG-treated mice in absence of XMG1.2 ( Fig 6C) . Finally, correlative analysis was performed and demonstrated that levels for the IFNg-dependant chemokines in blood were associated to syndrome parameters including thrombocytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and lymphopenia (Fig 7) . However, no significant correlation was seen between serum IFNg and the previously parameters, excepting for lymphocyte counts (P 5 0.0022, Fig 7) . These data reinforce that circulating CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels mirror tissue IFNg activity and, importantly, disease parameters in blood. mAb, XMG1.2 (dotted line), or an isotype control mAb (solid line), on days 4 and 6 (black filled triangles). (A) IL-6 and TNFa serum concentrations were quantified in a multiplex assay using the Luminex technology; body and spleen weights were monitored and blood parameters including lymphocyte, platelet and red blood cell counts were measured using a hemavet analyzer and serum ferritin was measured by ELISA. (B) Liver inflammation was evaluated on day 8 by calculating the area that contained foci of leukocyte infiltration as illustrated in (B). The graph represents the quantitative analysis of at least 9 fields per liver capturing the fold increase of area as compared to untreated mice (ie, no CpG injection); each symbol represents an individual mouse; horizontal lines represent the mean values. IL-6 and TNFa mRNA levels were evaluated by qPCR in the liver. The samples from day 0 were collected before the CpG-ODN injection, whereas samples from day 4 and day 7 were collected 6 hours after CpG-ODN injection. Samples from the day of a mAb administration were collected before the injection. Values are the mean 6 standard error of the mean. Data are representative of 1 experiment. Statistics were performed at each time point between isotype control and XMG1.2-treated groups. *P , 0.05, **P , 0.01, and ***P , 0.001 were obtained using the 1-tailed nonparametric Mann-Whitney U t test. AU, arbitrary unit; IL-6, interleukin 6; TNFa, tumor necrosis factor a; mRNA, messenger RNA; qPCR, quantitative PCR; sHLH, secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Table I ), blood levels of IFNg (median 34.7 pg/mL, IQR 23.9-170.1), CXCL9, and CXCL10 (CXCL9: 33,598 pg/mL, IQR 3083-127,687; CXCL10; 4420 pg/mL, IQR 799-8226) were markedly higher than those of patients sampled during nonactive disease following effective treatment (IFNg ,3.5 pg/mL, IQR ,3.5-6.5; CXCL9: 745 pg/mL, IQR 469-1098; and CXCL10; 132 pg/mL, IQR 74-157) (Fig 8A) . From 20 blood samples obtained at different times during active sHLH disease, IFNg levels significantly correlated with levels of CXCL9 and, to a lesser extent, of CXCL10 (Fig 8B) . We also investigated the correlation of circulating levels for IFNg, CXCL9, and CXCL10, with laboratory parameters of sHLH including neutrophil and platelet counts, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and alanine transaminase levels. We found that blood CXCL9 levels were significantly correlated with all the 5 laboratory parameters studied (Fig 8D) . IFNg and CXCL10 levels were also significantly correlated with the previously mentioned disease parameters, with the exception being between IFNg and platelet counts (Fig 8C) , and CXCL10 and ferritin levels (Fig 8E) , not reaching significance. Taken together, our findings in patients further suggest the pathogenic role for IFNg in sHLH and advocate the use of blood levels for CXCL9 and CXCL10 as potential biomarkers of IFNg activity in sHLH.
