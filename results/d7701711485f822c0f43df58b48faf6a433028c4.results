The time-dependent reproduction number for all and by type are presented in Distributions of median R t for entire study period for overall, for type and by each transmission type are shown in Figure 3 . Median R t are 5.8 (95%CrI: 0.6-11.0), 6.1 (95%CrI: 0.5, 11.8), 0.9 (95%CrI: 0.3, 1.5) for overall and by type (passenger, crew). Examining inter-type and within-type transmission, R t estimates greatly vary across transmission types: 5.6 (95%CrI: 0.3, 10.9) for passenger to passenger, 0.6 (95%CrI: 0.1, 1.1) for passenger to crew, 0.5 (95%CrI: 0.2, 0.8) for crew to passenger, 0.5 (95%CrI: 0.3, 0.8) for crew to crew. Although vaccines are still in early development stages as of February 2020, based on our findings, the corresponding target vaccination coverage to contain the outbreak in this confined setting were estimated at 91% and .

Our latest estimate of the overall R t is 0.35 (95%CrI: 0.02, 2.19), with only 2% of R t estimates lying above the epidemic threshold of 1.0. Passenger and crew also have total (within-type and inter-type) R t values largely below the epidemic threshold, with only small percentages at 0% and 9% above the epidemic threshold, respectively (Table   3 ).
