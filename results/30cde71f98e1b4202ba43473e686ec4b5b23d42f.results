Combining systems: testing two biological applications by mixing them. Previously, we have shown our ability to robustly and accurately monitor proteolytic cleavage by both the HIV-1 PR and HIV-1 Env boundary platforms. 28, 29 Although the two assays are based on fluorescence, they are very different in nature. The first relies on eGFP fluorescence (when PR is inhibited), and the second on classical fluorescently labeled antibodies (presence of the second tag when cleavage is inhibited; Fig. 1 ). Antibody staining allows for flexibility as one can use an array of fluorescently labeled antibodies (primary or secondary). We thus investigated the possibility of exploiting the distinct fluorescent features of the two assays to analyze them in combination. For that purpose, we utilized allophycocyanin (APC)-labeled secondary antibodies against the HA tag for the second assay, as APC's emission spectrum does not overlap with eGFP. Through retroviral technology and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), a distinct cell population can be easily amplified based on the appropriate fluorescent phenotype. 69, 70 Our goal is to ultimately obtain cell lines expressing two independent assays to provide a robust tool for the screening of antivirals. It is thus critical that we first prove these assays can be expressed independently and then tested in conjunction, whether by mixing cells or in the same cell background. In order to do so, we first performed transfection experiments including all necessary elements of the assay and then proceeded to amplify selected sorted populations with the goal of obtaining stable cell lines expressing each engineered assay. We proceeded with the first assay for monitoring HIV-1 PR, which is much more complex than the second that monitors cleavage of HIV-1 Env as it relies on three plasmids rather than one (refer to "Materials and Methods" section for details). Cells were induced with doxycycline (Dox) and analyzed for inhibition in the presence of the PI darunavir (DAR) as observed by the presence of eGFP-positive cells. As expected and shown in Figure 2 , there is a drastic increase in eGFP-positive cells after several rounds of flow cytometry analysis, as compared to the original co-transfection experiments. This illustrates the usefulness and importance associated with engineering stably expressing cell lines, particularly when they are intended for further use in screening and/or multiplexed applications. Figure 3 shows that each of the individual assays depends on different fluorescence-based detection methods and can be clearly distinguished from each other. The individual PR assay shows a robust shift to the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) channel (eGFP positive following DAR treatment; top panels). The individual Env assay shows a robust shift to the APC channel (HA positive; bottom panels). Importantly, when combined by mixing them at equal ratios, the mixed population depicts the expected phenotype at the anticipated rate of approximately 50%. When the mixed population is treated with the PI DAR, a shift of approximately half of the population to FITC positive is observed (Fig. 4A, green window) . Similarly, when stained with anti-HA antibody, a shift of approximately half of the population to APC positive is observed (red window). These results clearly illustrate that each assay can be distinguished within the mixed population based on the specific treatment or staining conditions required for each system. The gated FITC positive (green population) and APC positive (red population) can be combined and yet be clearly distinguished (Fig. 4B) . Combining systems: testing two biological applications by combining them in the same cell. Combining samples by mixing them and differentiating between multiple assay readouts is useful but not necessarily special or novel. 71, 72 It remains to be seen that a cell line harboring two independent assays can be used as a platform where each one of the assays can be de-convoluted or distinguished from each other. Therefore, we proceeded to establish within the same cell the two biological systems we have previously developed in individual cells. For that purpose, a cell line expressing the assay for the HIV-1 PR, and thus all the elements necessary (the rtTA, the UAS-eGFP reporter, and the Gal4/ PR fusion), was transduced with retroviral particles carrying the HIV-Env assay construct. Figure 5 depicts the flow cytometry analysis of cells that were genetically engineered to express both assays. The first panel in Figure 5A shows the negative controls (untreated and unstained, without or with Dox). Following induction with Dox and treatment with the PI DAR, a large percentage of cells turn positive for eGFP (green window). In order to prove that these cells carry the Env assay as well, the cells were stained with HA antibody and APC-coupled secondary antibody to corroborate that the scaffold protein traveled to the cell surface. When stained for HA-APC, a large percentage of cells turns positive for HA (red window). Importantly, a large percentage of the population turns positive for both eGFP and HA (double-positive population in the purple window) when cells are both stained for HA-APC and induced and treated with DAR. In order to further demonstrate that the Env assay monitors Env clevage in these cells, the cells were treated with the furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (DCK) and stained with FLAG and APC-coupled secondary antibody (Fig. 5B) . A similar single-positive eGFP population (green window) appears in FLAG-APC-stained cells following Dox and DAR treatment. More importantly, a similar single-positive (red window) or double-positive population (purple window) appears following DCK treatment. This clearly demonstrates that these cells robustly express both assays simultaneously and can monitor PR activity, Env cleavage, or both. These results prove that each system can clearly and distinctly be monitored based on the treatment required for the detection of each.
