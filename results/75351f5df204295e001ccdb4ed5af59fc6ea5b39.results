One of the requirements of using the relative quantification method is that the PCR efficiency of both the target and endogenous control should be similar. The slope of the standard curves determines the PCR efficiencies. For SLAM and beta actin, the slope of the standard curve, generated using different dilutions (concentrations) of the cDNA were −3.34996 and −3.2583, respectively. The calculated PCR efficiencies {(10 −1/slope ) − 1 × 100} for SLAM and beta actin were 98.8% and 102.7%, respectively, indicating that their comparison using relative quantification was acceptable. The PCR efficiency of the PPRV 'M' gene was also 105%. SLAM expression in siRNA transfected B95a cell line is shown in Table 3 . All the siRNAs resulted in decrease in SLAM expression resulting in increase in Ct values in real-time PCR over untreated cells. The increase in Ct values ranged from 5 to 8 cycles, while the endogenous control (beta actin) Ct values were in the range of 19-20 cycles only. The decrease in SLAM expression ranged from 48.54-to 454.46-folds. Maximum decrease was seen with siRNA 3 transfected cells. Negative control siRNA transfection showed negligible decrease in SLAM expression. To further confirm, the reduction in SLAM expression at the protein level, flow cytometry was performed on siRNA transfected B95a cells using anti-human SLAM-FITC conjugate. The results of flow cytometry analysis are depicted in Table 4 and Fig. 1. 77 .56 percent of normal B95a cells expressed SLAM. Taking this as 100 percent expression, siRNA transfection decreased SLAM expression ranging from 31.02% to 68.64%. Negative control siRNA inhibited up to 13.28% level. Correlating with the real-time PCR results, siRNA 3 showed the highest decrease in SLAM expression at the protein level also. The siRNA transfected cells showed less pronounced CPE following PPRV infection. By 24 h post-infection (PI), normal (no siRNA transfection) PPRV infected cells exhibited ballooning and syncytium formation while siRNA transfected cells showed only clumping and rounding at that time point. Table 5 shows the effect of SLAM inhibition on PPRV replication and virus titres in B95a cell line. Decrease in SLAM expression resulting in increase in Ct values in real-time PCR for PPRV 'M' gene expression. The increase in Ct values ranged from 5 to 8 cycles, while the endogenous control (beta actin) Ct values were in the range of 19-20 cycles only. The folds decrease in virus replication (expression of PPRV 'M' gene assessed by TaqMan chemistry) varied from 12.84 to 143.71 for the different siRNAs tested. This was also reflected as decrease in infective virus titres that ranged from log 10 1.09 to 2.28 (12-190 times) . The siRNA3 transfected cells showed maximum decrease in virus replication (143.71-folds) and in virus titre (log 10 2.28 or 190 times). The virus titres in anti-SLAM antibody neutralized B95a cells were calculated to be 10 5.5 TCID 50 while in the SLAM neutralized cells it was reduced 100-folds to 10 3.5 TCID 50 based on haemagglutination test as indicator for presence of virus. The neutralization index was 2.0. The CPE was also delayed in the SLAM blocked cells. The SLAM unneutralized cells exhibited cell rounding by 24 h postinfection (Fig. 2b) and syncytium formation by 48 h PI (Fig. 2d) . However, in the SLAM blocked cells no changes were seen by 24 h PI (Fig. 2a) while cell rounding was evident by 48 h PI (Fig. 2c) .
