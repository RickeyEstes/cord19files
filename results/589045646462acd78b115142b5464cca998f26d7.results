Incidence of the Destructive Repair in Osteonecrotic Lesions. At 2 weeks after administration (4 weeks post-induction), the incidence of the destructive repair in the Anti-VEGF Group (1/8), Src-Inhibition Group (2/8) and Supplement & Inhibition Group (2/8) was all lower than that in the Control Group (5/8), whereas it was higher in the VEGF-Supplement Group (7/8) when compared to the Control Group. However, due to the sample size limitation, the difference was not statistically significant. At 4 weeks after administration surrounded by both fewer small-sized (36 , 200 mm) VLS and many medium-sized (200 , 400 mm) disseminated leakage particle-like structures (DLPLS); The Anti-VEGF Group showed only dilated and large-sized VLS, but neither small-sized VLS nor medium-sized DLPLS; The Src-Inhibition Group showed some dilated and large-sized VLS surrounded by more small-sized VLS but no medium-sized DLPLS compared to Control Group; In the VEGF-Supplement Group, although there are more small-sized VLS, but there are also more medium-sized DLPLS compared to the control; In the Supplement & Inhibition Group, there are more small-sized VLS with nearly no medium-sized DLPLS compared to Control Group ( Figure 4A ). In the histogram, the Control Group showed neither a continuous increase in small-sized VLS nor a continuous decrease in DLPLS when compared with the baseline. A continuous decrease in medium-sized DLPLS after administration in the Anti-VEGF Group, Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group was found with similar changing pattern. A continuous slight increase in smallsized VLS after administration was found in the Src-Inhibition Group, and a continuous significant increase in small-sized VLS after administration was found in both the VEGF-Supplement Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group, whereas a continuous decrease in small-sized VLS was only found in the Anti-VEGF Group ( Figure 4B ). Histomorphometry of Marrow Circulation. Figure 5 presents histomorphometry of marrow circulation at 0, 2 4 weeks post administration, including micro-vessel density (MVD), edema area (EA), and leakage particle size distribution. EA in the Anti-VEGF Group, Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group decreased continuously and significantly with similar changing pattern from the baseline after administration, whereas it was almost remained in the Control Group and even increased continuously and significantly in the VEGF-Supplement Group ( Figure 5B ). MVD in the Anti-VEGF Group decreased continuously and significantly from the baseline after administration, whereas it was almost maintained in the Control Group, increased slightly and continuously in the Src-Inhibition Group, and even increased continuously and significantly in the VEGF-Supplement Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group ( Figure 5C ). In comparison with the Control Group, leakage particles were less found in the Anti-VEGF Group, Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group, whereas there were a lot of leakage particles in the VEGF-Supplement Group ( Figure 5D ). Expression of phosphorylated Src and total Src in Bone Marrow. Phosphorylated Src protein expression in the Anti-VEGF Group, Src-Inhibition Group and Supplement & Inhibition Group was decreased continuously and significantly from the baseline with similar changing pattern after administration, whereas it did not change in the Control Group or further significantly increased in the VEGF-Supplement Group. On the other hand, the total Src expression level remained stable from baseline to 4 weeks post administration, and did not show difference among groups ( Figure 6 ).
