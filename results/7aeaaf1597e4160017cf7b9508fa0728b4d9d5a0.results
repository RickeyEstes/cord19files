Fecal samples from 498 equine patients >1 year of age were tested for ECoV by qPCR over the specified time period. Thirtythree adult horses met the study criteria, including 12 mares, 20 geldings, and one stallion. Of these 33 horses, 30 were found to positive for ECoV only, and 3 were diagnosed with ECoV and additional co-infections. Co-infections included one horse with Salmonella spp. infection (identified by fecal qPCR), one with Actinobacillus equuli peritonitis (identified by abdominal fluid culture), and one with both rhinitis B virus (identified by nasal swab qPCR) and Salmonella spp. (Group E; identified by fecal culture) infections. Horses were a median of 11 (range 2-37) years of age and of mixed breeds (Supplementary material). Thirty horses were hospitalised, and 3 were seen as outpatients or by the ambulatory service. Horses positive for ECoV were presented for a combination of complaints elaborated in Table 1 . Colic signs tended to be mild, with one horse presenting with net reflux following nasogastric intubation and two presenting with large colon impactions. Data on housing were lacking in 13/33 horses. Nineteen of the 20 horses (95%) for which information was available were housed at a multihorse facility with horse traffic, and one horse (5%) was distinctly not from a high traffic environment. One horse was associated with a barn with five additional confirmed ECoV cases, two study horses were from the same barn and hospitalised within the same week, and three separate study horses were associated with horses with fevers at their respective farms. Five of 22 horses (23%) for which travel history was available had traveled to a horse show within the previous 3 weeks. Twenty-one of 33 (64%) cases occurred in colder months, with a significant difference between the number of cases seen between January and March and the other three seasons ( Fig. 1 ; P < 0.02). Thirty-three horses negative for ECoV on fecal qPCR were identified as controls, including 15 mares, 17 geldings, and one stallion. Horses were a median of 10 (1-30) years of age and of mixed breeds (Supplementary material). Presenting complaints are found in Table 1 . Two of 21 horses (10%) for which travel history was available had recently been to a show. Housing information was available in 18 horses, of which 12/18 (67%) were housed at a facility with an open herd. Final clinical diagnoses included fever of unknown origin (n = 6/33; 18%), colitis (n = 5/33; 15%), colic (n = 2/ 33; 6%), diarrhea (n = 2/33; 6%), colic and fever of unknown origin (n = 2/33; 6%); Anaplasmosis (n = 2/33; 6%); and large colon impaction (n = 2/33; 6%).
