The coding sequence for the M protein's exterior of PEDV was cloned in the pGEX-6p-1 expression vector and the rMP with a 26 kDa fusion protein GST binding at the N-terminus was expressed as IBs in the bacterial cytosol. After SDS-PAGE analysis, a protein band corresponding to the expected molecular mass of approximate 31 kDa was revealed in IPTG-induced culture (Fig. 1, lane 3) which was not present in the culture before the induction (data not shown) or in the control culture after the induction (Fig. 1, lane 2) . With the analysis of software AlphaImager2200, the product of expression reached approximately 45% in the total bacteria protein of each 1 ml culture, and the 4.4 kDa recombinant truncated M 0 protein reached approxamitely 7%. It was crudely purified by the extraction of IBs and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography. The purity was confirmed by single band in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane 2) . In order to identify the specific reactivity of rMP, Western blotting was carried out using the McAb anti-PEDV M protein and a band of 31 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 2) showed the strong and specific reaction between them whereas the same size band was not demonstrated in negative control (data not shown). Contrarily, the reactivity of mouse polyclonal antiserum of rMP with the purified PED virion was revealed by the band of approximate 29 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 2) as well as by the positive control (Fig. 3, lane 3) . As shown in Fig. 4 , the rMP antigen strongly reacted with the positive porcine polyclonal anti-PEDV serum with a band of 31 kDa in The optical density (OD) value of plot a1 (Fig. 5A ) decreased progressively with serial dilutions of rMP antigen from 1:50 to 1:800, which showed the sensitive reactivity of rMP antigen combining McAb anti-PEDV M protein, whereas, the OD value of control plot a2 and negative GST antigens control plot b1 and b2 (Fig. 5B) were very low between in 0.10 and 0.25. This rMP-ELISA results correlated with the results of the immunoblotting assay well, and the specific reactivity of rMP was identified.
