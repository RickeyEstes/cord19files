Human differentiated neuronal cell lines were susceptible to a productive HCoV-OC43 infection As we have previously shown that neurons are the main target of HCoV-OC43 infection in the mouse CNS (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) and in NT2-N/human primary astrocytes co-cultures (M. Desforges and P. J. Talbot, unpublished data), we sought to study the early cellular events occurring in human neurons after HCoV-OC43 infection. First, we evaluated the susceptibility of the two wellcharacterized differentiated human neuronal cell lines NT2-N (Pleasure and Lee, 1993) and LA-N-5 (Hill and Robertson, 1998) to HCoV-OC43 (ATCC strain) infection. Immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the neuronal nature of the cells, as revealed by the detection of specific neuronal markers, NFM for LA-N-5 and Î²-tubIII for NT2-N (Fig. 1A , panels a and b), and their susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection was demonstrated by the detection of viral antigens (Fig. 1A , panels c and d). Furthermore, the infection was shown to be productive, as demonstrated by the increase in infectious HCoV-OC43 progeny virions in cell culture medium over a period of 72 h postinfection (Fig. 1B) .
