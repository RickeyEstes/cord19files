Using four different membrane proteins as examples, we provide extensive comparisons between the proposed non-uniform refinement algorithm and conventional uniform (homogeneous) refinement. For the purposes of this comparison, all processing is performed in cryoSPARC. Except for the type of regularization used in refinement, all parameters and stages of data analysis are held constant between uniform and non-uniform refinement. Both begin with the same ab-initio structure. The same algorithm is used for estimating alignments between 2D particle images and 3D maps, and the same CTF-corrected backprojection is used for direct (unregularized) 3D reconstruction. With each dataset the same mask is used for both uniform and non-uniform refinement when computing FSC curves. Masks are tested using phase randomization [3] to ensure they do not cause FSC bias. In addition, the same B-factor is used to sharpen both uniform and non-uniform refinement maps for each dataset. This consistency helps to ensure that the visible differences in 3D structure are due to algorithmic differences and not to differences in the amplification of high spatial frequencies. Where maps are colored by local resolution estimates, a straightforward implementation of Blocres [2] is used for resolution estimation. Finally, all non-uniform refinement parameters (other than symmetry) are held constant across all datasets. No manual masks are used during alignment, no masking is done to identify or separate the micelle or nanodisc regions, and no modifications are made to the 2D particle images.
