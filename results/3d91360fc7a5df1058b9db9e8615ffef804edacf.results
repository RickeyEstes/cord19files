From the 2095 references gathered from all the sources searched, a total of 97 English and non-English articles in Dutch, French, German, Japanese, and Spanish were accepted for inclusion ( Fig. 1) . Of the 97 included studies, 67 were case series, 14 were case-control studies, 5 were cohort studies, 5 were before-and-after studies, 5 were interrupted time series studies, and 1 was a time series study. As there were no studies that included a controlled comparison between ward closure and other interventions, the studies included in this review only allowed us to fulfill our first objective. Thus, this review purely focused on studies that described how ward closure was used as an outbreak control intervention and its impact on the outbreak. From the details provided within the context of the setting and population, the studies were organized firstly by the organ system(s) affected and secondly by the genus of the causative pathogen within each of these organ system categories. The organ system and genus categorization lent itself very well to an additional categorization by the mode of transmission, which is the basis for infection prevention and control precautions. The organ system categories included: "gastrointestinal," consisting of 17 studies; "respiratory," consisting of 11 studies; and "multiple/mixed," which includes the central nervous system, skin/soft tissue, urinary tract, eye, abdominal, and vascular or when more than one system is affected simultaneously and consisting of 63 studies. Of the studies in the third category, eight studies described predominant colonization, 12 studies described predominant infection, and 43 studies described a combination of colonization and infection. A sixth category included six studies that described the impact of infection control policies and of specific interventions on outbreak control. The modes of transmission relevant to our study included contact (both direct person-to-person and indirect via fomites and inanimate objects), droplet (via large droplets within a 1-2 m radius of the individual), and airborne (via small droplet nuclei capable of spreading over distance of greater than 2 m through the air [20] ). Gastrointestinal system (Table 1) We identified 17 studies [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] on outbreaks involving C. difficile, norovirus, rotavirus, Salmonella panama, small round structured virus, or small round structured virus and small round featureless virus. The primary mode of transmission for all these pathogens is direct person-to-person contact and indirect contact with contaminated surfaces [20] . The outbreaks occurred at single facilities, of which four occurred at the facility-wide level, and resulted in gastrointestinal system colonization and/or infection among 3-116 inpatients. Between two and ten intervention strategies were used in conjunction with ward closure to control the outbreaks. The definition of ward closure varied across the studies, and ward closure lasted between 3 days and 1 month among the studies that reported length of closure. Six studies defined ward closure as prohibiting new admissions to the affected clinical area (i.e., unit/ward/bay) [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Widdowson and colleagues reported on a study that utilized a phased approach, first halting new admissions and discharging all cases, then halting all admissions and discharging all patients from the area [27] . Three studies described completely stopping both admissions and transfers [28] [29] [30] . New admissions and transfers were stopped and transfers were limited in the studies by McCall and Smithson and by Stevenson and colleagues [31, 32] . In addition to stopping new admissions, transfers were limited in two studies [33, 34] and discharges were limited in one study [35] . In Hoffman and colleagues' study, only transfers were limited [36] . One study did not specifically describe their definition of closure [37] . Of nine studies that reported achieving outbreak containment, six attributed it to all the measures used [21, 25, 26, 28, 31, 33] , two studies attributed it to multiple, but not all the measures used [27, 37] , and one study did not specify which measures contributed to the outcome [36] . In two studies, the reduced number of new cases of colonization and infection was attributed to all the measures used [30, 32] . In two other studies, the authors were uncertain which measures contributed to the reduced number of new cases in one [35] , while authors of the other did not report which measures contributed to the reduced number of new cases [29] . Kienitz and colleagues reported that new cases continued to be identified until the pediatric ward was closed; however, newly admitted patients became infected until commercial milk was found to be the source of the outbreak [24] . In three studies, the authors did not report whether the outbreaks were controlled; however, they reported that either all or a number of the measures that were used could be effective at achieving outbreak control [22, 23, 34] .
