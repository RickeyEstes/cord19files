Phi6 infectivity versus RH. We measured the infectivity of Phi6 in droplets exposed to RHs of 23%, 33%, 43%, 61%, 75%, 85%, and 98% at temperatures of 14°C, 19°C, 25°C, and 37°C. As shown in Fig. 1 , virus infectivity, defined as the ratio of the concentration of PFU derived from the exposed droplets to the concentration of PFU in a control, depended on both RH and temperature. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of all data points showed there was a significant (P ϭ 0.0002) influence of temperature on Phi6 infectivity; however, at 14°C and 19°C, virus infectivity remained high across all RHs tested. There was a significant effect of RH (P Ͻ 0.0001) on Phi6 infectivity at each temperature tested, except at 19°C (P ϭ 0.0528). At 25°C and 37°C, we observed the same U-shaped RH dependence that Yang et al. (13) reported for influenza A virus in medium containing very little protein or none at all. At 25°C and 37°C, Phi6 infectivity was highest at RHs of less than ϳ60% and greater than 85%. At 37°C and between ϳ60% and 85% RH, there was an ϳ6-log reduction in infectivity. At 25°C, the relative infectious ratio was 3 log lower at 75% RH than at 98% RH. For comparison, at 37°C, there were ϳ6-log and ϳ2-log losses in Phi6 infectivity at 75% and 98% RH, respectively, a difference in infectivity of 4 log even though there was only an ϳ20-point difference in RH. To put these numbers into broader perspective, most environmental health and safety programs consider biological disinfection to occur when there is a 4to 5-log reduction in starting microbial concentrations. Phi6 infectivity versus AH. We tested the infectivity of Phi6 in droplets exposed to AHs ranging between 2.7 and 41.6 g · m Ϫ3 with temperatures ranging between 14°C and 37°C. As shown in Fig. 2 , at an AH of less than approximately 22 g · m Ϫ3 , the loss in infectivity was generally less than 2 log; however, when the AH was above approximately 22 g · m Ϫ3 , the loss in infectivity was typically greater than six orders of magnitude. All of the AHs above 22 g · m Ϫ3 correspond to a temperature of 37°C. Using a one-way ANOVA, we found that there was a significant effect of AH on infectivity (P Ͻ 0.0001). Phi6 infectivity versus temperature. To examine the effect of temperature on Phi6 infectivity (Fig. 3) , we held the RH constant at 75% and tested virus infectivity at nine temperatures: 14°C, 19°C, 22°C, 25°C, 28°C, 31°C, 34°C, 37°C, and 40°C. We observed the highest infectivity (28.97% Ϯ 2.45%) of Phi6 at the lowest temperature tested (14°C), and there was a reduction in infectivity of more than 6 log when the temperature was increased to 34°C. Between 14°C and 34°C, the virus infectivity decreased exponentially as the temperature increased. A one-way ANOVA revealed that temperature had a significant effect on Phi6 infectivity across all temperatures below 34°C (P Ͻ 0.0001); however, at temperatures above 34°C, there was no effect of temperature on virus infectivity (P ϭ 0.1293). For perspective, medical equipment meets the sterility assurance level when there is a 6-log reduction in the number of microorganisms. Environmental variables modulating Phi6 infectivity. Multiple linear regressions of infectivity against temperature, RH, and AH revealed that the slopes for temperature and AH were statistically significant, but that for RH was not. Partial F statistics confirmed that the addition of RH to a model already containing AH did not improve the model. However, the overall fit of the multiple regression model was poor, with an R 2 of 0.34. Using a multiple regression with the dependent variable of the log of infectivity improved the R 2 to 0.64. For this model, both AH and RH were statistically significant, based on partial F statistics, but temperature was not. The random forest was the most successful model applied. Figure 4 depicts the predicted infectivity versus the observed infectivity and shows that the percentage of explained variance (pseudo R 2 ) was 0.83. The relative importance of the variables, measured as the increase in the mean squared error when the variable was deleted from the model, was RH Ͼ temperature Ͼ AH. The normalized variable importance was 1.00, 0.99, and 0.84 for RH, T, and AH, respectively. The random forest model applied to a log 10 reduction in infectivity (instead of just relative infectivity) did not perform as well; the percentage of explained variance was 0.59. Infectivity in droplets versus aerosols. As some viral diseases are transmitted via the airborne route, the inevitable questions are whether virus inactivation is similar in stationary droplets and suspended aerosols and whether droplets, which are much easier to work with, can be used as a surrogate for aerosols in the study of virus inactivation. We measured virus stability in both droplets and aerosols under the same conditions, and the relationship between infectivity and RH was essentially the same in both (Fig. 5 ). The correlation coefficient was 0.98, and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicated that there is no significant difference between the two distributions (P ϭ 0.095).
