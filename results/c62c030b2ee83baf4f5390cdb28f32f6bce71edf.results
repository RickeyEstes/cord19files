The epidemic curve of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia during the two-year-study period displayed a higher dynamic outbreak of MERS cases in the period between March and May of each year. Despite the highly significant MERS peak observed particularly in 2014, the following year showed a lower number of MERS incidents (Fig. 2) . Cluster analysis based on geographical distribution of MERS cases depicted a higher representation of reported cases in the western (40.8%) and central (31.9%) regions. The lower number of cases was observed in the eastern region (20%). However, the least significant cases were recorded in northern (4.6%) and southern (2.7%) regions (Fig. 3) . The daily rate of sporadic cases was found the highest in central region (1.20, 95% CI: 1.07-1.41) in relation to western and eastern regions (0.08, 95% CI: 0.06-0.12 and 0.05, 95% CI: 0.02-0.09), respectively. A temporal analysis of reproduction number (R) led to potential variation in R value among study clusters. Both central and western regions scored the highest R value (R: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.64-1.36) and (R: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.52-1.25) respectively followed by the eastern region (R: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.57-1.05). R value was found at the lowest level in the Northern and Southern regions, respectively (R: 0.02 and 0.18). Therefore, the sensitivity analysis was performed for only western, central and eastern regions ( Table 2) . Sensitivity analysis demonstrated an insignificant impact of sporadic cases on the dynamic status of MERS CoV spread pattern. It was detected that the model used for the analysis was robust and that most of the cases were related and most likely evolved from index cases. The elevation of basic reproduction number (R > 1) was recorded in both central and western regions during the most of the study period (Figs. 4.1band 4.2d) and after exclusion of sporadic cases a significant decrease in the confidence interval was noted in comparison to the baseline scenario (Fig. 4.1a and c) . However, the MERS-CoV status remained roughly steady below the threshold limit (R < 1) even after exclusion of sporadic cases in the eastern region with a limited decrease in the confidence interval (Fig. 4.2e and f) .
