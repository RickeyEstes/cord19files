All rats survived to the scheduled termination date. Signs of excessive grooming and self-gnawing were noted in one rat in the 1.3 mg/kg dose group at days 1-2 posttreatment. The observer noted the findings as a comment on the animal's chart. There was no evidence of an open wound. Since day 3, there were no remarkable changes in animal behavior. The outcome weight of the three groups was similar: 265±23 g, 255±30 g, and 257±19 g for the rats in the 0.0, 0.65, and 1.3 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. There was no significant difference in organ weights of liver, spleen, heart, kidneys (both), brain, adrenal glands (both), uterus + cervix, and ovaries (both). There was no significant difference in the hematology values between the three groups. Average group differences were noted between the two clinical chemistry values. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) values were 16.50 ± 1.29, 15.50 ± 1.00, and 13.25 ±0.96 mg/dL for the control, 0.65 and 1.3 mg/kg groups, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values were 177.75 ± 34.45, 146.00 ± 22.70, and 109.00 ±21.52 (U/L), respectively. On gross examination, 2 rats in the vehicle control group and 1 in the 1.3 mg/kg had mild dorsal neck/interscapular skin excoriations or mild crusting. Injection sites could not be distinguished from surrounding skin in other rats. On microscopic examination one rat in the control group and one rat in the 0.65 mg/kg dose group had mild ulceration and chronic dermatitis involving the dorsal neck/interscapular skin, but mild-moderate hemorrhage and serosuppurative crust that were consistent with more recent injury, possibly related to conspecific trauma such as aggressive neck grooming by cage mates. Other findings included one rat in the control group: cystic uterine (endometrial) polyp less than 4mm diameter, and one rat in the 0.65 mg/kg dose group: ovarian cyst ∼1cm diameter. Mild cardiac changes (inflammation, degeneration, and fibrosis), mild nephropathy with pigment in tubule epithelium, mild lung inflammatory changes, and micromineralization of lung vasculature were observed in all groups. Pigmented macrophages in lymph nodes and spleen were observed in all rats. One rat in the 0.65 mg/kg group had an ovarian cyst and one in the vehicle control group had a uterine polyp. Pigment at various sites was consistent with hemosiderin, hematoidin, and or ceroid/lipofuscin. No unique microscopic lesions were associated with the test article.
