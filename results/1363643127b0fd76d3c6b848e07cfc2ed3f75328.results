Transcription and translation of HMPV proteins occur within 6 h following virus entry, with surface viral protein expression within 12 h and infectious progeny virions produced by 24 h. 12,13 Therefore, we designed an assay to infect cell monolayers with HMPV and perform readout of infectivity by immunostaining for viral protein expression on the cell surface at 48 h; thus, the assay captured all steps of the virus lifecycle except budding of progeny virions. We included the cell viability dye FM4-64 to normalize signal for cell number and to discriminate specific antiviral effect from cell toxicity. We tested multiple antibody and cell dye concentrations and conditions during optimization (data not shown). The layout of the assay plate is shown in Figure 1 . The sensitivity and dynamic range were determined using serial dilutions of neutralizing mAb DS7 against HMPV as a positive control for inhibition. DS7 exhibited micromolar activity, with 60% neutralization at 1.1 mg/mL and complete inhibition of HMPV at >3 mg/mL, as previously shown. 10, 11 To establish the reproducibility of the assay, we measured fluorescence in cells infected with HMPV and treated with or without neutralizing mAb DS7, performed in triplicate on different days, allowing us to determine well-to-well, plate-to-plate, and day-to-day variation. We used these data to measure the mean fluorescence from mAb-treated and untreated samples for determination of the coefficient of variation, which was AE0.17% for negative signal (cells alone) wells and AE0.01% for positive signal (cells þ virus) wells. A key measure of the suitability of a screening assay is the Z 0 , defined by the formula: Z 0 ¼ 1-[(3Â (standard deviation of positives) þ (3Â (standard deviation of negatives)]/(Mean positive-mean negative). 14 The Z 0 of the assay was 0.53, within the desired range of 0.5-1 15 (Figure 2) . Determination of reduced signal due to cell toxicity was a key aspect of the assay. Some compounds were toxic and reduced virus signal non-specifically as a consequence of reducing cell signal ( Figure 3 ). However, some compounds exhibited a clear virus-specific effect, with a reduction of virus signal but retained cell signal ( Figure 3 ). Fifty-one compounds were identified that statistically reduced virus signal by !2 SD from the mean (Supplemental Table 1 ). Most of the candidate hits fell into three main categories: (a) 3-hydroxy-3methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins; (b) DNA topoisomerase inhibitors; and (c) host factor inhibitors. Several of the compounds identified have been reported to exhibit in vitro activity against other RNA viruses (Table 1) , and some were hits in both biological replicates of the screen. To confirm whether the candidates exhibited specific activity against HMPV, we tested serial dilutions of selected compounds from Table 1 in a single-cycle viral growth assay, measuring virus signal and cell viability signal. Compounds were chosen to be tested in secondary assays based on biologic plausibility (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), frequency of hits in the compound class (topoisomerase inhibitors), or prior reports of antiviral activity. Mevastatin and simvastatin exhibited a modest, dose-dependent antiviral effect against HMPV but no cellular toxicity in this dosing range by luminescent cell viability assay (Figure 4 ). Acacetin and isoproterenol exhibited no significant antiviral or cytotoxic effect in the secondary assay ( Figure 5 ). However, irinotecan, etoposide, and ciclopirox exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity but modest inhibition of HMPV in addition to the cytotoxicity ( Figure 5 ).
