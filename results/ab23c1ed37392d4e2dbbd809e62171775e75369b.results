AM depletion before inoculation protected BALB/c mice from lethal MA15 infection SARS-CoV infection results in inefficient activation of macrophages and DCs in vitro [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] and slow virus clearance and a prolonged clinical course in humans [17, 18, 19] . Similarly, MA15 infection in vitro did not result in upregulation of CD86 on AM (Fig. S2 , Gating shown in Fig. S1 A) . To determine whether inhibitory AMs play a role in MA15-mediated severe lung disease, we depleted these cells by intranasal administration of clodronate liposomes (CL). CL are useful for depletion of AM, and to a lesser extent, alveolar/airway DCs [9] , but intranasal administration does not affect the level of circulating macrophages [32] . As a control, we treated mice with PBS as described previously [33] . BALB/c mice were treated with 75 ml of CL or PBS intranasally (i.n.) and total lung cells were harvested after enzymatic digestion. After 24 h, there was a decrease of AMs (CD11c + CD11b 2 siglec F + [34] ) in the lung, both in frequency (.70%) and absolute number (from 5-6610 4 to 1-2610 4 cells/lung), in CL, but not PBS-treated mice (Fig. S3 A and B) . By 48 h, approximately 90% of AMs in the lung were depleted (Fig. S3 A and B) . To determine whether there was a change in clinical disease after AM depletion, BALB/c mice were treated with 75 ml of CL and infected i.n. with 3610 4 PFU of MA15 virus. Mice were monitored daily for weight loss and mortality. At this virus dosage, control mice lost more than 20% of their body weight and 60%-70% of them died ( Fig. 1 A) , generally from day 6 to day 8 post infection (p.i.). Depletion of AM before inoculation (at day 21 and day 22) completely protected mice from this lethal infection and animals rapidly regained their body weight ( Fig. 1 A) . AM depletion at day 2 p.i. was not protective and may have resulted in more severe disease, as observed also in influenza A virus-infected mice [16] . Of note, 6 week old C57Bl/6 mice are resistant to MA15 infection and treatment at day 21 or 2 with clodronate had no effect on the clinical course in these mice (data not shown). Clodronate treatment resulted in enhanced kinetics of virus clearance, with virus cleared from all treated but not control BALB/c mice by day 7 p.i. (Fig. 1 B) . We next examined lung sections for changes in histology. There were no histological differences in the lungs between CL-treated and control mice at day 0, indicating that depletion of AMs did not result in significant inflammatory cell recruitment to the lung. From day 2 p.i., PBStreated mice developed a rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia with extensive edema and damage to bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 1 C) . Inflammatory infiltrates were consistently identified from days 2-to 6 p.i. CL-treated mice had a much better outcome with less destruction of the pulmonary architecture, but extensive alveolar, interstitial and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration ( Fig. 1 C, day 4 and day 6). Total lung cell numbers are shown in Fig. 2 A. Clodronate treatment, by removing AM, also altered the inflammatory milieu of the lungs. As a consequence, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1b, Il-6, IL-12, CCL2 and CCL3 increased within 24 hours of CL, but not PBS treatment, prior to virus infection. By day 2 p.i., levels of these cytokines were generally similar in CL and PBS-treated mice, consistent with the notion that a delayed, and possibly dysregulated, immune response contributed to severe disease in control mice (Table S1 ).
