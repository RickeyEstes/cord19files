3.1. Microglia are a primary source of CXCL13 during viral induced neuroinflammation CXCL13 transcripts are induced and sustained in both brain and spinal cord following JHMV infection (Phares et al., 2014 in the absence of apparent ectopic follicle formation. To evaluate if CXCL13 protein is preferentially maintained at distinct anatomical sites after initial clearance of infectious virus at day 14 p.i. CXCL13 was measured in brain, spinal cord and CSF by ELISA (Fig. 1A) . CXCL13 was significantly elevated at day 7 p.i. in all three samples (Fig. 1A) . While brain CXCL13 declined after day 7 p.i. CXCL13 remained elevated in spinal cord and CSF through day 21 p.i. relative to naïve counterparts (Fig. 1A) . To identify the predominant source of CXCL13, astrocytes, microglia and infiltrating monocyte-derived macrophages were purified at day 7 and 10 p.i. and assessed for CXCL13 transcripts. CXCL13 mRNA was predominantly expressed by microglia (Fig. 1B) , consistent with other studies (Rainey-Barger et al., 2011; Esen et al., 2014) 3.2. Diminished accumulation of B mem and ASC in absence of CXCL13 Naïve/early-activated B cells accumulate early within the CNS during JHMV infection and are gradually replaced by more differentiated B mem and ASC (Phares et al., 2014) , the latter distinguished by expression of the cell surface marker CD138, also known as syndecan-1. While ASC accumulation is CXCR3:CXCL10 dependent , chemokines mediating CNS recruitment of other B cell subsets are unknown. CXCL13 dependent accumulation of naïve/early-activated B cells (CD138 À -IgD + IgM + ) and B mem (CD138 À IgD À IgM +/À ) is supported by higher CXCR5 transcript expression in both populations relative to CNSderived CD138 + ASC ( Fig. 2A) . CNS accumulation of naïve/earlyactivated B cells, B mem , as well as ASC in infected WT and CXCL13 À/À mice was thus assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2B-E ). Fig. 2B shows a representative plot defining CD138 À IgD + IgM + naïve/early-activated B cells and CD138 À IgD À IgM +/À B mem . Although analysis focused on the spinal cord as the target of viral persistence and sustained CXCL13 levels, results were overall similar in the brain (data not shown). Total CD19 + B cell numbers were independent of CXCL13, regardless of the day p.i. (data not shown). The number of naïve/early-activated B cells, comprising the vast majority of B cells at day 7 p.i. but declining thereafter (Phares et al., 2014) , were also comparable between WT and CXCL13 À/À mice throughout infection (Fig. 2C) . B mem numbers were similar at day 7 p.i. in both groups; however, while they nearly doubled in WT mice between day 7 and day 14 p.i. B mem did not increase in the absence of CXCL13 (Fig. 2D ). By day 21 p.i. B mem numbers were comparable in both groups due to their decline in WT mice. Initial CD138 + ASC accumulation at day 14 p.i. was similar and increased by day 21 p.i. in both groups, but only reached $50% of the levels in WT mice in absence of CXCL13 (Fig. 2E) . Furthermore, the number of CD138 + ASC still remained lower in infected CXCL13 À/À versus WT mice at day 42 p.i. (CXCL13 À/À = 195 versus WT = 425). ELISPOT analysis of brain-and spinal cord-derived ASC was performed at day 21 p.i. to reveal whether impaired accumulation was restricted to virus-specific ASC and/or a specific Ig isotype. The number of total and virus-specific IgM + ASC were similar in the CNS of WT and CXCL13 À/À mice ( Fig. 3A and B) . However, the absence of CXCL13 resulted in 2-to 3-fold lower total and virus-specific IgG + ASC in brains and spinal cords, respectively ( Fig. 3C and D) . These data argue that CXCL13 is dispensable for early accumulation of naïve/early-activated B cell in the CNS, but promotes both B mem and specifically IgG + ASC accumulation as the naïve/early-activated B cell population declines.
