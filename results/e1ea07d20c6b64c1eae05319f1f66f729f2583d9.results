Two hundred and seventy eight potentially literature citations were screened. Only four RCTs with sufficient information were included for analyses, and all the four RCTs were published in full articles updated to December 2017 [8, [10] [11] [12] . The agreement for literature selection was excellent (Îº = 0.93). Seven hundred and sixty seven T2DM patients were enrolled in our pooled analyses, with 71-397 participants in the four eligible trials. The mean ages of the participants ranged from 51.6 to 54.5 years, and the follow-up durations were all 12 weeks. The Jadad scores were five in three of four RCTs [10] [11] [12] and four in the left one RCT [8] . The loss to follow-up was <10% in all RCTs. Thus, the methodological quality of the retrieved studies was generally high.
