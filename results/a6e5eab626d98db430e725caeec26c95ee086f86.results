A QTL identified in chromosome 5 found in day 12 weight loss We conducted QTL mapping across our panel of 90 F1s (Table 1) , and identified an approximate 2.5 Mb region spanning from 120-122.5 Mb on chromosome 5 (here termed the host response to WNV, region 1, or Hrw1) ( Figure 1A ). HrW1 impacted day 12 weight loss (Figure 2, A and C). The Hrw1 aggregate peak contained 70 genes and microRNAs (excluding predicted genes). The genes under this locus include all the murine Oas genes as well as genes associated with biological pathways including actin cytoskeleton signaling, CD28 signaling in T helper cells, and integrin signaling (Table S1 and Table S2 ). The QTL peak sits over Oas1b. Based on previous mouse studies Mashimo et al. 2002; Ferguson et al. 2008; Kajaste-Rudnitski et al. 2006) , Oas1b is a known driver of disease phenotypes. To determine which of the eight strains in the CC were influencing the loci, we next looked at the founder effects driving this QTL.
