Tobacco smoke exposure was common (table 1) . 242 (25%) mothers smoked during pregnancy and 374 (39%) had passive smoke exposure. Although 198 (20%) mothers had HIV infection, only two children had HIV infection (one case, one control). Although 762 (79%) mothers initiated breastfeeding, only 342 (46%) were exclusively breastfeeding by 6-10 weeks, and 165 (26%) by 6 months (table 1) . Immunisation coverage was high at 6, 10, and 14 weeks and 9 months (table 1) . However, vaccines were delayed by more than 2 weeks in 55 (7%) of 790 children at 6 weeks, 105 (14%) of 745 children at 10 weeks, 165 (23%) of 719 children at 14 weeks, and 88 (16%) of 539 children at 9 months (table 1). 24 infants had congenital pneumonia and were excluded from this present analysis. There were 314 cases of pneumonia, an incidence of 0·27 episodes per child-year (95% CI 0·24-0·31) with similar incidences at each clinic. 30 pneumonia cases were excluded with incomplete specimen collection. The highest incidence was in children aged 1-6 months (0·54 episodes per child-year [95% CI 0·46-0·62]) and in winter (0·51 episodes per child-year [0·43-0·61]; appendix p 1). Male sex, low socioeconomic status, HIV exposure, lack of breastfeeding, more than two household smokers, lower birthweight, and delayed vaccinations were associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (table 1) . In multivariate analysis, only male sex, birthweight, and socioeconomic status were signifi cantly associated with pneumonia (data not shown). Most cases (205 [72%] of 284) of pneumonia were fi rst episodes and 79 cases (28%) were repeat episodes, of which most (51 [65%]) were second events. 60 (21%) pneumonia cases were severe (incidence 0·05 episodes per child-year [95% CI 0·04-0·07; appendix p 2). Almost a third of children (92 [32%]) were admitted to hospital, and 45 children (16%) received oxygen therapy (appendix p 2). Median age of children with pneumonia was 5 months (IQR 3-9), whereas the median age of children with severe pneumonia was 2 months (1-4; p=0·001; appendix p 2). Most cases (237 [84%]) received antibiotics (87 [95%] children admitted to hospital and 150 [78%] in ambulatory care). Chest radiographs, available for 80 (87%) of 92 children with pneumonia who were admitted to hospital, had radiological changes of pneumonia in 60 (75%). Median duration of hospital stay was 3 days (IQR 2-5; appendix p 2). Of the children admitted to hospital, there were three deaths due to pneumonia, a case fatality rate of 1%. Two control children died-one from liver failure and one from sudden infant death syndrome. Blood cultures were available from 90 (98%) of 92 children with pneumonia admitted to hospital; cultures were only positive and grew S pneumoniae from an infant aged 1 month who had not received PCV13. A total of 284 pneumonia cases and 418 age-matched and site-matched controls (selected from the 719 intensive cohort who had nasopharyngeal swabs taken every 2 weeks) were included in case-control analysis from nasopharyngeal swabs. A median of fi ve organisms (IQR 4-6) were reported in cases and controls. An organism was detected in about 97% of swabs from cases or controls; both viruses and bacteria were detected in ; table 2 ). The associations were strongest when comparisons were restricted to asymptomatic controls, compared with those with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms (appendix p 5). C pneumoniae was not detected. These organism-specifi c associations persisted when cases were stratifi ed by disease severity; however, RSV was more strongly associated with severe pneumonia (OR 25·30, 95% CI 3·30-191·61) than with pneumonia (appendix pp 6-7). In severe pneumonia, quantitative load of S aureus and of M catarrhalis was signifi cantly lower in cases than controls, but no other signifi cant diff erences were reported (appendix p 7). Of viral organisms, signifi cant diff erences were noted in the age of cases, seasonal distribution, and clinical features (table 3) . RSV or infl uenza were detected in younger children than in those with parainfl uenza, adenovirus, or bocavirus (table 3) . Age-specifi c incidence of RSV was highest for ages 1-6 months (0·15 episodes per child-year [95% CI 0·11-0·20]); incidence in those aged younger than 1 month was 0·04 episodes per child-year (0·01-0·11), 0·05 episodes per child-year (0·03-0·09) in infants aged 6-12 months, and 0·03 episodes per child-year (0·01-0·06) in those aged 12-18 months. RSV, infl uenza virus, and bocavirus were more common in winter, whereas adenovirus and parainfl uenza virus occurred predominantly in spring (table 3) . RSV was associated with a higher prevalence of wheezing, greater prevalence of lower chest wall indrawing, and a higher median respiratory rate compared with other viruses (table 3) . Despite several organisms being present in both cases and controls, patterns of co-prevalence (of any two organisms) were similar. No signifi cant diff erences were noted between cases and controls in co-prevalence of any two organisms (appendix pp 8-10). In 251 (88%) cases, a matched nasopharyngeal swab and induced sputum sample were obtained; a median of six organisms (IQR 4-7) were detected on induced sputum compared with fi ve (4-7) on nasopharyngeal swabs (p=0·48). There was an increased yield from testing induced sputum for several organisms and all viruses, most notably for B pertussis (
