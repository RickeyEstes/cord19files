C6/36 mosquito cells possess typical round shape with the nucleus remaining on one side of the cell throughout 3 days of observation ( Fig. 1a) . At higher magnifications, it is easy to recognize numerous mitochondria, vacuoles ( Fig. 1a and b) , and the ER (Fig. 1c) in the cytoplasm. By EM, the control culture did not appear contaminated with other mosquito viruses. Twenty-four hours after infection, the shape of the cells did not differ from that of control cells and EM observations did not reveal intact virions outside the cells. Viral nucleocapsid-like particles appeared accumulated in cell vacuoles (Fig. 2a) as well as in the ER which showed swollen cisternae (sc) (Fig. 2b) in comparison with the ER in normal cells (Fig. 1c) . Individual nucleocapsid-like particles appeared round-shaped, homogenous in size and with an electron-dense interior containing the viral genetic material. The average diameter of the viral nucleocapsid-like particles was 50 nm. Vesicular structures containing electron-dense material were also detected in the cytoplasm and identified as putative viral nucleocapsid inclusions. These vesicles possessed doublemembranes ( Fig. 2c and d) . After 48 h of infection, the mosquito cells had changed more dramatically. By EM observation, the cytopathic effect appeared clearly as cell swelling and cell aggregation (data not shown). Abundant NDiV nucleocapsid-like particles appeared as clusters or free in the cytoplasm; no viral nucleocapsid-like particle was identified in mitochondria ( Fig. 3 ) or in the nucleus (data not shown). In many cells, 48 h post-infection, the numerous aggregates of viral nucleocapsid-like particles appeared to migrate to the cell surface ( Fig. 3 ). At this time point, budding particles were detectable in some cells as protrusions from the plasma membrane; viral nucleocapsid-like particles appeared close to the plasma membrane where putative proteins of the viral envelope had associated (Fig. 4) . In the mature period (48 h after infection; budding process), the NDiV clearly appeared at the level of plasma membrane protrusions: the viral envelope consisted in a trilaminar membrane including the host membrane. At this final stage (just before cell lysis), the virus particles appeared ready to bud ( Fig. 4b and c) as complete virions (black arrowheads) or as incomplete virions (white arrowheads). The viral nucleocapside-like particles detected in the cytoplasm (white arrows) and accumulated in the ER vesicles (Ves) of 48 h NDiV-infected C6/36 cells, appear immunoglod-labeled on ultrathin sections with anti-NDiV polyclonal antibodies, as shown in Fig. 5 . No viral nucleocapsid-like particle was found in mitochondria (Mi). We have been successful in visualizing the virus particles in concentrated fluids by negative staining and immunogold EM. The virions appeared round-shaped with complete (black arrowheads) and incomplete (white arrowheads) virus particles. The diameter of the virus particles was about 60 nm for the incomplete particles and about 80 nm for the complete particles ( Fig. 6a ). We have measured the size of the smallest and biggest particles of more than 25 particles each per picture, with three pictures. The envelope layer measured 12 nm in width and appeared rather smooth. Higher magnifications of virion images revealed short spikes of NDiV, measuring 3-4 nm in length (framed image in Fig. 6a ). Immunogold labeling of non-fixed isolated virions using the polyclonal antibodies indicated a specific antigenic reaction against the viral envelope (Fig. 6b ).
