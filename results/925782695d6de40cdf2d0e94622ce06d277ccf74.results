During late autumn 2015, an outbreak of enteric disease occurred in three-day old suckling piglets on a farm located in Buryat Republic, Russia. Approximately 60% of litters had watery diarrhea (lasting 3-5 days), and the mortality rate was approximately 8%. The surviving piglets had reduced weight gain and a delay of being sent to market. Fecal and intestinal samples from infected piglets were submitted to the Diagnostic and Prevention Research Institute for Human and Animal Diseases to identify the cause of the disease. The samples tested negative for TGEV (Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus), RVA, ASFV (African Swine Fever Virus), PCV-2 (Porcine Circovirus Type 2), CSFV (Classical Swine Fever Virus), and PRCV (Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus) using ELISA and PCR commercial kits from Vetbiochim (Moscow, Russia). Fecal samples were passaged on Vero, ST, and PK-15. Cell culture was halted after six blind passages since the cytopathic effect (CPE) was not observed. The fecal and intestinal samples were negative for bacterial pathogens on blood agar plates. Since a pathogen was not identified as the causative agent of disease, the purified RNA from the intestinal samples were submitted for Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). De novo assembly of the reads generated two contigs, which upon BLAST (NCBI) analysis yielded 83% and 86% nucleotide identities to the VP3 and VP4 genes of porcine RVB strain LS00011_Ohio, respectively. No other pathogens were detected in the NGS data. A piglet was infected with the filtered fecal material and commingled with a mock-inoculated piglet to investigate the etiology and transmission associated with porcine RVB strain Buryat15. The fecal infected piglet developed diarrhea within 12 h while the mock-inoculated piglet developed diarrhea 24 h post-inoculation (PI) due to being commingled with the infected piglet. The small and large intestinal homogenates from the two pigs tested negative by the previously described commercial ELISA and PCR kits from Vetbiochim. Passage of the small and large intestinal homogenates in the Vero, ST, and PK-15 cells lacked CPE after six passages. Testing of the intestinal homogenates by NGS identified the addition of nine gene segments of RVB strain Buryat15. NGS did not identify any other pathogens in the intestinal homogenates. The VP7 gene shared close common ancestors with Japanese strains while the NSP2 gene was most closely related to a porcine strain from India. The VP6 gene branched with Japanese strain PB-107-G16, but both fell within a larger clade of United States strains. The NSP5 gene was most closely related to the cogent gene of a porcine strain from Vietnam. The VP1 gene shared a clade with swine RVB strains from Vietnam and United States. The NSP3 gene shared a large clade with swine RVB strains from the United States. The tissue culture adapted strain USA/LS00011_Ohio was closely related to the Buryat15 VP3 gene segment. The VP4, VP2, and NSP4 genes from Buryat15 lacked close neighbors in the phylogenetic trees. To explore the antigenic diversity of Buryat15, the VP7 amino acid identities were compared to previously characterized swine RVB strains of the G12 genotype at predicted antigenic sites [24] ( Table 1 ). Buryat15 has an asparagine at the hypervariable residue 65, which is only shared by RVB strains isolated in Illinois, USA. Strains Buryat15 and Japanese PB-S24-11 have a glutamic acid at residue 91 while all the RVB strains have an alanine residue.
