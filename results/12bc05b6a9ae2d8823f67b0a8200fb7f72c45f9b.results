A total of 191 (5%) of 3693 women had a febrile HRV respiratory illness episode, 96 (50%) of which occurred during pregnancy and 95 (50%) occurred after delivery. The median person-weeks (p-w) of follow up was 51 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 46-56) for febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy and 49 weeks (IQR, 43-55) for those without HRV-associated illness while pregnant. Febrile HRV respiratory illness incidence was 58.3/1000 p-y. The incidence of febrile HRV illness while pregnant was 95 of 1497 p-y, or 64.1/1000 p-y, and incidence after delivery was 95 of 1799 p-y, or 52.8/1000 p-y (P = .51). Characteristics of women with and without febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy and their infants are outlined in Table 1 . The median gestational age at infection among the febrile HRV respiratory illness group was 28 weeks (IQR, 12-39). Incidence of HRV was similar by baseline characteristics, including maternal age, maternal literacy, nulliparity, indoor biomass cookstove use, and number of children in the household. In particular, no difference in maternal body mass index was observed. In addition, no difference was observed in influenza vaccination status between the 2 groups. Other viruses detected in association with febrile respiratory illness episodes included respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, influenza, coronavirus, bocavirus, and adenovirus each occurring at notably lower frequency compared with HRV. Seventy-four of 96 (77.1%) infants born to pregnant women with febrile HRV respiratory illness and 2678 of 3597 (74.5%) infants born to mothers without HRV-associated illness were weighed within 72 hours of birth and therefore included in the assessment of LBW and SGA. Of 2752 infants with birth weight measured in the first 72 hours, 84% (2302) were taken on the day of birth. Median weight in those measured on days 2 and 3 of life was approximately 0.1 kg lower than those measured on day 1 (2.73 at day 2 and 2.69 at day 3 vs 2.80 on day 1), and the proportion determined to be of LBW increased from 24% on day 1 to 27% on day 2 to 36% on day 3. Had all 3 days observed exactly the same rate of LBW designations of 24%, it is expected then that approximately 27 infants (9 weighed on day 2 and 18 weighed on day 3 of life) would not have been determined to have LBW. With 689 infants classified as LBW, however, 27 is only 4% of that group, so this comprises a very low potential misclassification rate. Prevalence of LBW was significantly higher among infants born to pregnant women with febrile HRV respiratory illness compared with those born to mothers with a febrile respiratory illness of another viral etiology during pregnancy, after adjusting for season of birth and gender of the infant, with a 1.6-fold increased risk of LBW ( (Figure 1 ; Table 2 ). When comparing pregnant women with non-HRV febrile viral respiratory illness to those .01) in the group of infants exposed to maternal febrile HRV illness compared with 2.80 kg (2.50-3.08) among infants not exposed to respiratory illness during pregnancy. Three HRV infections occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy, 40 in the second and 53 in the third. The lack of HRV infection in the first trimester is due to enrollment of women into the study beginning at 17 weeks gestation or later rather than lack of rhinovirus infection during the first trimester of pregnancy. Low birth weight prevalence was not affected by the trimester of pregnancy in which the HRV infection occurred (P = .91). Febrile HRV respiratory infection occurred yearround with a peak in October ( Figure 2 ) and accounted for a consistent 5% of respiratory virus infections each month. Low birth weight occurred at a monthly rate of 20%-30% (Supplementary Figure 2) . Due to the nature of enrollment, the number of patients under surveillance and therefore the numbers of samples collected were not constant over time, and this is reflected in the numbers of proportions of births and specimens tested (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 2) . Small-for-gestational age appeared higher among infants born to mothers with febrile HRV respiratory illness versus those with non-HRV febrile respiratory illness, although this did not reach statistical significance (34 of 74 [46.0%] vs 176 (1) Illness and symptom duration subdivided by LBW and pregnancy status are outlined in Table 3 . The median duration of illness was 5 days (range, 1-49) among pregnant and postpartum women. No difference between overall illness duration was observed when comparing women with febrile HRV respiratory infection with and without LBW infants or when comparing women with febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy versus after delivery. Six women died during the period of surveillance, none of whom had febrile HRV respiratory infection. Thirty-seven of 96 (39%) women with febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy sought medical care. Overall, 7 women sought care from a physician or a hospital. Among women with febrile HRV respiratory infection during pregnancy, care-seeking behavior was similar between women who had LBW infants and those who did not (10 of 28 [35. 7%] vs 20 of 46 [43.5%]; P = .51). In this same group with febrile HRV respiratory illness during pregnancy, the proportion seeking the care of a physician or hospital was also similar by LBW status of the infant. Three of 28 (10.7%) who had LBW infants saw a physician, compared with 4 of 46 (43.5%) who did not (P = .77). Of the 3 women with LBW infants who sought care from a physician, 1 woman sought care for severe headache and fever, whereas the reason for seeking care from a physician for the 2 other women was not documented. Of successfully sequenced (Supplementary Figure 1 ). Of these, 27 (65.8%) were from pregnant women, whereas the remainder were from women who had rhinovirus after giving birth. Species A (24 of 27 [89%]) accounted for a majority of the samples sequenced, whereas Species B and C accounted for 2 of 27 (7.4%) and 1 of 27 (3.7%), respectively. Among women who gave birth to LBW infants, 6 of 7 (86%) were Species A and 1 of 7 (14%) were Species B. However, the proportion of samples sequenced compared with the total was small. Eleven (11%) pregnant women with HRV had an additional respiratory virus detected including coronavirus (n = 2), human metapneumovirus (n = 5), adenovirus (n = 1), and bocavirus (n = 2), and respiratory syncytial virus and bocavirus (each, n = 1). Coinfections occurred at equal frequencies among mothers with and without LBW infants (3 of 28 [11%] vs 6 of 46 [13%], respectively; P = .77). The association between LBW and febrile HRV-illness episode remained when infants born to mothers with febrile HRV with viral coinfection illness episodes were excluded from the analysis (RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4; P = .0089). No HRV-associated respiratory illness was found in association with influenza coinfection.
