A total of 80 farms were tested for Cryptosporidium presence. These farms consisted of 67 farms visited, as part of the E. coli case-control study, between November 2009 and March 2010, and 13 farms visited between May and September 2010 specifically for this project. No significant difference was found between the test results or main management structures of the case and control farms. No significant differences were found between the participating farms and those that declined participation in the study with respect to the main farm details, such as herdsize and farm location. An average of 70 samples were tested from each farm (range 38-110), with a total of 5594 tested overall. At least one positive sample was detected on 74 of the 80 farms (92.5%, 95% CI 86.7-98.3%). The planned 55 cattle samples were not collected from all farms: five farms were missing between one and four samples due to a lack of faecal material in animal areas, and a further four farms had fewer youngstock or adult cattle present on the farm than expected so the sampling represented the smaller number of animals. Cryptosporidium prevalence was highest (20.6%) in the 553 samples collected in the spring months (March-May) rather than in the other seasons (8.8%) (odds ratio (OR 2 x ) 2.7, P < 0.001). The preliminary results for the presence of any species of Cryptosporidium from the IFAT microscopy testing showed that a prevalence of 10.2% (95% CI 9.4-11.1%) was detected from cattle samples collected from each farm, with little change between the confidence limits calculated by conventional or adjusted methods (Table 1) . The results also indicate that a relatively high percentage of positive samples (>10%) were detected from rats, mice and bird samples, collected from the cattle enclosures (Table 1) . Dirty water samples and manure samples were found to have prevalences similar to that detected from the cattle, but the number of positive test results from samples collected from grazing fields where slurry had been spread in the preceding 30 days, was found to be low. A low prevalence (4.1%) was detected from the 121 sheep samples and no positive samples were detected from deer and fox samples, although only 2 samples were collected of each. Cryptosporidium prevalence appeared to be related to the age of cattle present in the group. As the samples were collected from groups of animals, the exact age of the animals was unknown. However, the highest prevalence (45.1%) was detected in groups where the oldest age category was less than one month ( Table 2) . The semi-quantitative test results for mice and rats had a greater percentage of samples with high Cryptosporidium concentrations than other sample types (Table 3) . Mice had 7.7% of samples with an estimated 3+ concentration and rats had 5.3% at that concentration and 5.3% at 5+, in comparison with an average from all samples of 0.5% at 3+ and 0.8% at 5+. However, there was no statistical evidence that rodents had a higher probability of a result above 2+ (OR 2 x 3.3 P = 0.11). The semi-quantitative results broken down by the age categories in the cattle groups indicated only calf groups (aged 0-6 months) had concentrations of 4+ and 5+ (Table 4 ). Calf groups containing only calves under 1 month of age, were significantly more likely (P < 0.001) to have concentrations of 5+ (6.6%) than those that contained calves up to 3 or 6 months of age (1.8% and 0.2%, respectively).
