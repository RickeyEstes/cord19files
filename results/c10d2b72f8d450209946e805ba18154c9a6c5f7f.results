Pharmacokinetics study of GC376 in cats GC376 (Fig 1) is a representative compound of the dipeptidyl transition state 3CLpro inhibitors [28] [29] [30] 32 ] whose synthesis was described previously [28] . NPI64 shares homologous structural elements with GC376, except that NPI64 has an additional residue of 1-naththylalanine compared to GC376 in a position that corresponds to the P3 position [30] , using the nomenclature of Schechter and Berger [33] (Fig 1) . The comparable antiviral activity of GC376 and NPI64 against the replication of feline coronavirus in a cell culture system was previously reported (Fig 1) [28, 30] . However, their PK properties have not been reported. In this study, we investigated the drug plasma concentration changes in healthy specific pathogen free (SPF) [28, 30] and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) values of GC376 or NPI64 determined in various cell lines were previously reported [28, 30] and summarized in a table. cats of 6-9 month age (n = 2 for each compound) following single subcutaneous (s.c.) dose of 10 mg/kg GC376 or 5 mg/kg NPI64. Serial blood samples were then collected and the plasma drug concentrations were measured. Previously, we reported that GC376 is converted into an aldehyde form by the removal of the bisulfite group, and the aldehyde form forms a reversible covalent bond with the nucleophilic cysteine residue of 3CLpro in the x-ray crystallography studies [28] . We also observed the conversion of NPI64 into its aldehyde form in the blood. Therefore the aldehyde forms of GC376 or NPI64 were measured in the plasma samples. Fig 2A shows the plasma drug concentrations over time following single-dose administration of GC376 (red triangles) or NPI64 (black circles). The PK study results indicate that GC376 is rapidly absorbed after s.c. administration and the peak plasma level was reached within 2 hr after injection. The mean plasma drug concentrations remained above the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) value of the aldehyde form of GC376 (8 ng/ml) for 18 hrs post injection (Fig 2A, red triangles) . The plasma drug concentrations following injection of 5 mg/kg NPI64 stayed above the EC 50 value of the aldehyde form of NPI64 (12 ng/ml) for 12 hrs post injection (Fig 2A, black circles) . The maximum detected plasma drug concentration following NPI64 administration was substantially lower than that of GC376 by 9.5-fold. This result indicate that GC376 was more easily absorbed than NPI64 via the tested route, even when the lower dose of NPI64 (5 mg/kg), compared to GC376 (10 mg/kg), was taken into account.
