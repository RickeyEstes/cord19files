100 questionnaires were distributed to eligible staff members -80 to registered nursing staff and 20 to medical staff. The response rate from nursing staff was 28 questionnaires (35%) and from medical staff 4 questionnaires (20%). Four focus group sessions were held over a 2week period with 4 staff members attending each session. In the fourth session, data saturation began appearing (where no new themes were being discussed) therefore the total sample size of 16 for the focus group sessions was deemed adequate. Fig. 1 details the flow of respondents. Tables 2 and 3 describe the respondents by specialty and by years of ICU experience. Eight common themes emerged from the thematic analysis of both the questionnaires and focus groups and are described below along with selected samples of the respondents' supporting statements. The collection of the eight themes articulates the lived experience of the staff during the height of the H1N1Influenza pandemic period.
