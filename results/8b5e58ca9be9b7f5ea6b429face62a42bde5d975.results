A total of 12,803 patients in whom either one of the MRP assays (Luminex RVP or Biofire RP) was obtained during the study time period were initially identified. We excluded 5129 (40.1%) patients who tested negative for any pathogens since the focus of the current study was to describe the impact of rapid detection of respiratory pathogens in management of hospitalized patients. We further excluded 349 (2.7%) who were admitted to either the NICU or hematology/oncology ward, 456 (3.6%) who did not have the RVP/RP ordered within the first 48 h of admission, 708 (5.5%) who had a LOS > 7 days, 1007 (7.9%) who were seen in the ED but were not admitted to the hospital, and 12 (.09%) who were ≥18 years old at the time of the admission. Our final study group included 5142 patients A total of 1264 (24.6%) patients were tested with the RVP assay (Table 1) . Those patients who were ≥2 years old represented the largest age group in our analysis (n = 2246; 43.7%). Nearly half of our patients tested positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus only whereas 110 (2.1%) patients were positive for ≥1 bacterial organisms. The frequency distribution of respiratory pathogens between the two RP/RVP time periods were comparable (Fig. 2)
