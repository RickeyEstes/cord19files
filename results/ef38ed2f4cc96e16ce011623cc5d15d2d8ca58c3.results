Generation of a BAC containing full-length cDNA corresponding to the modified live vaccine "C-strain Riems" BACs containing the full-length cDNA corresponding to the parental vRiemser ("C-strain Riems") were constructed according to the method described previously for the "Paderborn" strain of CSFV [11] . BACs containing the complete CSFV cDNAs were identified by restriction Figure 1 Schematic representation of the CSFV genome organization and the BACs constructed and used in this study. Nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) positions within R26 for the 5′ and 3′ termini together with the translational start and stop codons of the polyprotein coding region plus cleavage sites used to make the individual proteins (N pro , C, E rns , E1, E2, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B) are indicated. Insertion of the rpsL-neo in place of the TAV-epitope within CSFV E2 for the intermediate construct (R26_rpsLneo) and the subsequent replacement with the TTVSTSTLA sequence (R26_TAV) and the complete substitution of the E2 sequence (R26_E2gif) are shown. Names of BAC constructs begin with "pBelo" and rescued viruses with "v" (e.g. pBeloR26 and vR26). Cell culture passage no. of virus is indicated with "/P" (e.g. vR26/P-4). digest analysis and following linearization by NotI, RNA transcripts were produced and electroporated into PK15 cells. This screening resulted in the identification of a BAC containing a cDNA insert of 12316 nt, pBeloR26 (Figure 1) , which yielded infectious virus, termed vR26, that could be propagated in SFT-R cells (Figure 2 , upper panels) and in PK15 cells (Figure 3 ). The rescued vR26 displayed higher growth rate at the early stage (about 10fold difference in virus yield at 24 h) compared to the parental vaccine virus, but after 48 hours similar virus titres were obtained (Figure 3 ). Full-genome sequencing of the cloned BAC template, pBeloR26, revealed a number of differences throughout the genome when compared to the full-length consensus sequence of the cDNA used for the cloning procedure (see Table 1 ). These differences are non-representative variants within the cDNA. Overall, the BAC sequence differed from the cDNA sequence in 18 positions, 9 of these lead to predicted amino acid substitutions within the polyprotein; one in each of N pro , E rns , E1, E2 and NS3 and four amino acid substitutions in NS5B (Table 1) . When compared to the published reference sequence (GenBank accession AY259122.1), the pBeloR26 BAC sequence differed at an additional 11 positions, 1 of these lead to a predicted amino acid substitution and there was one large insertion (27 nt) in the hypervariable region of the 3′-UTR (Additional file 2: Table S2 ).
