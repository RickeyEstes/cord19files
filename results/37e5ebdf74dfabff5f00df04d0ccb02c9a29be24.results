The overall mean ferrocene concentrations in each exposure chamber (2.5, 5, 10,20, and 40 mg vapor/m3) during the 2-week, repeated study were within + 10% of the target concentrations (Table 1 ). The relative standard deviation of the daily means was within 45%. The homogeneity (i.e., the variation among six position samples within each chamber) of the ferrocene vapor concentrations ranged from 5.7 to 17.6% among all exposure chambers. liver. Group mean liver weights for male and female rats are given in Table 4 . Male rats exposed to the highest concentration of ferrocene vapor had a statistically significant, although small, decrease in liver weights, compared to control animals. Statistically significant decreases in liver weight were not seen in female rats at any exposure concentration. Postexposure, group mean organ weights for male and female mice are given in Table 5 . Male mice had a statistically significant decrease in liver and spleen weights after exposures to the two highest concentrations of ferrocene vapor, and a statistically significant increase in thymus weight after exposure to the highest concentration of ferrocene, when compared to control animals. Female mice had exposurerelated decreases in brain, liver, spleen, and right kidney weights, relative to control female mice. The measured weights for other organs were not affected by ferrocene exposure (data not shown). No rats or mice died during the study, nor were any clinical signs of toxicity found during either the daily or the detailed observation times. Group mean body weights at the end of the study (Day 17) and mean weight gain over the exposure period are given in Tables  2 and 3 for rats and mice, respectively. Relative to control mice, male rats exposed to the highest concentration of ferrocene (40 mg/m3) had statistically significant decreases in terminal body weight and rate of weight gain during the exposures. No significant body-weight differences were seen among the groups of exposed and control female rats at the end of the study. Male mice exposed to the two highest concentrations of ferrocene (20 and 40 mg/m3) had significant decreases in terminal body weight and/or in the rate of weight gain, while female mice had decreases in terminal body weight and rate of weight gain at the three highest exposure levels (10, 20, and 40 mg/m3). No exposure-related gross lesions were found at necropsy in either rats or mice from any exposure group. Because of the absence of any gross lesions in other organs, only lung, nasal turbinates, liver, and spleen from each animal were examined microscopically. The only exposurerelated histologic findings for either rats or mice were in the nasal olfactory epithelium. Neither species had lesions in the squamous FIG. I.

Note the marked attenuation, ne epithelium from the ferrocene-exposed animal (B). ferrocene vapor epithelium present at the entry to the nasal cavity. The respiratory epithelium was minimally affected; occasional necrosis of individual cells and occasional cells containing a granular, light-brown pigment within the cytoplasm were observed in this epithelium. These alterations were primarily centered in the nasal septum. The transitional epithelium that extends between the squamous and respiratory epithelial regions exhibited minimal necrosis and epithelial hyperplasia. Brown, cytoplasmic pigment, as described above, was also present within individual cells of this region. The severity of the lesions in the nonolfactory epithelium was exposure concentration-related, and both sexes and species were equally affected. However, the lesions were ium from control (A) and high level, ferrocene-exposed :crosis and accompanying inflammation of the nasal Similar nasal lesions were found in rats exposed to minimal in degree, even in the group exposed to the highest concentration of ferrocene (40 mg/m3). The primary histopathological lesion for both rats and mice for both sexes and at all exposure levels was located in the olfactory epithelium (Fig. 1) and was most severe in the dorsal meatus. This lesion was classified as subacute, necrotizing inflammation and encompassed the features described below. The olfactory epithelium was characterized by patchy areas of degeneration and by necrosis of neuroepithelial and sustentacular cells. Many areas were markedly atrophic. Inflammatory cells, predominantly neutrophils, were present; however, they were not a prominent component of the reaction. The relative pau-city of inflammatory cells that we observed is a common finding in lesions of the olfactory epithelium. The majority of the remaining epithelium was characterized by the presence of mitotic figures, rosette formation, and loss of basement membrane orientation of epithelial cells, all of which are indicative of marked regenerative attempts by the olfactory epithelium. Many epithelial cells contained cytoplasmic, light-brown, granular pigment. Bowman's glands were also characterized by patchy necrosis and atrophy. Lesions were graded based on severity and distribution on a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 being minimal and 5 being severe. None of the animals had lesions that were considered to be more than moderate (grade 3) in degree. "Minimal" lesions were those having rare individual cell necrosis and degeneration with subtle atrophy of the olfactory epithelium. "Mild" lesions were characterized by patchy areas of degeneration and necrosis that involved less than 10% of the epithelium. "Moderate" lesions were more extensive, involving up to approximately 25% of the epithelium; an inflammatory response was more prominent in lesions of this severity. The severity of the lesion in the olfactory epithelium was directly related to exposure dose. Lesions were most severe in the groups exposed to the highest ferrocene concentration (40 mg/m3) and were scored as moderate in degree. Lesions of a similar magnitude were also observed in the groups exposed to 20 mg/ m3 ferrocene. Lesions, minimal to mild in degree, were seen in the groups exposed to 5 and 10 mg/m3 ferrocene. Lesions, minimal in degree, were seen in the group exposed to the lowest concentration of ferrocene, 2.5 mg/m3. We did not observe sex-related differences, and the severity of the lesion occurring after exposure to a given ferrocene concentration was about the same in rats and mice. No exposurerelated microscopic lesions were found in either livers or spleens. The in vitro studies of ferrocene metabolism showed that microsomes from the ethmoturbinates metabolized ferrocene more rapidly a Values for V,,, and Km and estimated 95% confidence intervals were taken from a plot of rate and concentrations of ferrocene derived by using 10 data points representing a range of ferrocene concentrations of 2 to 300 FM. Protein concentration was 0.5-I mg microsomal protein, which was then normalized to a per gram tissue basis. than did those from the maxilloturbinates. Also, microsomes from both nasal tissues had up to 10 times higher activities towards the ferrocene than did the liver microsomes (Table 6).
