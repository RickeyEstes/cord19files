The decomposition results for the factors influencing transportation carbon emissions in the above formulas are shown in Table 2 and in Fig. 1. (i) Economic growth, energy intensity, population size and output value of per unit traffic turnover play positive roles in increasing transportation carbon emissions, with cumulative contributions of 334.5%, 196.7%, 165.4% and 158.2%, respectively. Among them, economic growth contributes the most in increasing transportation carbon emissions, Energy intensity, population size and output value of per unit traffic turnover generally display positive effects on transportation carbon emissions, but the effects are weaker than that of economic growth. (ii) The effect of energy intensity on transportation carbon emissions shows a fluctuating trend over time, alternating performance of inhibition and promotion. During 1998 During -1999 During , 2000 During -2004 During , 2005 During -2008 Note: D X1 , D X2 , D X3 , D X4 , D X5 , D X6 and V represent energy structure effect, energy intensity effect, output value of per unit traffic turnover effect, transportation intensity effect, economic growth effect, population size effect. 1995-2003, 2005-2009, and 2011-2012 . The effect of energy structure on transportation carbon emissions is similar to energy intensity with inhibition and promotion effects appearing alternatively. Although its contribution is small, energy structure cumulatively plays an inhibiting role in transportation carbon emissions.
