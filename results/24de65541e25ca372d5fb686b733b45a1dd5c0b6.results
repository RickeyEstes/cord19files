The three largest mean frequencies of incubation periods among the patients examined were 2, 3, and 6 days ( Figure 1 ). Incubation periods of 1, 4, 5, and 10 days were the second highest mean frequencies ( Figure 1 ). However, the confidence intervals (5th and 95th percentiles) for most of the potential incubation periods clearly overlapped ( Figure 1 ). This finding indicates that with the given data set, an incubation period of 10 days is almost as likely to occur as an incubation period of 6 days. Using the mean frequency of each incubation period, I constructed a cumulative frequency graph (Figure 2 ). The 95th percentile is 12 days, with a median (50th percentile) of approximately 4 days.
