In embedded sections, the area of neuronal loss that was to be trimmed out for our study was conspicuous because of its colorless aspect related to a decreased osmication. When compared to adjacent Nissl-stained sections, this area comprised a large part of the ventrobasal thalamus but never extended to the large fiber tracts around it, the internal capsule and medial lemniscus, that were as well stained as on the opposite unlesioned side. Preservation of the osmication of these white matter areas was observed even when the kainate lesion had extended in the gray matter on both sides of the tracts, i.e. to the striatum and to the zona incerta, respectively. At the ultrastructural level, the identification of the axons was easily made when axons were surrounded by layers of myelin. In other cases, for unmyelinated or totally demyelinated axons, we relied upon the commonly accepted criteria. 46 Axons, in the CNS neuropile, are characterized as profiles having smooth contours and a cylindrical shape, display a clear cytoplasm that contains neurofilaments, arrays of microtubules and a few mitochondria and that, mostly, contains no ribosomes. Analysis of the neuropile between two days and 18 months after kainate injection aliowed us to characterize four different periods according to specific features of axonoglial injections: (i) a few days during which Wallerian degeneration predominated; (ii) the second week, characterized by profuse demyelination of axons; (iii) the third week in which the neuropile was devoid of myelinated axons; and (iv) subsequent periods in which large axons were remyelinated.
