HBoV1 DNA, a high DNA load, mRNA, or antigen were detected in 96 (15.2%), 19 (3%), 17 (2.7%), and 13 (2.1%) of the 632 NPA samples, respectively ( Table 1) . Out of the 96 samples positive for DNA, only 19.8% had a high DNA load, 17.7% were positive for mRNA, and 13.5% for antigen. Of the samples with a high DNA load, 89.5% were positive for mRNA and 68.4% for antigen, whereas none of the low DNA-load samples harbored mRNA or antigen. Positive HBoV1 antigen test results were available in 20 min for nine of the 13 samples, and the four remaining results were available in two hours. Presence of HBoV1 antigen correlated well with both mRNA and high DNA load. The phi coefficient for the correlation between mRNA and antigen was 0.87, whereas it was 0.94 for mRNA and high DNA load. Specificity and PPV of the HBoV1 antigen test were excellent, while the sensitivity was lower. With mRNA RT-PCR as reference, specificity, sensitivity, and PPV were 100%, 76.5%, and 100%, respectively. With high DNA load by qPCR as reference, the figures were 100%, 68.4%, and 100% (Table 2) .
