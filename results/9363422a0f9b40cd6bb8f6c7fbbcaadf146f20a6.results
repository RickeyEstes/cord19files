Suwival. Mice infected with 1,000 PFU ofMHV-3 (n = 16) all succumbed to the infection within 5 d (Fig. 1) . This was consistent with previous data reported by our group as well as others (1, 2) . In contrast, there was survival in some animals that were treated with ascites containing antibody to PCA (Fig. 1 ). Animals treated with ascites containing 25 /~g/d had a 22% survival; 44% of those treated with ascites containing 50 #g/d and 100% of animals treated with 100 /~g/d survived. All animals survived when treated with 100 /~g of monodonal anti-PCA (IgG2ak), which had been purified from hybridoma superuatant, confirming that the beneficial effect of ascites was due to the monoclonal anti-PCA. Mice immunized with 100/~1 of ascites from SP2injected animals and infected with MHV-3 all died within 5 d (data not shown). Liver Histology. MHV-3-infected mice that did not receive antibody developed histologic evidence of severe liver disease. By 24 h p.i., small, discrete loci of necrosis with a sparse PMN infiltrate could be seen. At 48 h, these lesions became both more pronounced and more numerous (Fig. 2 A) , and by 72-96 h, confluent liver necrosis was apparent (Fig. 2 B) . In contrast, mice infected with MHV-3 but treated with antibody to PCA showed a marked reduction in liver disease in all groups (25, 50 , and 100/.r ( were a few small loci of inflammatory cells with no necrosis (Fig. 2 D) . Morphometric image analysis showed that the proportion of the liver that was necrotic was significantly different between the MHV-3-infected, anti-PCA-treated, and untreated groups at 48, 72 and 96 h (Fig. 3) . The histolog 7 of livers from all survivors at 10 and 14 d postinfection appeared normal. Fibrin deposits were seen in hepatic sinusoids as well as in areas of necrosis of untreated and MHV-3-infected mice (Fig. 4) . In animals treated with 25 and 50/~g of anti-PCA, a marked reduction in fibrin was noted. No fibrin was seen in the livers of infected mice treated with 100/~g of mAb. Treatment with anti-PCA alone resulted in no detectable histological evidence of liver disease in nonirLf~ed animals. Viral Titers. By 24 h p.i., large amounts of infectious virus were recovered from liver homogenates of MHV-3-infected and untreated animals, and these persisted until the death of the animals (Fig. 5) . In animals treated with 25 and 50/~g of antibody to PCA, there was no significant difference in viral titers from those observed in untreated mice at days 1 and 3. Viral titers remained high at day 5, however, viral titers decreased by day 7 and no virus could be detected after day 10. In animals treated with the highest dose of antibody to PCA (100 #g/d), viral titers were markedly reduced (p <0.05) and approached those seen in resistant A/J mice (3, 5) . Using the method of Reed and Meunch, the MHV-3 recovered from infected and antibody-treated animals was as pathogenic as stock MHV-3 or virus recovered from infected and untreated mice (data not shown) (17) . PCA. In untreated, but MHV-3-infected animals, a sharp increase in splenic macrophage PCA was noted at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 6) . Maximal PCA was seen at 48 h and PCA remained elevated until the animals' death on day 4. Animals treated with low concentrations of antibody to PCA (25 and 50/zg/d) expressed high amounts of PCA at early time points, but by day 7, PCA levels fell and only basal levels of PCA were detected in SMNC by day 10. In contrast, no expression of PCA could be detected in animals treated with 100/zg of antibody to PCA during the course of infection (Fig. 6 ). Immunofluorescence. By direct immunofluorescence staining, PCA could be detected at 24 h in livers from MHV-3- infected and untreated mice. PCA was seen in areas of inflammation and necrosis, and also in hepatic sinusoids, localized primarily in endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, but not expressed by hepatocytes (Fig. 7) . Livers from animals treated with antibody to PCA had significantly less PCA expression, although small amounts of PCA could be seen in macrophages and endothelial cells in hepatic sinusoids in animals treated with high-dose antibody to PCA (100 ~tg/d), even as late as day 14 (Fig. 7) . Antibody to PCA. Sera were collected from animals at all time points and analyzed in an ELISA for the presence of antibody to PCA as previously described (8) . No antibody to PCA could be detected in sera from normal control animals or in animals infected with MHV-3 who had not received antibody to PCA (data not shown). Sera from animals treated with ascites containing 25-100/zg of antibody to PCA contained large amounts of anti-PCA before MHV-3 infection. After MHV-3 infection, the concentration of circulating antibody fell, but remained at >100 ng/ml in animals treated with 100/~g/d. In animals that were treated with 25 and 50/zg of antibody, by day 7, antibody was undetectable (<1 ng/ml) (Fig. 8) . Antibody to PCA either in ascites or purified from supernatants did not neutralize MHV-3 in a standard plaque reduction assay as previously described (8) To determine whether treated animals that had survived the acute infection developed long-term resistance to MHV-3 infection, mice previously infected with MHV-3 and treated with 100/~g of antibody (n = 15) were infected with 1,000 PFU of MHV-3, 21 d after their last exposure to virus. PCA antibody titers in this group were ~5 0 % of that present during antibody therapy, consistent with known rates of disappearance of IgG. The MHV-rechallenged mice experienced a 50% mortality rate, suggesting that protection was by passive immunization of antibody, not an acquired, active immune process (Fig. 9 ). In addition, no antibody to MHV-3 was detected in these mice either before or after rechallenge with virus.
