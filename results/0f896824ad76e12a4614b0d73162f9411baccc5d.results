Complementation in replication between p27-deficient and p88-deficient RNA1 mutants DNA vector plasmids used in this study are presented in Fig. 1 . Cowpea protoplasts were inoculated with pUBRC1-p27, pUBRC1-p88u, or their mixture. pUBRC1-p27 expresses RNA1 mutant that expresses p27 but not p88, and pUBRC1-p88u expresses RNA1 mutant that expresses p88 but not p27. Virus RNA accumulation was analyzed after 24 h of incubation by Northern blotting using Dig-labeled RNA probe specific to RCNMV RNA1. RNA1 accumulated in inoculation with a mixture of pUBRC1-p27 and pUBRC1-p88u ( Fig. 2A , lane 3), whereas no signal specific to RNA1 was detected in inoculation with either pUBRC1-p27 or pUBRC1-p88u alone ( Fig. 2A , Fig. 1 . Schematic representation of wild-type RCNMV RNA 1 and 2 (pUBRC1 and pUBRC2, respectively) and mutants derived from RNA 1 (referred to as the names of plasmids). These viral RNAs had extra G residue at the 5′ end. The viral RNA was initially synthesized in vivo from the 35S promoter of CaMV, and was cleaved by the ribozyme of satellite Tobacco ringspot virus to generate the appropriate 3′ end. Individual sites of the introduced mutations were explained and indicated by open triangles. lanes 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained by using pUBRC1-p88 whose transcripts were used in a previous study (Takeda et al., 2005) . Both pUBRC1-p88u and pUBRC1-p88 were expected to express wild-type p88 alone, but differed in silent mutations to eliminate a translational termination codon for p27 (Fig. 1) . These results suggested that RNA1 mutants expressing p27 or p88 alone, respectively, complemented each other for RNA replication. Replication of p27-deficient or p88-deficient RNA1 mutants by supplying lacking replicase components in trans We next tested whether p27-deficient and p88-deficient RNA1s could be replicated by supplying lacking replicase components from protein expression plasmids. Cowpea protoplasts were inoculated with various combinations of p27, p88, RNA1, and RNA2-expressing plasmids, and viral RNA accumulations were analyzed. RNA1 accumulated efficiently in protoplasts inoculated with a mixture of pUBRC1-p88u and pUBp27 (Fig. 2B , lane 2), although the accumulation level decreased in the presence of RNA2 (Fig. 2B, lane 4) . On the other hand, the accumulations of RNA1 were extremely low or below detection limits in protoplasts inoculated with a mixture of pUBRC1-p27 and pUBp88 (Fig. 2B , lane 1, data not shown), and the accumulation level of RNA1 was consistently below detection limits in the presence of RNA2 (Fig. 2B, lane 3) . Either combination of pUBRC1-p88u and pUBp27 or pUBRC1-p27 and pUBp88 supported the accumulation of co-inoculated RNA2 efficiently (Fig. 2B , lanes 3 and 4), indicating that p27 and p88 from these plasmids were sufficient to replicate RNA2. Thus, these results suggested that p88 mainly functioned in a cispreferential manner in RNA1 replication, whereas p27 effectively functioned in trans to support the replication of RNA1. If this idea is true, RNA1 signals detected in the coinoculation experiments of pUBRC1-p27 with pUBRC1-p88u or pUBRC1-p88 should reflect the preferential accumulation of p88-encoding RNA1. To confirm this expectation, we used pUBRC1-p27-dCP and pUBRC1-p88u-dCP ( Fig. 1 ), because these CP-deletion mutants allow one to distinguish RNA1 mutants by size. In inoculations with a mixture of pUBRC1-p27-dCP and pUBRC1-p88u or a mixture of pUBRC1-p27 and pUCRC1-p88u-dCP, RNA1 with a size expected from pUBRC1-p88u or pUBRC1-p88u-dCP preferentially accumulated ( Fig. 2C , lanes 1 and 2). In addition, in vitro transcripts of RNA1 mutants expressing p88 alone corresponding to pUBRC1-p88u, pUBRC1-p88, pUBRC1-p88u-dCP, or pUBRC1-p88-dCP were efficiently replicated by coinoculation with p27-expressing plasmids (data not shown). cis-Acting RNA elements are not involved in the failure of rescue of replication of RNA1 mutants by p88 supplied in trans The above results do not rule out the possibility that failure in the accumulation of p88-deficient RNA1 mutants by p88 supplied in trans might result from the disruption of cis-acting replication elements by the nucleotides inserted into or substituted in those RNA1 mutants. pUBRC1-p27 has six nucleotides inserted immediately downstream of the stop codon of the p27 ORF (TAGTAGGCTAA; inserted nucleotides in bold font) ( Fig. 1 ; Xiong et al., 1993b; Takeda et al., 2005) . However, it is difficult to address the above question by gene manipulation in the region used to create pUBRC1-p27, because any nucleotide changes in the region accompany changes in amino acid sequences in p88, which may affect RNA replication. Therefore, to avoid the effects of gene manipulation on amino acid sequences and cis-acting replication elements, we created other p88deficient RNA1 mutants by substituting the U at position 871, thirty nucleotides downstream of the stop codon of p27, because base-substitutions in the region of 870-875 nt have been shown not to affect RNA replication and systemic infection of RCNMV (Kim and Lommel, 1998) . pUBRC1-871A and pUBRC1-871G had A and G, respectively, at position 871, which create an additional stop codon to prevent p88 expression. pUBRC1-871C had C at position 871 to create a synonymous codon for wild-type tyrosine (Fig. 1) . These plasmids were inoculated into cowpea protoplasts alone or together with pUBp88 or a mixture of pUBp27 and pUBp88. pUBRC2 was also used to confirm the expression of p27 and p88. In inoculation with pUBRC1-871A or pUBRC1-871G alone, RNA1 mutants did not accumulate to detectable levels, confirming the lack of expression of functional p88 from these RNA1 mutants (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4) . In contrast, RNA1 from pUBRC1-871C accumulated to a level similar to wild-type RNA1 (Fig. 3, lanes 5) . Supplementation of p88, or both p88 and p27 in trans did not efficiently support the replication of RNA1 mutants from pUBRC1-871A and pUBRC1-871G ( Fig. 3. lanes 7, 8, 11 , and 12), whereas the trans-supplied p88 efficiently supported RNA2 replication with co-inoculated pUBRC1-871A or pUBRC1-871G ( Fig. 3. lanes 7 and 8) . The successful replication of RNA1 from pUBRC1-871C suggested that single-nucleotide substitutions at this position did not affect cis-acting RNA elements required for replication. Together, these results suggest that the impaired ability of RNA1 mutants expressing p27 alone to be amplified by trans-supplied p88 is caused by a cis-preferential requirement of p88 for RNA1 replication. Effects of mutations in the GDD motif on RNA1 replication in supply of wild-type p88 To investigate whether a complete translation process through p88 ORF is involved in the cis-preferential requirement of p88 for RNA1 replication, we used pUBRC1-p88uGVD, in which the Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) motif was substituted to Gly-Val-Asp (GVD) (Fig. 1) . The GDD motif is conserved in RdRP (Koonin and Dolja, 1993) , and is required for RCNMV RNA synthesis (Bates et al., 1995) . Cowpea protoplasts were inoculated with pUBRC1-p88uGVD or pUBRC1 together with or without pUBp88p and pUBRC2. In protoplasts inoculated with pUBRC1-p88uGVD, the accumulation of RNA1 was extremely low com-pared to that of wild-type RNA1 from pUBRC1 (Fig. 4) . Similar results were obtained in coinoculation with a mixture of pUBp88 and pUBRC2 (Fig. 4) . These results indicated that wild-type p88 supplied in trans did not complement the impaired replication of RNA1 mutant containing GVD motif. Failure of the rescue in the replication of RNA1 mutant with GVD motif by wild-type p88 suggests that the act of translation throughout the p88 ORF is insufficient by itself to recruit replication factors including p88 to RNA1, and supports the cis-preferential requirement of p88 for RNA1 replication. The effect of the introduced mutation in the GVD mutant on cis-acting RNA replication elements is discussed later. cis-Preferential requirement of p88 for negative-strand RNA synthesis in BYL To further investigate the functions of p27 and p88 in RNA1 replication, we analyzed negative-strand RNA synthesis in a BYL in vitro system using in vitro transcribed RNA1 mutants. This system allows one to analyze negative-strand RNA synthesis following translation from the input RCNMV RNAs (Iwakawa et al., 2007) . RNA1 transcripts having mutations corresponding to pUBRC1-871A, pUBRC1-p88u, pUBRC1-871A-dCP and pUBRC1-p88u-dCP were incubated in various combinations in the BYL in vitro system. Immunoblot analysis using p27-antiserum confirmed the accumulation of p27 and p88 as expected from the nucleotide sequences of RNA1 mutants (Fig. 5, lanes 3 to 8) . In incubation of a mixture of RNA1 mutants corresponding to pUBRC1-p88u and pUBRC1-871A-dCP and a mixture of those corresponding to pUBRC1-p88u-dCP and pUBRC1-871A, negative-strand RNA1s with a size expected from the respective mutants expressing p88 were detected as a band with strong intensity (Fig. 5, lanes 7 and 8) . RNA bands with sizes corresponding to those expected for RNA1 mutants expressing p27 were also detected in these lanes, but the intensity of the bands was similar to that of RNA1 mutants incubated alone (Fig. 5, lanes 3 to 6) . Therefore, these RNAs with weak signals were unlikely to be negative-strand RNA products synthesized from the input RNA1 mutants. Together, the results obtained in the BYL in vitro system indicated that negative-strand RNA was synthesized only from RNA1 mutants expressing p88 and in a cis-preferential manner.
