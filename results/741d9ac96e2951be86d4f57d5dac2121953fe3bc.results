Phylogenetic analysis of unique HCoV-OC43 strains using full-length genome sequences The phylogenetic tree reconstructed by the NJ method for the fulllength genome is illustrated in Figure 1A , which consists of the unique Malaysian HCoV-OC43 strains and all available global reference sequences from 2001 to 2013 (except for prototype strain ATCC VR759, which was isolated in the 1960s) (Supplementary Table S2 ). These reference sequences were classified previously as genotypes A to E, and these reference viruses were isolated from patients with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) in Paris, 34 Belgium, 5 China 9 and Hong Kong. 7 Phylogenetic trees were also reconstructed by the NJ and ML methods for full-length genome, which include genotyped (published, n = 13) and un-genotyped (unpublished, n = 76) reference sequences as well as 2 cell-adapted/neurovirulent strain sequences, as shown in Supplementary Figure S1 . Two distinct clusters (lineages 1 and 2) appeared to branch out from a genotype D-like common ancestor with high bootstrap support (100%) ( Figure 1A ; Supplementary Figure S1 ). The topology of this phylogenetic tree based on a full-length genome was similar to the tree topology based on a partial S gene reported in a previous study. 20 On the basis of the Figure 1B) , the distances of lineages 1 and 2 compared with genotypes A, B and E were 40.7% (0.007 substitutions/site), whereas distances were o0.5% when compared with genotypes C and D. This finding indicates that lineages 1 and 2 were more similar to genotypes C and D compared with genotypes A, B and E. Although the low mean genetic distance of 0.29 ± 0.03% between genotypes C and D is probably attributed to the recombinant nature of genotype D (genotype D was generated from recombination between genotypes B and C), 7 it is the lowest reported full-length genetic distance that separates HCoV-OC43 genotypes. Using this benchmark, with a genetic distance of 0.26 ± 0.02% between genotype D and lineage 1 and 0.27 ± 0.02% between genotype D and lineage 2, it is suggestive that the two lineages, which are designated as genotypes F and G hereafter, may have arisen and diverged from genotype D. Mosaic recombination structures of HCoV-OC43 genotypes F and G The mosaic recombination structures of genotypes F and G were determined and compared with genotype D by performing bootscan ) and E (1783A/10, 2058A/10, 3194A/12, 3074A/12) were used as putative parental genotypes. When the genomes of grouped genotypes F and G strains were used as query sequences, several potential recombination sites in the viral genomes were observed, separating the genome into at least five sub-regions (Figure 2A ). From the 5′ end of the genome to position 16 080 nt, bootscan analysis showed that sub-regions I (positions 1 to 2507 nt) and III (4851 to 16 080 nt) of genotypes F and G were closely related to genotype B, whereas sub-region II (2508 to 4850 nt) was closely related to genotype C (supported by sub-region NJ trees in Figure 2B ). Bootscan and sub-region tree analyses also revealed that these regions (sub-regions I-II-III) shared high homology with genotype D. From positions 16 081 to 17 166 nt (sub-region IV), genotypes F and G were closely related to genotype A, whereas positions 17 167 to 30 737 nt (sub-region V) were grouped with genotypes C and D (Figures 2A and 2B ). When the mosaic recombination structures of genotypes F and G were compared with genotype D, it is noticeable that all three genotypes shared similar recombination breakpoints between 2500-3000 nt, 4500-5000 nt and 16 000-17 000 nt. However, both genotypes F and G had an additional recombination breakpoint between 17 000-17 500 nt, which was not observed in genotype D; thus, parts of the nsp10 gene (sub-region IV, 16 081-17 166 nt) were genotyped as A-like. This finding indicates that recombination events led to the emergence of novel genotypes F and G with a putative genotype A-like parental strain in the nsp10 region despite sharing similar recombination structure in most parts of the genome with genotype D strains.
