The checklist resulting from workgroup deliberations is organized around recommendations for reporting background, search strategy, methods, results, discussion, and conclusions (TABLE) . Recommendations for reporting of results include graphical summaries of study estimates and any combined estimate, a table listing descriptive information for each study, results of sensitivity testing and any subgroup analysis, and an indication of statistical uncertainty of findings. Description of relevance or appropriateness of studies assembled for assessing the hypothesis to be tested Rationale for the selection and coding of data (eg, sound clinical principles or convenience) Documentation of how data were classified and coded (eg, multiple raters, blinding, and interrater reliability) Assessment of confounding (eg, comparability of cases and controls in studies where appropriate) Assessment of study quality, including blinding of quality assessors; stratification or regression on possible predictors of study results Assessment of heterogeneity Description of statistical methods (eg, complete description of fixed or random effects models, justification of whether the chosen models account for predictors of study results, dose-response models, or cumulative meta-analysis) in sufficient detail to be replicated Provision of appropriate tables and graphics Reporting of results should include Graphic summarizing individual study estimates and overall estimate
