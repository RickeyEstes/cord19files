A total of 306 SARI patients were admitted and enrolled by the two surveillance sites between week 40, 2010 and week 39, 2014; 48 did not meet the case definition and were excluded from further analyses leaving a total of 258 patients included in this analysis. Median age at admission was 63 years (range, 19-97 years) and 121 (47%) were women. One hundred thirty-one (51%) were white, non-Hispanic and 101 (39%) were Hispanic. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was four days (interquartile range (IQR); 2-6 days), the median duration of hospital stay was five days (IQR, 3-9 days); 96 (37%) patients were admitted to the ICU (Table 1) . Overall, 207 (80%) patients had one or more underlying medical condition (27% had one, 23% had two, 18% had three and 11% had four or more). The most common underlying medical condition was hypertension (48%, n = 125) followed by chronic lung disease (33%, n = 84) and cardiovascular disease (26%, n = 69). Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected and tested for 253 (98%) patients. Of the samples tested, 113 (45%) were positive for a viral respiratory pathogen. Nineteen percent of all the SARI samples and 42% of the positive samples (n = 47) had an influenza virus identified, 5% of the SARI and 12% of the positives (n = 13) had a parainfluenza virus, 8% of the SARI and 18% of the positives (n = 20) had a HMPV, 6% of the SARI and 12% of the positives (n = 14) had a coronavirus, and 3% of the SARI and 7% of the positives (n = 8) had a RSV (Table 1) . Underlying and contributing cause of death codes were listed on death certificates for 28 (93%) patients who died. Fourteen (50%) were classified as underlying pneumonia and influenza deaths and 14 (50%) as underlying respiratory and circulatory. All deaths were of natural causes.
