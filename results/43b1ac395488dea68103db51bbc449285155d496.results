In the present study a cough monitor was developed for calves which is capable of providing an early warning system for BRD recognition. Initially, the performance of the calf cough algorithm will be discussed. Subsequently, the algorithm's results of the number of coughs recorded are shown for sixty days in all three houses. The number of coughs were later compared with the two gold standards. Finally, the number of coughs that coincided with the days of treatment, as described Section 2.6, were examined.
