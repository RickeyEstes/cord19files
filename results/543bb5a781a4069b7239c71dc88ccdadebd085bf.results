In an earlier study we have described SARS-related CoVs in European (Bulgarian) bat species belonging to the genus Rhinolophus [44] . Fig 1A shows a phylogeny of SARS-related beta-CoVs based on the PLP gene (981 bp fragment, genome position 4885 to 5829 in GenBank accession number AY310120). Based on standing classification criteria, the European batderived CoVs are conspecific with human SARS-CoV and in sister relationship to all Asian SARS-related CoVs. In addition, closely related viruses that were not conspecific with SARS-CoV but represent the closest phylogenetic outgroup to the species SARS-related CoV were discovered in Ghanaian Hipposideros bats [45] . Hipposideros represents a sister genus to the typical SARS-CoV host Rhinolophus (Fig 1A) . The PLP of human SARS-CoV is henceforth referred to as SA-PLP; the PLP of the conspecific European bat virus as SR-PLP (for SARS-Related); and the PLP of the sister species virus as SO-PLP (for SARS Outgroup).
