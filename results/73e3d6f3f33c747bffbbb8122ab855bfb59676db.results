The peak and mean cough velocities during normal, moderate and weak coughing efforts were estimated by analyzing data from 12 coughing cycles in each mode (Table 1) . During normal coughing efforts when the HPS was lying at 45u on the bed, the average exhaled air dispersion distance along the median sagittal plane was 68.0 6 6.5 cm without a facemask. This was significantly reduced by wearing a surgical mask (30.0 6 3.4 cm) or N95 mask (15.1 6 2.7 cm), p , 0.001 (Fig. 2) . Exhaled air dispersion, while coughing without wearing any facemask, was in the forward and downward directions without any lateral dispersion ( Fig. 3 and Fig. 4) . There was substantial leakage through the mask-nasal bridge interface to the upward direction and some downward leakage through the lower edges when wearing a surgical mask (Fig. 3) . With tight application of the N95 mask, there was less expelled air leakage through the nasal bridge to the upward direction (Fig. 4) . The corresponding lateral dispersion distance when wearing a surgical mask was 27.9 6 2.6 cm whereas N95 mask significantly reduced the lateral dispersion to 15.0 6 1.7 cm, p , 0.001 (Fig. 4) . The sagittal expelled air dispersion distances were significantly decreased in moderate (55.0 6 6.7 cm) and severe lung injury (30.0 6 2.6 cm, p , 0.001). The use of surgical mask or N95 mask further reduced the dispersion distance to 27.2 6 2.4 cm, 14.0 6 1.6 cm (p , 0.001) in moderate lung injury and 24.0 6 2.4 cm, 12.1 6 1.2 cm in severe lung injury, respectively. The exhaled air dispersion in moderate and severe lung injury without wearing any mask was again in the forward and downward direction, but there was again substantial leakage through the mask-nasal bridge interface to the upward direction and some downward leakage when wearing a surgical mask. The N95 mask prevented the forward leakage well, with slight leakage through the nasal bridge to the upward direction ( Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 ).
