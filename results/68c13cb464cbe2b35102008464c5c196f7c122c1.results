Power simulations were performed for varying numbers of strains, replicates, functional alleles, and for a ladder of QTL effect sizes. QTL effect size was defined in two ways: as the variance explained in a hypothetical population that is balanced with respect to the alleles (Definition B; see Methods), or as the variance explained in the realized population (Definition DAMB). In this section we focus on results using the first of these, Definition B, owing to its more consistent theoretical interpretation. Under that definition, plots of power against numbers of strains are shown in Figure 3 , and power across a representative selection of conditions is shown in Table 1 . For comparison, these numbers are also provided for simulations under Definition DAMB in Table S1 . Throughout these simulations the false positive rate was controlled at the target 0.05 level ( Figure S2 ). Large effect QTL usually detected by 50 or more strains As a baseline for describing mapping power in the CC, an experiment using one replicate (r Â¼ 1) of all 72 strains is well-powered to detect QTL explaining .40% of phenotypic variance but moderately or low powered for QTL explaining 30% or less (Table 1) . Specifically, assuming eight functional alleles, there is 96.4% power to detect a 50% QTL, 79.2% for a 40% QTL, 44.1% for a 30% QTL, and 12.4% for a 20% QTL. More broadly, simulations across different allele effect types and numbers of strains showed that studies without replicates and with large numbers of strains (.50) were found to be well-powered to detect large effect QTL (.40%) (Figure 3 [top] ). Identifying smaller effect QTL should be feasible, however, using replicates. Replicates improve power by reducing the individual noise variance; as such the extent of the power improvement diminishes as more variance is attributable to background strain effects than noise. Assuming no background strain effect, and using 50 strains, we determined the power to detect a 20% effect-size QTL with a single replicate was near zero; with 5 replicates it approached 80%. Detecting QTL with effect sizes # 10%, however, was challenging. For example, achieving 80% power to detect an effect size of 10% when all 72 CC strains were used required more than 5 replicates per strain (Figure 3 [middle right]). Moreover, assuming a background strain effect, as would be expected with a complex trait, can reduce the QTL mapping power of small effect QTL substantially (Figure 3 [bottom] ). Additional strains improve power more than additional replicates We investigated the relationship between power and the total number of mice, evaluating whether power gains were greater with additional CC strains or additional replicate observations. Power was interpolated over a grid of values for number of replicates and total number of mice from simulations based on a single observation per strain ( Figure 5 ). This showed that additional CC strains improved mapping power more than additional replicates; this is indicated by higher power values for lower numbers of replicates while holding number of mice constant (see Figure 5 , bordered vertical section at 250 mice).
