Clinical features. At week 7, the rats exhibited variable retardation in weight gain. By week 10, two rats showed moderate dyspnea and severe weight loss. None of the rats exhibited severe respiratory distress or marked changes in behavior during the experiments. Gross findings. No gross pulmonary lesions were observed in the rats between weeks 0 and 5. Gross pulmonary lesions were first identified at week 7 and by week 10, all the rats had gross pulmonary lesions. The lungs of the rats were slightly enlarged and moderately consolidated with a mottled appearance, or interspersed with single or multiple gray or white foci of increased firmness. Grossly visible necrosis, hemorrhage or pleural thickening was absent. Microscopic findings. No microscopic changes were observed in the lungs of the rats during weeks 0 and 1. However, by week 3, pulmonary blood vessels exhibited an edematous vascular sheath with a few small lymphoid aggregates surrounding the vessels (Fig. 1A and B) . The adjacent alveolar spaces and septa exhibited no pathological abnormality. By week 5, dense lymphoid cuffs surrounded the blood vessels ( Fig. 1C and D) and the adjacent alveolar septa were minimally infiltrated with lymphocytes and macrophages. By week 7, the lymphoid perivascular cuffs were more frequently identified. In addition, areas of nonsuppurative lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia showing alveoli infiltrated by lymphocytes and macrophages and thickened alveolar septa were observed (Fig. 1E) . Perivascular hemorrhage was also observed at this time point. By week 10, a substantial increase in perivascular lymphocytes and macrophages formed thick leukocytic cuffs encircling the blood vessels adjacent to the areas of alveolar septal thickening and leukocytic infiltrates (Fig. 1F ). Compensatory alveolar emphysema was also identified. The infiltrating cells were primarily lymphocytes and macrophages, with a small number of eosinophils and plasma cells. The lesions consisted of marked lymphohistiocytic interstitial inflammation, extensive alveolar leukocytic infiltrates with septal thickening and the formation of dense lymphoid cuffs and aggregates around the small blood vessels. In a few foci, foamy eosinophilic exudates characteristic of PCP were also identified (Fig. 1G) . GMS staining showed a number of typical ovoid, thick-walled Pneumocystis cysts ( Fig. 1G; inset) , but no airway changes were identified. By week 14, the lesions were resolved in about half of the rats. No pathological abnormality was observed in the control animals.
