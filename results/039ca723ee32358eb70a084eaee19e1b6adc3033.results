A total of 907 human H5N1 cases were reported globally during the 18-year period from May 1, 1997 through April 30, 2015, of which 94.6% were confirmed cases and 5.4% were probable cases (Table 1 and The overall male-to-female ratio was almost even (1:1.2) from 1997 to 2014, although this pattern was not uniform across regions ( Table 1 ). The median age of cases was 19 years, with an inter quartile range (IQR) from 5 to 32 years, and 41.2% (363/881) were children under 15 years of age and 80.3% (707/881) were in people under 35y. The median age of non-fatal cases was younger in North Africa and older in East and Southeast Asia (median and IQR: 6 and 3-31 years vs. 18.5 and 6-30 years), but the median age of fatal cases was older in North Africa than in East and Southeast Asia (median and IQR: 30 and 20-36 years vs. 19 and 9-30 years) ( Figure 4 ). In total, 16 countries reported human cases between 1997 and 2015. The number of affected countries has risen between 2003 and 2008, with expansion from East Asia to Southeast Asia, then West Asia, North Africa and other regions, and apparent ongoing transmission and cases reported almost every year in China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia and Egypt (Appendix Figure 4A ). The incidence in Asia remained at low levels in 2013-2015, while the number of cases in Egypt has increased in 2014-2015. During 1997-2015, 67.2% (594/884) of cases were reported from December to March, with a peak in January (20.9%) (Appendix Figure 5 ). However, compared to the countries in Southeast Asia and North Africa at lower latitudes, countries in East Asia and West Asia had fewer cases occurring in the warm/hot season from April to September (8.1% vs. 26.2%), and showed earlier peaks (December vs. January) and shorter epidemic periods, with cases occurring year round in Southeast Asia and North Africa, but from January to June and October to December in East Asia, and only from December to March in West Asia(Appendix Figure 4B Table 1 ). The age distribution of cases also differed by outcome, with a median age of 22 years (IQR: 11.5-32 years) for fatal cases and 10 years (IQR: 3-30 years) for cases who recovered ( Figure 3C -D). The majority (95.8%, 748/781) of cases reported exposure to poultry including: 85.7% (439/512) exposed to sick or dead poultry; 61.4% (188/306) exposed to backyard poultry; 26.4% (82/311) exposed to LBMs; 4.7% (15/321) occupational exposure to live poultry. In addition, 6.2% (49/792) reported contact with a human H5N1 case before the onset of illness (Table 1, Appendix  Table 3 ). Time from onset of illness to hospitalization was available for 79.7% (723/907) cases with a median of 4 days (IQR: 2-6 days). Generally, the survived cases had an earlier hospitalization than fatal cases (median and IQR: 3 and 1-6 days vs. 5 and 3-7) (Appendix Figure 6 ). Additionally, the cases in North Africa had a shorter time from onset to hospitalization than cases in East and Southeast Asia (median and IQR: 3 and 1-6 days vs. 5 and 3-7), but the median time from onset to outcome was the same (10 days) between cases in North Africa and cases in East and Southeast Asia.
