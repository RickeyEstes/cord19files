The final sample for analysis included 913 practice Web sites (see Figure 1 , Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JPHMP/A304, which describes how the final sample was determined). The majority of practices were categorized as "OB/GYN" only (n = 393; 43%), followed by practices with a nonuniversity hospital affiliation (n = 293; 32%) ( Table 2 ). More practices had Facebook accounts (n = 633) linked to their practice Web sites than had Twitter accounts (n = 433). Thirty-six percent of practices (n = 332) were found to have posted Zika virus content anywhere on the Web site or linked social media accounts during the August data collection period (Table 3) . This was an increase from the January collection period, when 25% of practices (n = 224) were found to have posted Zika virus content. In contrast, the proportion of practices posting Zika virus information on their social media accounts decreased between the 2 time points (Facebook: 15% of practices posted in January vs 9% in August; Twitter: 12% posted in January vs 8% in August). Fourteen percent of practices (n = 132) posted advice on the use of insect repellent during the August data collection period, a decrease of 1% from the January data collection period (Table 4) . A decrease in the proportion of practices posting travel advisories was also seen; 21% (n = 189) posted information about travel advisories in January compared with only 14% (n = 130) in August. While the other content themes were not assessed during the January period, 14%, 11%, and 9% had information posted in August on sexual transmission of Zika virus, prenatal testing for Zika virus, and draining of standing water to reduce mosquito populations, respectively. In addition, only 5% of practices offered Zika virus information in Spanish during the August data collection period. Compared with OB/GYN-only practices, practices affiliated with hospital systems were significantly more likely to post Zika virus information in any location during both the January and August data collection periods: university-affiliated hospital system-January: odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) = 5.7 (3.50-9.20), August: OR (95% CI) = 8.4 (5.31-13.17); non-university-affiliated hospital system-January: OR (95% CI) = 2.7 (1.88-3.92), August: OR (95% CI) = 6.8 (4.75-9.60) ( Table 5 ). There was no significant association between posting and multispecialty practices during either data collection period.
