The titres of Group-2 influenza pseudotype particles expressed in RLU/ml are shown in Figure 3 . Through cotransfection with pCAGGS-TMPRSS2, we successfully obtained high-titre viral pseudotype particles harbouring the haemagglutinin of a human H3N2 virus (A/Udorn/307/1972), A/duck/Czechoslovakia/1956 (H4N6), A/chicken/Germany/ N49 (H10N7), A/mallard/Astrakhan/263/1982 (H14N5), A/shearwater/West Australia/2576/1979 (H15N9) and H7 LPAI virus A/chicken/Italy/1082/1999 (H7N1). Notably, H3, H4 and H10 pseudotypes were produced with titres above 10 9 RLU/mL. The pseudotype particle titres obtained with TMPRSS2 transfection were compared to the controls: ΔTMPRSS2 influenza pseudotypes, ΔTMPRSS2 TPCK-Trypsin activated influenza pseudotypes and pseudotype particles produced without the HA envelope protein (Δenvelope). These data indicate that TMPRSS2 activates the haemagglutinin not only of human strains, such as A/ Udorn/307/1972 (H3N2), but also the haemagglutinin of avian influenza strains (H4, H14, H15, H7 LPAI and H10 subtypes) in a similar manner to TPCK-Trypsin. When tested in neutralization assays, the pseudotype particles were efficiently neutralized by their paired antisera (Table 1) using an IC 50 cut-off dilution of 1:80. The only exception was for A/Udorn/307/1972 (H3N2) pseudotype that is efficiently neutralized (IC 50 > 1:5120) by the anti-A/England/427/1988 (H3N2) sheep serum, but moderately neutralized by the anti-H3N8 sera of avian origin (IC 50 = 1:160-1:320). Different neutralization profiles were also observed between the different H7 antisera, with the anti-A/chicken/England/4054/2006 (H7N3) exhibiting the least potent neutralization activity (IC 50 = 1:1280-1:2560).
