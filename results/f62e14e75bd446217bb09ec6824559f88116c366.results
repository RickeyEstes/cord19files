Generation of recombinant viruses with H3 for H1 amino acid sequence replacements In this study we aimed at determining which HA sequences are responsible for the observed differences of virus replication and associated pathology between H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes in Tmprss2 knock-out (Tmprss2 À/À ) mice. For this, we generated several reassortants and mutant viruses based on A/ Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) and A/Hong Kong/01/68 (H3N2) (HK). Plasmids were generated by sequence and ligation independent cloning (SLIC) and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 to rescue viruses. We first generated two reassorted viruses, HK_HA(PR8) carrying the entire HA segment of H1 on the backbone of HK, and PR8_HA(HK) carrying the entire HA segment of H3 on the backbone of PR8 (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, we generated a recombinant virus [PR8_HA(MVEKT)] in which we replaced the HA cleavage site and neighbouring amino acids of H1-HA with the amino acid sequence of H3-HA (region from amino acids 320 to 329, at the C-terminus of HA 1 , Fig. 1 ). We refer to this HA region as the 'HA-loop' which is predicted to interact with cellular proteases and in which HA cleavage occurs between amino acids R329 and G330 (Fig. 1) . Additionally, we produced a virus in which we also exchanged a more distant amino acid from the H1-HA to the H3-HA sequence that is predicted to interact with amino acids in the loop (see below for more details) either by itself or in combination with the loop exchange. In these viruses, referred to as PR8_HA(D) or PR8_HA(D-MVEKT), respectively, the glutamate at position 31 was replaced by aspartate from H3 (E31 to D31, Fig. 1 ). Of note, we could not rescue recombinant virus with single amino acid exchange in the H1-HA-loop (predicted protease recognition sequence: H1-PSIQSR to H3-PEKQTR) suggesting that the entire H1-HA-loop or H3-HA-loop sequence is required for a functional HA. The replaced and mutated HA segments (segment 4) were incorporated into viruses with an isogenic PR8 backbone for all other segments (Fig. 1 ). HA segment of H1 and H3 determines resistance phenotype in Tmprss2 À/À mice WT and Tmprss2 À/À knock-out (KO) mice were infected with 2Â10 5 f.f.u. PR8, HK_HA(PR8) and PR8_HA(HK). After infection with PR8 (H1N1), WT mice lost body weight and all infected mice died, whereas Tmprss2 À/À mice lost body weight only slightly and all infected mice survived (Fig. 2a) . Infection with HK_HA(PR8) resulted in body weight loss in WT similar to infections with PR8 whereas Tmprss2 À/À mice showed a similar resistance phenotype as for infections with PR8 (Fig. 2b) . These results demonstrate that the resistance phenotype to H1N1 virus in Tmprss2 À/À mice resides in the H1-HA segment and that other proteins of the HK virus do not have a major impact. Infection of Tmprss2 À/À and WT mice with PR8_HA(HK) led to body weight loss in both mouse strains and death of all infected mice (Fig. 2c) . These results are consistent with our previous observations using the entire HK (H3N2) virus [10] . Also, Fig. 1 . Scheme of recombinant viruses. The structure of recombinant viruses with name, origin of segment 4 (HA), origin of the loop, backbone segments (Other proteins) and relevant HA amino acid sequences are illustrated. Differences at the amino acid level are shown for the N-terminal part (amino acids [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and the protease recognition site with its neighbouring region (amino acids 320-329, H3 numbering), which we refer to here as the 'HA-loop' (highlighted in green). HA 1 is highlighted in orange (except the HA-loop) and HA 2 in yellow. Differences in amino acid sequences between HA-HK and HA-PR8 are labelled red. The arrow indicates where cleavage occurs. PR8: A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1); HK: A/Hong Kong/01/68 (H3N2). results with the reassorted viruses HK_HA(PR8) and PR8_HA(HK) were identical to the results from the parental viruses (PR8, HK) in previous studies when the same infection dose was used (2Â10 3 f.f.u.; Fig. S1 , available in the online version of this article). Together, our results demonstrate that exchange of the HA segments leads to a phenotype that resembles that of the parental virus (H1N1 or H3N2, respectively) in Tmprss2 À/À and WT mice. Thus, H3-HA is necessary and sufficient for body weight loss and mortality in Tmprss2 À/À mice. Exchange of H1 to H3 cleavage loop is not sufficient for TMPRSS2 escape Next, we sought to identify the specific amino acid sequences in the H3-HA that are responsible for body weight loss and mortality in Tmprss2 À/À mice. For this, we exchanged the H3 sequence (MRNVPEKQTR) for the HA-loop of H1 (LRNIP-SIQSR) resulting in virus PR8_HA(MVEKT). Infection of WT mice showed that PR8_HA(MVEKT) was not as pathogenic as the parental PR8 virus; only 50 % of the infected WT mice died after infection with PR8_HA(MVEKT) compared to 100 % lethality of WT mice after infection with PR8 or PR8_HA(HK) (Fig. 3a) . More importantly, after infection with PR8_HA(MVEKT) virus, Tmprss2 À/À mice only lost body weight slightly and all infected mice survived (Fig. 3a) . These results demonstrate that the exchange of the HA-loop alone from H1-HA to H3-HA is not sufficient to cause strong body weight loss and mortality in Tmprss2 À/À mice, suggesting that additional amino acids outside the HA-loop region are required for this phenotype. Additional amino acid exchanges at distant sites allow the resistance to Tmprss2 À/À to be overcome The results described above showed that the exchange of the H3-HA-loop for the H1-HA-loop alone does not result in a virus that overcomes TMPRSS2 dependency. Therefore, we inspected the crystal structure of the H1-HA from the 1918 'Spanish flu' virus (PDB [15] ID: 1RD8; [16] ) in more detail. H1-HA of the H1N1 1918 'Spanish flu' virus and the PR8 (H1N1) utilized in this study share a sequence similarity of HA determines resistance phenotype in Tmprss2 À/À mice. Female WT and Tmprss2 À/À mice (8-12 weeks old) were infected intranasally with 2Â10 5 f.f.u. of (a) PR8 (H1N1), (b) HK_HA(PR8) (H1N2) or (c) PR8_HA(HK) (H3N1) and body weight was monitored for 14 days p.i. Left: mean body weight in percent of starting weight ±1 SEM. Right: survival graphs. Statistics for body weight loss were performed only for groups in which more than 50 % of infected mice were still alive. Significances were calculated using repeated measures ANOVA followed by a pair-wise t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple testing. Statistics for survival curves were calculated with the log rank test. Stars indicate adjusted P-values (*P<0.05; **P<0.01; ***P<0.001); ns: non-significant. In addition to mice that were found dead, animals with a body weight loss of more than 30 % of the starting body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead. 89 % and the herein discussed amino acids are present in both proteins. By this approach, we identified a salt bridge formed by arginine at position 321 and glutamic acid at position 31 which is located in proximity to the HA-loop and thus might play a role for protease recognition (Fig. 4) . Therefore, we also replaced this amino acid in H1 with the equivalent amino acid from the H3 sequence in addition to the HA-loop: aspartic acid at position 31 (mutant E31D). This resulted in virus PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) (Fig. 1 ). Of note, PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) could only be rescued after exchange of the codon GAG (encoding for glutamic acid, nucleotide 144-146) to GAU, but not GAC (both encoding for aspartic acid) which might be due to a restriction in the cis-acting specific packaging signal [17] . After infection with PR8_HA(D-MVEKT), Tmprss2 À/À mice showed strong body weight loss with a similar kinetic as WT mice (Fig. 3b) . Also, all of the infected WT mice and 40 % of infected Tmprss2 À/À mice died (Fig. 3b) . Thus, PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) is able to cause considerable body weight loss and mortality also in Tmprss2 À/À mice although to a lesser extent. We confirmed that both exchanges are required for the higher pathogenicity of PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) by studying the pathogenicity of the single mutant PR8_HA(D) virus (Figs 1 and S2). This virus exhibits slightly higher pathogenicity (body weight loss similar, one mouse died) in Tmprss2 À/À mice than PR8 but was much less virulent than PR8_HA(D-MVEKT). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that both the loop and distant amino acids are necessary for causing severe symptoms upon infection in Tmprss2 À/À mice. Exchange of the HA-loop and a distant amino acid to H3 increases viral replication in Tmprss2 À/À mice Next, we investigated if the higher mortality in PR8_HA(D-MVEKT)-infected mice was due to increased viral replication. WT and Tmprss2 À/À mice were infected with 2Â10 5 f.f.u. PR8, PR8_HA(HK), PR8_HA(MVEKT) and PR8_HA(D-MVEKT). On day 2 and 4 p.i., viral loads were determined in infected lungs (Fig. 5) . ANOVA of the viral load as the response variable revealed significant effects of virus-type and mouse-strain as well as their interaction. Pair-wise comparisons showed that viral loads were significantly higher in WT compared to Tmprss2 À/À mice after infection with PR8 and PR8_HA(MVEKT) at 2 and 4 days p.i. demonstrating that viral replication is strongly reduced in the absence of TMPRSS2 (Fig. 5 ). On the other hand, no Exchange of the cleavage site and one additional amino acid is required for body weight loss and mortality in Tmprss2 À/À mice. Female WT and Tmprss2 À/À mice (8-12 weeks old) were infected intranasally with 2Â10 5 f.f.u. of (a) PR8_HA(MVEKT), (b) PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) and body weight was monitored for 14 days p.i. Left: mean body weight in percent of starting weight ± 1 SEM. Right: survival graphs. Statistics for body weight loss were performed only for groups in which more than 50 % of infected mice were still alive. Significances were calculated using repeated measures ANOVA followed by a pair-wise t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg for multiple testing correction. Statistics for survival curves were calculated with the log rank test. Stars indicate adjusted P-values (*P<0.05; ***P<0.001); ns: non-significant. In addition to mice that were found dead, animals with a body weight loss of more than 30 % of the starting body weight were euthanized and recorded as dead. significant difference was observed between WT and KO mice after infection with PR8_HA(HK) and PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) on day 2 suggesting that replacement of the HAloop plus a distant amino acid allows efficient replication of PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) in Tmprss2 À/À mice ( Fig. 5 ). At day 4 after infection with HK_HA(PR8) the viral load was lower than at day 2, but still the same for WT and Tmprss2 À/À (Fig. 5) . In contrast to this observation, the viral load of PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) at 4 days p.i. was lower in Tmprss2 À/ À mice compared to the WT. This is in agreement with the higher survival rate of Tmprss2 À/À mice. Additionally, viral replication was significantly higher in Tmprss2 À/À mice infected with PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) compared to infections with PR8_HA(MVEKT) or PR8 at day 2 and 4 ( Fig. 5) . Thus, the difference in virus virulence (body weight loss and mortality) between PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) and PR8_HA (MVEKT) can be explained by differences in viral replication in infected lungs and thus increased tissue damage.
