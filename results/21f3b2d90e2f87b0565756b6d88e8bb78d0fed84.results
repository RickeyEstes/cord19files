Intranasal inoculation of HCoV-OC43 NV , but not HCoV-OC43 TC , is uniformly fatal to 5-to 8-week-old C57BL/6 (B6) mice In confirmation of our preliminary results, intranasal inoculation of HCoV-OC43 NV resulted in 100% mortality in mice ranging from 5 to 8 weeks old (Fig. 1A) . Mice developed signs of acute encephalitis, including hunched posture, lethargy and wasting by days 6-7. Mortality was associated with a 30 -35% loss of body mass (Fig. 1B) . Severe clinical encephalitis was associated with widespread mononuclear cell infiltration including perivascular cuffing and with loss of CNS architecture (data not shown). In contrast, intranasal inoculation of 5week-old C57BL/6 mice with HCoV-OC43 TC did not cause any clinical disease, including any weight loss (Fig. 1) . Consistent with the uniformly lethal outcome observed in Fig. 1 . HCoV-OC43 NV is uniformly lethal to wild type C57BL/6 mice. 5-weekold mice were inoculated intranasally with 30 LD 50 HCoV-OC43 NV or 10 6 TCID 50 HCoV-OC43 TC as described in Materials and methods. Mice were monitored daily for survival (A) and weight loss (B). (*Indicates P < 0.0002). mice infected with HCoV-OC43 NV , we detected high titers of virus in the CNS of infected mice. HCoV-OC43 NV grew poorly in tissue culture cells and we could only reliably titer infectious virus using suckling mice, as described in Materials and methods. Virus titers increased from days 5 to 7 (Fig. 2) . To confirm these results, we also measured viral loads using a realtime RT-PCR assay. As shown in Figs. 2A and B , there was a strong positive correlation between recovery of infectious virus and the detection of OC43 nucleocapsid RNA in the brains of mice. Also, and in agreement with the results of Jacomy et al. (Jacomy and Talbot, 2003) , HCoV-OC43 infected other organs to a small extent, such as the lungs and intestines, when viral RNA was assayed by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 2C) . Notably, the results also suggested that virus was in the process of clearance at the time of death since virus titers/RNA levels declined between days 7 and 9 p.i. (Fig. 2C) . In mice infected intranasally with neurovirulent strains of MHV, virus enters the CNS via the olfactory nerves with subsequent transneuronal retrograde dissemination to distant connections of the olfactory bulb (Perlman et al., 1989 (Perlman et al., , 1990 . Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to track HCoV-OC43 RNA and antigen, respectively, we detected overlap between the pathways of entry and spread used by MHV and those used by HCoV-OC43 after intranasal inoculation. HCoV-OC43 was detected in the olfactory bulb and the olfactory nucleus at 3 days p.i. but was cleared from these structures by day 5 p.i. At later time points (days 7 and 9 p.i.), HCoV-OC43 RNA and antigen were detected primarily in the brainstem and the spinal cord (Fig. 3A , data not shown). Unlike MHV, which is known to infect oligodendrocytes and is present throughout the white matter in the infected CNS, HCoV-OC43 was not detected in the white matter at any time point examined (shown at day 9 p.i. in Figs. 3A, B).
