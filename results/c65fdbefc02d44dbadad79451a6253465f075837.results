Nucleotide composition analysis. Nineteen parameters, including three mononucleotide frequencies (G, C and T) and 16 dinucleotide biases, were computed from 777 spike gene sequences (see Supplementary Table S1 ). All parameters show significant differences across the host groups (Kruskal-Wallis tests, p < 2.2e-16); therefore, they were subsequently employed as factors in statistical models for discriminant analyses. Empirically, a dinucleotide relative abundance or dinucleotide bias (e.g., ρ xy ) is significantly high if ρ ≥ . . Among the 16 dinucleotides in this study, the CpA and TpG show an average abundance that is significantly higher than the expected values (ρ CA = 1.29, ρ TG = 1.28), whereas the average bias of CpG is extremely low (ρ CG = 0.44). This result indicates that the observed abundances of CpA and TpG are significantly higher than their expected values, and the observed abundance of CpG is significantly lower than the expected value. The G+ C content is minimal (31-47%) . This finding indicates that coronaviruses exhibit a low density of nucleotide sequences and may be sensitive to heat or alkali. The low G+ C content also indicates a preference for codons ending with A or T and a higher mutability. Training and validation of statistical models. The data matrix with 19 factors as columns and 730 samples as rows was fitted to SVM and MD models, all predictions in leave-one-out cross-validations were listed in Supplementary Table S2 and summarized in Table 1 according to host species. The validations indicate that both models achieved high accuracies on the training data set: 99.86% for the SVM and 98.08% for the MD. All incorrect cases in unsupervised predictions are listed in Table 2 . The only incorrect prediction by the SVM is sample NC_016996.1, which is isolated from an avian species but was predicted to infect humans. Among all 14 incorrect predictions by MD, bats are the common predicted hosts. No sample was incorrectly predicted by both models.
