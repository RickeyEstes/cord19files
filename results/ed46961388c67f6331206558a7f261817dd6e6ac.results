No complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute respiratory system injury, acute kidney injury or septic shock occurred in our cohort. Concerning the pneumonia severity score, for Curb-65, 134 patients had a zero score, 15 patients had a score of 1. until Feb 15th 2020, 76 patients remained in the hospital, 73 were discharged and no patient died. The radiological data on admission is summarized in Table 4 . The median interval between symptom onset and CT examination was 7.61 (7) days. On admission, by median, each patient had 3 (4) involved pulmonary lobes and 6 (10.5) involved segments. Segment 6 and 10 were the most involved ( p < 0.001). A total of 287 (12.1%) segments presented GGO, 637 (26.8%) segments presented mixed opacity and 170 (7.2%) segments presented consolidation. The lesions were more localized in the periphery rather than the center of the lung (853,35.9% vs 51, 2.15%). There were more patchy lesions than oval lesions (935,39.35% vs 157, 6.6%). Other imaging patterns such as centrilobular nodules, tree-in-bud sign, cystic change, lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion were rare. Comparison between patients with different exposure history was also performed. No significant difference of demographic, clinical characteristics, laboratory test or imaging manifestations was found between these two groups (all p > 0.05) (Supplementary  Tables 1-4) . Interestingly, 17 out of 149 (11.4%) of our patients had normal chest CT findings on admission. Among these 17 patients, chest CT of 12 patients kept being negative, with the latest follow-up CT 10.3 days later. In contrast, the chest CT of the other 5 patients became positive over an average of 7 days. The symptoms of these 12 patients included fever (8 patients), cough (3 patients), expectoration (1 patient), headache (1 patient), sore throat (2 patients), snotty (1 patient), diarrhea (1 patient). Two patients presented leukopenia, 1 patient presented lymphopenia.
