We first examined the effect of IFN-alfacon 1 on the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero 76 cells at 37°C. IFN-alfacon 1 inhibited virus replication in a dose-dependent manner. IFN-alfacon 1 had an IC 50 of 0.16 ng/ml and CC 50 of >100 ng/ml as determined by NR assay (Table 1) . However, IFN-alfacon 1 did not always work in the Vero 76 cells. The activity against SARS-CoV in Vero 76 cells was sporadic and appeared to be highly variable depending upon the age and condition of the host cells. The monolayers of Vero 76 cells had to be rinsed gently to achieve valid NR assays. Then, IFN-alfacon 1 inhibition of virus replication was further tested in Vero E6 cells and MA104 cells. IFN-alfacon 1 provided a complete protection at the higher doses and a linear dose response at the lower part of the concentration curve. IC 50 was 4.6 ng/ml in Vero E6 cells and, 0.29 ng/ml in MA104 cells, respectively (Table 1) . IFN-alfacon 1 also inhibited SARS-CoV isolate with SI values ranging from >22 to >625 (Table 1 ). The cytopathic effect in infected Calu-3 cells was not observed within 3 days of infection. The activity of IFN-alfacon 1 was further tested in a virus yield reduction assay. IFN-alfacon 1 reduced virus yields by 90% at 3.3 ng/ml in Vero 76 cells. IFN-alfacon 1 reduced virus yields by 90% at 3.02 ng/ml in Vero E6 cells. IFN-alfacon 1 had an IC 90 = 0.33 ng/ml in MA104 cells, which confirmed the activity demonstrated by NR assay ( Table 2 ). SARS-CoV was found to productively infect human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells; SARS-CoV-induced CPE was initially observed in medium containing 20% FCS at day 8 and 2% FCS at day 4 [24] . Based on these observations, IFN-alfacon 1 was evaluated to test the inhibitory effect on plating of SARS-CoV infection from the culture fluids of the infected Calu-3 cells. The supernatants were kept frozen at À80°C until they were needed for assessing infectious viral titers by a standard TCID50 assay with permissive Vero 76 cells, as described above. The activity of IFN-alfacon 1 was confirmed by the virus yield reduction assay. IFN-alfacon 1 blocked viral production after incubation for 3 days in comparison to mock-treated cells and reduced virus yields by 90% at 0.046 ng/ml ( Table 2) . IFN-alfacon 1 inhibited SARS-CoV infection in Calu-3 with SI value of 2173 (Table  2 ). We also verified that SARS-CoV can infect human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells without causing significant cytopathic effects within 3 days of infection (Table 3) .
