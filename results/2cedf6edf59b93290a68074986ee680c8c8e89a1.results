The density of movement (Table 1) shows that there was greater connectivity for cattle than for the heavily traded poultry. Breeding networks were found to be denser than those for other purposes. This may be due to the number of consignments needed to move the relative units of animals. The geographical trade flows are shown in Figures 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5 and 6. The transitivity indicates that disease would spread more slowly for 'other' purposes of animal movement than for breeding, fattening or slaughter with the exception of poultry and equines. Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 show the in-and outdegrees of livestock unit movements in the EU on the left and the geographical trade flows in the right, which are separated by species and by purpose of trade. The axes of the graphs of the in-and outdegrees reflect the numbers of trading partners. The countries in the top right received and exported animals with the greatest number of countries, whilst the bottom left indicates those that have little or no export or import trade with other countries. Some countries are found in the top right corner with regards to many different animal movements e.g. Germany, whilst others rarely buy or sell to the other 26 countries considered in this study e.g. Cyprus, Finland and Sweden, whilst other countries import from many countries and export to few e.g. Italy. Very few shipments of weaned cattle, sheep and goats require a rest period of 24 hours (Additional file 1), whereas many unweaned animals would require a 24 hour break in their journey from their point of origin to their Figure 1 The outdegree is shown against the indegree for the trade of cattle for different purposes on the left column of the table and the geographical movement across Europe is shown on the right column of the table. The arrows between the countries indicate trade between the countries. The numbers in the figures refer to the corresponding countries: [1] Austria, [2] Belgium, [3] Bulgaria, [4] Cyprus, [5] Czech Republic, [6] Denmark, [7] Estonia, [8] Finland, [9] France, [10] Germany, [11] Greece, [12] Hungary, [13] Ireland, [14] Italy, [15] Lithuania, [16] Latvia, [17] Luxembourg, [18] Malta, [19] Netherlands, [20] Poland, [21] Portugal, [22] Romania, [23] Slovakia, [24] Slovenia, [25] Spain, [26] Sweden and [27] UK. and exporting high proportions of their national population, the officially recorded number of animals of that species in the particular country.
