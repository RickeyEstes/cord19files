A one-step, real-time, accelerated quantitative RTLAMP assay was standardized for rapid detection of novel S-OIV. A set of six primers, comprising two outer primers (F3 and B3), two internal primers (FIP and BIP), and two loop primers (FLP and BLP), were designed using the H1 gene strain recommended by the WHO (Human H1N1 virus isolates, California, 2009, Gene Bank Accession No FJ966082). Each primer's position in the genomic sequences is shown in Table 1 . The monitoring of gene amplification was accomplished by real-time monitoring of turbidity, which is recorded at 400 nm every 6 seconds with the help of a loopamp real-time turbidity meter (Teramecs, Los Angeles, CA). The result indicated that the minimum time required for the initiation of amplification was 15 minutes. It was also observed that there was continuous amplification of the target sequence, as revealed by the increased turbidity; in the negative control, the turbidity remained fixed at about 0.01, well below the threshold value ( Figure  1) . None of the positive samples, which were tested multiple times, showed increased turbidity after 30 minutes. Therefore, a sample having time of positivity (Tp) values of 30 minutes or less and turbidity above the threshold value of 0.1 or more was considered to be positive.
