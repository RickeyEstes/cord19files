The 100 HCPs tested during the 2014 winter months consisted of 18 medical students, 33 nurses, 6 physicians, and 43 residents. The 100 HCPs tested during the 2014 summer months consisted of 16 medical students, 47 nurses, 5 physicians, and 32 residents. The 2 sample groups were nonoverlapping. Prior to the 4-week asymptomatic period, 34 of the 200 subjects had symptoms of a respiratory illness, and 14 of the 200 received antibiotic treatment. A more detailed description of the subject sample is shown in Table 2 . Figure 2 displays a summary of the respiratory pathogen detection percentage partitioned by profession and season. In the winter, residents represented the subset of HCPs with the largest frequency of colonization because 26 (60.5%) of the 43 were positive for at least 1 bacterial or nonbacterial pathogen. However, the highest proportion of viruses was seen in nurses because 7 (21.2%) of the 33 tested were detected with coronavirus. In the summer, as in winter, residents had the highest frequency of detection because 14 (43.8%) of the 32 tested were positive for at least 1 pathogen. Nurses exhibited a slightly lower level of colonization because 19 (46.3%) of the 41 had at least 1 pathogen detection. Figure 3 characterizes all of the HCPs in both seasons that had a codetection for 2 genetic targets. A larger number of subjects exhibited codetections during the winter because 12 (25.5%) of the 47 subjects were detected with 2 genetic targets. Of the 19 positive detections for MRSA, 4 (21.1%) were positive for the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) cytotoxin gene, which represented the highest frequency of simultaneously detected genetic targets. Eight (30.8%) of the 26 residents had >1 detection. In the summer, 1 resident had 3 bacterial detections, whereas no HCPs in the winter exhibited >2 detections. Supplemental Figures S1 and S2 display the detection percentage aggregated by sex and season and age groups and season, respectively. Men had a marginally higher frequency of detection because 16 (51.6%) of 31 in the winter and 19 (52.8%) of 36 in the summer had at least 1 pathogen detection. In the winter, the 30-40 years age bracket had the highest percentage of detection because 16 (55.2%) of the 29 HCPs tested were positive for at least 1 bacterium or virus. In the summer, 19 (52.8%) of 36 subjects in the 20-30 years age bracket had the largest percentage of pathogen detection. Figure 2 and Supplemental Figures S1 and S2 present data as a percentage of positive detection out of total tests given to a specific profession, sex, or age during each season. Supplemental Tables S1-S3 display the number of positive detections and number of tests given.
