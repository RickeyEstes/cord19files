From October 2009 to March 2015, 466 patients received RSV prophylaxis with palivizumab at six major pediatric cardiac centers in Korea. The mean age of patients at the start of prophylaxis was 2.9±2.8 months (range, 0-11.2 months), and the mean follow-up period was 24.3±16.4 months. The male to female ratio was 1.03 (male:female=237:229). The main indication for RSV prophylaxis in this study was moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension (n=213; 45.7%), followed by cyanotic heart disease (n=196; 42.1%) and CHF requiring medication (n=115; 24.7%). A total of 4 patients (0.9%) (3 with HCM and 1 with mitral stenosis) had received RSV prophylaxis according to the clinician's recommendation, regardless of exclusive criteria of the Korean guideline of RSV prophylaxis for CHD patients. Co-morbidities other than CHD were found in 127 patients (27.3%): chromosomal anomalies were found in 65 (13.9%), low birth weight baby in 33 (7.1%), and prematurity in 35 patients (7.5%). Most patients (n=442; 94.8%) underwent either palliative or definitive cardiac surgery before (60.3%) and after (39.7%) the start of palivizumab vaccination. After cardiac surgery that involved cardiopulmonary bypass, 5 (1.1%) patients received one additional dose immediately postoperatively ( Table 2) . The mean number of received injections was of 3.7±1.9 per patient (range, 1-10). Only 146 patients (31%) received more than five injections following the guidelines, whereas the majority (n=320; 69%) received less than four injections, including 166 patients (36%) who received only one injection ( Fig. 1 ). Among the patients, 7 who had been born prematurely received palivizumab injections until they reached 2 years of age, according to the Korean guideline for prematurity. There were 182 patients (39%) who did not start the first injection of palivizumab at the recommended time -in the first October or the first month of life if the child was born during the RSV season -according to the guideline, with an average delay of 2.7±2.6 months (range, 1-4 months) (Figs. 1, 2, and 3). Among the 466 patients with CHD during the follow up period, 39% had no respiratory symptoms, 61% had respiratory symptoms. Of the patients having respiratory symptoms, 49% had non-RSV respiratory infections and 12% had RSV infection. Fiftyseven patients (12.2%) were hospitalized with breakthrough RSV bronchiolitis after prophylaxis. Other respiratory virus infections with rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, and Epstein-Barr virus affected 24 patients (42.1%). Prophylactically treated CHD patients (Table 3) . Three patients were hospitalized twice, once before and once after the 1-year-old check-up. Total of 5 patients were diagnosed as RSV infection after the first year follow-up, including these 3 patients. Comparison of mortality data between RSV infection and doses of palivizumab according to the structural type of CHD, revealed that one-third of the children (n=176; 37.7%) were classified as having shunt lesions with pulmonary hypertension. Among these, 24 patients (13.6%) were diagnosed with RSV infection. There were 7 in-hospital deaths of patients with shunt lesions, 3 of which were related to RSV infection. In the group of 59 patients (12.7%) with univentricular heart defects, there were 9 deaths, but none were treated for RSV infection. In addition, of the 2 deaths reported in this group, 1 was related to RSV infection. During follow-up, all-cause mortality was reported as 30 for this group (6.4%). In 19 patients who died from cardiac issues, 3 deaths were from early postoperative complications; 11 patients died from other morbidities, including 5 patients (1.1%) due to RSV infection (Table 4 ).
