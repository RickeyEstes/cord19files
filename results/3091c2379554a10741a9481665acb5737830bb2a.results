We found that OMs and AGMs were susceptible to infection by coronavirus JHM and SD with important differences between virus strains and primate species . Neutralizing antibody titers (50% neutralization of TCID50) of sera were determined before inoculation and 7, 14, 21, 35, 60, and 90 days postinoculation (DPI) or at time of sacrifice for each virus-infected and control animal, Neutralizing titers were not determined for two animals, K199 and K209, at the time of sacrifice (120 DPI) ; the last determination was performed 90 DPI for these two animals . The four OMs, inoculated with either JHM or SD, and two of the AGMs, K199 and K209, inoculated with SD and JHM, respectively, had detectable neutralizing antibody titers (Fig . 1) . The two OMs, K191 and K063, that received the brain passaged JHM, JHM OMpt, had negative antibody titers but these animals were sacrificed at only 10 and 12 DPI, respectively . All blood samples, drawn at 2, 7, 10, 14, 21, 35, and 60 DPI or at time of sacrifice, were negative for infectious virus ; CSF samples taken at time of sacrifice were negative for infectious virus . Only one animal, OM K177, receiving tissue culture passaged virus (JHM) had recoverable infectious virus in FIG. 1 . Neuralizing antibody titer of sera from MHV JHM and coronavirus SD-inoculated monkeys . The top and bottom panels show results from Owl monkeys (OM) and African green monkeys (AGM), respectively. Two animals from each species group were inoculated with either SD or JHM . Sera samples were taken on the days indicated ; dilutions that produced 50% neutralization of TCID 50 are shown . Values shown below a 1 :10 dilution are considered negative by this method ; all samples taken from animals before virus inoculation or taken from sham-inoculated animals during the course of this study were negative by this c riterion . O M K177 (upper panel) was sacrificed 35 days postinoculation when signs of neurological dysfunction became evident . Neutralizing titers for the two OMs that received the brain passaged virus, JHM OM p 1 (see text and Table ! ) , are not shown here ; both of these animals were seronegative by this method at time of sacrifice, the brain at the time of sacrifice . The two monkeys, OMs K191 and K063, inoculated with this brain passage isolate also had infectious virus in assayed brain tissue . Assays for viral RNA by PCR, Northern blot analysis orin situ hybridization and viral antigen by Western blot analysis, or immunohistochemical staining was done on extracted material or tissue sections utilizing frozen or formalin fixed tissue . Freezing or fixation of tissues was done immediately after each animal was sacrificed at the designated time point . The results of RNA and antigen detection for each animal is discussed below . Table 1 summarizes neutralizing antibody assays, results of virus isolation from blood, brain, or cerebral spinal fluid, viral RNA and antigen analysis, and pathology for each animal . Note that one animal, OM K185, that received coronavirus SD (Fig . 1) is not included in Table 1 ; this animal has not been sacrificed at this time . This animal also had no detectable virus in blood samples drawn at the times indicated above . Infection of Owl monkeys with MHV JHM JHM-infected OMs K177 and K070 were sacrificed 35 and 90 DPI, r espectively . O M K177 was sacrificed at this earlier time because of observed tremors . JHM caused an acute panencephalomyelitis with grey and white matter inflammation in both of these animals . Associated demyelination was observed by the luxolfast blue/periodic acid-Schiff staining method in areas of white matter inflammation . Phagocytic cells containing digested myelin were observed by electron microscopy in these areas of demyelination (Fig . 2H) ; recognizable virus was not seen by ultrastructure . Viral RNA and antigen were detected in both grey and white matter by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence, respectively . RNA extracted from OM K070 CNS was also assayed by PCR and the expected coronavirus specific amplified product was observed (Fig . 4C) . Virus was recovered from the brain of one OM (K177) infected with JHM . This isolate, designated JHM-OMp1, upon passage by IC inoculation into two naive and healthy OM (K063 and K191) caused severe disseminated encephalomyelitis by 10 to 12 DPI demonstrating rapid adaptation to the primate system ; these animals were sacrificed at this time due to clinical signs of disease . JHM virus could be recovered (designated JHM-OMp2) from the brains of both of these OMs and abundant amounts of viral products were demonstrable in the brains of both animals (Figs . 2A-2C, 3F, and 4A-4C) . JHM-OMp1 caused a shift toward more severe inflammatory changes in white matter areas (Figs . 3G and 3H) compared to the original JHMinfected OM .
