Analysis of all positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus plotted against monthly temperature and precipitation values reveals that the interquartile range of average environmental temperatures associated with positive cases so far is between -4,01ºC to 15,58ºC (99% range) and -2,04ºC to 9,49ºC (95% range). For precipitation, the interquartile range ranges from 4,68 mm to 116,06 mm (99% range) and 19,75 mm to 94,43 mm (95% range). These values are estimated taking into account total numbers of positive cases, which are obviously strongly determined by contingent factors linked with the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus outbreak (the city of Wuhan in China) and subsequent pattern of spread. While the pattern of spread is, as it seems based on our analysis, constrained by climate, the actual numbers of positive cases are affected by nonclimatic factors 14 , some of which might be stochastic. Less sensitive measurements can be obtained by using presence absence of positive cases. With such an approach, the estimated interquartile ranges for temperature is -18,10ºC to 28,64ºC (99% range) and -8,81ºC to 25,65ºC (95% range). For precipitation it is 1,00 mm to 345,55 mm range (99% range) and 2,16 mm to 151,31 mm (95% range). Regardless of the approach used to quantify the climate envelope of the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus, we are not characterizing the exact local temperature and precipitation conditions constraining the virus spread but rather determining the type of macro-climate conditions in the places where spreading is occurring. Nevertheless, regardless of whether we calculate environmental preferences of the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus using the total numbers of incidences or their presence and absence, it appears the virus favors cool and dry conditions being largely absent under extremely cold and very hot and wet conditions ( Figure 1 ). We summarized projections by ensembles of ecological niche models by climate zones 15 . The analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 strives in warm temperate climates between October to May and cold temperate climates between April and September ( Figure 2 ). Arid environments follow the temperate warm trend of seasonal probability of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus but with generally more moderate levels. Much of the tropics have low levels of climate suitability for spread of SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus owing to their high temperatures and precipitation (used here as a surrogate for humidity), followed by polar climates, where conditions of extreme cold temperatures seem to be beyond the virus critical minimum tolerance values. In most of such low climate suitability areas, human populations will likely be spared from outbreaks arising from local transmissions ( Figure 2 ). The analysis of risk provided at the climate zone level (Figure 2 ), masks the sharp seasonality and the fine-grained regional variation in risk that emerges when analyzing the patterns in geographical space ( Figure 3 ). From June to September, much of higher latitude regions of the southern hemisphere, like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, and Southern Africa will likely be become exposed to new outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. Models also project highest latitude regions of the northern hemisphere to be badly hit by the Coronavirus during this period, including Canada and Russia, but also the Scandinavian countries. High elevation areas in the Andes and the Himalayas share the same prospects. Concurrently, areas that, as we speak, are of extreme concern in the northern hemisphere (chiefly Italy, Spain, France, Germany, UK, and USA) should witness a reduction in the incidence of new positive cases SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus. Beyond September and until the end of May, conditions will be suitable for renewed outbreaks in much of warmer temperate regions of Asia, Europe and North America. .
