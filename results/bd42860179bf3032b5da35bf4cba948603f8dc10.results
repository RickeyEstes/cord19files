Three hundred and seventy-six titles were identified through the database search. Of the 85 articles assessed for inclusion after examining the abstracts, we excluded 30 articles, which belong to case reports, commentaries, views, reviews, studies on genetics, or duplicate studies. Fifty-five full-length articles were finally included in this review ( Figure 2 ). Articles relevant to infection dynamics and natural history, impact, or control are listed in Tables 1-3 , respectively. All of the studies were conducted by first authors whose primary affiliation was an institute in Hong Kong. All studies were supported by local funding, including 32 (58%) that were supported by the Research Fund for the Control of Infectious Diseases. In addition, 13 (24%) studies acknowledged funding from international sources.
