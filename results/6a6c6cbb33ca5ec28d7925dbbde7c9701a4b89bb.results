The results are shown in Table I . All four alcoholbased hand rubs led to inactivation of SARS-CoV to below the limit of detection (RFR4.3, SD 0.5 to R5.5, SD 0.5), irrespective of the presence and type of organic load, within 30 s (Table I ). The three surface disinfectants also inactivated SARS-CoV to below the limit of detection (RFR3.8, SD 0.7 to R6.1, SD 0.4) within 30 min. The same efficacy was seen with the instrument disinfectant at concentrations of 2% (60 min), 3% (30 min) and 4% (15 min), regardless of the type of organic load (Table I) . The mean RF with the instrument disinfectant was R3.3, SD 0.5, which is nearly tenfold below the results of the other disinfectants, due to initial virus titre which was tenfold lower. The results of the controls (data not presented) showed that the termination controls had nearly the same titre as the 'control titration'. This means that no postexposure disinfection effect could be seen. The incubation of SARS-CoV with 0.7% formaldehyde showed an RFR3, and the cytotoxicity controls indicated that the compounds are cytotoxic up to a dilution between 1:10 to 1:100, while 0.7% formaldehyde was cytotoxic up to a 1:10 000 dilution.
