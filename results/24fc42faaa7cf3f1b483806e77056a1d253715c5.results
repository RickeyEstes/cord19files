There were a total of 4,859,682 passenger and crew visits to Bridgetown Port and Cruise Terminal or through Barbadian territorial waters during the study period (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) . Passengers and crew arrived on a variety of vessels including, cruise ships, yachts, cargo vessels, tankers, fishing vessels, tugs and research vessels. Seventy percent (70 %) of the visits were by passengers, representing 3,424,324 visits. An overview of the total passengers and crew for the study period (2009-2013) is shown in Table 1 , including the last Port of Call for sick passengers. Over 50 % of sick passengers were aged over 60, with a median age over the study period of 64 years, while the sick crew were much younger with a median age of 31 years ( Table 2 ). The majority (73 %) of the sick crew were male, compared to 48 % in passengers. The overall event rate for communicable illnesses was 15.7 (95 % CIs 14.4-17.1) cases per 100,000 passengers whilst the overall event rate for crew was higher at 23.9 (21.6-26.7) cases per 100,000 (Tables 3 and 4 ). Gastroenteritis was the predominant illness experienced by passengers and crew, followed by influenza, and together these accounted for 87 % of all communicable disease events in crew and 93 % in passengers. . The rates of influenza recorded were higher (with non-overlapping 95 % confidence intervals) in the crew than the passengers and the rates of gastroenteritis were similar (with overlapping confidence intervals) in both groups. It is notable that 61.3 % of all communicable diseases in passengers and crew were accounted for by only ten of the vessels over the five year period (Table 5) , with one vessel contributing 27.5 % of all cases. The overall event rate for non-communicable illnesses was 3.4 (2.9-4.1) per 100,000 passengers with myocardial infarction being the main non communicable illness experienced by passengers. Twenty one passengers died during the five year period, all as a result of non-communicable illness. The overall event rate for noncommunicable illnesses among crew was 2.1 (1.5-3.0) per 100,000 with injuries accounting for the majority of illness in this category.
