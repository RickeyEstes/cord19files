Our study enrolled 53 patients with suspected NCP. Twenty patients were finally laboratoryconfirmed with NCP, among whom 14 patients were positive for the first admission SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR, 3 patients turned to positive in the second test after the first negative result. Three other patients were diagnosed through mNGS while both RT-PCR reported negative ( Figure 1 Abnormalities in chest CT images were detected among all patients. According to CT scan, 12 (60%) NCP patients showed bilateral pneumonia with just 8 (40%) patients showing unilateral pneumonia. Most non-NCP patients showed unilateral or bilateral patchy shadowing. TFour non-NCP and 2 NCP patients showed ground-glass opacity, respectively. CT image of other patients were subsegmental areas of consolidation. In our study, chest CT images of early stage NCP patients showed unilateral or bilateral ground glass opacity, which were similar to some non-NCP images of patients with RSV, mycoplasma and parainfluenza virus. The findings of progressive stage chest CT images were bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation ( Figure 2 ). According to the QIASTAT and metagenomic sequencing results, we found 11 co-infection cases among 20 NCP cases, including viruses such as influenza A/B, rhino/enterovirus, respiratory syncytial viral and etc., and other atypical pathogen, fungi and bacteria synchronously ( Figure 3 ). Among the 33 laboratory-confirmed non-NCP patients, QIASTAT and metagenomic sequencing reported positive in 7 and 23 patients, respectively. Pathogen distribution of non-NCP cases was shown in Figure 3 . Phylogenetic analysis was performed to investigate the genetic relationship between SARS-COV-2 and other pathogenic coronavirus, as well as the diversity among our SARS-COV-2 strains. Consistent with previous reports, SARS-COV-2 was identified as a new species that's most similar to SARS-CoV. The SARS-COV-2 strains sequenced in our cases were highly conserved with the original Wuhan strain. Genetic variations were further analyzed in 10 cases with sufficient coverage and depth of the N gene. Among which, only one single nucleotide mutation (g605a) was identified in two of the samples which resulted in a non-synonymous S203N change in the N gene, suggesting a relatively low level of genetic polymorphism in our SARS-COV-2 cases (Figure 4 ).
