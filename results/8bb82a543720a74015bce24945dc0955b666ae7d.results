In Wuhan, COVID-19 accounted for a total of 32,486 ICU-days and 176,136 serious-inpatientdays between January 10 and February 29 (Figure 1) , an average of 637 ICU patients and 3,454 serious inpatients on each day over that 51-day period. During the peak of the epidemic from mid to late February, a maximum of 19,425 patients (24.5 per 10,000 adults) were hospitalized, 9,689 patients (12.2 per 10,000 adults) were considered to be in "serious" condition, and 2,087 patients (2.6 per 10,000 adults) needed critical care per day. In Guangzhou, COVID-19 accounted for a total of 318 ICU-days and 724 inpatient-days between January 24 and February 29 (Figure 2) , an average of 9 ICU patients and 20 inpatients during that 37-day period. During the peak of the epidemic (early February), 15 patients were in critical condition, while 38 were hospitalized and classified as serious. Unlike Wuhan, where patients with mild COVID-19 disease were isolated in quarantine centers and not in designated hospitals, all confirmed patients in Guangzhou were hospitalized until cure. The maximum number of hospitalizations in Guangzhou on any day was 271 patients. The projected number of prevalent critically ill patients at the peak of a Wuhan-like outbreak in US cities ranges from 2.1 to 4.0 per 10,000 adults when we took into account of the difference in age distribution (Figure 3, top) , and from 2.6 to 4.9 per 10,000 adults when we took into account of the differences in comorbidity (hypertension) prevalence (Figure 3, bottom) .
