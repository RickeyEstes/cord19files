The chemical structure of MU314 is shown in Fig. 1 . This compound has a favorable balance of lipophilic and hydrophilic properties and benzo[b]furan derivatives with fused aromatic rings that exhibit certain unique The area of the lacunae was calculated using image analysis software (Photoshop; Adobe) and osteoclastic bone resorption was estimated as a percentage of the Control. The average of the area of the lacunae on the plate and its standard error in the Control were 0.58 and 0.077 mm 2 , respectively (n = 5). *P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01 indicate significant differences against Controls. ## P < 0.01, against the E2 group; aa P < 0.01, against the MU314 group. bioactivities such as anti-human coronavirus activity and inhibition of ICAM-1 expression (13, 14) . By day 7, osteoclast-like multi-nuclear giant cells were observed in cultured bone marrow cells treated with RANKL and M-CSF ( Fig. 2A) and a number of lacunae, which were believed to be excavated by the osteoclastlike multi-nuclear giant cells, were seen on the surface of the mineralized calcium phosphate thin film coated on the culture vessel (Fig. 2B ). E 2 (10 nΜ) and MU314 (10 nM) suppressed the formation of lacunae (Fig. 2C) . ICI-182,780 (10 nM) (15) inhibited the suppressive effect of MU314 on lacunae formation by the osteoclast-like multi-nuclear giant cells (Fig. 2C) . ICI-182,780 exerted similar antagonistic effects on the suppressive effects of E 2 (Fig. 2C) . Nine weeks post-OVX, the BMC of the proximal ends of tibiae were significantly diminished (14%). E 2 (100 μg/kg, s.c.) prevented the OVX-induced decline of BMC (Fig. 3C) . MU314 (100 μg/kg, s.c.) also significantly inhibited OVX-induced osteopenia (Fig. 3C) . The changes in BMD correlated with those in BMC (Fig.  3D) . The decrease in BMC and BMD by OVX was not detected in the entire tibia (Fig. 3: A and B) . Observations of undecalcified bone sections indicated that cancellous bone volume was decreased and the trabecular structure of cancellous bone disappeared in the proximal tibiae of the metaphysis post-OVX (Fig. 4) . E 2 and MU314 suppressed OVX-induced decreases in cancellous bone volume and the destruction of trabecular structure (Fig. 4) . OVX significantly decreased the fracture load of the femoral neck, and E 2 completely prevented this decline (Fig. 5A) . MU314, even at a low dose, protected against the decrease of mechanical strength in the femoral neck as potently as E 2 (Fig. 5A) . The change in fracture energy of the femoral neck was similar to that of the fracture load, but no significant change was observed (Fig. 5B ) between the sham and OVX groups. The three-point bending test of the femoral shaft failed to detect OVXinduced loss of mechanical strength (Fig. 5: C and D) . Because of E 2 administration, the OVX-induced decrease in uterine weight was completely prevented (Fig.  6A) , whereas MU314 had no effect on OVX-induced uterine atrophy (Fig. 6A) . Histological examination of paraffin sections showed the endometrial dystrophy caused by OVX, whereas E 2 had a potent hypertrophic effect (Fig. 6B) . In contrast, MU314 did not have an E 2like stimulating effect on the endometrium (Fig. 6B ) .
