Overall structure of PmDAP IV. The PmDAP IV enzyme forms a homodimer, with each subunit consisting of 724 residues (Ala22-Pro745) and a molecular weight of approximately 160 kDa (Fig. 1A) . The N-terminal region of PmDAP IV has a typical signal sequence of gram-negative bacteria and hence PmDAP IV exists as a soluble form in the periplasm 11 , while the mammalian DPP IV and FAP are type II transmembrane proteins 25 . The crystal structures of PmDAP IV in the ligand-free form and in complexes with dipeptides (Lys-Pro or Ile-Pro) and a non-peptidyl inhibitor (Inhibitor-1c) were determined at resolutions of 2.47, 1.90, 2.44 and 2.13 Å, respectively (Tables 1 and 2 ). Representative electron density maps of the bound peptides and inhibitor are shown in Figure S1 . The electron densities of the P2 side chains (Lys and Ile) are poorer than the P1-Pro residue covalently attached to the Oγ atom of Ser613 (Figures S1A and S1C). These are consistent with the results of refinement that the temperature factors of the bound ligand atoms are higher for some flexible groups away from the acyl-intermediate bond. This is also true for the inhibitor complex ( Figure S1D ). In the present crystal structure analysis of the ligand-free PmDAP IV, the asymmetric unit comprises two dimers of PmDAP IV. Dimerisation is also observed in the crystal structure of mammalian DPP IVs [31] [32] [33] [34] . The protruding anti-parallel β-sheet dimerisation interface reported for mammalian DPP IVs is also observed for PmDAP IV. This type of inter-subunit interaction has been found among several crystal forms of PmDAP IV (Table 1) , indicating that such dimer formation is the natural state of PmDAP IV. The protomer of PmDAP IV consists of two domains separated by a deep cleft (Fig. 1B) . One domain, containing the α/β hydrolase fold harbouring the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad, is responsible for catalysis; the second, β-propeller domain is the regulatory domain that is necessary for exopeptidase activity. A topology diagram of the PmDAP IV protomer is shown in Figure S2 . Catalytic domain. The catalytic domain includes residues 22-33 and 474-745, and forms an α/β hydrolase fold comprising a central eight-stranded β-sheet sandwiched by thirteen α-helices. The α/β hydrolase fold is characteristic of clan SC peptidases 2 , such as prolyl oligopeptidase (S9 family), carboxypeptidase Y (S10 family), Xaa-Pro dipeptidyl peptidase (S15 family), Pro-Xaa carboxypeptidase (S28 family), and prolyl aminopeptidase (S33 family). The catalytic domain of human DPP IV can be superimposed onto that of PmDAP IV (Fig. 2) . The serine peptidase catalytic triads 41 , His721, Asp689 and Ser613 in PmDAP IV and His740, Asp708 and Ser630 in human DPP IV, are almost completely superimposable, with a root mean square (rms) deviation between the two structures of 0.95 Å for 212 structurally equivalent Cα atoms, which had 31% sequence identity for that region. Similarly, the rms deviation between the catalytic domains of PmDAP IV and SmDAP IV is 0.60 Å for 264 structurally equivalent Cα atoms, which had 77% sequence identity for that region. The β-propeller domain. The β-propeller domain forms a funnel-shaped structure comprising eight blades, each of which comprises four anti-parallel β-strands, except for blade 4 (Figs 3 and S2 ), which contains two additional components. One is a short helix between the first and second strands of blade 4. This helix Figure 1 . Three-dimensional structure of PmDAP IV. The catalytic domain is coloured in magenta. The β-propeller domain is coloured from purple (blade-1) to red (blade-8). A long insertion containing Arg106 located between blade-1 and blade-2, which was disordered in the ligand-free form, is shown in gold. (A) Dimeric structure of PmDAP IV. (B) PmDAP IV subunit. The catalytic triad "Ser613, Asp689, and His721", the double-Glu motif "Glu208-Glu209", Arg106 located between blade-1 and blade-2, a bound inhibitor molecule, and blades 1 to 4 are labelled. Scientific REPORTS | (2018) 8:2714 | DOI: 10 .1038/s41598-018-21056-y contains a double-Glu motif, Glu208-Glu209, which forms salt bridges to the N-terminus of a peptide substrate (Fig. 3A) . The other additional component in blade 4 is a protruding anti-parallel β-sheet between the second and third strands of blade 4 ( Figure S2 ). The anti-parallel β-sheet acts as a dimerisation interface (Fig. 1A) . A hairpin loop between the second and third strands of blade 2 containing Arg125 in human DPP IV, which can interact with the carbonyl group of a substrate peptide 33, 34 , is replaced by a short turn in PmDAP IV (Fig. 3B) . Interestingly, however, the side chain of Arg106 (located between blades 1 and 2 in PmDAP IV), which was disordered in the ligand-free form but was well defined in the peptide/inhibitor complexes (described later), appears to play a role equivalent to that of Arg125 in human DPP IV (Fig. 3C ). Inter-domain contacts between the catalytic and β-propeller domains are observed for blades 4 to 8 of the β-propeller domain and the catalytic domain. Blades 1 to 3 of the β-propeller domain have less contact with the catalytic domain (Fig. 1B) and appear to be more flexible than blades 4 to 8. The rms deviation between the β-propeller domains of PmDAP IV and human DPP IV is 1.19 Å for 151 structurally equivalent Cα atoms, which had 19% sequence identity for that region, and the rms deviation between the β-propeller domains of PmDAP IV and SmDAP IV is 0.82 Å for 333 structurally equivalent Cα atoms, which had 73% sequence identity for that region. Thus, the structures of the β-propeller domains of PmDAP IV and SmDAP IV are somewhat different from that of the human enzyme. Conformational difference between the ligand-free and dipeptide/inhibitor-bound forms. A comparison of the crystal structure of the ligand-free PmDAP IV with those of dipeptide/inhibitor-bound forms of PmDAP IV showed that the large cleft between the catalytic and β-propeller domains was relatively closed for the peptide/inhibitor-bound forms (Fig. 4) . Larger conformational differences were observed mainly for blades 1 and 2 and the β-hairpin region of a protruding anti-parallel β-sheet between the second and third strands of blade 4. The closed conformation was observed for all crystallographically independent subunits of the dipeptide/ inhibitor-bound complex crystals, in which the asymmetric units of the dipeptide and inhibitor complex crystals contain two and one dimer(s) of PmDAP IV, respectively (Table 1) . Furthermore, the disordered loop region in the ligand-free form (residues 90-109 containing Arg106; Fig. 4 ) was well defined and formed a short helix in the dipeptide/inhibitor-bound complexes ( Figure S3 ). Interestingly, one of the four subunits in the asymmetric unit of the ligand-free form exhibited a relatively closed form, similar to those observed for the dipeptide/ inhibitor-bound forms, and the disordered loop region (residues 90-109) was well defined. IV with the tripeptide Lys-Pro-Tyr. Clear continuous electron density was observed for the first two residues of the tripeptide ( Figure S1A ), and no clear electron density was observed for the last residue, Tyr. Because the PmDAP IV enzyme reaction occurs in the solution used for crystallisation, the Lys-Pro-Tyr tripeptide acts as the substrate, and the reaction products are the N-terminal Lys-Pro (P2-P1) and the C-terminal Tyr (P1′). While the N-terminal product Lys-Pro remains at the active site, the C-terminal product Tyr dissociates from the active site. Interestingly, we observed that the tripeptide was cleaved but remained trapped as an acyl-enzyme intermediate. dipeptide and the Oγ atom of Ser613 were omitted from the model, and the structure was refined. The resultant omit electron density maps showed continuous electron density between the Oγ atom of Ser613 and the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond ( Figure S1A ). The asymmetric unit was composed of four independent PmDAP IV subunits; in three of the four subunits, the dipeptides were trapped as the acyl-enzyme intermediate, and in the remaining subunit, the hydrolysed dipeptide product (NH 2 -Lys-Pro-COOH) was observed ( Figure S1B ). Similarly, co-crystallisation of PmDAP IV with the tripeptide Ile-Pro-Ile, a well-known peptidyl DPP IV inhibitor, diprotin A 42,43 , resulted in the dipeptide Ile-Pro complex being trapped as an acyl-enzyme intermediate ( Figure S1C ). In the Ile-Pro complex, acyl-enzyme intermediates were observed for all four subunits in the asymmetric unit. Dipeptide complex. The dipeptide (Lys-Pro or Ile-Pro) complex structures clearly show the molecular basis for the peptide recognition mechanism of PmDAP IV. For simplicity, the following description refers primarily to subunit A of the 1.90-Å-resolution structure of the Lys-Pro complex of PmDAP IV. The bound dipeptide was found in the inter-domain cleft (Fig. 5A ). PmDAP IV hydrolyses peptides from the N-terminus of oligopeptides, cleaving dipeptide units (NH 2 -P2-P1-COOH) when the second P1 residue is Pro or Ala. To act as dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, PmDAP IV must fix the N-terminus of the substrate peptide in position. This task is performed primarily by the side chains of a double-Glu motif (Glu208-Glu209), which forms part of a short helix between the first and second strands of blade 4 of the β-propeller domain. The double-Glu motif forms salt bridges to the N-terminus of the bound dipeptide. In addition, the side chain of Arg106, which is located between blades 1 and 2 of the β-propeller domain, forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the P2 residue and also forms a salt bridge with the side chain of Glu208. The side chain of Asn691 also forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of the P2 residue. In the ligand-free form of PmDAP IV, residues 90-109, which are located between blades 1 and 2 of the β-propeller domain, were disordered. The corresponding region in SmDAP IV is also disordered 37 . In the dipeptide complex of PmDAP IV, the electron density of residues 90-109 was well defined and was interpreted as a short helix ( Figure S3 ). The P1 Pro residue is accommodated in the S1 pocket, which comprises the side chains of Asn614, Val639, Trp642, Tyr645, Tyr649 and Val692. The side chain of the P2 Lys residue has less interaction with PmDAP IV and is surrounded by water molecules in the active site cleft. The carbonyl oxygen of the P1 residue is accommodated in the oxyanion hole and stabilised by hydrogen bonds with the main-chain imino group of Asn614 and the side-chain OH group of Tyr527. Similarly, an important role of the oxyanion hole (comprising the main-chain NH of Tyr631 and the side-chain OH of Tyr547) in the catalytic mechanism of human DPP IV has been reported 44 . Inhibitor complex. In addition to the dipeptide complex described above, a non-peptidyl inhibitor complex also shows the structural feature of the active site of PmDAP IV (Fig. 5B ). The inhibitor used in this study is "Inhibitor-1c", 1-({[1-(hydroxymethyl)cyclopentyl]amino}-acetyl)pyrrolidine-2,5-cis-dicarbonitrile, which is known to be an achiral inhibitor of mammalian DPP IV 45 and is commercially available as a hydrochloride salt ( Figure S4 ). The unbiased omit electron density map ( Figure S1D ) suggested that one nitrile group of the inhibitor is attacked by Ser613 to form a covalent bond. A similar covalent bond is also reported for the crystal structure analysis of human DPP IV in a complex with Inhibitor-1c, and imidate formation is confirmed by 13 C-NMR 45 . The triple bond moiety of the other nitrile group stacks with the side chain of Tyr649. The pyrrolidine ring is accommodated in the S1 pocket (Asn614, Val639, Trp642, Tyr645, Tyr649 and Val692). The inhibitor moiety corresponding to a peptide P2 backbone is recognised by interactions from the side chains of Glu208 and Glu209 to the secondary amine group and from the side chains of Arg106 and Asn691 to the carbonyl group. The cyclopentane ring of the inhibitor has less contact with the active site, and this finding is consistent with the poorer electron density observed for the cyclopentane moiety compared with the pyrrolidine ring moiety ( Figure S1D ).
