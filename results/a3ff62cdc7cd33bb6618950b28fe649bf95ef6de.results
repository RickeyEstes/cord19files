Of 1537 patients enrolled from September 2009-May 2014, 43 (2Á8%) were positive for adenovirus. Cases occurred from November to June, with the highest (32Á6%) number of cases occurring in the month of January ( Figure 1 ). The majority (75%) of cases were <18 years; 60% were <5 years (Table 1) . Fifty-one percent were male. Three cases were enrolled as inpatients. There were no deaths. Baseline symptoms were generally mild and most commonly included cough (90%), fatigue (79%), rhinorrhea (74%), loss of appetite (71%), and sore throat (64%). Adenovirus species and serotype information was available for 34 (79Á1%) cases. Adenovirus species C was most common (n = 21; 63Á6%), followed by B/3 (n = 9; 27Á3%), and one each of A, D/46, and E/4a. One patient was positive for C and E/4a. Species C was more frequent among participants <18 years (Table 1 ). There were no other significant differences in participant characteristics with respect to the distribution of C and non-C adenovirus species. Among all cases, 22 (51Á2%) were positive for another respiratory virus, including influenza (n = 7; 31Á8%), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 6; 27Á3%), rhinovirus (n = 6; 27Á3%), and coronavirus (n = 5; 22Á7%). The proportion of cases with a codetected respiratory virus was highest among children 5-17 years (66Á7%) and children <5 years (57Á7%), as compared to 27Á3% of adults ( Table 2 ). The prevalence of viral codetection did not significantly differ between individuals with species B versus species C adenovirus infection (33Á3% versus 66Á7%, respectively; P = 0Á123). When serotype C and non-C adenovirus infections were compared, several associations were noted (Table 3) . First, adenovirus C was more common among children (P < 0Á01). Non-type C-infected patients had more severe sore throat compared to type C (median score of 3 versus 0; Table 4 ). The frequency and severity of headache, joint pain, and muscle aches was higher among those with non-C adenovirus infections. Moreover, the composite systemic symptom score was higher among those with non-C adenovirus infection (P = 0Á03). Symptom data were recorded for 42%, 47%, and 63% of participants on days 3, 7, and 28, respectively. Analyses of symptom data showed the persistence of some symptoms through day 7, with resolution of virtually all symptoms by day 28 (Table 4 ). It is worth noting that most patients experienced cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, loss of appetite, or fatigue at the onset of infection, with rhinorrhea and fatigue being the most severe symptom reported. The median scores for all other symptoms were 0 at enrollment. By day 3, the overall severity of most symptoms declined, with the exception of cough, which increased to moderate severity from mild at baseline. By day 7, the only reported symptoms were cough and rhinorrhea. By day 28, all of the symptoms had resolved.
