A total of 94,683 people requested pre-travel medical advice at the IVCMa between January 2000 and December 2017. Table 1 shows the annual distribution of the number of TAs, the Seasonal variation was observed when analyzing the number of TAs per month during the study period. The months of June and July had the highest numbers of traveler consultations (Fig 2) . The monthly distribution of TAs was similar throughout the study and showed no significant differences across the years. Between 2005 and 2017, TAs requested pre-travel health information on 120 different countries, although 50% of the consultations were about just 13 countries (Fig 3) . Most pretravel consultations (97%) concerned countries categorized as posing a health risk, while the remainder (3%) regarded countries deemed to pose no health risk (Australia, Canada, European countries including Russia, Japan and New Zealand). Thailand, India and Brazil were the three countries on which the most pre-travel information was requested, with 21,229 queries (21% of all consultations) in the 13 years recorded. Over this period, only India and Thailand remained among the four most visited countries during all the years. However, in the final 3 years, demand for pre-travel information to WHO Southeast Asia Region countries underwent a conspicuous increase; Thailand, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia accounted for more than 32% of TA destinations between 2015 and 2017. Throughout the years studied, most of the countries had regional or global challenges or crises of diverse nature and severity, which could account for the trend observed in the number of TAs. Table 2 shows a timeline of some of the main events affecting international travel between 2000 and 2017. A temporary association between lower TA numbers and terrorist attacks, health or financial crises, and environmental catastrophes can be observed. The chronology of other political, social, terrorist, climatic or natural disaster events that could also have been included in the number of traveler requests was taken into consideration and is discussed later.
