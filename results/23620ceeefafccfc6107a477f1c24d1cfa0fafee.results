Intestinal sections used in this investigation were all histologically normal. The immunolabelled PCs showed a brown cytoplasmic staining. An immunohistochemical staining was also noted, mainly for anti-IgA and anti-IgM stains, on the luminal side of the crypt epithelium (Fig. 2) . The mucosal IgA-, IgG-and IgM-containing PC density, singularly considered, did not evidenced differences between the areas, tracts and groups and were pooled in the comparisons. Considering the sum of all isotypes, the mucosal PC density showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) from the upper (villus) to the lower part of the crypts ("vertical gradient") (Fig. 3) . In the duodenum the concentration is significantly lower (p < 0.05) in area 1 compared to area 2 or 3 but not between area 2 and 3. In the other two intestinal tracts, the concentration is significantly lower (p < 0.05) in area 1 than in area 2 and in area 2 than in area 3. Data on the single values in the different tracts and areas are reported in Table 2 . The mucosal IgA-, IgG-and IgM-containing PC density, considering the sum of all isotypes, does not appeared significantly influenced by vaccination, sampling time, and the vaccination*sampling time interaction term (p > 0.05). A significant (p < 0.05) decreasing trend in IgA-, IgGand IgM-containing PC density was instead identified from upper to lower intestinal tract ("horizontal gradient") ( Fig. 3) : in the duodenum the concentration is significantly (p < 0.001) higher than in jejunum and in ileum. No statistically significant difference was observed between jejunum and ileum. Also in this case, IgA-, IgG-and IgM-containing PC density, considering the sum of all isotypes, does not appeared significantly influenced by vaccination, sampling time, and the vaccination*sampling time interaction term (p > 0.05). The IgA-producing PCs were the most numerous, followed by IgG-producing PCs and finally by IgM-bearing PCs ( Table 2) . The sandwich immunohistochemical technique successful identified the PCs containing PCV2-specific Ig whose cytoplasm appeared intensely and homogeneously brown-stained, while the signal was absent when the sandwich stain lacked the viral suspension or the primary antibody step (Fig. 4) . Macrophages (Fig. 4) , endothelial cells and occasionally the luminal epithelium of the crypts were also immunostained by the sandwich method. The counts on the sandwich immunohistochemically stained sections, conducted including only the positive (anti-PCV2bearing) PCs, identified both the "vertical" and "horizontal" gradients ( Fig. 3; Table 2 ). The density of PCV2-specific PCs appeared significantly (p < 0.05) influenced by vaccination in duodenum but not in jejunum and in ileum; PCV2-specific PCs density, did not appear significantly influenced by sampling time, and the vaccination*sampling time interaction term (p > 0.05). A remarkably different profile was observed in the density of PCV2-specific PCs of the lamina propria between V and NV groups. In the NV group, no increase in anti-PCV2 antibody-bearing PCs was demonstrable over time: the means ± SD of lamina propria PCV2-specific PCs were very similar at 29 and 53 DPI (respectively: 10.55 ± 4.24 and 10.06 ± 5.01) and were not statistically different (t = 0.303, p = 0.76). Conversely, in the V group a significant increase in anti-PCV2-antibody bearing PCs was observed. The mean of lamina propria PCV2-specific antibody-producing PCs increased from 9.37 ± 13.36 at 29 DPI to 18.76 ± 15.83 at 53 DPI (M-W U = 71.00; p = 0.037).
