HAdV-52 Short Fiber Knob Binds to PolySia. We showed previously that the binding of HAdV-52 to human epithelial cells is sialic acid dependent and occurs via the SFK (23) . To date, the precise compositions and structures of glycans that can be optimally engaged by 52SFK remain unknown. We performed glycan microarray analysis of 52SFK with 128 different sialylated glycans, in an attempt to characterize the glycan receptor of HAdV-52. Very strong binding signals were observed with 52SFK for a group of linear α-2,8-linked oligoSia that represent fragments of naturally occurring polySia ( Fig. 1 and Table S1 ). The maximal response was observed at a degree of polymerization (DP) greater than 3 (DP5 to -9). This binding was much greater than for α-2,3and α-2,6-linked sialic acids in the array. The relatively weak binding detected with the probe oligoSia DP3 is likely to be due to the ring-opened status of the core monosaccharide as a consequence of the reductive amination procedure used for preparing the neoglycolipid probe (50) . This suggests that the high-affinity interaction with 52SFK requires at least three intact α-2,8-linked sialic acid residues. To confirm the ability of 52SFK to interact with polySia and to evaluate the specificity of this interaction, we developed an ELISA with immobilized, Escherichia coli-derived polySia (colominic acid; DP ∼ 80-100) and analyzed the binding of recombinant knob domains from HAdV-52 short fiber, the Sia-binding HAdV-37 fiber (37FK), and the CAR-binding HAdV-5 (5FK) and HAdV-52 long fiber (52LFK). The 52SFK bound efficiently to polySia, while the two CAR-binding FKs did not show any binding to this compound ( Fig. 2A) . 37FK, which binds with relatively high affinity to the branched, disialylated GD1a glycan using a different binding site (11, 23) , bound less strongly to polySia than 52SFK. We therefore conclude that HAdV-52 is able to interact preferentially Table S1 . The probes are arranged according to terminal sialic acid linkage, oligosaccharide backbone chain length, and sequence. The various types of terminal sialic acid linkages are indicated by the colored panels as defined at the Bottom of the figure. Numerical scores for the binding intensity are shown as means of fluorescence intensities of duplicate spots at 5 fmol/spot. Error bars represent one-half of the difference between the two values. The three probes that are most strongly bound are DP5-DP9 = α-2,8-linked sialic acids with a degree of polymerization (DP) between 5 and 9 (from Left to Right, in steps of 2).

HAdV-52 Binds to PolySia on Human PolySia-Expressing Cells. To test the relevance of polySia recognition by HAdV-52 in a cellular context, we used the human polySia-expressing neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y and its polySia-lacking parental cell line SK-N-SH as models for virus binding and infection (51) . The levels of polySia on these cells were confirmed by flow cytometry using the anti-polySia antibody mAb735 (Fig. S1 ). 52SFK gave five times higher binding signals with polySia-expressing SH-SY5Y cells compared with the control cell line, whereas none of the control knobs, including 37FK, showed a comparable interaction pattern (Fig. 2B ). Next, we used monosialic acid-binding lectins to evaluate the relative levels of glycans with terminal sialic acids on the two cell lines to exclude the possibility that the higher 52SFK binding to SH-SY5Y was due to a higher level of glycans with terminal monosialic acids on these cells rather than preferential binding to polySia. All three lectins tested, Maackia amurensis I and II (MAL I and II; binds to α-2,3-linked Sia), Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA; binds to α-2,6-linked Sia), and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; binds to terminal sialic acid as well as to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) bound stronger to SK-N-SH cells than to SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. S1 ), indicating that the parental, polySia-negative SK-N-SH cells have a higher total density of terminal sialic acids. Furthermore, preincubation of 52SFK with soluble oligoSia (DP5) reduced 52SFK binding to SH-SY5Y cells up to 75%, while no effect was observed on 37FK binding (Fig. 2C ). Preincubating the whole HAdV-52 virions with oligoSia (DP5) also efficiently reduced binding to and infection of SH-SY5Y cells, whereas sialic acid monosaccharide (DP1) did not have as much of an effect ( Fig. 3 A and C) . Neither of the two glycans tested reduced HAdV-5 binding to or infection of SH-SY5Y cells ( Fig. 3 B and D) . Based on these results, we conclude that HAdV-52 virions show a clear preference for polySia-expressing cells over cells lacking polySia, that this feature is not shared by monosialic acid-or CAR-binding HAdVs, and that the interactions with polySia are mediated by the 52SFK. PolySia Is Engaged at the Nonreducing End, Similarly to Monosialylated and Disialylated Glycans. Using 2-O-methyl-sialic acid as a ligand, we previously identified a sialic acid-binding site on the lateral side of 52SFK (23) . This binding site includes a stretch of three adjacent residues that together form a prominent RGN motif (R316-G317-N318). This site is located on a different part of the knob from the binding site of 37FK, which engages sialic acid near its threefold axis. The features responsible for the increased affinity for polySia are unknown, and it seems plausible that additional contacts or an additional epitope that went undetected in earlier studies are formed between 52SFK and polySia. Consequently, we solved the complex crystal structures of 52SFK with three oligoSia glycans (DP3, -4, or -5) as well as the GD3 glycan (Neu5-NAcα2,8Neu5NAcα2,3Galβ1,4Glc, representing a disialic acid motif). All complex structures produced similar results, as shown exemplary for DP3 in Fig. 4 . Surprisingly, well-defined electron density was found only for a single sialic acid moiety in the canonical binding pocket in all cases. The electron density around O8 and its direction relative to the protein clearly indicate that it is the nonreducing end of the glycan chain that is engaged, and the observed binding mode is identical to the one observed for monosialic acid. In all cases except for GD3, we observed additional electron density for a second sialic acid moiety projecting from the pocket toward the solvent. The overall density for this moiety is weaker, deteriorating from the glycerol group to the pyranose ring and indicating increased flexibility. All structures showed similar angles for the α-2,8-glycosidic linkage (Fig. S2) . Interestingly, the second sialic acid moiety does not seem to contribute any direct contacts in the overall interaction, except for a van der Waals contact between its N-acetyl group and E328. This contact seems to cause a local decrease of electron density and a slight rotation of the N-acetyl group. The third (and all following) sialic acids could not be unambiguously traced in any of the structures. To verify our observations in solution, we performed saturation transfer difference (STD)-NMR spectroscopy to screen for glycan protons of DP3 and DP5 that are consistently placed within 5-6 Å of the protein (shown exemplary for DP3 in Fig. 4 B and C) . The spectrum of the glycans alone compared well with the literature (52, 53) . Since all of the sialic acid repeats were in a highly similar chemical environment in solution, the respective peaks overlap-with the exception of the nonreducing end, which experiences an upfield shift. The experiment showed saturation transfer occurring almost exclusively at the nonreducing end, while the other moieties received only a very moderate spin saturation occurring exclusively in the N-acetyl group region, which is consistent with the contacts observed in the crystal structures. In the case of the R316A mutant, which disrupts the canonical RGN motif and prevents 52SFK attachment to sialic acid on A549 cells (23), saturation transfer was completely abrogated. Together, these results demonstrate that 52SFK engages polySia exclusively via its canonical sialic acid binding site, without any additional binding sites on the knob domain.
