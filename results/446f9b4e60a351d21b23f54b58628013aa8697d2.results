Demographic characteristics of participants. Overall, 1000 individuals from 1000 households were recruited, of whom 965 individuals were included in the final analysis ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). There was no statistical difference in gender between our sample and the central urban areas of Shanghai population (Shanghai census in 2017), but a statistical difference was found in terms of age (Supplementary Table S1 ). We found no difference in the age distribution and sex of participants between the participants recruited and the effective participants (Supplementary Table S2 ). characteristics of human-human and human-animal contact patterns. We recorded 18,116 contacts in total from 474 male respondents and 491 female respondents, including 6,953 (38.4%) individual contacts, 10,240 (56.5%) contacts reported as group contacts, and 923 (5.1%) contacts that people estimate they had left out (Supplementary Text S13; questions 17-18.) . The distribution of the number of contacts was highly right-skewed with a median of 10 contacts ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S3 ). Participants aged 7-19 years reported the greatest number of contacts. Similar distribution was found for the contact duration with a median of 15.7 hours ( Supplementary Fig. S5 for the estimating of the duration of group contact). The number of contact settings was also right-skewed with a median of two settings, and participants aged younger than 3 years had the www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ smallest number of settings. There was little difference in the number of contacts, duration, and the number of settings reported in terms of participant gender. More results about individual and group contacts are provided in Supplementary Text S8, Supplementary Fig. S6 , and Supplementary Table S3 . Physical contacts and other contact characteristics are described in Supplementary Figs S7 and S8 . Of the 965 respondents, 164 (17.0%) and 171 (17.7%), respectively, owned and had contact with at least one animal. Most of the reported animals were companion animals: 148 (15.3%) and 159 (16.5%) participants owned and had contact with pets (not including poultry or livestock), respectively, and most of which were dogs and cats. None of the participants reported owning poultry and only 0.2% of them had a contact with poultry. Only 0.1% of participants reported owning livestock, and none of them had contact with livestock (Supplementary Table S4 ). Only 3.52% of respondents owned animals but had no contact with animals on the assigned day, while 4.77% respondents had contact with animals that were not their own (Fig. 2A1 ). Respondents aged 0-35 months and those aged over 75 were least likely to own or have contact with animals, especially if they were male (Fig. 2A2) . More results about H-A contact patterns are described in Supplementary Text S9, Supplementary Tables S4 and  S5 and Supplementary Figs S9 and S10. Of the 965 respondents, 194 (20.1%) reported owning or having contact with animal(s). The characteristics of such participants interacting with animals and their H-H contact patterns are shown in Supplementary Table S6 and Supplementary Fig. S11 . Such participants had more social contacts (median: 16.5) and longer contact duration (median: 17.4), especially for children aged 3-6 and males aged 20-59, which motivated us to explore the interaction of H-H and H-A contact patterns. factors associated with human-human and human-animal contact patterns. Participants were matched for potential explanatory factors associated with number of contacts using propensity score matching (Supplementary Table S7 , Supplementary Fig. S12) , resulting in 772 matched respondents (386 for each mode of Table S8 ). The distribution of contact characteristics showed similar patterns as those before matching (Supplementary Fig. S13) . For the H-H contacts, we used matched data to fit GAMMs (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S9 ). In the final selected models, a significantly greater number of contacts was associated with telephone interview. Workdays, daily out-of-subdistrict travel, and animal owners were associated with a significantly greater number of contacts than weekends, not daily out-of-subdistrict travel, and not animal owners. We found a significant nonlinear www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ association between the number of contacts and the participant age, with the largest number of contacts in those aged 18. Telephone interview was associated with a significantly longer contact duration. Living in a household with more than 2 people and workdays were associated with a significantly longer contact duration. A similar nonlinear relationship was found between contact duration and participant age. We found no significant association between the number of settings and modes of data collection. Workdays and atypical days were associated with a significantly greater number of contact settings. The number of contact settings was also significantly associated nonlinearly with participant age, with a greatest number associated with ages 30-50 and a decline below or above that. More results about individual and group contact are given in Supplementary Fig. S14 For the H-A contacts, the number of social contacts was positively associated with the probability of having contact with animal(s), when controlling for the age and annual income of participants, with the largest probability associated with around 15 years and 60 years (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table S9 ). Participants reporting having www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ no income was significantly associated with the lowest probability of animal contact, while participants reporting an annual income of over $15k had the highest probability of animal contact. Similar results were found for animal ownership (Supplementary Fig. S15 ). Fig. S16 ), the degree of assortative mixing for the contact matrix of the number of contacts was calculated as q = 0.716 (bootstrapped 95%CI: (0.613, 0.779), self-reporting: 0.749 (0.611, 0.832), telephone interview: 0.568 (0.393, 0.744)), showing that the matrix was strongly assortative. With the smoothed matrices (Fig. 5) , the dominant feature was the strong diagonal element, indicating that participants in all age groups were inclined to mix assortatively by age, which was most pronounced in those aged 7-20, and least pronounced in those aged 25-55. Two parallel secondary diagonals starting around 30-40 for both contacts and participants were offset from the central diagonal likely capturing contacts that parents make with their children and vice versa. Compared to self-reporting, telephone interviewing was associated with a greater number of contacts for participants aged 20-60, but smaller for participants aged 3-20. The contact matrix of contact duration had a similar pattern to that of number of contacts. The estimating of the age of group contact is provided in Supplementary Fig. S5 . Contact matrices stratified by different characteristics are shown in Supplementary Figs S17 and S18.
