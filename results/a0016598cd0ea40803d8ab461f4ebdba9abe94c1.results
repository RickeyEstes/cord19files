The amount of information available translates into differences mostly between the break-up rates of links that may involve a potential risk for further infection (b SI , b IR , b II ), and those that do not (b SS , b SR , b RR ). Therefore, we consider one particular rate b I for links involving infected individuals (b I :b SI~bIR~bII ), and another one, b H , for links connecting healthy individuals (b H :b SS~bSR~bRR ). In general, one expects b I to be maximal when each individual has perfect information about the state of her neighbors and to be (minimal and) equal to b H when no information is available, turning the ratio between these two rates into a quantitative measure of the amount of information available or the efficiency of information use. Note that we reduce the model to two break-up rates in order to facilitate the discussion of the results. The general principles and conclusions remain valid when all break-up rates are incorporated explicitly. It is worth noticing that three out of these six rates are of particular importance for the overall disease dynamics: b SS , b SR and b SI . These three rates, combined with the rate c of creating new links, define the fraction of active SS, SR and SI links, and subsequent correlations between individuals [44] , and therefore determine the probability for a susceptible to become infected (see Methods). This probability will increase when considering higher values of c (assuming b I .b H ). In other words, when individuals create new links more often, therefore increasing the likelihood of establishing connections to infected individuals (when present), they need to be better informed about the health state of their contacts in order to escape infection. In the fast linking limit, the other three break-up rates (b II , b IR and b RR ) influence disease progression since they contribute to altering the average degree of the network. In the Methods, we show that disease spreading in a quickly adapting network can be studied as if it took place in a well-mixed population with same average degree SkT as the original network and transmission probability l A . Since the lifetime of a link depends on its type, the average degree SkT of the network depends on the number of infected in the population, and hence becomes frequency (and time) dependent. Similarly, fast linking dynamics leads to a rescaling of the transmission probability, l?l A~g{1 l, with g depending on the particular model of disease spreading. In the SIR model, g is given by where i denotes the number of infected individuals in the population and r the number of recovered (immune). The rescaling parameter g for the SI and SIS models is the same, but with r~0. Note that g scales linearly with the frequency of infected in the population, decreasing the more individuals get infected (assuming w SS =w SI w1), and depends implicitly (via the ratio w SS =w SI ) on the amount of information available. We would like to stress the distinction between the description of the disease dynamics at the local level and that at the population level. Strictly speaking, a dynamical network does not change the disease dynamics at the local level, meaning that infected individuals pass the disease to their neighbors with probability intrinsic to the disease itself. At the population level, on the other hand, disease progression proceeds as if the infectiousness of the disease effectively changes, as a result of the network dynamics. Hence, analyzing an adaptive network scenario at a population level can be achieved via a correction on the transmission probability, keeping the mathematically more attractive wellmixed scenario. In this sense, from a well-mixed perspective, dynamical networks contribute to change the effective infectiousness of the disease, which becomes frequency and information dependent. One can define a gradient of infection G, which measures the tendency of the disease to either expand or shrink in a population with given configuration (defined by the number of individuals in each of the states S, I and R). For the SIS model, eradication of the disease is favored (G(i),0), irrespective of the fraction of infected, whenever R A 0 : l d Nw SI v1 (see Eq. 35 in Text S1), indicating how the presence of information (b H ,b I ) changes the basic reproductive ratio. This is illustrated in the upper panel of Figure 1 , which depicts G for different values of b I (assuming b H ƒb I ) and a fixed transmission probability l. The corresponding quasi-stationary distributions, which characterize the relative time the population spends in each configuration (and defined in Methods), are shown in the lower panel and clearly reflect the sign of G. Whenever G(i) is positive (negative), the dynamics will act to increase (decrease), on average, the number of infected. Figure 1 indicates how the availability of local yet reliable information hinders disease progression: For b I~0 :75 the interior root of G(i) disappears, making disease expansion unlikely in any configuration of the population. The analysis of the gradient of infection of the SIS model has the natural advantage of showing the effect of adaptive networks in a one-dimensional simplex (the fraction of infected). Yet, an analogous result holds for the SIR model. The gradient of infection now also depends on the number of recovered (r) individuals in the population and, once again, allows us to identify when disease expansion will be favored or not. Figure 2 gives a complete picture of the gradient of infection, using the appropriate simplex structure in which all points satisfy the relation i+r+s = N. The dashed red line indicates where G i,r ð Þ~0 in case individuals do not have any information about the health status of their contacts, i.e., links that involve infected individuals disappear at the same rate as those that do not (b I~bH ). Disease expansion is more likely than disease contraction (G i,r ð Þw0) when the population is in a configuration above the line, and less likely otherwise. Similarly, the solid blue line indicates where G i,r ð Þ~0 whenever individuals share information about their health status, and use it to avoid contact with infected. Once again, the availability of information modifies the disease dynamics, inhibiting disease progression for a broad range of configurations. Up to now we have assumed that the network dynamics proceeds much faster than disease spreading. This may not always be the case, and hence it is important to assess the domain of validity of this limit. In the following, we discuss the particular case of the SIS model. An analogous study for both SIR and SI yields qualitatively similar results, as discussed in the Text S1. Figure 3 shows the average SIT of the quasi-stationary distributions (circles) obtained via computer simulations (see Methods for details) as a function of the relative time scale t of network update (taking as unit time scale that associated with disease dynamics). Whenever t??, we can characterize the disease dynamics analytically, assuming a well-mixed population (complete graph), whereas for t?0 we recover the analytical results obtained in the fast linking limit. At intermediate time scales, Figure 3 shows that as long as t is smaller than 10, network dynamics contributes to inhibit disease spreading by effectively increasing the critical spreading rate. Overall, the validity of the time scale separation extends well beyond the limits one might anticipate based solely on the time separation ansatz. As long as the time scale for network update is smaller than the one for disease spreading (tv1), the analytical prediction for the limit t?0, indicated by the lower dashed line in Figure 3 , remains valid. The analytical result in the extreme opposite limit (t??), indicated by the upper dashed line in Figure 3 , holds as long as tw10 5 . Moreover, it is noteworthy that the network dynamics influences the disease dynamics both by reducing the frequency of interactions between susceptible and infected, but also by reducing the average degree of the network. These complementary effects are disentangled for intermediate regimes, in which the network dynamics is too slow to warrant sustained protection of susceptible individuals from contacts with infected, despite managing to reduce the average degree (shown by crosses). In fact, for tw10 the disease dynamics is mostly controlled by the average degree, as shown by the solid lines in Figure 3 . Here, the average stationary distribution was determined by replacing, in the analytic expression for static networks, SkT by the timedependent average connectivity SkT Ã computed numerically. Note that the specific behavior of SkT Ã shown in Figure 3 results from the frequency dependence of SkT. When b I wb H , the network will reshape into a configuration with smaller SkT as soon as the disease expansion occurs. For tv1, SkT Ã reflects the lifetime of SS links, as there are hardly any infected in the population. For 10 0 vtv10 3 , the network dynamics proceeds fast enough to reduce SkT, but too slowly to reach its full potential in hindering disease progression. Given the higher fraction of infected, and the fact that SI and II links have a shorter lifetime than SS links, the average degree drops when increasing t from 1 to 10 3 . Any further increase in t leads to a higher average degree, as the network approaches its static limit. Contrary to the deterministic SIS model, the stochastic nature of disease spreading in finite populations renders certain the probability that the disease disappears after some time. However, this result is of little relevance given the associated times required to reach the absorbing state (except, possibly, in very small communities). Indeed, the characteristic time scale of the dynamics plays a determinant role in the overall epidemiological process and constitutes a central issue in disease spreading. In the Text S1 we derive an analytical expression for the average recovery time (t i ) of a population with i infected individuals. Figure 4A shows the recovery time t 1 in adaptive networks for different levels of information, illustrating the spectacular effect brought about by the network dynamics on the recovery time. While on networks without information (b I = b H ) the recovery time rapidly increases with the rate of infection l, adding information moves the fraction of infected individuals rapidly to the absorbing state, and, therefore, to the disappearance of the disease. Moreover, as shown in the Text S1, the size of the population can have a profound effect on the recovery times. With increasing population size, the population spends most of the time in the vicinity of the state associated with the interior root of G(i). For large populations, this acts to reduce the intrinsic stochasticity of the dynamics, dictating a very slow extinction of the disease. When recovery from the disease is impossible, a situation captured by the SI model, the population will never become disease-free again once it acquires at least one infected individual. The Markov chain that represents such diseases therefore has another absorbing state, corresponding to networks where everyone has been infected, besides the previous one in which no one is infected. The time to reach this state again depends on the presence of information. When information prevails, susceptible individuals manage to resist infection for a long time, thereby delaying the rapid progression of the disease, as shown in the inset of Figure 4B . Naturally, the average number of generations needed to reach a fully infected population increases with the availability of information, as illustrated in the main panel of Figure 4B . Finally, in all models discussed here we also investigated the effect of allowing for different individual rates associated with the way each individual creates or destroys her social ties. Due to agestructure of most populations or intrinsic individual or cultural differences, some individuals will tend to react differently whenever they, or a contact, get infected [36, 38] . In the Text S1 we show that the disease spreading remains unaffected when individual rates (of seeking and removing links) are drawn from a normal distribution with variable variance, as long as the average value for the rate remains unchanged.
