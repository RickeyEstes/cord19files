This section first describes results from the infection risk modeling effort, followed by results from cost estimates and cost comparisons between filtration and outdoor air ventilation. Fig. 1 shows the predicted risk of infection by the influenza virus during an 8-h workday in the hypothetical office building with 25 occupants using a range of HVAC filters installed in the constant operation HVAC system. The central estimates represent risks predicted using Equation (2) with a quanta generation rate of 100 per hour and the mean assumption of viral particle size distributions from Table 2 . The error bars represent minimum and maximum risks predicted according to the range of assumptions for viral particle size distributions in Table 2 and infectious aerosol removal efficiencies in Table 4 (assuming the same quanta generation rate).
