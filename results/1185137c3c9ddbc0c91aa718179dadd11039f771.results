The S2′ site but not the S1/S2 site is universally required for MERS S-driven host cell entry. We first investigated whether the S1/S2, the cathepsin L and the S2′ cleavage sites (Fig. 1) were universally required for MERS-S-driven entry or were only required for entry into certain target cells. For this, we used a set of previously established S protein mutants 21,23 and a VSV-based pseudotyping system. Mutants SSVR and ASVA harbored an altered S1/S2 site, the alteration in mutant NYT was previously shown to abrogate S protein activation by cathepsin L 23 while mutant ASAA contained a mutated S2′ site (Fig. 1) . Moreover, in mutant ASVA + ASAA both the S1/S2 and the S2′ site were altered (Fig. 1) . We next employed a previously described VSV-based pseudotyping system 24 to investigate how the mutations introduced into MERS-S modulated viral entry. For this, we first analyzed S protein incorporation into VSV particles produced in 293T cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that all S protein mutants studied were efficiently incorporated into VSV particles, although some variation of incorporation efficiency was observed between experiments, and that mutation of the S1/S2 site largely abrogated proteolytic processing of the S protein in particle producing cells (Fig. 2) , as expected 14, 16, 21 . Next, we selected target cells for the analysis of MERS-S-driven entry. The human colon-derived cell line Caco-2, the human adrenal gland-derived cell line 293T (either untransfected or transfected to express high levels of DPP4) as well as the African green monkey kidney-derived cell line Vero E6 were chosen for analysis, since these cells were previously reported to be susceptible to MERS-S-driven entry and both Caco-2 and Vero E6 cells are known to allow amplification of authentic MERS-CoV 14, 15, 21, 23 . Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Caco-2, 293T and Vero E6 cells as well as human lung tissue, the natural target of MERS-CoV infection, revealed that Vero E6, 293T and lung tissue expressed roughly comparable amounts of DPP4 mRNA, while expression in Caco-2 cells was elevated (Fig. 3) . In contrast, appreciable levels of TMPRSS2 mRNA were only detected in Caco-2 cells and lung tissue (Fig. 3 ), in keeping with published data 10, 17 . Finally, mRNAs for cathepsin L as well as furin were readily detected in all cell lines tested and in lung tissue (Fig. 3) . Thus, the cell lines under study were all positive for the MERS-CoV receptor, DPP4, but expressed different proteases known to be used by MERS-S for activation while expression of all proteases was robust in lung tissue. All cell lines under study were readily susceptible to transduction by control particles bearing VSV-G and were largely refractory to transduction by particles bearing no viral glycoprotein (Fig. 4a,b) , as expected. Transduction mediated by wildtype MERS-S was comparable for Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells (~3 × 10 4 c.p.s.) and generally higher as compared to untransfected 293T cells (~10 3 c.p.s.) (Fig. 4a) . However, when 293T cells were previously transfected with expression plasmid for DPP4, transduction levels were as high as for Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells (Fig. 4a) . Transduction of target cells with particles bearing MERS-S revealed that alteration of the S1/S2 site markedly reduced entry into Caco-2 (approx. 12-15-fold reduction) but not 293T, 293T+DPP4 or Vero E6 cells (Fig. 4b) . In contrast, an intact S2′ site was universally required for S protein driven entry, although the effects observed upon transduction of Vero E6, 293T and 293T+DPP4 were less pronounced than those seen for Caco-2 The S1/S2 and S2′ site in MERS-S are processed by different proteases. We next determined whether the S1/S2 and the S2′ sites are cleaved by proteases exhibiting the same cleavage specificity or by enzymes that recognize different cleavage sites. Thus, both sites contain an RXXR motif, a prerequisite for cleavage by proprotein convertases, and could thus be processed by furin or related enzymes. Alternatively, these sites might be cleaved by proteases for which motifs encompassing a single arginine residue can be sufficient for cleavage, potentially cathepsin L and TMPRSS2. In order to discern between these two possibilities, we investigated entry driven by S protein mutants in which either one or both arginines were mutated. For this, we employed Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells as targets. Immunoblot revealed that all MERS-S mutants were efficiently incorporated into VSV particles ( Fig. 5a) and none of the mutations introduced into the S1/S2 site markedly reduced entry into Vero E6 cells (Fig. 5b ), in keeping with our findings stated above, although the 1.5-2.6-fold reduction observed in this set of experiments was statistically significant (note that the average of three experiments is shown in Fig. 4 while the average of nine experiments is shown in Fig. 5b ). In contrast, mutation of a single arginine within this site was sufficient to reduce entry into Caco-2 cells by 4.5 to 29.4-fold (Fig. 5b) , suggesting that the S1/S2 site is processed by a protease that depends on the presence of two arginines, like furin. Furthermore, the second but not the first arginine within the S2′ site was sufficient for efficient S protein-driven entry into Caco-2 cells while mutation of any single arginine at the S2′ site had only a minor, although statistically significant, effect on S protein-mediated transduction of Vero E6 cells (Fig. 5b) . These results suggest that in Caco-2 and Vero E6 cells the S2′ site is mainly processed by a protease that requires a single arginine at its cleavage site, likely TMPRSS2 (Caco-2, see below) and cathepsin L (Vero E6). An intact S2′ but not S1/S2 site is essential for MERS-S activation by TMPRSS2. Our analyses had so far suggested that cleavage at S1/S2 is required for robust MERS-S-driven entry into Caco-2 cells, which express TMPRSS2. Therefore, we next asked whether cleavage at this site is also required for S protein-driven entry into cells in which only the TMPRSS2-activation pathway is operative. For this, we blocked MERS-S-driven entry into 293T+DPP4 cells by the cathepsin L inhibitor MDL28170 and asked whether this blockade can be overcome by expression of TMPRSS2. Entry driven by MERS-S wt and all S protein variants with mutations in the S1/S2 site was inhibited at least 13.7-fold by MDL28170 treatment and entry driven by MERS-S wt was fully rescued by directed expression of TMPRSS2 in target cells (Fig. 6a) . Entry mediated by the S protein mutants with inactivated S1/S2 site was also rescued by TMPRSS2, although with reduced efficiency as compared to MERS-S wt (Fig. 6a) , indicating that precleavage at S1/S2 is not an absolute prerequisite for subsequent S protein activation by TMPRSS2. In contrast, mutation of the S2′ site abrogated MERS-S activation by TMPRSS2. Moreover, analysis of MERS-S cleavage in a cis setting (i.e. protease and S protein expressed in the same cell) showed that mutation of the S2′ site resulted in aberrant cleavage products as compared to MERS-S wt and S protein mutants with alterations in the S1/S2 site (Fig. 6b) . Finally, we asked whether the residual entry into the TMPRSS2 + Caco-2 cells observed upon mutation of the S1/S2 site was dependent on cathepsin L activity, as suggested by a previous study 16 , or was promoted by TMPRSS2. Preincubation of Caco-2 cells with protease inhibitors showed that entry driven by S proteins lacking an intact S1/S2 site was dependent on TMPRSS2 but not cathepsin L activity (Fig. 6c) , indicating a dominant role of TMPRSS2 in S protein-driven host cell entry into Caco-2 cells. In sum, our data suggests that an intact S1/S2 site promotes but is not essential for MERS-S-activation by TMPRSS2. Residual Vero E6 cell entry observed upon mutation of the S1/S2 and S2′ site is promoted by cathepsin L activity. We found that simultaneous inactivation of the S1/S2 and S2′ site markedly reduced entry into Caco-2 cells, which depends on TMPRSS2, but only modestly reduced S protein-driven into Vero E6 cells, which depends on cathepsin L activity (Fig. 4) . The latter finding raised the question whether the residual entry into Vero E6 cells was still dependent on cathepsin L activity. We addressed this question by analyzing transduction of Vero E6 cells which were preincubated with the cathepsin L inhibitor MDL28170 or the TMPRSS2 inhibitor camostat. Camostat did not reduce S protein-driven entry, as expected. In contrast, cell entry driven by all S proteins analyzed was comparably reduced upon MDL28170 treatment (Fig. 7) . Remarkably, the cathepsin L dependence was also observed for mutants in which the S2′ was inactivated, indicating that cathepsin L, unlike TMPRSS2, can employ auxiliary cleavage sites for S protein activation.
