Five hundred seventy-five treatment sessions were enrolled (288 on nebulizers, 287 on spacers). Table 2 shows the demographic characteristics of both groups. The nebulizer group had more male predominance (59%) compared to the spacer group (53%). The average age of the children was 66 months. Children in the nebulizer group were slightly older (mean age 52 months; range: 2e165 months) compared to the spacer group (mean age 40 months; range: 9e168 months). The prescribed medications were the following: albuterol (45%), ICS (20%), combinations (31%), ipratropium bromide (4%), and others (4%). In the nebulizer group, the mean time for treatment preparation was 2.05 min (95th% CI: 1.45e2.15 min), and the mean time for treatment delivery was 9.39 min (95th% CI: 9.06e10.12). In the MDI-spacer group, the mean time for treatment preparation was 0.3 min (95th% CI: 0.03e0.5 min), and the mean time for treatment delivery was 4.38 min (95th% CI: 4.2e4.56 min) (see Table 3 ). These results indicate that replacing nebulizers by MDI-spacers shortens the time for medication preparation time by 98% and delivery time by 48% (2 min difference for preparation time and 5 min for delivery time; p < 0.01). Caregivers mastered MDI-spacer use after an average of 2 supervised sessions. As a result, conversion to MDI-spacer will lead to more independent treatment administration by patients/caregivers. This can have a significant impact on resource utilization in organizations that mandate that all nebulizer sessions be supervised by a respiratory therapist. Patient satisfaction survey showed stable "very good" to "excellent" levels in both phases of the study. Medication cost reduction analysis showed that cost reduction per 100 doses as the following: 50% for albuterol, 30% for ipratropium bromide, and 87% for ICSs in favor of MDI-spacer (taking into account cost of medication, spacer, and nebulization kit).
