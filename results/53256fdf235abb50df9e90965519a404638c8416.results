From 24,606 patients who presented to our Emergency Department between April 1st 2014 and September 30th 2015 with respiratory complaints, 3148 were tested for MERS-CoV. From those who were screened, only 757 patients were admitted. Eighty one patients tested positive for MERS-CoV and the rest, 676 patients, repeatedly tested negative and were used to find matches to MERS-CoV cases. See Fig. 1 . We were able to match all but two of the confirmed MERS patients. For one of them we were only able to find one control, and for the other no match was found. This resulted in a total of 239 patients for analysis. Table 1 shows the characteristics of both the MERS-CoV infected group and the control group.
