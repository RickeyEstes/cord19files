Between 1998 and 2012, there were 521,064 septicemia-related ED visits, more than 50% of which were for men (53.1%, Table   1 ). Middle-aged patients (aged 40-64 years) and older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) made up 27.3% ( N = 142,166) and 49.7% ( N = 259,081) of the visits, respectively. Older patients (aged ≥ 65 years) were the predominant source population for the different calendar periods ( Table 1 ) . A predominance of male and elderly patients was consistently observed across the three calendar periods ( Table 1 ) . Overall, septicemia-related ED visits increased from 20,565 in 1998 to 43,957 in 2012, representing a total increase of 23,392 visits during the 15-year observation period. Note that septicemiarelated ED visits did not always increase throughout the study period (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) . The mean annual increment was 1670 visits, with an average annual growth rate of 8.3% (95% CI: -6.8-23.4%).The mean annual growth rate for male and female visits was 2.2% (95% CI: -13.4-17.7%) and 2.1% (95% CI: -13.0-16.7%), respectively, during the 15-year observation period. Only the 0-19 age group showed negative growth in septicemia-related ED visits; for the other three age groups, 20-39, 40-64, and ≥ 65 years, the mean annual growth rates for visits were 0.05% (95% CI: -28.2-28.2%), 3.4% (95% CI: -15.4-22.3%), and 4.1% (95% CI: -6.5-14.7%), respectively. In this study, the number of septicemia-related ED visits (count data) was estimated using the Poisson regression model. This means that the estimated coefficients of the segmented regression model were transformed; these results are presented in Table  2 . As shown in Table 2 , there was a significant change point for the intercepts (i.e., the level parameter) and a statistically significant overall trend in the number of patient visits ( P < 0.0 0 01). In particular, the level change in septicemia-related ED visits was significant for the 0-19 group as well as for middle-aged and older adult groups (for level change, both P < 0.0 0 01). Fig. 1 shows the fitted numbers of septicemia-related ED visits by age group across the three calendar periods. Both the observed and the model-based estimates are shown for comparison. Variation in the overall septicemia-related ED visits over the 15year period mainly resulted from the decreases observed in all age groups for 20 03-20 06 and the increases in the middle-aged and older adult groups between 2008 and 2012, whose upward trends appeared parallel to each other ( Fig. 1 ). Fig. 2 shows the significant estimated change points (for 2002 and 2007) for the two interventions (EGDT protocol and SSC education program). After comparing septicemia-related ED visits of the intervention period, there were one-to two-year lags in the effect of the intervention. Theoretically, the intervention effects might occur over several periods, which embed in rolling periods. To better quantify the early impact of the EGDT protocol and SSC education program, we additionally compared model-predicted ED visits with and without the intervention to confirm the intervention effects. In expressing the results of the segmented regression modeling, we either report the level and trend changes in ED visits following implementation of the EGDT protocol and SSC education program (see Table 2 ) or compare estimated numbers of ED visits in the post-intervention period when the intervention was implemented and when it was not (i.e., the counterfactual value). We considered the Poisson regression models for 2002 and 2007 to express the intervention effects, respectively. In practice, the intervention effect can be expressed as the absolute difference in predicted visits between when the intervention was implemented and the counterfactual value. Alternatively, we can present the ratio of the absolute difference value to the counterfactual value. We can express the ratio as a percentage increase or decrease by multiplying by 100. To estimate the intervention effect of the EGDT protocol, we used the following regression equation (the expected results are shown in Table 2 ): Chi-square tests of significance were used to examine differences in the distribution of sex, age during the entire study period. * Significant at the 0.05 level ( P -value < 0.0 0 01).
