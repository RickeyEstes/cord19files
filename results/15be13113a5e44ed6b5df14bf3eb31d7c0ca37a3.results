The classification model was established using the data that described the three vital signs from the 16 influenza virus-infected patients and the 22 healthy control subjects using multivariable logistic regression. The statistically significant model is shown below: where x 1 is the respiration rate, x 2 is the heart rate, and x 3 is the facial skin temperature. The derived logistic function, Z(x 1 ,x 2 ,x 3 ), was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The Z(x 1 ,x 2 ,x 3 ) value could be used to differentiate patients with influenza (Z ! 0) from healthy subjects (Z < 0). Figure 2 illustrates the discrimination results that were obtained by plotting the Z(x 1 ,x 2 ,x 3 ) values against the axillary temperatures of the two groups. Of the patients with influenza, 14 (red dots) are enclosed within the red ellipse and they had positive Z-values, and two patients had negative Z-values ( Figure 2 ). The 22 healthy control subjects (blue dots) enclosed within the blue ellipse had negative Z-values and none of the healthy subjects had a positive Z-value ( Figure 2) . Therefore, the sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV were 87.5%, 100%, 91.7%, and 100%, respectively. The fever-based screening, for which the cut-off value for the axillary temperature was set at 37.0 C, did not detect five influenza patients (false-negative). The sensitivity of the fever-based screening was 68.7%. Table 1 presents a more detailed comparison of the patients with influenza and the healthy control subjects. The influenza patients who had higher Z(x 1 ,x 2 ,x 3 ) values had more severe symptoms, namely higher body temperatures and more elevated heart and respiration rates. The classification model determined that some patients had influenza, even if they did not have a fever. The Z(x 1 ,x 2 ,x 3 ) values could be used to evaluate the severity of infections, and they could, therefore, support the clinical risk stratification of patients. The two influenza patients who were misclassified had negative Z-values because their vital signs were normal. The mean (SD) facial skin temperature of the influenza patients (36.4 (0.7) C) was 1.1 C higher than that of the healthy control subjects (35.3 (0.6) C). The mean (SD) heart rate of the influenza patients (86.7 (12.1) bpm) was 21.3 bpm faster than that of the healthy control subjects (65.5 (6.8) bpm). The respiration rate did not differ significantly between the influenza patients (19.8 (5) breaths/min) and the healthy control subjects (19.5 (5) breaths/ min) (Figure 3 ).
