Immunization with adenovirus carrying codonoptimized genes encoding HA induced neutralizing antibodies against H5N1 influenza viruses in rhesus macaques In general, immunization requires the collection and manipulation of the target pathogen to prepare related antigens for immunization. During a pandemic, the pathogen may not be available because of bio-safety, transportation, and technology, issues and even social or political barriers. Earlier studies by our lab and others [19] [20] [21] have shown that the adenovirusmediated delivery of antigens, including influenza HA, induces a robust antibody response within a short period after immunization. In this study, we first synthesized three hemagglutinin (HA) genes based on human codon usage for optimal expression in mammalian cells. Next, we constructed three recombinant replication-incompetent adenoviruses (Ad5), Ad5-HA(97HK), Ad5-HA(04VN), and Ad5-HA(06ZJ), carrying the full-length HA genes representing three different clades of H5N1 viruses, including the HAs of A/Hong Kong/482/97 (clade 0), A/Vietnam/1194/04 (clade 1), and A/Zhe Jiang/16/06 (clade 2), respectively. The adenoviral vector-mediated expression of the HA proteins was confirmed using Western blot analysis of Ad5-HA-infected HEK293 cell lysates, which revealed the expression of HA0 and its cleavage into HA1 and HA2 ( Figure  1a) . We immunized two rhesus macaques with a mixture of 1x10 11 viral particles of each Ad5-HA at weeks 0, 4, and 8 via intramuscular injection. At various intervals, the serum samples were collected for the detection of neutralizing antibodies against the different clades of H5N1 viruses. A microneutralization (MN) assay was used to monitor the kinetics of the neutralizing antibodies against recombinant influenza viruses carrying each of the three HA clades in the PR8 backbone, r97HKHA-PR8, r04VNHA-PR8, and r06ZJHA-PR8 influenza viruses, respectively. The neutralizing antibodies were detected at 2 weeks after the initial immunization, the levels were increased at 4 weeks and continued to increase at 6 weeks and 10 weeks following additional immunizations. The neutralizing antibodies were maintained at high levels for at least 22 weeks. The sera collected from the macaques from 2 to 22 weeks neutralized all three clades of the H5N1 recombinant viruses but not the H1N1 influenza virus PR8 (Figure 1b) . The Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of serum antibodies that bound the HA0, HA1, and HA2 of all three clades of the H5N1 viruses tested but not the H1N1 virus PR8 (Figure 1c) . These data demonstrated that the adenovirus-mediated expression of HA effectively elicited the production of neutralizing antibodies against HA proteins in rhesus macaques as early as two weeks after immunization.
