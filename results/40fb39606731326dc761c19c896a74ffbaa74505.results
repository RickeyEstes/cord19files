The SARS-CoV E protein forms Ca 2 þ permeable ion channels Previously, we reported that the SARS-CoV E protein forms channels that are moderately selective for cations in membranes mimicking the ERGIC/Golgi (Verdia-Baguena et al., , 2012, 2013). Within cells, the movement of different cations through the E protein pore should be dictated by their respective gradients. Ca 2þ possesses the highest asymmetrical distribution between the ER-Golgi lumen (hundred μM) and the cytoplasm (around 100 nM) (Zhou et al., 2009) , which should allow the flow of this cation through the E protein IC channel if it is permeable. To test whether this is the case, E protein ICs were first reconstituted in artificial neutral lipid membranes in order to exclude any effect coming from the lipid charge, using 100 mM CaCl 2 solutions. Current jumps corresponding to the assembly of channels in the lipid membrane were detected (Fig. 1A) . The most frequent current jump, representing the insertion of a single E protein IC in the lipid membrane, displayed an intensity of 7.272.4 pA. Interestingly, values multiple of 7.2 pA were also detected, corresponding to the insertion of two (14.4 pA) or three channels (21.6 pA), reinforcing the previous observation ( Fig. 1A and B). Because lipid charge can affect channel conductance (Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012 , single channel conductance was analyzed in ERGIC/Golgi-like membranes that contained approximately 20% negatively charged lipids. Interestingly, the E protein IC showed a slightly higher unitary current jump of 1174 pA under these conditions, and multiples of this value, evidencing the insertion of additional channels, were also detected (Figs. 1C and D). The presence of the negatively charged lipid head-groups in the channel pore may facilitate Ca 2þ flow through the channel enhancing current intensity under these conditions. This effect was already reported for E protein and monovalent cations (Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012) . Additional measurements were performed in aqueous solutions with decreasing CaCl 2 concentrations, to approach Ca 2 þ amounts found in the ERGIC/Golgi lumen. IC conductance (G), which is the ratio between the current intensity and the applied voltage, was calculated. Single channel conductance scaled almost linearly with CaCl 2 concentration in neutral membranes (Fig. 1E ). This reflects that ion conduction inside the E protein IC is similar to the conduction of the solution, which increases as the electrolyte concentration rises. These data indicate that the interaction between the channel and the permeating ions is weak, and are in accordance with E protein forming a neutral pore in these conditions, as previously reported for monovalent cation salts (Verdia-Baguena et al., 2013) . In ERGIC/ Golgi membranes two different regimes depending on the range of CaCl 2 concentrations were observed. A linear relation between conductance and CaCl 2 concentration was again detected in high concentrated solutions. However, IC conductance in ERGIC/Golgi membranes was independent of CaCl 2 concentration in low concentration solutions (below 0.2 M), and higher than in neutral membranes (Fig. 1E ). This result suggests that E protein acts as a charged protein-lipid pore in ERGIC/Golgi membranes. In this scenario, the conductance is regulated by the balance between the ions that flow into the channel to neutralize the excess of negative charges and the bulk electrolyte concentration. Collectively, these data indicate that the E protein forms channels that are highly conductive in CaCl 2 . Furthermore, E protein ICs worked very efficiently when reconstituted in ERGIC/Golgi membranes under Ca 2 þ concentrations approaching those found in the lumen of the organelles (hundred μM). To specifically test E protein selectivity for Ca 2 þ , i.e. the ability of the IC to select Ca 2 þ either by its charge or by its intrinsic properties, reversal potential (Erev) experiments were performed. The rational of these experiments is provided next. ICs were reconstituted in lipid membranes that separated two solutions, one with high and the other with low CaCl 2 concentration. This concentration gradient induces the movement of ions through the channel to equilibrate their asymmetric distribution. The potential applied across the channel, which is required to counteract this ion movement leading to zero electric current is the Erev. The Erev can be transformed into channel permeability for Ca 2 þ (PCa 2 þ ) and Cl À (PCl À ) by using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (Hodgkin and Katz, 1949) . To test whether lipid charge may have an effect on E protein, selectivity measurements were performed in neutral, ERGIC/Golgi similar charged membranes, and fully negative-charged membranes. The E protein IC showed PCa 2 þ /PCl À values of 0.2 (1/5) in neutral membranes. The value of this permeability ratio is barely the same expected for a non-selective neutral pore just reflecting the different diffusivities of Ca 2 þ and Cl À . Therefore, E protein channel is equally selective for Cl À and Ca 2 þ in neutral membranes. Interestingly, the ratio PCa 2 þ /PCl À increased when the E protein IC was assembled in membranes containing negatively charged lipids, being 0.5 in ERGIC/ Golgi membranes and 1.8 in negative membranes (Fig. 2) . These data indicated that lipid charge largely influenced the channel preference for Ca 2 þ showing that under conditions mimicking the ERGIC/Golgi environment, E protein displayed a mild selectivity for Ca 2 þ .
