Two thousand eight hundred thirteen staff completed paper questionnaires while 235 completed electronic surveys. Three thousand forty-eight HCW participated (38%), which exceeded our target participation rate by three-fold. The distributions of survey participation by hospital and occupation are summarized in Table 2 . Nurses were the occupational category with the highest aggregate response rate, although more administrative/support staff responded in Hospital A. The median age of respondents across all sites was 42 years, 81% were female, and most (75%) worked in a patient-care area. More than one third (37%) of physicians worked in other healthcare facilities in addition to the study hospital (Table 3) . Staff visited an average of 3.79, 3.69 and 3.88 floors in their respective healthcare facility per week, with a standard deviation of 2.63, 1.74 and 2.08. Physicians reported the highest number of locations visited per week, while nurses reported the lowest. The number of locations visited varied significantly depending on job category (Table 3) . Results from Tukey post-hoc analyses showed nurses visited significantly fewer locations compared to physicians, "other HCW" and admin/support (p = 0.002, p = 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). Table 4 details the amount and type of contacts for each occupational group. Physicians reported the highest number of direct patient contacts (> 20 patients/day) but the lowest number of contacts with other HCWs, while nurses had the most extended (> 20 min) periods of Respondents were assigned to one of the four above categories based on their description in the free-text field provided direct patient contact. oHCWs had the most direct daily contact with other HCWs (Table 4) . Table 4 shows the number of contacts per occupational category. The first row in each pair corresponds to the number of respondents who answered questions labeled A1,. .., D1; the second row shows the percentage of these responses that satisfied the stated criteria (e.g., had direct contacts lasted more than 20 min).
