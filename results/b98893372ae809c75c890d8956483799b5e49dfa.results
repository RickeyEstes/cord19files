BAL samples from 157 immunocompromised patients were examined for detection of P. jirovecii. Because of insufficient amounts of BAL samples 29 of these patients were excluded from retrospective laboratory analysis for new or emerging viruses. Of 128 patients included in the analysis 50 (39.1%) patients were HIV-infected, 51 (39.8%) suffered from hematological malignancy (e.g. leukemia, lymphoma) and 27 (21.1%) were treated with immunosuppressive medication because of solid organ transplantation (e.g. kidney, heart) or other multisystemic diseases. Overall P. jirovecii was detected in 26 of 128 (20.3%) patients included in the retrospective analysis: 17 of 50 (34%) HIV-infected patients, five of 51 (9.8%) patients with hematological malignancy and four of 27 (14.8) patients with immunosuppressive treatment due to other causes (Table 1) . Several bacteria were cultured in 10 of 128 (7.8%) patients and fungi were found in five of 128 (3.9%) patients. Viruses were detected in five of 128 (3.9%) patients; CMV in one patient with hematological malignancy, Influenza A in two patients (one HIV-infected patient and one with immunosuppressive medication). RSV, Influenza B and coronavirus were not detected in any BAL specimens. HMPV was detected in a BAL specimen of a male patient with chronic myeloid leukemia and allogenic bone marrow transplantation. He was admitted with severe dyspnea, cough and fever and atypical pneumonia were diagnosed by chest X-ray and computed tomography. Bronchoscopy showed hyperemia of the tracheal mucosa suggesting inflammation and histological analysis of lung biopsies resulted in infiltrates with lymphocytes and plasma cells and the additional diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma of the lung. The patient did not show the ''sepsis-like'' syndrome or pulmonary hemorrhage previously described by Englund and coworkers. 7 Unfortunately the patient died due to a severe aggravation of the atypical pneumonia and fatal pulmonary failure 10 days after admission. Human bocavirus was detected in a BAL specimen of a female patient with lymphoma and induced immunosuppression due to chemotherapy. She developed a fever of unknown origin and was treated with antibiotics, antimycotic treatment and with ganciclovir because of suspected CMV infection. The patient reported ongoing pneumonialike symptoms and atypical pneumonia was diagnosed. A BAL specimen was taken and the only positive result was hBoV. Within a few days the symptoms improved continually and the patient was discharged from hospital.
