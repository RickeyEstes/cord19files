We consider here the hypothetical hospital ward in Fig. 2 in Noakes and Sleigh (2009) , and ventilation settings according to Table 1 in Noakes and Sleigh (2009) . This hypothetical hospital ward consists of three six-bedded bays connected through a corridor. Each bay is split into two ventilation zones, and each ventilation zone contains three patients. The corridor is split into three ventilation zones and in the first instance has no patients, so that the ward has N = 18 patients. Ventilation rate over the whole ward was 27 m 3 /min, which equated to an air change rate of 3 AC/h. Diagrams of the ventilation flows and specific rates within and between each zone for each setting are given in Fig. 2 . Moreover, we set p i = 0.01 m 3 /min and q i = 0.5 quanta/min for all patients at all zones and for every ventilation scenario (Noakes & Sleigh, 2009) , and assume an average LOS for each patient γ −1 i = 7 days. If we order the M = 9 ventilation zones as the ventilation matrix is given by Table III. and ventilation settings in Table 1 in Noakes and Sleigh (2009) lead to the ventilation matrices reported in Fig. 2 . In Sections 4.1-4.3 and 4.6, we consider that outbreak declaration occurs after one patient shows symptoms, with each patient showing symptoms after an average time δ −1 (i.e., δ j = δ for all 1 ≤ j ≤ M). Alternative outbreak detection and declaration hypotheses are discussed in Sections 4.4 and 4.5, while the impact of parameter q in our numerical results is explored in Section 4.7.
