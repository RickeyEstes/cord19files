We designed a dual-mode antibody display system for presenting antibody molecules on the surface of Pichia pastoris. In this system, the hinge region along with CH2-CH3 domains comprised in the crystalizable fragment (Fc) of the IgG1 molecule was directly fused to the N-terminus of the previously described glycophosphoinositol (GPI) protein ScSed1p [3] . The introduction of this fusion in yeast results in the targeting of the Fc to the cell wall. As described in Figure 1 , once this anchored fusion is co-expressed with a full-length IgG molecule, the Fc portion of the Fc-Sed1p fusion is expected to hetero-dimerize and form inter-disulfide linkages, through their respective hinge regions, in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the Fc portion of the heavy chain (Hc) of the half IgG molecule. The complex interaction of Fc-ScSed1p-Fc(Hc+Lc) coupled to the association between the heavy chain and the light chain (Lc) within the antigen binding fragment (Fab) results in the display of the monovalent Hc+Lc moiety on the cell surface. The concomitant and independent association of the soluble heavy and light chain units of the full length IgG molecule would result in the secretion of fully assembled antibody molecules. To reduce the above concept into practice, we introduced the Fc-ScSed1p expression cassette into three Glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris strains. As described in Table 1 these strains included yeast YGLY18483 which expresses full-length antihuman PCSK9, and YGLY13979 which expresses full-length anti-human Her2 IgGs. We assayed antibody display and expression in each strain following cultivation in 1L bioreactors by two independent methods. First, we examined the display of monovalent IgGs on the cell surface by monitoring the expression of the light chain on the yeast cell surface. Cells were labeled with anti-human IgG Kappa chain and their fluorescence intensity was analyzed using flow cytometry ( Figure 2A ). We reasoned that the presence of the light chain on the cell surface would be indicative of the successful heterodimerization and assembly of cell wall anchored Fc-ScSed1p and monovalent Hc+Lc IgG molecule. Second, the supernatants of cultures in (Figure 2A ) were passed through a Protein A column to capture secreted full-length IgG. The eluents were subsequently resolved by electrophoresis to establish the presence of full-length fully assembled IgGs ( Figure 2B ). As demonstrated in Figure 2A (I; II), only strains containing both Fc-ScSed1p bait and full-length IgG expression cassettes reacted with anti-human Kappa light chain antibodies indicating the ability of the system to display the (Hc+Lc) half antibody molecules. Moreover, electrophoresis of Protein Acaptured pools confirmed that the supernatants of the display strains contain levels of secreted full-length IgGs that are similar to those of the non-display parents without Fc-ScSed1p bait ( Figure 2B ). We also employed 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB) labeling and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to analyze the glycan content on IgGs at Fc N297 site produced in strains with or without Fc-ScSed1p. We observed that the glycosylation signatures in the display-secretion strains (with "Fc bait") were similar to those of non-display parent strains without "Fc bait" (Figure 2C ). Taken together these experiments prove that this system is capable of displaying monovalent antibodies while maintaining simultaneous secretion of soluble full length assembled (Hc2+Lc2) molecules. Furthermore, the secreted IgGs are modified with human-type N-glycans that are comparable to those that occur on molecules produced by the "non-display" strains. To demonstrate that the robustness of dimerization between the "bait" Fc-ScSed1p and Fc region of IgG (Hc+Lc) occurs through hinge region disulfide linkages, we subjected cultures displaying anti-Human PCSK9 to various denaturation conditions and then probed the cell surface for the presence of IgGs. As described earlier, we labeled cells with fluorescentlyconjugated anti-human Fc and anti-human IgG Kappa chain antibodies followed by flow cytometry. Only when cultures were treated with 0.5M DTT in the presence of 6M urea, did we observe a complete loss in the ability to detect the light chain on the surface of these cells (50% of Fc was still detectable due to the presence of cell wall-anchored Fc-Sed1p bait) ( Figure 2D ). We concluded that in this method, the capture of the half antibody (Hc+Lc) on the cell surface occurs via both hydrophobic and covalent interaction in a manner similar to the assembly of full length IgGs. We next sought to establish whether the displayed monovalent antibodies are properly assembled and are able to bind to their cognate antigens. To this end, we probed the ability of displayed anti-PCSK9 (Hc+Lc) antibody to bind specifically to biotinylated human PCSK9. An anti-Her2 display strain was used as a negative control. We incubated both display strains with fluorescently labeled anti-human Fc and biotinylated human PCSK9. As shown in Figure 3A , yeasts displaying anti-Her2 on cell surface were able to bind to the anti-Fc reagent only, while cells displaying anti-PCSK9 reacted with both biotinylated PCSK9 antigen and anti-human Fc antibody ( Figure 3B ). The goal of developing this novel antibody surface display is its application in antibody discovery and maturation while preserving full-length IgG secretion. For that purpose, we designed a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the utility of this display method in maturing the expressibility of an antibody lead in Glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris while maintaining the affinity to its known antigen. An anti-PCSK9 mAb (mAb1) was originally identified from a phage display library with low nanomolar affinity. In order to isolate novel anti-PCSK9 leads with optimal expression in Glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris, two synthetic DNA libraries covering heavy and light chain CDR3 regions were designed and synthesized by site directed mutagenesis. The final diversity of the heavy chain library was 4,320 while the final diversity of the light chain library was 1,296. Both heavy chain and light chain libraries were introduced separately into haploid Pichia pastoris strains containing the Fc-ScSed1p expression cassette. To create a full-length antibody library, haploid libraries of the heavy and light chains were combined by mating to generate a diploid fulllength IgG library with a diversity of ~5 x 10 6 . We sequenced the heavy and the light chain genes from 40 diploid strains. This confirmed both the presence of heavy and light chains, and the amino acid sequence diversity in the library, as all of the clones tested contained unique antibody genes. We also analyzed affinities of secreted IgGs produced in these diploids by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Although the majority of these diploid clones did not produce high levels of full-length antibodies as assessed by ELISA and SDS-PAGE (data not shown), no PCSK9 binders were observed in this randomly selected pool where full length IgG was produced, thus indicating majority of mutations that were introduced to this antibody resulted in loss of optimal expression and antigen binding (See Figure 4B, panel L1) . We subsequently employed FACS to isolate highly-expressed mAbs that retained binding to PCSK9. To this end, three rounds of sorting were carried out. Twenty nM biotinylated PCSK9 antigen was used in each round, and the top 1% binders were isolated based on fluorescence intensity. After each round, ~1000 clones were plated on solid medium. Forty clones were selected, and their heavy chain and light chain genes were PCR amplified and sequenced to determine their amino acid sequence. Since this method enables simultaneous display and production of mAbs, leads selected by FACS were directly cultured in 96-well plates to produce full-length secreted IgG for in vitro PCSK9 binding studies. As depicted in Figure 4B , when compared to the anti-PCSK9 positive control, we were able to enrich for a pool of positive PCSK9 binders following three rounds of FACS ( Figure 4B : L1 > S1 > S2 > S3). Interestingly, the final round of sorting enriched a single mAb candidate ( Figure 4B : S3), as suggested by gene sequencing data, this clone was highly represented after two sorting rounds which indicates the high efficiency of FACS enrichment (Table 2 ). Using single-point (2.5 nM rhPCSK9) SPR, the affinities of a select number of co-secreted IgGs from round two clones were determined. As listed in Table 2 we were able to isolate a novel mAb against PSCK9 with affinity similar to the original anti-PCSK9 lead. The anti-Kappa ELISA protein titers for the novel leads reached up to 30 µg/mL compared with 10 µg/mL for the mAb1 control. We sought to generate novel anti-PCSK9 binders with optimized expressibility in Glyco-engineered Pichia, while maintaining affinity of the original lead. To confirm this in a bioreactor setting, the selected clones: high affinity S2-10, and medium affinity S2-15 were cultivated and fermented in smallscale bioreactors to generate full-length mAbs. Originator Anti-PCSK9 (AX) expression strain was included as a control. Following fermentation, mAbs were purified using Protein A chromatography. The concentration of antibody was 4 . The construction of a proof of principle mating library and the isolation of high affinity, and high expression antigen binders using Fc-Sed1p. A) Haploid Pichia pastoris strains containing Fc-Sed1p expression cassette were transformed with a library of Anti-PCSK9 Hc or a library of Anti-PCSK9 Lc. Following mating and selection, diploids were cultured to express full length IgG library. Cultures were labeled using 20nM biotinylated human PCSK9 and APC 635 labeled antihuman Kappa. DyeLight 488 labeled Streptavidin was used to detect biotinylated PCSK9. B) Analysis and enrichment of high affinity anti-PCSK9 binders using three rounds of sequential sorting (S1 > S2 > S3). Known anti-PCSK9 strain co-expressing Fc-Sed1p was labeled as above as a control. C) Sensograms showing binding and dissociation kinetics of rhPCSK9 to immobilized anti-PCSK9 antibodies. Each anti-PCSK9 antibody lead was captured on the chip to ~ 500 RU followed by analyte injections of wild-type human PCSK9 at concentrations ranging from 0.156-2.5nM. Kinetics for the highest PCSK9 concentration (2.5 nM) is depicted for these antibodies. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0070190.g004 determined using Protein A HPLC analysis and affinities were measured by SPR by injecting rhPCSK9 at concentrations ranging from 0.156 to 2.5 nM. Figure 4C and Table 3 show that the ranking of affinities of these novel IgGs were in agreement with data obtained in 96-well experiment, however the affinity values for lead S2-15 appeared lower in the 96-well experiment ( Table 2 ). This is primarily due to the nature of the biacore data that is obtained by assaying crude supernatants from 96-well plates using a single concentration of the antigen. For that reason this assay can only be used for highthroughput clone selection, and data from the purified samples (Table 3) are reported for the actual affinities. The newly identified S2-10 exhibited a slightly slower "Off" rate but maintained almost identical "On" rate compared to the original molecule (AX), which might account for the difference in affinity (2.14 nM compared to 4.32 nM, respectively) ( Table  3) . Moreover, the expression levels of newly identified leads reached up to 0.5 g/L compared with ~100mg/L observed for the original anti-PCSK9 lead AX. This demonstrates that this display method is capable of discovering novel high affinity antibody leads with improved production titers. We have presented the development of a novel dual-mode display and secretion technology in Glyco-engineered Pichia pastoris, and demonstrated the utility of this method in selecting mAb leads with variable affinities and high productivity. The combination of display and secretion in the same clone enables the continuity and fidelity of the antibody discovery process and could lead to shortened maturation cycle and desirable lead developability.
