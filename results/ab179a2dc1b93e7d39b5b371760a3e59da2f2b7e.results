A total of 596 patients were included in the study. Among these, 90% of infants were born at term (37-42 weeks of gestation) and 357 (60%) were born via vaginal delivery. The mean age of the study population was 11.4 ± 0.3 days. The mean birth weight was 3230.6 ± 508.3 g, and 338 (56%) infants were male and 258 (44%) were female. Among all patients, 166 (27.9%) were diagnosed with jaundice. The number of patients diagnosed with RV infection was 177 (29.7%). There was no significant seasonal variation in this study period. Table 1 presents the demographic characteristics of patients with and without jaundice. There was no significant difference between the two groups for GA, birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), sex, Apgar score, and perinatal problems. Perinatal problems included two cases of maternal diabetes mellitus, two cases of maternal thyroid disease, and 32 cases of premature rupture of membranes (PROM). At the time of admission, the mean ages of the jaundice and non-jaundice groups were 8.3 ± 0.4 days and 12.6 ± 0.4 days, respectively (p = 0.001). Hospital stay was shorter in the jaundice group than in the non-jaundice group (5.1 ± 0.6 days vs. 7.1 ± 0.4 days, respectively, p = 0.007. The rate of vaginal delivery in the jaundice group was significantly higher than that in the non-jaundice group [117 (70.5%) vs. 240 (55.8%), respectively, p = 0.001]. The rate of exclusive breastfeeding was significantly higher in the jaundice group than in the non-jaundice group [29.5% (49/166) vs. 16 .5% (71/430), respectively, p = 0.001]. Table 2 presents a comparison of the factors that may affect jaundice. Reticulocyte counts demonstrated a significant difference of 2.3% ± 0.2% in the jaundice group and 1.9% ± 0.1% in the non-jaundice group (p = 0.029). Total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and Hb levels were significantly higher in the jaundice group than in the non-jaundice group (p = 0.001). CRP level was significantly different in the jaundice group at 2.1 ± 0.4 mg/L and non-jaundice group at 7.2 ± 0.9 mg/L (p = 0.001). In the jaundice group, the RV infection rate was 70 (42%) and that of asymptomatic RV infection was 36 (21%), which was significantly different from the non-jaundice group (p = 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in late-onset sepsis between the two groups. Respiratory PCR demonstrated a significant difference of 6 (3.6%) in the jaundice group and 61 (14.2%) in the non-jaundice group (p = 0.001). Among the 166 patients with jaundice, 63 (37.9%) used antibiotics. Table 3 present the jaundice and bilirubin levels in neonates with positive and negative RV infection. There was no difference in direct bilirubinemia with the presence of RV infection in the jaundice group. The total bilirubin level at ≤15 mg/dL was higher in the rotavirus positive group than in the rotavirus negative group (27.1% vs. 13.5%, respectively; p = 0.028). Table 4 presents the results of the logistic regression analysis performed with all factors, seven of which demonstrated statistically significant differences. The risk of jaundice increased when the patient was older than 37 weeks, when the mode of delivery was vaginal, when the newborn was exclusively breastfed, when the Hb level was ≥15 mg/dL, and when tests for RV infection were positive (all p < 0.05). The risk of jaundice decreased when the age at admission was ≥7 days compared to that when age at admission was < 7 days [OR = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.16-0.51; p = 0.001]. The risk of jaundice decreased
