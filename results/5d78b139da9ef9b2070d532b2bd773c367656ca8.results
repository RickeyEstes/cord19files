Accumulation of positive-sense RNA strands of SeV copy-back DVGs associates with strong stimulation of the antiviral response during infection. We previously reported that iDVGs naturally generated in vivo trigger potent lung antiviral immunity (24) . To examine whether SeV iDVGs induce a broad antiviral state that could protect against unrelated viral infections, mouse cells were infected either with SeV C containing high levels of copy-back iDVGs (SeV HD) or with SeV C depleted of iDVGs (SeV LD) or left untreated (N/T) and reinfected 6 h later with the unrelated IAV. Cells preinfected with SeV HD were significantly more resistant to IAV replication than were cells preinfected with SeV LD (Fig. 1A) and induced higher antiviral gene expression levels (Fig. 1B) . These data indicate that SeV iDVGs stimulate a strong antiviral state that can protect against infection with unrelated viruses. To better understand the molecular basis of the strong immunostimulatory ability of SeV iDVGs, we looked for molecular motifs responsible for their activity. Because copy-back DVGs maintain the promoter elements necessary for replication, both positive-and negative-sense DVG RNA strands are present in infected cells (Fig. 1C) . To narrow the search for molecular motifs that confer strong stimulatory activity on iDVGs, we first assessed whether a specific strand of iDVG preferentially activates the host antiviral response during infection. We quantified the number of positive-and negative-sense RNA strands of a predominant iDVG (DVG-546) present during infection with SeV HD (12, 34) and correlated these amounts with IFNB1 mRNA expression. For the description and validation of this assay, see Fig. S1A and B in the supplemental material. Although copy numbers of negative-sense DVG strands were consistently higher than those of positive-sense DVG strands throughout infection (see Fig. S1C ), an increased ratio of positive-to negative-sense DVG strands positively correlated with the induction of IFNB1 expression in infected human A549 cells (Fig. 1D) . The correlation between positive-sense DVG RNA and type I IFN expression was recapitulated in LLC-MK2 cells, a cell line highly permissive to SeV replication (see Fig. S1D ). Confirming the strong ability of positive-sense DVG RNA to stimulate the antiviral response, RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in combination with immunofluorescent staining showed that IRF3 translocation to the nucleus occurs predominantly in cells showing a strong positive-sense DVG signal ( Fig. 1E and F) . Thus, accumulation of positive-sense copy-back DVGs is positively associated with the induction of antiviral responses in cells infected with SeV. Identification of a candidate motif essential for type I IFN induction by positive-sense DVG RNA. We have reported that alterations in the internal (noncomplementary) region of DVG-546 drastically affect its stimulatory capacity (26) . Specifically, we found that a mutant form of DVG (DVG-324) retaining the 5= end of the internal sequence promoted high levels of expression of type I IFNs upon transfection, while a mutant DVG missing the 5= end of the internal sequence (DVG-354) showed a significant loss of stimulatory ability. These data suggest that a specific region located at the 5= end of the internal sequence plays an essential role in maximizing the stimulatory potential of DVG RNA. Additional mutant DVGs further confirmed this prediction ( Fig. 2A and B) . One mutant DVG that retained a shorter 5= internal sequence (DVG-268) also showed potent immunostimulatory activity, while mutant DVGs lacking either the complete internal sequence (DVG-200) or both complementary sequences (DVG-IS) demonstrated a reduced ability to stimulate antiviral genes upon transfection into both mouse and human cells ( Fig. 2B ; see Fig. S2A and B in the supplemental material). This differential activity of mutant DVGs was sustained over a 24 h time course, ruling out the possibility of different kinetics of IFN induction by the different mutant DVGs (see Fig. S2C ). For all of these studies, in vitrotranscribed DVG (ivtDVG) RNAs were purified from gels, tested for purity and endotoxin content, and transfected into cells at equal molarity (see Fig. S3A to D). To identify the specific sequence and/or secondary RNA structure responsible for the strong stimulatory activity of iDVGs, we modeled in silico the folding of mutant DVGs with either a strong or a weak ability to induce type I IFN expression. For in silico folding predictions, we excluded the 3= complementary sequence of the constructs since long complementarities strongly interfere with modeling based on minimal free energy, resulting in predicted structures that significantly deviate from the natural folding of the molecule (Fig. 2C ). Under these conditions, we identified a candidate stem-loop structure formed by nt 70 to 114 (DVG 70-114 ) of DVG-546 that was observed only in mutant DVGs showing strong stimulatory ability (Fig. 2D ). This region is enriched in A/U nucleotides compared to the positive-sense SeV genome or full-length DVG-546 (Fig. 2D) . DVG 70-114 spans the 3= end of the 5= complementary sequence and the 5= end of the internal sequence, consistent with a partial requirement for segments of the complementary and internal regions of iDVG for strong induction of IFN expression. This difference was recapitulated in murine cells and sustained at the RNA and protein levels over a 24 h time course (Fig. 2G) . A reduced ability to induce IFN production was also observed in DVG-546 ⌬70-114 (see Fig. S4D ), demonstrating that DVG 70-114 is required for optimal stimulatory activity of DVG-546. To further confirm the stimulatory role of DVG 70-114 , we introduced point mutations into this motif. A nucleotide swap within the stem region of DVG 70-114 (U106G) disrupted the complementary structure of the DVG 70-114 motif (Fig. 2E) , resulting in reduced stimulation by DVG-268 (Fig. 2F ) and suggesting that the potent activity of SeV iDVGs depends on the integrity of the DVG 70-114 motif. To determine if specific noncomplementary structures within DVG 70-114 are necessary for stimulation, we performed single-nucleotide swaps in the most distal loops of the DVG 70-114 motif (A89U and C97G) while preserving its overall predicted structure (Fig. 2E) . Interestingly, the C97G mutation, but not the A89U mutation, decreased the ability of DVG 70-114 to trigger IFNB1 mRNA expression compared to that of parental DVG-268 (Fig. 2F ), indicating that both the structure and the sequence influence the stimulatory potential of DVG . , and IFN-␤ protein and mRNA levels were measured by ELISA and RT-qPCR, respectively. The data are the mean Ϯ the standard error of the mean of three independent experiments. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. Bars correspond to the standard error of the mean. *, P Ͻ0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01; ***, P Ͻ 0.001; ****, P Ͻ 0.0001; ns, nonsignificant (two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc test). Data are expressed as the copy number relative to that of the housekeeping gene for GAPDH. infection with rDVG-354, while the viral protein and DVG RNA expression levels were equivalent (Fig. 3B ). These data show that DVG 70-114 functions to enhance the antiviral response during infection, demonstrating its biological relevance. To further evaluate whether DVG 70-114 promotes antiviral immunity in the presence of a virus-encoded antagonist, we infected cells with SeV LD 24 h before transfection with either DVG-268 or DVG-268 ⌬70-114 . By the time of DVG RNA transfection, viral protein mRNA, including NP and P/V, had accumulated to high levels in the cells ( Fig. 3C ; see Fig. S3E in the supplemental material) and no antiviral gene expression was detected (Fig. 3D , NT [nontransfected]). Agreeing with their predicted stimulatory potential, transfection of DVG-268 resulted in the strong expression of antiviral genes while DVG-268 ⌬70-114 maintained its reduced stimulatory potential under these conditions (Fig. 3D ). These data further demonstrate that DVG 70-114 has strong immunostimulatory activity even in the presence of potent viral antagonists of detection. The 3= complementary end of iDVG RNA is not required for maximal IFN induction. Contrary to previous implications, our data strongly suggest that complementarity along the 5= and 3= ends of copy-back DVGs is not a requirement for their strong stimulatory activity. To directly test if the 3=complementary sequence is essential, we deleted the complete 3= complementary sequence (94 nucleotides [nt]) from DVG-324 ( Fig. 4A ; DVG-324NC). Upon transfection, DVG-324NC induced the same level of expression of antiviral genes as parental DVG-324, and both mutants showed higher potency than DVG-546 (Fig. 4B ). As expected, the potent stimulatory activity of DVG-324NC depended on the DVG 70-114 motif, as a DVG-324NC ⌬70-114 mutant had significantly less stimulatory potential ( Fig. 4C and D) . To control for the role of additional secondary structures in the stimulatory activity of DVG-324NC, we next removed an auxiliary secondary motif (DVG 5-51 ) located more proximal to the 5=triphosphate end of RNA than DVG 70-114 (Fig. 4C , blue circle, and E). This motif is also preserved in all of the mutant DVGs shown in Fig. 2 . Deletion of DVG 5-51 in DVG-324NC did not affect the integrity of DVG 70-114 or the overall structure of the DVG (Fig. 4C ) and did not have an impact on the stimulatory activity of Cells and supernatants were collected 48 h later and inoculated into 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. SeV containing rDVGs was collected from the allantoic fluid. T7 pro, T7 promoter sequence; Riboz., ribozyme; T7 term, T7 polymerase terminator sequence. (B) LL-CMK2 cells were infected with virus rDVG-324 or rDVG-354 at an MOI of 5 TCID 50 /cell and analyzed at 6 h postinfection by RT-qPCR for the expression of IFNB1 and IFIT1 mRNA, SeV NP mRNA, and DVGs. The relative copy number of DVG RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR with the DVG comp primers (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The data are the average of three independent experiments. *, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01; ***, P Ͻ 0.001; ****, P Ͻ 0.0001; ns, nonsignificant (one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc test and two-tailed t test in DVG RNA quantification). Data are expressed as the copy number relative to that of the housekeeping gene for GAPDH. (C and D) LL-CMK2 cells were infected with SeV LD at an MOI of 1.5 TCID 50 /cell and transfected 24 h later with 4.15 pmol of DVG-268 or DVG-268 ⌬70-114 RNA or left untreated (NT). Expression of SeV NP and SeV (P/V) (C) and antiviral genes (D) was measured at 6 h posttransfection. The data are the average of three independent experiments. *, P Ͻ 0.05; **, P Ͻ 0.01; ***, P Ͻ 0.001; ****, P Ͻ 0.0001; ns, nonsignificant (one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post hoc test). Data are expressed as the copy number relative to that of the housekeeping gene for GAPDH. DVG-324NC (Fig. 4E) . Overall, these data demonstrate that DVG 70-114 enhances the immunostimulatory activity of DVG RNA and functions independently of the 3=-end complementary sequence or additional proximal secondary structures. Stabilization of DVG 70-114 enhances its stimulatory potential. We next evaluated whether stabilization of the DVG 70-114 motif could further optimize the stimulatory activity of DVGderived RNAs. To do this, we introduced an additional A-U base pair into the DVG 70-114 long stem region of the DVG-324NC background. This insertion stabilized the stem structure as it increased its minimal free energy from Ϫ9.8 to Ϫ10.89 kcal/mol (Fig. 4F , DVG-324NC motif1ϩ). Cells transfected with DVG-324NC motif1ϩ RNA expressed 2-fold higher IFNB1 and IFIT1 mRNA levels than cells transfected with unmodified DVG-324NC ( Fig. 4G and data not shown), demonstrating that stabilization of the DVG 70-114 motif improves its immunostimulatory potential. The stimulatory enhancement potential of stabilizing DVG 70-114 was further validated in DVG-546 (see Fig. S4E and F in the supplemental material). DVG 70-114 motif confers strong immunostimulatory activity to inert RNA molecules. To assess if the immunostimulatory activity of DVG 70-114 could be transferred to inert 5=-triphosphatecontaining RNA molecules, we cloned the DVG 70-114 motif into the X region of HCV, a well-described nonimmunostimulatory small RNA derived from the virus genome (13) . Our cloning strategy preserved the RNA stem-loop structures present in both the DVG 70-114 motif and the X region (Fig. 5A) . Remarkably, transfection of the ivtDVG RNA X region DVG 70-114 (X region-based mutant that includes DVG 70-114 ) led to strong expression of IFNB1 and IFIT1 mRNA, while that of the X region alone did not (Fig. 5B ). X region DVG 70-114 also demonstrated an ability to stimulate antiviral gene expression equivalent to that of HCV poly(U/UC) (13) (Fig. 5B ). To rule out the possibility that the potent activity of X region DVG 70-114 resulted from the introduction of an additional stem-loop structure, independently of the sequence of the motif, we also cloned into the X region the auxiliary DVG 5-51 motif which is not required for immunostimulatory activity of DVG RNA (Fig. 4G ). DVG 5-51 has a size similar to that of DVG 70-114 and causes equivalent disruption of X region folding (Fig. 5A) . Introduction of the DVG 5-51 motif did not alter the stimulatory activity of the X region (Fig. 5B) , demonstrating that DVG 70-114 has exceptional and transferrable immunostimulatory potential. Lastly, we compared the activity of DVG RNA with that of other known RIG-I ligands. As shown in Fig. S5A in the supplemental material, DVG-derived RNA binds to RIG-I with an affinity equivalent to that of poly(U/UC) and RNA containing DVG 70-114 stimulates levels of antiviral expression equivalent to that of poly(U/UC) or the viral RNA synthetic analog poly (I:C) (see Fig. S5B and C). The DVG 70-114 motif promotes binding of the viral RNA to RIG-I. To establish whether the strong stimulatory activity of DVG-268 and DVG-324NC is mediated by RIG-I, we transfected these constructs into mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking the essential RLR MAVS molecule or lacking the RIG-I sensor. Similar to other DVG constructs (26) , IFNB1 mRNA expression was dependent on MAVS and RIG-I activity for both mutant DVGs (Fig. 6A) , while control poly (I:C) showed only MAVS, but not RIG-I, dependency. In addition, IFNB1 stimulation was largely dependent on the presence of uncapped 5=-triphosphates (Fig. 6B ) and on RNA secondary structures (Fig. 6C) . To determine if the DVG 70-114 motif augmented the binding of DVG RNA to RIG-I, we performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with DVG RNA exposed to purified RIG-I proteins that lacked the signaling (CARD) domain (RIG-I deltaCARD). RIG-I deltaCARD was used previously to characterize specific RNA binding signatures and demonstrated RNA binding affinity equivalent to that of the full-length parental protein (10, 35) . We tested the binding affinity of RIG-I for iDVGs with or without DVG 70-114 in the absence or presence of ATP, which promotes RIG-I polymerization upon association with RNA. DVG RNAs containing the DVG 70-114 motif (DVG-268) were more profoundly displaced in the gels than RNAs lacking this motif (DVG-268 ⌬70-114 and DVG-200) in both the absence and the presence of ATP (Fig. 6D and E ; see Fig. S6A in the supplemental material). These data indicate a stronger capacity of RNA containing the DVG 70-114 motif to promote RIG-I binding and polymerization to high-molecularweight complexes, essential events in RLR signaling (36) (37) (38) . In addition, a slight enhancement of the binding capacity of RNAs containing the DVG 70-114 motif to MDA5 deltaCARD was observed (see Fig. S6B ), supporting previous reports of a supplementary role for MDA5 in the sensing of DVGs (33) . Together, these results demonstrate that DVG 70-114 facilitates the binding of viral RNAs to RLRs and is critical for effective triggering of RIG-I signaling in response to SeV iDVGs.
