The purity of the cultured astrocytes was determined to be more than 95% by GFAP immunostaining with the anti-GFAP antibody (Fig. 1A) . These astrocytes contained the a subtype of protein kinase C (Fig.  1B ), but /3 and 7 subtypes were not detected in our experiment (data not shown). The amount of formazan product detected at 620 nm showed a good correlation to astrocyte numbers ( Fig. 2) , so the colorimetric assay was validated for assessing astrocyte proliferation in the subsequent experiments. When astroc~te cultures were treated with three stimulants (TPA, LPS and crude cytokine extract) that have been shown to activate these cells in different manners 39, only TPA was found to enhance astrocyte proliferation (Fig. 3A) . TPA enhanced astrocyte proliferation in a dose-dependent manner from a concentration of 0.1 to 100 ng/ml, but was toxic at higher concentrations (Fig. 313) . Since the cultures were not confluent, the astrocytes gradually increased in numbers, showing a 25% increase on day 3 and a 45% increase on day 5 (Fig. 3C) . This time-dependent increase was enhanced by TPA to about 40% on day 3 and 55% on day 5, when compared to the respective control (Fig. 3C) . The effect of TPA was inbibited by 10 nM staurosporine (Fig. 3C) . Indomethacin (1 /xM) increased both the control and TPA-induced proliferation of astrocytes by 260% and 370%, respectively (Fig. 4) . This effect of indomethacin showed saturation at around 10 ~M. It also increased astrocyte proliferation in the presence of 10 nM staurosporine, which completely inhibited TPA-dependent growth; 10 /zM indomethacin increased astrocyte proliferation slightly but significantly (Fig. 4) . Authentic prostaglandin E z inhibited both the indomethacin-induced and control proliferation of astrocytes (Fig. 5) , and it reduced the TPA-induced proliferative response of astrocytes to only 30% (Fig. 5) . These tion in the presence or absence of indomethacin to 112% and 140% of the respective prostaglandin E 2treated levels. Astrocytes produced about 200 pg of prostaglandin E 2 per 2 Ã— 105 cells under control culture conditions, an amount that was four times the production by microglia under the same conditions (Fig. 6 ). LPS and TPA increased prostaglandin E 2 production about 1.7-fold and 4.5-fold, respectively, when compared to the control astrocyte cultures. LPS and TPA also increased microglial prostaglandin E 2 production by about 40-fold and 5-fold, respectively. Thus, astrocytes were more sensitive to TPA than to LPS, while microglia were the opposite.
