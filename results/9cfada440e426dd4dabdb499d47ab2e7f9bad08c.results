Experimental setup for studying the interaction of the innate immune system with arterivirus-induced membrane structures. Our goal was to analyze whether the innate immune system responds to the formation of positive-strand RNA virus-induced replication organelles, and we hypothesized that such a response could be linked to the type I IFN signaling pathway, which has an important role in counteracting virus infections from their earliest stage onwards. Human liver carcinoma cells (HuH-7), which are susceptible to EAV infection (Fig. 1A) (23) and produce high titers of infectious virus, were used based on their responsiveness to Oudshoorn et al. (Fig. 1B) (32) . When EAV-infected HuH-7 cells were fixed by high-pressure freezing followed by freeze substitution (HPF-FS) and subsequently analyzed by EM, DMSs similar to those previously described upon EAV infection in other cell types were readily observed ( Fig. 1C) (13, 23) . DMVs with characteristic double membranes and cores were abundantly present (Fig. 1C , red arrows) as well as the N protein-containing tubules described previously (13) (Fig. 1C , black arrows). In order to establish whether EAV replication is sensitive to IFN-␤ treatment in HuH-7 cells, cells were infected with a recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing reporter virus (EAV-GFP [33] ; multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 10) and treated with IFN-␤ from 1 h postinfection (p.i.) onward. A clear dose-dependent reduction of the GFP signal was observed during a single cycle of infection (Fig. 1D) .
