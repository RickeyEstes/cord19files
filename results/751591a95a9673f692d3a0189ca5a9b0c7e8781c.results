Homozygosity for a splice site mutation in IRF9 We studied a 5-yr-old girl (patient [P]) born to first-cousin Algerian parents and living in France who was hospitalized for severe infection with IAV requiring mechanical ventilation and Tamiflu treatment, and who had a history of recurrent benign bronchiolitis, biliary perforation following measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination at 1 yr of age, and recurrent fevers without a causative pathogen identified ( Fig. 1 A) . P also was infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) within her first year of life, for which she was hospitalized but not admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We characterized P's history of viral infections at age 2 yr, 7 wk before IgG i.v. substitution and after maternal antibodies disappeared, by VirScan (Xu et al., 2015) . We detected significant specific antibodies in P's serum against many other viruses, including HSV-1, human cytomegalovirus, human rhinovirus (HRV), and enterovirus, in addition to confirming infections with RSV and IAV (Fig. S1 ). After her recovery from IAV infection, she experienced adenovirus and parainfluenza virus (PIV) infections, both of which were also confirmed by VirScan. She was admitted to the hospital for these infections, but neither required admission to the ICU. We performed WES on this kindred (trio design) and identified a c.991G>A mutation in IRF9, encoding a critical element of the type I and III IFN signaling pathways (IRF9), which was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Fig. 1 B; Fu et al., 1990; Veals et al., 1992; Kimura et al., 1996) . P was homozygous for this mutation while both parents and her healthy sister were heterozygous, a familial segregation consistent with an AR pattern of inheritance with complete penetrance (Casanova et al., 2014) . This variation was absent from public databases, including 1,000 genomes, Bravo, and Genome Aggregation Database (GnomAD)-a database that encompasses the exome aggregation consortium (ExAC) database. This mutation occurs in the final nucleotide of exon 7 and is predicted to disrupt the essential splice site at the boundary of exon 7 and intron 7, as well as to produce an aspartic acid to asparagine mutation at amino acid 331 (p.D331N). Because of the different predictions for these mutations on IRF9 protein structure, we will presently refer to this allele by its effect on the cDNA, c.991G>A. The combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) score of this variant was high, above the mutation significance cutoff ( Fig. 1 C) , Figure 1 .

GAP DH and LaminA/C were used as loading controls. Representative results of three independent experiments are shown. (F) Reporter assays of ISRE or GAS-dependent firefly luciferase tested in U2A cells stimulated with 1,000 U/ml of either IFN-α2b or -γ for 16 h after being stably transfected with indicated variants (green: variants reported to be loss-of-function in in vitro assays, blue: variants found in-house, red: patient). The specific response to IFN stimulation was calculated by the ratio of further suggesting that it is deleterious (Kircher et al., 2014; Itan et al., 2016) . Finally, P's exome showed 6.8% homozygosity, consistent with her parents being first cousins (Belkadi et al., 2016) . Consistently, homozygous nonsynonymous rare variations (minor allele frequency <0.01) were also found in 19 other genes, none of which is a known disease-causing gene. Genes encoding topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A) and 5′-3′ exoribonuclease 2 (XRN2), the only two connected to known primary immunodeficiency (PID) genes in a connectome analysis, carried variants that were missense (Itan et al., 2013) . The only three genes that carried homozygous variations predicted to be loss-of-function were unrelated to PIDs: disheveled binding antagonist of β catenin 2 (DACT2), ENTH domain containing 1 (ENT HD1), and Forssman glycolipid synthase-like protein (GBGT1). Overall, these data suggested that P had AR IRF9 deficiency and that homozygosity for c.991G>A was the most plausible genotype responsible for severe influenza. Population genetics of human IRF9 IRF9 encompasses 9 exons, including eight protein-coding exons (exons 2 through 9; Fig. 1 D) . Although the gene damage index of IRF9 is moderate (1.16), its McDonald-Kreitman neutrality index of 0.088 indicates that it is under negative selection . Consistently, only one nonsynonymous exonic and two intronic variants were found in homozygosity in GnomAD, including whole-exome and whole-genome sequences: c.381G>C:p. Q127H, c.991+119T>G, and c.991+189C>A, with minor allele frequencies of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.001, respectively. All three variants were present in our in-house WES cohort of 4,892 patients with severe infectious diseases, with the two intronic variants found in the heterozygous state in multiple individuals and the Q127H variant found in the homozygous state in one individual. Only one of the three variants was predicted to alter protein sequence and may therefore impact IRF9 function. The latter two mutations occur in an intron, are not predicted to create a splice site, and actually do not create a splice site (data not shown). The Q127H allele exists in our cohort in the homozygous state in an individual who suffered from a nonviral infection of the brain. Furthermore, analysis of our in-house WES cohort revealed a third homozygous nonsynonymous variation in IRF9, c.874C>T:p.R292C, which was not found in public databases ( Fig. 1 C) . The individual harboring this variant also possessed a homozygous mutation in HOIL1 that underlied chronic autoinflammation, invasive bacterial infections, and muscular amylopectinosis, and he also experienced profound human cytomegalovirus viremia . Homozygosity for any of the three exonic nonsynonymous variants (Q127H, R292C, and c.991G>A) is predicted to affect <1/10,000 individuals, which is not more common than severe influenza. The CADD scores of these three variants were all above the mutation sig-nificance cutoff, indicating that they may impact the function of IRF9 (Fig. 1 C ; Itan et al., 2016) . We therefore set out to assess the consequences of P's variant on IRF9 function (c.991G>A), as well as the two other IRF9 missense alleles found in homozygosity in other, rare individuals from the general population (Q127H) or our in-house cohort (R292C). Expression of a truncated mRNA and protein by the mutant IRF9 allele Because the c.991G>A mutation occurs at an essential splice site at the terminal nucleotide of exon 7, we hypothesized that it would produce an aberrantly spliced transcript. We thus transiently transfected a segment of P's allele encompassing introns 5 through 8, as well as a segment from an identical region of a WT allele, into IRF9-deficient U2A fibrosarcoma cells, a gift from S. Pellegrini (Institut Pasteur, Cytokine Signaling Unit, INS ERM, Paris, France; Fig. S2 ; John et al., 1991) . Sequencing of the resulting cDNAs revealed two transcripts produced from P's IRF9 allele ( Fig. 1 E) . The dominant transcript exhibited absence of exon 7 with normal exons 6 and 8. The second, minor transcript also lacked exon 7 but used an alternative splice acceptor site in exon 8. The segment from a WT allele, however, produced four different transcripts. One transcript demonstrating correct splicing at exons 6/7 and 7/8 junctions and a second transcript lacking exon 7 but correctly using the splice sites in exons 6 and 8 were the dominant products. Two rare transcripts were also observed: one was a product of an alternative splice acceptor site in intron 5, whereas another resulted from an alternative splice acceptor site in exon 7 ( Fig. 1 E) . Only correctly spliced transcripts were observed in healthy control B-LCLs (EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines) and SV40 large T antigen immortalized fibroblasts (F-SV40 cells), suggesting that the two alternative transcripts observed in the overexpression setting are not present endogenously. Moreover, cDNA sequencing of P's B-LCLs and F-SV40 cells did not reveal any transcript that would result in a D331N variant protein, as all transcripts lacked exon 7 ( Fig. 1 F) . This mutant transcript (and the corresponding allele) will thus hereafter be referred to as IRF9-Δex7, as the deletion is in-frame and does not introduce a premature stop codon. Next, we evaluated IRF9 expression in P's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and F-SV40 cells. Consistent with the results of our cDNA sequencing, only IRF9 transcripts lacking exon 7 were detected in P's PBMCs, and a reduced number of full-length IRF9 transcripts were detected in both individuals harboring the c.991G>A mutation in proportion to the dosage of this allele (Fig. 2 A) . By Western blotting (WB), a polyclonal antibody detected a truncated IRF9 species in both P's cells and those of her mother, whereas full-length IRF9 was not detected in P's cells (Fig. 2 B) . The molecular weight of this truncated protein is roughly 12 kD lower than WT IRF9, consistent with a lack of exon 7 (142 amino acids), which forms a substantial portion of firefly luciferase reporter gene activity to constitutively expressed renilla luciferase activity (RLU, relative luciferase ratio). Representative results of three independent experiments are shown. (G) EMSA analysis of ISRE and GAS binding by IFN-stimulated B-LCLs from three healthy controls (C1, C2, and C3), the IRF9-deficient patient (IRF9 −/− ), her mother (IRF9 +/− ), a STAT1-deficient patient (STAT1 −/− ), a STAT2-deficient patient (STAT2 −/− ), and an IRF7-deficient patient (IRF7 −/− ). Representative results of three independent experiments are shown. the IRF association domain (IAD) where STAT proteins interact with IRF9 ( Fig. 1 D) . Overall, these findings showed that the patient had AR IRF9 deficiency.
