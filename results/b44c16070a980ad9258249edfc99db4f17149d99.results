ColorPhylo is tested on two biological applications: the first one refers to a published ornithological study, 20 the second one is related to the analysis of genomic signatures (DNA sequences characterised by oligonucleotide frequencies). It has to be remembered that, on the one hand we study specified knowledge (or analysis results) related to a given dataset (here, birds' geographical positionfirst example-and oligonucleotide counts-second example-) and on the other hand, a taxonomy (the tree) of these data is available. In the present paper, we aim to display the taxonomy and the knowledge together. The procedure described in section 2 provides a taxonomic color-code used here to color geographic position of birds or genomic signatures. Application to the work of E. Bellemain and co-authors: linking geographical distribution and phylogenetic data for bananaquit birds Bellemain and co-authors performed a phylogenetic analysis of bananaquit birds (Coereba flaveola) caught in various places in Latin America and Caribbean islands. 20 Geographical positions of catching sites are displayed (in their Fig. 1 ) and the genetic analyses led to two phylogenetic trees (their Figs. 2 and 3) . Relationships between geographical origin of birds and taxonomy are discussed, and conclusions about the evolutionary history are made. Despite that this work has been successfully achieved without the help of any visualisation tool, a coloring based on the taxonomic tree would have considerably helped these authors. In the following, ColorPhylo is used to assign a color to each bird according to its position in the taxonomic Saturation Hue Figure 4 . hSB colorimetric 2D sub-space (Brightness is set to 1). tree (based on combined mitochondrial data, Figure 2 in) . 20 Here, edge lengths (provided by the phylogenetic analysis) are known and used (see section 2.2, subsection I). Birds are displayed as colored dots, positioned on the map on their catching site (Fig. 5) . Dot coloring allows easy observation of the genetic groups: Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico (green dots), Bahamas and Quintana Roo (orange dots), continent (purple dots), and Greater Antilles except Puerto Rico (red dots) as well as smaller relationships within groups. We performed the analysis on the same dataset, according to the Fua et al 5,6 coloring method (Fig. 6) . It must be pointed out that the interactive local stretching and compression of the LUT-an essential feature of the Fua et al method-cannot be implemented here (obviously impracticable on a printed document!). For that reason, a comparison between ColorPhylo and the Fua et al algorithm from the present figures exclusively would be highly unfair. However, there are noticeable differences between Figures 5 and 6 . A high diversity in the population of birds from Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico could be inferred from figure 6 right insert, whereas it is not supported in fact by the evolutionary tree (Fig. 6 , left insert). Moreover, the high difference between birds
