The exposed cohort was primarily composed of 65% (93 of 144) NHW children who were insured privately and had a median household income of greater than or equal to $40,000/y (Table E1 ). There were no significant differences between the ASM-exposed and ASM-unexposed groups in the types of viral pathogens isolated during the initial bronchiolitis event. There was no significant difference in the severity of initial bronchiolitis event (intensive care unit admission and intubation) (Table E2) . Although statistical power was low, we performed an exploratory analysis in different racial/ethnic groups and found an adjusted HR above 1.00 for all 3 major groups: NHW 1.07 (95% CI, 0.69-1.66), NHB 1.34 (95% CI, 0.65-2.79), and Hispanics 2.16 (95% CI, 1.07-4.39); the excess risk among Hispanics with prenatal exposure to ASM was statistically significant (P interaction Â¼ .045).
