During the investigation period, sputum samples from both infectious and preceding non-infectious states were obtained in 15 episodes from 7 patients. The median sampling interval between the non-infectious and infectious states was 7 weeks (2e64 weeks). The characteristics of the patients on the development of LRTI are shown in Supplementary Table 1 . Antimicrobial agents were administrated to all patients based on the suspicion of bacterial infection. All patients improved after the administration of the appropriate treatments. Viruses were only detected from 3 non-infectious samples (20%), and were detected in12 infectious samples (80%) ( Table 1) ; the difference in the proportion of detection in the infectious and non-infectious state was statistically significant (OR, 9.00; 95% CI, 1.14e71.03; P Z 0.014). The bacterial cell counts in sputum samples obtained in infectious (median, 1.8 Â 10 7 cells/mL; range, 8.0 Â 10 5 e6.0 Â 10 8 ) and non-infectious (median, 2.4 Â 10 7 cells/mL; range, 1.4 Â 10 5 e6.8 Â 10 7 ) states did not differ to a statistically significant extent ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The Simpson index values of samples obtained in the infectious state were lower than those of the samples obtained in the non-infectious state in 11 of the 15 episodes (73.3%), indicating that the bacteria in sputum tended to show less diversity on the development of LRTI (Table 2 ). In both the infectious and non-infectious states, the top three bacteria detected by the clone library analysis were not always identified by culturing. The proportion of concordance between the two methods was 66.7% and 60.0% in the infectious and non-infectious states, respectively (Supplementary Table 2 ). In particular, P. aeruginosa was detected in most of the culture, whereas it was rarely detected as top three bacteria in the clone library analysis. In most cases, the predominant bacterium detected by the clone library analysis in the samples obtained in the infectious state was not consistent with the predominant bacterium detected in the non-infectious state (Supplementary Table 2 ). However, when Haemophilus influenzae was detected as the predominant bacterium in the non-infectious samples, the same bacterium tended to be predominant in the samples obtained in the subsequent infectious state (4 of 5 episodes) (Supplementary Table 2 ).
