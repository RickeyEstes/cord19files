We estimated that between 2009 and 2013, the selected 31 infectious diseases accounted for 7,577 cases per 100,000 population per year (95% UI: 6,445-8,141) and there were 9.67 deaths per 100,000 population annually (95% UI: 8.47-10.3) ( Table 2 ). Figure 1 ). These four top-ranking infections accounted for 78% of the total burden of communicable diseases in EU/EEA countries. Legionnaires' disease, campylobacteriosis and hepatitis B had a significantly lower burden compared to the The error bars indicate the 95% uncertainty intervals. four diseases discussed above. Invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease, invasive meningococcal disease, chlamydia, salmonellosis, pertussis and Shiga toxin/ verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC/VTEC) infection had an even lower burden. The remaining diseases were ranked with a significantly lower burden. YLL accounted for 71% of the total burden ( Figure  2 ). Diseases with higher incidence and mortality as compared with other diseases were found to be influenza, campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis ( Figure 3 ), although only the former has a high burden in DALYs. Pertussis and chlamydia have high incidence and low mortality, whereas TB, HIV/AIDS, IPD, Legionnaires' disease, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease (IHID) had low incidence and high mortality.
