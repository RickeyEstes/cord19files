A total of 80 patients older than 18 years old fulfilling the WHO criteria of probable SARS were admitted during that period. Two patients transferred to other hospitals were excluded. Seventyeight patients, of which 61 were laboratory confirmed SARS, were analysed. No statistical differences were detected between the laboratory confirmed and the laboratory test negative groups in terms of demographic characteristics, clinical features, biochemical and haematological tests, and clinical outcomes. No patient in the laboratory test negative group had diarrhoea, as compared to 11 (18%) patients in the laboratory confirmed group, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (pZ0.053). As both groups were similar in clinical features, laboratory features and outcomes, they were combined for all subsequent analysis.
