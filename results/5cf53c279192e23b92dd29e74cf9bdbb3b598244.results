Approximately 13.8Â±0.9 (12-16) hours were required to transport animals from the market of origin (Benapole LCM) to the market of destination (Sagorika LCM) by road (truck). During this period enormous changes were observed in terms of animal physical health, frequency of injuries and haemato-biochemical changes. occurrence of physical injuries About 26 per cent (n=100) of the cattle had injuries on different body parts that were recorded in the market of origin (Benapole LCM). However, the frequency of injuries increased significantly after long-distance transportation to the destination market (47 per cent; n=100) (Sagorika LCM) (P<0.001). types of injury and their frequency distribution (before and after transportation) Six different types of injury were recorded in the studied animals. They included abrasion, laceration, swelling, scarification, barbed wire injury and bone fracture. In almost all cases the frequency of injury by type increased after transportation, where the occurrence of abrasion, laceration and barbed wire injury significantly increased after transportation ( Table 2 ). The overall frequency of injuries increased after transportation, but singletype injury significantly increased after transportation (P<0.001) ( Table 2) . Images of types of injury in different body parts of the animals are presented in Fig 2. Frequency distribution of injury by location in cattle (before and after transportation) Injury in different anatomical locations of animals increased after transportation, but the difference was not significant (Table 3) .
