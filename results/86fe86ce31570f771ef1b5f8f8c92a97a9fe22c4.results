In all, 461 and 1,043 patients who had RVP and RPP testing, respectively, were identified and screened for study inclusion. Of these, 110 (26.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 22.6 to 31.1) and 234 (26.0%; 95% CI, 23.2 to 29; P ϭ 0.808) were admitted patients tested positive and were included in the RVP and RPP groups, respectively, for the primary analysis (Fig. 1) For patients with normal imaging, the proportion that received antibiotics before their test resulted in the EMR was lower in the RPP-positive group than in the RVP-positive group (54.7% [95% CI, 38.8 to 69.7] and 96.8% [95% CI, 79.7 to 99.6], respectively; P ϭ 0.007). For patients with abnormal chest imaging, the proportion that received antibiotics before their test resulted was lower in the RPP-positive group than the RVP-positive group (81.6% [95% CI, 73.9 to 87.4] and 100%, respectively; P Ͻ 0.001). 2B ). Of patients who had influenza A or B, 88.5% in the RVP group and 90.3% in the RPP group received oseltamivir (P ϭ 0.78). No allergic reactions to antibiotics were observed in either group, and there were no significant differences in positive C. difficile testing, 30-day hospital readmission, or death during hospitalization (Table 4 ).
