The total number of reported cases during the study period was 835 cases. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of all laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases. Males were more commonly affected than females (63.2% versus 36.8%). The vast majority of patients were between 25-54 years (52%) or ≥65 years (23.4%) of age. HCWs comprised 25.1% of the cases. Health Care workers were younger than the other patients (mean age 38.9 ± 11.6 vs 52.7 ± 20.3 years, respectively, p value < 0.001). Saudis comprised 63.2% of the cases. Although MERS-CoV cases were reported from virtually all regions of the country, about two thirds of the cases were reported from Riyadh (29.9%) and Jeddah (28.7%). After the first 2 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in 2012, the number of reported cases ranged between 1-27 cases per month. This rate continued till March 2014 when 53 cases were reported in that month followed by a more dramatic increase in the number of cases in the following month (April 2014) when the number of cases reached up to 317 cases in one month. Emergency investigations and control measures coordinated by the Ministry of Health led to a sharp decline in the number of reported cases to 150 cases in May 2014 and further down to 29 cases in June 2014. Since then, the number of reported cases returned back to its previous rate (Fig. 1) . The basic reproductive number was 0.9. Hospitalization associated with the MERS-CoV was estimated to be 2 per 100,000 population. The median duration between the onset of clinical symptoms and presentation to hospitals was 2 days with an interquartile range (IQR) of 0-5 days. HCWs presented to hospitals earlier than non−HCWs (2 versus 3 days, respectively, p = 0.001). The median length of hospital stay was 14 days ( Table 2 ). The length of stay among non−HCWs was significantly more than that among HCWs (15 versus 12 days, respectively, p = 0.023). Table 3 shows the case fatality rate by year from 2012 to 2014. The overall case fatality rate was 43.2%. The highest case fatality rate was observed in the first 2 years (60% for 2012 and 51.5% for 2013) which decreased to 36.9% in 2014 when more cases were reported during the outbreak in 2014. Table 4 shows the case fatality rate by age groups and age-specific mortality rate per 100,000 population. Table 5 shows the results of the multivariable logistic regression analysis for patients' characteristics associated with mortality.
