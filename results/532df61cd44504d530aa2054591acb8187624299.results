Serological tests were carried out on 97 283 pigs, from 5744 traditional farms (out of 6409 registered) in the ASFV endemic area in Nuoro, from October 1994 through March 1996. In traditional farms, 9.84% of pigs that were examined tested positive for ASFV 2. The 1Zmonth moving average of the percentage of ASFV + farms is shown in Fig.  1 . There was a significant negative time trend in the percentage of ASFV + farms (9 = 5.7-0.22 . MONTH, R2 = 0.43, P < 0.01). The within-farm seroprevalence differed significantly among farm types (Kruskal-Wallis H = 12.2, 2 d.f., P < 0.005, Table   1 ). The likelihood ratio test for the logistic regression model was significant (likelihood ratio x2 = 1015.3, d.f. = 6, P < 0.001; Table 2 ). The interaction between farm type and MONTH (likelihood ratio x 2 = 4 79, d.f. = 2, P < 0.10) was included in the final . model. In fact, the decrease in the risk of infection over time was greater for partial-confinement than for total-confinement farms (Wald's x2 = 3.81, P < 0.06), while the risk for free-range and partial-confinement farms had similar time trends (Wald's x2 = 0.091, P > 0.1). Estimated OR's for the comparisons among farm types (controlling for MONTH) are shown in Table 3 .
