Between Jan 13, 2011, and March 2, 2015, a total of 113 participants were screened for the study (figure 1). 15 participants were excluded: eight did not have a positive test for influenza, two were judged unable to tolerate a 500 mL volume, two had blood types for which ABO-compatible plasma was not available, and three were excluded for other reasons. 20 (69%) of the 29 participating sites enrolled at least one participant into the trial. Enrolment was stopped in March 6, 2015, at the end of the influenza season, after the study size was within two participants of the enrolment goals. 98 participants were randomly assigned. 11 participants were excluded from the primary efficacy population because their initial samples were PCR negative by central laboratory testing or missing. The median age of the patients who were randomly assigned to a treatment group was 53 years (range 0-95 years). 11 children and two pregnant women were enrolled (table 1) . Most participants had underlying medical conditions, with hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease being the most common (medical conditions present in ≥10% of participants are shown in table 1). Participants had a median 4 days of influenza illness before enrolment, and 61% (n=60) had received antivirals (59 received oseltamivir and one received oseltamivir and zanamivir) before randomisation (median 2 days [IQR 2-4] of antivirals before enrolment). No participants received naproxen, and only six participants received azithromycin. At baseline, 79 (82%) of the 96 participants who had a case report form required oxygen, 56 (58%) were in the ICU, and 41 (43%) were on mechanical ventilation (table 2) . Adults had a median APACHE II score of 13, reflecting an anticipated 15% mortality, 7 whereas children had a median PRISM III score of 3 reflecting an anticipated 2% mortality. 8 The participants randomly assigned to receive standard care had slightly more severe illness at baseline compared with those who assigned to plasma ( 45 (92%) of 49 participants randomly assigned to the plasma treatment group received the full planned treatment. Four participants (8%) randomly assigned to receive plasma did not actually receive plasma (figure 1). One paediatric participant randomly assigned to standard care was inadvertently administered plasma. For participants who received plasma, the first unit of plasma was administered at a median of 3·9 h (IQR 2·4-6·1) after randomisation, with a median 2·5 h (1·7-3·4) between units. 86 [99%] of 87 participants received antivirals (84 [97%] received oseltamivir monotherapy, one [1%] received zanamivir, and one [1%] received oseltamivir and zanamivir). All participants received antibiotics (the protocol did not dictate which antibiotics would be used). 28 (67%) of 42 participants randomly assigned to receive plasma had documented resolution of tachypnoea and hypoxia by day 28 compared with 24 (53%) of 45 control participants (p=0·069; figure 2A ). The HR of plasma and standard of care versus standard of care alone was 1·71 (95% CI 0·96-3·06). From the Kaplan-Meier analysis, with the caveat that the study evaluated tachypnoea and hypoxia at days 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28 (and not every day), the estimated median time to resolution of tachypnoea and hypoxia was 7 days (lower quartile 2 days) among participants randomly assigned to receive plasma versus 28 days (lower quartile 7 days) among participants randomly assigned to the standard care group. Due to the higher than expected loss to follow-up, sensitivity analysis was done with follow-up censored at last available assessment with sufficient Median NEW score (n=87) † 6 (4-9) 6 (4-9) 6 (4-9) Median SOFA score (n=87) † 4·5 (2·0-8·0) 6 (3-12) 5 (2-10)
