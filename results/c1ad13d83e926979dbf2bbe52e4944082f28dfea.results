The ability of cis-acting RNA structures or trans-acting 2 0 -O-Methyl antisense oligonucleotides to induce ribosomal frameshifting was determined by in vitro transcription and translation of a dual luciferase reporter vector, p2Luc. p2Luc contains the Renilla and firefly luciferase genes on either side of a multiple cloning site, and can be transcribed using the T7 promoter located upstream of the Renilla luciferase gene (45) . Sequences containing shift-prone sites were cloned between the two reporter genes such that the downstream firefly luciferase gene is in the +1 reading frame. The resulting constructs were then transcribed and translated in vitro with or without complementary cis-Acting stimulators of frameshifting at the antizyme shift site Initially, three dual luciferase reporter vectors were generated containing the human antizyme 1 frameshift cassette (p2luc-AZ1wt) with the 5 0 and 3 0 stimulators of frameshifting, with the pseudoknot deleted (p2luc-AZ1PKdel), or replaced with a stem-loop (p2luc-AZ1hp) (Figure 1 ). Each constructs was then subjected to coupled transcription and translation reactions in the presence of increasing amounts of spermidine, and the 35 S-labeled products separated by SDS-PAGE. Table 2 ). Maximal levels of frameshifting were found to occur when 2-4 mM of antisense oligonucleotide was added to the transcription/translation reactions (Supplementary Table 3 ). In the presence of 0.4 mM exogenous spermidine, highly efficient shifting of ribosomes into the +1 reading frame (higher than that observed in the wild-type antizyme frameshift cassette) was observed with the addition of AZ1A (26.1%), AZ1B (51.8%) and AZ1C (31.8%) (Supplementary Table 2 ). The most efficient frameshifting is observed with the antisense oligonucleotide AZ1B which anneals such that spacing between the shift site and the beginning of the duplex region is the same as that observed between the shift site and the beginning of stem 1 of the natural antizyme 3 0 pseudoknot structure (i.e. each has a 3 nt spacer). To verify that the antisense oligonucleotide was activating ribosomal frameshifting and not transcription slippage, RNA was transcribed from p2luc-AZ1PKdel in the absence of oligonucleotide and added to reticulocyte lysate translations in the presence of increasing amounts of 2 0 -O-Methyl AZ1B oligonucleotide. Frameshifting levels were increased to the same level as that observed in coupled transcription and translation reactions demonstrating that the oligonucleotide acts to induce frameshifting during translation (Supplementary Figure) . Surprisingly, the addition of AZ1A (0 spacer) also induced high-level frameshifting into the À1 reading frame in a manner which was modestly inhibited by the addition of spermidine (19% in the absence and 10% in the presence of 0.4 mM exogenous spermidine) ( Figure 3A and Supplementary Table 2 ). No À1 frameshift product was observed when the wild-type antizyme cassette was examined in the absence of antisense oligonucleotide addition (Figure 2 ; AZwt). As the AZ1A antisense oligonucleotide was designed to anneal directly adjacent to the UGA codon of the shift site, it was of interest to determine whether the wild-type antizyme pseudoknot could induce À1 frameshifting when located in the equivalent position. To address this, a new construct p2luc-AZ1-0sp ( Figure 1A ) was made by deleting the 3 nt spacer between the pseudoknot and the shift site of p2luc-AZ1wt. In this case, the wild-type pseudoknot is directly 3 0 adjacent to the shift site. The products of in vitro transcription and translation were separated by SDS-PAGE. No À1 frameshift product was observed and levels of the +1 frameshift product were significantly reduced to $3% ( Figure 3D and Supplementary Table 2) . AZ1A, AZ1B and AZ1C were designed to complement RNA sequences encoded by the originating vector. To determine if duplexes formed between the antisense oligonucleotide and 3 0 adjacent antizyme sequences would result in more efficient frameshift stimulation, reporter vectors were designed to contain a portion of the antizyme 3 0 stimulator. Construct p2luc-AZ1PKm1 contains sequences from the 5 0 half of the axis formed by the stacking of stem 1 and stem 2 of the pseudoknot ( Figure 1A) . Two complementary 2 0 -O-Methyl antisense oligonucleotides were designed. First, PKm1 has perfect complimentarity to the region starting 3 nt and ending 21 nt downstream of the UGA shift site codon. Second, PKm2 is the same except that a mispaired C and bulged A were located at positions 9 and 16, respectively. These two alterations were included to more closely mimic the natural pseudoknot which also contains a mispaired C and bulged A at equivalent positions along the extended stem formed by the stacking of pseudoknot stems 1 and 2 ( Figure 1 ; compare p2luc-AZ1wt with the duplex formed between p2luc-PKm1 and antisense oligonucleotide PKm2). PKm1 and PKm2 induced 30 and 22% frameshifting, respectively, when added to coupled transcription and translation reactions of p2luc-AZ1PKm1 in the presence spermidine ( Figure 4A and B, and Supplementary Table 4 ). Neither PKm1 nor Pkm2 induced frameshifting to the same levels seen with AZ1B, suggesting that the sequence content of the duplex region can affect the efficiency of frameshift stimulation and that native antizyme sequences are not required. A second construct, p2luc-AZ1sl, was designed to contain only the 5 0 half of stem 1 of the antizyme pseudoknot downstream from the UCC UGA shift site ( Figure 1A ). 2 0 -O-Methyl antisense oligonucleotides were designed to anneal between 3 and 15 nt (SL1) or 3 and 22 nt (SL2) downstream from the UGA codon of the shift site. Frameshift efficiency induced by these two antisense oligonucleotides, 8 and 22% respectively, was somewhat lower than that observed with PKm1 and PKm2 ( Figure 4C and D and Supplementary Table 4 ). In these cases frameshift efficiency was higher for the longer antisense oligonucleotide (SL2), suggesting that frameshift efficiency most probably correlates with stability of the duplex. As was seen with AZ1A, AZ1B and AZ1C, frameshifting efficiency stimulated by antisense oligonucleotides PKm1, PKm2, SL1 and SL2 was also strongly correlated with the concentration of exogenously added spermidine (Supplementary Table 5) .
