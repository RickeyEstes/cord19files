A total of 999 participants (697 children, 302 adults) were eligible for inclusion in this study (Fig. 2) . Subjects were primarily children 5-17 years old, female, and approximately 12% had a chronic respiratory condition (Table 1) . Approximately half were vaccinated for influenza each study season (Table 1) ; most were vaccinated in autumn (Fig. 3) . Vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals had no difference in household size, number of school-aged children per household, gender, or chronic respiratory conditions. There was also no difference in the time to sampling after symptom onset. Rate of vaccination was higher among the youngest (range from 54.0 to 60.2% across the three study seasons) and oldest (54.0-69.1%) participants compared to those 5-17 (42.2-49.5%) and 18-49 years (45.6-52.3%). Among vaccinated individuals, 15.9%, 19.5%, and 13.3% received the live attenuated influenza vaccine during the three study seasons respectively. Approximately one third of participants experienced at least one ARI during each study season (30.8-34 .5%); however, only 1.9-3.0% of vaccinated participants experienced an ARI while in the post-vaccination risk period. The frequency of ARI during each exposure status is shown in Table 1 . Frequency distribution of date of onset of ARI and date of vaccination are shown in Fig. 3 . In 2013-2014, the most prevalent type of influenza was influenza B, followed by influenza A H1-2009, influenza A H3. In 2014-2015, the most prevalent type of influenza was influenza A H3, followed by influenza B. In 2015-2016, the most prevalent type of influenza was influenza B, followed by influenza A H1-2009, and influenza A H3. The distributions were similar among unvaccinated and vaccinated periods. Throughout all study seasons, the most prevalent non-influenza ARI pathogens detected were rhinovirus/enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronaviruses. The distributions were similar among vaccinated and unvaccinated periods. The hazard of laboratory-confirmed influenza in individuals during the 14-days post-vaccination was similar to unvaccinated individuals in the same period in time. This was observed in each study season and in the three seasons combined ( Table 2 ). The hazard of ARI caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens was higher in individuals during the 14-days post-vaccination compared to unvaccinated individuals in the same period in time. This was observed in two of the three study seasons and with the three seasons combined. The hazard of ARI caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens in vaccinated individuals (>14 days) was also higher than unvaccinated individuals in the same period, over the three study seasons. The hazard of ARI caused by noninfluenza respiratory pathogens in individuals during the 14-days post-vaccination was similar to that in vaccinated individuals (>14 days) during each study season and with the three seasons combined ( Table 2 ). The hazard of ARI symptoms without detected pathogens was similar in individuals during the 2-day postvaccination risk period compared to unvaccinated individuals in the same period in time. This was observed during each study season and with the three seasons combined. The hazard of ARI symptoms without detected pathogens in vaccinated individuals (>2 days) was higher than unvaccinated individuals in the same period for one study season and with the three seasons combined ( Table 2) . After stratification for age, for children <18 years, the hazard of ARI caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens remained higher in children during the 14-day post-vaccination risk period compared to unvaccinated children in the same period (aHR 1.71, 95% CI [1.16, 2.53] in the three seasons combined); the hazard was also higher in vaccinated children compared to unvaccinated children in the same period (aHR 1.55, 95% CI [1.22, 1.96] in the three seasons combined). However, for adults !18 years the hazard in adults during the post-vaccination risk period was similar to unvaccinated adults (aHR 0.88, 95% CI [0.21, 3.69] in the three seasons combined); the hazard was also similar in vaccinated adults compared to unvaccinated adults in the same period (aHR 0.95, 95% CI [0.53, 1.71] in the three seasons combined). A sensitivity analysis performed including only children who ultimately received the influenza vaccine also revealed an increased hazard of ARI caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens in the 14day post-vaccination risk period compared to children who were not yet vaccinated in the same period (aHR 2.02, 95% CI [1.31, 3.12] in the three seasons combined); the hazard was also higher in vaccinated children compared to not yet vaccinated children in the same period (aHR 1.73, 95% CI [1.22, 2.47] in the three seasons combined). Among only adults who received the influenza vaccine there were no significant differences in the hazard of ARI caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens. In a sensitivity analysis performed excluding individuals who received the intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine, hazard ratio estimates were similar to those in the analysis including all individuals. There were no episodes of influenza ARI associated with the live attenuated influenza vaccine. After excluding the two days following vaccination from the 14-day risk period there were no significant differences in the hazard of ARI caused by influenza or noninfluenza respiratory pathogens. Potential associations between participant characteristics and seasonality and ARI outcomes were also evaluated ( Table 3) . Children 4 years and children 5-17 years had higher hazards of noninfluenza respiratory pathogens throughout the study seasons compared to adults !50 years old. Those with chronic respiratory conditions had higher hazard of non-influenza pathogens and higher hazard of ARI symptoms without detectable pathogens compared to those without chronic respiratory conditions. Winter and spring were associated with higher hazard of influenza when compared to autumn. The hazard of non-influenza pathogens was similar among the seasons and the hazard of symptoms without a detectable pathogen was higher in spring compared to autumn and winter.
