Identification of Cytosolic 59 (39)-deoxyribonucleotidase (cdN, dNT-1) as an Interactive Protein of HCV NS3 Protein by Yeast Two-hybrid Screening HCV NS3 protein was used as the bait for yeast two-hybrid screening for the identification of cellular proteins that interact with NS3 protein. Only one cDNA clone, which encoded a truncated cdN protein without its N-terminal 44 amino acids, was found to interact with the NS3 protein out of a total of 1610 6 transformants. To further identify the interactive domains of cdN protein with NS3 protein, we also conducted deletion-mapping experiments. As shown in Fig. 1 (panels A and B) , the middle region of cdN protein (a.a. 66-109) interacted with the protease domain of NS3 protein (Fig. 1E) . Several negative controls were included to assure the specificity of this assay, and a.a. 846 to 1008 of ELKS-dprotein (a domain known to interact with HCV NS3) [10] was served as the positive control ( Fig. 1 C, D) . Indeed, a.a. 846 to 1008 of ELKS-dprotein could interact with the NS3 protease domain and no non-specific interactions was observed in the negative controls (Fig. 1F ).
