From the GWAS database including 2.5 million SNPs, we extracted all SNPs within the genomic region of the CR1 gene on chromosome 1 (n Â¼ 73). Fig. 1 shows the CR1 gene structure with the location of the investigated SNPS. Strong LD is present within the genomic region of CR1 leading to the occurrence of two haploblocks as shown in Fig. 1 . All SNPs were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.05). During follow-up, 12.7% of the patients developed a fatal or nonfatal MI, 4.8% experienced fatal or nonfatal stroke, 5.3% died from cardiovascular disease and the overall mortality was 11.7%. Twelve of the 73 investigated CR1 SNPs were significantly associated with the risk of fatal or nonfatal MI. These SNPs, and their corresponding odds ratio for MI with 95% confidence intervals, are depicted in Fig. 2A . The minor allele frequency of the CR1 SNPs rs3886100, rs2274566, rs11118157, rs6691117, rs7519119, rs7542544, rs11803956, rs12041437, rs12034383 and rs11803366 was associated with a decreased risk of coronary artery disease, while the minor allele frequency of SNPs rs10127904 and rs17259038 was associated with increased risk. Seven out of 10 SNPs associated with decreased risk of MI, were also associated with lower levels of CRP. Hence, the two SNPs associated with an increased risk of MI showed an association with higher CRP levels, although not statistically significant. The 12 SNPs were not associated with leukocyte count or levels of interleukin-6 (data not shown). The global p-value for the tail strength method to control for multiple testing was 0.0489, implying that the null hypothesis of no associated SNPs can be rejected. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows the association of the investigated SNPs with vascular and all-cause mortality and with fatal and nonfatal stroke. In line with the results for risk of MI, SNPs rs3886100 and rs2274566 were associated with decreased risk of vascular and all-cause mortality, while SNPs rs10127904 and rs17259038 were associated with increased vascular and all-cause mortality. SNPs rs7542544, rs11803956, rs12041437 and rs12034383 were associated with decreased vascular mortality, but not with all-cause mortality. None of the investigated SNPs was associated with risk of stroke. Further adjustments for smoking, diabetes, hypertension, average LDL cholesterol during follow-up, history of MI, history of stroke, and log-transformed CRP did not materially change the results (data not shown).
