All results are presented as the average of two or three independent tests. For oxidative pyrolysis, PVC carpet had mass loss of 45.9% and well-ventilated had mass loss of 76.9%, while underventilated had mass loss of 66.4%. Combustion in the well-ventilated tests is complete, as PVC carpet contain about 24 wt.% inorganic residue. In the pyrolysis tests about 30%, and in underventilated tests about 10% of combustible material remained. The major combustion products CO, CO 2 , and HCl are presented in Fig. 1A . The CO 2 /CO ratio in the under-ventilated tests shows a lower ratio, compared to well-ventilated tests, and thus less complete combustion. This was supported by the unquantified observation of the presence of methane and other hydrocarbons in the FTIR spectra. From the elemental analysis, the maximum possible yield for HCl is 0.3 g g À1 and for CO 2 is 1.42 g g À1 . This means that the recovery of chlorine as HCl was around 95% in these tests. The high yield (i.e. greater than theoretically possible) of HCl in the pyrolysis experiments can be explained by the fact that chlorine is degraded and emitted as HCl at a lower temperature compared to the thermal degradation of the hydrocarbon backbone of the PVC material (Stec and Hull, 2010) . In the oxidative pyrolysis tests, where material is degraded without flames, lower yields for all fire gases are found. Total soot, based on the gravimetric analysis, is shown in Fig. 1B . The absolute total production of particles, on a mass basis, was about the same for the oxidative pyrolysis and well-ventilated fire scenario and around 10 times lower for the large under-ventilated scenario. Fig. 2A shows the average of particle size distributions, taken from three tests for each fire scenarios, expressed as relative mass for each size fraction. Results are presented in terms of the aerodynamic diameter using a log scale on the X-axis.
