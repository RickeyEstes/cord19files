Of the 1402 viral isolates sampled between 1997 and 2007 that are included in this analysis, 119 (8.5%) exhibited the S31N mutation in the M2 protein conferring resistance to adamantane antiviral drugs. In Australia and New Zealand, 6.2% (39 / 629) of isolates were resistant to adamantane drugs, 4.5% (22 / 492) of the isolates from New York State, USA were adamantane resistant, and 20.6% (58 / 281) of Hong Kong isolates were resistant (Supplementary Tables 1-3). In the years prior to the global proliferation of adamantane resistance viruses associated the emergence of the 'Nlineage' in early 2005 , the overall prevalence of adamantane resistance in our data set was 3.0% (38 / 1250): 11.0% (27 / 246) Phylogenetic analysis of the M1/2 segment of A/H3N2 influenza virus isolates collected from Hong Kong, New York State, Australia, and New Zealand reveals at least 11 independent introductions (i.e., 11 separate clades) of the S31N mutation between the years 1997 and 2007 ( Fig. 1, Table 1 ). This estimate is conservative, as clusters of genetically related resistant isolates are regarded as a single introduction of the S31N replacement even though it is possible (although less parsimonious) that the mutation arose independently among these isolates rather than through viral transmission. The first introduction of S31N that is observed in these data occurred in Hong Kong in 1997 (isolate A/Hong Kong/CUHK4245/ 1997, Introduction #1, Fig. 1 , Table 1 ). Notably, this isolate is involved in a reassortment event, as A/Hong Kong/CUHK4245/ 1997 is related to a clade of A/Wuhan/359/1995-like isolates in the HA tree (shaded in blue, Fig. 2 ), but on the M1/2 and NA phylogenies this isolate is closely related to A/Sydney/5/97-like isolates (shaded in pink, Figs. 1 and 3). Such phylogenetic incongruity suggests that a reassortment event involving the M1/ 2 and NA occurred prior to the jump between the Wuhan/95 and Sydney/97 antigenic clusters (Smith et al., 2004) , such that A/ Wuhan/359/1995-like viruses first acquired novel NA and M1/2 segments approximately 10-12 months before acquiring an antigenically divergent A/Sydney/5/1997-like HA. That antigenically similar isolates (based on the HA phylogeny) occupy divergent phylogenetic positions on the M1/2 and NA phylogenies indicates that reassortment involving these three segments has occurred on a regular basis over this decade of sampling . Whereas the evolution of the HA segment is strongly linear and temporally structured (Fig. 2) , reflecting the action of continual selection for antigenic novelty, multiple clades from the same time period occupy highly divergent phylogenetic positions and the NA and M1/2 trees (Figs. 1 and 3), providing a clear signature of reassortment. For example, at least four distinct lineages of A/Sydney/5/1997-like isolates and four distinct lineages of A/Fujian/411/2002-like isolates co-circulate on both the M1/2 and NA phylogenies, as indicated by the phylogenetically divergent clusters of isolates shaded in pink and light green, respectively, on the M1/2 and NA trees ( Figs. 1 and 3) . While the genetic diversity of the HA appears to be restricted at a given time, influenza viruses clearly periodically acquire novel M1/2 and NA segments through reassortment. Notably, isolate A/Hong Kong/CUHK4245/1997 is the only S31N mutant from 1997 in our data set and is related to no other adamantane resistant isolates, compatible with no or limited spread of this virus in this viral population. The second emergence of the S31N substitution involves a A/Sydney/5/1997-like isolate from New York State (A/New York/512/1998, Introduction #2, Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). This introduction involves a single isolate, again indicative of limited or no spread in this population at this level of detection. It is also possible that this introduction represents an instance of within-host evolution of adamantane resistance in response to drug therapy, given that the patient from whom this isolate was collected was 80 years old (Table 1 ) and the elderly routinely receive adamantane drugs in the United States (Cohen et al., 2008; Couch 2000) . Introduction #3 involves two A/Sydney/5/1997-like isolates, A/ New York/315/1999 and A/New York/324/1999, which were collected on January 6, 1999 and January 26, 1999, respectively (Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). To be as conservative as possible in our estimate of independent introductions of the S31N mutation, we regard these two isolates as a single introduction, given the phylogenetic similarity of these two isolates, their geographic and temporal proximity, and the low number of S31N mutations detected at this time. However, it is possible that these S31N both arose de novo and represent independent introductions, rather than being transmitted through a network of New York State viruses not sampled in our study population. Introduction #4 involves another New York State isolate collected in 1999 (A/New York/280/1999). However, as this introduction is associated with a single virus, we again assume that it experienced little or no spread in this population. In fact, no adamantane resistant isolates are detected in any locality during 2000-2001, a period when A/H1N1 influenza viruses were dominant (CDC 2001) . In 2002 the S31N mutation is first detected in Oceania (Introduction #5), involving the two A/Sydney/5/1997-like isolates A/Wellington/71/ 2002 and A/Wellington/79/2002 ( Fig. 1, Table 1 ). Again, given the geographic and temporal proximity of these phylogenetically related isolates, we infer that this occurrence of the S31N mutation has disseminated locally in New Zealand (Table 1) . The first S31N introduction that exhibits possible spread between multiple localities is Introduction #6, which is detected (Table 1) . Introduction #6 also represents the first S31N mutation observed among A/Fujian/411/2002-like viruses. Given the time and distance separating these three isolates, it is possible that each isolate represents a separate introduction of the S31N mutation, although there is insufficient phylogenetic resolution in this section of the M1/2 phylogeny to distinguish between the single versus multiple introductions of these three isolates (Fig. 1) . Again, to be conservative in the number of independent introductions, we suggest that this introduction spread from the summer 2003 epidemic in Australia to the winter 2003-2004 epidemic in New York State (Table 1) . (Holmes et al., 2005) . Although these isolates cluster with A/Fujian/411/2002-like isolates on the HA tree (Fig. 2) , they are members of a clade that is related to older A/Sydney/5/1997-like isolates on both the M1/2 and NA trees (Figs. 1 and 3) Whereas the six previous introductions of the S31N mutation likely exhibit limited spread in time and space, Introduction #7 is continually detected among this viral population for more than 3.5 years (from 07/06/2003 to 03/14/2007) and gives rise to the majority of adamantane resistant isolates in our data set, including the major 'N-lineage' that is associated with the global spread of adamantane resistance that begins in 2005 (Table 1, Fig. 1 ) . This reassortment event is evidenced by the phylogenetic distance on the HA tree between two sets of isolates that are both closely related on the M1/2 tree in association with Introduction #7 (Figs. 2 and 1, respectively) . On the HA tree, one of these sets clearly is A/Fujian/411/2002-like ('#7F', Fig. 2) , while the other is A/ Fig. 2 ). In addition, the four phylogenetically distinct clusters of '#7F' isolates on the HA tree suggest that A/Fujian/411/2002-like isolates may have acquired the #7 S31N introduction through multiple additional reassortment events. The phylogenetic divergence between two clusters of '#7F' isolates is particularly pronounced on the NA tree ('#7F1' and '#7F2', Fig. 3 Supplementary Fig. 1) . Notably, none of the additional global isolates in the 'N-lineage' isolates was sampled prior to the original 03/01/2005 emergence date we identified in Hong Kong. Nor do any of the global background isolates associated with Introduction #7 pre-date its first detection in Hong Kong on 07/06/2003 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 (Figs. 1 and 2) . Two additional introductions of the S31N mutation occur among this adamantane sensitive M1/2 lineage, both involving Fig. 1) . These three isolates are separated by only 8 days and relatively little geographic distance, suggesting limited local spread. Following this last introduction of the S31N mutation in the summer of 2005, all adamantane resistant influenza viruses hereon are associated with the 'N-lineage', strongly suggesting that this clade has a major fitness advantage.
