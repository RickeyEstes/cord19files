A total of 174 cases of NVHAP were identified, and 696 control subjects were selected (Fig 1) Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and 1 each for Moraxella catarrhalis, Citrobacter koseri, and Achromobacter xylosoxidans), and gram-positive bacteria were found in 20 patients (11.5%) (17 S aureus, two beta-hemolytic streptococci group F, and 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae). Among S aureus isolates, nine were methicillin resistant (52.9%), whereas 12 of the gram-negative isolates (48.0%) were resistant to ceftriaxone (representing an antibiotic typically prescribed for pneumonia in patients without risk factors for antibiotic resistance). The mean duration to occurrence of NVHAP was on hospital day 4.2 AE 3.8. Characteristics of case patients and control subjects are listed in Table 1 . Patients with NVHAP were more likely to have higher baseline comorbidity on admission based on the Charlson comorbidity index and to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patient outcomes are shown in Table 2 . Patients with NVHAP were statistically more likely to die during their hospital stay compared with patients without NVHAP (15.5% vs 1.6%; P < .01). Similarly, patients with NVHAP were more likely to require transfer to an ICU (56.3% vs 22.8%; P < .01) and mechanical ventilation (19.0% vs 3.9%; P < .01) and to have a longer hospital length of stay (median, 15.9 vs 4.4 days; P < .01). Thirty-day hospital readmission rates were similar between the two study groups. Adjusted odds ratios by conditional logistic regression for variables evaluated for their association with hospital mortality are presented in Table 3 . NVHAP with an adjusted OR of 8.4 (95% CI, 5.6-2.5) along with mechanical ventilation and increasing Charlson comorbidity scores were associated with a greater risk of hospital mortality. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test suggests that our model fit the data (P Â¼ .76). Mortality was greater for patients with NVHAP stratified by Charlson comorbidity index (Fig 2) .
