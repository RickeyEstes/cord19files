The results of tick surveillance are shown in Table 1 . A total of 3,198 ticks belonging to 5 species of 3 genera were collected from 12 of the 14 sampling points in Kyoto City (Fig. 1A) . A breakdown of numbers by percentage shows that 99.2, 6.6, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.03% of the collected ticks from the plants were H. longicornis Neumann [13] , H. flava Neumann [2] , A. testudinarium Koch [11] , H. kitaokai Hoogstraal [8] and D. taiwanensis Sugimoto [18] , respectively ( Table 1 ). The dominant species among the ticks collected in this study were H. longicornis and H. flava ( Fig. 1 and Table 1 ). The proportions of each growth stage among these ticks were 1.9, 11 and 87.1% for adults, nymphs and larvae, respectively (Table 1 ). No significant difference in sex among the collected population was observed in this survey (Table 1) . Furthermore, the populations of the species collected were not affected by the altitude of the surveillance points (Table 1) . Sixty-eight ticks belonging to H. longicornis, H. flava and A. testudinarium were also collected from 5 wild boars (Table 1) . The proportions of tick species found at each surveillance point are shown on a map of Kyoto City (Fig. 1B) . Inter- estingly, the tick population differed markedly according to surveillance point. In the northern mountains (A, B, C, D and E), almost all the ticks captured were H. longicornis (Fig. 1B) . In the western mountains (F, G, H and I), H. longicornis and H. flava were the dominant species (Fig. 1B) , whereas in the eastern mountains (L and M), A. testudinarium was the second common species after H. longicornis (Fig. 1B) . At the eastern point, N, we captured just one tick of D. taiwanensis ( Fig. 1B and Table 1 ). A total of 201 ticks collected at 9 points in the mountainous area in Kyoto City from July to September 2011 were investigated for the presence of rickettsial genes using primer pairs for gltA and 17K antigen genes. Of these, 143 (71.1%) of the ticks appeared to be positive for rickettsial DNA amplified by at least one PCR primer pair (Table 2) . Of the PCR-positive ticks, 125 (87.4%) of the samples were positive with the PCR using R. japonica-specific primers Rj5 and Rj10. Rickettsial DNA was detected in 141 (72.7%) of the H. longicornis consisting of 12 males, 12 females and 117 nymphs. Of these, 1 male, 2 females and 2 nymphs were captured from wild boars. Two A. testudinarium nymphs collected from point L also harbored rickettsial DNA. No rickettsial DNA was amplified in H. flava and D. taiwanensis with the primer pairs (RpCS877 and RpCS1258, R1 and R2, and/or Rj5 and Rj10) used in this study. Rickettsial DNA was detected in the 8 surveillance points A, B, C, D, E, F, G and L (Table 2 and Fig. 1C) . The sequence analysis of selected PCR fragments using the R1 and R2 primer pair (R1/R2 fragment) obtained from H. longicornis showed similarity to each other, with 0 to 3 nucleotide sequence differences in 475 bases (99.3-100% homology). The similarity of the R1/R2 fragment of A. testudinarium to that of H. longicornis was 96.2% (457/475). The R1/R2 fragments were subjected to phylogenetic analysis to confirm the association with previously reported rickettsial sequences (Fig. 2) . The R1/R2 fragment from H. longicornis (R17K-Ti187F) clustered into the spotted fever group of rickettsia, including R. japonica, R. conorii and R. slovaca, whereas those from A. testudinarium were divided into clusters other than SFG rickettsia.
