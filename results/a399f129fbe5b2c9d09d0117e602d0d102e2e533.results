The socio-demographic, professional and HeV experience characteristics of 204 respondents have been presented elsewhere (Mendez et al., 2013a) . However 4 participants, who answered the questions about HeV vaccination for horses in Mendez et al. (2013a) , were excluded from the present data analysis as they did not answer the questions about HeV management or were in fact ineligible because they had retired from private practice. Additionally, not all participants answered all questions. (Table 1) Of the 200 respondents, 96 were male (48%); 116 were 40 years or younger (58%); 156 (78%) graduated from a QLD University. Overall, 70 (34.3%) worked in the Brisbane and Moreton region and 87 (43.5%) were from highly accessible to accessible ARIA (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2004).
