An efficient infection could be evidenced by a significant increase of viral RNA or DNA for all 5 viruses over time (table 1) . Despite progressing viral replication, the expression of some of the reference genes remained constant, while other genes were varying in expression according to accumulation of infected cells. The experimentally obtained data for each virus and each gene were analysed using three different methods. The reference gene evaluation of the BestKeeper tool is shown in table 2. A low standard deviation (SD) of the C T values should be expected for useful reference genes and a high SD for genes that are susceptible to virus replication. Corresponding to the recent estimation the SD of the C T value was highest for Act in 4 of 5 viruses, indicating that Act is no reliable reference gene in this setting. In contrast, TBP and PPI displayed the highest expressional stability for 4 of 5 viruses. To find a general conclusion, the total of all SD values from all virus experiments (sum V ) was calculated for each reference gene. As shown in table 2, TBP and PPI seemed to be the least regulated genes in this analysis (sum v = 2.29 for both), followed by GAP (sum v = 3.49) and β2M (sum v = 3.96). All other genes showed moderate total SD values (sum v > 4.58), except Act (sum v = 11.28), confirming to be the most inappropriate reference gene. It is remarkable that the obtained BestKeeper index values are low, despite the inclusion of Act in the calculation. Calculating BestKeeper vs. each reference gene using Pearson correlation displayed very inconsistent results (table 3) . Act showed the highest SD values in all virus infections, but a significantly high correlation. In contrast TBP displayed low correlation that was statistically not significant in most cases. When summing up the SD values of all reference genes for each virus infection (sum HRG ), it seems that CAMP infection caused the highest variations in reference gene expression. Analysing the expression data with the GeNorm tool showed slightly deviant results (table 4) . First, the value sum V , representing the SD of a reference gene over all viruses, was lowest for PPI (sum V = 6.08) confirming the results obtained by the Bestkeeper tool. However, β2M (sum V = 6.11), GAP (sum V = 6.19) and TBP (sum V = 6.29) turned out to be comparably reliable as reference genes. Second, also the GeNorm tool showed that Act is by far the worst reference gene (sum V = 14.20). Applying the calculation mode presented previously [5] , that is based on the calculation of ∆∆C T values (table 5) , Act was most susceptible to virus infection for 3 of 5 viruses and displayed the highest ∆∆C T value over all viruses (sum V = 45.23). The two genes with the lowest ∆∆C T value were TBP (sum V = 9.82) and PPI (sum V =
