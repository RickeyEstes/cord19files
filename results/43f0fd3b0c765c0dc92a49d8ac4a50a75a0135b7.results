The protease of human dengue virus, DENV2, cleaves only human STING To begin, we cloned STING from chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes, Genbank XM_016953921), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta, Genbank MF622060), and the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus, Genbank MF622061). These species have been explored as animal models of dengue infection, and also represent the three major clades of simian primates: apes (represented by chimpanzee), Old World monkeys (represented by macaque), and New World monkeys (represented by marmoset; Figure 1A ). Most suspected dengue virus reservoir hosts belong to the Old World monkey clade (red and green type in Figure 1A ). On the other hand, New World monkeys (such as marmosets), which reside exclusively in the Americas, have presumably never been exposed to sylvatic dengue viruses since sylvatic cycles do not exist in the New World. We also included human (Genbank MF622062) and mouse (Mus musculus, Genbank MF622063) STING in our studies as positive and negative controls, since it was previously shown that human but not mouse STING is sensitive to DENV2 NS2B3 cleavage Yu et al., 2012) . The dengue virus NS2B3 protease complex is composed of the viral non-structural proteins NS2B and NS3 (Preugschat et al., 1990; Zhang et al., 1992; Falgout et al., 1991) . In the dengue virus genome, the NS2B and NS3 genes sit adjacent and are cotranslated as part of a single long viral polyprotein (Perera and Kuhn, 2008; Chambers et al., 1990) . When the NS2B -NS3 region is expressed from a plasmid, the region is translated into a small polyprotein that then auto-cleaves itself to become the functional protease complex (Yusof et al., 2000; Bera et al., 2007) . We used a plasmid expressing the NS2B-NS3 region, including a 3x Flag tag at the C-terminus of NS3, from the New Guinea C isolate of DENV2 (see methods). As a control, a mutation was created at the activesite serine, changing it to an alanine (S135A), which renders the protease inactive (Rodriguez-Madoz et al., 2010) . We then used a previously established cotransfection assay Yu et al., 2012) to determine if the dengue virus protease could cleave primate STING orthologs. Plasmids encoding primate or mouse STING, and either active or S135A (dead) NS2B3 dengue proteases, were cotransfected into 293T cells. STING cleavage was assessed 24 hr later by western blot. The inactivity of the S135A protease can be seen in the anti-Flag blot, where the NS2B-NS3 polyprotein does not self-cleave when this mutation is present ( Figure 1B) . We see only a fraction of the human STING being cleaved, but this is consistent with previous publications and is presumably exacerbated by the overexpression of STING achieved in transfection experiments Yu et al., 2012) . Unexpectedly, none of the nonhuman primate STINGs tested were susceptible to cleavage ( Figure 1B) . Remarkably, the DENV2 protease could not even cleave chimpanzee STING, which differs from human STING at only three amino acid positions.
