Two hundred nine children with asthma exacerbation, including 203 patients hospitalized in our pediatric wards and six who attended our outpatient clinics, and 77 controls with stable asthma were recruited. Table 1 shows the characteristics of these patients. Children with asthma exacerbation were younger than the controls, mainly because of our inability to recruit one age-matched control for each child with asthma exacerbation. Similar proportions of patients in the two groups received regular ICS treatment. Suffi cient respiratory samples were collected from 206 (98.6%) cases and all controls; these consisted of 236 NPA samples and 47 nasal swabs. Respiratory pathogens were detected in 105 (51.0%) subjects. Table 2 summarizes the distributions of respiratory pathogens in two groups of patients. The presence of any virus with or without atypical bacteria was associated with asthma exacerbation ( P , .001 for both). Specifi cally, HRV infection was more common among children with asthma exacerbation (odds ratio [OR], 2.38; 95% CI, 1.09-5.32; P 5 .018). On logistic regression, asthma exacerbation was associated with the detection of HRV (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.11-5.00; P 5 .025), any respiratory virus (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.17-4.08; P 5 .014), or any respiratory pathogen (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.16-4.00; P 5 .015). None of the respiratory pathogens or their coinfection was associated with the severity of asthma exacerbation ( P . .15 for all). Age, gender, and ICS treatment did not affect the detection of respiratory pathogens in patients with asthma exacerbation ( P . .1 for all). Table 3 summarizes the clinical features of patients with asthma exacerbation in relation to HRV infections. 21 Respiratory pathogens were detected in 47% of these patients, and HRV peaked in winter and early spring. These multiplex nested PCR assays were specifi c and 100-to 1,000-fold more sensitive than conventional methods in detecting the viruses. Our assays detected Յ 10 nucleic acid copies for all viruses (except enteroviruses), which were comparable to those reported in widely quoted highthroughput multiplex PCR assays. 21 Specifi cally, our nested PCR was able to detect one cDNA copy of HRV. The present study used the same method, except for Legionella pneumophila being replaced by HBoV, to investigate the infective causes of asthma exacerbation in Hong Kong children. HRV infections also peaked in winter of 2007/2008 in children with asthma exacerbation ( Fig 1 ) . Our detection rate (51%) was similar to previous local studies 20,22 but lower than those published in white populations. 23 It is uncertain whether our low HRV detection rate was due to limitations of the PCR technique, which is less likely in view of our previously noted in vitro results, or a genuinely low incidence of HRV infection in Hong Kong children. Further studies in other Asian populations are needed to confi rm our fi ndings. HRV infection was associated with asthma exacerbation in the children, which is consistent with FeNO was the only parameter that differed between patients with and without HRV, being signifi cantly lower in the former group ( P 5 .018). Ten controls were HRV positive, and mean (SD) FeNO of those with and without HRV were 38.6 (17.9) ppb and 82.2 (61.3) ppb, respectively ( P , .001). Table 4 summarizes the relationship between age and different respiratory pathogens in patients with asthma exacerbation. Patients with asthma exacerbation caused by respiratory viruses were younger than those without identifi able viral infections ( P , .05). This fi nding was attributed mainly to RSV ( P , .005) and infl uenza A and HMPV infections ( P , .05 for both). Age did not differ between the case and control groups with infections by other organisms, including HRV, or with coinfections. Figure 1 illustrates the seasonal pattern of HRV, which was found in patients throughout the study period ( Ն 10%) and peaked in winter (November-December) of 2007 to 2008. Similarly, 28.6% of controls had HRV in autumn-winter (September-October), but none of them were HRV positive in spring-summer (March-August). The low positive rates for other respiratory pathogens in our subjects preclude our analysis of their seasonality patterns. B. On the other hand, HRV infection was detected in 13% of our subjects with stable asthma who did not experience any symptom or sign of disease exacerbation. In a longitudinal study of healthy children, 20.6% of all HRV infections were asymptomatic. 29 Future studies should delineate the pathogenic linkage between HRV and worsened asthma. During the past few years, there has been impressive advance in our understanding of the interactions between HRV and host immunity. 30 HRV infects human cells via ligation with its major group receptor intercellular adhesion molecule 1. Infected respiratory epithelial cells, and possibly macrophages, produce a variety of proinfl ammatory cytokines, chemokines, and leukotrienes. These mediators in turn attract different infl ammatory cells to the airway, resulting in worsened immunopathology and increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness observed in patients with asthma. In addition, airway epithelium from patients with asthma is defi cient in mounting adequate antiviral responses to HRV. 31, 32 HBoV was detected in 5.0% of 1,906 local children hospitalized for acute RTIs, 33 and seasonal distribution was noted from September to February. Despite this, the detection of HBoV in 2.4% of cases and 2.6% of controls was not associated with asthma exacerbation in the present study. This fi nding might be explained by our exclusion of infants and young children, who were at increased risk of HBoV infection. 9, 33 Three-fi fths of adults with asthma exacerbation had M pneumoniae and/or C pneumoniae , 34 and telithromycin was shown to be a useful treatment in these patients. M pneumoniae was detected in more than half of patients with asthma, 11 and also in upper airway secretions from 11% of patients with chronic stable asthma. 14 Hahn 12 claimed oral macrolides to be effi cacious for patients with acute asthma. On the other hand, Cunningham et al 10 failed to show any relation between M pneumoniae and childhood asthma exacerbation. M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae were detected only in 2.4% of our children with asthma exacerbations, which was similar to that observed in patients with stable asthma. Our fi ndings do not support atypical bacteria to be important pathogens for asthma exacerbations in children or the usefulness of macrolides in treating these patients. The major limitation of this project relates to its study power. The number of controls was much lower than that of our recruited cases, mainly because casecontrol matching within 1 week was not possible on many occasions when stable and especially younger patients also complained of nonspecifi c upper respiratory symptoms (eg, rhinorrhea, blocked nose, sore throat) during change of weather. Our sample size had a power of 97% for detecting any difference in the detection of any virus between cases and controls, published data about the importance of HRV in white populations. In the Childhood Origins of Asthma birth cohort, a total of 259 children were followed prospectively from birth to 6 years of age. 24 HRV-associated wheezing in years 1 and 3 were the strongest predictor for asthma diagnosis at the age of 6 years. Nearly 90% of children who wheezed with HRV in year 3 subsequently developed asthma. Two other studies found HRV to be the most important microbiological risk factors for asthma diagnosis and disease exacerbation. [25] [26] [27] More recently, Miller et al 28 reported that childhood asthma exacerbations were associated with the novel group C of HRV rather than the two previously known phylogenetic groups A and Results expressed in mean (SD) and only included data for pathogens that were detected in fi ve or more patients. a P , .05 for between-group comparisons. b P , .005 for between-group comparisons. c P , .01 for between-group comparisons.

Thus, larger studies are needed to delineate the possible association between asthma exacerbation and RTIs by these organisms. The lack of standardization on the methodology of HRV detection would also pose a problem. A recent study revealed that HRVs consist of . 100 distinct serotypes. 35 In view of this degree of phylogenetic heterogeneity, the PCR primers designed for our multiplex assays were not able to detect all HRVs. Despite the use of sensitive multiplex assays as discussed previously, our molecular approach for detecting viruses would miss some HRVs that were not covered by our PCR primers. Future studies need to adopt multiple PCR primers that specifi cally target as many HRV serotypes as possible. Another weakness is that NPA samples were collected from 236 (83.4%) subjects, whereas nasal swabs were collected from the remaining subjects. As we previously reported, the overall sensitivity of detecting infl uenza, parainfl uenza, RSV, and adenovirus in NPA was higher than that obtained by nasal swabs in local children. 36 On the other hand, we did not have relevant data for HRV. Although more than 80% of subjects had NPA samples, it is possible that we might have missed some organisms in those with only nasal swabs. We also observed that only 30% of patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbation had successfully performed FeNO measurement according to guideline (Table 1) . 18 As patients with severe bronchospasm were probably too breathless for the procedure, only patients with milder attacks would contribute to FeNO readings in this group. In addition, a substantial proportion of these patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids prior to FeNO. These reasons explain the lower FeNO in these patients when compared with patients with stable asthma. In conclusion, respiratory viruses and atypical bacteria are detected in more than half of Hong Kong children with asthma exacerbation. HRV infection is the most important risk factor for asthma exacerbation in these patients. Nonetheless, none of these pathogens is associated with severity of asthma exacerbation.
