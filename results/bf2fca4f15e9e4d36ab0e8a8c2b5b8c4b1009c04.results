Characteristics of the study population. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs obtained from 84 children with (n = 40) and without (n = 44) RSV infection were included in the analysis. Baseline characteristics of the study population are described in Table 1 . In the RSV-positive group, only children with a positive laboratory diagnosis of RSV and negative for other common respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were included in the analysis, while the RSV-negative group comprised children who were negative for RSV and other infectious causes of respiratory illness (see "Methods" for further details). The groups were well-matched and no statistically significant differences in clinical and anthropometric measures were identified. Only children to whom antibiotics had not been administered in the 2 weeks prior to sampling were recruited. The upper airway is dominated by Streptoccocal colonisation. Sequence analysis of the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene generated a total of 6,622,832 high-quality reads (median 83,831 IQR 39,686-107,741). The top 10 taxa in the airway microbiome by median proportional abundance were Streptococcus, Veillonella, Haemophilus, Prevotella, Neisseria, Escherichia, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Moraxella, and Leptotrichia (Fig. 1a) . Streptococcus was the most abundant taxon with a median proportional abundance of~40% ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). Simultaneous bacterial metaproteome analysis using mass spectrometry showed a similar profile of microbial diversity and was equally dominated by Streptococcal proteins (Fig. 1b) . Most of the bacterial proteins in the metaproteome were ribosomal proteins, including 50S and 30S proteins as well proteins involved in energy metabolism, such as pyruvate oxidase and enolase. Further analysis of the genomic microbiota data was undertaken to determine whether the airway replication of RSV had an effect on the most abundant bacterial taxon (Streptococcus). Changes in Streptococcus abundance during and after RSV infection were calculated in a subset of RSV-infected children (n = 10) for whom nasal samples were collected at admission (acute samples) and 1 month later (convalescent samples). For 70% of these children (7/10), the airway abundance of Streptococcus during acute infection was higher than that at convalescence, while for three children (3/10) , Streptococcus abundance at convalescence was either not different or had increased, relative to the acute infection time point (Fig. 1c) . RSV infection results in airway neutrophil degranulation. In order to characterise biological pathways that are upregulated in the local airway following RSV infection, the mean expression levels of airway proteins were compared between children with and without RSV infection. Of the 1875 host proteins that were quantified in the upper airway, the mean expression levels of 123 proteins were significantly different between the two groups of children (Supplementary data 2). Among these, 73 proteins were expressed at significantly higher levels in children with RSV infection while the remainder were higher among those without RSV infection (Fig. 2a) . Gene ontology biological process (GOBP)-based enrichment analysis of these differentially expressed proteins showed that the neutrophil degranulation pathway (GOBP ID: 0043312, combined enrichment score = 401.9) was the most significantly enriched biological process among RSV-infected children (adjusted Fishers exact test P = 9.5 × 10 −31 , Fig. 2b ). Other pathways such as proteolysis were also significantly enriched in the airways of RSV-infected children but their respective enrichment scores were much lower than the neutrophil degranulation pathway (combined enrichment scores of ≤ 35.1) (Fig. 2b) . The neutrophil degranulation pathway comprised 33 proteins-including bactericidal proteins that are typically localised within neutrophil granules, such as MPO, AZU1, BPI, LCN2, and others (Fig. 2d ). In addition to neutrophil granule proteins, we also observed elevated expression of other potent antibacterial proteins in RSV-infected children; the mean expression levels of eosinophil peroxidase (EPX) and Ras-related protein (RAP1B) were significantly higher in RSV-infected children than in RSV-negative controls (Fig. 2d) . Among children without RSV infection, SRP-dependent co-translational protein targeting to membrane, signal sequence recognition (GOBP ID: 0006617, adjusted Fishers exact test P = 1.02 × 10 −8 , Fig. 2c ) was the most significantly enriched pathway. Secretions from infected children inhibit microbial growth. Due to the significant overexpression of antibacterial proteins in the airway secretions of RSV-infected children, we reasoned that these children would have substantially greater antibacterial activity compared with children without RSV infection. To test this hypothesis, we developed an in vitro assay to measure the bacterial inhibition activity against a common nasopharyngeal pathobiont, S. pneumoniae. Anti-pneumococcal activity was tested in nasal samples from children with and without RSV infection and data presented as a bacterial inhibition index (BII), whose values ranged from 0 (no inhibition) to 40,960 (complete inhibition) (Fig. 3a) . Children were binned into five BII strata (BII: ≤20, 40, 80, 160 and ≥320) and the relative proportions of different OTUs was determined within each group. The proportional abundance of Streptococcus decreased with increasing BII, with children who had the lowest anti-pneumococcal activity (BII: ≤20) having the highest mean airway abundance of Streptococcus (45%) while those with the highest anti-pneumococcal activity (BII ≥ 320) had the lowest Streptococcus abundance (25%) ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). We then analysed the correlation between the antipneumococcal activity measured in the bacterial inhibition assay and the expression levels of 15 neutrophil granule proteins that were significantly overexpressed in children with RSV infection (highlighted in Fig. 3d ). We stratified this correlation analysis by neutrophil granule subset and included two representative members of each subset (MPO and AZU1 for azurophilic granules, LCN2 and ITGAM for specific granules, and MMP9 t  o  r  p  d  e  z  i  r  e  t  c  a  r  a  h  c  n  U n   i  e  t  o  r  p  d  e  z  i  p  i  p  r  e  t  c  a  r  a  h  e  h  e  c  h  c  c  n  U  r  U  r  a  U  a  Chaperone 143296  142430  137882  141288  144028  144280  142962  144094  137749  P0112 1  137205  P0293 1  137105  144151  137608  143316  143774  142907  137447  P0217   2  143311  143313  143734  143727  P0274 1  137529  138618  P0209   1  142966  P0144 2  143404  P0248 2  143095  143029  138375  143617  143315  P0210 1  138442  140331  143994  P0267 1  137389  143885  137115  144137  137843  P0209 2  142901  144533  P0293 2  P0211 1  137145  138479  138423  142904  143051  137330  P0211 2  P0210   2  143873  P0016 2  141254  144422  143654  P0144 1  P0016 1  P0112 2  142296  143569  143105  P0210 3  138042  143374  143375  143229  143843  143578  P0217 1 and CTSS for gelatinase granules) (Fig. 3c) . We observed a significant positive correlation between the expression level of all neutrophil granule proteins and pneumococcal inhibition activity ( Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Expression levels of three housekeeping proteins: beta-actin (ACTB), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) and peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) were used as controls and their respective expression levels did not correlate with bacterial inhibition activity (Fig. 3c) . We then compared pneumococcal inhibition activity between RSV-positive and RSV-negative children. Airway secretions of RSV-infected children had significantly greater bacterial inhibition activity (BII geometric mean: 52) compared to RSV-negative children (BII geometric mean: 10.9, Mann-Whitney test P-value = 0.004) (Fig. 3d) . Further analysis of a subset of RSV-infected children for whom paired acute and convalescent samples were collected showed a similar relationship: airway secretions sampled at the time of infection, had significantly greater bacterial inhibition activity compared to samples collected a month later, during convalescence (Supplementary Fig. 3) . To determine whether this difference could be explained by differences in the mean levels of pneumococcus-specific antibody between RSVpositive and RSV-negative children, we measured the levels of airway anti-pneumococcus IgG to two pneumococcal proteins (choline-binding protein D and Histidine triad protein E). The results of these analyses showed that the mean IgG levels to these proteins was not significantly different between RSV-positive and RSV-negative children (Fig. 3e) . RSV infection is associated with neutrophil phagocytosis. We used flow cytometry to characterise airway-resident neutrophils, which are the source of the neutrophil granule proteins that were identified in the proteomic analysis (see "Methods" and Supplementary Fig. 5 for a full description of the FACS analysis and gating strategy). We also used flow cytometry to assess the functional activity of these cells in RSV-positive and RSVnegative children. In RSV-infected children, neutrophils occurred at a median frequency of 12% while in RSV-negative children, The dashed horizontal red line denotes an optical density cutoff above which substantial turbidity of the culture media was observed. Nasal secretions from infant 1 were unable to inhibit bacterial growth at any dilution (bacterial inhibition index [BII] = 0). Nasal secretions from infant 2 completely inhibited pneumococcal growth at dilutions ≤ 1:160 (BII = 160). b Children were categorised into five BII strata and differences in the proportional abundance of different bacterial taxa in each stratum presented in pie charts. The airway abundance of Streptococcus decreased with increasing bacterial inhibition activity. c Bacterial inhibition activity in nasal samples (N = 72) was correlated with the expression levels of neutrophil-granule proteins (stratified by functional subset). Representative proteins from all three subsets of neutrophil granules (azurophilic, specific and gelatinase) were positively correlated with bacterial inhibition activity (complete analysis of the correlation between bacterial inhibition activity and all the neutrophil granule proteins can be found in Supplementary Fig. 2 ). In contrast, there was no correlation between the expression levels of housekeeping proteins (ACTB, B2M and PPIA) and bacterial inhibition activity in nasal samples. Correlation analysis was done using Spearman's rank order correlation. (Fig. 4g) . Although the mean frequency of airway-resident neutrophils in RSV-positive children was higher than that of RSV-negative children, this difference was not statistically significant. Next, using an ex-vivo phagocytosis assay, we assessed the ability of airway-resident neutrophils from RSV-positive and RSV-negative bacteria to ingest and kill bacteria. In this assay, we used a representative bacteria species (E. coli) that was labelled with a tag (pHrodo) whose fluorescence was activated only upon ingestion and localisation of the bacteria into a phagosome, thereby allowing for a quantitative assessment of phagocytic activity through flow cytometry (see examples in Fig. 4d, f) . Using this assay we compared the phagocytic capacity of airway neutrophils obtained from RSV-positive and RSV-negative children. Although not statistically significant, a greater proportion of airway neutrophils obtained from RSV-positive children exhibited phagocytic activity against E. coli (median 18%) compared to RSV-negative children (median 16%). Degranulation is associated with lower oxygen saturation. In order to identify a potential role for airway neutrophil granule proteins in the pathogenesis of RSV, we examined the effect of different protein expression levels on clinical parameters associated with RSV disease severity. Since one of the central features of severe RSV pneumonia is reduced blood oxygen saturation resulting from occlusion of small airways with necrotic, virusinfected cells as well as infiltrating immune cells. We therefore examined the effect of the increased expression of neutrophil granule proteins on blood oxygen saturation. Children were dichotomised into two groups (high and low neutrophil granule expressers) based on the median expression level of different proteins. Children whose protein expression level was above the median expression (of the full study population) were classified as high expressers while those who were below the median were classified as low expressers (Fig. 5) . We then compared oxygen saturation levels between these two groups. For all neutrophil granule proteins that were analysed (ITGAM, BPI, LCN2, MGAM, ITGB2, AZU1, ANPEP, MMP9 and MPO), children with low levels of airway neutrophil granule expression had significantly higher blood oxygen saturation levels compared to children in the high-expression group (Fig. 5a) . For comparison, we also dichotomised the expression levels of two housekeeping proteins-beta-actin (ACTB) and β-2-microglobulin c Flow cytometry analysis was used to identify neutrophils in the sample described in b above (details of full gating strategy can be found in the "Methods" section and in Fig. S5 ). Cells that were double positive for CD66b and CD16 were gated as neutrophils. d Phagocytic activity of airway-resident neutrophils shown in c above was analysed using flow cytometry. Cells were co-incubated with an E. coli strain that was labelled with a dye (pHrodo) whose florescence was only activated upon phagocytosis. In this example, 17.8% of the neutrophils in the sample exhibited bacterial phagocytosis. e, f A similar example is shown from a different child who had fewer neutrophils and also had reduced phagocytic activity. g The frequency of airway-resident neutrophils in RSV-positive and RSV-negative children is shown as a proportion of all airway cells. The proportion of airway cells that were identified as neutrophils was greater in RSV-positive children (N = 10) compared to RSV-negative children (N = 10) although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals about the geometric mean. h The capacity of airway neutrophils from RSV-positive (N = 10) and RSV-negative (N = 10) children to phagocytose bacteria was compared. A greater proportion of neutrophils from RSV-positive children exhibited phagocytic activity compared to RSV-negative children, although this difference did not achieve statistical significance. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals about the geometric mean. Comparison between the RSV-positive and RSV-negative groups in g and h was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Source data for g and h are provided as a Source Data file (B2M)-using the median. In contrast to the neutrophil granule proteins, there was no difference in blood oxygen saturation between high and low expressers of ACTB and B2M (Fig. 5b) .
