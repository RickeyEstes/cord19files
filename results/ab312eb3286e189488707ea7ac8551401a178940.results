SSP mediates glycoprotein precursor processing. The glycoprotein complex is expressed as a polyprotein that undergoes two cleavage events (Fig. 1A) . SSP retains a high degree of sequence conservation across Old World and New World signal peptides ( Fig. 1B ; see also Fig . S1 in the supplemental material) (29) . This consensus alignment excludes the boa constrictor-derived arenaviruses, since this group of distantly related viruses expresses a filovirus-like glycoprotein (30) . SSP is a key component of the glycoprotein complex that is not recycled within the endoplasmic reticulum but is retained as an essential subunit within purified virions (Fig. 1C ). Previous studies have demonstrated a role of basic amino acids within transmembrane protein cytoplasmic domains for the intracellular transport and processing of proproteins into their mature forms (12, (31) (32) (33) . We introduced alanine point mutations in the final two residues within the LCMV GP2 subunit and tested the ability of these constructs to produce a cleaved GP2 subunit, since GPC cleavage into GP1 and GP2 precedes membrane transport (29) . Wild-type (WT) GPC with the RR-to-AA mutation, along with the in trans expression of wildtype SSP, resulted in the accumulation of the precursor GPC, which moderately affected levels of processed GP2, as quantified by densitometry analysis (Fig. 1D) . The GP1/2 RR-to-AA mutant lacking the native SSP did not produce the cleaved GP2 subunit. We used flow cytometry to measure the surface expression of the glycoprotein using live cells stained with a conformation-specific GP1 antibody (Fig. 1E) . Mutations within the WT GPC did not alter the amount of surface GP1 expression. The GP1/2 and the GP1/2 RRAA samples failed to produce a GP1 signal above background levels. Cotransfection of wild-type SSP with both the WT GPC RR-to-AA and with the GP1/2 RR-to-AA protein restored both GP2 processing and surface expression of GP1, suggesting the dibasic motif within the LCMV glycoprotein is not the driving force for secretory pathway trafficking, but rather this function resides within SSP. SSP C-terminal region is essential for GPC processing into GP1 and GP2 subunits. A native antibody directed against SSP that is applicable for immunofluorescence microscopy does not exist, as the SP7 antibody detects only SSP under denatured and reduced conditions (18, 34) . We used a C-terminal hemagglutinin-tagged SSP (SSP-HA) plasmid construct to assess the significance of the SSP for GPC maturation. This construct was previously used to define SSP membrane topology, SSP's role in pH-dependent fusion, and interactions between SSP and the Z matrix protein (35) (36) (37) (38) . Western blot analysis of HEK 293T cell lysates cotransfected with SSP-HA and the glycoprotein precursor lacking its cognate SSP (GP1/2) resulted in expression of SSP and the GPC but lacked the processed GP2 (Fig. 2) . Digestion of transfected cell lysates with the peptide--N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) enzyme to rid N-linked glycans confirmed the GPC was glycosylated (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Detection of the GP2 subunit was rescued upon cotransfection with wild-type SSP, suggesting the HA epitope interfered with SSP-GPC interactions needed for appropriate precursor processing. Since the presence of the epitope at the C terminus interfered with proper glycoprotein complex expression, we inserted the HA epitope in the N-terminal SSP region of the entire glycoprotein open reading frame, downstream of the myristoylation motif (HA SSP GPC). This internally tagged glycoprotein allowed for in cis detection of and experimentation with SSP relative to the remaining glycoprotein subunits. In trans expression of SSP-HA and GP1/2 allowed for precursor cleavage and the detection of the processed GP2 subunit, although this SSP, along with the wild-type SSP, was more rapidly degraded when provided on separate plasmids (Fig. 2) . Blocking the SSP C-terminal region interferes with plasma membrane trafficking. The signal peptide is required for GPC cleavage, a prerequisite for glycoprotein complex localization at the plasma membrane. We compared glycoprotein expression to phalloidin-defined cell membrane boundaries in the presence or absence of detergent permeabilization using confocal microscopy and a confirmation-specific GP1 antibody (39) . In addition, we used the ER chaperone protein Grp78 to determine intracellular glycoprotein complex localization. Wild-type glycoprotein produced a plasma membrane signal with pseudopod-like membrane exvaginations with moderate intracellular Grp8 staining (Fig. 3A) . A similar phenotype was produced with in trans coexpression of wild-type SSP and GP1/2 and with HA SSP GPC. Further, the HA SSP GPC allowed for SSP detection at the plasma membrane both with and without detergent treatment. In the absence of detergent permeabilization, the GP1/2 precursor lacking its SSP resulted in the lack of plasma membrane expression and a "leaky" ER staining, which was confirmed by Grp78 staining. Similarly, cotransfection of the SSP-HA and GP1/2 failed to yield plasma membrane detection of the GP complex. Rather, the entire complex was retained within the ER. Taking into account the defect in glycopro-tein processing observed in transfected cell lysates (Fig. 2) , blocking the SSP C-terminus interferes with the ability of the GP complex to traffic from the ER to the Golgi for processing by the cellular SKI-1/S1P enzyme to produce mature GP subunits (13, 14) . We assessed plasma membrane trafficking of the glycoprotein complex on live, transfected cells using flow cytometry (Fig. 3B ). The WT GPC, GP1/2 plus WT SSP, and HA SSP GPC samples supported the surface detection of the GP1 subunit. The GP1/2 and the GP1/2 plus SSP-HA samples resulted in mock levels of fluorescent intensity. Using the HA antibody to indirectly detect SSP, we detected wild-type GP1 levels of the HA signal with the HA SSP GPC sample, whereas the GP1/2 plus SSP-HA sample resulted in mock HA expression levels. Detection of the HA signal with the HA SSP GPC sample on live cells confirmed that our confocal microscopy results for SSP detection were not an artifact result from the fixation technique.
