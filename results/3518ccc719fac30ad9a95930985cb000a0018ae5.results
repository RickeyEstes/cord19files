The search yielded a total of 1108 articles after the removal of duplicates (Additional file 3: Figure S1 ). One hundred and fifty-eight articles were read in their entirety, of which 132 were deemed to be relevant and underwent thematic coding. After the completion of coding, we identified 77 key documents that described 16 high-level themes of health system resilience, which are summarized in Additional file 1: Table S2 (see Additional file 2: Appendix A and Appendix B for a comprehensive breakdown of sources organized by theme and author). Thirty-nine papers focused primarily on infectious diseases, while another 12 addressed natural hazards. The remaining 26 papers were not threat-specific, but rather articulated general principles for strengthening health systems and described baseline capacities required for health system functioning. While the themes found in our search were consistent with the five elements of a resilient health system previously outlined by Kruk et al. [1, 2] , we also identified three additional themes not included in previous reviews, including the need to: Develop policies for determining what level of care will be delivered when the level of demand exceeds existing resources; Plan for post-event recovery; and Commitment to quality improvement that ensures integration of lessons learned. For example, Mehta et al. described the need to develop "altered standards of care" for responses to mass casualty events, which might include shifting resources to save as many lives as possible (i.e., triaging patients differently during emergencies as compared to normal operating conditions) and allowing for group isolation of patients that would normally be boarded in single rooms [23] . The literature identified a number of issues that must be addressed during the recovery phase of a public health emergency, including the need for grief and psychological counseling [24] , after-action assessment and revision of emergency response plans [25] , and rebuilding of social cohesion and trust [26] . A commitment to continuous quality improvement was also identified as an important component of resilient health systems, including making hospital performance ratings mandatory and publicly available to encourage peer competition with the primary goal being the overall improvement of hospital performance [27] . In integrating literature across subject areas, we were able to identify multiple references to the capacities necessary to achieve the 16 health system resilience attributes identified in our scoping review, which are summarized below (also see Additional file 1: Table S2 ). Core Health Service Capabilities: A resilient health system sustains baseline levels of routine healthcare delivery during a public health emergency [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Barriers to Healthcare Access: A resilient health system dismantles barriers to healthcare access so that the public accesses care during emergencies [36, 37] . Maintaining Critical Infrastructure and Transportation: A resilient health system develops plans to weather interruptions in critical infrastructure and transportation [24, 25, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . Timely and Flexible Access to Emergency/Crisis Financing: A resilient health system has timely, flexible access to financing so that it can better prepare for and respond to public health emergencies [24, 29, 36, 37, [39] [40] [41] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . Leadership and Command Structure: A resilient health system has a clear and flexible command structure that has been established prior to an event and is exercised frequently [24, 29, 57, [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] . Collaboration, Coordination, and Partnerships: A resilient health system collaborates and coordinates with partners within and outside of the health system [2, 29, 39, 45, 57, 66, 67] . Communication: A resilient health system has clear channels of communication between health system actors and other sectors, risk communication protocols, and robust engagement with patient populations [60, 68] . Flexible Plans and Management Structures: A resilient health system has flexible plans and management structures to cope with rapidly evolving circumstances [1, [69] [70] [71] . Legal Preparations: A resilient health system has made legal preparations to address challenges that may emerge during a crisis [1, 45, 49, 59, 62, 72, 73] . Surge Capacity: A resilient health system is able to call on human and capital resources to "surge" the level of care during public health emergencies [36, 74] . Altered Standards of Care: A resilient health system has adaptable response plans to guide them in allocating scarce resources and healthcare services [23, 75] . Health Workforce: A resilient health system has an adequate, trained, and willing work force [4, 22, 36, 40, 45, 53, 54, 76, 77] . Medical Supplies and Equipment: A resilient health system has access to medical supplies and equipment, including personal protective equipment, antivirals, and ventilators, during a crisis [40, 53, [78] [79] [80] . Infection Prevention and Control (IPC): A resilient health system has implemented strong IPC measures, including staff training, standardized protocols, a dedicated IPC focal point, and dedicated treatment units [4, 22, 39, 47, 51, 54, [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] . Commitment to Quality Improvement: A resilient health system requires a commitment to continuous quality improvement that promotes excellence and garners the trust of the community [15, 27, 39, 54, 69, 87, 88] . Plans for Post-Event Recovery: Resilient health systems have plans for post-event recovery that address a broad range of issues [24-26, 34, 40, 59, 73, 89-93] . The capacities that we identified are associated with different actors in health systems. Some of the capacities identified in our review could potentially be developed by individual health facilities. For example, Kim et al. discussed one health system's plan to develop alternate care centers that could be deployed during an influenza pandemic, including the infrastructure that needs to be in place to ensure adequate functioning, such as transport of patients to the center [42] . Other capacities identified in the scoping review concerned the health system more broadly and would likely be addressed by national governmental authorities. For example, Hanefeld et al. noted "the nature of the funding and financing mechanism as a core aspect enabling or hindering health systems' ability to respond to a shock" [29] . No frameworks were identified in the search that translated these high-level themes into specific and actionable steps that health system actors can employ to improve and support health system resilience to both infectious diseases and natural hazards, and that can be undertaken in low-, middle-, and high-income settings alike. Frameworks that did articulate specific capacities were either 1) only applicable in the US context [22] or 2) did not cohesively address both infectious diseases and natural disasters [50] . For example, Meyer et al. created a checklist for health sector resilience to highconsequence infectious diseases [22] , but the data for this checklist was informed by the US domestic response to the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak. While some of the identified capacities may be generalizable to other countries, some are only pertinent in the US context. Similarly, the Hospital Safety Index, a tool developed by WHO, does identify capacities that are relevant to some health facilities, but the tool is largely aimed at evaluating the vulnerability of hospital infrastructure to natural hazards (an updated version includes limited consideration of the potential impact of infectious disease threats to hospitals) [50] . Only two of the health system resilience themes and capacities identified in our literature search directly overlapped with the specific health security capacities that are the focus of the JEE-namely IPC and communication (See Additional file 1: Table S3 ). Specifically, the JEE indicator on antimicrobial resistance does address IPC, but only within the context of healthcareassociated infections and associated IPC programs [12] . Additionally, the literature we collected emphasized the importance of communication between health system actors, other sectors, and the community during outbreaks [60, 68] . The JEE contains a very detailed section on communication that specifically calls out for the need for communication and coordination between stakeholders, including healthcare workers; for systems for rumor management through healthcare workers; and for formal communication mechanisms with the hospital and healthcare sector [12] . Otherwise, health facilities are not directly addressed in the JEE framework. There are some indicators in the JEE that do address the themes identified in the literature review, but only within the context of public health. For example, the literature suggests that health facilities need access to financing during emergencies to cover the added costs of preparing for and responding to emergencies [24, 29, 36, 37, [39] [40] [41] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . The JEE indicator on National, Legislation, Policy and Financing does address whether countries have the financing to fulfill their obligations under the IHR, which includes "regulations or administrative requirements, or other governmental instruments governing public health surveillance and response" [12] . However, it does not specifically address financing within the context of health facilities, although countries could choose to include them in efforts to develop capacities in those areas. Finally, some of the themes identified in our review could be leveraged through the development of other capacities that are the focus of the JEE. For example, the JEE does not explicitly assess how healthcare facilities should address barriers to healthcare access, such as long travel distances, the high cost of medical care, and public distrust. However, it does address the importance of risk communication and community engagement during an emergency. These relationships could potentially be leveraged by the healthcare system during an emergency to improve the public's trust in and subsequent use of the healthcare system.
