Weekly body weight data obtained during the 13-week exposure are shown in Figs. 1 A and B. While control males grew at a steady rate during the exposure period, gaming a total of approximately 120 g, animals exposed to the highest aerosol concentration lost weight during the first 2 weeks of exposure, and then failed to gain weight throughout the remainder of the period. Male rats in the middle-dose group consistently gained significantly less weight than controls (p < 0.01); weight gain for males in the low-dose group was not statistically different from that of the control group. Similar effects on weight gain were observed for female rats, although the absolute differences in body weight between exposed and control groups were less dramatic than for males. The effects of exposure on both males and females were clearly dose related. Even though body weight gain was severely depressed for rats in the high-dose group, 9 1% of the females and 94% of the males from the exposure groups survived 13 weeks of exposure; all but one of the deaths occurred during the 11 th and 12th week of exposure. Two females from the high-and two from the middleexposure groups died near the end of the exposure period from undetermined causes. In addition, one female rat from the low-dose group died, as did one from the control group; the cause of these deaths was not clearly identified, although both animals may have been injured during handling. Prior to the 13-week termination, high-dose-group animals appeared listless; in addition, the eyes of many lacked their normal pinkish color, suggesting that they were anemic. Organ weights, expressed as organ to body weight ratio (%) for 5-and 13-week-exposed animals are shown in Table 2 . After 5-weeks exposure significant increases were observed in relative weights of liver for high-dose males and for females from all three treatment groups. Relative thymus weights were significantly less than those of controls for females from the high exposure group. Absolute kidney weights for high-dose male rats were significantly lower than those for controls; conversely, kidney weights for female rats from the same exposure group were significantly higher than for controls. When the weights for kidneys were evaluated on a percentage-ofbody-weight basis, they were significantly greater than those of controls for both males and females from the middle-and high-dose groups. Absolute brain weights were relatively constant across all treatment groups. The weights of heart, spleen, and adrenals were lower than those of controls on an absolute basis; however, on a relative-weight basis, they were higher than those of controls. After 13 weeks of exposure, changes in or-gan weights were similar to those described for the 5-week-exposed animals. Liver weights for male rats were signficantly elevated, relative to controls, for animals in the three treatment groups; this increase was dose dependent. For female rats, there was a significant increase in liver weights for animals in the high-exposure group and a significant trend for increased weight with increasing dose. Absolute kidney weights for male rats from the high-dose group were significantly lower than those for controls; however, weights of this organ for high-dose female rats were not altered relative to those of controls. When kidney weights were evaluated on percentage-of-bodyweight basis, they were elevated relative to those of controls for both sexes from the middle-and high-exposure groups. Thymus weights decreased in a dose-dependent manner, with significant decreases for animals in the middle-and high-dose groups. The higher liver weights and lower thymus and ovary weights were also statistically significant when analyzed as percentage of body weight. Heart, spleen, testis, and adrenal weights were significantly lower on an absolute-organ-weight basis and were significantly elevated on relative-weight bases when compared to those for controls. After 5-weeks exposure to HD, animals from the middle-and high-exposure groups had significantly decreased volumes of packed red cells (VPRC), hemoglobin (Hgb) concentrations, and number of red blood cells (RBC), relative to controls. The number of reticulocytes was significantly increased compared to controls for these groups (Table 3) . After 13 weeks of exposure, decreases in erythrocyte parameters were significant for high-exposure group females and for males from all three treatment groups; quantitatively, these effects were more severe than after 5 weeks of exposure. In addition, the magnitude of increase in the number of reticulocytes was smaller after 13 weeks of exposure than was observed after 5 weeks of treatment. By 26 weeks after exposure, there were small but significant differences in the numbers of RBC in samples taken from male rats in the middle-and highexposure groups; however, these differences were much smaller than that observed immediately after 13 weeks of exposure (Table  3) . By 2 to 4 weeks after exposure, the animals' eyes were sufficiently pink that high-dose animals were no longer distinguishable from controls on this basis. The total numbers of white blood cells (WBC) were similar for control and treated female rats after 5 weeks of exposure (Table   4 ). Although WBC appeared to increase for male rats in the 5-week high-dose group, this difference was attributed to one animal with an extraordinarily large neutrophil count. When data for this animal were eliminated, the mean for this group decreased so that it was no longer different from the control group. After 5-weeks exposure, numbers of eosinophils from treated animals decreased significantly relative to controls. After 13-weeks exposure, total WBC for high-exposure-group animals was significantly less than that for controls, primarily as a result of decreased numbers of lymphocytes. Numbers of eosinophils and monocytes from exposed animals were also significantly lower, relative to controls. These decreases were usually dose related with the most pronounced effects in the middle-and high-dose groups. By 26 weeks after exposure, the total number of WBC, lymphocytes, and eosinophils from the high-exposure group were still significantly below those of controls. The magnitudes of these decreases were similar to those observed for animals sampled immediately after 13-weeks exposure. After 5-weeks exposure, cholesterol concentrations for males from the high-dose group and females from the middle-and highdose group were elevated relative to controls (Table  5) . Triglyceride concentrations were significantly below controls for males from the middle-and high-exposure groups. Concentrations of albumin, globulin, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, and bilirubin, and activities of SGPT and LDH were similar for control and treated animals after 5-weeks exposure. After 13weeks exposure (Table 5) triglycerides and blood urea nitrogen had significantly increased, and total protein, albumin, globulin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) had decreased; these effects were present primarily in animals from the high-exposure group. Cholesterol concentration significantly increased for high-dose males, with a statistically significant dose-related trend. In addition, an increase in cholesterol concentration was apparent for females from the middle-exposure group but not the high-exposure group. Serum glutamic pyruvic tmnsaminase (SGPT) activ-Microscopic examination of liver sections ity increased for males from the high-dose revealed lesions in high-dose males and fegroup and decreased for females from the males after 5 and 13 weeks of exposure (Tables middle-and high-treatment groups.

Renal pelvic epithelial hyperplasia, observed in exposed animals, was characterized by proliferation of cells usually along most of the pelvic epithelial surface; this effect was more prominent at the junction of the pelvic and papillary epithelium. The papillary epithelial hyperplasia did not extend to the tip of the papillae. The thickened epithelium contained vacuoles, a few degenerative cells, and some mitotic figures (Fig. 3) . These hyperplastic lesions were present in both sexes from the highdose group after 13 weeks of exposure, in highdose male rats after 5 weeks of exposure, and in male rats from the middle-dose group after 13 weeks of exposure. Minimal to mild unidentified brown pigmentation occurred in the cortical renal tubular epithelium of male and female rats from the high-dose group after 13 weeks of exposure. When kidney sections were stained for hemosiderin and lipofuscin, the brown pigment failed to take up stain. Atrophy of the thymus was characterized by prominent lymphoid depletion and loss of normal cortical-medullary architecture. This effect was apparent only in the high-dose male and female animals after 5 or 13 weeks of exposure. An apparent decrease in the number of corpora lutea relative to controls was observed in high-dose animals; other ovarian structures appeared normal. Examination of bone marrow smears from controls and high-dose rats showed that highdose animals had hypocellular marrows with a marked decrease in the number of megakaryocytes. These changes were characterized by a reduction of both myeloid and erythroid cells, with a marked shift in the myeloid/ery-RG. 3.

The sternal bone marrow sections of several high-dose male and female rats from the 13week-exposure group showed an overall decrease in most cell types (Fig. 4) . Some bone marrow sections with otherwise adequate cellularity had decreased numbers of megakaryocytes. This change was not seen in 5-week exposed animals. The number of megakaryocytes was decreased, relative to controls, in spleens of highdose male and female rats after 5 or 13 weeks of exposure. Control rats averaged five to six megakaryocytes per cross-section of spleen; similar preparations from highdose animals contained either none or one megakaryocyte. Examination of nasal tissue sections revealed exposure-related lesions, primarily restricted to the most anterior section, which were characterized by mild squamous meta-plasia and mild suppurative inflammation of the respiratory epithelial cells (Fig. 5) . Squamous metaplasia was present at the dorsolat-era1 aspects of the most anterior nasal cavity between the maxillary and nasoturbinates and at the dorsal tip of the maxillary turbinates. Squamous metaplasia was apparent in the high-dose, 13-week exposure, male and female rats; less obvious in the middle-dose, 13-week exposure, male and female rats; and possibly an effect in the high-dose, 5-week exposure male rats. Suppurative inflammation of the most anterior nasal cavity was prominent only in the 13-week, high-dose, male and female rats. Only minimal brown pigment was apparent in the mucosa and submucosa of exposed animals; staining for iron and lipofuscin was negative. Nasal respiratory epithelial cell hyperplasia was more pronounced in the high-and middledose groups of the 13-week exposure male and female rats than in the controls or low-dose groups; however, the presence of minimal to mild epithelial hyperplasia in control and lowdose group animals after 5 or 13 weeks of exposure complicated interpretation of this lesion. Nonspecific mononuclear inflammation was present and scattered throughout all treatment groups. Lesions were not detected in the larynges or tracheas of rats of any dose group. Lungs of high-dose male and female rats had minimal to mild diffuse increases in alveolar macrophages (histiocytosis) in both the 13-and 5week exposure highdose groups; this response was much less pronounced in the middle-and low-dose groups after 5-or 13-weeks exposure. There was no evidence of pigment in the lungs of exposed animals. A prominent, treatment-related lesion present near the ileocecal orifice consisted of deep, focal, mucosal ulcerations and focal ep ithelial proliferation (Fig. 6) . Frequently, the proliferating epithelium was seen beneath the muscularis mucosa. In addition, the lesion was covered with a zone of necrotic tissue, contained a mixed inlIammatory cell reaction that extended into the submucosa and muscularis, and had a peripheral zone of granulation tissue. Occasionally, epithelial hyperplasia and inflammation were present without ulceration. Warthin-Starry silver stains and electron microscopic examination failed to demonstrate the presence of microorganisms that could be implicated in the etiology of the lesion. These lesions were most pronounced in both sexes after 13-week exposure and, to a lesser degree, in males from the highdose group after 5-week exposure. Females from the 5-week exposure, high-dose group had evidence of only the chronic inflammatory infiltrate. FIG. 6.

Hyperplastic epithelium is also seen below the muscularis mucosa (arrow), and prominent chronic inflammation of the submucosa (C) is evident. (H&E stain; original magnification, X50). Epithelial hyperplasia of the squamous portion of the stomach was observed in two male and two female high-dose rats after 13-weeks exposure and in two male rats from the highdose group after 5-weeks exposure. Urinary bladder epithelial hyperplasia was present in two female rats from the high-dose group after 13-weeks exposure and in one female rat from the high-dose group after 5 weeks of exposure; although these lesions were few in number and minimal in severity, they may represent changes attributable to the exposure. Serologic tests on blood samples collected at the 13-week termination were negative for Kilham rat virus, H-l, rat coronavirus/sialodacryoadenitis virus, and hf. pulmonis; however, titers for Sendai virus were positive. Since mice, which were housed with the rats during the exposure, had negative titers for Sendai virus, it was concluded that this infection occurred prior to beginning of the exposure.
