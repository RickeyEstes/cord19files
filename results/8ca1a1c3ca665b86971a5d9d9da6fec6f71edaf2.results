The optimized search protocols conducted from 17 to 19 October 2013 on LexisNexis identified 89,846 news records mentioning SARS and 73,587 records mentioning H1N1, for a total of 163,433 records. RAs deemed 195 of the 500 training set records to be relevant. This means the Lex-isNexis searches yielded an estimated 63,739 news records that were actually focused on SARS or H1N1 for an estimated specificity of 39.0%. The 195 relevant records in the training set had a mean overall scientific quality score of 3.17 and a mean overall sensationalism score of 1.81 with an overall Fleiss' kappa of 0.74, ICC of 0.98, and Krippendorff's alpha of 0.82, indicating substantial interrater reliability among RAs [41, 42] . Scores for specific dimensions of scientific quality ranged from 2.62 for validity (''not assessed or very misleading'') to 4.66 for applicability (''minimal ambiguity''). Scores for sensationalism ranged from 1.20 for extolling to 1.73 for speculating (both indicating ''minimal'' presence of these illocutions). Maximum entropy modeling of the 10,000 randomly selected news records provided revised aggregated estimates of scientific quality (total mean of overall Scores for overall sensa onalism Fig. 4 .

This means the average news record had ''potentially important but not critical shortcomings'' in scientific quality with ''not too much sensationalizing.'' These records can also now be stratified at the individual record level for subgroup comparisons such as between records published about different pandemics; in this example, news coverage of the H1N1 pandemic was found to be statistically significantly better than the earlier SARS outbreak (two-sample t-test 95% confidence interval for overall scientific quality score 5 [0.0982, 0.2083], P ! 0.0001; for overall sensationalism score 5 [À0.3707, À0.2549], P ! 0.0001). See Figures 3 and 4 for a summary of these results. The model performed well in the validation exercise. In the first application, the model determined relevance with 86% accuracydwhich means the model and RAs were in agreement 86% of the time on which of the 200 news records in the test set were about pandemics, and disagreed on 14% of the 200 records. In the second application, overall scientific quality was scored accurately 65% of the time (or 78% if allowing 61 deviations on the five-point scale). The model's overall sensationalism scoring was 73% accurate (or 82% if allowing 61 deviations). These statistics indicate substantial agreement between the human and computer scoring for scientific quality and sensationalism [42] . Notwithstanding errors, population-wide estimates from the model should be relatively unbiased given the histogram of misclassifications appear to be equally biased upward and downward. See Figures 5 and 6 for a summary of these results.
