K22 inhibits ZIKV in a dose-dependent manner. Given our previous findings that the small-compound inhibitor K22 may interfere with conserved features of virusinduced membrane remodeling, we hypothesized that K22 might, in addition to coronaviruses and arteriviruses, impair the replication of viruses belonging to the family of Flaviviridae, such as ZIKV. To test this hypothesis, K22-treated cells were infected with ZIKV and virus replication was assessed at 24 and 48 h postinfection (p.i.) by measuring the intracellular levels of E proteins by flow cytometry. The percentage of cells harboring replicating virus, reflected by E protein expression, was significantly decreased, in a dose-dependent manner, upon treatment of cells with K22 at 48 h p.i. (Fig. 1a) . Titration of the viral supernatant confirmed the significant inhibition of ZIKV infectivity upon K22 treatment at both time points, i.e., at 24 and 48 h p.i., with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) of 2.5 M and 2.1 M, respectively (Table 1) . Indeed, 5 or 10 M K22 was sufficient to reduce the viral titers by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude. Higher concentrations of K22 reduced viral titers by up to 4 orders of magnitude (Fig. 1b) . Flow cytometric analysis revealed no cytotoxic effect of K22 at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 1c , as determined upon application of a Fixable Aqua dead cell stain kit. These results were confirmed upon assessment of cytotoxicity using a commercially available kit (Fig. 1d) . However, similar to what has been previously reported (12) , K22 concentrations of Ն30 M mildly affected cell proliferation ( Fig. 1d ; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material), suggesting that the observed antiviral effects at concentrations of Ն30 M were slightly overestimated. In order to determine which step of the viral replication cycle is affected by K22, we performed time-of-addition experiments. To exclude the possibility of direct effects of K22 on viral particles, e.g., disruption of the viral envelope or interference with virion stability, we preincubated ZIKV with increasing K22 concentrations and subsequently assessed the remaining infectivity by titration. We showed that preincubation of K22 does not affect ZIKV infectivity (Fig. 1e ). Next, K22 was added to the cells at different times pre-or postinfection, and the effects on viral replication and infectivity were determined by titration of the viral supernatant. Interestingly, K22 also displayed antiviral activity when added at several hours postinfection, suggesting an effect on postentry stages of the ZIKV life cycle (Fig. 1f) . Collectively, our data reveal that K22 significantly inhibits ZIKV in a dose-dependent manner, likely by impairing a critical postentry step in the ZIKV life cycle. K22 inhibits several members of the family Flaviviridae. We next assessed whether K22 displays a broad antiviral effect on the replication of other Flaviviridae members. To this end, we tested the K22 sensitivity of different flaviviruses, including JEV, YFV, WNV, USUV, and WESSV, as well as the hepacivirus HCV and the two representative pestivirus BVDV biotypes (cytopathogenic [Cp] and noncytopathogenic [Ncp]) of a bovine viral diarrhea pestivirus pair. Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of K22 and infected. Intracellular levels of the flavivirus E protein, as a marker of viral replication, were assessed by flow cytometry. Moreover, viral titers in the supernatant were determined by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) titration. This showed that both JEV and YFV replication ( Fig. 2a and c) and infectivity ( Fig. 2b and (Table 1) . Slightly higher K22 concentrations (Ն20 M) were necessary to significantly inhibit USUV ( Fig. 2g and h) and WESSV ( Fig.  2i and j), with IC 50 s being between 5.9 and 10 M (Table 1) . To analyze the antiviral effect of K22 on the hepacivirus HCV, a luciferase-encoding reporter virus was used, and virus-mediated intracellular luciferase expression was measured as a marker for viral replication. Furthermore, to rule out the possibility that K22 has an impact on the luciferase reporter activity, a nonreporter HCV construct (HCV Jc1) was employed and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of HCV RNA levels was performed (Fig.  S2 ). In addition, the viral supernatant from infected, K22-treated cells was harvested and used to inoculate naive target cells before the latter were lysed and luciferase reporter activity was determined (infectivity). Similar to the findings for WNV and USUV, nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay; Promega) as well as viability assays (proliferation; MultiTox-Fluor multiplex cytotoxicity assay; Promega) were performed to determine the cytotoxic effect of K22 on Vero B4 cells at 24 h posttreatment. (e) To evaluate the direct effect of K22 on viral stability, ZIKV in DMEM was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the different K22 concentrations, and the viral titer was determined as the number of TCID 50 per milliliter. (f) Time-of-addition assays were performed to analyze the effect of K22 on the early virus-cell interaction. K22 at various concentrations was added at specific time points relative to the time of infection with ZIKV, and the cell culture supernatants were collected at 24 h p.i. for measurement of virus release. The results represent the mean (bar) ϩ SD (n ϭ 2 or 3). Dotted lines indicate the limit of detection. n.d., not detected. P values were determined by 2-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's multiple-comparison test. ****, P Յ 0.0001; ***, P Յ 0.001; **, P Յ 0.01; *, P Յ 0.05; n.s., not significant. K22 concentrations of Ն20 M led to a significant reduction of viral replication as well as infectivity ( Fig. 3a and b and S2 ). However, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell proliferation assays indicated that the cells used for infection were affected by K22 concentrations of Ն20 M (Fig. 3c) . Nevertheless, a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) value (21.3 M) 3-fold higher than the IC 50 (7.0 M) ( Table 2 ) revealed an antiviral effect of K22 on HCV which could be distinguished from the effect on cell viability. Nevertheless, careful interpretation of the data is still required, as the antiviral effect displayed by K22 may be overestimated in the context of HCV infections. Two biotypes of BVDV strain Suwa were tested for their susceptibility to K22 treatment. Viral RNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR as a correlate for viral replication, and viral titers in the supernatant were assessed by titration. Similar to the findings for HCV, K22 concentrations of Ն20 M and Ն40 M were necessary to significantly reduce the viral replication of Cp BVDV strain Suwa (BVDV SuwaCp) (Fig. 3e) and Ncp BVDV strain Suwa (BVDV SuwaNcp) (Fig. 3g) , respectively. Viral titers were significantly reduced upon treatment with 20 to 50 M K22 for BVDV SuwaCp (Fig. 3f) , with the IC 50 being 14.2 M (Table 2) , whereas at least 40 M K22 was necessary to significantly reduce the infectivity of BVDV SuwaNcp, with the IC 50 being 21.4 M ( Fig. 3h ; Table 2 ). Of note, even though no cellular toxicity resulting from K22 incubations at the concentrations indicated above could be measured, cell proliferation was affected at K22 concentrations of Ն30 M, as described before ( Fig.  3d ; Table 2 ). Collectively, our data show that K22 inhibits a broad range of Flaviviridae members, including JEV, YFV, WNV, USUV, WESSV, and, to a limited extent, HCV and BVDV. Combination treatment regimens enhance the antiviral activity of K22. Treatment options against members of the family Flaviviridae remain limited, despite the recent success regarding the treatment of HCV infections with the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAA) (14) . The recent ZIKV epidemic further underscored the importance of effective viral inhibitors, which can be applicable to rapidly control outbreaks of (re)emerging viruses. Ribavirin (RBV) and interferon alpha (IFN-␣) have been employed for their well-documented antiviral activity against several RNA viruses (15) . We therefore evaluated the antiviral potential of a combination regimen of K22 together with RBV or IFN-␣ against ZIKV. To this end, cells were treated either with K22, RBV, or IFN-␣ alone or with a two drug-combination and subsequently infected for 24 h before the viral titers in the supernatant were determined by a TCID 50 assay. A single treatment with 5 or 10 M K22 was sufficient to significantly reduce the viral titers (Fig.  4a) . A single treatment with 10 g/ml RBV moderately reduced the viral titers, whereas increased concentrations of 100 g/ml and 1,000 g/ml correlated with significantly reduced viral titers in the supernatant (Fig. 4b) . However, high RBV concentrations (100 g/ml to 1,000 g/ml) also impacted cell viability (Fig. S3b) . IFN-␣ was effective against ZIKV at doses of Ն10 IU (Fig. 4c) , with no effect on cell viability (Fig. S3c) . A combination treatment of K22 with either 0.1 or 1 g/ml RBV did not improve the antiviral effect of K22; however, the addition of at least 10 g/ml RBV in combination with low K22 concentrations (5 to 10 M) increased the overall antiviral effect ( Fig. 4d and g) . Furthermore, a combination of 10 or 20 M K22 together with 100 g/ml RBV reduced the viral titers by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude compared to those for the untreated control ( Fig. 4d and g) . Similarly, combination treatment with doses of Ն10 IU IFN-␣ together with K22 potentiated the antiviral effect ( Fig. 4e and g) . In particular, 5 to 10 M K22 combined with Ն10 IU IFN-␣ resulted in viral titers reduced by at least 3 orders of magnitude without any further impact on cell proliferation ( Fig. 4e and S3e). Combination treatments with RBV and IFN-␣ at doses of Ն100 IU IFN-␣ and Ն100 g/ml RBV increased the antiviral effectiveness against ZIKV compared to that of either single treatment (Fig. 4f) . Analysis of the drug combination K22 and RBV at concentrations in the range of the concentrations of each drug that caused only partial inhibition of replication pointed to an additive antiviral effect of the two compounds, indicated by combination indexes (CI) of about 1 (Fig. S4) . For K22 combined with IFN-␣, a slight synergism was observed for 10 IU IFN-␣ ‫37.6-(‬ ϫ 10 Ϫ6 M) and K22 concentrations between 10 and 30 M, indicated by a CI of Ͻ1. In conclusion, K22 treatments in combination with RBV and IFN-␣ allow the use of reduced K22 concentrations for a level of ZIKV replication impairment similar to that achieved with higher concentrations of K22, RBV, or IFN-␣ alone while protecting the cells from potential K22-or RBV-induced cytotoxicity when used at high concentrations.
