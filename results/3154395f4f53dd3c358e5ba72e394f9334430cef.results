The parameter set in Table 1 is used in simulating the epidemics across synthetic social networks for Seattle, Miami and MC in Virginia as displayed in Figure 2 . The incubation and infectious period parameters have been used in several studies [3, 5, 29, 35] . Under the first scenario, each true epidemic is replicated 10 times to capture the variability that could exist in surveillance data due to misreporting and inconsistency in surveillance systems. The shape of the epidemic curve, daily counts and magnitude of the epidemics differs. This suggests that forecasts made for one region are not necessarily applicable to another. We therefore present results for each of the synthetic social networks independently. Under scenario 2, we present results for MC in VA since the overall conclusions are similar across regions. The procedure is repeated 10 times for each forecast. Replications of the forecasting procedure enables the calculation of 95% confidence intervals (CI) around the mean predicted values for the peak time, peak and total infected count. Forecasts made on day j are based on available data from days 1 . . . j. We discuss forecasts made on days 14, 21 and 28 of the epidemics. The results are presented by measures forecasted; peak time, number of individuals infected at the peak and total infected. The 95% confidence intervals are also given in Figures 3, 4 and 5 .
