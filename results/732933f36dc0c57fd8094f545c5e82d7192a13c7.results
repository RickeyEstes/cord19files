pH-dependent separation of active ingredients. Studies have focused on the efficient separation of the active ingredients from Glycyrrhiza. Fu et al. 14 separated liquorice flavonoids and glycyrrhizic acid by using macroporous resins. However, the final purity was only 66% and the extraction was time-consuming. Sun et al. and Shen et al. 15, 16 studied the separation of glycyrrhizic acid and liquiritin by aqueous two-phase extraction with a non-ionic surfactant and three-liquid-phase extraction systems, respectively. However, the non-ionic surfactant that was used, Triton X-100, was costly, and the procedure of the latter method was complex. In our study, we found that pH had a significant effect on the extraction of the three components of Glycyrrhiza. Extraction by changing the pH of the solution twice offers the highest separation capacity for TFG, TSG and TTG with high extraction recovery, procedural simplicity and low cost. Moreover, the recovery (97%) is 5% higher than previously reported for other methods 17 . In addition, our method is patented 18 . As shown in Fig. 2a , pH had a great influence on TTG. Concentration of TTG that was in the organic decreased with the increase of the pH of the solution. When pH ≤ 4.0, TTG and all TFG was in the organic phase and changed little, but almost all TSG was in the aqueous phase. After separating the water layer, the organic layer was used to further determine how to separate TFG and TTG. The effect of solution pH on the extraction of TFG and TTG is shown in Fig. 2b . The amount of TFG that was in the aqueous phase increased, and the amount of TTG in the organic phase decreased with an increase in the pH of the solution. When pH = 7.0, nearly all the TFG is in the organic phase, and the TTG was only detected in the aqueous phase. Thus, TFG and TTG can be effectively separated. The result of the separation of TFG, TTG and TSG is shown in Fig. 2c . The whole-cell enzyme activity of β-glucuronidase that was produced in the absence of TSG in the control group was 94 U/mg dry biomass (mdb). The specific whole-cell enzyme activity of β-glucuronidase from whole-cell that was produced in the presence of 0.5 and 1 times of TSG in the experiment group increased were to 112 U/mdb and 120 U/mdb, respectively. The specific enzyme activity of β-glucuronidase that was produced in the presence of 2 times of TSG in the experimental group decreased to 80 U/mdb (Fig. 3b) . These results indicated that TSG could affect the specific enzyme activity of β-glucuronidase in a dose-dependent pattern in the fermentation culture medium containing BCM, GL and TSG.
