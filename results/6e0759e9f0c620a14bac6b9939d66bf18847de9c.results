Identification of cell surface vimentin as a binding protein for HPV16-PsVs. While the extracellular events preceding HPV uptake into host cells are relatively well understood (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (18) (19) (20) , the nature of the specific entry receptor is still widely debated. In an attempt to biochemically pull down cell surface molecules that interact with and potentially mediate uptake of the virus, we established an experimental system that bypasses the initial extracellular attachment steps necessary for conformational changes that ultimately lead to furin cleavage of L2 and viral uptake. We generated furin-precleaved HPV16 pseudovirions which expectedly contain some (although not all [17] ) L2 proteins with proteolytically processed N termini (Fig. 1A) . Importantly, no copurifications were visible by SDS-PAGE with silver staining, thereby minimizing the possibility of furin targeting other proteins besides the virus capsids (Fig. 1A) . Although we could not detect any obvious morphological differences between uncleaved and FPC HPV16-PsVs by negative electron microscopic (EM) staining (Fig. 1B) , furin cleavage had a substantial functional impact on infection of the HSPG-deficient cell line pgsD677: while pgsD677 cells were practically noninfectible by HPV16-PsVs, furin cleavage of the particles led to an approximately 40-fold increase in infection as measured by luciferase reporter gene activity (Fig. 1C) . Moreover, infection of CHO-K1 wild-type cells also resulted in a more robust (approximately 30-fold) increase of infection in the presence of FPC particles, while neutralization with the HPV16neutralizing antibody H16.V5 (but not with the HPV18-neutralizing antibody H18.J4) abolished infectious uptake independently of furin pretreatment as expected (53) in both cell types (Fig. 1C) . These experiments not only demonstrated the impact of furin treatment on HPV16-PsV infectivity but also confirmed the suitability of pgsD677 cells together with FPC HPV16-PsVs as an HSPG-independent infection system (17) . In order to study early steps in HPV infection involving quantification of virus internalization, we tested the effect of trypsin-EDTA on the removal of surface-bound but not internalized particles. When analyzed by flow cytometry, binding of Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester (AF488)-labeled HPV16-PsVs to pgsD677 cells for 1 h at 4°C was found to be almost completely removed by treatment with trypsin-EDTA but not with lidocaine hydrochloride-EDTA (Fig. 1D) . However, internalization of the particles was well detected when cells were subsequently shifted to 37°C for 30 min and treated with trypsin-EDTA, almost reaching the levels seen when cells were only allowed to bind for 1 h at 4°C and lifted with lidocaine hydrochloride-EDTA (Fig. 1D) . These results were also confirmed with all other cell lines used in this study (data not shown) and demonstrated the suitability of trypsin digestion for removal of surface-bound HPV16-PsVs, allowing the quantification of their internalization. Interestingly, furin pretreat-ment of the viral particles not only substantially affected infectivity of pgsD677 cells (Fig. 1C ) but also increased FPC HPV16-PsV internalization as measured by flow cytometry using AF488-labeled virions (Fig. 1E) . These data confirmed that FPC HPV16-PsVs can bypass the requirement for HSPG engagement during infectious uptake, thereby permitting direct binding to the still elusive secondary receptor (17) . was assessed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent silver staining. Note that the additional band at approximately 60 kDa is the silver-stained pGL3-control plasmid (70) . The leftmost lane shows molecular mass markers, in kilodaltons. (B) Negative EM staining of furin-treated and untreated HPV16-PsVs. (C) HSPG-deficient pgsD677 cells and their corresponding wild-type CHO-K1 cells were infected with furin-treated or untreated HPV16-PsVs. In control experiments, the virions were preincubated with either of the neutralizing antibodies H16.V5 and H18.J4. Luciferase activity of the cell lysates was measured 48 h postinfection and normalized against total protein concentration and is presented as x-fold change relative to control infection of CHO-K1 cells with untreated HPV16-PsVs, which was set as 1. (D) Quantification of viral internalization was performed by flow cytometry of pgsD677 cells infected with Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488)-conjugated HPV16-PsVs for 1 h on ice followed by 30 min at 37°C. Cells were lifted with trypsin-EDTA (Trn) to remove surface-bound virions. In control experiments, cells were either not shifted to 37°C to avoid internalization or lifted with lidocaine hydrochloride-EDTA (Lcn), which does not remove surface-bound particles. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and results were quantified by quadrant analysis of the dot plot of three independent experiments and are presented as percent change relative to the mean fluorescence intensity of cells lifted with Trn, which was set as 100%. (E) Internalization of furin-pretreated or untreated AF488-conjugated HPV16-PsVs by pgsD677 cells as determined by flow cytometry as described for panel D. Significance was calculated by means of the two-tailed Student t test from three independent experiments performed in triplicate, and a P value of Յ0.05 (*) was regarded as statistically significant. We therefore performed immunoprecipitation (IP) assays of live pgsD677 cells incubated with FPC HPV16-PsVs using the HPV16-L1-specific antibody CamVir1 ( Fig. 2A) . Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining of the gel, allowing visual comparison to appropriate controls (Fig. 2B ). Candidate protein bands were excised, processed for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) analysis, and identified using the Matrix Science Database (MSDB) and searching the NCBI database. Among the molecules identified, vimentin received the highest protein significance score, 139, and was considered an attractive candidate involved in HPV recognition and binding due to its involvement in the attachment and uptake of several other viruses and bacteria when expressed at the cell surface (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (50) (51) (52) . In order to validate the involvement of pgsD677 cell surface vimentin in FPC HPV16-PsV binding, Western blots based on the immunoprecipitation experiment shown in Fig. 2B were performed. Interestingly, when probing with antibodies raised against different vimentin epitopes (i.e., H84 versus V9), we found that the presence of the viral particles led to a slight reduction in the size of the precipitated vimentin protein (Fig. 2C ). No such protein was precipitated in the absence of FPC HPV16-PsVs. Unspecific binding of the vimentin V9 antibody to the HPV16-L1 protein (both being of similar size) was excluded in appropriate control experiments (data not shown). As it is possible that the observed different vimentin fragments were artifacts caused by proteolysis during cell isolation (54, 55) , we performed pulldown of the viral particles in a cell-free context in the presence or absence of immobilized recombinant human vimentin protein (Fig. 2D ). The purity of the vimentin protein was confirmed by silver staining following SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2E ), thereby excluding virus binding to other molecules besides vimentin. These experiments confirmed that HPV16-PsVs directly interacted with vimentin. Interestingly, this interaction was found to be independent of furin pretreatment of the viral particles. Surface vimentin colocalizes with HPV16-PsVs and affects viral uptake by pgsD677 cells. To determine if vimentin could act as a surface molecule involved in HPV uptake, we initially characterized vimentin expression in pgsD677 cells and studied binding of AF488-labeled HPV16-PsVs (both furin treated and untreated) by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The expression pattern of surface vimentin agrees with the literature, as only a small percentage of cells presented detectable vimentin at the surface (Fig. 3A) , which appeared polarized (punctate) at the cell membrane (44, 56) , with a striking localization of vimentin to filopodia near the substrate (Fig. 3E , column 1). Due to the lack of HSPGs on pgsD677 cells, total binding of the viral particles to the cells was relatively low (Fig. 3C) ; however, individual cells expressing vimentin at the surface showed impressively high binding of the viral particles, with the majority displaying colocalization with vimentin ( Fig. 3E , rows b and c). Generally, increased binding to pgsD677 cells was observed for FPC HPV16-PsVs compared to uncleaved particles ( Fig. 3C and E, rows b and c), although levels of colocalization with vimentin were comparable: 85.3% (Ϯ20.3%) of FPC HPV16-PsVs and 78.7% (Ϯ35.1%) of uncleaved particles, respectively, colocalized with surface-expressed vimentin (Table 1) . Interestingly, vimentin surface levels slightly increased over time upon infection with the viral particles; however, furin-precleaved and untreated particles had a comparable effects (Fig. 3B ). Although initial (30 min) internalization of FPC HPV16-PsVs was increased compared to untreated particles (Fig. 1E ), the two virus preparations were internalized to similar extents over a time course of 24 h (Fig. 3D ). In order to study any functional involvement of vimentin for infectious HPV internalization, we preincubated both untreated and FPC HPV16-PsVs with soluble human recombinant vimentin protein before infection. This led to a significant reduction in viral internalization as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 3F ). However, infectivity as measured by luciferase activity was not affected (data not shown), possibly due to dissociation of the vimentin-virus complexes by the time luciferase activity was measured (48 h postinfection). Vimentin modulates uptake of HPV16-PsVs in epithelial cells. Although they were found suitable in this study as a cell system to investigate HPV infection at the immediate-uptake stage (by bypassing the initial attachment steps due to their lack of HSPGs), pgsD677 cells are nonhuman and nonkeratinocytes and thereby rather unrelated to the natural infectious environment for HPV. We therefore set out to confirm our initial observations using three cell lines representing physiologically relevant cell culture models: the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa and the human immortalized keratinocyte cell lines HaCaT and NIKS, two of the most widely accepted keratinocyte models for studying HPV infection (57) . Unlike other immortalized cell lines, NIKS cells retain cell-type-specific growth requirements and differentiation properties, are nontumorigenic, and are virus free (58) . Most importantly, NIKS cells were found to support the complete HPV life cycle (59) . To verify cell surface expression of vimentin, we performed both flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy on HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS cells. Similar to the results for pgsD677 cells (Fig. 3A) , only a small fraction of cells stained positive for surface vimentin (Fig. 4A) , which appeared unevenly scattered over the cell surface, with some areas of high vimentin density (Fig. 4C) . Unlike for pgsD677 cells (Fig. 3C) , binding of HPV16-PsVs to HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS cells was found to be much higher over the entire cell population as observed by flow cytometry, as attachment of the viral particles to HSPGs at the cell surface could occur (Fig. 4B) . Interestingly, binding of untreated and FPC HPV16-PsVs occurred at comparable extents for the individual cell systems (Fig. 4B) , with HeLa Ͼ HaCaT Ͼ NIKS. This cell line-specific trend was also reflected at the level of luciferase activity being a readout for infectivity (57) (data not shown), with furin treatment largely increasing infection in the individual cell system Role of Vimentin in HPV16 Infection Journal of Virology (Fig. 1C) . However, individual vimentin-positive cells showed comparable particlebinding patterns of both untreated and FPC HPV16-PsVs when analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4C ) in the three cell lines. Again, clear colocalization of AF488-labeled viral particles to surface-expressed vimentin was observed on HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS cells (Fig. 4C) , with no obvious difference between uncleaved and FPC HPV16-PsVs (Table 1) . Having demonstrated that all three cell lines expressed vimentin at the cell surface which colocalized with the viral particles ( Fig. 4A and C) , we next set out to investigate whether it also affected HPV16-PsV internalization, leading to infection. We preincubated the viral particles with soluble human recombinant vimentin protein before infection. As already seen for pgsD677 cells (Fig. 3F) , this treatment led to a substantial reduction in viral internalization in all cell systems (Fig. 4D) ; however, infectivity was not affected for the reasons mentioned above (data not shown). Furin pretreatment did not influence virion internalization (Fig. 4D) , unlike what was seen in pgsD677 cells (Fig. 1E) , which is consistent with expression of HSPG in these human cells. The observed reduction in viral uptake upon preincubation of the virus particles with soluble vimentin (Fig. 3F and 4D ) could be explained either by competition for surface-expressed vimentin (if vimentin functions as an uptake molecule), by a sequestering function vimentin employs toward infectious HPV particles, or by interference of vimentin with viral binding to the still-unknown entry receptor. We therefore altered vimentin expression in HeLa and NIKS cells by either small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown or overexpression. Interestingly, reduced vimentin expression upon knockdown by vimentin-specific siRNA ( Fig. 5A and B) led to an increase in HPV16-PsV binding and internalization which was independent of prior furin treatment (Fig. 5C  and D) . Likewise, infection as measured by luciferase activity was significantly increased when vimentin expression was reduced, which was more pronounced when the particles were not pretreated with furin ( Fig. 5C and D) . Consistent with the observed increase in viral internalization upon vimentin knockdown, increasing the amount of surface vimentin by transient overexpression (Fig. 6A) significantly decreased HPV16-PsV binding and uptake independently of prior furin treatment ( Fig. 6B and C) . This was also accompanied by significant decreases in luciferase activity in both cell systems ( Fig.  6B and C).
