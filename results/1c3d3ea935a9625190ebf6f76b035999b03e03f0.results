The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was detected and confirmed by qRT-PCR in a total of 88 clinical samples from study patients showing ILI in Oaxaca, Mexico (Table S1) . To identify associated pathogens in the 88 samples, we used the microarray RPM-Flu 3.1.TessArray. A total of 71 patients presented copathogens with bacteria and/or viruses other than influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (Table S1) (Figure 1) . A medium number (14.7%) of prevalent bacteria were P. aeruginosa. A few patients (range of prevalence 2.2%-7.9%) harbored other species of bacteria, such as H. parainfluenzae, S. aureus, P. putida, P. mendocina, and N. gonorrhoeae. Less prevalent species of bacteria and viruses (1.1%) found are also summarized in Figure 1 . Table 3 highlights the copathogens identified as colonizers of the respiratory tract and coinfection with pathogens found in the 88 H1N1 patients of Oaxaca. Of the 22 symptoms identified, the most common were fever in 85 patients (96%), impaired general health in 85 (96%), cough in 84 (95%), headache and myalgia in 75 (85%), rhinorrhea in 72 (82%), odynophagia in 57 (65%), cold in 56 (64%), and nasal congestion in 52 (59%). Most signs and/or symptoms were found among study participants 0.4-30 years old infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and microbial infection ( Figure 2 ). Six of the 88 patients experienced disease severity and were admitted to the intensive care unit (Table S1 ). Two of four dead patients harbored three bacteria. One male aged 30 years had S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and N. meningitidis. He was treated on an outpatient basis, and (Table S1 ) and died during the period of confinement (puerperium) just after childbirth. The remaining two dead patients harbored two bacteria. One male aged 22 years had S. pneumoniae and N. gonorrhoeae. He was treated on an outpatient basis, presented multiple symptoms, and was asthmatic. One 8-month-old male had H. influenza and S. mitis. The baby presented multiple symptoms, and was also asthmatic.
