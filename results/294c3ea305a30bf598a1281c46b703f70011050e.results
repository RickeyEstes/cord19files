One virus was identified in 830 cases (64.9% of the samples analyzed). IAn/H1N1 was the most frequently detected (571 cases), followed by rhinovirus (155 cases), parainfluenzavirus (50 cases), IB (37 cases) and RSV (17 cases). Neither metapneumovirus nor coronavirus were detected. Dual infections were found in only 41 cases, being IAn/H1N1 and rhinovirus the most common viruses implicated (27 cases, 3.9% of the total samples). The age of the individuals was one of the factors analyzed. While, IAn/H1N1 was more frequently detected in children aged 6-14 years than in those less than 5 years old (p < 0.0001) and in adults aged 15-30 years than in those more than 31 years old (p < 0.0001), rhinovirus and IB were detected with a similar frequency among all the groups of age. RSV was more frequently detected in children less than 2 years old than in those more than 6 years old (p = 0.05) ( Table 2) . The relationship between symptoms included in the clinical case definition for influenza and the respiratory virus identified is shown in Table 3 . It is worth to note that although the presence of fever, the most important symptom included in clinical influenza case definition, is more frequent in IAn/H1N1 infected-patients than in those infected with rhinovirus (p < 0.0001), other symptoms, such as malaise (p = 0.0004), myalgia (p < 0.0001), cough (p < 0.0001) and respiratory syndrome (p < 0.0001), are more frequently found in rhinovirus-infected patients than in those infected with IAn/H1N1. The distribution of the detected virus, according to laboratoryconfirmed cases, showed that although IAn/H1N1 was distributed throughout the 2009 pandemic period, the epidemic peak was observed in October and November. Rhinovirus showed a peak in May preceding the apparition of IAn/H1N1 (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, a second rhinovirus peak is observed in September 2009 preceding the maximum detection peak of IAn/H1N1 (Fig. 1) . A similar behavior was observed during the 2010-2011 influenza season, when rhinovirus and influenza virus epidemic peaks appeared one after the other (Fig. 2) , although the influenza peak was observed later (weeks 50-52). On the other hand, although the amount of declared cases by ASSN according to clinical case definition is low between May and August, an increase can be observed from September with rates higher than 100 cases/100,000 inhabitants (Fig. 1) .
