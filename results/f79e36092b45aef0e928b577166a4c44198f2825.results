A total of 100 cases with smear-positive PTB and 100 healthy controls were recruited to the study. The mean age of cases was (28.83 ± 6.12, range 21-46 years) and the mean age of controls was (26.18 ± 4.35, range 19-53 years). 46 individuals of cases were males and 54 individuals were females, and 58 individuals of controls were males and 42 individuals were females. The genotype distribution of MBL polymorphisms in all subjects did not deviate from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05). The results of the association between the MBL AB (+ 230) (rs1800450), HL (− 550) (rs11003125), PQ (+4) (rs7095891) and XY (−221) (rs7096206) genotypic and allelic frequencies and the risk of PTB were listed in Tables 2 and 3 . In PTB patients, the HH, HL, LL genotype frequencies of the MBL gene were 35%, 43% and 22%, while these were 22%, 48% and 30% in healthy individuals respectively. The genotypic frequencies of MBL AB, PQ and XY polymorphisms did not have significant difference between the PTB and the controls. Based on the analysis of loci, we found that MBL (HH) genotype polymorphism significantly was associated with increased susceptibility to TB (35% in patients vs. 22% in controls, P = 0.0417, OR = 1.909, %95 CI = 1.020-3.573). Additionally, H allele showed a significant association with increased risk of TB (56.5% in patients vs. 46% in controls, P = 0.0357, OR = 1.525, %95 CI = 1.028-2.262). Also, the distribution of L allele in patients was significantly lower frequency in TB patients compared to controls (43.5% vs. 54%, P = 0.0357, OR = 0.656, %95 CI = 0.442-0.973). For MBL-HL (rs11003125) polymorphism, the genotype (HH) and H allele increased PTB risk by 1.909-fold and 1.525-fold respectively among patients compared with controls. Also, the L allele decreased PTB risk by 0.656-fold among patients compared with controls ( Table 2 ). The allelic frequencies of MBL AB, PQ and XY polymorphisms did not have significant difference between the patients and the controls ( Table 3 ). The combination of the seven haplotypes found in patients and controls are shown in Table 4 . In the present study we couldn't detect any significant differences between haplotypes among TB patients and healthy controls.
