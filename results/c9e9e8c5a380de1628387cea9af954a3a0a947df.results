Of the 1026 patients recruited from influenza surveillance sentinel sites between October 2016 and August 2017, a total of 217 (21.1%) nasopharyngeal specimens (about 20 per month) were randomly selected for this study according to age, location, and sex. The majority of samples originated from Yaoundé (86; 39.6%) followed by Bandjoun (44; 20.3%), Douala (20; 9.2%), Buea (19; 8.8%), Foumban (19; 8.8%), Bamenda (17; 7.8%) and Ebolowa (12; 5.5%). The mean age of study participants was 5.3 +/−12.5 years, with a range of 0.1-85 years. The study included 104 female (49.3%) and 107 male (50.7%) patients. The study population consisted of 138 (63.6%) ILI (ambulatory patients) and 79 (36.4%) SARI (hospitalized patients). We included 14 respiratory virus targets tested in common by the FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 and singleplex CDC assays in the comparative analysis (Table 1 ). The targets of HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and influenza A showed 100% agreement between the FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 and singleplex CDC results. For the remaining pathogens, the positive percent agreement ranged from 25% for HPIV-4 to 97.3% for HRSV. The negative percent agreement ranged from 90.6% for HAdV to 99.5% for HPIV-2. An excellent agreement (k N 0.8-1) was obtained for the HRSV, HMPV, HPIV-2, HAdV, RV, 229E, NL63, HKU1 and influenza A targets. The agreement between the FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 and singleplex CDC was satisfactory (k N 0.6-0.8) for the targets HPIV-1 (k = 0.77), HPIV-3 (k = 0.75) and OC43 (k = 0.69). The agreement in the detection of influenza B and HPIV-4 was average (k N 0.4-0.6) and low (k N 0.2-0.4), (k = 0.51 and k = 0.24, respectively). According to the McNemar test, the FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 and singleplex CDC tests show significant differences in detection for the OC43 and influenza B targets. A total of 24% (52/217) of the tested samples showed discrepant results between the FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 and singleplex CDC techniques. The majority of discrepancies (44/52; P b 0.001) were recorded for samples with multiple pathogen detections. Discrepancies were predominant in the detection of HAdV (8.8%; 19/217) followed by RV (6%; 13/217) and influenza B (4.1%; 9/217). The Ct of the FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 and singleplex CDC discordant tests are reported in Fig. 2A and B. Most discordant results were observed for samples with low viral load (median Ct N 35) except HPIV-4, RV and influenza B targets. The costing calculation estimated that the FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 was 1.6 times more expensive than testing 14 pathogens using the singleplex CDC assay, yet 2 times as fast. During this study, the singleplex CDC tests required approximately 7 hours for extraction and amplification of 12 samples including controls for 14 viral targets in two manipulations. The FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 technique, on the other hand, required about 3.5 hours for the extraction and amplification of 12 samples, including the controls of the 21 targets for a single manipulation. Table 2 describes the theoretical reagent and labor costs associated with conducting the two described methods for 12 samples at the CPC. Total cost per specimen was $42.66 and $26.83 for the FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 technique and the singleplex CDC method respectively. The cost of the singleplex CDC assay is even lower when testing for fewer than 14 viruses. Both techniques had a similar duration for analysis of the amplification results. Overall, one or more respiratory viruses were found in 179 (82.5%) and 183 (84.3%) samples by the singleplex CDC and FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 assays, respectively. A single virus was detected in 94 and 93 samples by the singleplex CDC and FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 assays, respectively. Multiple detections were present in 85 samples by the singleplex CDC assay (67 double detections, 14 triple detections and 4 quadruple detections) and 90 samples by the FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 assay (60 double detections, 23 triple detections, 5 quadruple detections and 2 quintuple detections). Except Inf A H1N1 2009 and Mpneu, all other respiratory pathogens tested for were detected. The respiratory virus most commonly detected by singleplex CDC assays (85; 39.2%) and FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 (78; 35.9%) was HAdV followed by HRSV and RV. Table 1 presents the detection frequencies of the respiratory pathogens found by the singleplex CDC and FTD® Respiratory Pathogens 33 assays during this study. Using the FTD multiplex, co-detection was more commonly observed in ambulatory outpatients when compared to hospitalized patients (χ 2 = 7.16; P = 0.007). There were 21/79 (26%) SARI specimens and 62/138 (45%) ILI specimens with multiple viruses detected in each sample. When comparing co-detection patterns from the 79 SARI specimens with a random sampling of 79 ILI specimens, the detections in hospitalized patients had 16 different viral combinations (10 combinations of 2 viruses, and 6 combinations of 3 viruses), compared to the out-patient specimens with 26 different viral combinations (13 combinations of 2, 10 combinations of 3, and 3 combinations of 4). When testing for 27% fewer organisms using the CDC singleplex assays, the same strong co-detection pattern was not observed (24/59, 40.7% SARI and 60/118, 50.8% ILI specimens had multiple viruses, χ 2 = 1.63; P = 0.202). A random sample of 59 SARI specimens had 13 viral combinations and ILI specimens had 16 viral combinations.
