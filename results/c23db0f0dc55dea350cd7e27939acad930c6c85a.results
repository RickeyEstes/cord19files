A total of 16,189 suspected cases were included in the study, of which 348 (2.15%) had a confirmed laboratory infection with another tested negative on the RT-PCR. The mean age for the suspected cases was 40 year of age, and the mean age for confirmed cases was 52 year of age. The majority of the confirmed cases were male (62%). More comorbidities are common among the confirmed group including hypertension and diabetes compared to the suspected cases. (For more sample characteristics, see Table 1 ). Of the 16,189 suspected cases, complete data were analyzed for 3154 to assess factors that are independently associated with MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV infection was associated with age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.06; 95% CI [1.02-1.098], Pvalue = 0.004), male gender (AOR = 1.617; 95% CI [1.365-1.77], P-value < 0.001) and diabetes (AOR = 1.68; 95% CI [1.346-1.848], P-value = 0.002. There was no significant association with the other comorbidities. Medication history was not associated with an increase or decrease the likelihood of the infection [ Table 2 ].
