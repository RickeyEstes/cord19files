During the study period, 134 cases of severe bronchiolitis caused by respiratory virus confirmed in pediatric patients 2 years or younger were treated in the pediatric Emergency department, and none were hospitalized on 2 or more occasions. Table 1 summarizes the demographic data of the patient and health control groups; the data were compared between both groups. The mean age of children with severe bronchiolitis was 6.6 ± 5.7 months (range, 1-24 months), which did not differ from that of the control group (mean age, 6.61 ± 5.6 months; P = .748). The patient group was predominantly male (60.5%, 81/134), but the control group was not (39.5%, 53/134; P = .0006).
