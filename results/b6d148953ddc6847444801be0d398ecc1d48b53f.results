Small disruptions of S3 or S4 have little effect on viral phenotype and negative-strand subgenomic RNA synthesis In the Zust et al. model of the MHV 3′UTR (Zust et al., 2008) , nucleotides 0 to 9 (note that the 5′-most A of the poly(A) tail is designated as position 0) are base paired with the L1 loop of the pseudoknot to form a helical stem (labeled S3 in Fig. 1A) ; nucleotides 18-29 are base-paired (S4 in Fig. 1A ) with sequences downstream of the pseudoknot stem S2. In an earlier study of protein interacting sequences in the 3′UTR (Johnson et al., 2005) , three mutations that mapped to S3 and/or S4 (see Fig. 1 ) in the Zust et al. model of the MHV 3′UTR (Zust et al., 2008) were examined for their effects on replication. These mutations, originally named ATW3′, ATW5′, and ATW (Johnson et al., 2005) have been renamed as A, B, and AB in the current study to increase clarity (see Fig. 1B and C). When these three mutations are introduced into the genomic RNA, genomes containing the A and B mutations lead to viable viruses, however, the genome containing the AB mutation is lethal (Johnson et al., 2005) . Based on our earlier results with the A, B, and AB mutants we hypothesized that the presence of either of the two stems is sufficient for a viable virus, but disruption of both stems is lethal. To investigate this hypothesis and to perform a genetic test of the Zust secondary structure model of the 3′UTR, we made a series of additional mutations targeting S3 and S4. Mutations C and D, were designed to destabilize S3 and S4 respectively; mutation CD destabilizes both S3 and S4 (Fig. 1B) . Mutations that affected both sides of S3 and S4 were designated ABD, ABC, and ABCD (Fig. 1C) . When mutations C, D, ABC, and ABD, which destabilize base-pairing in either the S3 (D, ABC) or S4 (C, ABD) helices were introduced into the genomic RNA, they all produced viable virus with somewhat smaller plaque sizes compared to the wild type virus ( Fig. 2A) , grew with near identical kinetics to wild type virus, and achieved peak titers that were at least 25% of those achieved by wild type virus (Fig. 2B ). However, for genomes carrying mutation CD, a mutation which disrupts basepairing in both S3 and S4, we were unable to recover virus in multiple trials, thus we concluded that this mutation was lethal, similar to the results we obtained with the A, B, and AB mutations in our previous work (Johnson et al., 2005) . Furthermore, when mutant ABCD, which restores base-pairing in stems S3 and S4 but alters the sequences of these stems, was introduced into the genomic RNA it was viable and generated a virus that forms plaques almost identical in size to those formed by wild type virus, grew with nearly identical kinetics to wild type virus, and achieved a peak titer nearly identical to that of wild type virus ( Fig. 2A and B ). These results are entirely consistent with the Zust model (Zust et al., 2008) of the 3′UTR and our hypothesis that base-pairing in either S3 or S4 are necessary for MHV viability. We had previously demonstrated that MHV genomes carrying the lethal AB mutation are unable to direct the synthesis of subgenomic RNA, although they are able to direct the synthesis of a minus sense complement of the genome (Johnson et al., 2005) . To determine the RNA species that might have been generated in cells electroporated with genomes containing the CD mutation, we performed nested RT-PCR assays to detect negative-strand genomic RNA and negativestrand subgenomic RNA3 and mRNA6. These RNAs serve as templates for genomic and subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Pasternak et al., 2003; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990; Sola et al., 2005; Zuniga et al., 2004) . Nested RT-PCR results showed that negative-strand genomic RNAs were present in cells at 4 and 8 h after electroporation with in vitro transcribed genomes carrying the CD mutation, similar to what we observed after electroporation of WT genomes (Fig. 2C ). In contrast, neither negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 nor RNA6 were detected in cells electroporated with in vitro transcribed genomes carrying the CD mutation, whereas cells electroporated with WT genomes contained negative-strand subgenomic RNA3 and RNA6 at 8 h incubation ( Fig. 2D and E). For each sample, parallel RT-PCR reactions without an RT step were performed to ensure that residual DNA templates taken up by the cells during electroporation did not produce PCR signals (data not shown). These data show that genomes carrying the CD mutation destabilizing stems S3 and S4 are defective in directing subgenomic RNA synthesis, the identical phenotype detected with the AB mutations on the opposing sides of the stem in our previous work (Johnson et al., 2005) .
