Induction of antigen-specific primary CD8 + T cells and CTLs in mice by OVA 257-264 -liposome conjugates Mice were immunized with OVA 257-264 -liposome conjugates in the presence of CpG as described in Materials and Methods. A significant induction of CTL specific for OVA 257-264 was observed on day 4 and a complete cell killing was observed as early as 5 days after the immunization ( Figure 1 ). Therefore, in the following experiments, primary CTL responses were monitored at 7 days after immunization. Mice were then immunized with serially diluted solution of OVA 257-264 -liposome conjugates containing 0.3 (86) to 2.4 mg (16) of peptides or OVA 257-264 solution that contained equal amounts of peptides as those in liposomal conjugates. Although OVA 257-264 -liposome and OVA 257-264 solution seemed to induce a comparable level of T-cell cytokine production at the highest dose (2.4 mg/injection), a dose-dependent decrease was observed in mice immunized with OVA 257-264 solution but not in mice immunized with OVA 257-264 -liposome, suggesting that OVA 257-264 -liposome was more effective than OVA 257-264 solution in the induction of antigen-specific CD8 + T cell cytokine production ( Figure 2A ). Similar results were observed in T cell cytokine production; a dose of OVA 257-264 -liposome as low as 0.6 mg/mouse (46 dilution) induced a perfect killing as assayed by in vivo CTL assay, while OVA 257-264 solution induced only a partial killing even at the highest dose ( Figure 2B ). weeks later, the mice received a booster injection with OVA. Three days after the booster injection, OVA 257-264 -specific cell killing was monitored. As shown in Figure 3 , a complete cell killing was observed at 2 weeks after the immunization without a booster injection and, up to 20 weeks after the immunization, a significant recall response was observed upon booster injection with OVA. Inoculation of naive mice with the same dose of OVA as the booster injection (''No imm.'' in Figure 3 ) did not induce a detectable CTL response. Interestingly, a significant recall response was observed even at 20 weeks when the primary CTL response was nearly undetectable. An antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell proliferation assay further confirmed the results; as shown in Figure 4 , CD8 + T cells of mice immunized with OVA 257-264liposome significantly proliferated upon in vitro stimulation with OVA even 20 weeks after immunization.
