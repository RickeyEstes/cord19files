Three hypotheses were stated regarding optimistic bias in the perceived risk of prostate cancer, and the impact of optimistic bias and information seeking on intention to undergo prostate cancer screening. Table 2 shows a brief description of the statistics concerning all predictor and outcome variables measured in this study. The first hypothesis, positing that respondents consider themselves less likely than others to get prostate cancer, was tested using paired t-tests (the skewness and kurtosis values of perceived risk in oneself and in others all lie between +1.0/-1.0). The statistical results of these paired t-tests revealed that respondents considered themselves less likely (M = 1.90) than others (M = 2.18) to get prostate cancer (t = -4.95, p < .001, two-tailed). The result, therefore, supported the first hypothesis (H1). The second and third hypotheses were tested using a hierarchical regression model. In the equations, the predictors were age, monthly income, optimistic bias, and seeking information about prostate cancer; the outcome variable was intention to undergo prostate cancer screening. Table 3 shows the correlations among all control and predictor variables. As Table 4 shows, given the effects of age, monthly income, and seeking information about prostate cancer, optimistic bias (b= -0.12, p = 0.10) did not significantly predict the intention to undergo prostate cancer screening. Thus, the second hypothesis (H2) was unsupported. Additionally, information seeking behavior about prostate cancer (b=0.51, p < 0.001) significantly and positively predicted the intention to undergo prostate cancer screening after controlling for age, monthly income, and optimistic bias. Therefore, the third hypothesis (H3) was supported.
