We fit the cumulative pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 case data from various southern hemisphere countries described earlier to the Richards model and its multi-wave variants. The country-wise results of model parameter estimation, using least squares techniques, are detailed in the following text. For the purpose of computing R 0 , we make use of the mean estimated generation interval (and its 95% CI) of T = 1AE91 days (95% CI: 1AE30-2AE71) as given in, 18 which was estimated from early Mexico novel H1N1 data before April 30.
