ZIKV EDIII fragments, especially E298-409, induced broadspectrum neutralizing antibodies and maintained longterm immunogenicity Three ZIKV EDIII fragments comprising residues 296-406, 298-409, and 301-404, respectively, were constructed, and each of them was fused with a Cterminal Fc (Supplementary Figure S1B) . Except for E301-404, which covers the entire sequence of EDIII (residues 301-404), both E296-406 and E298-409 have a few residues from the EDI and stalk regions (Supplementary Figure S1C ). The recombinant proteins were expressed in 293T cell culture supernatants and purified with high purity. They formed dimeric structures and maintained good conformation (Supplementary Figure S2A) . Particularly, these EDIII fragments were recognized by a mAb (ZV-54) specific to ZIKV EDIII protein (Supplementary Figure S2B ) 36 , demonstrating their strong specificity to ZIKV. To evaluate the immunogenicity of the three EDIII fragments, we used purified proteins to immunize female BALB/c mice following the immunization schedule described in Supplementary Figure S3A . Sera collected at 2 months after immunization were tested for crossneutralization against nine ZIKV strains isolated from different hosts (human, mosquito, and rhesus), various countries and regions (Colombia, Honduras, Panama, Puerto Rico, Thailand, Nigeria, Mexico, and Uganda), and different periods of time (1947, 1968, 2013, 2015 , and 2016) (Supplementary Figure S4A) . These ZIKV strains belong to diverse phylogenetic groups (Supplementary Figure S4B) and have a number of amino acid variations among their E proteins (Supplementary Figure S4C) . Compared with the E296-406 and E301-404 fragments, the E298-409 fragment induced higher titers of neutralizing antibodies able to cross-neutralize all ZIKV strains tested (Fig. 1) , including those with different EDIII sequences, e.g., PRVABC59 (isolated from a patient in an American country), IbH 30656 (isolated from a patient in an African country), and MR 766 (isolated from a rhesus macaque in an African country), and those with the same EDIII sequences, e.g., FLR, R103451, PAN2015, PAN2016, MEX 2-81 (isolated from patients or mosquitoes in American countries), and PLCal_ZV (isolated from a patient in an Asian country) (Supplementary Figure S4) . Specifically, the level of E298-409-elicited neutralizing antibodies was significantly higher than that induced by either E296-406 or E301-404 against epidemic human 2015 strains FLR (Fig. 1a) and PAN2015 (Fig. 1c) , 2013 strain PLCal_ZV (Fig. 1f) , and 1968 strain IbH 30656 (Fig. 1g) . By comparison, no ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibody was detected in the control mice injected with PBS (Fig. 1) . The above results demonstrated that ZIKV EDIII fragments, particularly E298-409, were capable of eliciting highly potent neutralizing antibodies against divergent human, mosquito, and rhesus ZIKV strains from different countries and years. To investigate the long-term immunogenicity and neutralizing activity of the ZIKV EDIII fragments, the immunized mice were observed for up to 10 months, and sera were collected at 0, 2, 7, and 10 months post immunization to test ZIKV EDIII and E-specific antibody responses and neutralizing antibodies against two selected epidemic human strains, R103451 and FLR. The data from the antibody test revealed that although all three EDIII fragments were able to elicit long-term EDIII-specific IgG antibodies, those induced by the E298-409 and E301-404 fragments showed significantly higher titers than that induced by the E296-406 fragment (Fig. 2Aa) . These IgG antibodies were further tested using a ZIKV E protein containing residues 1-454, and the results showed that the E-specific IgG antibodies corresponded to the respective EDIII-specific IgG antibodies induced by the three EDIII fragments (Fig. 2Ab) . Compared to E301-404, E298-409 elicited a relatively higher titer of EDIII-specific IgG1 (Th2-associated) antibodies (Fig. 2Ac ) but a similar level of IgG2a (Th1-associated) antibodies (Fig. 2Ad) . E296-406 induced the lowest titers of IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies among the three fragments in the test months (Fig. 2Ac, d) . E298-409 elicited more potent long-term neutralizing antibody responses than E296-406 and E301-404 against ZIKV R103451 (Fig. 2Ba) and FLR (Fig. 2Bb ) strains for at least 10 months (Fig. 2B) . In contrast, control PBS induced only background levels of IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a antibody responses and neutralizing antibodies against the two tested ZIKV strains (Fig. 2) . The above data indicate that ZIKV EDIII fragments, especially E298-409, maintained the immunogenicity required to elicit long-term EDIII and E-specific antibody responses, particularly neutralizing antibody responses against infection with variant epidemic human ZIKV strains. ZIKV EDIII fragments protected pups born to immunized BALB/c mice against challenge with divergent epidemic human ZIKV strains Having confirmed the immunogenicity of ZIKV EDIII fragments, we next wanted to know whether the antibodies induced by these proteins could protect against ZIKV infection in animal models in vivo. Seven-day-old newborn mice (pups) are a convenient and effective means for evaluating the protective efficacy of ZIKV vaccines, as they are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection 17 . Therefore, we initially used pups born to immunized female BALB/c mice at 7 months post immunization for ZIKV challenge ( Supplementary Figure S3B) . Theoretically, if pups receive anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibodies from their mothers during pregnancy, they are expected to be protected against ZIKV infection. To test the protective efficacy of ZIKV EDIII fragments, pups were challenged with 5 × 10 4 PFU of the aforementioned two epidemic human ZIKV strains, R103451 and FLR, and the resulting survival and weight, as well as the neutralizing antibodies from mothers and pups, were evaluated. Except for the pups from mice immunized with E301-404, which had an~83% survival rate against ZIKV R103451 challenge, all pups born to the E298-409-and E296-406-immunized mice survived the R103451 challenge (Fig. 3a) , and all pups born to the E298-409-, E296-406-, and E301-404-immunized mice survived the FLR challenge (Fig. 3b) . All pups born to the above three EDIII fragment-immunized mice had increased weights during the detection period (14 days) after challenge with both R103451 (Fig. 3c) and FLR (Fig. 3d) strains. The evaluation of the neutralizing antibodies revealed that, similar to the immunized mothers, pups from E298-409-immunized mice had the highest neutralizing antibody titers among the three treatments against R103451 (Fig. 3e) and FLR ( Fig. 3f) strains. In contrast to the above results, pups born to the mice injected with PBS did not survive challenge with the R103451 (Fig. 3a) and FLR (Fig. 3b) strains, and all of them died at 10 and 11 days p.i., respectively, with decreased weights 4 and 6 days post-challenge with R103451 (Fig. 3c) or FLR (Fig. 3d) . This result is mainly because no neutralizing antibodies were detected in the mothers injected with PBS (Fig. 3e, f) . The above results demonstrated that pups born to mice immunized with ZIKV EDIII fragments, particularly E298-409, were protected against infection with divergent ZIKV strains, possibly because maternal neutralizing antibodies had been transferred via placenta from mothers to fetuses during pregnancy. , PLCal_ZV (f), and IbH 30656 (g), as well as from mosquito, MEX 2-81 (h), and rhesus, MR 766 (i). Neutralizing activity is expressed as 50% neutralizing antibody titer (PRNT 50 ), and the data are presented as the means ± SE of the mice in each group (n = 5). Significant differences were noted between E208-409 and the other two EDIII fragments against FLR (**P < 0.01), R103451 (*P < 0.05), PLCal_ZV (*P < 0.05), and IbH 30656 (**P < 0.01), respectively. The experiments were repeated twice, and similar results were obtained
