Sampling was performed from May to December in 64 cats and during the rest of the year in the remaining 36. The signalment and living conditions of group A and group B cats, the clinical signs of group B cats and their final diagnoses have been previously reported (Chatzis et al., 2014) . None of the group B cats was diagnosed with leishmaniosis. Based on the results of PCR, 41/100 cats (21/ 50 group A and 20/50 group B cats) were infected by L. infantum whereas the remaining 59 cats were non-infected (Chatzis et al., 2014) . Since none of the 75 control serum samples reacted even at the lowest dilution, the cut-off value of IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgG and anti-Leishmania IgM was established at ≥1/10. There was a significant agreement between the first and the second IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgG in the 35 randomly selected group A, group B and control serum samples (P = 0.689): 34 of these samples were negative and one was positive in the first run and all 35 were negative when IFAT was repeated. The average ELISA OD and standard deviation (SD) of the 75 control serum samples were 0.089 and 0.014, respectively. Consequently, the cut-off OD was established at 0.145 (average + 4 SD), whereas, results between 0.117 (average + 2 SD) and 0.145 were considered equivocal (Solano-Gallego et al., 2007) . Low IFAT titer for anti-Leishmania IgG was detected in 10 (10%) study cats (titer 1/20 in two cats and 1/40 in eight cats); they included five group A and five group B cats that had been sampled from May to December (n = 6) or during the rest of the year (n = 4). ELISA for anti-Leishmania IgG was positive in only one cat with OD: 0.154 (5.9% above the cut-off OD) and equivocal in another cat (OD: 0.125); both cats belonged to group A, were IFAT-negative and had been sampled on May 2009 and March 2010, respectively. IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgM was positive (titer: 1/20) in one group A cat that had been sampled on January 2009 and was also IFAT-positive for anti-Leishmania IgG antibodies. There was disagreement between the results of IFAT and ELISA for anti-Leishmania IgG (P = 0.039), IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgG and PCR (P < 0.001), ELISA and PCR (P < 0.001) and IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgM and PCR (P < 0.001) (Supplementary Table S1 ). The diagnostic sensitivity of all serological tests, using PCR as the gold standard, was very low although specificity of ELISA and IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgM was 100% (Table 1) . In an effort to assess whether the cut-off titer was responsible for the low sensitivity of IFAT, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and Youden index were re-calculated for each possible cut-off (Table 1) . Based on these results, the highest Youden index of IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgG can be achieved using a cut-off titer of ≥1/40, whereas the cut-off titer that was applied in this study (≥1/10) and that of ≥1/20 correspond to the highest Youden index of IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgM. Regarding ELISA for anti-Leishmania IgG, no appreciable improvement of diagnostic accuracy could be achieved by modifying the cut-off OD since the AUC was only 0.519 (Fig. 1) . There was no significant association between the result of IFAT for anti-Leishmania IgG and signalment, living conditions or season of sampling (Supplementary Table S2 ) of group A, group B or both group A and B cats, the group of cats (P = 1), the presence of clinical signs that may be compatible with feline leishmaniosis in group B cats (Supplementary Table S3 ) and the seropositivity to each of the other infectious agents that have been examined for group A, group B or both group A and B cats (Supplementary Table S4 ).
