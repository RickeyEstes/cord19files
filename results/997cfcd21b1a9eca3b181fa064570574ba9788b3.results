Mortality in the dogs groups was not observed throughout the experiment. Table 1 shows the parasitemia in both groups of dogs. While both control and immunised dogs developed detectable parasitemia, vaccinated dogs presented lower parasitemia. These findings were statistically significant when the overall results for both groups were compared as a whole at days 15, 25 and 35 p.i. (Î± = 0.025, Mann-Whitney Utest). Moreover, the parasitemic phase was shorter among immunised dogs, since no blood parasites were detected at day 35 p.i. by direct microscopic examination as well as the Strout's concentration method. On the contrary, all of the non-immunised infected dogs still displayed detectable circulating parasites at day 35 p.i. When xenodiagnosis was performed, the proportion of infected bugs fed on the vaccinated dogs at day 45 p.i. was significantly lower as compared with the control group (Table 1) , from 67.5% (27/40) to 28.1% (16/57), respectively (Odds ratio = 0.19; 95% CI: 0.07-0.49; p < 0.0003). Effectiveness 81 (51-93). In the xenodiagnosis performed on day 60 p.i., these proportions were 2.6% (2/75) and 21.4% (15/70), respectively (Odds ratio = 0.10; 95% CI: 0.01-0.47; p < 0.002). Effectiveness 90 (53-99). The levels of T. cruzi antibodies were measured before and after infection. Table 2 shows that in control dogs antibodies were detected, as expected, only after infection, whereas in immunised animals they were already detected 15 days after the first vaccination dose, and were thus present at the time of infection. The titres rose until day 35 p.i. in both groups of dogs, being slightly but not significantly higher in immunised ones. The animal's weight was not modified throughout the study. The electrocardiographic studies revealed no alterations compatible with chagasic cardiomyopathy. Indeed, only respiratory sinus arrhythmias were observed in all dogs without differences between both groups.
