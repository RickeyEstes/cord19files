Overall, 111 subjects were identifi ed as RSV-infected by RT-PCR and agreed to participate in the study. Of these, 50 were hospitalized and 61 were treated as outpatients. Thirty-three of 50 inpatients (66%) received at least 1 day of systemic corticosteroids compared with three of 61 (5%) outpatients. The analysis of immunologic and virologic changes associated with systemic corticosteroid use was restricted effects on adaptive immunity, glucose control, bone metabolism, and other organ systems. [5] [6] [7] [8] Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common winter virus that infects persons of all ages and is associated with wheezing, especially in young children. 9 In children with RSV-related bronchiolitis and wheezing, systemic corticosteroids have been studied and found to provide no signifi cant clinical benefi t. [10] [11] [12] In adults, the virus has been implicated as a cause of COPD and asthma exacerbations, yet is rarely specifi cally diagnosed in clinical practice. [13] [14] [15] Because wheezing is associated with the infection, systemic corticosteroids are commonly prescribed. 16 However, the effects of short-term high-dose steroid treatment on viral load and adaptive immunity to a specifi c virus during acute infection have never been examined. Therefore, we took advantage of an ongoing study of the pathogenesis of RSV disease in adults to address these issues.
