Rates of detection of respiratory viruses in adenoids, tonsils and respiratory secretions were determined for 172 children. Genomes of at least one respiratory virus were detected in over 87% of the patients, without discernible seasonal variations (Fig. 1 ). Remarkably, high rates of virus detection were obtained from all three kinds of clinical samples throughout the study. The frequencies of virus detection ranged from 71.5% to 94.1% in adenoids, and from 37.5% to 86.6% in secretions and palatine tonsils. Of the three sample kinds, adenoid tissue yielded the highest frequencies of virus detection during almost the whole study, except for autumn months (March-June) of 2011, when nasal secretions yielded higher rates of positivity (Fig. 1) . The present analysis is based on results from a total of 172 patients, covering a 2-year period, and raises new issues made clear upon inclusion of additional cases to a study that was underway [3] . Overall, the most frequent viruses were human adenovirus (HAdV) detected in 52.8%, followed by human enterovirus (HEV) in 47.2%, human rhinovirus (HRV) in 33.8%, human bocavirus (HBoV) in 31.1%, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in 18.3%, human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) in 17.2%, influenza virus (FLU) in 4.5%, human parainfluenzavirus (HPIV) in 4.5%, and human coronavirus (HCoV) in 2.7%. The frequencies of HAdV, HBoV and HRSV were higher in adenoids, whereas HRV was more frequently detected in nasal secretions and HEV in palatine tonsils. The rates of viral co-infections and the agreement between results from different tissues were high. In this 2-year study period, two or more viruses were detected in 62.2% of the patients, and 54% of them had the same virus detected in adenoids and palatine tonsils. Overall, HAdV detection rates fluctuated from summer troughs of approximately 37.5% up to peaks of greater than 70% in spring-2011 and autumn-2012, without clearly seasonal periods (Fig. 2 ). HBoV detection rates were usually above 20% (12.5-46%) without discernible seasonality (Fig. 3) . Detection frequencies of HAdV and HBoV were consistently higher in adenoids than in other samples. Rates of detection of the picornaviruses HRV and HEV were opposite in the summer, while the rate of HEV detection was at its [ ( F i g . _ 1 ) T D $ F I G ] peak, HRV was at its lowest ( Figs. 4 and 5) . The overall HEV detection rates were composed mostly by results obtained from adenoids and palatine tonsils, while detection in respiratory secretions was found in a smaller proportion of the HEV-positive patients (Fig. 4) . Although peaks of HEV detection occurred in summer/autumn months, the rates of HEV positivity were always above 30%, indicating that a great proportion of tonsil tissues harbour HEV, independently of the season of the year. Contrary to HEV, HRV overall rates showed no clear seasonal variations, and were mostly composed by results obtained from secretions, with correspondingly lower rates of positivity in tonsillar tissues (Fig. 5) . Rates of detection of the paramyxoviruses HMPV and HRSV varied from 0% to 31% during the study period (Figs. 6 and 7 ). HRSV detection reached maximum level in spring/winter months, mostly composed by detection in respiratory secretions, with summer nadirs in both years of the study (Fig. 6) . Differently, HMPV overall detection rates did not vary significantly during the study period (Fig. 7) , and the nadir observed in the summer of 2012 probably reflects the low number of samples analysed in that season. FLU, HPIV and HCoV were detected in very low frequencies, with sporadic cases distributed during the 2-year study period without seasonal pattern.
