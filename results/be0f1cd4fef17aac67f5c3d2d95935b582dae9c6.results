Choice of the Restrictive (40Â°) and Permissive @lo) Temperature, Growth Kinetics of Wild-Type MHV-A59 at These Temperatures Wild-type virus plaqued equally well on mouse L cells at 31", 37", and 40". Also in Sac(-) cells similar virus titers were reached at the three temperatures ( Fig.  1A ; Spaan et al., 1981) but whereas maximum virus yields in the medium were obtained at 8 hr at 40", about 16 hr was needed at 31". As described before (Spaan et aZ., 1981) , virus yield at 37" is maximal at 10 hr p.i. The accumulation of virusspecific RNA was determined by measuring the incorporation of rH]uridine into actinomycin D-treated Sac(-) cells. Figure 1B shows that it closely followed the curve for virus release. On the basis of this experiment virus-specific RNA synthesis in mutants was studied from 8 to 16 hr at 31" and from 4 to 9 hr at 40'. EGFluorouracil was chosen as a mutagen under conditions where it induced l-2% ts mutants (Van Berlo et cd, 1980), a pro- portion at which multiple ts lesions are not likely to occur. A prescreening of ts mutants was made on the basis of their inability to induce syncytia at 40'. This resulted in 148 potential mutants out of a total of 1284 isolated plaques. The final selection was made by plaquing potential mutants at the permissive and restricted temperature. Only those mutant having a relative plating efficiency 40"/31" of 3 X 1O-3 or less were kept. This resulted in 20 mutants, i.e., 1.6% of the initial number of virus clones. A number of biological characteristics of the mutants are summarized in Table  . Among them are the yields after one step growth at 40", 37", and 31" which allow calculations of the leakiness of a mutant. Knowledge of virus growth at 37", the approximate body temperature of mice (Weir, 1947) is relevant for the interpretation of in vivo infection experiments.
