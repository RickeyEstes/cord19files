Generation of recombinant TGEV virus (rTGEV) lacking gene 7 TGEV ORF 7 encodes a 78 amino acid hydrophobic protein. The structure predicted for protein 7 contains two transmembrane domains (TM) at the amino-(aa 1-18) and carboxy-termini (aa [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] , of the protein. The N-terminal TM domain overlaps with a signal peptide (aa 1-24) ( Figure 1A ). The predicted membrane topology locates the middle part of the protein towards the lumen of a membrane structure ( Figure 1A ). During TGEV infection, protein 7 was detected associated to the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and plasma membranes [56] . To study the role of protein 7 during TGEV infection, an rTGEV virus lacking gene 7 (rTGEV-D7) was engineered ( Figure 1B ) [57] . To avoid gene 7 expression, several modifications that led to an inactive ORF7 transcription regulating core sequence (CS) were introduced ( Figure 1B , left panel). The two first nts of protein 7 translation start codon were also removed ( Figure 1B, left panel) . These mutations introduced into the TGEV infectious cDNA, were predicted to knock down gene 7 expression with minimum alteration to the 39end of the viral genome, which is required for viral replication [58, 59] . All the mutations introduced in the cDNA were present in the recovered rTGEV-D7 virus, after 6 passages in tissue culture of a plaquepurified virus, indicating that they were stably maintained in the rTGEV genome. The absence of subgenomic mRNA-7 in rTGEV-D7 infected cells was confirmed by Northern-blot ( Figure 1B, right panel) . Viral titer and genomic RNA (gRNA) levels were analyzed. Intracellular RNA was only analyzed during those times post infection in which viable cells were bound to the plate (up to 24 hpi). Both mutant and parental viruses showed the same virus growth kinetics and gRNA accumulation ( Figure 1C ). The rTGEV-D7 virus titer decreased after 24 hours post infection (hpi) due to the absence of live cells. This result was expected, rTGEV-D7 virus titer decreased at a ratio of 1 log unit per day due to thermal instability and to the absence of viable cells, at this time
