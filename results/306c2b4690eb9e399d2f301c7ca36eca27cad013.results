Optimization of the binding of HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein to L. lactis L. lactis surface displaying HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein was immunofluorescencelabeled with Alexa Fluor 488. The percentage of Alexa Fluor 488-positive gated cells (L. lactis surface displaying HA1/L/AcmA) increased steadily when increasing amount of HA1/L/ AcmA recombinant protein was added to 1-3×10 9 CFU of L. lactis ( Fig 1A) . The percentage of Alexa Fluor 488-positive gated cells reached plateau when 20 μg of HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein was used. The results suggested that the optimum amount of HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein to be incubated with 1-3×10 9 CFU of L. lactis cells for surface display was 20 μg. The percentage of L. lactis surface displaying HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein following incubation of L. lactis with 20 μg of HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein in GM17 for 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h was examined. The percentage of Alexa Fluor 488-positive gated cells reached plateau when 20 μg of HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein was incubated with L. lactis cells for 2 h, suggesting that incubation for 2 h was optimum for surface display of HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein ( Fig 1B) . The binding of HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein on L. lactis started to dissociate after an incubation period of 3 h. The suitability of the buffer used for binding of HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein to L. lactis was also evaluated. The percentage of L. lactis surface displaying HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein after 2 h incubation with HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein in GM17 and PBS was 53.8±0.9% and 52.3±5.5%, respectively, suggesting that the number of L. lactis cells detected to have HA1/L/AcmA on its cell wall was similar in both buffers ( Fig 1C) . Therefore, the MFI value of L. lactis surface displaying HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein was examined. The MFI value obtained for HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein binding in GM17 (4552 ±614.9) was significantly higher in comparison to PBS (2538±243.4). This suggested that more recombinant proteins were bound per L. lactis cells in GM17 and hence, was a better binding buffer.
