On average each participant had 137.4 treatments during the observation period. Compared to long-term averages, outside temperatures were warm in December and January (+1.3O and +2.1Â° versus -0.4OC, -1.7OC) and cold in March' (2.5OC versus 3.3OC). The expected frequency of common colds during the trial period was 50 events for each group (Gwaltney e t a / , 1966) . The recorded frequency was 35 in group 1 and 46 in group 2. This difference was statistically significant. In the first half of the observation period 25 events were recorded in group 1 and 23 and group 2. The respective figures were 10 and 23 in the second half (not analysed statistically due to small numbers). Figure 2 shows the cumulative frequency as a function of time for both groups. In group 1 there were three cases with complications (bronchitis or sinusitis) while in group 2 five such events were documented. The average duration per person of common colds was 5.9k3.1 days in group 1 and 7.5k5.7 days in group 2. The difference did not reach the level of significance. In the first half of the observation period, the cumulative durations (sum of days with common colds for each group) per group were 137 (group 1) and 180 days (group 2). In the second half the respective figures were 6 9 and 163 (not analysed statistically because this is not an independent variable). Figure 3 shows the cumulative duration of common colds in the two groups. The sum of scores (strength), according to the scoring system outlined above, was 63 (group 1) and 93 (group 2). In group 1, a total of 17 individuals scored an average of 0-4 points, 8 scored 5-7 points and none scored 8-14 points. The respective numbers for group 2 were 12, 9 and 4. This distribution was significantly different between the t w o groups. The total score in the first half of the observation period was 44 (group 1) and 5 0 (group 21, while in the second half these numbers were 19 and 43 (not analysed statistically owing t o small sample size). Figure 4 shows the cumulative strength of common colds in the t w o groups. Table 2 summarises the results of the blood tests. There are no significant differences between value in the presence or absence of common colds (longitudinal comparison where each subject is hislher o w n control). There were also no significant differences between the groups either in the absence or presence of common colds (cross-sectional comparison of experimental and control groups). Volunteers who subjectively felt high levels of psychoemotional stress (n=15 from group 1 and n=13 from group 2) suffered from 2.1k1.4 events while the rest (n=22) had 1.0k0.8 colds. Other factors (smoking, working in airconditioned or non-air-conditioned rooms, living in or out of town, nutritional factors, being 'weather-sensitive', regular sport), which had been estimated using a standardised questionnaire, had no apparent influence on the frequency of common colds. Only descriptive evaluation was performed on these data.
