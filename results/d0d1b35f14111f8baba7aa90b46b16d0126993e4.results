Encompassing records since 1989, the NIH RePORTER system revealed funding for 830 fiscal years for 232 different projects related to voice disorders. The NIH RePORTER system only reports specific dollar amounts for grants from 2000, and of these 232 projects, 167 (71.9%) had reported funding values. A plurality (32.8%) of 232 different grants was awarded to PIs in otolaryngology departments (Fig. 1) , with speech pathology/ communication departments being the next most common recipients (17.7%). When organizing awards by PI specialty, the majority (57.8%) of awards went to PIs with PhDs (excluding SLPs), followed by otolaryngologists and SLPs (Fig. 1) . Upon further examination of awards to otolaryngology departments, 37 of 76 projects (48.7%) had otolaryngologists as PIs (Table 1) , with the most common practitioners being non-fellowship-trained and pediatric otolaryngologists. Upon examination of temporal trends, year to year variation was noted, with a notable trend being a significant increase in funding from 2003 to 2012 among PIs in surgery departments ( Fig. 2A) . Nonetheless, the proportion of funding awarded to otolaryngology PIs remained relatively consistent during most years of this time period (Fig. 2B) . Upon examination of h-index of PIs receiving awards, otolaryngologists had statistically higher h-indices than SLPs (p =0.03) (Fig. 3) , while differences did not reach statistical significance compared to other specialties (p-values >0.05). Examination of aggregate NIH funding per PI organized by PI specialty is noted in Table 2 .
