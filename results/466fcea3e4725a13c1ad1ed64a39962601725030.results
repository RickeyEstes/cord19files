Climatic and incidence patterns of the diseases are presented in Fig. 1 . Four representative diseases were shown in this figure (others are presented in Supplementary Figs. 1-4) . At further distances from the equator, temperature and humidity show more obvious annual cycles, and there is concomitantly more cyclicity in disease incidence, as indicated in the power spectra illustrated in Fig. 2 . Power spectra of average temperature and humidity are presented in Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6. Temperature in all countries has a period of one year but the cyclic effect is more marked in temperate and subtropical regions, Table 1 Sets of predictors in different models.
