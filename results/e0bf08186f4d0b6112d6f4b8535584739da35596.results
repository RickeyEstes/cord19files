Biological data and clinical history. There was no difference in the gender (females, 7; males, 8) of the puppies during this study. Pure breed dogs (73.3%; 11/15) were predominant (Table 1 ) relative to their mixed breed counterparts (26.7%; 4/15) . However, when the head conformation was considered within the purebred dogs 28, 29 , most (54.5%; 6/11) were mesocephalic (medium-headed), followed by the brachycephalic (shortheaded) breeds of dogs (36.4%; 4/11) , and only one (9.1%) dolichocephalic dog. Additionally, most (72.7%; 8/11) of these were representatives of toy breeds, with only three large breed dogs. Furthermore, most (n = 5) of the cases occurred in 2013, followed by 2014 (n = 3), 2015 (n = 3), and 2017 (n = 3), with only one in 2016. The principal clinical manifestations described are resumed in Table 1 . Bloody diarrhoea (n = 11) was the most frequently described clinical manifestation, followed by anorexia (n = 5), abdominal pain (n = 4), and convulsions (n = 3). One puppy died (#12) without presenting any reported clinical manifestation. The course of clinical manifestations was acute in all puppies, varied between 1-10 days, and resulted in the spontaneous death of all puppies. The immunization history of these puppies was not known. Fig. 1 . The most common gross findings described in these puppies were pulmonary oedema, haemorrhagic enteritis (n = 8), hydrothorax, rib impressions on pleural pulmonary surface (n = 7), and pulmonary haemorrhage and congestion (n = 6). Other less frequently (n = 5) described gross lesions included prominent lobular pattern of the liver, hepatic degeneration, hydroperitoneum, and gallbladder oedema (Fig. 1A ). In addition, puppy #15 had bilateral corneal oedema, resulting in the characteristic "blue eye" phenomenon ( Fig. 1B ) seen in the late phase of infectious canine hepatitis (ICH) [30] [31] [32] [33] .
