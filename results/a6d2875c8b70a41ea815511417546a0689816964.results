We identified 13 countries or territories outside mainland China that may have under-detected COVID-19 importation from Wuhan, such as Thailand and Indonesia. In addition, 16 countries had a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%, including four outside Asia. The COVID-19 introduction index highlights potential locations outside mainland China from which cases may be imported to each recipient country. Outside of mainland China, most countries or territories we estimate as having a large number of COVID-19 cases imported from Wuhan are located in Asia (Figure 1 and Table S1 ). Outside Asia, we estimate United States, Australia, and United Kingdom as having the highest imported case count estimates (Figure 1 and Table S1 ). In addition, we also identify countries whose reported number of imported cases from Wuhan is less than the 5 th percentile of the posterior predictive distribution of our imported case estimates (Table 1) , suggesting under-detected cases imported from Wuhan in these countries or territories. In particular, we estimate that Thailand received 97 (95% CI: 66-136) imported cases from Wuhan-the largest among all the countries analyzed but have only reported ~20 cases (Table 1) . For Indonesia there have not been any reported COVID-19 cases imported from Wuhan, and yet we estimate at least 19 (95% CI: 10-30) imported cases. If we assume each country has immediately isolated all the reported cases imported from Wuhan (and therefore truncated transmission), but not isolated the extra cases we estimated and that no extra control measures are put in place, we estimate that the chance that local transmission would occur and sustain for at least three generations exceeds 50% for a total of 16 countries or territories, including four outside Asia: Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and United States ( Table 2 ). In a second scenario, where we assume that 95% of all the imported cases from Wuhan were immediately isolated, the estimated local outbreak risk reduces substantially, with only Thailand having a local outbreak risk estimate greater than 50%. Still, the estimated risk of local transmission sustaining for at least three generations is not negligible (> 20%) in many other countries or territories, including Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, United States, Malaysia, and Singapore ( Table 2 for the countries or territories having a local outbreak risk estimate greater than 50% in the main analysis, and Figure 2 & Table S2 for results obtained for all countries or territories outside of mainland China). For countries where we estimate a large number of unreported cases, the local outbreak risk is ranked higher in the first scenario than the second scenario, as the extra estimated cases not being detected means a higher risk of onward transmission compared to countries where we estimate higher detection (Table 2 ). For each recipient country or territory outside mainland China, we assess the relative potential of COVID-19 introduction from each donor country that has a local outbreak risk estimate exceeding 50%. For example, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia are found to have the highest COVID-19 introduction index estimates when we consider the United Kingdom as the recipient country. Using the United Kingdom, United States, South Korea, and South Africa as recipient country examples, we highlight the top donor countries or territories based on the COVID-19 introduction index estimate for each of these countries (Figure 3 ). The COVID-19 introduction index estimates for all pairs of donor-recipient countries create a network of ranked possible importation links between countries outside mainland China (Table S3A ). The total COVID-19 introduction index estimate from all the potential donor countries is highest for Taiwan followed by Japan (full list of estimates shown in Table S3B ). .
