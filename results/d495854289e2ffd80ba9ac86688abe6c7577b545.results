Quantitation of Myl-CoV and M. lucifugus RNA through reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and dual-RNA-sequencing indicated that co-infected bats had significantly higher levels of Myl-CoV RNA than bats infected with virus alone. The amount of Myl-CoV RNA correlated with the severity of WNS pathology in co-infected bats. This phenomenon was associated with specific molecular responses to co-infection, even in the intestines of bats where only one of the two pathogens was directly interacting with the host tissue. The levels of antibodies against Myl-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein were also higher in co-infected bats. Each key result is discussed in detail below. Bats co-infected with the fungus P. destructans and the virus Myl-CoV contained higher levels of Myl-CoV RNA. Myl-CoV genomic RNA was detected in bats infected only with Myl-CoV (virus-infected; 7/18), co-infected bats (European P. destructans (3/13) , or with North American P. destructans (7/16) 37 ). There was no difference in the frequency of Myl-CoV detected among these treatments (p-value = 0.801). We pooled bats infected with the two P. destructans isolates for all further analyses and tested whether co-infection with P. destructans and Myl-CoV correlated with an increase in viral replication. Our RT-qPCR data showed that the co-infected bats contained 60-fold more Myl-CoV RNA on average than the virus-infected bats (Mann Whitney test; p-value = 0.014; Fig. 1 ). Relative quantities of Myl-CoV RNA detected in the ileum of the virus-infected bats were low and showed low variation (Standard Deviation of 1/ΔCT = 0.005), compared to the relative quantities of Myl-CoV RNA in the co-infected bats (Standard Deviation of 1/ΔCT = 0.108; Fig. 1 ). The severity of WNS fungal pathology varied in co-infected bats, and we therefore tested whether relative quantities of viral RNA in the ileum correlated with the severity of WNS symptoms. Levels of WNS severity were scored based on fungal hyphae on the wings, secondary bacteria in wing lesions, oedema, necrosis and inflammation in wing lesions, and levels of neutrophils in lung, spleen and liver interstitium. Severity scores for wing tissue, secondary bacteria in lesions, and neutrophils in the lung interstitium positively correlated with relative amounts of coronavirus RNA in hibernating bats (Table 1) .
