The patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Fourteen patients (11 men) with an exacerbation of IIP were recruited. Seven patients fulfilled the criteria of IPF. The other patients were suspected of having a nonspecific interstitial pneumonia on the basis of high-resolution chest computed tomography findings. Before exacerbation, only 1 patient was treated with immunosuppressive therapy. The other patients were not treated with IIP-specific drugs such as immunosuppressive drugs, pirfenidone, and inhaled N-acetylcysteine. In most patients, the white blood cell count, C-reactive protein level, and KL-6 level were increased (mean7standard deviation [SD]; 8862.172476.3/μL, 6.2974.36 mg/dL, and 162571315 U/mL, respectively). The BALF findings are shown in Table 2 . BAL was performed in all patients with 150 mL of sterile saline. In most patients, the total cell count was increased (mean7SD; 5.2471.86 Â 10 5 /mL). The percentage of lymphocytes was increased in 9 patients. The percentage of neutrophils was increased in 12 patients. The percentage of eosinophils was increased in 10 patients. Viral separation was performed in 8 patients, and no viruses were separated in any of the 8 patients. All positive viral controls and human rhinovirus cDNAs obtained from humans were positive for respiratory viruses. The BALF was positive for RSV-B in 1 case (patient 7). Although the BALF was positive for CMV in 2 cases (patients 12 and 14) (Table 3) , the CMV antigenemia was negative in both of these cases.
