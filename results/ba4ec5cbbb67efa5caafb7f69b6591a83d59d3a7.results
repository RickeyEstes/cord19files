Resistance of Mice to Lethal Infection with MHV-3. 28 BALB/c mice were infected in groups of seven with 1, 10, 100, or 1,000 PFU of MHV-3 by intraperitoneal injection and were observed for 10 d (Table I) . Using the method of Reed and Muench (35) , an LDs0 for BALB/c of < 1-5 PFU was established. In similar experiments, the LDs0 for C3H/St was ~ 106 PFU, and A/J mice were resistant to >107 PFU. MHV-3 Replication In Vitro. The one-step growth curve of MHV-3 in 17 CL 1 cells was determined after innoculation of cultures at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell, and the virus titers in replicate cultures were determined at various subsequent time intervals (Fig. 1 ). MHV-3 had an eclipse phase of 4-to 5 h, reaching a maximum virus titer at 10 h postinfection. One-step growth curves were then determined in monocytes harvested from the peripheral blood of A/J, BALB/c and C3H/St mice. For these experiments mice were killed, and PBM were isolated asceptically over Ficoll-Hypaque. Monocytes were separated from lymphocytes by adherence to plastic for 48 h and were >92% esterase positive (38) . Monocytes at 3 × 105 were seeded in 24-well cluster plates (Costar Data Fzc. 1. One-step growth curve of MHV-3 in 2 X 10 7 | 7 CLI cells. Cells were infected in suspension with MHV-3 at an MOI of 0.1 (29) . After virus adsorption for 30 rain at 37°C, the cells were collected by low-speed centrifugation and resuspended in media containing 2% FCS, and replicate cultures were seeded at 1 × 10 e cells per 12 X 35-ram culture dish. At appropriate intervals, cultures were frozen, and the cells were harvested by freeze-thawing, scraped with a rubber policeman, and disrupted by sonication. The homogenates were then clarified by centrifugation, and virus titer was determined by plaque assay at serial 10-fold dilutions. Each data point represents the mean of duplicate cultures, and each line represents individual experiments. Packaging, Cambridge, Mass.) in 1 ml DMEM fortified with 2% fetal calf serum and were infected at an MOI of 0.1 with MHV-3. Virus was adsorbed to the cells for 60 min at 37°C. Unadsorbed virus was removed by washing with DMEM, the media were replaced, and the cells were further incubated at 37°C. Cultures were frozen at appropriate intervals, treated as described above, and assayed for virus by plaque assay at serial 10-fold dilutions (Fig. 2) . In contrast to the growth of MHV-3 in a totally permissive cell line (17 CLI) , in BALB/c monocytes, a prolonged period of 16 h was observed postinfection, during which time no virus replication was evident. However, subsequent to the 16-h lag period, replication was progressive, with peak yields 24 h after infection. In contrast, no virus replication was detected in A/J or C3H/St monocytes within 48 h postinfection. These observations parallel the observations of acute fulminant hepatitis in BALB/c mice and resistance of A/J mice to overt hepatitis or death. Basal Cellular PCA. The total cellular content of PCA immediately after isolation of cells and before any form of in vitro culture was determined for A/J, BALB/c, and C3H/St mice and was remarkably consistent at 56-81 mU/106 PBM. This activity rises spontaneously to a maximum stable concentration of 515 mU/106 PBM within 6 h of culture in serum-free medium in the absence of added stimulus (Table II) . When the control cultured cells were fractionated by adherence into lymphocytes and MHV-3 Induction of PCA. PBM were isolated from each of the mice strains, and 1 X 108 PBM were incubated with 106 PFU of MHV-3 for 18 h at 37°C in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FCS at 37°C. The cells were washed three times with RPMI 1640, disrupted, and assayed for total PCA. As a positive control, 1 × 106 PBM from each strain was stimulated with Escherichia coli 011 l:B4 LPS at 10 #g/ml, as previously described (16) . Cells from all three strains responded to LPS with a six-to eightfold increase in PCA (Table III) , in accord with previous observations (16) . The PCA response of BALB/c PBM to 106 PFU MHV-3 was greater than previously observed for any stimulus, reaching levels of >70,000 mU/106 PBM (Table III) . In contrast to the profound PCA response of BALB/c PBM, no response to MHV-3 was observed in PBM from A/J mice, even though a normal PGA response was observed to LPS stimulation. A moderate PCA response was observed for PBM from C3H/St mice stimulated with MHV-3, but the response was only 70% of the response observed for LPS stimulation (Table III) . Thus, the PCA response of PBM to MHV-3 stimulation exhibited profound strain differences. The production of the PGA by PBM correlates with the susceptibility of the strain to hepatic disease. Furthermore, the PCA response of BALB/c mice was of a magnitude 15-20 times greater than that observed for the response to LPS or antigen-antibody complexes (14) (15) (16) . No increase in PCA above basal levels was observed when 1 X 106 PBM from BALB/c, A/J, or C3H/St mice were cultured with an aliquot from mockinfected DBT, L2, or 17 GL 1 cells (data not shown). Dose-response titrations were examined for MHV-3-induced PCA in which 1 x 106 PBM from BALB/c mice were incubated for 6 h with MHV-3. When 1 PFU of MHV-3 was used, a fourfold increase in PCA as compared with unstimulated control cultures was observed (Fig. 3) . A dose-dependent increase of PCA achieved a 168-fold maximum increase of PCA with 106 PFU of MHV-3 (Fig. 3) . Comparable experiments were conducted with PBM from C3H/St and A/J mice. When 1 X 106 PBM from C3H/St mice were incubated for 6 h with increasing amounts of MHV-3, no PGA response was observed until concentrations of 100 PFU of MHV-3 were added; and the maximum PCA response was observed at 105 PFU of MHV-3, with a 7.2-fold maximum increase in PCA observed over control cultures. In contrast, no PCA response was observed for PBM from A/J mice over a dose titration of 1-106 PFU of MHV-3. To determine the kinetics of MHV-3-induced amplification of PCA, 1 X 106 PBM from BALB/c, G3H/St, and A/J mice were each incubated with 106 PFU of MHV-3 for various time intervals and assayed for total cellular PCA. A 10-fold PCA response was observed for BALB/c PBM that were cultured for 1 h with MHV-3 (Fig. 4) . There was a progressive increase of PGA with time of exposure, which reached a maximum of 84,500 mU at 12 h. This level of PGA was maintained for 48 h, which was the maximum interval of observation. In contrast, the PCA response of C3H/St mice did not rise until 2 h after exposure to MHV-3 and was maximum at 8 h (Fig. 4) at 2,800 mU, which was a 6.8-fold increase over control. Finally, there was no increase in PCA from A/J mice above a background level of 385 mU at any time interval of cultivation (Fig. 4) . from either C3H/St or BALB/c mice were directly stimulated with MHV-3, no increase of cellular PCA was observed (Table IV) . However, when PBM were first stimulated by MHV-3 for 18 h and then subsequently fractionated into lymphocytes and monocytes by adherence to plastic for 48 h, the increase in PCA observed for the whole PBM was localized to the monocyte population. This is similar to the increase demonstrated for LPS stimulation (14) . The PCA response of PBM from BALB/c mice was 168-fold, increasing from 505 to 81,400 mU. 98% of the increase in PCA could be accounted for in the monocyte fraction, which demonstrated an increase in total cellular PCA from 3,200 (control) to 722,000 mU/10 ~ monocytes (Table V) . were prepared from C3H/St, A/J, and BALB/c mice. They were stimulated either directly by MHV-3 alone attached in the 16-mm plastic wells or in the presence of variable numbers of lymphocytes, i.e., with lymphocyte:monocyte ratios from 0:1 to 8:1. Monocytes were then isolated from lymphocytes by vigorous washing and assayed for total cellular PCA. Monocytes (1 × 10 5) exposed to 10 6 PFU of MHV-3 in the absence of lymphoeytes exhibited no PCA response, nor was the response at lymphocyte:monocyte ratios of less than 2:1 particularly notable (Fig. 5) . However, at lymphocyte'monocyte ratios of 2.5:1 or greater, a significant PCA response was observed and it reached maximum levels as the ratio approached 4:1. No further increase in PCA was noted as the ratio was increased to 8:1. These data indicate that monocytes are the cellular source of the MHV-3-induced PCA, but the presence of lymphocytes is necessary for induction of the PCA response in monocytes.
