The control group consisted of 31 hospitals that had no nosocomial infections with SARS-CoV among HCWs; there were 149 SARS patients admitted to these hospitals during the study period. The case group consisted of 19 hospitals that had one or more nosocomial infections with SARS-CoV among HCWs; during the study period, 191 SARS patients were admitted to these hospitals, and HCWs had 115 nosocomial cases of SARS infections. Table I summarises the results of univariate analysis of control measures for SARS prevention. The following factors were significantly associated (all P < 0.05) with effective prevention of nosocomial SARS infection: measures relating to triage used in hospital (e.g. body temperature screening; set up of an isolation room in the ED); most of the measures to identify the zones of risk (e.g. installation of physical barriers between zones of risk of isolation ward); installation of hand-washing station (e.g. set up alcohol dispensers at checkpoints for glove-on hand rubbing between zones of risk); use of NPIRs and wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g. set up standardised NPIR, wearing of an N95 or surgical mask); and support from administration (e.g. established crisis response team, support from superintendent/directors for infection control). We then performed a multivariate analysis of control measures that were significantly associated in the univariate analysis with preventing nosocomial SARS infections among HCWs. Table II shows the two control measures that were significantly associated with protection against nosocomial infection: set up of fever stations outside of the ED; and alcohol dispensers for glove-on hand rubbing at checkpoints between zones of risk.
