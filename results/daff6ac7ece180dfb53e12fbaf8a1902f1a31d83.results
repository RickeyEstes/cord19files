The outbreak database contained a total of 590 neonatal outbreaks, 75 of which were sustained by viruses. Eleven of these 75 reported viral outbreaks were excluded from our analysis: 3 that were reported twice and 8 that were relevant to pediatric, not neonatal, patients. When we reported these studies to the authors of the database, they amended their list, and thus a total of 64 neonatal viral outbreaks were included in our analysis. Interestingly, 44 of these 64 outbreaks (68.75%) were reported from NICUs. The number of published reports of outbreaks has increased over time over the last several decades, from 3 before to 14 in the 1980s and 13 in the 1990 to 34 from 2000 to the present. Considering the number of reported outbreaks for any viral agent and the incidence of each agent on the total of neonatal outbreaks and on the total of neonatal viral outbreaks, the 5 most frequently reported viral agents were rotavirus (23.44%), respiratory syncytial virus (17.19%), enterovirus (15.63%), hepatitis A (10.94%), and adenovirus (9.38%). The predominant types of health careeassociated infections identified are listed in Table 1 . In most outbreaks, the virus caused more than 1 infection type. The most frequent type of infection was gastrointestinal system infection (inclusive of hepatitis; 54.69%), followed by lower respiratory tract infection other than pneumonia (34.38%). Lower respiratory tract infection other than pneumonia and pneumonia together accounted for 50.01% of the infections. The index case was identified in 32 of the 64 outbreaks analyzed (50%), but the source could not be identified in 26 outbreaks (40.63%) ( Table 2) . Table 3 presents the numbers of patients and staff involved in the outbreaks, along with mortality stratified by the causative virus. In several reports, the fatality rate was not specified. Mortality was calculated based on number of deaths out of the total number of patients involved only when data were available. We identified 48 deaths out of 669 patients involved in 48 outbreaks. Mortality varied depending on the type of virus; overall average mortality was 7.17%, meaning that an average of 1 neonate died during each outbreak. Table 4 lists measures taken to contain the outbreaks. In most of the epidemics, multiple measures were implemented. Patient screening or surveillance, isolation or cohorting of patients, enforcement of hand hygiene measures, use of protective clothing, and personnel screening or surveillance were the most frequently introduced measures. In 26.56% of cases, the countermeasures were ineffective in stopping the outbreak, and the involved wards had to be closed. Correlating the epidemic episodes with the involved departments, 9 of 44 outbreaks (20.45%) that occurred in NICUs and 8 of 20 outbreaks (40%) in nonintensive care units led to ward closure. "Change in antibiotic therapy" in case of viral infections assume a different significance and importance, meaning the suspension of antibiotic therapy after the confirmation of the viral source of infection or, in most cases, the switch to antiviral agents or palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus outbreaks. Yet in the field of vaccination, immunoglobulin administration (passive immunization) is included as a preventive measure.
