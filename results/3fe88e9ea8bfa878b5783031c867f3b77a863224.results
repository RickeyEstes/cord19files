In November of 1990 the previously described questionnaire was personally administered to the 30 producers to determine their management practices, which we believe define the herd level risk factors for the study (Tables l-4). One farm was lost during the study. We believe that quality of data was excellent on all farms. Bull calves were I sold before 2 weeks of age on all farms. The primary calf caretaker was the farmer or a member of the farmer's family on 29 of the farms. Vaccinating pregnant cows against Escherichia coli and rotavirus/coronavirus was used by only 17% of the farms in the study. Maternity pens were used on 16 farms (53% of all farms), although only four of those farms located the maternity pens separate from the milking herd. Straw was the most common bedding used in the maternity area (73%), and the area was cleaned after every calf on only 27% of the farms. Colostrum was hand-fed on all farms, while 16 of the farms would allow calves to suckle colostrum from the cow. These findings are similar to previous published research (Wahner-Toews et al., 1986a) . The ,adequacy of calf housing was also visually assessed using the previously described standards (Table 5) . A farm was considered 'adequate' if it passed all listed criteria. For preweaning housing, seven farms had adequate housing in the winter, eight Hutches further than 15.2 m from exhaust outlets from other buildings Air flow in group housing from younger animals toward older animals 5.7 m3 of air space per calf in buildings of any type Barrier walls to separate age groups of animals housed in buildings of any type Enough fan capacity in mechanically ventilated buildings to perform the required four changes per hour in winter as well as the 40 per hour needed in the summer Intake velocity of mechanically ventilated buildings to be between 61 and 244 m mitt-' Temperature range from 0 to 10°C in warm housing in the winter Humidity levels between 50 and 80% in buildings of any type As a measure manure-handling effectiveness, ammonia concentrations shall be less than 10 ppm Naturally ventilated buildings to be located more than 15.2 m from other building exhaust ports or other naturally ventilated buildings Inside air temperature 10°C warmer in unheated buildings than outside temperature in the winter a Bates and Anderson, 1984; L.D. Jacobsen, personal communication, 1990. farms were adequate in the summer. Hutches were used in this study by 30% of the farms in the winter and 43% of the farms in the summer; previous studies reported that 32% (Curtis et al., 1988a) and 17% (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986a) of farms used hutches for preweaned calves. Individual stalls were used by 60% of the producers in this study in the winter and 43% in the summer, compared with 12% (Curtis et al., 1988,) and 50% (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986a) of producers in other studies. Postweaning housing was adequate on six farms in the winter and the summer (Table 6) . Eight hundred and forty-five heifer calves were born into the cohort. Calf-days at risk contributed to the study averaged 2850 days per farm (range 951-5284, SD 1208). Producers treated 203 calves (24.0% of all calves) for illness during the study, yielding an overall morbidity rate of 0.2 calves treated per 100 calf-days at risk (o-0.8, SD 0.2) (Fig. 1) . Calves were treated most often for enteritis (128 cases) and pneumonia (64) ( Table 7) ; other reasons for treatment included depression/off feed (5), nave1 ill (4), musculoskeletal disease (l), and ringworm (1). Treatment rates on all farms for enteritis averaged 0.15 cases per 100 calf-days at risk (o-0.7, SD 0.2) (Fig. 2) , while rates for pneumonia for all farms averaged 0.1 cases per 100 calf-days at risk (o-0.7, SD 0.2) (Fig. 3) . R' k f t 't' 1s o en en 1s was highest at birth (0.9 cases per 100 calf-days at risk) and declined rapidly to 3 weeks of age (0.1 cases per 100 calf-days at risk) (Fig. 4) . Risk of pneumonia was highest at birth (0.18 cases per 100 calf-days at risk) and again at 10 weeks of age (0.12 cases per 100 calf-days at risk) (Fig. 5 ). Case fatality rates on all farms averaged 11.8% for all diagnoses, 17.9% for enteritis, and 9.4% for pneumonia (Table 7) . No significant effects of season were seen for morbidity or mortality, using the chi-square test ( x2 = 8.06, df = 29, P = 0.006). Treal:ment of disease in the calves was consistent between farms. All calves with pneumo'nia were treated with injectable antibiotics. Calves with enteritis were treated with in_iectable antibiotics only (60 calves), oral electrolyte fluids (50 calves), and a combination of oral fluids and injectable antibiotics (12 calves). 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 calves treated/l 00 calf-days at risk Average daily rates of gain differed between farms in the study. Average rates of gain for calves from birth to 16 weeks of age were calculated at the farm level. Rates of gain averaged 0.8 kg day-' for all farms (OS-1 .l, SD 0.2) (Fig. 6) . For 22 farms with inadequate housing, daily rates of gain averaged 0.8 kg day-' (0.5-1.0, SD O.l), while farms with adequate calf housing (eight farms) averaged 1 .O kg day-' (0.9-l .l, SD 0.1). Although the difference in rates of gain between farms that had adequate calf housing when compared with those with inadequate housing was significant ( x2 = 7.57, df = 29, P = 0.004), the association is confounded by rolling herd milk production average between the two groups, after stratification based on median rolling herd milk In addition, there were no significant differences between average daily rate of gain between calves that were treated by producers (mean 0.8 kg day -' , SD 0.1) and calves that were not treated (0.8, SD 0.1) during the study, based on an unweighted least squares linear regression (P = 0.87). No significant results were found using serum immunoglobulin level in an unweighted least squares regression for morbidity or mortality (P = 0.63). Four hundred and eighteen heifer calves were sampled from the month of birth to 16 weeks of age for evidence of seroconversion to the respiratory viruses. Of these calves, only 19 showed a four-fold increase in serum titer: 16 calves to BVDV, two to IBR, and one calf to P13. The 19 calves were from 12 different herds. The mean age at time of seroconversion was 60 days (this does not include the six heifers that were involved in an outbreak of pneumonia on one farm and seroconverted to BRSV). Effectiveness of colostral transfer was assessed in 98 calves by using the sodium sulfite turbidity test. The 98 calves were a convenience sample from all 30 herds, with some herds represented more than others. Of these 98 heifers, 35 had failure of passive transfer (serum IgG level of less than 800 mg dl-'1. Comparing the 35 calves with failure of passive transfer (FIT) with the 63 calves that had adequate passive transfer, there were no signilicant differences between the two groups with respect to the number of calves that bec,ame ill (seven in the FPT group versus 13 in the normal group) or calves that died (five in each group), based on a chi-square test ( x2 = 0.13, df = 97, P = 0.71). Average daily rate of gain was not significantly different between the two groups (x2 = 34, df = 97, P = 0.63). Serum immunoglobulin level was not significantly correlated with daily rate of gain (r = 0.04, df = 97, P = 0.69), and a simple linear regression model showed no significant relationship between immunoglobulin status and rate of gain (r* = 0.008, P = 0.73). Sixty,-four heifers (7.6% of all calves) died during the study, yielding an overall mortality rate of 0.08 deaths per 100 calf-days at risk (O-O.3 f 0.08) (Fig. 6) . The median age of death was 15.2 days (l-1 12 + 24.7 days). The mortality rate was highest at 2 weeks of age (0.2 deaths per 100 calf-days at risk) and then declined to 16 weeks of Eight calves were diagnosed with 'other' diseases by producers: three atresia colis, two abomasal ruptures, one small intestinal volvulus, and one septicemia were found on postmortem of these calves. age (Fig. 4) . The most common cause of death was enteritis (28 deaths, 43.8% of all deaths), followed by pneumonia (19 deaths, 29.7% of all deaths). Of the 64 calves that died during the study, postmortems were performed on 52 calves. Comparing producer diagnosis with postmortem result, producer diagnosis of mortality due to enteritis had a sensitivity of 58.3% (95% CI 61.3%, 55.3%), and a specificity of 93% (95% CI 93.5%, 92.5%). Producer diagnosis of mortality due to pneumonia had a sensitivity of 56% (95% CI 59%, 53%) and a specificity of 100% (Table 8) . Specific pathogens were identified at postmortem in some of the cases. The most common pathogens isolated from heifers that died of enteritis were rotavirus (five), E. coli (four), and BVDV (one). Pathogens isolated from pneumonic lungs included Pasteurella multocidu (three), H. somnus (three), and Pasteurella haemolytica (1). No respiratory viruses were isolated from pneumonic calves.
