Of 44 SS patients, 23 were randomized to the pilocarpine group and 21 to the placebo group. T There was no significant difference in demographic v variables or disease characteristics between the two groups ( Table 1 ). The most frequently used (>10%) medications were hydroxychloroquine sulfate (200-400 mg/day), antacids, low dose prednisolone (2.5-10 mg/day) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Use of these medications was similar between the pilocarpine and placebo groups. There was a similar dropout rate from the initial 44 patients, with 18 of 21 (85.7%) in the placebo group and 16 of 23 (69.6%) in the pilocarpine group completing the 3-month study (p = 0.29; Table 2 ). In the placebo group, one patient (4.8%) was lost to follow-up during the period of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan and two patients (9.6%) withdrew because of lack of efficacy. In contrast, none of the 23 patients in the pilocarpine group discontinued the study treatment due to lack of efficacy. In the pilocarpine group, three patients (13%) withdrew because of marked sweating and four (17.4%) were lost to follow-up. Of the four patients who were lost to follow-up, two withdrew during the SARS outbreak period. y The reasons for discontinuation from the study were not significantly different between the pilocarpine and placebo groups ( Table 2) . t Global assessment of xerostomia showed that a significant proportion of patients in the pilocarpine group (69.6%) had improvement in the sensation of dry mouth compared to the placebo group (23.8%) in the intention-to-treat analysis (p = 0.0032; Figure 1 ). Patients taking pilocarpine four times daily also showed significant improvement in xerostomia-related conditions, such t as ability to sleep and ability to speak without (Figure 2 ). Borderline significance (p = 0.07) in the ability to chew and swallow was observed in the pilocarpine group compared to the placebo group. Three patients in the placebo group and four in the pilocarpine group were denture wearers, but none of the patients in either group had significant improvement in the ability to wear dentures. However, analysis of VAS scores between the pilocarpine and placebo groups indicated a significant improvement (p < 0.01) in the pilocarpine group in five of six specific dry mouth symptoms, including mouth dryness, mouth comfort, ability to sleep, ability to speak and ability to swallow food (all p < 0.01) compared to baseline. In addition to improved VAS scores, patients r in the pilocarpine group also reported greater mouth comfort, less dryness and found it easier to speak compared to the placebo group (Figure 3) . Although four patients in the pilocarpine group (17.4%) vs. placebo group (0%) experienced reduced use of oral comfort agents, the difference did not reach significance (p = 0.11). f Saliva secretion was evaluated in the unit of g/minute and any increase in saliva flow more than baseline secretion was defined as a response. The pilocarpine group demonstrated significant differences in symptomatic relief of oral symptoms in mouth dryness, mouth comfort, ability to sleep and ability to speak without drinking liquids. For the ability to chew and swallow food, a borderline significance was observed in the pilocarpine group compared with the placebo group. An increase of 25 mm or more above the baseline score of these 100 mm visual analog scale questions was defined as response.
