We estimated that the annual incidence per 1000 children (95% CI) of all cause associated respiratory hospitalization was 11.5 (10) (11) (12) . The incidences per 1000 children (95% CI) per year for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus Introduction Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) are one of the leading causes of childhood morbidity and mortality globally [1] . They are also the leading causes of childhood death in Bangladesh [2] [3] [4] . Respiratory viruses are increasingly recognized as major contributors to acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children and associated with almost 60% of ALRIs [5] . The primary viral etiological agents for childhood ALRI are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Data from Bangladesh suggest that incidence of respiratory virus associated pneumonia in children aged <2 years was 40/100 child years with the incidence being highest for RSV [13, 14] . The rate per1000 child-years for RSV associated hospitalization ranges between 4 and 10 and for influenza between 1 and 2 in other low and middle income countries [15] [16] [17] . Although there is growing body of literature from low income settings, still information remains inadequate about the contribution of respiratory viruses to severe childhood respiratory illness. Data about the incidence of hospitalization may help health officials explore the potential value of targeting influenza vaccines to specific subpopulations presumed to be at higher risk of severe influenza illness in countries like Bangladesh where there is still no uniform policy guideline for influenza vaccination. In addition these data may help prioritize the development of vaccines for other respiratory viruses including RSV and parainfluenza viruses. Data on incidence of respiratory virus associated pediatric hospitalization are also necessary to estimate the total direct and indirect cost of hospitalization and the burden on the health care delivery system associated with childhood respiratory illness. We combined health utilization survey and hospital based surveillance data to estimate the incidence of respiratory virus infection among children aged <5years hospitalized with respiratory illness in Bangladesh.
