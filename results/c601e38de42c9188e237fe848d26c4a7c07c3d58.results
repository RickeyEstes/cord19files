A transgenic replicon to monitor antiviral RNAi in vivo The FHVΔB2eGFP replicon was placed under the control of a minimal heat-shock promoter and yeast UAS Gal4 sequences (Figure 1A and File S1), and the resulting construct was injected in embryos. Only two independent transgenic lines were obtained, probably reflecting the detrimental effects of the ectopic leaky expression of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). Indeed, crossing the replicon lines with strong ubiquitous driver lines (e.g., actin-Gal4) did not yield viable progeny. The use of tissue specific drivers allowed to test the control of the replicon in different target tissues. Expression of the replicon in eyes using the GMR-Gal4 driver did not produce detectable GFP fluorescence, even though the driver efficiently drove expression of a UAS-mCherry∷NLS reporter in this tissue (Figure 1B) . When the flies also expressed a small hairpin (sh) RNA targeting Ago2 (GMR-Gal4; UAS-FHVΔB2eGFP/UAS-shAgo2), a strong and homogeneous green fluorescence was observed in the eyes ( Figure  1B ). Co-expression of the replicon and the VSR CrPV-1A or FHV-B2, or with different drivers active in other somatic tissues also resulted in derepression of GFP expression (not shown). In RNAi mutant flies (e. g., dcr2), we observed GFP signal in the whole body in the absence of driver, reflecting baseline leaky expression amplified by the RdRP (Figure 1C ) (Deddouche et al. 2008) . These results indicate that the UAS-FHVΔB2eGFP replicon can be used to monitor the activity of antiviral RNA interference in vivo. The FHVΔB2eGFP replicon is not exclusively controlled by the siRNA pathway in follicular somatic cells of the ovary Driving the expression of the replicon with germline specific drivers (e.g., mat.aTub67c-Gal4) led to sterile progeny with rudimentary ovaries (not shown). When testing the replicon with a follicular somatic cell (FSC) specific driver, in a siRNA impaired background (tj-Gal4; UAS-FHVΔB2eGFP/UAS-shAgo2), we observed only a partial derepression of GFP expression. Fluorescence was consistently observed in restricted patches ( Figure 2B ) even though the driver efficiently and homogeneously drove expression of a UAS-mCherry∷NLS reporter in this tissue (Figure 2A and S1A). Moreover, while mCherry expression could be seen in early stages of oogenesis (stage 5-6), replicon-derived GFP expression was only observed after stage 8 of oogenesis, with GFP patches becoming more apparent after stage 10. Generally, GFP was detected in the main body cells, which comprise the majority of the follicular somatic cells, in a non-stereotypical pattern. We also could also detect GFP in the stretched cells that overlie the nurse cells (e.g., figure 3A) , and in the posterior ( Figure 2B ) or centripetally migrating cells (e.g., figure 3B' ). Co-expression of the replicon and VSRs or expression of the replicon in dcr2 or Ago2 mutant flies gave similar results ( Figure 2C and Figure S1A -B). Variegated GFP expression, due to a heterogeneous activation of the transgene, was observed for several driver/reporter pairs in FSCs (Skora and Spradling 2010; Lee et al. 2017) . When co-expressing the replicon and the VSR CrPV-1A in mutant backgrounds that dominantly suppress variegation, similar patches were observed ( Figure S1C ). To further rule out a variegation effect, we monitored FHV-RNA1 expression using Fluorescent in-situ Hybridization (FISH) and FHV-RdRP expression by immunostaining. In both cases we detected expression in all cells, ruling out a transcriptional or translational effect ( Figure 3A -B, B'). Of note, a few scattered cells expressed higher levels of RNA, overlapping with GFP positive cells. One hallmark of viral replication is the accumulation of double-stranded (ds) RNAs. Interestingly, dsRNA could only be detected in single isolated cells, falling within patches of GFP positive cells ( Figure 3C ). This suggests that even though the siRNA pathway is inactivated, only a limited number of FSCs support active viral replication. We hypothesize that free GFP expressed in these cells spreads to neighboring cells through ring canals (McLean and Cooley 2013). In summary, our results reveal that when the siRNA pathway is impaired the replicon remains controlled in the majority of FSCs.
