2 0 O-Methylation at the N 1 Position of RNA Critically Determines the Abolition of RIG-I Activation Capping of mRNA is required for effective ribosomal translation. Three forms of cap structures are known: cap0 is a N 7 -methyl guanosine ( m7 G) linked to the gamma phosphate of the 5 0 -triphosphate of RNA ( m7 GpppNN; N = nucleotide; Figure 1A ); cap1 is identical to cap0 except for an additional 2 0 O-methyl group at the N 1 position ( m7 GpppN m N); and cap2 carries a second 2 0 O-methyl group at the N 2 position ( m7 GpppN m N m ). Although the cap N 7 -methyl guanosine in cap structures is well known to be required for effective ribosomal translation, the impact of the 2 0 O-methyl groups at N 1 and N 2 on translation is unclear. So far, it has been described that replication of (+) ssRNA viruses lacking the viral N 1 -2 0 O-methyl transferase is restricted by the type I IFN-induced, pppRNA binding protein IFIT1 (Abbas et al., 2013; Daffis et al., 2010; Habjan et al., 2013; Pichlmair et al., 2011) . To study the impact of the different components of cap structures on immunorecognition of RNA by RIG-I, we established methods to generate well-characterized 24-mer RNA oligonucleotides with identical sequence and containing a 5 0 -triphosphate with additional single or combined features of the cap0/1/2 structures (e.g., with or without guanosine cap, N 7 -methylated guanosine cap, 2 0 O-methyl at N 1 or N 2 ; see Figures S2A-S2E and Table S1 ). These RNA oligonucleotides were hybridized with complementary RNA (antisense RNA oligonucleotide: AsGA; Table S1 ) resulting in short double-stranded blunt-end RNA oligonucleotides (ppp-dsRNA). The doublestranded RNA oligonucleotides were transfected into human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence of chloroquine, which eliminates endosomal TLR-mediated recognition. In this setting, IFN-a induction by short ppp-dsRNA is exclusively mediated by RIG-I (Schlee et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010) . We found that 5 0 ppp5 0 -linked G (GpppGA) did not impair RIG-I activation ( Figure 1B ), whereas N 7 -methylation of the 5 0 ppp5 0 -linked G (cap0 = m7 GpppGA; Figure 1B ) only partially reduced IFN-a induction at the concentrations used (2.5 nM). In dose response experiments, complete inhibition of RIG-I activation by m7 G cap was seen at concentrations below 0.5 nM (Figure 1C) . By contrast, a single 2 0 O-methyl group at N 1 (pppG m A) completely abolished RIG-I activation at all RNA concentrations tested (up to 15.8 nM; Figures 1B and 1C ). The combination of the 2 0 O-methyl group at N 1 and m7 G as in cap1 ( m7 GpppG m A; Figure 1B ) also showed no activity. However, 2 0 O-methylation at N 2 with and without m7 G ( m7 GpppGA m , pppGA m ) only partially reduced the RIG-I activity ( Figure 1B) . These data reveal a dominant role of the 2 0 O-methyl group at N 1 for the inability of RIG-I to sense capped pppRNA. Stimulation of bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DCs) deficient for Ifih1 (encoding MDA5) or Ddx58 (encoding RIG-I) with ligands comprising different cap structures confirmed the exclusive detection of capped pppRNA by RIG-I and the absolute inhibitory effect of 2 0 O-methylation ( Figure 1D ). The Amino Acid H830 in the RNA Binding Domain of RIG-I Is Responsible for Steric Exclusion of N 1 -2 0 O-Methylated cap1 RNA RIG-I is composed of two N-terminal signaling adaptor domains (CARD), a helicase domain (DECH), and the C-terminal domain (CTD), which was identified to harbor the pppRNA binding site (Cui et al., 2008; Takahasi et al., 2008) . The CTD possesses a basic binding cleft with ppp-dsRNA-CTD interactions at amino acids F853 (5 0 -terminal base pair stacking), K858, H847, K861, K888 (ppp binding), K907 (internucleotide phosphate binding), and H830 (contact to 2 0 OH of N 1 ) (Lu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010) . We mutated selected amino acids of the binding pocket of RIG-I to alanine and expressed the full-length RIG-I constructs in HEK293 blue cells, which lack RIG-I activity, if not primed by type I IFN. The IP10 gene is known to be directly activated by RIG-I (Brownell et al., 2014) . IP10 secretion was studied as a surrogate parameter of RIG-I activation after stimulation with synthetic ppp-dsRNA or ppp-ssRNA ( Figure 2A ). The highly conserved amino acids F853, K861, K888, and K907 ( Figure S1 ), which are part of the basic ppp-dsRNA binding cleft of the CTD domain, were essential for RIG-I activation by ppp-dsRNA (Figure 2A) . Although the highly conserved H830 is in contact with 2 0 OH of N 1 , the H830A mutation did not decrease but instead increased ppp-dsRNA-induced RIG-I stimulation ( Figure 2A ). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that this increase was not due to higher expression of the mutated RIG-I(H830A) ( Figure 2B ). Indeed, its 100% conservation across all known vertebrate species and sea anemone RIG-I ( Figure S1 ) points to a key function of H830 in RIG-I biology. Because H830 is not required for RIG-I activation and given its position in proximity to N 1 , we speculated that H830 might be involved in a steric interference of the 2 0 O-methyl group (trans-C3 0 -oriented) through its side chain ( Figure 2C ; Wang et al., 2010) . To address this hypothesis, we performed a set of experiments in which we compared wildtype (WT) RIG-I to RIG-I(H830A) by using different pppRNA ligands. Indeed, in contrast to RIG-I(WT), the RIG-I(H830A) mutant was still activated by ppp-dsRNA containing 2 0 O-methyl at N 1 (pppG m A) and showed considerable activation in the presence of a complete cap1 structure ( m7 GpppG m A) ( Figure 2D , black bars). By using a homogenous ligand interaction assay, we analyzed the binding affinity of RIG-I(WT) and RIG-I(H830A) to the different ppp-RNAs ( Figures 2E-2G ). Consistent with reduced RIG-I-stimulating activity, binding of pppG m A to RIG-I(WT) was 4.5-fold diminished in comparison to pppGA, and 5 0 ppp5 0 -linked m7 G ( m7 GpppGA) also inhibited binding but to a lower extent ($2-fold) ( Figures 2E and 2G ). The binding of cap1-bearing dsRNA ( m7 GpppG m A) to RIG-I(WT) was lower than the detection limit of the assay (Figures 2E and 2G; K d > 1,000 nM). Similar to RIG-I(WT), the cap0 structure ( m7 GpppGA) reduced binding of RIG-I(H830A) 2-fold, demonstrating that H830 does not interfere with the m7 G cap. In contrast to RIG-I(WT) and consistent with the functional activity, binding of RIG-I(H830A) to pppRNA with and without 2 0 O-methylation at N 1 was nearly equal (Figures 2F and 2G) . In line with this result, RNA with a complete cap1 structure ( m7 GpppG m A) bound to RIG-I(H830A) to an extent comparable to the non-2 0 O-methylated cap0bearing RNA ( m7 GpppGA) ( Figures 2F and 2G) . Of note, pppG m A did still demonstrate some residual binding to RIG-I(WT) in the Alphascreen assay although the assay cannot resolve the binding site. One possible explanation for this residual interaction with RIG-I(WT) could be non-productive binding as reported previously (Marq et al., 2011) . Here, RIG-I binding was reported for ligands that could not activate RIG-I or induce type I IFN. In particular, dsRNA with an overhanging 5 0 -ppp-nucleotide (ppp(+1nt)-dsRNA) was observed to be a weak competitor for blunt ppp-dsRNA (Marq et al., 2011) . To test whether N 1 -2 0 O-methylation has similar effects as a 5 0 -ppp-overhang, we performed a competition assay as described previously (Marq et al., 2011) . We transfected ppp-dsRNA as pppGA hybridized to asGA (pppGA+asGA) mixed with a 24-fold excess of asGA (single-stranded control, non-binder), pppGmA+asGA (blunt N 1 -2 0 O-methylated), or pppGA+asGA(À1) (ppp(+1nt)-dsRNA, non-productive binder) ( Figure S2F ; Marq et al., 2011) . Although ppp(+1nt)-dsRNA, as previously published, reduced RIG-I stimulation by ppp-dsRNA 2-fold, no competitive inhibition via N 1 -2 0 O-methylated ppp-dsRNA (pppGmA) could be detected. Thus, unlike ppp(+1nt)-dsRNA, pppGmA binding does not seem to be sufficient to block binding of pppGA in this setting. Altogether, the results provide strong evidence that H830 impairs accurate binding of N 1 -2 0 O-methylated RNA via steric hindrance, leading to immune ignorance of 2 0 O-methylated pppRNA. H830 and cap1 N 1 -2 0 O-Methylation of Self RNA Prevent Immunorecognition of Endogenous RNAs The high conservation of H830 in RIG-I and its function in interference with accurate binding of 5 0 -triphosphate RNA carrying a 2 0 O-methyl group at N 1 suggest the existence of self-RNA molecules that depend on N 1 methylation to evade recognition by RIG-I. Although base-paired 5 0 -triphosphate RNA is required for RIG-I stimulation, GpppNN-RNA intermediates with such RIG-I ligand properties might occur, causing some degree of immune stimulation in the absence of 2 0 O-methylation (or in the presence of the mutated form of RIG-I that accepts 2 0 Omethylation). Indeed, we found that long-term expression of RIG-I(H830A) in HEK293 blue cells lacking RIG-I activity led to a significant IP10 response in the absence of exogenous RIG-I ligand ( Figure 3A , black bars). To show that IP10 induction is induced by endogenous RNA species, we overexpressed RIG-I-CTD-FLAG in HEK293 blue cells and purified endogenous RNA bound to immunoprecipitated RIG-I-CTD-FLAG ( Figure 3B , left). RIG-I-bound endogenous RNA stimulated the RIG-I(H830A) mutant but not RIG-I(WT) ( Figure 3B , right). The RIG-I-stimulating activity of isolated endogenous RNA was partially sensitive to alkaline phosphatase (AP), which hydrolyzes free phosphates, and to treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP), which hydrolyzes the triphosphate bridge of mRNA caps (Figure S3A) . However, only the combined treatment abolished RIG-I stimulation, indicating the presence of stimulatory capped and uncapped pppRNA species ( Figure 3B ). It was reported that mRNA cap1 2 0 O-methylation occurs in the nucleus and is performed by the endogenous cap1 methyltransferase MTr1 (Bélanger et al., 2010; Perry and Kelley, 1976) . To study the impact of diminished 2 0 O-methylation of endogenous RNA transcripts, we knocked down hMTr1 in primary human fibroblasts ( Figures  3C and S3B) . Intriguingly, inhibition of endogenous cap methylation induced a substantial type I IFN response 72 hr after hMTr1 knock down ( Figure 3C ). Correspondingly, siRNA-mediated knock-down of MTr1 induced IFN-b mRNA in primed A549 cells ( Figure 3D ). By contrast, RIG-I-deficient A549 cells did not upregulate IFN-b upon depletion of MTr1 (Figures 3D and S3C) . A similar scenario held true in HEK293 blue cells silenced for hMTr1 ( Figures 3E and S3D ) and lacking significant endogenous RIG-I activity. Expression of RIG-I(WT) in combination with knockdown of hMTr1 ( Figure 3E , right) led to increased IP10 production as compared to the control setting ( Figure 3E , left). Overexpression of RIG-I(H830A) by itself also led to an increased IP10 response, yet additional silencing of hMTr1 did not considerably augment RIG-I(H830A)-induced IP10 levels ( Figure 3E , right). Altogether these results indicated that hMTr1 activity was required for an active suppression of endogenous RNA recognition by RIG-I. Yellow Fever Virus cap1 2 0 O-Methyltransferase Activity Impairs Recognition by RIG-I Viruses have evolved numerous mechanisms that allow capping and methylation of viral RNA in the cytosol. Flaviviruses (positive ssRNA) express the NS5 protein, which performs RNA polymerization as well as guanine N 7 and ribose 2 0 O-methylations ( Figure S4 ; Zhou et al., 2007) . To examine whether cytosolic RNA viruses use N 1 -2 0 O-methylation to suppress type I IFN induction by RIG-I, we constructed a yellow fever virus replicon (YFVR-WT) and abrogated 2 0 O-methylation activity of NS5 by mutation of NS5-E218 to A (YFVR-E218A) (Zhou et al., 2007) ; replication was monitored by renilla luciferase activity encoded by YFVR ( Figure S4B ). YFVR-E218A (no cap1 methylation of RNA) replication was strongly impaired in A549 cells as compared to the YFVR-WT ( Figure 4A , WT versus 218). By Figure S2F . contrast, no difference in replication of both YFV replicons was found in Vero cells, which lack type I IFN genes ( Figure 4B , WT versus 218). Likewise, when A549 or Vero cells were infected with whole yellow fever virus particles ( Figures 4C and 4D) , the NS5-E218A mutation impaired virus production in A549 cells to a much higher extent (>60-fold reduction, Figure 4C ) than in Vero cells (<5-fold reduction, Figure 4D ). These data indicate that cap1 methylation is involved in the immune escape of yellow fever virus from a type I IFN-dependent host restriction system. To further strengthen this hypothesis, we used RIG-I-deficient and STAT1-deficient A549 cells to assess the influence on YFV replication ( Figure 4E ). Intriguingly, YFV-E218A reached the same virus titer in RIG-I-deficient A549 cells as the wild-type virus. Similar to Vero cells, the replication of YFV-E218A was not impaired in STAT1-deficient A549 cells. Viral replication was reflected by induction of the type I IFN response ( Figure 4F ). As determined 8 hr after infection, YFV-E218A induced a 4-fold higher IFIT1 expression than wild-type YFV. By contrast, no considerable induction of IFIT1 was detected in RIG-I-and STAT1-deficient A549 cells. The data demonstrate that RIG-I is essential for type I IFN induction by YFV in A549 cells. Furthermore, these data clearly show that the ability of YFV to methylate Figure S4A ). Replication was monitored by replicon-derived luciferase activity. Average of two experiments in technical duplicates is shown. Error bars indicate SD. (C and D) A549 cells (C) or Vero cells (D) were infected with whole yellow fever virus particles YFV-WT or YFV-E218A (MOI 0.01). Virus production was quantified by plaque assay in BHK cells 24, 48, or 72 hr after infection. One representative of two experiments in technical duplicates is shown. Error bars indicate range. (E) Wild-type, RIG-I-deficient (Ddx58 À/À ), or STAT1-deficient A549 cells were infected with YFV-WT or YFV-E218A (MOI 0.01) and virus production was quantified as in (C) 72 hr after infection. (F) Wild-type, RIG-I-deficient (Ddx58 À/À ), or STAT1-deficient A549 cells were infected with YFV-WT or YFV-E218A (MOI 1) and IFIT1 mRNA was measured Altogether these results demonstrated that cap1 2 0 O-methylation of YFV RNA constitutes a viral subversion mechanism to evade RIG-I recognition.
