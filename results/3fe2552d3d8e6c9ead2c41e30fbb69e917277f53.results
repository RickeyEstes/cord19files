Demographic and clinical characteristics. The demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in with diabetes, 12 (6.0%) with cardiovascular diseases, 4 (2.0%) with malignancy, and 6 (3.0%) with thyroid diseases. The most common symptom identified was fever (86.9%). Patients' body temperatures were most commonly in a range from 38-38.9 °C (IQR). 10 (8.8%) patients presented with high fever greater than 39 . Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough (46.4%), sputum production (23.2%), itchy or sore throat (9.8%), shortness of breath (4.5%) and chest congestion (8.0%). Myalgia or fatigue occurred in almost one-third (31.3%) of the patients. In addition, 5 (4.4%) patients had diarrhoea, which is suggestive of digestive system involvement (Table 1) . No infections of health care workers were detected during the time interval studied. A history of recent travel to Wuhan, and contact with people from Wuhan was documented in 126 (63.6%) of the patients. There was no difference in severity of disease between cases with Wuhan contact history and no-Wuhan contact history. Of these 198 patients, 179 (90.4%) were admitted to isolation wards, including 3 mild and 176 moderate cases. 19 (9.5%) were admitted and transferred to the ICU because of the development of respiratory failure or other organ dysfunction, including 9 severe cases and 10 critical cases. 1 patient died All rights reserved.

Patient age differed significantly between the two groups (63.7 ± 16.8 for ICU vs 48.6 ± 15.6 for non-ICU patients). Male patients were significantly more common in ICU as compared with non-ICU cases (89.5% vs. 46.9%). Moreover, patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases were significantly more common in ICU cases as compared with non-ICU cases (26.3% vs. 3.9%, P<0.01). Compared with the non-ICU, patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to have high fever with temperature over 38.5 o C (78.6% vs 37.6%), shortness of breath (36.8% vs 2.2%), and longer waiting period from onset of symptom to hospital admission (7 vs 4 days).

However, a marked rise in fibrinogen and CRP was observed in 108 (55.4%) and 152 (78.4%) cases, respectively. The majority of patients (65.4%) had decreased blood calcium concentration, while 19.5% cases had decreased blood sodium concentration. Compared with the non-ICU patients, patients admitted to the ICU were more likely to have increased neutrophil count (15.8% vs 5.2%), decreased lymphocyte count (84.2% vs 0.6%), increased prothrombin time (26.3% vs 7.4%), increased APTT (42.1% vs 15.3), increased fibrinogen (78.9% vs 52.8%) and increased D-dimer (63.2% vs 29.5%), as well as decreased levels of blood sodium (42.1% vs 17.0%) and calcium (100% vs 61.4%). By contrast, patients admitted to the ICU were less likely to have increased C-reactive protein (57.9% vs 80.6%).

Of 198 patients who underwent chest computed tomography on admission, 98.5 % cases manifested abnormalities suggestive of pneumonia. The most common patterns on chest computed tomography were ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy consolidation. Figure 1 illustrates representative findings with different degrees of radiological abnormalities from seven patients.
