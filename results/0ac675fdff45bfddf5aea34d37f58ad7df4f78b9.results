Comparative genomics of HAdV-B14p and two HAdV-B14p1 strains The complete genome of HAdV-B14p1 strain BJ430 contains 34,762 base pairs (bp). This is very similar to the genomes of the prototype and another HAdV-B14p1 virus (strain 303600; Lackland Air Force Base, USA), with genome sizes of 34,764 bp. Fortytwo putative coding regions (Table 1 ) were identified in this genome along with conserved non-coding sequence motifs that are in common with HAdV-B14p1 (strain 303600) and the prototype ( Table 2) . A map of the genome organization of coding sequences from strain BJ430 is shown in Fig. 1 . Note that the colors of the arrows are used for contrast only and to group the coding regions to the gene transcripts, e.g., E1A, L1, E2B, etc. The colors do not reflect any other relationships other than grouping the genes to their transcript, for example, the two red genes of ''L1'' have no relationships to the eight red genes of ''E3''. When the genome of the HAdV-B14p1 strain BJ430 was compared to those from the HAdV-B14p1 strain 303600 and the prototype HAdV-B14p ''de Wit'' viruses, the percent nucleotide identities were 99.9% and 99.7%, respectively (GenBank acc. no. FJ822614 and AY803294). However, there were sequence differences amongst them, indicating that although the HAdV-B14p1 viruses may have a common ancestry, they have diverged from one another recently. Between the two genomes of HAdV-B14p1, and using BJ430 as the reference, there are eleven base substitutions, four single base insertions and two deletions, with one involving a single base (A) and the other involving TT. On the other hand, strain BJ430 differs from HAdV-B14p by 94 base substitutions and, relative to strain BJ430, there are five insertions (T, AAA, A, T, AGAAAA) and six deletions (GTG, T, TT, A, A, AA). Of these, the sixnucleotide deletion results in the deletion of amino acids 251 and 252 (Lys and Glu) that are located in the fiber knob near the recognized putative receptor-binding site [21] . In regards to the fiber gene, the sequence from strain BJ430 was identical to strain 303600. For the hexon gene, there was one single base substitution (G to A), which resulted in a synonymous mutation.
