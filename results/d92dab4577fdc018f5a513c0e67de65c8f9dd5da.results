The addition of 0.2 ml of the virus seed stock caused the appearance of a cytopathic effect (CPE) in J774 cells in 7 -14 days. The CPE was accelerated by the addition of 10 mgm/ml of trypsin. The CPE consisted of the formation of giant cells and small syncytia. In C6/36 cells there was no apparent CPE. Immunofluorescent staining of the cytoplasm of both cell types could be demonstrated by the addition of immune but not non-immune sera followed by the appropriate fluoresceinated conjugate. Immunofluorescence appeared first in J774 cells and soon after in C6/36 cells; in an occasional titration in C6/36 cells, immunofluorescence appeared late but was always present 21 days after inoculation. With J774 cells, the addition of fluoresceinated anti-human Ig resulted in fluorescence of all the cells because these cells contain receptors for the Fc fragment of IgG. Specific reactions in J774 cells could only be demonstrated with the use of immune sera and a fluoresceinated anti-Hu IgM conjugate. Initially, the only IgM antibody positive sera we had were from the infants identified in the epidemic. Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been noted to have CVLPs in stool (Kern et al., 1985; Grohmann et al., 1993) . We surveyed a group of these patients and found that some of them had high titers of Ig and IgM antibody to HEC. By using these sera, we were able to follow passages and determine whether or not the quantity of virus was increasing. Because of the presence of Fc receptors on J774 cells, we could not determine whether mouse antiserum to OC43 virus or guinea pig antiserum to 229E virus would specifically stain infected cells. However, C6/36 cells could be utilized. Although infected C6/36 cells were brightly stained by human immune sera, they were not stained by a 1:10 dilution of OC43 antiserum and only nonspecifically by 229E antiserum. This non-specific immunofluorescence affected all cells, was identical in control cells, was not reduced by prior reaction with immune human sera and completely disappeared at a 1:40 dilution. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of infected J774 cells revealed the presence of CVLPs budding into cysternae of the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1 ). An interior nucleocapsid-like structure could be seen along with elongated peplomers which had clubbed ends. By TEM, the CVLPs had diameters ranging from 80 to 120 nm. Negatively stained EMs of ultracentrifuged glutaraldehyde fixed supernatants from both cell types revealed CVLPs (Fig. 2) . In negatively stained EMs, the CVLPs were more pleomorphic, ranging from 70 to 125 nm in diameter. A rare particle had a diameter of 220 nm. For 20 parti- Fig. 4 . Western blot of OC43 antigen and various antisera. Note that OC43 and A N antisera stain the major protein N at 49 kDa whereas Patient 1 (Ig and IgM) does not nor does antiserum to 229E. Fig. 3 . PAGE of PEG precipitate centrifuged on a 20-60% sucrose gradient at 130 000 g for 18 h at 4Â°C and silver stained. The column on the right was from a band at mid-gradient; the column to the left was from a band just above mid-gradient. cles with typical morphology, the median and mode values were 100 nm each. PEG precipitated virus prepared in J774 cells were subjected to equilibrium sucrose density ultracentrifugation. Two bands at the mid-center of the gradient were collected, subjected to PAGE and silver stained (Fig. 3) . The band on the right was at mid-qradient, 4.8 cm from the bottom. The band on the left was collected 5.9 cm from the bottom of the gradient. Western blots were prepared using sucrose gradient purified OC43, 229E, and HEC viruses (Figs. 4-6) . With the OC43 WB, staining was seen with OC43 antiserum and the h N antiserum to the N protein of MHV (strain A59). There was no staining with 229E antiserum or with Patient 1, IgM. Patients 1, 3, 5 and 6 had AIDS. Patient 2 was from a developing country and Patient 4 was an infant involved in the original nursery outbreak. With the 229E WB, staining is seen with 229E antiserum but not OC43 nor h N nor Patient 1 (Ig). The HEC WB shows three preparations from different samples of infected J774 cells. Note in panel 1 the reaction of Patient 1, IgM to two protein bands located below 49 kDa and the absence of any reactions to these bands with 229E, OC43, and h N antisera. The second and third panels demonstrate IgM antibody reactions to the protein band below 49 kDa as well as to other proteins. A WB was also prepared from infected C6/36 cells and similar and additional bands were observed (Fig. 7) . Since we used prestained molecular weight markers, we can only estimate the molecular weights of HEC. In aver-age, the proteins range in molecular weight from 24 to 190 kDa; the major protein (N) centers at about 41 kDa. Two other protein bands are seen, one at 124 kDa and the other at 64 kDa, particularly in the C6/36 cell preparation. These bands are similar to and different from the OC43 and 229E WBs in which the same pre-stained molecular weight markers were used. Preparations of HEC did not agglutinate mouse erythrocytes. We had no success in passaging this virus in other cell lines (MRC-5, A549) nor intracerebrally in suckling mice. Human colonic tumor (HCT-8) cells did not consistently replicate the virus.
