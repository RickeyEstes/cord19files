Efficacy of the Iota-Carrageenan nasal spray 35 subjects were screened, enrolled and randomized. One subject (Iota-Carrageenan) was lost in the follow up after the initial screening visit and no additional data were obtained. 34 subjects completed the study drug administration and were included in the safety analysis. Demographic data and a study flow chart are shown in Figure  1 . Two subjects were excluded from the analysis of symptoms due to protocol violations that were defined as an exclusion criterion in the study protocol. Subject 11 reported vomiting, nausea and abdominal pain presumably caused by an infection of the gastrointestinal tract and furthermore used ibuprofen as concomitant medication. Subject 23 reported migraine that was treated with ibuprofen and a swollen eye due presumably to an allergic reaction that was treated with an oral anti-histamine during the observation period. The subject was therefore excluded from the efficacy analysis of symptoms. In total, 14 Iota-Carrageenan patients and 18 placebo patients were eligible for analysis of symptoms. The predefined primary efficacy parameter for the trial was the difference between Iota-Carrageenan and placebo in total symptom scores on days 2-4 (TSS 2-4). Iota-Carrageenan nasal spray was superior to placebo (p < 0.046) with respect to the primary endpoint mean of TSS over days 2-4 ( Table 1) . The mean total symptom scores over 7 days are shown in Figure 2 . The efficacy of the Iota-Carrageenan nasal spray treatment appears to be mainly observable on the local symptom scores (LSS) sore throat, blocked nose, runny nose, cough, and sneezing, as there was little difference between treatments for the systemic symptom scores (SSS) headache, muscle ache, chilliness ( Figure 2 ). This is reflected in the results of LSS and SSS mean of sum on days 2-4 which were lower for Iota-Carrageenan patients with significance levels of 0.064 and 0.704, respectively (Table 1) . While there is no statistical difference TSS on day 1 (p < 0.231), the difference is significant on day 3 (p < 0.040) indicating a faster relief of symptoms in the Iota-Carrageenan group. Average individual symptoms scores blocked nose, runny nose, cough, and sneezing were higher for placebo when compared to verum (Figure 3 ). The individual symptoms blocked nose and runny nose show the highest scores indicating that these symptoms are most bothersome. For all individual LSS a trend towards superiority of the Iota-Carrageenan nasal spray can be observed. At inclusion subjects reported a slightly higher score for the Iota-Carrageenan group for the symptoms blocked nose, cough and sore throat. These three symptoms showed an increase in the placebo group but not in the Iota-Carrageenan group at the next reporting time points. This result suggests that the Iota-Carrageenan nasal spray treatment has an inhibitory effect on the development of common cold symptoms shortly after start of therapy. At the study end point (day 7), placebo patients reported a mean blocked nose score of 0.78. In contrast, Iota-Carrageenan patients reported a mean blocked nose score of 0.42, corresponding to a reduction of approximately 50% (Figure 3 ). Further post hoc analysis of this symptom revealed that 71.4% of Iota-Carrageenan patients did not report the symptom blocked nose at the end of the study. In the placebo group only 36.4% of subjects were free of this symptom.
