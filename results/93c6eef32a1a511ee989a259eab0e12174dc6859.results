To create an error filter, we constructed a fusion protein between MBP (19) and the mismatch binding protein from T.aquaticus (22) with a C-terminal His 6 tag (MBP-MutS-H6). MBP-MutS-H6 was overexpressed and purified from E.coli to >95% purity (Supplementary Figure 1) . MBP-MutS-H6 immobilized on amylose resin was shown to selectively retain a 40mer heteroduplex containing a deletion mutation over wild-type homoduplex (Supplementary Figure 2) . To demonstrate error correction, unpurified 40mer oligonucleotides were assembled by PCR (3) to produce a 760 bp gene encoding green fluorescent protein (25) (GFPuv). Two independent preparations of GFPuv containing typical gene synthesis errors (Figure 3 and Table 1 ) were re-hybridized and subjected to two iterations of coincidence filtering or consensus shuffling. For consensus shuffling, the GFPuv assembly product was split into three pools and digested into sets of overlapping fragments using distinct Type II restriction enzymes ( Figure 2 ). The digests were pooled and subjected to error filtering with or without added MBP-MutS-H6. The unbound fragments were reassembled into full-length products and PCR amplified. For coincidence filtering, unbound fulllength GFPuv was PCR amplified following treatment with the error filter. After cloning in E.coli, error rates were estimated by scoring colonies for fluorescence under a handheld UV lamp (Figure 3) . The actual error rates of the input and consensus shuffled populations were determined by sequencing plasmid DNA from randomly selected colonies (Figure 3) . The results show that two rounds of consensus shuffling increased the percentage of fluorescent colonies from $60 to >90% and Table 1 . Sequence errors in input and consensus shuffled DNA Table 1 .
