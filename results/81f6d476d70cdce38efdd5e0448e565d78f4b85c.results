The virulent CB strain of P. c. chabaudi induces more severe pathology in the acute phase of a blood-stage infection compared with the avirulent AS strain. Infection of C57BL/6 mice was initiated by intraperitoneal inoculation of 10 5 infected red blood cells (iRBC) of P. c. chabaudi AS or CB. Infection with the CB strain gave rise to a more severe infection, resulting in 40% (range 20-60%) of mice reaching the humane end points (more than 25% weight loss, persistent laboured breathing and severe hypothermia), while all AS infected mice survived the infection without showing severe pathologies (Fig. 1a) . AS and CB infected mice showed comparable iRBC loads (parasitemia multiplied by total RBC numbers), despite the fact that higher peak The total numbers of infected red blood cells (iRBC) per ml of blood (b) and the parasitemia (percentage of infected iRBC) (c) in the mice infected with AS or CB parasites.

Scientific RepoRts | 7:41722 | DOI: 10 .1038/srep41722 parasitemias were observed in the acute CB infection (Fig. 1b,c) . A more severe RBC loss with a significantly lower hemoglobin concentration was observed in CB infection at 10 days post infection (dpi) compared to that in AS infected mice, agreeing with previous observations, which showed more severe anemia in CB infected BALB/c mice 4 . Moreover, the RBC loss in CB infected mice is longer lasting, even after the peak of infection at 12 dpi (Fig. 1d,e) . In addition, at 10 dpi, CB infected mice showed greater temperature and weight loss (Fig. 1f,g) . Virulent CB and avirulent AS strains of P. c. chabaudi induce distinct responses in host whole blood transcriptome. To investigate whether AS and CB parasites induce different host responses that might contribute to the differences in severity of the blood-stage infection we carried out genome-wide transcriptomic analyses of whole blood during the acute phase of infection. Peripheral blood was collected into Tempus tubes via cardiac puncture from C57BL/6 mice infected with AS or CB at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 dpi. Blood samples collected from age-matched uninfected animals at day 0 and day 12 were used as naïve controls to exclude transcriptional changes due to time. The total RNA was extracted, depleted of globin mRNA and analysed using Illumina Mouse WG-6 v2.0 Beadarrays. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (r s ) analysis of unfiltered transcripts normalised across the median of all samples, revealed high levels of similarity amongst naïve and 2, 4 dpi samples in both AS and CB infections (Fig. 2ai ,ii, r s ranging from 0.73 to 0.88), while from 6 dpi onwards the whole blood transcriptomes diverge significantly from the earlier time points (r s ranging from 0.08 to − 0.59 compared to naïve controls). When comparing AS and CB infections at each of the time points, lower correlation values were observed between 6-10 dpi (Fig. 2aiii , r s = 0.37, 0.67, 0.44, respectively). This indicates that AS and CB infections induce different host responses at these times of infection. AS infected mice and those CB infected mice that survived this phase of infection showed similar profiles at 12 dpi (Fig. 2aiii , r s = 0.82). Differential expression analysis (ANOVA unequal variance with post-hoc HSD test, FDR < 0.01) was performed on transcripts normalised to the median of their respective naïve controls (Supplementary Table 1 ). At any of the post-infection time points examined, there were 6226 differentially expressed transcripts with a greater than 2-fold change in the infected mice compared to the naïve mice (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 1a) . Consistent with correlation analyses of unfiltered transcripts (Fig. 2a) , only a few transcripts were differentially expressed at 2 and 4 dpi (Fig. 2b) . Strikingly, at 6 dpi, a large majority of transcripts were down-regulated compared to naïve controls in both AS and CB infections. However, the number was greater in CB infected mice compared to AS (AS 1856 out of 2265 transcripts, CB 4306 out of 4471 transcripts) (Fig. 2b) . The number of down-regulated transcripts increased steadily from 6 to 12 dpi in AS infection (Fig. 2b) . While down-regulation of transcripts was also observed at 6-8 dpi in the CB infection, the level of down-regulation was significantly lower at 10 dpi and there was a sudden up-regulation of transcripts occurred only in CB infected mice at this time point (Fig. 2b , Supplementary Fig. 1a ), a critical time point when infected animals were either recovering from acute infection or suffering from severe pathologies leading to death (Fig. 1) , indicating that these up-regulated transcripts may relate to the manifestation of severe pathology in the CB infection. Indeed this higher level of transcriptional up-regulation was further confirmed in 4 CB infected mice that had reached humane end points at 9 dpi ( Supplementary Fig. 1b ). This up-or down-regulation of gene expression in whole blood are due to both the leukocyte population changes and transcript regulation during the infection ( Supplementary Fig. 1c ).
