Replacement of H3 HA TM domain did not affect the assembly and viral protein compositions of recombinant H9N2 viruses. To understand whether change of transmembrane (TM) domain can affect virus structure, we first observed the morphology of TM-replaced viruses rescued by reserve genetics. Applying electron microscope, the recombined TM-replaced virus (H9N2-TM) showed typical surface spikes as the recombined wildtype (H9N2-WT) (Fig. 1B) , suggesting the replacement of the transmembrane (TM) domain did not change the surface structure of the virus. SDS-PAGE showed that the expression levels of HA0, HA1, HA2, NP, and M1 proteins were comparable in the two viruses (Fig. 1C) . Full-length blot is presented in Supplementary Figure 1A . These results suggest that the replacement of H3 HA transmembrane (TM) domain does not affect the assembly and viral protein compositions of recombinant H9N2 viruses.
