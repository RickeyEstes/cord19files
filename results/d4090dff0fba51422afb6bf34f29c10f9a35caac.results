Performance of qRT-PCR primers. Gene specific amplification was confirmed by a single peak in the melting-curve analysis for all the genes (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). The linear regression equation, correlation coefficient, PCR efficiency and standard curve for each gene are shown in Supplementary Figs S3 and S4. The efficiency of all the primers for the genes ranged from 93-107%. Ct value of candidate reference genes. The mean Ct value of the genes in control, infected and combined groups is given in Supplementary Table S1 . The mean Ct value of the reference genes ranged from 26.939 ± 0.153 (B2M) to 28.938 ± 0.191 (ACTB) in goats and 26.339 ± 0.19 (ACTB) to 28.332 ± 0.166 (POLR2A) in goats. Expression profile of all the 10 reference genes in both the species is represented by box whisker plots ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ).
