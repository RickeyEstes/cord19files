We fitted the three different models in Eqns (1-3) to the time series data of ZIKV incidences number from eight states in Brazil from October 2015 to May 2016. Figure 2 shows that the selected models can provide a good fit to the observations. All selected models achieved a level of R 2 larger than 0.995. For each state, we selected the fitting results with the lowest value of AIC as the most suitable model (Table 1, Fig. 2 ). In particular, the Richards model is selected for Acre, Bahia, and Pernambuco; Gompertz model is selected for Mato Grosso and Rio Grande; and the logistic model is selected for Espirito Santo, Goiania City and Parana. The reproduction number, R, estimates vary from 1.54 to 3.07 for the eight different states ( Table 1) . We estimate R = 1.54 (95% CI: 1.43-1.65) in Rio Grande, and R = 3.07 (95% CI: 2.92-3.24) in Goiania City. The estimated dates of the turning points also vary from January to April of 2016, with 4 out of 8 states in March 2016. For the same state, the final size estimates from different models are roughly consistent, with the 95% CIs largely overlapping. The estimated final (epidemic) sizes, K, are also summarized in Table 1 . We estimate the largest final outbreak size of 55,472 (95% CI: 54,683-56,260) in Bahia for the outbreak since October 2015, after the one epidemic wave in early 2015 [4, 10] . To evaluate the potentials for the real-time estimation, we shortened the fitting period starting from the end time of the epidemic reporting period, and further checked the sensitivity of the estimates of K and τ. The epidemic reporting period is the period that local authority starts and ends the reporting of ZIKV cases, which is different from the real epidemic period. The real epidemic period starts earlier than the actual reporting starting date. For each state, the model with the lowest value of AIC is selected here, and all AIC values are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2 . Table 2 summarizes the real-time estimation from the selected models. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the estimates of the epidemic size (or final size) and the end time of model fitting. We summarized the estimates using the incomplete dataset and using the complete dataset in Table 2 , where the final epidemic size estimates by using the complete dataset match the red dots in Fig. 3 . The early estimates of the turning points (τ) and reproduction numbers (R) are almost the same as the final results. The real-time estimates of epidemic size, K, converge to the estimates by using the full dataset (the red dots in Fig. 3) , when the end time of the subsequent fitting period (T 1 ) is longer than the turning point (τ), i.e. T 1 > τ. The estimated epidemic sizes using the incomplete dataset are roughly consistent to the final estimates. Note that for a few states (e.g. Rio Grande), the estimated epidemic size is higher than the reported cumulative counts; this is due to the outbreak sustained after the end of disease notification (reporting) period. The epidemic size, K, is the final outbreak size until the end of the epidemic. Moreover, for all states we find that the epidemic sizes estimated 6-35 days after the turning points are indifferent from their final estimations, which means the 95% CIs are largely overlapping (Table 2 ). This finding indicates that the final outbreak size (K) can be estimated around the epidemic peaking stage by the projections from the simple growth models. By fixing τ to be the first days of February, March and April of 2016, the K projection converges as more data is including in the model training (Fig. 4) . When the assumed turning point becomes closer to the real turning point, the projection of K will gain more accuracy and converges faster even during the early stage of the epidemics (i.e. before the occurrence of the real turning point).
