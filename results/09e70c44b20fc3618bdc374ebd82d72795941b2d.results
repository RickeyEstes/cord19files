During the 2 years of the study (November 15, 2000 , to November 14, 2002 , there were 3,043 patients with pneumonia (who met criteria for the pathway) admitted to the six Edmonton hospitals ( Table 1 ). In addition, the following patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia were excluded from the study: 704 patients who required admission to an ICU from the emergency department; 352 patients with aspiration pneumonia (first year of the study only-these patients were included in the second year once the pneumonia pathway team had decided on antibiotic therapy for this subset of patients); physician choice (n ϭ 136); palliative care (n ϭ 113); pregnancy (n ϭ 36); immunosuppressed (n ϭ 88); cystic fibrosis (n ϭ 22); WBC count Ͻ 1,000 (n ϭ 19); tuberculosis (n ϭ 11); nosocomial pneumonia (n ϭ 59), bronchiectasis (n ϭ 58); pulmonary fibrosis (n ϭ 78); bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (n ϭ 9); talc lung (n ϭ 2); collagen vascular disease (n ϭ 3); sepsis with no pneumonia (n ϭ 7); exacerbation of COPD (n ϭ 15); diagnosis changed from pneumonia to another diagnosis by attending physician with 48 h of admission (n ϭ 80); HIV infection with CD4 count Ͻ 250 (n ϭ 42); and unknown reasons (n ϭ 121). The admission rate to ICU from the emergency department varied from 0 (this community hospital did not have an ICU, and patients requiring ICU were transferred to one of the other hospitals) to 16%. The rates of admission at the tertiary care hospitals were 11.6% and 16.7%, respectively, and for the secondary care hospitals were 7.8% and 10.2%; for the two community hospitals, rates of admission were 0 and 5.2%, respectively. Admission to an ICU from the ward was uncommon, occurring in only 10 patients, 4 of whom died. The mean age of the included patients was 69.6 Ϯ 17.7 years; 52.5% were male patients, 47.5% were female patients, and 246 patients (8.1%) died. The site-specific mortality rate ranged from 6 to 13.3%. Table 1 also shows that there were site differences in the mean age, mean pneumonia severity of illness score, mean time from presentation until the first dose of antibiotic, mean length of stay, and median household income. Thirty-one percent were admitted from a nursing home or from a residence where they required some care. Only 60.2% were fully ambulatory; 7.2% required a wheelchair, and 3.4% were bed bound. Three hundred seventy-six patients (12%) had a limitation of care order. One hundred sixty-six patients (5.4%) were taken off the pathway because of increasing severity of the pneumonia; 113 of these were transferred to ICU. Since all of these patients were eligible for the study at the time of hospital admission, they are included in the analysis. One thousand fifty-one patients had the get-upand-go test done, and 441 patients (41.9%) failed. Six hundred seventy-six patients had the mini-mental status examination done, and 311 patients (46%) failed. Table 2 compares selected features of those who survived pneumonia vs those who died. There are a number of instructive observations. Not unexpectedly, there were major differences in mean age, mean pneumonia severity risk score, and mean length of stay between the two groups. Also, the effect of functional status at the time of admission on subsequent mortality was striking. Thus, 4.0%, 11.6%, 20.1%, and 25.2% of those who were walking, walking with assistance, wheelchair, and bedridden, respectively, died. The mean ages for patients in each of these groups were 63.8, 80.0, 73.3, and 74.4 years, respectively. The mean pneumonia severity risk scores for patients in the four functional status categories were 90.6, 117.3, 113.7, and 117.6, respectively. Ten of the 610 patients (1.6%) who passed the get-up-and-go test died, compared with 62 of the 441 patients (14.0%) who failed this test. The group that passed this test was younger (77.3 years vs 81.6 years), had a lower mean risk score (102.2 vs 121.8), and a lower percentage of patients in risk classes IV and V (73% vs 86%). There were major differences in mortality according to the site of hospitalization, with mortality rates ranging from 5.9 to 13.3%. As shown in the multivariate analysis, site of care remained a significant predictor for mortality after simultaneously adjusting for other factors. The type of antibiotic therapy seemed to influence the mortality rate. The mortality rate for the 1,672 patients who were treated with levofloxacin only was 5.3%, while 5.4% of the 166 patients treated with cefuroxime plus azithromycin died. The mortality rate among the 1,205 patients who received any other antibiotic or antibiotic combination was 12.2%. It is noteworthy that the time from presentation to the emergency department until the first dose of antibiotic did not influence mortality. In addition to the data provided in Table 1 , the mortality rates for the 1,235, 1,078, and 924 patients who received antibiotics within 0 to 4, 4 to 8, and Ͼ 8 h after presentation to the emergency department were 9.2%, 8.6%, and 8.7%, respectively. When we removed the patients who received antibiotics prior to presentation to the emergency department from the above data, the numbers of patients were 1,028, 876, and 712, for 0 to 4 h, 4 to 8 h, and Ͼ 8 h, respectively; and the corresponding mortality rates were 8.3%, 7.9%, and 8.4%. One thousand nine hundred seventy-three patients (64.8%) received a single antibiotic for the treatment of their pneumonia. Most of these, 1,838 patients (93%) received levofloxacin only. One hundred eighty-eight patients (6.2%) received cefuroxime and azithromycin only. An additional 628 patients received two antibiotics, 406 patients received three, 121 patients received four, and 77 patients received five or more antibiotics. In most instances, the multiple antibiotics represented sequential therapy. Five factors were significantly associated with mortality in the multivariate analysis (Table 3) : pneumonia severity of illness score, increasing age, site of care, consultation by a respirologist or an infectious diseases physician, and functional status at the time of admission (using a wheelchair or being bedridden at the time of hospital admission was associated with increased mortality). A fifth factor-treatment with levofloxacin only-was protective for mortality. In addition, compliance with the pathway was margin-ally associated with a reduction in mortality, although the significance was not as strong as the other factors identified above. Table 4 compares those who died early, within 5 days of hospital admission, to those who died late, Ն 5 days after admission. Table 5 shows the factors that were associated with early and late mortality by multivariate analysis. Increasing pneumonia severity risk score, increasing age, site of hospitalization, functional status, and consultation with an infectious diseases physician or a respirologist were independently associated with both early and late mortality. In contrast, partial or complete use of the pneumonia pathway were marginally associated with decreased early mortality, but had no effect on late mortality. A low lymphocyte count and a high potassium level were associated with early, but not with late mortality. The type of antibiotic therapy had an effect on late but not on early mortality. Treatment with levofloxacin alone or with cefuroxime plus azithromycin was associated with decreased mortality compared with treatment with other antibiotics. Only one of the patients with a potassium level Ͼ 5 mmol/L had chronic renal failure and was receiving dialysis; however, 14 others had creatinine levels Ͼ 500 mmol/L indicating acute renal failure.
