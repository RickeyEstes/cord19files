A data set of 600 HSV-1 capsid particle images in different orientations was used to test the HWPM method. The defocus range of herpes particles was chosen to be close to focus between 1.7 µm and 0.4 µm. An initial model of about a 40 Å resolution [4] was used to generate projections uniformly covering the asymmetric triangle of the icosahedrally symmetric HSV-1 capsid particle [4, 5] . A grid sampling of 0.5° in each direction of the asymmetric triangle of icosahedral particles was used. The number of projections obtained with this grid was relatively high (2616 projections). First, the 2616 projections were grouped into 200 classes, each class containing about 13 projections. A match of the particle into the best 3 of the 200 classes was obtained using the wavelet correlation coefficient (wccf) criterion. Next, the particle was compared to the 39 projections of the best three classes, and the correct orientation was that of the projection giving the highest wccf. The hierarchical implementation wavelet projection matching reduced the time at least by a factor of 10 compared with the classical projection matching method. In the example of 600 particles, by using HWPM it took approximately 3 hours to determine the orientations, instead the 33 hours it took with the classical matching algorithm. Both algorithms were running on the SGI Origin-2000 supercomputer using 10 processors. At this point, each particle had been assigned the orientation of the closest projection. A quality factor was assigned to each orientation, which was the wavelet correlation coefficient. Particles having high wccf coefficients were selected for reconstruction of a first 3D model of the virus. Refinement of initial orientations obtained by HWPM was realized by the same iterative refinement process used in focal pair method [5] . This refinement process uses both local and global refinement. Local-refinement refines orientations against a set of projections from the 3D density map. In global refinement, all the raw particle orientations are refined against each other, without using projections from the 3D model. A potential merit of global refinement is the absence of possible bias arising from the 3D model. In order to assess the accuracy of the orientations obtained with the HWPM. A comparison with the focal pair method (Fig. 5 .a), which is currently the most appropriate method for low contrast virus images was accomplished. The following steps were executed. First the initial orientations of the far-from focus particles were determined by using the cross-common line method between real particles and a set of projections obtained from the low resolution model. Next, a global refinement process was realized in order to determine the initial orientation. The same software as in [4] was used with the same initial parameters. The parameters used in this software were the minimum radius and maximum radius limiting the resolution and the sampling step size of 4.67Å/pixel. The minimum valid radius ensured that the minimal radius was computationally accurate when the two common lines angles were close and also to avoid the biasing of the orientations of particles by the very low frequency components. This parameter choice for herpes at the above sampling step was 5 pixels. The maximum radius was chosen to limit the maximum resolution expected from the reconstruction, here in the initial orientation the maximum radius corresponding to a resolution about 40 Å. Then an assignment of the particle orientations from the far to focus to the close to focus is realized. Next, an iterative refinement process to the close-to-focus data was accomplished as described in [5] . A 3D reconstruction using the best 300 HSV-1 particle orientations was performed for each method. Fig. 5 .a and Fig. 5 .b show surfaces density contour, displayed at one standard deviation above the mean density [9] , obtained respectively from focal pair method and HWPM method. Both structures show a similar visual resemblance. In order to assess the reliability of the 3D density maps and the quality of particles orientations obtained from each method, the Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) criterion, which is the most robust criterion [10, 11] , was employed. The FSC was calculated between 2 independent reconstructions from comparison between 3D reconstruction obtained from both methods Figure 5 Comparison between 3D reconstruction obtained from both methods. Reconstruction of the B-capsid of the herpes simplex virus type-1: in (a) the initial orientations are determined from the second picture and then refined using the first picture. In (b) Initial orientation is determined from the wavelet-projection matching algorithm with one refinement iteration using the common line program. Both iso-surfaces are displayed at 1 standard deviation above the mean. the same set of orientations for each method. The effective resolution assessment of the 3D structure obtained from each method is estimated at FSC correlation value of 0.5, which correspond to 45° phase difference. Fig. 6 shows three different plots. The green curve shows a resolution of 32 Å of the reconstruction using the best 300 particles with orientations obtained from the focal pair method. The blue curve shows a resolution of 24 Å of the reconstruction using 300 particles with orientations obtained from the HWPM method. This result shows that the resolution of the structure obtained from the HWPM is higher than the one using the orientations from the focal pair method. Therefore, the orientations obtained from HWPM method are more accurate. Furthermore, HWPM method uses only one set of close-to-focus data instead of the two sets used by the focal pair method. The purple curve shows a resolution of about 14.5 Å of the reconstruction using 500 particles with orientations assigned by HWPM. The red curve plots twice the expected FSC for Gaussian noise. A less stringent criterion to assess the resolution as the intersection between the FSC curve and the curve plotting the 2 times expected Gaussian noise. HWPM was tested on a P22 empty shell capsid which was circular and whose shell is very thin (~40 Angstrom). Twenty micrographs of the P22 empty shell capsid with defocus range [0.5 to 2 µm] were used for testing purpose. The total number of particles is 1340, each image has a size of 300 × 300 pixels, and the dimension of each pixel is 2.8 Å. Concerning the initial orientations determinations using HWPM method, an initial model of around 20 Å resolutions was used to generate projections which uniformly covered the asymmetric triangle of the icosahedrally symmetric model. A grid sampling of 2° in each direction of the asymmetric triangle of icosahedral symmetry was used to obtain an initial orientation, targeting a structure of 30 Å. The number of projections obtained with this grid was about 200 projections. A match of the particle with FSC between 2 independent reconstruction for each method Figure 6 FSC between 2 independent reconstruction for each method. Green and blue lines show the correlation as function of the spatial frequency using 300 particles from the Focal pair method and HWPM respectively. Using the 0.5 correlation point criterion to assess the resolution of the 3D structure, the dotted line gives a resolution of 32 Å and thin line gives a resolution of 24 Å. The purple line shows a reconstruction using 500 particles where the orientation is obtained from the HWPM method the estimated resolution using 0.5 correlation point shows 14.5Å. The red line shows the 2 times expected FSC for Gaussian noise. the projections was obtained by using the wccf criterion. The correct orientation was selected as the one of the projection giving the highest wccf. The better half of the orientations projections (650) according to wccf criterion was chosen for final reconstruction. The initial orientations for the same set of data were determined using the Improved Common Line (ICL) method, with the same input parameters for the software described in [2] . ICL use one single micrograph and does not use focal pair technique. The best half of the particles orientations (650) was chosen, according to the phase residual criterion, in the 3D reconstruction of the P22. Fig. 7 shows three surface views of the P22 empty shell capsid. The Top image shows the original surface [12, 13] . The lower right image shows the surface obtained by HWPM, which shows a very similar view to the original structure. The resolution assessment of the structure, by Fourier shell correlation criterion, gives a resolution of 14.5 Å. The lower left surface shows the result obtained by ICL method. The surface view of the reconstruction obtained from the ICL of the P22 empty shell capsid is dif-ferent from the original P22 capsid. Fig. 7 proves the inaccuracy of some of the initial orientations obtained from the ICL method for such a smooth virus.
