We were able to link the administrative health records of 1671 IBD cases, 1740 siblings, and 10,488 matched controls to their mothers dating back to 1970. The median age of the IBD cohort was 20.0 years (range, 1.0-39.0 years; 25 th percentile, 16; 75 th percentile, 25). A total of 6824 individuals (n ¼ 825 for IBD cases and n ¼ 5999 for controls) were available to examine all events dating back to 1979. The median age for this cohort was 17.0 years (range 1-30.0; 25 th percentile, 13; 75 th percentile, 21). This cohort including data dating back to 1979 was used for the following analyses. Among IBD cases, 97 were diagnosed before age 10 years, 499 were diagnosed between ages 10-20 years, and 229 were diagnosed after age 20 years. The strongest predictor for development of IBD in all models was maternal history of IBD (OR, 4.53; 95% CI, 3.08-6.67 in the model including all neonatal and first year of life events). The model assessing all neonatal events and events in the first year of life found that being in the highest or the second highest socioeconomic quintile at birth vs the lowest (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.01-1.79 and OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.06-1.77, respectively) and infections within the first year of life were associated with later development of IBD at any age (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.09-1.79) ( Table 1) . When assessing Crohn's disease (n ¼ 482) separately from ulcerative colitis (n ¼ 343), maternal history of IBD was strongly predictive for both diseases, and having an infection in the first year life trended toward being predictive but did not reach statistical significance in either disease (Tables 2 and 3 ). Being in a higher socioeconomic status at birth compared to the lowest quintile was predictive of developing ulcerative colitis for all 4 socioeconomic quintiles above the lowest. Assessing neonatal events only, for later development of IBD, the only predictors of later development of IBD were being in the highest vs lowest socioeconomic status by quintile (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.01-1.79) or being in the second highest versus lowest socioeconomic quintile (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.06-1.77). The predictors of being diagnosed with IBD under age 10 (n ¼ 97 IBD cases and 748 controls) included maternal diagnosis of IBD (OR, 5.92; 95% CI, 1.76-19.98), having an infection in the first year of life (OR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.07-8.78), and being born rural vs urban (OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.24-5.20) ( Table 4 ). The predictors of being diagnosed with IBD under age 20 years (n ¼ 499 IBD cases and 4503 controls) included maternal diagnosis of IBD (OR, 4.95; 95% CI, 3.18-7.71), having an infection in the first year of life (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.18-2.24), and being in the highest socioeconomic quintile compared with the lowest at birth (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02-2.00) ( Table 5 ). Maternal diagnosis of IBD was a significant predictor of developing Crohn's disease before age 10 years, but no variables significantly predicted development of ulcerative colitis before age 10 years (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ). Maternal diagnosis of IBD was a significant predictor of developing either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis before age 20 years and infection in the first year of life was a significant predictor of developing Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis before age 20 years (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 ). In a model including data dating back to 1970 from all 1671 persons with IBD and 10,488 controls for mothers IBD status, socioeconomic status at birth, urban vs rural residence, and cesarean section were assessed. For persons with IBD diagnosed at any age, having a maternal IBD diagnosis (OR, 4.54; 95% CI, 3.40-6.06; P < 0.001) and being born into the highest socioeconomic quintile vs the lowest (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.05-1.59; P ¼ 0.01) were predictive of developing IBD. Being born in rural area was protective against developing IBD (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.99; P ¼ 0.04). We undertook an analysis assessing only hospitalizations for infections (excluding outpatient contacts for infection). This did not prove to be significantly predictive of developing IBD, although the sample size was likely too small. We also undertook an analysis of predictors of developing IBD excluding viral infections in the first year of life and in this model infections in the first year of life did not prove to be predictive of developing IBD. Only maternal diagnosis of IBD retained its significance as a predictor (Supplementary Table 6 ). Finally, we undertook an analysis of predictors of IBD, including infections in the first 3 years of life and we found that infections did not predict development of IBD. In this model only maternal diagnosis of IBD and being in the highest or second highest socioeconomic quintile compared to the lowest at birth predicted development of IBD (Supplementary Table 7) . Because infections in the first year of life was a strong predictor of developing IBD in several of our analyses, we explored the direct use of antibiotics where we could, and the diagnoses of immunodeficiency syndromes. From 1996 through 2010 (the years in which antibiotic data were available in our administrative data) within our cohort, there were only 33 individuals with IBD and 270 controls who were born after 1996. For this group of 303 individuals, the mean number of antibiotic prescriptions in the first 10 years of life was 8.97 (95% CI, 6.44-11.50) among persons with IBD compared with a mean of 7.59 (95% CI, 6.63-8.55) among controls (P ¼ .34 for the difference between IBD cases and controls). We modeled antibiotic users, defined by actual antibiotic prescriptions in the first year of life; socioeconomic status at birth; and rural vs urban residence at birth, and there was a trend for antibiotic prescription in the first year of life predicting later IBD diagnosis; however, it was not statistically significant (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 0.74-3.74; P ¼ .21). In assessing for immunodeficiency disorders at any time in life, we found them to be diagnosed in 34 of 825 (4.1%) of IBD cases and in 220 of 5999 (3.67%) controls (P ¼ .49). Hence, neither overall childhood antibiotic use nor immunodeficiency disorder was associated with a diagnosis of IBD. Unaffected sibling comparisons showed no predictors of developing IBD at any age (Table 6 ). Having gastrointestinal infections, gastrointestinal disease, or abdominal pain in the first year of life did not increase the risk for developing IBD.
