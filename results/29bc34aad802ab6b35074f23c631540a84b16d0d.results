Hubei were chosen based on the lowest prediction errors in Supplementary  Figures 1(a) , 4(a) and 6(a), and ηptq " a 0`a1 pt´t 1 q´`a 2 pt´t 2 q´by With the form of ηptq " a 0`a1 pt´t 1 q´`a 2 pt´t 2 q´with t 1 being January 167 23 and t 2 being January 27 and m " 6, we estimate δ " pγ 1 1 , a 1 , β 1 q 1 based on 168 t " 1,¨¨¨, T of 28 provinces using the method displayed in Section 2. Table   169 1 displays the resulting estimators for β. Rail transportation and migration Since γ kt " γ k1 ś t j"2 η j and the ratio of transmission rate η t are the same over 176 28 provinces, the initial transmission rates γ k1 can be used to compare the 177 strength of the prevention and control for the NCP epidemic in 28 provinces.
