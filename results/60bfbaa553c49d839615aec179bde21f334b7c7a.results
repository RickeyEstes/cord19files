From November 1993 to September 1995, 18 among the 33 veterinarians submitted samples from at least two herds (range from 2 to 7). Altogether, 218 faecal samples from diarrheic dairy calves in 65 herds were submitted. Herd sizes ranged from 12 to 650 cows (median 49 cows). Sixty-four of the calves included in this study were 1±7 days old, and 57, 68 and 29 calves were 8±14, 15±21 and 22±30 days old, respectively. The median age of the studied calves was 12 days. In the animals studied, Cryptosporidium was the most-commonly detected agent (52.3% of the samples positive) followed by rotavirus (42.7%) ( Table 1) . F5 E. coli was isolated from 12.5%, 10.5%, 14.7% and 6.9% of the calves in the age-groups 1±7, 8±14, 15±21 and 22±30 days, respectively. The two Salmonella spp. isolates were identified as S. typhimurium. Concurrent infection with two agents occurred in 47 calves (21.6%), with three agents in 13 calves (6%) and with four agents in one calf (0.5%) ( Table 1 ). The mixed infection most-commonly found was rotavirus±Cryptosporidium. The sensitivity and specificity of the commercial ELISA for the detection of rotavirus, F5 E. coli and Cryptosporidium, using PAGE, bacterial culture and microscopy as standard reference methods, are shown in Table 2 . All four of the E. coli strains isolated from three of the samples showed autoagglutination activity. Therefore, these three samples were not included in the evaluation of ELISA in comparison with bacterial culture. The ELISA test showed a very low sensitivity (28.6%) for the detection of F5 E. coli (Table 2) .
