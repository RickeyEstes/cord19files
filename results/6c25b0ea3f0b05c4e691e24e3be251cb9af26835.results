The results for the ADF and PP tests are reported in Table 1 . We tested two specifications of the ADF and PP tests. The first specification included a constant only and the second specification included a constant and a time trend. Since the constant and time trend combination was significant in each specification, this appears to be a better fit for the data. On the basis of the modified Akaike information criterion, the maximum lag was selected to be eight. For both the ADF and PP tests and for each of the series the null hypothesis of a unit root cannot be rejected at the 5% level. The results of the Schmidt and Phillips (1992) LM unit root test without a structural break are reported in Table 2 . The results are consistent with those of the ADF and PP unit root tests. The null hypothesis of a unit root cannot be rejected. These results, however, could be biased because of the failure to account for structural change in the data. Tables 3 and 4 in the intercept and trend. We could not reject the unit root null for either model with any of the series. We now turn to examining the location of the break points. It is important to note that estimation of an endogenous break point will not be precise and will not match a particular event date by date (Christiano, 1992; Lee and Strazicich, 2001; Sen, 2003) . Therefore, it is not possible to analyse the speed of the reaction to the news in different markets based on the estimated break points. Moreover, because the breakpoints are determined endogenously, it is possible that the breakpoints will differ across Models A, C, AA and CC. This is consistent with previous studies that have employed either the LM unit root test with structural breaks or ADF-type unit root tests with structural breaks (see Lee & Strazicich, 2003; Lumsdaine & Papell, 1997) . In Model A, each of the break points are statistically significant at the 10% level or better and for seven of the eight series the breakpoint is statistically significant at the 1% level. In Model C, the break in the intercept is not statistically significant, while the break in the trend is statistically significant for Brent spot, 1-month Brent and 6-month WTI at the 10% level or better. Models A and C suggest different break dates. While the breakpoint results may differ across methods we would expect that the break point would be the same for a particular model across the series due to interconnection between spot and futures markets. While the choice of a break point does not coincide within the series, oil prices respond to the same shocks, although with different time lags. For Model A the breakpoint is the same for Brent spot, Brent 1-month and Brent 3-month (8 November 2000) and WTI spot, WTI 1-month and WTI 3-month (7 May 2003). The breakpoint for Brent 6-month and WTI 6-month lag their respective spot prices and shorter maturities by 1-2 months. The breakpoints for Brent spot, Brent 1-month, Brent 3-month and Brent 6-month, follow a period between January 1999 and September 2000 during which oil prices tripled due to a cumulative effect of high world oil demand, OPEC oil production cutbacks, a cold winter in the US and low oil stock levels. The breakpoint for WTI spot, WTI 1-month, WTI 3-month and WTI 6-month coincided with the second Gulf war, a decision by the European Parliament to introduce an emissions trading scheme as well as Hurricane Claudette, which adversely affected Texan oil production in July 2003. In Model C, each of the break points occurred between November 1997 and September 1999. The breaks at the end of 1997 and in 1998 could be a reflection of the Asian financial crisis and consequent reduced demand for oil from Asia. The break in Brent spot, Brent 1-month, WTI spot and WTI 1-month follow several relevant events in 1999. For example, in May 1999, the US adopted a plan to reduce nitrogen oxides (NO x ) emission levels from cars and light-duty trucks, which also required refineries to reduce gasoline sulphur content and which affected standards for refined oil imported to the US. In addition, in June 1999, Sudan started operating a pipeline linking its Heglig oil field to Port Sudan on the Red Sea. The location of these break points also reflected activity of the oil majors on the stock market. For instance, BP announced its plan to finalise a merger with Amoco on 16 and 18 July, Elf Aquitaine attempted a takeover of Total Fina. Tables 5 and 6 present the results for the LM unit root tests with two breaks in the intercept (Model AA) and two breaks in the intercept and trend (Model CC). In both Models AA and CC, the null hypothesis of a unit root with two structural breaks could not be rejected. In Model AA, at least one of the breaks in the intercept is statistically significant. In Model CC, the breaks in the intercept are statistically insignificant, but the breaks in trend are statistically significant. In Model AA, the first break for each of the series except 1-and 6-month Brent and 6-month WTI futures occurred in 2000 and the second break occurred in 2003. The first break in the series could be due to a terrorist attack on the US warship, Cole, in Yemen in October 2000. The second break could be a reaction to the Gulf war in Iraq, which started in March 2003. For 1-month Brent the first break occurred in 2001 and the second break occurred in 2003. This can be seen as a reaction to what occurred in the Brent spot market, where the difference between the second break in the spot market and the first break in the 1-month futures market is 2 weeks. Both breaks could be a reaction to December and January events, which involved problems with the natural gas market in the US. For 6-month Brent, both breaks occurred in 2001 and for 6-month WTI both breaks occurred in 2003. For 3-month Brent only the first break was significant. In Model CC, the first break for each series occurs in 1999 and is associated with the same events as the one-break case, while the second break occurs at the time of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre in New York.
