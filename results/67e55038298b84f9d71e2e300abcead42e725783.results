HA and NA are distributed asymmetrically on the surface of IAV particles We first sought to characterize the organization and dynamics of proteins in the viral membrane. By labeling HA and NA, along with the viral nucleoprotein, NP, we are able to measure features of virus organization on intact, infectious particles that corroborate and extend previous observations made using electron microscopy (Calder et al., 2010; Chlanda et al., 2015; Harris et al., 2006; Leser and Lamb, 2017) . For these experiments, we use a tagged variant of the strain A/WSN/1933 with M1 from A/Udorn/1972, which differs from WSN M1 at six residues and confers filamentous morphology (Elleman and Barclay, 2004) . Consistent with our prior observations, this virus produces filamentous particles that vary widely in size, from sub-diffraction limited spots to particles > 10 mm in length (Vahey and Fletcher, 2019) . In viruses with fluorescently-labeled HA and NA, we observe a pronounced tendency for NA to be enriched at one end of the virus ( Figure 1A , inset). To quantify this enrichment, we measured the relative intensities of HA and NA within~400 nm of each viral pole in filamentous particles > 1 mm in length. Across 20344 such particles, approximately one third have NA intensities at least 5-fold higher on one pole than on the other ( Figure 1A, left) . Similarly, viruses with labeled NP (the most abundant protein in vRNP complexes and a proxy for the virus genome) reveal individual foci that localize to one end of the virus. Aligning filamentous particles with polarized NP foci (4805 in total) reveals a tendency for NA to colocalize with NP ( Figure 1A , right). For the subset of these particles > 4.5 mm in length (540 in total), we created a composite image showing the average densities of viral proteins within 2 mm of each viral pole (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). On average, NA is enriched~2 x relative to HA at the NP-containing pole in these particles, as compared to the middle region of the particle and the opposite pole ( Approximately one third of filamentous particles have NA intensities five-fold higher on one pole than the other, as indicated by the vertical dashed lines (distributions are symmetric in this case because poles are designated randomly). Inset images show a particle Figure 1 continued on next page filamentous particles do not recover fluorescence in either HA or NA over tens of minutes ( Figure 1B) . To investigate the finer details of protein organization and to determine if NA in fluorescent viruses is clustered, as suggested by electron microscopy (Calder et al., 2010; Harris et al., 2006) , we use two-color stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to reconstruct images of HA and NA with resolution~10X better than the diffraction limit (~30 nm compared to~300 nm; Figure 1-figure supplement 2). At this resolution, we find that the tendency of NA to concentrate at one of the viral poles is pronounced even in particles smaller than 300 nm in length ( Figure 1C) . We also find that the NA seen at low levels along the length of filamentous viruses without super-resolution imaging is actually organized into small NA clusters ( Figure 1D ). Additionally, HA and NA distributions in these particles are modestly anti-correlated ( Figure 1E ), suggesting that receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities may be spatially segregated on some regions of the virus. Collectively, these measurements present a picture of a variegated IAV envelope whose spatial organization is stable and coupled to the presence and location of the viral genome, with~70% of NPcontaining viruses having NA biased to the proximal pole. We next investigated whether spatial organization of the IAV envelope could have functional significance for virus binding and detachment. As a first test of this idea, we compared the spatial organization of viruses that were released from the cell surface with those that remained attached after challenging the virus with the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) oseltamivir carboxylate (He et al., 1999) (Materials and methods). To quantify virus spatial organization, we defined HA-NA polarity as the separation between the center of masses for HA and NA divided by the virus length. Interestingly, viruses that escaped the cell surface under NAI challenge showed higher HA-NA polarity (0.155; 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.139-0.171) than viruses released in the absence of NAI challenge, both before (0.123; 95% CI = 0.106-0.140) and after (0.100; 95% CI = 0.090-0.110) facilitating virus release by treating with exogenous sialidase ( Figure 1F & G). In comparison, viruses treated with both NAI and exogenous sialidase have polarities similar to the untreated virus (0.124; 95% CI = 0.111-0.136). These results suggest that viruses with NA concentrated at one of the viral poles may be more effective at navigating environments rich in sialic acid. with NA enrichment of~5.6 fold (~31 st percentile of particles). The plot to the right shows the same comparison for particles aligned to their NP-foci, designated as pole 1 (distributions are determined from a total of 4805 particles with polarized NP distributions). The prevalence of particles with NA ratios > 1 indicates a tendency for NA to be enriched at the virus's genome-containing pole. Inset images show a particle with NA enrichment of~3.3 fold (~48 th percentile of particles based on NA polarity).

(F) To compare populations of virus that are able to detach from infected cell to those that remain bound to the cell surface with or without NAIs, we collect virus in two separate stages: first, we harvest virus from media at 16hpi, followed by the addition of media supplemented with an exogenous, oseltamivir-resistant bacterial neuraminidase. After one hour of treatment with exogenous NA, we harvest virus that had previously remained bound to the cell surface. Polarized viruses step persistently away from their NA-rich pole To directly test how NA polarization might affect virus motion, we characterized interactions between fluorescently-labeled viruses and sialic acid coated coverslips, where the well-defined geometry and density of sialic acid allow straightforward analysis of virus diffusion (Materials and methods) (Figure 2A ). Because our approach to fluorescently labeling NA preserves its activity (Figure 2-figure supplement 1) and viruses harboring fluorophores on both HA and NA preserve~85% of their infectivity (Vahey and Fletcher, 2019) , we could carry out functional assays with the virus and at the same time visualize HA and NA distributions on the viral membrane. Surprisingly, the motion we observed did not resemble randomly-oriented diffusion of the viral particle, but rather persistent, Brownian ratchet-like diffusion, in which filamentous particles with polarized distributions of NA exhibited directed mobility away from their NA-rich pole ( Figure 2B , Video 1). Labeling coverslips with fluorescein-labeled Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL), which binds specifically to the terminal galactose exposed following sialic acid cleavage (Iglesias et al., 1982) , revealed the history of virus trajectories and confirmed that virus motion is accompanied by receptor destruction ( Figure 2B ). Aligning the trajectories of mobile particles (defined as those with diffusion coefficients > 100 nm 2 /s, comprising~68% of the population; Figure 2C ) to the orientation of their HA-NA axis reveals that directional mobility can persist for several microns, many times the length of the particle itself ( Figure 2D ). Consistent with the observation that polarized distributions of HA and NA serve as a determinant for persistent motion and enhanced diffusion, we find that non-mobile viruses have, on average, less polarized distributions of HA and NA than mobile ones ( Figure 2E ). To determine if polarized distributions of NA were necessary for persistent directional mobility, we disrupted the spatial organization of viral surface proteins by removing the cytoplasmic tail of NA (residues 2-6; Figure Figure 3A ), indicating that spatial organization of NA at the poles is necessary for persistent mobility of IAV. Correlations in the direction of successive steps in a random walk will increase the rate at which the walker explores its environment, analogous to how more rigid polymer chains typically have larger end-to-end distances than those with equivalent contour length but lower bending rigidity. To quantitatively compare the rate at which the less persistent NADCT viruses explore their environment to that of the more persistent wildtype virus, we determined mean squared displacements from observed trajectories of mobile viruses (diffusion coefficients > 100 nm 2 /s over the observation period) and simulated random walks in which the number of steps, the size of each step, and the time interval between steps all match the observed data, but the direction of each step is uncorrelated with previous steps ( Figure 3B ). From this analysis, we estimate that the diffusion coefficients of mobile viruses are enhanced approximately five-fold as a result of directional correlations ( Figure 3B , left). In contrast, the diffusion of mobile NADCT viruses is only modestly influenced by directional correlations (~1.5 fold increase; Figure 3B , right). To further quantify the difference between viruses with wildtype NA and NADCT, we tracked the displacement of particles between subsequent frames acquired 30 s apart and plotted the distribution of the stepping angle relative to the orientation of the virus's HA-NA axis. Viruses with wildtype NA step in the direction of increasing HA (with the NA pole at the rear) roughly twice as frequently as the opposite direction, while NADCT viruses exhibit no correlation between orientation and stepping direction ( Figure 3C ). Additionally, despite having lower amounts of NA in the viral membrane, NADCT viruses left significantly larger trails of cleaved receptors than their wildtype counterparts ( results demonstrate that the spatial organization and mobility of NA on the viral surface both play an important role in determining where and when it cleaves substrate. Computational modeling suggests a mechanism for persistent directional mobility To investigate the mechanism of this persistent directional mobility, we modeled the diffusion of filamentous viruses with defined spatial organization of HA and NA as the viruses bind to sialic acid on a two-dimensional surface (Appendix, Figure 3 -figure supplement 4). In this model, virus diffusion is constrained by the tens of attachments the HAs form with sialic acid at any instant in time (English and Hammer, 2004; Xu and Shaw, 2016) . At the interface between HA-rich and NA-rich regions of the viral membrane, like those seen in fluorescence images ( Figure 1A -D), NA will periodically gain access to, and hydrolyze, sialic acid as the position of the virus thermally fluctuates. The binding partners available to HAs located close to this interface will therefore be asymmetrically distributed, with more potential binding partners located further away from areas of higher NA density. This concept is illustrated most clearly in the case where the virus is constrained to a one-dimensional path. As this case illustrates, the sialic acid density along the length of the virus is lowest in close proximity to NA (Figure 3-figure supplement 5A-C). When NA is confined to a single pole, this results in a gradient in sialic acid density along the length of the particle. Since the number of available binding partners is higher in one direction than another, newly-formed HA-sialic acid bonds will tend to be offset from previous bonds in this direction. This leads to the persistent motion we observe experimentally as well as in our simulations (Video 2). Consistent with this mechanism, persistent motion of the virus is lost when NA is no longer localized to a single virus pole and the sialic acid distribution beneath the particle becomes symmetric (Figure 3-figure supplement 5B-D). We note that virions with symmetric distributions of NA also occur in the virus population and would not be expected to exhibit persistent motion (for example, those particles with NA polar ratios of~1 in Figure 1A ). Since virus motion is dependent on the virus's ability to establish distinct regions with and without sialic acid, we expect that dynamic distributions of either NA or sialic acid will alter virus mobility. Consistent with our experimental observations with the NADCT virus, allowing NA to freely diffuse eliminates directional bias in virus motion in both experiments ( Figure 3C ) and simulations ( Figure 3D ). However, allowing surface-bound sialic acid to diffuse can either enhance or suppress directed motion, depending on the kinetic parameters of HA and NA, the diffusion coefficient of sialic acid (D SA ), and the size of the virus (Appendix). Although our experimental data corresponds to the case where sialic acid is immobilized (D SA~0 ), our simulations predict that polarized IAV bound to slowly-diffusing transmembrane glycoproteins or gel-forming mucins (D SA <0.01 mm 2 /s) will exhibit enhanced directed mobility, likely due to the biased spatial distributions of sialic acid binding partners that are available to HAs distal to the virus's NA-rich pole. In contrast, increasing the rate of sialic acid diffusion further (D SA >0.01 mm 2 /s) is expected to suppress persistent motion, by flattening the sialic acid gradient that is created beneath the virus ( Figure 3E, Video 3) . Finally, we find that increasing the length of the virus in simulations increases the number of HA-sialic acid interactions, reducing virus mobility but increasing directional persistence (Figure 3-figure supplement 6). Thus, the organization of proteins on the viral surface, the size of the virus, and the nature of the receptor to which the virus is bound can each influence the persistence of a virus's motion. Although our results focus on a two-dimensional geometry in which a virus adheres to a flat surface decorated with sialic acid (a model for the cell surface), we reasoned that they should generalize to three-dimensional systems, such as the secreted mucus gel through which IAV must penetrate to reach naïve cells to infect. To test this prediction, we cultured Calu-3 cells at an air-liquid interface, resulting in a~1-10 mm thick gel of secreted mucus overlaying the apical surface of the cells ( Figure 4A ). Adding virus with labeled HA and NA to the mucus, followed by fixation and labeling with ECL, revealed tracks similar to those we observed on two-dimensional surfaces ( Figure 4B ). This suggests that the asymmetry of NA and HA biases the direction of virus diffusion in three dimensions, producing trails of cleaved sialic acid that can reach several microns in length as the virus moves ( Figure 4C ). This directional mobility is less prevalent in viruses with more uniformly distributed NA, though they nonetheless are capable of creating swaths of ECL-staining within the mucus that lack clear directionality ( Figure 4D ). Similar to our observations on idealized two-dimensional surfaces ( Figure 3C ), we find that viruses in mucus exhibit a slight tendency to align their HA-NA axis (captured at the moment of fixation) with the displacement of the virus relative to the center of ECL labeling ( Figure 4E) . These results suggest that the spatial organization of HA and NA on the virus surface may also promote penetration of polarized IAV particles through mucus barriers in vivo.
