First, we examined the effect of CAM on RSV replication in A549 cells. RSV infection to A549 cells was performed at MOI of 1. After 24 and 36 h of infection, significant alterations of the RSV titers or expression levels of G mRNA were not observed by the addition of CAM even at a concentration of 100 μg/mL (Figure 1 ). When A549 cells were infected with RSV at MOI of 1, RANTES, IL-8, and IL-6 were markedly induced. These cytokine inductions were significantly suppressed in the presence of CAM in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 ). The degree of suppression by CAM was less than that by an NF-κB inhibitor, PDTC. PAF receptor expression on the cell surface is upregulated during RSV infection in A549 cells [26] . The RSV-induced upregulation of the PAF receptor was significantly suppressed by CAM and PDTC in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3 ). The degree of suppression by CAM was slightly less than that by PDTC. Suppression of the PAF receptor expression was also observed when A549 cells were posttreated with CAM (4 or 12 h after RSV infection) (data not shown). We examined the adhesion of FITC-labeled S. pneumoniae cells to A549 cells by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 4 ) and flow cytometry ( Figure 5 ). RSV infection significantly enhanced the adhesion of S. pneumoniae to A549 cells, and this enhancement was suppressed by adding a PAF receptor antagonist (Figures 4 and 5) or anti-PAF receptor monoclonal antibody (data not shown). This result indicated that the RSV-induced S. pneumoniae adhesion occurs via the PAF receptor on A549 cells. The bacterial adhesion was significantly suppressed by CAM, as well as PDTC.
