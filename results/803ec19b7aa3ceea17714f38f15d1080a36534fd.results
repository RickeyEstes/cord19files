Nineteen distinct alleles were identified amongst the 33 cats. Table 1 shows the distribution of these alleles amongst 25 cats with the four FCoV phenotypes described in this study. Considerable variation in the alleles was present in cats from different breeds (data not presented) which, together with the small numbers, made any more detailed analysis difficult. However, there appeared to be no clear association between FLA-DRB genotype and FCoV phenotype. The number of alleles in individual cats ranged from two to six. Whilst there was a greater number of alleles in the cats that developed FIP compared to the other groups (Table 1 ) this was not statistically significantly different (chi-squared, P=0.8) and may have reflected differences in the proportion of different breeds present in each group. Indeed, Burmese cats appeared to contain fewer alleles than other represented breeds (Table  2 ) and were over-represented in the transiently infected and carrier groups.
