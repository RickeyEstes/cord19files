The effect of Q7R on PEDV-induced CPE After 2 day infections of Vero cells with PEDV, Mock cells ( Figure 1A ) or cells treated with 10 Î¼g/ml Q7R ( Figure 1C ) or ribavirin ( Figure 1B) showed typical spread-out shapes and normal morphology. At this concentration, no signs of cytotoxicity of Q7R were observed. Infection with PEDV in the absence of Q7R resulted in a severe CPE ( Figure 1D ). Addition of Q7R on infected Vero cells inhibited the formation of a visible CPE ( Figure 1F ). However, the addition of ribavirin in PEDV-infected Vero cell was impossible to prevent CPE ( Figure 1E) . Thus, the CPE of the virus infection is prevented by the presence of Q7R.
