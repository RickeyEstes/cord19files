Characterization of RNA-binding activity of wild-type and mutant nucleoproteins from H1N1. The crystal structure of NP revealed that the RNA-binding groove was located between the head and body domains on the exterior surface of the NP oligomers, which is exposed and highly accessible. To examine the effects of conserved positively charged residues and the Y148 residue in the RNA-binding groove of NP, the amino acid residues Y148, R150, R152, R156, R174, R175, K184, R195, R199, R213, R214, R221, and R236 were respectively replaced with alanine ( Fig. 1 ). Each form of NP was expressed and purified. Subsequently, SPR analysis was employed to determine the interactions between the full-length NPs and RNA. The repeated intergenic sequence of influenza virus, 5′ -bio(UCCAAAC) 4 -3′ , was used as a probe in the SPR experiments. The dissociation constants, K D (k d /k a ), for the various NP and RNA complexes were obtained from kinetic analyses of SPR experiments (Fig. 2 ). The k a values for RNA binding to R214A and R236A were similar to that for WT, whereas Y148A, R150A, R152A, R156A, R174A, R175A, K184A, R195A, R199A, R213A, and R221A had smaller k a values than that of WT, suggesting these NP residues are likely important for RNA recognition and interaction. The k d values for RNA binding to all mutants were larger than that of WT, and the Y148A mutant had the largest k d value (5 fold that of WT), indicating the side chain of Y148 increase RNA residence times in NP (Table 1 ). In addition to K184A, R214A, and R236A, the dissociation constants for RNA binding to Y148A, R150A, R152A, R156A, R174A, R175A, R195A, R199A, R213A, and R221A ranged from 4.5 × 10 -8 M to 15 × 10 -8 M and were much larger than those for WT ( Fig. 2A) , implying that these residues contribute more to RNA binding. Previously, Li et al. reported that influenza A virus with NP mutations in Y148, R150, R152, R156, R174, R175, R195, R199, R213, and R221 were significantly attenuated 16 . These biological properties of mutant viruses corroborate our observations at the biochemical level. One conserved amino acid, Y148, at the end of the RNA-binding groove of the NP was identified as an indispensable residue affecting the RNA binding 18 . To explore the role of Y148 in the interactions between H1N1-NP and RNA, the Y148 residue in the full-length NP was replaced by amino acids with various characteristics (e.g., F, R, S, and A) via site-directed mutagenesis. SPR analyses were then performed to measure the binding affinities between RNA and the purified H1N1-NP (WT and five mutants). Traces from the SPR experiments show the binding capacity of RNA to the WT and mutant NPs. Comparison of the binding capacities of these proteins (Fig. 3A) showed that the binding capacity was decreased in the following order: WT > Y148F > Y148S ~ Y148R > Y148A. These results emphasize the importance of the involvement of Y148 in stacking interactions between the NP and RNA. The kinetic association and dissociation constants were obtained from analyses of the SPR sensorgrams and the results are listed in Table 1 . As shown in Fig. 3B , the k a values followed the order WT > Y148R > Y148F ~ Y148S > Y148A, with the k a of Y148A smaller than that of the WT by 40.4%. On the other hand, the k d values increased in the following order: Y148A > Y148S Y148F > Y148R > WT (Fig. 3C) with the k d of Y148A being 4.8 fold larger than that of WT. Taken together, the K D values for the H1N1 WT and five mutant NPs decreased in the following order: Y148A > Y148S > Y148F > Y148R > WT (Fig. 3D) , implying that the positive charge of Y148R was also involved in the interaction between the NP and RNA. Circular dichroism spectral analysis of the thermal stability of WT and mutant nucleoproteins. The conformation of H1N1 WT and mutant NPs including Y148F, Y148S, Y148R, and Y148A with and without RNA were monitored using CD spectroscopy. As shown in Figure S2 , the CD spectra of these proteins were scanned from 190 to 250 nm at 25 °C. The CD spectra of H1N1 WT and mutant NPs showed similar well-structured domains with α -helical and β -sheet secondary structures as well as two negative peaks at approximately 205 and 220 nm. Upon addition of RNA, the CD spectra of H1N1 WT and mutant NPs also showed similar intensities at approximately 205 and 220 nm, suggesting that they possessed a similar secondary structure composition upon RNA binding, as compared to H1N1 WT and mutant NPs without RNA. To examine the thermodynamic stabilities of H1N1 WT and mutant NPs including Y148F, Y148S, Y148R, and Y148A, we measured the melting temperatures (T m ) of the purified WT and mutant NPs using CD in which the absorbance at 220 nm was analyzed as a function of temperature (Fig. 4A,B) . The WT NP showed a thermal denaturation midpoint at 73.5 °C as determined by CD (Table 2) . However, as temperature increases, the mutant NPs unfold more rapidly than the WT NP does, as evidenced by a lower T m of approximately 0.7 to 6.2 °C (from 67.3-72.8 °C), indicating that Y148 contributes significantly to the structural stability of the NP. Compared to WT and other mutant NPs, Y148F had a lowest T m value. The results indicate that deletion of the tyrosine hydroxyl would significantly reduce the stability of NP, suggesting tyrosine hydroxyl is required for proper NP folding. We also characterized the stabilizing and structural effects of NP bound to RNA by CD melting analysis (Fig. 4B ). The WT NP-RNA complex showed a higher T m value (78 °C) than other mutant NP-RNA complexes ( Table 2 ). The T m values of the WT and Y148F NPs increased by 3.9 and 3.8 °C, respectively, upon the addition of RNA (Table 2) suggesting that a benzyl side chain has an important effect on the stability of the NP-RNA complex. However, the difference was reduced to 2.5, 1.2 and 2.2 °C for Y148R, Y148S, and Y148 A, respectively, upon addition of RNA. According to previous studies 19 , WT RNP complexes extracted from influenza virus were melt around 63 °C in replicate experiments, compared to 56 °C for protein heated in isolation. Consistent with the early study, our finding show that RNA binding enhance the stability of NP within 10 °C and our result would be meaningful. Molecular docking studies to identify compounds that target Y148 of H1N1 nucleoprotein. Previous studies have reported that the tyrosine residue in nucleocapsid protein is an attractive target for novel antiviral drug development 20, 21 . Thus, a virtual screening was performed to target the Y148 of NP. To identify compounds that might interact with the RNA-binding site of NP at Y148, we used the LIBDOCK docking program to evaluate the candidate ligands binding to NP. In the current study, the potential hits with docking scores over 90 were analyzed based on their docking results. We selected seven candidate ligands with high scores (H1 to H7) for the functional assay based on the energy calculated by molecular docking (Table S1 ). They all contain an aromatic core to stack onto Y148 of the NP. In addition, the aromatic core contains hydrogen bondforming moieties to mediate the specific interactions with the NP. More importantly, among the 40 potential hits, these seven compounds were readily available. Because our result reported that Y148 is important for NP stability and folding, the top hits were assayed in an in vitro drug-induced fluorescence change experiment. The purified recombinant NP was treated with top hits from the in-house compound collection, then the change of tryptophan fluorescence caused by the compound was used to reflect the NP-drug interaction 22 . The four compounds that significantly decreased the NP fluorescence by more than 10% were selected for further characterization (Fig. 5A) . NP possesses multiple RNA binding sites. Compound that targets Y148 in the local area can't inhibit the binding affinity between RNA and NP absolutely. Due to this reason, we determined the binding affinity in the presence of compounds under saturation conditions at protein: compound ratio of 1:20. We further studied the effects of the four compounds (H1, H3, H5, and H7) on the RNA-binding capacity of NP by SPR experiments. Only H7 decreased the RNA-binding capacity of NP by more than 10% (Fig. 5B ). We also evaluated the kinetic association (k a ) and dissociation constants (k d ), respectively, and the dissociation rate constant (K D ) to determine the effects of these four compounds on the RNA-binding affinity toward NP. In the presence of compounds under saturation conditions, the affinity of NP bound to RNA (Fig. 6A ) for H7 (K D = 19.3 nM) was higher than those for the other compounds. The NP exhibited weaker RNA binding in the presence of H7, with a 2-fold increase in the dissociation constant. The K D values for H1, H3, and H5 were 10.4, 9.7, and 11.7 nM, respectively, which are at the same level as the K D without drug (Table 3 ). Figure 5A shows that the NP fluorescence decreased with increasing H7 concentration, suggesting that this decrease reflected the interaction of NP molecules with H7; this result was derived by a Hill plot analysis. Assuming that the amount of quenched fluorescence corresponds to the fraction of NP bound to H7, fitting of the binding curve ( Fig. 6B ) resulted in an unambiguous 1:1 stoichiometry for the interaction between H7 and NP with a K d of 1.22 × 10 -6 M. Based on the docking results of NP bound to H7, the methoxyphenyl on the H7 participates in stacking interactions with the Tyr148 side chains. Hydrogen bonds were also formed between R150 and H7 (Fig. 6C) . We have analyzed the proposed interactions using in Y148 and R150 mutants. However, we observed that there is relatively low FL change in Y148 and R150 mutants upon addition of H7 by fluorescence titration assay, compared to the wild type, suggesting that H7 inhibits the RNA-binding activity of NP by directly interacting with Y148 and R150 ( Figure S3 ).
