The CHP news articles data and rate of visits for hospitals for ILI data collected for a total of 753 weeks from the 32nd week of 2003 to the 10th week of 2018 were used in this research. The data over the 240-week period from the 32nd week of 2013 to the 10th week of 2018 were used for the validation set. The 240 weeks are divided into 20 different groups of 12 weeks in order to see if it is available to predict the quarter of a year ahead, even if the ILI patient ratio data does not exist. Figure 7 shows that while the experiment progresses, the training set increases. For example, if the third section from the 5th week of 2014 to the 16th week of 2014 out of the 12 sections was to be predicted, then the data until the 4th week of 2014 would be used to train the model. SVM was used to predict patient variation, and the RBF kernel, which showed the best performance, was applied. For parameter setting, the C and γ that gave the best prediction performance were identified from the combinations of {γ, c} ∈ {10 −9 , 10 −8 , 10 −7 , 10 −6 , 10 −5 , 10 −4 , 10 −3 , 10 −2 , 10 −1 , 1, 10, 10 3 } × {10 −2 , 10 −1 , 1, 10, 10 3 , 10 4 , 10 5 , 10 6 , 10 7 , 10 8 , 10 9 , 10 10 }. Grid search was performed for every section, and the best parameter combinations found through grid search were used for each prediction. The performance of the prediction of whether the number of ILI patients would increase or decrease was measured by accuracy, and the estimation of the rate of visits for hospitals for ILI was measured by root mean square error (RMSE). Accuracy represents how many correct answers have been made in the total cases, and can be presented as Eq. (4), where T p is true positive, T n is true negative, F p is false positive, and F n is false negative. RMSE is a commonly used measure for the difference between the estimated value and the value observed in the actual environment, and can be expressed as Eq. (5). The results of the experiment are based on estimates of the expected accuracy of the predictions of whether a patient's hospital visit rate due to ILI would increase or decrease as well as the actual value of rate of visits of hospitals for ILI. Figure 8 shows the prediction results for variations in patients from the 32nd week of 2013 to Table 3 shows the confusion matrix. Figure 9 shows the accuracy of prediction. The average accuracy for 12 different sections was 0.867 when using all data and 0.871 when using data from Northern Hemisphere countries only, while the minimum was 0.75 and the maximum was 1.0. In Table 4 , the accuracy and RMSE of each section and its average are presented. While the accuracy was under 0.8 in the three sections of 2014.28-2014.39, 2016.43-2017.2, and 2017.27-2017.38, the rate of visits of hospitals for ILI was between (0.7 and 1.2), which was not a sharply increasing or decreasing section for the results which used all data. However, every section, except for one section where the rate of patients increased or decreased dramatically, showed more than 0.8 prediction accuracy. The accuracy was slightly higher when using data from Northern Hemisphere countries only than when all data was used. Cases where the patient number increased are assigned the label '+ 1' while those where it decreased are assigned the label '-1' , and in order to discover when the peak of the number of patients would be with the predicted results, the predicted labels of 240 weeks included in 20 sections are accumulated, as shown in Fig. 10 . In the figure, the black dotted line represents the actual rate of hospital visits for ILI, and it uses the right-hand y-axis. The blue, orange, and green lines respectively represent the actual cumulative value of labels, the predicted cumulative value of labels when all data are used, and the predicted cumulative value of labels when only data from Northern Hemisphere countries are used, using the left-hand y-axis of the graph. As shown in red dotted lines in Fig. 10 , it allows for the identification of when the peak rate of hospital visits for ILI would be, using the predicted labels. Using the predicted results and weighting index in Table  2 , the rate of hospital visits for ILI is estimated as shown in Fig. 12 . As described in Fig. 3 , the weighting index was applied to every week where the section starts, using the rate of the previous week, and estimating the rates of 12 weeks. The average RMSE for 20 sections was 0.611 with a minimum of 0.056 and maximum of 2.574 when all data was used, while the average RMSE was 0.396 with a minimum of 0.102 and maximum of 1.163 when only data from Northern Hemisphere countries was used, and the overall error changes throughout the predicted period are shown in Fig. 11 . In Fig. 11 , the five-day moving average of ILI patient ratio is plotted against the five-day moving average of error between the actual ILI patient ratio and predicted ILI patient ratio. As shown in Fig. 11 , out of the 20 divided sections, the second, sixth, seventh, 11th, 12th, 15th, 16th, and 20th sections include the ILI patient ratio peak week of each year. The average RMSEs of these in season sections were 0.991 and 0.563, which could be considered reasonable, even when ILI activity is near maximal as the error was less than 1%. In Fig. 12 , the blue line represents the actual rate, while the orange and green lines represent the rates estimated using the weighting index and predicted label, respectively. The results of applying the weighting index to the predicted label follow the same overall trend as the actual value, but quickly increase the estimated ILI patient ratio value by over weighting the value where the value of the graph is increasing rapidly.
