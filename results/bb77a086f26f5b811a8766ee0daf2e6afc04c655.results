Forty-five subjects took part in one or other of two double-blind,' placebocontrolled tolerance studies conducted by the Nova Pharmaceutical Corporation (unpublished data). Medication consisted of 36 doses of 0.4 ml of NPC 567 (2.5 mg/ml) or placebo intranasally over six days and both were well tolerated. A further 10 volunteers took part in a similar tolerance study of 30 doses of medication at the CCU. One volunteer (placebo) was withdrawn from the study because of epistaxis. The total clinical score of each of the remaining subjects was nil (unpublished data). During the course of six trials 80 volunteers were allotted to the efficacy study. Females were included only in the last two trials after regulatory permission was received and numbered 22. Six subjects were excluded, two because of wild colds, two as contacts of wild colds, one because of abnormal biochemical test results and one withdrew for domestic reasons. Of the remaining 74 volunteers, 22 were diagnosed as suffering a cold at the requisite time and were given medication; l 1 received NPC 567 and 11 placebo. The two groups were well balanced for sex and age (see Table 1 ). Three of the 11 colds in the drug group were classed as moderate and the remaining eight as mild compared with all 11 colds in the placebo group being graded as mild. The mean total clinical score and mean total nasal secretion weight of the drug group were 29.86 + 20.25 and 37.07 + 45.70 g respectively compared with 19.86 + 11.86 and 19.54 + 25.60 g in the placebo group. These differences do not reach statistical significance at the P=0.05 level. There was no evidence of an effect when men and infertile females were analysed separately (data not shown). A more accurate appraisal of the effect of NPC 567 on the course of a rhinovirus cold is obtained by comparing the mean daily clinical score and the mean daily nasal secretion weight of the two groups from the onset of the colds (see figure) . The mean daily clinical score and mean daily nasal secretion weight were very similar in the two groups on the first day but thereafter the values for the drug group were always greater than those of the placebo group; this was most marked for the mean daily nasal secretion weight but the only difference to reach statistical significance was that for nasal secretion on day 6 (0.05>P>0.01). These two parameters are not entirely independent as the number of tissues used, which reflects the amount of nasal secretion, contributes significantly to the clinical score. If the mean daily clinical scores are re-calculated excluding the values attributable to the tissue count (i.e. an evaluation of the cold symptoms other than a runny nose) then the patterns of the two groups becomes much closer and, indeed, are reversed on day 6 (see figure) . In the volunteers' analogue assessment of their own colds change s of + 5 mm or less were ignored. A change in the severity of their colds and symptoms was recorded in 76 of 188 (40.4%) assessments made by NPC 567 recipients compared with 78 of 193 (40.4%) assessments made by those given placebo. In the drug group improvement was recorded in 51 (67%) instances and an increase in severity in 25 (33%). The corresponding figures for the placebo group were 61 (78%) and 17 (22%) respectively. Changes in excess of + 25 mm indicating a substantial change in severity, occurred in 4 of the 188 (2%) assessments in the NPC 567 group and in 3 of these the symptoms were considered to have increased in severity. Such changes were more common in the placebo group with 21 instances among the 193 (11%) assessments and all but one signified a beneficial effect. There is little evidence that NPC 567 produced a consistent short term effect in any volunteer, often an improvement on one day being counterbalanced by deterioration on another. Placebo had a more consistent effect and was generally beneficial. However, it is interesting to note that 13 of the 21 substantial changes occurring among placebo recipients were reported by just two subjects and probably relates more to the personality of the volunteer than the medication. Similarly these data fail to support the hypothesis that it is important at which stage of a cold the medication is given. The variation in haematological and biochemical values obtained before and after medication was similar in the drug and placebo recipients.
