During the study period 2,321 patients were admitted to the ICU; 1,231 (53%) required MV, with 1,399 episodes of MV and 10,342 ventilator days. There were 115 VAEs, of which 82 were VACs, 15 IVACs, and 18 PVAPs (Table 1, Fig 2) . The overall ICU mortality rate was 13.3% compared with 28.7% for those with development of a VAE (P = .0001). The ICU mortality rate for mechanically ventilated patients decreased from 32.8% to 19.1% (P = .045), whereas the mortality rate associated with VAEs decreased from 33.3% to 8.3% (P = .37) over the study period (Fig 3) . There were significant increases in MV days and ICU LOS for patients with VAEs ( Table 1) . The mean care bundle compliance for all the elements was 82.8%. The compliance rates for endotracheal intubation with subglottic suctioning, HOB elevation 30°, daily SATs, and SBTs were 79.7%, 98.6%, 76.95%, and 72.2%, respectively. The greatest improvement was seen in SATs, which increased from 51.5% in November 2015 to 76.9% in October 2016 (25.49% absolute increase, P = .0008). This was followed by SBTs, which increased from 54.2% to 72.2% (18% absolute increase, P = .02). The compliance of endotracheal intubation with subglottic suctioning decreased by 16.8% (P = .0006), whereas for HOB it remained around 99% throughout the project (Fig 4) . The target RASS was achieved in 52.8% of mechanically ventilated patients, whereas 40.6% had a RASS of ¡1 to +1. However, 90.5% of patients had their SBT done off sedation, and the percentage of mechanically ventilated patients without sedation increased from 36.1% to 50.9% (P = .06). The delirium assessment compliance rate was 97.3%, with 82.8% reporting a negative CAM-ICU. The percentage of incorrectly reported CAM-ICU scores was 38.3%, which significantly decreased from 67.5% (November 2015) to 10.7% (October 2016) (P = .0001). The PT and occupational therapy participation rates were 60.8% and 26.4%, respectively. Only 1.8% of mechanically ventilated patients were moved from bed to chair. The most frequent level of mobility achieved was 0 (passively rolled or exercised [83.2%]). The other levels were 1 (transfer from bed to chair without standing . The most common perceived barriers to mobilization were the following: patient weakness (20%), hemodynamic instability (18.6%), low RASS on sedation (15.6%), low RASS off sedation (11%), and the patient labeled comfort care (9.5%). However, the most documented adverse event was circulatory or respiratory instability (22.7%).
