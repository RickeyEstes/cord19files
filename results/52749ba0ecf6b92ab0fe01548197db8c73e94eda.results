The final cohort included 174 cases (mean age 57.5 ± 15.0 years, 54.6% male). Cultures were positive in 46.0% of cases, with viruses identified in 22.4% of patients. We noted bacterial pathogens in 23.6% of subjects. Crude hospital mortality was 15% and did not correlate with the type of pathogen causing the infection. The most common viral organisms were rhinovirus (n ¼ 19), influenza (n ¼ 7), parainfluenza (n ¼ 6), coronavirus (n ¼ 5), and metapneumovirus and rhinovirus (n ¼ 4 for each). The most frequent bacterial pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (n ¼ 17) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n ¼ 9). Although influenza arose most often during the traditional influenza season in North America, there was no seasonality seen in the distribution of other viral organisms. As Table 1 reveals, there were few differences between those for whom cultures were negative and patients with either viral or bacterial etiologies. Patients with viruses were more likely to have been cared for in an ICU in the week prior to NVHAP onset, but this difference only approached statistical significance. CAD was less prevalent in patients with viral infections. For other variables such as the Charlson score and the LOS prior to NVHAP there were no significant differences among subjects as a function of the results of their respiratory cultures. Table 2 shows the results of bivariate comparisons between those with positive viral findings and others with NVHAP. As with the general comparisons across the three strata of possible culture results, there were few differences. Again, CAD was less prevalent in those with a viral etiology for NVHAP. Neither the distribution of other co-morbidities nor the Charlson score varied based on culture findings. There also was no difference based on whether the patient had undergone surgery while hospitalized or had required ICU care prior to pneumonia diagnosis. Those with a virus identified as responsible for their infection were hospitalized longer than those without such an etiology (6.0 days vs 4.5 days), but this difference only approached statistical significance. However, persons with a viral NVHAP were twice as likely to have required a prolonged hospitalization (eg > 10 days) before NVHAP development (41.0% vs 20.7%, p ¼ 0.020). There were no differences in outcomes (eg, hospital mortality, LOS after NVHAP, 30-day readmission) based on whether a virus was or was not recovered. Only two variables were independently associated with isolation of a virus based on logistic regression. Persons with a history of CAD were approximately 5 times more likely to have a viral etiology, (AOR 5.16, 95% CI: 1.14e22.44, p ¼ 0.003). Although CAD occurred infrequently among those with viral pathogens, this variable remained associated with viral infection as many other variables entered into the model were co-linear with each other and so CAD became significant as part of the step-wise elimination process. Additionally, a LOS of greater than 10 days prior to NVHAP diagnosis correlated with the recovery of a virus (AOR 2.97, 95% CI: 1.35e6.51). The final model had a good fit based on a HL p value of 0.30. As a screening test for the isolation of a virus in NVHAP, neither of the above factors, nor their combination, had good sensitivity or specificity at predicting the eventual results of cultures.
