After removal of sequencing controls and those with less than 2000 reads, a total of 201 samples were taken forward for analysis, see Table 1 (further information in S1 Table) . This included 109 samples from children with acute wheeze (Fig 1) and paired stable follow-up samples from 17 of these children. Control samples from 75 children without symptoms of wheeze were collected, this cohort included children from day-care and siblings of those with acute wheeze (Fig 1) . Table 1 . Demographic table of acute cases and healthy controls. Data indicates counts for cases (acute wheeze diagnosis) and healthy controls. N indicates the total number of subjects that information was obtained for each group. Count data is indicted as a count (% positive of N). Continuous data is recorded at median of N (mixmax). Differences in clinical variables were calculated using Wilcoxon sign rank test, differences in ethnic groups, sampling season an RV type were calculated using Chisquared.
