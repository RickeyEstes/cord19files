The largest representation came from the 45-54 year old group. There were more male than female physicians outside the major cities (Table 1) . Males had a higher response rate in all regions. To examine the representativeness of the survey respondents, the gender distribution by region of primary practice of those responding was compared to the gender distribution obtained from the list of family physicians from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta using a two-sample proportion test. There were no statistically significant differences in gender distribution. Age group distribution and country of primary medical education were also compared; the only statistically significant difference was found in the higher proportion of North American trained rural physicians among the respondents (56.6%) compared to the provincial distribution (Table 1) . We asked physicians about their concern regarding infection by pandemic H1N1. More than half of the survey participants (64%) were worried or very worried about being infected by H1N1 due to the nature of their occupation, while 36% were not worried. Most respondents (77%) also indicated that they were worried or very worried about bringing an infection home to their family, 23% were not worried. Thirty-four percent of Calgary physicians indicated their work had already been affected by H1N1, while fewer physicians from Edmonton (17%), other urban (14%) and rural (11%) reported that they were affected by the first wave of H1N1 (Chi-squared (3df) = 10.99; p = 0.012). In response to an open-ended question about how they were affected, several physicians commented on increased hand-washing due to concerns about infection, and working longer due to increased service demand.
