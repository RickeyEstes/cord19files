Up to 376 traps were set in site 1 and up to 325 in site 2, although the number of traps set varied throughout the study due to field constraints. Trap effort on site 2 was reduced after the fifth day due to low trapping success. Human and material resources were then reallocated to site 1 (S2 Table) . A total of 86 rats, all R. norvegicus, were caught in the Chanteraines park (Fig  1) , including 49 (57%) males (one animal with missing data on sex). The number of rats trapped on site 1 was 80, 6 on site 2 (Fig 1) . Results per site and sex are summarized in S1 Table. The trap effort during daylight hours was 3,287 and 1,243.5 trap-days in site 1 and 2, respectively. At night time, the trap effort was 3,802 and 1,679 trap-nights in site 1 and 2, respectively. In both sites the trap success was higher during day time (1.58 and 0.32 rats per 100 trap-days in site 1 and 2, respectively) than at night (0.74 and 0.06 rats per 100 trap-nights on site 1 and 2, respectively) (S2 Table) .
