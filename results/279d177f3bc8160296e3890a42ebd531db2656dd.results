Once the data sets were merged, full data were available on 123 NHs. The variables describing the independent and dependent variables are shown in Table 1 . In general, NHs in the sample are representative of NHs in Maryland. That is, no significant differences between this sample and organizational characteristics from all NHs in MD were identified. The results of the regression analyses are displayed in Table 2 . All of the control variables listed in Table 2 were included in each regression model (results for all variables in the models are available from the authors). Eight models were used, examining the following: pressure ulcers (high risk and postacute), indwelling urinary catheter, urinary tract infections, pneumococcal vaccination (short-stay and long-stay residents), and influenza vaccination provided (short-stay and long-stay residents). In the cross-sectional analyses, shown in row 1, three of the 8 quality measures were significantly associated with the FTE of an IP. In other words, for every unit increase in the FTE of an IP, there is a À7.54, À8.97, and À6.14 unit significant decrease in the predicted scores of pressure ulcers, and long-stay and short-stay influenza vaccinations, respectively. This would seem to support the hypothesis that NHs with greater FTEs of an IP are associated with higher quality in terms of influenza vaccination (both short-and long-stay residents) and preventing pressure ulcers in high-risk residents. In the second set of analyses of interest (shown in row 2 of Table 2 ), none of the quality measures were shown to be significant with IPs who received training on infection control prevention and management compared with those who did not. This would seem to show that care outcomes are based on factors other than providing specialized training of infection prevention and management. Thus, there is no support for the hypothesis that NHs with IPs who received training on infection control prevention and management are associated with higher NH minimum data set (MDS) quality measures.
