As an initial feasibility test for the validity of screening sea urchin egg homogenate to discover leads with mammalian activities, we took advantage of our existing compound dataset resulting from the MERS pseudovirus bioassay [25] . A set of compounds, known to display various degrees of attenuation of MERS pseudovirus infectivity, were screened for inhibition of Ca 2+ release in the sea urchin egg homogenate system. A typical experiment is shown in Fig. 1A , which resolves Ca 2+ release kinetics evoked by NAADP, or cADPR or IP 3 in the absence and presence of fangchinoline. Fangchinoline, an inhibitor of NAADPevoked Ca 2+ signals and MERS pseudovirus translocation in a human cell line [25] , decreased the magnitude of NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ release (peak amplitude 47 ± 2% of control response, blue traces in Fig. 1A ) with lesser effects on the size of IP 3 or cADPR-evoked Ca 2+ transients (Fig. 1A) . Ca 2+ release assays were performed for ∼20 other ligands shown to be inhibitors in the MERS pseudovirus translocation assay, and then the impact of these ligands on Ca 2+ signals evoked by NAADP-, cADPR-and IP 3 were correlated with effects in the viral assay (Fig. 1B) . Inspection of regression plots from each dataset revealed that compounds that inhibited NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ release were associated with blockade of MERS pseudovirus translocation, with more effective NAADP inhibitors causing greater decreases in infectivity (Fig. 1B) . No positive correlation was seen for the identical set of compounds between modulation of either cADPR or IP 3 -evoked signals and MERS pseudovirus translocation (Fig. 1B) . Overall, these data establish that identification of pharmacological inhibitors of NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ signals in the sea urchin system has potential utility for discovering modulators of NAADP dependent processes in human cells, such as MERS pseudovirus translocation [25] . This provides rationale for a broader screening campaign against sea urchin egg homogenate to discover novel modulators of NAADP-evoked Ca 2+ release.
