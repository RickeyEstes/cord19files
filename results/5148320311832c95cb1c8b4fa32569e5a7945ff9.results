Vaccine safety in pregnant ewes and does Both ewes and does were vaccinated at the beginning of the second trimester at day 52 and day 53 of gestation, respectively (Fig. 1) . Animals were vaccinated with 10 9 infectious units of ChAdOx1 RVF as previous studies with cattle, goats and sheep have shown this dose to be highly effective. 33 All ewes and does in the ChAdOx1 RVF (n = 8/group) and mock-vaccinated groups (n = 8/group) were in good health, with no clinical signs or other adverse events following vaccination. ChAdOx1 RVF-vaccinated animals had a slight elevation in temperature of~0.4°C in ewes and 0.5°C in does within 24 h of vaccination. This temperature rise reached statistical significance when compared to baseline (Mann-Whitney U test p < 0.05 for both species) but had normalized by day 2 post-vaccination. One ewe in the mockvaccinated group developed laryngeal chondritis ("Texel throat") unrelated to the study and had to be euthanised 10 days postvaccination. No other animals showed clinical signs in the 3-week follow-up period before challenge, indicating that the ChAdOx1 RVF vaccine is safe during pregnancy in these livestock species. Vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy in pregnant ewes To ensure comparability with previous RVFV vaccination challenge trials with pregnant ewes, 35 we used a viral challenge dose of 10 5 TCID 50 . The challenge virus dose was back titrated at 10 5.26 TCID 50 . Within 3 days after RVFV challenge, mock-vaccinated ewes had elevated rectal temperatures that coincided with a loss of appetite and high levels of viraemia (Figs 2a, g, 3) . One ewe died acutely 5 days post-challenge and had a typical necrotic liver and two dead foetuses on necropsy (Supplementary Table 1 ). Another ewe aborted one foetus 7 days post-challenge together with an autolysed placenta (Supplementary Table 1 ). At this point, all remaining ewes in this group were euthanised to prevent unnecessary animal discomfort. In total, the mock-vaccinated group carried 14 foetuses, which were all found dead on necropsy (Supplementary Table 1 ). Viral RNA and infectious virus were detected in maternal livers and spleens and in foetal liver, brain, spleen and placentomes (Fig. 3 ). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of placentomes from mock-vaccinated ewes revealed extensive haemorrhages and areas of necrosis on the maternal epithelium, with foci of mineralization (Fig. 4a , e, right column). RVFV-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed the presence of RVFV antigen in both maternal and foetal epithelial cells (Fig. 4b , f right column) and Alizarin Red staining confirmed the presence of calcium deposits (Fig. 4c, d, right column) . In contrast, all ChAdOx1 RVF-vaccinated ewes mounted high titre nAbs against RVFV (Fig. 2c) and showed no clinical signs or viraemia after RVFV challenge (Fig. 2a, g) . None of the ewes developed antibodies against RVFV N protein (which is absent in the ChAdOx1 RVF vaccine, but present in the challenge virus) before or after challenge suggesting that the vaccine confers sterile immunity in this species (Fig. 2e) . Following euthanasia and necropsy at the end of the study, the ChAdOx1 RVF-vaccinated ewes were found to carry 16 healthy foetuses of the expected size (Supplementary Table 1 ) with no detectable viral RNA in the maternal organs, blood, foetal organs or placentomes by 3) . IHC staining of the placentomes showed no specific staining for RVFV antigen (Fig. 4b , f, left column). Foci of mineralization were observed in placentomes from some ewes, but these had no impact on the health of the foetuses and no viral RNA could be detected in the placentomes (Fig. 3) . Vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy in pregnant does Following RVFV challenge, all does in the mock-vaccinated group (n = 8) showed clinical signs of infection including listlessness, reduced appetite and a transient increase in rectal temperatures starting 2 days post-challenge that was associated with high levels of viraemia (Fig. 2b, h) . Two does aborted autolysed foetuses at 8 days post-challenge and, as such, they were culled for reaching a humane endpoint (Supplementary Table 2 ). The remaining does (n = 6) were all euthanised on day 11 post-challenge to prevent unnecessary discomfort. At necropsy, three of the six does were found not to carry foetuses. These does were likely pseudopregnant, as confirmed retrospectively by low levels of pregnancyassociated glycoproteins measured by ELISA. All the foetuses in the three remaining pregnant does were dead and autolysed on necropsy (Supplementary Table 2 ). High viral RNA levels were detected in both maternal and foetal tissues (Fig. 3) , but virus could only be isolated, almost exclusively, in the placentomes due to the autolysed status of the foetuses at necropsy (Fig. 3) . IHC staining of the placentomes revealed strong staining for RVFV antigen, with large areas of necrotic maternal epithelium and mineralizations observed by H&E and Alizarin Red staining (Fig. 5 , right column). However, in strong contrast to mock-vaccinated ewes, extensive haemorrhages were not observed in the placentae of mock-vaccinated does. All ChAdOx1 RVF-vaccinated does developed RVFV nAbs ( Fig.  2d ) and remained completely healthy following challenge, with no clinical signs or viraemia (Fig. 2b, h) . Three ChAdOx1 RVFvaccinated does developed antibodies against RVFV N protein after challenge (doe number 234, 237 and 238), suggesting that the challenge virus underwent some replication in the host following infection. Two others (doe numbers 231 and 233) were in the 10% zone between the negative and the positive ELISA values and, as such, were considered doubtful (Fig. 2f ). That challenge virus replication occurred, despite the fact that the RVFV nAb titres in does were on average five times higher than those in ewes where such replication did not occur (geometric At the end of the study all ChAdOx1 RVF-vaccinated does were found to carry a total of 23 apparently healthy foetuses of the expected size and two autolysed foetuses that may have succumbed 1-week post-challenge based on their crown rump All values lower than 40% are considered positive, between 40% and 50% are considered doubtful and above 50% are considered negative. The dotted lines represent the 40% and 50% inhibition. Samples that tested negative for viraemia are depicted at the detection limit of the RT-qPCR assay (1.3 log10 RNA copies/ml). All data are depicted as means and standard errors. p Values from Mann-Whitney U test comparing pre-challenge VNT 50 titres (as measured on day 21; c and d) and viraemia levels at 3 days post-challenge (g and h) between mock-and ChAdOx1 RVF-vaccinated animals are shown; ***p < 0.001 lengths (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 2 ). The autolysed foetuses were part of multi-foetal pregnancies in two does-one doe carrying five foetuses and another carrying three-but the remaining foetuses carried by these does appeared healthy at necropsy. Organs samples (brain, liver, spleen) of apparently healthy foetuses were additionally assessed for abnormalities. Extensive histological analyses did not reveal any signs of pathology in these samples. None of the maternal tissues for any of the ChAdOx1 RVF-vaccinated does were positive for viral RNA (Fig. 3) . However, low levels of viral RNA could be detected in plasma or placentomes from foetuses harvested from four of the eight does and in one exception virus was isolated from a placentome (Fig. 3) . The lack of detectable RVFV antigen by immunohistology in the placentomes of any of the live foetuses is explained by the detection limit of the assay. As in all other study groups, foci of mineral deposits were observed in the placentomes of some does (Figs. 3, 5) .
