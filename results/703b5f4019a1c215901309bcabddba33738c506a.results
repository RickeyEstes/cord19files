Genetic diversity of SVV and design of the primers and probes for the SVV real-time RT-PCR and SVV RT-iiPCR The VP1 sequences are generally used to assess the genetic diversity of SVV. Phylogenetic analyses of the VP1 nucleotide sequences indicated that the global SVV strains formed into the clade of historical SVV (detected in the USA from 1988 to 2001) and the clade of contemporary SVV (detected in the USA, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, and Thailand mainly since 2015) (Fig. 1) . Based on the VP1 sequences, 112 global SVV strains had 86.2-100% nucleotide identities, with 93.3-99.9% nucleotide identities among the historical clade, 94.2-100% among the contemporary clade, and 86.2-94.8% between the historical and contemporary clades. The 79 SVV strains with whole genome sequences available can well represent the genetic diversity of SVVs ( Fig. 1 ) and these whole genome sequences were used to design the primers and probes targeting the conserved genomic regions. The primers and probe of a SVV rRT-PCR targeting the conserved 5â€² UTR and the primers and probe of a SVV RT-iiPCR targeting the 3D gene are shown in Table 1 .
