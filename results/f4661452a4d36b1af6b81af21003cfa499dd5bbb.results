3.1. Crude zinc balance, NK cell activity, IL-2, IL-6, sIL-6R and corticosterone plasma levels during liver regeneration in young, old and very old mice Table 1 shows that the crude zinc balance was positive in sham young and sham very old mice, while it was negative in sham old mice. At 48 h after their partial hepatectomy, the crude zinc balance was negative in young, old and very old pHx mice with a more significant negativity in old pHx mice than in young and very old pHx mice (P B/0.05). Positive values were newly observed at on day 15 following a partial hepatectomy in young and very old pHx mice but not in old pHx mice (Table 1) . Young and very old pHx mice display significant reductions in NK cell activity and IL-2 production at 48 h after their partial hepatectomy as compared with respective sham controls (time 0) (P B/0.01). Restoration occurred in the late period of compensatory liver growth (day 15) in young and very old pHx mice, but not in old pHx mice with no modifications as compared with respective controls (Table 1) . IL-6, sIL-6R and corticosterone plasma levels increased in young and very old pHx mice at 48 h from partial hepatectomy as compared with respective sham controls (P B/0.01), with restoration on day 15 of compensatory liver growth (Table 1) . No significant modifications in IL-6, sIL-6R and corticosterone were observed in old pHx mice during liver regeneration (Table 1 ). It is noteworthy that IL-6 and sIL-6R are high in very old sham mice in comparison with young sham mice (P B/0.01), but less high in comparison with old sham mice (Table 1) . However, very old mice displayed the same trend in IL-6, sIL-6R and corticosterone of young mice during liver regeneration. Moreover, a small number (n 0/3) of old mice display IL-6 near to 16 pg ml (1 : values similar to higher ones observed in very old mice (15.8 pg ml (1 ) at time 0. Therefore, relatively low levels of IL-6 may be considered a marker to reach successful ageing, as previously reported in very old humans (Bonafe et al., 2001) .
