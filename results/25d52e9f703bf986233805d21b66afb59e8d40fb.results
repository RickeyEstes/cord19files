Technically satisfactory spirometric measurements on both occasions (when patients were with URTI or asymptomatic) were obtained in 28 wheezy infants (18 males). In 10 patients lung function was measured first when they were asymptomatic and in 18 it was measured first when they were suffering from URTI. The mean delay between tests was 10.4 weeks (95%CI, 8.6-12.3). Anthropometric data, family history of asthma, and other characteristics of the studied infants are shown in Table 1 . There was no significant difference in baseline oxygen saturation between measurements when infants were asymptomatic or during URTI [97.2% (95%CI, 96.9-97.5) and 97.6% (95%CI, 97.2-98.09)], respectively. History of family asthma was present in 15/28 infants whereas exposure to tobacco during pregnancy was positive in 9/28, Table 1 . Mean values and 95% CI for lung function measurements in z-score are shown in Table 2 . URTI caused a marked and significant decrease of lung function as compared with measurements performed when infants were asymptomatic. The percentage of infants with a lung function decrease of Z1 z-score during URTI was as follows: 14.3% for FVC, 82.1% for FEF 50% , 60.7% for FEF 75% , 71.4% for FEF 25À75% , and 53.6% for FEV 0.5 . When the abnormality criterion for any value of lung function was set at a z-score equal or less than À1.65, it was found that during URTI 50% of infants (14/28) had one or more abnormal forced flow parameters. During URTI, the most compromised parameters were FEF 50% and FEF 25-75% , and forced expiratory flows were more affected than volumes (Table 2 and Figure 1) . Two examples of flowvolume manoeuvres from two patient when they were suffering URTI or asymptomatic are shown in Figure 2 . It was found that almost all infants had normal lung function (all the spirometric parameters assessed) when they were asymptomatic excepting two of them who remained under the À1.65 z-score for one isolated parameter. There was no association between the extent of the lung function decrease during URTI after adjusting for sex; age; perinatal tobacco exposure; history of family asthma; age of onset of recurrent wheezing; order of measurements; and number of previous wheezing episodes. However, there was a significant association between expiratory flows measured when infants were asymptomatic and tobacco during pregnancy. No significant association was found for lung function during URTI. There were not unwanted side effects derived from sedation or measurement procedure in any of the studied infants.
