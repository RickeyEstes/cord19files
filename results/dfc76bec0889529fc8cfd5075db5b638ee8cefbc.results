Uniquely modulated and shared lncRNAs between active vs latent HIV infection. To gain an understanding of epigenetics complexity of HIV infection, active and latently infected macrophages were Scientific RepoRts | 6:34862 | DOI: 10.1038/srep34862 subjected for lncRNAs expression profiling. Figure 1A ,B shows the volcano plots for the differential expression of lncRNAs in uninfected vs active infection and uninfected vs latent infection respectively. Based on microarray analysis, 795 lncRNAs were found downregulated (Fig. 1C ) and 389 lncRNAs were found upregulated (
