In a first experiment a virus titration of two different virusstocks of HCoV-NL63 was carried out and on day 6 p.i. read-out was performed by (i) microscopic scoring of the CPE and (ii) by using the CytoTox-Fluor TM Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Leiden, the Netherlands -cat no G9260). This CytoTox-Fluor TM assay has been developed to quantitate cell-death based on the cleavage of the bis-AAF-R110 peptide by proteases released from dead cells (Niles et al., 2007) . In this experiment the assay was used according to the manufacturers' instructions. Results are presented in Fig. 2 . For both virusstocks a very good correlation between the observed levels of CPE and the increased levels of fluorescence are observed. This indicates that the release of proteases by cultures that develop CPE and the subsequent cleavage of the bis-AAF-R110 peptide to its fluorescent substrate can be used to quantitate CPE. When a similar experiment was carried out using other methods to detect cell viability such as the MTS reduction method (Fig. 3) or the quantitation of LDH release (data not shown), no significant difference between infected and non-infected cell cultures could be observed. Next experiments were designed to optimize the assay for screening purposes. The optimal condition obtained was: 20,000 cells/well of Vero-118 cells infected with HCoV-NL63 (MOI = 0.01 CCID 50 /cell) in IMDM medium supplemented with 5% FBS medium. Upon infection cultures are maintained for 5 days at 35 • C after which 20 L of the peptide solution (16 M final concentration) is added. Fluorescence is measured after 2 hr incubation at 37 • C using parameters for rhodamine fluorescence read-out. The amount of peptide used under these conditions is 3x lower than proposed by the manufacturer of the Cytotox-Fluor TM assay. Using lower levels of peptide results in a decreased signal but the signalto-noise ratio remains sufficient high to be used under screening conditions (see below). The main reason to lower the amount of peptide is to make a screening campaign affordable. A batch of bis-AAF-R110 peptide was prepared by a commercial supplier. The peptide (MW 910 g/mol) was obtained as a light yellow powder, with >95% purity as determined by HPLC and was stored at −20 • C until use. Peptide stock solutions were prepared in DMSO at 100 mM and again stored at −20 • C until use. In a subsequent experiment the performance of the custom synthesized peptide stock was compared with that of the
