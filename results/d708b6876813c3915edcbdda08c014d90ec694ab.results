The first step in the literature search resulted in a total of 2659 papers. In total, 2531 studies were excluded on the basis of their title. The abstracts of the remaining 136 studies were assessed, and a further 93 papers excluded. Three more papers were excluded because they were not available online. An assessment of the full-text formats of the remaining 40 papers resulted in a further 16 exclusions. A total of 24 studies were finally included in the review (Table 1) . This section will first present the characteristics of selected studies, their objectives and methodological approaches. In line with the policy analysis framework employed in the review, this will then be followed by findings on the content, context, process and actors of priority setting processes. Finally, findings on how priority setting processes were evaluated in the studies are presented. Further information on these result areas for each of the papers selected for the review is presented in Supplementary data.
