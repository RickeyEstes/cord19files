Overall Structure of the USP2/Ubiquitin Complex USP2 is reported to exist in several isoforms (http:// merops.sanger.ac.uk/), and it is unclear how these differ in function. The isoforms consist of an N-terminal region of variable length and a 347 amino acid large C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain possesses the sequence signatures of an USP catalytic domain (Figure 1 ). In the largest isoform, USP2a, the catalytic domain is preceded by 258 amino acids, in the shortest by only 6. We focused our studies on the conserved catalytic domain. For clarity, the construct comprising residues 259-605 will hereon be referred to as USP2. USP2 was produced with high yields as recombinant protein in E. coli, and it cleaved the synthetic substrate ubiquitin-AMC with a catalytic efficiency k cat /K M of 2.6 3 10 5 M 21 s 21 (Table 1) . To facilitate the comparison of key residues, we refer the numbering of USP2 to that of USP7 (Figure 1 ), for which the first USP structure was published (Hu et al., 2002) . *Correspondence: martin.renatus@novartis.com Despite repeated trials with numerous USP2 preparations, we failed to crystallize ligand-free USP2. This might be due to the strong tendency of USP2 to aggre-gate, which is highly accelerated at temperatures below 10 C. Interestingly, complexation of USP2 with ubiquitin-aldehyde (resulting in a covalent complex) or unmodified ubiquitin (resulting in a noncovalent complex) prevented aggregation and yielded crystals that grew overnight. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that the crystals contain both protein components, USP2 and ubiquitin (data not shown). Diffraction properties improved significantly upon dehydration of the crystals (Abergel, 2004) , and a data set with 1.85 Å resolution was obtained. The structure could be solved by molecular replacement with USP7 as search molecule. The USP2 structure contains nine a helices and 14 b strands (Figure 2A ). Its overall shape resembles a cupped hand with the approximate dimensions of 35 Å 3 40 Å 3 65 Å and comprises three domains termed thumb, palm, and fingers ( Figure 2B ), an analogy first used for USP7 (Hu et al., 2002) . The finger domain is formed by a four-stranded b sheet (s1, s2, s4, s7), which is flanked by helix h5 0 . This helix is absent in USP7, while two short strands at the tip of the fingers, present in USP7 (s5 and s6), are missing in USP2 ( Figure 2C ). The thumb is formed by seven helices (h1-h6, including h5 0 ). Compared to USP7, it lacks two additional C-terminal helices (h9 and h10). The palm connects fingers and the thumb and is formed by several b strands and a helices (s3, s8-s14, h7, and h8). Residues 214-229 (Cysbox) and 292-305 (QDE-box) of the thumb, as well as residues 446-486, 477-486, and 512-520 of the palm (His-box), form the active site (Quesada et al., 2004) . The conserved residues Cys223, His464, and Asn481 form the catalytic triad, and Asn218 the oxyanion hole (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/). The cupped hand of USP2 nicely accommodates ubiquitin, an 8 kDa small and spherical molecule with a diameter of approximately 25 Å . In the complex, 3850 Å 2 of the solventaccessible surface is buried, which corresponds to roughly 40% of the ubiquitin surface. USP2 and ubiquitin have complementary shapes, providing a first structural explanation for the high selectivity of USPs for ubiquitin substrates.
