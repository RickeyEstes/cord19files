MOs confer protection to animal from Japanese encephalitis MO treatment conferred significant protection to mice following JEV infection. The survival of mice following JEV infection was dramatically increased with treatments of both 39 and 59 MO. Approximately 90% of all the animals that were treated with 39 MO survived as compared to 75% survival of those animals that were treated with 59MO, post infection with JEV ( Figure 2A ). Infection with JEV was accompanied with distinct symptoms and weight loss whereas treatments with both 39 and 59 MO post JEV infection, prevented animals from suffering. Not much considerable changes in the average body weights of JEVinfected animals treated with both 39 and 59 MO were observed when compared to animals belonging to JEV and JEV+ SC-MO groups showing significant reductions in their body weights 6 days post infection ( Figure 2B ). The symptoms associated with JE in murine model were observed on daily basis and scores were attributed accordingly. The animals that had most symptoms received the highest scores. It was observed that 39 and 59 MO treated animals scored lesser than those belonging to the JEVinfected or JEV+SC-MO groups ( Figure 2C ).
