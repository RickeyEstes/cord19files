Hypercytokinemia in H7N9-infected patients. We have performed multiplex analyses of 48 cytokine and chemokine mediators using these plasma samples while only 17 of these 48 mediators have been previously examined and reported inpatients infected with avian influenza virus [7] [8] [9] . In general, hypercytokinemia was observed in the plasma from patients infected with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus, but not in the plasma from patients infected with swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV)who are the same cohort of our previous study (Fig. 1 , Supplemental figure S1, Table S1) 11 . Overall, 34 of 48 measured cytokines and chemokines in the plasma harvested within the first 7 days of the disease onset of H7N9-infected patients were significantly higher than in samples from non-infected control individuals (Fig. 1, Supplemental figure S1 ). Notably, the elevation of chemokine IP-10, a critical player in the induction of lung injury [15] [16] [17] , was the most robust among all of the cytokines and chemokines measured (Fig. 1) . Additionally, increased levels of IL-2 and other mediators that participate in the development of T-helper 1, T-helper 2, and T-helper 17 cells were also observed ( Fig. 1 , Supplemental figure S1) 18 . Similar cytokine/chemokine profiles were noted in patients whose plasmas were collected during the second week between 8 and 14 days after disease onset (Supplemental Table S1 ). These data confirmed the presence of hypercytokinemia, also known as a "cytokine storm", in patients infected with the H7N9 virus and discovered 18 novel hypercytokinemia factors that were elevated in these patients, including MIF, SCF, HGF, SCGF-β , IL-18, β -NGF, SDF-1α , CTACK, IL-1ra, IL-9, G-CSF, IL-7, IL-5, GM-CSF, VEGF, IL-13, basic-FGF, and PDGF-bb elevated in avian influenza infected patients plasmas. The cytokine and chemokine levels in patients'plasma obtained 15 days after disease onset were generally decreased compared with the levels in plasma obtained during the acute phase of the disease. These results suggest that the plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines may be related to the severity of disease (Fig. 1, Supplemental figure S1 ). Some cytokine and chemokine plasma levels are correlated with the viral load of H7N9. From the plasma samples obtained from these 35 patients, we analyzed the potential correlations between the plasma levels of 34 elevated cytokines and chemokines and the patients viral load, APACHE II score 19 , and mortality respectively. We determined the viral loads using the cycle threshold (Ct) values of the H7N9-specific hemagglutinin (HA) gene measured in qRT-PCR as previously described 7 . The plasma levels of IP-10, MIG, MIF, HGF, and IL-18 were negatively correlated with the Ct values of H7 gene (and thus positively correlated with the viral load) during both week 1 and week 2 after disease onset ( Table 1 ). The plasma levels of SCF, β -nerve growth factor (β -NGF), and SCGF-β were negatively correlated with the Ct values of H7 gene only during the second week after disease onset (Table 1) . These results suggest the existence of hypercytokinemia dynamics that are induced by the H7N9 virus. Some cytokine and chemokine levels are related to the severity of disease. The APACHE II scores were used to evaluate the severity of disease on the first day that patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 20 . The plasma levels of SCF, HGF, MIF, IL-18, IP-10, and MIG during both week 1 and week 2 after disease onset showed a high and significant positive linear correlation with the APACHE II scores ( Table 2 , Supplemental figure S2, S3). The levels of HGF, IL-18, SCF, MIG, and IP-10 in plasma samples obtained during the first week of disease onset were especially highly associated with disease severity, indicating these molecules could serve as biomarkers at the early stages of infections ( Table 2 , Supplemental figure S2). These results suggest that the hypercytokinemia dynamics are Some cytokine and chemokine plasma levels can predict the fatal outcomes. We further analyzed whether these plasma cytokine and chemokine levels were linked to fatal outcomes. We noted that the plasma levels of HGF, MIF, MCP-1, SCF, SCGF-β , IP-10, and IL-18 during the second week of disease were found to be significantly higher in patients who died than in patients who left the hospital within 28 days (Fig. 2 , Supplemental Table S2 ). To statistically link each independent inflammatory mediator to the prediction of the fatal outcomes, we calculated the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve for all of the elevated cytokines and chemokines induced by H7N9 infection (Supplemental Table S3 ). The AUC values of the ROC curves of MIF, SCF, MCP-1, HGF, SCGF-β , IP-10, IL-18, and IFN-γ had significant P values (Fig. 3, Supplemental Table S3 ). Therefore, the levels of these identified proteins in plasma samples harvested from patients infected with H7N9 during the second week of disease onset could predict the fatal outcomes. The P values of the other reported significantly elevated cytokines and chemokines in plasma samples of H7N9-infected patients in this study including β -NGF, IL-6, MIG, IL-8, MIP-1β , SDF-1α , CTACK, MIP-1α , IL-1ra, IL-9, IL-10, G-CSF, IL-7, IL-5, GM-CSF, IL-1β , IL-4, VEGF, TNF-α , IL-13, IL-2, basic-FGF, IL-12p70, PDGF-bb, IL-17A, and RANTES are not significant to predict fatal outcomes (Supplemental table S3). These results suggest that the levels of the hypercytokinemia factors MIF, SCF, MCP-1, HGF, SCGF-β , IP-10, IL-18, and IFN-γ can be biomarkers that predict fatal outcomes for H7N9-infected patients. We also analyzed the logistic regression of outcome predictor independency with the cytokines and chemokines harvested in the patients' plasmas during the second week of disease onset. We used genomic mean of fold changes of hypercytokinemia factors levels including MIF, SCF, MCP-1, HGF, SCGF-β , IP-10, IL-18, and IFN-γ in the plasma samples of H7N9-infected patients because these cytokines and Figure S4 ). The profile of these 8 cytokines and chemokines was a statistically independent outcome predictor ( Table 3 ).
