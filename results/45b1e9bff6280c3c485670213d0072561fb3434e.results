Gross examination revealed poor body condition and mild dehydration; intestinal walls were thickened and contained a dense catarrhal exudate. Mesenteric lymph nodes were uniformly enlarged. Intestinal samples showed a mild to moderate diffuse chronic enteritis with blunting and fusion of villi, increased mitotic activity of enterocytes, mild dilatation of lacteals, and a severe infiltration of eosinophils in the lamina propria, with a lower number of lymphocytes and plasma cells. The number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (calculated as the mean value per 100 enterocytes on 10 randomly selected sagittally cut apical villi) was slightly increased, consisting in 38 IEL/100 enterocytes compared with 30-35 IEL/100 enterocytes in 2-4 months-old normal lambs (Reynolds and Morris, 1983) . In the colon the infiltrate was lighter and mainly lymphoplasmacytic rather than eosinophilic. Mesenteric lymph nodes showed marked hyperplasia of cortical follicles with some eosinophils in the medullary sinuses. No bacteria were isolated from liver, spleen or brain. Escherichia coli isolates, cultured from intestinal swabs, did not carry genes coding for the virulence factors considered in our diagnostic procedures. No viral particles were detected by electron microscopy and no parasites (coccidia, Cryptosporidium or round worms) were found in the samples. Similar results were obtained from the euthanized lambs. However, direct light microscopy carried out on the small intestine content revealed the presence of a large number of flagellated organisms, which, on the basis of their morphology, were identified as Giardia sp. trophozoites. The IF assay was also negative, a finding that is due to the lack of the cyst wall, and therefore of the cyst wall antigens, i.e. the target of the monoclonal antibody, on the trophozoites. Molecular analysis revealed that the parasite belonged to the Assemblage B of Giardia duodenalis. More precisely, the highest homology (99%) was found with the subgenotype S1. After diagnosis, all lambs were treated with fenbendazole at a dose of 10 mg/kg administered for 3 consecutive days, as suggested by other authors (Xiao et al., 1996; O'Hadley et al., 1997) . After treatment, animals rapidly recovered from the symptoms and the weight gain went back to normal.
