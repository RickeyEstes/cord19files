This section discusses results including the airflow field used, contaminant transport using the Markov matrices, and the sensor placement algorithm. Three air flow field are generated using CFD. Based on these flow fields Markov matrices are calculated and are shown to provide similar contaminant transport as the advection diffusion equation. Using these Markov matrices sensors are placed in for applications in CBW and IAQ applications using different sensing and placement constraints. A literature comparison with an aircraft cabin is discussed in Appendix A, which provided the initial motivation for this work. other boundaries are insulated. The inlet temperature and the heat flux of the people and the wall were taken from a similar sensor placement CFD problem from Liu et al., 2009 [29] . The 2nd and the 3rd case have 1 person and 2 people in the space respectively, and a heated window on the right boundary above the outlet, Fig. 8c and Fig. 8d . The CFD simulations used the turbulent RNG k-ε model, and all the residuals were solved to 1e-6. Buoyancy in flow field 2 and flow field 3 was introduced by the Boussinesq approximation for density. Each simulation was discretized into 4480, 11140, and 10280 hexahedral elements for case 1, 2, and 3 respectively. These discretizations of the flow field produced sufficiently spatially converged values of the u and v components of velocity and the temperature when compared with meshes at higher resolutions. The air flow field for the isothermal problem, Fig. 8b , has been compared with the data specified by the benchmark problem, IEA 1993, and the data that agreed well with the published literature. For the other flow fields the same fluid flow model was used that validated the turbulent Rayleigh-Benard problem. In the validation of an aspect ratio 1 Â 1 Rayleigh-Benard cell, the Nusselt number was compared with correlations in literature [46, 47] . The data produced by these simulations agreed well with the published correlations.
