Over the 2-year period, 161 patients were prescribed urgent radiotherapy over a weekend or on a hospital delivered on an emergency basis, and these occasions may occur outside of regular working hours. On weekends and statutory holidays, emergency treatments are subject to the discretion of the attending radiation oncologist. Cancer Care Ontario (cco) defines oncologic emergencies as "medical conditions arising from a reversible threat to organ function requiring radiation treatment within a few hours of diagnosis." The most common oncologic emergencies include malignant spinal cord compression, brain metastases (complicated by altered level of consciousness, uncontrolled seizures, or uncal herniation), superior vena cava obstruction (complicated by cardiovascular or neurologic compromise), acute airway obstruction, or uncontrolled tumour hemorrhage 1 . The Odette Cancer Centre (occ) in Toronto, Canada, offers radical and palliative radiotherapy treatment for cancer patients. The radiotherapy department at the occ regularly operates Monday-Friday, 8 am-6 pm 2 . Additionally, a clinic dedicated to accommodating the urgent management of patients who require rapid access to radiotherapy for treatment of either their symptomatic metastatic or primary disease progression operates during working hours 3, 4 . The centre may operate on weekends and holidays to accommodate radiation treatment of oncologic emergencies involving patients for whom a delay in radiotherapy might compromise treatment outcome 2 . Standards for quality assurance are devised and implemented to facilitate commonality in establishing and evaluating quality assurance programs at cancer centres across Canada 1 . For the purposes of the present study, quality assurance is defined as adherence of an institution to its own departmental policy. To date, literature to suggest appropriateness of delivering radiation treatment on weekends and holidays is scarce, and no cohesiveness is apparent in the standards of care for weekend radiation treatment 5 . The main objective of the present study was to determine the incidence of radiotherapy treatment on weekends and statutory holidays, and the specific reasons for such treatment during the study period. The secondary objective was to ascertain whether the reasons for weekend and holiday treatment adhered to departmental policy and therefore achieved compliance with quality assurance procedures implemented by both the occ and cco. From September 2002 to September 2004, 161 patients were treated as emergency cases over a weekend. In this patient cohort, 176 anatomic sites were planned for emergency radiation. The median number of patients treated was 21 per interval, with an average of 1-2 patients per weekend. Table i illustrates that, overall, most patients (68%) were treated on both Saturday and Sunday, less frequently (22%) on Saturday alone, and the least frequently on Sunday Current OnCOlOgy-VOlume 16, number 4 alone (10%). Additionally, 6.2% were treated on a statutory holiday attached to a weekend. (No data were collected for statutory standalone holidays not attached to weekends, and therefore no results can be generated for these unique situations.) The pattern was generally consistent over the 2 years and was not influenced by long weekends. The general trend as described was also consistent across intervals. Table ii lists the age, sex, primary cancer site, dose fractionation schedule, and inpatient or outpatient status of the studied patients. Median age was 67 years (range: 38-88 years). In 70% of cases, patients receiving treatment were outpatients; the remainder were inpatients either at the occ or a local community hospital. The highest frequencies of primary tumour diagnoses were lung (31%), prostate (18%), and breast cancer (17%). In 94% of cases, patients were treated with 20 Gy in 5 fractions. Of all cases treated over the weekend or on a hospital holiday, 66% received radiation to the spine; 16%, to the brain; and 11%, to the chest/mediastinum. In 15% of the overall population, radiation to more than one anatomic site was urgently prescribed (Figure 1 ). Table iii describes the main reasons for prescription of emergency weekend or holiday treatment. Spinal cord compression (56% of the cohort), brain metastases (both symptomatic and asymptomatic-15%), and superior vena cava obstruction (svco-6%) were the top three reasons for referral for emergency weekend or holiday treatment. When reviewing treatments given over a weekend for compliance with departmental policy, a purely subjective analysis suggests that close to three quarters (129/169) of the reasons for treatment can be said to reflect appropriate intent. In a more detailed look at Table iii, most reasons for treatment appear justified; however, reasons such as brain metastases, painful skeletal or spine metastases, and impending spinal cord compression were not considered justified under occ policy.
