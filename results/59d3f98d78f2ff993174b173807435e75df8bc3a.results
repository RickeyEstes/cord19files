Bats carry CCHFV GP-reactive antibodies. From 2003 through 2011 bats were sampled in Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Germany and Panama. The sample included 1,135 blood or serum specimens from 16 bat species pertaining to six different bat families with variable habitat preference and diet. To assess if bats harbor CCHF-like viruses, we screened bat serum samples for CCHFV GP-reactive antibodies by IIFT. In total, 114 of 1,135 (10.0%) sera from 12 of 16 bat species sampled between 2005 and 2009 in 4/5 countries reacted with recombinant CCHFV GP antigen (range 1.0-57.6%, Table 1 , Fig. 1 ). An example of a reactive bat serum sample is shown in Fig. 2A . IIFT-positive detections were predominantly identified in cave-dwelling, migratory bats including the frugivorous species Rousettus aegyptiacus (24.4%; 48/197) as well as the insectivorous species Coleura afra (42.9%; 6/14), Hipposideros cf. caffer (6.3%; 3/48), Miniopterus inflatus (17.6%; 9/51) and Hipposideros gigas (24.8%; 32/129) from Congo and Gabon (Fig. 1) . CCHFV seropositivity was significantly elevated for bat species that roost in caves versus those that roost in trees ( Fig. 1 Figure) . Age (p = 0.7434), dietary (p = 0.4622), gender (p = 0.4613), migration (p = 0.4788) and seasonality (p = 0.1605) were not associated with differences in seroprevalence (Supplementary  Table 1 ). No antibodies were found in (n = 43) sera from New World bats, corresponding to the notion that CCHFV is an Old World virus 2 . Detection of CCHFV neutralizing antibodies in African bat species. As antibody cross-reactivity between CCHFV and viruses from the related NSDV serogroup cannot be completely ruled out by IIFT 31 , specific virus neutralization tests (NT) were done. NT can prove previous infection with CCHFV because there is no cross-neutralization between serogroups 31 . Because NTs require relatively large volumes of serum that cannot be obtained from most bat species, only for 30 of the 114 IIFT-positive sera covering 10/12 bat species, NT assays could be performed. In addition, 10 CCHFV IIFT-negative samples with sufficient volume, representing all 10 assessed bat species, were tested. Sera were tested at a 1:100 dilution in a 96-well format using a recently established CCHF virus-like particle (VLP)-based NT 27 . Out of 30 IIFT-positive sera, 11 showed significant neutralizing activity defined as 80% reduction of luciferase luminescence signal (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Table 2 ). None of the 10 IIFT-negative control sera had neutralizing activity (Fig. 2B) . In parallel, all 40 (30 IIFT-positive, 10 IIFT-negative) bat sera were tested in a Rift Valley fever (RVF) VLP-based NT 32 , all with negative results, ruling out nonspecific neutralization activity in bat sera (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 2 ). For 7 of 11 CCHF VLP-positive sera, enough material was available to conduct additional neutralization tests by a full virus CCHFV neutralization test under biosafety level 4 conditions. Endpoint titration by IIFT in these samples revealed high reciprocal titers between 160 and 1,280 ( Table 2 , Fig. 2A ). Sera were thus titrated in 2-fold serial dilutions in a range of 1:40-1:1,280. The test confirmed full virus neutralizing activity in 5 of 7 sera, with reciprocal titers ranging between 40 (lowest testing dilution due to lack of serum) and 160 ( Table 2 ). Lack of evidence for CCHFV-related nucleotide sequences in bat serum samples. To identify CCHFV-related nucleotide sequences in serum samples, we combined three previously established generic RT-PCR protocols that were shown to detect all known nairoviruses [28] [29] [30] . Modifications were made to increase the sensitivity for the detection of CCHFV-related nucleotide sequences by applying low annealing temperatures and degenerated oligonucleotides. Viral RNA of CCHFV strain IbAr was used to test oligonucleotides from Lambert et al. 29 in combination with primers from Wölfel and colleagues 30 . The endpoint RT-PCR detection limit of an RT-PCR formulation that used the best combination of primers was between 8 and 80 copies per reaction. An additional RT-PCR assay was developed based on a hemi-nested formulation using primers described in Honig et al. 28 followed by a 2 nd round RT-PCR step with novel primers. The sensitivity limit of this assay also ranged between 8 and 80 copies per reaction. Serum samples from Artibeus jamaicensis (n = 28), A. lituratus (n = 15, both from Panama) as well as Myotis dasycneme (n = 26, Germany) were not available for RT-PCR testing due to sample volume limitations (< 25 μ l). In the remaining 1,067 of 1,135 serologically-tested sera, no CCHFV RNA was found by both RT-PCR formulations. In parallel, these same bat serum sample-derived RNA extracts had successfully been used for the detection of novel paramyxo 18 -, hepe 20 -, hepadna 19 -and flaviviruses 17 , confirming that the material was appropriate for RNA virus testing.
