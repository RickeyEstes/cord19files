Expression of ppGalNAC-T2 mRNA in human poorly differentiated malignant tumor cells. To investigate the potential role of ppGalNAc-T2 in human malignant tumors, we first detected the expression panel of ppGalNAc-T2 in 5 types of poorly differentiated malignant tumor cell lines. The mRNA level of ppGalNAc-T2 in these cells was determined by RT-PCR. All poorly differentiated tumor cells which have aberrant terminal sugar structures of O-glycan chains, including SGC7901 gastric cancer, SHG44 glioma, SHI-1 leukemia, A549 lung adenocarcinoma, and HO8910 ovarian cancer cells expressed ppGalNAc-T2 (Fig. 1) . Thus ppGalNAc-T2 may be markers for poorly differentiated carcinomas. In addition, we found that ppGalNAc-T2 mRNA was differentially expressed, as shown in Fig. 1A . The mRNA expression ratios (ppGalNAc-T2/β-actin) were 0.38±0.016, 1.23±0.017, 0.82±0.035, 0.69±0.014 and 0.78±0.023, respectively. The results showed that ppGalNAc-T2 expression in SGC7901 cells was higher than in other cells (P<0.05) (Fig. 1B) , suggesting that this gene may play a key role in gastric tumorigenesis. We therefore used gastric cancer as our research model to determine whether ppGalNAc-T2 is correlated with cell invasion and metastasis. Establishment of ppGalNAc-T 2 overexpression or downregulation of cells. To further explore the role of ppGalNAc-T2 in gastric cancer, SGC7901 cells were used to reconstitute the expression of ppGalNAc-T2 by stable overexpression (SGC7901-T2s) or downregulation (SGC7901-T2as) of ppGalNAc-T2. Transfection efficiency was measured using fluorescence microscopy to detect expression of the plasmidencoded eGFP gene (Fig. 2) . Then, the ppGalNAc-T2 mRNA and protein levels in the SGC7901 cells were measured by RT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. When compared with untreated cells, ppGalNAc-T2 transcripts were increased in the pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vector transfected cells (P<0.05) (Fig. 3A and B) . Consistent with the RT-PCR results, the expression of the ppGalNAc-T2 protein was clearly increased in this group (P<0.05) (Fig. 3C and D) . Furthermore, ppGalNAc-T2 mRNA and protein expression was suppressed in the SGC7901-T2as group when compared to the untreated group (P<0.05), while no difference was found between the control group and the untreated cells (P>0.05). The above results indicate the successful construction of the ppGalNAc-T2 overexpression or downregulation cell lines. These stable cell lines can be effectively used to further examine the role of ppGalNAc-T2.
