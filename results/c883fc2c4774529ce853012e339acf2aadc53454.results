Two hundred and twenty children, median (25 th -75 th percentile) age 12.2 (6.2-27.5) months, were enrolled and had a nasal swab taken. More than half, 114 (51.8%), were under 12 months, while 163 (74.1%) were less than 24 months of age, Table 1 . HRV was detected in 128 (58.2%) of the samples. Most HRV-positive children were under 24 months of age (92/128; 71.8%) while half were under 12 months. There was no difference in the previous number of wheezing episodes in HRV-positive compared to negative children. The clinical symptoms and HRV status of children admitted to hospital and those treated as an out-patient is presented in Table 2 . Wheezing was more common in hospitalized children (93%) and the total duration of symptoms was shorter. HRV was detected throughout the year although there was a peak in spring (September-November of 2004 and 2005) and another in February-April 2005 (autumn) (Figure 1 ). Co-infection with hMPV, HBoV and HCoV-NL63 was found in 8 (6.3%), 6 (4.7%) and 1 (0.8%) of the 128 HRV-positive samples respectively. Of the 92 HRVnegative samples 5 (5.4%) were hMPV positive, 10 (10.9%) HBoV positive and 3 (3.3%) HCoV positive. Of the 58 samples screened for the common respiratory viruses by general shell vial culture 14 (24.1%) were positive; 4 (6.9%) HRV-positive and 10 (17.2%) HRVnegative. Sequencing of the 5' UTR was performed on 71/128 (55.5%) positive samples using convenience sampling ensuring each month of the study period was included, but without prior knowledge of patient data. Figure 2 shows the phylogenetic distribution. HRV-C can be divided into 2 variants, Ca or Cc, with either HRV-Alike or HRV-C-like 5'UTR's respectively. HRV-Ca sequences (n = 24) were interspersed within the HRV-A region of the phylogenetic tree. The remaining HRV-C samples (n = 13) formed a separate branch with the HRV-C-like 5'UTR. HRV-C was the most prevalent (37/ 71; 52.1%) followed by HRV-A (26/71; 36.6%) and HRV-B (8/71; 11.3%). HRV-C was found throughout the year while HRV-A had peaks in the spring and autumn seasons and HRV-B was sporadically detected (Figure 3) . Presenting symptoms or signs in HRV-infected and uninfected children were similar, except for fever which was less common in HRV-infected group of children and vomiting which was more common (Table 1) . Most children with HRV infection had mild illness, although 45 (35.2%) required hospitalisation and 3 (2.3%) were admitted to the intensive care unit. The median (IQR) duration of hospitalisation was 1 (1-4) days; there was no difference in the duration of hospitalisation between HRV-infected and uninfected children. There were no in-hospital deaths. Of those admitted to hospital and where a HRV sequencing result was available (n = 15) 8 (25.8%) were typed as species C, 5 species A (16.1%) and 2 species B (6.4%).
