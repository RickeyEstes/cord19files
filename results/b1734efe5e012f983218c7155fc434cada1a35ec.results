FluA and FluB DNA-encoded monoclonal antibodies are expressed in vitro and in vivo Broadly-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against influenza A (FluA) and influenza B (FluB) were isolated from human memory Bcells as previously described. 14, 15 The FluA monoclonal antibody is closely related to a recently published broadly-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, which shows a wide range of HA crossreactivity due to the binding to the HA stalk and is capable of neutralizing influenza A viruses from both group 1 and group 2 (average IC 50 of 2.56 μg/mL, data not shown). 10 The FluB monoclonal antibody was identified and selected based on its ability to potently neutralize influenza B viruses belonging to both Victoria and Yamagata lineages (average IC 50 of 0.64 μg/mL, data not shown). This antibody binds to a conserved region in the globular head of influenza B HA, and can inhibit viral hemagglutination of red blood cells. To test the utility of DMAb delivery to prevent severe influenza infection, a synthetic DNA transgene encoding either human IgG FluA or FluB was synthesized de novo, and cloned into a mammalian expression plasmid. Multiple modifications were made to enhance DMAb expression including DNA codon optimization, RNA optimization, and formulation of plasmid DNA (Supplemental Fig. S1 ), as well as plasmid vector design, incorporation of leader sequences for processing and secretion, and CELLECTRA® electroporation techniques. 16, 17 Quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of human IgG in human embryonic kidney 293 T cells transfected with either FluA DMAb or FluB DMAb synthetic constructs confirmed intracellular expression and extracellular secretion of FluA and FluB antibodies, respectively (Fig. 1a) . Human IgG Western blot also demonstrated antibody heavy-chain and lightchain expression in transfected 293 T cells (Fig. 1b) . Athymic CAnN.Cg-Foxn1 nu /Crl nude mice were inoculated with FluA or FluB DMAb plasmid DNA via intramuscular injection at doses from 100 to 300 μg, utilizing intramuscular electroporation (IM-EP) formulated with hyaluronidase to enhance DMAb delivery and expression (Supplemental Figure S1 ). Peak expression levels in nude mouse sera reached a mean of 10.0 μg/mL (±2.6 SEM) and 31.8 μg/mL (±8.1 SEM) for FluA DMAb and FluB DMAb, respectively. Notably, significant human IgG expression persisted 10 weeks (Fig. 1c, d) and beyond, indicative of the in vivo stability of DNA plasmid and antibody expression. We next defined the expression of anti-influenza DMAbs in immune-competent BALB/c mice (Fig. 1e, f) , an established influenza challenge model. BALB/c mice received 100-300 μg of plasmid DNA via IM-EP. The FluA DMAb construct generated modest levels of human IgG in BALB/c mouse sera as measured 5 days post delivery (300 μg plasmid mean, 1.8 μg/mL ± 0.3 SEM). Similar to what was observed in nude mice, FluB DMAb expression was more robust than FluA DMAb expression 5 days post delivery (200 μg mean, 5.4 μg/mL ± 0.6 SEM; 300 μg mean, 10 μg/mL ± 1.9 SEM). Unlike the stable expression observed in nude mice, serum DMAb levels in BALB/c mice were undetectable 10 days post delivery, likely due to mouse adaptive anti-human-IgG responses against the expressed DMAb. Collectively, these data clearly demonstrated DMAb human IgG was produced at substantial levels in vivo following administration of plasmid constructs. In vivo-expressed influenza DMAbs are functionally active and demonstrate broad cross-reactivity In vitro binding activity in sera collected from DMAb-treated BALB/c mice was determined to test if DMAbs generated in vivo retained cross-reactivity to multiple subtypes of influenza A and both lineages of influenza B. FluA DMAb from sera bound to a comprehensive array of influenza A Group 1 and Group 2 HA antigens from viruses known to infect humans (Table 1) including recombinant trimeric HA from representative seasonal H1, H3 and potentially pandemic H2, H5, H6, H7, H9 influenza isolates (Fig. 2a) , as well as recombinant monomeric HA H10 (Supplemental Fig. S2 ). FluB DMAb in murine sera bound to influenza B HA from representative Victoria and Yamagata lineage viruses (Fig. 2b) . Half-maximal effective concentrations (EC 50 ) of reciprocal serum dilutions indicated higher binding activity in sera of mice receiving more plasmid DNA, reflecting increased DMAb expression levels. The potent in vitro neutralization capabilities of the parent FluB monoclonal antibody allowed for neutralization activity testing whereas the potency of the FluA monoclonal antibody did not allow for differentiation from the non-specific interference of mouse serum in the microneutralization assay. Sera from mice that received FluB DMAb plasmid constructs effectively neutralized both Yamagata and Victoria lineage influenza B viruses in an in vitro cell-based assay (Fig. 2c) , with a similar pattern of reactivity as seen in binding assays. After normalizing for human IgG concentration in each sample, the calculated half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) from mice treated with FluB DMAb plasmid (0.015 μg/mL for B/ Florida (Fig. 4) . Again, for direct comparison of DMAb versus purified protein, recombinant FluB monoclonal antibody was administered i.p. to separate groups 1 day prior to infection. Quantification of human IgG present in mouse serum at time of challenge showed that FluB DMAb yielded similar mean human IgG concentrations and HA binding activity as observed in animals treated with 1 mg/kg of FluB protein i.p. (Fig. 4a, d,  Supplemental Fig. S3 ). Remarkably, 100% of FluB DMAb-treated mice survived both Victoria and Yamagata lethal influenza B challenge, whereas non-specific DMAb controls fully succumbed to both infections by Day 8 (Fig. 4b, e) . Consistent with survival data, FluB DMAb protected mice from influenza B-related morbidity with treated animals exhibiting little-to-no weight loss (Fig. 4c, f) . In addition, FluB DMAb-treated mice exhibited significantly lower lung viral loads than those observed in control mice (Supplemental Fig. S4 ). Survival, weight loss, lung viral loads, and in vitro binding activity in sera of FluB DMAb-treated mice closely paralleled the same parameters in mice receiving 1 mg/kg (Fig. 5a) . Influenza Aspecific and B-specific ELISAs showed that FluA and FluB DMAbs exhibited expression levels similar to those observed in sera of mice receiving 0.3 mg/kg of recombinant FluA monoclonal antibody and 1 mg/kg recombinant FluB monoclonal antibody delivered i.p., respectively (Fig. 5b) . All mice receiving FluA plus FluB DMAb were completely protected from lethal infection, whereas 90% and 100% of mice treated with control DMAb succumbed to the influenza A and B infections, respectively (Fig. 5c, d) . DMAb administration and delivery of protein IgG resulted in similar levels of protection, apparent in both survival rate and body weight loss (Supplemental Fig. S5 ). Twenty-one days following initial infection, sera of surviving BALB/c mice had undetectable levels of human IgG (data not shown), indicating DMAb and recombinant protein were no longer present. Serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and mouse anti-HA binding antibodies against the infecting influenza strain confirmed that mice mounted a host immune response to infection (Supplemental Fig. S6 ). DMAb-treated mice were able to mount host immune responses against the virus to the same extent as the purified IgG-treated animals. Twenty-eight days following initial infection, all surviving mice (including one DMAb control mouse that survived initial A/CA/09 H1 infection) were re-challenged with a lethal dose of homologous influenza virus to confirm that the level of mouse host immune response was protective. All previously-challenged mice survived the lethal homologous re-challenge without substantial weight loss, whereas 80-90% of untreated age-matched mice naïve to infection did not survive (Fig. 5e, f, Supplemental Fig. S5 ). These results demonstrate protective host anti-influenza responses developed in the presence of protective levels of FluA and FluB antibodies whether expressed in vivo as DMAb or delivered as protein monoclonal antibody, demonstrating that DMAbs did not antagonize each other or the host immune response to influenza.
