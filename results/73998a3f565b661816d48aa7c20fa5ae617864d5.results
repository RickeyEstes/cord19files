To investigate the ACE2 expression pattern in the gastrointestinal tract of Asian adult samples, we incorporated two public single cell RNA-seq data of colorectal cancer (CRC) cohorts from GEO (GSE97693 and GSE81861) and one cohort from Renji Hospital. We performed single cell analysis on 504 cells from GSE97693, including 485 cell from CRC (primary tumor) and 19 cells from healthy normal control (NC). We observed that ACE2 is expressed in 38.5%(194/504) of all human colon cells. We also observed that the ACE2 expressed cells were significantly enriched in tumors when compared with healthy normal tissues (39.6% vs 10.5%, p <0.05) ( Fig. 1 A-C) . Consistently, in GSE81861 dataset, ACE2 is expressed in 10.5%(62/590) of all human colon cells. We also observed that the ACE2 expressed cells were significantly enriched in colorectal tumors when compared with healthy normal tissues (12.5% vs 7.0%, p < 0.05) (Fig.1D-F) . Those results intrigue us to investigated whether ACE2 is also enriched in precancerous lesion of colorectal tumor, such as colorectal adenoma(CRA). We performed single cell RNA profiling on the tissues from colorectal cancer, colorectal adenoma and healthy normal control from Renji Hospital hospital. Totally, 21,686 cells (4784 from CRC, 7130 from CRA and 9772 from NC samples) were collected after single cell RNA-seq quality control ( Fig.2A) . The ACE2 expressed cells were significantly enriched in CRC samples compared with CRA and NC samples (5.15% vs 2.94% and 1.75%, p<0.05) ( Fig.2 B , C). In consistent with previous studies(9, 10), we also observed that ACE2 cell were mainly expressed in epithelial cells which highly express EPCAM (Fig.2D ).
