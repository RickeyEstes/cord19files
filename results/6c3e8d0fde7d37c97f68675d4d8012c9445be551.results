RDV and IFNb have superior antiviral activity to LPV and RTV. We utilized a recombinant MERS-CoV engineered to express a reporter nanoluciferase (MERS-nLUC) for our in vitro antiviral activity assays. To ensure that our reporter virus behaved similarly to WT MERS-CoV, we first demonstrated that MERS-nLUC and wild-type (WT) MERS-CoV EMC 2012 strain replicate to similar levels in the absence of drug treatment and are similarly susceptible to the antiviral activity of RDV (WT EC 50 = 0.12 µM; MERS-nLUC EC 50 = 0.09 µM) in the human lung epithelial cell line, Calu-3 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). These data are in agreement with those for WT MERS Jordan strain (EC 50 = 0.3 µM) reported by Warren et al. 18 . Thus, future reporter virus data should be representative of WT MERS-CoV. We then performed parallel antiviral assays in Calu-3 cells with MERS-nLUC comparing LPV, RTV, IFNb, and RDV ( Fig. 1 ; Supplementary Fig. 2) 17 . Similar to our previous reports, RDV showed potent inhibition of MERS-CoV replication with a EC 50 of 0.09 µM, no observable cytotoxicity up to 10 μM and a selectivity index (SI = EC 50 /CC 50 ) > 100 17 . (Fig. 1a) . In contrast, the respective EC 50 values generated for LPV and RTV were 11.6 and 24.9 µM with CC 50 values >50 µM (Fig. 1b, c) . Thus, the SI for LPV and RTV was > 4.3 and > 2, respectively. Combination LPV and RTV (LPV:RTV, 4.6:1 molar ratio) is currently under evaluation in the MIRACLE trial 14 . The antiviral activity of LPV/ RTV (EC 50 = 8.5 µM) was similar to LPV alone (EC 50 = 11.6 µM, P = 0.43, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test), suggesting the effect was largely driven by LPV (Fig. 1d) . We found potent inhibition of MERS-CoV with IFNb (EC 50 = 175 international units (IU)/mL) (Fig. 1e) , CC 50 values >2800 IU/mL and an SI > 16. Together, these data demonstrate that RDV and IFNb have superior in vitro antiviral activity compared with LPV and RTV, and that RTV does not significantly enhance the antiviral activity of LPV in vitro. IFNb activity is not improved when combined with LPV/RTV. Cell culture medium and human plasma have different concentrations and types of proteins, which directly affects the levels of biologically available free drug unbound to protein complicating the comparison of drug levels the respective systems 23 . To address this issue, we utilized comparative equilibrium dialysis (CED) to determine the differences in free unbound drug between human plasma and cell culture medium revealing that the maximal plasma concentration (C max ) in human plasma (15 µM) had the same amount of free unbound LPV as 5 µM LPV in 10% FBS containing cell culture medium. Thus, we combined LPV (5 µM) and RTV (1.09 µM) at a fixed molar ratio of 4.6:1 in combination with increasing concentrations of IFNb. The antiviral activity of the LPV/RTV-IFNb combination (EC 50 = 160 IU/mL) was indistinguishable from that of IFNb alone (EC 50 = 175 IU/mL) (P = 0.62, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test) (Fig. 1f) . These data suggest that the observed in vitro antiviral activity of the LPV/RTV-IFNb combination on MERS-CoV is dominated by IFNb when LPV/RTV is used at clinically relevant concentrations. A MERS-CoV mouse model for the testing of nucleotide prodrugs. Unlike humans, mice have high levels of a serum esterase (carboxylesterase 1c, Ces1c) that drastically reduces the stability of RDV in mice requiring efficacy studies be performed in Ces1c −/− mice to better approximate the pharmacokinetics and drug exposure profile in humans 17 . MERS-CoV infection of standard laboratory mice is prevented due to differences in human and mouse dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the entry receptor for MERS-CoV. To enable testing of RDV in mice, we bred Ces1c −/− mice with mice harboring a modified DPP4 humanized via CRISPR/Cas9 at residues 288 and 330 (hDPP4). The resultant Ces1c −/− hDPP4 mice had indistinguishable virus replication and pathogenesis from hDPP4 mice when infected with MERS-CoV (Supplementary Fig. 3 ) 22, 24 . Prophylactic RDV diminishes MERS-CoV replication and disease. Using the new Ces1c −/− hDPP4 mouse model, we sought to determine if prophylactic RDV could ameliorate MERS-CoV disease. As shown in Fig. 2a , prophylactic RDV (25 mg/kg, BID) administered 1 day prior to infection significantly diminished MERS-CoV-induced weight loss in mice infected with 5E + 04 (P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test) or 5E + 05 plaque-forming units (pfu) (P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test) as compared with similarly infected vehicle-treated animals. Moreover, RDV administered prior to infection also prevented mortality (P = 0.0037, Mantel-Cox test) in those administered a lethal dose (i.e., 5E + 05 pfu) (Fig. 2b) . In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, lung hemorrhage was significantly reduced (P < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test) with RDV prophylaxis (Fig. 2c) 22, 25, 26 . Importantly, RDV prophylaxis significantly reduced virus lung titers > 3 logs on both 4 (5E + 04 P = 0.0240, 5E + 04 P = 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with Sidek's multiple comparison test) and 6 days post infection (dpi) (5E + 05 P = 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with Sidek's multiple comparison test) (Fig. 2d) , which was corroborated by viral antigen labeling in lung tissue sections (Fig. 2e) . RDV prophylaxis reduces features of ALI. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) issued a consensus document with defined parameters and tools to more accurately translate small animal models of acute lung injury (ALI) to the human condition 26 . Using the ATS Lung Injury Scoring System designed to quantitate histopathological features of ALI (Fig. 3a) , we blindly scored fields of hematoxylin and eosin stained lung tissue sections from the mice in Fig. 2 for the following features: neutrophils in the alveolar and interstitial space, hyaline membranes, proteinaceous debris filling the air spaces, and alveolar septal thickening 26 . As compared with control mice, the ATS lung injury scores were significantly reduced in RDV-treated mice (P = 0.0079, Mann-Whitney test) infected with 5E + 04 pfu MERS-CoV and approached statistical significance (P = 0.0536, Mann-Whitney test) in those infected with the higher virus dose (5E + 05 pfu) (Fig. 3a) . In Fig. 3 , we also show examples of the quantitated pathological features. In normal healthy mock-infected control mice (Fig. 3b) , the alveolar air spaces are free of debris and inflammatory cells, the walls (i.e., septae) of the alveolar sac are thin which facilitates efficient gas exchange and rare neutrophils in circulation are seen in the capillaries within alveolar septae, but not in the air spaces. In contrast, vehicle-treated MERS-CoVinfected animals in both viral dosage groups (Fig. 3c ) had multiple histologic features of ALI including notable immune cell infiltration into the alveolar septae and resultant septal wall thickening, scattered degenerating and dying cells, proteinaceous debris in the air spaces resulting from capillary leakage some of which is organized into hyaline membranes and neutrophils in alveolar septae as well as in the air spaces. Interestingly, the early hyaline membranes (i.e., thin pink material lining alveoli) were noted in vehicle-treated animals infected with the lower dose of MERS-CoV (Fig. 3c, left) , while more developed hyaline membranes (i.e., thick pink material lining alveoli) were observed in vehicle-treated animals infected with the higher dose of virus (Fig. 3c, right) . Importantly, the air spaces of RDV-treated animals infected with the lower dose of MERS-CoV (Fig. 3d, Fig. 4a) . Importantly, the kinetics of Mx1 gene expression in target organ of MERS-CoV, the lung, was similar in both Ces1c −/− and Ces1c −/− hDPP4 mice ( Supplementary  Fig. 4b) . Similarly, a single dose of IFNb significantly induced sustained expression (P < 0.05, two-way ANOVA with Sidek's multiple comparison test) of interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10, CXCL-10) in the serum of both strains of mice ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ). Thus, we observed an expected ISG response in the blood and lung tissue of both Ces1 −/− and Ces1 −/− hDPP4 mice following IFNb treatment. We then evaluated if LPV/RTV-IFNb prophylaxis could improve outcomes in Ces1 −/− hDPP4 mice infected with 5E + 04 pfu MERS-CoV. We compared vehicle (oral: propylene glycol and ethanol, subcutaneous: PBS) to three different treatment scenarios, including LPV/RTV-IFNb high (25x H.E.D. IFNb), LPV/RTV-IFNb low (1x H.E.D. IFNb), or IFNb-high alone (25x H. E.D. IFNb) (Fig. 4) . Prophylactic RDV and vehicle were included as controls. Since ISG expression peaks 2-4 h after IFNb administration ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ), we initiated IFNb dosing 2 h prior to MERS-CoV infection to maximize the potential antiviral effect. Similar to our previous studies, RDV (25 mg/kg, BID) or vehicle were administered subcutaneously every 12 h to obtain exposures in mice similar to that observed in humans 17 . The dosing levels and frequencies of LPV/RTV (oral once daily) and IFNb (subcutaneously every other day) were chosen to mirror those in the MIRACLE trial 27 . Unlike RDV-treated mice (Fig. 4a) , vehicle, LPV/RTV-IFNb, or IFNb alone did not prevent weight loss (Fig. 4b) . In fact, animals administered IFNb alone lost significantly more weight than vehicle (P = 0.01), LPV/RTV-IFNb high (P = 0.0001) and low (P = 0.006, all two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test) groups (Fig. 4b) . On 6 dpi, RDV treatment reduced virus lung titers the most (>3 log reduction, vehicle median = 1.4E + 05 pfu/lobe, RDV median = 50 pfu/lobe) (Fig. 4a) , while those in LPV/RTV-IFNb low treated were modestly reduced (~4-fold, median = 5.5E + 03 pfu/lobe) as compared with its vehicle (median = 2.3E + 04 pfu/lobe) (P = 0.04, two-way .

ANOVA with Sidek's multiple comparison test) (Fig. 4b) . Upon measuring pulmonary function by whole-body plethysmography (WBP), we found only RDV prophylaxis improved pulmonary function (Fig. 4a , b) (P = 0.002 to 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with Sidek's multiple comparison test). Interestingly, animals receiving IFNb-alone had significantly worse pulmonary function than companion groups at later times post infection (4-5 dpi, P = < 0.05, two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test). To determine if initiation time or dose level would affect outcomes in the IFNb only group, we performed a similar study but administered IFNb at a lower dose (i.e., 1x H.E.D.) 24 h prior to infection ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Alteration of IFNb dose or time of administration did not improve outcomes from those in Fig. 4 , and the modest improvement in virus titer seen with LPV/RTV-IFNb noted above was not observed. Taken together, prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb caused modest reductions in lung viral load in one of two studies, but had minimal impact on other disease metrics while IFNb alone did not impact virus replication and exacerbated disease. Therapeutic RDV reduces MERS-CoV replication and pathology. To more stringently assess the therapeutic potential of RDV and LPV/RTV-IFNb and to better model the human scenario where MERS-CoV patients most likely would initiate treatment after infection, we performed a series of therapeutic efficacy studies in mice. We initiated the following treatments in Ces1 −/− hDPP4 mice infected with 5E + 04 pfu MERS-CoV on 1 dpi: RDV or vehicle, LPV/RTV-IFNb low (1× human equivalent), LPV/RTV-IFNb high (25× human equivalent) or their vehicles. Dose route, amount, and frequency were similar to the prophylactic studies above. Only therapeutic RDV substantially reduced body weight loss (P = 0.019 to < 0.0001, two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test) (Fig. 5a, b) and lung hemorrhage on 6 dpi ( Fig. 5c ) (P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Kruskal-Wallis test). Similarly, only RDV treatment significantly reduced virus lung titers on 6 dpi (vehicle median 7.8E + 05 pfu/ lobe, RDV median 125 pfu/lobe, P = 0.0001, one-way ANOVA with Kruskal-Wallis test) (Fig. 5d) , which we corroborated with viral antigen labeling in lung tissue sections (Fig. 5e ). Similar Therapeutic RDV and LPV/RTV-IFNb improve pulmonary function. In the therapeutic antiviral efficacy studies described in Fig. 5 , we used WBP to assess pulmonary function (Fig. 6) . In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, RDV-treated animals had reduced flow rate at 50% of the expired volume (EF50) (P = 0.01, two-way ANOVA with Sidek's multiple comparison test), and PenH (P = 0.04, two-way ANOVA with Sidek's multiple comparison test), a surrogate measure of airway resistance/obstruction (Fig. 6a) 28 . Similarly, Rpef (the fraction of expiration before peak expiratory flow is reached), an indicator of bronchoconstriction, returned to baseline in RDV-treated animals by 5 dpi (P = 0.002, two-way ANOVA with Sidek's multiple comparison test) yet remained suppressed in vehicle-treated animals. Unlike the prophylactic study in Fig. 4b , therapeutic LPV + RTV-IFNb low improved pulmonary function as compared with vehicle with significantly reduced EF50 and PenH (P < 0.05, twoway ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test) and baseline levels of Rpef by 5 dpi (P < 0.05, two-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test) (Fig. 6b) . While therapeutic LPV/RTV-IFNb failed to reduce weight loss, lung hemorrhage, and virus titer, this regimen appears to provide improvements in pulmonary function similar to therapeutic RDV. Therapeutic RDV but not LPV/RTV-IFNb diminishes signs of ALI. We then quantitated the lung pathology in therapeutically treated animals (Fig. 7) . In lung tissue sections from the 6 dpi, we blindly evaluated and scored features of ALI using three different and complementary approaches. In Fig. 7a , we show reduced ALI with RDV treatment. Although sporadic apoptotic cells and alveolar septal wall thickening (~2-4-fold over mock) driven by immune cell infiltration were observed in the lungs of mice treated with therapeutic RDV, the air spaces remained predominantly free of cellular debris and inflammatory cells similar to mock-infected animals (Fig. 7a) . In contrast, multiple pathological features typical of ALI were noted in both vehicle groups (RDV and LPV/RTV vehicles) as well as both LPV/RTV-IFNb low and high, including altered alveolar architecture due to pneumocyte degeneration and death, numerous inflammatory cells in the septae and in alveolar air spaces, neutrophils in the air spaces, and proteinaceous debris in the air spaces organizing into hyaline membranes (Fig. 7a ). Using the ATS ALI scoring tool described in Fig. 3 , we found that only RDV therapy significantly (P = 0.005, one-way ANOVA with Kruskal-Wallis test) decreased lung injury scores (Fig. 7b) . With a complementary histological tool, we then quantitated features of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), the pathological hallmark of ALI 26 . We found that only therapeutic RDV reduced DAD scores (P = 0.04, oneway ANOVA with Kruskal-Wallis test) (Fig. 7c) 29 . Since degree of cell death appeared to correlate with protective efficacy, we quantitated levels of cleaved caspase-3 in lung tissue sections by antibody labeling. Caspase-3, a widely accepted marker of apoptosis, is a regulatory enzyme whose cleavage and activation drive programmed cell death 30 . Using the Definiens software suite, we obtained unbiased quantitative data showing that only RDV treatment significantly reduced levels of cleaved caspase-3 antigen (P = 0.0109, one-way ANOVA with Kruskal-Wallis test) (Fig. 7d) . Thus, using three complementary and blinded approaches, we obtained similar data showing that only therapeutic RDV reduced histologic features of ALI.
