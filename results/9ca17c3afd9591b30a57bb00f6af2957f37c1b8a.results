The Table 2 . The PToV positive rates at different growth stages of pigs revealed that 1 to 3 week old piglets have the highest PToV infection rate 42.47% (296/697), with PToV infection rates of 25.53% (24/94), 16.07% (9/56) and 8% (2/25) in 3 to 7 weeks, 7 to 11 weeks and over 11 weeks, respectively. The complete M sequence of 42 of the 331 PToV-positive strains were amplified and sequenced. Of the 42 PToV strains, 19 strains were selected, based on geographic factors and their isolation from different farms in the same district. The complete M gene sequences of the 19 strains were compared with each other, and against reference sequences for 21 strains of toroviruses in the GenBank database ( Table 3) . As shown in Figure 2 , phylogenetic and homology studies at the nucleotide (702 bp) level demonstrated that PToV strains belonged to two genotypes (I and II), separated with bootstrap values of 90 and 60, respectively. All 19 novel PToV strains within genotype I were further divided into three genotypes (A, B and C). Meishan
