We designed a Taq-Man style hydrolysis probe incorporating fluorophore (FAM) and quencher (Iowa Black) which doubles as a 3′ end blocker. Successful amplification leads to probe cleavage by Endonuclease IV (nfo) at the abasic site, separating FAM from the quencher and yielding detectable signal. Earlier work used a quencher and FAM internally, proximal to the abasic site [10] ; our design simplifies this by using the quencher as a 3′ end blocker (Fig. 1a) . To assess assay sensitivity we ran a serial dilution of DNA derived from mef(A)-positive Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M6 strain MGAS10394 [39] and found that confident detection was around 2000 genome copies (Fig. 1b) . Two-thousand genome copies corresponds to 4.3 picograms (pg) of DNA, at a concentration of 252 femtomolar (fM). While the FAM signal crosses the threshold for 200, 20, and 2 genome copies, these signals are probably nonspecific as demonstrated by negative controls showing similar late-rising (around 20 min or later) signal (Figs. 2b, c, and 5). We conclude that the confident sensitivity limit of our assay is approximately 2000 genome copies, and that detection must be recorded before 16 min to be considered real. The non-specific 18-20-min signal was always easily distinguishable from real detection in our assays, which always came up quickly, around 7-10 min (compare Figs. 2b, c, and 5). We suggest the late-rising signal is analogous to qPCR's tendency to ubiquitously amplify even no-template controls by 40 cycles. We performed SYBR green based qPCR on the same DNA dilution series using the same primers, and observed even greater sensitivity-relatively confidently down to 20 genome copies-but it was significantly slower -the run took over 2 h (Fig. 1c) . As discussed later, the 2000 genome copy threshold may help distinguish diagnostically meaningful mef(A) gene loads, rather than mere colonizers [40] . We next performed specificity testing with raw bacterial lysates from eight bacterial strains. Mef(A) is present within the genomes of Group A Strep strain S. pyogenes MGAS10394 [39] and S. pneumoniae strains GA17457 and GA16242. Known mef(A) negative strains include S. pyogenes MGAS6180 [41] responsible for necrotizing fasciitis and puerperal sepsis, Enterococcus faecium Strain 513, S. pneumoniae strain NP112, and S. agalactiae SGBS025. Streptococcus agalactiae is resistant to macrolides by a different mechanism than mef(A): it hosts a target-site ribosomal methylase, ermB. Methylation of the target site in the 23S rRNA by ermB inhibits the interaction of antibiotic with the ribosome [42] . We therefore predicted-and confirmed-that this species would show an absence of mef(A) by RPA but nonetheless display robust resistance to erythromycin (Fig. 4g ). Finally, we tested a patient isolate of S. salivarius with an unknown mef(A) status. The identities of S. salivarius, S. agalactiae, and S. pyogenes strains were confirmed by sequencing the 16 s rDNA locus. We developed a simple raw lysis method. Individual bacterial colonies were inoculated into BHI media for overnight incubation at 37°C, followed by lysis by boiling at 95°C for 3 minutes and 100-fold dilution into sterile H 2 O. RPA was performed directly on this raw lysate (Fig. 2a) . We tested eight bacterial strains in total: S. pyogenes (2 strains), S. agalactiae, S. salivarius, S. pneumoniae (3 strains), and E. faecium. RPA confirmed the presence of mef(A) within all known positive strains and none of the known negatives (Fig. 2b, c) . RPA indicated the presence of mef(A) within S. salivarius, an unexpected result (Fig. 2b) . While we had not expected this commensal species to contain mef(A), we nevertheless performed PCR which confirmed the gene's presence in MGAS10394 and S. salivarius (Fig. 3a) . By Sanger sequencing this product we observed that the S. salivarius gene has three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (Fig. 3b) , suggesting that it has acquired a more divergent copy of the gene and confirming that the detections constitute independent mef(A) genes, not cross contamination. To test whether the mef(A) gene is functional, we performed broth dilution of both strains of S. pyogenes, S. salivarius, and S. agalactiae with erythromycin and ampicillin (a negative control) (Fig. 4) . This confirmed that S. pyogenes MGAS10394, S. agalactiae, and S. salivarius are all resistant to erythromycin (MIC greater than or equal to 3.2 μg/ml, Table 2 ) and MGAS6180 is susceptible (Fig. 4) . As reported by others, ermB gives stronger erythromycin resistance than mef(A) [43, 44] , with S. agalactiae giving a MIC > 3.2 μg/ml ( Table 2 ). All tested strains were susceptible to ampicillin as expected (Fig. 4, Table 2 ). To evaluate assay specificity we constructed mixtures of nucleic acids as follows: A, B, and C contain 20 ng of DNA from non-mef(A) lysates (S. agalactiae plus MGAS6180) either by themselves (C) or spiked with 1.7 ng (A) or 0.34 ng (B) of MGAS10394 (mef(A)-positive). Mixes A and B represent 7.8 and 1.7% mef(A) positive, respectively. Mixes D and E tested the effect of human DNA, which might be expected to contaminate clinical samples. We therefore tested either 450 ng human DNA alone (D) or with 4.5 ng (1%) of mef(A)-positive MGAS10394 lysate (E). None of the non-specific DNA had any apparent effect on the reactions, with only E, A, and B giving specific signal and in proportion to the total mef(A) gene present in the samples (4.5 ng, 1.7 ng, and 0.34 ng, respectively) (Fig. 5) . The mef(A)-negative C and D samples yielded no specific signal, giving non-specific time-to-threshold of 19.1 and 19.6 min, respectively (Fig. 5) . Not only do these results show that the RPA assay was 100% specific and quantitative in the presence of non-specific DNA, but also functions with a wide range of total DNA in the mixture (from a few picograms, Fig. 1b, to 450 ng, Fig. 5 ), and is robust to the conditions of raw lysate including denatured proteins, lipids, and cell wall debris.
