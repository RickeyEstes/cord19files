Detection of EV-D68 from NPAs. A total of 6800 NPAs were subject to EV detection by RT-PCR and sequencing of partial 5â€² UTR region. Samples positive for EVs were then subject to EV-D68 detection by RT-PCR and sequencing of VP1 region using EV-D68-specific primers. VP1 gene analysis showed that 30 (0.44%) NPAs were positive for EV-D68. The annual incidence rates were 0.27% (4/1500), 0.4% (6/1500), 0.62% (8/1300), 0.46% (6/1300) and 0.5% (6/1200) in year 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively (Fig. 1) . The peak season of EV-D68 usually occurred in late-spring/summer (May to August), except in 2011 when more cases were detected in late-autumn/early-winter (October to December).
