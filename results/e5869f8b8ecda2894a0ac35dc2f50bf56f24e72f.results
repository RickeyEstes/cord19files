Twenty-three journalists were approached. Three declined; three did not respond; and one interview recording failed. Sixteen interviews were analysed. The journalists were senior with a median of 14AE5 years in journalism (range: 5-37 years). Most had worked for multiple organisations and in differing roles although they usually continued in the one medium, for example, print. Ten were reporters and six were producers or editors. Seven of the 16 journalists were specialist health ⁄ medical reporters. An analysis of their roles and general reporting practices is reported elsewhere. 19 Why did journalists initially cover this story? Participants generally perceived three criteria as giving news value to avian influenza: it was potentially apocalyptic; it was perceived as 'close' to Australians; and trusted people in positions of authority were worried about it. These three criteria map closely to well-known factors that predict increases in perceptions of risk: catastrophic potential; unfamiliarity and uncertainty; salience; and trust in public figures. 20, 21 Journalists emphasised that the flu story was captivating because it predicted a potential catastrophe. It's not just the mystery, it's that potential for it to be diabolical as well. (Television news reporter) The story increased in prominence because journalists viewed avian influenza as coming closer to Australia. Geographical proximity gave the story relevance as avian influenza spread through South-East Asian neighbours, and poultry culls and human deaths were reported in Indonesia and Thailand. However, a sense of cultural proximity could also give the story relevance: It's like it hit Europe, or it hit Germany -that was like a step, like a doorstep that had been crossed or something. It's…I think also, it being in Indonesia, a lot of Australians have been to Indonesia, it's very close to us and people suddenly think 'oh-oh, it's close'. (Television news reporter) The degree of public trust and respect vested in the sources for the story gave it both importance and credibility. Concern expressed by authorities such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), government health officers and ministers, and independent, scientific experts -those who traditionally enjoy the highest levels of public trustguaranteed the story public coverage. Most journalists felt they were simply broadcasting the concern of these officials. It really is the public health people and governments who are kind of creating the momentum for that public interest. We are in a sense fuelling it, but at the same time, we are just reporting on it. (Newspaper medical reporter) Why did the story lose its newsworthiness? By April 2006, news coverage of avian influenza had tapered off dramatically, despite the continued potential for a pandemic. The primary determinant of this was a lack of novelty in the story; the topic was perceived as stale, and competition within the media made novelty a premier requirement for coverage. Some also perceived avian influenza as a 'false alarm' that no longer justified news time. They expressed a degree of cynicism that the promised pandemic had failed to eventuate and was hence no longer worthy of attention. Next time I hear people talking about bird flu or anything like it, I will pay less attention -bit like crying wolf. (Newspaper editor) There has been a lot of hyperbole. The world is going to end, everyone is going to die, so I think people are just bored by it now. (Newspaper medical reporter) This was much more evident from general journalists. Specialist medical reporters conveyed a greater understanding of the uncertainty inherent in predicting a pandemic. What did the story require to regain newsworthiness? Even though media coverage had waned, the spread of avian influenza and bird to human infections continued to occur. Nevertheless, journalists were bald in stating that events would have to 'up the ante' for the story to regain news coverage. Within the context of avian influenza as it existed in 2007, this could only occur if a particularly startling human drama such as a large cluster of deaths or a significant scientific or technological development occurred, or, for television reporters, if particularly poignant images of death or grief became available. …say the family, say a kid has died or something. People killing heaps of chooks; a hospital where somebody has been admitted; a laboratory where some tests have been carried out -just all of those [visual] elements can make a story. (Television news producer) I'm just looking on the wires, there is a woman from Surabaya critically ill. Now unless we had pictures of it, we probably wouldn't -I mean that could be a reason why they may not cover it. (Television news reporter) A renewal of media attention would only be generated by one of two events -human-to-human transmission or entry of the virus into Australia. What issues did the journalists cover during avian influenza? Besides reporting deaths and poultry culls internationally, journalists' focus was very strongly on the potential for pharmaceutical and technological responses to a potential pandemic. This strong focus left less room for coverage of community reactions, community preparedness, government preparedness planning, or public health actions centring on behaviours. Few would speak of public health measures like social distancing, quarantine, border control or personal protective equipment -all prominent in the government's pandemic plan. Although our respondents' focus on pharmaceutical solutions may in part have reflected the information they received from health experts, it also reflected their perception that biomedical developments were more newsworthy. We may have reported on covering your nose when you sneeze, but I think the medical solutions perhaps are the ones we need to have, should there be an eruption that is difficult to contain. (Television news producer) I think the job of the media is to get as much hard factual information out about the danger; precautions you need to take; what you should do if you have the symptoms; how you get hold of the antiviral medication or vaccine or the reporting on those sort of factual things, and I think the speedy and efficient delivery of that information to the press will be most important in controlling any public panic that surrounds an outbreak of the pandemic. (Newspaper medical reporter) What is revealing in this statement is an unquestioned deference towards pharmacological solutions, and their perceived capacity to mitigate 'public panic'. For example, one television producer spoke of covering biomedical solutions as a response to his own sense of obligation to reassure the public, after having raised a degree of fear in reporting the pandemic threat. How did journalists perceive the accuracy of reporting on avian influenza? Participants in this study acknowledged the constraints of reporting, particularly the short time frames in daily news reporting. On one axis you have maximum accuracy, integrity, detail -all of those wonderful things. And then on the other one you've got time. (Newspaper medical reporter) These constraints and, for non-medical reporters, a lack of familiarity with scientific terms could impact on the quality of reporting. In a period of media interest, such as an outbreak, junior or generalist reporters with little prior knowledge of the issues are assigned to the story, increasing the risk of inaccurate coverage. Having experts available to check stories was seen as a primary means of ameliorating this problem, along with encouraging health experts to provide clear, simple information in the first place. Academics in particular need to accept that the reporters they will be talking to during a pandemic will not always be reasonably well-informed science or health journalists but could be a general reporter. They need to pare their message down to its basics -especially in a crisis. No reporter has time for long-winded background. (Newspaper medical reporter) On the other hand specialist medical reporters felt themselves to be highly informed and sophisticated in their coverage. One reporter commented on how 'invaluable' it was when reporters were invited to spend a day at a seminar, where they learned facts such as the number and characteristics of influenza strains. By the end of the day this journalist felt her understanding of the science to be solid and extensive, much better than 'most average punters'. Medical journalists played a leadership role in shaping media coverage, and acted as 'gatekeepers' for which stories were let in and which were excluded, influencing the quality of coverage. A mistake gets repeated again and again and again…So any specialist reporter will put out a national note, saying 'attention all, please ensure this is correct'. (Radio news reporter) Some reporters were also concerned about the ability of the mass media to represent the complexity of infectious diseases. Others, however, were committed to offering sophisticated discussion of the issue -but their ability to do so was constrained by the audience and specific media organisation they worked for. I do tend to put as much detail into the stories as I can, and try to be faithful to the people who I'm presenting -which often means [managers] don't like me because it's a bit too complex, you know. But I find the listener out there goes 'well I find them intelligent stories' so there is a bit of a divide between what managers think the public want to hear on the radio. (Radio news reporter) How did journalists perceive their role in an outbreak situation? Journalists were placed in a dilemma when contemplating their response to a significant outbreak of influenza. They articulated a clear commitment to their roles as journalists: as public informants, independent and neutral -yet they also wished to support the public interests and efforts of public health officials. In envisaging a crisis event, some acknowledged that concerns about creating public panic or harmful public reactions would have an influence on the content, angle and style of their reporting. They perceived the speedy delivery of factual information as a premier tool in preventing public panic. I always tried to say in my story that there had been these deaths overseas, but none here, kind of thing. I try to be well rounded, because we didn't want to scare people more than some people were already scared. (Newspaper medical reporter) Some journalists expressed a less qualified perception of their role as public critics and investigators. Much as they intended to work in tacit support of governments handling a crisis event, they resisted the role of publicising the government agenda, and were wary of being exploited by either government or commercial interests. In particular, the more experienced medical reporters valued their independence and capacity for generating and maintaining discussions critical of government actions. (One commented drily, 'The media is not the public relations wing of the health department.') However, we note that despite this stated commitment, in practice, in crisis situations journalists are often either too much taken up with the outlook of those whose views they report or too busy to take a critical stance. See for example a critique of the reporting of air quality issues in the lower Manhattan district after 9 ⁄ 11. 22 In keeping with their strong commitment to their role as public informants, journalists were adamant that they would continue to work in a pandemic situation despite the dangers to themselves, although journalists with dependent family were more cautious. Journalists stated that competitive concerns and hence job insecurity might motivate them to continue to work. None were aware of any pandemic planning undertaken by their media organisation.
