The basic demographic data, clinical characteristics and influenza vaccination status of study participants are presented in Table 1 . The median age of NH residents was 84, 72 % of residents were female. The majority (97 %) of residents had comorbidities. At the beginning of the study, on December 5th, 2011, 42 staff members (33 healthy, nine with ARI) and 90 NH residents (only one with ARI) were tested for the presence of viruses in a nasopharyngeal swab. The predominant virus, detected in participants with ARI as well as in healthy participants, was hRV/EV (Table 2) . Of 132 participants, 14 (13 residents and one member of staff ) did not complete the 6-month study; the median followup in this subgroup was 79 (interquartile range: 27-123) days. In the nursing staff group, one of the nurses had a complicated pregnancy and was unable to work from the 127th day after the beginning of the study. During the study period, 12 NH residents died and one resident refused to attend the final testing.
