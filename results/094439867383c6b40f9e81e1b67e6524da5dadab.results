We added 1248 nucleotides to the previously published dataset and analysed a total of 3031 nucleotides (including gaps). We used primers that bound to a more conserved region of COI and thus reduced the previously published COI sequences (Mardulyn and WhitWeld, 1999) from 1235 nucleotides to 419 nucleotides that were homologous with our sequences. Levels of variation between species and genera for the seven genes diVered with 28S, arginine kinase, EF1 , opsin and wingless diverging more slowly than 16S and COI, which quickly saturated at the generic level (Fig. 1) . The ILD test found 17 of the 21 pairwise comparisons of the genes were signiWcantly incongruent (P 6 0.01). The four comparisons that were not signiWcantly incongruent were 28S to arginine kinase, EF1 and wingless, and EF1 to 16S. Six of the seven comparisons of individual genes to the rest of the combined molecular data (with each individual gene excluded) revealed signiWcant diVerences (P D 0.01). The exception was arginine kinase, which was not signiWcantly heterogeneous with the combined data (P D 0.6). The 2 test of sequence stationarity in PAUP* found there was signiWcant heterogeneity in nucleotide proportions. A nonsigniWcant result was obtained when the third positions of codons in protein coding genes were excluded. A maximum parsimony analysis of all seven genes for all taxa found three equally parsimonious trees of length 6861; consistency index, excluding uninformative characters D 0.30; retention index D 0.44 from 3031 characters of which 1494 were constant and 1207 were parsimony informative. The strict consensus tree of the three most parsimonious trees is shown in Fig. 2. A MP analysis found a single most parsimonious tree when third positions were excluded (result not shown) that was broadly congruent with the MP tree estimated from all positions (Fig. 2) . Excluding third positions did not appreciably alter bootstrap support values obtained with MP, as 15 branches still had bootstrap support of less than 50%. Deleting third positions altered relationships found by MP within more recently diverged clades, but most deep and mid level relationships were not altered. The exception was that Choeras was placed as sister to Sendaphne and Promicrogaster, rather than with Fornicia and Deuterixys, when third positions were excluded, a more reasonable result based on morphology. Both MP and Bayesian methods (Figs. 2 and 3 ) supported Microgastrinae as a monophyletic group. Both methods found broadly similar relationships. However, the placement of Fornicia diVered greatly depending on the Fig. 1 . Average uncorrected pairwise distances between microgastrine species and genera, and braconid subfamilies for the seven genes sequenced. Arginine kinase (Argk), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1 ), opsin and wingless are the genes added to the original dataset of Mardulyn and WhitWeld (1999) and WhitWeld (2002). We were unable to get sequences from three genes for Fornicia, and it is possible that missing data are causing the two methods to diVer in their placement of Fornicia. The numbers of branches with high or low levels of support diVered slightly for the phylogenies estimated using MP and Bayes. Maximum parsimony had 14 branches with bootstrap support of less than 50%, whereas the Bayesian tree had 10 branches with posterior probability values of less than 0.9. There was no obvious trend for branches to have higher Bayesian posterior probabilities than MP bootstrap support values. Some branches were supported with posterior probabilities higher than 0.9 but had low bootstrap support, while some branches that had posterior probabilities much less than 0.9 received high bootstrap support values. For example, grouping Hypomicrogaster ecdytolophae and Parapanteles sp. as sisters received a bootstrap value of 79% but had a posterior probability of 0.56. It must of course be kept in mind that in these comparisons, both the branch support measure and the optimality criterion for tree estimation diVer. The LogDet analysis found a single tree (result not shown) that was broadly congruent with both the MP and Bayesian trees. Nine nodes had bootstrap support of less than 50% (similar to the other methods). Nodes in the Log-Det tree that diVered from the MP and Bayesian trees did not have high levels of bootstrap support.
