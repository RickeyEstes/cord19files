We have injected carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) at escalating concentrations into 15 BALB/c mice to find the dose that caused a sublethal liver necrosis. It was found that the administration of 0.16 µl of CCl 4 in 100 µl of mineral oil raised the serum levels of aspartate amino transferase (AST) 50-100 times over control 24 h after the injection [16] , whereas the animals stayed alive for at least a month (data not shown). Mice were bled 24 h and 20 days after the CCl 4 administration, and the sera were assayed for total IgG by ELISA and autoantibodies (autoAb) by Western-blot as described before [9] . Serum IgG did not differ from control values and CCl 4 did not induce autoAb to mouse liver or kidney extracts detectable by Western-blot (data not shown). After 30 days of MHV-infection, as reported previously [9] , AST and IgG levels in serum were normal, although autoAb to liver FAH were still present in most samples. Thus, to explore the effect of CCl 4 in mice virally infected, we injected CCl 4 30 days after the viral inoculation. One day after the CCl 4 injection, IgG values, expressed as serum dilution to give an OD value of 1.0, were slightly higher in the group "MHV alone" (228,000 ± 85,000) than in mice non infected and not exposed to CCl 4 (100,000 ± 64,000) or in the group "MHV + CCl 4 " (118,000 ± 67,000) (Fig. 1A) . By contrast, 20 days after the CCl 4 injection, the sera from the group "MHV + CCl 4 " contained significantly higher levels of IgG (400,000 ± 128,000) than noninfected and non-CCl 4 -exposed mice (100,000 ± 72,000) or the group "MHV alone" (170 000 ± 78 000) (Fig. 1B) . As already mentioned, no increase in IgG concentration was observed after 24 h or 20 days of CCl 4 treatment alone (Fig. 1A,B) . Western-blots revealed autoAb to liver and kidney extracts in the group "MHV + CCl 4 ". The various bands of autoantigens were designated according to their relative mobility (RM) versus the IgG heavy and light chains (values of 1 and 0, respectively) present in the tissue extracts ( Fig. 2A) . Representative results from two mice are presented in Fig. 2B . Table 1 presents the RM values for 11 mice "MHV+ CCl 4 " and seven "MHV alone". Whereas sera from the "MHV+ CCl 4 " group contained autoAb to different liver and kidney antigens, the autoAb of the "MHV alone" group recognized only liver or kidney FAH (Table 1 ). In the three groups, "MHV + CCl 4 ", "MHV alone", and "CCl 4 alone", histology of the liver, 20 days after the CCl 4 injection and 50 days after MHV inoculation, showed the following damages: cell swelling, necrosis, and hydropic and hepatocellular degeneration (Fig. 3) . However, neither infiltrating cells nor fibrosis were detected, and close examination of several liver samples did not find significant differences in the damage extent between the group "MHV+ CCl 4 " and Table 1 ); B: serum from mouse #15 "MHV alone" (see RM values in Table 1 ). Positions of the IgG heavy and light chains are indicated as 1 and 0, respectively, on the left side of each blot.
