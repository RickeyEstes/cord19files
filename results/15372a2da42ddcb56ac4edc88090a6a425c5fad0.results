There were 234 children, one from each study family, progressively enrolled in the study and we identified 730 ARIs in 56,397 child-days of follow-up [19] . Of these, 487 ARIs (67%) had at least one specimen and an impact diary available, 41 (6%) had an impact diary returned but no specimen, 56 (8%) had at least one specimen returned but no impact diary available, and 146 (20%) had neither a specimen nor impact diary returned. Children aged between one and two-years of age contributed the most person-time to the study (28% of all child-days) and had the highest acute respiratory illness (ARI) incidence rate (0.56 ARIs per child-month). Contribution by males and females was equivalent, and children who attended some form of out-of-home care were responsible for 67% of all person-time [19] . The 523 illnesses with a diary returned that did not involve a hospital admission had a total cost of $161,454 (Table 2) , and mean cost of $309 (95% CI $263 to $354). As our particular interest is in the cost of communitymanaged ARIs, that is, those illnesses that do not require The mean and median costs by virus identification, including co-identification and specimen availability, are provided ( Table 2 ). The differences between the mean values and the median values demonstrate the right-skewed nature of these data, similar to other health-related costs [27] . Whilst confidence intervals overlap, the point estimate of the mean cost of an influenza A ARI, $904, is three times higher than the next most expensive single virus ARI: RSV $304. Of the 51 ARIs where more than one virus was identified, influenza A virus was present in four: two illnesses with co-identification with a picornavirus alone, one illness with hCoV-NL63 alone, and one illness with a picornavirus and PIV. These four illnesses had a mean cost of $499. There were no illnesses where influenza B virus was identified. Three children had received influenza vaccine in the year prior to the study and none had an influenza-positive ARI. As the difference in mean cost between the most expensive (RSV: $304) and least expensive (hMPV: $219) noninfluenza single virus ARI falls within a comparatively narrow band ($85) we collapsed these data into a single category for further comparisons ( There was little difference in the mean duration of influenza A illnesses and other single virus illnesses, but coidentifications were 2.2 and 3.6 days longer than each of these respectively ( Table 4 ). The mean delay between illness onset and a result letter being sent was shortest in influenza illnesses at 6.3 days (Table 4 ).
