Samples were obtained from a total of 104 calves. From these, samples from 95 calves, representing 85 dairy herds, were used for laboratory and statistical analyses. Exclusion of samples was due to failure of isolating E. coli (no growth or overgrowth by Proteus spp). Of the 95 calves, 56 were diagnosed as having diarrhea. All information about the herds was collected by the questionnaire used at the farm visit. However, all questions were not always fully answered for all herds, hence there are a varying number of missing values for the variables included in this study. The participating 85 herds were located in all geographical regions of Sweden with significant cattle population and had a median herd size of 80 lactating cows (50% central range (CR): 40 -140 cows). The calves were of both the Swedish red and white breed (n = 51) and of the Swedish Holstein breed (n = 42). Forty-four of the calves were heifer calves and 49 were bull calves. The calves were separated from Range of concentrations tested and cut-off values for resistance are indicated. MICs equal to or lower than the lowest concentration tested are given as the lowest tested concentration. MICs above the range of concentrations tested are given as the concentration closest to the range. MICs above the cut-off value for resistance are given in bold lettering. de Verdier et al.

Calf group feeder was used in 36 of the herds. On average 1.7 calf (50% CR: 0 -3 calves) and 8.8 calves (50% CR: 5 -10 calves) out of the 20 latest born calves had had diarrhoea in herds with CD-calves and CD+, respectively. In herds with CD-calves 0.5 calf of the 20 latest born calves (50% CR: 0 -1) had died, and in herds with CD+ calves 1.4 calves of the 20 latest born calves (50% CR: 0 -2) had died. Twenty-three of the CD+ calves were diagnosed with diarrhoea in the first 10 days after birth, 13 calves were diagnosed 11-21 days after birth, and 19 calves 22-135 days after birth. In the same periods 11, 18 and 10 of the CD-calves were sampled. Of the diarrhoeic calves 70% had soft diarrhoea, 21% watery diarrhoea and 9% had blood in the faeces. Twenty-four percent of the calves were sampled one day after the onset of diarrhoea, 33% two days after, 40% three days after, and 3% 6-14 days after. The general appearance was affected in 56% of the CD+ calves (43.6% "slightly to moderately"; 12.7% "severely"). None of the CD-calves had an affected general appearance. Only 9% of all participating calves had respiratory symptoms, and these were all CD + calves. In 32% of the herds dihydrostreptomycin tablets (DHS) were occasionally used to treat diarrhoea, and in 44% of the herds other antimicrobials were used occasionally or often to treat diarrhoea. E. coli was isolated in samples from all participating calves. One isolate from each calf (n = 95) was analysed for antimicrobial susceptibility and 94 isolates for occurrence of 10 virulence genes. Moreover, 48 isolates (13 from calves with diarrhoea) were analysed for 30 additional virulence factors.
