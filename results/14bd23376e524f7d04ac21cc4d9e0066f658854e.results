The first paediatric SARS patient was admitted on 13 March. From this date until 23 June, nine patients with probable SARS and 29 patients with suspected SARS were admitted into the UHR-S area. The mean and standard deviation (SD) age for these two groups were 8.9 (6.2) years and 7.4 (5.4) years, respectively. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of probable SARS patients are summarized in Table III . Another 88 febrile children and adolescents with pneumonia but no SARS contact, with a mean (SD) age of 8.2 (5.3) years, were admitted into the isolation cubicle of the UHR-I area. Two hundred and twenty-seven patients with febrile illnesses but normal chest radiographs, at a mean (SD) age of 4.9 (5.1) years, were managed in an open cubicle in the UHR-I area. In addition, 274 nonfebrile patients aged 7.5 (6.0) years were admitted into the HR area. Eleven non-febrile patients initially admitted to the HR area were subsequently transferred (two for fever and pneumonia and nine for febrile non-respiratory illnesses) to the UHR-I area during their inpatient stay. During this three-month period, four doctors were assigned to manage patients in the UHR-S area, and 19 were responsible for patients in the other areas. Among the other staff, there were 17 nurses, one ward clerk and four healthcare assistants in the UHR-S ward; 16 nurses, one ward clerk and three healthcare assistants in the UHR-I ward and 18 nurses, one ward clerk and six healthcare assistants in the HR area. Also during the SARS outbreak at PWH, the paediatric surgical and orthopaedic wards were closed in order to redeploy HCWs to the SARS wards of the hospital. As from 9 April, all patients in these wards were moved to the paediatric HR area. With this arrangement, 24 medical staff from various paediatric surgical subspecialties also worked in the paediatric HR area. A total of 26 HCWs were in close contact 4 with patients with probable or suspected SARS in the UHR-S area and 88 medical and para-medical staff had contact with patients in the other areas. None of the medical and para-medical staff in this department developed symptoms or signs suggestive of clinical SARS infection. No patient or visitor acquired SARS during their hospitalization, or during their visit to the paediatric wards.
