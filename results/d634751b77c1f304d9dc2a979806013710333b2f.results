In order to construct a novel type of internally quenched library, we used different monoprotected heterobifunctional PEG moieties to diversify a library based on a diaminopropionic acid scaffold ( Fig. 1 presents the library formula and its chemical components). The library was synthesized using the mix and split method via Fmoc chemistry. The formation of Dap-PEG conjugates was performed on resin via a submonomeric method (one example of DAPEG-based molecule synthesis is presented in Fig. 2 ). Our goal was to investigate P2, P3, and P4 subsite preferences with a fixed P1 position occupied by an Arg residue. Each peptide in the library was flanked by a C-terminal amide of 5-amino-2-nitrobenozic acid (acceptor of fluorescence) and an N-terminal 2-amino benzoic acid (fluorescence donor) pair which allowed for simultaneous UV and fluorescence monitoring. Screening process was performed using an iterative mode of deconvolution in solution. The 18 sublibraries with fixed X 4 positions were incubated with NSP4. The highest hydrolysis rate of the Arg-ANB-NH 2 bond was observed for diaminopropionic acid modified by carbobenzyloxy-protected amino polyethylene glycols Dap(O2(Cbz)) and Dap(O1(Cbz) (Fig. 3A ) followed by the remaining amino acid residues -Dap and the Cbz-protected analog (Dap(Cbz)) and methyl ether of Ser. A relatively high rate of proteolysis was also observed of methyl ether derived PEG chains with supremacy of the longer Dap(MO2) chain -Insignificant output was observed for acidic residues despite side chain length. Considering the above findings, in next our step deconvolution of Dap(O2(Cbz)) was included yielding the ABZ-Dap(O2(Cbz))-X 3 -X 2 -Arg-ANB-NH 2 library. Next, 18 sublibraries with randomized X 3 position were analyzed. In assayed position, the most intense proteolysis was observed for compounds with short side chain amino acid residues -Dap(Cbz), Dap and Agp (Fig. 3B ). The highest rate of hydrolysis was observed for the residue with aromatic ring present on its side chain -Dap(Cbz). Other residues were poorly processed by NSP4 with 3-4 times lower hydrolysis rate. Importantly, the proteolytic efficacy of the best sublibrary was three times greater than the most potent residue found for the Incubation of each of 18 peptides modified at position X 2 with NSP4 indicated that Dap analogs substituted by PEG chains displayed the highest fluorescent intensity (Fig. 3C ). Within this set, the PEG chain with guanidinium group was processed at the highest rate. Low proteolysis was observed for the set of short-chained amino acid -Dap, Dap(Cbz), Agp or Asp with the only exception being Ser and its methyl ether. The sequence ABZ-Dap(O2 (Cbz))-Dap(Cbz)-Dap(GO1)-Arg-ANB-NH 2 (further abbreviated as substrate 1) was selected as most susceptible for NSP4-mediated proteolysis. A mass spectrometry quality check was performed at all stages of library deconvolution and all library components were identified within the HR MS spectra (Fig. S1 ). Similar analyses were performed for randomly selected sublibraries for each assayed position (X 4 , X 3 and X 2 ) identifying all signals corresponding to [MW+ H] + or its sodium/potassium adducts (Figs S9, S10 and S11). The obtained substrate 1 was characterized in order to verify its chemical composition and sequence. The HPLC and MS analysis of substrate 1 indicated a purity > 98% and a molecular weight equal to 1271.34. Formation of a well-defined y-ion series was observed following MS/MS fragmentation (see Figs S2 and S3), and these, together with the ions originating from Cbz loss/cleavage fully validated the structure of substrate 1. The structure of substrate 1 was further validated using the 2D 1 HNMR method (details are provided in Supplementary Material, Figs S4, S5 and S6). Incubation of substrate 1 (t R = 24.96, MW 1271.34) with hNSP4 ( Fig. 4 ) resulted in cleavage of the peptide bond located between Arg and ANB-NH 2 . The fluorescent fragment, ABZ-Dap(O2(Cbz))-Dap(Cbz)-Dap(GO 1)-Arg-OH (t R = 23.46, MW 1108.21), lacking its C-terminal quencher group, was no further degraded up to 48 h under the conditions of our assay (Fig. 4) . Kinetic parameters. The obtained substrate 1 displayed high affinity (expressed as K M reaching 7.6 × 10 −6 M) and moderate k cat value of 1 s −1 , and its specificity parameter value reached 1.3 × 10 5 M −1 × s −1 (Fig. S7 ). Selectivity. The incubation of substrate 1 with neutrophil serine proteinases (CatG, HNE, or PR3) at a concentration of 10 −8 M produced no visible proteolysis (see Fig. 5A ). Analogous experiment with set of proteases related to blood cells, including cathepsins and kallikreins, revealed that the developed substrate is susceptible to
