The morphology of MDBK cells infected with cpBVDV (NADL) was practically indistinguishable from mock-infected control cells up to 6 h post-infection. However, by 16 and 24 h after infection, about 15 and 25% of total number of cells, respectively, were found to have extensive vacuolization of cytoplasm ( Fig. 1A and B ). In addition, by 24 h post-infection, vacuolized cells started to round up and detach, suggesting that virus-induced dynamic cellular pathology in whole population of cells have to be investigated within first 24 h. By 24-36 h post-infection, about 50% of monolayers in all wells inspected for this study were partially destroyed. Further incubation of infected cells beyond 36 h post-infection resulted in a significant number of detached cells, making it difficult to determine the mode of the cell death. Infection of MDBK cells with the noncytopathic strain of BVDV (NY-1) did not result in cytoplasmic vacuolization or disruption of the cellular monolayer ( Fig. 1A ). In addition, ncpBVDV-infected MDBK cells could be easily cultured without any morphological signs of infection. Infection of FBK cells with NADL also resulted in appearance of vacuolized cells, which were not observed in uninfected cells (data not shown). Infection of MDBK cells with cpBVDV was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody to viral NS3 protein 24 h post-infection (Fig. 2, right panel) . Cells which stained for the viral protein also showed extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization. NS3 staining was observed throughout the cytoplasm, but the nucleus and cytoplasmic vacuoles were unstained. Uninfected cells were always NS3 negative (Fig. 2, left panel) . These data clearly show that the vacuolated cells were not simply responding to being next to an infected cell. To demonstrate that virus-induced cytoplasmic vacuoles were not due to degeneration of plasma membrane and necrosis, we stained MDBK cells with propidium iodide (PI) at 24 h postinfection. No PI staining was observed in any cells, including those with a large number of cytoplasmic vacuoles (indicated by arrows) (Fig. 3A) . In control experiments, treatment of the same cells with 0.1 mM of diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) (0.1 mM) for 10 min to permeabilize the cell plasma membrane resulted in a rapid uptake of PI into cells as evidenced by the stained nuclei (Fig. 3B ). In addition, on the ultrastructural level, abnormal and swollen mitochondria, which are commonly found during necrosis and necroptosis (Degterev et al., 2005) , were not detected in infected cells with extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization ( Figs. 6B and 7) . Because previous studies have reported cpBVDV-induced apoptotic cell death (Grummer et al., 1998 (Grummer et al., , 2002a Jordan et al., 2002; Yamane et al., 2005) , we compared the proportion of cells expressing characteristics of apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation and caspase activation, with those undergoing extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization. A hallmark of apoptosis, chromatin condensation, can be observed using the Hoechst 33824 reagent, which brightly stains condensed chromatin. Chromatin condensation was determined to be in only 4 ± 0.9% of cells at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 4) whereas vacuolization was >25%. Caspase activation, quantified using Flica staining, was detected in only 15.3 ± 1.7% of all cells at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 4) . To determine the involvement of caspase activation in cpBVDV-induced cytoplasmic vacuolization, we used the general caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk (100 M), which was shown to inhibit apoptosis in BVDV-infected cells (Bendfeldt et al., 2003) . We found that, although addition of 100 M zVAD-fmk to MDBK cells prior to and during viral infection improved cell viability from 6.7 ± 2.2% to 18.8 ± 2.2% (Fig. 5B) , caspase inhibition had no effect on the appearance of vacuoles (Fig. 5A ) in infected cells 24 h post-infection, suggesting that virus-induced cytoplasmic vacuolization is caspase-independent. We further investigated whether apoptotic markers were localized to the infected cells with extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization. We demonstrated that at 48 h post-infection, the nuclei of cells, which were still attached with extensive vacuolization showed no evidence of bright staining with Hoechst 33324 and chromatin condensation (Fig. 6A) . On the other hand, detached cells were labeled by the Hoechst dye, producing bright fluorescence, and nuclei in those cells were very poorly defined (Fig. 6A ). To further characterize the apoptosis-vacuolization association on the ultrastructural level, we examined the nuclei of highly vacuolated cells at 16 h post-infection using electron microscopy. We found that none of the highly vacuolized cells had apoptotic bodies or condensed chromatin in their nuclei (Fig. 6B) . Moreover, infected cells with extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization did not have FLICA staining, a marker for caspase activation (Fig. 6C) . Further examination of the cytoplasmic vacuoles observed after cpBVDV infection on ultrastructural level, demonstrated that the vacuoles are surrounded by a clearly defined single membrane and contain remains of organelles and cell debris (Fig. 7) . The virus-induced vacuoles were larger than 500 nm in diameter, with an average of 10 ± 1 vacuoles per cell per thin section examined. Control cells had some cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles smaller than 100 nm in diameter, averaging 1-2 vacuoles per cell (Fig. 7A ). Cells infected with noncytopathic BVDV had cytoplasmic vacuolization similar to control cells (Fig. 7A ). In addition, we were able to identify vacuoles that can fuse with each other (Fig. 7B, left panel) and can engulf surrounding cytoplasm and organelles (Fig. 7B, right panel) , which could be a pathway for the formation of enlarged vacuoles. Interestingly, in all infected cells examined by electron microscopy, there were no signs of autophagosomes, i.e. dense vacuoles surrounded by a double membrane, suggesting that macroautophagy is unlikely to be responsible for cpBVDVinduced cytoplasmic vacuolization. To further rule out the involvement of macroautophagy in virus-induced cytoplasmic vacuolization, we demonstrated that wortmannin, an PI3-kinase and macroautophagy inhibitor, at concentrations between 0.1 and 10 M had no effect on cytoplasmic vacuolization induced by cpBVDV at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 8A) . Treatment of cells with wortmannin also had no effect on cell viability either in control cell or infected cells (Fig. 8B) . The presence of cytoplasmic and organelle debris in cpBVDV-induced vacuoles might be suggestive of lysosomal involvement. Thus, we investigated lysosomal involvement in cpBVDV-induced vacuolization using the lysosome-specific dye, LysoTracker Red. We found that cells with extensive vacuolization of cytoplasm demonstrated a partial loss of typical punctuated LysoTracker Red fluorescence staining compared to cells without vacuolization. Fig. 9 , and it was found to be distributed throughout cytoplasm of infected cells. Interestingly, LysoTracker Red, which labels acidic cellular compartments including macroautophagy-associated autophagolyso- somes, did not label cytoplasmic vacuoles in cpBVDV (Fig. 9 ).
