We were able to obtain data on 28 infector-infectee pairs (see Supplementary Table) . Of these, 12 pairs were family clusters. Accounting for right truncation and analyzing all pairs, the model using the lognormal distribution was selected as the best-fit model (WAIC=224.0), while no J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f -6 -significant differences from other models were identified. The median serial interval was estimated at 4.0 days (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.1, 4.9) while the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the serial interval were estimated at 4.7 days (95% CrI: 3.7, 6.0) and 2.9 days (95% CrI: 1.9, 4.9), respectively. Without truncation, the model using the lognormal distribution was also the best-fit model (WAIC=128.0) with the median serial interval was estimated at 3.9 days (95% CrI: 3.1, 4.8). Limiting our dataset to only certain observations, the median serial interval of the best-fit Weibull distribution model was estimated at 4.6 days (95% CI: 3.5, 5.9) with a mean and SD of 4.8 days (95% CrI: 3.8, 6.1) and 2.3 days (95% CrI: 1.6, 3.5), respectively. Without truncation, the best-fit model used the lognormal distribution and estimated the median serial interval at 4.1 days (95% CrI: 3.2, 5.0). Figure 1 shows the best-fit distributions overlaid with a published distribution of the SARS serial interval [3] .
