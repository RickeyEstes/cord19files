During the 10 years of the study (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) , 190,950 children referred to the Pediatric Emergency Department of Policlinico Umberto I of Rome, with a mean of 19095 children/years and the mean of 1.6% children/years were admitted to hospital for bronchiolitis. We enrolled 723 consecutive infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Their mean age was 78.5 ± 58.1 days (range 7-359 days), 16% of the infants were < 1 month old, 77.5% between 2 and 6 months, and 6.5% between 6 and 12 months. Fifty-five percent were male. The mean weight at hospital admission was 5.2 ± 1.4 kg. Of the 723 infants, 74% had siblings, 3.2% of infants and 59.2% of siblings were attending school. A total 76.5% infants were breastfed and in 18% parents' questionnaire answers mentioned maternal smoke exposure. The nasal wash specimens tested positive for respiratory viruses in 351/723 infants enrolled. Among the 351 virus positive infants, PCR detected alone RSV in 234 (66.8%) infants, RV in 44 (12.5%), hBoV in 11 (3.1%), and hMPV in 12 (3.4%). In 3.1% of infants, PCR detected other viruses: PIV-1 in 1 children, PIV-3 in 4 children, hCoV in 2 children, and IVA in 4 children. Specimens from 39 recruited infants (11.1%), contained more than one virus: RSV plus hBoV in 13 children, RSV plus RV in 13 infants, RV and hMPV in 4 infants, RSV and hMPV in 2 infants, RSV and IVA in 2 infants, RSV and PIV-3 in 1 infant, hBoV and hMPV in 1 infant, hBoV and PIV-1 in 1 infant and RV plus PIV-3 in 1 infant. Specimens from only one infant contained 3 viruses: RSV plus RV and hMPV. The most frequently detected pathogen was RSV. In all 10 years studied, RSV-bronchiolitis epidemics had a winter trend and activity peaked from December to February. The second most frequently detected pathogen was RV, detected throughout from October to May with no peak activity (Cangiano et al., 2016) .
