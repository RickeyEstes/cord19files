Determination of the type 1 pilus rod structure To characterize FimA polymers that form the type 1 pilus rod, we solved the cryo-EM structure of native type 1 pili appearing in a preparation of recombinantly expressed Type IV pili (T4P) from the E. coli K12 strain BW25113. As shown in Figure 1A , three types of filaments could be separated by eye: T4P, flagellar filaments, and a third class that were thicker and more rigid than T4P but thinner than the flagellar filaments. Sequencing the fimA PCR product showed that the encoded amino acid sequence was identical to the FimA protein from BW25113 (GenBank AIN34588.1) and MG1655 (GenBank NP_418734.1). There was no possibility of cross-contamination of the FimA and T4P filament images, as each has a very different helical symmetry. Averaged power spectra from FimA filaments ( The FimA reconstruction had an overall resolution of 4.2 Å (Figure 1-figure supplement 1) , which is sufficient to build an atomic model of the structure . There were no ambiguities in threading the known FimA sequence through the density map (Supplementary file 1), even though the electron density observed on the outside of the rod is less well defined ( Figure 1B) . As a result, the first two residues and the last residue of FimA, which are located close to each other on the outside of the rod, are not resolved in the density map. The 4.2 Å estimate of the resolution is consistent with the well-separated b-strands and the density present for certain bulky side chains in the central lumen ( Figure 1C -E). Further, in the structure we observe the N-terminal donor strand of one subunit completing the b-sheet of the adjacent subunit. Overall, the type 1 pilus is a 70 Å diameter rod where each adjacent subunit rotates around the helical axis by 115å nd translates along the axis by 7.7 Å (Figure 2A ). If we label each subunit along the 1-start helix by N, a subunit N 0 interacts with six adjacent subunits (N -1 ,N -2 ,N -3 ,N +1 ,N +2 ,N +3 ) (Figure 2A (Crespo et al., 2012) . Further, within a self-complemented DSE structure FimA residues 29-33 form a b-strand interaction with the appended Nte residues (9-13) (Walczak et al., 2014) . Within the cryo-EM rod FimA structure, residues 25-29 adopt a helical conformation and residues 30-33 form a b-strand interaction with residues 10-13 from the Nte of the next FimA subunit. These residues form the center strand within the hollow helical core, and thus the ability of this region to adopt multiple conformations may be necessary in order for FimA to function as the major rod subunit.
