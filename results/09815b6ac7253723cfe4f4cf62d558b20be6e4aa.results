The total numbers of passengers infected with pandemic influenza on inbound international flights for all 18 U.S. international airports per the three scenarios are graphed in Fig. 4 . The graph is bimodal, a majority of the passengers in the first peak are from Asia where the pandemic initiates; a majority of passengers in the second peak originate in Europe. The second peak is larger as many more international flights to the United States originate in Europe. Scenario 3 has the highest number of infected arriving passengers due to reduced detection rates (<50%) at the point of embarkation. More infected passengers (includes true positives and the highest number of false negatives) are introduced into the system e (peak day 45e1600 arrive), even if only 50% of the predicted infected population of passengers carrying virus elect air travel, attempting compliance with isolation and quarantine guidelines. Scenario 2 with a higher prevalence (100%) of possibly infected passengers traveling due to no effective isolation and quarantine with a high (80 %) embarkation screening for symptomatic passengers results in decreased peak days 24 and 45 by approximately 200 individuals but otherwise a fairly similar curve. Scenario 1 with 80% detection rates for symptomatic passengers, most importantly at the point of origin, and even if only 50% compliance with isolation and quarantine, has the lowest number of arriving infected passengers (peak days 45e980). The number of infected arriving passengers is reduced by nearly 40% in scenario 1. The numbers of passengers detected and actually infected with PI (true positives) at the 18 U.S. airport screening stations are depicted in Fig. 5 . In scenario 1, the high detection rate of symptomatic individuals at embarkation results in the lowest number of true positives identified at U.S. airport ports of entry. Total positives for scenarios 2 and 3 are essentially the same. Scenario 2 has a higher efficacy of screening (80%) but less compliance with isolation and quarantine travel restrictions (100% possibly infected fly); therefore more infected passengers enter the system. In scenario 3, screening effectiveness at embarkation point is relatively low (<50%), resulting in more infected passengers enroute, despite 50% compliance with isolation and quarantine guidelines with a decreased number of potentially infected electing not to fly. Even though screening efficacy is lower at the point of U.S. entry in scenario 3, more infected passenger board planes for travel to the U.S. and the distribution of true positives is similar. As with most contagious respiratory infections, infected individuals who are not incapacitated and do not appreciate the significance of their illness or their ability to disseminate disease are the source of spread in a population. In pandemic influenza, the infected/undetected e false negatives (FN) e are of greatest concern as they are not isolated and treated, thereby spreading infection upon arrival. Also their travel companions and airplane contacts during the confined 8e12 h long transcontinental air flight are not identified for prophylaxis and quarantine. The ability to identify FN passengers is realistically low (only 6%) in our model as passengers would have to voluntarily selfidentify themselves as having a known high risk exposure after commencing travel. Fig. 6 depicts the false negatives by scenario with a similar bimodal peak to the total number of PI infected arriving international passengers. The significantly reduced <50% detection ability (low sensitivity) in scenario 3 results in a higher number of false negative passengers. The high 80% detection rates for symptomatic individuals in scenarios 1 and 2 result in similar curves, with scenario 2 having more individuals due to a higher prevalence (100% of passengers that could be infected with PI or other respiratory illness) embarking for transcontinental air travel. The false negative passenger numbers predicted were transferred to the EpiCast simulation model to identify impact of untreated and not isolated passengers on the diffusion of the epidemic within the U.S. The impact of screening of arriving international travelers at U.S. airports by scenario is detailed in Table 1 . The impact of a 45-day delay in the epidemic due to early and accurate airport screening, allowing an effective vaccine to be developed and distributed, is also depicted. In scenario 1, with high (80% symptomatic) detection rates and 50% compliance with isolation and quarantine restrictions for international travelers, the U.S. attack rate is reduced from 30.7% to 30.4% e this represents an estimated 867,000 fewer people becoming ill in the U.S. population and 17,000 fewer deaths, assuming a 2% case-fatality rate. With the possibility of a 45-day delay in this scenario allowing for development of an effective vaccine, there are 1.3 million fewer cases and 25,800 fewer deaths in 100 days of the epidemic. The reduction in cumulative incidence of U.S. pandemic influenza cases for scenario 1, the ''best case'' with lowest number of false negatives that disseminate disease within the country is depicted in Fig. 7 . Early in the epidemic, with a 5e7 day estimated incubation period for influenza, there are some new cases attributable to international travelers, but the cumulative incidence is difficult to visually identify in the graph, therefore the figure is truncated and commences at day 40. The graphs for the other scenarios are very similar. In our model, the cumulative incidence of U.S. infection eventually increases to over 85,000,000 cases indicating an attack rate of over 30%, reflecting the suggested values in the Federal Pandemic Influenza Strategic Plan. 4 A 45-day delay for effective vaccine production could reduce the cumulative incidence by approximately 10 million cases. Significant resources are required to implement the layered screening program as described in Fig 100 days of the epidemic, 1.7 million inbound international passengers each day. Although severe reductions (30%) of international air travel passengers may result from the pandemic, significant decrements are unlikely in the first 100 days, and an increase in returning passengers may occur from the several million U.S. citizens residing in foreign countries. Table 2 identifies the number of passengers processed into secondary screening requiring a healthcare professional evaluation and final definitive testing by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). For example, San Francisco (SFO) International airport has about 10,000 international arriving passengers per day. Given scenario one, 4.6% of the passengers (average of 440 per day) would be directed to secondary active surveillance for a medical evaluation. For the 18 U.S. airports over 100 days, this percentage corresponds to almost 800,000 passenger evaluations and 170,000 RT-PCR laboratory tests, as 22% of those in secondary screening are tested to meet an 80% detection rate. False positive (FP) passengers, those erroneously diagnosed during the layered screening process as infected when they in fact are not, and their contacts, would be subjected to considerable stress. Such passengers would be placed in isolation, provided unnecessary medications, and their contacts quarantined and provided prophylactic medications. Of the 190,000 daily arriving international passengers, approximately 170 arriving passengers per day are erroneously diagnosed at U.S. airports as having pandemic influenza in scenarios 1 and 2 and 100/day in scenario 3 ( Fig. 10) . Scenario 3, with only 50% of predicted passengers flying with a respiratory illness due to compliance with travel guidelines, and reduced screening detection rates with decreased utilization of RT-PCR testing results in the lowest number of false positives. The 99% sensitivity/specificity of the RT-PCR laboratory test is unchanged in the three scenarios. An estimate by scenario of pandemic influenza antiviral medication usage over the initial 100 days of the pandemic is pictured in Fig. 8 . Effective antiviral drug utilization for treatment of passengers identified as being infected e both true positives (TP) and false positives (FPs) e and prophylaxis of travel companions and plane contacts (including aircrew) is a significant intervention in this mitigation strategy. Estimates of plane contacts were calculated at 10 and 30 per infected passenger, based on available information for influenza spread in airplanes. One intention of this model is to reduce passenger delays by not detaining and supporting infected or exposed passengers in isolation and quarantine areas in nearby airport facilities. Such facilities would also have to be quite large and capable of handling a myriad of patient health and family issues. Fig. 9 estimates the number of healthcare workers required to operate the screening stations at each U.S. international airport facility based on passenger volumes and projected waiting times. All airport screening and health professionals involved in primary and secondary active surveillance also receive antiviral prophylaxis (approximately 8000 weekly doses for 730 individuals for 12 weeks).
