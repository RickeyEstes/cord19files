An In Vivo Assay for Frameshifting All constructions involve the use of a HIS4A::lacZ fusion gene contained on a 2pm DNA-based plasmid whose construction is described in Experimental Procedures (Figure 1 ). This plasmid is present at four copies per cell (Farabaugh et al., 1989) . Oligonucleotides containing various versions of the frameshift sequence were introduced at the BamHl site of pMB25 and between the BamHl and Kpnl sites of pMB38. Transcription from the HIS4 promoter produce8 an mRNA with two overlapping genes: the 5' proximal gene derived from the first 100 nucleotides of the HIS4A gene and, in the +l reading frame, the 3'proximal gene derived from the /acZ gene of Escherichia coli. Production of the /acZ gene product, pgalactosidase, depends upon a ribosomal frameshift event in the +l direction within the sequences introduced on the oligonucleotides. The rate of frameshifting is measured by determining the ratio of 8-galactosidase activity produced from a construct requiring a +l frameshift to express /acZ to that of a construct in which the upstream and downstream genes are fused in frame. As shown below, the rate of frameshifting measured in this way is high, usually in the range of 40%; however, experimental variation in this rate occurs, both upward to the range of 80% and downward in the range of 20%. This variation results from unknown effects of the sequence context of individual constructions and slight variations in the physiology of yeast transformants. We will describe as abnormal only those transformants showing rates of frameshifting substantially lower than 20% (i.e., in the range of 2% or less).
