When porcine adherent PBMC were cultured for 6 days in control medium before LPS induction, no IL-1 activity was detectable in supernatants (Fig. la) nor in cell lysates {Fig. lb). In contrast, 3-day-old cultures of adherent PBMC, when treated for a further 3 days with rPoIFN~ (doses ranging from 0.01 to 10 pg/ml ) before LPS, secreted high levels of IL-1 in their supernatants {Fig. la ). A similar dose-effect of rPolFN~ on the IL-1 activity associated with the cell lysates was observed but the IL-1 yield was lower than in supernatants (Fig. lb) . A seroneutralization test indicated that the mitogenic activity present in rPoIFN;~-treated PBMC supernatants was largely neutralized by antiporcine IL-la and, to a lesser extent, by anti-porcine IL-lfl specific antisera (Table 1) . Additionally, IL-2 titrations performed on IL-2-dependent mouse T-cell lines by C. Leclerc (Institut Pasteur, Paris ) indicated that the mitogenic activity was not related to IL-2 (data not shown). In the absence of LPS induction, no IL-1 activity was detected in the supernatants of rPoIFN),otreated adherent PBMC (Fig. 2) . A kinetic study indicated that a higher IL-1 yield was observed when adherent PBMC cultures were treated for 6 days, instead of 3, with IFN~ (Fig. 2) .
