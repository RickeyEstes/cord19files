Because of the pH indicator in the vaccine, needle inoculation immediately resulted in magenta-coloured skin blebs at each injection site. Vaccination with the dermojet injector was generally quicker, but bleb formation was less satisfactory and in some areas where the skin was especially soft it appeared that all the vaccine had entered the subcutaneous tissue. This method of inoculation was also associated with lower titres of antibody than occurred after needle inoculation (figs. 1 six subjects who were inoculated with a needle and syringe. By 10 days, neutralising antibody ranged between 1 3 and 8 7 IU/ml (geometric mean titre [GMT] 3 0 IU/ml) and antirabies IgG ranged between 1/345 and 1/1250 (GMT 1/693). Peak titres of virus neutralising antibody were found on day 14 (GMT 14' 3 IU/ml), but substantial titres were still present 100 days after vaccination. The increments (cpm) in lymphocyte transformation are expressed as a ratio to the cpm values of non-stimulated control cultures (table). The results show that T lymphocytes from eight of ten vaccinees were significantly stimulated in vitro 14 to 42 days after vaccination. This blast transformation occurred with cells from three of four people given vaccine by the dermojet injector and from five ofthe six people inoculated with a needle and syringe. There was no significant difference between the transformation increments of the two groups, and no correlation was found between the transformation increment and the titre of antirabies IgG or Nine of fourteen rabbits developed paralysis and died after infection with 50 rabbit LDso of street-rabies virus. In these animals, forelimb paralysis developed within 13 to 38 days of infection and progressed to complete paralysis and death 2 to 7 days later. Postexposure treatment with a single dose of HDCS vaccine reduced the mortality significantly; the administration of I -0 ml of vaccine i.m. gave significant (p=0'018, Fisher's exact test) but incomplete protection, two of fourteen animals developing paralysis and dying after incubation periods of 13 and 20 days. None of fourteen rabbits died after receiving 4 i.d. inoculations of 0 . 2 ml of the vaccine in each limb (p = 0' 0006).
