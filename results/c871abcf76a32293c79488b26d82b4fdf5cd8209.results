As has been well documented, we recovered six phylogenetically structured groups or genotypes for DENV-2, based on the open reading frame of 877 non-recombinant sequences. The most basal group encompassed lineages from West Africa and Asia of Sylvatic genotype, which reinforced the notion that the urban genotypes emerged from the sylvatic cycle, as previously described (Vasilakis et al., 2011; Vasilakis et al., 2007a) . Urban genotypes were also identified as: (i) American, (ii) American/Asian, (iii) Asian 1, (iv) Asian 2 and (v) Cosmopolitan genotypes (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1 ). Comparison of the CAI values obtained from human and Ae. aegypti codon usage tables, shown in Fig. 1B , revealed significant differences between hosts (p-value < 0.05), demonstrating that DENV-2 codon usage is more similar to that of humans than to Ae. aegypti. In addition, we assessed the values of CAI for each genotype in comparison to human and Ae. aegypti hosts. Because CAI values for the polyprotein sequences were not normally distributed, as assessed using Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we determined statistical significance with the Mann-Whitney U test to compare among CAI estimates. The distribution of CAI values for different genotypes showed that all the genotypes fell above the e-CAI estimated for each host. Furthermore, statistical analyses showed significant differences (pvalue < 0.05) among urban genotypes for both hosts (Table 1 ). Significant differences between urban and sylvatic genotypes were identified in Ae. aegypti (Table 1) . Likewise, the genotypes with the highest CAI were Asian 1, Asian 2 and the American genotypes. We also observed that the CAI values for the sylvatic genotype were the lowest when comparing with urban genotypes in A. aegypti (p-value < 0.05) ( Fig. 1B and Table 1 ). This suggested that genotypes from urban setting could have experienced some fine-tuning process in codon optimization to translation in A. aegypti. For humans, the only pairwise comparison that was not significantly different between urban and sylvatic genotypes was that between the American/Asian and the Sylvatic genotype ( Fig. 1B and Table 1 ), suggesting that they share similar silent selective pressures. The American, Asian 2 and Cosmopolitan genotypes had the highest CAI values for humans (Fig. 1B) . Finally, we observed that these values were similar and roughly constant over time (Fig. 2) . Crucially, values were higher than the e-CAI for all the genotypes in human and mosquito cells, indicating that codon usage preferences were not random in DENV-2 genotypes (Fig. 2) .
