During the study period, the surgical volumes of most selected surgery types either increased or remained steady. We categorized these surgery types into low-, moderate-and high-elastic groups according to their demand elasticity. Appendectomy, 'open reduction of fracture with internal fixation' and 'free skin graft' were in the low demand elasticity group. Transurethral prostatectomy and extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) were in the high demand elasticity group. The manpower of the departments carrying out the surgeries with low demand elasticity should be maintained during outbreaks. In contrast, departments in charge of surgeries mainly with high demand elasticity, like urology departments, may be in a position to have part of their staff reallocated. During the study period, the surgical demands grew steadily with the expanding and aging population of Taiwan. The surgical volumes of the selected surgery types either increased or remained steady over time, with the exception of total abdominal hysterectomy (ICD9 code 68.4X) (Fig 1) . Several studies have reported that vaginal hysterectomy is safer and has fewer complications than abdominal hysterectomy, thus, the route for carrying out hysterectomy is shifting toward the vaginal approach. In fact, the total volume for hysterectomies showed a growing trend over the study period. Table 1 shows the monthly volume and the demand elasticity of each selected surgery type. We arbitrarily classified the surgery types into three categories according to their demand elasticity indices. Indices below 30, in the range 30-190 and above 190, represented low, moderate and high demand elasticity, respectively. Appendectomy (ICD9 code 47.0X) was found to have the lowest elasticity index, followed in order by 'open reduction of fracture with internal fixation' (ICD9 code 79.3X) and 'free skin graft' (ICD9 code 86.6X) as having the next lowest In a situation where an emerging infectious disease outbreak comes into an epidemic, hospitals need to reallocate some of their staff from their normal tasks to disease control and patient care. Since ESWL and transurethral prostatectomy have the high demand elasticity, relevant staff may be the suitable target to be reallocated., The manpower serving the surgeries with low demand elasticity should be maintained at least in a normal status. On the other hand, for surgical departments that fall into the moderate demand elasticity group, it will be necessary for institution managers to take additional factors into account before changing their manpower levels.
