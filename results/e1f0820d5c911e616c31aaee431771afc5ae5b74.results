We identified five SNPs in both patient and control groups: p.R99Q (c.296 G Ͼ A), p.D120G (c.359 A Ͼ G), p.P126L (c.377 C Ͼ T), p.D371Y (c.1111 G Ͼ T), and p.V377A (c.1130 T Ͼ C) ( Table 1) . All allele and genotype frequencies were consistent with those expected according to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and linkage disequilibrium was not detected among these five MASP2 polymorphisms (r 2 Ͻ 0.8). Gene frequencies of MASP2 variants occurred according to previous reports on Caucasian populations [7] . Additional in silico analyses of these SNPs indicated that only p.D120G (c.359A Ͼ G) was predicted to cause damage to the MASP-2 protein. This variant showed a profile score for the amino acid substitution (PSIC) of 2.817, and the evolutionary preservation of residue D can be seen in the corresponding position of different species (Table 2 ). An evolutionary preservation was also observed in the p.D371Y (c.1111G Ͼ T) variation, for which conservation was seen in three of four groups of species analyzed. However, the profile score for this variation did not represent a harmful effect ( Table 2) . Upon comparison of genotype frequency between patients and controls, only the p.D371Y variant (c.1111 G Ͼ T) reached statistical significance with genotype GG significantly increasing the susceptibility to HCV infection (p ϭ 0.003, odds ratio [OR] ϭ 6.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] ϭ 1.85-21.70). Because of the low frequency of the other polymorphisms, MASP-2 levels were compared only with c.1111G Ͼ T and c.1130T Ͼ C. A significant association of MASP-2 concentration was observed in the presence of the allele c.1111G Ͼ T (range, 24.0 -886.0 ng/ml). When the dominant model to G at c.1111G Ͼ T was tested, MASP-2 levels were significantly higher in GG and GT genotypes in HCV patients (p Ͻ 0.001; Fig. 1 ). Analysis of the response to IFN with ribavirin treatment at positions c.1111G Ͼ T and c.1130T Ͼ C, showed that eight (33.3%) of the 15 patients at position c.1111G Ͼ T and 9 (60.0%) at c.1130 T Ͼ C were nonresponders. No statistical significance was observed between the two groups (p ϭ 0.565 and p ϭ 0.489, respectively). No association was found between genotype variants c.1111G Ͼ T or c.1130T Ͼ C, and degree of liver fibrosis (p ϭ 0.087 and p ϭ 0.070, respectively).
