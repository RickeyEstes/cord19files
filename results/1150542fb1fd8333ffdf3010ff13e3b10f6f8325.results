The most visible exhaled airflows were seen from the simple oxygen mask at oxygen flow rates of 10 L/ min and 15 L/min, from the nonrebreathing mask at 8 L/min and 10 L/min, and from the Venturi-type mask at 35% O 2 at 6 L/min and 40% O 2 at 6 L/min. Table 2 shows the estimated distance (with geometric corrections) traveled by the exhaled smoke plumes, based on the scale factor calculated by the following: real y2 5 measured y1/(measured x1/real x2). For the simple oxygen mask (at 10 L/min and 15 L/ min), the exhaled smoke plumes appeared to travel the least distance. The exhaled smoke plumes from the nonrebreathing mask (at 8 L/min and 10 L/min) were more visible and appeared to travel farther than for the simple oxygen mask. Although there is some overlap with the distances traveled by exhaled smoke plumes from the nonrebreathing mask, overall, those from the Venturi-type mask (as settings of 35% O 2 at 6 L/min and 40% O 2 at 6 L/min) appeared to travel the farthest. Overall, the visible dispersal distances of the exhaled smoke plumes from the simple, the nonrebreathing, and the Venturi-type oxygen masks, at the different oxygen flow rates, with the different respiratory models used in this study (shown in Table 1 ) This distance had to be estimated, taking into account the geometric distortion due to the different relative positions of the Laerdal trainer, the digital camera, and the direction traveled by the exhaled smoke plume. It was estimated by knowing the real value of the chin-to-chest distance (x2 in B) on the Laerdal trainer, the measured screen distances of x1 and y1 (in A), and the relative error of these measured screen distances, estimated by the ratio (x1/x2)/(y1/y2), where the real lengths of the wooden rods, x2 and y2, were known. Note that these ratios x1/x2 and y1/y2 will not be exactly the same because they are measured in different directions and different planes, so they will be at different distances from the camera. It is this difference between ratios x1/x2 and y1/y2 that gives the value of the geometric corrections shown in Table 2 .
