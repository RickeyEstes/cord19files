Both children presented fever, respiratory distress and flushed, while only one presented cough paroxysm ( Table 1) . One of the children was treated with amoxicillin plus cephalexin (200 mg), while the other received ceftriaxone (100 mg). In both cases the treatment was successful and the children were discharged from hospital. In both cases the PCR of the direct DNA extraction from nasopharyngeal swabs was positive for the presence of the ptxA gene and IS418, which showed a 100% of identity with that of B. pertussis (GenBank accession number NC_002929). Additionally, none of the other pathogens sought was detected, and thus, the patients were diagnosed with pertussis. The antibiotic susceptibility analysis showed that the isolates present high levels of resistance to tested antibacterial agents, including all analyzed macrolides (Table 2) . Surprisingly, when the macrolide target encoding genes were amplified and sequenced, the results showed the presence of A. xylosoxidans A8 with 100% (23S rRNA gene) 99% (rplD gene) and 98% (rplV gene) of identity with the respective DNA sequences of A. xylosoxidans A8 (GenBank access CP002287.1), being even higher than the identity levels with the same DNA sequences of B. pertussis (Genbank access NC_002929) or other Bordetella spp. These results were also confirmed on PCR analysis of the grown microorganisms. For further identification tool, we included the analysis of the parC gene sequence, which also showed that the closest related sequence was that of A. xylosoxidans A8, being 2-6 amino acid codons longer than other Achromobacter spp. and Bordetella spp. ParC sequences present in GenBank. Thus, despite the presence of 27 differences (96% of identity) in the encoding ParC DNA sequence both samples, only showed 3 different amino acid changes: S15P; D20G and Y66F. Regarding the aforementioned macrolide targets no mutation was found in the 23S rRNA gene and only 5 and 7 silent mutations were found in the rplD genes on comparison with the A. xylosoxidans A8 wild-type sequence, while 6 silent mutations plus the T134A transversion resulting in the amino acid change V45A was observed in both rplV genes.
