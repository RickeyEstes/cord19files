Aiming to assess the degree of interaction partners being shared between endolysosomal cation channels, we compared our databases of compiled experimentally obtained TRPML and TPC interactors ( Table 1) . Not surprisingly, most interaction partners were shared between TPC1 and TPC2 (35.8% of all identified interacting proteins) -a likely consequence of Lin Moshier et al. [13] having used the same methodology to rigorously compare and contrast interactions of the two. Shared TPC interactors are involved in membrane organisation (Annexins, GDI2, RABs, Syntaxins, SYNGR2, VTI1B), cytoskeletal organisation (CAP1, HAX1, LMNA, MYH9), transmembrane transport (MRS2, Sideroflexins, SLC3A2, SLC25A5/6, TM9SF1-3, TMEM165, VDAC2/3), and proteostasis (AUP1, HSP90AA1, MTOR, TMEDs, TMEM33). Similar ventures of rigorous, cross-isoform interaction landscape comparisons have not been performed for the TRPML channels, although this would provide valuable information both regarding general TRPML function, and isoform-specific roles. Still, it appears evident TRPMLs more frequently share interaction partners with other TRPMLs, than with the TPCs. The highest degree of interaction partners shared outside the TPC family occurs between TRPML2 and TRPML3 (2.48% of interactors), although this could be attributable to the few TRPML2 interactors identified to date. Intriguingly, the proto-oncogene SRC appears shared between the two, possibly reflecting SRC implications in endocytosis and, thereby, localisation proximal to early endosome (EE)/recycling endosome (RE) compartments of TRPML2 and TRPML3 residency. TRPMLs further share interactors implicated in the immune response, such as the chemokine receptor CCR6, the lymphoid adhesion molecule CLEC2B, and the B-cell specification marker LY6D. Of interest and possible clinical relevance, most within-family shared TRPML interaction partners are implicated in cancer.
