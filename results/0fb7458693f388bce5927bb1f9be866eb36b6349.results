The frequency of cases (atopic individuals) and controls (nonatopic individuals) in males was 48.5% (67/138) and 42.2% (49/ 116) respectively. The logistic regression analysis showed no difference between males and females (p = 0.1579). As for age, the group of allergic individuals had a mean age of 13.968.5 years (range, 4-48 years), while controls had a mean age of 11.766.4 years (range, 5-37 years). According to the regression analysis, individuals aged 13-18 years were 2.75 times and those aged .18 years were 2.22 times more likely to be allergic (p = 0.0097 and p = 0.0358, respectively) than individuals under 12 years of age. The highest prevalence of allergy was observed in patients aged 13-18 years ( Table 2) . Table 3 shows the results for allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies of IL1A 2889 , IL1B 2511, +3962 , IL1R 1970 , IL1RA 11100 , IL4RA +1902 , IL12 21188 , IFNG +874 , TGFB1 codon 10, codon 25 , TNFA 2308, 2238 , IL2 2330, +166 , IL4 21098, 2590, 233 , IL6 2174, nt565 , and IL10 21082, 2819, 2592 in 138 patients sensitive to at least one of the dust mites (D. farinae, D. pteronyssinus, and Blomia tropicalis) and 116 controls. A significant difference was observed in genotype and allele frequency between cases and controls at position 2889 of the IL1A gene. The genotype T/T showed a negative association with sensitivity to dust mites (5.1% vs. 14.7%, OR = 0.31, p = 0.016, and 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.12-0. 78 ). An analysis of T allele variant revealed a negative association (23.5% vs. 33.2%, OR = 0.62, p = 0.017, and 95% CI = 0.42-0.91) with sensitivity to at least one of the three types of dust mites. The positions IL2 2330, +166 also showed significant frequency in the GG/TT haplotype and the G/T. The GG/TT haplotype and the G/T genotype were indicated as risk factors, with a frequency of 18.8% vs. 7.8% and 42.7% vs. 27.6% in the allergic group vs. the control group, respectively (Table 3) . When comparing the frequency of cytokine SNPs between 123 patients sensitive to dust mite 1 (D. farinae) and 116 controls, the IL1A 2889 SNP showed a statistically significant frequency in the T/T genotype (5.7% vs. 14.7%, OR = 0.35, p = 0.029, and 95% CI = 0.14-0.88) and in the T allele (23.6% vs. 33.2%, OR = 0.62, p = 0.025, and 95% CI = 0.41-0.93), with a negative association. The IL4RA gene at position +1902 also showed a significant frequency in the A and G alleles. While the A allele was indicated as a risk factor, the G allele showed a protective effect, with a frequency of 74.4% vs. 63.8% and 25.6% vs. 36.2% in the allergic . These data suggest that individuals who express the A allele are at risk of developing hypersensitivity to dust mite 1, and those who express the C allele have a protective factor against this development ( Table 4 ). The analysis of the frequency of cytokine SNPs in 98 individuals sensitive to dust mite 2 (D. pteronyssinus) and 116 controls showed a significant difference in IL2 2330, +166 SNPs in the GG/TT haplotype (18.4% vs. 7.8%, OR = 2.67, p = 0.0234, and 95% CI = 1.14-6.26) and in the G/T genotype (42.9% vs. 27.6%, OR = 1.97, p = 0.0215, and 95% CI = 1.11-3.48). A positive association with sensitivity to dust mite 2 was found only at position 2330. There was also a significant statistical difference in the IL4 2590 SNP when analyzing the distribution of genotypic and allelic variants. The T/C genotype (10.2% vs. 43.1%, OR = 0.15, p = 0.000000052, pc = 0.0000011, and 95% CI = 0.07-0.32) showed a negative association with sensitivity to dust mite 2, while the T/T genotype (42.9% vs. 13.8%, OR = 4.69, p = 0.0000025, pc = 0.000055, and 95% CI = 2.42-9.09) showed a positive association. Additionally, C and T alleles were indicated as protective and risk factors, respectively, for the development of sensitivity to dust mite 2, with a frequency of 52.0% vs. 64.7% and 48.0% vs. 35.3%, respectively (Table 5) . A total of 103 individuals were sensitive to dust mite 3 (Blomia tropicalis). The IL2 2330, +166 SNPs showed a significant frequency in the GG/TT haplotype (17.5% vs. 7.8%, OR = 2.52, p = 0.0387, and 95% CI = 1.08-5.89), being a risk factor for the development of sensitivity to dust mite 3 ( Table 6) . As for the influence of regulatory regions on cytokine production, we found no significant difference in the association of TGFB1, TNFA and IL10 genotypes and haplotypes between cases and controls as selected using the Cytokine Genotyping Kit (Invitrogen).
