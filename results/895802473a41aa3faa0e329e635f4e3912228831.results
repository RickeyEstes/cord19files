In this study, HSV-1 and MHV-JHM identical. The main difference, as expected, was HSV-1 infection of the spinal tract and sensory root of the trigeminal nucleus following intranasal, but not intrabulbar inoculation. Although there is evidence for trigeminal innervation of the MOB," HSV-1 did not infect trigeminal nuclei following inoculation into the MOB. Given the high similarity of the results across the two types of inoculations, only the results for intrabulbar inoculations in young adult mice will be presented. At the first time point examined (day 3 MHV-JHM, day 4 HSV-1) virus had already spread to the opposite hemisphere and most structures were infected bilaterally. Although virus spread was more extensive on the side of bulbar inoculation, the pattern of labeling was highly similar on both sides by the second time point examined (day 4 MHV-JHM, day 5 HSV-1). Consistent with our previous experience with MHV-JHM, some structures were only infected in a subset of cases at a particular time p.i. These structures eventually became infected in all cases at later times p.i., however, suggesting that this variability reflected differences between mice in the temporal course of infection rather than in the pattern of spread.
