The nine pregnant women were all in their third trimester, and all underwent caesarean section. All patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19. The age range of the patients was 26-40 years, and the range of gestational weeks at admission was 36 weeks to 39 weeks plus 4 days. None of the patients had underlying diseases such as diabetes, chronic hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. One patient, Seven of the nine patients presented with a fever without chills, but none had a high fever (body temperature >39°C). Patients' body temperatures fluctuated within a range of 36·5-38·8°C. The two patients with a normal body temperature before caesarean section both had postpartum fever (range 37·8-39·3°C). Other symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection were also observed: four patients had a cough, three had myalgia, two reported a sore throat, and two indicated malaise. Additionally, one patient showed obvious gastrointestinal symptoms. Another patient had shortness of breath and preeclampsia. However, none of the nine patients developed severe pneumonia, requiring mechanical ventilation, or died of COVID-19 pneumonia, as of Feb 4, 2020. Pregnancy complications that appeared after the onset of COVID-19 infection included fetal distress (in two of nine patients) and premature rupture of the membrane (in two of nine; table 1). All patients were given oxygen support (nasal cannula) and empirical antibiotic treatment. Six patients were administered antiviral therapy (table 1) . Data from laboratory tests showed that five of the nine pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia had lymphopenia (<1·0 × 10⁹ cells per L). Six patients had ele vated concentrations of C-reactive protein (>10 mg/L). Three had increased concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), one of whom had ALT reaching 2093 U/L and AST reaching 1263 U/L. Additionally, seven patients had a normal white cell count, with none of the patients having a white cell count below the normal range (table 1). All nine patients had a chest CT scan. Eight patients showed typical findings of chest CT images-multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in lungs 2 (figure). Nine livebirths were recorded. No fetal death, neonatal death, or neonatal asphyxia was observed. Four patients had preterm labour, but all beyond 36 gestational weeks. Two of the four premature neonates at 36 gestational weeks plus 2 days had a birthweight lower than 2500 g (table 2). Neonate 4 had a birthweight of 1880 g and the pregnancy was complicated by pre-eclampsia. Neonate 7 had a birthweight of 2460 g. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8-9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9-10 (table 2). Neonate 1 had a mild increase in myocardial enzymes on the day of birth (myoglobin 170·8 ng/mL and creatine kinase-myocardial band 8·5 ng/mL), but without any clinical symptoms. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was tested in amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples collected from six patients. Neither the Kit recommended by CDC nor our in-house nested RT-PCR assays detected SARS-CoV-2 in these samples.
