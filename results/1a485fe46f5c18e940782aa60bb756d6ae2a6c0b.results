Over the 4-year period, there were 2429 admissions to KDH involving individuals who were eligible for the study (57% were boys; median age, 9 months [interquartile range {IQR}, 3-22 months]). A total of 503 (21%) had very severe pneumonia (50% were boys; median age, 10 months [IQR, 2-34 months]; 55% were infants), and the in-hospital case-fatality rate was 6.5%. Of the eligible inpatients, 2002 (82%) were tested for influenza (57% were boys; median age, 9 months [IQR, 3-21 months]; 58% were infants), and this percentage did not differ among those aged <1 year, 1-4 years, and ≥5 years (P = .333); 387 (19%) had very severe pneumonia (52% were boys; median age, 10 months [IQR, 2-34 months]; 53% were infants). Stratified by severity, 84% of eligible inpatients with severe pneumonia were tested, compared with 77% of eligible inpatients with very severe pneumonia (P = .001). The case-fatality rate among inpatients who were untested was significantly higher than among those who were tested ( ; 37% were infants). Compared with the median age of inpatients, the median ages of outpatients with non-ARI (P = .004) or URTI (P ≤ .0001) were higher.
