The response rate was 78.5%; 95 of 121 acute care hospitals with inpatient beds completed the needs assessment survey. Nonresponding hospitals were not significantly different from respondent hospitals for number of beds (F 5 1.2, P 5 .3) or rural location (x 2 5 2.2, P 5 .1). Mean hospital size was 195.8 (standard deviation [SD], 226.8) beds with a median of 94.0. One quarter (23.2%, 22 of 95) of hospitals had less than 30 beds, and one quarter (25.3%, 24 of 95) of hospitals had more than 300 beds. Hospitals from towns and rural areas with populations less than 100,000 accounted for 61.1% (58 of 95) of respondents. Most hospitals (91.5%, 86 of 94) had generic emergency plans, and 84.5% (71 of 84) of these hospitals had formally tested their generic emergency plans (Tables 1 and 2 ). Three quarters (76.8%, 73 of 95) of hospitals had pandemic influenza plans (Table 1 ). There was a trend for larger hospitals (x 2 5 3.0, P 5 .08) and urban hospitals (x 2 5 3.0, P 5 .08) to be more likely to have pandemic influenza plans. Only 16.4% (12 of 73) of hospitals with pandemic plans had formally tested their plans ( Table 2) . Larger (x 2 5 6.7, P 5 .01) and urban hospitals (x 2 5 5.0, P 5 .03) were more likely to have tested their pandemic influenza plans. One fifth (22.5%, 16 of 71) of hospitals with pandemic influenza plans made them available to staff on their intranets. Only a single hospital had their pandemic influenza plan available to the general public on its Web site.
