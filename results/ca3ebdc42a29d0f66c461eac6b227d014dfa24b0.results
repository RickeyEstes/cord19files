Intracellular forms of blood pathogens could not be detected by light microscopy. However, 30 samples (15%; CI 95 = 10-20%) were positive in the PCR assays specifically targeting the 16S rDNAs of Anaplasmataceae. The longer 16S fragment (1012 bp) was sequenced from 21 of the Anaplasma-positive samples, whereby all featured identical sequences. By performing a BLAST search in NCBI GenBank ® database, we retrieved another 68 Anaplasma sequences, which covered the complete 16S rDNA sequence and showed more than 99.5% sequence similarity. Median Joining networks were calculated based on the alignment containing all these 68 sequences and the 21 sequences of the present study (Fig. 1) . The lineage detected in the present study is identical to Candidatus Anaplasma camelii isolated from blood and spleen, respectively, of dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia (KF843823-28, [11] ), Iran (KX765882 [15] ), and Tunisia (KM401906-07 [12] ). Moreover, the same lineage was found also in blood of Javanese rusa which is a deer native to the islands of Indonesia and East Timor (Rusa timorensis) (MG910989) and cattle (MG910990) in Malaysia [33] , and in cattle in Bangladesh (MF576175 [34] ). The 1012 bp section of the 16S differs only in one position from sequences of Anaplasma platys isolated from dogs worldwide. Moreover, several other genotypes, differing in one or a few position only, were isolated from dromedaries in Tunisia, and in Bactrian camels, Mongolian gazelles, goats, cattle, and blood fed mosquitoes in China. Several related genotypes, differing in one or several positions, were isolated from blood of goats, Mongolian gazelle, cattle, and blood fed mosquitoes in China, and dogs from the Philippines. Statistically, there were no significant correlations between PCR positive results and age or sex of the animals. Candidatus Anaplasma camelii was present in five out of six study sites with prevalence ranging 5-43.3% in different regions (Table 1 ). One camel positive for Anaplasma spp. in Shahr-e-Babak was co-infected with filaroid Deraiophoronema evansi detected in a previous study [27] . The PCR screenings for Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp. and Rickettsia spp. were all negative. The 16S sequences of Candidatus Anaplasma camelii obtained from 21 camels in the present study were deposited in Genbank ® (www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) under the accession numbers MK726038-MK726058.
