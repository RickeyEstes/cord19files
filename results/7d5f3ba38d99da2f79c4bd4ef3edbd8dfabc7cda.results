A total of 24 NIOSH 2-stage samples were collected (Table 1) . Overall, 4 (17%) out of 24 samples indicated evidence of at least 1 respiratory pathogen, with 1 (4.1%) positive for influenza D and 3 (12.5%) positive for adenovirus. Samples were most frequently positive in the 4 μm or 1-4 μm particle size ranges with one adenovirus and the influenza D sample detected at 4 μm and two adenovirus positives detected at 1-4 μm. Two (67%) of the 3 adenovirus-positive specimens, samples 16 and 19, were successfully sequenced using the panadenovirus assay and were found to be human adenovirus type 1 (NCBI accession number AF534906.1). Adenoviruses were detected more frequently in the baggage claim 2 area, with 2 (2.8%) positive samples detected in that area. None of the 72 samples were positive for influenza A, influenza B, influenza C, or coronaviruses. Although not the focus of our study, we did not detect viable viruses using culture analysis associated with positive aerosol samples at RDU airport. During sampling, air temperature ranged from 63.6°F to 78.6°F and the relative humidity (RH) ranged from 25.1 to 60.4% (Table 1 ). There was no statistically significant difference between the mean air temperature or the mean RHs between the groups of samples that were positive or negative for respiratory viruses.
