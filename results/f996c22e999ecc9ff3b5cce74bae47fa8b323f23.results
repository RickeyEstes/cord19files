Isolation and characterization of DENV endocytic vesicles. We had previously obtained two subclones from limiting dilution of THP-1 cells, namely THP-1.2R (ADE-resistant) and THP-1.2S (ADEsusceptible) 6 . While both subclones supported similar levels of DENV uptake and infection under DENV only conditions, infection under ADE conditions led to significantly higher DENV-2 titres in THP-1.2S compared to THP-1.2R. The difference in susceptibility to ADE was due to higher levels of LILRB1 expression on THP-1.2S. Antibody-opsonized DENV co-ligated LILRB1 to down-regulate activating Fcγ R-mediated signaling, reducing induction of ISGs for enhanced DENV replication in THP-1.2S 6 . Since LILRB1 signaling modulates Syk activity, which in turn regulates phagosome trafficking and maturation 13 , we examined here if reduced Syk activity results in altered phagosomal compartmentalization of DENV that could also contribute to enhanced viral replication during ADE. To investigate how compartmentalization was modified, we adapted a protocol previously used for purification of latex bead-containing phagosomes on a step sucrose gradient 14 to isolate DENV endocytic vesicles following infection of THP-1 subclones under DENV only or ADE conditions ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Recovery of DENV RNA was most abundant in fraction 3, or the densest fraction collected (Fig. 1A) . Similar findings were obtained when DENV endocytic vesicles were isolated using a continuous sucrose gradient, which allows flotation of DENV-containing vesicles at their buoyant density. Importantly, the peak in viral RNA recovery using both methods of isolation corresponded to fractions of similar density, reinforcing the reproducibility of this assay (Fig. 1B) . As the yield of viral RNA recovery during purification of DENV endocytic vesicles with a step sucrose gradient was higher, this method was used for subsequent experiments. Particles in isolated fractions of step sucrose gradient were further characterized using Nanosight, which enables quantification and sizing of nanoparticles. As the sizes of endosomal and lysosomal compartments range from 200 nm to 600 nm 15, 16 , the use of Nanosight allows tracking of DENV with cellular endocytic machinery. DENV was first labeled with DiD (1,1′ -dioctadecyl-3,3,3′ ,3′ -tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt), a lipophilic fluorescent dye. Following uptake and fusion of the virus and host cell membranes, its fluorescence unquenches, allowing discrimination of DiD-particles using Nanosight under fluorescence mode. The modal size of DiD-particles was 2 to 3 fold larger than modal size of nanoparticles detected under light scatter mode (Fig. 1C, Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Importantly, the majority of DiD-particles were detected in fraction 3 in both DENV only and ADE infection (Fig. 1C) , consistent with the bulk of viral RNA being recovered from fraction 3 (Fig. 1A) . The modal size of 274 nm and 246 nm for DiD-particles isolated following DENV only and ADE infection, respectively, also suggests the possibility that DENV is contained within endosomal vesicles (Fig. 1C ). DENV is trafficked to lysosomal compartments upon FcγR-mediated entry. Western blot probing for the expression of endosomal trafficking markers from isolated fractions revealed lower expression of Rab-5 and EEA-1, markers for early endosomal compartments, relative to Rab-7 and LAMP-1, markers for late endosomal compartments ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). This suggests that at 2 hours post-infection, DENV is compartmentalized in late endosomes or lysosomes following uptake into the host cell. The enrichment of endosomal markers in isolated fractions relative to whole cell lysate is further validation that purification of DENV endocytic vesicles can be performed on a step sucrose gradient ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Organelle markers were also used to verify the purity of DENV endocytic vesicle isolation. Although Golgi apparatus (GM130) and peroxisomes (PMP70) were not detected, both ER (calnexin and BiP) and mitochondria (HSP60) co-isolated with DENV endocytic vesicles ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). ER proteins are known to mediate phagosome trafficking and have been co-isolated with latex bead phagosomes 17 . HSP60, which could be important for DENV replication as siRNA knockdown of HSP60 in U937 monocytic cells led to reduced viral replication and increased IFN-α production 18 , was also detected in our Western blots. To attain a more granular level of information on how DENV compartmentalization is altered during ADE, we performed isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis on DENV endocytic vesicles isolated from fraction 3. Interestingly, lysosomal proteins were enriched in THP-1.2R but reduced in THP-1.2S during ADE (Fig. 1D) . Conversely, proteins involved in endocytosis and Fcγ R-mediated phagocytosis were enriched in THP-1.2S during ADE (Fig. 1D ). That DENV was trafficked to lysosomal compartments in THP-1.2R during ADE was substantiated by activation of lysosomal hydrolases, which are processed to their catalytically active form upon phagosome acidification. Specifically, the expression of active cathepsin D (CatD), a lysosomal protease with optimal activity at acidic pH, was higher in THP-1.2R compared to THP-1.2S (Fig. 1E ).
