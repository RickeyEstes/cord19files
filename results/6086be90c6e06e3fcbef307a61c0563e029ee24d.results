No B. pertussis clustering was observed during the study. No significant differences were found between infants with confirmed B. pertussis and control infants with RSV-bronchiolitis for demographic characteristics including gender, gestational age, birth weight, type of delivery, DTaP vaccination status, age at admission, weight on admission, presence of siblings and schooling. The percentage of infants who were breast fed at hospitalization was lower in the group of infants with B. pertussis than in the one with RSV bronchiolitis (63.2% vs 89.5%, p <0.06) ( Table 1) . Data for the clinical characteristics showed that the percentage of infants with paroxysmal cough was significantly higher and cough at admission lasted longer in infants with pertussis than in control infants (63.2% vs 0.0%, p <0.001, 7 days vs 3 days, p <0.09). The percentage of infants with fever (TC > 37.5°C) was significantly lower in infants with pertussis than in the control group (15.8% vs 68.4%, p <0.001). The percentage of infants with apnea and cyanosis was significantly higher in infants with pertussis than in those with RSV bronchiolitis (apnea 52.6% vs 10.5%, p <0.006 and cyanosis 52.6% vs 10.5%, p <0.006). Finally, infants with pertussis less often had abnormal chest sounds on auscultation than infants with RSV bronchiolitis (0% vs 42,1%; p < 0.005). No significant difference was found between the two groups regarding clinical severity scores [median(range) 3(0-6) vs 5(0-7)] and days hospitalization [7(2-15) vs 5 ]. Clinical complications rarely arose in the two groups: two infants in the pertussis group (10.5%) and Table 2) . No significant differences were found between the two groups for chest radiograph findings (air trapping, peribronchial thickening and consolidations). Laboratory data showed significantly higher absolute WBC and lymphocyte numbers in children with pertussis than in infants with RSV bronchiolitis (23886 ± 16945, vs 10725 ± 4126 cells/mm 3 , p <0.0001 and 13.653 ± 10.430 vs 4.730 ± 2.400 cells/mm 3 , p <0.001 by Mann-Whitney U test). Finally, children with pertussis had higher absolute blood eosinophil numbers than children with RSV bronchiolitis (510 ± 500 vs 86 ± 123 cells/mm 3 p <0.001). No significant differences were reported for absolute neutrophil numbers, absolute platelet numbers, Hb concentration, SGOT, SGPT, GGT, and CRP (Table 3) . Of the 19 infants with pertussis, four (21.0%) had received the first DTaP vaccination dose and only one (5.3%) had received two doses. In the control group, 4 infants (21.0%) received the first DTaP vaccination dose (Table 1) . Of the 19 patients who tested positive for B. pertussis, 13 (68.4%) had already undergone macrolide antibiotic therapy when specimens were collected, 4 (21.0%) had specimens collected after antibiotic therapy, and 2 (10.5%) received no antibiotic therapy. Three of the 19 infants with pertussis infection (15.8%) were co-infected with RSV and two (10.5%) with Rhinovirus. No differences were found for clinical and demographic findings between infants with B. pertussis infection alone and infants with B. pertussis and RSV or RV co-infection.
