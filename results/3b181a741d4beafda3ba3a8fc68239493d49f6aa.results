As for separate cities/regions data, based on different data sources, we summed the total population flow from Wuhan to other cities/regions and the total number of cases in those cities. Then we estimate total number and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) about COVID-19 cases. We predicted 1326 (95% CI: 1177, 1484), 1151 (95% CI: 1018, 1292) and 5277 (95% CI: 4732, 5859) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January, based on different source of data, see Table 1 . As for separate cities/regions data, we estimated total number of cases, Î» , by using the maximum log-likelihood estimation (MLE) approach based on the population flow data from Tencent and Baidu, see Fig 2 (a,b) . Then we estimated 95% confidence interval (95% CI) about COVID-19 cases. We predicted 1059 (95% CI: 918, 1209), 5214 (95% CI: 4659, 5808) as total cases in Wuhan by 23 January 2020, based on different sources of population flow data, see Table 2 . .

This is partly because the screening effort targeting population from Wuhan in other cities is much more effective than the local screening effort in Wuhan due to the worsen situation. Based on three different sources of population flow data, we generated the total COVID-19 cases prediction closest to the official report through Tencent data. Baidu Data provided closest result to the forecast by Imai et al. [8] . Meanwhile, in sensitivity analysis, Table 1 and Table 2 show that slight fluctuations of probability that a case is exported from Wuhan will have little impact on the forecast. Estimates of the population outflow provided by news, Baidu and Tencent show substantial fluctuation, resulting in wide predictions. We found that Baidu and Tencent data show significant linear relation, which verified each other that the general pattern of data is reasonable. After simple linear transformation, two sets of data become similar (see Fig 3) . further expanding the scope of epidemic monitoring, the gap between the estimated number and official reported cases will be further narrowed. According to our results, statistics of population flow also play significant roles in prediction. At present, many researches use data from Baidu and .

It is not clear which data source can be used to make the most accurate prediction yet, while it is possible for forecasts based on a single data source to be inaccurate. To sum up, it is necessary to make a comprehensive analysis based on different statistics before reaching any conclusions.
