Routine virological investigations of Thai dogs. Samples from three autopsied Thai dogs that had exhibited respiratory symptoms and had been subjected to routine diagnostics were selected for further investigation. This included multiplex PCR screening for a panel of common canine respiratory viruses, which showed the presence of canine influenza virus (CIV) and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) in the nasal swab of dog no. 14P105D and canine parainfluenza (CPIV) in the oral swab of dog no. 14P112N (Table 1) . No viruses had been detected using the multiplex PCR screen in the lungs of these two dogs or in samples from dog no. 15P061D. In addition, no viruses had been detected upon screening of respiratory swabs collected from twenty other dogs with respiratory problems of varying severity, using multiplex PCR or pan-PCRs for corona-, paramyxo-and herpesviruses (Table 1 ). In addition, no indications for the presence of canine parvovirus (CPV) or canine coronavirus (CCV) were found in intestinal swabs taken from the three autopsied dogs (Nos 14P105D, 14P112N, 15P061D) using an antigen detection kit.
