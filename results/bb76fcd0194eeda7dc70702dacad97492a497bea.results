HuNoV VLPs bind to canine gastrointestinal samples in ELISAbased assays. Saliva samples from 26 dogs (1 to 23 and D to F), and duodenal scrapings from 6 dogs (A to F) were analyzed in ELISA-based assays for their ability to bind to HuNoV VLPs (Fig.  2) . All canine samples were phenotyped for HBGA expression in a previous study (23) . It was therefore known that H antigen expression was present in every canine sample, and A antigen and Lewis antigen expression was polymorphic. Human saliva samples representing the major HBGA phenotypes present in humans were used as controls. These human samples included saliva from a nonsecretor individual (no HBGA expression) and saliva from humans expressing either A antigen, B antigen, or H antigen alone (O phenotype). Saliva samples with variation in Lewis antigen expression (ϩ/Ϫ) were also included. In the saliva binding assay ( Fig. 2A) , the nonsecretor human sample was unable to bind to HuNoV VLPs, as expected based on previous reports (18) . In contrast, all canine saliva samples and all secretor human samples were able to bind to HuNoV GI.1 and GII.4 VLPs. There were comparable OD 450 values for the canine and human saliva samples, indicative of similar levels of binding. VLPs of seven different HuNoV genotypes were used to assess their ability to bind duodenal scrapings from six dogs (A to F) (Fig.  2B ). Human saliva samples from an A antigen-positive, Lewis antigen-positive (Aϩ) individual and an A antigen-negative, Lewis antigen-negative (OϪ) individual were used as positive controls; both samples were shown ( Fig. 2A) to bind to GI.1 and GII.4 HuNoV VLPs. Figure 2B demonstrates that canine duodenal scrapings could bind to every HuNoV genotype tested. Individual variation between the samples was identified; for example, canine samples D, E, and F showed decreased binding to GI.2 and GII.4 HuNoV VLPs. Other dogs however, most notably dogs B and C, were able to bind to all HuNoV VLPs tested. This was not apparently related to HBGA phenotype; all dogs were H antigen positive, and dogs C and E were A antigen positive, whereas dogs A, B, D, and F were A antigen negative (as previously reported [23] ). In addition, dogs were phenotyped for Lewis antigen, with dogs A and B being Lewis positive and the remainder Lewis negative (data not shown). Variation in OD 450 scales between genotypes was arbitrary due to the primary antibody used; for detection of the GI VLPs, the primary antibody used had been raised against GI.1, whereas for the GII VLPs, the primary antibody was raised against GII.4. HuNoV VLPs bind to canine gastrointestinal tissue sections. To determine whether HuNoV VLPs are able to bind to canine gastrointestinal tissues, fixed sections of duodenum from two dogs (B and C) were incubated with HuNoV VLPs for 1 h, and then immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect binding of HuNoV VLPs to the tissue surface. As polymorphism for the A antigen is present in dogs (approximately 50% are A antigen positive [23] ) and due to the known interaction between A antigen and HuNoV (32), HBGA phenotyping was also required. Confirmation of the presence or absence of H antigen and A antigen in the tissue sections used for the VLP binding was achieved by incubating the tissue sections with Ulex and anti-A antigen antibody, respectively, and IHC was performed. This demonstrated that dog C was A antigen positive and dog B was A antigen negative, hence enabling comparison of HuNoV VLP binding to canine samples representing the two major HBGA phenotypes. H antigen expression was not detectable in the A-positive dog, which is understood to be due to the ability of the A antigen to mask the H antigen, therefore preventing detection by Ulex lectin binding (33) . Figure 3 demonstrates that GI.1 and GII.4 HuNoV VLPs can bind to both A antigen-positive and A antigen-negative dogs. In addition it was shown that HuNoV VLP binding has a pattern of expression similar to that of H and A antigen. Given the known interaction between HBGAs and HuNoVs, these similar binding patterns were expected (18) . HuNoV RNA was not detected in canine stool samples. A total of 248 canine stool samples were collected and analyzed for the presence of HuNoV RNA. Stool samples and clinical data were collected from 131 dogs admitted to veterinary clinics and a rescue kennel distributed across the United Kingdom between August 2012 and May 2014. The mean age of the dogs was 5.1 years (standard deviation, 4.3 years), with 56 different breeds represented. A total of 50.1% of these samples were from dogs with clinical signs of primary gastroenteritis. Control samples were collected from 117 healthy dogs (mean age, 5.6 years; standard deviation, 3.6 years) from boarding kennels or belonging to veterinary staff. Nucleic acid extraction and qPCR were successfully performed on 248 stool samples as determined by constant threshold cycle (C T ) values from the internal extraction control RNA. Samples were tested by qPCR for the presence of HuNoV and CNV. No samples were identified as being positive for any noroviruses, indicating that the overall prevalence of noroviruses in this population at the time of sample collection was Ͻ1.5% (Wilson binomial approximation; confidence interval, 95%). To confirm the efficacy of the screening method, samples were also tested for the presence of two additional canine viruses previously reported to The primary anti-HuNoV antibody screen identified anti-HuNoV antibodies at detectable levels in sera from 43 dogs, 24 from cohort A (10.7%) and 19 from cohort B (18.6%) ( Table 3) . Of these 43 dogs, 32.5% were seropositive for both GI and GII HuNoV, whereas the remainder were seropositive for either GI or GII HuNoV. Seropositivity to CNV in the same canine serum samples has previously been reported (28) , and these data have been added to Table 3 for comparison. The age of the dog at time of sampling was known for 93/102 dogs in cohort B. No relationship between seropositivity to HuNoV and age was identified (data not shown). To estimate the magnitude of the canine anti-HuNoV antibody response, anti-HuNoV titers were determined for 21/23 samples seropositive to GI HuNoV and 33/35 samples seropositive to GII HuNoV. As presented in Table 4 , the antibody titers to GI in the 21 dogs seropositive in the primary ELISA screen are relatively low, but the OD 450 values obtained in the titer ELISA showed strong consistency in comparison with the original ELISA screen. For the majority of the anti-GII HuNoV-positive serum samples, a similarly low antibody titer (mode, 1:100) was determined, but in contrast to the case for GI, three samples (9% of GII-seropositive samples tested) had antibody titers of 1:800 or higher. To extend the findings of the preliminary ELISAs, all canine serum samples positive for HuNoV were entered into a second round of ELISAs with individual genotypes of HuNoV. This was to investigate whether it was possible to identify the HuNoV genotype that may be eliciting the anti-HuNoV immune response. It is acknowledged that immunological cross-reactivity does exist between norovirus genotypes (34) , and thus conclusive identification of the primary genotype inducing antibody production was not the aim of these experiments. However, the genotype to which the highest OD 450 value was induced in ELISAs was tentatively suggested to be the major HuNoV genotype involved. For example, a serum sample for which the OD 450 was highest against GII.4 HuNoV VLPs was designated GII.4 specific for the purposes of this study. Figure 4 presents the genotype distribution of HuNoV GII-positive samples, comparing cohort A (1999 to 2001) with cohort B (2012 to 2013). Our data showed that GII.4-specific antibodies were most common in both cohorts, although whereas 42.1% of samples showed the highest OD 450 for GII.4 in cohort A, this figure increased to 87.5% in cohort B. To confirm that the anti-HuNoV antibodies identified in dogs were not merely the result of cross-reactivity to canine-specific noroviruses, a series of blocking assays were performed (Fig. 5) . As highlighted in Table 2 , we have previously shown that seroprevalence to CNV was high in the same population of dogs analyzed in this study (28) , so first it was necessary to establish that the CNVspecific antibodies were not cross-reactive with HuNoV. This was achieved by preincubating various concentrations of HuNoV and CNV VLPs with a representative anti-CNV antibody-positive canine serum (serum S) and then analyzing the ability of the serum to detect CNV VLPs (Fig. 5A) . Preincubation with CNV VLPs was clearly able to block recognition of CNV VLPs by canine serum, whereas preincubation with GI or GII VLPs had no effect on CNV VLP recognition. This confirmed that the epitopes recognized by the anti-CNV antibodies were distinct from epitopes present on HuNoV VLPs. Next, the specificity of the anti-GII antibodies identified in canine sera was examined using a similar VLP competition assay with GII VLPs applied to a microtiter plate instead of CNV VLPs (Fig. 5B) . The concentration of HuNoV or CNV VLPs required to block 50% binding to GII VLPs was calculated by fitting a sigmoidal curve to the OD 450 values for the serial dilution of VLPs. Seven different canine serum samples (i to vii) identified as being positive for anti-GII antibodies were analyzed, and serum S (negative for GII binding) was added as a negative control. For samples i to vii, the type of VLP inducing the lowest EC 50 for blocking GII VLP recognition by canine serum was GII HuNoV VLPs. CNV VLPs did induce a decrease in GII recognition below the upper threshold of detection in 4/7 cases, but a greater concentration of CNV VLPs than of GII VLPs was required. This suggests that a degree of cross-reactivity between GII HuNoV and CNV is likely but that differentiation is possible. The final blocking assay conducted to investigate the specificity of antibodies detected in canine serum used antibodies generated in animals immunized solely with either CNV or GII HuNoV VLPs (Fig. 5C ). These animals, rat and rabbit, respectively, would not have been exposed to natural infection, and hence antibodies in their serum were deemed specific for their VLP immunogen. Anti-CNV or anti-GII HuNoV serum was serially diluted and incubated directly with GII VLPs applied to microtiter plates, and then after plate washing, GII-positive canine serum (serum vi) incubation followed. The results showed that rat CNV-specific antiserum was unable to block recognition of GII HuNoV by canine serum, whereas rabbit GII-specific antiserum induced blocking of GII VLP recognition by canine serum. Western blotting was used as alternative method to demonstrate the presence of anti-HuNoV antibodies in canine sera. Five serum samples identified as being positive for anti-HuNoV antibodies by ELISA were selected for use in Western blots (Fig. 6) . A single serum sample (sample S2) shown to be negative for both human and canine noroviruses was selected as a negative control. Western blotting confirmed that canine sera from five representative samples could detect GII.4 VLPs and that this expression was independent of recognition of genogroup IV or VI CNV.
