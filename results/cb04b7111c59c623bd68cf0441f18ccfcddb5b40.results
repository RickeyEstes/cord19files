RNA interference (RNAi) screening for kinase and phosphatase factors in field isolate RABV infection. To identify key host factors for RABV at both the early and late stages of the infection, a kinase and phosphatase siRNA screen was performed with readout at 18 h and 36 h postinfection. The GFP-recombinant field isolate Tha virus (Tha-GFP), engineered in our laboratory, was screened against a focused library of 3,024 duplexes composed of three independent siRNAs for 710 kinase genes and 298 phosphatase genes. HEK293T cells were transfected with a single siRNA and counted 72 h later using Hoechst staining and automated microscopy (see Fig. S2A in the supplemental material). We chose to infect cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 in order to reach 20% of infected cells at 18 h and 70% at 36 h (Fig. S2 ). At the experimental endpoint, cells were fixed, nuclei were subjected to Hoechst staining, and images were acquired for both Hoechst fluorescence and GFP fluorescence by automated microscopy. Images (Fig. S2B ) were analyzed to quantify the number of cell per well (Fig. S2C) , the Tha-GFP intensity in each well (Fig. S2D) , and the percentage of Tha-GFP positive cells (Fig. S2E) . As a functional control measuring RNAi transfection, we targeted polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)-an essential gene for cell viability-which reduced the count of nuclei to less than 5% ( Fig. S2B and C) of the count determined for the scramble siRNA (siNEG). The effective RNA interference of Tha replication was confirmed with small interfering GFP (siGFP) and with siRNA targeting the nucleolin (NCL), which was previously described as a key host factor for RABV (32) . Targeting the GFP reduced the levels of Tha-GFP expression to 30% at 18 h and 7% at 36 h compared to siNEG, while the siNCL reduced cell viability to 70% only at 18 h ( Fig. S2B and C) and Tha-GFP expression to 52% of the intensity at 18 h and 82% at 36 h (Fig. S2B , D, and E). In order to define relevant and specific hits, we analyzed both nucleus counts and Tha-GFP intensity distributions of the population of siRNA duplexes. All siRNAs affecting cell viability at 18 h (Fig. 1A ) and 36 h (Fig. 1B) were labeled toxic (threshold at 30% of siNEG count of nuclei). The mean of the siNEG Tha-GFP intensity was then used to define hits under a 3 threshold as viral helpers and hits over a 2 threshold as viral inhibitors at 18 h (Fig. 1C ) and 36 h (Fig. 1D ). The specificity of the 3 threshold was confirmed by analysis of the controls. At 18 h postinfection, the Tha-GFP signals corresponding to 95% of the level seen with the siGFP-treated well and 45% of the level seen with the siNCL-treated well were under the 3 threshold. At 36 h, 100% of the siGFP-treated wells but none of the siNCL-treated wells had a Tha-GFP signal under the 3 threshold. Therefore, NCL is a key factor for Tha-GFP only in the early stages of the infection, which further validates our system. Finally, only genes confirmed with at least two of three single siRNAs were considered high-confidence key host factors (listed in Table 1 and 2) whereas genes with only one effective siRNA were labeled low-confidence factors in further analysis (listed in Table S1 and S2 in the supplemental material). Using this approach, we were able to identify 54 high-confidence viral helpers for the early stages of the infection and 66 for the late stages of the infection (Fig. 1E ). In comparison, only a few high-confidence viral inhibitors were identified (3 at 18 h and 7 at 36 h) (Fig. 1F) . Interestingly, 24 genes were commonly identified as high-confidence viral helpers at all stages of the infection (Fig. 1G) . Furthermore, 7 high-confidence viral helpers were found to be systematically affecting RABV replication with all three siRNAs, including CDC25C, CHTF18, EPHA7, PPP2CA, and PTPRN at 18 h postinfection and DUSP5 and PRPF4B at 36 h postinfection (Table 1 and 2) . Identifying key functions and pathways involved in RABV infection. In order to identify the main functions and pathways that are taken advantage of during RABV infection, we next used STRING to form a network of genes identified at 18 h (Fig. 2 ) and 36 h (Fig. 3) postinfection. For this purpose, we computed high-confidence hits and low confidence hits, but none of the hits were labeled toxic. Further, only low-confidence hits showing a direct interaction with a high-confidence hit(s) were displayed; where possible, biological functions were attributed to gene clusters by the use of DAVID. At the early stages of the infection, two metabolic pathways were identified as key host factors (Fig. 2) . Among 4 hits involved in sphingolipid metabolism, 2 lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases (PPAP2A and PPAP2B) were defined as a high-confidence viral inhibitor and a viral helper, respectively. Fructose metabolism and mannose metabolism were also identified as important for RABV replication as, in a cluster of 4 genes, 2 phosphofructokinase-biphosphatases (PFKBP1 and PFKBP3) were highconfidence viral helpers. Two genes encoding mitotic checkpoint kinases (AURKA and BUB1B) in a cluster of 5 genes involved in the mitotic spindle were high-confidence viral helper genes (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, numerous other hits defined as viral helpers are involved in mitotic regulation. In particular, CDC25C was shown to be important at both 18 h and 36 h postinfection and all three single siRNAs used against it were shown to affect RABV replication. Further, a significant number of MAPK (MEK1/MAP2K1)associated phosphatases (DUSP5, DUSP7, and DUSP22) and downstream effectors (PAK4 and PAK6) were defined as high-confidence viral helpers among a total of 12 MAPK-associated proteins (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, PAK6 interference was the most effective with respect to RABV replication at 18 h, reducing the Tha-GFP signal to 24% of levels seen with the controls ( Table 1 ). The largest cluster of genes involved as viral helpers of RABV corresponded to inositol phosphate metabolism, with 5 highconfidence hits (INPPL1, INPP5E, MINPP1, MTMR4, and PIK3C2G) among 13 hits (Fig. 2) . This result was linked to two downstream effectors of phosphatidylinositol as well as connecting with the previously described MAPK and inositol phosphate pathways. It is also noteworthy that SRC interference had an inhibitory effect on Tha-GFP at 36 h. However, it was not considered for further analysis as it was also shown to be cytotoxic (Table S2) . At the later stages of the infection, only four gene clusters were associated with a function or pathway (Fig. 3) , and all were already identified at the early stages (Fig. 2) . First, mannose metabolism and fructose metabolism were also shown to be important in the later stages, as a phosphofructokinase-biphosphatase (PFKBP2), a fructosebiphosphatase (FBP2), and pyruvate kinase (PKLR) were high-confidence viral helpers. If we consider the hits labeled "low confidence," FBP2 had already been identified at 18 h and the phosphofructokinase PFKM was identified at both 18 h and 36 h (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, mannose and fructose metabolism interference reduced Tha-GFP signal by 50% at 18 h and by more than 70% at 36 h (Table 2; see also Table S2 ). In addition, high-confidence MAPK (MKK7/MAP2K7) and a downstream effector (PAK6) as well as an associated phosphatase (DUSP5) were again identified as viral helpers at 36 h (Fig. 2) . If we consider the hits labeled "low confidence," PAK4 and MAP2K1 (MEK1) were identified with only one siRNA after 18 h (Fig. 2 ; see also High-confidence (Õ†2 siRNA, black) and low-confidence (1 siRNA, gray) hit interactions were computed using STRING v10.5 and were visualized using Cytoscape v3.4. Only low-confidence hits directly interacting with at least one high-confidence hit are displayed. The Tha-GFP score corresponds to the average GFP signal measured in each active single siRNA normalized to the mean of the data from the siNEG control. Hits were retrospectively marked as validated (*) or OTE (#). tyrosine-phosphatase nonreceptor (PTPN7) as well as many MAPK regulators labeled low confidence (i.e., RPS6KA1, RPS6KA4, ZAK, JAK1, and KSR1) were identified as viral helpers. PAK6 interference was also strongly affecting RABV replication, reducing Tha-GFP signal by 87%, as well as RPS6KA5 (RSK) interference, reducing Tha-GFP signal by 85% (Table 2 ). It should be noted that JNK/MAPK8 was identified as a viral helper with only 1 siRNA at both 18 and 36 h while extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/MAPK1 silencing was associated with cell toxicity (Table S1 and S2). Finally, genes associated with inositol phosphate metabolism also constituted the largest cluster observed at 36 h with 7 high-confidence hits (IMPAD1, NPP1, INPP5E, ITPKB, MINPP1, PIK3C2G, and PIP5K1C) among 17 hits (Fig. 3) . Among them, ITPKB interference reduced Tha-GFP signal by 70% whereas the other genes were associated with a 50% to 60% decrease of Tha-GFP signal ( Table 2) . To provide a comprehensive overview of the most prominent pathways identified as key factors for RABV infection cycle, all the high-confidence hits for both the early and late infection stages were mapped on the MAPK signaling (Fig. 4) , PI metabolism (Fig. 5 ), PI signaling system (Fig. S3) , and mannose and fructose metabolism (Fig. S4 ) pathways using KEGG Pathways. Confirmation of key host factors. First, we investigated a selection of highconfidence hits using the C911 method (33) to determine whether the inhibition of RABV could have been due to off-target effects (OTE) or if it was specific to the siRNA/target identified (Table S2) . Briefly, the C911 method is based on the design of mismatch siRNAs that carry OTE but lose on-target effects. We selected a single siRNA for high-confidence hits that are present at different levels in the MAPK pathway (MKK7/MAP2K7, DUSP5, and RPS6KA5) or the PI3K pathway (PIP5K1C, MTM1, MINPP1, and PIK3C2G) or that are involved in mRNA capping (PRPF4B and RNGTT) or are associated with various other cellular functions (NRBP2, NEK4, ERN1, and FYN). As the C911-modified siRNA should not affect the targets, we were able to demonstrate that the following hits were clearly subject to OTE: RPS6KA5, MINPP1, PIK3C2G, PRPF4B, RNGTT, and FYN (Fig. 6 ). Both siMAP2K7 (MKK7) and siDUSP5 of the MAPK pathway reached 100% inhibition compared to siGFP (Fig. 6) , a level significantly higher than that seen with their C911 target (P Ï½ 0.001). Both siPIP5K1C and siMTM1 of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) pathway were seen to inhibit Tha-GFP compared to their C911 target (P Ï½ 0.05), providing 25% and 45% inhibition, respectively. Furthermore, NEK4 but not its C911 target (P Ï½ 0.05) inhibited 39% of Tha-GFP replication and both NRBP2 and ERN1 inhibited Ï³20% of Tha-GFP but the levels were not statistically significantly different from those seen with their C911 target (P Ï­ 0.054 and P Ï­ 0.103, respectively). NEK4, involved in replicative senescence, has never been found to be associated with host-virus interactions (34) . This confirmed that the hits identified in the RNAi screening-in particular, the hits from both the MAPK and phosphatydilinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) pathways-are important for RABV replication. The importance of the most prominent pathways was assessed with a small-scale compound screening experiment based on MAPK and PI3P pathway inhibitors cherrypicked in our compound libraries (Sigma and Selleckchem). In total, 10 MAPK inhibitors (Table S4) were tested using 10 concentration points ranging from 10 M to 5 nM. The compound screening was first run on HEK293T cells infected with Tha-GFP to validate the system used for the RNAi screening. At 18 h (Fig. S5A) , we were able to fit dose-response curves to 8 inhibitors (Ro 31-8220 mesylate, D-609, idelalisib, NSC663284, PD98059, SD169, SL327, and wortmannin), among which 1 (Ro 31-8220 mesylate) was cytotoxic and 2 (NSC663284 and SD169) showed a trend toward significance but gave results that were above the level seen with the control (DMSO [dimethyl sulfoxide]). At 36 h (Fig. S5B) , only PD198603 and Ro 31-8220 mesylate data were fitted to a dose-response curve. As expected, Ro 31-8220 mesylate appeared to be cytotoxic in HEK293T cells. PD198306 was significantly inhibiting Tha-GFP replication by 25% at the highest concentration tested, 10 M, after 36 h (GFP intensity of 3.10 7 opposed to 4.10 7 in DMSO). To confirm our hits in a more relevant model for RABV infection, we treated human neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) with the selected compounds. Using a newly generated Tha-Crimson recombinant virus that provides a better signal/noise ratio in neurons than Tha-GFP, we observed consistent results 18 h (Fig. S6A) and 36 h (Fig. S6B) postinfection. Among 14 compounds, one (NSC663284) was cytotoxic at concentrations above 5 M (Fig. S6A and S6B ) and 3 compounds had an inhibitory effect on Tha-Crimson at 18 h (Fig. S6A) and 36 h (Fig. 7 ; see also Fig. S6B ). PD198306 inhibited Tha-Crimson replication at 10 M (Fig. 7A) , reducing it by 30% at 18 h (Fig. S6A ) and 50% at 36 h (Fig. 7) . Furthermore, PD198306 5 M reduced Tha-Crimson replication significantly by 20% at 18 h (Fig. S6A ) but such a result could not be confirmed at 36 h. In addition, Ro 31-8220 mesylate at 1.25 M inhibited Tha-Crimson replication significantly by 12% at 18 h (Fig. S6A) and by 28% at 36 h (Fig. 7) . At 2.5 M, Ro 31-8220 mesylate inhibited Tha-Crimson replication by 23% at 18 h (Fig. S6A) and by 55% at 36 h (Fig. 7) . Finally, wortmannin inhibited Tha-Crimson replication by 10% from 2.5 M at 18 h (Fig. S6A ) and by 20% from 5 M at 36 h (Fig. 7) . Several only at a high concentration, suggesting that it could be dependent on the presence of secondary targets, including ERK and PI3K. The lack of cytotoxicity of PD 198306 suggests that it is not related to SRC (Table S1 and S2). As several cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) were shown to be involved in RABV replication (Table S1 and S2), it is possible that CDKs mediate PD 198306 inhibition of RABV. Ro 31-8220 mesylate, which targets PKC and MAPK effectors, was the most effective inhibitor of RABV. It should be noted that in the siRNA screening (Table S1 and The data corresponding to the latter were fitted using nonlinear regression. Each value represents the mean of data from 2 separate wells, and error bars represent standard deviations. Data corresponding to differences between the results seen with the compounds and the results seen with DMSO were assessed using ANOVA in Prism 7 (GraphPad).
