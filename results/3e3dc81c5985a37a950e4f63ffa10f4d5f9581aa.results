Evaluation of primers for detection of begomoviruses by RPA RPA, using primer pair TYL828F/TYL834R, generated a single amplicon band of 464 bp from TYLCV-infected leaf tissues in all three host plants (tomato, bean, tobacco). Only a very low amplification background was present in non-inoculated tissues of the same host species (Fig. 1a) . No amplicons of the expected size were generated from DNA extracted from non-inoculated plants. The same primer pair did not amplify the expected size amplicon in DNA extracted from bean plants infected with BGYMV, EuMV, SiGMoV or ToMoV (Fig. 1b) . Similar results were observed with RPA and primer pairs, BGY1141F/BGY1142R and ToMo1131F/ ToMo1139R, designed to generate amplicons from BGYMV and ToMoV, respectively (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). The identity of the amplicons generated by all three primer pairs were confirmed by direct sequencing. The condition of the tissue (fresh, frozen or desiccated) did not appear to have an impact on amplification. Results with primer pair TYL828F/TYL834R are shown (Fig. 1a) . Similarly, RPA and primer pairs BGY1141F/ BGY1142R and ToMo1131F/ToMo1139R generated the expected size amplicons regardless of whether the DNA was extracted from fresh leaf tissue or from leaves stored at −20°C (data not shown). All primer pairs tested generated amplicons of the expected sizes by PCR and by RPA.
