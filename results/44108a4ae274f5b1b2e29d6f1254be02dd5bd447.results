A two-hybrid screen to identify interaction partners of AAV8 capsid proteins To gain insight into the mechanism of AAV8 transduction, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify host cellular proteins capable of interacting with portions of the AAV8 capsid. We fused the Gal4p DNA-binding domain to portions of the AAV8 capsid homologous to regions of the AAV2 capsid that contain most of the exposed residues. The resulting bait (encoding residues 147-623 of the AAV8 VP1 capsid protein) was used to screen a mouse liver cDNA-Gal4p activation domain library under highly stringent conditions, requiring the activation of two different Gal4p-binding-dependent reporter genes (ade2 and his3). Sufficient yeast cells were transformed with both the bait and library (containing an estimated 3.5 million clones) plasmids to provide a 1.5-fold coverage of the library. We recovered 700 clones capable of activating both reporter genes, allowing the cells to grow on the selection media ( Figure 1 ). Sequence analyses of the plasmid DNA from these clones revealed the identity of 313 different genes. Among these, 108 were repeatedly recovered from multiple independent colonies (listed in Table 1 ), suggesting that their interaction with the AAV8 bait was strong and genuine. The proteins encoded by these 108 genes belonged to a wide range of protein classes ( Figure 2 ), including plasma membrane proteins (potentially acting as viral receptors on the cell surface) and proteases, which could theoretically contribute to viral uncoating during AAV cellular transduction. In fact, two particularly interesting candidates recovered in our screen were cathepsins B and L, endosomal proteins previously implicated in the uncoating of numerous other viruses, such as Ebola and reovirus. 24, 25 As AAV transduction depends on virus trafficking through the endosome, we decided to further investigate the potential role of these two cathepsins in this step of the AAV life cycle. AAV2 and AAV8 capsid proteins interact specifically with the preys We first aimed to verify the specificity of the screen, and to determine the relative strength of the interactions. Therefore, we measured the activation of a Gal4p-dependent lacZ reporter gene in yeast transformed with the AAV8 bait and several clones of interest recovered from our screen. We included those encoding the cathepsin B and L proteases, as well as clones encoding histidine-rich glycoprotein (a serum adaptor protein thought to mediate attachment to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans 26 ), DAZ-associated protein 2 (a cytoplasmic factor thought to be involved in cell signaling 27 ) , and importin 13. The results were compared to bait plasmids containing the homologous regions of the AAV2 or AAV5 capsid (which are 83 and 61% similar to AAV8, respectively), or with an empty bait plasmid. As shown in Figure 3 , the activity of the recovered clones with the AAV8 bait was significantly higher (three-to seven-fold) as compared to the empty control, confirming that the interaction between these independent protein domains was indeed specific. Interestingly, the AAV2 bait was also able to interact with each of the candidate preys, a result that was not surprising in the light of the large sequence similarity between the AAV2 and AAV8 capsids. In contrast to both AAV2 and AAV8, reporter gene activation with the AAV5-based capsid bait was not significantly different from the empty plasmid control for most of the tested clones, including the cathepsin-encoding preys. From these examples, we conclude that the majority of the physical interactions identified in our screen were indeed specific. Cathepsins B and L are involved in functional AAV2 and AAV8 transduction Having confirmed the interaction of AAV8 capsid proteins with cathepsin B and L in yeast, we sought to determine whether these two proteases played a role in AAV8-mediated transduction of mammalian cells. To this end, we incubated murine fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells with Ca074-Me, a cell-permeable cathepsin inhibitor that preferentially blocks cathepsin B activity, and also inhibits cathepsin L at high doses. Four hours later, gfp-encoding AAV2 or AAV8 vectors were added to the cells. The number of green fluorescent protein GFP-expressing cells was determined 1 day later and compared to samples infected in the absence of inhibitor. Interestingly, both AAV2-and AAV8-mediated transduction was significantly reduced up to three times in a nasal embryonic LHRH factor AF266508 2 The Genbank accession numbers of fourteen genes of unknown function recovered in the screen are listed here, along with the numbers of clones recovered for each in parentheses: BC051545 (5), NM_025791 (5), NM_026690 (4), (2), and AK220316 (2) dose-dependent manner by Ca074-Me treatment (Figure 4a) , suggesting that cathepsin B and L activity is important for transduction with these two serotypes. This result was further validated using a series of control experiments. Firstly, when the assay was conducted with AAV5(gfp), we only observed a decrease in vector transduction at a high dose of inhibitor (40 mM). This apparent inhibitory effect was most likely nonspecific as the use of a lower inhibitor dose (20 mM) actually resulted in a slight increase in AAV5(gfp) transduction. Secondly, when we transfected cells with a plasmid expressing a destabilized GFP protein (with a half-life of 2 h) before Ca074-Me treatment, we likewise observed a marginal increase in the number of GFP-positive cells, ruling out inhibitory effects on gene expression from the drug per se. Thirdly, when we tested the non-cell-permeable version of the drug, Ca074, as well as the cathepsin L inhibitor Z-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)-diazomethyl ketone, we found no significant change in transduction efficiency by the AAV2 and AAV8 vectors (data not shown). To further study the role of cathepsins B and L in AAV2-and AAV8-mediated transduction, NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with cathepsin B or L expression plasmids before being infected with the same AAV(gfp) vectors used above. Western blot analysis confirmed that cells transfected with the expression vectors had increased levels of cathepsin B or L as compared to control cells transfected with an empty plasmid (data not shown). Transduction by AAV2 and AAV8 vectors was increased at least twofold in cells overexpressing cathepsin B or L, whereas no significant change was seen with the AAV5 vector (Figure 4b) , confirming that cathepsin B and L activity is important for AAV2 and AAV8 infection. In vitro cleavage of AAV particles by cathepsins B and L Having established a functional role of cathepsins B and L in cellular transduction by AAV2 and AAV8, we next measured the ability of purified cathepsins to bind and cleave the assembled AAV particles. To this end, we treated 1 Ã‚ 10 9 recombinant particles of AAV serotypes 2, 5 or 8 with purified cathepsin B, cathepsin L, or a control cysteine protease not recovered in our screen, cathepsin S. Viral proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting, using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the capsid proteins of all three serotypes. As expected, we found a strong reduction in the levels of AAV2 and AAV8 full-length VP3 protein, after incubation with cathepsin B or L, a result consistent with the predicted cleavage of the viral capsid proteins by these two proteases (Figure 5a) . Importantly, the specificity of this cleavage was confirmed with the cathepsin S negative control, where VP3 levels remained stable under otherwise identical experimental conditions. Moreover, addition of the Ca074-Me cathepsin inhibitor to the reaction abolished AAV capsid cleavage by cathepsin B or L, confirming that their activity was responsible for the observed digestion (Figure 5b) . Finally, none of the three tested cathepsins were able to cleave the AAV5 VP3 protein. This result is consistent with our two-hybrid data, which indicated that the AAV2-and AAV8-based capsid baits, but not the AAV5-based counterpart, could physically interact with the cathepsin preys. Cathepsin cleavage patterns are AAV serotype specific Although cathepsins B and L generated similar cleavage products within a given AAV serotype (2 or 8), we observed that the exact peptide pattern differed between the two viral isolates. To analyze this phenomenon in more detail, we resolved the digested capsid proteins on a high-percentage (12.5%) polyacrylamide gel. This was followed by immunoblotting with two distinct antibodies, allowing us to differentiate between C-terminal peptide fragments and the more upstream cleavage products. We found that the AAV8 capsid was digested into two fragments of approximately 35 and 27 kDa in size, with the upper band being the C-terminal fragment, as evidenced by its recognition by the B1 antibody (which binds an epitope found in the VP3 C-terminus) (Figure 5c ). In contrast, AAV2 particle digestion resulted in three predominant bands with sizes of approximately 50, 30, and 13 kDa, as detected by the polyclonal a-VP1,2,3 serum. Additionally, we noted a fourth band of around 20 kDa upon overexposure of the blot (as it was fainter than the other bands, we hypothesize that this polypeptide contained fewer epitopes bound by the polyclonal antibody). Interestingly, upon overexposure of the blots, the undigested AAV2 and AAV8 samples also displayed trace amounts of the same cleavage products. One possible explanation for this observation is that the purified AAV vectors contain a small sub-population of viral capsids that had been processed by cellular cathepsins before purification. As the sum of the AAV2 cleavage product bands exceeded the size of the full-length AAV2 VP3 protein (63 kDa), we reasoned that one or more of them probably represented a partial cleavage product. Indeed, subsequent immunoblotting with the B1 antibody revealed that only the smallest 13 kDa peptide contained the C-terminal B1 epitope, suggesting that together with the N-terminal 50 kDa product it formed the fulllength VP3 protein. We, moreover, hypothesized that the two intermediate bands of 30 and 20 kDa detected with the polyclonal antibody resulted from secondary cleavage of the large 50 kDa fragment, especially as none of these three bands was recognized by the B1 antibody. Accordingly, the presence of a substantial amount of the 50 kDa precursor peptide would indicate that this particular reaction occurs inefficiently, or that this cleavage site is only accessible on a subset of all VP3 subunits within the assembled AAV2 capsid. In contrast to this apparent two-step cleavage process for AAV2, our finding of only two bands for AAV8, whose sizes add up to full-length VP3, suggests that this particular serotype is cleaved only once and more efficiently than AAV2. This idea was indeed confirmed when the cleavage rates of the two vectors were compared, by partially digesting them with increasing amounts of cathepsin B. Intriguingly, AAV8 VP3 levels were reduced more readily than those of AAV2 when both were incubated with the same amount of enzyme, further indicating that AAV8 capsid cleavage may be more efficient than that of AAV2 ( Figure 5d ). As will be discussed below, the differential cleavage rates and patterns could explain some of the differences in the transduction rate and kinetics seen with AAV2 and AAV8.
