Ten isolates of SARS coronavirus from 10 different patients with SARS admitted to different hospitals in HK-SAR showing seroconversion towards the prototype virus infected fRhK-4 cell line were used in this study (Table 1) . They were isolated from the lung tissue biopsy (prototype virus, M39849), urine, and nasopharyngeal aspirates. Initial screening of 20 commercially available antimicrobial agents against the prototype virus grown in fRhK-4 cell line did not reveal inhibitory activities for acyclovir, ganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet, interferon-alpha-2a, interferon-alpha-2b, amantadine, zidovudine, stavudine, nevirapine, abacavir, and ritonavir. Inhibitory activities were not detectable for glycyrrhizin, artesunate and chlorogenic acid in fRhK-4 cell line. Glycyrrhizin was still included for further testing because this was reported to be active in Vero-E6 cell lines (Cinatl et al., 2003a) . Further testing by neutralization tests Table 3 Comparison of antiviral activity of 10 compounds against 10 strains of SARS-CoV in fRhK4 cell line, against the prototype strains (39849) with the other 9 isolates of SARS coronavirus against the active compounds confirmed detectable inhibitory activities for leukocytic interferon-alpha, interferon-beta-1a, ribavirin, lopinavir, rimantadine, and baicalin. The range of their effective concentration of compound required to reduce the plaque forming unit by 50% (EC 50 ) at 48 and 72 h, and their selectivity index are shown in Table 3 . When the same neutralization test on these compounds was run in Vero-E6 cell line, rimandatine, glycyrrhizin, leukocytic interferon-alpha and interferon-beta were more active especially at 72 h. Moreover, pre-incubation of the cell lines with these two interferons for 16 h before adding the virus markedly enhanced the inhibitory activity by three to over 100-fold. But ribavirin, lopinavir, and baicalin were less active in the Vero-E6 cell line (Table 3) . As for the plaque reduction assay, Vero cell lines were used instead of Vero E6 or fRhK-4 cell lines because antiviral activity can be demonstrated for most of the agents. Only interferon-beta-1a, leukocytic interferon-alpha, lopinavir, ribavirin, rimantadine, and baicalin were tested. The EC 50 of interferon-beta-1a (8 U/ml), leukocytic interferon-alpha (30 U/ml), lopinavir (6 g/ml), ribavirin (50 g/ml), rimantadine (7 g/ml), and baicalin (11 g/ml) are comparable to the results obtained from CPE assays. Tests for synergism between ribavirin and lopinavir have already been reported (Chu et al., 2004) . No synergism could be demonstrated between rimantadine and ribavirin. The most active compounds are the interferons. Thus further checkerboard assays were performed with combinations of leukocytic interferon-alpha or interferon-beta-1a, and ribavirin. Marked synergism was seen at both 72 and 96 h. The combination of leukocytic interferon-alpha (78 g/ml) and ribavirin (25 g/ml) or interferon-beta-1a (312.5 g/ml) and ribavirin (25 g/ml) were shown to be active at 96 h of incubation (Table 4) .
