Most H7N9 cases have been reported from Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces, from where occurrences were aggregated, whereas occurrences in Beijing, Shandong, Henan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces were more sporadic and scattered ( Figure 1 ). Environmental variation across the range of H7N9 is quite dramatic (Figure 1) , with highest NDVI values observed in southern China; the independent variation in the principal components can be appreciated in Figure 1 . In model evaluations, our niche models showed good performance in anticipating the spatial distribution of independent testing records in three of the four tests (P,0.05; Table 1; Figure 2 ). Omission rates in models with longitude-based subsetting were higher than in models with latitude-based subsetting (Table 1) , which might result from the broader geographic spread in longitude ( Figure 2 ). In final model predictions, environmental variables with highest gain [14] in isolation were principal component 5 and standard deviation of the entire period; environmental variables that decreased gain most when omitted were principal component 1 and standard deviation of the entire period. In final models, models based on both environmental datasets identified a particularly suitable zone in east-central China, including Shanghai, Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, northwestern Fujian and Jiangxi, and parts of Anhui provinces (Figure 3) . The model based on the 'bioNDVI' dataset was somewhat more conservative in predictions. Hubei Province was identified as highly suitable, although no H7N9 cases have been reported there ( Figure 3 ). Suitable areas in the north were distributed less continuously, whereas suitable areas in the south were only along the coast. Western Taiwan was also identified as highly suitable by models based on both environmental datasets ( Figure 3 ). Attempting to visualize conditions under which models identified suitability, suitable areas tended to present conditions that were generally constant through the year (i.e. not much seasonal variation), with only gentle seasonal fluctuations. Unsuitable areas, in contrast, showed much more seasonal variation: NDVI values rose sharply in June-August and declined during September-December (Figure 4 ).
