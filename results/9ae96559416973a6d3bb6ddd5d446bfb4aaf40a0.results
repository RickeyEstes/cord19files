MDV tumor incidence. Treatment groups were compared to the positive control group (G6), in which all chickens developed tumors (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1 ). Chickens in group 1 that received ECpG and HVT at ED18, and ECpG again at 14 dpi showed 40% tumors which was statistically significant compared to positive control chickens (p = 0.002, Fig. 1 ). Chickens in group 2 which received ECpG and HVT at ED18 developed the lowest tumor incidence compared to positive control chickens (33.33%, p = 0.001). In HVT only group (G4), 53.33% of the chickens exhibited tumors, which was significantly different compared to positive control chickens Figure 1 . Presence of tumors in different treatment groups. Experimental groups were as follows: G1-ECpG and HVT were administered at ED18 and the second dose of ECpG was injected at 14 dpi. G2-ECpG and HVT were administered at ED18. G3-HVT was administered at ED18 and ECpG was given at 14 dpi. G4-HVT was administered at ED18. G5-ECpG was injected at 14 dpi. G6-Untreated, MDV-infected group. G7-PBS control group. Chickens in all groups were infected with MDV at d5 except G7. Presence of tumors was recorded at 21 dpi. Data were statistically analyzed by Fisher's exact test in GraphPad Prism 6.04. p ≤ 0.05 (*) was considered statistically significant compared to G6. (p = 0.01, Fig. 1 ). In G3 and G5, 72.72% and 90% of the chickens developed tumors respectively (Fig. 1 ). There was no statistically significant difference in tumor incidence between chickens in G4 and ECpG administered groups (G1, G2 and G3). However, the highest reduction in tumor incidence was observed in chickens in G2 (Fig. 1) . Therefore, it seems that ECpG partially improved the HVT induced protection against MD. MDV genome copy numbers in feathers. At 4 dpi, there was no genome detected in feather DNA. MDV load gradually increased throughout the experiment and was at the highest level at 21 dpi (Fig. 2) . Chickens in group 2, 3 and 4 had significantly lower MDV load in feathers at 21 dpi when compared to that of G6 (p < 0.0001, Fig. 2 ). In addition, significantly lower MDV load was detected in G4 chickens when compared to G1 and G5 chickens (p < 0.0001, Fig. 2 ). Unfortunately, administration of ECpG was unable to enhance the HVT induced reduction of MDV load in feathers. Organ weight indices. At 4 dpi, bursa of Fabricius weight to body weight (BF:BW) ratios were significantly higher in G4, G5 and G6 chickens when compared to the chickens in the PBS control group (G7) (p < 0.0001, Fig. 3A ). Although at 4 dpi BF:BW ratios in G1, G2 and G3 chickens were almost similar when compared to G7 chickens, they were significantly different from that of G6 chickens (p < 0.0001, Fig. 3A ). At 10 dpi, G2, G5 and G6 chickens showed significantly lower BF:BW ratios when compared to G7 chickens (p = 0.0001). However, G3 chickens exhibited significantly higher ratios when compared to G6 chickens (p = 0.0001, Fig. 3A ). At 21 dpi, chickens in all MDV-infected groups showed significantly lower BF:BW ratios when compared to G7 chickens Figure 2 . MDV genome copy numbers in feathers in different treatment groups. MDV genome copy numbers per 100 ng of DNA were calculated from feathers collected at 4, 10 and 21 dpi. The different experimental groups were: G1-ECpG and HVT were administered at ED18 and the second dose of ECpG was injected at 14 dpi. G2-ECpG and HVT were administered at ED18. G3-HVT was administered at ED18 and ECpG was given at 14 dpi. G4-HVT was administered at ED18. G5-ECpG was injected at 14 dpi. G6-Untreated, MDV-infected group. G7-PBS control group. Chickens in all groups were infected with MDV at d5 except G7. Data were statistically analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test in GraphPad Prism 6.04. p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant (*). Comparisons were made between groups as indicated or with positive control group G6. Error bars indicate the standard errors of the mean. The different experimental groups were: G1-ECpG and HVT were administered at ED18 and the second dose of ECpG was injected at 14 dpi. G2-ECpG and HVT were administered at ED18. G3-HVT was administered at ED18 and ECpG was given at 14 dpi. G4-HVT was administered at ED18. G5-ECpG was injected at 14 dpi. G6-Untreated, MDV-infected group. G7-PBS control group. Chickens in all groups were infected with MDV at d5 except G7. Data were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA and followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test in GraphPad Prism 6.04. p ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant when compared to G7 (*) or G6 (#) or G4 (φ). Error bars indicate the standard errors of the mean. (p < 0.0001, Fig. 3A ). However, the ratio was significantly higher in G4 when compared to G6 (p < 0.0001, Fig. 3A ). This indicates that HVT vaccine can partially inhibit bursal atrophy induced by MDV. At 4 dpi, spleen:BW ratios were significantly higher in G4, G5 and G6 chickens when compared to G7 chickens and ratios were significantly lower in G1, G2 and G3 chickens when compared to G6 chickens (p < 0.0001, Fig. 3B ). At 10 dpi, chickens in all groups which received MDV except G3 had significantly higher spleen:BW ratios when compared to G7, and G3 chickens had significantly lower spleen:BW ratios when compared to G6 chickens (p < 0.0001, Fig. 3B ). At 21 dpi, G5 chickens showed significantly higher spleen:BW ratio when compared to G7 chickens (p < 0.0015, Fig. 3B ). However, G4 chickens showed significantly lower ratio when compared to G6 chickens (p < 0.0015, Fig. 3B ).
