A total of 26 students were observed making 2,346 touches to the face over 240 minutes. Of the face touches, 56% (1,322/2,346) involved nonmucosal regions, whereas 44% (1,024/2,346) involved contact with mucosal membranes. Of the 1,322 nonmucosal membrane touches, most involved the chin (31%; 409/1,322), followed by the cheek (29%; 383/1,322), hair (28%; 369/1,322), neck (8%; 104/1,322), and ear (4%; 57/1,322). Of the 1,024 touches involving a mucosal membrane region, 36% (372/1,024) involved the mouth, 31% (318/1,024) involved the nose, 27% (273/1,024) involved the eyes, and 6% (61/1,024) involved a combination of the mucosal membranes. During an average hour participants touched their face 23 times (median, 29.0 times; LQ (lower quartile), 42.2; UQ, 108.2; range, 4-153). The average duration of mouth touching was 2 seconds (median, 1 second; LQ, 3.0; UQ (upper quartile), 24.0; range, 1-12 seconds), the average nose touching duration was 1 second (median, <1 second; LQ, 0.09; UQ, 1.2; range, 1-10 seconds), and the average eye touching duration was 1 second (median, <1 second; LQ, 3.0; UQ, 11.5; range, 1-5 seconds).
