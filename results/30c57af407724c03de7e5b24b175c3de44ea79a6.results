In this study, we identified 52.25% (n = 2051) patients with a medical history of TB who had visited CM clinics and had CM outpatient clinical records of TB or respiratory diseases (Fig. 1 ). Those who were female, younger (18-39 y/o), and lived in higher urbanized areas (levels 1 and 2) were relatively more likely to use CM. The median duration between newly diagnosed TB and the first CM consultation was 1068 days (Table 1) . Regarding the treatment modes employed among the CM users, approximately 95% of CM users (n = 1944) received only Chinese medicines, 5.2% of patients received combined treatment with both Chinese medicines and acupuncture, and the remaining 0.2% of patients received only acupuncture treatments. Among all CM users (patients with a medical history of TB who had visited CM clinics and had CM outpatient clinical records of TB or respiratory diseases; n = 2051), 90.15% visited CM clinics 1-3 times annually, while 4.58% patients consulted CM doctors more than 6 times/year ( Table 2) . The frequency distribution of disease categories related to respiratory discomforts and comorbidities that patients who had been diagnosed TB was analyzed (Table 3) . Compared to the non-CM users, the frequencies of outpatient visits among TB patients who used CM were statistically higher across almost all discomforts and comorbidities, except swelling, mass, and lump in chest (Table 3 ). More than 70% of TB patients used CM because of acute respiratory infections, cough, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and allied conditions, and other diseases of upper respiratory tract. These results could indicate the comorbidities and complications of TB and may serve as an explanation for why TB patients complicated with long-term respiratory discomforts turn to CM doctors for help (Table 3) . We further investigated the prescription pattern of Chinese medicines and identified the ten most commonly prescribed formulas and single herbs. The ten most commonly prescribed single herbs and herbal formulas were analyzed and are listed in Tables 4 and 5 , respectively. The most commonly prescribed herbal formulas and single herb were Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang, and Radix Platycodonis (Jie-Geng), respectively. We further conducted a network analysis and found that the core patterns of herbal formulas and herbs prescribed for TB patients consisted of Ma-Xing-Gan-Shi-Tang, Bulbus Fritillariae Thunbergii (Bei-Mu), Radix Platycodonis (Jie-Geng), and Semen Armeniacae (Xing-Ren) (Fig. 2) . We further summarized these findings in Fig. 3 .
