A total of 431 bats from 7 species were trapped and sampled (Table 1) . Astroviruses were only detected in Eonycteris spelaea (30/ 169, 17.8%) and Rhinolophus lepidus (13/36, 36.1%), with an overall detection rate of 9.9% for the pooled oral-rectal swabs (Fig. 1) The astroviruses phylogeny showed that the majority of bat astroviruses (indicated by grey branches) were basal to other mammalian astroviruses, but with a general lack of statistical support (Fig. 3) . The 38 novel bat astroviruses sequences collected in Singapore (denoted by red branches in Fig. 3 ) fell into 2 groups. Two bat astrovirus sequences identified from R. lepidus formed a monophyletic clade (bootstrap [BS] = 100%) that clustered within other Rhinolophus astroviruses from China and Laos (BS < 60%). Similarly, 36 astroviruses sequences from E. spelaea formed a monophyletic lineage (BS = 69%) with two distinct sub-clades, and this lineage was closely related to other pteropodid bat astroviruses from Bangladesh and Laos. Furthermore, the clustering of all E. spelaea astrovirus sequences, despite being collected in different years, suggests sustained transmission in this host. The astroviruses from R. lepidus and E. spelaea from Singapore were genetically dissimilar (nucleotide sequence identity 54.0-57.2%) even though their sampling locations and collection periods were similar. Interestingly, we revealed phylogenetically diverse astroviruses among E. spelaea bats, with at least two distinctive groups (Clade 1 and 2). Clade 1 (BS = 69%) is further composed of three smaller sub-clades (designated as a-c). Clade 1a (nucleotide identity 60.8-99.2%) includes 4 E. spelaea astroviruses from Singapore (BS = 100%) whereas the other comprises one Pteropus giganteus astrovirus from Bangladesh and a Rousettus sp. astrovirus from Laos. Clade 1b (BS = 65%; nucleotide identity 64.8-100%) is composed of Rousettus astroviruses from Laos. Clade 1c (nucleotide identity: 66.8-99.2%) includes astroviruses from E. spelaea (Singapore) and Rousettus leschenaultia (Laos). Both Singapore E. spelaea astrovirus clades were collected in the same sampling period. Clade 2 (BS = 51%; nucleotide identity 65.3-99.2%) contains two E. spelaea astroviruses, one Rhinolophus astrovirus and numerous Rousettus astroviruses, all from Laos. This suggests that E. spelaea astroviruses from Singapore are closely related to those of Laos Rousettus spp., yet are distantly related to Laos E. spelaea astroviruses. Clade 2 further displays the close phylogenetic relationship between E. spelaea and Rousettus spp. astroviruses (BS = 61%), all occurring in Laos. It is likely that the co-roosting of these bat species facilitated the interspecies virus transmission. The most predictive model for astrovirus infection included bat age and bat species: log(p/1 − p) = β o + β 1 (Bat Age) + β 2 (Bat Species). In the crude analysis, bat age was found to be a significant risk factor for astrovirus, (OR: 0.44, P: 0.02, 95% CI: 0.22-0.90) providing evidence that astroviruses were less likely to be detected in adults. Thus we estimate the odds of astrovirus infection to be reduced by 56% given an adult bat. Similarly, unadjusted bat species was a strong indicator of astrovirus, (OR: 2.62, P: 0.02, 95% CI: 1.19-5.75); thus, it is estimated that the odds of contracting astrovirus infection are~2.6× greater among Rhinolophus lepidus bats as compared to the referent group Eonycteris spelaea bat. The five remaining species were automatically eliminated from the model, as none of them predicted astrovirus (astrovirus detection rate = 0%). However, adjusting for bat age in the larger model displayed more modest evidence for a bat age effect (OR: 0.59, P: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.26-1.34). Although, bat species did not appear to be an important confounder in the bat age/astrovirus relationship (determined by the adjusted bat age odds ratio lying between the 95% CI in the unadjusted model). Hence, the evidence in these data suggest, but are insufficient to conclude, that bat age has an independent effect on astrovirus outcome beyond that of bat species (Table 3) .
