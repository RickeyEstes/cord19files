Characteristics of the study population. Baseline characteristics of the participants are described in Supplementary Table 1 . All volunteers were screened for pneumococcal carriage at baseline (Fig. 1) ; individuals positive for natural pneumococcal carriage were excluded from further analysis (n = 4; 3%). We analysed all 451 samples of 117 participants in total by 16S-based sequencing and lytA-quantitative PCR (qPCR) (Supplementary Table 2 ). Additionally, 115/116 baseline samples were screened for viral coinfection. As more extensively described in a separate manuscript 15, 16 , 49 (41.9%) of the volunteers became high-dense and 27 (23.1%) became low-dense carriers. The remaining volunteers (n = 41 [35.0%]) were negative for pneumococcal carriage at either day 2, 7 or 9 (i.e. non-carriers). Carriage outcome was also tightly related to pneumococcal density of carriage as calculated by area under the log 10 -transformed (lytA) density-time curve (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Baseline nasopharyngeal microbiota composition. After sequencing and quality control, we observed a total of 343 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), representing 13 bacterial phyla. The presence of natural viral co-infection at baseline was detected in 9.6% of samples. We first assessed the associations between baseline nasal microbiota composition, natural viral co-infection (i.e. before pneumococcal inoculation and vaccination) and pneumococcal carriage outcome. We detected a significant association between baseline nasal microbiota composition and consecutive pneumococcal carriage outcome. This effect was stronger for carriage 3 outcome, that is, when volunteers were stratified in high-dense, low-dense and non-carriers based on both conventional culture and qPCR data (permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PER-MANOVA), R 2 = 3.1%, p = 0.048; Fig. 2 , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2 ), compared to carriage 2 outcome, where volunteers were dichotomized in carriers or non-carriers based on culturing only (Supplementary Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table 3A ). The importance of semi-quantitative information on pneumococcal density in these analyses was further supported by a borderline significant association between baseline microbiota composition and density of pneumococcal colonization at day 2 (R 2 = 1.7%, p = 0.076; Supplementary Table 3B ). Interestingly, volunteers who became low-dense carriers demonstrated the lowest presence of natural respiratory viruses at baseline (before intervention) and showed the lowest rate of (replicating) influenza virus following LAIV vaccination compared to both high-dense and non-carriers (Supplementary Table 4 ). These associations were independent (Supplementary Table 4E ). We thus studied the potential interaction between viral co-infection, microbiota composition and pneumococcal carriage 3 outcome; we observed that the association between baseline microbiota and pneumococcal carriage acquisition was dependent on viral co-infection at baseline, but not on LAIV vaccination (p = 0.011 and p = 0.640, respectively; Table 1 ). Stratified analysis suggests, however, that the association between microbiota and carriage 3 outcome was slightly weaker for the LAIV cohort compared to the control cohort (R 2 = 2.9 vs. R 2 = 4.2%, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 3B and 3C), suggesting interactions between both natural viral co-infection and iatrogenic LAIV infection, and (1) baseline nasal microbiota and (2) pneumococcal carriage receptiveness. Baseline microbiota clusters and pneumococcal challenge. To assess microbiota dynamics we performed an average linkage hierarchical clustering using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. We found 18 clusters of microbiota profiles, of which 8 clusters comprised of ≥10 samples, representing in total 418/451 samples (Supplementary Fig. 4) . We identified the OTUs that discriminated most between clusters using a random forest algorithm (referred to as biomarker species; Supplementary Fig. 5A ). The largest cluster (STA; n = 132 [31.6%]) was characterized by Staphylococcus spp., followed by a cluster typified by several Corynebacterium (of which the most abundant was Corynebacterium [3] ) and Table 5 ). In line with previous findings, the cluster distribution at baseline was significantly different between low-dense and non-carriers (Fisher's exact test with Monte Carlo simulation; p = 0.039). Baseline differences were related to a higher proportion of CDG profiles in low-dense carriers vs. non-carriers (37.0 vs. 10.8%, respectively, p = 0.042). Contrariwise, although non-significant, low-dense carriers specifically lacked STA-dominated profiles compared to both noncarriers (18.5 vs. 43.2%, respectively, p = 0.058) and high-dense carriers (39.5%, p = 0.111). These results were confirmed by a stratified analysis where clustering was based on baseline samples only, ruling out potential confounding of these associations by profiles that emerge post-challenge. Baseline microbiota biomarkers and pneumococcal carriage. Using analysis of composition of microbiome (ANCOM), we identified OTUs present at baseline that were associated with pneumococcal carriage 3 outcome, showing baseline Corynebacterium (3) and Dolosigranulum (4) were positively associated with low-dense carriers compared to non-carriers (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). metagenomeSeq analysis confirmed this association for Corynebacterium (3; Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary  Table 6 ). Moreover, using metagenomeSeq, we detected an additional consortium of lower abundant OTUs also related to carriage 3 outcome. These OTUs were positively associated with both highdense carriers compared to low-dense and non-carriers and belonged to the families Prevotellaceae, Campylobacteraceae and Neisseriaceae, which are (facultative) anaerobes, primarily residing in the oral cavity (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 6 ). Lower abundance of these (facultative) anaerobes in lowdense carriers was also associated with a reduced microbial diversity compared to high-dense and non-carriers (Wilcoxon's rank-sum test; p = 0.01 and p = 0.03, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 8A and Corynebacterium (1) Staphylococcus epidermidis (2) Corynebacterium propinquum (3) Dolosigranulum (4) Moraxella (6) Streptococcus (7) Peptoniphilus (5) Finegoldia (8) Haemophilus (9) Fusobacterium (10) Stress = 0.25 R 2 = 3.07% P value = 0.048 Fig. 2 Baseline nasal microbiota composition in association with pneumococcal carriage 3 outcome. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plot where each point represents the microbial community composition of one sample. Samples (n = 116) were coloured according to carriage 3 outcome (red, high-dense carriers, n = 49; blue, non-carriers, n = 40 and orange, low-dense carriers, n = 27). The standard deviation of data points within carriage outcome groups is shown. In addition, the 10 highest ranked operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were simultaneously visualized (triangles). The stress value indicates how well the high-dimensional data are represented in the two-dimensional space; a value of~0.2 indicates a reasonable representation. P values and effect sizes (R 2 ) describing the strength and the significance of the association between baseline nasal microbiota and pneumococcal carriage outcome were generated using PERMANOVA tests, and are adjusted for the month, presence of any virus at baseline, the interactions between carriage outcome and the vaccination group/presence of any virus at baseline. See Table 1 Carriers only Fig. 1 Schematic overview of the study design. Volunteers were screened for pneumococcal carriage on day −4, after which they received live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) or control vaccine on day −3 (dashed arrow), followed by pneumococcal inoculation on day 0 (solid arrow) and sampling visits on days 2, 7, 9 and 29. Only participants in whom S. pneumoniae 6B was detected by conventional culture at days 2, 7, and/or 9 were visited for sampling on days 14 and 21 (grey shaded area). Red numbers mark the time points at which microbiota data were available Table 7) . Mucosal cytokines, baseline microbiota and S. pneumoniae. Mucosal cytokine data were assayed from samples collected at day 0, 2, 7, and 9 ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). We first assessed the links between baseline nasal microbiota and cytokine levels at day 0 (i.e. following LAIV vaccination), regardless of carriage 3 outcome, using both canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and distance-based redundancy analysis (dbRDA; Fig. 4 ). Intriguingly, the OTUs that were most strongly related to the first two axes of both CCA and Table 5 . The number of cluster changes was lower in low-dense carriers compared to both high-dense and non-carriers (see Tables 2 and 3) . A higher proportion of CDG profiles was observed in low-dense vs. non-carriers. Contrariwise, lowdense carriers specifically lacked STA-dominated profiles compared to both high-dense and non-carriers The association between baseline nasal microbiota composition and carriage3 outcome was adjusted for the month of sampling (i.e. seasonal effects), the presence of any virus at baseline (day −4) and the interactions between carriage3 outcome and vaccine/presence of any virus at baseline (n = 116). These interactions (indicated by a colon) were included to properly assess the associations between baseline microbiota and carriage3 outcome, the latter of which could have been impacted by viral co-infection. Analyses were performed using PERMANOVA. See Supplementary Table 3 for the detailed assessment of associations between microbiota composition and carriage2 outcome/pneumococcal density PERMANOVA permutational multivariate analysis of variance, df degrees of freedom, F F test statistic, R 2 measure of variance dbRDA were mostly oral-type species, including Streptococcus, Veillonella, Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp., and other previously identified acquisition-associated microbiota members, including Dolosigranulum (4) and Corynebacterium (3) (dbRDA). Only granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were consistently and significantly associated with baseline nasal microbiota (anova.ccafunction; p < 0.05). Cytokine levels at day 0 were significantly lower in volunteers who became low-dense carriers compared to noncarriers, although this was only significant in the LAIV but not in the control group upon stratification (GM-CSF, interferon-α (IFNα), interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-17, IL-1β, IL-2 and IL-4, within LAIV; linear model, p < 0.05, Supplementary Table 8A ). In general, volunteers who became high-dense carriers had intermediate cytokine levels at baseline. Following we combined baseline microbiota plus cytokine data to study whether the combined data improved the classification strength of carriage 3 outcome. Indeed, combining these data showed larger data separation than microbiota data alone (Fig. 4) , suggesting that both baseline microbiota composition and baseline host responses are driving pneumococcal receptiveness. Microbiata changes upon pneumococcal and LAIV challenge. We next analysed microbial community behaviour following pneumococcal challenge. We found that the overall microbiota composition following pneumococcal challenge became most profoundly different between high-dense carriers, non-carriers and lowdense carriers, at days 2 and 7 (PERMANOVA, R 2 = 4.3%, p = 0.004 at day 2 and R 2 = 4.7%, p = 0.002 at day 7), after adjustment for LAIV vaccination, the presence of virus at baseline and the interactions between carriage 3 outcome and vaccine/natural virus at baseline. Results were identical after exclusion of the OTU corresponding with S. pneumoniae from the OTU table, suggesting a broader ecological impact of pneumococcal acquisition and challenge on microbiota perturbations than colonization of a single species (pneumococcus) alone. At day 29, when pneumococcal carriage was nearly eliminated, the microbiota composition between outcome groups became similar again (R 2 = 1.8%, p = 0.505). The strength of the impact of LAIV per se or the presence of replicating influenza virus at day 0/2 on the nasal microbiota composition was highest at day 2 (R 2 = 1.7%) and diminished over time (R 2 = 1.3% at both days 7 and 29). The differences in overall microbiota composition after baseline were paralleled by differences in α-diversity, unexpectedly with an increase in microbial diversity in non-carriers compared to high-dense carriers on days 2 and 7 ( Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 7 ), suggesting ecological perturbations upon pneumococcal challenge independent of whether the strain was acquired. Microbiota dynamics following pneumococcal challenge. The previously described baseline differences in microbiota composition that were related to carriage 3 outcome translated into variation in microbiota dynamics following pneumococcal challenge (Fig. 3) . We measured microbiota profile shifts following pneumococcal challenge (i.e. at day 2) compared to baseline, and found less profile changes in low-dense carriers (11.1%), compared to high-dense carriers (28.2%, generalized linear models, p = 0.11), as well as non-carriers (31.4%, p = 0.07, Tables 2  and 3 ). In line, change in Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between baseline and day 2 was significantly larger in high-dense carriers compared to low-dense carriers (Table 3 ; p = 0.05). The large number of profile changes over the challenge interval in noncarriers underscores that pneumococcal exposure alone, without subsequent colonization or antecedent vaccination, may also perturb the ecological equilibrium. Cytokine responses following pneumococcal acquisition. Cytokine levels following LAIV and preceding pneumococcal challenge (i.e. at day 0) were lower in low-dense carriers compared to non-carriers (Supplementary Table 8A ), which translated into lower cytokine levels over the whole study period (area under the curve analyses days 0 to 9; IFN-α, IL-12, IL-17, IL-2 and IL-4; linear model, p < 0.05, within LAIV; Supplementary  Table 8B ). In addition, non-carriers had higher levels of IL-1β and IFN-α before as well as following pneumococcal challenge when compared to high-dense carriers (p < 0.1, within LAIV; Supplementary Table 8B), suggesting that pneumococcal acquisition is related to variation in and extend of LAIV-induced mucosal inflammation.
