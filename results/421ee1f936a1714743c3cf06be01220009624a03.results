For statistical homogeneity, the data of outbreak numbers should have a normal distribution. In our study, the observation cumulative density function (CDF) showed as much as 36.99% deviation from the normal CDF distribution (Figure 4(a) ). Thus, the original data were transformed using the normal scores method, which forces the original data distribution into the shape of the normal distribution (Figure 4(b) ). Following estimation, the data are back-transformed to the original value space. For structural correlation analysis of the spatiotemporal epidemic spread, we incorporated information from the empirical second statistical moment of the SARS S/TRF. Specifically, we computed the empirical spatiotemporal covariance and then fit a suitable permissible mathematical model to describe it for BME computation. Figure 5 depicts both the empirical and fitted theoretical spatiotemporal covariances characterizing the SARS S/TRF. Figure 5 shows normalized covariance values, in which darker colors correspond to higher correlation. Note that spatial correlation has some fluctuation close to zero distance. That is, covariance in space decreased rapidly and then briefly rebounded. This behavior indicates a potentially smallerscale correlation that we could not detect with our method. Correlation in the temporal axis decreases more smoothly from its maximum value to a minimum point far from the temporal origin. Given this behavior of empirical covariance, we fit the following theoretical covariance model, which has a sine hole spatial component and exponential temporal component: where is distance and sin( ) indicates a sine hole spatial component; the sill coefficient 0 is estimated at ∼1.0068; the spatial lag coefficient = 0.45 and the temporal lag coefficient = 60. Using the aforementioned covariance model, we obtained BME estimates representative of the pandemic-spread behavior. The approach above allowed for a different possible explanation for the rapid decline and recovery in spatial correlation in Figure 5 , as follows. A spatial lag coefficient = 0.45 is in good agreement with the first geographical law; that is, the numbers of outbreak events that were <0.45 degrees in longitude (∼50 km) apart had greater similarity to corresponding numbers of closer events. Inversely, there was little to no spread relationship between numbers of outbreak events >2 degrees (∼220 km) apart. However, from a different perspective, two locations >220 km apart possibly showed increased correlation because of population movement between more remote locations. The accurate fit of the exponential model to empirical temporal covariance suggests that SARS outbreak events belong in the category of traditional person-to-person epidemics. Accordingly, the specified temporal coefficient of 60 days is based primarily on the duration observed in the most severely affected cities, such as Beijing, Guangzhou, and Taiyuan. It is technically possible to limit the number of observations that are simultaneously used for BME estimation at each output grid. This is a necessary step to balance between adequate numbers of neighbors that should be used for estimation at a specific point. This is based on the assumed spatiotemporal correlation ranges on the one hand and the pragmatic need to maintain reasonable computation time for estimation, on the other. In our case study, we used up to 50 of the closest pieces of data for each estimation location. Based on the spatial lag and temporal coefficients in (9) and considerations in the previous subsection, we defined the maximum spatial and temporal ranges for neighbor search to be 15 degrees in longitude and 20 days, respectively. The parameters were set to refine calculations within reasonable estimation ranges, as follows. First, given the limited period of spread, the SARS infection presumably could not reach a location 15 degrees away within mainland China, even considering rapid population transportation by air. Then, the observed data suggest that taking the 50 pieces of data nearest an estimation point essentially considers average temporal ranges of 5 days and distances ∼10 degrees. The MSE of 0.69 indicates that the BME estimation in this case was effective and the accuracy was acceptable. Finally, we estimated the outbreaks by choosing a spatiotemporal metric parameter value of 0.3. This parameter was used to convert the space-time coordinates of any location into a common spatiotemporal distance in the continuum of SARS outbreak S/TRFs. For instance, with the above choice, the spatiotemporal distance of two outbreaks occurring at the same location 10 days apart is roughly equal to that of two simultaneous outbreaks three degrees apart. The aforementioned parameter value was based on correlation considerations and the spatiotemporal covariance in (9).
