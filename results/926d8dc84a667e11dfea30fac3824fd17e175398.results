Transient 667 mAb treatment efficiently limits viral propagation and prevents mice from developing FrCas Einduced erythroleukemia First, we created a model of chronic infection by FrCas E leading to the death of 100% of mice by erythroleukemia with clear and synchronous symptomatology. This was achieved by virus inoculation on day 8 after birth. All mice showed the first symptoms of erythroleukemia at 2 months post-infection. These were spleen swelling, due to exacerbated erythroblast proliferation, and reduction of hematocrits, resulting from combined blockade of erythropoiesis of infected erythroblasts and exhaustion of noninfected red blood cells [26] . Mice usually died between day 120-150 with very low hematocrits (36%61 versus 50%61 in control animals) and dramatically enlarged spleens (up to 18-fold increase
