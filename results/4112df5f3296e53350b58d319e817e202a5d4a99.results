Expression of IFITM1, 2, and 3 Differentially Inhibits HIV-1 Infection Despite the strong inhibition imposed by IFITMs on many enveloped viruses, the effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 has been shown to be comparatively modest (Diamond and Farzan, 2013; Perreira et al., 2013) . Notably, most previous studies are based on cellfree HIV-1 infection, in which IFITMs are expressed in target cells. Here, we exploit a highly sensitive intron-Gaussia luciferase (inGLuc) system developed by David Derse and colleagues (Mazurov et al., 2010) to assess the effect of IFITM expression in donor cells on HIV-1 single-round cell-to-cell transfer. In this system, the Gluc gene can only be expressed upon HIV-1 vector infection of target cells. We first established Jurkat cell lines stably expressing IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 using Jurkat/inGLuc (a kind gift of Walther Mothes) previously engineered to express inGLuc HIV-1 vector (Agosto et al., 2014) , and we infected these cells with wild-type (WT) HIV-1 NL43 bearing VSV-G so that the majority of donor cells would be HIV-1 infected. We then cocultured these cells with parental Jurkat cells and measured GLuc activity 24-48 hr after coculture. Expression of IFITM proteins, especially IFITM2 and IFITM3, in donor cells significantly inhibited HIV-1 NL43 transmission from Jurkat/inGLuc to parental Jurkat cells (up to 10-fold) (Figure 1A) . In contrast, IFITM expression in target Jurkat cells showed very modest effects, i.e., 5%-40% inhibition, on HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission ( Figure 1A ). Similar trends were also observed when 293T cells served as donor cells and Jurkat as target cells, although the inhibitory effect of IFITM1 in donor 293T cells was less compared to that in donor Jurkat/inGLuc cells ( Figure 1B) , possibly due to the expression of endogenous IFITMs in Jurkat cells (Lu et al., 2011) . We also measured the infectivity of HIV-1 virions produced from 293T cells in HeLa-TZM and observed that IFITM2 and IFITM3 significantly diminished the viral infectivity ( Figure 1C ). The relatively low inhibitory effect of IFITM1 on HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection was not due to different levels of IFITM expression in 293T or Jurkat cells, as determined by western blotting ( Figure 1D ). We treated the cocultured 293T-Jurkat cells with AMD3100 (a CXCR4 inhibitor), latrunculin B (LAT-B, an actin polymerization inhibitor), or VRC01 (a broadly neutralizing antibody against the CD4 binding site of Env), and we observed that each of these inhibitors markedly reduced cell-to-cell HIV-1 infection ( Figure 1E ), showing that HIV-1 transmission from 293T to Jurkat cells is CXCR4 coreceptor and HIV-1 Env dependent and requires a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. To directly visualize the effect of IFITMs on HIV-1 cell-to-cell spread, we performed live-cell imaging by transfecting 293T cells with an infectious HIV-1 clone that contains an internally inserted GFP in Gag (HIV-1 NL43 -iGFP) along with IFITM expression vectors. Once again, expression of IFITM2 and IFITM3, but not IFITM1, in 293T cells significantly inhibited HIV-1 NL43 -iGFP spread and syncytium formation from 293T to Jurkat (Figures 1F and S1A). Similar results were also obtained in HIV-1 transmission and cell-cell fusion from 293T to HeLa-TZM cells (Figure S1B) . Collectively, these data demonstrate that expression of IFITMs in donor cells strongly but differentially inhibits HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection and cell-cell fusion. These findings confirm the recent reports (Compton et al., 2014; Tartour et al., 2014) that potent IFITM restriction of HIV-1 infection requires expression in the producer cell. Knockdown of Endogenous IFITM Expression in a CD4 + T Cell Line Promotes HIV-1 Cell-to-Cell Infection CD4 + PM1 T cells express detectable levels of endogenous IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 (Lu et al., 2011) . We thus tried to knock down the IFITM expression in PM1 cells by transducing them with lentiviral small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against IFITM1, 2, or 3 and examined the effect on HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection. The expression level of IFITMs in these PM1 cells was substantially reduced by the shRNA, either in the presence or absence of interferon treatment (IFNa2b, 500 U), although cross-knockdown of different human IFITMs was observed ( Figure 2A ). These cell lines were infected with HIV-1 NL43 -iGFP bearing VSV-G for 12 hr, resulting in 97% Gag-iGFP-positive PM1 cells, which served as donor cells ( Figure S2A ). After extensive washes, the PM1 cells were cocultured with target Jurkat cells, which were pre-labeled with CMTMR (red). The cell-to-cell HIV-1 transmission efficiency was determined by calculating the GFP + populations over time in CMTMR-labeled target Jurkat cells using flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 2B , 4 hr after coculture, the HIV-1 Gag-iGFP transfer from PM1 to Jurkat cells was slightly increased for PM1 cells expressing shRNA targeting IFITMs compared to that of cells transduced with scrambled shRNA control. Notably, the enhancement became apparent at 8 hr in PM1 cells expressing shRNA against IFITM2 (23.8%) and IFITM3 (32.8%) relative to the scrambled shRNA control (13.8%) ( Figure 2B ). Azidothymidine (AZT) treatment of cocultured cells at 8 hr did decrease HIV-1 transmission in IFITM-knockdown PM1 cells compared to untreated cells ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that knockdown of IFITMs can enhance productive HIV-1 infection following cell-to-cell infection (i.e., newly synthesized Gag-iGFP). The cell-free HIV-1 NL43 infection of the mixed PM-1/ Jurkat cell population (without spinoculation) was low (1.6%), regardless of shRNA IFITM expression. We subsequently confirmed the effects of IFITMs knockdown, especially IFITM3, in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which served as donor cells for HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection . We cannot exclude the possibility that the smaller effect of IFITM1 and 2 knockdown on viral transmission could be due to their relatively low knockdown efficiency in PBMCs. Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that knockdown of endogenous IFITM expression enhances HIV-1 transmission in CD4 + T cells. (E) Effect of AMD3100 (4 mg/m), LAT-B (1 mg/ml), and VRC01 (5 mg/ml) on HIV-1 transfer from 293T to Jurkat cells. All reagents were added immediately upon coculturing and maintained throughout the entire assay. (F) Quantification of HIV-1 transmission/fusion from 293T to Jurkat/tdTomato cells using live-cell imaging. HEK293T cells were transfected with HIV-1 NL43 Gag-iGFP and cocultured with Jurkat/ tdTomato cells for 20-24 hr. The numbers of GFPand tdTomato-double-positive cells were scored and plotted relative to that of empty vector pQCXIP control. For all figures applicable, the values are means and SDs of three to five independent experiments. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. See also Figure S1 . IFITM Proteins Interact with HIV-1 Env in Viral Producer Cells and Impair Env Processing and Incorporation into Virions One possible mechanism by which IFITM expression in donor cells could inhibit HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection and infectivity is through association with HIV-1 Env. As the first step to test this possibility, we performed western blotting to examine HIV-1 Env expression and processing in 293T cells transiently transfected with HIV-1 NL43 in the presence or absence of IFITMs. We found that the ratio of gp120 or gp41 to gp160 in IFITM-expressing cells, especially that of IFITM2 and IFITM3, was considerably decreased compared to that observed in cells transfected with the pQCXIP vector control ( Figures 3A and 3C ). These results suggest that HIV-1 Env processing is impaired by IFITMs. We then carried out immunoprecipitation (IP) of the cell lysates (containing 1% NP-40 and 0.1% SDS) with anti-FLAG and observed that IFITM proteins, especially those expressing IFITM2 and IFITM3, readily pulled down HIV-1 Env, especially gp41 ( Figure 3B , top and middle panels). IFITM1 was also found to interact with HIV-1 Env, but with much reduced efficiency ( Figure 3B ). Importantly, we did not detect HIV-1 Gag in immunoprecipitated cell lysates (data not shown), implying that the observed interaction is HIV-1 Env specific. The interaction between endogenous IFITM proteins and HIV-1 Env was also observed in PM1 cells ( Figure 3D ), although knockdown of individual IFITMs in PM1 cells only modestly increased HIV-1 Env processing ( Figures  S2B-S2D) . Overall, these results demonstrated that IFITM proteins, especially IFITM2 and IFITM3, specifically interact with HIV-1 Env in viral producer cells, resulting in impaired Env processing. IFITM incorporation into HIV-1 virions has been recently reported to be responsible for impaired viral infectivity (Compton et al., 2014; Tartour et al., 2014) . Hence, we compared the incorporation efficiencies of IFITM1, IFITM2, and IFITM3 into HIV-1 virions and examined their possible correlations between incorporation efficiency and inhibitions of cell-to-cell infection. Surprisingly, we found that all three IFITMs were abundantly present in culture media, likely as exosomes, even in cells not expressing HIV-1 ( Figure 3E , right three lanes). To deter-mine if IFITMs are specifically incorporated into HIV-1 virions, we adopted an approach that we recently used to evaluate TIM-family protein incorporation (Li et al., 2014) . We first immunoprecipitated purified HIV-1 virions using HIV-1 immunoglobulin (HIV-Ig, pooled HIV patient sera), and we then performed western blotting using anti-FLAG to detect IFITMs. We observed that all IFITMs were detected in the pulled down HIV-1 virions, consistent with reports of Compton and Tartout et al. (Compton et al., 2014; Tartour et al., 2014) . However, IFITM1 was more abundantly incorporated into HIV-1 virions compared to IFITM2 and 3 ( Figure 3F , top panel), which is not in accordance with their inhibition of cell-to-cell infection and diminished infectivity ( Figure 1 ); this was despite the equivalent input of IFITMs ( Figure 3G ), as well as almost equivalent virion pull-down efficiency by HIV-Ig ( Figure 3F , bottom panel). Notably, the signals of gp120 in the purified virions, either (A) Examination of IFITM protein expression in PM1 cells stably expressing shRNA IFITM1, 2, and 3. Cells were treated with or without 500 U IFNa2b for 18-24 hr, and lysates were subjected to western blotting using anti-IFITM1, anti-IFITM2, or anti-IFITM3 antibodies. Cross-knockdown and antibody cross-reactions among IFITM1, 2, and 3 are noticed. GAPDH serves as loading control due to weak signals for b-actin in PM-1 cells. (B) Summary of flow cytometric analysis of HIV-1 Gag-GFP transfer from PM1 to Jurkat cells. PM-1 cells stably expressing shRNA IFITM1, 2, or 3 or scramble control were infected with NL43-Gag-iGFP; cells were cocutured for 4-8 hr with Jurkat cells that were prelabeled with CMTMR. Cells were gated for GFP (Green) and CMTMR (Red) by flow cytometry (see Figure S2 ). For 8 hr coculture, cells were also treated with AZT to ensure that productive HIV-1 replication had occurred. Data were from four independent experiments. All values shown are normalized against shRNA control either at 4 or 8 hr after coculture, *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01. (C-E) Knockdown of IFITM expression in PBMCs enhances HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection. Activated PBMCs were treated with 500 U IFNa2b and infected with VSV-G lentiviral pseudotypes encoding shRNA IFITM1, 2, or 3 for 48 hr. The knockdown efficiency was examined by intracellular staining using pooled antibodies against IFITM1, 2, and 3 (1:1:1) by flow cytometry shown in (C). Note that shRNA against IFITM1 knocks down both IFITM1 and IFITM3, shRNA against IFITM2 only knocks down IFITM2, and shRNA against IFITM3 knocks down all three IFITMs. Next, the cells were infected with HIV-1 NL43 -iGFP bearing VSV-G, which served as donor cells, and cocultured with target Jurkat cells stably expressing tdTomato (Jurkat/tdTomato). The cell-to-cell infection efficiency was determined by measuring GFP + Jurkat cells 48 hr after coculture using flow cytometry (D) and summarized in (E). *p < 0.05. Results are from four independent experiments performed in duplicates. See also Figure S2 . before (referred to as ''virion input'') or after immunoprecipitation with HIV-Ig (referred to as ''IP: HIV-Ig''), were substantially reduced by IFITM expression, especially IFITM2 and 3 ( Figures  3F and 3G) , consistent with the lower levels of gp120 in the cells. We also observed that gp160 in IFITM2 and IFITM3-containing HIV-1 virion input was significantly increased ( Figure 3G , middle panel), which likely represents immature Env in microvesicles and/or exosomes, whose release might be promoted by IFITM2 and 3. Together, our data support the conclusion that IFITMs are abundantly present in the media of normally cultured cells, even without HIV-1, which is consistent with a recent study (Zhu et al., 2015) , and that IFITM incorporation into HIV-1 virions, although detected, does not strictly correlate with the phenotype of IFITM inhibition of HIV-1 cell-to-cell infection. IFITM3 Protein Promotes HIV-1 gp120 Shedding Next, we explored the possibility that IFITM proteins, in particular IFITM3, may trigger gp120 (SU) shedding in viral producer cells, which could partly explain or contribute to the reduced levels of gp120/gp41expression in the cell and viral particles as well as impaired viral infectivity. Our previous work has already demonstrated that IFITM3 does not significantly inhibit HIV-1 production (Lu et al., 2011) . We performed pulse-chase labeling experiments using 293T cells transiently transfected with HIV-1 NL43 , in the presence or absence of IFITM3, and then measured gp120 shedding into culture media by immunoprecipitation using HIV-Ig. While the expression of gp160 decreased in a time-dependent manner, as would be expected, the level of gp160 in IFITM3-expressing cells suffered a more rapid decrease compared to cells expressing HIV-1 NL43 alone ( Figures 4A and 4B ). In contrast, HIV-1 Gag (Pr55) expression in both cell groups exhibited similar rates of decline, regardless of IFITM3 expression or not ( Figures 4A and 4C) . Notably, we consistently observed an enhanced SU shedding in IFITM3-expressing cells compared to cells expressing HIV-1 NL43 alone, especially at 2, 4, and 6 hr of the chase labeling time ( Figures  4A and 4D) . Overall, the pulse-chase labeling data indicate that IFITM expression in viral producer cells likely increases gp160 turnover and promotes gp120 shedding into culture media.
