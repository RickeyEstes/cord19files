To ensure interrater agreement, each grader scored four of the other grader's trials in a masked fashion, and we calculated a κ statistic (κ = 0.98). The dependent variable-amount of spatter-was normally distributed for the groups formed by the combination of tooth number and isolation method, as assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test (P > .05). The results showed homogeneity of variance between groups, as assessed by Levene's test for equality of error variances (P = .273). Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics including mean (standard deviation) number of contaminated squares. The two-way ANOVA showed statistically significant differences in the amount of spatter produced between the control, dental dam and Isolite groups (F 2,63 = 46.267, P < .001), in the amount of spatter produced between teeth nos. 18, 19 and 20 (F 2,63 = 6.343, P = .003) and in the interaction between the isolation method and the tooth number (F 4,63 = 8.230, P < .001). Overall, use of both the Isolite system and dental dam with HVE decreased spatter significantly compared with the control technique. In addition, the results showed no statistically significant differences between the two isolation methods. Pairwise comparisons demonstrate the performance of each treatment method, according to tooth number ( Table 2 ). For tooth no. 18, both the dental dam and Isolite device reduced spatter by a statistically significant amount compared with results for the control technique (that is, no isolation), and there was no statistically significant difference between the two isolation methods. For tooth no. 19, the reduction in spatter with the use of the dental dam was significant, whereas use of the Isolite device did not result in a significant reduction in spatter (P = .056). Yet, there was no significant difference between the dental dam and the Isolite device for tooth no. 19. Finally, for tooth no. 20, the reduction in spatter was statistically significant with both the dental dam and the Isolite device. However, the reduction in spatter with the dental dam was significantly greater than that with the Isolite device (P = .001).
