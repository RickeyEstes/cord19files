During the study period, 120 subjects out of 158 ED personnel in total were recruited. Five subjects were unwilling to respond to the questionnaire. The characteristics of the remaining 115 participants are outlined in Table 1 . The average age of study participants was 30.5 years, and 67.0% were women. Sixty-nine percent of participants were nurses, and 57% had graduated from college. Annual incomes of 41% of the participants were equal to or more than US $28,604. Among the 115 subjects who responded to the WTP question, a strong negative association was seen between the log of the dollar bid presented and the subject's WTP for a vaccine that could avert their development of nosocomial SARS infection ( Table 2 ). The odds ratio (OR) for WTP associated with a 10 fold increase in the bid presented to the study subject was 0.20. This suggests that in this sample, the odds of a person willing to pay for a vaccine costing US $100 would be 0.20 times the odds of WTP for a US $10 vaccine. A fitted logistic curve of the expected proportion of subjects willing to pay for a vaccine over a range of costs is presented in Fig 1. The projected median amount subjects would be willing to pay was US $1762. Thus, presented with a vaccine costing US $1762, half the study subjects would have been expected to agree to purchase it. The mean amount our study subjects would be willing to pay was US $720. A multivariable logistic regression model was created to adjust for potential confounding of WTP by subject-related covariates. In this multivariate model, we found the price of the vaccine and the type of jobs were significantly related to the WTP responses. The WTP responses were not significantly related to age, gender, perceived risk, education level, or income level. Increased amount of WTP was found in resident physicians as compared with nurses (OR, 12.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.54-94.48). When adjusted for this confounding variable, the median amount subjects were willing to pay was US $2729, US $3922, and US $1333 in staff physicians, resident physicians, and nurses, respectively.
