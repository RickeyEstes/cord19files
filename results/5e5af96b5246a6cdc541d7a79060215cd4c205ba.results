During the study period, 2996 clinical respiratory specimens were analysed, with a total of 32 387 real-time PCRs or RT-PCRs performed. Upper respiratory samples predominated, representing 82.4% of all cases (2469); 17.6% (527) were lower respiratory samples. Among the 527 lower respiratory samples, 451 (85.6%) were collected via BAL. The overall positivity rate (PR) for any respiratory virus was 43.2%, while for upper and lower respiratory samples it was 47.4% and 23.7%, respectively (Fig. 1 ). Most (89%) nasopha-ryngeal aspirates were collected from paediatric patients, whereas most (87.9%) nasopharyngeal swabs were drawn from adult and elderly patients. For coronaviruses, 328 upper and 72 lower respiratory samples were analysed. The proportion of specimens from male patients ranged from 47.4 to 64.7% depending on the population. The distribution of samples and the positivity rate according to age group are shown in Table 1 . Median ages were 2 years (range 0-18 years), 41.5 years (range 18-65 years) and 84.5 years (65-103 years) for paediatric, adult and elderly populations, respectively. Lower respiratory samples were collected from both genders fairly equally among adult patients (47.4% male) but primarily from male patients among the elderly (63%). Overall, lower respiratory samples were collected chiefly from adults (51.2%), with only 26.2% and 22.6% from paediatric and elderly patients, respectively. Upper respiratory samples were somewhat more evenly distributed, with 26.1%, 36.6% and 37.3% from paediatric, adult and elderly populations, respectively. The highest positivity rate (78.6%) was found in upper respiratory samples collected from paediatric patients, the lowest (20.4%) in lower respiratory samples from adult patients. Paediatric patients had a significantly higher positivity rate (p <0.001). Of 527 lower respiratory samples, 69 (13.1%) had a paired upper respiratory sample analysed during the same episode. Among these, 20 (29%) were both positive, 39 (56.5%) were both negative, and ten (14.5%) had discordant results. Fig. 2 describes the respective prevalence of different types of viruses. Picornaviruses were detected with the greatest frequency in all specimens and populations except upper respiratory samples collected from the elderly; in these, influenza viruses predominated. Indeed, across all specimens, influenza virus prevalence increased with patients' age. Parainfluenza viruses were the second most frequently found viruses in lower respiratory samples of the elderly population, whereas overall, adenoviruses were very infrequent in the non-paediatric population. Among children, adenoviruses and RSV were the second and third most frequent viruses, both for upper and lower respiratory samples. In contrast, coronaviruses were rarely found in children, but were detected in 9-16% of combined specimens in adults and the elderly. Multiple viral infections, defined as the simultaneous detection of more than one virus in one clinical specimen, were apparent in 141 (12%) and 14 Among upper respiratory samples from children, the most frequent co-infections were picornaviruses with adenoviruses (22 cases, 15.4%) and adenoviruses with RSV (ten cases, 7%). The former was also the most frequent co-infection detected among lower respiratory samples. Details of MVI are shown in Table 2 . The number of screened specimens increased in winter periods but the positivity rate, although also slightly higher in winter months, remained relatively stable (Fig. 3a) . The highest positivity rate was obtained in February 2012 (76.5%) and the lowest in August 2012 (25.4%). Regarding the distribution of respiratory viruses over the year, nfluenza virus, RSV, human metapneumovirus and coronaviruses showed a clear seasonal pattern, with a marked increase in PR throughout the winter months, while picornavirus and adenovirus prevalence remained relatively stable over the year, with a decrease in the PR during winter months. Seasonal prevalence patterns are depicted in Fig. 3b . For multiple infections, the cases with simultaneous detection of picornaviruses and adenoviruses were found throughout the year, whereas those involving influenza viruses and coronaviruses were more frequent in winter.
