We first evaluated baseline villus height within segments of intestine excised at the time of SBR in mice housed in both clean and dirty rooms. Baseline villus height in unoperated mice was found to be significantly taller when measured in the ileum of mice housed in the dirty room ( Fig. 1A and B ). As such, we removed a small (less than 3 mm) segment of intestine from sham-operated mice at the time of sham operation and compared this intraoperative segment with the villus height at the time of harvest 3 days later. Similarly, we measured baseline villus heights within the ileum removed from the SBR animals and compared this with the villus heights of the adapted bowel at the time of sacrifice. As revealed in Fig. 2 , sham operation was associated with a slight (albeit statistically significant) degree of villus growth. As expected, the magnitude of villus growth was greatest in the animals subjected to SBR. These data underscore the importance of comparing villus height differences between SBR and sham groups, thereby, controlling for the contribution of sham operation-induced villus growth. On the other hand, because measurements of protein expression are best done in individual animals, recording the baseline villus height within the intraoperative segment and comparing this with measurements at the time The effects of housing type (clean vs dirty), operative procedure (sham vs SBR), and diet (liquid vs Jevity) on survival are depicted in Table 1 . Linear regression modeling was performed using these 3 variable groups individually, as well as their interaction variables. There was no significant effect of diet; however, the influence of housing environment and operative procedure were significant at a P value of less than .003 and less than .001, respectively. The calculated R 2 was 0.27, indicating that these 2 factors alone accounted for roughly 27% of the observed change. Overall survival appeared to be optimal when mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions and fed the standard liquid rodent diet. Furthermore and consistent with the survival data, mice fed liquid diet and housed in the clean rooms yielded a significantly greater adaptation response to SBR when compared with mice in other groups. When compared with baseline villus height measurements at the time of operation, SBR was associated with a 48% increase in the clean room, liquid diet group and a 39% increase in the clean room, Jevity group. On the other hand, the mice housed in the dirty room demonstrated a 26% and 20% increase in villus height after SBR when fed Jevity or liquid diet, respectively. Taking into account the average villus height increase of 48% in the clean room-housed mice fed liquid diet and subjected to SBR with the SD of 16.8%, we calculated that normal adaptation (expected % change Â± 1 SD) was in the range of 31% to 65% villus growth. A super adaptation response was heralded by villus growth of greater than 65% from baseline. Finally, mice with less than 31% villus growth after SBR were considered to have not adapted. Using these newly defined parameters, roughly 60% of mice demonstrated normal adaptation, whereas 20% had minimal adaptation, and 20% had a magnified adaptation response. Based on these values and the ability to use SBR mice as their own control using baseline villus heights obtained in the resected bowel, it was determined that for future experiments, a minimum sample size of 4 would be necessary, with significance set at P b .05. We sought to determine a relationship between the histologic findings and relevant gene expression profiles in our SBR model. The small intestine crypts are a highly dynamic region of the intestinal mucosa and our laboratory has previously established important Rb phosphorylation regulation within prototypical intestinal crypt epithelial cells by epidermal growth factor [4] . The Rb protein plays a central role in regulating cell proliferation. When Rb is in its hypophosphorylated state, cells are maintained in quiescence. Alternatively, Rb hyperphosphorylation has been established as a critical step in the initiation of cell cycle progression. Using immunohistochemistry, we have previously found that Rb phosphorylated at S807/811 and T826 is specifically seen in crypt enterocytes. To specifically look at the proliferation signal changes in the crypts, we developed a new method to isolate crypt and villus enterocytes. The validation of the method was confirmed by Western blot showing the proliferation marker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in crypts and villus marker PTK6 in villi (Fig. 3A) . This new method allows us to correlate biochemical Rb signals with histologic crypt changes. Indeed, Rb phosphorylation at S807/811 and T826 shows increase only in histologically deeper SBR crypts when compared to sham crypts (Fig. 3B) . These results were verified by immunostaining in tissue sections (Fig. 4) . Total Rb expression tended to decrease in adapting tissue. Furthermore, the proliferation marker PCNA was increased, whereas cyclin D1 expression does not change in adapting crypts. The mechanism for all these changes is being subjected to further investigation.
