Of the 60 sampled health facilities in Ebola-unaff ected prefectures, two health facilities (3%), both of which were health posts, were permanently closed (table 1) because there were no health-care staff , for reasons unrelated to the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic. Of the 60 sampled health facilities in the Ebola-aff ected prefectures, fi ve health facilities (8%) were closed, including one hospital, one health centre, and three health posts. All closures were related to the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic, with reasons ranging from deaths of medical staff from Ebola virus disease to community resistance (appendix (table 3) . The rate of presumptive treatment of fever cases stayed the same in Ebola-unaff ected prefectures, but decreased from 32% to 23% in Ebola-aff ected areas (table 3) . Overall, the proportion of cases of fever treated with antimalarial drugs at health facilities was not substantially diff erent between 2013 and 2014 in Ebolaunaff ected prefectures, but decreased from 62% in 2013 to 54% in 2014 in Ebola-aff ected prefectures (table 3) . In Ebola-unaff ected prefectures, 42 (69%) of 61 healthcare workers reported decreases in attendance at health facilities compared with 59 (97%) of 61 in Ebola-aff ected areas. The most common explanations provided by health-care workers and community health workers for the decreases were patients' fears of health-care workers Community health workers also reported changes in practices in malaria case management. Although the proportion of community health workers in Ebolaunaff ected prefectures who reported being active increased from 78% before the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic to 95% since the start of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic, this trend was reversed in aff ected prefectures, falling from 98% to 74% (table 4) . Among active community health workers, the proportion doing malaria case management increased from 63% to 96% in Ebolaunaff ected prefectures, but fell from 68% to 48% in Ebolaaff ected prefectures ( up from 60% since before the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic, only 30% of operational community health workers reported using rapid diagnostic tests in Ebolaaff ected prefectures, down from 70% before the Ebolavirus-disease epidemic (table 4) . This drop in the use of rapid diagnostic tests was not outweighed by a corresponding increase in reported presumptive treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy, at 9% before the start of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic and 11% afterwards (table 4) . Nationwide, although the weekly total number of suspect malaria cases was lower in 2014 than in previous years at the start of the year, there was a typical peak during June and July, 2014 (fi gure 2). However, there was a rapid fall in the number of reported cases, starting near the end of August, mirroring the results from the health facility survey. In 2014, before the third wave of the epidemic, weekly suspect malaria cases in less-aff ected prefectures were not signifi cantly diff erent from expected, but were 22% (95% CI 22-23) lower than expected in prefectures highly aff ected by the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic. Since the start of the third wave of the epidemic in August, 2014, weekly malaria cases were 8% (6-9) lower than expected in unaff ected prefectures, 14% (11-15) lower than expected in less aff ected prefectures, and 42% (40-43) lower than expected in highly aff ected prefectures. For all of Guinea for 2014, the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic is estimated to have resulted in a reduction of 74 000 suspect malaria cases (95% CI 71 000-77 000) seen Incorrect treatment (negative test) 14% (7-24) 5% ( at public health facilities as reported through the weekly surveillance system.
