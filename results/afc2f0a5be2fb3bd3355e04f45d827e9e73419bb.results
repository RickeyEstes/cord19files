Eight (28.5%) of the 28 aerosol samples tested positive for adenovirus and one (3.5%) tested positive for influenza A virus. Aerosol samples with real-time RT-PCR/PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values <40 were considered positive. All eight adenovirus-positive samples were retrieved from the NIOSH samplers, 3 (37.5%) of which were from particles >4μm in aerodynamic diameter, and 5 (62.5%) from particles ≤4μm in aerodynamic diameter. The captured influenza A virus-positive particles were retrieved from a mobile SKC filter cassette and were therefore ≥0.3μm. None of the aerosol samples tested positive for influenza B or D virus, enterovirus or coronavirus. Attempts to grow viruses in cell culture from positive aerosol samples were unsuccessful.
