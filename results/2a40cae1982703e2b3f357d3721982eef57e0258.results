In the first group, there were 22 males and eight females with a mean age of 29 years (range: 18 to 34 years) whereas in control group there were 23 males and seven females with an average age being 28.5 years (range: 20 to 35 years). The variables were compared in each group at the time of admission and further during follow-up. Age, sex, pre-hospital stabilization of fractures with splints, time since the injury on arrival in the hospital, and vital parameters were statistically insignificant between both groups. There was no significant association between the partial pressure of oxygen, hemoglobin, haematocrit, or biochemical parameters at the time of admission and the subsequent development of FES in both the groups. There were six patients with subclinical FES in each group. Although there were eight cases of clinical FES in the control group and three cases in ciclesonide prophylaxis group, it was statistically insignificant. Thus, the development of FES was not affected by the ciclesonide prophylaxis. Mean values of the arterial blood partial pressure of oxygen are shown in Table 1 .
