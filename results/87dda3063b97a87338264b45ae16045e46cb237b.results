CHIKV resolution is associated with differential cytokine programs of increasing and decreasing trends CHIKV causes a disease of crippling joint pain that has affected most of Asia and has demonstrated the capability to spread to nontropical areas such as Europe and parts of North America [1] . Cytokines are inflammatory mediators and their balance is often associated with inflammatory disease [23] . Previously, the cytokine profiles of acute phase CHIKV patients have been examined [22] . Here we profiled cytokine levels in acute phase and 6-and 12month follow-up CHIKV patient serum samples to determine a cytokine signature that may correlate with acute symptoms, following persistent joint pain and/or disease resolution. Blood samples were collected from 50 patients suffering from CHIKV infections during the 2007 Italian outbreak. Serum separated from whole blood was analyzed by cytokine bead analysis (CBA) for 13 cytokines with the intention of determining a cytokine profile during CHIKV acute phase and disease convalescence. Three cytokine profiles emerged from our data: decreasing, increasing and no-trend. The first trend showed cytokine levels significantly higher in the acute samples compared to the follow-up time points revealing a decreasing pattern as patients left the acute phase. CXCL9/MIG (CXCL9), IL-6, CCL2/MCP-1(CXCL2) and CXCL10/IP-10 (CXCL10) cytokines had significantly decreased at both 6-month and 12-month follow-ups ( Figure 1) . Interestingly, some patients had extremely high levels in the acute phase; CXCL9 and CXCL10 levels decreased 1000 fold to 10,000 fold during convalescence. Furthermore, the decreasing trends for IL-6, CXCL9, and CXCL10 reached similar levels as those of the community control levels (shown by dotted line). CCL2 levels decreased significantly lower than the control levels by 12 months. Taken together, this data demonstrated that CXCL9, IL-6, CCL2 and CXCL10 were initially increased with acute CHIKV infection and decreased over time. The second cytokine trend that emerged described cytokines that significantly increased following the acute phase. Cytokine profiles that were markedly lower in the acute phase and subsequently increased included IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-12, IL-5, IL-10 and IFN-c ( Figure 2 ). The cytokine increase was more gradual than the previous decreasing trend, where fold changes were generally closer to 2. Both the 6-and 12-month follow-up were statistically increased compared to acute values for IL-5 levels. IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-12, IL-10 and IFN-c had significantly increased by 12 months. Even though the average for these cytokines had also risen by 6 months it was not significant. Furthermore, the increasing trends for TNF-a, IL-5, and IL-10 reached similar levels to the community control levels (shown by dotted line) and IFN-c reached significantly higher than controls at 12 months. Interestingly, although IL-1b and IL-12 increased through the observed time, these cytokines stayed significantly lower than those of the controls. This data showed that cytokines IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-12, IL-5, IL-10 and IFN-c increased in the convalescence phase of CHIKV infection. No significant change was seen for IL-2, IL-4, and IL-8 from the acute phase to the 12-month follow-up ( Figure 3 ). Interestingly, IL-2 reached similar levels to those of the controls where IL-8 and IL-4 remained significantly raised and lowered, respectively. Figure 4) . The median of CXCL10 in the viral stage was approximately 7000 pg/ml and dropped to less than 1000 pg/ml after seroconversion. Interestingly, the IL-10 median decreased by 3 fold from the viral stage to the seroconversion stage. Next we sought to determine if the high levels of IgG in the follow-up phases were also significantly associated with cytokine levels compared to the cytokine levels of patients with low levels of IgG. The patients were put into an IgG high group (H) or an IgG low group (L) and the levels of each cytokine were statistically compared for each group using the Mann-Whitney U Test. In the 6-month follow-up phase CXCL9, CXCL10 and Il-6 were found to be statistically different between the high IgG group and the low IgG group ( Figure 5A ). High levels of all 3 cytokines were associated with high levels of IgG antibodies. IL-10 is also shown for comparison since it was statistically significant during the acute phase breakdown and the 12-month follow-up. Interestingly, in the 12-month follow-up phase, CXCL9 was found to be statistically higher in the IgG high group where IL-10 was significantly lower in the high IgG group ( Figure 5B ). CXCL10 is shown for comparison at 12 months although it was not significantly different between the IgG high and IgG low groups. In summary, the results suggested that CXCL9, CXCL10 and Il-6 were associated with IgG levels in the 6-month follow-up phase and CXCL9 and IL-10 in the 12month follow-up phase. Inflammatory Cytokines Resolve Chikungunya Disease www.plosntds.org CXCL10, CXCL9 and IgG levels are possible biomarkers of CHIKV disease severity IL-1b, IL-6 and RANTES were found to be associated with symptom severity of the Singapore 2007 CHIKV outbreak [22] . After determining the cytokine profiles of our Italian 2007 CHIKV patients during their disease resolution, we next sought to determine the association between symptom severity and cytokine levels. Patients were determined to be non-symptomatic (N), to have mild symptoms (M) or to have severe symptoms (S) depending on their responses to a questionnaire. The cytokine levels were then grouped by symptom level and a Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine significance among the severity groups for each cytokine. CXCL10 and CXCL9 were found to be significantly increased in the patients with mild and severe symptoms at 6 months following initial infection compared to the patients reporting no symptoms ( Figure 6A) . A 2 fold difference was seen between the medians of the non-symptomatic and severe patients for CXCL10 and a 5 fold difference for CXCL9. No statistical difference was seen for any of the 13 cytokines profiled for the 12-month follow-up. CXCL10 and CXCL9 at 12 months are shown for comparison ( Figure 6B ). Moreover, we analyzed the IgG levels at the 6-month follow-up in patients with no symptoms, mild symptoms, and severe symptoms. The results showed IgG levels were statistically increased with Figure 1 . Acute phase CHIKV disease was associated with high levels of IL-6, CXCL9, CCL2, CXCL10. Cytokine Bead Array analysis of CHIKV patient serum samples showed high levels of IL-6, CXCL9, CCL2 and CXCL-10 are associated with acute disease phase and decreased with patient convalescence. Six-month and one-year cytokine levels were analysed for statistical significance using the Wilcoxon test for Significance by comparing with acute levels. All samples were also analyzed for significance against healthy controls by the Mann-Whitney U test. The cross symbol indicates a p-value less than 0.05 for 6-and 12-month groups compared to acute values and star symbol indicates a p-value less than 0.05 for acute, 6-and 12-month groups compared to control values. The dotted line indicates the median of healthy control cytokine levels. Acute (A), 6-month follow-up (6), and 12-month follow-up (12 Figure 6C ). Taken together, these results suggested CXCL10, CXCL9 and IgG to be possible markers of CHIKV severity during early phases of disease resolution.
