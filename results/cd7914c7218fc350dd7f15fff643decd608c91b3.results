The characteristics and clinical findings of each patient are shown in Table 1 . Two patient had mild dyspnea, and two patients presented with moderate cough at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum. The remaining nine patients had no respiratory symptom. None of the patients had been intubated or biopsied close to the time of detection of pneumomediastinum. The mean observation period or CT interval between before and at the detection of pneumomediastinum was 79.6 days (50.5 days in group 1 and, 104.6 days in group 2). The presence and predominant location of each CT finding are summarized in Table 2 . At the time of detection of pneumomediastinum, CT scans revealed reticular opacity in 13 patients, groundglass opacity in 13 patients, consolidation in 11 patients, and honeycombing in 11 patients. Reticular opacity predominated in the lower lung zone in 6 patients but was evenly distributed in all zones of 7 patients, and at the lung periphery in 8 patients. Ground-glass opacity predominated in the lower lung zone in 8 patients, and at the lung periphery in 7 patients. Consolidation predominated in the lower lung zone in 7 patients, and at the lung periphery in 6 patients. Honeycombing predominated in the lower lung zone and at the lung periphery in all patients. The mean score for all patients for reticular opacity was 10.174.9 before pneumomediastinum and 12.176.1 at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum. For all patients, no significant differences were seen in scores before and at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum (P ¼ 0:22). In group 1, no significant difference was found in scores before and at the time of pneumomediastinum (10.573.4 vs. 8.573.4, respectively; P ¼ 0:17). However, in group 2, the mean score for reticular opacity was significantly lower before pneumomediastinum compared with at the time of For all patients, no significant differences were seen in scores before and at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum (P ¼ 0:51). However, when patients were divided into groups, significant differences were seen before and at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum. In group 1, the mean score for groundglass opacity was significantly higher before detection of pneumomediastinum than at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum (23.279.8 vs. 10 .074.8, respectively; P ¼ 0:028) (Fig. 1) . In contrast, in group 2, the mean score for groundglass opacity was significantly lower before pneumomediastinum compared with at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum (7.8710.0 vs. 14.1711.1, respectively; P ¼ 0:018).
