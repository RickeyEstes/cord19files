African wild dogs and domestic dogs sampled in the Okavango Delta in Botswana showed evidence of exposure to all canine pathogens tested (Fig. 2) . In Etosha National Park, Black-back jackals were serologically positive for CDV (1992-1993, 53%, n = 15) as were spotted hyena (1992) (1993) 1996 , 24%, n = 25). There was no evidence of exposure to CCV or Felv (n = 12) among spotted hyena although the sample size was small. Lions were seropositive for CDV in all locations sampled with the exception of Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa and Tsumkwe, Namibia (Fig. 3) . Only study sites in South Africa and Botswana were tested for antibodies to FPV and evidence of exposure was identified in both countries with the exception of lions from the Okavango Delta and Makgadikgadi National Park (MNP). High levels of exposure to FHV-1 were found in all sites tested. FCOV and FCV were common among lions with the exception of MNP. Evidence of infection with Feline lentiviruses or antigenically related lentiviruses was widespread in all tested feline populations with the exception of Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa and Etosha National Park in Namibia. FeLV infection was not detected among any tested animals in the four countries. In this study, animals were antibody positive for domestic carnivore pathogens even in remote parts of protected areas extremely distant from populations of domestic animals (e.g. CDV, Fig. 4 ).
