The massively parallel sequencing of the pooled and normalized cDNA library generated 1'130'000 reads, corresponding to approximately 300 Mbp. These reads were assembled using iAssembler and subjected to annotation analysis using megablast as well as normal blast algorithms against the Refseq RNA, RefSeq Protein, Refseq Human RNA and Refseq Human Protein databases. Using Megablast, 51076 contigs showed alignment to proteins or RNA sequences in the Refseq RNA or protein databases. These corresponded to 24972 individual accessions numbers in the RefSeq RNA or protein database. When blasted against the human genes or proteins, 20767 contigs were aligning 9795 individual human orthologs (using an e norm value cut off of .0.8). These orthologs were used for subsequent analysis to identify overrepresented biological clusters. As the cDNA library was constructed using several tissues, the fact that the most overrepresented biological functions describe general cellular functions, such as cellular process (GO:0009987), metabolic process (GO:0008125) and gene expression (GO:0010467) was not surprising. As we infected the animals prior to the harvest of the tissues, we expected an enrichment of genes known to be induced during different stages of early infection in this data set when compared to the data previously generated. Using the Gene Ontology database, we found that 741 (53%) of the ferret gene orthologs overlapped with genes within the most ancestral GOterm representing the immune system process (GO:002376). Similar comparisons using the EST data set we have reported previously, indicated that 421 ferret orthologs were overlapping with the genes in GO:0002376. The approach using a normalized cDNA library from a pool of tissues from infected animals as well as LPS induced ferret splenocytes thus proved to be a valid way to identify ferret gene orthologs involved in the immune response. To maximize the de-novo identification of ferret gene orthologs, and increase the read lengths of the contigs, we made an assembly with the ESTs generated in this study and those we have previously have reported [8] . Subsequent blast alignment generated 58'891 contigs with hits to proteins or RNA sequences when blasted against the Refseq RNA and RefSeq Protein databases (corresponding to 32'496 different proteins/transcripts). As the Refseq RNA and Protein databases contain all known orthologs of genes, counting the only the number of individual hits to the entries in these databases may lead to an overestimation of the number of actual genes identified. This is exemplified by contigs aligned to different orthologs of the aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase gene (AASDH), where some contigs show the highest overlap to the AASDH gene from giant panda, whereas other contigs are more similar to the dog ortholog. To improve the estimate of the number of genes identified, we extracted the gene symbol from the annotations and counted the number of individual gene symbols rather than the accession number from the RefSeq blast hit. This resulted in 19'342 partially sequenced genes (Tables S1 and S2). A large number of these genes were represented by two or more non overlapping contigs, which may be indicative of different splice variants (Fig. 1) . Five thousand thirty nine of the 19'342 transcripts were aligned to genes staring with LOC followed by the geneID. For such transcripts, no published gene symbol is available nor has an ortholog been determined yet. Gene annotation processes are continuing at the NCBI, and the actual number of individual genes identified in this data set may be altered. Investigating the best hit for each contig from the Refseq protein blast analysis showed that most hits were gene orthologs of the giant panda (A. melanoleuca, 14'816 contigs) and the domestic dog (C. familiaris, 8038 contigs) (Fig. 1 ). Both of these species, as well as the ferret, are part of Caniformia, a suborder within the order Carnivora. More than 7000 contigs showed high similarity to LINE-1 reverse transcriptase and were removed from functional analysis. Using the human protein and RNA databases for the blast analysis resulted in 52'510 contigs being aligned to human proteins or RNAs (corresponding to 13'697 different human transcripts or proteins). As we expected these genes to represent the a large amount of the expressed ferret genes, it was not surprising that the most overrepresented gene-annotation categories from the enrichment analysis were of a more general type, such as ''cellular process'', ''metabolic process'', ''macromolecule biosynthetic process'' and ''protein localization''. When investigating the overlap with the genes associated the GO-term representing the immune system process (GO:002376), we found that the combined sequence assembly contained full or partial transcripts corresponding to almost 80% (1078 of 1390 genes) of the human gene orthologs associated with this GO-term (Table S3 ).
