FVM04 Binds to an Exposed Region of the Filovirus RBS We recently described several macaque-derived pan-ebolavirus mAbs (Keck et al., 2015) . One of these mAbs (FVM04) neutralized both EBOV and SUDV and showed significant efficacy in mice when administered at two doses, one on the day of challenge and one 3 dpi (Keck et al., 2015) . Our studies suggested that FVM04 targets a conformational epitope shared among all ebolaviruses with a low level of cross-reactivity to MARV (Keck et al., 2015) . In order to define the FVM04 epitope, we used an alanine scanning approach, where FVM04 binding was evaluated against a ''shotgun mutagenesis'' mutation library of EBOV GP with 641 of 644 target residues individually mutated. Human HEK293T cells were transfected with the entire library in a 384-well array format (one clone per well; Figure 1A ) and assessed for reactivity to FVM04 by high-throughput flow cytometry. The epitope mapping identified EBOV GP residues K115, D117, and G118 as critical for FVM04 binding (Figure 1 ). Alanine substitutions at these residues reduced FVM04 binding to 29%, 1%, and 2% of wild-type, respectively, suggesting that these residues constitute key contact sites for FVM04, with D117 and G118 having the greatest energetic contribution to FVM04 binding ( Figures 1B and 1C ). In contrast, binding of two other panebolavirus antibodies FVM02 and FVM09 (Keck et al., 2015) was not affected by these mutations ( Figure 1C ). The putative epitope of FVM04 is positioned in a previously described region with a crest-and-trough morphology (Bornholdt et al., 2016; Hashiguchi et al., 2015) within the RBS and constitutes the tip of the hydrophilic crest (red dotted outline in Figure 1D ), which interacts with a loop from the endosomal filovirus receptor NPC1 (Wang et al., 2016) . In contrast to this exposed tip of the crest, the trough is lined with hydrophobic residues and occluded by the b14-b15 loop within the glycan cap (black dotted outline in Figure 1D ). This occlusion explains why trough-binding mAbs do not bind and neutralize EBOV unless the glycan cap is removed by proteolysis . Interestingly, while FVM04 binds well to EBOV GP, this binding was moderately enhanced by alanine substitution of N238, T240, N257, T259, N268, and T270, mutations that delete three out of four glycosylation sites on the glycan cap ( Figure S1 ), suggesting that these glycans may modestly interfere with FVM04 binding. Nonetheless, these data show that FVM04 represents a prototypic pan-ebolavirus antibody that recognizes a uniquely exposed epitope within the RBS. The crest region is highly conserved among all ebolavirus species, and the three residues critical for FVM04 binding are 100% identical among ebolaviruses ( Figure 1E ). An overlay of the crystal structures of EBOV GP (Lee et al., 2008) with the structure of thermolysin-cleaved GP (GP CL ) (Bornholdt et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016) and SUDV GP (Dias et al., 2011) showed high structural conservation within this region and prominent exposure of these residues on the surface of GP CL ( Figure 1F ) and SUDV GP (Figure 1G) . While only one out of the three residues in this putative epitope match between EBOV and MARV ( Figure 1E ), this region still shows a high degree of conformational similarity between EBOV and MARV, with the three critical EBOV residues overlaying well with MARV D99, S101, and G102 ( Figure 1H ). This may explain the low affinity of FVM04 for MARV GP as we previously reported (Keck et al., 2015) . EBOV-neutralizing antibodies KZ52 (Lee et al., 2008; Parren et al., 2002) , 2G4, and 4G7 (Murin et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2012b) bind to overlapping epitopes at the base of the GP trimer consisting of residues from both GP2 and the base of GP1 (Figure 2A ). In contrast, FVM04 appears to bind the apex of the trimer, between the glycan cap and the trimer center (Figure 2A ), therefore representing a distinct class of neutralizing antibodies. In addition to epitope-mapping information (loss-of-function analysis), the alanine-scanning experiments revealed a striking difference between the GP-binding patterns of these ''base-binding'' and ''apex-binding'' classes of neutralizers. While the binding of the base binder KZ52 to all individual mutants remained consistently below 150% of wild-type GP ( Figure 2B ), several single-alanine mutations of GP had a dramatic enhancing effect (as high as 200%-300%) on FVM04 binding ( Figure 2C ). Out of 217 amino acids forming the base, alanine mutation of 23 residues increased FVM04 binding to GP by more than 2-fold ( Figure 2C ; Table S1 ). Most of these residues are hydrophobic, highly networked, and not surface exposed ( Figure S2 ; Table S1 ). In addition to the 23 base residues, mutation of R498 and R501, within the furin cleavage site separating GP1 and GP2 (Volchkov et al., 1998) , also led Human HEK293T cells expressing the mutation library were tested for reactivity to mAbs using an Intellicyt flow cytometer. A typical reactivity pattern (red wells) is shown for a representative assay plate. Eight positive (wild-type EBOV GP) and eight negative (mock-transfected) control wells were included on each plate. (B) The library was tested for reactivity with FVM04. Clones with <30% binding relative to that of wild-type (WT) EBOV GP yet >65% reactivity for a control mAb were initially identified to be critical for FVM04 binding. (C) Mutation of three individual residues reduced FVM04 binding (red bars) but had little effect on the binding of FVM02 and FVM09 (gray bars; Keck et al., 2015) . Bars represent the mean and range ([max√Ämin]/2) of at least two replicate data points. (D) The FVM04 binding residues are shown in red in the crystal structure of EBOV GP. The glycan cap is shown in cyan, and the attachment points for N-linked glycans in orange. The GP1 core is shown in purple, and parts of GP2 are seen in yellow. The RBS crest is shown in red outline and the occluded trough region is shown in black outline. (E) Sequence homology between filoviruses within the RBS crest region containing putative FVM04 epitope. Identical sequences among ebolavirus species and between ebolavirus and marburgvirus are shown in red. The FVM04 binding site is boxed. (F-H) The EBOV GP monomer is depicted as a cartoon overlay with GP CL (F), SUDV GP (G), and MARV RAVN GP (H). Putative critical EBOV contacts made by FVM04 are shown as sticks (red) overlaid with corresponding contact residues from the overlay structure (green). to an increase over 2-fold in FVM04 binding ( Figure 2C ; Table  S1 ). An alanine mutagenesis scan of several other cross-reactive apex-binding antibodies (m8C4, 4B8, FVM09, FVM17, and FVM20) (Holtsberg et al., 2015; Keck et al., 2015) also revealed a similar enhancement of binding to the same alanine mutants that enhance FVM04 binding (Table S1 ). These data suggest that specific mutations in the GP base may have a global impact on the exposure of cross-reactive epitopes in the GP1 head domain. This finding may have major implications for the design of pan-ebolavirus vaccines.
