In the last 22 years, the number of infections notified was rather stable, fluctuating between 646 cases in 2010 and 1066 cases in 2004 (Table 1) . On average, 810 cases were filed each year. However, when the growing number of HWs insured by the BGW is taken into account, the notification rate decreased. The number of full-time workers insured by the BGW increased from 3,238,000 in 1996 to 4,935,000 in 2017. This is an increase of 52%. In 1996, 25.2 claims per 100,000 full-time workers were filed. In 2017, this rate decreased by 39% to 15.4 ( Table 1 ). The rate of confirmed ODs per 100,000 did not change much between 1996 and 2017 (7.0 versus 6.9 per 100,000). The average confirmation rate was 33.0%. The decrease in notified and confirmed cases was most pronounced for blood-borne virus infections. Notified hepatitis B decreased by about 90%, from 267 cases in 1996 to 38 cases in 2017 ( Figure 1 ). The same trend was observed for confirmed claims, with numbers decreasing from 71 to 9. The rate per 100,000 full-time workers decreased from 1996 to 2017 from 8.2 to 0.8 for claims and from 2.2 to 0.2 for hepatitis B-related ODs ( Table 2) . For hepatitis C, the pattern was different. In the first six years the number of notifications increased from 196 in 1996 to 302 cases in 2001. Thereafter, the numbers decreased steadily to 29 in 2017 ( Figure 2 ). The number of confirmed cases was roughly stable between 1996 and 2000 but then started to decrease, from 89 cases in 2001 to 15 cases in 2017. The rate per 100,000 full-time workers decreased from 1996 to 2017 from 6.1 to 0.6 for claims and from 2.9 to 0.3 for hepatitis C-related ODs ( Table 2 ). The average confirmation rate was 24.3% for hepatitis B and 39.7% for hepatitis C. For HIV, the number of notified and confirmed cases was low throughout the whole period (between 2 and 12 claims per year). In total, 141 claims were registered and 34 cases confirmed as OD. A peak of 10 confirmed cases was recorded in 2011. Otherwise, no time trend is apparent ( Table 3 ). The average confirmation rate for HIV was 24.1%. 3  1  13  8  4  1  1  0  1998  5  5  44  20  4  1  0  1  1999  6  3  50  27  9  2  2  0  2000  12  1  44  23  2  0  1  1  2001  8  0  9  16  7  0  0  0  2002  9  1  19  14  5  1  6  0  2003  3  0  18  4  2  3  1  0  2004  11  2  7  5  2  0  0  0  2005  9  2  16  6  1  0  0  0  2006  12  0  23  12  3  0  0  0  2007  4  4  24  8  4  0  0  0  2008  11  2  10  5  2  1  1  0  2009  5  0  23  4  5  2  53  32  2010  5  1  16  18  4  1  5  4  2011  10  10  21  5  4  0  12  3  2012  2  3  42  21  1  0  2  0  2013  3  6  35  22  3  1  11  1  2014  5  0  15  7  1  0  9  1  2015  3  0  13  4  5  1  6  0  2016  3  5  5  3  3  2  8  4  2017  4  2  4  1  5  1  4  1  Total  141  34  456  255  81  17  124  48 Average confirmation rate: HIV/AIDS 24.1%, influenza 38.7%, keratoconjunctivitis 55.9%, cytomegaly 21.0%. A total of 124 influenza-related claims were registered throughout the whole period and 48 were confirmed as OD (Table 3 ). There was a spike during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 (53 claims). The average number of claims per year increased from 1.1 before 2009 to 6.6 after 2009. The average confirmation rate for influenza was 38.7%. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis was the cause of 4 to 50 claims per year, with no obvious time trend. The confirmation rate was 55.9% (Table 3) . Claims for cytomegaly were rather rare (one to nine cases per year) and the average confirmation rate was 21.0%. Unlike blood-borne virus infections, the time trend for TB showed an increase. Though there was considerable variation, the number of claims more than doubled between 1996 and 2017 (173 versus 473 claims) when LTBI and active TB cases are taken into account together. Confirmed claims showed an even steeper increase, from 43 in 1996 to 299 cases in 2017. When distinguishing between active TB and LTBI, an increase was mainly observed for LTBI (Table 4) The number of MRSA cases notified varied. In 2006, the year when MRSA was first recorded separately, 114 cases were registered and one case was confirmed as OD (Table 5 ). In 2017, 39 cases were registered and one case was confirmed. In general, the number of notified cases was lower in the last five years than in previous years. Regardless of the number of notified cases, only a few cases were confirmed (9.2%) and there was no evident time trend.
