As a result of this two-day exercise, 1,181 (72%) of the 1,642 total employees of our institution were reached. As shown in Table 1 (above), the Push POD phase reached 871 of FHMC employees (53%), with 520 (60%) accepting influenza vaccine. During the Pull POD, an additional 310 HCWs (19%) were reached, of whom 118 (38%) were vaccinated (Table 1) . Together, the two-day Push/Pull POD drill achieved a vaccination rate of 54% among the 1,181 employees who were reached, representing 39% (638/1,642) of all HCWs (Table 1 and Table 2 [right]). For 2008-2009, the overall HCW influenza vaccination rate for FHMC was 56%, which included vaccinations offered by the EHS following the two-day Push/Pull POD and documented vaccinations received outside FHMC (Table 2 ). This rate was significantly higher (p < .001) than the 38% rate for the 2006-2007 season ( Table 3 , right).
