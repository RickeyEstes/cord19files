Isolation of a novel MRV3 from diarrheic feces of pigs and ringdried swine blood meal. Nine out of 11 ring-dried swine blood meal (RDSB) samples from different manufacturing sources (82%) and 18 out of 48 fecal samples (37%) from neonatal pigs from farms with epidemic diarrhea outbreaks in North Carolina, Minnesota, and Iowa amplified a 326-bp S1 fragment with orthoreovirus group-specific primers. Among the 18 orthoreoviruspositive fecal samples, 11 samples were further sequence verified using MRV3-S1 gene-specific primers amplifying a 424-bp fragment. Characteristic cytopathic effects (CPE), including syncytium formation and rounding of individual cells, were evident at 48 h postinfection (hpi) in BHK-21 cells inoculated with chloroform-extracted samples of feces and blood meal ( Fig. 1A to C). The infected cell monolayers were completely detached by 72 to 96 hpi. Developing chicken embryos died 2 to 5 days postinoc-ulation (dpi) after inoculation by the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) route. Infected chicken embryos showed hemorrhages ("cherry red appearance") on the body and/or stunted growth ("dwarfing") ( Fig. 1D ). MRV3 antigen was detected in infected BHK-21 cells using monoclonal antibody clone 2Q2048 against 1 protein (Fig. 1E to G). The virus isolates from infected BHK-21 cells or chicken embryos were further confirmed as MRV3 by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and sequencing. Eight virus isolates were obtained, and two representative isolates (T3/Swine/ FS03/USA/2014 and T3/Swine/BM100/USA/2014) were used for further studies. To determine whether normal, healthy pigs harbor orthoreoviruses, we obtained 36 samples of feces and matched samples of plasma from different states (Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, and Illinois) from farms with or without a PEDV outbreak. Six samples of feces and plasma each were obtained from uninfected farms in Indiana and Ohio, 12 samples of feces and plasma each were obtained from a farm in Illinois collected 6 weeks postepidemic diarrhea, and 12 samples of feces and plasma each were obtained from a farm in Iowa collected 6-month post-epidemic diarrhea. None of these samples was found to be positive for orthoreovirus by RT-PCR. Furthermore, chloroform extracts of feces from a few randomly selected MRV3-negative samples were blindly passaged twice on BHK-21 cells, and no CPE was observed. The novel porcine orthoreovirus is unique in morphology and biological characteristics. Genomic RNA from sucrose density gradient-purified virions was resistant to S1 nuclease treatment, confirming the double-stranded nature of the viral genome. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicated that the viral genome consists of 10 segments ( Fig. 2A) . The protein profile of the viruses was consistent with , , and proteins and their subclasses (Fig. 2B) . The virions were stable at 56°C without significant loss of infectivity and remained viable after exposure to 80 or 90°C for 1 h (Fig. 2C ). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of negatively stained virions revealed icosahedral, nonenveloped, double-layered uniformsized particles reminiscent of members of the family Reoviridae Thimmasandra Narayanappa et al. (Fig. 2D ). In infected Vero cells, the presence of paracrystalline arrays of virus particles free of organelles ( Fig. 2E to G) and viral factories in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2H ) was evident. The mean diameter of the virus particles was 82 nm (Fig. 2H , inset), with particle sizes ranging from 80 to 85 nm. The MRV3 isolates (FS03 and BM100) replicated efficiently in BHK-21 cells, with a mean tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) of 6.7 log 10 /ml. Virus infectivity to BHK-21 cells increased after treatment with tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) trypsin (6.7 to 7.7 log 10 /ml), suggesting trypsin resistance. The U.S. porcine MRV3 strains were able to hemagglutinate swine erythrocytes, and this property could be specifically inhibited with MRV3 anti-1 monoclonal antibody. The U.S. porcine orthoreovirus isolates possess virulenceassociated mutations. Deep sequencing (MiSeq) of purified viral RNAs from two selected MRV3 isolates (FS03 from a pig fecal sample and BM100 from a porcine blood meal) confirmed their genomic identity with MRV3. No other contaminating viral sequences were detected in the deep sequence data. The high level of sequence identity between FS03 and BM100 sequences validated our immunofluorescence, gel electrophoresis and virus protein profile data. The total length of the porcine orthoreovirus genome is 23,561 nucleotides (nt). The two porcine isolates have consensus genome termini at the 5= and 3= ends similar to other MRVs. The 5= untranslated region (UTR) ranged in length from 12 to 31 nt, and the 3= UTR ranged in length from 32 to 80 nt, with variations from prototype MRV3 T3D (Table 1 ). The 5= UTRs of both FS03 and BM100 have a 6-nt deletion in L1 and a 1-nt deletion in each of the L2 and S4 segments. In addition, a deletion of 3 nt in the M2 segment open reading frame (ORF) was noticed. The genome of these novel viruses contains reassorted gene segments from other MRVs. The deduced amino acid sequences of FS03 and BM100 are homologous except for 1 protein, with 1 amino acid (aa) change between them. The percentage of homology of each of the different proteins coded by these two viruses with prototype MRV1 to -4 is provided in Table S1 in the supplemental material. On comparison of the deduced amino acids, it appears that with proteins of the L class segment, 2 protein was homologous to MRV1, while the 1 and 3 proteins were highly similar to the MRV1 and -3 prototypes, T1-Lang (T1L) and T3/Dearing (T3D), respectively. In M class proteins, only NS was identical to T3D, while 1 and 2 were identical to T1L. The sequence alignment of 1 protein indicated 6 amino acid substitutions that were unique to these isolates in comparison to the T3/Bat/Germany, T3D, T1L, and T2J isolates (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The 2 protein alignment revealed 15 unique amino acid substitutions compared to the T3/Bat/Germany, T3D, T1L, and T2J sequences (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material) and possessed the S208P mutation compared to T3D. In the S class proteins, all of them appear to originate from European bat (MRV3) viruses, with 88% to 98% identity at amino acid level (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The highest diversity among all proteins was observed for the 1 protein, with close homology to T3/Bat/Germany virus (91%). Deduced amino acid sequence analysis of 1 protein revealed that the sialic acid binding domain (NLAIRLP), and protease resistance (249I) and neurotropism (340 D and 419E) residues were conserved in the U.S. porcine orthoreovirus strains. The novel viruses possessed 31 and 11 unique amino acid substitutions in the 1 and 1s proteins in comparison to T3/Bat/ Germany and other MRV prototypes, respectively (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). The novel U.S. porcine orthoreovirus is evolutionarily related to MRV3. Phylogenetic analysis of the FS03 and BM100 isolates revealed a strong evolutionary relationship with MRV3 strains. The ORFs of the nucleotide sequences of the L1, S1, S2, S3, and S4 segments (see Table S2 and S3 in the supplemental material) were used to construct the phylogenetic trees. Based on S1 phylogeny, both isolates were monophyletic with MRV3 of bat origin ( Fig. 3 ) and formed a distinct lineage together with the bat strains under lineage 3 (Fig. 4 ). Phylogenetic analysis of segment S2 indicated that the novel MRV3 isolates were monophyletic with the human T3D, T1L, and Chinese porcine T1 strains (Fig. 5A ). The S3 phylogeny indicated that U.S. MRV3 strains were closely related to T1L and Chinese pig and European bat MRV3 strains (Fig. 5B ). The topologies of S4 segment phylogenetic trees revealed that the U.S. porcine MRV3 isolates were closely related to Chinese T1 and T3 pig isolates (Fig. 5C ). The L1 segment phylogeny revealed a close relationship to Chinese porcine T3 strains (Fig. 5D) . The U.S. porcine orthoreovirus is highly pathogenic to pigs. Experimental neonatal pigs were screened for swine deltacoronavirus, PEDV, Kobuvirus, swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), rotavirus, and orthoreoviruses by RT-PCR and found to be negative, except for three pigs that were positive for Kobuvirus, whose pathogenicity is yet to be established. Neonatal pigs orally inoculated with purified viruses FS03, BM100, T3/Swine/I03/ USA/2014 (I03), or a chloroform extract of blood meal 100 (CBM100) developed clinical illness in all infected animals (100%), with loss of physical activity, severe diarrhea, and de-crease in body weight. Infected animals had significantly high mean clinical scores compared to the mock-infected group (P Ͻ 0.01). Piglets infected with FS03 and I03 had the highest clinical scores as early as 1 dpi, which peaked at 3 dpi (Fig. 6A ). Three pigs in the mock-infected group had a slow recovery from parenteral anesthetics, with elevated mean clinical scores for the first 2 days but returned to normal later. Gross lesions, such as catarrhal enteritis ( Fig. 6B ) and intussusception (Fig. 6C) , were observed in all of the infected animals. The cumulative macroscopic lesion scores of FS03 and I03 were higher than those of other groups on day 4 dpi (Fig. 6D ). Compared to mock-infected pigs (Fig. 6E ), small intestines of the virus-infected pigs showed mild to severe villous blunting and fusion (crypt/villous ratios of 1:1 to 1:4) (Fig. 6F ), occasional villous epithelial syncytial cells (Fig. 6G) , swollen epithelial cells with granular cytoplasm and multifocal necrosis of mucosal epithelium (Fig. 6H) , and round to oval vacuoles in the intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 6I) . In a few pigs, protein casts in renal tubules, minimal to mild hepatic lipidosis and hepatocellular vacuolar changes, and mild to moderate suppurative bronchopneumonia were also seen. Ultrastructural examination revealed multinucleated cells with apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 7A) , and in some cells, dark granular bodies resembling stress granules were seen (Fig. 7B ). Viral particles were localized in regions of the cytoplasm that lacked typical cytoplasmic organelles (Fig. 7C ). Large numbers of viral particles egressed by cell lysis (Fig. 7D) or as a string of beads through microvilli from infected villous epithelial cells (Fig. 7E ) into the lumen of the intestine (Fig. 7F ). Multinucleated cells with virions egressing through microvilli were evident (Fig. 7G ). Virions disrupt microvilli before release and were still surrounded by the cell membrane of microvilli (Fig. 7H) , and after release were devoid of membranes in the lumen of the intestine (Fig. 7I) . Virus replication in the intestines and fecal virus shedding in infected pigs were also confirmed by virus isolation in cell culture and by S1-segment-specific RT-PCR. The intestinal contents had MRV3 virus in 80% of the infected piglets through RT-PCR, suggesting the virus replication in the intestine is consistent with electron microscopic findings of virus replication within the enterocytes.
