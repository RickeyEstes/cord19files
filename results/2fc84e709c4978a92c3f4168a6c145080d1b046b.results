Five IBV isolates were obtained in early 2011. Two IBV isolates were from Jordan (JOA2 and JOA4), two were from Saudi Arabia (Saudi-1 and Saudi-2), and one isolate was from Iraq (Iraqi IBV). The Jordanian isolates were isolated from layer farms at their peak of egg production, the Saudi strains were obtained from broilers and the Iraqi IBV isolate was obtained from a breeder farm as shown in Table 2 . According to the clinical and gross examination coupled with the RT-PCR results from the different tissues (trachea, kidney, ovarian tissues, and cecal tonsils), these isolates had an extensive tissue tropism, different than the CK/CH/LDL/97I strain, which has tropism only for the respiratory system. The clinical signs ranged from respiratory to reproductive symptoms; two isolates (JOA2, Iraqi IBV) were implicated in kidney pathology in affected birds. RT-PCR products of the diagnostic N gene assay were detected (380 bp) and for the phylogenetic S1 gene (392 bp). Direct-automated sequencing of the second RT-PCR product of nested S1 (SX3 and SX4 primers) was performed. The reference IBV strains included in the S1 sequence analysis from the United States were M41, Connecticut, DEL072, Ark/15C/96, and Beaudette. The European strains were 4/91, D3896, B1648, and H120. The Australian strains were N1/62 and N1/88. The Chinese strains were IBV LX4, QX IBV, J2, Q1, CK/CH/LDL/97I, and CK/CH/SCYA/10I. Middle Eastern IBV strains were IS/1201, IS/1366, IS/1464, IS/885, variant 1, variant 2, and Sul/01/09 as shown in Table 3 . All five IBV isolates (JOA2, JOA4, Saudi-1, Saudi-2, and Iraqi IBV) were found to be of the IBV strain CK/CH/LDL/97I and therefore they are CK/CH/LDL/97Ilike strains. The CK/CH/LDL/97I strain is known to be endemic in China and Taiwan. The nucleotide identity between these five IBV isolates ranged from 96.9 to 99.7% with the Saudi-2 isolate being the most divergent. The identity of relatedness between the isolated IBV strains, CK/ CH/LDL/97I, and the related strain CK/CH/SCYA/10I [20] is shown in identity to the CK/CH/LDL/97I and CK/CH/SCYA/10I strains, respectively. A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the alignment of the partial S1 sequence. The five IBV isolates were aligned with other reference and related IBV strains as shown in Figure 1 . It showed that all five IBV isolates were grouped with CK/CH/LDL/97I, CK/CH/SCYA/10I, J2, and Q1 (both J2 and Q1 were isolated from the proventriculus) [8] in one group. The nucleotide identity of these five isolates to the IBV vaccine strains in the three countries (M41, H120, and 4/91) were in the range of 78-82.1%, to variant 1 IBV strains in the range of 78.9-81.5%, to variant 2 IBV strains in the range of 81.7-83.6%, and to the IS/885 and Sul/01/09 strains in the range of 78.3-80.9% (data not shown). Also, these IBV isolates represent a group distinct from the LX4 IBV type and from QXIBV and IS/1201 (a Middle Eastern strain) related to it. These strains share only 79% nucleotide sequence identity. The lowest nucleotide identity was seen with the DEL072 strain (58%) and with the N1/88 strains (63%) from Australia.
