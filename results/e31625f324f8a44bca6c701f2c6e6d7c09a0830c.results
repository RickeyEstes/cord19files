Diarrheic stool from 100 patients was collected. Fourteen samples were excluded from the molecular testing arm due to insufficient sample volume or sample processing deficiency. Patient demographics are outlined in Table 1 . The mean age was 34.9 with 5 patients under the age of 14. 43.0% of patients were male, 80.2% lived in an urban area, 17.4% had access to well water only, 88.4% had access to proper latrines, and 81.4% practiced proper hand hygiene. Patients median duration of diarrhea was 10 days with 53.5% having acute diarrhea and 7.0% having chronic diarrhea. Median bowel movement frequency per day was 5. The median CD4 cell count was 361.5/μL with 36.1% having CD4 cell counts < 200/μL. The majority (72.1%) of patients were receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at the time of collection. Out of the 100 specimens, 28 were positive for intestinal parasites using wet mounts and modified acid fast staining. C. parvum was the most common parasite at 28.6% followed by E. histolytica (17.9%), G. lamblia at (14.3%), C. cayetanensis (14.3%), S. stercoralis, (7.1%) and hookworm (3.6%). The enteropathogens detected by the Allplex™ panel are outlined in Fig. 1 Older age was associated with Campylobacter spp., only occurring in patients between over the age of 35 (p = 0.04). D. fragilis was associated with increased frequency of diarrhea (median 4 movements when D. fragilis present compared to median 5, p = 0.02). Use of well water was associated with Cryptosporidium (33.3% with well water vs 6.0%, p = 0.001). A box plot describing enteropathogen frequencies with CD4 cell count is outlined in Fig. 2 . Only viral enteropathogens and STEC were associated with CD4 cell counts. A CD4 cell count < 500/μL was associated with the presence of a viral enteropathogen (p = 0.004) and the absence of STEC (p = 0.018) ( Table 2 ). Lower CD4 cell counts were also associated with a longer duration of diarrhea (p = 0.0015) and older age (p = 0.011). Associations between organisms at CD4 count < 200/uL and < 50/uL were analyzed and none were found to be statistically significant. The number of organisms detected in one sample was not associated with any specific demographic, including CD4 cell count, administration of HAART, age, duration of diarrhea or frequency of diarrhea. This was also the case when excluding B. hominis, D. fragilis and Aeromonas spp.
