We determined the crystal structure of IFN-λ1 bound to its high-affinity receptor IFN-λR1. IFN-λ1 used in crystallization experiments was expressed both in E. coli cells (IFN-λ1 bac ) and in Drosophila cells (IFN-λ1 ins ), whereas IFN-λR1 was expressed only in insect cells. 47 Both complexes were formed in a 1:1 molar ratio, purified, and crystallized. The details of expression, purification, crystallization, and data collection procedures have been previously described. 47 The crystal structures were solved using molecular replacement and revealed a complex consisting of IFN-λ1 bound to IFN-λR1 in a 1:1 ratio. Since the two structures determined in this work are essentially identical with one another, only the structure of the IFN-λ1 ins /IFN-λR1 complex will Fig. 1 . Structure of the complex of IFN-λ1 and IFN-λR1. (a) IFN-λ1 is in green, IFN-λR1 is in cyan, glycosylation sites are in blue (Asn) and yellow (carbohydrates), glycerol is in magenta, disulfide bonds are yellow spheres, IFN-λ1 residues at the interface are in orange, and IFN-λR1 residues at the interface are in red. Amino acid side chains, carbohydrates, and solvent molecules are depicted in stick format. The location of the site 1 and site 2 interfaces is labeled. (b) The structure of IFN-λ1, in the same orientation as is found in (a). The helices found in the ligand are labeled A through F with the N and C termini also labeled. (c) The structure of IFN-λR1, in the same orientation as found in (a). The loops found in the receptor are labeled, from L1 to L13. The N and C termini are labeled as well. Disulfide bonds are depicted as yellow sticks. be discussed below. The parts of the IFN-λ1 ins /IFN-λR1 complex that could be modeled contain residues 22-170 of IFN-λ1 and residues 4-203 of IFN-λR1. In addition, 268 water molecules, 3 glycerol molecules, and N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn9, Asn16, and Asn122 of IFN-λR1 were also modeled. The model possesses good stereochemistry as evaluated by MolProbity, with no residues found in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. IFN-λ1 ins /IFN-λR1 was refined to final R-factors of 0.1836 and 0.2278 for R work and R free , respectively.
