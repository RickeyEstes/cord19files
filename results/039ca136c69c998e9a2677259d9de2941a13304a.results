In the current study, we compared the receptor-binding properties of the H7 protein of the human H7N9 virus (referred to as human H7) with that of a closely related H7N9 virus derived from an Eurasian teal (Anas crecca; referred to as teal H7) using a recombinant protein approach 20,21 . A similar approach 22 was used to compare the properties of the N9 proteins of these two viruses (referred to as human and teal N9). The recombinant protein approach renders the use of viruses, which results in obvious biosafety issues, superfluous. Recent studies have shown the potential of recombinant soluble oligomeric HA (sHA 3 ) and NA (sNA 4 ) proteins to study the receptor-binding properties of HA and the enzymatic activity of NA 17, 20, 21 . The genetic distance between the human and teal HA and NA proteins is shown in supplementary Fig. S1 . The teal H7N9 virus is one of the closest relatives of the novel H7N9 viruses that contains both the H7 and the N9 genes. This was also exemplified by a protein blast search with the human H7 and N9 proteins, in which the teal H7 and N9 proteins were the first hits that are derived from a H7N9 virus sequenced prior to 2013. Comparison of functional pairs of HA and NA proteins of the teal and human H7N9 viruses not only allows us to study and compare the receptor-binding properties and enzymatic activities of H7 and N9 proteins derived from different hosts, but also to study the functional relationship between these complementary proteins. Human and teal H7 proteins differ in their fetuin binding. The purified human and teal H7 proteins were tested for their ability to bind fetuin. Fetuin contains mono-, bi-, and tri-antennary glycans carrying both a2-3 and a2-6 SIAs 23 . Binding of HA to fetuin was detected both for the teal and human H7 proteins, albeit with different efficiencies (Fig. 1A) . The binding of the human H7 protein was significantly less efficient than that of the teal H7 protein (Fig. 1B) . For comparison, the H5 (derived from an avian H5N1 virus) and H1 (derived from a seasonal human H1N1 virus) proteins, which were previously shown to specifically bind to a2-3 and a2-6 SIAs, respectively 21, 24 , were also included. Binding of H5 to fetuin was more efficient than that of the H1 protein, which displayed similar binding to fetuin as the human H7 protein. We also analyzed the ability of the different recombinant proteins using hemagglutination assays with chicken, human or horse erythrocytes. (supplementary Fig. S2 ). The human H7 protein agglutinated both human and chicken erythrocytes, but to a lesser extent than the teal H7 or the H5 protein. The human H7 protein did not agglutinate horse erythrocytes. The H1 protein only showed appreciable agglutination of human erythrocytes. These results show that the human and teal H7 proteins have different receptor-binding properties. Whether this also reflects a difference in binding specificity (a2-3 versus alpha a2-6 SIA) will be addressed below. Furthermore, the hemagglutination assays indicate differences in receptor binding between the human H7 and H1 proteins. Human and teal N9 proteins differ in their enzymatic activity. The purified NA proteins were analyzed for their enzymatic activity by assaying the ability of these proteins to remove SIA residues from fetuin, which results in the formation of peanut agglutinin (PNA) binding sites 25 (Fig. 2A) . The teal N9 protein consistently displayed a significantly higher sialidase activity than the human N9 protein and less N9 protein was needed for half maximal PNA binding (EC50 of 0.01380 vs 0.029 mg, P , 0.001). In agreement herewith, the teal protein more efficiently reduced the binding of the a2-3 SIAspecific lectin MAL I compared to the human protein ( Fig. 2B ). However, both proteins were equally inefficient in the removal of a2-6 SIAs, as incubation of fetuin with these proteins resulted in negligible reduction in binding of the a2-6 SIA-specific lectin SNA, compared to a control N1 protein (Fig. 2C) . Thus, compared to the teal virus, the human H7N9 virus not only carries an HA protein that displays less efficient binding to fetuin, it also contains an NA protein that is less active.
