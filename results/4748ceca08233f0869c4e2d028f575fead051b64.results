3.1. Selection of siRNA target sequences in mRNA of Spike protein The coronavirus Spike protein plays a critical role in virus infection. Therefore, we chose the S gene as a target for inhibition of SARS-CoV infection. To locate the target site of siRNA in the SARS-CoV genome, we selected those sequences of 22 bp with the structure of AGN 18 TT. As an empirical design, we preferably chose the sites with GC/AT ratios between 30% and 60%. Also we used the selected sequences to search GenBank to con¢rm their speci¢city. In matching for those criteria, two speci¢c target sequences were determined and noted, S-RNAi1 and S-RNAi2. A schematic presentation of the sequences is shown in Fig. 1A . Those two targeted sequences in the Spike protein were at 1358^1376 and 30813 099 bp from the ¢rst ATG of the cDNA of the gene, which were located in the S1 and S2 region of the protein, respectively.
