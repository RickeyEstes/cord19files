Bacterial and viral diarrheagenic pathogens are persistent in livestock population in India. In the present study, samples positive for coinfection with E. coli, Salmonella, Rotavirus A, and Picobirnavirus GG1 were detected from diarrheic fecal samples (n=339) only; whereas, no coinfection of organisms was detected from 118 non-diarrheic fecal samples collected during 2013-15. A total of 11 (2.40%) fecal samples from Northeast states were found positive for more than one pathogen as depicted in Table-2 . Of the overall 11 positive samples, two samples from Manipur were found positive for coinfection of EPEC and Picobirnavirus GG1. In case of coinfection from samples of Meghalaya, a total of five diarrheic samples were found positive for at least two enteric pathogens. One fecal sample was found positive for EPEC and Rotavirus A; two samples were positive for both Salmonella Typhimurium (stn) and Picobirnavirus GGI; one sample was found positive for EPEC and Picobirnavirus GG1, whereas, in one diarrheic sample, three enteric pathogens, namely Picobirnavirus GG1, EPEC, and Salmonella rough strain (stn) were detected harboring associated virulence genes. In Mizoram, a total of three samples were positive for coinfection with at least two pathogens. One diarrheic sample was found positive for STEC (stx 2 gene), S. Typhimurium (invasive, invA gene), and Picobirnavirus GG1; and two diarrheic fecal samples were found positive for both S. Typhimurium (stn) and Picobirnavirus GG1. However, in diarrheic samples from piglets of Nagaland, only one sample was found positive for S. Typhimurium (stn) and STEC (stx 2 ). Among the pathogens under study, coinfection with either Picobirnavirus GG1 was found to be more frequent (n=8). In all the positive samples with Picobirnavirus GG1 were found as coinfective with enteric bacterial pathogens either EPEC, STEC, or Salmonella. However, Rotavirus type A (RVA) was detected only in one diarrheic sample as coinfection with EPEC. Five diarrheic samples were found to be coinfective of EPEC with other infectious agents, namely Salmonella, RVA, and Picobirnavirus GG1. Shigatoxigenic E. coli STEC (stx 2 gene) were detected as coinfective strain with Salmonella and Picobirnavirus GG1 in two diarrheic samples under the study. Again, seven diarrheic samples from North Eastern states were found to be positive for Salmonella spp. as one of the coinfective agents with other enteric pathogens, in which the most frequent Salmonella serotype involved was Typhimurium (Table-2 ). In total, 9 (3.87%) samples harboring pathogens involved as coinfection in piglets was detected from unorganized farms, whereas only 2 (0.88%) samples were from organized farms. Again, of the 11 positive samples, crossbreed piglets recorded higher detection of mixed infection (9; 2.75%) than local indigenous piglets (2; 1.53%). The samples in the present study were collected during different seasons of the year. The occurrence of coinfection was found to be most common during summer season (n=6; 4.68%), followed by winter (n=3; 2.27%), spring (n=1; 1.07%), and autumn (n=1; 0.96%), respectively.
