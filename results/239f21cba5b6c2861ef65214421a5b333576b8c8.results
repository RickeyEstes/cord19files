In 45 necropscid calves, three (6.66%) cases were positive for rotavirus and four (8.88%) cases were found positive for coronavirus by employing RT-PCR (Figs. 1 and 2 respectively) and IHC. All seven cases (rotavirus-3 and coronavirus-4) were found positive in below one month of age of calves. In three cases, where rotavirus was identified, grossly the serosa of small and large intestine was severely congested and the lumen filled with blood mixed catarrhal contents. The pin head sized hemorrhagic spots were found on the mucosal surfaces of the jejunum and the ileum. Mesenteric lymph nodes were swollen, severely congested and edematous. Histopathological examination of the ileum showed fusion and sloughing of villi enterocytes and severe engorgement of capillary plexus and mononuclear cells (mainly lymphocytes and few macrophages) infiltration in the lamina propria (Fig. 3, a) .The crypt epithelium was found proliferated. The Peyer's patches were edematous and congested and lymphoid cells were depleted and necrosed (Fig. 3, b) . The mesenteric lymph nodes showed engorged vessels and depletion of lymphoid follicles and with moderate deposition of fibrin in the cortex and the medulla (Fig. 3, c) .We observed immunohistochemical staining for rotavirus in all three calves which were positive from RT-PCR. The rotavirus antigen distribution (dark brown signals) was prominent within the lining epithelium of the villi along with peyer's patches of the ileum (Fig. 4c) . We also detected strong immunohistochemical staining for rotavirus in the lymphocytes and some macrophages of mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 4b) . Four cases in which coronavirus was detected, grossly reddish white necrotic ulcers were seen on serosal surface of the colon. The ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes were markedly congested and swollen. The colonic mucosa was covered with thick, fibrinous diphtheric membrane (Fig. 5, a) . Microscopically, the villi of the ileum were sloughed off at several places and their lamina propria was severely engorged/hemorrhagic and infiltrated with mononuclear cells. There was thick homogeneous necrotic material adhered upon upper mucous surface of the colon (Fig. 5, b) . Mesenteric lymph nodes showed moderate depletion of many cortical follicles (Fig. 3, d) . In other one case, grossly, whole small and large intestinal tract was moderately congested and filled with yellowish faecal material. Mesenteric lymph nodes were juicy, enlarged and slightly congested. Histopathological examination of the jejunum showed severs infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria and crypts showed skipping lesion of microabscesses (Fig. 5, c) . Crypt lining cells were slightly hyperplastic. The capsule of mesenteric lymph nodes was thick and lymphoid follicles were necrosed. We observed immunohistochemical staining for coronavirus antigen in all four calves which was positive from RT-PCR. The BCoV antigen distribution was prominent within the lining epithelium of the villi, necrotic crypts in the jejunum and cryptic microabscesses in the colon and ileum (Fig. 6) . We also detected strong immunoreactions in the mononuclear cells of mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 6d) .
