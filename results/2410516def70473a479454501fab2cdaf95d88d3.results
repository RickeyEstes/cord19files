HCoV-OC43 enters HCT-8 the cell via endosomes. First, we determined whether the virus requires endocytosis, or the virus-cell fusion may occur on the cell surface. HCT-8 cells were pre-incubated with NH 4 Cl and subsequently incubated with the virus in the presence of NH 4 Cl, which prevents acidification of endosomes during maturation. Afterwards, media was refreshed to remove unbound virus particles. Infection was carried on for 3 days and its course was monitored with flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1 , addition of NH 4 Cl early during the infection resulted in reduction of the number of virus-positive cells. Similarly, another inhibitor of endocytic compartment acidification, vacuolar-type ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, limited the number of infected cells (Fig. 1) . In order to confirm our observation, we evaluated co-localization of virus particles with early endosome marker EEA1. HCT-8 cells were overlaid with HCoV-OC43 and incubated at 4 °C to synchronize entry of viral particles. Next, cultures were warmed up to 32 °C to enable intracellular transport and virus internalization. Subsequently, cultures were fixed, permeabilized and stained with specific antibodies to visualize viral proteins and EEA1 5-20 min post-inoculation (p.i). virus particles co-localized with EEA1, but remained in a close proximity to the cellular membrane ( Fig. 2A,B ). After that time virions started to gradually accumulate in larger, less abundant clusters (Fig. 2C-F) to eventually enter the cell.
