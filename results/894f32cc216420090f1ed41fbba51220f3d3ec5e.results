Rotaviruses were detected in 4.4 % of rural outpatients during the dry season and in 1.8 % during the rainy season, whereas enteric adenoviruses were found in only one diarrhoeic child (0.4 % in the dry season). Symptomless controls also occasionally excreted rotaviruses in their stools (0.5 %). It is worth mentioning that coronavirus-like particles were equally visualized by electron microscopy, in both diarrhoeie and control patients. A bacterial enteropathogen was isolated in 39.9 % of the patients during the dry season and in 47.2 % during the rainy season. It was also found in 8 % of control eases. Among hospitalized patients, rotavirus excretion occurred in one child suffering from diarrhoea whereas no virus shedding could be observed in asymptomatie eases. The age distribution of the different enteroFathogenic agents confirms that rotavirus occurs mainly in children under two years of age (92 %). The difference in detection rate between rural (4.4 %) and urban patients (7.5 %) was not statistically significant. Considering the delay between the onset of diarrhoea and the collection of the stool sample, it appears that 90 % of rotavirus isolates are detected during the early stage of the disease, as expected.
