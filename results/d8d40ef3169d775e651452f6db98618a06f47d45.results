At this point, the government's emergency response has a controlling effect on the dissemination of information, including the elimination of rumors and communication of the truth. Fig. 1 shows that government response controls the speed with which emergency information propagates through media, and information on an event enters a second stage: the control period. The online popularity of the event and the number of netizens who are concerned decrease sharply, as does the speed of transmission. As the government and netizens continue to interact, the following four steps repeat: (1) government interpretation (official release of news), (2) netizen questioning, (3) government reinterpretation (official release of news), and (4) netizen re-questioning. At Fig. 1 . The three periods of emergency incident spreading (spread period, control period, and stable period). Neutral: the potential communicator or the recipient of the information. Advocate: the recipient of public sentiment regarding the incident. Withdrawal: withdraw from the spreading of public sentiment by netizens. the same time, the government also takes measures to restore social trust. Netizens' emotions will gradually converge, and the emergency will subside, both of which entail that the event will receive less attention. Fig. 1 demonstrates that the speed with which emergency information propagates gradually becomes very slow and stabilizes after a point. This marks the beginning of a third stage-the stable stage-during which time netizens almost entirely lose interest. Considered together, Fig. 1 demonstrates a consistent trend in online public sentiment during an emergency: It grows rapidly for a time and then gradually disappears in a manner consistent with true lyrical spikes and thick tail data. This indicates that the simulation has high credibility and is consistent with reality. In addition, the weight of each subject attribute is credible and, therefore, reflects the transmission of public opinion networks in China. We further analyzed the media attribute weights at each stage ( Fig. 1 ) and found that when the level of trust remains low, netizens have a strong desire for information dissemination and seriously overestimate information, resulting in a state of "high weight." This means that Internet users may be convinced of network rumors and even spread undisclosed information at random. At this point, Internet users over interpret existing event information. Meanwhile, if the government speedily intervenes in supervising and controlling online public sentiment, then official media can guide the direction of public opinion, thereby reducing the risk of information spreading throughout the network without control. Because of the openness and freedom of network media, opinion leaders exist who have a larger influence and can attract more attention; these leaders play an important role in mediating public opinion communication. When netizens are in a semi-closed state, it is easier to spread unproven information at random and in a limited rational situation, thus accelerating the speed of transmission of public opinion across the network. In a worst-case scenario, this triggers a mass network public opinion event: When netizens are in a semi-closed state, in the case of bounded rationality, they may randomly spread unconfirmed information and criticize network rumors, thus speeding up the spread of events and increasing the amount of online public opinion. This will, in turn, trigger a discussion among netizens, induce negative emotions among the people, trigger violations and excessive behavior among the masses, and threaten social stability. We adjusted the relevant parameter settings of the media, strengthened the media influence and credibility, kept the other subject parameter attributes unchanged, and examined the role of opinion leaders in network public opinion communication. While keeping the other subjects' attributes unchanged in order to analyze the influence of these so-called opinion leaders. As shown in Fig. 1 , these leaders rapidly promote the spread of public opinion and play an active role in their evolution. The number of people actively spreading news has grown rapidly, thereby increasing the official media activity by expanding the relevant attributes of the media. Fig. 2 shows how the model changes after shifting the media attributes. In this situation, changing media attributes have doubled the number of Internet users participating in discussions, increasing the number of netizens who trust and receive media information. At the same time, the number of netizens creating and spreading rumors has decreased, thus pushing public sentiment into a stable stage. Finally, we adjusted the government's credibility to 0.9 and government information disclosure speed and transparency to 0.6, while keeping all other subject attributes unchanged (Fig. 3) . A shift is noticeable after government intervention in an emergency: When the government's credibility, openness, and transparency are stronger, netizens' emotions gradually stabilize, and their fears are eliminated. The presence of official information entails that netizens will not arbitrarily spread news. The overall number of discussions drops significantly, and the sensational nature of an emergency quickly dissipates. This controls the risk in the transmission of online public sentiment. 1 The sooner the government releases information, the higher the rate of acceptance by the media and netizens. 2 Increased government guidance releases positive signals to netizens and the media and makes it easier to control information. 3 The spread of public opinion throughout a network is nonlinear. Therefore, the more authority a government has to release information, the faster it can obtain the convergence of the media and netizens and reach equilibrium. 4 Government credibility also has an important impact on the evolution of online public sentiments. The higher the credibility, the higher the support of the media and netizens. 5 Government guidance and supervision impacts both netizens and the media. Stronger guidance and supervision make a greater impact on the media, which enhances the government's ability to guide the network.
