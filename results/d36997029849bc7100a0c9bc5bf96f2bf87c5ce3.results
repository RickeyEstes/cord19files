During this period, 253 children were hospitalized with bronchiolitis; 249 NA were analyzed by IFA and 207 by PCR. This loss was due to collection of insufficient material or errors in the freezing and transport (n = 42). RSV was detected by IFA in 147 cases, 8 false-positives and 27 false-negatives were identified by PCR (n = 207). The rate of detection increased from 58.1% to 66.7% with PCR. The RSV A was responsible for 36.7% and the RSV B for 32.9%. Adenovirus was detected in 8 cases by IFA alone, by PCR, 3 were false-positives and 20 false-negatives. The detection rate raised from 3.2% to 10.0% (n = 197). The IFA alone detected 4 cases of IV A and none of IV B. By PCR, we detected 1 IV A and 2 IV B false-negatives and no false-positives (n = 197). The total positivity for IV A was 5 cases and for IV B 2 cases. PIV 1 was detected in 1 sample with IFA and in 6 after testing with PCR (n = 197). PIV 2 was present in 2 samples by IFA. After PCR there was 1 false-positive and 3 false-negatives (n = 197); the detection increased from 2 to 4 cases. PIV 3 was detected in 16 samples with the IFA alone, 6 of which were false-positives and 1 false-negative (n = 197). The number of cases decline from 16 to 11. We found 8 cases positive for bocavirus, as single agent in 2 cases (n = 197), 8 for rhinovirus (n = 197) and 11 for hMPV (n = 196). All samples analyzed for coronavirus 229/E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1 and for enterovirus were negative (n = 197). The positive cases for IFA and negative by PCR were double checked by RT-PCR and remained negative. Fig. 1 describes the relative frequency of each virus. The infections caused by more than one virus were present in 13.3% and after the evaluation by this extensive panel of viruses, 49 cases (19.7%) remained without an etiology.
