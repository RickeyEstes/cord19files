Over the first 22 months of implementation, 198 patients were referred to the RAFT clinic and 154 (78%) were assessed, while 44 patients referred to the RAFT clinic failed to present to the clinic as instructed. Of those who did not come to the clinic on referral, 19 (43%) were contacted and rescheduled, 9 (20%) felt completely well and did not want an appointment and 13 (30%) were lost to follow-up, though not seen again in the ED for their presenting illness. Of the 154 patients referred and assessed in the RAFT clinic, 68 (44%) were men and 86 (56%) were women. Median age was 36 years (range 16-78 years). English was the first language of 81% (n=124). Median time between presentation to the ED and evaluation by an ED physician was 76 min (range 9-359 min; 90th centile 168 min), compared to a provincial median of 60 min and 90th centile of 180 min (Ovens, unpublished data). Median time between initial presentation to the ED and to the first malaria screen was 105 min (range 0-911 min). Median time between initial presentation to the ED and to final disposition was 290.5 min (range 32-936 min; 90th centile 537.8 min), compared to a provincial median of 180 min and 90th centile of 420 min (Ovens, unpublished data). Mean time to RAFT Clinic assessment following ED discharge was 1.2±0.07 days (range 0-4 days) Figure 1 Algorithm for assessment of fever in the returned traveller. †The Rapid Tropical Assessment Clinic is designed to ensure definitive disposition of a febrile returned traveller within 24 hours of their initial emergency room presentation. Between Friday after 8:00 and Sunday before 8:00, as well as statutory holidays and the obligatory ambulatory closure for 2 weeks over the Christmas/New Year's block, the Rapid Tropical Assessment Clinic is unavailable. During these times, if the patient does not have Plasmodium falciparum or otherwise fulfil admission criteria, the patient should still be referred to General Internal Medicine or Infectious Diseases for disposition (as per standard historical procedure). §Additional investigations should be based on clinical judgement. For example, a febrile returned traveller with diarrhoea should also have stool investigations; a febrile returned traveller with dysuria should have urine Culture&Sensitivity±STI screening, etc.*If the malaria screen is positive for Plasmodium vivax, P. ovale or P. malariae (ie, non-P. falciparum), please initiate chloroquine therapy: 4 tablet loading dose (600 mg base), followed by 2 tablets 6 hours later. Completion of therapy will be organised by the Rapid Tropical Assessment Clinic. If the malaria screen is positive for P. vivax and the patient travelled to Papua New Guinea or Indonesia, please initiate Malarone therapy: 4 tablets orally×1 with food. Completion of therapy will be organised by the Rapid Tropical Assessment Clinic. Chloroquine tablet: 150 mg base (in a 250 mg tablet). Treatment course: Loading dose of 600 mg base, followed by 300 mg base 6 hours later. This is followed by 300 mg base at 24 and 48 hours for a total of 1.5 g base. Malarone tablet: fixed combination of 400-mg atovaquone+100-mg proguanil. Treatment course: 4 tablets orally once daily with food ×3 days.

Time to RAFT Clinic assessment did not differ by age, sex, first language or family physician status; however, we noted an increased time to assessment for referrals made on Friday and Saturday ( p<0.0001; table 1). No patient was admitted to hospital during or following care of their travel-acquired illness in the RAFT clinic. Twenty-two patients (14%) had a repeat visit to the ED prior to assessment in the RAFT clinic, and for those patients, their second malaria screen was performed. The RAFT clinic averted an average of six repeat malaria screens in the ED per month, as these were now being performed in the RAFT clinic, rather than using ED resources. This translates to a 24 hour per month reduction in ED bed-usage, assuming a 4 hour stay in the ED for triage, blood work and the malaria result to be returned. Top regions of exposure were: the Caribbean (n=43, 28%), sub-Saharan Africa (n=31, 20%), South Asia (n=24, 16%), Southeast Asia (n=17, 11%), Central America/Mexico (n=17, 11%) and South America (n=14, 9%). Among 79 different countries visited by RAFT patients, the most common countries of exposure were: India (n=18, 12%), the Dominican Republic (n=15, 10%), Cuba (n=9, 6%), Tanzania (n=9, 6%), Brazil (n=8, 5%), Thailand (n=8, 5%), Mexico (n=7, 4.5%), Jamaica (n=6, 4%) and South Africa (n=5, 3%). The median trip duration was 14 days (range 3-1095 days). The median temperature of RAFT Clinic patients at presentation in the ED was 37.1°C (range 35.2-40.7°C). Adherence to the recommended initial blood work algorithm was variable. Ninety-nine per cent of patients (n=152) had a complete blood count (CBC) drawn, while 98% (n=151) had electrolytes and creatinine drawn. Ninety-four per cent of patients (n=144) received malaria screening. Among those who did not receive malaria screening, 6 of 10 travelled to areas without appreciable malaria risk such as the USA (n=2), Cuba (n=1), Trinidad (n=2) and Mexico (n=1), while 4 (40%) travelled to areas where malaria screening would have been indicated such as Nicaragua (n=2), the Dominican Republic (n=1) and the Philippines (n=1). Adherence to the remainder of the suggested blood work, in decreasing order, was as follows: liver function tests (hepatic transaminases, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) 90% (n=138), blood cultures 88% (n=135) and urinalysis 65% (n=100). Diagnoses were classified into major common presenting febrile syndromes, such as gastrointestinal (n=44, 29%), respiratory (n=39, 25%), vector-borne (n=32, 21%), sexually transmitted infection (STI)/genitourinary (n=13, 8%), lymphadenopathy (n=2, 1%), skin and soft-tissue infections (n=2, 1%), musculoskeletal (n=1, 0.6%), non-specific viral syndrome (n=19, 12%) and no final aetiological diagnosis (n=3, 2%). Non-infectious causes were found in three travellers (2%). Common aetiological diagnoses were: TD (n=27, 17.5%), dengue fever (n=12, 8%), viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (n=11, 7%), chikungunya fever (n=10, 6.5%), laboratory-confirmed influenza (n=8, 5%), lobar pneumonia (n=8, 5%), acute urinary tract infection (n=7, 4.5%) and rickettsioses (n=6, 4%) (table 2) . Acute HIV was diagnosed in two febrile returned travellers, and Plasmodium vivax malaria in another two (table 2). Two cases of P. falciparum malaria were diagnosed among RAFT Clinic patients; however, both of these patients had been appropriately referred to and assessed by the inpatient Infectious Diseases consultation service, as per the algorithm, and then referred to RAFT by the Infectious Diseases team, rather than coming to RAFT off-protocol directly from the ED. All cases of chikungunya fever were acquired in the Caribbean or Central America: three in Jamaica, three in the Dominican Republic and one each in the British Virgin Islands, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, St. Lucia and St. Vincent.
