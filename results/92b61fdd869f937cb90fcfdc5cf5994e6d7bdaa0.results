All groups showed pyrexia following the viral challenges, which was more pronounced in group IV (Fig. 1) . Central nervous clinical signs were detected only in animals with ADV challenge. Macroscopic pulmonary consolidation was seen, in different proportions, in groups III and IV (Table 2) , although group IV, which had ADV challenge had more extensive lesions (2.3% average pneumonic lesions score for group III versus 13.7% for group IV). At the microscopic level, interstitial pneumonia, consisting of a mild mononuclear inflammatory infiltration and thickened alveolar septa, was seen in animals from groups II and III, but also in 3/4 of group IV. Catharralpurulent bronchopneumonia, consisting On day 5, groups III and IV were inoculated with Pasteurella multocidu. of large amounts of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in alveoli, was seen in groups III and IV. Meningo-encephalitis and purulent rhinitis were also seen in group IV pigs (Table 3) . In groups III and IV, isolation of Pasteurella multocidu was successful (Table 4 ). However, bacteria were only isolated from one of the animals in group III, as compared with group IV where all animals yielded positive cultures. Additionally, all animals from groups II and III seroconverted to PRRSV. The same was observed with animals from group IV all of them seroconverted to ADV.
