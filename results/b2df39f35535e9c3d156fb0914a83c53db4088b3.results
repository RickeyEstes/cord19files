In contrast, terrorist attacks perpetrated in Spain and Russia contribute to dislocate tourists from Portugal to other regions. All variables are significant at the 0.1% level. Even though there is evidence that all variables concerning tourists from Africa are significant at the 0.1% level, the coefficient direction changes in the case of Israel, Russia, Spain, and Greece. In fact, only terrorist attacks that took place in Israel and Greece affect negatively tourist arrivals from Africa in Portugal, while attacks perpetrated in other countries positively influence arrivals in the country. As far as tourists from America are concerned, it seems that attacks in Russia, Israel and Spain move them away from Portugal and force them to choose other destinations, while attacks in France, Germany and Greece bring those tourists to Portugal. Tourists from Oceania are negatively sensitive to attacks committed in Russia and Spain. A phenomenon that involves extremely sensitive reaction to terrorist attacks makes tourists replace a destination with other safer countries. Post estimation tests to the models revealed the absence of auto-correlation after using the Lagrange multiplier test, as null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation could not be rejected and as the null hypothesis under Jarque-Bera statistic of residuals' normality (StataCorp, 2013) could not be rejected either.
