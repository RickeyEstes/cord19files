A total of 1,926 samples of patients with respiratory symptoms were included in the present study. Ninety-three (4. 8%) samples were found to be positive for HBoV by PCR and subsequent sequencing. Other respiratory viruses detected during the study period were as follows: influenza A virus (IFA), 56 patients (2.9%); influenza B virus (IFB), 50 patients (2.6%); parainfluenza viruses (PIV), 142 patients (7.4%); respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 97 patients (5.0%); and adenovirus (ADV), 40 patients (2.1%). HBoV was more prevalent in men (73.1%) than in women (P = 0.005). HBoV was detected in patients ranging from 3 months to 65.6 yr (mean = 36.2 months, median = 19 months) with a peak prevalence between the ages of 6 and 12 months (8. 6%, 22/257). Children aged 5 yr or less constituted 92.5% (86/93) of the HBoV-positive patients (Table 1) . HBoV was detected in the samples obtained throughout the course of the study with the detection rate being the highest in June (16/129, 12.4%), followed by August (9/110, 8.2%) and May (13/162, 8.0%). From April to June 2006, 43% of the HBoV-positive cases were observed (Fig. 1) . All the 93 HBoV-positive cases detected by conventional PCR were also confirmed by real-time PCR performed us-KJLM ing the TaqMan probe. The viral load detected in the HBoVpositive samples by using real-time PCR was in the range of 1.3 × 10 3 -4.6 × 10 9 copies/mL (median, 1.82 × 10 5 copies/ mL). The HBoV-positive cases were categorized in 2 groups: low-viral-load group (viral load ≤ 1.0 × 10 6 copies/mL, N = 58) and high-viral-load group (viral load > 1.0 × 10 6 copies/ mL, N = 35) ( Table 1 ). The HBoV-positive patients aged less than 3 yr had a significantly higher viral load than that in the patients aged more than 3 yr (P = 0. 001). The other respiratory viruses found in 17 (18.3%) of the total HBoV-positive samples were as follows: IFA, 1 sample; IFB, 1 sample; PIV, 10 samples; RSV, 4 samples; and ADV, 1 sample. Most of the cases (88.2%, 15/17) belonged to the low-viral-load group. RSV was isolated from the remaining 2 samples with HBoV copy numbers of 1.09 × 10 6 copies/ mL and 2.65 × 10 8 copies/mL. Patients positive for HBoV alone had a higher viral load than that in the patients who were positive for both HBoV and another respiratory virus (median 3.78 × 10 5 copies/mL vs. 1.94 × 10 4 copies/mL, P = 0.014). A high-viral-load was almost exclusively seen in the HBoV-positive patients alone (94.3%, 33/35) (Fig. 2) . The high-viral-load group had a significantly higher pulse rate and respiratory rate than the corresponding rates in the low-viral-load group (P = 0.007 and P = 0.0231, respectively; Table 2 ). Although the duration of hospital stay was not significantly different between the 2 groups (Table 2), in cases of patients with less than 10 days of hospital stay, the highviral-load group had a longer hospital stay than the low-viral-load group did (5. Clinical examination of the HBoV-positive patients showed pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchitis, croup, asthma, sinusitis, and pharyngotonsilitis (Fig. 3) . HBoV was detected in 8.4% (N = 48) and 5.6% (N = 45) of the samples obtained from patients with and without pneumonia, respectively (N = 572 and 805, respectively; P = 0.049). However, no significant difference was observed in the viral load between
