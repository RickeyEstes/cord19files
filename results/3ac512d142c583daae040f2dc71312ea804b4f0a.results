A phylogenetic measure of the relative frequency of virus-host codivergence Our analysis considered a total of seven DNA and 12 RNA virus data sets that provided sufficient data to perform a quantitative co-phylogenetic analysis. Hence, the study relied heavily on specific selection criteria (see Materials and methods) that necessarily limited data availability. Despite these rigorous criteria, the majority of data sets encompassed a diverse collection of viruses and host species, and hence can be regarded as illustrative of the broad-scale frequency of co-divergence versus cross-species transmission. These data contained no evidence for recombination. To determine the prevalence of host switching between different viruses, we inferred family-level viral phylogenies and compared these to phylogenies of their hosts. Importantly, our analytical approach-which utilizes the nPH85 distance-provides a relative measure of phylogenetic congruence that is directly comparable between data sets that differ in size (i.e. different number of viruses and host species). Our method assumes that viruses that have codiverged with their hosts will share the same tree topology. In contrast, an increasing number of host jumping events should lead to greater phylogenetic incongruence. The reasoning behind this assumption is that there exists a very large number of possible phylogenetic tree topologies even for data sets with a few samples, such that similarities between a pair of virushost trees (i.e. congruence) are highly unlikely to arise by chance. Of course, phylogenetic events other than cross-species transmission might also lead to phylogenetic incongruence and we test the validity of this assumption later in the manuscript. Across the data set as a whole we found that all virus families displayed relatively large tree topological distances with nPH85 values of !0.6, suggesting that cross-species transmission is widespread, at least at the family-level (Fig 2; S3 Table) . While all families showed distances at the upper end of the scale, the Hepadnaviridae (double-stranded DNA) had the shortest distance (nPH85 = 0.6), indicating that this family experiences more frequent co-divergence than any other studied here. At the other end of the spectrum both the Rhabdoviridae and Picornaviridae (single-stranded RNA) displayed nPH85 > 0.97, indicative of frequent host switching and hence little evidence for virus-host co-divergence. We also investigated when the species jumping events occurred in the evolutionary history of the virus families. To do this, we determined whether phylogenetic incongruences tended to Cross-species transmission among viral families occur in deeper sections of the phylogeny or to more shallow nodes in the tree. Accordingly, we considered the number of nodes subtending clades in the host tree that are not present in the virus tree, a metric known as 'node depth'. Nodes that are deep correspond to clades that are more diverse, and often older, than those clades subtended by shallower nodes. For each pair of virus-host trees we calculated the depth of every node that differed within each virushost pair and divide each depth by the maximum node depth (Fig 3) . This normalized metric, which we term 'relative node depth', ranges between near 0 for phylogenetic incongruences at shallow nodes, and 1 for incongruences at deeper nodes. Most incongruences corresponded to shallow nodes, which is expected because there are naturally more shallow nodes than deep nodes in phylogenetic trees. However, that incongruences were found in both shallow and deep nodes suggests that co-divergence is relatively rare in these virus families, even over long evolutionary time-scales. Tanglegrams depicting pairs of rooted phylogenetic trees display the evolutionary relationship between each virus family and their host species (Fig 4; phylogenies with the individual tip labels visible are shown in S1 Fig) . Despite the obvious widespread occurrence of host jumping, a number of co-phylogenies reveal the occurrence of at least some co-divergence, as expected from the nPH85 distances. For example, the tanglegrams for the Hepadnaviridae and Poxviridae exhibit some clear matches with the evolutionary histories of their respective hosts. Most notably, their co-phylogenies show a clear segregation between distinct clades that are associated with a specific host type (mammals, birds, etc.). Conversely, the phylogenies of most RNA viruses appear to largely mismatch those of their hosts. Our fundamental assumption is that incongruences between virus and host topologies imply the occurrence of cross-species transmission. To test the validity of this assumption, we reconciled the viruses with the phylogenetic history of their hosts. By associating 'event costs' with host-jumping, as well as with lineage duplication and extinction events, we found the range of optimal co-phylogenetic solutions for each virus family ( Fig 5A) . As with the analysis of topological distances, this revealed that cross-species transmission was the most common evolutionary event in all virus families studied here, with co-divergence consistently less frequent (with the possible exception of the Hepadnaviridae-see below), and lineage duplication and extinction playing a much more minor role. We next reconstructed the history of these evolutionary events in detail in the Hepadnaviridae (i.e. the most co-divergent virus family). This revealed that under the most likely co-phylogenetic scenario the proportion of crossspecies transmission represents 0.57 of all events (i.e. co-divergence = 9 events; duplications = 0; extinction = 1; host-jumping = 13; Fig 5B) . Since the nPH85 distance for the hepadnavirus data set was 0.6, we suggest that our method generates results consistent with the reconciliation analysis. In addition, one important disadvantage of performing full reconciliation analysis is that co-phylogenetic methods such as that implemented in Jane [15] and Tarzan [16] are not straightforward since they offer many combinations of possible events and are difficult to compare between families, especially in cases with more than~50 viruses where there are many possible co-phylogenetic scenarios. Despite these limitations, our reconciliation analysis did reveal the possible causes of the topological incongruence between the virus and host phylogenies.
