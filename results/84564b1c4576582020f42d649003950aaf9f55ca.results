Results obtained by the three detection methods and their comparison are summarized in Table 1 HRSV-B) . Finally, GeneXpert assay showed a general sensitivity of 94.6% (91.2% for FLUAV, 91.1% for FLUBV and 100.0% for both HRSV groups). In addition, Allplex RP1 and ProFAST+ sensitivities were also compared by FLUAV subtype. Whereas Allplex RP1 showed a sensitivity of 91.5% and 88.4% for FLUAV-H1pdm09 and FLUAV-H3 respectively, ProFAST+ assay showed sensitivities of 100.0% for both targets. Regarding the specificity, the three assays showed values of 100.0%. The PPV was 100.0% for the three assays, while the NPV were 83.7%, 73.3% and 85.6% for Allplex RP1, Prodesse and GeneXpert, respectively. Moreover, 60 samples showed invalid results for at least one assay (Allplex RP1: 46 invalid samples, Prodesse: 8 invalid samples and GeneXpert: 10 invalid samples), which could also not be re-tested due to insufficient sample volume, and therefore were not finally included in the statistical analysis. Regarding the repeatability analysis, variance coefficient (CV) ranges from a minimum of 1.8 to a maximum of 11.2 (Table 2) .
