Internal control construction -We developed a competitive internal control to be used in assays to detect the nucleic acid from HCV, based on the MS2 bacteriophage. This IC could also be used as non-competitive control in any RNA virus detection test. The MS2 bacteriophage genome was inserted in pET47b(+) plasmid, generating pET47b(+)-MS2. pET47b(+)-MS2-mHCV was constructed after the insertion of a mutated HCV sequence into a unique BamHI site (within the replicase gene of MS2 genome) of pET47b(+)-MS2. All the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. An overview of the strategy is shown in Fig. 2 . Both pET47b(+)-MS2 and pET47b(+)-MS2-mHCV could generate MS2-like particles through the synthesis of MS2 genome by T7 RNA polymerase. pET47b(+)-MS2-mHCV generated particles whose genome harbored 144 nt of a HCV sequence in the middle of the replicase gene, and as consequence a non-functional enzyme was produced, blocking replication of the genome. From now on, these mutant bacteriophage particles will be referred to as MS2-like IC and MS2-mHCV IC, respectively. One step real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was developed and optimised for each control. The RNA was extracted from ten-fold dilutions of MS2-like and MS2-mHCV particles stocks. The nucleic acid from MS2-like IC was amplified using primers MS2-F and MS2-R and probe MS2-P (Fig. 3A) . The mean PCR efficiency was 92%. The RNA from MS2-mHCV particles was amplified using primers HCV-F and HCV-R1 and the probe mHCV-P (Fig. 3B) . This reaction had a mean efficiency of 104%. Despite the amplification of several quantities being carried out over eight logs, the test linearity comprised six logs for both ICs. MS2-mHCV IC could not be quantified by plating assays, since it invades but does not replicate and lyse the bacterial cell; therefore, we decided to quantify it by real-time PCR compared with the MS2-like curves previously quantified. RNA was extracted from three samples of MS2-mHCV IC and subjected to real-time PCR with primers MS2-F and MS2-R and the probe MS2-P, along with the standard curve that comprised 10-fold serial dilutions of MS2-like RNA. The MS2-like was titled by plating assays with 7,5 x 10 4 PFU/mL and the MS2-mHCV IC with 2,1 x 10 5 PFU-eq. Non-competitive internal control for the HCV detection reaction -The utility of MS2-like particles as a non-competitive ICs was evaluated in a one-step format multiplex real-time RT-PCR for HCV detection. The use of a set of primers and probes for amplification of the MS2 genome makes these MS2-like particles useful as ICs in assays for any RNA virus. The HCV primers were designed to amplify the region between positions 130 and 201 (GenBank reference sequence AF009606.1), which is conserved among the different genotypes (Duarte et al. 2010 ). The MS2-like particles were tested as a non-competitive internal control with the same primer pair and probe used in the singleplex reaction, plus the primers and probe to detect HCV (Table I) . The sample PHW804-01 from the HCV RNA Linearity Panel was diluted to 8.25 x 10 5 UI/mL and was spiked with 5 mL MS2-like IC (1, 10 -1 , 10 -2 PFU). The RNA from HCV and MS2-like IC was extracted and amplified in a multiplex real-time PCR (Fig. 4A) . The HCV amplification was detected at C T s 31 to 33, whereas the MS2-like was in C T s 26, 29 and 34 to 37 (average 35). The experiments indicated that the IC amplification was reproducible, with negligible interference in HCV detection, independently of the amount of MS2-like IC. Therefore, we opted to use 1.0 × 10 -1 PFU of MS2-like IC in subsequent tests. Competitive IC for the HCV detection reaction -The MS2-mHCV was evaluated as a competitive IC in a onestep real-time PCR for HCV detection. The same HCV region targeted for HCV detection was inserted into MS2-mHCV with some mutated bases in relation to the wild-type (WT) sequence. The multiplex PCR required only one HCV primer pair and two probes to discriminate between the WT and the mutated sequence. The probes for HCV or MS2-mHCV IC were designed against positions 149 to 169 of the reference sequence (Table I) . PHW804-01 at 8.25 x 10 5 UI/mL was used in the multiplex reaction with 1, 10 -1 , 10 -2 PFU-eq of MS2-mH-CV IC (Fig. 4B ). All quantities of MS2-mHCV IC tested had a suitable amplification curve (C T 28 to 34), despite the greater variability of 10 -2 PFU-eq amplification. The multiplex reaction with the different amounts of competitive IC of MS2-mHCV did not affect the amplification of HCV. In subsequent tests, we added 10 -2 PFU-eq of MS2-mHCV IC to each sample. Fig. 4 shows that the HCV C T values in the multiplex reaction were very close, regardless of whether the IC was competitive or non-competitive. The evaluation of the multiplex HCV/IC real-time PCR was extended by adding MS2-like IC (10 -1 PFU) and MS2-mHCV IC (10 -2 PFU-eq) to HCV Panel samples with 2.5 × 10 6 , 2.5 × 10 5 , 2.5 × 10 4 , 2.5 × 10 3 , 2.5 × 10 2 and 2.5 × 10 UI/mL. MS2-mHCV IC were detected in all samples at a mean C T of 30.9. The mean C T for MS2like IC was 26.7. From 2.5 x 10 6 to 2.5 x 10³, the HCV amplification curves were similar among the reactions using the competitive and non-competitive IC. These values are reported in Table II and the plots of the amplification images are shown in Supplementary data, Figure. Non-competitive IC for the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) detection reaction -In addition, the MS2-like particles were evaluated as a non-competitive IC in a onestep format multiplex real-time PCR for HIV detection, demonstrating that these controls can be used in assays for other RNA virus. Primers and the probe to amplify the IC were the same as in the HCV/MS2-like multiplex reaction.
