To further demonstrate that the base distribution in these gene sequences are non-random, and generally true for conserved gene sequences, we have generated graphical representations of several conserved genes, a selection of which are shown in Fig. 4 . Plots of several alpha globin genes are included here to show that there is shape similarity between the same genes from different species indicating that entire gene sequences inclusive of introns and exons have close similarities. This can also be seen in the plots of several histones, tubulins and heat shock proteins, of which some representative samples are given in Figs. 4 and 5. With our observation that the sequences of the conserved genes, both intronless and with-introns, have close similarities, we can start to enquire whether these sequences have any discernible patterns. We notice that the general nature of the DNA walks on the 2D representation as per the Nandy prescription [11] shown in the above figures is directional and curvilinear. A simple 2 nd degree polynomial produces reasonable fits. A selection of the plots with the trendlines is shown in Fig. 6 and 7 corresponding to the sequences shown in the previous two figures. A list of the details of the fits and statistics are given in Table 1 . While this nature of the base distributions is found across many different sequences of eukaryotic genes, it is also very much evident in the case of viral sequences like the H5N1 neuraminidase which are known to mutate very rapidly; other plots from a sample of over 600 sequences of the H5N1 neuraminidase show similar quadratic forms. Interestingly, plots of the wheat, maize and chicken histone H4 genes, which are also intronless genes, can also be fitted by polynomials of degree 2, similar to the case of the viral genes. Chicken beta globin gene with intron sequences that are quite different compared to the mammalian genes plot in the first quadrant, but it also can be fit by a quadratic polynomial. This is however not true of all gene sequences. The mouse beta globin gene sequence representation in the 2D framework gives a very poor fit for the quadratic function (R 2 = 0.06) but much better statistics with a cubic polynomial (R 2 = 0.53) ( Table 1) ; the human delta globin gene also shows very good statistics when fitted with a cubic polynomial (R 2 = 0.98). Some sequences where significantly large segments are at variance with the overall pattern too cannot be put into such slots. The rat myosin heavy chain gene sequence where the intron sequences have been hypothesized to have grown through accretion of large fragments [30] , for example, presents a highly compact form on the 2D plot [15] and cannot be fit by the simple polynomials we have used so far. However, sufficiently large numbers of sequences are seen to follow the apparent quadratic relationship with good statistics that it is of interest to try to understand the underlying pattern.
