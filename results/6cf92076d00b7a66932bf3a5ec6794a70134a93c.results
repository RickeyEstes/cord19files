A typical growth curve of DBT cells on the dextran made Cytodex I microcarriers is shown in Fig. 1 . Cells multiplied rapidly for the first 6 days before reaching a plateau. A cell concentration of 3 X lo6 cells/ml was generally obtained in 7 days. Cell infection was always performed on confluent beads which were obtained 6 or 7 days after seeding. The morphological aspect of the cells on microcarriers is shown in Fig. 2 . Confluent beads showed elongated cells covering all of the available surface on the microcarriers ( Fig. 2A, B) . Infected cells showed complete cytopathic effect (syncytia) within 18 hrs p-i. and detached completely from the microcarriers (Fig. 2C, D) . Infectious virus released from DBT cells grown on microcarriers was quantitated by plaque assay and the titer compared to what was obtained from cells grown on culture dishes. The results are shown in Table 1 . There was no statistically significant difference in the release of infectious virus per cell. Moreover, a single small 250 ml flask of infected cells on microcarriers released as many infectious virions as eleven 150 cm2 dishes. When virus was concentrated and purified from the growth medium of infected DBT cells on microcarriers, similar recoveries of infectivity were observed as with virus obtained from cells grown on culture dishes (Table 2) . Moreover, the appearance of purified coronavirus in the electron microscope was indistinguishable (Fig. 3) .
