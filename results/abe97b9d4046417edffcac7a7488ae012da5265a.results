Samples from 14 camels were obtained on Oct 17, 2013 (table, fi gure 1). Nose swab specimens from fi ve camels were positive for all three assays (upE, N gene, and ORF1a), one sample reacted in two assays, and fi ve camels tested positive in only one RT-PCR assay. Subsequently, all samples were subjected to a PCR assay targeting the spike gene of MERS-CoV (nucleotides 22449-22806) to obtain a fragment for sequencing as defi nitive confi rmation. Such sequencing confi rmed the presence of sequences specifi c to MERS-CoV in three camels. Alignment of these partial spike gene sequences with known human MERS-CoV sequences, including those determined from the two related human cases and some other human MERS-CoV isolates such as Hafr-Al-Batin_1_2013 (KF600628) and Riyadh_3_2013 (KF600613), showed 100% identity, but the sequences diff ered from EMC MERS-CoV, which is used routinely in the Erasmus MC laboratory, by one nucleotide. The three camel MERS-CoV sequences obtained by this approach were identical. Virus culture attempts were not successful, although one sample tested for camel 7 yielded a positive RT-PCR of the supernatant (table) and staining of the fi xed virus-infected cells (data not shown). Further passage of the virus on Vero cells, however, was not successful. In addition, serum from camel 9 showed low levels of MERS-CoV as determined by RT-PCR, and all other camel sera tested negative (data not shown). Rectal swabs and faecal materials were negative for MERS-CoV when tested for reactivity in the upE and N gene RT-PCRs. Further sequencing of the virus from camel 5 with primers specifi c to MERS-CoV rendered six diff erent fragments covering 4·2 kb across the MERS-CoV genome (fi gure 1). Fragments 1 (nucleotides 6708-7459), 2 (8095-9034), and 3 (10073-10658) were located in ORF1a, fragment 4 (18792-19584) in ORF1b, fragment 5 (22449-22806) in the spike gene, and fragment 6 (26074-26846) in ORF4b. The sequences obtained from the human cases from the same farm diff ered by one nucleotide diff erence in ORF1a and one in ORF4b. The MERS-CoV EMC isolate diff ers by eight nucleotides from the camel MERS-CoV in ORF1a. Alignment of the divergent 940 nucleotide ORF1a fragment (data not shown) and a 4·2 kb concatenated sequence fragment was used for PhyML phylogenetic analysis. The camel MERS-CoV clustered with viral sequences obtained from the two human cases related to the farm and with a sequence from Hafr-Al-Batin as the next closest relative (fi gure 1). Less stringent methods of analysis do show limited bootstrap support (data not shown), in line with relatively limited sequence variation within this fragment. All camel sera were positive in the immunofl uorescence assay when tested in a 1/200 dilution (fi gure 2). When serum samples from camels were tested at diff erent dilutions on the microarray, we noted reactivity with MERS-CoV antigen, but not the SARS-CoV antigen. Reactivity to human coronavirus OC43 antigen, as a proxy to betacoronavirus, varied between negative (less than the cutoff value of 4000) and saturating signals (data not shown). Consistent with the array data, all serum samples had MERS-CoV neutralising capacity, with titres varying between 160 and 5120 (fi gure 2). We also noted a strong correlation between microarray titres and virus neutralising antibody titres (fi gure 2). The two camels with the highest MERS-CoV load in the swabs as shown by TaqMan assay (camels 5 and 7) had a relatively low serum neutralisation titre of 640.
