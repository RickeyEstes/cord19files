We next examined whether the frequency distributions of L-SIGN neck region genotypes and alleles were significantly different between the HCV-infected and resolved groups. Logistic regression analysis of the association of genotype with outcome demonstrated that the 7/4 genotype was the only genotype significantly associated with resolution of HCV (p 0.022, OR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.07-0.82) ( Table 2 ). The 7/ 4 genotype frequency was over-represented in the resolved group (14.3%) as compared with the chronic patients (4%) (p 0.015) ( Table 3) . A previous study showed that the medium length 6-or 7tandem repeats form a rigid neck region that projects the CRDs away from the membrane, ensuring strong multivalent adhesion to the target membrane, thus promoting the access to pathogens [23] . Therefore, we grouped these alleles and the frequency of 6/6 + 7/6 + 7/7 genotypes as higher in the chronic group (82/150, 54.7%) than the spontaneous resolvers (24/61, 39.3%) (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 0.97-3.57, p 0.04) ( Table 2) . As for allelic frequencies, we found that allele 4 was associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV infection (OR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.12-0.74). Analysis between spontaneous clearance group with allele 4 and chronic patients group showed that this allele is most prevalent in the spontaneous subjects (11.1% vs. 3.7%, respectively, p 0.005). In order to explore the contribution of L-SIGN neck region polymorphism to HCV replication and necroinflammatory activity, we analysed viral loads in infected cases according to the various L-SIGN alleles (Fig. 1a) . Patients carrying allele 4had lower viral loads (median = 121 266 UI/mL) than patients with allele 5-(median = 862 317 UI/mL) (p 0.001), allele 6-(median = 842 000 UI/mL) (p 0.021) and allele 7-(median = 785 324 UI/mL) (p 0.048). In contrast, no significant correlation was found between L-SIGN alleles and mean ALT (Fig. 1b,  p >0 .05) or AST levels (Fig. 1c, p >0.05) . To test the association between the L-SIGN variants and liver damage, we genotyped this polymorphism in 40 patients with cirrhosis then compared them with 109 healthy subjects. The distribution of allelic frequencies was not significant between patients and healthy subjects (Fig. 1d, p >0.05) . In addition, when chronic HCV patients were stratified by their viral genotypes, the frequencies of L-SIGN genotypes were not different between patients with genotype 1 (G-1) and patients with genotype 2 (G-2) (Fig. 2a) . Finally, we checked the response of patients with shorter and longer tandem repeat to PegIFN-a plus RBV treatment. We analysed this polymorphism with viral clearance after treatment in patients infected with genotype 1b. Frequencies of 4-, 5-, 6-and 7-were 4%, 12%, 48% and 35% in In nonresponders group and were 8%, 15%, 46% and 31% in sustained virological response (SVR) group, respectively (p >0.05) (Fig. 2b) . Given that L-SIGN and IL28B genes are located on chromosome 19, we hypothesized that clearance could be detected when favourable genotypes are combined in a given subject. Consequently, statistical gene-gene interactions between the L-SIGN and IL28B polymorphisms were examined (Table 3) . We observed that cleared subjects carrying the 7/4 genotype had a higher frequency of the IL28B-CC genotype than chronic patients (12.7% vs. 2%, p 0.003). Further, a significant spontaneous clearance of HCV infection among L-SIGN 7/4 and IL28B-CC genotype carriers with OR of 0.21 (95% CI = 0.04- 1.05, p 0.048) was observed, suggesting a possible link between L-SIGN and IL28B genotypes in clearance of the virus. Finally, to check the role of L-SIGN genotype 7/4 in the prevalence of spontaneous HCV clearance, we stratified subjects according to L-SIGN-7/4 and IL28B-CC genotypes (Fig. 2c) . The result indicated that the prevalence of spontaneous clearance is higher (52.4%) among individuals with the CC genotype without 7/4, followed by those carrying both CC and 7/4 genotypes (12.7%).
