In section 'method', Predicting RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots is implemented using the PRSA algorithm. In the following, we first present the datasets, the exiting methods and accuracy measures we use for the evaluation of the algorithm, then the prediction performance of the PRSA algorithm is demonstrated by comparative experiments.
