3.1. Development of a two-step TaqMan real time PCR assay to measure expression of ferret immune mediator and housekeeping genes Cytokine, chemokine and housekeeping genes were amplified from total mRNA generated from cultures of ferret lymph node cells using primers targeting conserved regions of each gene. All Table 3 Comparison of the sensitivity of TaqMan and SYBR Green real time PCR assays. All reactions were performed with the same plasmid standard, except in cases where the appropriate plasmid standard encompassing both primer sets was not available, and a cDNA sample was used instead. The same samples were used to compare the TaqMan assays in this study with either previously published TaqMan assays or previously published SYBR Green assays for an individual gene. genes cloned in this study were sequenced and the sequences run in BLASTn whereby they matched other published and predicted sequences for the corresponding ferret gene on GenBank, especially those derived from the ferret genome project (Di Palma et al., 2013) ( Table 2) . Sequences generated in this study were also translated and all sequences aligned to known sequences of the corresponding proteins from other species in GenBank (data not shown). All primer/probe sets for the TaqMan real time PCR assay (Table 1) were tested to ensure specificity and optimum efficiency using plasmid DNA standards. The absence of non-specific amplicons was verified for all primer/probe sets (Fig. 1A) . The % efficiency of each primer/probe set was consistent and between 94 and 103% which is equivalent to an efficiency of 1.94-2.03 (Fig. 1B) , indicating that the template doubled after each cycle during exponential amplification. The correlation co-efficient for all samples was between 0.980 and 0.999 (data not shown). The sensitivity of the primer/probe sets for each gene was consistent across the different TaqMan assays, with all genes detected down to 0.0001 pg DNA plasmid (average 25.2 RNA copies), except GAPDH, which was detected down to 0.00001 pg DNA (2.5 RNA copies) ( Table 3 ). The limits of detection were consistent for previously published TaqMan primer/probes sets (Nakata et al., 2009) (Table 3) . There was no change in the sensitivity of the assay when primer/probes were mixed in the indicated duplex real time PCR reactions (Fig. 1C) , or when plasmid samples were prepared in pools (Fig. 1D) , or a combination of both duplex real time PCR reactions and sample pools (Fig. 1E) , except for L32, which was less sensitive when assayed with other genes (Fig. 1E) .
