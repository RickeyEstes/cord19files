BnoV detection and co-infections. 20 .4% (43/211) of the diarrheic samples were detected as BNoVpositive by RT-PCR, and 14 of the 25 farms sampled in five provinces were positive for BNoV (Fig. 1) . Of the 43 BNoV-positive diarrheic samples, 38 were co-infected with bovine rotavirus (BRV), Bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and/or Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) ( Table 1 ). The co-infected of distinct BNoV genotype in each region was shown in Supplementary Table 3 . Phylogenetic analyses of RdRp, VP1, and VP2 genes. All 43 RdRp fragments were sequenced and the results confirmed that all the fragments belonged to BNoV. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on the RdRp fragments indicated that 38 of the strains from this study clustered in GIII.2 and five clustered in GIII.1 (Fig. 2a) . Among the 38 GIII.2 strains, 33 clustered on a large branch with two Egyptian strains (GenBank accession numbers KX268308 and KX268306), and the remaining five strains clustered on an independent branch. Twenty-six fragments of VP1 (505 bp) from seven BNoV-positive farms across five provinces were successfully sequenced. A neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree based on all the available sequences of VP1 that were â‰¥505 bp indicated that 23 of the BNoV strains from this study clustered with GIII.2, one strain clustered with GIII.1, and the remaining two strains clustered on a unique branch. All 23 GIII.2 strains clustered on an independent branch of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2b) and shared 92.1-100% nucleotides (nt) identity (97.6-100% aa identity) with each other, and 86-94.3% nt identity (95.3-100% aa identity) with the GIII.2 strains in the GenBank database. The strain that clustered with GIII. 1
