During the epidemic, 5,327 Chinese were diagnosed as SARS probable cases. Among them, 349 died from the disease and the rest recovered, which accounted for the case fatality of 6.55%. The average APIs ranged from 52 to 126 for different regions during April and May 2003. Ecologic analysis was conducted among 5 regions with 100 or more SARS cases (Guangdong, Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin) to explore the relationship between air pollution and SARS case fatality. Inner Mongolia, which had 282 probable cases, was excluded from the analysis due to poor data quality reported by the Chinese Center for Disease Control. Table 1) We also studied the effect of long-term average air pollution before SARS epidemic on SARS fatality. According to the air pollution data between June 2000 and October 2002, 67 out of 1,572 patients from regions with low APIs died from SARS. While, 35 out of 363 from regions with moderate APIs and 247 out of 3,392 from regions with high APIs died from SARS, respectively. The corresponding fatalities were 4.26%, 9.64% and 7.28%, respectively. The risk ratios comparing high and moderate API group to low API group were 1.71 (95%CI: 1.34-3.33) and 2.26 (95%CI: 1.53-3.35), respectively. The results showed that long-term exposure to air pollution was positively associated with SARS case fatality, even though there was no apparent trend. (See Table 2 )
