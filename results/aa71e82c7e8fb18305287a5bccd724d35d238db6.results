Infants are at high risk for DHF/DSS. Figure 1 provides data from the only published study to estimate age-specific dengue hospitalization rates for the Bangkok metropolitan area. In 1964, 17/1,000 seven-month-old infants, more than 1% of the population that age, were hospitalized for DHF/DSS (17) . This modal rate was two times higher than the 1964 modal hospitalization rate for children (age 4 years, data not shown) in Bangkok during the same year (17 Figure 2 ). Among infants hospitalized at Bangkok Children's Hospital, the distribution of World Health Organization grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 16.4, 56.2, 23.9, and 3.0%, respectively. Only 2 of 220 infants whose serum samples were tested had a secondary-type antibody response, 97.5% had primary infections. DENV was isolated from 114 (nearly 50%) of Thai infants; DENV types 1, 2, 3, 4 were recovered from 34, 23, 56, and 1 infant, respectively. Nineteen Myanmar infants were serologically confirmed as having a recent primary infection; seven, mostly infants >10 months of age, had secondary-type dengue HAI-antibody responses. The distribution by age of DHF/DSS infants in all four countries presents a similar pattern: few cases were observed in infants younger than 3 months, and the largest numbers observed were in infants 6-8 months old. Later in the first year, admissions declined nearly to baseline in Thailand and Indonesia. In Yangon, the decline in admissions reversed at age 10 months and increased. In Yangon, DHF hospitalizations continued to increase during the second year of life ( Figure 3 ). In Ho Chi Minh City, cases in 11-month-olds declined, but not quite to the baseline. Children hospitalized with DHF/DSS in Bangkok show the classical bimodal curve: relatively few cases in children 12-24 months of age and a modal age later in life, in this case at 8 years of age (Figure 4 ). By contrast, this bimodal distribution is not present in Yangon. DHF/DSS occurs commonly in 12to 24-month-old children, and the modal age at admission is 4 years (Figure 3 ).
