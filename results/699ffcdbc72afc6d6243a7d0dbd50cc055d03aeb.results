Bat flies were found on six of nine pteropodid bats trapped at the edge of Kibale National Park, western Uganda, in 2010. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of bat flies yielded 0.11 × 10 6 to 1.59 × 10 6 reads per sample. After quality trimming, rhabdovirus-like sequences were detected in five bat flies, each from a different bat. These sequences mapped with low similarity to conserved regions of rhabdovirus genomes (order Mononegavirales, family Rhabdoviridae). De novo assembly yielded a contiguous sequence of 10,843 nt in one bat fly sample (MPK004), with five open reading frames matching the canonical rhabdovirus genome organization ( Fig. 1) 10 . Subsequent analysis of bat fly reads mapped 448 to 206,726 individual reads to this sequence, yielding coding-complete genomes in three other bat fly samples. Rhabdovirus coding genome sequences from bat flies of individual bats were 99.9% and 99.8% similar at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid levels, respectively. Viral read frequencies in the five positive bat fly samples ranged from 8,611 to 262,258 per million, with coverage ranging from 5-fold to 3,632-fold. Sequencing of sera from the bats on which the bat flies were found yielded 1.17 × 10 6 to 2.97 × 10 6 reads per sample, but no reads mapped to the detected rhabdovirus genome. Application of this method at this sequencing depth is approximately as sensitive as real-time quantitative PCR 11 ; therefore, bat sera could confidently be classified as negative for the virus. For further confirmation, however, we also tested all bat sera by PCR, and results were congruent with NGS results (i.e., all bat sera tested negative for the new rhabdovirus). Oral and urogenital swab samples from all bats also tested negative for the new rhabdovirus by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis ( Fig. 2A ; Supplementary Table S1 ) indicates the rhabdovirus to be a new member of the recently established genus Ledantevirus 12, 13 . We named this virus Kanyawara virus (KYAV) after the village closest to the roost from which the bats were sampled. Sequence similarity between KYAV and other ledanteviruses based on concatenated, codon-based alignments of the canonical N, P, G, M, and L genes ranged from 62.4% (Mount Elgon bat virus) to 47.6% (Y ngjiā tick virus 2) at the nucleotide level and from 59.3% (Mount Elgon bat virus) to 38.7% (Kern Canyon virus) at the deduced amino acid level, respectively. KYAV fulfills four of the five criteria of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) Rhabdoviridae Study Group for classification in the genus Ledantevirus: A) the deduced amino acid sequence of the KYAV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) diverges >7% from that of other ledanteviruses (KYAV:Mount Elgon bat virus = 35.2%); B) the deduced amino acid sequence of the KYAV glycoprotein (G) diverges 15% from that of other ledanteviruses (KYAV:Mount Elgon bat virus = 49.0%); C) KYAV has the same genome organization as other ledanteviruses (Fig. 1) ; and E) KYAV occupies a different ecological niche than other ledanteviruses. Criterium D ("can be distinguished in serological tests") could not be evaluated due to the absence of a replicating KYAV isolate, but the high divergence of the sequence of KYAV G, the only ledantevirion surface protein, strongly suggests that KYAV is also serologically distinct 14 . Table S2 ). Figure 3 shows average CpG depletion by virus group and gene. CpG depletion was least pronounced for the insect-only sigmaviruses 15, 16 , but more pronounced in the mammal-specific lyssaviruses 17, 18 . These CpG variation patterns were generally consistent across the five canonical rhabdovirus genes N, P, G, M, and L within each virus group (Fig. 3 Table S2 ). Variation in CpG frequency also differed significantly among rhabdovirus groups (Levine's W statistic = 3.29; 6 degrees of freedom; P = 0.008). The coefficient of variation in CpG depletion was lowest for sigmaviruses and lyssaviruses and notably higher for the other virus groups (Fig. 3) . Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences from the collected bat flies revealed them to be members of the nycteribiid subfamily Cyclopodiinae, representing a putative new species of the genus Dipseliopoda. These sequences are approximately as divergent from bat flies of the most closely related cyclopodiine bat flies (D. biannulatus) as are the cyclopdiine bat flies of the species Eucampsiopoda inermis and E. sundaica (Fig. 2B) . Phylogenetic analyses of the sampled bats revealed them to be members of a putative new species, clustering as an outgroup to Angolan soft-furred bats (Myonycteris angolensis) and approximately as divergent from those bats as are bats of other species pairs within the genus Myonycteris (Fig. 2C ).
