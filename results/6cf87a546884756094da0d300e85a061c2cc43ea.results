Investigations into the sources of exposure indicate a history of contact with person from Hubei or family clusters in each case. There were 9 males (35%) and 17 females (65%), with an average age of 6.9 (0.7) years, ranging from 1 to 13 years (table 1). None of the above children had underlying diseases such as congenital diseases, dysplasia, diabetes, etc. Because some children cannot expresss independently, the clinical symptoms were mainly objective symptoms. Most patients had fever and cough at admission. About one-third of the patients had no clear symptoms, and other symptoms included vomiting, diarrhea, and rhinorrhoea (table 1). According to the standard,8 cases(31%) were mild and 18(69%) were ordinary. No severe complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI) occurred in the cases. Laboratory results revealed that most of the blood routine showed normal or decreased white blood cell counts, lymphocytes generally increased, and hemoglobin .

There were no significant abnormalities in coagulation function. In terms of biochemistry, Alanine transaminase (ALT) combine with glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST) increased in two cases(8%),ALT or AST increased in one case(4%).In addition, all the above cases had not exceed 50% of the normal high value. Most of the myocardial enzymes(myoglobin, troponin, kinase, creatine kinase) were not abnormal, with only a significant increase in LDH(46%). In the field of inflammatory mediators (table 2) , procalcitonin was normal, and 5(19%) patients had elevated C-reative protein. 19 patients were tested for interleukin-6 and only one had an increase. T-lymphocyte subset analysis showed no abnormalities in CD3+CD4+/CD3+CD8+.Humoral immunity showed that IgA, IgG, and C3c were partially reduced (table 2) , and IgM and C4 were normal. According to chest X-ray and chest CT examination, 8 patients(31%) had no pulmonary infiltration. There were 11 cases(42%) of lateral pulmonary infiltration and 7 cases(27%) of bilateral pulmonary infiltration. All patients were treated in isolation. Medicines for treating COVID-19 include oseltamivir, ribavirin, interferon, kaletra and traditional Chinese medicine.4 patients (15%) were treated with interferon alone and 1 patient (4%) was treated with kaletra alone.26 patients discharge (13.6Â±1.03 days on average) or improvement after treatment.
