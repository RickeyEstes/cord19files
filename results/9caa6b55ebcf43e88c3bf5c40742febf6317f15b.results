A total of 259 episodes of ILI occurred in 194 patients. Abnormal chest radiographs were present in 128 episodes. All except one required hospitalization. Two episodes were excluded because of missing data. Of the remaining 125 episodes, bacteria were isolated only in the urine samples of 17 episodes, which were further excluded. Finally, 108 episodes of NHAP in 90 patients were included in this study. Clinical characteristics and investigation results of the study population are listed in Table 1 .
