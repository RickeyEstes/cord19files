This questionnaire was published online, and 367 responses were recorded in the system. The actual response rate could not be calculated because the questionnaire was electronically advertised, and all employees of the hospital may have been exposed to the study. The responders covered a wide range of hospital professions. The relative frequencies of the occupations are presented in Table 1 . We received responses from different age groups and both genders, as shown below in Tables 2 and 3 . Regarding work and employment status, we received responses from a variety of groups, as presented in Tables 4 and 5 . Answers to three negatively worded questions were mirrored with their positive values. These questions involved the adverse effect of dependency on public transportation and concerns about personal and family health on work attendance in the event of pandemic flu. Regarding the outlier detection methods, the threshold level for the standardized residual was Â±3.3. The degree of freedom for the Mahalanobis Distance test was 29, which resulted in a critical value of 58.3 for the alpha level of 0.001. Using these outlier detection methods, 19 cases (5.17%) were identified as outliers and were excluded from the final analysis. Analysis of the responses showed a different range of missing data in the survey questions, as presented in Table 6 . By applying the EMA method to the data, the missing data were calculated. Because of the non-normal distribution of the data, Student's t distribution was used in this calculation instead of the normal distribution likelihood function. A maximum of 25 iterations was assigned for this algorithm. The missing values were predicted by this method. The residual scatterplot shows a roughly rectangular shape, which supports the homoscedasticity of the results (Fig. 1) . The normal P-P plot of regression standardized residual (Fig. 2) shows a reasonably straight diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right, which supports the linearity of the pilot data obtained by this questionnaire. The above analysis shows the homogeneity of variance between the variables measured in the questionnaire. This homogeneity is required to measure the correlation between the variables. Evaluating the correlation between the independent (fact) question items and the dependent (measure) variables showed a correlation above 0.3. This correlation assures that there are no irrelevant independent variables in the questionnaire. The effect of identifying flu cases in London or single or multiple cases in the trust on the probability of work absence showed a high multicollinearity. Furthermore, the items ''Expect rapid access to diagnosis'' and ''Expect rapid access to treatment'' were highly correlated. The other two correlated question items were ''Expectation of personal protection equipment for traveling to work on public transport'' and ''Dependency on public transport for ability to come to work''. The existence of multicollinearity in the questionnaire variables can falsely overfit the regression models that are developed using the data collected with that questionnaire. Cronbach's alpha test was used to measure the reliability of the questionnaire, and the initial result of this test was 0.507. This result is below the minimum acceptable value (0.7). Further evaluation of the questions showed that the items ''Years of working in the current job'', ''Years of working in National Health Service (NHS)'' and ''Working time if part-time'' caused this low reliability. The result of the same test without these question items increased the reliability to 0.712.
