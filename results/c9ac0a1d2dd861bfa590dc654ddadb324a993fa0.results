A total of 2810 patients with acute pancreatitis (1108 pre-and 1702 post-global budget) were recruited in this study. The mean ages of subjects before and after global budgeting were 47.75 ± 0.47 years and 50.83 ± 0.42 years, respectively. In the pre-budget group, 74% of the subjects were men and in the post-budget group, 75% of the subjects were men. The mean income state index before implementation of the global budgeting system was 1.79 ± 0.05 and that after adoption of the system was 1.74 ± 0.04. The mean Charlson Comorbidity Index before global budgeting was 0.75 ± 0.04 and that after introduction of the system was 1.00 ± 0.03. There were significant differences in age (P < .001), income state index (P = .04), and Charlson Comorbidity Index (P < .001) before and after the global budgeting system went into effect. There was no significant difference in male to female ratio before and after adoption of the global budget system (P = .10) ( Table 2) . The mean LOS before implementation of the global budget system was 7.34 ± 0.22 days and that after the system went into effect was 7.82 ± 0.22 days. The definitions of diagnostic cost, therapy costand drug cost were costs of laboratory diagnostic tests, treatment for acute pancreatitis, and medicines. The mean diagnostic costs (in NT$) before and after global budgeting were NT$ 2085.70 ± 64.42 and NT$ 2875.96 ± 86.96, respectively. The mean drug costs before and after implementation of the global budget system were NT$ 6363.78 ± 547.30 and NT$ 8723.39 ± 665.60, respectively. The mean therapy costs before and after the global budget were NT$ 1074.26 ± 137.10 and NT$ 3412.97 ± 320.40, respectively. The mean total costs before and after adoption of global budgeting were NT$ 28,290.66 ± 1576.32 and NT$ 42,341.83 ± 2285.23, respectively. The mean 3-day re-visit rate to the ED decreased from 9.9 ± 0.9% at baseline to 7.2 ± 0.6% after implementation of the global budget system. The mean 14-day re-admission rates before and after the global budget went into effect were 11.6 ± 1.0% and 7.9 ± 0.7%. Table 1 National health insurance premium level.
