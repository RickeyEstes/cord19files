Of the 130,774 adults, 12.3% (16,975) were HCP. Of those who worked within the healthcare setting, 41.3% had no direct patient contact and 58.7% had direct patient contact. Overall, H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccination coverage were 34.1%, 52.4%, and 58.0%, respectively, which were higher than those for non-HCP (19.1%, 34.9%, and 40.3%, respectively). Across the majority of subgroups, H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccination coverage were higher among HCP compared with non-HCP (Table 1) . H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccination coverage among HCP with direct patient contact were 38.1%, 55.8%, and 61.6%, respectively (data not shown), which were signifıcantly higher than those for HCP. In univariate analysis, among HCP, H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccination coverage were lower for non-Hispanic blacks (21.7%, 39.4%, and 43.9%, respectively) and Hispanics (27.7%, 44.4%, and 49.7%, respectively) compared to non-Hispanic whites (37.3%, 56.9%, and 62.3%, respectively; Table 1 ). H1N1 vaccination coverage among HCP was higher among those who reported being male, having higher education, having higher income, being married, having access to a primary care physician, formerly or never smoking, and having health insurance. Additionally, people who needed to see a doctor but could not, and those who had not had a routine checkup within the past 1 year were less likely to be vaccinated (Table 1) . Factors associated with seasonal and any-dose vaccinations were similar to factors associated with H1N1 vaccination. Adjusted coverage estimates from the multivariable model did not differ greatly from the crude vaccination coverage. Overall, factors independently associated with H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccinations were similar. Characteristics independently associated with an increased likelihood of H1N1, seasonal, and any-dose vaccinations among HCP were being non-Hispanic white, having higher income, having a high-risk condition, having health insurance, having the ability to see a doctor if needed, and having a routine checkup in the previous year ( Figure 1 ). Using the state-specifıc fıgures, the 2009 H1N1, seasonal influenza, and any-dose influenza vaccination coverage among HCP and non-HCP were correlated (r ϭ0.8, 0.5, and 0.6, respectively).
