Of the 195 patients included in the study, 94 (48.2%) were between the ages of 30 and 64 years and 101 (51.8%) were ≥65 years. The average age of all patients was 63.9 ± 13.1 years old and 136 were males (69.7%). From September 2009 until September 2012, respiratory viruses were diagnoses in 95 AE-COPD samples (48.7%), and no pathogen was detected in 100 samples (51.3%). The most frequently detected respiratory virus during this period was influenza A/H1N1pdm09, present in 41 cases (21.0%), followed by HREV ( = 24; 12.3%), RSV ( = 13; 6.7%), and H3N2 influenza virus ( = 11; 5.6%). Twelve samples (6.2%) were positive for other respiratory pathogens included in the molecular diagnostic assays. Influenza B virus was detected in only one AE-COPD patient (0.5%), and 5 cases (2.6%) of coinfection were also detected. Viral diagnostic findings in AE-COPD patients decreased with age. Viruses were found in 61 samples (62.2%) from patients in the 30-64-year age group and in 41 patients (38.0%) in the ≥65-year age group (Figure 1 ). There was no age difference between AE-COPD patients with viral infection (62.1 ± 1.5 years) and those that tested negative by molecular diagnostics (65.6 ± 1.4 years, = 0.11). Influenza A/H1N1pdm09 was the most often detected virus in the 30-64-year age group ( = 30; 30.6%). On the other hand, most of the viruses had prevalences similar to one another in the ≥65-year age group: A/H1N1pdm09, 10.2%; HREV, 9.3%; other respiratory pathogens, 7.4%. Thus the absence of positive diagnostics was more common in this age group. The highest number of AE-COPD episodes ( = 124; 63.6%) was recorded for the pandemic, followed by FLUEP1 ( = 40; 20.5%) and FLUEP2 ( = 25; 12.8%) ( Table 2 ). Only 6 AE-COPD episodes occurred during any of the interepidemic periods, and none of them were diagnosed with respiratory viral infection. The average age of AE-COPD patients during the pandemic, 62.7 ± 13.1 years (Table 2) , was not significantly different from the patient ages in the first or second epidemic. The proportion of viral findings in AE-COPD patients increased from the pandemic ( = 59; 47.6%) until the end of the study period ( Figure 2 ). The maximum proportion occurred during FLUEP2 ( = 16; 64.0%) despite the low number of patients recruited in this period. In contrast, for the general Spanish population, the maximum incidence of influenza occurred during the pandemic, 221.7 cases/100,000 inhabitants, rather than in the following two influenza epidemics, 195.9 cases/100,000 habitants during FLUE1 and 200.3 cases/100,000 habitants during FLUEP2 (Figure 3 ). Influenza viruses were the most detected respiratory pathogens in AE-COPD patients during the pandemic and following epidemics. Specifically, influenza A/H1N1pdm09 was detected in 35 cases (28.2%) during the pandemic and in 6 cases (15.0%) during FLUEP1, while H3N2 influenza virus was detected in 11 cases (44.0%) during FLUEP2. Indeed, these two influenza strains represent together 54.7% of viruses diagnosed in AE-COPD episodes in this study. Meanwhile, HREV and RSV were the second and third most diagnosed viruses during the pandemic ( = 14; 11.3% and = 4; 3.2%, resp.). However, diagnosis of these two viruses constantly increased in the two following influenza epidemics. Also other respiratory pathogens increased in prevalence in AE-COPD cases from the pandemic ( = 6; 4.8%) until FLUEP2 ( = 3; 12.0%). Coinfections were more commonly detected during FLUEP2. We used the OR to analyze the probability of detection of viral categories (ORP, HREV, any influenza virus, and RSV) as well as viral coinfections in AE-COPD patients among different demographic and epidemiological characteristics such as gender, age groups, and the different periods analyzed. There was no gender difference in the rate of detection of respiratory viral or coinfections. The OR for detecting influenza in the 30-64-year age group was 2.78fold (CI95% = 1.44-5.38) greater than for the ≥65-year old group ( = 0.002). The probability for detecting RSV in the pandemic was significantly lower than detecting it in the first epidemic (OR = 0.19; CI95% = 0.05-0.71; = 0.013). Additionally, the probability for detecting influenza virus in the first epidemic was significantly lower than in the second epidemic (OR = 0.27, CI95% = 0.09-0.84; = 0.024). Finally, the probability for detecting coinfection during the pandemic was significantly lower than in the second epidemic (OR = 0.02; IC95% = 0.01-0.37; = 0.009).
