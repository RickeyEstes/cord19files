During the study period, only two HCWs (both nurses) in the study hospital developed fever (O 38 8C), cough and infiltrative lesions on chest radiograph. The polymerase chain reaction result for SARS-CoV was positive for both nurses. There were 43 suspected and 50 probable SARS cases in HCWs from 86 comparison hospitals during the three-week study period. The number of HCWs who contracted SARS in the study hospital was significantly lower than that in the comparison hospitals (0.03 cases/bed vs 0.13 cases/bed, respectively, PZ0.03).
