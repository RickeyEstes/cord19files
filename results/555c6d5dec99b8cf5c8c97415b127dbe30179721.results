Structure determination of TssK-TssF-TssG. To understand the architecture of the T6SS baseplate, we overexpressed and purified an EAEC complex comprising full-lengh TssF and TssG (residues 64-366) as well as the shoulder and neck domains of TssK (TssK SN , residues 1-315) (Fig. 1b) . We omitted from our construct the C-terminal domain of TssK (head domain), which participates to attaching the baseplate to the membrane complex, as it was previously shown to be poorly ordered and highly dynamic relative to TssK SN 24 . Size-exclusion chromatography indicated TssK SN -TssF-TssG eluted as a~400 kDa complex comprising multiple copies of one or several constituting proteins (Fig. 1c, d) , as reported 24, 27 . Processing of the cryoEM data set revealed TssF-TssG was mobile relative to TssK and we relied on extensive 3D classification of the data, to computationally isolate a homogeneous subset of particle images 29 , as well as multi-body focused refinement with density subtraction 30 (Fig. 2a-f ). The final cryoEM map has an overall resolution of 3.7 Å (3.9 Å for the TssF-TssG focused map) and is best resolved for the region corresponding to TssK, TssG, and the C-terminal domains of TssF (Fig. 2e, Fig. 3a , b, and Table 1 ).

Molecular weights from the ladder are indicated on the left. Uncropped gel is shown in Supplementary Figure 3 domains of TssF feature weaker density owing to conformational heterogeneity ( Fig. 2e and Fig. 3a, b) . We obtained a complete model of the complex by combining co-evolution-based modeling 31, 32 and manual building, using Rosetta [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] and Coot 38 , and docking the previously determined crystal structure of TssK 24 into the density (Fig. 3c, d, Fig. 4a , b, and Table 1 ). The final model comprises TssK residues 1-315 (with a chain break between residues 220-230), TssF residues 45-587 (with a chain break between residues 393-404), as well as TssG residues 122-365 (with a chain break between residues 330-336,). The cryoEM map also contains a few unassigned densities that were modeled as polyalanine chains and which likely account for the N-terminal regions of TssF and TssG. The TssK SN -TssF-TssG complex forms a nine-subunit structure, comprising six copies of TssK, two copies of TssF and one copy of TssG, with dimensions of 175 Å × 145 Å × 110 Å (Fig. 3a-d) . Architecture of the TssF-TssG heterotrimer. TssF folds as a three-domain polypeptide comprising: (i) an α-helical N-terminus (residues 47-85); (ii) a central domain made up of three βbarrels (residues 90-457); and (iii) a C-terminal four-stranded mixed β-sheet packed against α-helices via a hydrophobic core (residues 460-587, Fig. 5a-c) . TssG adopts a fold similar to TssF although the two proteins do not share detectable sequence similarity. However, only the N-terminal α-helical region (residues 122-177) and the C-terminal four-stranded mixed β-sheet supplemented with α-helices (residues 179-365) are present in TssG, which lacks an equivalent to the TssF central domain (Fig. 5a, b, d) . Two extended loops, designated loop 1 and loop 2, protrude from opposite ends of the TssG β-sheet but are absent in the corresponding domain of TssF (Fig. 5c, d) . The C-terminal domains of the two structures can be superimposed with an r.m.s. d of 4.5 Å over 56 aligned Cα positions (Fig. 5e, f) . The (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 complex assembles as a locally pseudosymmetrical heterotrimer with a 2:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 5a, b) . The N-termini of the three modeled chains form a three-helix bundle interacting with a triangular core, which is formed upon trimerization of the C-terminal domains of TssF and TssG. The triangle is capped by the TssG loop 1 at its apex and the TssG loop 2 projects toward the periphery. The heterotrimer is highly interdigitated and buries an average surface area of 2850 Å 2 and 2550 Å 2 at the interface between TssG and each TssF protomer, whereas the two TssF protomers bury an average surface area of 1900 Å 2 . The TssF and TssG C-terminal domains share remote structural similarity with the Helicobacter pylori HP1451 protein (Fig. 5g) , which has been shown to bind to the T4SS HP0525 ATPase to regulate secretion 39 , the bacteriophage T4 baseplate proteins gp6 and gp7 (Fig. 5h ) and the type II secretion system AspS pilotin (Fig. 5i ). These findings reinforce the previously proposed evolutionary connection between T6SSs, tailed phages and T4SSs, which appear to share a common set of building blocks 6, [11] [12] [13] 17 . Our data also suggest that an ancestral duplication event and subsequent loss or addition of the TssF central domain could have led to TssG or TssF, respectively, as previously hypothesized 40 . Attachment of TssK to the TssF-TssG heterotrimer. The architecture of the two TssK SN trimers in the TssK SN −TssF −TssG complex is very similar to the one observed in the TssK structure determined in complex with nanobodies nb18 and nb27 using X-ray crystallography 24 (1.1 Å r.m.s.d. over 230 aligned Cα carbons). The TssK SN trimer folds as an N-terminal β-sandwich (shoulder domain) followed by a four-helix bundle (neck domain) and resembles phage receptor-binding proteins 24 . Each TssK SN trimer attaches to one of the two extended loops protruding from the TssG C-terminal domain. Loop 1 anchors a TssK trimer near the apex of the pseudo-threefold symmetrical (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 C-terminal triangle, whereas loop 2 binds another TssK SN trimer at the periphery of the triangle (Fig. 5a -d and Fig. 6a ). The two TssK trimers are tilted~60°relative to each other and interact together, burying an average surface area of 1000 Å 2 at their interface. These results likely explain the observation of TssK trimers and of TssK trimers and hexamers for the EAEC and Serratia marcescens orthologues, respectively, as the protein forms homotrimers that interact with each other within and across wedges 28, 41 . TssG interacts with excellent surface complementarity with the N-termini of the TssK trimers. Specifically, three residues from loop 1 (Met228, Leu236, and Met242) or three residues from loop 2 (Leu308, Leu319, and Met325) project into the hydrophobic cavity defined by the N-terminal 15 residues of a TssK trimer, and these interactions are further strengthened via hydrogen-bonding and salt bridges at the periphery (Fig. 6b, c) . TssG loop 1 and loop 2 bury an average of 1066 Å 2 and 1249 Å 2 at the interface with a TssK trimer, respectively, whereas TssF weakly interacts with TssK within a baseplate wedge. Key hydrophobic residues in the TssKbinding loops are conserved (or conservatively substituted) across TssG orthologues found in distant Gram-negative bacterial species and TssG paralogues from different T6SSs (Fig. 6d, e) . These findings indicate that the interaction between TssG and TssK are most likely a common feature of T6SSs. Binding of TssK to TssG is reminiscent of the attachment mode observed for receptor-binding proteins to phage baseplates, such as in the cases of TP901-1 42 or p2 43 although the molecular details of the interactions are distinct. TssK SN -TssF-TssG interactions. To validate the interactions detected in our cryoEM reconstruction, we used a bacterial two-hybrid (BACTH) assay 44 . Our structure predicts that TssK protomers interact, as the protein forms homotrimers that contact each other. Indeed, BACTH confirmed the self-association of Figure 1 ). We next confirmed that the C-terminal domain of TssG acts as an adaptor for the TssK SN -TssF-TssG complex by interacting with TssK and with TssF ( Fig. 6f and Supplementary Figure 1 ), as observed in the atomic model. We interpret the lack of TssG C -T25 interactions with TssF and with TssK as a result of steric hindrance mediated by fusing the adenylate cyclase T25 domain at the C-terminus of the TssG C-terminal domain. This interpretation agrees with our structural data, with the detection of T25-TssG C (T25 fused at the N-terminus of the TssG C-terminal domain) interactions with TssF and with TssK, and with a previous study using a comparable experimental setup 26 . Our structure also indicates that the TssG loop 1 and loop 2 each mediate contacts with the N-terminal region of one TssK trimer. BACTH experiments support these findings since (i) removal of the TssK N-terminal 17 residues or (ii) substitution with arginine of the aforementioned three hydrophobic residues within the TssG loop 1 (Met228Arg, Leu236Arg, Met242Arg) or loop 2 (Leu308Arg, Leu319Arg, Met325Arg) abrogated binding between TssG and TssK without significantly affecting the interactions between TssG and TssF ( Fig. 6f and Supplementary  Figure 1 ). In summary, the outcomes of the BACTH experiments validated our atomic model and also agreed with and extend previously reported BACTH data 24, 26 . Architecture of the baseplate. We generated a model of the T6SS baseplate putatively corresponding to the conformational state before sheath contraction using our structure of the EAEC TssK SN -TssF-TssG complex and the previously determined cryoEM reconstruction of the non-contractile sheath mutant of the Vibrio cholerae T6SS baseplate/needle at 8 Å resolution 45 . The TssK-TssF-TssG complex, along with TssE, constitute a wedge and six such wedges are circularized in a baseplate comprising 36 copies of TssK, 12 copies of TssF, 6 copies of TssG and presumably 6 copies of TssE 27, 40 (Fig. 7a -c and Supplementary Figure 2a-g) . Rigid-body docking the TssK SN -TssF-TssG structure into the baseplate map shows the architecture of the recombinant complex recapitulates its overall organization in the context of a fully assembled T6SS apparatus. Although the resolution of the baseplate map is limited, we could nevertheless notice local tertiary and quaternary structural differences likely corresponding to conformational switching upon assembly, as reported for the bacteriophage major tail protein 13 . As the TssK region features weak density in the baseplate reconstruction, owing to mobility relative to the rest of the baseplate and/or substoichiometric incorporation of TssK, we applied a low-pass filter at 20 Å resolution to enhance map resolvability. This procedure confirmed each wedge attaches two TssK trimers to the baseplate (Supplementary Figure 2a-g) , in agreement with the TssK SN -TssF-TssG structure reported here. The apparent conformational heterogeneity of TssK further reinforces the similarity between phage and T6SS baseplates since receptor-binding proteins or TssK trimers are highly dynamic and this could be important for their functions 42 . The central domain of the proximal TssF protomer from each wedge contacts the VgrG oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide (OB)-fold barrel such as the latter domain is surrounded by two TssF protomers from two different wedges. VgrG thereby ensures the transition between its intrinsic threefold symmetry and the sixfold symmetry of the baseplate and needle, similarly to the phage T4 gp27 protein 15, 27, 46 or the Tal protein of phages TP901-1 42 and p2 43 . Lateral stabilization of the baseplate is provided by inter-wedge TssF-TssF, TssK-TssK, and TssF-TssK interactions (Fig. 7a-d) . Most of the inter-wedge TssF-TssF interactions involve contacts between a proximal TssF protomer of the wedge i (through its central and C-terminal domains) and a peripheral TssF protomer of the wedge i + 1 (through its C-terminal domain, Fig. 7d ). Our model also suggests TssK-TssF-TssG complexes are interacting with the proximal TssB-TssC sheath ring, in agreement with previous BACTH studies 23, 26 . On one hand, the (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 heterotrimer N-terminal stem contacts TssC. On the other hand, the N-terminal helix of TssC and the Cterminal helix of TssB protrudes in direction of the same (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 heterotrimer to interact with the small β-barrel located within the TssF central domain. The interactions between TssB/ TssC and TssF are mediated by the TssF protomers radiating at the periphery of the baseplate whereas the TssF protomers protruding toward the center of the baseplate bind to VgrG. TssE, which is absent in the model presented here, is expected to interact with the (TssF) 2 -(TssG) 1 heterotrimer N-terminal stem and with the TssB/TssC sheath, based on similarity with the phage T4 baseplate structure 11, 27, 46 .
