One (2.78%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. The mean age of the patients was 69.22 years (SD 9.64, range 50-90). Twenty-five (69.44%) patients were males, and 11 (30.56%) female. Four (11.11%) patients have smoking history. Twenty-six (72.22%) patients had chronic diseases. The most common chronic diseases were hypertension (21, 58.33%), cardiovascular (8, 22 .22%) and diabetes (7, 19.44%) ( Table 1 ). On admission, most patients had fever, cough and more than half of them had shortness of breath (Table 2 ). Other symptoms included fatigue, dyspnea, sputum production, disturbance of consciousness, diarrhea, hemoptysis and myalgia. (Table 2) According to chest CT scan, 31 (96.88%, N=32) patients showed bilateral pneumonia (75%). On admission, leucocytes were below the normal range in 5 (14.71%) patients and above the normal range in 11 (32.35%) patients (Table 3 ). Neutrophils showed above the normal range in 16 (47.06%) patients. Lymphocytes and hemoglobin were below the normal range in many patients (Table 3) . Twelve (35.39%) patients' platelets were below the normal range. 22 patients had varying degrees of liver function abnormality, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) rose above the normal range ( Table 3) . Elevation of lactate dehydrogenase were showed in 26 (100%, N=26) patients. About 30% of these patients had different degrees of renal function damage, with elevated blood urea nitrogen or serum creatinine. All rights reserved.

Thirty-five (35, 97.22%) patients received antiviral treatment, including oseltamivir, ganciclovir, ribavirin or umifenovir hydrochloride. All patients were given antibiotic treatment ( Table 2) Table   2 ). The median time from onset to death was 17 days (Figure 1 ).
