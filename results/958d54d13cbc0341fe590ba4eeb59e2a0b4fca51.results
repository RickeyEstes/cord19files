Ectopic expression of TRIM52 restricts JEV replication. Many members of the TRIM family act as regulator in host-virus interaction; they either positively or negatively impact virus replication, as well as directly or indirectly restrict virus replication. This study investigated the potential antiviral function of TRIM52 against JEV infection. To test whether TRIM52 can influence JEV replication, we transfected BHK-21 and 293T cells with plasmids expressing HA-tagged TRIM52 or with an empty vector as control. The control and TRIM52-overexpressing cells were both infected with JEV at an MOI of 1. The culture supernatants were harvested 24 hour post-infection (hpi), and the titers of the progeny virus were determined using plaque forming unit assay on BHK-21 cells. Figure 1a shows that TRIM52 overexpression reduced JEV titers both in BHK-21 (left panel) and 293T cells (right panel). Moreover, gene copies of JEV C gene and protein level of NS3 in infected cells were detected, demonstrating the antiviral activity of TRIM52 against JEV. As shown in Fig. 1b , the intracellular C gene levels of JEV were significantly reduced in TRIM52-overexpressing cells compared with that in the vector control cells. In addition, Western blot analysis indicated that the NS3 protein levels of JEV were significantly repressed in the presence of TRIM52. These results suggest that TRIM52 exerted antiviral activity against JEV replication both in BHK-21 and 293T cells.
