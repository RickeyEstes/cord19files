The results of CCV-C54 survival in various media at different temperatures are shown in Figs. la-e. The pattern of virus survival was similar for growth medium and VTM at all temperatures although the former tended to be marginally superior. The lower the temperature of storage then the greater the retention of infectivity. Viral titre was rapidly lost at 37°C in growth medium, with a drop in virus infectivity from the initial titre of 10 5.3 TCIDso/ ml to zero by 13 hours (Fig. la) . At 20°C, in growth medium and VTM, virus infectivity declined more slowly, but there was at least a 102 reduction in titre by 48 hours (Fig. lb) . At 4°C little loss in titre was seen in either growth medium or VTM up to 72 hours ( (Fig. le) by 3 months. Almost complete retention of viral infectivity was demonstrated following six consecutive freeze-thaw cycles. The CCV titre decreased from 10 5.3 TCIDso/ml initially to 105 TCIDso/ml after the sixth freeze-thaw cycle (Fig. 2) . The data from the second experiment show a decreased rate of virus loss at 4°C where the faecal suspension was diluted with growth medium (Fig. 3a) . Viral titre was rapidly lost in the 1:1 dilution with a 103 loglo reduction by 24 hours, whereas with the 1:10 dilution a similar drop in titre was only seen after 72 hours. Dilution at 1:1000 appeared to preserve virus infectivity completely over this time period. At 20°C the results were less clear cut. Dilution with growth media appeared to reduce virus loss only in the first 12 hours, after which time virus infectivity decreased rapidly (Fig. 3b) .
