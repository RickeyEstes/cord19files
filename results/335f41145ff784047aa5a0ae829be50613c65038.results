Two hundred fifty-one women were asked to participate, and 227 met our eligibility criteria and agreed to participate (90.4% response rate). Of the 227, 86 had missing items on their surveys or their birth outcomes data were not available in the hospital medical records system. Table 1 illustrates our sample demographics, comparing the 141 women who were ultimately included in our analysis with the 86 who were excluded. Overall, our sample is one of well-educated Han women in their last trimester of pregnancy who are married and working outside the home. They do not differ significantly from the 86 women excluded from the analysis 76 (91.5) P = .300 (NS) Missing = 3 * Women with incomplete baseline data were excluded from the regression analysis. Key variables for inclusion were age, education, income, number of previous deliveries, originally from Beijing (y/n), car ownership (y/n), work before pregnancy (y/n), intend to work after pregnancy (y/n), insurance status, previous abortion (y/n), previous miscarriage (y/n), and experience of this pregnancy. on any variable aside from education, with excluded women more likely to have lower levels of education (P = .012). Table 2 illustrates the health-related variables reported at enrollment. Again, there were no significant differences found between women included in our analysis and those excluded due to missing data. More than half of our sample has had at least one previous pregnancy that was either spontaneously or electively terminated, and only 2.8 percent of women report having anything other than mild complications in this current pregnancy. The vast majority of women in this study were primiparous. Table 3 reflects delivery data obtained via chart review. Mean gestational age at delivery was 39.6 weeks. Mean duration of labor-defined as the time from first documentation of regular contractions plus cervical dilation to vaginal delivery-was 9 hours, with a range of 1 to 21 hours. Slightly more than half of women delivered vaginally, with the remaining having planned, emergency, or posttrial-of-labor (PTOL) cesarean sections. Infants had a mean gestational weight of 3406 grams, and most had five-minute Apgar scores of 10. Forty-one percent of women had at least one birth complication. The most common complications were fetal distress (41%), preterm membrane rupture (26%), umbilical cord issues such as prolapsed, entanglement or nuchal cords (17%), and delayed labor (7%). With regard to Research Question 1, (is optimism or pessimism associated with unplanned cesarean section delivery?), bivariate analyses comparing optimism and pessimism against unplanned cesarean section indicated that both were significant: optimism (P = .047, 95% CI. 012, 1.81), pessimism (P = .003; 95% CI −2.42, −.529) (See Table 4 ). In addition, labor duration (P = .004, 95% CI 1. 009, 5.16) and the presence of birth complications (P = .01, Chi Square = 6.65) were also found to be significant. No other demographic or clinical factors were significantly associated with unplanned cesarean section. Table 5 Model 1, illustrates the findings with regard to Research Question 2 (which is more strongly associated with unplanned cesarean section delivery, optimism or pessimism?). In an unadjusted model in which both optimism and pessimism were regressed against unplanned cesarean section, pessimism remained statistically significant while optimism failed to meet the threshold for statistical significance. (pessimism OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.56, P = .01; optimism OR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.08; P = . 22) . When the same model was then adjusted for a variety of clinical factors (see Table 5 Model 2) to answer Research question 3 "if there is a significant relationship between optimism, pessimism, and unplanned cesarean section delivery, is that relationship robust enough to remain significant when clinical factors are included in the model?", pessimism remained significantly associated with unplanned cesarean section (OR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.81; P = .004).
