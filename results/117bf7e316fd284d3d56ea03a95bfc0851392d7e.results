Overall, 567 animals were enrolled. Forty-six animals were excluded due to multiple reasons such as lameness (n = 1), bloody colostrum (n = 20), mastitic colostrum (n = 1), gestation length of less than 265 d (n = 7), twin births (n = 11), and missing data (n = 6). For the final analyses, 521 animals (365 multiparous cows and 156 first-calf heifers) were considered regarding colostrum quantity (Figure 1 ). The mean harvesting time after calving was 47 Â± 0.33 min with a range of minimum 5 min up to maximum of 4 h and 50 min after calving.
