The multiple alignments (Suppl. Fig. 1 ) of the sequences of LASV available in the GenBank at the beginning of the study allowed the identification of highly conserved regions required for the designing of the LASV-specific primers and respective probes (Table 1) . On the basis of the sequencing data, oligonucleotide primers and fluorescent probes were designed and synthesized, and the LASV-specific assay was developed. The developed assay included all components required for RT-qPCR. The advantage of this assay is that it allows the verification of all steps of the analysis, including extraction, reverse transcription and PCR. In addition, using EC − and C−, the risk of false-positive results because of cross-contamination was minimized. The LOD assessed using ARP dilutions was between 10 3 copies/ml and 10 5 copies/ml (depending on the ARP), and the LOD measured using LASV strain Josiah was 10 PFU/ml (Table 4 ). Standard detection was linear ranging from 10 6 copies/ml (C t = 25.5-28.1) to 5 × 10 2 -10 2 copies/ml (C t = 37.9-38.4) of the LASV ARPs (R 2 = 0.97-0.99; Fig. 1 ). The potential for cross-reactivity was assessed using high-titer RNA or DNA from 27 viral species. None of the 27 different viral species showed a positive reaction with the LASV RT-qPCR. Consequently, the evaluated analytical specificity was 100%. In addition, a total of 92 biological samples (positive n = 55 and negative n = 37) examined for Lassa previously by the Virology Laboratory of Hemorrhagic Fevers Research Project of Gamal Abdel Nasser University of Conakry, Guinea were tested using the LASV RT-PCR assay, with 53 samples testing positive and 39 negative (Tables 5  and 6 ). Discordance in the two samples (negative by the LASV-Fl assay and positive by VLHV) was observed. The Ct − values of the positive samples ranged from 21.9-39.2 cycles. Thus, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of LASV-Fl RT-qPCR assay were 96.4% (53/55) (95% CI, 86.4-99.0%) and 100% (37/ 37), respectively.
