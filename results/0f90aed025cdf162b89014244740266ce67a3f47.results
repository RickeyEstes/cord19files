A total of 291,381 first-ever ischemic stroke patients were enrolled between 2000 and 2011. The average age was about 70 years and approximately 58.6% of them were men. The average length of hospital stay was about 7 days. More than half of patients had history of hypertension, which was from 59% to 63% and the frequency of hypertension in ischemic stroke was not much different in three time period. The frequencies of diabetes mellitus (from 29.6% to 34.0%) and hyperlipidemia (from 22.0% to 40.6%) increased steadily during study periods. Frequencies of atrial fibrillation (from 7.3% to 10.4%), chronic kidney disease (from 3.9% to 5.0%), and heart failure (from 7.3% to 9.3%) also increased during the study periods. The frequencies of brain CT use was decreased from 94.4% in 2000-2003 to 79.6% in 2008-2011 while brain MRI use was increased from 22.1% in 2000-2003 to 55.4% in 2008-2011. General characteristics are described in Table 1 . During the study periods, 30-day in-hospital mortality was from 1.7% to 1.9%. About 37% of first-ever ischemic stroke patients received calcium channel blockers for antihypertension therapy during admission throughout the study period. The use of angiotensin receptor blockers was increased from 6% to 18.1% during the study periods. Frequencies of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (16%) and diuretics (13%) were much the same among three time sections. The use of statin in ischemic stroke patients was increased from 8.
