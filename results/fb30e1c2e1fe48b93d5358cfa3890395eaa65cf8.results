A total of 200 patients met the inclusion criteria. At ER presentation all patients had increasing dyspnea, cough and production of purulent sputum while 20 (10%) of them reported fever and 5 (2.5%) other symptoms (somnolence or excitation). The reported by patients symptoms appeared on average 5 AE 2 days before their ER evaluation while 149 patients were able to perform a spirometry in the ER in order to be classified according to GOLD criteria. The rest 51 were classified using the most recent available spirometric data since they were unable to perform spirometry due to the severity of their disease. Comorbid conditions were noted in the following order of frequency: 100 (50%) patients reported a history of chronic cardiac disease, 58 (29%) patients had known diabetes mellitus and 23 (11.5%) patients had a history of chronic renal failure. In 107 (53.5%) patients a virus was identified by arrays in at least one collected specimen (either in orophryngeal or in sputum sample) while in 93(46.5%) no virus was isolated. A mixed infection with more than one viral pathogen was identified in 41 (38.3%) patients (Table 2 ). No differences were noted between the COPD groups with regards to the isolation of a virus. The groups differed in the length of hospital stay that was longer in COPD patients where a virus was isolated (p < 0.01) ( Table 1 ). In 27 (13.5%) patients, a bacterial pathogen was identified in the sputum culture. Twelve (6%) patients did not survive ( Table 1) . The isolated viruses in order of frequency were human Respiratory Suncytial Virus (hRSV) subtypes A and B (40.5%), influenza type A, B and C virus (12%), rhinovirus (8%), human Parainfluenza (hPIV) subtypes 3 and 4 (7.5%), coronavirus (2%), human Metapneumovirus (hMPVA) subtype A and B (2%), adenovirus (2%), enterovirus (0.5%) (Fig. 1 ). Significant discrepancies were noted in the isolation of the viruses between oropharyngeal and sputum samples. RSV was detected by arrays in 33 (55.9%) of the oropharyngeal samples where no virus was detected in the concomitantly taken sputum sample. Conversely RSV was identified in 33 (68.8%) of the collected sputum samples whereas it was not found in the simultaneously taken samples from the oropharynx. In 15 cases overall (14%) the virus was found from both samples. Rhinovirus was most successfully isolated from the oropharyngeal samples whereas hPIV and influenza viruses from the sputum (data not shown). The vast majority of positive samples were noted from January through April and in October. Patients' characteristics according to COPD stage are shown in Tables 3 and 4) . From the 200 patients recruited in our study only 7 died. As stated in Table 1 death was not related to the presence of a viral infection (p ¼ 0.3) and as stated from Table 3 it was also not related to the stage of the disease (p ¼ 0.2). The only risk factor we found to be related with non-survival was the use of oxygen. It seemed that patients who did not survive were more oxygen dependent and this result was statistically important (p ¼ 0.001). No other comorbidity (ex cardiac disease, renal failure or diabetes mellitus) seemed to be a risk factor for negative outcome. In 14 (13.1%) AECOPD patients where a virus was isolated a simultaneous positive bacterial culture was noted. More specifically in 8 (4%) patients Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured, in 4 (2%) Haemophilus influenzae, in 4(2%) Klebsiella pneumoniae, in 4 (2%) Staphylococcus aureus, in 3 (1.5%) Acinetobacter baumanii, in 2 (1%) Stenotrophomomonas maltophilia and in 3 (1.5%) other bacteria (in one patient 2 bacterial pathogens were identified) ( Table 5) . Bacterial cultures were more frequently positive in patients with COPD of stage III/IV than in COPD patients of stage I and II (3vs24; p < 0.01) (Tables 1 and 3 ).
