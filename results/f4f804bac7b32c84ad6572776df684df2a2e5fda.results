All dead nestlings and three of five unhatched embryos showed two to six different veterinary drugs in liver (nestlings) and egg yolk (embryos). In addition, the two embryos with fluoroquinolones in the yolk also had them in the liver (Table 1) . Fluoroquinolones were the most prevalent drugs and showed the highest concentrations (Table 1) . Other drugs such as NSAIDs and antiparasitics were found in most nestlings at variable concentrations, but in no eggs (Table 1) . Other toxic compounds were detected in lower prevalence and concentrations (see Table 1 for those more relevant values; all insecticides were found at concentrations ,0.001 ppb), which was further supported by basal levels of brain cholinesterase (Table 1) . Dead embryos and nestlings showed a moderate to good nutritional state. Major histopathological lesions were primarily located in the kidney, including glomerulonephritis and/or glomerulonephrosis present in all individuals with fluoroquinolones, but not in those without drugs (Table 1 ). All individuals with fluoroquinolones also showed joint lesions, including arthritis and/ or arthrosis of the long bone articulations, as well as massive osseous stroma of the spongeous bones. The fungi Candida albicans was isolated from the oral cavity of five individuals. All individuals showed non-specific mixedbacterial flora. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. were isolated in four cases ( Table 1 (cont.) *Samples from the same territory in different years. 1 Veterinary drugs. EN: enrofloxacin (mg/g), CI: ciprofloxacin (mg/g), OX: oxytetracyclin (mg/g), FL: flunixin meglumine (mg/g), AS: sodium salicylate (ng/g), IV: Ivermectin (mg/g). 2 Other toxicants. OR: organochlorines (ng/g), Pb: lead (ng/g). 12. z29 (three cases, see Table 1 ). One individual showed infection by Salmonella enterica enteritidis (see above) and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli O86 in all examined organs (septicaemia) except brain, which rejected the possibility of post-mortem contamination. Pasteurella multocida was isolated in a single individual that also showed enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli O86 (Table 1) ; all of these individuals contained fluoroquinolones. One of the failed embryos without veterinary drugs showed suppurative myocarditis, multiple microabscesses in head muscles, suppurative leptomeningitis, as well as lower jaw gangrenous inflammation with loss of the osseous stroma due to a mixed infection with Streptococcus suis and Streptococcus pneumoniae in brain, meninges and neck muscles; this embryo also showed infection by chicken infectious bronchitis ( Table 1 ). Both immunocytochemistry for the detection of poultry viruses and PCR pathogen survey were positive to IBDV in six individuals with fluoroquinolones (Table 1) . Immunocytochemical procedures failed to detect West Nile virus antigens in individuals in which PCR for this virus had been positive. Parasitology was negative for all helminths, helminth eggs and protozoans.
