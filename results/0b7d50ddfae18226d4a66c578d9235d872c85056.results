DRAG mice are highly reconstituted with human CD45 + cells. To assess the level of reconstitution of human cells in DRAG mice, we harvested the gut (PP, IEL, LPL), FRT, LN, and SP. The presence of PP in DRAG mice, in contrast to other humanized mice, allowed us to characterize the lymphocytes in this tissue. Human cells were identified by the expression of human hematopoietic cell marker CD45 ( Fig. 1a left panel, representative dot plot). All lymphoid and mucosal tissues investigated were reconstituted with human cells (Fig. 1a left panel, Fig. 1b , average percentage with standard error of mean from 5-8 separate experiments, and Supplementary Fig. 1a , representative dot plot). Furthermore, the reconstitution of human cells in the gut of DRAG mice was high, compared to other humanized mouse strains 23 . The frequency of T cells was 60-85% of the human CD45 + cells (Fig. 1c) , while B cells constituted 10-35% of human CD45 + cells ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). There were no significant differences in the frequency of CD4 + T cells among the various tissues investigated (Fig. 1e) . Among T cells, the percentage of CD4 + T cells was much higher than CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1a second panel and Fig. 1e ), which is similar to what has been observed in humans. A subpopulation of T cells that expresses both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors (CD4 + CD8 + or double positive) were mainly present in LPL (about 20%) and IEL (15.8%), and also in the PP (7%), SP (6%), FRT (5.3%), and LN (6%), albeit at a lower frequency ( Fig. 1a second panel, Fig. 1e , and Supplementary Fig. 1a ). The frequency of CD4 + CD8 + T cells in LPL and IEL was significantly higher compared to SP and LN (P = 0.01 and P = 0.02, respectively). To identify the human CD4 + T cell subsets, cells were stained for memory and naïve markers (CD27 and CD45RA). The majority of CD4 + T cells (79-96%) exhibited a memory phenotype, which is defined as negative for the naïve CD4 + T cell marker CD45RA (Fig. 1a third panel) . The majority of memory CD4 + T cells in LPL (Fig. 1a third panel) and FRT ( Supplementary Fig. 1a) were negative for CD27 and CD45RA thus exhibiting an effector memory phenotype. In contrast, the majority of memory CD4 + T cells in IEL, PP, and SP ( Fig. 1a third panel) displayed a central memory phenotype by expressing CD27 but not CD45RA. Since the coreceptor CCR5 is required for R5 HIV-1 strains 24,25 , we examined its expression on CD4 + T cells. The majority of CD4 + T cells in FRT, IEL, LPL, and PP expressed CCR5 (50-80%) compared to SP (25%), and LN (40%) (Fig. 1a fourth panel, Fig. 1f , and Supplementary Fig.  1a ). The CCR5 + CD4 + T cells were significantly higher (P < 0.04) in IEL, LPL, and PP compared to SP and LN. The expression of α 4β 7-integrin receptor is associated with trafficking to mucosal tissues through an interaction with its ligand mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 26 . α 4β 7 binds HIV-1 and facilitates HIV-1 infection of mucosal CD4 + T cells 27, 28 . Our results show that mucosal tissues, which are the primary sites of HIV-1 transmission had CD4 + α 4β 7 + T cells in varying frequencies (Fig. 2a upper panel and Fig. 2b) . Similarly, X4-tropic HIV-1 strains use CXCR4 as a coreceptor 29, 30 , and we found CXCR4 expression on FRT and LPL CD4 + T cells was higher compared to CD4 + T cells from other tissues examined ( Fig. 2a lower panel) . Since CD4 + CD8 + T cells (double positive) constitute a significant population of humanized DRAG mice gut tissue T cell subsets, we analyzed the memory phenotype and the expression of HIV-1 coreceptors CCR5, CXCR4, and α 4β 7 on these cells. CD4 + CD8 + T cells in the tissues examined ( Fig. 2c left panel) exhibited a memory phenotype similar to that of (single-positive) CD4 + T cells obtained from the same tissue ( Fig. 1a third panel) . The frequency of CXCR4 + CD4 + CD8 + T cells in IEL (Fig. 2c second panel) was higher compared to CXCR4 + CD4 + T cells in IEL (Fig. 2a lower panel) . Similarly, the proportion of α 4β 7 + CD4 + CD8 + T cells in IEL and LPL (Fig. 2c third panel) was higher than α 4β 7 + CD4 + T cells (Fig. 2a upper panel) . However, no significant differences were observed between the two populations in PP and SP. In contrast, the frequency of CCR5 + CD4 + CD8 + T cells (Fig. 2c fourth panel) is significantly higher (paired Student's t test) than the frequency of CCR5 + CD4 + T cells (Fig. 1a fourth panel) in the IEL (P = 0.04) and LPL (P = 0.02). T FH cell subsets are enriched in the gut tissues. T FH cells have been studied in the peripheral blood, tonsil, and lymph nodes [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 31, 32 . However, the distribution of T FH cells in the gut and FRT has not been investigated. Analysis of single cell suspensions from mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN), IEL, LPL, and PP of humanized DRAG mice revealed CXCR5 + PD-1 ++ CD4 + T FH cells (Fig. 3a) . T FH cells were largely present in the mLN (8.4%), and PP (7%), and at lower frequencies in IEL (0.8%), LPL (2.1%) Human B cell subsets in lymphoid tissue, gut, and FRT. A substantial advantage of humanized DRAG mice is the reconstitution of functional human B cells with the ability to perform class switch recombination and elicit antigen-specific IgG antibodies upon vaccination 21 . As this model may be suitable for testing future vaccines, we investigated the distribution of B cell subsets in various tissues. In our study, we found that the largest population of B cells had a naive phenotype (CD38 − IgD + ) in all tissues examined except in LPL (Fig. 3b) . A substantial population of B cells in all of the tissues was in the early (CD38 + IgD − ) and late (CD38 − IgD − ) memory phase, while a small subset of B cells had a GC phenotype (CD38 ++ IgD − ) (Fig. 3b ).
