A total of 1299 cases (1186 cases in analysis) from KSA and 186 cases from SK were reported from 2012 to 2015. On the basis of the available data, the comparison of demographics and other characteristics between KSA and SK is presented in Table 1 . The mean age of MERS cases was 51 years in KSA, and 54 years in SK. In both countries, most cases were reported in the age group ⩾ 70 years (KSA: 227 of 1186 cases, 19.1% and SK: 40 of 186 cases, 21.5%) followed by the age group 50-59 years (KSA: 215 of 1186 cases, 18.1% and SK: 38 of 186 cases, 20.4%) ( Figure 1A ). Overall, there was a higher frequency of males among cases in KSA (741 of 1137, 65.2%) than in SK (110 of 186, 59.1%); however, no significant differences in sex distribution were found between the two countries. The overall CFR was 19.2% (228 fatalities of 1186 cases) in KSA and 19.4% (36 fatalities of 186 cases) in SK. The age-specific CFR increased by age in both counties, and the highest values were reported in the age group ⩾ 70 years ( Figures 1B and 1C ). In terms of sex-specific CFR, there was no significant difference between KSA and SK. No significant difference was found in the proportions of infected healthcare workers between KSA (157 of 1166, 13.5%) and SK (26 of 170, 15.3%). Rates of MERS cases with comorbidity were also higher in males in both KSA (460 of 657, 70.0%) and SK (21 of 35, 60.0%). No significant differences in sex-specific comorbidity rates were observed between KSA and SK. MERS cases in KSA had various contact risk factors before symptom onset ( Figure 1D ), including contact with camels and camel products (e.g., camel raw milk) (n = 59, 5.0%), sheep and sheep products (n = 5, 0.4%), nosocomial MERS cases or hospitals having MERS outbreak (n = 158, 13.3%), and diseased family members or friends (n = 245, 20.7%), and a majority had unknown risk factors (n = 710, 59.9%). In addition, several cases had more than one risk factor, including contact with both camels and sheep (n = 6, 0.5%), camels and confirmed human cases (n = 2, 0.2%), and the mixture of several contact types (n = 1, 0.1%). In SK, most cases had a contact history in hospital facilities (n = 175, 94.1%), whereas only six cases (3.2%) were infected with MERS-CoV through community contacts. The differences in the rates of community-linked, hospital-linked or unknown risk factors between KSA and SK were statistically significant (Po0.001). On the basis of the reported date of onset of symptoms, the epidemic curve in KSA from 2012 to 2015 by week is shown in Figure 2A . During the four years after the emergence of MERS-CoV, several peaks were observed in week 18 in 2014 and weeks 7, 10, 34 in 2015. In addition, numerous clusters and sporadic cases were noted with no clear seasonality, comprising a very protracted and mixed pattern. The epidemic curve of MERS-CoV in SK in 2015 ( Figure 2B ) exhibited a classic epidemic curve over a short time (8 weeks) with a small number of early cases beginning in week 20 followed by a rapid rise in new cases over two weeks, an epidemic peak at week 23 and then a decline in cases ending at week 28.
