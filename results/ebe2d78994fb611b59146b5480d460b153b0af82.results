The metal complexes of 3-aryl-azo-4-hydroxy coumarin analogues were synthesized by refluxing different hydro alcoholic solutions of metal chlorides with 3-(4-chloro phenyl/4-methoxy phenyl)-azo-4-hydroxy coumarin analogues (Scheme 1) and finally re-crystallized from diethyl ether. The structures of the prepared compounds are confirmed by different instrumental methods of analysis. The physical characteristics of the synthesized compounds are reported in Table 1 . The FT/IR spectra of synthesized ligands 3a and 3b showed strong vibration bands at 3479e 3445 cm À1 , 1619e1603 cm À1 , 1726e1745 cm À1 , 1298e 1246 cm À1 and 1529e1505 cm À1 due to presence of functional groups such as OH str., C]C str., C]O str., CeO str. and N]N str., respectively. The strong vibration bands of compound 3a at 1726, 1619 and 1298 cm À1 may be due to presence of a lactone carbonyl of C]O str., C] C str. and ]CeO str., respectively, and are illustrated in Figure 1 . The frequencies of all the complexes (4ae4h) assigned at 1629e1613 cm À1 , 1729e1721 cm À1 , 1296e 1248 cm À1 and 1529e1524 cm À1 correspond to C]C str., C]O str., CeO str. and N]N str., respectively. The IR spectral bands of all metal complexes appearing at 451e441 and 538e531 cm À1 are assigned to (MÀN) and (MÀO), respectively. The 1 H NMR spectra of the ligands showed a broad singlet at d 16.81e16.86 ppm towards the presence of the enolic OH group of 4-hydroxy coumarin. The 1 H NMR spectrum of compound 3b showed a sharp singlet at d 3.83 ppm corresponding to the proton of eOCH 3 ( Figure 2 ). All of the complexes showed signals at a range of (6.90e7.26)e(7.23e7.37) ppm corresponding to {m, 8H, (C 6 H 4 ) 2 }. The magnetic susceptibility of the Co(II) complex is 5.09 BM, which is nearer to the reported value for octahedral symmetry. 21 The Ni(II) complex showed a magnetic moment of 2.94 BM, whereas the Cu(II) complex showed a magnetic moment of 1.98 BM, suggesting an octahedral geometry. Compounds 3ae3b act as bidentate ligands by coordinating to the transitional metal ions through their azo and enolic hydroxyl moiety. Based upon the study of magnetic susceptibility values of the complexes, the probable structure is given in Scheme 1. The predicted molecular weights of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by LCeMS and the results are summarized in Table 1 . Compound 3a possesses a molecular ion peak at 301.2 m/z that strongly reveals the predicted molecular formula C 15 H 9 ClN 2 O 3 that is reported in Figure 4 . The UV spectroscopic analyses of the synthesized ligands and complexes revealed that complexes 4a and 4e demonstrated a good bathochromic shift at 463 and 450 nm, whereas ligands 3a and 3b possessed a l max at 409 and 413 nm, respectively. The solvent effect of the ligands and their respective complexes are spectrally presented in Figure 3 . The X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique provides the most definitive structural information. The study of the XRD pattern of the synthesized complexes was performed using a Cu Ka X-ray source and a step of 0.02 (2q) and run at 2q ¼ 2e80 using a Shimadzu XRD 7000 instrument at a scanning speed of 2.000 (deg/min). Using Origin data analysis software, the structures of the obtained complexes were interpreted. The pattern and the number of reflections reported in Figure 5 clearly declared the structural difference of compounds 4e and 4f. The results of the antimicrobial activity of the newly synthesized 3-aryl-azo-4-hydroxy coumarin analogues and their complexes compared with reference antibiotics (RA) ampicillin and fluconazole (as antibacterial and antifungal standard drugs, respectively) expressed in mean AE SD are reported in Table 2 . The reported results revealed that compounds 4a and 4e showed significant antimicrobial activity in comparison to standard drugs (p < 0.05) against E. coli, K. pneumonia, S. aureus, C. albicans and C. neoformans. All compounds except for 4d and 4h showed significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus. However, complex 4a showed highest mean zone of inhibition (mm) against K. pneumonia and C. neoformans, 19 AE 1.1 and 27.5 AE 1.64, respectively. The largest mean zones of inhibition exhibited by complex 4e against S. aureus and C. neoformans was 23 AE 2.28 and 28.17 AE 1.72, respectively. The anti-biogram pattern of compound 3a, 3b and their complexes against different fungal strains are illustrated in Figure 6 . The graphical representation of complexes 4a and 4e is illustrated in Figure 7 . The inhibitory property of the compounds was determined in terms of MIC (mg mL À1 ). The Co þþ complexes of both the ligands showed the antimicrobial activity against all the selected strains at MIC level 31.25 mg mL À1 . All compounds except for 4d and 4h showed a zone of inhibition at the MIC level 31.25 mg mL À1 against C. albicans (Table 3) . No mortality was found for all of the test compounds per the results of the toxicity study. The synthesized compounds were safe up to 2000 mg/kg body weight. No significant change in the body weight of the animals was observed. No toxic symptoms and gross behavioural changes were observed in the animals.
