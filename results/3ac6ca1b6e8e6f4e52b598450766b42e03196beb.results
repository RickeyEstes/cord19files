White Leghorn chickens were inoculated with virulent IBV strain M41 and at four different time points after inoculation spleens were harvested. Splenocytes of IBV-infected and uninfected chickens were incubated for 48 h with ConA, PMA and ionomycin, and different coronaviruses. ChIFN-γ production increased significantly after in vitro restimulation with IBV in both the IBV-infected and uninfected chickens (Fig. 1) . Two mammalian coronaviruses did not cause an increase in ChIFN-γ production, indicating that the observed effect was specific for IBV and not for coronaviruses in general. To determine if the IBV-induced ChIFN-γ production was caused by virus invasion and replication or an exclusively cell-mediated response to IBV, the virus was inactivated by exposure to ultraviolet light (Fig. 1 , 13 dpi). ChIFN-γ production after exposure to the inactivated IBV did decrease in the IBV-uninfected birds when compared to IBV-infected birds, but it was still higher than in unstimulated cells. Although a decrease in ChIFN-γ production was detected after UVinactivation of IBV, it cannot be excluded that the immune response in the IBV-infected chickens had already passed its peak at this time point. The experiment was repeated with IBV and with another chicken virus, NDV, both live and UV-inactivated. Splenocytes of an unvaccinated chicken and a chicken that had been vaccinated for both IBV and NDV 4 months prior to the experiment were restimulated in vitro with different concentrations of either virulent or UV-inactivated IBV M41 or NDV (Fig. 2) . Only the splenocytes from the NDV-vaccinated chicken produced ChIFN-γ after NDV restimulation, and hardly any response to the UVinactivated virus was detected. In contrast, both the IBV-vaccinated and the unvaccinated chicken showed a dose-dependent response to restimulation with IBV, with no discernable difference between treated and untreated virus in the vaccinated chicken. Stimulation with UV-inactivated IBV resulted in decreased ChIFN-γ production in the unvaccinated chicken compared to the vaccinated chicken, but the response was still elevated compared to the unstimulated control. To test if the observed effect is a specific interaction between the virus and its natural host, or if IBV can activate leukocytes regardless of the species from which the cells were obtained, we stimulated chicken and cow leukocytes with mitogens and different avian viruses (Fig. 3) . Splenocytes of an IBV-and NDV-vaccinated chicken produced ChIFN-γ after incubation with IBV and UV-inactivated IBV, whereas cow PBMC did not show any response. A third poultry virus, REV, did not induce IFN-γ. These results demonstrate that the immune activation by IBV is species-specific, and that two other poultry viruses that we have tested (NDV and REV) do not cause a similar rapid immune activation upon first exposure. IBV is known to induce rapid production of type-I IFNs by chicken leukocytes in both naïve and IBV-infected chickens (Pei et al., 2001) . Type-I IFNs are heat-stable, whereas IFN-γ is heat-sensitive. To exclude that the anti-IFN-γ antibodies used in our ELISPOT assay are cross-reacting with type-I IFNs or other heat-stable antigens produced by IBV-infected cells, we tested the effect of heat inactivation. Chicken splenocytes were cultured for 48 h in the presence of different stimuli, the supernatants were collected and part of the samples heatinactivated at 65°C for 30 min. We tested all the samples using a commercial ELISA for chIFN-γ detection (Fig. 4) . After heat-inactivation, ChIFN-γ levels in the supernatants decreased significantly when compared to untreated supernatants, confirming that the observed signal was indeed specific for ChIFN-γ and not due to cross-reactivity with type-I IFNs or other heat-stable Fig. 1 .

Splenocytes were added to ChIFN-γ-coated wells and stimulated for 48 h with medium, ConA (10 μg/ml), PMA (100 ng/ml) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml), MHV (10 6 pfu), FIPV (10 6 pfu), IBV M41 (10 5 EID 50 ), or UV-inactivated IBV M41 (IBV-UV, 13 dpi; 10 5 EID 50 ). Spot counts represent the number of ChIFN-γ secreting cells. Each bar represents the average of three samples per chicken, plus standard deviation. Fig. 2 . ELISPOT assay to measure ChIFN-γ. Splenocytes of an unvaccinated (black bars) and an IBV-and NDV-vaccinated White Leghorn chicken (white bars) were stimulated in triplicate with three different doses of untreated or UV-inactivated IBV M41 or NDV. Bars marked with ⁎ show a significant difference (p b 0.05) between vaccinated and unvaccinated birds. Bars marked with 'a' show a significant difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated birds on the one hand and the unstimulated controls on the other.

Bars marked with ⁎ are significantly different (p b 0.05). proteins. Based on ChIFN-γ standard curves, before heat inactivation the ChIFN-γ levels were around 200-250 pg/ml, whereas after inactivation these levels dropped below the detection limit. To ensure that the induction of ChIFN-γ was not due to contaminating components derived from the allantois fluid in which the virus was grown or from the production process, the virus was purified with a sucrose gradient and tested in an ELISPOT assay. Splenocytes from four IBV-uninfected chickens were stimulated with purified and unpurified IBV (Fig. 5) . A fraction of the sucrose gradient obtained from outside the IBV band and allantois fluid from an IBVuninfected egg (10 × diluted in PBS) were also included. All splenocyte cultures showed a significant increase in ChIFN-γ production after stimulation with IBV M41 before and after sucrose-purification, with no significant differences between them. Incubation with a fraction of the sucrose gradient obtained from outside the IBV band ('residue') and with IBV-free allantois fluid did show any effect. We therefore conclude that the increase in ChIFN-γ production is caused by the IBV itself and not by other components. To study the kinetics with which IFN-γ was induced, we performed quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) for detection of ChIFN-γ mRNA in commercial broilers (Fig. 6 ) and layer chickens (Fig. 7) . Both layers and broilers show increased ChIFN-γ mRNA expression after IBV stimulation. An increase in ChIFN-γ mRNA expression was detected as early as 2 h after stimulation with virulent IBV M41 and with IBV vaccine strain H120 in splenocytes of layer birds.
