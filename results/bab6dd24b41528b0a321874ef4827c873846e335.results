Of the 400 Ebola survivors invited to participate, 376 consented, of which 358 fully completed the questionnaire. Table 1 shows the demographic and health-related characteristics between users and non-users of T&CM among Ebola survivors. More than half Ebola survivors were between the ages of 18-34 years (n = 194, 54.2%) and close to two thirds were females (n = 223, 62.3%). Moreover, close to three-quarters perceived their current health to be fair/poor (n = 262, 73.2%). Table 2 shows that close to half of the survivors (n = 163, 45.5%) had used T&CM since their discharge from an Ebola treatment centre. Moreover, less than a quarter of survivors (n = 62, 17.3%) used both conventional medicine and T&CM concurrently. Herbal medicine (n = 136, 83.4%) is the most common type of T&CM used among T&CM users. Table 3 shows the attitudes towards use of T&CM by Ebola survivors. More than two thirds of participants (n = 257, 71.8%) believe that T&CM is 'natural'. Approximately three-quarters of survivors are of the view that T&CM needs to be tested for safety/side-effects and more than half (n = 213, 59.5%) report knowledge about the evidence of T&CM as important to them. In addition, the majority of Ebola survivors (n = 313, 87.4%) believe medical doctors should be able to advise patients about T&CM. On the other hand, more than half (n = 218, 60.9%) did not perceive T&CM as having fewer side effects than conventional medicine. Furthermore, more than two thirds (n = 250, 69.8%) did not perceive T&CM as promoting a holistic approach to health. In addition, less than one quarter (n = 73, 20.4%) perceived a T&CM practitioner as providing more support to their patients than a medical doctor. Table 4 outlines the association between T&CM use and individual attitudes of Ebola survivors. Attitude statements such as T&CM is more natural than conventional medicine (p < 0.001), T&CM boosts my immune system/resistance (p < 0.001), my personal experience of the effectiveness of T&CM is more important than clinical evidence (p < 0.001), T&CM gives me more control over my health/body (p < 0.001), I find it easier to talk to a T&CM practitioner than a medical doctor (p < 0.001) and T&CM has fewer side-effects than conventional medicine (p < 0.001) are associated with T&CM use. No statistical difference was observed between T&CM users and non-users for the remaining attitude statements. Backward stepwise logistic regression (Table 5) found that survivors who agreed that T&CM boosts their immune system/resistance were 3.89 (95%CI: 1.57-9.63, p = 0.003) times more likely to use T&CM than those that disagreed. Ebola survivors who agreed with the statement that T&CM has fewer side effects than CM were 5.03 (95%CI: 1.92-13.19, p = 0.001) times more likely to use T&CM than those who disagreed. Ebola survivors were 13.72 (95%CI: 6.10-30.84, p < 0.001) times more likely to use T&CM if they considered important their personal experience of the effectiveness of T&CM than clinical evidence. In addition, survivors who believe that T&CM gives them more control over their health/body were 4.15 (95%CI: 1.74-9.89, p = 0.001) times more likely to be T&CM users as opposed to those who disagreed with this statement.
