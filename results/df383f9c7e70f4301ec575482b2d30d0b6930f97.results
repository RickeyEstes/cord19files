An internal region in the ectodomain of Sendai virus F1 protein is homologous to known fusion peptides In order to identify new regions, apart from the N-terminal fusion peptide, which could be involved in the actual fusion process, we screened the extracellular domain of the Sendai virus F1 protein for segments with homology to known fusion peptides. We found a 13-residue segment (amino acids 214-226) highly homologous to the HIV-1 gp41 (amino acids 8-20) and RSV F1 (amino acids 1-13) fusion peptides (Figure 1(a) ). In order to determine the role of the fusion peptide-like segment in the process of membrane fusion, we synthesized a peptide corresponding to amino acids 208-229 of the Sendai virus F1 protein, namely SV-208, (Figure 1 (b) and (c)) and compared its fusogenic ability to that of the N-terminal fusion peptide from the same protein (amino acids 117-149). Since the fusion peptide-like sequence is located in the interior of the F1 protein, a peptide elongated seven amino acids to the N terminus, SV-201, was also synthesized. A peptide with the same amino acid composition as SV-208, but with the fusion peptide-like sequence scrambled, namely Mu-SV-208, and one that partially overlaps its N terminus (amino acids 178-210), namely SV-178, were used as controls. The internal fusion peptide induces lipid mixing to a higher extent than the N-terminal fusion peptide The fusogenic activity of the peptides was determined by their ability to cause lipid mixing of large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) composed of PC/PG (1:1) (100 nm diameter) as revealed by the probe dilution assay (Struck et al., 1981) . Brie¯y, a population of LUV labeled both with NBD-PE and Rho-PE (22 mM) is mixed with a population of unlabeled LUV (88 mM) and different concentrations of peptides are added. Fusion between the labeled and unlabeled vesicles caused by the pep-tide results in dilution of the labeled lipids and therefore reduced energy transfer between NBD-PE and Rho-PE. This change is visualized as an increase of NBD¯uorescence. The dependence of both the extent and the kinetics of lipid mixing on the lipid to peptide molar ratio were analyzed. In separate experiments, increasing amounts of SV-208, SV-201, Mu-SV-208, SV-178, and the N-terminal fusion peptide, were added to a ®xed amount of vesicles. In order to compare the activity of the different peptides, the percentage of lipid mixing as a function of the lipid to peptide molar ratio is shown in Figure 2 (a). Clearly, SV-208 is more active than the N-terminal fusion peptide in inducing lipid mixing of model membranes. Elongation of SV-208 does not affect its activity, suggesting that the ability of SV-208 to induce membrane fusion is not related to the N-terminal proximity of the fusion peptide-like sequence in the synthetic peptide. On the contrary, the scrambled peptide and SV-178 are substantially less active, indicating that the fusogenic activity depends on the peptide sequence. Furthermore, a peptide corresponding to the homologous region from measles virus was also active (unpublished results), suggesting a similar role for the homologous region in different paramyxoviruses. Similar results were observed with PC/PS (1:1) LUV and therefore are not shown. Time pro®les depicted in Figure 2 (b) show that maximal activities were reached at about ®ve minutes.
