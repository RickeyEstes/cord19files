To determine whether MA confers Gag assembly when substituted for NC, we constructed a set of HIV-1 expression vectors by replacing NC with MA or switching the NC and MA domains. The MAII shown in Fig. 1 contains a MA insertion in the deleted NC region and the NCII contains a NC replacement for the MA domain. NC and/or MA were removed either alone or in combination from the wt and abovedescribed constructs, yielding constructs ΔMA, ΔNC, NC/ΔNC, ΔMA/ MA, and ΔMN. The backbone of all constructs is a replication-defective HIV-1 expression vector, HIVgpt (Page et al., 1990) . Each mutant was transiently expressed in 293T cells and subjected to Western immunoblot analysis to determine VLP assembly and processing capability. Our results indicate that neither VLP budding nor VLP processing was significantly affected following the removal of the MA central globular domain (ΔMA, Fig. 2A, lane 4) or the insertion of NC into the deleted MA region (NCII, lane 5). In contrast, mutations involving either the removal of NC (ΔNC, NC/ΔNC, ΔMN) or the replacement of NC with MA (MAII, NC/MA, ΔMA/MA) markedly affected VLP production (lanes 3 and 6-10). The PR-mediated Gag processing of mutants NC/ΔNC and NC/MA was also significantly defectivespecifically, their cellular and VLP-associated p24gag were both barely detectable. A simple explanation for the impaired Gag processing is mutation-induced conformational changes that block cleavage sites from accessing the PR. However, in the cases of ΔNC and MAII, substantial amounts of cellular p24gag were observed but VLP-associated p24gag was barely detected, with unprocessed mutant precursors representing the major Gag species in the medium samples (lanes 3 and 6 vs. lanes 13 and 16). A plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that mutant VLPs containing processed Gag are unstable and tend to disassemble once plasma membrane budding occurs. Similar phenotypes have been observed with some HIV-1 NC mutants (Dawson and Yu, 1998; Wang et al., 2004) . Since PR-mediated Gag processing may affect VLP production level, we reexamined the ability of each mutant to assemble and release VLPs by expressing each mutant in a PR-inactivated backbone. Our results (Figs. 2B and C) suggest that PR inactivation does not significantly improve VLP production: all mutants lacking an intact NC domain produced VLPs at levels less than 50% that of wt, with MAII, NC/MA, NC/ΔNC, and ΔMA/MA all producing less than 20% of wt. In other words, MA as a substitute for NC fails to rescue the NC deletion assembly defect, regardless of whether or not a NC is present in the deleted MA region. Further, the results suggest that the specific position of NC is crucial to virus assembly. Note that ΔMN was capable of assembling and releasing VLPs at a slightly higher level than those mutants having a MA or NC inserted at the deleted NC or MA region (Figs. 2A and B, lane 10 vs. lanes 6-9). This suggests that Gag multimerization, which is primarily driven by the CA-SP1 sequence, may be somewhat disturbed following the repositioning of MA (or NC) in the deleted NC (or MA) region. Steric hindrance induced by the repositioned MA or NC is a possible explanation for the impaired Gag assembly. Most assembly-defective mutants show a reduced membrane binding capacity Since cell membrane binding is required for efficient Gag assembly, we examined whether the mutations had any effect on Gag membrane binding capacity by subjecting cell lysates from either wt or mutant transfectants to membrane flotation centrifugation. A non-myristylated mutant (myr−) previously shown as being severely defective in membrane binding and incapable of directing VLP assembly and budding (Bryant and Ratner, 1990 ) served as a control. As expected, poor myr− Gag cell membrane binding was observedthat is, approximately 20% of total cellular Gag was membraneassociated, compared to over 70% of wt Gag (Fig. 3) . Results from a statistical analysis indicate that all mutants whose mutations involved a deletion of NC or a replacement of NC with MA exhibited significantly lower membrane binding ability compared to wt (Fig. 3B) . The exception to this rule is ΔMN, which did not show a significantly reduced membrane binding capacity compared with wt (p = 0.07). For most mutants, their reduced membrane binding capacities may partly account for their defects in VLP assembly and budding. Remarkably, the NCII showed a membrane binding capacity higher than that of wt at a statistically significant level, demonstrating a good correlation between Gag assembly and membrane binding ability. ΔMA contains a replacement of 106 codons by 4 codons, with myristylation and MA/CA cleavage signal retained. Ten HIV-1 NC residues remain in the deleted region of ΔNC. Arrows indicate SP1-NC and NC-SP2 junction sites. Remaining HIV-1 NC residues in deleted regions are underlined. Italics indicate altered or foreign amino acid residues inserted at junctions. MA sequence inserted in deleted NC region consists of 100 residues (codons 18 to 117). Mutant capabilities for directing VLP assembly and release are summarized as follows: ++++, release efficiency comparable to wt (≧90% of wt); +++, efficiency 70-90% of wt; ++, efficiency 40-70% of wt; +, efficiency below 20% of wt. We also performed indirect immunofluorescence tests to determine the subcellular distribution of each mutant. Results indicate that cells expressing wt Gag had heterogeneous cytoplasmic staining and perinuclear rings, while Gag mutants lacking MA or with mutations involving a replacement of MA with NC were mostly localized in the perinuclear area (data not shown). In general, the subcellular distribution patterns did not completely correlate with the ability to direct virus particle assembly and budding.
