Ninety-five and 243 VLBW infants were admitted to the NICU during phase 1 and phase 2, respectively, of the study over a total period of 69 months, and of whom 56 and 126 infants with moderately severe gastrointestinal dysmotility were enrolled, respectively. The schematic flow chart revealed details of the recruitment process ( Figure 1 ). Ninety-one infants received oral erythromycin, and an equal number received the placebo solution. The clinical characteristics of the groups are summarized in Table 1 . All clinical features except the oxygenation index at 12 hours of life were comparable between the 2 groups. Erythromycin-treated infants had significantly higher oxygenation index than placebo infants in the immediate perinatal period (P ϭ .04; Table 1 ). The clinical outcomes are summarized in Table 2 . The incidence of PNAC was significantly higher in the placebo (37/91 infants) than in the oral erythromycin group (18/91 infants, P ϭ .003). Investigations for cholestatic jaundice indicated that 1 infant in the placebo group was infected with cytomegalovirus, and the infant had positive urinary excretion of the virus, and another infant in the oral erythromycin group failed the 99m Tc HIDA scan and was suspected to have biliary atresia. The parents of the latter infant refused operative cholangiography and liver biopsy, but the patient recovered uneventfully after achieving full enteral feeding and discontinuation of parenteral nutrition. The inclusion or exclusion of these 2 cases did not significantly alter the overall outcome of PNAC. Although the overall maximum serum total bili-rubin and conjugated bilirubin concentrations did not differ significantly between groups, the maximum serum alanine aminotransferase concentration was significantly higher in infants receiving the placebo solution (P ϭ .04; Table 2 ). Significantly more placebo infants (23/91 infants) had abnormally elevated serum alanine aminotransferase concentration (normal range, Ͻ53 IU/L) compared with erythromycin-treated patients (11/91 infants; P ϭ .036). The mixed-effects models 35 were used to analyze the longitudinal data on feeding after adjustment for the first day of milk introduction. The results indicated that VLBW infants were able to achieve half, three-quarters, and full enteral nutrition (mean [
