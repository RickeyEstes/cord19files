Of the 422 questionnaires distributed, 391 (92.7%) were returned, and 374 (88.6%) had been completed. The average age of the HCWs was 36.2 years (range, 19-64). The majority was female (84.0%) and working as a nurse (62.8%). Most HCWs (82.1%) reported to have experienced PI, and 48.7% had experienced exposure by contact of nonintact skin during their work lifetime. On average, they had almost 2 episodes of exposure in the preceding year (Table 1) . PI was the major threat in all job categories. The leading causes of PI were injuries by suture needle (40.6%) in doctors, by hypodermic needles (75.7%) and syringe needles (56.6%) in nurses, and by hypodermic needles (32.6%) in technicians. Nurses experienced significantly more PI, nonintact skin contact, and exposure episodes than doctors and technicians (P < .001). Of all HCWs, only half reported to have correctly practiced the procedures regarding the disposal of sharp objects (53.2%). Compliance with regard to the wearing of PPE other than gloves was low (less than 50%) ( Table 2) . Overall, the HCWs followed an average of 5.3 of the 8 guidelines (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.1-5.5). Less than half of all HCWs indicated that they were aware of the guideline (46.8%) or had ever been trained on related knowledge (43.6%). Regression analyses of compliance score demonstrated that compliance was higher in nurses (b nurses Â¼ 1.24; 95% CI:
