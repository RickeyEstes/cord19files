Define HLA-A * 0201-restricted epitopes of N and S proteins of SARS-CoV by T2-cell binding assay We screened the amino acid sequences of N and S proteins of SARS-CoV and used HLA peptide binding predictions offered by the National Institute of Health (NIH) (http://thr.cit.nih.gov/molbio/hla-bind/) to determine the potential CTL epitopes by estimating dissociation half-life from MHC class I molecules. Ten each potential N-and S-specific HLA-A2-binding peptides along with the positive and negative control peptides were then synthesized (Supplement Table 1 ) and subjected to a T2-cell binding assay for validating the binding affinity of HLA-A2.1. The tyrosine-derived peptide YMDGTMSQV served as a positive control [9] , and the HLA-A1-binding peptide EADPTGHSY (MAGE-1) served as a negative control. Online database analysis and the T2-cell binding affinity assay revealed that three N peptides (N223-231, N227-235, and N317-325) (Fig. 1A) and two S peptides (S787-795 and S1042-1050) (Fig. 1B) exhibited strong binding to HLA-A2.1 molecules.
