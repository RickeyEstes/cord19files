In a direct HA test, carried out at 4 ° C, two faecal extracts from gnotobiotic calves infected with the British and the Danish isolate had titres of 32 and 256 respectively. This activity was shown to be coronavirus-specific, but could not be detected when the test was carried out at 37°C. However, in a number of extracts prepared from faecal specimens of calves in the field, non-specific activity was detected at both 4°C and 37 ° C. If faecal extracts contain specific as well as non-specific haemagglutinating activity, a direct HA test followed by a blocking assay may give false negative results, thus rendering the test useless. The temperature dependency of the coronavirus specific haemagglutinating activity was used in the HEHA test to differentiate the specific and non-specific activity in faecal extracts. All haemagglutinating activity was adsorbed from faecal extracts with a concentrated erythrocyte suspension at 4°C and specific activity was then eluted at 37 ° C. Eluates from faecal extracts, obtained from both gnotobiotic calves and calves in the field, that were coronavirus-positive by EM, contained haemagglutinating activity detectable by a direct HA assay. In general haemagglutinating activity was found neither in the supernatant after adsorption nor in the wash fluids. Haemagglutinating activity found in eluates was always coronavirus-specific. After ultracentrifu-gation of such eluates at 250,000 g for 30 rain, all haemagglutinating activity was recovered from the resuspended pellet. EM demonstrated the presence of coronavirus-like particles in the pellet (Fig. 1B) , which were morphologically identical to the particles present in faecal extracts (Fig. 1A) . Incubation of the resuspended pellet with the hyperimmune serum resulted in complete loss of haemagglutinating activity and virus-antibody aggregates could be observed by EM (Fig. 1C) . To investigate the potential use of the HEHA as a diagnostic tool, the excretion profiles of two experimentally infected calves were analysed. The calf infected with the British isolate had loose yellow faeces on days 4 and 5 after inoculation. All faecal samples were examined with the HEHA and with EM. The results are presented in Fig. 2A . Faecal samples were scored positive with the HEHA on days 2 through 5. Ultracentrifugation of the eluates at 250,000 g for 30 min and resuspension of the pellets in one-fifteenth of the original volume resulted in higher HEHA titres and one more faecal sample was scored positive. All positive results were confirmed by the blocking assay. Only one faecal sample (day 4) was scored positive by EM and IEM. The calf inoculated with the Dutch isolate developed severe diarrhoea on day 1 which lasted until death on day 3. Coronavirus antigens were detected in the faecal extracts 24 h after inoculation, with HEHA ( Fig. 2B ) as well as with EM. Ultracentrifugation of the eluates resulted in higher HEHA titres; however, no additional samples were scored positive. Again all haemagglutinating activity was shown to be specific. From the 39 faecal Samples obtained from 10 calves in the field, five samples from two calves were scored positive by HEHA.
