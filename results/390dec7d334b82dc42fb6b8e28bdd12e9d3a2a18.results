Growth of rats fed the AIN-76A diets over the g-week period was the same as that of rats fed the control cereal-based diet (Fig.  1) . Food efficiency and daily weight gain for animals in all four groups (Table 1) were similar. Liver/body weight ratios of the animals fed the AIN-76A diet for 1 to 8 weeks were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than ratios for rats fed the control diet (Fig. 2) . Percentage liver-body weight ratios (mean +-SEM) for rats fed the choline-devoid diet and sacrificed after 1 or 2 weeks were 6.4 + 0.4 and 7.1 + 0.3, respectively. These ratios were higher than those found for rats maintained on any of the AIN-76A diets or on the control diet for 8 weeks. The six rats TYPE OF DIET
