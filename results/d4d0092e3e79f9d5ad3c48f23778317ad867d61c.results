The microbial community of mule deer lymph nodes Detection of protein-coding and ribosomal RNA transcripts provides strong support for the presence of viable and replicating microorganisms. Therefore, we enriched the total RNA obtained from lymph nodes for poly(A) + RNA to prepare cDNA libraries and subjected them to pyrosequencing on a Roche GS FLX sequencer (Roche-454 Life Sciences). Properties of sequencing runs are given in Table S1 . All reads were compared against the nonredundant NCBI protein database. The composite metatranscriptomic species profile for five individual and two pools of 4 or 8 mule deer samples, determined using the software MEGAN [32] , is depicted in Fig. 1A . On average, 51% of total transcript-tags could be assigned to known taxa with a bit score cutoff of 50 (see Table S2 ). Of the assigned tags, 99.3% were of eukaryotic origin, predominantly matching to Bos taurus and other close relatives of mule deer that are represented in the protein database. Approximately 0.3% of the assigned tags were to bacteria. Proteobacteria represented 60% of all bacterial hits; Enterobacteriaceae in the Gammaproteobacteria were the most commonly identified within this group. Firmicutes and Actinobacteria represented 22% and 5% of the identified bacterial taxa. Table S3 lists all bacterial genera detected in the seven data sets. Transcripts assigned to Archaea, family Halobacteriaceae, were identified in both pooled samples but none of the individual libraries. Only 37 transcripts were assigned to viruses. Twenty-nine of these matched to the Retroviridae and Poxviridae while the remaining were to phages, insect viruses, and a single assignment to herpesvirus. These results suggest that representatives of many bacterial phyla, archaea, and two major virus families are transcriptionally active in mule deer retropharyngeal lymph nodes. Meta-genomics studies evaluating microbial rich communities were pioneered based on genomic DNA sequences [8] [9] [10] 13] . Thus, we compared genomic libraries prepared from retropharyngeal lymph node tissue of MD 72360, MD 80228, MD 84709, and MD 84730 with our data from transcript libraries derived from those animals (Fig. 1 ). Many sequences from the genomic DNA libraries were to non-coding regions and could not be used for taxonomic profiling (Fig 1B, Table S2 ). Based on proteincoding sequences, only four bacterial genera were identified in the comprehensive MEGAN analysis of the four genomic data sets. Xylella and Burkholderia were identified in MD 72360, Acidovorax was found in MD 84709, and Bartonella was found in both MD 84709 and MD 84730. Bartonella and Xylella, as well as a member of the beta retroviruses (found in MD 80228 and MD 84709), were identified only in the genomic DNA data, suggesting that they might not represent actively replicating organisms. These findings indicate that meta-transcriptomics may be the preferred method for detecting the viable endemic microbial community in the tissues of healthy animals. The most commonly detected microorganisms in the transcriptome libraries comprised intestinal and skin-dwelling bacteria and soil and freshwater bacteria. Ruminococcus, which is part of the commensal intestinal microbial community of ungulates, was detected in all seven libraries ( Fig. 1A and Table S3 ). Other bacteria found in at least three of the seven data sets were Propionibacterium, a commensal bacterium of skin and the gastrointestinal tract, and the environmental soil or water inhabitants Magnetospirillum, Streptomyces and Pseudomonas. Members of the latter genus are able to colonize a wide range of niches and are also potential pathogens. Other animal and human pathogenic genera detected in at least three different libraries were Burkholderia, Streptococcus, Flavobacteria, and members of the Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia, Providencia). The overall bacterial diversity and the number of unique transcripts assigned to each bacterial taxon varied among the samples. Notably, Helicobacter was only detected in the library constructed from MD 257 but there were 12 unique transcript-tags assigned to this genus. More commonly, bacterial taxon identification was based on a single tag. Many of the single transcript-tags came from MD 80228, which had the highest bacterial diversity profile of all libraries analyzed, and from MD 84730. Bacterial genera detected solely in either one or both of these two samples include Acinetobacter, Legionella, Enterobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia, Vibrio, Listeria, Mannheimia, and members of the Corynebacterineae, all of which contain known pathogens. In addition, both specimens depicted by far the highest numbers of reads taxonomically assigned to the family Enterobacteriaceae. The lowest diversity of bacterial genera was found in the MD OCT-pool, which was derived from eight different mule deer. Pooling RNA from several animals potentially increases the representation of transcripts common to all animals but might decrease the ability to detect transcripts that are unique to one animal. Consistent with this, the MD Bonner-pool, which was derived from four animals, provided a broader spectrum of bacterial genera than the MD OCT-pool. Thus, pooling samples did not improve our ability to detect microbial diversity in lymph node samples. In contrast, viruses were detected in both pooled samples, although the total number of transcript-tags was low. Of the individual libraries, only MD 257 had evidence of viral transcripts (Fig. 1A) . The majority of viral transcripts were from a cervid poxvirus [33] , and a novel gamma retrovirus.
