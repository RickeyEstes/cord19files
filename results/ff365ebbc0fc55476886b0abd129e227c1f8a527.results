our literature search identified 575 unique references (Fig. 1) . Six met the selection criteria defined a priori (see Appendix 1). 9,11,36-39 We contacted the authors of two studies 9,11 reporting logistic regression with a > 5 µg/l blood ion cut-point for additional data. these six studies included a total of 898 hips, of which 376 had an ARmD. the prevalence of ARmDs ranged from 29% to 69%, and the prevalence of symptoms ranged from 23.6% to 100% (Figs 2f and 2g , Appendices 3, 4, 5, 6). Studies differed in the blood fraction tested, ion measured and cut-point used. only 50% of studies 36, 38, 39 used mARS mRI as the benchmark for diagnosis. only one study 36 used blood ion levels in a diagnostic context (symptomatic patients) whereas the remaining four studies 9,11,37,39 used blood ion levels in a screening (undifferentiated patients) context. the three studies 9,11,37 not using mARS mRI were deemed at risk of bias (table I, Fig. 2c, Appendix 3) . two studies 36,37 used plasma, rather than serum, for ion testing and were therefore deemed to have concerns regarding applicability (table I, see also Appendix 3). No study described the time interval between ion testing and imaging, and therefore all were deemed to have concerns regarding applicability (table I, see also Appendix 3). All studies were of either level I or level II quality. 40 prior to proceeding with meta-analysis, we investigated whether clinical, methodological and quality variability manifested in heterogeneity in the estimates of diagnostic accuracy obtained from each study. Study-specific estimates of specificity and sensitivity all appear to lie close to a common smooth RoC curve (Fig. 2a) , however, there appeared to be variability in the performance of specific cut-points across different studies (Fig.  2b) . this suggests that the discriminative capacity of the ion test is homogeneous across studies but that there is substantial cut-point heterogeneity. the cut-point heterogeneity may be due to heterogeneity in the benchmark modality used: the studies reporting unexpectedly high specificity and low sensitivity at 5 µg/l and 7 µg/l cutpoints did not exclusively use mARS mRI as the benchmark (Fig. 2c) . Sample size, ARmD prevalence, prevalence of symptomatic patients, and ion test characteristics were not associated with cut-point heterogeneity (Figs 2d, 2e, 2f and 2g). Given the homogeneity in discrimination capacity but implicit cut-point heterogeneity we pursued SRoC meta-analysis without meta-analysing cut-points (see Appendix 2) . our best estimate of the "true" RoC curve for metal ion test is the mean SRoC curve plotted in Figure 3 . However, due to random variability the "truth" may not be the same in all studies. Accounting for this random variability, we have 95% confidence that the study-specific "truth" will lie within the 95% prediction region. the prediction and credible regions have similar widths, which further supported minimal heterogeneity. the area under the curve (AUC) for the SRoC curve was 0.615 (95% CI 0.480 to 0.735), thus we can state that the probability that metal ion testing is actually clinically useful with AUC ≥ 0.75 is 1.7% (see Appendix 2) . 41 Due to implicit cut-point heterogeneity, we did not perform meta-analysis of cut-point performance (see Appendix 2) . therefore, the SRoC curve in Figure 3 does not relate cut-points to a particular specificity and sensitivity. However, diagnostic performance at any given cutpoint will lie somewhere on the SRoC curve in Figure 3 -we just do not know where. Hence, our meta-analysis can be used to evaluate the overall performance of ion tests, without reference to a particular cut point.
