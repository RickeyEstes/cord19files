Sampling was done during the winter and spring of 2015 and 2016 at cafés near sites of MERS-CoV emergence. Repeated sampling was pursued at sites where MERS-CoV cases were continuously recorded. Two types of tobacco are consumed in cafés: Moassel, a paste containing molasses, flavoured tobacco, and glycerol mixture was widely used and preferred by most customers, especially youth and women; and Jurak, a paste containing fermented tobacco leaves, fermented minced fruits, molasses, and glycerol, that was preferred by the elderly males. Moassel is used in small sized waterpipes that require a short hose ($1 m). Some moassel consumers reuse hoses used by others consumers; however, others, bring their own hoses or purchase a one-time-use hose. Jurak consumers invariably employ reusable, long (3 m) leather hoses. Sampling efforts included both types of hoses. The majority of samples were collected from Moassel waterpipe hoses. During the collection visits at various sites, we noted that all sampled hoses were moist at both ends of the hoses. A total of 2489 waterpipe samples were collected from the following cities: Riyadh (561) (88). Samples were screened by RT-qPCR for MERS-CoV using the upE primer/probe set. The screening results for samples from both types of waterpipes representing several regions within Saudi Arabia were negative for the presence of MERS-CoV RNA (Table 1) .
