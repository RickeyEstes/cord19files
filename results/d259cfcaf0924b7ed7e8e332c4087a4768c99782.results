The in vitro adhesion assay revealed that the villi of all piglets in Group 1 and Group 2, of 6 of the 9 piglets in Group 3 and of 5 of the 8 piglets in the control group (Group C) were susceptible to adhesion of K88ac ETEC (Table  2 ) . Only data of susceptible piglets were included in the results. The infected piglets developed severe diarrhoea, whereas some started vomiting. All piglets slaughtered 2-5 days after the TGE virus infection (Groups 1 and 2) were severely dehydrated and markedly depressed. In the other infected piglets, faecal fluid loss and dehydration seemed to be less pronounced and recovery occurred 5-6 days after the virus challenge. These piglets were killed 7 days after TGE virus inoculation (6 days after the ETEC inoculation; Group 3). At that time only one piglet showed diarrhoea. One of the control piglets spontaneously developed diarrhoea during the observation period, which was still present at necropsy. The other control piglets remained healthy. Mean villus height and crypt depth in jejunum and ileum of K88ac-suscep- tible piglets in the different groups are illustrated in Fig. 1 . In Group 1, a significant villus atrophy occurred in the caudal jejunum, whereas in the ileum a similar but not significant villus atrophy was observed. Villi or villus tips were covered with cuboidal enterocytes. Patchy to continuous attachment of coliform bacteria to villi was observed in the jejunum of 4 piglets and the ileum of 3 piglets of Group 1. In one piglet no adhesion of bacteria to jejunal and ileal villi was observed. In intestinal segments where adhesion was absent, villi were extremely short, less than 120 pm. In the other small intestinal segments, villus length was above 180 Mm. Four to five days after the TGE virus infection (3-4 days after the ETEC infection; Group 2) villi were still slightly shortened (Fig. 1 ) . Villus enterocytes were low to high columnar. A patchy bacterial adherence with irregularly arranged groups of bacteria of various sizes occurred in the jejunum of one piglet and the ileum of all 3 piglets. In piglets killed 7 days after the TGE virus infection (6 days after the ETEC infection; Group 3), villi were almost as high as in contrel piglets (Fig. 1 ) . Villus enterocytes were high columnar. No bacterial adhesion was observed. In the control group, on the contrary, multifocal adhesion of coliform bacteria was observed on villi in 2 piglets. One had diarrhoea when euthanatized, the other was healthy. A slight villus atrophy was observed in both piglets. The other control piglets had long slender villi covered with high columnar enterocytes. Crypt depth did not differ significantly between the 4 groups (Fig. 1 ) .

Piglets of Group 1 (n=6), Group 2 (n=3) and Group 3 (n=6) were euthanatized 2-3, 4-5 and 7 days after TGE virus challenge, respectively.
