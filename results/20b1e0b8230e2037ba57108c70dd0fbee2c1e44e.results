The G2 Epitope Is Confined Solely to the S1-NTD We conducted surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments to characterize the interaction between G2 Fab and MERS-CoV S1-NTD ( Figure 1A ), as well as the interaction between G2 Fab and the prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV S ectodomain (MERS-CoV S-2P) (Pallesen et al., 2017) ( Figure 1B) . The affinities of G2 Fab for S1-NTD and MERS-CoV S-2P were very similar, with K D s of 28.0 and 30.3 nM, respectively. The binding kinetics were also in good agreement, indicating that the G2 epitope is confined to the S1-NTD. To more precisely localize the G2 epitope on the S1-NTD, we performed in vitro selection for G2-escape variants by serial passage of recombinant MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012 in Vero 81 cell cultures (Scobey et al., 2013) supplemented with progressively escalating concentrations of G2 immunoglobulin G (IgG). After 10 passages, 15 G2-resistant MERS-CoV isolates were plaque cloned and the mutations were analyzed. All 15 clones contained either an S28F or G198D substitution (Table S1), suggesting that these two residues are crucial for G2 binding. To test this hypothesis, we generated MERS-CoV S-2P variants harboring the S28F or G198D substitutions. SPR measurements revealed that the S28F or G198D substitutions completely abolished binding to G2 Fab at the concentrations tested ( Figures 1C and 1D ). We next generated pseudotyped lentiviruses bearing the mutant MERS-CoV S glycoproteins (S28F or G198D) to assess the effect of these substitutions on the neutralizing activity of G2 IgG. As expected, G2 IgG potently neutralized pseudoviruses bearing wild-type (WT) S protein, whereas G2 IgG poorly neutralized the pseudoviruses harboring the escape mutations, with a maximum neutralized fraction below 45% ( Figure 1E ). We additionally verified the neutralizing ability of G2 IgG against the recombinant MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012 (Almazá n et al., 2013) and the G198D variant in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) setting. G2 IgG neutralized authentic MERS-CoV with an EC 50 = 0.12 nM, whereas the ability of G2 IgG to neutralize the G198D variant was barely detectable until we raised the concentration to 10 mM ( Figure 1F ). These results indicate that the G2 epitope is localized to a surface on the S1-NTD near residues Ser28 and Gly198. The G2 Epitope Is Primarily Localized to Two Loops at the Top of S1-NTD To precisely define the G2 epitope, we determined the crystal structures of G2 Fab alone and in complex with MERS-CoV S1-NTD. G2 Fab formed crystals in space group P2 1 that diffracted X-rays to 2.1-Å resolution. Phasing by molecular replacement revealed four Fab molecules per asymmetric unit. After iterative rounds of model building and refinement, the final model had an R/R free = 18.1%/22.5% (Table S2 ). Crystallization of G2 Fab in complex with the S1-NTD proved difficult and necessitated exploration of different expression and purification strategies. Ultimately, crystals of the complex were obtained in space group P2 1 that diffracted X-rays to 2.3-Å resolution. The molecular replacement solution contained two molecules of the complex per asymmetric unit, and iterative rounds of model building and refinement produced a final model with an R/R free = 18.0%/21.3%. The structure of the MERS-CoV S1-NTD is similar to that of other coronaviruses and can be separated into top, core, and bottom regions ( Figure 2A ). The MERS-CoV S1-NTD core contains a b sandwich structure formed by two b sheets containing a total of 11 b strands ( Figure 2B , labeled b1-b11), providing a scaffold to support the top and bottom regions. Stretching out from b5, a loop (residues 189-202) designated loop2 spirals 540 perpendicularly to the b sheet, like a right-handed pseudo-helix, and comprises the majority of the G2 binding interface (384 Å 2 ). A disulfide bond between Cys30 and Cys195 connects loop2 with an N-terminal loop (residues 18-33) designated loop1, which contributes the remaining binding interface with G2 (295 Å 2 ) ( Figures 2B and 2C) . Four of the six G2 complementarity-determining regions (CDRH1, CDRH2, CDRH3, and CDRL3) are involved in binding to the S1-NTD ( Figure 2D ). CDRL3 interacts with loop1, whereas the heavy-chain CDRs interact with loop2, except for one hydrogen bond formed between CDRH3 residue Ser97 and S1-NTD loop1 residue Ser28. G2 heavy-chain residues Tyr33, Thr54, and Ser97 form hydrogen bonds with main-chain atoms on loop2, whereas heavy-chain residues Trp50 and Tyr52 interact with side chains of loop1 residues Ser191 and Asn199, respectively. The interaction between the G2 light chain and loop1 is mediated by three residues on CDRL3 (Ser91, Glu92, and Glu93) and two residues on loop1 (Lys27 and Ser28). Loop1 residue Lys27 forms two salt bridges with Glu92 and Glu93 on CDRL3, whereas Ser28 forms hydrogen bonds with main-chain atoms of CDRL3 residues Ser91 and Glu92. There are eight N-linked glycosylation sites within the S1-NTD. As the crystallized protein was not treated with glycosidases, electron density for large glycan moieties can be observed on several glycosylation sites. However, none of these glycosylation sites are within the G2 binding interface ( Figure S1A ). Thus, it is unlikely that G2 binding is dependent on the presence of N-linked glycans. To verify, SPR studies confirmed that deglycosylated S1-NTD retained a similar affinity to G2 as glycosylated S1-NTD ( Figure S1B ). The structure is consistent with the G2-escape data, which showed that MERS-CoV cultured under G2 selection accumulates substitutions S28F and G198D at the G2 binding interface (Table S1 ). Based on the structure, we predict that the S28F substitution would largely eliminate the hydrophilic interactions between loop1 and CDRL3. The G198D substitution would introduce a long side chain leading to a steric clash that would impair the interaction. In addition to these two escape mutations, we further probed the interface by introducing single mutations K27A or S191A into the S1-NTD. As expected from the structure, either of these two substitutions largely abolished the binding to G2 Fab ( Figure S2A ).
