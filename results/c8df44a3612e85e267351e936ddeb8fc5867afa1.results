We use our mathematical models to demonstrate how the timing of an intervention can impact • total attack rate, • peak prevalence, and • time of peak. These are expected to be good measures of the total impact on the population or the burden on the health services. We find that one-shot interventions that begin at the first sign of infection have little effect on the final outcome beyond delaying it. This is because the intervention blocks few transmissions because only a few individuals are infected when the intervention is implemented. When the restrictions are lifted, the disease eventually spreads again in an almost fully susceptible population, and its trajectory is for all practical purposes the same, just delayed. In contrast if the intervention is delayed to start closer to the peak of the epidemic it will be more effective. For a weakly-coupled metapopulation model, the subgroups are likely to have somewhat asynchronous epidemics. In this case it is better to implement the one-shot interventions based on a local threshold rather than a global threshold. If the coupling is stronger, the epidemics are closely synchronized and there is little difference between the strategies.
