During the sampling period, a total of 24 BioSampler and 24 PTFE filter-based cassette air samplings were collected (Table 1) . Overall, 16 (33.3%) of the 48 specimens indicated evidence of at least 1 respiratory pathogen (Table 1) , with 1 (2%) positive for influenza A virus, 3 (6%) positive for influenza B virus, and 12 (25%) positive for adenovirus. One of the 12 adenovirus-positive specimens was successfully studied for partial hexon sequencing and found to be a human adenovirus type B3. Based on the top BLASTN hit (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), the partial hexon sequence of this adenovirus-positive specimen was most similar (100% nucleotide identity) to human adenovirus 3 isolate GZ_31_2011 (accession no. KR090803). None of the 48 samples were positive for coronavirus. The public hospital yielded the most positive specimens. Among 16 samples collected, 1 (6%) was positive for influenza A virus, 2 (13%) were positive for influenza B virus, and 7 (44%) were positive for adenovirus. The public primary care clinic yielded only 1 (6%) positive adenovirus specimen. The private primary care clinic yielded 1 (6%) influenza B-positive and 3 (18%) adenovirus-positive specimens. None of the specimens cultured on MDCK cells were observed to have amplified viable virus. Among the 12 adenovirus-positive specimens, 1 yielded a hexon gene band, which when sequenced was identified as adenovirus type B3. No viable virus was observed for specimens cultured on A549 cells. Among the 24 samples collected using the BioSampler, 4 (16.67%) were positive for adenovirus. The Personal Sampler demonstrated higher rates of molecular detection with 1 (4%) influenza A-positive, 3 (12.5%) influenza B-positive, and 8 (33.33%) adenovirus-positive specimens identified. During the sampling periods, air temperatures ranged from 23.29°C to 27.46°C and the relative humidity (RH) ranged from 53.75% to 67.73% (Table 1) . Although the positive samples were sparse, there was no statistically significant difference between the mean air temperature or mean RH between groups of samples that were test-positive or test-negative for any virus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, or adenovirus.
