A total 15 cases (seven from SHHMU and eight from PUMCH) were confirmed with HAdV as the only pathogen of pneumonia. Two patients with HAdV positive samples were excluded due to possible coinfection with Legionella pneumophila and S. pneumonia respectively. All 15 patients were admitted to the ICU and fulfilled the criteria of severe CAP and of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
