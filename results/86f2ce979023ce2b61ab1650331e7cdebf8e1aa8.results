A one-step RT-PCR assay, amplifying a 416 bp fragment of the L1 gene of mammalian orthoreoviruses, showed that porcine orthoreovirus was present in 45 of 237 (19.0%) diarrheic fecal samples obtained from 40 of 78 (51.2%) pig farms throughout South Korea. Of the 45 porcine orthoreovirus-positive fecal specimens, 42 (93.3%) also tested positive for other enteric pathogens, including porcine GARV, GBRV, GCRV, PSaV, E. coli, Salmonella spp., and swine dysentery; whereas only 3 (6.7%) tested positive for the porcine orthoreovirus alone (Table 1) . Of the other enteric pathogens, GARVs were the most common, being present in 24 fecal samples. In addition, of the 192 specimens that tested negative for porcine orthoreovirus, 149 (63.0%) specimens were positive for other enteric pathogens (Table 1 ). In contrast, no enteric pathogen was detected in the remaining 43 (18.2%) fecal samples. We isolated 10 porcine orthoreovirus strains from the 45 porcine orthoreovirus-positive fecal samples. After the second or third passage of cells inoculated with viruses from diarrheic piglets, a cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed, characterized by rounded and detached cells that formed clusters. Virus-infected cells showed typical perinuclear cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, porcine orthoreovirus-specific cytoplasmic fluorescence by the direct IF test, and icosahedral, non-enveloped viral particles by TEM ( Fig. 1A-C) . The 10 strains hemagglutinated porcine (1%, v/ v) and bovine (1%, v/v) erythrocytes, but not type O human erythrocytes (1%, v/v), a finding characteristic of type 3 mammalian orthoreoviruses (Tyler, 2001) . Utilizing the 1380 bp sequence of the full-length S1 gene, we phylogenetically compared the 10 newly isolated Korean porcine orthoreovirus strains with other mammalian orthoreoviruses. Alignments showed that the new strains were type 3 mammalian orthoreoviruses. Type 3 strains can be further divided into four lineages, and our 10 Korean porcine strains formed a novel lineage IV containing one other porcine strain, T3/porcine/Sichuan/2006 (Fig. 2) . In comparison, lineage I contains the human strain T3/Human/Colorado/96, isolated in 1996; whereas lineages II and III consist of bovine and human strains isolated in 1950 and 1960, respectively. No newly isolated Korean porcine orthoreovirus was closely related to any previously described strain (Fig. 2) . The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the S1 genes of all 10 Korean porcine orthoreoviruses and other type 1-3 strains are shown in Table 2 . All 10 Korean porcine orthoreoviruses showed the highest nucleotide (97.0-98.1%) and deduced amino acid (96.4-98.2%) identities with T3/porcine/Sichuan/2006, but lower nucleotide (70.7-84.2%) and deduced amino acid (74.8-90.5%) identities with other type 3 strains originating from humans, cattle, and mice. In contrast, the 10 Korean strains showed very low nucleotide and deduced amino acid identities with types 1 (39.7-41.5% and 21.3-26.5%, 198 (198N ! 198S) . Polymorphisms at amino acid 249 have been found to affect the susceptibility of type 3 s1 protein to cleavage by intestinal proteases (Chappell et al., 1998) . All 10 Korean porcine orthoreoviruses encoded an isoleucine residue at amino acid 249, which is characteristic of all type 3 orthoreovirus strains with protease-resistant s1 proteins (Chappell et al., 1998) . Two amino acid residues (350D and 419E) in the s1 head domain (amino acids 340-419) have been implicated in orthoreovirus neurotropism (Kaye et al., 1986; Bassel-Duby et al., 1986) ; these residues were conserved in all 10 Korean porcine orthoreoviruses.
