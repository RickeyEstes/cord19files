Characterization of virus replication. The profile of IBV RNA synthesis was determined using a 2-step quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. Chick kidney (CK) cells were infected with IBV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10, and total RNA was harvested at hourly intervals. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using primers specific for N protein subgenomic RNA (sgRNA), as a determinant for the level of subgenomic RNA, and for the 5= untranslated region (UTR) of genomic RNA (gRNA), as a determinant for the level of full-length IBV RNA transcripts. Absolute quantitation was performed using a plasmid containing the region of interest to provide a known copy number standard curve, and data were expressed as relative RNA copy numbers based on cDNA input. Results showed that IBV-derived RNA was detectable as early as 2 h postinfection (hpi) ( Fig. Ai and Aii) . The level of IBV genomic RNA increased very little from 2 to 4 hpi but then increased from 4 to 7 hpi. Genomic RNA began to reach a steady state by 8 hpi (Fig. Ai) . Analysis of N protein sgRNA showed that the level of this RNA increased steadily from 2 to 7 hpi. The N sgRNA also began to reach a steady state by 8 hpi (Fig. Aii) . Overall, we observed that IBV sgRNA levels began to increase early in infection (2 to 7 hpi) whereas genomic RNA levels increased later in infection (4 to 7 hpi). In order to determine concomitant IBV protein synthesis, we utilized a recombinant IBV, BeauR-hRluc-⌬5a, in which the 5a accessory gene had been replaced by the Renilla luciferase reporter gene (27) . CK cells were infected with BeauR-hRluc-⌬5a, and protein samples were harvested at hourly intervals for determination of Renilla luciferase activity. Luciferase activity could be detected from 2 hpi, and luciferase activity increased steadily over the 8-h period analyzed, reaching steady-state activity between 7 and 8 hpi (Fig. 1B) . Finally, to determine the onset of progeny virus release from IBV-infected cells, primary CK cells were infected with IBV and cell supernatants were harvested at hourly time points. The presence of infectious progeny virus released from infected cells was assayed by a plaque assay. IBV progeny virus was detected in CK cell supernatants from 6 hpi, and the amounts of progeny virus detected continued to increase through 8 hpi (Fig. 1C) . A minor population of viral polymerase colocalizes with dsRNA. The presence of dsRNA has previously been used as a marker for nidovirus replication complexes and has been shown in SARS-CoV-and equine arterivirus (EAV)-infected Vero cells to localize predominantly to the inside of DMVs (23, 28) . However, the role of dsRNA as a marker for sites of replication of nidoviruses remains unclear. While dsRNA was found to colocalize with newly synthesized RNA at early time points following MHV infection, at later time points, colocalization reduced, and certainly some sites of dsRNA accumulation may represent storage of nonfunctional RNA (29) . In addition, as no pore or channel has been identified connecting the interior of DMVs with the cytoplasm (23, 28) , it is unclear how newly synthesized RNA exits DMVs to be transported to sites of translation or virus packaging. As an alternative means of identifying sites of IBV replication, we compared the locations of IBV RNA-dependent RNA polymeraseassociated nonstructural protein 12 (Nsp12) and dsRNA. Both dsRNA and Nsp12 could be detected at 4 hpi in a small number of defined foci in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 2A) , and at 6 and 8 hpi, the numbers of both dsRNA and Nsp12 foci increased and the foci spread throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig. 2B and C) . However, colocalization analysis performed using the Imaris software Coloc module showed that less than 1.5% of the dsRNA and Nsp12 signal was colocalized at any time point, with a Pearson's coefficient at 4 hpi of 0.77 (Ϯ0.24), at 6 hpi of 0.61 (Ϯ0.12), and at 8 hpi of 0.69 (Ϯ0.14) (Fig. 2D and E ). In addition, while the percentage of Nsp12 that colocalized with dsRNA remained constant over the course of infection (Fig. 2E) , the overall percentage of colocalized dsRNA signal decreased (Fig. 2D) . Therefore, only a minor population of IBV polymerase, Nsp12, and IBV-induced dsRNA colocalized throughout infection.
