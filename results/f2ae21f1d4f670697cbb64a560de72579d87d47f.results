We identified a total of 40 studies that described the use of hospital isolation precautions for a medical indication. 1,4e42 Of these, 16 met our inclusion criteria. 1,4,5,9,10,26e28,31,32,34,36,37,39,40,42 Two of these articles formed a two-part study series and will be combined in this review henceforth. 37, 42 The remainder were excluded due to the following reasons: there was no clinical assessment involved, 7,11,14,15,19e22,24 patients were isolated in Life-Islands (germ-free isolation units), 16, 18, 23, 25 which are no longer in use, the reason for or specific type of isolation was not specified, 6, 8, 12, 29, 30, 33, 35, 38, 41 or patient-related events were not evaluated. 13, 17 The details of the literature search leading to final selection are shown in Figure 1 . Of the 15 studies included in the review, seven were case/ control studies. 1,5,10,26e28,39 The rest were prospective cohorts except one which was retrospective. 34 There was a single randomised controlled trial. 32 Most studies had small sample sizes, of which the smallest was N ¼ 19. 34, 36 The largest study comprised a total of 234 patients. 39 The majority of the studies included adults. 1, 4, 5, 9, 10, 27, 28, 31, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42 There were two studies that included children. 2, 26 Most of the studies were located in the general ward; two were undertaken in the intensive care unit, 5,32 and two involved both sites. 1, 34 For all included studies, the reason for isolation was infection. Of these, five exclusively identified VRE or MRSA infection. 10, 31, 36, 39, 40 Three reported infection with either hospital-acquired or multidrug-resistant organisms. 1, 5, 26 One used protective isolation for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 34 and the remaining studies used isolation for infections by several different organisms including Salmonella spp., Clostridium difficile, Scabies spp., and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 27, 28, 37, 42 Three did not identify the specific type of infections. 4, 9, 32 In 11 studies, patients were placed exclusively under contact isolation. 4, 5, 9, 10, 27, 28, 31, 32, 36, 39, 40 In the remaining four studies, a combination of either airborne, contact, or droplet precautions was used. 1, 26, 34, 37, 42 A summary of study demographics is shown in Table I . Seven studies used a standardised scoring scale to assess the psychological impact of isolation. 9, 10, 27, 28, 31, 37, 40, 42 These included Hamilton Anxiety/Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D or HAM-A), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Health Illness Questionnaire (HIQ), Self-Esteem Scale (SES), Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS), Barthel Index, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and CrowneCrisp Experiential Index (CCEI). Two studies developed their own questionnaire or patient survey to evaluate their primary outcomes. 1, 26 Three other studies used direct observation, 4, 5, 32 and two used the interview method. 34, 36 A number of studies used one or more of these methods in combination (Table II) . 1, 26, 39 Study results and outcome Impact of isolation on patient psychological well-being The main outcome for most of the studies was assessment of the impact of isolation on patient psychology and behaviour. 9, 10, 27, 31, 34, 36, 40 A few studies focused on the effect of isolation on patient safety, 39 satisfaction, 28 or time spent in direct patient care. 1,4,5, 26 Rees et al. focused on the impact of isolation on both patient psychology and satisfaction. 37, 42 The primary outcome of the study by Klein et al. was incidence of nosocomial infection, but it also examined the influence of isolation on quality of care. 32 Among the studies that focused on the psychological impact of isolation, the majority showed a negative impact on patient psychology and behaviour, including higher scores for depression and anxiety, 9, 10, 27, 40 higher angerehostility scores, 31 and reports of fear and loneliness. 34, 36 In the study by Catalano et al., for example, the HADS scores of patients in isolation increased in proportion to their length of isolation, from 7.25 at baseline to 8.83 at week 1 and 11.5 at week 2. 10 By contrast, the scores of controls decreased from 9.78 at baseline to 5.44 at week 1, and finally 4.22 at week 2 (P < 0.001). Similarly, Gammon found that patients on day 7 of isolation also had higher mean scores for anxiety (12.75 vs 8.15) and depression (12.45 vs 7.3), and lower self-esteem scores (14.35 vs 16.1) compared to controls. 27 Tarzi et al. also found that patients in isolation had significantly higher rates of depression (P < 0.01) and anxiety (P < 0.02) than non-isolated patients. 40 There was no significant difference in anger scores. By contrast, Kennedy and Hamilton did not find any statistically significant difference in terms of depression and anxiety between isolated and non-isolated patients, but found higher angerehostility mean scores for patients in isolation (12.4 vs 4.9, P ¼ 0.037). 31 Maunder et al. focused on the psychosocial response of both patients and healthcare staff to a SARS outbreak. 34 Although no quantitative analysis was performed, the authors found that in patients isolated for SARS, the most prominent emotional effects included fear, loneliness, boredom and anger. In Rees et al.'s cohort where patients were isolated for different types of infections, they found that 12 of 21 patients had mood disturbances as evidenced by high HADS scores. 37, 42 In Newton et al.'s study, among a total of 19 patients, seven felt isolated and complained about lack of attention from nursing staff. Nevertheless 10 patients identified the positive impact of isolation including greater freedom and privacy. Interestingly, most of the patients did not have a clear understanding for the reason for isolation. 36 Wilkins et al. had a cohort of 41 isolated patients. 9 Their CCEI scores for anxiety and hysteria were found to be higher than that in the general population. Scores were also higher on admission than on discharge. Not surprisingly, history of mental illness was associated with higher scores for anxiety.
