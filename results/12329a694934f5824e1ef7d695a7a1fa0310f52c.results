The DRREP pipeline was applied to 5 datasets (SARS, HIV, Pellequer, AntiJen, and SEQ194) composed of long continuous protein sequences, with the AUC and accuracy at 75% specificity shown in Table 1. In the same table, we also list the AUC scores reported by other epitope predictors, such as the self reported AUC values of BCPred on the SARS dataset, BepiPred on the HIV dataset, and multiple systems on the SEQ194 dataset. Where possible, we ran the server-available predictors on the SARS and HIV datasets, these included the CBTOPE, Epitopia, ABCPred, LBtope, and DMN-LBE predictors. CBTOPE and Epitopia servers produced score based outputs, whereas ABCPred produced a list of index start locations of the predicted 16-sized window based epitopes. This required a conversion to a single residue score based format, and was performed by using the highest epitope score for each residue's location. We have also used the CBTOPE and ABCPred servers to calculate scores for the HIV dataset. We had difficulty running Epitopia on the longer HIV dataset, as the server produced runerrors. Also, unfortunately, DMN-LBE server predicts one sequence at a time. Thus, due to the large number of sequences AntiJen and SEQ194 datasets are composed of, we were only able to run the smaller SARS, HIV, and Pellequer datasets on the server (doing so manually, one sequence at a time). For the missing predictors, or where the AUC scores are not listed in the table, we did not get a response from the authors as to the proper conversion from the output format produced by their predictor, to the score based format we needed to calculate AUC and accuracies, or the server for that predictor was not available. Nevertheless, we applied DRREP to every dataset (without retraining), so that it could be compared to every system which was originally tested on it. Figure 4 demonstrates the type of output DRREP provides when using the classification threshold, rather than Fig. 4 Predicting Epitopes in SARS SARS sequence (SEQ), true epitope locations (True), DRREP's predicted epitopes (DRREP), BCPred's predicted epitopes (BCPred), ABCPred's predicted epitopes (ABCPred), EPitopia's predicted epitiopes (Epitopia), CBTOPE's predicted epitopes (CBTOPE), and LBtope's predicted epitopes (LBTope). The incorrect predictions are colored in red, the correct are colored in blue, and the true epitope locations are colored green simply outputting a list of residue scores. The figure shows the SARS sequence, with the line (True) showing the actual epitope locations, line (DRREP) shows DRREP's epitope predictions when using a 75% specificity threshold, line (BCPred) designates BCPred's predicted epitopes, line (ABCPred) designates ABCPred's predicted epitopes, and similarly for EPitopia, CBTOPE, and finally LBtope. The true epitope locations are coloured green, and for each predictor, the incorrect predictions are coloured in red, and the correct are coloured blue.
