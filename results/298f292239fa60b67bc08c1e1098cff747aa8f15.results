To test whether NTZ enhances sensing by the RLR pathway, we overexpressed full-length RIG-I or melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), the two major RLR proteins, in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells that were co-transfected with an IFN-b promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmid (IFN-b LUC). We then examined whether NTZ augmented IFN-b promoter activity in the presence or absence of a viral nucleic acid analog, the synthetic dsRNA poly I:C. NTZ pretreatment enhanced poly I:C-stimulated IFN-b promoter activity in RIG-I-( Figure 1A , left) and in MDA5-( Figure 1A , right) overexpressing cells in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1A ). In the case of MDA5 overexpression, NTZ's effect on IFN-b reporter gene activity was evident even in the absence of poly I:C treatment ( Figure 1A , right). RIG-I and MDA5 differentially recognize distinct viral RNA signatures (Kato et al., 2006) . RIG-I preferentially recognizes 5 0 triphosphosphorylated short dsRNA structures typically generated by negative-strand RNA viruses, whereas MDA5 recognizes longer dsRNA structures (Kato et al., 2008; Schlee et al., 2009) . To more precisely distinguish NTZ's effects on these RNA sensors, we next tested the effect of NTZ on a more specific RIG-I stimulus by using a short (42 bp) 5 0 phosphorylated synthetic dsRNA (1AB) (Peisley et al., 2013) . We found that IFN-b reporter activity was also significantly enhanced by NTZ in the RIG-I-overexpressing cells that were stimulated with 1AB ( Figure 1B, left panel) . Furthermore, endogenous IFN-b mRNA synthesis was significantly enhanced by NTZ pretreatment before 1AB stimulation of 293T cells ( Figure 1B , right panel). We next tested the ability of NTZ pretreatment to activate IFN-b reporter gene activity in HEK293T cells cotransfected with a plasmid overexpressing MAVS, the adaptor protein through which RIG-I and MDA5 signal (Kawai et al., 2005; Meylan et al., 2005; Seth et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2005) . IFN-b LUC activity was strongly enhanced by NTZ in MAVS-overexpressing cells even in the absence of any other cellular stimulation, reaching a >4-fold increase at a concentration of 10 mM NTZ ( Figure 1C ). It has been reported that in addition to preventing IRF3 phosphorylation and activation by blocking RIG-I viral RNA sensing, EBOV VP35 also prevents IRF3 phosphorylation by directly blocking the access of the kinases IKKÎµ and TBK-1 to unphosphorylated IRF3 (Prins et al., 2009) . To determine if NTZ can directly augment IRF3's activity, we next transfected HEK293T cells with a plasmid encoding phosphomimetic IRF3, which is able to drive IFN-b mRNA expression in the absence of proximal components of the RLR signaling pathway (Lin et al., 1998) . As shown in Figure 1D , NTZ enhanced IRF3-induced IFN-b reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we also found that NTZ enhanced type I IFN-induced transcription of the ISGs Mx1, IFI27, and IFITM3 ( Figure 1E ). Thus, NTZ broadly enhances signaling downstream of the RLR and IFN-b signaling pathways in addition to acting as an agonist for viral RNA sensors acting at the proximal part of the pathway in the cytoplasm.
