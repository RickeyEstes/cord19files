Demographics. We received consent from, surveyed, and swabbed a total of 2,685 individuals 18 years of age or older from among visitors passing through a room in the tourist attraction. Some directly approached the study recruiters, while others were present while a recruiter was explaining the study and elected to join afterward. A total of 1,477 participants were enrolled between 29 April and 31 July 2016 (summer) and a total of 1,208 between 28 January and 30 April 2017 (winter) ( Table 1) . Among all participants, 57.7% were reported as female, 41.7% as male, and 0.6% as transgender, gender nonconforming, or gender not known. Among the participants, 69.5% identified as white, 3.5% as Black/African American, 13.2% as Asian, 1.5% as American Indian/ Alaskan Native, 0.6% as Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 6.8% as other or of two or more races, and 4.9% gave no response. 21.7% identified as Hispanic, while 77.8% did not. A total of 39.8% of participants were in the 18-to-29-year-old age range, 20.9% were 30 to 39 years of age, 22.0% were 40 to 49 years of age, 12% were 50 to 64 years of age, and 4.2% were 65 or older. A total of 42.6% reported having had a flu shot, while 52.0% had not had one and 5.4% did not know whether they had had one. In response to the statement "I get sick more easily or more often than most people I know," 3.4% reported that they strongly agreed, 11.3% somewhat agreed, 13.5% neither agreed nor disagreed, 23.0% somewhat disagreed, and 48.8% strongly disagreed. The breakdowns across all of the categorical variables described above were similar between the summer and winter arms of the study (see Table 1 ). Viral positivity results. Among all 2,685 participants across both seasons, there were a total of 168 (6.2%) individuals who tested positive for respiratory virus. Of these, 85 (50.6%) were positive for HRV, 65 (38.7%) for CoV, and 18 (10.2%) for adenovirus, hMPV, RSV, influenza virus, or PIV. There were no coinfections. In the summer arm, only 5.6% of participants tested positive (2) , whereas in the winter arm, 7.0% did. These positivity results did show differences across seasons in terms of virus distribution (Fisher's exact test P ϭ Ͻ0.001) though not in terms of overall positivity prevalence (P ϭ 0.13). The majority of infections in the summer arm were HRV infections (71.0%), with 19.3% testing positive for CoV and the other 9.7% testing positive for influenza virus, hMPV, RSV, or PIV; however, the majority of infections in the winter arm were CoV infections (57.6%), with 30.6% testing positive for HRV and the remaining 11.8% testing positive for adenovirus, hMPV, influenza virus, or PIV (Fig. 1a) . There was evidence of differing viral positivity rates across the months, with the highest proportion of positive tests (11.1%) occurring in February (P Ͻ 0.001). Figure 1b shows the percentage of positive tests per month broken down by virus. Analysis of positivity. Testing positive for respiratory virus was positively associated with consumption of cold and flu medicine among all participants, and this association was consistent across the seasonal arms (Fisher's exact test P ϭ Ͻ0.001). The proportion of participants testing positive who were symptomatic ranged from 3.6% to 39.4% overall, depending on symptomatic definition. There were slight differences between the seasonal arms, with 2.5% to 48.1% of positives being symptomatic during the summer arm and 4.8% to 30.1% being symptomatic for the winter arm, again depending on definition. There was some evidence of differences in the proportions of infections that were symptomatic between seasons by symptomatic definitions 1 and 2 (chi-square P ϭ 0.05 and 0.03, respectively) (see Materials and Methods for an explanation of the scoring method used for quantification of symptomatic definitions), but there was no evidence of differences for any other definition. Rates of being symptomatic differed significantly among virus-positive and virus-negative participants, with positive-testing participants more likely to meet symptomatic criteria, though there were up to 17.6% of individuals who tested negative who were nonetheless symptomatic (depending on definition) ( Table 2 ). This association was consistent across the seasonal arms. No other univariate associations between testing positive for respiratory virus and other collected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, age, etc.) were found. The best-fit logistic regression models according to minimum Akaike information criterion (AIC) values are shown in Table 3 . For all participants combined across seasons, the best-fit model supported an association of an increased likelihood of testing positive for respiratory virus infection (all viruses) with a higher total symptom score but with no other variables. There was some difference between the arms, with the association for the summer arm holding for the symptom score and being Hispanic and that for the winter arm holding only for the symptom score. Performing the analysis on all participants (both arms) for HRV positivity, the best-fit model showed an association of positivity with symptom score, being Hispanic, and age category. For the summer arm and winter arm considered individually, the association held only for symptom score and being Hispanic. For CoV positivity, the best-fit model indicated an association between positivity and symptom score for both seasonal arms. Analysis of quantitated signal intensity score. Among the positive-testing participants, signal intensity (measured continuously in nanoamps per square millimeter) was positively associated with reporting allergies (P Ͻ 0.05). There were differences between the seasonal arms for this finding, however. For the winter arm, allergies were similarly associated with quantitated score of signal intensity for all positives, whereas there was an association of signal intensity with age but not with allergies for the summer arm (there was a negative association between signal intensity and the 40-to-49-year-old and 50-to-64-year-old age categories compared to the 18-to-29-yearold age category). Among HRV positive-testing participants (both arms combined), there was strong evidence of a negative association between signal intensity and the 50-to-64-year-old age category compared to the 18-to-29-year-old age category, weak evidence of a positive association between signal intensity and having allergies, and weak evidence of a positive association between signal intensity and being Hispanic. Again, there were seasonal differences, with the symptom score being negatively associated with signal intensity in the winter arm and with being Hispanic being positively associated in the summer arm. For those positive for CoV, signal intensity was weakly positively associated with having allergies (P Ͻ 0.1). This association held across seasons, with stronger association in the winter arm (P ϭ 0.02). In the summer arm there were also associations with symptom score, race, and gender, with signal intensity being positively associated with symptom score, a negative association between signal intensity and all other races compared to whites, and a negative association with women compared to men. Symptom results. Among all participants, there was strong evidence of a higher reported total symptom score among women than men (analysis of variance [ANOVA] P Ͻ 0.001); participants aged 30 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, and 50 to 64 years had lower total reported symptom scores than participants aged 18 to 29 years (ANOVA P Ͻ 0.001). These results were consistent and significant across the seasonal arms. Reporting consumption of cold and flu medicines was positively associated with higher total symptom scores across all participants and also only among positives (ANOVA P Ͻ 0.0001). This finding was also consistent across seasons. There was evidence of differences in symptom scores by month across all participants (ANOVA P Ͻ 0.001), but there were no differences seen in assessing only the participants testing positive (AOV, P ϭ 0.725) (Fig. 2 ). There were, however, differences in mean individual symptom scores by virus as shown in Table 4 . There was a positive association between reporting a greater tendency to get sick and total self-reported symptom scores among all participants (AOV, P Ͻ 0.0001); however, there was no significant association between viral positivity and reporting a greater tendency to get sick. These results were consistent across the seasonal arms. Interestingly, the proportions of symptomatic individuals (by the various definitions) who tested negative were quite high (66.7% to 86.9%), and this finding held across the seasonal arms. Examining this result further, we found that for symptom definitions 1 and 2 (the definitions that encompassed all symptoms), there was a strong association among the participants who tested negative between being symptomatic and having allergies (P Ͻ 0.001). The association between having allergies and being symptomatic among participants who tested negative was less strong for definition 2 (P Ͻ 0.05) and nonexistent for definitions 3 to 7.
