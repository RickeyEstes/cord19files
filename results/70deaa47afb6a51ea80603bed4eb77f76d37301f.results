3.1. Inter-laboratory comparison of PEDV serology tests using ELISA (panel 1) As an initial assessment of the properties of the serology-based diagnostic tests used in the different laboratories, a combined panel of 54 sera was distributed between the participating laboratories and tested by ELISA for the presence of anti-PEDV antibodies (see Table 1A , 1B). The different assays that were used comprised a mixture of "in-house" tests (ELISAs 1-3) and a commercial test (ELISA 4). The samples included known positive samples (from experimentally infected pigs), field samples collected from countries never known to have had cases of PEDV infection (SE and DK) and also field samples from herds in the US and Canada known to be infected with PEDV. It should be noted that the sera from SE had been selected following pre-screening using the ELISA 4 and found to be negative in this assay (Table 1B ). In addition, some samples from FR were field samples that were specifically selected because they were collected at the beginning of 2014 from clinically normal herds but (with one exception) had given unexpected positive results in the ELISA 4 (see below). These selected sera were collected prior to the re-appearance of PEDV in FR (Grasland et al., 2015) and are not considered representative of pig sera from FR in general. The results of all the tests are presented in Table 1A , 1B. The ELISA 1 identified anti-PEDV antibodies in the sera of 7 experimentally infected pigs (inoculated with an early European strain of PEDV, either Br1/87 or CV777) and still obtained a positive result when such sera were diluted 50, 200 or even 400 times. In addition, known positive field sera from the US and Canada also tested positive in this assay. In contrast, negative control sera, from the field or experimental studies, collected in DK (5 samples) and SE (17 samples), which have never experienced cases of PED, all proved negative. Furthermore, the 10 selected field sera, collected from clinically normal pigs from France, also all tested negative in this assay. The same samples were also tested using ELISA 2. When testing sera from animals infected with early European strains of PEDV, two different laboratories, correctly identified 4/4 sera from pigs experimentally infected with the Br1/87 strain of PEDV (see Table 1A and 1B) but did not efficiently detect the pre-diluted (50-400Â) samples of such sera. Furthermore, both of these laboratories obtained a positive result with either 6 or 7 of the 7 sera from CV777-infected pigs (from FR). Negative results were obtained on all 22 known negative sera in one laboratory but 2 of these negative sera (DK13 and DK17) were scored positive in another. Some 7 sera from pigs infected with US or Canadian strains of PEDV were also tested with ELISA 2 and 4 or 5 of them scored positive in the two laboratories. There was a greater disparity using the selected FR field sera, there was a single positive reaction in one lab however, 7 were scored positive in the other using this assay system. A subset of these panel 1 samples, including sera from the Br1/ 87-infected pigs, was also tested using ELISA 3, another "in house" blocking assay, as described in Materials and Methods, (see Table 1A , 1B). This assay successfully identified each of the undiluted pig sera that were from animals experimentally infected with PEDV as being positive. However, when the sera were diluted (50-400Â), prior to assay, then negative results were obtained in each case. Sera from animals infected with both the early European strains of PEDV and the recent INDEL US strain (from DK experimental studies and field sera from the US and Canada) were scored as positive, except for one serum (GVB/04) from a pig experimentally infected with the CV777 strain, but the 6 others were correctly identified. Of the 10 selected French field sera, 5 were scored positive while 5 were negative, including GVB/16, which was scored as negative in most of the other tests including the ELISA 4 (see below). A commercial assay (ELISA 4) was used in 3 separate laboratories to test the whole panel of sera (Table 1A , 1B). This system successfully identified (in 18 of 21 tests) the sera from 7 pigs experimentally infected with the CV777 strain but, unexpectedly, was less efficient (only 4 of 12 tests of the undiluted sera were positive) at detecting the infection in 4 pigs by the Br1/87 strain that is very closely related to CV777 (these two strains had the same origin but have been passaged separately over time). The ELISA 4 did not detect antibodies in any of the pre-diluted sera from experimentally infected pigs. Sera from 7 pigs infected with the recent US strain of PEDV were successfully detected as positive (in 19 out 21 tests using this assay). However, using 5 sera from uninfected pigs in DK (with no history of PEDV infection), in the 15 tests using ELISA 4, some 5 were scored positive, 1 test was inconclusive and only 9 were scored negative. The 10 selected French field sera, collected from herds without clinical signs of PED, included 9 samples that had unexpectedly scored positive in this test during initial testing in one of the laboratories. A very similar pattern of results (8 or 9 positive) was obtained for these 10 sera when tested in this assay in each of the 3 laboratories (Table 1B , ELISA 4(a, b, c)) but these data contrast with the negative results obtained using ELISA 1, see Table 1B . All the negative sera (17 in total) from SE tested negative in the ELISA 4 in each of the 3 laboratories but they had been pre-selected for distribution in this panel based on the results from this assay.
