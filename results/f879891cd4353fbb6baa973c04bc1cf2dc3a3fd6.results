Genotyping pathogens and their hosts using RNA-seq of field-collected infected leaves To characterize the genotypic diversity of PST at the field level, we collected 219 samples of wheat and triticale infected with PST from 17 different counties across the UK in the spring and summer of 2013 ( Figure 1a ; Table S1 in Additional file 1). From these, we selected 35 PST-infected wheat samples from wheat varieties that spanned the resistance spectrum, and 4 PST-infected triticale samples (Table S1 in Additional file 1). Total RNA was extracted from each sample and subjected to RNA-seq analysis ( Figure 1a ). After filtering, an average of 37% (standard deviation 12.7%) reads aligned to the PST-130 reference genome [18] , indicating that fungal transcripts account for a high percentage of the transcripts in PST-infected plant tissue (Table S2 in Additional file 1). To address whether each sample comprised a single PST genotype without considerable bias in allelespecific expression, we calculated the distribution of read counts for biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), determined from alignment to the PST-130 genome. As a dikaryon, the PST mean of read counts at heterokaryotic positions is expected to have a single mode at 0.5, with two alternative alleles each representing one of the two haploid nuclei (Additional file 2) [22] . Based on the presence of only two alleles and the shape of the distribution being comparable to purified isolates when heterokaryotic SNPs were considered, we concluded that all samples likely represent a predominantly single genotype with little bias in allele expression (Additional files 3 and 4). We next used our data to confirm the wheat variety in a particular PST-infected sample. To this end, we extracted the wheat sequences flanking a set of 18,162 genetically mapped wheat SNPs (Table S3 in Additional file 1) [23] . Nine of the PST-infected wheat samples were collected from wheat varieties with identified SNPs (Donal O'Sullivan (University of Reading) and James Cockram (NIAB), personal communication) and for each of these samples, reads were independently aligned against the wheat sequences extracted above. Each of the 18,162 SNP positions with ≥10× coverage was then assessed for correlation against the available sequence data for seven wheat varieties. This analysis confirmed the wheat variety recorded at the point of sample collection as the most likely variety for all nine PST-infected wheat samples ( Figure 2 ). Furthermore, for samples taken from the wheat variety Oakley, the second highest matching variety was KWS Santiago, whose parents are Sherbourne and Oakley. Oakley has been used widely in the parentage of various wheat varieties as reflected by the level of similarity between PST-infected Oakley samples and all other varieties ( Figure 2 ). This analysis demonstrates that the transcriptomic data from PST-infected field samples can be used successfully to determine the host wheat variety. Transcriptome sequencing was carried out on 39 samples to generate transcript data from both the pathogen and host. For the pathogen, the data were used to assess the pathogen population diversity and differential gene expression. For the host, the data were used to confirm the host variety within a particular sample. SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism. (b) 2013 field isolates (dark blue squares) are distinct and highly diverse when compared with the older UK population (light blue squares). Phylogenetic analysis was undertaken using the third codon position of 5,610 PST-130 gene models (2,496,679 sites) with ≥80% breadth of coverage for all PST isolates using a maximum likelihood model. Stars indicate samples in which both the genome and transcriptome were sequenced from the same PST isolate.
