Between December 2011 and April 2012, 444 ILI episodes were enrolled in the study. After the exclusion of 77 episodes that did not meet the ILI case definition, 9 episodes that were tested within 7 days after the previous testing, 9 episodes that were tested more than 5 days after symptom onset, 18 episodes associated with lost clinical samples, and 22 episodes that presented before the week of the first influenza case, 309 episodes were eligible for analyses. Among them, 78 (25.2%) were single-positive for influenza A, 37 (12%) were single-positive for influenza B, and one (0.3%) was positive for both influenza A and B ( Table 1 ). The influenza season started in the first week of 2012 and reached its peak at the 6 th week (Figure 1 ). Influenza B was the dominant strain in the late phase (week 9 to week 17). Among the 46 influenza A-positive samples that were subtyped (58.2% of all influenza A-positive samples), all were positive for the H3N2 strain. All unsubtyped influenza A samples were negative for the A(H1N1)pdm09 strain. From the collected samples, 27 (8.7%) were positive for NIRVs; HRV was the leading virus identified, followed by RSV. One case was positive for both influenza B and HRV, and the case was classified as an influenza B-positive case. NIRVs were identified throughout the study period. The characteristics of patients by case category are summarised in Table 2 . Influenza-positive cases were younger than influenzanegative groups, and NIRV-positive cases were more frequently vaccinated for influenza than other groups, whereas other characteristics were similar across case categories. The unadjusted estimate of influenza VE against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza was 18.3% (95% confidence interval: 234.4 to 50.3) based on the use of all influenzanegative controls (Table 3) . After controlling for potential confounders, including age group, underlying condition, duration from disease onset to testing, and month of visit, the adjusted VE estimate was 5.3% (95% CI: 260.5 to 44.1). When we restricted the analysis to influenza A only, the unadjusted and adjusted VE estimates were 26.7% (95% CI: 228.1 to 58.1) and 16% (95% CI: 254.5 to 54.3), respectively. When we stratified the study season into 2 periods, the adjusted estimate of VE against influenza A was 21.7% (95% CI: 267.5 to 63.4) in the early phase (week 1 to week When controls were limited to RV-negative controls, the adjusted estimate of VE against influenza became 21.5% (95% CI: 274.7 to 41). When controls were limited to NIRV-positive controls, the adjusted VE estimate was 50% (95% CI: 243.2 to 82.5). Similar patterns were observed in the estimates of VE against influenza A. The sensitivity and specificity of RIDT for detecting influenza A and/or B were 78.6% (95% CI: 73.9 to 83) and 95.3% (95% CI: 93 to 97.7), respectively. The unadjusted and adjusted estimates of VE against influenza using RIDT results were 14.4% (95% CI: 2 43.1 to 48.8) and 5.2% (95% CI: 263 to 44.9), respectively. In total, 23 H3N2 viruses were characterised by phylogenetic analysis of the HA1 sequence. All sequences were clustered within the A/Victoria/361/2011 clade, which was genetically separated from the A/Victoria/210/2009 clade used in the 2011-2012 influenza vaccine (Figure 2 ).
