The findings of this national study show that the overwhelming number of course attendees were hospital-based nurses (n = 1558, 85.7%). This finding was consistent across all of the years studied (see Table 2 ). Workplaces having the fewest attendees each year were public health centers, long-term care centers, and schools. The major specialties of hospital-based attendees were emergency/critical care (n = 556, 30.6%), followed by medical (n = 304, 16.7%) and surgical nurses (n = 217, 11.9%; see Table 3 ). It should be noted that the category emergency and critical care is combined because nurses who work in emergency also work in critical care units; these 2 specialty areas will be separated in future studies.
