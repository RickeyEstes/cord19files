HLA Class II but Not HLA Class I Alleles Are Associated with Antibody Occurrence Two hundred and sixty-eight MS patients on long-term IFN-b therapy were included in the first group of the study. One hundred and thirty-six patients of the study group had developed antibodies to IFN-b (determined by cELISA), of whom 85 developed neutralizing antibodies as determined by the in vivo induction of the IFN-b response gene MX1. One hundred and thirty-two patients were antibody negative (Table 1 ). In the second group, 76 patients were antibody positive, including 59 with neutralizing in vivo activity. The remaining 164 individuals were antibody negative. For analysis of possible confounding effects, treatment-independent allele distribution was tested. The null hypothesis of independency holds in the study (chisquare ¼ 55.34, p value ¼ 0.65) as well as in the validation group (chi-square ¼ 8.333, p value ¼ 0.97). All patients from the initial study group were typed for HLA class I and II alleles. Although we expected an association of HLA class II genes with antibody development, we also typed class I genes as internal negative control. As expected, only small differences between antibody-negative and -positive patients were found for HLA class I alleles. Median anti-IFN-b levels were lower in HLA-C*16 carriers (p value ¼ 0.007, FDR ¼ 0.095) and higher in HLA-C*2 and HLA-B*57 (p value ¼ 0.03, FDR % 0.1) carriers, although the associations did not reach significance after adjustment for multiple testing. By contrast, significant differences were observed for the HLA class II alleles. The largest difference of median anti-IFN-b levels was observed between DRB1*04-positive (n ¼ 58) and DRB1*04-negative subjects (n ¼ 210) (p ¼ 0.006). DRB1*04-positive patients showed significantly higher anti-IFN-b levels with a median normalized antibody titer of 55.1% compared to DRB1*04-negative patients (median ¼ 17.1%) ( Table 2) . Significantly reduced median anti-IFN-b reactivities were also found for DRB1*1101 (p value ¼ 0.013) and DRB1*1104 (p value ¼ 0.02). However, null hypothesis was kept after the FDR procedure. Likewise, elevated anti-IFN-b reactivities in DRB1*1601-positive patients (p value ¼ 0.02) were not significant after correction. HLA-DRB1*04 Alleles Confer a Higher Risk of Developing Antibodies during IFN-b Therapy A majority of DRB1*04-positive patients included in the initial study group carried the DRB1*0401 allele (n ¼ 42), whereas only 12 subjects were DRB1*0404-positive. Only four patients carried DRB1*0408 ( Table 3) . Differences of location parameters for DRB1*0401 (FDR ¼ 0.012) and DRB1*0408 (FDR ¼ 0.048) were significant after correction for multiple testing. On the other hand, average cELISA levels for DRB1*0404 were lower compared to DRB1*04negative patients. After FDR correction, null hypothesis was kept for DRB1*0404 despite a significant single test (p value ¼ 0.031, FDR ¼ 0. 16) . To further investigate the role of DR4 alleles for antibody development, we determined the activity of IFN-b antibodies by another assay, which was used in a number of clinical studies. The in vitro MX1 test was performed on 203 randomly selected samples. As expected, a significant increase (p value ¼ 0.003) of neutralizing in vitro activity was found in sera of HLA-DRB1*0401-and *0408-positive subjects (median activity ¼ 8462 NU) compared to sera from HLA-DRB1*0401-and *0408-negative patients (median activity ¼ 0) (data not shown). For validation of our initial findings, we used a second study cohort and analyzed the most significant results for DRB1*04. HLA genotyping of the validation group supported the previous findings. Fifty-nine of 242 individuals were DRB1*04 positive. DRB1*0401 carriers showed significantly higher levels of anti-IFN-b antibodies. Median cELISA positivity was 71.8% (p value ¼ 0.005, FDR ¼ 0.03) ( Table 3) . Five subjects carried the DRB1*0408 allele, with a median level of 91.6%. Whereas the elevation of ELISA reactivity was significant in a single test, null hypothesis was kept after correction for multiple testing (p value ¼ 0.04, FDR ¼ 0.15). In a combined analysis of anti-IFN-b levels for DR4-positive and DR4-negative carriers of validation and study groups, a highly significant elevation of anti-IFN-b levels was found in carriers of DR4 alleles (median reactivity ¼ 55.1%, p value % 0.01) (Figure 1 ). Fifty-four of 74 HLA-DRB1*0401 carriers showed antibodies during IFN-b treatment. In DRB1*0401-and *0408-negative subjects, 153 of 429 showed seroconversion, resulting in an odds ratio of 4.9 for HLA-DRB1*0401-positive carriers. The odds ratio for DRB1*0408 was 14.4, with four of five allele carriers being antibody positive. A highly significant increase of ELISA reactivities was observed in a comparison of all HLA-DRB1*0401-and 0408-positive carriers versus HLA-DRB1*0401-and *0408-negative carriers (Figure 2 ) (p value % 0.01). Furthermore, the difference of anti-IFNb levels among DRB1*0401 (median reactivity ¼ 70.6%) and DRB1*0408 (median reactivity ¼ 96.4%) is significant (p value ¼ 0.006). Because of the small number of homozygous DRB1*04 carriers, a comparison with DRB1*04-negative or heterozygous carriers was not possible. The haplotype analysis was performed with score statistics for ambiguous haplotypes. DRB*11 alleles might have a protective influence: DRB1-DQB1 haplotype analysis shows a significant reduction of anti-IFN-b levels in DRB1*1101-DQB1*0301 and DRB*1104-DQB1*0301 carriers. Elevated MX1 mRNA levels in carriers of these haplotypes support this observation. A significant increase of anti-IFN-b reactivity could be observed for DRB1*0401-DQB1*0301 and DRB1*0401-DQB1*0302 haplotypes. The reduction of MX1 mRNA levels, however, was not significant (p value R 0.5). Reduced MX1 levels as well as increased antibody reactivities were significantly changed in patients carrying the DRB1*0408-DQB1*0301 haplotype. Susceptibility to seroconversion was increased for DRB1*1601-DQB1*0502 carriers. The DRB1*1601-DQB1*0502-positive carriers also showed significantly decreased MX1 levels ( Table 4) . As expected pairwise linkage disequilibrium was significant for all observed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci (p value % 0.001). Strongest disequilibria (Table S1 available online) do not indicate a common transmission with DRB1*0401 and DRB1*0408 (data not shown).
