Histopathological features and immunohistochemistry Squamous metaplasia: Severe keratinizing squamous metaplasia was occasionally observed in small airways and pulmonary parenchyma and this had to be distinguished from cystic keratinizing epithelioma. In severely keratinized squamous metaplasia a gradual transition of alveolar cells into squamous metaplastic cells almost always could be recognised and a discrete cyst was not formed. Mitoses were not usually detectable in foci of squamous metaplasia and only few nuclei were stained by the anti-PCNA antibody. Keratinizing cysts: All keratinizing cysts revealed a large keratin filled central cavity. In the great majority of cysts the keratin was surrounded by connective tissue infiltrated by inflammatory cells or by a thin rim (one to three layers) of epithelial cells. In some areas of the epithelial wall goblet cells were occasionally found. In contrast to cystic keratinizing epitheliomas, the epithelial parts of the wall were always thin and lacked any nests of epithelial cells expanding into adjacent alveolar spaces. Therefore the cysts had a smooth border and were clearly separated from the surrounding lung tissue. Epithelial parts of cyst walls only showed a weak or no reaction to PCNA in the peripheral cell layer. Cystic keratinizing epithelioma: Cystic keratinizing epithelioma were comprised of a highly keratinized wall of squamous epithelium and a central lumen that was filled with keratin. The squamous wall consisted of several layers of epithelial cells (three to ten) and peripheral cell nests that projected into the adjacent alveoli, resulting in The central lumen of cystic keratinizing epitheliomas always was filled with laminated keratin masses. Keratin lamellae showed a parallel orientation or consisted of confluent keratin pearls. The latter often was accompanied by the presence of many macrophages and occasionally some shadow cells. Enlargement by centrifugal growth was revealed by the presence of particles throughout the keratin-filled cavity together with whorled profiles representing sequentially incorporated keratinized peripheral air-spaces. Rarely epithelial island or projections from the tumour wall were found within the central keratin. Keratin pearls were also present in some of the larger peripheral islands of cells. In some of the cystic keratinizing epitheliomas the keratin masses were infiltrated by numerous polymorphonuclear granulocytes. Infiltration was most pronounced in tumours with marked inflammation and fibrosis of the adjacent pulmonary tissue. Inflammation and fibrosis of varying severity was observed in all rats exposed to particles and was most severe in rats exposed to crocidolite. Compression of adjacent lung tissue could only be seen in larger tumours of lungs fixed by instillation. Even small tumours in lungs fixed by immersion appeared to cause compression but this was an artifact of the fixation method. Regressive changes were seen in some subpleural areas of the tumours. In these areas the tumour wall was thinner and the number of cell layers reduced to one or two. In occasional parts of the tumour circumference, the epithelial wall was missing with connective tissue manifesting a foreign body granulomatous response including the presence of macrophages, giant cells, mast cells and a few lymphocytes. One or two (focally, sometimes more than two) layers of the peripheral squamous epithelium as well as almost all epithelial islands projecting into the adjacent alveoli revealed the great majority of nuclei positively labeled with a monoclonal anti-PCNA antibody ( fig. 2) . Staining intensity decreased in the more centrally located layers of epithelial cells. Islands of epithelial cells entrapped in the central keratin mass showed only weak or no staining. The great majority of nuclei of epithelial cells in areas with regressive changes showed no reaction. Cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma: Cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas had a pleomorphic appearance. Generally, all of them showed at least one cavity filled with keratin and surrounded by a highly keratinized squamous epithelium. One type of cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma seemed to develop from cystic epithelioma. These neoplasms revealed focal atypia of tumour cells, resulting from disorganised cells with enlarged and sometimes irregularly-formed nuclei. An increased number of mitotic figures was usually observed. 440 Exp Toxic Patho149 (1997) 6 The thickness of epithelium was increased to more than eight layers in these parts an in addition to the basal layers, mitotic figures were seen in other layers of the epithelium. Sometimes focal invasion accompanied by a scirrhous reaction could be seen ( fig. 3 ). Mast cells were frequently seen in connective tissue adjacent to the tumours. Other regions of the wall of these cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas resembled cystic keratinizing epitheliomas. In these regions, the tumour wall was three to eight layers thick, regularly organised and cellular atypia was absent or minimal. Mitoses were restricted to the basal layers and extension of the tumours by peripheral extension of epithelial cell nests into adjacent alveolar spaces could be observed. Another type of cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma obviously developed a central keratin filled cavity due to degeneration and necrosis of centrally located squamous epithelium and replacement of the epithelial structures by accumulating keratin. A mesh of necrotic remnants of cords of epithelial cells was visible in parts of the keratin filled lumen of these neoplasms. Some tumours of both variants of cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas had parts with predominantly spindleshaped cells which had an increased number of mitoses. In these spindle-cell parts little or no keratinization was observed. The central keratin of the carcinomas had a laminated appearance and was mixed with cell detritus, macrophages and occasionally shadow cells. Frequently entrapped islands of squamous cells or papillary projections were seen in the central keratin. In many carcinomas the central keratin also was mixed with polymorphonuclear granulocytes. This was the case in almost all B(a)P induced neoplasms and also frequently seen in lungs with severe inflammation and fibrosis. Focal regressive changes were occasionally seen in the tumour periphery. Beside pressure atrophy (marked reduction of the number of cell layers) of the epithelial wall in subpleural areas, loss of squamous epithelium was also observed in parts of the tumour distant from the pleura. The epithelial wall was only few layers thick or replaced by connective tissue infiltrated by macrophages, giant cells and few mast cells or lymphocytes. Invasion of the pleura and of bronchi or even blood vessels was frequently observed. Occasionally invasive growth into tissue adjacent to the lung could be seen. Tissues involved included mediastinum, periaortic tissue and diaphragm. A few metastases were noted in intrapulmonary blood or lymph vessels, mediastinum, lung-associated lymph nodes, heart and kidney. Some cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas exhibited small parts with glandular structures. These glandular structures contained goblet-cells, but no signs of malignant growth were present. Therefore a diagnosis as adenosquamous carcinoma was declined. More than three peripheral cell layers of the wall of cystic squamous cell carcinomas showed at least parts with positively stained nuclei for PCNA ( fig. 4) . Nuclei of cell layers adjacent to the central keratin were not labeled. Invasive growing tumour cells could be clearly identified by the PCNA technique. A strong reaction was visible in the majority of nuclei in enlarged and pleomorphic cells. Papillary projections and islands of epithelial cells reacted positively as well as areas with spindle-shaped tumour cells. Keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma and non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma: Beside cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas numerous keratinizing carcinomas without large keratin filled cavities were observed. However, keratinization was also marked in these neoplasms. Generally, the tumours consisted of nests of squamous cells with distinct stratification and a low rate of mitosis. Some less differentiated squamous cell carcinomas had little keratinization, atypical cells and a tendency to a loss of cell orientation. Results of nuclear staining with the anti-PCNA antibody were comparable to cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. Four squamous cell tumours lacked keratinization. One of them was predominantly composed of cells with a basaloid appearance.
