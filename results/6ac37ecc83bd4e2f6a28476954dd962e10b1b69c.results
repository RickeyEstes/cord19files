In vivo model of a S. aureus PJI Previous work with other bioluminescent strains has demonstrated that bioluminescent signals closely approximate and correlate with the bacterial burden, as measured by ex vivo colony-forming unit (CFU) counting. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] In vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of mice demonstrated that the average signal from the S. aureus-infected postoperative legs (4.3 ± 0.9) × 10 4 p/s/cm 2 / sr (n = 10) was greater than for mice that had surgery performed without bacterial inoculation (1.4 ± 0.09) × 10 3 p/s/cm 2 /sr (n = 10, P < 0.000 6) (Fig. 1a, b) . The infection remained locally at the original site of inoculation as bioluminescent signals were not detected above background at other regions of the body. In addition, this model of PJI resulted in expansion and damage of the distal femur as the infection progressed, which was confirmed by CT and high-resolution X-ray imaging (Fig. 1c) . 16 The anatomical changes in the distal femur of the S. aureus-infected postoperative legs can be seen clearly compared with the contralateral, non-operative leg. [ 18 F]FDG imaging [ 18 F]FDG is a glucose analog that is taken up by cells with high glucose avidity, including tumors, inflammation, and bacteria. Volumes of interest were defined manually around areas of focal [ 18 F]FDG uptake in the distal femurs of both the postoperative and contralateral, non-operative legs of the mice after saline injection or S. aureus infection. To control for variability in mouse size, data are presented as averages of the fold increase of the postoperative leg measurement over the contralateral, non-operative leg. In the S. aureus-infected postoperative legs, there was a large mean increase (9.8 ± 0.4, n = 8) compared with a doubling (2.1 ± 0.2, n = 4) for the sterile postoperative legs (Fig. 2) . We see a significant uptake of in S. aureus-infected surgical postoperative legs compared to contralateral non-operative legs (P < 0.000 1), suggesting that the probe specifically localized to infected surgical sites. However, the glucose avidity of metabolically active cells, such as immune cells at sites of inflammation following sterile implantation surgery, complicate diagnosis of infection. 18 Fig. 1 In vivo bioluminescent imaging in a mouse model of PJI. A titanium Kirschner-wire was surgically placed in the mouse femur with or without an inoculum of a bioluminescent S. aureus strain in the knee joint prior to closure. a Representative in vivo bioluminescent signals at the S. aureus-infected postoperative site. b Maximum radiance values for individuals (mean ± S.E.M.) with sterile control implants or S. aureusinfected postoperative distal femur sites at a representative time point (1 400 ± 90 vs 43 000 ± 9 000, respectively). c CT (top) and X-ray (bottom) imaging demonstrating the location of the Kirschner-wire (false-colored pink in the CT image) in the distal femur. *P < 0.000 6 Bone scans with [ 18 F]NaF [ 18 F]NaF is incorporated within the bone matrix at sites of increased bone turnover such as that with natural growth at the physis as well as at sites of reactive bone changes that occur in response to infection. [19] [20] [21] [22] [ 18 F]NaF uptake was evaluated in this PJI model, and greater [ 18 F]NaF uptake was observed in the S. aureus-infected postoperative legs (3.9 ± 0.4 fold, n = 9) than in the sterile postoperative legs (1.4 ± 0.06 fold, n = 4, P < 0.000 3) (Fig. 3a, b) . Of note, the fold increase observed in the sterile postoperative leg compared with the contralateral non-operative leg was >1.0, which was likely due to modest bone turnover from the naturally occurring inflammatory response from the implant alone. CT imaging Femoral volumes were defined from CT scan data. To control for variability in the size of the femurs between the individual mice, data are presented as averages of the fold increase of the measurement of the postoperative femur over the contralateral, non-operative femur. The femur volumes of S. aureus-infected postoperative legs had a doubling of bone volume for the entire femur (2.1 ± 0.06, n = 8) compared with sterile, postoperative legs, which had a slight increase over their non-operative counterpart (1.2 ± 0.03, n = 4, P < 0.000 1), the large size and structural differences of which can be seen in representative scans ( Fig. 4a-e) . Taken together, CT data analysis showed that the S. aureus-infected operative legs had a marked expansion of the femur volume compared with sterile postoperative legs, which is consistent with our previous observations. 16, 23 Specificity of the anti-LTA monoclonal antibody (mAb) In order to specifically measure the infectious entity itself, we developed an immunoPET agent against LTA, a cell-surface component of Gram-positive bacteria. An anti-LTA mAb (SAC55) was identified from memory B cells isolated from a patient recovering from an S. aureus skin infection. This human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) was evaluated for binding specificity and selectivity for LTA-positive strains of pathogenic bacteria with clinical significance. Affinity measurements by Octet of SAC55 binding to immobilized LTA showed strong binding for the target (Fig. 5a) . SAC55 was also found by whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to bind specifically to LTA-positive bacteria, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis, but not to Gramnegative bacteria (specifically Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), whereas the control IgG did not bind to any of the LTA-negative bacterial species tested ( Fig. 5b) SAC55 also bound to in vitro grown S. aureus and S. epidermidis as measured by flow cytometry in the presence of human sera (Fig. 5c ), thus indicating that the binding epitope for this anti-LTA mAb is not obscured by the presence of human sera. Similarly, this anti-LTA mAb retained binding to the bacteria ex vivo, indicating that LTA is expressed, and its epitope is accessible for antibody binding on bacteria harvested from infected mice (Fig. 5d) . These results indicate that SAC55 is a valid candidate to specifically detect LTA-expressing bacteria in an infected animal. Radiolabeling and immunoPET imaging of SAC55 Anti-LTA and isotype control IgG were covalently conjugated to deferoxamine (DFO) via an isothiocyanate-amine reaction covalent linkage and subsequently radiolabeled with zirconium-89. Post-purification radioTLC confirmed purity by showing the >98% radiopurity of the labeled constructs (Fig. 6 ). ImmunoPET imaging of infected implant mice with [ 89 Zr]SAC55 and control [ 89 Zr]IgG, as well as control sterile implant mice was conducted over 168 h. On day 1 post injection, animals receiving the anti-LTA antibody had a greater signal uptake ratio than infected implant mice receiving control IgG or sterile implant mice receiving the anti-LTA antibody (Fig. 7a ). This was a surprising finding as the pharmacokinetics of full IgG, which may circulate for days or weeks, are such that the antibody typically accumulates over days as background signal reduces. As shown in the representative animals in Fig. 7b , early time points enabled clear distinction of the infected site using the specific antibody over the non-specific control or in the sterile infection model (P < 0.05 up to day 3). The specific contrast decreased over the 7 days of the experiment as nonspecific zirconium-89 uptake in the skeleton increased. A correlation analysis between of the uptake ratio of [ 89 Zr]labeled antibody and [ 18 F]FDG and [ 18 F]NaF was performed, in addition to the SUVmean values of [ 89 Zr]-labeled antibody and BLI in the leg that had undergone surgical implantation of the pin. There was no significant correlation between the different PET imaging tracers [with R 2 values (and two-tailed P-values) of 0.292 2 (0.069 6) and 0.137 4 (0.212 5), respectively]. A weak but statistically significant correlation between the standardized uptake values (SUVmean) and the bioluminescent signal yielded an R 2 value of 0.588 8 (P = 0.003 6). These correlation results indicate specificity of the antibody-targeted approach with bacterial luminescence, while there is a lack of direct association between 6 Radiopurity. Radiopurity of the immunoPET conjugates were determined by radio-instant thin layer chromatography.After purification, the activity for both SAC55 and R347 conjugates is retained at the origin, with no evidence of free zirconium migrating up the plate, indicating that injected material does not contain free zirconium-89. radiolabeled probes. While further work is required, this data indicate that a bacterial-specific tracer such as [ 89 Zr]SAC55 may have considerable value in evaluating preclinical models and could assist in detection of PJI in the clinical setting.
