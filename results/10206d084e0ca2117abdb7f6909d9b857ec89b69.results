A total of 155 articles were published within the survey period; their attributes are presented in Table 1 . The studies involved 493 authors, with 0.31 article/author (3.18 authors/article), 4.34 co-authors/article, and a collaboration index of 3.32. With the exception of two authors publishing solo, all 491 authors were involved in multi-author articles. An average of 11.49 citations/article was recorded during the study period. The scientific output related to P. shigelloides research by Lotka's law showed a beta coefficient and constant of 2.30 and 0.44, Table 2 shows the top 20 most productive authors in the field. K. Krovacek (Sweden) ranked first, co-authoring 12 (7.7%) articles; and I. Ciznar (Slovak Republic) was second with 11 (7.1%) articles. The h_index (total citations) was 7 (162) for K. Krovacek, and 6 (148) for I. Ciznar. It is worth noting that the topmost active authors were affiliated with institutions in developed nations, including Sweden (n = 6), USA (n = 5), Japan (n = 3), Spain (n = 5), Poland (n = 3), Czech Republic (n = 1), and Slovak Republic (n = 1). The 20 top cited articles on P. shigelloides are listed in S1 Table. These studies spanned the fields of infection, immunity, clinical microbiology, and biochemistry. The total no. of citations of the top-cited articles ranged from 35 to 111; most of these were the result of funded research. Research output related to P. shigelloides for the top 20 most active countries is shown in Table 3 . United States ranked first in terms of total number of articles (n = 29, 18.7%) and citations (n = 451), followed by Sweden (n = 14, 9.0%) and Germany (n = 10, 6.5%). The frequency of publication varied among the top countries from 1.3 to 18.7%. Sweden had highest productivity (1.563 article/million population) when normalized for population size using mid-period population (2003) . The rank order of these countries changed when productivity was mea- The top 20 journals with the most published articles on P. shigelloides are listed in S2 Table. These journals cover a range of subjects including carbohydrates, microbiology, food science, infectious disease, immunology, and biochemistry, reflecting active areas in Plesiomonas research. Carbohydrate Research ranked first (n = 9, 5.8%), followed by Journal of Clinical Microbiology, Folia Microbiologica and Food Biotechnology each with 6 articles (3.9%). Table 4 shows the most relevant keywords related to Plesiomonas studies, including both author keywords (DE) and Keywords-Plus (ID). Both Author Keywords (DE) and Keywords-Plus (ID) have 10 keywords in common (lipopolysaccharide, Aeromonas species, antigens, oligosaccharide, disease, children, diarrhea, Shigella, virulence, and water). Fourteen keywords were unique to Author Keywords (Plesiomonas shigelloides, nuclear magnetic resonance Ranking based on the number of articles; TC, total citations. (NMR), PCR, structure, MALDI-TOF, fish, pathogenicity, media, meningoencephalitis, resistance, enterotoxin, gastroenteritis, serotyping, and sepsis), and 13 keywords were unique to Keywords-Plus (infections, Escherichia, septicemia, environments, in-vitro, polysaccharide, Vibrio species, bacteria, biological repeating unit, iron, meningitis, humans, and strains). The unique Author Keywords primarily described medium of transmission (fish) and methods involved in isolation and characterization of the microorganism (NMR, MALDI-TOF, PCR, enterotoxin, resistance, pathogenicity, serotyping, and structure) and specific infections (meningoencephalitis, gastroenteritis, and sepsis). Author keyword terms associated with identification methods of P. shigelloides included polymerase chain reaction (PCR, n = 8, septicemia (n = 24, 15.5% (ID)), meningoencephalitis (n = 4, 2.6 (DE)), Sepsis (n = 3, 1.9% (DE)), and meningitis (n = 10, 6.5% (ID)), which ranked 5th, 11th, and 11th respectively. The common conceptual frames in retrieved articles determined by K-means clustering with three clusters of 8, 14, and 39 elements showed research responses focused on neonates (children) extraintestinal infections and gastroenteritis, elucidation of cell wall structure (lipopolysaccharides, core oligosaccharide, o-specific polysaccharide etc.), and co-infections of P. shigelloides with other pathogens, respectively (Fig 2) . The 33-element cluster explained the co-occurrence and co-infection of P. shigelloides with other bacteria. Other indicators of frequently represented concepts and frameworks related to P. shigelloides included co-occurrence of terms and keywords. S1 Fig shows the co-occurrence network of the top 20 terms associated with P. shigelloides studies, while S2 Fig shows the co-occurrence networks of keywords. These concept-related frameworks or terms included virulence, meningoencephalitis, Aeromonas, newborn, antigen, pathogenicity, sepsis, diarrhea, infections, Escherichia coli, septicemia, biological repeating unit, diarrheal disease/gastroenteritis, lipopolysaccharide, water, iron, polysaccharide, bacteremia, meningitis, septicemia, lipid-A, strains, and aquatic environments. The top 20 authors' collaboration and coupling networks on P. shigelloides studies were divided into two mega-clusters or spheres with nodes occupied solely by researchers from high-income countries (Fig 3A and 3B ). The first sphere of the authors' network comprised 13 nodes (authors) with no fewer than 10 linkages, while the second sphere included 10 nodes (authors) with the number of collaboration linkages ranging from nine to 10. Similarly, the two separate authors' coupling network spheres included 13 and 17 authors' networks, respectively; collaborative conjugation ranged from eleven nodes (authors) in the former and 18 in the latter. Fig 4 shows 50 countries' collaboration networks on P. shigelloides studies. Collaboration pathways ranged from 1 to 9. The Sweden had a high number of collaborations (n = 9), followed by United States (n = 8), Slovakia (n = 8), and Italy (n = 7). Other countries had no collaboration networks.
