A total of 360 pneumonia patients were included in the analysis: 37.5% were confirmed MERS-CoV-positive and 62.5% were confirmed MERS-CoV-negative. The mean age at presentation was 55.9 years, with a standard deviation of 20.2 years; age ranged between 16 and 109 years. Of the total sample, 6.9% had been in contact with a sick patient or camel, 60% had fever, 84.2% had at least one respiratory symptom, and 18.6% had at least one gastrointestinal symptom. The two groups were similar in the distribution of age (p = 0.220) and sex (p = 0.079). The characteristics of the sample can be found in Table 1 . Subgroup analyses are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The Chisquare test or the independent samples t-test revealed that sex (p = 0.079) and age (p = 0.220) were similar in the two groups. The risk of MERS-CoV infection was similar in patients with and without fever (p = 0.267), respiratory symptoms (p = 0.080), or gastrointestinal symptoms (p = 0.382). Severe illness (p = 0.001), contact with a sick patient or camel (p = 0.001), diabetes (p = 0.001), heart disease (p = 0.007), and renal disease (p = 0.025) were significantly associated with an increased risk of MERS-CoV infection. The independent samples Mann-Whitney U-test revealed that the WBC count (p = 0.001) and platelet count (p = 0.006) were significantly lower in patients who were positive for MERS-CoV than in those who were negative for MERS-CoV infection. In contrast, creatinine (p = 0.001), bilirubin (p = 0.001), AST (p = 0.001), and albumin (p = 0.004) were significantly higher in patients who were positive for MERS-CoV than in those who were negative for MERS-CoV infection. ALT (p = 0.352) was insignificantly higher in patients who were positive for MERS-CoV than in those who were negative for MERS-CoV infection. According to the individual ROC curve analysis (Table 3) , severe illness, diabetes, WBC count, creatinine, bilirubin, albumin, and AST were the most important predictors of MERS-CoV infection. A risk prediction model was developed using stepwise binary logistic regression (p 0.05). The model retained seven independent variables that were associated with increased odds of MERS-CoV (Table 4 ). Male sex (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.883, p = 0.043), contact with a sick patient or camel (aOR 21.915, p = 0.001), diabetes (aOR 2.703, p = 0.002), severe illness (aOR 6.312, p = 0.001), low WBC count (aOR 0.897, p = 0.001), high AST (aOR 1.007, p = 0.007), and low ALT (aOR 0.995, p = 0.024) were found to have a significant impact on the prediction of MERS-CoV. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated that this model fitted the data well (p = 0.592). This model showed substantial discrimination, with an AUC of 0.8162 and a 95% CI of 0.7651-0.8674 ( Figure  1 ). The prediction model was validated using the bootstrap procedure. A total of 200 random samples were drawn with replacements from the original sample, and the model showed a substantial ability to assess MERS-CoV infection in this study population (AUC 0.804, 95% CI 0.7838-0.8235). The findings in Table 4 were used to create a risk-probability model. The risk prediction for the model can be expressed by the following equation: predicted probability = [1 + exp(1.409-(0.633 Â male) À (3.087 Â sick patient or camel contact) À (0.995 Â diabetes) À (1.842 Â severe illness) + (0.109 Â WBC count) À (0.007 Â AST) + (0.005 Â ALT))] À1 . A calculator was developed to calculate the potential risk of MERS-CoV infection in pneumonia patients. We determined the optimal cut-off or threshold values of the probabilities to mark the differences between the high-risk and low-risk groups. When an equal weight was given for sensitivity and specificity (m = 1), the optimal cut-off value (probability !0.33) produced sensitivity and specificity of 0.716 and 0.783, respectively. When more weight was given for sensitivity than specificity (m = 0.50), the optimal cut-off value (probability !0.20) produced sensitivity and specificity of 0.902 and 0.550, respectively. When more weight was given for specificity than sensitivity (m = 1.50), the optimal cut-off value (probability !0.39) produced sensitivity and specificity of 0.647 and 0.831, respectively.
