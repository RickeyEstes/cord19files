We enrolled 310 neonates after screening 3421 neonates from August 2012 to May 2014; of these, 281 children (90.6%) had completed 3 years of follow-up as on 31 March 2017. IPFT (all three manoeuvres) was successfully performed in 225 (80%) children at 3 years of follow-up (figure 1). The demographic characteristics of children who had completed IPFT at 3 years (n=225) and those who did not complete all three IPFTs, excluded or lost to follow-up (n=85) were similar ( effect of ARI during infancy on IPFT indices at 3 years of age Among the TBFVL indices, children who had suffered from ARI during infancy did not show a significant change in V T and t PTEF /t E (ratio of time to peak tidal expiratory flow to total expiratory time); other indices, namely TEF 10 (tidal expiratory flow at 10% of tidal expiratory volume), TEF 25 (tidal expiratory flow at 25% of tidal expiratory volume), TEF 25 /PTEF (peak TEF) and TEF 50 /PTEF were significantly increased in comparison with children who did not have documented ARI episode during infancy. RTC indices did not show a significant difference between children with or without ARI episode during infancy. In RVRTC, indices for forced timed lung Open access effect of viral ARI during infancy on IPFT indices at 3 years of age TBFVL indices for airway resistance, namely TEF 25 /PTEF and TEF 50 /PTEF were significantly increased in children who had documented viral ARI episode during infancy in comparison to children without history of any ARI episode. No significant difference in any RTC indices was observed in the two groups. RVRTC indices for forced timed lung volume, namely FEV 0.5 , FEV 0.75 , FEV 1.0 and FEV and for forced expiratory flow rate, namely MEF 10 , MEF 25 and FEF were significantly decreased in children at 3 years of age with documented viral ARI episode during infancy (table 6) . Detection of virus in ARI in infancy was also associated with an increase in TEF 50 /PTEF (β coefficient=1.96, 95% CI: 0.29 to 3.63, p=0.02) and TEF 25 /PTEF (β coeffi-cient=3.0, 95% CI: 0.19 to 5.81, p=0.03), when adjusted for gender, family history of atopy, weight and baseline IPFT indices.
