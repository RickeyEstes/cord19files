We assembled the PPIs of IFITM1 and IFITM3 ('IFITM interactome', Figure 1 ) by computing novel PPIs using the HiPPIP model and collecting known PPIs from publicly available databases. We found that the interactors of IFITMs are involved in relevant functions including immunity. Functional annotations of the novel interactors of IFITM1 and IFITM3, sourced from Wiki-Pi 49 , revealed two main categories: development and innate immunity. Pathways associated with IFITM interactome computed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis SuiteÂ® are given in Table 1 . Gene Ontology biological process terms associated with the interactome, compiled with BiNGO 48 are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. DEAF1, which encodes for deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor 1 homolog, is a transcription factor that binds to TTCG elements in DNA and is involved in neural tube closure, embryonic skeletal development and anatomic structure morphogenesis, and other functions 50 . Additionally, DEAF1 is preferentially expressed in the CNS, particularly during early embryonic development. Mutations in DEAF1 have been associated withintellectual disability 51 . A study involving Sendai-virus infected mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) found that DEAF1-/-deficient mice had lower levels of IFN-beta mRNA compared to the wild type controls, along with lower mRNA levels of other markers of viral infection 52 . FNDC3B, a membrane protein, was found to be associated with heart rate, height and corneal structure through genome-wide association studies. While its own functions are unknown, its known interactors are involved in regulation of glial cell apoptotic process, regulation of ion transport (sodium, potassium, calcium) and several cardiac processes. 45 ; any interactions that may be published in literature but not curated into these databases would not be seen here. Table 2 for a list of terms associated with some selected genes. SPTA1 which encodes for Spectrin alpha, erythrocytic 1 is among the predicted interactors with functional annotations related to innate immunity. It is a molecular scaffold protein that is involved in linking the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton, thereby guiding cell shape and other processes pertaining to the cell's structure 53 . It is also involved in neural functions of actin filament organization, neurite outgrowth and axon guidance. Considering that IFITM1 and IFITM3 regulate permeability of the cell membrane, it is plausible that SPTA1 is also involved in aiding the host cell's architecture to impede infection. Another predicted interactor that could be related to the host cell's defense against infection is RASSF7, which is localized to the microtubule organizing center. While its function is unknown, it has known interactions with proteins that are involved in cell proliferation in the brain, regulation of neuroblast proliferation, nervous system development, synaptic vesicle fusion to presynaptic membrane, and viral budding and assembly. Other predicted interactors include TSSC4, TLR7, and ARPC1B. TSSC4 is predicted to interact with both IFITM1 and IFITM3. TSSC4's functions are unknown but its known interactions suggest that it may be involved in viral penetration into host nucleus, protein import into nucleus and immune response signaling, among other processes. TLR7 is involved in several functions and pathways related to innate immunity. It belongs to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) protein family and is involved in the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), along with stimulating the innate immune response by producing cytokines 54 . Its known interactions have cellular components related to membrane components and protein binding. ARPC1B is part of actin related protein 2/3 complex; its known interactions suggest that it may be involved in processes of neuronal development such as axonogensis and development, neuron differentiation, nervous system development, and in immune related processessuch as the innate immune response, regulation of the immune response, etc. 16 . We examined whether any of the interacting genes were differentially expressed in that study and found five genes that were differentially expressed with a small fold-change but with significant p-value (< 0.005) ( Table 2) : CD81, NME5, and RASSF7 were found to be under-expressed and FNDC3B and UIMC1 were found to be over-expressed (Table 3) .
