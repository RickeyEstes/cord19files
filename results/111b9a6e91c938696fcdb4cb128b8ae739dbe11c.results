35 patients with COVID-19 were recruited in this study, the range of their age was 37-88, with a mean age of 61·5 years (SD =11·2; Table 1 ). Most patients were natives of Wuhan (n =29, 82.9%), and only one had directly contacted with Huanan seafood market. The most common chronic medical diseases were hypertension (n =12, 34.3%) and diabetes (n =7, 20%). As for gynecological diseases, uterine fibroids were mentioned the most (n =13, 37·1%). Other diseases included cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) III, endometrial atypical hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer, with one patient for each disease. Most patients had entered menopause (n =28, 80%). For the rest 7 patients, except for 1 puerperal woman who had a cesarean section 2 days before with breast milk and neonatal throat swab SARS-CoV-2 negative, the remaining 6 patients still had menstruation, in which half of them complained of decreased menstrual flow. The most common first symptom was fever (n =25, 71·4%), Due to the special diagnostic principles in Wuhan; only 27 (77·1%) patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (Throat swab). The remaining 8 patients were clinically diagnosed depend on the images of CT scan (Table2). All patients in this study were classified at admission, including mild group (n =1, 2·9%), severe group (n =32, 91·4%) and critical group (n =2, 5·7%, Table 2 ). After admission, the white blood cell count was decreased in 5 (14·3%) patients and increased in 4 patients (11·4%, Table 3 ). 16 (45·7%) patients had a lymphocyte count reduction, while 18 patients (51.4%) had a lymphocyte ratio below the normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) level was increased in 14 (40%) patients. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate accelerated in 19 (54·3%) patients. 10 (28.6%) patients had increased aspartate transaminase (AST), and 13 (37·1%) patients had elevated alanine transaminase (ALT). The serum potassium was decreased in 5 patients (14·3%) and increased in 3 patients (8·6%). All rights reserved.

IL-2R, IL-6, and TNF-α were higher than the normal range in half or more patients, respectively. Notably, 9 (32·1%) patients' level of IL-2R, IL-6, and TNF-α increased altogether. Every patient showed typical findings of chest CT images-multiple patchy ground-glass shadows in lungs. Typical images from each group were demonstrated ( Figure 1 ). Most patients received antiviral and antibiotic treatment (n =33, 94·3% and n =29, 82·9% respectively), 13 (37·1%) patients received glucocorticoids ( Table 2 ). 9 (25·7%) patients received intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. Three (8·6%) patients received anticoagulant therapy. Oxygen therapy was used for every patient. Most of the patients received oxygen by mask or nasal catheter. Only 2 (5·7%) patients received non-invasive ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and they were free of BiPAP on the day we collected the samples. No patient received Invasive ventilation ( Table 2 ). By the end of Feb 22, 1 (2·9%) patient had been discharged, and all other patients were still in the hospital ( Table 1) . The infection rate for the 35 female patents' sexual partner was up to 42·9%, but only 2 patients, Patient 14 and 19, admitted having sexual behavior with their partners from 14 days before the onset of first symptoms to the day we collected samples (Table 1, Table 4 , Figure 2 ). The detailed timelines are exhibited ( Figure 2 ). Both patients use intrauterine device for contraception. Patient 14 was 48 years old. She had regular sex behavior during the 14 days before first symptom ( Figure 2 ). While stopped since she suffered from fever with a highest temperature above 39·0℃. Patient 19 was 41 years old. Her duration of sex behavior was longer than patient 14, which ended at the day she was diagnosed by throat swab. Her first symptom was also fever, but the highest temperature (38·9℃) is lower than patient 14 and her symptoms were mild in need of lower flow of oxygen ( Figure 2 ). Patient 19's partner was clinical diagnosed with COVID-19, while patient 14's was not. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted using the vaginal environment and anal swab samples of 35 female patients with COVID-19. All the vaginal environment samples (35 cases in total) were negative. One anal swab sample (35 cases in total) All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Her husband was also diagnosed with COVID-19, while they had no sexual behavior from 14 days before the first of symptoms to the day samples collected.
