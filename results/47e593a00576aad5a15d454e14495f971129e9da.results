Between October 2002 and February 2003, 928 stool samples were received. There were 50 stools positive for TcdA and TcdB by EIA (5.4%). On second look culture, there were an additional 38 stools which grew C. difficile whose culture filtrates were TcdA and TcdB positive by EIA (overall 9.5%). We were unable to isolate C. difficile from 20 stools which were toxin positive by EIA on direct testing. Combining the numbers of toxigenic strains and culture negative/direct toxin positive specimens, the incidence of CDAD was 3.2 cases per 1000 admissions or discharges and 53.8 cases per 100 000 patient days. The breakdown of cases by specialty is shown in Table 1 . The breakdown of cases by age group is shown in Table 2 . The breakdown of cases by ethnic origin and sex are shown in Tables 3 and 4 , respectively. Fourteen (11.8%) isolates were negative for TcdA but positive for TcdB. All A 2 B + strains had a smaller PCR product (700 bp) for tcdA, in keeping with the phenotype. 6 All isolates were susceptible to metronidazole, one strain showed intermediate resistance to vancomycin, and only 12.8% of the strains were susceptible to clindamycin. Sixtythree percent of isolates were fully resistant to clindamycin Table 5 . A selection of the most representative PCR ribotypes is shown in Fig. 2 . Thirty-five isolates had PCR ribotype A of which 29 (83%) had a clindamycin MIC .256 mg/L. Thirty-three had PCR ribotype B, of which only one (3%) had a clindamycin MIC .256 mg/L. The 14 A 2 B + isolates were all PCR ribotype C and had a range of MICs to clindamycin from 2 to .256 mg/L. There were seven PCR ribotypes representing 2-3 isolates each. The remaining isolates had unique PCR ribotypes.
