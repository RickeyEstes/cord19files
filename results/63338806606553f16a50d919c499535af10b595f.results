463 children met the inclusion criteria from 604 screened for the study (figure 1). Parents of 167 children declined participation, another 60 children were already enrolled in a parallel trial and also declined, while 57 were recruited, but did not have a treated exacerbation during the study period. Overall, 179 children had an exacerbation and were randomly assigned to either amoxicillinclavulanate (n=97) or azithromycin (n=82) between April 17, 2012, and Aug 30, 2016. Recruitment continued beyond the planned sample size of 170 because each centre had their own randomisation list with block randomisation, and some of the children recruited from remote or rural areas were given the study medication during their baseline visit to start at the time of their next exacerbation. The last follow-up visit was on Feb 27, 2017. Characteristics of the two groups were similar at baseline (table 1) and at the beginning of an exacerbation (appendix p 10). Of the 94 children who completed 3 weeks of treatment and returned the empty bottles, medication adherence was 48 (96%) of 50 in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group and 38 (86%) of 44 in the azithromycin group (p=0·14). In the per-protocol population, the number of children whose exacerbation symptoms had resolved by day 21 was 73 (83·9%) of 87 in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group versus 61 (83·6%) of 73 in the azithromycin group. The risk difference was -0·3% (95% CI -11·8 to 11·1), falling within the a-priori 20% non-inferiority margin (figure 2). In a sensitivity analysis of the intention-to-treat popu lation, exacer bations had resolved by day 21 in 75 (77·3%) of 97 children in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group and 63 (76·8%) of 82 in the azithromycin group, with a risk difference of -0·5% (95% CI -12·9 to 11·9). The median time to resolution of exacerbation was 4 days shorter in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group than in the azithromycin group in both the per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses (table 2). By contrast, the median time to next exacerbations was similar in both groups (table 2, appendix p 6). The likelihood of having an exacerbation during follow-up was similar between groups: in the per-protocol, the hazard ratio was 0·8 (95% CI 0·5-1·2; p=0·3) and in the intention-to-treat group it was 0·8 (95% CI 0·6-1·2; p=0·5). Similarly, we detected no significant differences between groups for changes in inflammatory biomarkers, FEV 1 % predicted, or parent cough-specific quality-of-life scores (table 3) . Of the 113 children who provided paired nasal swab specimens on day 1 and day 21, 74 bacterial pathogens were cultured (H influenzae, S pneumoniae, M catarrhalis, or Staphylococcus aureus) from 55 (48·7%) children on day 1 (appendix pp [11] [12] . The bacteriological profile in nasal swabs, including carriage of azithromycin-resistant organisms, was similar in both treatment groups at the start of an exacerbation (appendix pp [11] [12] . One child whose sputum contained Pseudomonas aeruginosa withdrew from the trial to begin anti-pseudomonal therapy. By day 21, the number of children carrying these pathogens had more than halved and all patients carrying S pneumoniae on day 1 had cleared it, except for one child in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group. Of the children whose swabs contained pathogens at day 21, four (29%) of 14 in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group and eight (80%) of ten who received azithromycin carried  Intention-to-treat population (95% CI) Per-protocol population (95% CI) azithromycin-resistant organisms. The azithromycinresistant S aureus isolates in both treatment groups did not change during the study (appendix pp [11] [12] .
