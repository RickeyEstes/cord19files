All subjects completed specimen collection safely. Ten healthy subjects were used for controls. Sputum and cough specimens were successfully collected from 20 adult patients with CF, with the exception of five patients who could not produce a sputum specimen. Normal controls demonstrated a high incidence of false positives from oral sampling, shown in Table 1 . Bacteria were isolated from throat swabs in 4/10 (40%) normal, healthy control subjects. S. pneumoniae was positive in 2/10 (20%) oral specimens and S. aureus was positive in 3/10 (30%) oral specimens, with one subject positive for both bacteria. In contrast, 0/10 (0%, p=0.0313) cough specimens were positive for bacteria in normal controls. The calculated true negative rate or specificity for sputum specimens was 60% and 100% for cough specimens. Specificity in the CF patients was similar. For the CF patients, S. mitis was isolated from 13/14 (93%) sputum specimens but in none of the cough specimens (0%, p=0.0002). The cough specimens collected no S. mitis. CFRB was collected in both specimen types. P. aeruginosa was isolated from 13/15 (87%) sputum specimens and 9/20 (45%) cough specimens (p=0.0213). S. aureus was isolated from 9/15 (60%) sputum specimens and 3/20 (15%) cough specimens. K. pneumoniae was isolated from 2/15 (13%) sputum specimens and 3/20 (15%) cough specimens. In aggregate, sputum specimens were positive for CFRB in 15/15 (100%) samples. Cough specimens were positive for CFRB in 13/20 (65%) samples. The sputum specimens had a 93% rate of oral commensals. Sputum specimens were positive for three or more pathogens in 2/15 (13%) samples, and positive for two or more pathogens in 7/15 (47%) samples. In contrast, cough specimens had no commensals and were positive in 65% of the CF patients. The cough specimens were positive for two or more pathogens in 2/20 (10%, p<0.05) specimens and no cough specimens were positive for three or more pathogens. The results of these real-time PCR identifications are listed in Table 2 . C T values are inversely proportional to the quantity of bacteria in a sample, i.e. small values indicate higher quantities of colony forming units (CFU). For the CFRB samples, P. aeruginosa C T values ranged from 18-33 in sputum specimens and 33-42 in cough specimens. S. aureus C T values ranged from 24-38 in sputum specimens and 36-40 in cough specimens. For both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus the cough and sputum specimens significantly differed in C T values (p=0.0017 and 0.0092, respectively). K. pneumoniae C T values ranged from 37-38 in sputum specimens and 39-43 in cough specimens. Thus, the C T values for cough specimens were consistently higher than those of sputum. Note that the cough filter samples from normal controls exhibited no pathogens up to C T values of 60.
