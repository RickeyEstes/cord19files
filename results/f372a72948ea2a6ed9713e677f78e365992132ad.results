We have developed and validated a diagnostic PCR-based low density oligonucleotide microarray for the detection of 16 viral and 2 bacterial respiratory pathogens. In initial studies the oligonucleotide microarray probe specificity was assessed using known positive specimens (i.e. either external quality assessment samples or clinical material confirmed by rtPCR and/or sequencing) and then analytical sensitivity was evaluated by serial dilution of biotinylated target amplicons and hybridisation to the array. Table 3 lists the QSVs for each of the individual pathogen probes, the mean internal staining controls, the background signal for the assay, the background signal for an equivalent 'negative' assay as well as the factor by which the signal is greater than the background level. Excluding Coronavirus OC43 which had a QSV of 0.55, the remaining probes exhibited QSVs between 0.62 and 0.95, with the median QSV being 0.77. All internal staining controls had a QSV of ≥0.84. The minimum factor by which the probe signal was greater than the background was a factor of 80 (coronavirus OC43) and the maximum was 529 (RSV subtype B). Certain pathogens that had multiple probes of differing sequences showed a greater specificity for a single probe sequence, e.g. Parainfluenza-3; 0.85, 0.81 and 0.73 for all 3 probes respectively. The analytical sensitivity of the microarray was evaluated using a serial dilution of individual targets of known concentration. The majority of the probes exhibited a reduced sensitivity below 50 pg of target DNA/cDNA and a complete loss of signal below 5 pg of target DNA for all probes (data not shown). Some signal was observed at 5 pg of target DNA for the probes RSV subtype A, Rhinovirus-03 and -04, with Rhinovirus-03 still yielding a QSV of approximately 0.63. A cohort of clinical specimens were tested by both multiplex rtPCR and DNA microarray analysis (n = 50) to assess the performance of the DNA microarray for clinical investigation. The results are summarised in Table 4 Table 4 illustrates the clinical sensitivity of the DNA microarraybased assay. Real-time PCR C t values are listed for all positive specimens alongside DNA microarray results. All six targets not detected by DNA microarray analysis were weakly positive via rtPCR analysis, and had C t values >40 with 4/6 having C t values of ≥45. For all of the clinical samples tested, the QSVs were ≥0.60 and had a background of ≤0.10. We next attempted to determine the clinical relevance of the findings from the rtPCR and microarray analysis. Only the specimens positive by DNA microarray analysis and with C t values <40 in rtPCR were included in this analysis (n = 17) ( Table 5 ). Among these 17 positive test results two patients had a concomitant bacterial respiratory tract infections (M. pneumoniae). Antibiotic treatment had been implemented in 13 of the remaining 15 patients and 8 patients had been admitted to hospital. Two patients with an admitting diagnosis of pneumonia and an infiltrate on chest X-ray were positive for M. pneumoniae and their antibiotic treatment was therefore con-sidered appropriate. As the majority of other patients neither had an elevated peripheral white cell count nor significant chest X-ray infiltrates, it seems plausible that if a positive viral test result would have been available for clinicians less antibiotics would have been prescribed.
