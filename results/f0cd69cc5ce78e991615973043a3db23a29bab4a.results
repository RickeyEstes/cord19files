In contrast to what has been reported for domestic cats and exotic felids in zoos (11, 12, 33) , no macroscopic lesions in the skin or lungs could be ascribed to a cowpox virus infection. OPV PCR amplifi cation products of expected size (≈339 bp) were detected in tissues from 24 lynx (9.1%, 95% confi dence interval [CI] 5.9%-13.3%). Mean age of the 24 lynx with positive results by PCR and exact age data was 2.5 years ± 2.6 SD. Of the PCR-positive lynx, 18 were in normal body condition, 1 showed no visible signs of disease except for otodectic otoacariasis and being in poor condition, and 5 were emaciated and had sarcoptic mange (Table) . Prevalence differed signifi cantly between apparently healthy (7.7%, 95% CI 4.7%-11.7%) and diseased (29.4%, 95% CI 10.3%-55.9%; p = 0.012) lynx and between lynx in normal body condition (7.8%, 95% CI 4.7-12.1) and those that were emaciated (33.3%, 95% CI 11.8%-61.6%; p = 0.007). Most diseased and emaciated lynx had sarcoptic mange, and difference in prevalence was most signifi cant between those with (33.3%, 95% CI 11.8%-61.6%) and without (7.7%, 95% CI 4.7%-11.7%; p = 0.007) sarcoptic mange. A signifi cant difference was also found between areas with sparse human inhabitants (5.3%, 95% CI 1.5-12.9) and areas with higher human density (14.3%, 95% CI 8.4-22.2; p = 0.016). Yearly prevalence of animals having OPV DNA varied from 5.3% in 1997 (95% CI 1.5-12.9) to 20% in 1995 (95% CI 0.5-71.6), but differences were not signifi cant. No signifi cant differences were observed between sexes, age classes, or seasons. Sequence data were obtained from 21 of 24 samples positive by PCR (Figure 2 ). The partial tk gene sequences were identical for all 21 samples. The obtained OPV tk gene sequences were also identical to that of a cowpox virus isolate from a person in Norway (No.H1) and differed by1 nt substitution from a cowpox virus isolate from a felid in Norway (No.F1) (Figure 2 ). In addition, the generated OPV tk gene sequences differed from those of CPXV-BR and of cowpox virus isolates from Sweden (Swe.H1 and Swe.H2) by multiple nucleotide substitutions ( Figure  2 ). Phylogenetic analysis of the OPV tk gene sequences revealed that they clustered with the tk gene of cowpox virus No.H1 and cowpox virus GRI (30) but separated from that of cowpox virus isolates from Sweden (Swe.H1and Swe.H2) and from CPXV-BR ( Figure 3 ).
