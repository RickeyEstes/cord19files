Data for five outbreaks are presented (2012-2016) and together illustrate clearly how, despite key parameters being constant, stochastic effects and differences in behaviour from year-to-year affect the outcome of the outbreak. For each year, identical starting conditions were used (i.e. the outbreak was seeded with three infections and an R 0 of 1.8 was assumed). The class size increased over time from 56 students in 2012-84 in 2016. Each outbreak showed different temporal transmission dynamics (Fig. 1) , however, each outbreak was broadly summarised by having one major chain of transmission resulting from one of the three seeds. A strong time effect was observed within each outbreak, with the majority of transmission observed within short windows of time each day when frequent contacts occurred. This is highlighted within the visualisation of the outbreak, which show long periods of inactivity (Supplementary Movies). This effect can be seen in the strongly multimodal distributions describing the students' behaviour (Fig. 2) . There was substantial variation in the cumulative attack rate, with between 26% âˆ’ 83% students uninfected at the end of each outbreak. Saturation effects were also observed in each year, with an overall decline in the proportion of infectious contacts that led to successful infections observed from day 1 to day 5, except in 2013 reflecting the observed low cumulative attack rate for that year. Computer-simulations of a process similar to the classroom outbreak reveal potential explanations for some of the differences between years. For the 2016 outbreak, the number of infected individuals peaked at 28 on day 2 (Fig. 3a) . Simulated numbers of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals broadly capture the magnitude of the outbreak. However, the simulated curves are delayed by approximately two days when the generation and recovery times are sampled from a Poisson distribution (Fig. 3b) . Sampling from the observed distributions provides an improved representation, with the diurnal patterns of the outbreak being better captured by the simulated mean, though a discrepancy remains (Fig. 3c) . Subsequent comparisons between the simulated outbreaks and the observed outbreaks were consequently made with simulations using the empirical re-sampling method (Fig. 4) . Simulations captured the observed outbreak in 2012 well, however, simulations proceeded too quickly for 2013, 2014 and 2015, and failed to accommodate the slow transmission dynamics over the first 3 days followed by bursts of transmission in the final 2 days. In contrast, the simulation method lagged the 2016 outbreak and failed to capture the fast transmission dynamics on the first day.
