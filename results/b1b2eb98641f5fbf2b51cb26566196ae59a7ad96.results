In total 3,840 respondents participated in the seven surveys; per survey the number of participants varied between 467 and 650. Overall response was 64% and varied between 55% and 77% (see Table 1 ). In all but one, (i.e. the August 2006 survey) the majority of respondents were women, in total 54%. Compared to the general Dutch population, where 51% is female, women are slightly overrepresented in our surveys. The proportion of women in the first 4 surveys was lower compared to the last 3 surveys (51% vs. 58%, χ 2 (df ) = 16.5 [1] ; p < 0.001) ( Table 2 ). Comparative vulnerability for AI was 2.59 (95% CI 2.56 -2.61, scale 1 - Almost half of the respondents (46%) reported taking one or more preventive measures, with 36% reporting to have stayed away from (wild) birds or poultry, 26% not going to areas where AI was present and 2% buying antiviral drugs (see Table 3 ). 54% of respondents did not take any measures, 13% took one measure, 14% took two measures, 10% took three and another 10% took four or more measures. In the regression analyses, time was not significantly associated with perceived severity (β = -0.002, p = 0.772) and for perceived vulnerability the regression coefficient of time was just short of being statistically significant (β = -0.011, p = 0.08). Time was significantly associated with amount of information received (β = -0.065, p < 0.001), knowledge (β = -0.127, p < 0.001) and taking preventive measures (Table 3 ). In the pairwise comparisons, some more significant differences in variables of interest were found between different surveys. Perceived severity was stable over the seven surveys, ranging between 90% There was a significant increase in the percentage of respondents who had taken preventive measures between March and June 2006 from 38% to 50% (χ 2 (df ) = 18.4 [1] , p < 0.001), while there was no difference among the second until the last survey, ranging from 50% in the second survey to 43% in the fourth survey (χ 2 (df ) = 8.2 [5] , p = Figure 3 ). No differences in risk perceptions, precautionary actions or information received were observed related to the specific events (August 2006 and February 2007) when compared to the previous and consecutive surveys. Most demographic factors and knowledge and information determinants were significantly associated with perceived vulnerability (Table 4 ). Perceived vulnerability was higher for women, for elder respondents, for respondents without children below 12, for those with a lower education, for those who thought more about AI, for those with a lower level of knowledge and for those vaccinated against influenza. Ethnicity and amount of infor-mation were not significantly associated with perceived vulnerability. In univariate logistic analysis of precautionary behaviour as the dependent (outcome) variable, the demographic variables, the specific surveys and variables from the Protection Motivation Theory were included as independent variables (Table 5 ). Of the demographic variables all, apart from gender and keeping chicken or poultry, were significantly associated with precautionary behaviour. Respondents with a higher age, a lower education, without children below 12, of non-Dutch ethnicity, and those who had been vaccinated against influenza were more likely to take preventive measures. Furthermore preventive measures were taken more often by those respondents who considered AI very severe, who had a higher perceived vulnerability, who had a higher self efficacy, who had less knowledge, who had received more information about AI and thought more about AI. Compared to the first survey, respondents in the subsequent surveys reported to have taken precautionary measures more often.
