The first example of epidemiological detection of events of interest obtained with the GPs' data, shown in Figure  2A , focused on the summer of 2003, when France was hit by a heat wave that killed more than 15,000 persons [25] . A specific pattern (Figures 2A and 2B) corresponding to general and metabolic symptoms (fever, weakness, impaired general condition and dehydration) can be easily recognized. We also analyzed the GPs' data concerning influenza-like surveillance over a 7-year period (see Additional file 2, which contains a slide show composed of 82 successive images). The visual changes of disease-associated color patterns generated by the successively entered codes that paralleled flu epidemics are apparent [26] . Note that this example is not provided to proclaim that the visual method should replace in this instance the classical supervised statistical outbreak-detection methods, which are used routinely. It is given as proof-of-concept of the proposed unsupervised method, as it enables the recognition of the influenza outbreaks that are objectively defined with the supervised techniques. In the second example, we used data from an HED to evaluate whether the technique was able to detect an outbreak of flu-like disease in a timely manner in another setting, with different patients, coded differently. This example also shows that standard methods of image analysis (such as subtraction of images, smoothing, etc) can be used in the present application. We examined the ICPCviews corresponding, as above, to: the week just before the outbreak (week 3/2006), the week at the outbreak peak (week 6/2006), the week after the outbreak (week 14/ 2006), and the rest of the year taken as a control period. We then subtracted the control ICPCview from the three ICPCviews being considered. The pattern for the week preceding the outbreak ICPCview clearly foresees that seen during the week of the outbreak peak ( Figures 3A and  3B ) [27] . This pattern combines general symptoms (fever) and digestive symptoms (abdominal pain and vomiting), Figure 1 A. Graphic reference frame of ICPCview. Each green cell corresponds to an ICPC-2 code. The upper part corresponds to general systems (social, skin, general, hematology, metabolic, musculoskeletal). The lower part, mimicking body anatomy, corresponds to systems: the head, on the top, contains in the top-down order: psychiatry, neurology, eye pathology, ear pathology; the trunk, under the head, contains in top-down order, the rectangles corresponding to the different systems successively: cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, urology, pregnancy, female and male genitals. The limb-like structures group the ICPC-2 codes respectively corresponding to localized pathologies of the musculoskeletal system. See Additional file 1. B. Enlarged version of the diagnoses and symptoms of the respiratory system Globally, there are two sets of rows: one set of four rows corresponding to "inflammatory and infectious diseases" and another set of one row, corresponding to tumors. However, some pathologies inside these sets are neither inflammatory-infectious nor tumors (for example "other respiratory trauma"). The ordinal criterion of arrangement of codes may be fuzzy: for example asthma, which is far from the medial line, has various manifestations, some severe or others not. It was placed here to be close to "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", which is above it. The pathologies outside the rectangle, which belong to the musculoskeletal system, have been removed.
