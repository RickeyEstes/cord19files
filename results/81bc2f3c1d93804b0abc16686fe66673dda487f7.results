Time-Scaled Phylogeny of the VP1 and RdRp Regions in the GII.P17-GII.17 Strains We constructed time-scaled phylogenetic trees using the MCMC method based on the full-length of the VP1 (343 strains) and RdRp (133 strains) regions in the GII.17 strains detected in the various countries (Figures 1, 2) . The MCMC tree for the VP1 region estimated that the common ancestor of the GII.17, GII.13, and GII.21 diverged in September, 1931 (95% HPD January, 1911 -February, 1950 . A common ancestor of the GII.17 strains diverged in November, 1948 (95% HPD September, 1934 -November, 1961 ) and further diverged into seven clusters by around October, 2011. Of these, the GII.P17-GII.17 strains belonged to clusters 1 and 2 (Figure 1) . The GII.17 strains in clusters 3, 4, 5, and 6 (no information on the RdRp sequence in cluster 7) were composed of the distinct RdRp genotypes, including GII.P3, GII.P16, GII.P4, and GII.Pe, respectively (Figure 1 and Table S1 ). Most strains of the GII.P17-GII.17 belonged to the cluster 1 (the Kawasaki308 type). The common ancestor of the cluster 1 diverged in October, 2011 (95% HPD May, 2009 -August, 2013 , while that of cluster 2 (the Kawasaki323 type) emerged in July, 2010 (95% HPD July, 2007-September, 2012) (Figure 1) . Moreover, analyses of phylogenetic distances exhibited no overlap between intra-and inter-cluster peaks at a value of 0.035 ( Figure 3A ).With respect to the RdRp region (Figure 2) , the common ancestor of the GII.P17 and GII.P3 diverged in January, 1988 (95% HPD December, 1980 -May, 1993 ). Subsequently, the common ancestor of the GII.P17 diverged in October, 2009 (95% HPD May, 2006 -April, 2012 and then further into two clusters by around August, 2012. The GII.P17-GII.17 strains were contained in clusters 1 and 2 in the RdRp region, which was compatible with the classification in the VP1 region. Most strains of the GII.P17-GII.17 also belonged to cluster 1 (the Kawasaki308 type). The common ancestor of cluster 1 diverged in August, 2012 (95% HPD December, 2010-January, 2014), while that of cluster 2 (the Kawasaki323 type) did so in April, 2011 (95% HPD September, 2009 -October, 2012 . Furthermore, phylogenetic distances overlapped between the intra-and inter-cluster peaks ( Figure 3B) . These results suggest that the GII.P17-GII.17 strains emerged and formed two variants in approximately the past 10 years. Phylodynamics of GII.P17-GII.17 Strains in the VP1 Region We estimated the transition of population sizes of GII.P17-GII.17 in the VP1 region using a Bayesian skyline plot. The population of this region increased sharply in around 2014 and remained constant from 2016 after an immediate reduction (Figure 4) . These results suggest that this was compatible between the fluctuation of the plot and actually epidemiological GII.17 prevalence.
