Simulations indicate that the generalized-growth model supports different epidemic growth profiles, as the "deceleration" parameter (p) is varied between zero and one (Fig. 1) . These profiles include linear incidence (i.e., p = 0.5), concave-up incidence (p > 0.5), and concave-down incidence (p < 0.5) patterns whereas the relative growth rates decline inversely with time ( Fig. 1) . Moreover, epidemic size is predicted to be highly sensitivity to small variations in the deceleration parameter p, as shown in Fig. 2 . Overall, our analysis of empirical disease data using the generalized-growth model revealed a diversity of profiles across infectious disease outbreaks, with most estimates of p displaying substantial uncertainty (overall mean p = 0.61 SD = 0.26) ( Table 1, Fig. 3 ). Figs. 4-9 display a representative set of model fits to the 19 infectious disease outbreaks. Estimates of p ranged from 0.14 for the Ebola outbreak in Bomi, Liberia (2014), reflecting a slow epidemic growth pattern, to 0.85 for a major plague epidemic in Bombay (1905), 0.95 for the smallpox outbreak in Khulna (1972) , and 0.98 for pandemic influenza in San Francisco (1918), consistent with near-exponential growth dynamics (Figs. 4 and 5). The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Uruguay at the farm level displayed a low mean estimate of p at 0.4, characterizing a profile of slower growth (Figs. 6 and 1). We found evidence for sub-exponential growth in annual incidence data on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Japan (1985 -2012 ) and New York City (1982 -2002 ,   Fig. 3 . Estimates of p and corresponding 95% confidence intervals derived from various infectious disease outbreak datasets of case incidence series by fitting the generalizedgrowth model to the initial phase of the epidemics as explained in the text. The vertical dashed line separates Ebola and non-Ebola outbreak estimates. Estimates and 95% confidence intervals for parameters r and p obtained by nonlinear least-square fitting the generalized growth model to an increasing amount of case incidence data during the initial epidemic growth phase are shown in the first two panels. The statistical comparisons of the generalized-growth model fit to the simpler exponential growth model where p = 1 (gray shaded periods indicate periods where the generalized-growth model provides a better fit compared to the exponential growth model) are also shown in the upper right panel. Representative fits of the generalized-growth model to various epidemic growth phases are displayed in the bottom panels. a disease that is largely spread through sexual contact via bodily fluids. The mean estimate of the deceleration parameter p for time series of new HIV/AIDS cases in Japan was estimated at about 0.5 which is consistent with an approximately linear growth pattern (Fig. 7) whereas the AIDS case reports in New York City showed slightly faster growth pattern with mean p estimated at 0.57. The wealth of Ebola data available at the district level for the 2013-2015 epidemic in West Africa provides a good opportunity to gauge variations in the growth profile of a given pathogen over space. Estimates of p across local Ebola outbreaks varied substantially (mean = 0.59, range: 0.14-0.97). The districts of Margibi in Liberia, and Bombali and Bo in Sierra Leone, displayed near exponential growth (p close to 1), while the districts of Bomi in Liberia and Kenema in Sierra Leone displayed particularly slow growth (p near 0.1) (Fig. 3) . Of particular interest is the shape of the epidemic in the district where the 2013-2015 Ebola epidemic is assumed to have originated, in Gueckedou, Guinea. We estimate an intermediate pattern of growth there, albeit with wide uncertainty (p = 0.71 95% CI: 0.31, 1.0). Further, Montserrado, the Liberian capital, displayed moderate values of p (0.60 95% CI: 0.46, 0.77) (Fig. 8) , which is in close agreement with those of Western Area Urban and Western Area Rural in Sierra Leone with mean p at 0.46-0.68 (Figs. 3 and 9 ).
