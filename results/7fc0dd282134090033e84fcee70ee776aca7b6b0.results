Among the 190 study subjects, 108 (57%) were RVP positive for viral pathogens and 82 (43%) were RVP negative. Univariate analysis revealed that age >65 years and leukocytosis were significantly associated with a negative RVP PCR (P = .04 and P = .001, respectively). Additionally, higher white blood cell count and creatinine values on admission were significantly associated with being RVP PCR negative (P = .003 and P = .01, respectively), suggesting a bacterial etiology for pneumonia (Table 1) . Clinical outcomes were similar between the RVP-positive and RVP-negative groups. Among the patients who were RVP positive, 72% were continued on antibiotic treatment for â‰¥2 days after the diagnosis of pneumonia versus 90% of those who were RVP negative (P = .002) ( Table 2 ).
