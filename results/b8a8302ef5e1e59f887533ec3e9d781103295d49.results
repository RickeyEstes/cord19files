The ISG15 System Targets a Broad Range of Proteins ISG15 conjugation can be observed experimentally by treating HeLa cells with IFN-b, preparing total cell lysate 24-48 hr posttreatment, and immunoblotting with anti-ISG15 antibody ( Figure 1A) . Surprisingly, when such lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies against previously identified target proteins, it was difficult to observe their modification. This is seen in Figure 1B for two such proteins, IQGAP1 and Ube1. Whereas modification of both proteins could be detected on very long exposures, modification of Hsc70 ( Figure 1B ) and four other constitutively expressed target proteins could not be detected (Table S1 available online). The success rate for validation of IFN-induced target proteins was higher, with three out of five targets confirmed, as shown for p56 ( Figure 1C ) and summarized in Table S1 . As negative controls, five proteins not previously identified as targets of ISG15 modification were examined, and none of these were detectably modified in IFN-b-stimulated cells (Table S1) . ISG15 conjugates can also be generated by expressing the core components of the conjugation system (ISG15 or FLAG-ISG15, Ube1L, UbcH8, and Herc5) by a four-plasmid transfection of non-IFN-stimulated cells. As seen in Figure 2A (top), robust ISG15 conjugation was observed in HEK293T cells subjected to this four-plasmid transfection. However, it was again difficult to detect ISGylation of individual endogenously expressed target proteins, as shown for IQGAP1, Moesin, and Ube1 ( Figure 2A) , although, as in IFN-stimulated HeLa cells, a low level of modification of IQGAP1 and Ube1 could be detected on very long exposures (data not shown). Modification of only two of seven previously identified targets could be validated by this method (Table S1) . To further investigate the problem of target protein validation, non-IFN-stimulated cells (HEK293T) were transfected with plasmids expressing individual epitope-tagged target proteins, along with plasmids encoding the four core ISG15 conjugation components (a five-plasmid transfection). Surprisingly, in this scenario, ISG15 modification was detected for all previously identified target proteins tested (nine out of nine proteins), as shown in Figures 2B and S1 and summarized in Table S2 . These results prompted us to assay, as presumptive negative controls, several epitope-tagged human proteins that had not been previously identified as ISG15 targets. Five out of seven of these were also found to be ISGylated, including E6AP, p53, Dlg, Herc4, and Herc6 (Figures 3A and S2 and Table S2 ). Several nonhuman proteins were also assayed, including E. coli b-galactosidase, Shigella flexneri OspG, Salmonella typhimurium SopA, the TAP epitope tag (two copies of the protein A sequence and the calmodulin-binding protein), and two viral proteins (HPV18 L1 and HIV integrase). All of these were modified when expressed along with the conjugation components (Figures 3B  and S2 and Table S2 ). Three proteins were identified that were consistently not ISGylated in this assay system: GFP, human Wbp2, and a 35 kD carboxy-terminal fragment of paxillin. We also confirmed that the nature of the epitope tag did not influence modification (see Figures 2 and S2 for modification of TAP-, HA-, and V5-Ube1 and Table S2 for others). In an attempt to map a domain on a target protein that was recognized by the ISGylation enzymes, three nonoverlapping fragments of IQGAP1 were assayed for modification ( Figure 3C) . Surprisingly, all three fragments of the protein were ISGylated. Similar results were seen with two nonoverlapping fragments of MxA ( Figure S3 ), indicating that the ISGylation machinery does not recognize a single epitope even within an individual protein. Together, these results suggested that, at least in the fiveplasmid transfection assay, the ISGylation machinery recognizes target proteins in a broad and relatively nonspecific manner. To address whether the broad target recognition in the fiveplasmid transfection assay was related to overexpression of the transfected target proteins, we monitored, at several time points after transfection, the protein levels and modification of two exogenously expressed target proteins (TAP-Ube1 and TAP-IQGAP1) relative to the corresponding endogenously expressed proteins. Figure 4A (left panels) shows the relative levels of exogenously and endogenously expressed proteins in the absence of ISG15 (expression of target protein with Ube1L, UbcH8, and Herc5, without ISG15), using an antibody that detects both proteins. The exogenously expressed proteins could be detected by 6 hr posttransfection for both TAP-Ube1 and TAP-IQGAP1. For Ube1, the levels of the exogenous protein did not exceed that of endogenous Ube1, even at 30 hr post-transfection, whereas, for IQGAP1, the levels of exogenous protein were similar and perhaps slightly higher than endogenous IQGAP1 at 24 and 30 hr posttransfection (correcting for the 50% transfection efficiency). However, at the 18 hr time point, when the exogenously expressed proteins were clearly less abundant than the endogenously expressed proteins, ISGylation of the exogenously expressed proteins was detected when the target protein was expressed with all four conjugation components ( Figure 4A , middle). In contrast, modification of the endogenous proteins was not detectable at any time point ( Figure 4A , right). Therefore, the preferential modification of exogenously expressed proteins was not due to a higher steady-state level of the exogenously expressed target proteins.
