In this study, a total of 12 flexible endoscopes were collected using continuous sampling approach, with colony counts ranging from 0 to 21 CFU/piece. e detection rate of bacteria in the disc brush group (33.3%), and the entire channel group (33.3%) was higher than that of the biopsy channel group (8.3%). Among the 12 endoscopes sampled with intermittent approach, with colony counts ranging from 0 to 36 CFU/piece, the detection rate of bacteria from high to low was the disc brush group (50%), the entire channel group (41.7%), and the biopsy channel group (8.3%). It showed that the detection rate of bacteria for either the disc brush group or the entire channel group was higher than the biopsy channel group (Tables 1-4 ).
