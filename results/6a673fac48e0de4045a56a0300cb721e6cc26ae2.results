Twenty-three in-depth interviews were conducted. Twenty HCWs were employed by five separate university hospitals (13 nurses, six physicians, and one person in charge of logistics). Three interviewees worked as ambulance nurses in three different regional ambulance services. Two of these interviewees had additional tasks: one was a team leader, and the other was a regional manager of acute medical incidents. All except five HCWs had children and each of them had a partner when they were involved in caring for a patient with suspected Ebola. They had four to 38 years of experience in their current profession. The experiences of HCWs dealing with a patient with suspected Ebola were categorized into three themes, which were experiences related to: (i) the novelty of the threat, (ii) the risk of infection and the fear of transmission, and (iii) the excessive attention ( Figure 1 ). Experiences related to the 'working environment' were relevant for all three themes. The responses of the various types of healthcare professionals were similar with very few differences.
