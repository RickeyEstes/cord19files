Utilizing microscopy and PCR approaches, Acanthamoeba spp. were detected in 20 out of the 87 dust samples collected (23%). All primary cultures containing Acanthamoeba spp. were subjected to cloning and axenisation. After the series of procedures, only 31 out of 59 cloned cell lines were successfully axenised and established into stable cultures. The clonality and identity of the established axenic cell lines were checked by direct sequencing of the ASA.S1 amplicons. Analyses on the DNA sequences revealed that 10 of the cloned isolates were mixtures as overlapping DNA sequences were obtained for them. The remaining pure clones were subjected to further characterization. They were designated as IMU1 to IMU21. Eleven different ASA.S1 sequences were amplified from the 21 axenic Acanthamoeba cell lines as indicated by multiple sequence alignment analyses. Strains that had identical gene sequences were clustered into the same group. Altogether, there were five such groups: (IMU1, IMU2, IMU6 and IMU7); (IMU4 and IMU5); (IMU10, IMU11, IMU12 and IMU13); (IMU16, IMU17); and (IMU19, IMU20 and IMU21). Nucleotide similarities search analyses indicated that most of the present ASA.S1 sequences displayed closest sequence identities (99-100%) to the 18S rRNA gene segments belonging to various Acanthamoeba spp. deposited in the GenBank database. The only exception was the ASA.S1 sequences of IMU16 and IMU17 which only gave best scores of 97% identities to the 18S rRNA gene segments of five strains of A. lenticulata (Table 1 ). In should be noted that DNA information contained within ASA.S1 amplicons is meant for genotyping and not for species identification. This is because many of the present sequences showed remarkable high sequence similarities (97-99%) with sequences belonging to different Acanthamoeba species at the same time (Table 1) . Genotypic classifications of IMU1 to IMU21 were done by assembling and comparing the ASA.S1 sequences of these isolate with reference sequences encompassing all the currently established genotypes of Acanthamoeba, including selected sequences which most closely resembled the ASA.S1 sequences obtained in the study. According to the tree constructed, IMU14 was placed into T3 genotype, IMU16 and IMU17 were identified as T5 isolates and the remaining 18 isolates were assigned to T4 genotype (Fig. 1) . Since polymorphism of cyst shapes, sizes and number of arms could be observed within a cloned Acanthamoeba isolate, all isolates were characterized based on the average cyst morphology within the respective isolate. It was observed that all investigated isolates have cyst sizes ≤18 m, and are therefore identified as either Group II or Group III Acanthamoeba. Isolates recognized as having Group II morphology were IMU1 to IMU9, IMU14, IMU15, and IMU18 to IMU21. Some of these isolates could be identified further to specific species based on the Pussard and Pons' key (1977) . They were A. castellanii (IMU1 to IMU3, IMU6, IMU7, IMU9 and IMU18); A. culbertsoni (IMU10 to IMU13); A. griffini (IMU14); A. lenticulata (IMU16 and IMU17), and A. polyphaga (IMU8 and IMU19) (Fig. 2, Table 2 ). Species identity for the remaining five isolates, however, could not be determined morphologically. Cysts of IMU4 and IMU5 resembled each other. Both isolates have polygonal cysts. The cysts arms were truncated, ranging from six to seven in number. Ectocysts were wrinkled and closely attached to endocysts. These characteristics were common to both A. castellanii and A. polyphaga (Fig. 3) . IMU15 revealed the cyst morphology of either A. hatchetti or A. polyphaga. This isolate has squarish or pentagonal endocysts. Ectocysts were wrinkled and were in close contact with the underlying endocysts, conforming to the shape of the later (Fig. 3) . Cysts of IMU20 and IMU21 resembled each others. Cysts of these isolates often have pentagonal and occasionally stellate endocysts, and the ectocysts were loosely applied to endocyst, and these cysts features resembled to cysts of A. polyphaga. However, their ectocyst was rather smooth in contrast to ectocyst of A. polyphaga which was wrinkled. Therefore these three isolates could only be identified under the genus of Acanthamoeba (Fig. 3) . The remaining six isolates were placed into Group III. Among these isolates, IMU10 to IMU13 were designated as A. culbertsoni whereas IMU16 and IMU17 were identified as A. lenticulata (Fig. 2) . Cysts morphological parameters for IMU1 to IMU21 are presented in Table 2 . In general, cyst diameters of all Acanthamoeba isolates cultured in xenic condition were in agreement with the morphological grouping by Pussard and Pons, and cysts that grew in this condition were less variable in cysts diameters (ranged from 8.34% up to 15.72% of relative standard deviation). However, in axenic liquid medium, cysts of almost all isolates were much larger and variable in diameter (ranging from 9.55% up to 48.95% of relative standard deviation). Student's t-test showed that all Acanthamoeba isolates grown under axenic culture condition, except IMU4 and IMU14, have significantly larger mean diameters of cysts as compared to those grown under xenic culture condition. Outliers, defined by cyst diameter >18 m, were observed for Acanthamoeba cysts grown under axenic culture condition, whereas none were observed under xenic culture condition. Indeed, some cysts grown in the former condition even achieved extreme diameters of more than 40-50 m. Growth rates of Acanthamoeba isolates at different temperatures were graded qualitatively by visual observation rather than through enumeration of organisms using a hematocytometer. Quantification was not practical because trophozoites of some cell lines adhered rather strongly to substrates of agar plates, and these made cell enumeration based on sample aliquots inaccurate. At 37 • C incubation, all isolates were able to grow at this temperature, T11   T15   T13   T2  T6   T14   T10   T8   T12   T1   T7 T9 Fig. 1 .

Numbers at the nodes are percentage-bootstrapping values on 1000 replicates; only value of >50% are shown. GenBank accession numbers for reference sequences are indicated at the ends of sequence designations. however IMU1, IMU2, IMU3, IMU7, IMU15, IMU16 and IMU21 grew slower compared to other isolates. At 42 • C incubation, none except IMU17 could produce growth. To investigate the effects of higher temperatures on their viability, cysts of each isolate were exposed to 46 • C and 52 • C overnight prior to incubations at lower temperature (26 ± 2 • C) which favored excystation. The test revealed that cysts of all isolates could tolerate temperature up to 52 • C. In osmotolerance test, IMU4, IMU5, IMU10, IMU13, IMU14 and IMU21 showed good osmotolerance to 1 M D-mannitol, as evident by indistinguishable growth profiles and cell features in cultures that grew in the presence or absence of the saccharide. On the other hand, IMU3, IMU18, IMU9 and IMU20 showed partial tolerance towards osmotic stress with 1 M D-mannitol; these isolates excysted infrequently and trophozoites that emerged were relatively small and nearly rounded in shape. There remaining 10 isolates were very sensitive towards 1 M D-mannitol. In the presence of the saccharide, no excystation was observed for these isolates.
