Assessing the effect of E. faecium on the viability of 3D4/ 21 and MDBK cells Cytotoxicity of E. faecium on both 3D4/21 and MDBK cells is shown in Fig. 1 . Compared to control cells (100% cell survival rate), the application of E. faecium on the examined cell lines did not lead to any detrimental effects on cell integrity or metabolism unless the concentration exceeded the concentration of 1610 7 CFU/ml. As seen from the results compiled in Fig. 1 , E. faecium at a concentration of 1610 8 CFU/ml had a severe cytotoxic effect especially for the macrophage cell line 3D4/21. Under the same conditions a proportion of about 60% of the MDBK-cells still survived in the presence of this probiotic. Based on these results, 1610 6 CFU/ml of E. faecium was applied for the interference studies described below.
