3.1. Phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparison based on the complete S1 gene Phylogenetic analysis was performed by using the complete nucleotide sequences of the S1 gene of our four IBV strains and 71 reference IBVs strains, which were representative of 35 well-established lineages and 7 genotypes. The results demonstrated that our four IBV strains were phylogenetically clustered among IBV strains with the GI-13 genotype (Valastro et al., 2016) , including the 4/91 vaccine strain and Moroccan/G/83 (El-Houadfi et al., 1986) . Our results also showed that our four strains formed two phylogenetic subclusters, in which strains I0737/17, 4/91, and Moroccan/G/83 occurred in the same subcluster, and strains I0718/17, I0722/17, and I0724/17 were grouped together (Fig. 1) . The results of alignment of the complete S1 gene sequences of our four viruses with those of the 4/91 strain (the currently used vaccine strain) and the LGX/100508 and YX10 strains (GI-19-lineage viruses) revealed the presence of multiple mutations (Fig. 2) . The majority of variations between I0737/17 and 4/91 were observed at the far N terminus of the S1 subunit of the S protein, in which three substitutions were located in HVRI. The nucleotide sequence of this region in strain I0737/17 was same as those in strains LGX/100508 and YX10. In contrast, the nucleotide sequences of the remaining regions in I0737/17 were nearly the same as those in strain 4/91 and different from those in strains LGX/100508 and YX10. These remaining regions included several important domains, such as the deduced minimal RBD, most parts of HVRI, all parts of HVRs II and III, and the five epitopes mapped to the S1 subunit of the S protein (Kusters et al., 1989; Koch et al., 1990) . Strains I0718/17, I0722/17, and I0724/17 possessed similar nucleotide sequences and showed differences with the amino acid sequence of 4/ 91 at the N terminus of the S1 subunit, which included HVRs I and II, epitopes D and E, half of the RBD, and four critical amino acids in the RBD. The nucleotide sequences of the remaining regions in the three viruses were the same as those in 4/91 and different from those in strains LGX/100508 and YX10. In addition, strains LGX/100508 and YX10 differed only by two amino acid substitutions (F193Y and I252T).
