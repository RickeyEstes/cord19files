Firstly, baseline simulations (N) were analyzed. Five individuals were selected randomly to be the index cases (the initial patients with influenza) and R 0 was calibrated to be 1.79 [48] . Figure 1 shows the number of new cases from different ABs over time (in weeks). The three basic properties can be found in Table 1 : on average, it took 31 days for the number of new infection cases to reach the peak, that is, 308 cases per day. The total number of cases during the outbreak was 5703. Table 2 shows the distribution of infection across different classes of AB. The four main infection sources were household (36%), social place (22.2%), workplace (10.9%) and school (11.9%). The peak day (i.e., day of the outbreak peak) of new infections was the fourth week for most types of AB (Figure 1) , although, notably, was the third week for schools. Most infections at schools occurred from pupil to pupil. This implied that the epidemic outbreak was strengthened amongst children and then spread to adults. The control measure specific to schools may, therefore, be important, especially during the early stages of an outbreak. For different control measures, the three properties of the outbreak under each scenario are given in Table 1 . The proportion of infected individuals was plotted against time in Figure 2 for scenarios N, S, H and SH (for each scenario, the result of a "typical" simulation run is shown in which the three properties of the outbreak were similar to the average values for the 300 simulation runs). The implications from Table 1 and Figure 2 are: (1) Amongst each single control measure, A was relatively ineffective. The values of all three properties for A were similar to those under the baseline scenario N, with almost no variation with compliance level. (2) H was a very effective control measure, especially in limiting the peak number of cases and total number of cases, with large differences between compliance levels. The decrease in the peak number of cases for H was from more than 300 to around 158 for a 100% compliance level, a decrease of about 48.7%. The delay in the peak day was about 3 to 17 days. Moreover, the total number of cases decreased to a range of 3635 -5403, that is, 63.7% -94.7% of the baseline value. (3) The effectiveness of S was less than that of H: the peak number of cases decreased to about 71.1% and the peak day was delayed by about 8 days. The effectiveness of S in reducing the total number of cases was small, a reduction of about 4.2%. (4) For multiple control measures, since A had almost no effect, it is not surprising to see that AH was similar to H, AS was similar to S and AHS was similar to HS. HS (and AHS) were the most effective control strategies: the peak number of cases decreased by 56% to 57%, the total number of cases decreased by 21% to 22% and the peak day was delayed by 17 to 20 days. Table 2 lists the distribution of infections between different types of AB amongst S, H and HS (A is excluded due to its ineffectiveness). Compared with N, S reduced the infection in schools to a very low level, but infection within other ABs also increased in absolute number, compensating for the gain. Compared with N, H reduced the total infection, and the effectiveness varied amongst different types of AB. Thus, the transmission environments (ABs) most resistant to control were home and school, with decreases of 33% and 41%, respectively, while for all other ABs the total number of cases decreased by 63 -69%. HS was the most effective control measure for all types of AB, with the lowest infection rates for any AB type. Table 3 shows the three properties of the outbreak controlled by HS (with a 50% compliance level for household quarantine), with alert values increasing from 20 to 1000. Clearly, the higher the alert value, the larger the total number of cases and peak number of cases, and the earlier the peak day. With a lower alert value, that is, intervening earlier, control measures were more effective. Table 4 shows the three properties of the outbreak controlled by HS (with a 50% compliance level for household quarantine) for four values of R 0 (1.24, 1.79, 2.42, and 2.60). By comparing the set of outcomes under control measure HS with the corresponding N scenario (for the same R 0 ) ( Table 4) , it can be seen that the control measure HS was more effective for smaller R 0 values. Because the smaller the R 0 , the lower the probability of an outbreak, the greater the relative decrease in total number of cases and peak number of cases, and the greater the relative delay in the peak day.
