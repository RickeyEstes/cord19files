Bat species studied, year of capture, type of sample and the corresponding GenBank accession numbers for the Iberian bat AdV sequences are listed in Table 1 . (Table 1 ). In 29 bats both partial genes were studied. In 41 bats only the hexon sequence were obtained. Finally, in 6 bats only the DNApol was studied. The Andalusia region in the south of Spain, had the greater distribution of AdV in bats including several genera of the families Vespertilionidae, (Pipistrellus, Myotis and Nyctalus) and the Rhinolophidae (Rhinolophus). The majority of positive bats belonging to the Pipistrellus genus were sampled in Andalusia. All 59 bat AdVs found in the Rhinolophus genus also came from Andalusian bats while no positives were detected in 78 bats sampled in the Basque Country (North). The three Nyctalus species (N. noctula, N. lasiopterus and N. leisleri, 23 bats) and two of the three Pipistrellus (P. kuhlii and P. pygmaeus, 28 bats) contributed the most to the list of positives detected in OPS and SS. Two out of four species of the Rhinolophus genus (R. euryale and R. ferrumequinum, 14 bats) had detectable levels of AdV DNA present in the OPS samples only.
