3xTg and 3xTgQ-/-show similar pathology at all the ages tested, with trends for accelerated pathology in the 3xTg on the BUB background The kinetics of progression of plaque deposition, activated glia and tangle pathology in the 3xTg as compared to the 3xTg backcrossed to a C1q knock out, 3xTgQ-/-, was assessed on animals from 7 months (m) to 18 m of age to permit comparison at multiple stages of plaque formation. In our colony of 3xTg mice, there is no plaque deposition seen in 7 m animals, while by 18 m there are a significant number of plaques in the subiculum area of the hippocampus. The deposition of fibrillar plaques as detected by thioflavine staining (which only labels fibrillar amyloid) was assessed by image analysis in the subiculum area of the hippocampus (the area where pathology starts in the 3xTg model) at 7,12,14,16 and 18 m in the 3xTg vs. 3xTgQ-/-group. As shown in Figure 1A , and 1B, there is no significant difference between the 3xTg and 3xTgQ-/in the amount of fibrillar plaques seen at any age. Similarly, total amyloid immunostaining using 6E10 antibody, did not show any differences between the 3xTg and 3xTgQ-/-groups (data not shown). When the same studies were performed using 3xTg and 3xTgQ-/-on BUB background, again no differences in the amount of plaques were seen at any of the ages studied (7,10,12.5 and 18 m) in the presence or absence of C1q ( Figure 1C ). However, the 3xTg on BUB background did have higher thioflavine staining than the 3xTg (mixed background) at 12.5 and 18 m with a 3 fold greater amount at 12.5 m that was statistically significant (p < 0.05). In contrast to previous comparison of Tg2576 and Tg2576Q-/-mice [16] , deletion of C1q did not affect the level of CD45 immunoreactivity (activated microglia) seen around the plaques in the 3xTg model (Figure 2A and 2B) or in the 3xTg model on BUB background ( Figure 2C ). However, as seen with the thioflavine results, a trend for an increase in the CD45 staining is observed in the 3xTgBUB at 12.5 m when compared with 3xTg, a difference that is statistically significant (p < 0.02). The variability in all pathological markers among the individual animals in all the groups (at all ages) was considerable (as can be seen by the SE) even among littermates, suggesting that it might be due to genetic factors. This variability was particularly evident in the microglia reactivity with some groups of animals displaying little or no clear increase of microglial reactivity (CD45, MAC-1 and Iba1 staining) in parallel with the increases seen in thioflavine plaques. However, astrocytes (labeled with GFAP) surrounding plaques were found in levels corresponding relatively to the thioflavine load (data not shown). The reason for this variable microglial reactivity observed in the 3xTg is currently unknown. The 3xTg model not only develops plaque pathology but also accumulates neurofibrillary tangles that contain hyperphosphorylated tau. Immunostaining and image analysis of AT8 and AT100 (antibodies for phosphotau) showed no difference in the amount of phosphorylated Tau between 3xTg and 3xTgQ-/-( Figure 3A and 3B) or between 3xTgBUB and 3xTgQ-/-BUB ( Figure 3C ) at any age tested indicating that the lack of C1q did not alter the amount of tau phosphorylation and the progression of neurofibrillary tangles. However, importantly, there is a trend of an increase of AT100 reactivity in the 3xTg and the 3xTgQ-/-on the BUB background relative to the 3xTg which reached statistical significance at 18 m between the 3xTg vs 3xTgQ-/-BUB groups (p < 0.05). Evidence of classical pathway activation is not seen associated with plaques in brain of 3xTg or 3xTgBUB There is evidence that supports the hypothesis that complement activation by ÃŸ-amyloid fibrils occur in AD (Tenner and Fonseca, 2006) , and that this activation might be, in part, responsible for the recruitment of activated glia and the generation of an inflammatory environment in the area of the plaque that can enhance neuropathology. In several transgenic models of AD complement factors have been shown associated with the plaques [31] [32] [33] . In the Arc48 model [26] which develops plaque pathology at an early age, C1q is associated with plaques as the first thioflavine plaques develop (around 2 m) and increases with age (data not shown), strongly colocalizing with thioflavine (Figure 4,  left) . In the Tg2576 model, C1q is also associated with thioflavine plaques (Figure 4, middle) . Surprisingly, neither the 3xTg (Figure 4 , right) nor the 3xTg on the BUB background (data not shown) showed detectable levels of C1q colocalizing with plaques. C4 immunostaining with an antibody that recognizes C4 and its cleavage fragments C4b and C4d showed that C4 is present in the Arc48 model ( Figure 5 , top) and colocalizes with thioflavine ( Figure 5, top inset) . As previously reported [33] , C4 is deposited on plaques in the Tg2576 mice and also expressed in oligodendrocytes ( Figure 5 , middle) as early as 12 m, while undetectable in the Tg2576Q-/-mice of the same age. In contrast, no C4 was detected on the plaques of the 3xTg model even at advanced ages ( Figure 5 , bottom) or in the BUB (high complement hemolytic activity) strain (data not shown). Expression of C3 and cleaved C3 fragments in the 3xTg brain compared to other APP transgenic models C3 immunoreactivity was tested using two monoclonal antibodies, the anti mouse C3 antibody (Clone 11H9) that recognizes both intact C3 and the cleaved fragments C3b, iC3b and C3d while anti mouse C3b/iC3b/ C3c (clone 2/11) is specific only for the cleaved [34] fragments and two polyclonal anti human C3 antibodies that react with either the C3c (C3/C3c antibody) or the C3d (C3/C3d antibody) in the native or cleaved molecule. Results of immunohistochemical analysis are summarized in Table 1 . Reactivity was detected in subpopulations of astrocytes associated with plaques, shown by the polyclonal anti human C3/C3c in 3xTg ( Figure 6A ), Tg2576 and Arc48 (data not shown), and the monoclonal anti mouse C3 (clone 11H9) in the Tg2576 ( Figure 6C ) and 3xTg (data not shown), consistent with the known synthesis of C3 by astrocytes in an injured or inflammatory environment. In the Arc48 mice at younger ages the 11H9 antibody stained only astrocytes, but at later ages (13 m) plaques were also labeled (data not shown). While staining astrocytes less prominently, the anti human C3/C3d polyclonal antibody also showed reactivity associated with the plaques in the Arc48 model at older ages (9 m, Figure 6D ), suggesting the presence of the activation fragment of C3 since C3d contains the thioester that can form covalent binding with an activator (here the fibrillar amyloid). In contrast, while the polyclonal anti human C3/C3d antibodies did label astrocytes surrounding plaques in the Tg2576 (data not shown) and 3xTg ( Figure 6B ) similar to the Arc48, the association of C3d on plaques was not detected in either Tg2576 (data not shown) or in the 3xTg with this antibody ( Figure 6B ). The monoclonal 2/11 which reacts with activated/cleaved C3 only (C3b/ iC3b/C3c), stained plaques in Arc48 (13 m) (data not shown) and Tg2576 [33] although no reactivity was detected in 3xTg, further demonstrating differential plaque associated complement components. The 3xTgBUB strain reacted similarly to the 3xTg with all anti C3 antibodies (data not shown).
