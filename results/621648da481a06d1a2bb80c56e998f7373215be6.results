Cryo-EM revealed that the HBV/G core protein was able to form T = 3 and T = 4 capsid structures similar to those formed by genotype A (Fig. 1) . Thus, we confirmed that the additional 12 N-terminal residues do not impair capsid formation. Furthermore, the insertion does not affect the basic structure of the core, other than presenting two additional regions of mass at the base of each of the spikes. Several groups have previously engineered N-terminal extensions to the HBcAg and found that this did not impair self-assembly of the expressed proteins into core-like particles [20, 21] . The majority of the HBV/G cores had T = 4 morphology, as previously reported in expressed core-like particles, and in cores isolated from patient specimens [22] . Superficially, the three-dimensional structure of the T = 4 capsid formed by HBV/G core protein looks very similar to the crystal structure of the HBV/A capsid, PDB accession Fig. 2 Surface shaded representation of the HBV/A capsid structure solved by X-ray crystallography (yellow), and HBV/G capsid structure solved by cryoEM (green) are shown in (a) and (b), respectively. Structures are Fourier filtered to 14 Ã… resolution for comparison. A difference map (c, shown in blue) was created by subtracting the HBV/A capsid structure from the HBV/G core structure is presented with a mass threshold set to account for the 12 extra residues from the HBV/G cryo-EM map. Panel (d) shows the difference map (blue) superimposed over the HBV/A core crystal structure (yellow). In all four panels, a red oval has been superposed over the reconstruction to highlight a single dimer spike in the structures at the base of the spike.
