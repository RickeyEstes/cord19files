Using observed (ANUSPLIN) temperature data, R 0 for I. scapularis in the late 1970swhen Lyme disease emerged in the northeastern United States (Wood and Lafferty 2013)-was estimated at approximately 3 and 1.9 in Old Lyme and Fort McCoy, respectively; at between 2 and 3 in Southern Ontario; approximately 1.5 in Huron Ontario and South-Western Quebec, but mostly < 1 in Upper Southern Ontario and the Boreal region ( Figure 1 ). In Old Lyme, R 0 increased almost linearly to approximately 3.5 by 1999 during the first period of expansion of I. scapularis in the northeastern United States. In Fort McCoy, R 0 increased slightly, but this increase was small compared with interannual variations. In Southern Ontario, R 0 increased to 4 by the early 2000s; during which time I. scapularis populations emerged at a number of locations in this region (Point Pelee National Park, Turkey Point, Rondeau Provincial Park; Figure 1A ). In Huron Ontario and South-Western Quebec, R 0 increased from 1.5 to 2.5 by the early 2000s; and subsequent to this (mostly from 2000 onward), I. scapularis populations began to emerge in South-Western Quebec ( Figure 1D ). In Upper Southern Ontario, R 0 increased to > 1 in the late 1990s, but in the Boreal region R 0 remained below unity for the whole 1971-2010 period (Figure 1) . R 0 values for I. scapularis obtained in model simulations using projected climate data were similar for an ensemble of climate models, and we used bias-corrected output from the regional climate model CRCM4.2.3 as a representative of the ensemble because of its spatial resolution and predictive accuracy. R 0 for I. scapularis in Canada was projected to increase 1. (Table 1) . Increases in R 0 to values > 1 predicted in regions where R 0 was < 1 during the period 1970-2000 would be expected to facilitate range expansion of I. scapularis northward and possibly westward (Figure 2) . The projected increases in R 0 are equivalent, for the most part, to ranges of values of R 0 estimated for other globally important parasites and pathogens associated with variations in major determinants of their ecology and epidemiology such as geographic location, pathogen genotype, different epidemics, reservoir host or vector density, and control efforts (Table 1 ).
