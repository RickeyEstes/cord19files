A multitude of the mathematical models put forward to study the dynamics of vector-borne diseases are based on compartmental models described by systems of ordinary differential equations (ODE). Crucial to these types of models is the assumption of constant death rates. As vectors are assumed to remain infectious for life, such assumptions influence not only the resulting dynamics but also the estimates of the disease's basic reproduction number R 0 (and relatedly the (time-varying) effective reproduction number R e (t)). Here we aimed to quantify the effects of relaxing the assumption of constant vector death rate on R 0 estimates within the same theoretical setting. This was done by comparing the R 0 values derived from an SEIR-SEI system of ODEs with a formula derived from first principles using the transmission cycle of a generic vector-borne disease using different assumptions about vector mortality rates (see Methods). We then verified these estimates by means of a stochastic individual-based model, which allowed us to directly measure R 0 from running repeat simulations of introducing an infected individuals into a fully susceptible population. The same model was also used to derive R 0 estimates from simulated timeseries data.
