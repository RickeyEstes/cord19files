Between 1st January and 31st December 2010, 166 veterinary clinics across Australia recorded CPV cases in the Disease WatchDog database. In total there were 1198 individual CPV events reported during this period. Forty nine reports (4.1%) were removed prior to analysis: eight reports as non-identical copies, 16 incomplete reports, 24 reports with date discrepancies, and one report that cited a 'negative parvo test' as the case diagnosis. The remaining 1149 reports included 126 litter diagnoses reported as single events. When each dog within a litter was counted as a single event, this resulted in a total of 1451 individual CPV cases. Of the 1149 reports, 873 (76%) were diagnosed via CPV faecal antigen test, 220 (19%) via clinical presentation, and 56 (4.9%) via other methods (PCR, immunofluorescence, unspecified CPV test). The majority of reports involved dogs less than one year of age: 691 reports (60.1%) were dogs less than six months of age, 289 (25.2%) were six to less than 12 months of age, 85 (7.4%) were 12 to less than 18 months of age, 22 (1.9%) were 18 to less than 24 months of age, and 67 (5.8%) were 24 months and older. The mean and median age of reported cases were 236 and 133 days (approximately 7.5 and 4.5 months), respectively. There were 38 cases (3.3%) with a history of vaccination in the previous 12 months (having completed primary puppy course), compared with 195 cases (17.0%) with an incomplete primary vaccination course, 916 dogs (58.3%) that were unvaccinated and 246 (21.4%) that had an unknown vaccination status. The majority (89.5%) of dogs reported as CPV cases that had a history of vaccination within the previous 12 months were under 12 months of age. Mixed breed dogs comprised 527 (45.9%) reports and pedigree dogs comprised 622 (54.1%) reports. Of the 622 reports in pedigree dogs there were 33 (5.3%) gundogs, 32 (5.1%) hounds, 56 (9.0%) non-sporting dogs, 214 (34.4%) terriers, 53 (8.5%) toy dogs, 55 (8.8%) utility dogs and 179 (28.8%) working dogs. There were 249 (21.7%) reports made in summer, 365 (31.8%) in autumn, 217 (18.9%) in winter and 318 (27.7%) in spring. Of the 1023 non-litter cases, 449 (43.9%) were female, 566 (55.3%) were male, and 8 (0.7%) were of unknown sex; 960 (93.8%) were entire and 63 (6.2%) were neutered.
