The spleen in adult shrews exhibits lesser activity in the white pulp but higher cellularity in the red pulp compared to the spleen in sub-adults Red and white pulp of shrews of all age groups were examined for their composition and cellular turnover. The white pulp (lymphatic follicles and T cell zones) was generally confined to the organ's centre, where follicles were arranged singly or in groups ( Fig. 1 ). Germinal centres exhibited numerous proliferating, PCNA-positive cells (up to 50%) and few (#5%) apoptotic cells. T cell zones were arranged around medium-sized arteries, forming periarterial lymphatic sheaths similar in size and cell density in all animals, exhibiting up to 10% proliferating, PCNA-positive cells and generally few apoptotic cells. The generally cell-rich red pulp contained neutrophils, erythrocytes and smaller numbers of lymphocytes (each ,5% up to 30% T cells and mature B cells) and macrophages as well as numerous evenly distributed megakaryocytes (Fig. 1B) ; the red pulp exhibited some degree of cellular turnover, with approximately 10% proliferating, PCNApositive cells and scattered apoptotic cells. Follicles and follicle groups were often delineated by a variably distinct rim of macrophages and neutrophils (Fig. 1C) , together with variable numbers of mature, strongly CD79a-positive B cells, T cells and erythrocytes. In general, 30-50% of cells in the red pulp were positive for myeloid/histiocyte antigen (Fig. 1D ) and lysozyme and had the morphology of monocytes/macrophages or neutrophils. Age groups differed in both the composition and functional state of the spleen. Within the red pulp, the amount of neutrophils and Table 1 .

[36, 53] . f [37] . g [53] . h [38] [39] [40] . megakaryocytes often appeared greater in adult animals than in sub-adults. The white pulp of sub-adults was exclusively comprised of secondary follicles, which often appeared interconnected and formed large groups (Fig. 1A) . These follicles were for the most part large and without signs of depletion and included numerous apoptotic cells and tingible body macrophages, as well as several mitotic cells. In contrast, the majority of adults exhibited fewer follicles which were a mixture of primary and secondary follicles (Figs. 1B, 2) and generally smaller than those of sub-adults (n = 17, Wald = 17.17, p,0.05, Figs. 1A, 2). Follicles in adults also differed from those in sub-adults, in that they were only partially surrounded by distinct perifollicular rims. Where present, germinal centres in adults contained both mitotic as well as apoptotic cells. Follicle centres in four adults exhibited collagen deposition, and while there was a tendency for greater follicle depletion in older animals (Fig. 2) , the difference between adults and sub-adults was not statistically significant (Wald = 2.10, not significant (ns)). The white pulp of the three pubescent animals exhibited primary and/ or secondary follicles, the latter with features similar to those found in sub-adult shrews. Males (n = 18) and females (n = 21) did not differ with respect to either size (Wald = 0.67, ns) or depletion (Wald = 0.13, ns) of follicles in the spleen. Lymph node composition is similar in all age groups, with a relatively high proportion of plasma cells, particularly in adults Mesenteric or mediastinal lymph nodes were examined from selected sub-adult and adult animals. All features normally associated with mammalian lymph nodes were represented: a cortex containing primary and secondary follicles, paracortex, lymphatic cords, medulla and both marginal and medullary sinuses. Compared to lymph nodes in other mammalian species [39, 42] , the medulla often appeared to contain a high number of plasma cells, particularly in adults. No other differences were observed between the age groups. The pancreas of Aselli represents a specialised abdominal lymph node that appears to function as a plasma cell store, in particular in adult shrews In the past, there has been some controversy as to the composition and function of the pancreas of Aselli (lymph nodelike or equivalent to the avian bursa of Fabricius [35] ). The aim of this study was therefore to clarify this matter with up-to-date methodology. In general, the composition of the pancreas of Aselli was very similar to that of a lymph node. Beneath the capsule were marginal sinuses of variable width, containing disseminated lymphocytes (mostly T and B cells in equal proportions), macrophages and neutrophils, the latter either disseminated or as small accumulations. In four adult shrews, the marginal sinuses exhibited focal to extensive fibrosis. Beneath the sinuses lay a cortex containing exclusively secondary follicles ( Fig. 3A-C) , with the exception of one adult male where both primary and secondary follicles were present (Fig. 4) . Germinal centres generally exhibited a high cellular turnover, with variable but high numbers of PCNA-positive, proliferating cells (often more than 50% of cells; Fig. 3E ) and often numerous apoptotic cells (Fig. 3F ). T cell zones formed a paracortex located immediately beneath the follicles (Fig. 3D ) and were generally similar in size and cell density in animals of all age groups. The organ's centre (medulla) contained loosely arranged sinuses with only low numbers of macrophages. The remainder of the medulla was made up almost entirely of plasma cells (Fig. 3G, H) . In sub-adult animals the cortex generally appeared tightly packed with large follicles that exhibited no, mild or moderate depletion (Figs. 3A, 4) . In adult shrews, the cortex often contained only a small number of follicles (9/20 animals; 45%), frequently with large areas of cortex devoid of follicles (5/20; 25%; Fig. 3B ). Follicles occasionally seemed to extend outwards into marginal sinuses and in two animals exhibited central collagen deposition. Follicles in adults (n = 21) were both smaller than those in sub-adults (n = 18; Wald = 11.06, p,0.05, Fig. 4 ) and exhibited greater levels of depletion (Wald = 13.28, p,0.05, Fig. 4) . No difference was found between males (n = 17) and females (n = 22) with respect to follicle size (Wald = 0.30, NS) or depletion (Wald = 0.42, NS). Cortical areas devoid of follicles were also devoid of T cell zones. As a consequence, overall numbers of T cells in the pancreas of Aselli often seemed lower in adult than sub-adult animals. Where the cortex was devoid of follicles, plasma cells extended from the medulla to the marginal sinuses or beyond to the capsule, such that the medulla often occupied most of the organ in adult animals (Fig. 3B) . Accordingly, in adult animals, the whole organ frequently appeared as an accumulation of plasma cells, surrounded by a fragmentary cortex and paracortex. Extramedullary haematopoiesis was observed in 9/21 (43%) adult animals, as represented by scattered megakaryocytes within the outer medulla. This was not seen in sub-adult animals.
