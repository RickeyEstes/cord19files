Tryptone mediated induction of the lactose operon Strains DC1 to DC6, from patients with NEC, and strains DC7 to DC12, normal flora controls (see Materials and methods), were assayed for fl-galactosidase specific activity following growth in tryptone broth in the presence and absence of inducer . Results are shown in Table 1 . All strains, except DC4, a K. pneumoniae strain from an See Materials and methods for details . Results shown are the average of three independent determinations . Reproducibility was always within 10% . Ratio of induced to uninduced f/-galactosidase specific activities . NEC patient, had normal fl-galactosidase specific activities when compared to normal flora isolates of the same species . Partially induced synthesis of fl-galactosidase was observed in strain DC4 when grown in tryptone broth, but not when grown in minimal medium (see Table 2 , lines 1 and 2 . It should be noted that strain DC4 was renamed DC4R for reasons explained below) . A similar tryptone mediated induction was observed for lactose permease synthesis ( Table 2) . By adding back individual components of minimal medium to cultures grown in tryptone broth, and vice versa, it was shown that this is an induction effect, caused by tryptone, a pancreatic digest of casein USP (Difco) (see Table 3 ) Using dialysis it was shown that a tryptone component with a molecular weight of less than 3000 has a pronounced dose-dependent stimulatory effect (see Fig . 1 ) . Further characterization of the compound responsible for this effect is in progress . Furthermore, it was shown that fl-galactosidase induction starts approximately 4 min after addition of tryptone, whereas induction by the direct inducer isopropyl-fl- See Materials and methods for details . Casamino acids was added to a final concentration of 1% . All media were prepared from concentrated stocks so that both tryptone and minimal salts were always 1 x strength where present . Results shown are the average of 3 independent determinations. Reproducibility was always within 10% . 3x Tryptone concentration equivalents Segregation of the lactose phenotype Strain DC4 grows as deep red colonies on MacConkey lactose agar, but at a low frequency throws off white segregants . Numerous sectored colonies typical of a segregation event were observed . The parental and segregant strains were renamed DC4R (red) and DC4W (white) respectively . DC4W in turn segregated back to red on MacConkey lactose plates at low frequency . One such isolate was designated DC4R* . This observation suggests that the initial segregation event was not due to the irreversible loss of a plasmid . fl-galactosidase assays on DC4W revealed that lactose operon expression in this strain is no longer partially induced, and is in fact indistinguishable from that observed in a normal flora K . pneumoniae strain . The back segregant, however, was once again partially induced for lactose enzyme synthesis in the presence of tryptone, and behaved 4x 430 Carol A . Carbonaro et al . in all respects like the original DC4R strain . Lactose permease assays showed that expression of the lactose permease gene is similarly affected (see Table 2 ) .
