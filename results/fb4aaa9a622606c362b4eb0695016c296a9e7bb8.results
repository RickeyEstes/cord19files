It has been reported that those at particular risk of development of osteonecrosis have received high dose, long term and long acting preparations of steroid. Similarly, cumulative dosing has also been reported as having a significant risk in pathogenesis. However, multiple studies have also reflected occurrence in those treated with short courses of high dose steroid, and more rarely, with low dose, short duration courses including inhaled and topical preparations. Animal models have helped to establish a cause and effect relationship to steroid dosing.
