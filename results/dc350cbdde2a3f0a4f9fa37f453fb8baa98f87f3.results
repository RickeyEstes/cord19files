Initially the lethality of OSSMe was assessed when given subcutaneously to conventional male F344 rats, kept in a normal animal room. This was necessary because LDso values for rats of this sex and strain and for this route of administration were not available [8] . Four groups of 4 rats each were given 25.0, 39.6, 62.7 or 99.4 mg/kg. The resulting lethality figures were O/4, l/4, l/4, and 3/4, respectively, yielding an estimated LDSO of 74 mg/kg (95% confidence limits: 44 and 103 mg/kg) as calculated by probit analysis. In experiment 1 the clinical evolution and lethality following OSSMe were com-pared between germ-free and conventional rats. In each category 4 rats served as controls, 4 rats received 75 mg/kg and 4 rats received 150 mg/kg. All treated rats showed transient mild to severe signs of cholinergic poisoning as previously described [8] . They lost weight and on the second day after dosing began to show signs of laboured breathing. In the conventional animals, only 3 out of 4 rats from the 150 mg/kg group died (60-72 h, 72-80 h and 84-96 h after dosing). In contrast all treated germ-free rats died (1 around 48 h and 3 between 60 and 72 h after dosing in the 150 mg/kg group; all 4 between 72 and 80 h after dosing in the 75 mg/kg group). The lungs of these dead rats, which were only removed from the isolator b Nasopharynx + lungs.
