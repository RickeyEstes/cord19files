In the very first reports of SARS on 16 March, all the articles referred to the new illness as a 'killer bug' or to a 'mysterious' 'lethal' 'deadly pneumonia virus'. This new 'threat' was described as 'moving at the speed of a jet' and people affected were not responding to traditional treatments. Combined with adjectives like 'untreatable' were some graphic descriptions of how the ''victims' lungs swell and they suffocate''. In the British Medical Journal of the 22 March, there was already speculation as to the origins of the virus which was thought to be an influenza virus or the Hong Kong Avian Flu. In The Lancet of the same day, whilst focusing on the Western Authorities which were investigating the illness, they also said that 'a WHO team is working closely with the Chinese authorities'. Both journals mentioned that chlamydia was also found by the Chinese authorities in the lung tissue of many of the early cases. The Lancet also mentioned that bioterrorism had not been ruled out as a possible cause. Within 7 days of the first reports, speculation began in the newspapers about both the origin of SARS and the outcome of the unfolding epidemic. There was speculation that the 'bug' (usually referred to by the second week as a virus) had 'mutated' from horses or pigs. This was usually combined with explanations of how AIDS had jumped species from monkeys. In particular, there were descriptions of life in ''rural China, where people routinely live in insanitary, cramped conditions in close proximity to poultry and other animals'' (McDonald & Rogers, 2003) . At this early point there were several stories about how this could be 'the next plague'. One byline from The Sunday Telegraph of 23 March sums this theme up: 'The next pandemic is now ready for take-off. The devastating effects of a mystery pathogen have given rise to fears of a modern-day Black Death. Doctors say it is not a question of if such a virus will emerge but when-and, ymillions of air travellers could spread it around the globe'. Other epidemics with death tolls in the millions were frequently cited: such as Spanish flu and AIDS. Also frequently mentioned, even at this early stage, were how Western doctors and authorities were moving quickly and using their expertise to contain the threat or how British scientists were working 'flat out' to process samples sent by worried doctors who acted with 'military precision'. Apart from Hong Kong scientists and authorities, Chinese authorities were only mentioned insofar as Western scientists were 'helping the Chinese communicable disease surveillance network in its attempts to track the infection'. By the second week there were also beginning to be reports of SARS's own 'patient zero'. [In the early days of AIDS, epidemiologists established that at least 40 of the first 248 gay men diagnosed with AIDS in the US had sexual links with a Canadian air steward, Gaetan Dugas, who was controversially dubbed patient zero (Shilts, 1987) . The term is used in the newspapers in the context of SARS without any explanation of its origins.] One particularly lurid piece, told of how 'As he shuffled through the lobby of the Hotel Metropole, the elderly professor was feeling feverish and faint. At the lift, he steadied himself for a moment in the open doorway before his body convulsed in a series of wracking coughs that sprayed fine droplets of saliva onto the walls and the people waiting inside.' (Fraser, 2003) On the 29 March, the British Medical Journal editorial set the tone for much of the newspaper coverage that weekend. 'Sudden acute respiratory syndrome-May be a rehearsal for the next influenza pandemic'
