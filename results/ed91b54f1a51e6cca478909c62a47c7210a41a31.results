A total of 80 questionnaires were returned between the 15 October and 4 November 2013 and an additional questionnaire was completed over the phone by MCPHS staff with a confirmed case. Thus, 81 questionnaires were returned. However, upon anonymising the questionnaires, it was noted that some sharing of the questionnaire had occurred between years of BVT students and 12 of the questionnaires completed were unexpectedly returned by BVT1 students. This makes the number of questionnaires returned from the 156 students that were deliberately distributed the questionnaire at 69 (BVT2, BVT3, and BVSc5), a response rate of 44.2%. Of the 81 questionnaires 74 were released for analysis, 52 were from non-cases. Of the remaining 22, three were unwell but did not fit the case definition as follows: one experienced stomach cramps only and the other two were overseas before and during the incubation period. Thus, nineteen respondents met the clinical case definition, one of whom was a BVT1 student, and seven of these were lab-confirmed cases. The attack rate was 19/81, 23% (95% CI 16%-34%). Symptoms experienced by the 19 cases included diarrhoea, vomiting, and nausea, and the prevalence of the symptoms are enumerated in Table 1 . The epidemic curve ( Figure 1 ) shows a continuous spread of cases from late August to mid-October. The demographic characteristics of the study and source populations stratified by program are reported in Table 2 . One of the affected students was male (5%) and the remainder were female. Of the 74 respondents, 51 (69%) had contact with at least one animal with diarrhoea during the study period. All students reported the species they had been in contact with, and 48 (94%) gave precise dates of when the contact with these animals occurred. The students most frequently reported exposure to calves with diarrhoea; the frequency of student exposure to animals with diarrhoea is Table 3 . From all questionnaires available for analysis, the average number of weeks in which the students were exposed to animals with diarrhoea over the 11-week period was 1.1 (median 1; range 0-4). Three of the students defined as a case did not record contact with calves or other animals or people with diarrhoea prior to the onset of their clinical signs. Table 1 .
