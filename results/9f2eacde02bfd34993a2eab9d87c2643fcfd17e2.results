Twelve Asian or Eurasian children infected with HIV-1 by mother-to-child transmission were treated with HAART from the time of diagnosis. They were 360 (median, 25) months old when initially diagnosed and were therefore heterogeneous with regard to immunologic maturity, duration of infection with HIV-1, and extent of immunodeficiency due to HIV-1. They all had high viral loads and most had low CD4+ cell counts when diagnosed and entered into the study. One child died of lymphoma at age 29 months after she had received HAART for 9 months, during which time her CD4+ cells increased and the viral load decreased to undetectable. At the end of the study, the 11 surviving patients were well and thriving. Seven had normal or higher-than-normal circulating CD4+ cells/mcL, but 4 patients still had reduced numbers and/or percentages. Plasma HIV-1 RNA was consistently below the level of detection in all but 1 of the surviving children when the study closed. Undetectable plasma Multiple regression correlation of numbers of IL-2-secreting cells/106 PBMCs with CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts in 12 pedi-atric patients treated with HAART HIV-1 RNA was achieved in 255 months (median, 9.5 months). For each cytokine and culture condition studied while patients were receiving HAART, 112 corresponding values of CD4+ and CD8+ cells and 96 corresponding values of plasma HIV-1 RNA copies/mL were available. All of these data were used to examine whether cytokine production correlated with disease progression. IFN-gamma, IL-2, and IL-4 ELISPOTs were undetectable in unstimulated PBMCs, as reported previously. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] Numbers of PHA-or Con A-stimulated IL-2-secreting cells increased during recovery from CD4 deficiency and correlated directly with CD4 and CD8 absolute counts, CD4 percentages, and CD4:CD8 ratios and inversely with CD8 percentages by multiple regression analysis. The data could be described by IFN-gamma-, Con A-induced IL-4-and unstimulated IL-10-secreting cells increased significantly as virus load fell ( Figure 4 ). The data were described by the following equation: log 10 viral load = 7.4530.6207 (log 10 IL-4 Con A) 0.9504 (log 10 IL-4 Con A) + 0.5434 (log 10 IL-10 unstimulated). All of the data from ELISPOT assays were plotted against duration of HAART. Numbers of IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-12-secreting cells tended to increase for the first 34 years of treatment but declined thereafter. Changes in IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-alpha-secreting cells over time were less apparent. See Figures 5, 6 , 7, 8 and figures 9, 10 and 11.
