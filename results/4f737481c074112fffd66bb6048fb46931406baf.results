Generation of the recombinant AAV in transfected 293T cells SARS-CoV S protein is a glycoprotein consisting of an S1 and an S2 domain. The S1 domain contains the signal peptide (SP) at the N-terminus and RBD at aa 318 to 510. The S2 domain contains heptad repeat 1 and 2 (HR1 and Fig. 1 . Schematic diagram of S protein of SARS-CoVand pRBD-AAV. The structure of SARS-CoV S protein (A). In the S1 domain, SP and RBD range from 1 to 13 aa (13 aa) and from 318 to 510 aa (193 aa), respectively. The S2 domain contains functional domains HR1, HR2 and TM. DNA encoding 24 aa of the CD5 signal peptide and 193 aa RBD of SARS-CoV S protein was amplified and ligated into the pAAV-IRES-hrGFP plasmid to construct the recombinant pRBD-AAV vector (B). HR2) and a transmembrane domain TM (Fig. 1A) . In the construction of the pRBD-AAV vector, the nucleotide sequence encoding SP was replaced by the CD5 and the latter was ligated to the RBD sequence of SARS-CoV S, and the chimeric gene was subcloned into the multiple cloning sites (MCS) of the pAAV-IRES-hrGFP plasmid (Stratagene, USA) (Fig. 1B) . The resulting pRBD-AAV plasmid, or the blank pAAV plasmid, was co-transfected into 293T cells together with pAAV-RC and pHelper plasmids to produce AAV, which harbors the chimeric CD5-RBD gene (RBD-rAAV) or that which does not harbor the chimeric gene (blank AAV). Intense fluorescence of the humanized recombinant green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) in RBD-AAV ( Fig. 2A ) and blank AAV (Fig. 2B ) was observed in the transfected cells under a fluorescence microscopy at 72 h post-transfection, illustrating a high transfection efficiency of the viral plasmids in 293T cells. The yield of either the RBD-rAAV or the blank AAV from the respective transfected cells harvested from 30 × 100 mm tissue culture dishes was purified and the titer was estimated by real-time quantitative PCR to be 5 × 10 12 viral particles/ml. Fig. 3 compares the transduction of RBD-rAAV and blank AAV in 293T and HeLa cells. In this experiment, 293T and HeLa cells were inoculated with serial dilution of the viruses and after 72 h of incubation, the extent of infection with either virus was assessed by the level of GFP (hrGFP) expressed by these cells, using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry analysis. Fluorescence microscopy shows that 293T cells infected with the rAAVs (Fig. 3A ) are more numerous than HeLa cells (Fig. 3B ). As shown in Fig. 3C , flow cytometry analysis estimates that that 98.4% of 293T cells was infected with RBD-rAAV and 98.2% was infected with blank AAV and this is substantially higher than the levels of infection achieved in HeLa cells with RBD-rAAV (22.6%) or blank AAV (21.7%). These results confirm the findings by Romano et al. (2000) , showing that the infection efficiency of the AAV vector differs for different cells.
