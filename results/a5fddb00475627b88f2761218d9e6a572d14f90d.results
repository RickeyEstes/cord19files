The S. neurona SO SN1 genome is more than twice the size of the T. gondii genome. Combining 7,020,033 reads from the 454 Life Sciences sequencing platform with 529,830,690 reads from the Illumina Hi-Seq sequencing platform, we generated 47,722 Mbp of sequence data from S. neurona SO SN1 DNA. By integrating a variety of assembly algorithms (see Materials and Methods), these data were assembled into 116 genomic scaffolds with a combined size of 127 Mbp, over twice the size of the Neospora caninum and T. gondii genomes ( Table 1 is a summary of the genome statistics obtained). An additional 3.1 Mbp of sequence is encoded in 2,950 unscaffolded contigs (each greater than 500 bp in length). The assembly N50 value was 3,117,290 bp, with a maximum scaffold length of 9,217,112 bp. To help annotation efforts, we generated an additional 59,622,019 reads from S. neurona RNA. From these data, we predict a complement of 7,093 genes, 5,853 of which are supported by RNA-Seq evidence (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The number of genes predicted is comparable to that of the related coccidia T. gondii and Eimeria tenella. Comparisons of gene orderings reveal blocks of syntenic relationships between homologous genes in S. neurona and T. gondii, with the longest such block aligning 43 genes on scaffold 1 of S. neurona and chromosome IX of T. gondii (Fig. 1A) . Chromosome-wide synteny was not observed, suggesting a significant level of genome rearrangement between S. neurona and T. gondii. A more detailed view of the largest syntenic region reveals the extent of gene order preservation but also reveals differences in the structures of individual genes (Fig. 1B) . Given similarities in gene numbers and exon lengths, we next determined the source of the additional sequence associated with To identify factors responsible for the increased intra-and intergenic region sizes, we performed a systematic analysis of repetitive regions across representative apicomplexans with the software tool RepeatModeler (20) . This analysis revealed that the S. neurona genome is rich in repeats largely associated with long interspersed nucleotide element (LINE) and DNA element sequences (class I and II transposons, respectively). Mapping of the repeats to scaffolds revealed that many of the repeats are associated with genes ( Fig. 1B) . Further comparisons of introns, exons, and intergenic regions showed clear differences in the repeat type based on the genomic context (Fig. 1C) . DNA element-type repeats were enriched in intronic regions and virtually absent from exons, suggesting evolutionary pressure against the integration of DNA elements within coding regions. Conversely, LINE-like repeats were equally distributed across exons, introns, and intergenic regions. In total, 31 Mbp of the S. neurona genome had repetitive sequences, compared to 17.9 Mbp of the E. tenella genome and 2.5 Mbp of the T. gondii genome ( Fig. 2A ). S. neurona displays a diverse set of repetitive elements. The repetitive sequences present in S. neurona are extraordinarily diverse, with 203 families of repeats discovered with RepeatModeler, compared to 101 families in E. tenella and 5 in Plasmodium falciparum. The majority of simple repeats within the S. neurona genome belong to more diverse families, unlike other apicomplexan parasites, where simple repeats are largely composed of short repeats (e.g., CAG n in E. tenella [21] ). For example, 33 simple repeat families in S. neurona were composed of consensus sequences with an average length of 287 bp. The average length of the simple repeats was 105 bp in S. neurona, compared to 48 and 68 bp in P. falciparum and E. tenella, respectively. Type II transposons, or DNA elements with 64,732 members, represent the largest family of repeats present in S. neurona, totaling 14.6 Mbp (11.5%) of the genome, considerably more than in E. tenella ( Fig. 2A) . All of the DNA elements identified belong to the "cut-and-paste" families of transposons, which propagate through genomes through excision and insertion of DNA intermediates. The most abundant family of DNA elements belonged to the CACTA-Mirage-Chapaev family of transposons, although a minority of Mutator-like elements was also identified. Active DNA transposons contain transposase genes; however, we were unable to detect any such gene within the S. neurona genome, suggesting that these DNA elements are ancient and degraded. Supporting this view, we found that the ratio of transversions to transitions in alignments of repetitive sequences to DNA repeat families was almost exactly 2:1, the statistically expected rate of mutation in the absence of evolutionary pressure. Given the relative lack of repeats in the T. gondii genome, we explored whether the repeats identified in S. neurona are less active than those identified in E. tenella. When repeats are active, it is possible to identify clades of repeats with significant sequence similarity. Pairwise sequence alignments of members of five families of repeats (Fig. 2B) were highly divergent, indicating that the LINEs and DNA elements are no longer active in S. neurona. Further, the LINEs in S. neurona are more diverse and therefore likely to be more ancient than those in E. tenella. Interestingly, E. tenella, T. gondii, and P. falciparum all feature a bimodal distribution of simple repeats that is lacking in S. neurona. Finally, all three of the coccidian genomes analyzed here displayed similar distributions of sequence divergence of DNA elements, albeit with slightly different means (22.5, 28.1, and 27.8% for E. tenella, S. neurona, and S. neurona-like DNA repeats in T. gondii, respectively). This suggests that while DNA elements are no longer active in these genomes, they did remain active for slightly longer within E. tenella. From these analyses, we conclude that the maintenance of large numbers of LINEs and DNA elements in S. neurona (and E. tenella), even though they are inactive, likely plays a functional role, since T. gondii has removed most of these elements from its genome. The S. neurona apicoplast genome is well conserved with other Apicomplexa. In addition to its nuclear genome, the apicoplast genome of S. neurona SO SN1 was studied by reference mapping to the assembled S. neurona SN3 apicoplast sequence (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Both organellar genome architectures are highly similar to those of Toxoplasma (GenBank accession no. U87145.2) and P. falciparum (22) . There are, however, a few key differences. As in Toxoplasma, both Sarcocystis apicoplast sequences are missing open reading frame A (ORFA). However, unlike Toxoplasma, both S. neurona sequences show a loss of rpl36 and a loss of one copy of tRNA-Met (from the tRNA cluster between rps4 and rpl4). S. neurona also has a feature first observed in the Piroplasmida that is not seen in Toxoplasma, namely, a division of the RNA polymerase C2 gene into two distinct genes (23) . Both S. neurona apicoplast genome sequences uniquely have the insertion of a fragment of rps4 between ORFG and one copy of the large-subunit rRNA in common (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The insert was verified in S. neurona SN3 via PCR and sequencing across this region (see Fig. S2 , S3, and S4 in the supplemental material). The rps4 fragment insertion appears to be very recent because the S. neurona SN3 fragment insert is identical in sequence to the corresponding region in the full-length rps4 gene. Comparison of the S. neurona SO SN1 and SN3 nucleotide sequences to each other reveals a few indels but no single-nucleotide polymorphisms (see Text S1 in the supplemental material). Indels, when present, occur in up to one-third of the reads for the locus. The dominant sequence is identical to that determined for SN3. Each S. neurona apicoplast genome was sequenced to greater than 200ϫ coverage. The S. neurona genome encodes many novel genes and identifies many coccidian-specific innovations. InParanoid predictions suggest that S. neurona has more orthologs in common with T. gondii than with E. tenella, supporting a closer evolutionary relationship (3,169 versus 1,759 groups of orthologs, respectively) ( Fig. 3A ). Consistent with previous gene studies, we identified 1,285 (18%) S. neurona genes with no detectable homology (BLAST score, Ͻ50) to any known gene, suggesting either a high degree of gene innovation or significant sequence divergence from remote homologs. Among the conserved genes, 715 (10%) were conserved (possessing orthologs) in both Cryptosporidium parvum and either P. falciparum or Theileria annulata, identifying a large collection of proteins that could be amenable to broadspectrum drug development. These include members of a variety of ATPase genes, heat shock proteins, DEAD/DEAH helicases, proteins with EF-hand domains, and protein kinases. In addition, we identified 1,285 (18%) genes with homology only within the family Sarcocystidae, representing potential drug targets against tissue cyst-forming coccidia. A majority (55%) of these are annotated as "hypothetical proteins" in the ToxoDB resource (24) . Of the proteins that are annotated, AP2 domain transcription factors, rhoptry kinase (ROPK) and neck proteins, and zinc fingers, as well as proteins with RNA recognition motifs, are prevalent. The S. neurona attachment and invasion machinery is broadly conserved with T. gondii. The process of host cell inva-sion by apicomplexan parasites is a rapid and complex process that relies on a coordinated cascade of interactions between the invading parasite and the host cell. To orchestrate these processes, apicomplexans have evolved families of invasion proteins that are broadly conserved but nevertheless exhibit unique lineagespecific innovations (25) . To identify S. neurona gene models involved in invasion relative to T. gondii, we constructed an invasion protein coexpression network (Fig. 3B ) in which pairs of T. gondii proteins are linked if they exhibit significant coexpression with S. neurona (Pearson correlation coefficient, Ͼ0.8), as has been done for other organisms (26) (27) (28) . This network provides a scaffold onto which conservation and expression data from S. neurona are mapped to yield insights into evolutionary and functional relationships. Consistent with previous studies, we found that conserved proteins (those that have an ortholog in common with S. neurona) tend to have more correlated expression (high Pearson correlation coefficients) and more connections (high node degree) and are better connected within the network (shorter average path lengths and higher betweenness) than their nonconserved counterparts (Fig. 3C) . These findings highlight the potential importance of conserved proteins to the function of the invasion machinery. Within our T. gondii invasion network, we identified two main clusters of highly correlated genes associated with key invasion events. The first involves proteins associated with the micronemes (MIC proteins) which strengthen host cell attachment and play a major role in the formation of the moving junction that forms a specific interface, facilitating invasion. The second involves proteins associated with the rhoptries (RON and ROP proteins), an organelle that is absent from the merozoite stage of all Sarcocystis species, including S. neurona (29) . The genome analyses identified nine previously reported S. neurona orthologs of T. gondii MICs (MIC7, MIC8, MIC10, MIC12, MIC13, MIC14, MIC15, MIC16, and M2AP) (30) . We also identified potential homologs of MIC2, MIC4, and MIC9 that had not been annotated through the gene model prediction pipeline. MIC4 has previously been shown to form part of a heterocomplex with MIC1 and MIC6 (31) . The absence of the latter two homologs from S. neurona suggests that MIC4 likely mediates the more important functional role. MIC7, MIC8, MIC9, and MIC12 are relatively unique in T. gondii with the possession of epidermal growth factor-like domains, suggesting a potential role in ligand binding. MIC10, together with MIC11 (absent from S. neurona) is thought to be involved in the organization of organellar contents. Also secreted by the microneme is apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), which functions to link the inner membrane complex (IMC) to the host cell via interactions with RON proteins that together make up the moving junction (6, 32) . Our searches revealed two loci, separated by approximately 80 kb on the S. neurona assembly's largest scaffold, homologous to T. gondii AMA1 protein TGME49_315730. Interestingly, the reading frames of the two S. neurona paralogs (SnAMA1a and SnAMA1b) occur in opposite directions, suggesting an inverted duplication. Supporting this, two inverted repeats Ͼ100 bp in length and with Ͼ70% identity were identified~20,000 bp apart, separating the two paralogs. While the region upstream of the paralogs appears repeat rich, containing simple repeats, as well as LINEs and DNA elements, the region downstream of the second paralog is uncharacteristically repeat poor, with no repetitive sequences in~14,000 bp of sequence. T. gondii possesses additional paralogs of the AMA1 protein, including TGME49_300130. Again, S. neurona appears to possess these two additional AMA1 paralogs (SnAMA1c and SnAMA1d), but in this case, they are present on two different scaffolds. AMA1 has been shown to interact remarkably strongly with RON2, RON4, and RON5 (32) . In general, RONs were well conserved in S. neurona and T. gondii, with RON2, RON3, RON5, and RON8 orthologs displaying significant sequence similarity across their entire length. Three paralogs of T. gondii RON3 (TgRON3) were identified on a single scaffold, suggesting a tandem duplication, two of which appear to be expressed as predicted by the RNA-Seq data. Putative S. neurona orthologs of RON4 and RON6 were identified through manual inspection of sequence alignments. A pattern of conservation and divergence was observed for a putative ortholog of TgRON9. In T. gondii, RON9 and RON10 form a stable complex distinct from the AMA1-RON2/4/5/8 complex, with disruption of either gene leading to the retention of its partner in the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by degradation. This complex does not play a role in T. gondii invasion and virulence but, because of its conservation with C. parvum, has been linked to interactions involving epithelial cells (33) . While an S. neurona protein could be aligned over~25% of the TgRON9 sequence, it was found to lack a single copy of the 22 copies of the PAEENAEEPKQAEEQANASQSSET motif associated with the T. gondii protein. No homologs to RON1 or RON10 could be identified. Another critical organelle required for host invasion is the IMC, which additionally confers stability and shape on the cell and is thought to mediate critical roles in cytokinesis and host cell egress (34) . We identified 20 putative S. neurona IMC orthologs, with additional evidence of a further six (see Table S2A in the supplemental material). Only TgGAP70, TgAlv6, and TgAlv7 appear to lack homologs. Molecular modeling reveals that SnAMA1a is capable of intimately coordinating SnRON2. To examine if S. neurona AMA1 homologs can bind S. neurona RON2 homologs, we generated structural models of SnAMA1a and SnAMA1b, which show the highest sequence identity (49 and 44%, respectively) with TgAMA1. Both models possess a PAN-like domain architecture for DI and DII (SnAMA1a, Fig. 4A ) consistent with homologs from other apicomplexans (35, 36) . A key feature of DII is an extended loop that packs into the groove of DI and regulates RON2 binding in related AMA1 proteins (37) . In the SnAMA1a model, a cysteine pair localized within the DII loop is a novel feature of AMA1s and may serve as a hinge to regulate loop displacement and, consequently, RON2 binding (Fig. 4A ). Furthermore, the SnAMA1a DII loop appears to be loosely anchored within the DI groove via a Val-Val pair surrounding a central Leu (Fig. 4A ). This is in contrast to TgAMA1 (Fig. 4C) , where a Trp-Trp pair surround a central Tyr, and the SnAMA1b model (Fig. 4B) , where a Trp-Leu pair surround a central Tyr (Fig. 4B) . These models suggest that AMA1 paralogs in S. neurona employ divergent strategies that control DII loop dynamics and govern access to the ligand-binding groove. Focusing on the interaction with RON2, removal of the apical segment of the DII loop from the model of SnAMA1a (mimicking the mature binding surface) led to a pronounced groove similar to the RON2 binding surface observed in TgAMA1 (Fig. 4D) . Indeed, an energy-minimized docked model revealed that SnRON2 domain 3 was accommodated in a U-shaped conformation (SnRON2D3; Fig. 4E ) with an overall topology conserved with respect to the TgAMA1 costructure with a synthetic TgRON2D3 peptide (Fig. 4D) (37) . Key features of the TgAMA1-TgRON2sp interface appear to be conserved at the SnAMA1-SnRON2D3 interface, including a RON2 proline residue that occupies an AMA1 pocket exposed by displacement of the DII loop ( Fig. 4D and E, yellow arrow) and a reliance on hydrophobic interactions to engage AMA1. Overall, modeling of apo SnAMA1a and SnAMA1b, in combination with the complex of SnAMA1a with SnRON2D3, supports the hypothesis that these two proteins can form an intimate binary complex, as observed in related apicomplexan homologs (37, 38) . Of note, both SnAMA1a and SnAMA1b exhibited relatively low levels of expression in the merozoite stage sampled (10.4 and 6.7 fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads [FPKM] , respectively) compared to SnAMA1c and SnAMA1d (63.1 and 83.9 FPKM, respectively), perhaps reflecting a stagespecific role for each AMA1-RON2 pairing. Proteins involved in host regulation in T. gondii are not well conserved in S. neurona. In addition to RONs, rhoptries also secrete a battery of ROP proteins, the products of a group of genes displaying high levels of correlated expression (Fig. 3B) . ROP proteins are secreted into the host cytosol to interact with host cell targets, manipulating pathways that protect the intracellular parasite against clearance. To identify putative S. neurona ROP ho- (39) . In addition to the eight SnROPKs reported previously (39), our phylogenetic analysis identified seven new ROPK orthologs, including: ROP20, ROP26, ROP33, ROP34, and ROP45, as well as two SnROPKs that appear unique to S. neurona (Fig. 5A) . RNA-Seq data support the expression of six of these (ROP14, ROP21, ROP27, ROP30, ROP35, and ROP37) during the merozoite stage, despite this stage's lack of rhoptries and the ability of schizonts to develop in host cell cytoplasm in the absence of a PV (3). Overall, S. neurona contains a smaller complement of ROPKs (n ϭ 15) than E. tenella (n ϭ 27) and a considerably smaller set than T. gondii (n ϭ 55) and N. caninum (n ϭ 44), both of which feature distinct lineage-specific expansions. However, despite its lower number of ROPKs, S. neurona was found to have more ROPKs in common with T. gondii and N. caninum than with E. tenella; only two of the ROPKs in the three tissue cyst-forming coccidia are conserved with E. tenella (ROP21/27 and ROP35), Importantly, we did not find S. neurona homologs corresponding to T. gondii ROPK proteins implicated in murine virulence (ROP5 and ROP18), modulation of STAT3 and STAT6 signaling (ROP16), or mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling (ROP38), which suggests that S. neurona's success and pathogenesis are not dependent on the inactivation of these host-specific pathways and may explain, in part, why this parasite is not infectious in rodents. No information is available regarding the functional role of S. neurona ROPKs. However, six are likely to be active kinases since they retain key "catalytic triad" residues critical for protein kinase function (SnROP21/27, SnROP30, SnROP33, SnROP34, SnROP35). Further, five are likely to be pseudokinases (SnROP20, SnROP22, SnROP26, SnROP36, SnROP37) that have been shown to act as cofactors of the active kinases (e.g., SnROP5 to SnROP18). Finally, only two dense-granule (GRA) protein homologs of T. gondii, GRA10 and GRA12, were identified. The discovery of the latter is surprising, given that it has not been annotated in the N. caninum genome. In addition, like the ROPKs, the majority of the GRA proteins encoded by T. gondii that specifically target host immune signaling pathways to alter parasite pathogenesis are not encoded by S. neurona. These include GRA6, which regulates the activation of the host transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT4); GRA15, which regulates NF-B activation (40); GRA24, which promotes nuclear translocation of host cell p38a MAP kinase (41) ; and the phosphoprotein GRA25, which alters CXCL1 and CCL2 levels to regulate immune responses and control parasite replication (42) . These data indicate either that a different suite of GRA proteins facilitate Sarcocystis host and niche specialization or that Sarcocystis does not require an expanded repertoire of GRA proteins during merozoite replication since it replicates in the host cytosol and is not contained within a PV, like T. gondii or N. caninum.
