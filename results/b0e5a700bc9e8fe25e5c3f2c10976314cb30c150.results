Reference values and ranges of thoracic radiography measurements by age and sex are reported in Tables 2-4. The results from the ANOVA tests examining the effects of age, sex, and age 6 sex interactions on the thoracic radiographic values are presented in Table 5 . Significant effects by age were shown for LL, TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Significant effects by sex were found for TD, TBr, CBr, CR, and R-HHR. Significant effects by age 6 sex were observed for TD, TBr, CBr, and CR. Both TD and TBr increased with age in both sexes, and both were significantly higher in males than in females in the group aged 49-60 months (Fig. 3A, 3B ). CBr increased with age and was significantly higher in males than in females across all age groups (Fig. 3C ). CR declined with age and was significantly higher in males than females across all age groups (Fig. 3D ).
