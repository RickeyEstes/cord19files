Responses from the initial surveys suggest that most jurisdictions are challenged to continue to utilize a variety of surveillance systems for conducting disease surveillance in an era of diminishing resources. One major challenge is the recruitment and retention of well-trained and experienced public health and informatics staff to maintain these systems. Many public health practitioners have been asked to establish new surveillance protocols for an increasing number of diseases associated with novel and emerging viruses including influenza A (H3N2)v infections associated with agricultural fairs and ruling out influenza A (H7N9), MERS-CoV, and even Ebola virus infections. Most jurisdictions continue to struggle to determine which surveillance systems are the most cost-effective for providing the most valuable data in the face of decreasing funding.
