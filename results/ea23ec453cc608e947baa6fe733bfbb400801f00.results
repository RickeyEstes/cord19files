A total of 174 elderly social centers in Hong Kong were invited by e-mail and telephone to join the study. All of these centers were similar in nature with regard to demographics, including membership numbers and the male to female member ratio, and most of them invite experts to give talks about influenza and/or hold annual vaccination programs for the elderly people. However, 157 of these centers refused to participate, with the primary reasons given including a lack of space to conduct interviews, busyness and a reluctance to disclose the personal information of their members. Fifteen centers thus joined the study. A total of 1015 eligible elderly people were recruited from these 15 centers over the 6-month period from January 2005 to June 2005, but 199 of them refused to participate. The primary reasons for refusal were busyness, tiredness and a reluctance to disclose personal information. The remaining 816 elderly participants (response rate = 80.4%) completed the questionnaires. The demographic characteristics of the participants and those who refused to take part were not significantly different (x 2tests; p > 0.05).
