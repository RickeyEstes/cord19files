The study included 268 subjects with SARS (Table) : 99 patients, 67 health care workers infected before implementation of infection control measures, and 102 health care workers infected after implementation of the rule. Most subjects (91% [n ϭ 243]) lived with at least 1 other person. The mean number of household members was 2.6 for health care workers and 2.7 for patients. The mean (Ϯ SD) age among patients was 62.9 Ϯ 19.0 years, and 34% were older than 75 years. The mean duration from illness onset to hospitalization was significantly shorter among health care workers infected after implementation of infection control measures compared with other subjects (P Ͻ0.05; Table) . Only 30 of the 243 (12.3%) SARS subjects who lived with another person transmitted the disease to household members (Table) . Twenty-four of these 30 subjects were non-health care workers. Significantly more patients infected their household members (26.1%) compared with health care workers infected before (9.8%) and after (0%) implementation of infection control measures (P Ͻ0.05). A total of 75 household members lived with the 30 SARS subjects who transmitted the disease, of whom 61 (81.3%) contracted SARS. The rate of infection was significantly higher among household members who were in contact with patients than among those who lived with health care workers infected before implementation of protective measures (86.4% vs. 62.5%, P Ͻ0.05). The overall rate of infection among household members (when all susceptible household members were included) was 8.8% (61/697), with those in contact with patients having a higher overall rate (Table) .
