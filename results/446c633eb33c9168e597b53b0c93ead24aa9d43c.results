Effect of bafilomycin on cultured cells before and after VZV infection. BAF can cause toxicity to cultured cells. Many different concentrations of BAF have been used by virologists in the past 25 years (Table 1) . When we reviewed each of the papers listed in Table 1 , we found that concentrations equal to or less than 30 nM were commonly selected for experiments longer than a few hours' duration, whereas higher BAF concentrations for shorter intervals were selected for studies aimed solely at inhibiting viral entry. Because we were not studying VZV entry, we tested the toxic effect of 10 nM BAF on cultured MRC monolayers. BAF was added when the monolayers were approx-imately 90% confluent. We purposely chose monolayers that were less than confluent because VZV infections are typically carried out in such monolayers (18) . The compound was left in the medium for either 24 h or 48 h. Then, the monolayers were visualized by microscopy and photographed. When they were compared with an untreated control monolayer, it was apparent that addition of BAF to the medium inhibited the MRC5 monolayer from reaching confluence ( Fig. 1A to C). We also enumerated the cell populations by trypan blue exclusion. Addition of BAF for 24 h decreased the cell count by 35% compared with a control monolayer; after removal of BAF, the cell count remained the same 24 h later. Addition of BAF for 48 h decreased the cell count by 53% compared with a control monolayer; after removal of BAF, the cell count decreased another 4% over the next 24 h. Next, we assessed the effects of both VZV infection and BAF treatment on the monolayers (Fig. 1D) . BAF was added at either 24 h postinfection (hpi) or 48 hpi; the cultures were photographed at 72 hpi. There was not a notable difference between the appearances of the infected monolayers treated with BAF and the uninfected monolayers treated with BAF; in other words, the cytopathology was primarily due to the BAF treatment rather than the infection. As expected, the cytopathology in both experiments was more extensive after a 48-h incubation with BAF (Fig. 1D ). Of note, the degree of BAF-induced cytopathology was more than anticipated after reading the papers listed in Table 1 . None of the papers in the table mentioned any observable effects on a monolayer treated with a lower concentration of BAF, such as 10 nM. Effects of bafilomycin on LC3-II and VZV gE production. Because of the known property of BAF to inhibit autophagic flux, we predicted that the production of LC3-II would be increased in BAF-treated cultures. This prediction was confirmed ( Fig. 2A) . We also predicted that the biosynthesis of the VZV glycoproteins would be decreased after BAF treatment of infected cultures. To carry out this experiment, we infected 6 75-cm 2 monolayers with equal numbers of infected cells and then treated 2 of the 6 mono- layers with BAF between 48 and 72 hpi and 2 monolayers with BAF between 24 and 72 hpi. Virus was purified by two sequential sedimentations as described in Materials and Methods, after which the three virus bands were analyzed for the predominant viral glycoprotein VZV gE (Fig. 2B ). As predicted, compared with the untreated control infected culture, the relative amount of gE declined in monolayers treated with BAF, especially for 48 h. As a subsequent confirmatory experiment, we examined similarly treated monolayers by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2C to E). As expected, BAF treatment increased the intensity of autophagosomes within a cell while decreasing the intensity of VZV glycoprotein expression within the cell. We have previously shown that levels of VZV gE expression increase for the first 72 h after infection in the absence of BAF (19) . Because we saw less viral glycoprotein expression in the presence of BAF, we also probed for the Golgi apparatus in another experiment. When we examined the Golgi apparatus with a specific antibody to GM130, the Golgi cisternae in BAF-treated infected cells appeared to be more disassembled than the Golgi cisternae in untreated infected cells ( Fig. 2F and G). However, when we constructed a three-dimensional (3D) image of the Golgi apparatus from a z-stack with Imaris software, the Golgi cisternae were disorganized in both treated and untreated infected cells ( Fig. 2F and G). We also produced images of the Golgi apparatus in uninfected cells; the Golgi cisternae labeled with the anti-GM130 antibody were more linear in these nonstressed cells (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Titers of VZV in cultures treated with bafilomycin. Based on the appearance of the monolayer after BAF treatment, along with the decreased gE production, we predicted that the VZV titer in treated infected cells would be lower than the titer in untreated infected cells. To carry out the titrations, we sonically disrupted the cells in the infected monolayer after a 3-day incubation to obtain cell-free VZV. Following this procedure, the infectivity of the sonicate was titrated by 10-fold dilutions (Fig. 3 ). There was a marked drop in titer in the infected monolayer treated with BAF for 24 h, in other words, from 48 to 72 hpi. The differences in titers between a treated and an untreated monolayer were significant. When the monolayer incubated with BAF for 48 h (24 to 72 hpi) was sonicated and titrated, no infectious cell-free virus was recovered (Fig. 3 ). Because the decrease in infectivity after BAF treatment was substantial while the confocal microscopy experiments shown in Fig. 2 failed to reveal an explanation, we decided to examine the BAF-treated infected cells by electron microscopy. Locations of VZV particles within nuclear membranes and cytoplasm after bafilomycin treatment. Based on the abrupt drop in titer in monolayers treated with BAF, we postulated that the defect was occurring during or after secondary envelopment of the viral particle. For this project, we acquired 230 additional micrographs of both BAF-treated infected and uninfected monolayers. The initial observations of BAF-treated infected monolayers provided an unanticipated finding, namely, numerous viral particles were detected in the perinuclear space (Fig. 4) . These particles often did not have the typical structure of a primary enveloped virus (PEV); instead, they had an aberrant appearance that had been observed previously by ourselves and others in VZV-infected cells without BAF treatment (20) (21) (22) . After further inspection, it was apparent that VZV particles were also found in the cytoplasm, often adjacent to Golgi apparatus-derived vesicles (Fig. 5) . Some of these capsids also were aberrant in appearance (Fig. 5A) . Although most Golgi cisternae were disrupted, an occasional Golgi apparatus with cis and trans cisternae was found; however, we were unable to find any evidence of wrapping of capsids by intact Golgi cisternae (Fig. 5B ). Only after considerable inspection of the 230 micrographs were we able to find a few examples of virus assembly compartments (VACs). The VACs in BAF-treated cells did not contain prototypical enveloped viral particles (virions); instead, they contained enveloped particles without capsids, presumably light particles with varying diameters. The VACs were located near other Golgi-derived vacuoles (Fig. 5C) . A particularly large VAC is shown in Fig. 5D ; this elongated structure was likely a single VAC that extended below and above the plane cut by the microtome. As described in Materials and Methods, we have archives of 932 transmission electron micrographs of VZV-infected monolayers without BAF treatment. Each of these transmission electron micrographs was viewed again as part of this investigation (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). An occasional transmission electron micrograph included an unenveloped viral particle in the cytoplasm, but we were unable to find clusters of capsids in the cytoplasm. It was uncommon to find more than a single naked viral particle along the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) of most infected cells. An occasional capsid was observed entering the inner nuclear membrane (INM). As a general comment, therefore, there appeared to be a greater number of viral particles in the perinuclear space within BAF-treated monolayers. As another control, we reexamined the 932 transmission electron micrographs in our archives and selected 24 that were taken of infected cells at 24 hpi. Because of the low titer of input VZV, newly infected monolayers did not show cytopathic effect until around 36 to 48 hpi. Also because of the low titer of input virus, virus entering a cell could not be easily detected by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at the plasma membrane or at the nuclear membrane during the first 24 hpi (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Thus, the viral particles within the nuclear membrane shown in Fig. 4
