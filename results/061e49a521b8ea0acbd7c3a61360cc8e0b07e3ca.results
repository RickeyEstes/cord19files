Demographics, clinical features, and outcomes for patients with sepsis of unknown origin. The baseline characteristics and 28-day mortality data of all patients (including the 386 patients included in the mNGS analysis) from Vietnamese sites enrolled in the original study are presented in Table 1 . Retrospectively, 129 (34.4%) adult patients (including 54 of the 213 with undiagnosed cases [25%]) had SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) scores of Ն2, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria presently used for sepsis in adults as defined by Sepsis-3 (22) . For pediatric sepsis, no harmonized criteria similar to those for sepsis in adults have been established (23) . Table S1 in the supplemental material for more details; # , the causative agents detected are detailed in the report of the original study (3); $ , more details about the analysis of those 386 patients can be found in Fig. 2 . There was considerable homogeneity between the group of patients included and the group not included in the mNGS analysis (Table 1) . Among the 386 patients with sepsis of unknown cause whose data were included in the mNGS analysis, the most frequent clinical entity was acute respiratory infection (n ϭ 158 [41%]), followed by systemic infection (n ϭ 152 [39.5%]), diarrhea (n ϭ 36 [9.3%]), and central nervous system (CNS) infection (n ϭ 40 [10.5%]) ( Table 1) (3). Ten of these patients (8 adults and 2 children) were recorded as deceased by day 28, accounting for 2.6% of total patients. Overview of virus-like sequences detected by mNGS. In total, 466 samples were sequenced in five MiSeq runs, generating a total of Ͼ26 million reads (median reads per sample, 432,682; range, 540 to 1,916,732) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Despite the inclusion of a nuclease digestion step prior to NA isolation, viral reads accounted for only a small proportion of total reads, ranging from 168,028 (2.5%) to 287,307 (8.4%) reads/run. Evidence of sequences related to 47 viral species belonging to 21 families was detected in 358/386 (93%) patients. The viruses detected included those known to cause human infections, those with unknown pathogenicity, and viruses that have been reported previously to be contaminants found in mNGS data sets or that have not been reported in human samples, as detailed below. Additionally, codetection of Ն2 viruses in the same samples/patients was recorded for 13 patients (see Table S3 ). None of the 10 fatal cases had a viral etiology identified by mNGS. (i) Detection of viruses known to cause human infections. NA sequences of 21 viral species known to be infectious to humans were detected in 137 of 466 (29%) clinical samples from 125 of 386 (32%) individuals by viral metagenomics. The detection rate was reduced to 13.4% (52/386) of the 386 patients included in the mNGS analysis after specific PCR confirmation. There was a significant difference in the number of viral reads generated by mNGS between the groups of samples that were subsequently found to be PCR positive or negative (see Fig. S2 (Fig. 3) . Detailed information about the numbers of viral reads and genome coverage is summarized in Table S7 in the supplemental material. (ii) Detection of sequences related to viruses with unknown pathogenicity. Sequences related to four recently discovered viruses (gemycircularviruses, WU polyomavirus, human pegivirus 2 [HPgV-2], and cyclovirus-VN) whose pathogenicity or tropism remains unknown, but whose genetic materials have been reported in human samples previously, were identified by mNGS in 3.4% of the samples from the 386 Because these viruses are common nonpathogenic infectious agents, they were not subjected to subsequent PCR confirmation testing. [24] and Kadipiro virus [25] ) were detected in 96 and 5 samples, respectively (see Table S4 in the supplemental material). Additionally, sequences related to numerous viruses that have not been reported in human tissues previously were also found (Table S4 ). Here we focus our analysis on viruses that have been reported in human tissues. Viral detection by mNGS followed by PCR confirmation testing in different sample types. The detection rates for human viruses or viruses reported in human tissues were 8% (32/384) for sera, 41% (38/92) for nasal-throat swabs, and 50% (5/10) for stool samples, while all 6 CSF samples available from 40 patients presenting with CNS infection were negative. More viruses were found in pooled nasal-throat swabs than in samples of other types (Fig. 4) . In the sera tested, 12 different viral species were detected, including the wellestablished human pathogens HBV (n ϭ 9), EV (n ϭ 8), rotavirus A (n ϭ 3), dengue virus (DENV) (n ϭ 2), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (n ϭ 2), human parechovirus (n ϭ 1), HRV (n ϭ 1), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (n ϭ 1) (Fig. 4) .
