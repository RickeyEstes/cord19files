To check the performance of the proposed method, it was tested on different datasets. Some datasets are small sized and others are medium sized. The length of sequences ranges from seven thousands to several millions base pairs. In order to compare and analyze various genomic data, we generated a distance matrix using Eq. (12) for each distinct step k using the method described above. We increased step k until we obtained the same distance matrix for two consecutive distinct k(suppose k = h and h + 1, where h is a fixed integer), (i.e., the root mean square distance 47 between two distance matrices generated by step h and h + 1 should be zero). Therefore, we considered k = h an optimal step and generate the phylogenetic tree at step k = h using the PHYLIP package. Here, we use the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) approach in the PHYLIP package 38 to generate the phylogenetic tree. To test the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we selected ten sets of test data: (i) 18S rDNA sequences from 11 Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi isolates, (ii) 16S rDNA sequences from 40 bacterial isolates, (iii) 41 mammalian mitochondrial genomes, (iv) 59 ebolavirus complete genomes, (v) 30 coronavirus whole genomes, (vi) 30 bacterial whole genomes, (vii) 48 Hepatitis E virus (HEV) whole genomes, www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (viii) 24 Eutherian mammals sequences, (ix) 58 genome datasets from different species and (x) 29 Escherichia/ Shigella complete genomes. We compared our tree with the tree generated by the previously published method using same datasets. Phylogenetic tree analysis using 18S rDNA sequences from 11 arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) isolates. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (which is also called an AM fungi (AMF) or endomycorrhiza) is a type of mycorrhiza in which the fungus infects vascular plants by penetrating the cortical cells of the root. Arbuscular mycorrhizas are characterized by the formation of unique structures (arbuscules) and vesicles, these fungi belong to phylum glomeromycota. Arbuscular mycorrhizas fungi help plants to capture nutrients, such as www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen and micronutrients, from soil. The development of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis is believed to have played a crucial role in the initial colonization of plants on land and in the evolution of vascular plants 48 . We built a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) using the optimal step k = 8 of 11 AMF sequences listed in Table S1 . To compare our method with an alignment-based method, we also constructed the phylogenetic tree (Fig. S1 ) by ClustalW method using MEGA package 49 . We characterized 11 AMF sequences based on their families and genera. All rhizophagus genera belonging to family glomeraceae were clustered together in cluster (a), except one genus of rhizophagus (i.e., the "15 Rhi in" sequence belongs to cluster (d)). All glomus genera belonging to family glomeraceae were clustered in cluster (b). All gigaspora genera belonging to family gigasporaceae were clustered in cluster (c). While comparing the tree prepared by our method (Fig. 1) with the tree prepared by ClustalW method (Fig. S1 ) using the UPGMA approach, we found that, glomus genera were clustered together in Fig. 1 which was lacking in Fig. S1 . An obvious flaw in both the phylogenetic trees (Figs 1 and S1) is, none of them clustered rhizophagus genera in the single clade. Phylogenetic tree analysis using 16S rDNA sequences from 40 bacterial isolates. Endophytic bacteria are an essential part of plant systems and play significant roles in plant growth and development 50 . The 40 bacterial sequences were obtained from pure cultures of endophytic bacteria isolated from the www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ surface sterilized mature endosperms of six rice varieties. The rice seeds were collected from two different locations in north-east India: North-Lakhimpur, Assam, Aizawl and Mizoram. Genomic DNA was extracted from the pure cultures, and the full length 16S rDNA sequences were amplified using the primer pair 27f (5′-AGAGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG) and 1492r (5′-TACCTTGTTAYGACTT). The amplicons were sequenced in an Applied Biosystems sequencer using the BigDye terminator method. To minimize sequencing error, we also used two internal primers 533f/805r along with 27 f/1492r. We assembled the contigs based on their phred scores (15) using the Codon Code aligner v7.0.1, BioEdit and SeqTrace v0.9 software 51 . The contigs were checked for the presence of any chimeras in mothur v1.35.1 and were aligned for identification against the NCBI reference rRNA database using the blastn algorithm. Information, including the accession numbers, phyla, classes, orders and families for the 40 bacterial isolates are listed in Table S2 . With there 40 bacterial isolates, we generated a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2) with our approach using the optimal step k = 6. The tree (Fig. 2 ) obtained by our method was compared with the tree (Fig. S2 ) obtained by ClustalW method using MEGA package 49 . Our algorithm separated the 40 bacterial sequences into two major clades: clade A (purple) and clade B (green) (Fig. 2) . Clade A branched into two clades: clade A1 (bold black) and clade A2 (purple). Clade A1 contained only Staphylococcus warneri, which separated out as an outgroup from the sequences in clade A2. Clade A2 consisted of 25 sequences, of which one sequence represented phylum firmicutes, three sequences represented actinobacteria, and the remaining 21 sequences belonged to phylum proteobacteria. Our method successfully grouped sequences of genus pantoea together, but in one instance it placed pantoea and xanthomonas as sister groups. In the same clade, our method placed a third sequence belonging to xanthomonas as an outlier. Additionally, in clade A2, brevibacillus and pantoea were clustered as a sister group, which belong to phylum firmicutes and proteobacteria respectively and curtobacterium was grouped with luteibacter. None of the actinobacterial sequences were grouped together in this clade. The second major cluster or clade B(green) consisted of 14 sequences. Bacillus marisflavi was an outlier from the remaining 13 sequences. In this cluster, Curtobacterium plantarum and Pantoea agglomerans were placed together as sister groups, which might indicate sequence similarity between the two species. Three actinobacterial species (two sequences of C. plantarum and one sequence of Microbacterium proteolyticum) were placed together in one clade. However, C. plantarum and M. proteolyticum were placed as sister groups, and the other C. plantarum sequence was positioned as an outlier. When we compared our method (Fig. 2) with ClustalW method (Fig. S2) , we found that both methods clearly separated the 40 bacterial sequences into two major clades. Each www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ clade contains the same type of bacterial sequences, but the order was interchanged. In clade A, our method failed to cluster xanthomonas together, which was grouped together in the result obtained by ClustalW.
