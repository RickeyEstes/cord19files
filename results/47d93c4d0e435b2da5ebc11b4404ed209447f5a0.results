Lentiviral-mediated gene transfer efficiently increases or down-regulates Ace2 mRNA and ACE2 protein expression in rat lung tissue. Compared with control animals, ACE2 mRNA and protein levels in the lung tissue of the Lv-ACE2 group (rat lung transfected with Lenti-Ace2) were increased by 9.47 and 4.21 fold, respectively; in contrast, the ACE2 mRNA and protein levels in Lenti-Ace2-RNAi infected rat lungs (Lv-ACE2-RNAi group) were decreased by 52% and 80%. There were no significant differences in ACE2 mRNA and protein expression between the control group and Lv-NC group (rat lung transfected with recombinant lentivirus carrying negative control shRNA). These results showed high efficiency of Ace2 or Ace2-shRNA gene transfer into rat lung via intratracheal injection. (Fig. 1A -C) ACE2 prevents rat from LPS-induced acute lung injury. After 8 hours, LPS treatment resulted in acute lung injury as demonstrated by edema, inflammation, and hemorrhage ( Fig. 2A) . The lung injury score (Fig. 2B ) and BALF protein level (Fig. 2C ) of the LPS group were significantly increased as compared with the control group. ACE2 overexpression in rat lung markedly attenuated LPS-induced lung injury and decreased the lung injury score and BALF protein level. In sharp contrast, silencing ACE2 noticeably deteriorated LPS-induced lung injury as evidenced by increased lung injury score and BALF protein level. Furthermore, pretreatment with either A779, a potent and selective antagonist of Ang-(1-7) via competitively binding with its specific Mas receptor, or MLN-4760, the ACE2 inhibitor, significantly inhibited the protective effects of ACE2 on LPS-induced lung injury. The lung injury score and BALF protein level of the LPS+ ACE2+ A779 group were significantly higher than that of LPS+ ACE2 group, suggesting that ACE2 protects rat from LPS-induced acute lung injury, partially via Mas-mediated signaling.
