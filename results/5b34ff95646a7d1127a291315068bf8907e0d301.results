All the sequences determined were very similar (>99% identical) to the reference CV777 sequence but each was unique (n.b., for the complete viral genome a 1% difference corresponds to 280 nt changes). Accession numbers for the sequences have been submitted to the ENA under the study accession no. PRJEB20818. Throughout the description of changes in the sequence, the numbering system used is that from the reference sequence of 28033 nt for CV777 [2] (Accession no. AF353511). The genome organization of PEDV is shown in Fig 1. The nt sequence changes for each of the different strains and the amino acid substitutions that result (when applicable) are listed in Table 1 . Each of these six sequences lacked nt 72 and nts 82-85 compared to the reference sequence. The key features of the individual strains/ sequences and for the separate regions of the genome (see Fig 1) are described separately below for each laboratory. Sequence length and coverage of the different strains a) DTU National Veterinary Institute (DTU-Vet). A single contig of 28085 nt corresponding to the Br1/87 genome was assembled, de novo, from the sequence reads. Essentially, the same sequence was obtained from two independent RNA preparations (one sequence lacked the 5'-terminal 6 nt relative to the other). The average coverage across the genome was about 1250 reads per nt. There were just 4 nt changes (all non-synonymous) within the coding sequence compared to the reference sequence. Some more significant changes were detected near the terminus of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR), these are described in more detail below. b) Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e dell'Emilia Romagna (IZS-LER). A single contig of 27945 nt corresponding to the CV777 genome was assembled (note that compared to the reference sequence 24 nt are missing at the 5'-terminus and 7 nt at the 3'terminus (mainly because of the PCR strategy used). The average coverage across the genome was about 953 reads per nt. In comparison to the reference sequence, in this sequence, there were 2 clear single nt changes and a mixture of bases at nt 25655 plus a single 52 nt deletion within the coding region. c) ANSES-Laboratory of Ploufragan-Plouzan√© (ANSES). A single contig of 28028 nt corresponding to the CV777 genome was assembled, de novo. The average coverage across the genome was 7103 reads per nt. There was just a single nt difference between this sequence and the reference sequence throughout the entire coding sequence. A single nt change (at nt 8) was observed in the 5'-UTR which was shared with the APHA sequence. d) Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI). A single contig of 27998 nt was assembled, de novo, for the V215-78 strain from 607383 reads, with a mean read length of 300 nt, giving an average coverage of 6508 reads per nt. Just 5 nt changes plus 3 separate deletions (3-52nt in length) were detected in the entire coding region compared to the reference sequence.
