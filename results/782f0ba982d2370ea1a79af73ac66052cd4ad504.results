Cellular À1 RF signals are mRNA destabilizing elements Four operational yeast cellular À1 RF signals derived from the BUB3, EST2, SPR6 and TBF1 genes were employed to test the hypothesis that À1 RF signals function as mRNA destabilization elements. The slippery heptamers for these À1 RF signals begin at nucleotides 858, 1653, 279 and 1521 of their respective ORFs. These were cloned into a yeast PGK1 reporter gene so that frameshifted ribosomes are directed to PTCs. All inserts were flanked by sequences derived from Renilla and firefly luciferase genes, providing unique exogenous sequences for specific detection of the reporter mRNAs. Two additional PGK1 reporters without À1 RF signals were used as controls: a readthrough reporter encoded a continuous ORF, while a PTC control contained an in-frame UAA termination codon ( Figure 1 ). Reporters were introduced into wild-type yeast cells; their steady state mRNA abundances were determined by RNA blot analysis and normalized to U3 snoRNA controls ( Figure 2) . A Figure 1 . Schematic of PGK1 reporter vectors used to monitor the effects of À1 RF signals on mRNA stability. The indicated Renilla and firefly luciferase derived sequences from pJD375 were cloned into the unique KpnI restriction site in a high copy PGK1 expression vector to create the readthrough control (pJD753). The indicated À1 RF signals derived from BUB3, EST2, SPR6 and TBF1 were cloned into SalI/BamHI digested pJD753. Colored arcs depict computationally predicted base-paired stems (17) . The premature termination control (PTC) was constructed by mutagenizing pJD753 to create an in-frame TAA codon. minimum of three independent blots were performed for all experiments. We note that the blots shown in Figure 2 are simplified for the purpose of publication and that the strains are not all isogenic with one another. In contrast, the bar graphs shown in Figure 2 represent data summarized from multiple blots using isogenic strains. In wild-type cells, all four of the cellular À1 RF signals and the in-frame PTC containing control were less abundant than the PGK1 reporter mRNA (Figure 2A ). The decrease in mRNA steady-state abundance varied from $100-fold of the readthrough control (EST2) to $0.19-fold of wild-type (TBF1). Experiments were also performed in upf1D and dom34D strains, and the U3 snoRNA-normalized signal intensities were compared among the same signals between wild-type and mutant strains to determine the relative contributions of NMD and NGD on steady-state abundance of the À1 RF signal-containing reporters ( Figure 2B and C). The PTC containing mRNA was only affected through the NMD pathway: 28-fold increased abundance in upf1D cells relative to wild-type cells, but no change in dom34D cells. The TBF1 À1 RF signal similarly affected the reporter signal only through NMD ($4-fold). In contrast, the steady-state abundance of the EST2 and BUB3 À1 RF signal-containing reporter mRNAs were increased in both the upf1D and dom34D mutants: the EST2 signal was 35-fold less effective in decreasing mRNA abundance in upf1D cells when compared to the WT strain and $14-fold less effective in dom34D cells, while the values for the BUB3 signal were $7-fold and 8-fold, respectively. The steady-state abundance of the SPR6 À1 RF signal containing reporter mRNA was primarily increased in dom34D cells ($2.0-fold). Deletion of DCP1, XRN1 and SKI3, all of which function downstream of UPF1 or DOM34, also generally increased the abundance of the reporter mRNAs ( Figure 2D -F). We note however that, in the case of the dcp1D cells, the reporter mRNAs were relatively abundant, most likely because of the presence of the 3 0 ! 5 0 exonuclease activity of the exosome, and/or due to decapping activity contributed by other factors, e.g. by the presence of the L-A virus (29) . These results establish that endogenous cellular À1 RF signals can decrease mRNA steady-state abundance in yeast through the NMD pathway. In addition, the data are consistent with the hypothesis that a subset of these signals may also affect mRNA abundance through NGD, although substantiation of this claim requires further studies, e.g. to monitor the abundance of the endonucleolytic cleavage products and mRNA stability assays in NGD À strains. The EST2 À1 RF signal at nucleotide 1653 is primarily destabilized by À1 RF induced NMD Figure 2 suggests that À1 RF induced NMD is the major cause of decreased mRNA steady-state abundance by the EST2 À1 RF signal beginning at nucleotide 1653. To confirm this, a series of time course mRNA decay assays were performed employing the PGK1-EST2 À1 RF reporter, the readthrough control, and the PTC containing construct in cells harboring the temperature sensitive rpb1-1 allele of RNA polymerase II. At the zero time point, cells were shifted to the non-permissive temperature (42 C) to arrest transcription of mRNAs, total cellular mRNAs were extracted at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 min. subsequent to the temperature shift, and RNA blots were hybridized with the firefly luciferase and U3 snoRNA probes. While the readthrough control was stable in wild-type cells ( Figure 3A and D) , both the PTC containing control and the reporter containing the EST2 À1 RF signal promoted rapid exponential decay of the reporter mRNA, thus demonstrating that this À1 RF signal can operate as an mRNA destabilizing element ( Figure 3B-D) . In a parallel experiment using rpb1-1 upf1D cells, all of the reporter mRNAs remained stable ( Figure 3E-H) . The rapid decay kinetic profile of the EST2 À1 RF containing reporter, and its stabilization in NMD-deficient cells are consistent with NMD being the major decay pathway triggered by this element (19) . To independently test of this, the A AAA AAT slippery site was partially inactivated by mutating it to G AAG AAC. This silent mutation stabilized the reporter mRNA $19-fold compared to the wild-type slippery site in wild-type, i.e. DOM34 cells ( Figure 3I ). Interestingly, this is less than the 35-fold stabilization in upf1D cells. One would expect that, since NMD is dependent of À1 RF, then inactivation of À1 RF should be quantitatively the same as inactivation of NMD. To address this, the steady state abundance of the G AAG AAC slippery site containing PGK1 reporter was assayed in an isogenic dom34D strain ( Figure 3I, dom34D lane) . This combination increased the steady-state abundance of the reporter mRNA to near wild-type levels. Ablation of À1 RF signals increases the steady-state abundance of the yeast EST2 mRNA, and À1 RF efficiency inversely correlates with EST2 mRNA abundance The EST family of yeast genes is named after their 'Ever Shortening Telomere' phenotype (30) . EST2 encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase and the other three EST genes either encode protein subunits of telomerase (EST1 and EST3) or a telomere-associated regulator of telomerase (CDC13/EST4) (31) . Telomere elongation occurs in late S phase, although Est2p is associated to varying extents with telomeric chromatin throughout the cell cycle, and telomerase defects result in chromosome instability and rapid senescence (32) . The very low abundance EST2 mRNA is stabilized in NMD-deficient cells (33, 34) . Computational analyses revealed that EST2 contains four additional high confidence À1 RF signals beginning at positions 72, 1215, 1326 and 1995 (Supplementary Figure S1 ). The positions of the five predicted À1 RF signals in the EST2 ORF are shown in Figure 4A . Silent protein coding changes were introduced into the slippery sites of all 5 of the À1 RF signals in a full-length EST2 clone expressed from a low copy vector (pEST2ssÁ, Figure 4A ). Clones expressing either wild-type EST2 (pEST2) or pEST2ssÁ were introduced into isogenic est2D or est2D upf1D cells, and qRT-PCR analyses were performed. These silent mutations resulted $8.5-fold increase in the abundance of the full-length EST2ssÁ mRNA relative to wild-type EST2 mRNA ( Figure 4B) . Similarly, abrogation of NMD increased the abundance of the wild-type EST2 and EST2ssÁ mRNAs $5.8-fold and $7.0-fold, respectively. To independently monitor the influence of À1 RF on mRNA abundance, the steady-state abundance of the EST2 mRNA was monitored in isogenic cells expressing up-and down-frameshift promoting alleles of RPL3 (which encodes ribosomal protein L3) by qRT PCR. EST2 mRNA abundances were normalized to U3 snoRNA in cells expressing wild-type RPL3, the rpl3-R247A allele which decreases À1 RF from the L-A frameshift signal to $55% of wild-type levels (35) , and the rpl3-W255C/P247S allele which increases À1 RF by $1.6-fold (36) . Relative to wild-type cells, steady-state abundance of the EST2 mRNA was increased by 1.29 ± 0.04 fold in cells expressing rpl3-R247A, and decreased to 0.55 ± 0.02 in cells expressing rpl3-W255C/P247S ( Figure 4C ). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that À1 RF induced NMD plays a significant role in destabilizing EST2 mRNA. Programmed À1 ribosomal frameshifting, but not specific À1 RF signals appears to be conserved and rapidly evolving in budding yeasts If regulation of gene expression through À1 RF is biologically significant, then À1 RF signals should be present in orthologous mRNAs from other budding yeast species. To address this, the BUB3, EST2, SPR6 and TBF1 orthologs were identified in S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. bayanus, S. castellii, S. kudriavzevii and S. kluyveri, and analyzed for potentially significant À1 RF signals as previously described (15) . At first glance, Positions of the slippery sites of five predicted À1 RF signals and their sequences are indicated. The full-length gene including native 5 0 and 3 0 UTR sequences were cloned into a low-copy yeast vector to create pEST2. Silent coding mutations that are predicted to inactivate À1 RF were introduced to produce pEST2ssÁ. (B) pEST2 or pEST2ssÁ were introduced into est2D or est2D upf1D cells and EST2 mRNA steady state abundances were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. (C) Quantitative real-time PCR was used to monitor steady-state abundance of the endogenous EST2 mRNA in isogenic cells expressing three different forms of ribosomal protein L3: Wild-Type RPL3 (WT); the R247A mutant which promotes decreased rates of À1 RF and the W255C/P257S mutant which promotes increased À1 RF efficiency. EST2 mRNA abundances were normalized to U3 snoRNA abundance for each sample, and the values shown are relative to wild-type cells. these analyses reveal that no single À1 RF signal is completely conserved among the budding yeasts (Supplementary Table S4) . However, closer analysis shows that strong candidate À1 RF signals can be identified in the orthologs of all of these genes, although not in every species. For example, as noted above, the S. cerevisiae EST2 mRNA contains five potential À1 RF signals. Similarly, the S. paradoxus ortholog contains five potential À1 RF signals, although none are identical to the S. cerevisiae elements. S. mikatae EST2 appears to harbor two potential À1 RF signals, S. bayanus has three, and S. castelli contains two, and S. kluyveri has three. None were identified in the S. kudriavzevii EST2 ortholog. Turning to SPR6, the S. cerevisiae mRNA contains a second potential À1 RF signal beginning at nucleotide 348 in addition to that identified beginning at nucleotide 279 (see http://cbmgintra.umd.edu/prfdb/index .cgi/detail?id=1755&accession=SGDID:S0000917& slipstart=348). Both the S. paradoxus and S. kudriavzevii SPR6 orthologs contain three potential À1 RF signals, but none were identified in the S. mikatae S. bayanus or S. castelli orthologs. Interestingly, the S. kluyveri SPR6 ortholog contains a slippery site followed by a strong stem-loop structure; while this may or may not constitute a À1 RF signal, it does suggest the presence of a rapidly evolving cis-acting element (see Discussion below). S. cerevisiae BUB3 contains the operational À1 RF signal at nucleotide 858, plus potential À1 RF signals beginning at nucleotides 27 and 732. The orthologous mRNAs in S. paradoxus, S. bayanus, S. castelli and S. kudriavzevii each appear to have one potential À1 RF signal, but none were identified in S. mikatae or S. kluyveri. Lastly, the S. cerevisiae TBF1 mRNA has only the single confirmed À1 RF signal. The S. castelli, S. kudriavzevii and S. kluyveri orthologs contain two each, and the S. mikatae has one. No potential À1 RF signals were identified in either S. paradoxus or S. bayanus. As a control, six S. cerevisiae genes lacking predicted À1 RF signals were selected (PGK1, HHT1, TEF2, MIC14, CMD1 and GRX1), orthologs from the six other yeast species identified, and these were in turn queried for the presence of putative À1 RF signals. These analyses revealed that none of the orthologs of these six genes contain predicted À1 RF signals (Supplementary Table S5 , and hyperlinked data therein). The potential evolutionary significance these observations are discussed below.
