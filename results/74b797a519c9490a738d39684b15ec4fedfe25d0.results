Since the beginning of 2014, 1896 respiratory samples were tested, of which 39 (2%) were positive for enterovirus. Eighteen samples tested positive for EV-D68, obtained from 16 different patients admitted to our hospital. (Table 2 ). Eleven cases were children of whom five presented with severe respiratory illness, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Of these five severely ill children, two (aged 1 year and 1 year/7 months) had been previously healthy and two were ex-prematures (aged 3 years/10 months and 1 month). One of the previously healthy children (patient 6) was given resuscitation prior to admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. One child had sickle cell anemia as underlying condition (3 years/9 months). Two children were admitted with a moderately severe bronchiolitis-type respiratory infection with wheezing and shortness of breath. Four children had mild respiratory infections with common cold-symptoms only. These children all had underlying conditions for which they were admitted to our hospital. Interestingly, two of these children (patient 8 and 9) acquired the infection several days after admission. The sequences of these isolates were identical with the sequence of patient 7 (GenBank Accession numbers: KM887895, KM887898 and KM887899). Both patient 8 and 9, were admitted to the same pediatric intensive care unit during the same period as the admission of patient 7, which suggests nosocomial transmission. Five cases of EV-D68 infections were from adults. All adult patients had underlying conditions predisposing them to respiratory tract infections. One patient was a heart transplantation patient, one was a lung transplant patient, one was a kidney transplantation patient, one had asthma and one had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). All five adults had to be admitted to the hospital with symptoms of cough, shortness of breath and wheezing. The patient with a kidney transplant (patient 16) had radiological signs compatible with pneumonia. In all 16 cases, the diagnosis of EV-D68 infection was made following a positive PCR result for enterovirus and subsequent sequencing. EV-D68 partial VP1 sequences were submitted to GenBank, accession numbers: KM887894-KM887906 and KM924544-KM924547.
