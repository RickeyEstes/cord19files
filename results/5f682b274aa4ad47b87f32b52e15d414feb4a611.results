Respiratory viral testing results obtained on admission and during hospitalization are displayed in Tables 1 and 2 . Seventy-six children developed health care-acquired respiratory viral infections (60 in non-ICUs and 16 in ICUs) in the preintervention season compared with 52 (37 in non-ICUs, 15 in ICUs) during the postintervention season. The proportion of health care-acquired infections and infections present on admission due to influenza decreased during the postintervention season (P < .01). The incidence rate of health care-acquired respiratory viral infections due to any viral pathogen significantly decreased in the non-ICU floors (3.37-2.14 infections per 1,000 at-risk patient days; rate ratio, 0.63; confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.97; P = .03) during the postintervention season but not in the ICUs (1.95-1.57 infections per 1,000 at-risk patient days; rate ratio, 0.81; CI, 0.37-1.74; P = .67).
