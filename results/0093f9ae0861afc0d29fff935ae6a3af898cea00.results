Thrombocytopenia in Japanese macaques. Table 1 shows the individual numbers of animals that developed the disease in the first and second outbreaks, along with details regarding sex, age, date of onset, date of death, and blood data. Japanese macaques at KUPRI were kept separately according to where they originated and the letters (e.g., TH, AR, and HG) before each individual number represent the birthplace of the animal or its ancestors. Onset was determined on the basis of decreased PLT counts or the pathological findings at necropsy. The disease progressed extremely rapidly after the onset (death within zero to a few days), and in some macaques, the disease was detected only after death; thus, blood data were not available for these individuals. Severely decreased PLT counts and lowered WBC and RBC counts were found in all macaques that developed the disease, with PLT counts close to zero at the time of death in nearly all cases. Blood data from healthy Japanese macaques kept at KUPRI showed that the normal levels were PLT counts of 29.0 6 7.8 3 10 4 /ml, WBC counts of 12.2 6 3.8 3 10 2 /ml, and RBC counts of 505 6 37 3 10 4 /ml. These data indicated that the macaques that contracted the disease had extreme anemia. The Japanese macaques that contracted the disease did not share any attributes such as sex, birthplace, age, or genealogy. Life prolongation was possible to some extent with blood transfusion, but treatments with any drugs or antibiotics had no effect at all. As a result, many diseased macaques were euthanized from November 2009 onward, and samples were collected from them. After the onset occurred, the fatality rate was extremely high and only one macaque survived each outbreak. PLT counts recovered in these two macaques. Clinical investigation and necropsy. The main clinical findings in the macaques that contracted the disease were reduced appetite, recumbency, facial pallor, hemorrhaging of the nasal mucosa and gums, subcutaneous bleeding, and brown-colored mucous and bloody stool (external appearance; Fig. 1A -E). Animals that exhibited these symptoms died within one to three days. Necropsy of the dead macaques revealed hemorrhaging of all tissues, with particularly marked petechial hemorrhaging of the serosa and/or the mucous surface of the digestive tract, and pulmonary hemorrhaging (necropsy findings; Fig. 1F , G). Splenomegaly was observed in some macaques, but other macroscopic lesions could not be identified. Blood examination. Figure 2 shows the changes in PLT, WBC, and RBC counts of the affected macaques. Because the onset was sudden, as stated above, little information from prior to the onset was available. However, blood data were monitored in some macaques (ID: HGN155, HGN156, HGN161 and WK1649) that were kept in the same breeding rooms as the macaques that contracted the disease. These data showed that PLT counts were maintained at 10 3 10 4 /ml or above from two weeks to ten days before the onset, after which they dropped rapidly. Furthermore, PLT and WBC counts dropped before RBC counts decreased. However, no remarkable changes were noted in any other serum biochemical values, and the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, did not increase in any macaque that contracted the disease (data not shown). Antibody tests against viral pathogens. Antibodies against Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses, which induce hemorrhagic syndromes in humans, were all negative. Neutralizing antibodies against canine distemper virus (CDV) were also negative. The results of the antibody tests against eight simian pathogenic viruses are shown in Table 2 . Antibody prevalence levels against simian Epstein-Barr virus (SEBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and simian foamy virus (SFV) were quite high in the affected macaques; however, the levels in the healthy controls were also high. Thus, there appeared to be no correlations between the disease and these viruses. Anti-SRV antibodies were negative in all affected macaques tested. Electron microscopy (EM). EM analysis detected the presence of enveloped viral particles with prominent spikes, which measured 70-120 nm in diameter, in the plasma of 3/3 Japanese macaques (ID: HGN174, HGN181 and IZ1470) showing symptoms (Fig. 3 ). PCR and RT-PCR analyses of viral pathogens. All DNA viruses listed in Table 3 were not detected by the specific PCR in the plasma of 3/3 Japanese macaques (ID: HGN174, HGN181 and IZ1470) that contracted severe thrombocytopenia. In the case of RNA viruses, SRV and SRV-4 (Table 3, 12 and 13) but none of the other RNA viruses were positive according to RT-PCR (data not shown). Rapid determination of viral sequences (RDV) method. RDV was performed to examine the affected macaques (ID: HGN174, HGN181 and IZ1470), and we determined the nucleotide sequences of 136, 118, and 50 amplicons from RNA viruses, double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses, and single-strand (ss) DNA viruses, respectively. However, we did not detect any known ds DNA or ss DNA viral sequences, whereas we detected partial sequences that were virtually identical to SRV-4 in 4/136 amplicons from RNA viruses. Metagenomic analysis. To further explore the existence of pathogens, we independently performed metagenomic analysis of the plasma of an affected macaque (ID: TBN201 The hyphen (-) indicates that data was not obtained. www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 5 : 8850 | DOI: 10.1038/srep08850 S1). Other candidate viral genomes were not detected by metagenomic analysis. Virus isolation. Virus isolation tests using Vero E6, human SLAM-Vero, canine SLAM-Vero cells, and embryonated egg cultures were performed using plasma samples, which detected no cytopathic effect (CPE) in the cell cultures after five serial passages, and no abnormalities were observed in egg cultures after five days of incubation. The inoculated Vero cells and human and canine SLAM-expressing Vero cells were examined for the presence of viral antigens using the plasma of affected macaques. However, no viral antigens were detected in the cells by indirect immunofluorescence tests (data not shown). A hemagglutination test using the allantoic fluid of the inoculated eggs and RBCs of turkeys was also negative (data not shown). When peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the SRV-4-provirus positive Japanese macaques (ID: TH1626 and IZ1470) were cocultivated with Raji cells, typical SRV CPE including syncytia were observed after three days of cocultivation. DNA from Raji cells were examined by nested PCR using SRV-4 specific primers, and PCR products of the expected size were observed following agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Detection of SRV-4 viral genome by RT-PCR or PCR. RT-PCR using each of two primer sets for viral RNA from affected macaques amplified single products of the expected size. Thirty affected macaques for which sera or plasma were stored in KUPURI, including the 14 macaques, which were examined by antibody tests (Table 2) , were all positive for SRV-4 in both RT-PCR test. In contrast, healthy controls at the second campus of KUPRI were all negative for SRV. Partial results of RT-PCR were shown in Fig. 4 . Nested PCR for proviral DNA revealed that the 14 affected macaques described above were all positive for SRV-4. On the other hand, healthy controls at the second campus were all negative (data not shown). in Japanese macaques that developed severe thrombocytopenia. PLT counts were maintained at 10 3 10 4 /ml or above from two weeks to ten days before the onset, after which they dropped rapidly. Furthermore, PLT and WBC counts dropped before RBC counts decreased. Phylogenetic analyses. After RT-PCR and sequencing using SRV genomic RNA from one affected macaque (ID: OK2015), a partial sequence of gag gene (514 bp) was determined. The nucleotide sequence data obtained in this study is available in the DDBJ/ EMBL/GenBank databases under the accession number AB933257. The same sequence was also detected in viral RNA extracted from affected macaques (ID: IZ1470, TH1626, TBN201, TH2158 and AR1649) (data not shown). Figure 5 shows the phylogenetic relationships among SRVs, which were inferred from the partial gag sequences. The phylogenetic tree indicates that the SRV detected here from Japanese macaques clustered with the SRV-4 strains isolated from cynomolgus macaques in Texas and California, USA 4 , and Tsukuba, Japan 5 .
