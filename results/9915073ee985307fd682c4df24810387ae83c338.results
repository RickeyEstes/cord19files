Taxane-induced RNA disruption in A2780 and CaOV3 cells is both dose-and time-dependent RNA disruption in A2780 cell cultures became evident at a dose of 0.005 μM for both docetaxel and paclitaxel, but peaked at 0.2 and 1 μM for these drugs, respectively. RNA disruption was evident in the taxane-treated cells by the presence of abnormal bands on the electropherogram, distinct from the normal RNA banding pattern seen in untreated cells ( Fig. 1a and c) . Furthermore, a significant decrease in total cellular RNA content was also observed upon chemotherapy treatment (Additional file 1). To investigate the effect of time on RNA disruption, A2780 cells were treated with 0.005 or 0.2 μM paclitaxel or docetaxel for 24 to 72 h ( Fig. 1a and c) . RNA disruption became detectable at 24 h but continued to increase up to 72 h. RDI values confirmed a significant increase in RNA disruption for both paclitaxel-and docetaxel-treated samples over time ( Fig. 1b  and d) . The untreated (0 μM) control sample did not exhibit abnormal bands on electropherograms and retained a low RDI value at all time points. The CaOV3 ovarian carcinoma cell line was also treated with docetaxel to determine if other ovarian cancer cell lines could exhibit taxane-induced RNA disruption. Using the same docetaxel doses as for A2780 cells, RNA disruption was observed in CaOV3 cells
