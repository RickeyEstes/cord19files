The question on childhood immunisation was intended to be broad and to lead participants to debate the extent to which they felt that parents should be free to decide the immunisation status of their children or the State should intervene. The central theme emerging from the focus groups in several countries was the concept of risk discussed in terms of both private interest -'could immunisation harm my child?' -and public interest--'could non-immunisation harm other people?' The question of parental choice versus State compulsion was often a secondary concern. This research found no clear correlations between attitudes to immunisation or compulsory immunisation and gender, age, marital status or educational level. Focus group participants with children were slightly more likely to discuss immunisation and to hold stronger views (in any direction) on immunisation. This is likely to reflect their direct experience of thinking about vaccinating their own children. The main differences in attitudes expressed in the focus groups were found at country level. Participants in countries where immunisation is compulsory were more supportive of State compulsion than those where immunisation is voluntary, and participants were more likely to discuss issues around vaccine safety in those countries where vaccine safety had been a recent issue.
