Clinical appearance of TMEV-associated demyelination coincides with the appearance of MBP in the CSF, and serum antibody directed against both TMEV and MBP (Table 1, Fig. 1) Antibodies directed against the virus (Ab[TMEV]) and against MBP (Ab[MBP]) appear in the sera of infected mice (Table 1 ) between 1 and 12 weeks after i.c. injection of TMEV. The incidence at 12 weeks coincides with the mean onset of clinical signs of TMEV-associated demyelination and the presence of MBP in the CSF of these animals. Of the 80 samples assayed, 42/80 (52%) were considered positive for MBP (0.069 ng/~l, the mean of the controls plus 2 SD). The average amount of MBP in the CSF of all TMEV-infected mice assayed was 0.144 + 0.16. This value is higher than the mean for uninfected mice, 0.025 +_ 0.022. This mean is for animals autopsied at least 2 months post-infection. The mean value of MBP in CSF of mice exhibiting severe clinical signs (RR ++, RR +++) at autopsy is 0.178 _+ 0.216, with 12/19 (63%) of the specimens in the positive range (Fig. 1, shaded squares) . The mean value for TMEV-infected mice with minimal clinical signs (RR +) at autopsy is 0.138 +_ 0.134, with 9/18 (50%) in the positive range. TMEV-infected mice which were asymptomatic and autopsied 2 months post-infection had a mean value of MBP in the CSF of 0.13 _+ 0.14, with 22/43 (51.2%) of the specimens in the positive range.
