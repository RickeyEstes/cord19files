We previously performed a nationwide serosurvey for MERS-CoV in Kenyan camels using an in-house MERS-CoV RBD IgG ELISA, plus a confirmatory VNT [14] . A correlation in results obtained using the two methods was observed whereby almost all ELISA positive sera were capable of neutralizing MERS-CoV (103/105, 98.1%). Our data revealed 584 of 891 (65.54%) Kenyan camel samples had MERS-CoV RBD antibodies (Figure 1(A) ). We then tested all camel sera using a MERS-CoV NP-based ELISA. In contrast, only 54 of 891 samples (6.04%), or 48 of the RBD positive samples (8.22%) were NP positive ( Figure  1(A) ). To confirm the finding, we developed an additional antibody assay based on mammalian expressed MERS-CoV NP using LIPS, a fast and sensitive serological tool which has previously been successfully used in SADS-CoV serosurvey [18, 19] . All NP ELISA positive sera were also positive in LIPS, while those negative samples remained negative (Figure 1(B) ). This observation was confirmed by a MERS-CoV virus-based Western blot using RBD positive samples. Two major structural proteins, NP and membrane protein were observed in the NP positive group, but not in the NP negative group (Figure 1 (C) and supplementary Figure 1(A) ). Above all, only a small proportion of the MERS-CoV RBD positive serum samples were also NP positive, different to that observed in human infection cases [6, 22] . This observation indicated that the majority of the camels may only maintain NP antibodies for a short time or be co-infected by another CoV. In searching for possible new genotype of MERS viruses that share the same or a related S but a different NP, we performed a CoV NP protein array serology test. Selected MERS-CoV RBD positive samples were analysed by Western blot using NP proteins from representative alpha and beta CoVs (see method section). The successful expression of these proteins was confirmed by anti-tag antibodies (Figure 2(A) ). No other CoV besides HKU8r-CoV (China strain) NP was detected in two out of three selected MERS-CoV NP negative camel serum samples (Figure 2 (A) and Supplementary  Figure 1(B) ). In particular, HKU8r-CoV NP antibody was not cross-reactive with 229E-related CoV, which is also known to be enzootic in camels (Figure 2(A) ). HKU8r-CoV has previously been found only in Miniopterus bats in China or Kenya [23] [24] [25] . To further investigate the results observed in the Western blot, HKU8r-CoV NP and S1 based LIPS assays were developed. The LIPS results demonstrated clear HKU8r-CoV NP positive in some camel sera, consistent with Western blot results (Figure 2(B) ). However, no HKU8r-CoV S1 positives were found within the HKU8r-CoV NP positive samples ( Figure  2(B) ). To rule out the possible false-negative results using China HKU8r-CoV as detection antigen, a Kenyan bat HKU8r-CoV BtKY33 was also used. Results indicated that the above conclusion was not HKU8r-CoV strain-specific (Supplementary Figure  2) . The data indicates that some of the Kenyan camels have both MERS-CoV S and HKU8r-CoV NP antibodies. We then performed a nationwide serosurvey for HKU8r-CoV in camels using a HKU8r-CoV NP and S1 ELISA. Of the 584 MERS-CoV RBD positive samples tested, 73 (12.5%) were positive for HKU8r-CoV NP (Figure 2(C) ). In contrast, only 3 (0.51%) were seropositive for HKU8r-CoV S1 (Figure 2(C) ). The data suggested the idea of the co-infection of MERS/HKU8r-CoVs, alternatively, we can't rule out the existence of a chimeric MERS-CoV carrying MERS-CoV S gene but a NP gene from HKU8r-CoV in Kenyan camels (Figure 3 and Supplementary  Table 1 ). Although, we cannot rule the possibility of a novel CoV that was not detected in molecular assays but can cross-react with HKU8r or MERS coronavirus positive serum samples. It is worth to mention, another camel alphacoronaviruses, 229E-like coronaviruses were previously found in camels [26] . We then tested cross-reactivity of antibodies to the N proteins of HKU8r and 229E as the two are closely related phylogenetically. Our data demonstrated only 10/90 of the HKU8r-CoV NP positive camel serum were also 229E-NP positive (Supplementary Figure 3 (A)), which was probably true positive for the later as NP of the two viruses showed no cross-reactivity using positive control samples (Supplementary Figure  3(B) ). We then investigated factors that may associate with MERS-CoV (positive for both S and NP) seropositivity and distribution, which may also be important for the detection of this MERS/HKU8r-CoV co-infection cases. Distribution of MERS-CoV sero-positive samples was not found to be associated with sex, age, birthplace, migration or pregnancy of camels but may be associated with the breed (P = .003) (Supplementary Table 2 ). We also screened nucleic acid by RT-PCR targeting the conserved regions of all known coronaviruses on 1422 camel nasal swabs collected from Kenya 2016-2018. In addition, 12 pooled camel nasal swabs (10 samples for each pool) RNA were also tested in nextgeneration sequencing (NGS). We found MERS-CoV , and rabbit antiserum against HKU8r-CoV S1 protein was used as positive control (red dot). Cutoff was determined as the sum of mean value plus three times the standard deviations of the negative samples.
