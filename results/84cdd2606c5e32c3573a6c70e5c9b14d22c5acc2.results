A total of 197,207 HFMD cases were notified to the Ministry of Health, Singapore, from 2003 to 2012. Table 1 shows the demographics of all notified cases. Children aged less than 12 years accounted for about 90% of all HFMD cases, and about 70% of all children with HFMD were aged 5 years and younger; 57% of the cases were male, whereas 74% were ethnic Chinese, 15% Malay, 3% Indian, and 8% others: the Indian ethnic group is substantially underrepresented among cases compared with the general population (11% of Singapore residents aged less than 12 years have Indian ethnicity). Table 2 shows the summary statistics for the Bayesian models for the public holiday effect: the average of 50 HFMD cases a day was reduced by 53% (95% confidence interval [CI]: [44%, 62%]) in the 1 week following a public holiday, but only by 34% (95% CI: [25%, 43%)]) in the second week, whereas there was no reduction in the third week (0%, 95% CI: [âˆ’10%, 9%]). Alternative forms of non-informative prior distribution did not affect the results (not shown). During school vacations, weekly number of cases were modeled to be reduced to 93% ( Figure 1 shows the simulations for a typical year based on the modeled effects of school vacations on HFMD transmission, using typical timing of school holidays. Both overall analysis and separate models for different age groups showed similar results and are consistent with the patterns of the data for the 10-year period. The temporally structured distribution of residuals in the 1-week-ahead model forecasts is shown in Supplemental Figure 1 . No trends were observed, suggesting that the model with a constant b is adequate. From 2011 to 2016, there were totally 10,080 school-level outbreaks involving a total of 57,502 HFMD cases in childcare centers and kindergartens, of which 105 led to closure (Table 3 ). In all, 9,903 outbreaks including 100 closures were included in our model: 177 schools without accurate enrolment sizes were removed and four schools with closure falling beyond 50 days after the first day of outbreak were categorized as no closure (detailed in Supplemental File 1) . The Bayesian Poisson model shows that the expected number of new cases decreases to 26% (95% CI: 21-32%) if a school was closed on that day compared with a normal school day, after adjusting for size and duration of the outbreak. One-dayahead predictions based on the previous day's observed number of cases, shown in Figure 2 for arbitrarily selected outbreaks (more outbreaks are presented in Supplemental File 2), both with and without short-term school closure, demonstrate that the fitted model adequately captures the observed outbreak patterns. Figure 3 show the effect of school closure by showing the cumulative number of cases if there were no school closure for four arbitrarily selected outbreaks with closure (more outbreaks are presented in Supplemental File 3). The percentage of cases avoided from school closure for all closures is shown in Figure 4 . The majority of school closure events (> 80%) were associated with a less than 5% difference between observed and modeled cases, regardless of outbreak size at closure. Closures that prevented more than 10% of total school size were generally in bigger schools (of size more than 200). Overall, the modeled number of infections prevented through the school closure policy from 2011 to 2016 was 1,204 (95% CI: [1, 140, 1, 297] ), that is, an average 2% reduction compared with the total number of cases during that period. Convergence of all Bayesian models used was achieved according to the Gelman diagnostic test. Model validity assessed by comparing posterior predictions or simulations
