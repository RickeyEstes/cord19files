Phenotypic characterization of freshly isolated type II AEC compared to the A549 cell line Type II AEC isolated from human lung cultured until confluence were stained with phenotypic markers and compared to the A549 cell line, often used as a model of human AECII. The cells were stained with anti-human antibodies to HLA-DR, as it is the most strongly expressed class II locus. Whereas a high proportion of freshly isolated AECII expressed at their surface HLA-DR molecules (median 75.44%, ranges: 68.73% -84.68%), only a minority of A549 cells did express this marker (11.40%, 0.03% -16.60%), resulting in significant differences in the expression of MHC class II molecules between the two types of cell suspensions (P < 0.01) ( Figure 1 ). Analysis of the expression of the co-stimulatory molecules from the B7 family indicated that few cells of both suspensions express these markers. The study of the fresh AECII showed almost no expression of CD80 (7.22%, 4.26% -10.14%), a low expression of CD86 Figure 1 Phenotypic characterization by flow cytometry of A549 cells compared to freshly-isolated AECII in resting conditions. A549 cell line and fresh isolated AECII were cultured until confluence and stained with the indicated surface antibodies for phenotypic analysis by flow cytometry. Each experimental condition (seven for A549 cell line and five for AECII) was performed in triplicate, the mean value being represented by a dot. Medians are represented as horizontal bars. A value of P <0.05 was considered to be significant. ** P < 0.01. (28.93%, 11.74% -44.13%) and of ICOS-L (14.82%, 8.32% -16.76%). Similar results were obtained for the cell line A549 (Figure 1 and data not shown for ICOS-L). The CD40 molecule was expressed only on a very low proportion of epithelial cells, respectively on 12.54% of the AECII (3.66% -14.41%) and on 7.37% of the A549 cells (2.75% -9.43%) (Figure 1) . In contrast, two other co-stimulatory molecules were expressed on the surface from most cells of both A549 cell line and fresh AECII. CD54 was expressed on nearly all the freshly isolated type II AEC (97.37%, 94.88% -99.55%) and on an important proportion of A549 cells (59.21%, 39.68% -71.21%), with however significant differences in the proportions of positive cells within the cell suspensions (P < 0.01) (Figure 1 ). Conversely, CD58 was expressed on nearly all the A549 cells (98.54%, 97.70% -98.89%) and on a lower percentage of freshly isolated cells (58.99%, 52.07% -73.23%) (P < 0.01 ) (Figure 1 ). These results indicate the constitutive surface expression of HLA-DR on freshly isolated AECII and the low expression of this molecule on the A549 cell line. The presence of alternative co-stimulatory molecules was highlighted for the two cell suspensions, as well as the very low or even absent expression of the B7 family molecules.
