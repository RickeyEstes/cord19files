70 individuals were diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection between Oct 23, 2012, and May 1, 2014. Baseline characteristics were generally similar between patients who received ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy and those who did not (table 1) , with the exception that end-stage renal failure was present in three patients who did not receive study treatment and in none who did. After excluding ineligible patients, 44 patients were included in the study: 20 in the treatment group and 24 in the comparator group (fi gure 1). The mean age of all 44 patients was 65·5 years (SD 18·2), and 32 (73%) were men (table 1) Mean absolute neutrophil count was signifi cantly lower in the treatment group than in the comparator group (table 1) ; however, no other statistically signifi cant differences in baseline characteristics or support measures were noted between the two groups (tables 1, 2). Of all 44 patients, 21 (48%) were still alive 14 days after diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection, whereas at 28 days only ten (23%) had survived. 14 (70%) of 20 patients in the treatment group were alive 14 days after diagnosis, compared with seven (29%) of 24 in the comparator group (p=0·004). However, six (30%) of 20 patients in the treatment group survived up to 28 days from diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection, whereas four (17%) of 24 did in the comparator group (p=0·054; fi gure 2). Ribavirin and pegylated interferon therapy was well tolerated by the treatment group with no premature discontinuation secondary to adverse eff ects. However, the mean drop in haemoglobin over the treatment course was signifi cantly greater in the treatment group (4·32 g/L [SD 2·47]) than in the comparator group
