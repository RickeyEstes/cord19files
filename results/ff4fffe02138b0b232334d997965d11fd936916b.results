We excluded 11 cases from the analysis due to inhibition of the PCR. Out of the remaining 2,219 pneumonia cases, Infection with more than one virus was identified in 29 (3.3%) of the 887 positive specimens. The most common double infection was PIV3 in combination with hMPV, which was found in nine cases. We identified three viruses in one case (PIV1, PIV2, RSV) and four viruses in another (PIV1, PIV2, InfB, RSV). The occurrence of CAP during the course of our study exhibited substantial temporal variation and a clear epidemic pattern (Figure 2 ). In each of the three years, we observed a sharp increase in the occurrence of pneumonia at the end of the monsoon season in August to September. There were also significant CAP epidemics during winter, the first year peaking in February and the second year in December, but we observed no winter epidemic in the third year. There were also smaller peaks of CAP in spring. Epidemics of infection with individual respiratory viruses contributed to literally all of these CAP epidemics, such as the three RSV epidemics (the second of which was compounded by epidemics with InfA and InfB infections), an InfA epidemic superimposed on an hMPV epidemic, and a PIV3 epidemic ( Figure 3 ). Displays of the spatial-temporal distribution of these individual epidemics are visualized in [24] . PIV1 infections occurred in small numbers throughout the year, whereas only 17 cases of PIV2 infection were seen during the entire study period. The monthly distribution of RSV infections and meteorological data are shown in Figure 4 . The monthly number of RSV infections was positively correlated with relative humidity in the Spearman's correlation analysis, but not with temperature or rainfall ( Table 3 ). The same association with relative humidity was seen for hMPV. In contrast, the number of PIV3 was positively associated with both temperature and rainfall, and not with relative humidity. InfA did not correlate with any of these meteorological factors, while InfB showed moderate negative correlation with all three factors.
