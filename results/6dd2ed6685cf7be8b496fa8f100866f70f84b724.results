All BIs (G. stearothermophilus) exposed to HPV were inactivated, while all control BIs had visible growth following overnight incubation. The results of virus inactivation are summarized in Table I . The log reductions in virus titres were calculated by comparing the HPV-exposed and control discs. All viruses were inactivated completely after HPV exposure in the 25-, 27-and 33-mL cycles. HPV was virucidal (>4-log reduction) against FCV, adenovirus, TGEV and AIV at the lowest vaporized volume of hydrogen peroxide tested (25 mL). For SwIV, due to low virus titre on the control discs, a >3.8-log reduction was shown for the 25-mL volume and >4-log reduction was shown for the 27-mL and 33-mL vaporized volumes. As no virus was detected on any of the HPV-exposed discs, it is not possible to comment on the relative susceptibility of the viruses.
