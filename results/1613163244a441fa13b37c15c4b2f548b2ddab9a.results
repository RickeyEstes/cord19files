In phase 1 pre-natal study, all the dams dosed with SSD-1 and SSD-2 had normal food intake and weight gain. The average gain in weight from GD0 to GD 20 was 100.35 ± 2.75 gms for controls while it was 103.46 ± 4.16 gms in SSD 1 and 105.36 ± 3.82 gms in SSD2. (Webtable 1). No test item related mortality or clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study. All dams in treatment groups and control group survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice. They showed normal behaviour until euthanized. There were no differences in mean maternal body weights, body weight gains, pregnancy rate, gestational index, pre-and post-implantation loss, and resorptions. No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio, foetal body weights. However, one dam from SSD-1 had all male foetuses. No abnormality was detected in skeletal and visceral examination. In phase 2, controls and SSD-1 and SSD-2 treated dams exhibited a comparable food intake (Table 1) . However, a dose response relationship was observed with reduced weight gain with higher doses of SSDs. (Table 2) . Two dams, one in G6 (SSD-2, 1000 mg/kg) and the other in G7 (SSD-2, 1500 mg/kg) categories showed decreased or consistent body weight GD12 onwards. On an average, the weight on GD 20 was 316.83 ± 3.61 gms in controls while it was 292.56 ± 2.58 with SSD1 (1500 mg/kg) and 291.81 ± 2.84 gms with SSD2 (1500 mg/kg). The adjusted analysis indicated that except in G5 there was a significant reduction in weight gain in all the intervention groups as compared to the control group after controlling for litter size (Table 3) . During follow up, one dam from SSD1 (500 mg/kg) and one from SSD2 (1500 mg/kg) showed haematuria during gestational day 11e14. However, no another clinical sign of toxicity was encountered during the study. All the dams in treatment and control groups showed normal behaviour and survived to scheduled terminal sacrifice. In phase 2, pregnancy rate and gestational index were found to be 100% at all dose levels with SSD1 whereas, in SSD-2, it decreased to 83.33% in G6 (SSD-2, 1000 mg/kg) and G7 (SSD-2, 1500 mg/kg) groups. One dam from G6 (SSD-2, 1000 mg/kg) and another one from G7 (SSD-2, 1500 mg/kg) group showed mating confirmation during vaginal smear examination and showed positive sign in initial days of pregnancy but during necropsy on expected day of delivery (GD 20) no foetus was found. Body weights of dams increased in the initial stages that became constant at a later period. To reconfirm it, non-gravid uterus was stained in salewski strain and presence of conceptus was found. This indicated the possibility of miscarriage. Increased pre-and post-implantation losses as well as resorptions and reduced live foetuses were observed with both SSD-1 Table 1 Average food consumption of dams when exposed to SSDs during Gestational Days (GD) 6e19 in different experimental groups (n ¼ 12 in each group) (in mean ± SE of means in gms). and SSD-2. No significant differences were observed in foetal sex ratio, but decreased foetal body weights were noted in both sexes.
