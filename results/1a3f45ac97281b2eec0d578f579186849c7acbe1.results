Here an intestine is simulated with an internal volume of 0.314 dm 3 and a total of 4.15 × 10 8 susceptible cells in the intestinal epithelium. In Fig. 1 , an oral challenge dose of 4.15 × 10 8 viruses is administered, and the fraction of these escaping the mucin barrier and reaching the epithelium is modelled. Fig. 3 shows the fraction of epithelium cells with bound virus as a function of K a for six doses of virus that have got through the mucin barrier ranging from 1000 virions to 4.15 × 10 11 virions. In Fig. 2 , the points from Fig. 3 are replotted in the form of a dose-response which relates the fraction of host cells with bound virus to the dose of virus that has got through the mucin barrier. These doseresponse relationships are presented for a range of K a values from 10 5 to 10 20 M −1 in Fig. 2 .
