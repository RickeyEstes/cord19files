Since we did not know and still don't know the values of Qj before February 12, 2020, we supposed that Vj = Wj and have done the calculations with the use of data for the time period from January 16 to February 9, 2020. The optimal values of the parameters are: The corresponding correlation coefficient is very high r = 0.997966487046645. The solution of (7) yields the value 45579. The corresponding number of infected I, susceptible S and removed R persons versus time (starting from January 16, 2020) were calculated and shown in Fig. 2 . The blue line represents the number of victims V = I + R and is in good agreement with "tested confirmed cases" Wj, reported by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China [1] (blue markers).
