Of the 79 herds initially sampled in the autumn of 2006, 73 remained in the study for the duration of the survey period and six dropped out as the farms ceased milk production. Two additional herds entered the study: 'Halland' in spring 2007 and 'JÃ¤mtland' in autumn 2007. For the Gotland region, samples during the autumn 2008 period were lost during transport. Fig. 2 illustrates the distribution of the selected herds and the herd densities in these areas. Median herd size at the start of the study was 45 for the 30-80 group and 110 for the >80 sized herds: there were no significant differences between the four regions as regards median herd size of these two categories of herd.
