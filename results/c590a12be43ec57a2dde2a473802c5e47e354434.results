identification of ALK r1275Q neoepitopes Using ProTecT A reduced version of our software, ProTECT (Figure 1) , was initially run on a batch of six primary:relapsed NBL sample pairs from the TARGET cohort. We find at least one neoepitope-gene rating mutation persisting in the relapsed tumor for five of six patients (Table S1 and Supplementary Data S1 in Supplementary Material). Among these are two well-known hotspot mutations, NRAS Q61K and ALK R1275Q (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). We predicted two HLA-B*15:01-restricted decamer (MAQDIYRASY and AQDIYRASYY) and one nonamer (AQDIYRASY) neoepitopes arising from ALK R1275Q in sample TARGET-30-PARHAM. The predicted binding affinities are better than 0.55, 0.85, and 2.1%, respectively, relative to all peptides in a background training set (the top 5% ranked peptides are considered true binders by our method). While the peptide beginning at M1273 is predicted to be the top binder, the two epitopes beginning at A1274 are more promising from an immunological perspective since they are predicted to be significantly better binders to HLA-B*15:01 than their parental self-antigens ARDIYRASYY (10.75 percentile score) and ARDIYRASY (35 percentile score). Input FASTQs trios per sample ultimately give rise to MHC haplotyping and provide a list of candidate neoepitopes for each sample. Abbreviations: TD and ND, tumor and normal DNA, respectively; TR, tumor RNA. Predicted tumor-normal single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) are filtered during peptide generation, and again at neoepitope prediction. nrange: the range of SNV calls that make it past a certain step; nmed: median number of calls. The primary:relapse pairs were run through a smaller modified version of the pipeline that started directly from mutations curated from Eleveld et al. (16) . Panels (B,c) show the TARGET neuroblastoma cohort OxoG mutation level. Before filtering for OxoG artifacts, we see a predominance of C>A/G>T mutants (B), whereas after filtering we see a marked reduction in the total number of mutations and a more balanced nucleotide substitution rate (c). 3 Toor et al. Structural Characterization of "Altered-Self" NBL Neoepitopes Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org January 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 99 Using the full version of the ProTECT software (manuscript in preparation), we expanded our study to 100 primary NBL samples in the TARGET cohort to collect more complete statistics on ALK R1275Q-derived neoepitopes, and to identify other recurrent neoepitopes in NBL (Table S1 and Supplementary Data S2 and S3 in Supplementary Material). We identify four additional samples harboring ALK R1275Q (TARGET-30-PANWRR, -PANXJL, -PAPTFZ, and -PAPTLV). None of these samples express HLA-B*15:01, but sample PAPTFZ displays a close relative, HLA-B*15:03 that is predicted to bind ARDIYRASYY and ARDIYRASY with scores of 2.2 and 4.7%, respectively. Two samples (PANXJL and PAPTLV) express the high-frequency HLA-A*02:01 (20% in Caucasian populations), where an ALK R1275Q nonamer (GMAQDIYRA) is predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01 with a 1.4% score. All but six of the 100 samples harbor one or more nonsynonymous neoepitope with low percentile scores for at least one expressed HLA allele. Among these we identify other recurrent mutations, including the ALK mutation F1174L/I/C, present in 3/2/1 samples, respectively, and a ZNF717 mutation (Q716), present in three samples (Table S1 in Supplementary Material). One sample in the cohort expresses NRAS Q61K, an activating mutation commonly found in melanoma, thyroid, and colorectal cancers. Finally, the NRAS-derived neoepitope ILDTAGKEEY arising from a single mutation (Q61K) is predicted to bind the common HLA-A*01:01 allele with a statistically significant score of 0.35%. Notably, the same HLA-A*01:01/ILDTAGKEEY interaction identified by our method has been previously shown to elicit a specific T cell response using a melanoma cell line (21) .
