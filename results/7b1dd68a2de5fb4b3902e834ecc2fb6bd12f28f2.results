Chloroquine reduces liver injury in the early reperfusion phase, but worsens liver injury during the late reperfusion phase after hepatic ischemic injury. To determine whether chloroquine treatment could affect liver I/R injury, chloroquine was administrated to rats 1 h before warm ischemia followed by a daily injection for up to 2 days. Liver warm I/R resulted in significant increase in serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). As shown in Figure 1a , following 60 min of warm ischemia, chloroquine treatment decreased I/R injury at 0.5 and 6 h as indicated by lower liver enzymes (Po0.05). However, the serum levels of ALT and AST were much higher following 24-and 48-h reperfusion when compared Figure 1 Chloroquine treatment prevented liver I/R injury at early phase, but worsened at late phase following I/R injury. Rats were pre-treated with either chloroquine (60 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline) 1 h before warm ischemia, followed by an additional chloroquine injections at 24 h after reperfusion. Following 60 min (a) or 90 min (b) of warm ischemia, liver injury was assessed at various time points following reperfusion by determination of serum AST and ALT levels. Data are shown as mean ± S.D. *Po0.05 compared with vehicle-treated I/R group. (c) Routine histopathology was performed on formalin-fixed liver sections obtained from rats that had undergone 60 min of ischemia followed by 6-and 24-h reperfusion, respectively (original magnification Â 400). Representative images from six rats per group were selected with vehicle-injected rats (Po0.05). To further confirm the dual effects of chloroquine on liver I/R injury, additional rats were subjected to 90 min of warm I/R. Chloroquine treatment caused a similar dual effect in terms of liver injury when rats were subjected to prolonged warm ischemic insult ( Figure 1b ). Liver histology confirmed the findings regarding liver injury described above. Moderate hepatocellular necrosis, cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes and sinusoidal dilation were observed 6 h after reperfusion in vehicle-treated rats. In contrast, minor hepatocellular necrosis and slight sinusoidal dilation were observed in chloroquine treatment group. However, chloroquine-treated rats showed more severe cytoplasmic vacuolization and hepatocellular necrosis 24 h after reperfusion when compared with vehicle-treated rats ( Figure 1c ; Table 1 ). Chloroquine treatment decreases hepatic inflammatory cytokines gene expression. The expression of hepatic mRNA for TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were measured by quantitative PCR. As shown in Figure 2 , following 60-min warm ischemia, hepatic TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and iNOS expression levels were increased at 0.5 and 6 h in both vehicle treatment group and chloroquine treatment group when compared with shamoperated controls. However, chloroquine-treated rats exhibited minimal increases in hepatic TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and iNOS mRNA levels compared with vehicle-injected animals, accounting for about a 5-, 20-, 10-and 5-fold decrease at 6 h of reperfusion, respectively. Chloroquine treatment decreases HMGB1 release at early phase. HMGB1 is a cytokine, which is released during hepatic ischemia and in the early reperfusion phase. 8, 9 As shown in Figure 3a , nuclear HMGB1 staining in hepatocytes was substantial loss in vehicle-injected control rats as early as 0.5 h after reperfusion, In contrast, pre-treatment with chloroquine largely prevents this loss of nuclear HMGB1 staining. To assess the extracellular release of HMGB1 after warm liver I/R injury, serum HMGB1 concentration was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As shown in Figure 3b , warm I/R injury caused HMGB1 release in both vehicle-treated rats and chloroquinetreated rats. Serum levels of HMGB1 were highest at 0.5 h after reperfusion (7.78±2.62 ng/ml), and gradually decreased thereafter (6 h: 2.03 ± 0.56 versus normal control: 0.68 ± 0.32ng/ml, Po0.05). In contrast, chloroquine-treated rats showed lower serum HMGB1 levels when compared with vehicle-treated rats. The serum levels of HMGB1 were drastically decreased following reperfusion, to 1.40±0.41, 1.28 ± 0.45 ng/ml at 0.5 and 6 h, respectively (Po0.01). Chloroquine treatment modulates liver I/R-induced inflammatory signaling pathways. Among the most proximal events in I/R is the activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. 25 To determine if chloroquine pre-treatment influenced MAP kinase activation, we assessed phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38. As shown in Figure 4 , after I/R, phosphorylation p38 and JNK was increased in vehicle-treated rats. In contrast, phosphorlation of JNK was decreased, whereas phosphorylation of p38 was increased in chloroquine-injected rats. Phosphorylation of ERK was increased at 0.5 h, decreased at 6 h and then recovered thereafter. This dephosphorylation was partially prevented by chloroquine treatment. Treatment with chloroquine did not affect total cellular levels of JNK, p38 and ERK. These data suggest that chloroquine could act upstream of MAP kinase activation. Chloroquine treatment decreases autophagy. Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular process that recycles damaged and or long-lived proteins and organelles. 23, 24 Growing evidences showed that chloroquine decreased autophagy in a number of cell types. 26 To determine whether chloroquine could inhibit hepatic autophagy following I/R, western blots were performed for microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and p62 on livers obtained from rats pre-treated with either chloroquine or vehicle. As shown in Figure 5 , shamoperated rats had low levels of LC3-II. Following 60 min of warm ischemia, LC3-II protein was increased at 6 h after reperfusion, but decreased p62 expression. In contrast, chloroquine treatment increased significantly LC3-II and p62 expression in response to liver I/R. These data indicated chloroquine inhibited hepatic post-ischemic autophagy.
