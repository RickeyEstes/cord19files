Coiled-coil-like regions are detected using Learn-Coil-VMF in many viral membrane-fusion proteins, including many retrovirus envelope proteins, paramyxovirus fusion proteins, orthomyxovirus hemagglutinins, coronavirus spike proteins, arenavirus glycoproteins, and baculovirus envelope glycoproteins. (See Methods for a description of the LearnCoil-VMF algorithm.) Here, we focus on the membrane-fusion proteins of retroviruses, paramyxoviruses and Â®loviruses. Protein sequences from any virus family may be submitted at the LearnCoil-VMF webpage.
