In all, 144 of 1316 samples (11%) were positive for HBoV1. Fewer HBoV1-positive samples were found in the summer months, but the difference was not significant when adjusted for the number of samples received each month (Fig. 1 ). In total, 63% of the children were boys (61% in the patient group and 75% in the control group). The mean age of the HBoV1-positive patients was 19 months (SD: 10.6 months) and of the controls, 33 months (SD: 14.2 months) (p < 0.001). One-hundred and seventeen of 1154 samples (10%) from children with RTI were positive for HBoV1. Of these, 40 (37%) had URTI and 68 (63%) LRTI (of which 49% had bronchiolitis and 14% pneumonia). Of the 162 controls, 27 (17%) were positive for HBoV1. In a multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, gender and the presence of other respiratory viruses, we found no association between a positive HBoV1-PCR test in NPA and RTI (OR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.5-1.3, p = 0.30). Among the 144 HBoV1-positive NPA samples, HBoV1 was detected alone in 25% (36 of 144). Twenty-nine percent (34 of 117) of the patient samples were positive for HBoV1 alone and 7% (2 of 27) of the controls (p = 0.02). One additional virus was found in 46%, two in 18%, three in 10% and four in 1% (n = 144). Rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus and RSV were the most commonly co-detected viruses (Table 1) . A logistic regression analysis on the HBoV1-positive samples, adjusted for age and gender, showed that detection of HBoV1 alone was associated with RTI (OR: 5.2, 95% CI: 1.1-24.4, p = 0.04) but not LRTI (OR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.2-1.4 p = 0.20). A high viral load (>10 6 copies ml -1 ) in the NPA was found in 33% (39 of 117) of patients and 15% (4 of 27) of controls. However, when we adjusted for age, gender and presence of other viruses, a high viral load was not associated with RTI (OR: 1.4, 95% CI: 0.4-5.1, p = 0.57). A very high viral load (>2 × 10 8 copies ml -1 ), though, was clearly associated with RTI, as no controls and 14 patient samples had a copy number higher than this. LRTI was found in 82% (28 of 34) of the patients with a high viral load (>10 6 copies ml -1 ) and in 54% (40 of 74) of patients with moderate or low viral load. (Nine children with complex clinical conditions were excluded from this analysis.) Adjusted for age, gender and other viruses, a high viral load was associated with LRTI (OR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.2-10.7, p = 0.02). HBoV1-viraemia was found in 45% of patients with available samples (18 of 40) and in none of the controls (0 of 20). Viraemia was almost exclusively detected in patients younger than 2 years (16 of 18). More children with LRTI (57%, 16 of 28) than URTI (20%, 2 of 10) had viraemia (p = 0.04). (Two children with complex clinical conditions were excluded from this analysis.) Furthermore, viraemia was present more frequently in patients with a high viral load in NPA (70%, 14 of 20) compared to patients with a moderate or low viral load (10%, 4 of 40) (p < 0.001). Thirty-three percent (6 of 18) of the patients with viraemia had HBoV1 alone in the NPA, compared to 10% (4 of 42) of the patients without viraemia (p = 0.052, Fisher's exact test). Rhinovirus (33%, 6 of 18) was the most commonly co-detected virus among the viraemic patients. Electron microscopy examination of blood from a boy of 18 months with bronchiolitis, HBoV1 alone and a high HBoV1-load in NPA and blood, showed viral particles with size ∼25 nm, compatible with human bocavirus (Fig. 2) . Adenovirus and enterovirus were more frequent in the HBoV1positive NPA samples than the negative ones ( Table 2 ). In contrast, two other commonly detected viruses, rhinovirus and RSV, were as When bacteria were considered in addition to viruses, multiple detection was made in 85% of the HBoV1-positive NPA samples. One patient had M. pneumoniae. S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catharralis were present in 26%, 19% and 27% of the HBoV1-positive samples, respectively. There were no differences in the distribution Table 2 The four viruses most commonly co-detected with HBoV1 distributed by study group and whether HBoV1 was present (n = 144) or not (n = 1172). of bacteria among the HBoV1-positive and negative samples, or between patients and controls (data not shown).
