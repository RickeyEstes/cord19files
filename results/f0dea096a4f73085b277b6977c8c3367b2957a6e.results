From March 9, 2003, 90 patients were admitted to the hospital with probable SARS, of whom 87 patients (96.7%) had positive serology findings for SARS-associated coronavirus. NIPPV was used in 23 episodes for 22 patients. Three episodes were excluded from analysis because NIPPV was used for treatment of acute pulmonary edema (two episodes) and for weaning after extubation (one episode). Of the remaining 20 episodes in the 20 recruited patients (11 men), the mean age was 51.4 Ϯ 14.2 years. Seven patients had underlying comorbidities singly or in combination: diabetes mellitus (n ϭ 5), hypertension (n ϭ 3), and ischemic heart disease (n ϭ 1). Nineteen patients (95%) had fourfold or greater rises in antibody titer to the SARS-associated coronavirus. Demographic, physiologic, and blood test results for these 20 patients on hospital admission are shown in Table 1 . The timing of starting ribavirin and steroid, pulsed methylprednisolone, and NIPPV treatment were 7.2 Ϯ 8.3 days, 8.7 Ϯ 2.4 days, and 9.6 Ϯ 4.0 days, respectively, from symptom onset. Average respiratory rate before NIPPV was 28.9 Ϯ 6.2 breaths/min with supplemental oxygen of 8.0 Ϯ 3.1 L/min to maintain an oxygen saturation of 93.1 Ϯ 5.0%. Because of the sudden onset and rapid rate of respiratory deterioration in many patients, pre-NIPPV arterial blood gas results were available in only nine patients, with average Pao 2 /fraction of inspired oxygen being 18.3 Ϯ 6.9 kPa (137.5 Ϯ 51.6 mm Hg) and Paco 2 of 4.5 Ϯ 0.62 kPa (33.9 Ϯ 4.6 mm Hg). Intubation was avoided in 14 patients. NIPPV was not successful in six patients, and they required endotracheal intubation. CXR scores before NIPPV were 16.4 Ϯ 6.7 and 21.5 Ϯ 4.3, respectively (p ϭ 0.153), in the success and failure groups. The mean CXR score within 1 day after NIPPV was significantly higher for the failure group (22.5 Ϯ 3.3 vs 15.1 Ϯ 6.0, p ϭ 0.005). All patients received at least one course of pulsed methylprednisolone (2 g), with two courses being administered to three patients in whom NIPPV failed. Success was predicted by a marked and statistically significant reduction in respiratory rate and supplemental oxygen requirement within 24 h and at the end of NIPPV (Fig 1) . Overall mean duration of NIPPV usage was 84.3 Ϯ 47.0 h, and mean durations of ICU and hospital stay were 8.6 Ϯ 14.0 days and 33.7 Ϯ 13.5 days, respectively. Analyses of clinical outcome and laboratory results between the success and failure groups are shown in Table 2 . ICU stay for the success group was significantly shorter than the failure group (3.1 Ϯ 2.1 days vs 21.3 Ϯ 21.2 days, p Ͻ 0.001). Two elderly patients (aged 66 years and 72 years) with comorbidities (diabetes mellitus and hypertension) could be totally weaned from NIPPV, but later had fatal acute myocardial infarction and acute ischemic stroke, respectively. A third fatality occurred in another elderly (aged 74 years) with ventilator-associated pneumonia. NIPPV was complicated in four patients by pneumothorax (n ϭ 1), pneumomediastinum (n ϭ 1), nosocomial pneumonia (n ϭ 1), and pneumomediastinum plus nosocomial pneumonia (n ϭ 1). All recovered without major consequences. The overall incidence of nosocomial pneumonia was 2 of 20 patients (10%) during NIPPV usage, while the nosocomial pneumonia rate for the intubated group was 2 of 6 patients (33.3%) during mechanical ventilation.
