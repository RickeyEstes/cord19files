Within the study period, 54,078 patients visited our ED. Of 5,628 febrile adults, 214 (3.8%) had an elevated CRP level and normal WBC count. The age of these patients ranged from 20 to 97 years. The characteristics of these patients are shown in Table 1 . There were 32 patients with malignant neoplasm, nine with liver cirrhosis, 66 with diabetes mellitus and 11 with uremia. The major cause of febrility was infection (82.24%). Pneumonia and urinary tract infection were the leading diagnoses of infection ( Table 2) . Most of the patients *Data presented as mean Â± standard deviation or n (%). were admitted (92.99%). There were no significant differences in age and gender between patients with and those without neoplasm (Table 3 ). However, a higher inhospital mortality rate and other causes of febrility were noted in patients with neoplasm.
