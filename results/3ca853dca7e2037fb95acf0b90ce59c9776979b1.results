The results of the univariate logistic regression analyses with time (before and after journey: T0 and T1, respectively) as a fixed factor are presented in Table 2 . Higher odds of BCoV, BRSV. M. haemolytica M. bovis, and P. multocida were found in DNS collected four days after arrival (T1) compared with DNS collected before departure (T0). There was no difference in the prevalence of BAdV, BPiV, H. somni in the DNS collected at T0 and T1 (p > 0.05). The DNS collected from the two steers reared at the arriving farm in southern Italy during the period from February to April, resulted positive only for BCoV.
