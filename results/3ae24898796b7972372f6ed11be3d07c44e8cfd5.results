In order to be able to compare the data generated on the airborne survival of the various types of viruses tested, it was essential to keep the variations in materials and techniques to a minimum. In view of this, during the initial stages of this study, a number of materials and techniques were tested for their suitability in working with all the viruses selected here. Since fluorescent dyes were considered for use as physical tracers, it was considered essential to determine that their presence in the spray fluid would not be deleterious to the infectivity of the viruses and their quantitation. A great deal of froth was generated when TPB was used as the virus spray and aerosol collection fluid. It was, therefore, necessary to suppress this frothing by the use of an antifoam which would not inactivate the viruses or in some way interfere with virus plaque assay. A known amount of rotavirus SA-I 1. which was the virus used in the initial phases of this study, was suspended in TPB with and without the dyes and the antifoams. The suspensions were held at room temperature for 30 min before being plaque assayed. The results of these tests are presented in Table 1 . Khodamine B and Antifoam C, alone or in combination with each other, reduced the virus plaque titer by at least 4-fold. On the other hand, neither uranine nor Antofoam A. separately or as a mixture, were found to affect the infectivity of the virus. Subsequent tests showed ( Table 2 ) that uranine and Antifoam A were equally harmless to the infectivity of the corona-, polio-, rhino-and other rotaviruses used in this study. In view of this, these two substances were routinely added to the virus spray fluid. Antifoam A was also regularly incorporated in the aerosol collection fluid.
