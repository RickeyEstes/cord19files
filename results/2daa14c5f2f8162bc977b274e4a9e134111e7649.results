From Jan 1, 2004, to Dec 31, 2016, 502 723 cases of scarlet fever were reported, resulting in an annualised average incidence of 2·8807 per 100 000 people (table). In 2004, when national surveillance started, the average incidence of scarlet fever in the 31 provinces and areas monitored was 1·457 per 100 000 people and the first upsurge in cases occurred in 2011, with a significantly higher incidence of 4·7638 per 100 000 people (IRR 3·27, 95% CI 3·22-3·32; p<0·0001; figure 1A ). After the upsurge in 2011, the annual incidence of scarlet fever remained higher than average (calculated across the whole period 2004-16), except for in 2013 (figure 1A). The highest incidence of scarlet fever was observed in 2015 (5·0092 per 100 000 people), which then decreased slightly in 2016 (4·3247 per 100 000 people; figure 1A ). In the period after the upsurge of the disease, 2011-16, the average incidence per year was twice that of the period 2004-10 (4·0125 vs 1·9105 per 100 000 people; IRR 2·07, 95% CI 2·06-2·09; p<0·0001 ; table) . Nationally, people became infected with scarlet fever throughout the year, with semi-annual seasonal peaks (figure 1B). The first seasonal pattern started in February, at the time when the spring semester began in schools. The number of cases then peaked in May and June, and decreased in July and August. The second seasonal pattern was observed beginning in early September, when the autumn semester in schools started. Disease activity then increased to a second peak in November and December. The incidence of scarlet fever clearly decreased during the school holidays in spring (January-February) and summer (July-August; figure 1C ). We divided the 31 provinces into seven geographical areas to identify the different seasonal patterns by use of radar charts (appendix pp 6-12). In northern China, the two periods in which the incidence of scarlet fever clearly increased were November-December and May-June. In central and eastern China, two clear peaks in incidence still existed, but the peak in winter was slightly later in the year, in December-January. In southwest China, there was only one increase in the incidence, in the period of May-June. And in south China, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces had a clearer two-peak pattern during 2014-16 than did southwest China. Hainan province, also in south China, had few cases of scarlet fever, and subsequently the seasonality of the disease was not clear. We used a heat map to show time series of cases standardised by the proportion of annual cases. The seasonal pattern in the heat map was similar to that in the radar chart (appendix p 13). For the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics see http:// data.stats.gov.cn/english/ Seasonal trends were similar in the periods before and after the upsurge of scarlet fever incidence. However, the incidence was much higher in the spring than in the winter in 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2009 . The magnitude of seasonal rises were similar after the upsurge. During the periods both before and after the upsurge, the highest incidence of the year was seen in January, while the smallest increase in IRR was seen in April compared with all other months (appendix p 14). Looking at the geographical distribution of scarlet fever across China in 2004-16, cases were predominantly reported in the north, northeast, and northwest of the country. In the ring map (figure 2A), the northern areas from the Jilin province to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (in a counter-clockwise direction) had a pattern of steadily increasing scarlet fever incidence from the innermost ring in 2004 to the outermost ring in 2016 (apart from the expected peaks for 2011 and 2015, and in the Henan province where the annual incidence remained steady at 0·01-3·25). Across the whole study period, the provinces with a latitude higher than 33·4 degrees north had a higher annual incidence than those at lower latitudes. The provinces or areas with the highest average annual incidence between 2004 and 2016 were Beijing (14·0412 per 100 000 people), Liaoning province (9·7239 per 100 000 people), and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (9·5393 per 100 000 people; table). By contrast, the provinces and areas in the south and
