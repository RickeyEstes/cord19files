The second luminal domain of the Russell's viper NPC1 ortholog binds poorly to the Ebola virus glycoprotein. We postulated that EBOV fails to enter and infect Russell's viper VH-2 cells because the EBOV entry glycoprotein, GP, cannot recognize the viper ortholog of the filovirus intracellular receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (Daboia russellii NPC1 [DrNPC1]). We previously showed that the second luminal domain (C) of human NPC1 (Homo sapiens NPC1 [HsNPC1]) directly contacts a cleaved form of EBOV GP (GP CL ) and that GP CL -HsNPC1 domain C binding is essential for filovirus entry (22, 23) . Accordingly, we investigated the capacity of DrNPC1 domain C to bind to GP CL and support EBOV entry and infection. We first used reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to isolate and sequence DrNPC1 domain C. Alignment of domain C amino acid sequences from HsNPC1 and DrNPC1 revealed a substantial degree of conservation (80% amino acid identity), with identical arrangements of cysteine residues and similar predicted secondary structures, suggesting a similar overall fold for the two proteins ( Fig. 1) . To facilitate in vitro GP CL -NPC1-binding studies, we engineered a soluble form of DrNPC1 domain C, as previously described for HsNPC1 (22) . Transfection of HEK 293T cells with this construct afforded the secretion of an extensively N-glycosylated form of DrNPC1 domain C ( Fig. 2A) . As shown previously, purified HsNPC1 domain C could bind to recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana particles bearing cleaved EBOV GP (rVSV-GP CL ), as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (22) ; in contrast, DrNPC1 domain C exhibited no binding by ELISA, even at the highest concentration tested (Fig. 2B) . Therefore, DrNPC1 domain C, in contrast to its human counterpart, recognizes the EBOV glycoprotein poorly or not at all.
