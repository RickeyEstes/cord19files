Two hundred and sixty patients were enrolled in the study. Characteristics of the patients recruited are presented in Table 1 . In the whole sample there were more boys than girls, almost half of children were younger than six months, 24% of all children were born premature, 29% had been exposed to tobacco during gestation, and more than a half had a family history of asthma (parents or siblings). Overall, median hospital length was 6 days and median supplemental oxygen requirement was 5 days. The presence of viruses was detected by PCR in 222 (85%) of all LRTI episodes. Co-detection was present in 146/260 (56%). The frequencies of viral detection and co-detection are shown in Table 2 . The most common single infection was related to RSV (54%), followed by hMPV (32%), and HRV (21%). During the surveyed time RSV has shown an incidence peak in the beginning of the cold season (i.e. from april to November) in the southern hemisphere, followed in late winter by peaks of hMPV, HRV, and HBov ( Figure 1 ). Other viruses such as HPIV and Human Adenovirus (HAdv) showed low but constant rates throughout the season. In the univariate analyses, length of hospital stay and need of supplemental oxygen were significantly associated with age (≤6 months), maternal smoking during pregnancy and with family history of asthma (parents and/or siblings) ( Table 3 ). Infants younger than 6 months of age stayed in hospital 3.8 days longer than older infants (p < 0.001), and those with a family history of asthma stayed 2.4 days longer than those without a family history of asthma (p < 001). Also, infants 6 months of age or younger needed supplemental oxygen for an extra 3.8 days, when compared to older infants/children. A similar finding was observed for children with a family history of asthma, who required 2.4 extra days of oxygen compared to those without the family history of asthma (Table 3) . Other risk factors, such as breastfeeding, indoor smoking, current parental smoking, siblings, and overcrowding were not significantly associated with neither of the main outcomes. Infants with positive PCR for HRV alone as well as those co-detected with RSV and HRV also had significantly longer hospital stays (3.2 days, p = 0.001; and 5.5 days, p = 0.002, respectively) than those with other detected viruses. Extended time in use of supplemental oxygen was also associated with HRV (2.8 days, p = 0.002) and RSV (3.7 days, p = 0.013), but also with Influenza virus A or B (2.2 days, p = 0.042), when compared to those with other viruses in single or in co-detection. Infants with HRV-LRTIs stayed an extra 2.2 days in hospital (p = 0.011), for a total of 7.7 (95% CI: 6.1-9.3) days when compared to those with other infections, after adjusting for potential confounding variables (Table 4 ). Table 5 shows that infants with combined HRV and RSV positive PCR in the same samples stayed 4.5 extra days (p = 0.004) than those without HRV and RSV in these adjusted models (that included sex, age ≤ 6 versus >6 months, prematurity, family history of asthma and maternal smoking during pregnancy), (95% CI: 7.0-13.0) days. Time in use of supplemental oxygen followed the same association trends. Infants with proven RSV infections needed 4.75 (95% CI: 3.97-5.53) extra days of oxygen, while those with HRV used supplemental oxygen for 1.4 extra days, and those with RSV and HRV co-detection for 2.2 days, when compared to infants presenting positive PCRs for other viruses alone or in combinations. Figure 2 illustrates the association between HRV and RSV + HRV co-detection with increased length of hospital stay and oxygen use, and this effect is especially significant for infants younger than 6 months of age. Influenza viruses were not associated with longer use of supplemental oxygen when controlling for the demographic variables.
