During the year 2009, a total of 967,241 discharges from Catalonian hospitals were recorded, of which 18,548 (1.9%) had acute exacerbation of COPD as the main diagnosis. The average age of patients hospitalized for COPD was 74.5±11.4 years, with 77.3% being male and the average hospital stay being 7.1±6.6 days. Of these admissions, 9,804 (53.2%) were in Barcelona and its metropolitan area. The number of weekly hospitalizations ranged between 89 and 459, with an average of 188.5±80.2 and a median of 174. Again, these patients were predominantly male (75.4%) with a mean age of 74.9±10.5 years and an average stay of 6.5±6.1 days. Differences in sex, age, and length of stay between total COPD admissions in Catalonia and the study sample were statistically significant (all P0.001) but clinically irrelevant except for the average length of stay. The highest number of admissions occurred during the winter, with 3,689 (37.6%) hospitalizations, followed by autumn with 2,353 (24.0%), spring with 2,328 (23.7%), and summer with 1,434 (14.6%; P0.001, see Figure 1 ). The population and climate characteristics and their analysis grouped by seasonality are detailed in Table 1 . The observed mortality during hospitalization was 3.2%, being higher in the summer months (P=0.050). The most frequent comorbidities recorded were hypertension (43.6%), psychiatric disorders including anxiety and/or depression (42.0%), heart failure (32.8%), ischemic heart disease (28.3%), and diabetes mellitus (28.0%). The total number of comorbidities was lower during the winter months than in the rest of the year (P0.001), although no difference was seen in the Deyo-Charlson Index (Table 1) . The mean annual maximum temperature was 19.7°C± 6.6°C with a maximum of 34.5°C, while the mean of the minimum temperatures was 8.5°C±5.7°C with a minimum of 0.0°C. The values of the mean daily temperatures ranged between 3.8°C and 27°C, with a mean value of 13.7°C± 6.2°C and an interquartile range (25%-75%) between 9.6°C and 19.2°C. The maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures were closely and similarly related with the number of hospitalizations ( Figure 2 ). On average, in an unadjusted model we found that for each Celsius degree decrease in mean weekly temperature, hospital admissions increased by 5.04% (r 2 =0.591, P0.001, see Figures 3 and 4). Despite being located in the same geographic area, as with other densely populated cities, temperatures in Barcelona were slightly higher than in the metropolitan area (urban heat island effect), varying a few degrees depending on the location of the meteorological station. However, we did not find differences between the pattern of temperature and hospitalizations between Barcelona city and its metropolitan area (P=0.08, Figure 5 ). The percent humidity was also significantly associated with the number of hospital admissions (P=0.002), although this effect disappeared after adjustment in the multivariate model (P=0.723). During 2009, the new influenza virus A (H1N1) pandemic was present, with two peaks of incidence in the influenza rate between the first and third week and later between weeks 41 and 47 of the year. The number of outpatient consultations and home visits for influenza-like illness increased in the same weeks, so both were significantly more frequent in the autumn than in the other seasons (P0.001, see Table 1 ). Overall, the influenza rate slightly increased the number of admissions but without statistical significance (P=0.052), even after adjusting for temperature (P=0.444). To study the possible relationship between air pollution and number of hospital admissions, the highest level of pollution, expressed by mean weekly values (Catalonian Air Quality Index) was used. Over the year, the mean score obtained on the Catalonian Air Quality Index scale was 42.5±10.2, which, according to the scale detailed in the methods, corresponded to an acceptable air quality. When stratifying according to the air quality scale, 858 (8.8%) admissions occurred in weeks in which air quality was considered low (more pollution), 6,481 (66.1%) during weeks when it was estimated as acceptable, and 2,645 (26.1%) during periods when it was rated as satisfactory (less pollution). Weeks of pollution coincided with higher temperatures, although no significant differences were found between air pollution and number of hospital admissions (P=0.887). In multivariate analysis, after adjustment for humidity, comorbidity, air pollution, and influenza rate, only mean temperatures retained statistical significance, with a mean increase of 4.70% weekly admissions for each Celsius degree decrease (r 2 =0.599, P0.001, see Tables 2 and 3 ).
