During the study period, 4,327 patients were followed for 42,658 patient-days and 5,150 ventilator-days. Eighty-eight patients (2.03%) met the CDC criteria for HAP, for an incidence rate of 2.06/1,000 patient days [95% C. I. (1.65-2.54)], of which 9 were Ventilator associated-pneumonia, or 1.74/1,000 ventilator days. Three patients died before the procurement of nasopharyngeal samples, 10 patients did not provide consent, and for 12 patients it was not possible to obtain the nasopharyngeal sample within 5 days from the onset of clinical symptoms (Figure 1) ; therefore 63 patients were included and data on 1,810 patient-days were collected. Baseline epidemiological and clinical characteristics did not differ between included and excluded subjects ( Table 1) . Of the included patients, 55.6% were males and the median age was 25 months old (IQR 6-103). None of the included patients referred influenza vaccination in the previous or present season. The most frequent diagnoses were malignant neoplasms (30%), congenital heart disease (28%) and malformations of the genitourinary tract (11%). Twelve cases of HAP (19%) were acquired in the ICU. At least one respiratory virus was detected in 65% [95% CI (53-77)] of HAP episodes, with a single viral pathogen observed in 53.9% and coinfection with two viruses in 11.1% of cases. The most frequently identified viruses were RSV and parainfluenza which represented 25% of the cases each, followed by influenza B and AH1N1 (17%), rhinovirus (13%), bocavirus (8%), adenovirus (6%), human metapneumovirus (4%), and enterovirus (2%) (Figure 2) . Patients with VAHAP were slightly younger [median age 21 (IQR 6-90) vs. 37 (IQR 5-126) months], had been hospitalized for a shorter period of time [median length of stay 14 (IQR 5-27) vs. 30 (IQR 13-81) days] and were more likely to have leukopenia (16.8 vs. 4 .8%) than those with NVHAP. However, the strength of evidence for these differences was low (p > 0.05). Otherwise, epidemiological and clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups (Tables 2, 3) . The median length of antibiotic prescription, although lower in the VAHAP group, did not show a significant difference between the two groups ( Table 2) . Blood cultures were taken from 60 patients (95%), obtaining a total of 120 cultures. Tracheal aspirate cultures were obtained from 22 out of 33 patients with tracheal intubation (66%). Twelve patients (19%) had either a positive blood or tracheal aspirate culture ( Table 3) . There was no difference between the number of blood cultures or tracheal aspirates taken in the NVHAP group and the VAHAP group, (p > 0.2). Eight different bacterial pathogens were isolated from the patients, which were in order of frequency Staphylococcus epidermidis (N = 2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N = 2), Escherichia coli (N = 2), Klebsiella pneumoniae (N = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (N = 1), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (N = 1), Enterobacter cloacae(N = 1), and Acinetobacter baumanii (N = 1).As CRP or procalcitonin were obtained in only 8 patients, these were not included in the analysis. With regards to outcome ( Table 4) , two thirds of patients in the NVHAP and almost half in the VAHAP group required mechanical ventilation (66.7 vs. 46.2%, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.43-1.37). Although deaths occurred slightly earlier in the NVHAP group, the 30-day mortality rate did not show a significant difference between groups (Figure 3) , nor did the risk for death differ between groups in the univariate or multivariate analysis (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0. 29-5.40 ).
