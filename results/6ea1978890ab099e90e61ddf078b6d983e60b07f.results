Bacterial microbiota as evaluated by 16S rDNA Molecular assays were positive for at least one bacterium for 129 out of 185 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from patients with pneumonia as well as from 13 out of 25 from control individuals (p = 0.07). Bacterial clone libraries from amplified 16S rDNA genes (nearly 4,000 clones that contained exploitable sequences were included) identified 157 different bacteria at the species level. Detailed data about the relative abundance and richness of each species in their corresponding library are summarized in data S1 and S2 in supplementary informations. Bacterial clone libraries of patients showed that 44 libraries were characterized by the presence of only one bacterium, 40 libraries were polybacterial but dominated by one bacterium (50% of the clones in the library), whereas 45 libraries were polybacterial without any dominant bacterium (Fig. 1) . Bacterial clone libraries of controls showed that 2 libraries were characterized by the presence of only one bacterium, 4 libraries were polybacterial but dominated by one bacterium (50% of the clones in the library), whereas 7 libraries were polybacterial but without any dominant bacterium (Fig. 1) . Patients exhibited up to 15 bacteria in their BAL fluids (mean 6 SD; 3.4862.80) (Tables 1  and 2 ). Overall, patients exhibited 146 different species belonging to 7 different phyla (13 classes, 23 orders, 44 families and 71 genera) of which 73 had not been previously observed in BAL from pneumonia, whereas bacterial clone libraries of controls identified 38 species belonging to 4 different phyla (9 classes, 13 orders, 22 families and 27 genera). In patients, aerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, and anaerobic bacteria from oropharyngeal flora were the most frequent bacteria identified (Tables S1,S2,S3,S4, Fig. 2) . Surprisingly, bacteria that are usually associated with other diseases such as the gram-positive anaerobe Atopobium vaginae, or from unexpected animal origins, such as Enterococcus canintestini, were alsoc found. Moreover, 51 strictly anaerobic bacteria (35%) were found in patients versus 17 anaerobic bacteria (44%) found in controls (p = 0.26). Among those bacteria which were identified in controls, 24 bacteria were also identified in patients (Fig. S1 , Tables S2,S3,S4), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa sequences respectively identified in 100% and 86% from 2 different clones libraries from 2 immunocompromised controls. In the second clone library, the 14% of the remaining sequences included Achromobacter xylosoxidans, which also is a typical bacterium of nosocomial pneumonia. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia sequences were found in 10% of clone library of another immunocompromised control, along with 5 other bacteria. Similarly, sequences of Streptococcus mitis (7% of the clone library) was identified along with 12 other bacteria in a control with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a history of aspiration pneumonia (AP) 6 days before BAL sampling. Additionally, Arcobacter cryaerophilus, Atopobium parvulum, Lachnospiraceae bacterium, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Prevotella pallens were significantly more frequent in controls than in patients (p = 0.01, 0.01, 0.001, 0.01 and 0.01 respectively) (Table  S4) . Bacterial clone libraries surprisingly showed 37 new phylotypes with 16S rDNA sequence similarity lower than 98% to known bacteria available in the GenBank database (Data S1 and S2). Among them, 32 novel bacterial phylotypes were identified in BAL from patients, whereas 5 novel phylotypes were identified in BAL from controls (Fig. 3) . Novel bacterial phylotypes identified in patients were more diversified, as they belonged to 6 different phyla including Bacteroidetes (11 phylotypes), Firmicutes (9 phylotypes), Proteobacteria (9 phylotypes), Actinobacteria (one phylotypes), Acidobacteria (one phylotype) and Spirochaetes (one phylotype). Novel species identified in controls belong to Bacteroidetes (2 phylotypes), Firmicutes (2 phylotypes) and Actinobacteria (one phylotype). Prevotellaceae phylotypes represent 24% of all novel phylotypes identified and they were exhibited in patients with pneumonia as well as in control subjects (Fig. 3) . Results obtained using routine BAL and blood culture are available Text S1. Fungal microbiota as evaluated by the intergenic spacer of 18S rDNA At least one fungus was found in 31 BAL patient samples and in 6 from controls (p = 0.37). Positive patients exhibit up to 5 fungi in their BAL fluids (mean 6 SD; 1.4060.83) (Tables 1 and 2) . Detailed data about the relative abundance and richness of each species in their corresponding library are also summarized in summary files (Data S1 and S2) in supplementary informations. Fungal microbiota obtained from patients showed the presence of 22 different species belonging to 2 phyla (8 orders, 11 families and 12 genera) among which 6 phylotypes had not been previously identified in BAL fluids from pneumonia. Clone libraries from controls, identified 5 fungi belonging to one phylum (2 orders, 4 families and 3 genera) among which 3 fungi were also identified in patients. Candida species were the most common fungal species identified (Tables S1,S2,S3 and S5). Environmental fungi, which usually colonize water, food debris and humid building surfaces, were more notably identified in our study than in previous pneumonia studies. Furthermore, tree fungi belonging to Basidiomycota phylum, Sporidiobolales sp., Cryptococcus victoriae and Hyphoderma praetermissum, were found for the first time in pneumonia BAL samples in the present study, while Candida utilis and Periconia macrospinosa were identified only in controls. Additionally, Candida utilis was significantly more frequent in controls than in patients (p = 0.01). Results of fungi obtained using a routine BAL culture are available in Text S1.
