Altogether, 3693 pregnant women were enrolled and followed from April 2011 to May 2014; 944 nasal swabs were collected during 3554 person-years of follow-up while pregnant or postpartum, with a respiratory virus detected in 556 (59%) of these swabs. RSV was detected in nasal swabs collected from 14 (0.4%) of all women, which constitutes 2.0% of the 733 women with febrile respiratory illnesses (Fig 1) . RSV was detected in women only between September and December during the three years of the study. The incidence of RSV was 3.9/1000 person years overall. A total of 1189 person-years of follow-up occurred between September and December; during this period, the incidence of RSV was 11.8/1000 person-years. Overall, the median gestational age at enrollment was 17 weeks (range, 4-34). For mothers who had RSV, the median age at enrollment was 16 weeks, (range, and for mothers without RSV, the median age at enrollment was 17 weeks (range, 4-34). Overall, 90% of moms were enrolled prior to 28 weeks gestation. Seven women had an RSV illness during pregnancy (median days before birth: 42 days, range, 13-201 days) and seven had RSV illness after delivery (median days after birth: 74, range 27-168). Baseline characteristics of women with and without RSV infection are shown in Table 1 . Mothers with RSV report fewer median years of education than those without (0 vs. 5 years; P = 0.04). No differences were observed in number of other children in the household (P = 0.80), use of an open indoor cookstove (P = 0.09), or presence of household members who smoked (P = 0.73).
