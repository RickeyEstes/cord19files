FKBP51 increases BECN1 stability. In search for a mechanism of the previously reported increase of the pivotal autophagy regulator BECN1 driven by FKBP51 2 we considered effects on mRNA and protein level. In direct comparison to the highly homologous FKBP52, a known counter-player of FKBP51 29 , only FKBP51 increased BECN1 levels upon ectopic expression 3 (Fig. 1a) . Regulation of BECN1 protein stability through the ubiquitin-proteasome system was indicated by using the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which increased the levels of BECN1 and the extent of its ubiquitination (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1a ). The use of ammonium chloride to inhibit lysosome-mediated proteolysis confirmed proteasomal degradation of BECN1 (Supplementary Fig. 1b) . Ectopic expression of FKBP51 was similarly efficient in stabilising BECN1 as proteasome inhibition by MG132 (Fig. 1c, d) . A protein degradation assay based on a pulse-chase using Halo-tagged BECN1 30 confirmed that FKBP51 stabilises BECN1 (Fig. 1e, f) . These results also revealed a high turn-over rate of BECN1 (t 1/2 < 1 h). FKBP51 associates with SKP2 regulating BECN1 stability. FKBP51 recently emerged as a scaffolder protein organising various regulatory protein complexes 2,31-33 . We thus considered an FKBP51-controlled association of BECN1 with E3 ubiquitin ligases or USPs. Based on the results of an FKBP51 mammalian-2-hybrid interaction screen 34 , we first verified the association of FKBP51 with the USPs 18 and 36, and with the E3 ligase SKP2 by immunoprecipitation in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2a) . TRAF6 that is known as an E3 ligase of BECN1 35 and interactor of FKBP51 36 served as a control. Of these FKBP51 interactors, SKP2, USP18 and USP36 have the potential to influence K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of BECN1. Co-immunoprecipitations of BECN1 in HEK293 cells revealed association with SKP2 only (Fig. 2b) , which has not been described as an E3 ligase of BECN1 before. However, inhibition of SKP2 has been previously linked to induction of autophagy 37, 38 . Since we aimed at understanding the mechanism of FKBP51directed increase in BECN1, we focussed in the following on proteins we found associated with both FKBP51 and BECN1. To assess the effect of SKP2 on BECN1 stability, we monitored the protein levels of BECN1 after the addition of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) in the presence of over-expressed SKP2 or TRAF6 (again used as control), respectively. SKP2 affected BECN1 stability, leading to faster proteasomal degradation, while the K63-E3 ligase TRAF6 had no effect (Fig. 2c, d) . Similar results were obtained in a pulse-chase experiment showing that SKP2 reduced BECN1 by about 20% compared to the vector control already at 30 min (Fig. 2e, f) . Further corroborating the function of SKP2 on BECN1, siRNA directed against Skp2 produced increased levels of BECN1 and the SKP2 target P27 along with enhanced lipidation of LC3B (typically detected as the ratio LC3B-II/I) (Fig. 2g, Supplementary  Fig. 1c ). Ectopic expression of SKP2 exerted the opposite effect (Fig. 2h, Supplementary Fig. 1d ). Decreasing SKP2 by siRNA prevented BECN1 ubiquitination (Fig. 2i ). In addition, stability assays using either CHX or the Halo-tagged BECN1 further established that reducing SKP2 levels with siRNA increases BECN1 stability leading to almost 3-fold higher levels at 90 min ( Fig. 2j-m) . Phosphorylation-controlled ubiquitination of BECN1 by SKP2. Next, we examined whether SKP2 ubiquitinates BECN1. Ubiquitination frequently forms chains linking several ubiquitin units to distinct lysine (K) residues. The type of lysine linkage determines protein fate and function 39 . Using a set of ubiquitin mutants, we found that SKP2 leads to K48-linked poly-ubiquitination (Fig. 3a) , which marks proteins for proteasomal degradation 39 . Using a freely available mass-spectrometry database that proposes ubiquitination sites in mammalian proteins 40 , we mutated various lysines in BECN1 and identified K402 in BECN1′s ECD (evolutionary conserved domain) as the attachment site of SKP2-directed ubiquitination (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 1e ). The potential recruitment of SKP2 by FKBP51 raises the question how this may lead to reduced rather than increased ubiquitination of BECN1. Since FKBP51 inactivates the kinase AKT1 through complex formation with the phosphatase PHLPP 2,31 , and AKT1 regulates SKP2 through phosphorylation at S72 41 , we used ectopic expression of FKBP51-Flag and co-immunoprecipitation to probe for protein interactions and the phosphorylation status of SKP2. The association between FKBP51 and BECN1, AKT1, PHLPP, and SKP2 was accompanied by a decreased phosphorylation of AKT1 at position S473 and of SKP2 at position S72 ( Fig. 3c-e) . These results suggest a mechanism where FKBP51 enacts a cascade of activity changes in AKT1 and SKP2 by the recruitment of PHLPP (Fig. 4a) . We followed several approaches to substantiate the functionality of this cascade, first by employing SKP2 mutants that either mimic phosphorylation (S72D/S75D) was immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts and probed for ubiquitination by western blotting (quantification Supplementary Fig. 1a) . c-f FKBP51 delays degradation of BECN1. HEK293 cells were transfected with vector control (Co) or FKBP51 expressing plasmid for 72 h and treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX, 30 µg mL −1 ) as indicated in c, d. In e, f, HEK293 cells were transfected with Halo-tagged BECN1 expressing plasmid together with FKBP51-Flag expressing plasmid or vector, cultivated with halogenated dye (100 nM, R110Direct, pulse) overnight, switched to medium without dye (chase) and treated with MG132 or vehicle for the indicated times.

The phosphomimetic mutant still decreased BECN1 stability, but the S72A mutant showed no effect (Fig. 4b, c) , consistent with the proposed cascade (Fig. 4a) . We further made use of a well-established PHLPP inhibitor 42 that led to enhanced phosphorylation of AKT1 and SKP2 (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 1f) . A pulse-chase assay showed that the stability of BECN1 decreased by using the PHLPP inhibitor (Fig. 4e, f) . This inhibitor had no effect on the stability of the ubiquitination-protected K402R mutant of BECN1, further corroborating the proposed cascade (Fig. 4g, h) . In addition, pharmacological inhibition of AKT1 enhanced BECN1 stability in both assays, leaving about twice the amount of BECN1 at 90 min compared to control ( Fig. 4i-l) . In order to verify that reduced SKP2 activity drives autophagy in our cellular set-up, we used siRNA and determined the degradation of long-lived proteins 43 . Targeting SKP2 increased proteolysis, but not in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA, Fig. 4m ). Furthermore, we observed decreased levels of P62 ( Supplementary Fig. 1g ), which typically goes along with enhanced autophagy 43 . All these data are consistent with an inhibitory effect of SKP2 on autophagy regulated by a phosphorylation cascade involving FKBP51, PHLPP and AKT1. Small molecule inhibitors of SKP2 increase BECN1 stability. Next, we compared known small molecule inhibitors of SKP2 44 Fig. 2 FKBP51 associates with SKP2 that regulates BECN1 stability. a HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated E3 ligases and USPs; after 72 h, cells were either harvested for immunoprecipitation of FKBP51. b BECN1 associates with SKP2, but not with USP18 or USP36. HEK293 cells were transfected with vectors expressing tagged SKP2, USP18 and USP36; after 72 h, cells were harvested for immune-precipitation with either control IgG or anti BECN1 antibody. c, d SKP2 affects BECN1 stability. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing SKP2 or TRAF6 and exposed to MG132 (10 µM, 2 h) where indicated and to cycloheximide (CHX, 30 µg mL −1 ) after 72 h for the durations indicated to monitor the decay of BECN1. e, f The conditions of c,d were also used in the pulse-chase assay, performed as in Fig. 1e , f, to determine BECN1 stability. g, h Cellular SKP2 levels determine BECN1 levels. SKP2 was either down-regulated by using siRNA (g) or up-regulated by transient transfection (h) and the levels of the indicated proteins were measured by western blotting (P27 served as control). Quantifications for g and h are provided in Supplementary Fig. 1c , d. i Knock-down of SKP2 by siRNA decreases BECN1 ubiquitination (assay as in Fig. 1b ). j-m Stability assays were performed like in c-f to determine the effect of SKP2targeting siRNA on BECN1 stability.

The pulse-chase assay confirmed SMIP004 as the most efficient compound in stabilising BECN1 leaving threefold more BECN1 protein after 90 min (Fig. 5b) . Furthermore, SMIP004 reduced ubiquitination of BECN1 most efficiently (Fig. 5c , last lane). The long-lived protein assay revealed that SMER3 and SMIP004 enhanced protein half-life, while C1 showed no effect (Fig. 5d ). Starvation by cultivating the cells in HBSS, which we confirmed to induce autophagy (Supplementary Fig. 2b -d), did not elicit a greater effect than SMIP004 in the long-lived protein assay (Fig. 5d) . Furthermore, SMIP004 most profoundly affected not only BECN1, but also LC3B-II/I and P62 (example blot in Fig. 5e , quantifications in Supplementary Fig. 2e -g) that are established markers of autophagy. To analyse autophagy more thoroughly, it is mandatory to include assays that address autophagic protein turn-over, commonly referred to as autophagic flux 43 . Thus, we subjected SMIP004 to a flux assay with the specific inhibitor of vacuolar H + -ATPases bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), which interferes with lysosome acidification and thus degradation of autophagosome cargo 43 . We revealed a stimulatory effect of SMIP004 on the autophagic flux ( Fig. 5f , Supplementary Fig. 2b , c). In addition, it has been shown that ATG14 oligomerizes to dimers and tetramers, which is essential for autophagy by promoting STX17 binding and autophagosome-lysosome fusion 6 . Using capillary-based electrophoresis allowing for better resolution at high molecular weight we observed ATG14 oligomerization to 7-8mers, which was enhanced by SMIP004 ( Supplementary  Fig. 2h , i). Thus, SMIP004 was used as SKP2-inhibitor (SKP2i) in all subsequent experiments.
