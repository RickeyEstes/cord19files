An overview of AIDS policies issued against specific HIV/AIDS epidemic phases are summarized in Table 2 . The Chinese government has issued hundreds of HIV/AIDS policies over the past 25 years. We focused on national-level policies that have had a significant impact on China's HIV/AIDS response. The landmark policies include: the implementation and revocation of China's travel ban on people living with HIV/AIDS; the Blood Donation Law of 1998; China's 5-Year Action Plans for the Containment and Control of HIV/AIDS; the 'Four Frees and One Care' policy to improve access to treatment and care services; the creation of high-risk behavioural intervention outreach teams; and the 2006 AIDS regulation. These key policies were put in place during different phases of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China (Figure 1 ).
