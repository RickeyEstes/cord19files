A time-course study was conducted, where CHSE-214 or CHSE-Mx10 cells were infected with IPNV at different time points prior to, and after treatment with type I IFN. Cells were harvested for multiple assays over the time-course in order to try to determine at which level(s) IPNV inhibits IFN signal transduction and at which level IFN inhibits viral protein synthesis. i. or 10 h p.i., were infected with IPNV (N1) (MOI 2) in four parallel wells. Supernatants were harvested at indicated times and virus titers were determined as described in Section 2. These data represent one of two repeated experiments which gave reproducible results.
