Of 2034 studies identified, 73 articles published predominantly from 2016 to 2017 met the inclusion criteria (Fig 1) [20-26, 28, 33-97]. The most commonly predicted phenomena were spatial spread (34%), followed by R 0 (basic reproductive number) or R E (effective reproductive number) (29%), epidemic dynamics (peak size/timing, final size and trajectory) (28%), microcephaly burden (15%), and vector competence and ecology (12%) ( Only 40% of studies made all relevant source data entirely accessible, while more than 20% of the eligible studies did not make any source data available either directly (e.g. an associated data repository) or indirectly (e.g. a citation or web-link) ( Table 2 ). The visual display of model output was at least partly clear and accurate in 95% of the studies. Over a third of the studies did not present estimates of prediction uncertainty. Approximately half of the studies did not entirely present methods with a level of detail to allow reproducibility. Over 60% of the studies did not provide any computational code used for the analyses. We classified more models as deterministic (76%) as opposed to stochastic. It should be emphasized we only ultimately evaluated whether a model was deterministic versus stochastic. The large majority of published manuscripts were freely accessible (e.g. without a paywall), although 4% were published with paid access only (Table 3) . Less than one third of manuscripts were posted on rapid preprint servers (e.g. bioRxiv) [99], prior to publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The median time from journal submission to e-journal publication was 93.5 days, with the maximum time greater than 1 year. This included delays after manuscript acceptance, 25% of the studies had delays of more than 24 days between acceptance and publication ( Table 3 ). Most of the prediction studies were published late in the epidemic, well after the peaks in reported Zika cases (Fig 2, Fig 3) . Submitting manuscripts to preprint servers made results available earlier by a median of 119 days (maximum 331 days, IQR 30-177 days) (Table 3 ). This shift led to more results being available close to the time of the 2016 South America and Central America epidemic peaks and prior to the epidemic peak in the Caribbean and the 2017 peak in Central America (Fig 2, Fig 3) . Comparing the impact factor of journals accepting studies which were posted as preprints (versus the impact factor of those journals accepting studies which were not posted as pre-prints), there was no significant difference (median impact factor 4.37 vs. 4.45 respectively; p = 0.84 by Mann-Whitney U test). Over 90% of the studies included authors with academic affiliations (Table 4) . Government affiliated authors participated in a minority of studies, although this may simply reflect "inhouse" operational models not being published through journals. Among studies with identifiable funding sources, funding was divided among several sources, though the most common was the United States government, which funded or partially funded 50% of the studies (Table 4 ). However, many of those studies and others had a variety of funding sources, 85% had at least one non-U.S. government source. Non-governmental organizations were the second most common source, being included in 35% of the studies.
