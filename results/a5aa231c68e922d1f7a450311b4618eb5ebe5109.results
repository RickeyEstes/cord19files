Semen characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Total seminal plasma protein concentration was 2.19 AE 1.56 g/ dL (mean AE SD; range 1. 12-5.19) . Gel images are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 and the graphic profile of IOD mean bands in seminal plasma of all 20 dogs is shown in Fig. 3 . A total of 37 protein bands were identified, 19 and 18 in the 13% and 22% gels, respectively. However, no individual dog had all 37 bands. In the 13% gel, molecular weights ranged from 100.6 to 17.1 kDa, with four bands (49.7, 33.2, 26.4, and 19.5 kDa) present in all dogs. In the 22% gel, There was no significant correlation between total protein concentration and semen characteristics. There was a positive correlation between the IOD of two bands (B4, 67 kDa and B5, 58.6 kDa) of seminal plasma and semen characteristics ( Table 2 ).
