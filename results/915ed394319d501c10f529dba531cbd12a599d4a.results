2.1. EBOV-GP-driven entry into cell lines requires CatB/CatL activity irrespective of the surrogate system and the target cell type We first examined whether retroviral (mainly spherical), rhabdoviral (mainly bullet-shaped) and filoviral (mainly filamentous) particles differ in their CatB/CatL-dependence for host cell entry. For this, we used retro-and rhabdoviral vectors previously used to analyze EBOV-GP-mediated host cell entry (Takada et al., 1997; Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1998) as well as replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) encoding EBOV-GP (Gonzalez-Hernandez et al., 2018) . Moreover, we employed two systems that depend exclusively on filovirus proteins. First, we produced EBOV-like particles harboring luciferase by directed expression of all viral proteins from plasmids, including a VP30 version that is fused to firefly luciferase . Second, we employed the EBOV trVLP system in which a EBOV minigenome is packaged into filoviral particles due to expression of the missing open reading frames (EBOV-NP, -VP30, -VP35 and -L) in trans (Schmidt et al., 2018; Watt et al., 2014) . While the VP30-Luc system allows measuring a single delivery of VP30-luciferase into cells, the trVLP system allows studying entry and spread of filovirus-like particles. Finally, we employed the endosomal cysteine protease inhibitors E-64d and MDL28170 to block CatB/CatL activity in target cells. These inhibitors were previously shown to interfere with CatB/CatL activity Fig. 1 . EBOV-GP-driven entry into 293T cells requires CatB/CatL activity irrespective of the transduction system. 293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates and pre-incubated with DMSO or the indicated concentrations of E-64d or MDL28170 and then transduced with equal volumes of (A) single-cycle VSV particles (VSVpp) pseudotyped with the indicated glycoproteins or no glycoprotein as negative control; (B) replication-competent VSV or VSV-chimera encoding EBOV-GP instead of VSV-G at a MOI of 0.1; (C) MLV particles pseudotyped with the indicated glycoproteins or no glycoprotein; (D) EBOV-like particles containing VP30-luciferase and bearing EBOV-GP, VSV-G or no glycoprotein; (E) EBOV-like particles generated in the trVLP system. Luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined at 24 h post transduction as indicator of transduction efficiency. In panels A-D, transduction mediated by EBOV-GP and VSV-G is shown relative to transduction mediated by control particles bearing no glycoprotein, which was set as 1. In panel E, transduction by particles produced in the absence of the viral polymerase, L, were set as 1. The average of three independent experiments is shown in each panel. Error bars indicate standard error of the mean (SEM). One-way ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) with Bonferroni post-test analysis was performed to test statistical significance (*, p ≤ 0.05; **, p ≤ 0.01; ***, p ≤ 0.001). (Brana et al., 1999; Gewies and Grimm, 2003; Hoffmann et al., 2016; Simmons et al., 2005) and were previously used to inhibit EBOV-GPdriven entry (Gnirss et al., 2012; Kaletsky et al., 2007) . Analysis of GP-driven entry into 293T cells revealed that entry was blocked by E-64d and MDL28170 in a concentration-dependent manner, irrespective of whether GP was presented on retro-, rhabdo-or filovirus particles (Fig. 1 ). In contrast, entry driven by the glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was not affected by E-64d and MDL28170, as expected. Moreover, analysis of entry of EBOV-GPbearing rhabdoviral particles into six different cell lines of human (accidental host; 293T, Huh-7, A549 and Calu-3), non-human primate (accidental host; Vero E6) and fruit bat (suspected reservoir host; EpoNi/22.1) origin revealed that entry was sensitive to inhibition by E-64d irrespective of the target cell type, although it should be stated that entry into Calu-3 was very close to background (Fig. 2) . Collectively, our results show that, under the experimental conditions chosen, EBOV-GP-driven entry was CatB/CatL-dependent irrespective of the surrogate system and target cell line. Moreover, our results identify Calu-3 cells as one of the very few cell lines that are largely resistant to GP-mediated entry.
