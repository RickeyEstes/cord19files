In total, 145 eligible individuals were approached and 94 participants were recruited to this study. The response rate was about 65%. The majority were female (76.6%), aged 30 years or above (71.3%), and more than half of them (56.4%) had a high school education level or below. Participants were evenly distributed across the three cities ( Table 2) . Awareness of the H7N9 outbreak was very high due to broad media coverage, and most participants reported that they received their first information about the H7N9 outbreak during late March to early April 2013 via TV (67.0%), Internet/ social media (48.8%) or newspaper (37.2%) ( Table 3 ). The information sought by participants most was without giving any reasons. Each participant received an incentive of 50 yuan (equivalent to approximately US$ 8) after the interview.
