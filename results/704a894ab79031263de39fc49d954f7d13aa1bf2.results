The total number of positive fecal samples for FCoV 14 cats, which were mostly Korean short hair breeds over one year of age. Of these FCoV positive cats, three were identified to be co-infected with FPLV (Table 1) . Among the 212 feline fecal swab samples, eight were positive for FCoV type I, four were positive for type II, and two were positive for types I and II ( Table 2 ). Eleven of the positive samples were from cats displaying symptoms of infection. Three of the positive samples were from asymptomatic cats ( Table  2 ). Among the ill cats, the infections were due to type I (n = 6), type II (n = 3) and both types I and II (n = 2). Of the three positive samples from asymptomatic cats, two were type I and one was type II (Table 2) . Of the 107 specimens collected from six local animal hospitals, the nine FCoV-infected cats included type I (n = 5), type II (n = 2), and types I and II (n = 2) ( Table 1 ). The 105 fecal swab samples obtained from two animal shelters included five that were FCoV positive (three type I and two type II; co-infection was not evident). Alternatively, canine coronavirus (CCoV) or TGEV can be used as a target antigen because of their close serological identity with FCoV. The prevalence of anti-FCoV antibody in the feline samples was low (29/212; 13.7%) and comprised 20-fold (n = 5), 40-fold (n = 6), 80-fold (n = 5), 160-fold (n = 3), 320-fold (n = 2), 640fold (n = 4), 1280-fold (n = 3), and 2560-fold (n = 1) ( Figure 1 ). The 29 cats having FCoV antibodies included 16 of the 83 ill cats (19.3%) and 13 of the 129 healthy cats (10.1%), and, according the location of sample collection, represented animal hospital cats (14.0%, 15/107) and shelter cats (13.3%, 14/105). A phylogentic analysis was performed using spike gene partial sequences from 46 CoVs including Korean FCoV from the current study (n = 16), FCoVs obtained globally (n = 23), CCoVs (n = 5), raccoon dog CoV (RDCoV; n = 1), and Chinese fetter badger CoV (CFBCoV; n = 1). The phylogenetic tree data set was resampled 1000 times to generate bootstrap percentage values. The phylogenic tree clearly delineated types I and II FCoVs. The analysis showed that of the ten Korean FCoVs in the type I group, nine type I FCoVs belonged to a different lineage when compared to strains isolated from other parts of the world, and only the Korean FCoV 08K-1991 was grouped with UCD1 (Japan). All six Korean type II FCoVs (08K-609, 08K-656, 08K-1154, 08K-1553, 08K-559/II and 08K-1429/II) was shown to be originated from the same lineage as F20-54-II isolated from Japan ( Figure 2 ).
