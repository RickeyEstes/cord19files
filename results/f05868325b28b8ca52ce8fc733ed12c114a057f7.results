We examined the gene expression profiles in the trachea mucosal lining at 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, and 21 days (d1, d3, d5, d8, d12, and d21) after primary immunization and at 1 and 3 days (d22 and d24) after secondary immunization with IBV-Mass. Of the 13,008 usable cDNA features on the array (Burnside et al., 2005) , a total of 1752 elements were changed by 2-fold or more for at least two time points (Supplementary Tables 2 and  4 ). The majority of changes occurred upon primary immunization, while relatively few elements changed upon the secondary immunization. The significantly altered immune-related genes, which are grouped based on their functions and their expression patterns, are described below.
