From 1999 to 2013 there were a total of 7022 cases of cholera, chikungunya, dengue, filariasis, leptospirosis, meningococcal infection, poliomyelitis, measles, schistosomiasis, viral hepatitis (A), typhoid and para-typhoid reported and subsequently investigated by the Department of Communicable Diseases. Among these cases, 558 (7.9%) met the case definition for travel-related illnesses. Typhoid was the most frequent travel-associated infection, 300 (53.8%), followed by measles 80 (14.3%), and the least reported travel-associated infection was poliomyelitis with 2 cases (0.4%) ( Table 1) . The majority of travel-associated infections were reported among non-Omani and affected predominantly male population ( Table 2 ). The greater proportion was among those aged between 19 and 35, and most of the cases reported South Asia as the region of exposure. The trend of travel-associated infections in Oman between 1999 and 2013 ( Fig. 1) shows three peaks, and each one is related to the rise in the number of certain infections. The first peak was in 2001 (54 cases) and was related to a cluster of 7 cases of meningococcal infections among pilgrims during Hajj with additional 15 cases of measles. In 2009 the rise (49 cases) was due to imported cases of measles from Yemen and the last peak in 2012 (74 cases) was mainly related to cases of dengue imported from India. Excluding peak years, the annual average of travelassociated infections was 31.7 AE 11.1 cases. Deaths attributed to travel-associated infections were reported in only 9 cases (less than 2%) with case fatality rate ranging from 5.1% for dengue fever to 20% for meningococcal disease. Disease admission rates were different among different infections. All reported travel-associated poliomyelitis cases were admitted to hospitals as they presented with acute flaccid paralysis and the majority of cholera, dengue and meningococcal infections as well as Paratyphoid cases were admitted; however, no admissions were reported for measles or viral hepatitis A cases.
