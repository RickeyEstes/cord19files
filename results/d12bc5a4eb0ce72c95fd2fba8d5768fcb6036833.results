Construction of IAV infection-induced cell-specific normal and inflammatory networks. Constructing regulatory and biochemical networks from multidimensional data is a key step in systems biology for analyzing network properties. In the present study, we developed a model-based framework for constructing networks by integrating gene expression profiles with a prior knowledge of PPI network (Step #1 in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figure S1 ). First, the rough PPI network containing 90 nodes and 412 edges was constructed using PPI databases (see Methods). Next, based on the rough PPI network and the H5N1 and H1N1 datasets, the Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) that measured the dependence between paired nodes were applied to filter the highly noise-induced interactions. We thus obtained the refined normal and inflammatory networks induced by H5N1 and H1N1. To construct cell-specific regulatory networks and further remove the redundant (indirect) regulations in the refined networks, we then built the ordinary differential equation (ODE) models for the refined networks and used an improved conjugate gradient method (ICG) to identify the parameters in the models (see Methods). Finally, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was employed to determine whether the interactions between two proteins were significant or just false positives (see Methods). The constructed normal and inflammatory networks during H5N1 and H1N1 infection are displayed in Supplementary Figure S4 . For both H5N1 and H1N1 infections, the average relative errors (AREs) of the 99% nodes are less than 0.1 and those of the 1% nodes are within the interval [0.1, 0.2] in normal networks. In inflammatory networks, AREs of all nodes are less than 0.1 ( Figure 2 ). The results showed the accuracy and reliability of the constructed networks. Inflammatory networks are characterized by an increase in network entropy. Recently, information theory, measuring uncertainty or variability, has been widely adopted to understand complex biological networks 19, 20 . Previous studies have shown that increased entropy is a hallmark of cancer systems 21, 22 , thus we here attempt to determine whether the network entropy can also discriminate the inflammatory network from the normal network. To test this hypothesis, we proposed a definition of network entropy (see Methods). Through calculation and comparison, we found that the local entropies in the inflammatory networks exhibited significantly higher values than those in the normal networks for H5N1 and H1N1 infections ( Figure 3 ). The global network entropies of inflammatory networks are also higher than those of normal networks (For H5N1 infection, 8.5891 vs. 7.7276; for H1N1 infection, 8.2584 vs. 7.6487). By performing a significance test for the difference in global network entropy of inflammatory and normal networks (see Methods), we found the global network entropy of inflammatory networks is also significantly higher than that of normal networks (Bootstrap 1000 times, P-value 5 0). Moreover, the number of increased differential entropies is significantly greater than that of decreased differential entropies (Supplementary Figure S5) . These results indicated that the network entropy provided good discrimination between normal and inflammatory networks. Network entropy performs better than other network metrics in charactering the inflammatory network. To investigate whether other topological metrics of the network can also discriminate inflammatory networks as well as the network entropy does, we first calculated six global metrics of these two networks in topological properties with respect to network diameter, density, centralization, average path-length, average number of neighbors and clustering coefficient, using the Network Analyzer plugin in Cytoscape 23 . Detailed comparisons of these two networks are displayed in Supplementary Table S1. We found that network diameter in the inflammatory networks is the same as that in the normal networks and that the average path-length in the inflammatory networks is smaller than that in normal networks. In contrast, four other metrics in the inflammatory networks were slightly larger than those in the normal networks. Furthermore, we performed a significance test for the differences in eight local metrics (degree, betweenness centrality, bottleneck centrality, closeness centrality, clustering coefficients, Maximum Neighborhood Component (MNC), Density of Maximum Neighborhood Component (DMNC) and Eccentricity (Ecc)) for describing the topological properties of networks. Supplementary Fig. S6 shows that there are not significant differences in these common network metrics between the normal and inflammatory networks. Taken together, these data demonstrated that the network entropy performs better than other topological network metrics in characterizing the inflammatory networks. Biological significance of increased network entropy. Although we have observed the increased entropy in the inflammatory network, it www.nature.com/scientificreports is important to further elaborate the real biological mechanisms associated with such changes. We would expect that proteins exhibiting the increases in entropy may (1) show more disorder in protein expression, and (2) be enriched among signaling pathways that are critical to the inflammatory response. To address the first point, we calculated the variances in the protein expression levels of the two networks (Supplementary Figure S7) . The results indicated that the inflammatory networks exhibited significantly higher variances than those in the normal networks. Therefore, we interpret the increased network entropy as increased uncertainty or variability of protein expression from the viewpoint of information theory. In other words, the disorder expression of proteins may drive the changes in entropy. To address the second point, we performed a functional enrichment analysis using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID 24 ) on the genes (separately for increased and decreased entropy). The functional annotations analysis revealed that genes with increased entropy were significantly enriched in several biological pathways, but no enrichment of any pathways among the genes showing decreases in entropy (Table 1) . Among them, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) are the main pattern-recognition receptors (PRR), which can trigger the intracellular signaling cascades regulating inflammatory mediators against invading pathogens 25 . Recent studies have highlighted the importance of cytosolic DNA in the innate immune host defence by the production of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokines, which is a powerful pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) arising from intracellular bacterial or viral infections 26, 27 . T cells are key effectors of the adaptive immune response. T Cell Receptor (TCR) activation promotes a number of signaling cascades that ultimately determine cell fate, which is an intricately branching network 28 . The cytokine-cytokine receptor (CCR) interaction and Chemokine signalling pathways are also well known inflammatory related pathways. Highly elevated levels of various cytokines and chemokines are the hallmarks of inflammatory response 29 . Therefore, the fact that entropy changes can retrieve known inflammatory signaling pathways indicates that real biological mechanisms can be extracted from the network entropy. Free energy and network entropy reveal network complexity. Biological systems utilize energy to maintain dynamic homeostasis. How do biological systems compromise between maximizing entropy and minimizing energy, which is an important theme in cellular physics and biochemistry 30, 31 . In this work, the Helmholtz free energy was applied to quantify the networks (see Methods). The free energies of the inflammatory networks were lower than those of the normal networks (For H5N1 infection, 223.4483 vs. 221.6804; for H1N1 infection, 222.5151 vs. 221.0976). To test the significance of the difference in free energy, we permuted the virus-infected sample labels randomly (performed bootstrap 1000 times) (see Methods). We found that the free energy of two inflammatory networks for H5N1 and H1N1 infections was significantly lower than that of the normal networks (P-value 5 0). To further explore the thermodynamic features in networks, we used Erdos-RÃ©nyi models, which were the simplest ensemble of randomized networks, to evaluate the evolution of networks 32 . We generated random networks with the same number of nodes but a different average degree as the constructed network and recalculated the thermodynamic measures of the random networks. The global network entropies of the random networks were calculated using datasets under normal and inflammatory conditions. We found that the free energy and the internal energy of a network have a negative correlation, but the network entropy has a positive correlation with the average degree of the network (Figure 4) . These results indicate that the network entropy, free energy and internal energy are closely correlated with the network complexity 33, 34 . Specifically, a network with higher complexity possesses higher network entropy and lower energy and internal energy. Identifying the different dynamically interactions between normal and inflammatory networks. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms of the inflammatory response induced by IAV infections, the different dynamical properties of two networks must be investigated. In this study, we constructed a differential network ( Supplementary Fig. S8 ) and selected 7 potential target proteins (TNFa, IL-1b, TLR2, NFkB, CXCL10, IFN-c and IL10) to form a sub-network (see Methods). We combined nonlinear dynamical models with optimization to obtain the dynamical interactions of these potential target proteins (see Methods). The detailed models for the two networks were presented in Supplementary Text. Because there are only six sample points (0 h, 3 h, 7 h, 12 h, 18 h and 24 h) in the experimental time-series data for the H5N1 infection, cubic spline interpolation (using Matlab toolbox) was used to obtain the interpolated time points at each hour between 0 h and 24 h. We used the data from 23 time points as the simulation data and data from the final time point (24 h) as the prediction data. We determined all kinetic parameters in the two models by using our newly developed optimization algorithm, i.e., diversity-maintained differential evolution based on gradient local search (DMGBDE 35 ). The DMGBDE algorithm was performed five times, and the optimal parameter sets that minimized the error between the experimental data and the simulation values were obtained (Supplementary Tables  S2 and S3) . For the normal sub-network model, the average simulation error and prediction error were 0.26 and 0.55, respectively, and the average error bar in the experimental data was 0.25. For the inflammatory sub-network model, the average simulation error and prediction error were 0.21 and 1.08, respectively, and the average error bar in the experimental data was 0.66. Based on the optimal parameters, the dynamical processes of these seven proteins were simulated and comparisons with the experimental data were plotted in Figure 5 . These results showed that the numerical simulations agreed with the experimental data, which indicates the reliability and predictability Table 1 | KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of genes with increased (DS . 0) and decreased (DS , 0) entropy. The enrichment p-value is from a modified Fisher's Exact Test (EASE Score) and then corrected for multiple hypothesis testing by calculating false discovery rate (FDR). The common enrichment pathways among genes with altered entropy in H5N1 and H1N1 infections were considered, and the maximum of the two FDRs was shown. The threshold for FDR was set to 0.05. '-' indicates no enrichment KEGG of our models. From the nonlinear dynamical models, we investigated two important features. First, we simulated the dynamical evolution of these proteins over 96 h. This simulation demonstrated that all these proteins reached steady-states in both the inflammatory and normal sub-networks (Supplementary Figure S9) . Interestingly, most of these proteins reached much higher steady states in the inflammatory network than those in the normal network. Only IL-1b and TLR2 reached lower steady-states after IAV infection, which were in accordance with the previous experimental studies reporting that the IAV encoded nonstructural protein NS1 can inhibit IL-1b production 36 . These data indicated that upregulation of many inflammasome components may contribute to IAV-induced inflammatory responses. Next, we compared the regulatory relations for two sub-networks. The common parameters (regulations) that appeared in both models were displayed in Fig. 6 and opposite regulatory relations were marked. Network structures from the dynamical models are shown in Supplementary Figure S10 . In addition to more complex interactions in inflammation networks, these results showed that the regulatory interactions are changed after the IAV infection. The regulatory relationships among TLR2, IL-1b, IL10 and NFkB were different from those in the normal networks. After IAV infection, IL10 positively regulated NFkB, NFkB inhibited TLR2 and TLR2 positively regulated IL-1b. In contrast, in the normal network, IL10 inhibited NFkB (which was consistent with the experimental observations that IL-10 attenuates acute lung inflammation via inhibition of the NFkB activation in lung epithelial cells) 37 , NFkB activated TLR2 and TLR2 negatively regulated IL-1b. Together, these results may reveal pathogenic strategies in the induction of an inflammatory response during IAV infection. Sub-networks achieve good dynamical robustness through coordinated interactions. Robustness is one of the fundamental properties of complex biological systems, which allows the system to maintain its behavior against random perturbations. To investigate the dynamical robustness of the sub-networks that were composed of differential network proteins, three metrics of robustness (the local robustness (LR), global robustness (GR) and ratio robustness (RR)) were proposed according to the dynamical steady states of the proteins in the sub-networks (see Methods). We perturbed the parameters 1000 times. The computational results of LR for the 5%, 10% and 20% perturbations of both proteins' initial concentrations and kinetic parameters in models were displayed in Supplementary Figs. S11 and S12 and Tables S4-S15. Supplementary Fig. S11 and Tables S4-S9 showed that both sub-networks are very robust to the perturbations of the proteins' initial concentrations. The perturbations of most kinetic parameters in models have slight or almost no influences on local robustness, but the perturbations of some kinetic parameters were quite different (Supplementary Fig. S12 and Tables S10-S15). The fact that the sub-networks are sensitive to the perturbations of some kinetic parameters drives us to determine whether the system did not reach a steady-state or the system entered into other steadystates when the parameters were perturbed. Therefore, we calculated another measure of robustness (RR). Table 2 indicated that the good RR was achieved. Together, these results indicated that the biological system may enter into other steady-states when the parameters varied. Furthermore, the GR for the two sub-networks were also calculated for perturbations of 5%, 10% and 20%, respectively ( Fig. 7 and Supplementary Tables S16-S19). The results indicated that both subnetworks are very robust to the simultaneous perturbations of the proteins' initial concentrations or kinetic parameters. Together, these results suggested that coordinated interactions among differential network proteins are very beneficial for stabilizing the steadystate behaviors and maintaining the homeostasis of both the inflammatory and normal networks. Inflammatory sub-networks show multistability. From the results of robustness, we guesses that those sensitive parameters possibly made the system switch from one steady-state to another steadystate, i.e., exhibit the bistability or multistability phenomenon 38 . To verify this hypothesis, we performed the bifurcation analysis for sensitive parameters in the normal and inflammatory sub-networks. From Supplementary Fig. S12 and Table S13-S15, we observed that in an inflammatory sub-network, the LR is most sensitive to the perturbations for parameters a21 (TNFa R IL-1b), a31 (TNFa-jTLR2) and a32 (IL-1b R TLR2). However, the RR showed that (Table 2) . We performed bifurcation analysis for these parameters in the inflammatory sub-networks and found interesting bistability and tristability phenomena ( Table S2 ), respectively. These values caused the network to remain at one steady state. When the values were perturbed within 20%, the activity levels of TNFa, IL-1b, IFN-c and NFkB could either stay in the same branch or continually jump into another branch of steady states. In particularly, the activity level of IFN-c could switch between three different steady states. These results showed that the inflammatory sub-networks exhibited complicated dynamical behaviors, such as the reversible bistability and tristability, which provided a good explanation for the experimental observations in variable clinical responses for infections with the H1N1 and H3N2 39 . We also performed bifurcation analysis for three sensitive parameters a32 (IL-1b R TLR2), a67 (IL10-jIFN-c) and a76 (IFN-c R IL10) in the normal sub-network ( Supplementary Fig. S12 and Tables S10-S12). The original values of a32, a67 and a76 were 0.2264, 22.022 and 0.4647 (Supplementary Table S3 ), respectively, which caused the network to remain at one steady state. From Supplementary Fig. S14 , we observed that the dynamics were quite different, although two steady states also existed. When the parameters were perturbed within 20% (Domain I in each sub-graph in Supplementary Fig. S14) , the activity levels of TNFa, IL-1b, IFN-c and NFkB always stayed in one branch of steady states. When the perturbation was greater than 20%, except for IFN-c, the system may could exhibit Hopf bifurcation and oscillation (Domain II in each sub-graph in Supplementary Fig. S14 ). Therefore, a bistable switch is impossible for continuous variations for parameters. The results demonstrated the multistability in the perturbed inflammatory network, but only monostability and oscillation occurred in the perturbed normal network. These results indicate that both the normal and inflammatory networks exhibited different complicated dynamics and functional diversity. Identification of an important protein complex, TNFSF10/HDAC4/ HDAC5, for controlling inflammation. Identifying protein complexes and modules from PPI networks is of great importance for uncovering the biological functions of proteins in networks 40, 41 . In this study, we first used an algorithm that was introduced in a previous study 42 , namely, TSN-PCD, to identify protein complexes. For H5N1 and H1N1 infections, 33 different protein complexes were detected, but 97% of these protein complexes appeared only once. Only one protein complex, TNFSF10(tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 10)and its partner proteins HDAC4 and HDAC5, denoted as TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5, was discovered to appear in both the normal and inflammatory networks at the early stage of IAV infections. More interestingly, the TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5 complex also appeared at the late stage in normal networks. However, this complex disappeared in the inflammatory networks after 7 h with H5N1 and H1N1 infections. The statistical results for this protein complex are listed in Table 3 . The results suggested that dysregulation of the TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5 complex and the subsequent imbalance may be involved in inflammatory diseases. In other words, the TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5 complex may play important roles in controlling inflammation. The disappearance of the TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5 complex in the inflammatory network strongly correlated with sharp increase in the entropy of TNFa, NFkB and COX-2. To investigate the mechanisms for the disappearance of the protein complex TNFSF10/ HDAC4/HDAC5 in the inflammatory network, we selected 11 proteins including 7 differential proteins (TNFa, IL-1b, TLR2, NFkB, CXCL10, IFN-c, IL10), 3 complex proteins (TNFSF10, HDAC4 and HDAC5) and an important protein, COX-2, which was shown to play a critical role in the H5N1-induced inflammatory response 5, 12 . We noticed that the local network entropies of three proteins, TNFSF10, HDAC4 and HDAC5, in the complex were reduced in the inflammatory networks but those of TNFa, IL-1b, TLR2, NFkB, IL10 and COX-2 were increased (Supplementary Figure S15) . Furthermore, we calculated the local network entropies of these proteins at each time point in the inflammatory network that was induced by the H5N1 infection. Interestingly, the evolution processes of TNFa, IL-1b, TLR2, NFkB, CXCL10, IFN-c, IL10 and COX-2 are very similar but are exactly opposite to the evolution process of HDAC4 (Figure 9a ). The local network entropy of HDAC4 reached the smallest value at 12 h, while that of all other proteins reached the largest value at 12 h. Moreover, the fastest changes in the local network entropy occurred for all the proteins that varied from 7 h to 12 h. Noticed that the protein complex disappeared after 7 h, therefore, we may guess that the disappearing protein complex is possibly correlated with the change in other proteins' entropies. To further evaluate the effect of the entropy changes of these proteins on HDAC4, we calculated the Spearman correlation for paired proteins at the i-th (i 5 3, 4, 5, 6) time point by using the first i experiment data. Table 4 showed that strong negative correlations exist in the local network entropies between HDAC4 and other proteins. There are also specific correlations between local network entropies of HDAC5 and TNFSF10 and that of NFkB. To further assess the correlation between the disappearance of the protein complex and the change in the proteins' entropy, the Spearman correlations for the rate of change of the entropies between HDAC4 and other proteins were computed. Supplementary Table S20 showed the rate of change for the entropies of HDAC4 is much more negatively correlated with those of three proteins TNFa, NFkB and COX-2. In addition, their linear regressions were depicted in Fig. 9b , which further verified these negative correlations. Taken together, these data suggested a potential mechanism in which the disappearance of protein complex TNFSF10/HDAC4/HDAC5 in inflammatory networks is likely associated with coordinate interactions among TNFa, NFkB and COX-2. These results also showed that interesting biological mechanisms can be retrieved from the entropy changes. However, whether the sharp increase in the entropy of these three proteins is the cause or the consequence needs to be determined by further biological experiments.
