Airport sentinel surveillance following fever screening for dengue infection By implementing fever screening by NCITs at airports for the detection of febrile inbound passengers, which was confirmed by ear temperature readings, we obtained a fever prevalence that ranged from 0.08-0.10% (Table 1) among the total inbound passengers. Approximately 29.5-50.9% of the confirmed febrile inbound passengers coming from dengue-endemic areas, including Southeast Asia, South Asia, South America and Africa, were triaged by inspectors and underwent blood sampling for laboratory confirmation. Overall, 44.9% (95% CI: 35.73-54.13%) of the confirmed imported dengue cases with apparent symptoms were detected by the thermal screening program with a PPV of 2.36% (95% CI: 0.96-3.75%), an NPV of > 99.99% and a specificity of 99.97% (95%CI: 99.96-99.97%) ( Table 1) . From 2007-2010, a majority of the confirmed dengueinfected travelers were arriving from dengue-endemic regions in South or Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia (21.0-35.1%), Vietnam (20.1-32.0%), Thailand (5.0-13.0%), the Philippines (9.0-12.3%), Cambodia (4.1-8.0%), Malaysia (2.0-4.1%), Singapore (1.1-3.4%), India (0-1.1%) and South America (0-0.7%). Moreover, the cumulative numbers of the imported dengue cases that were detected at the airports (X) were found to be significantly associated with the total number of imported dengue cases (Y) using a linear regression analysis based on a biweekly surveillance from 2007-2011 (Y = 1.68X + 1.98 with a 95% CI of 1.42-1.95, R 2 = 0.61, n = 104, P < 0.0001; Y: biweekly total of the number of imported cases of dengue; X: biweekly number of the imported dengue cases that were screened at the airports) ( Figure 1A ). In an analysis of the respective year surveillance data, the biweekly association (n = 26) was demonstrated by an R 2 value that ranged from 0.
