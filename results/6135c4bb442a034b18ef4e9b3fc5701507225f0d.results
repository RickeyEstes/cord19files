Mice deficient in the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R2/2) are protected from weight loss after immunization with VSV vaccine vectors Mice immunized with recombinant VSV (rVSV) vaccine vectors lose weight rapidly after immunization. Weight loss is usually maximal by the second day after immunization but most animals recover, with weight returning to normal by five to seven days after immunization. Interleukin-1b (IL-1b) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that causes acute weight loss and fever in mice and humans [16, 17, 18] , and which stimulates the production of other pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 [17, 19] and prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2 ) [20, 21] . To determine whether IL-1 can contribute to the induction of acute pathology after administration of rVSV vaccine vectors, we immunized groups of C57BL/6 wild type (WT, n = 4) or IL-1 receptor deficient (IL-1R2/2, n = 3) mice with a single intramuscular injection of 5610 8 PFU live replication-competent rVSV. All animals survived the immunization, but wild type mice lost approximately 10% of their preimmunization body weight by the first day after immunization ( Figure 1 ) and did not fully regain their pre-immunization weight until eight days after immunization. In contrast, IL-1R2/2 mice had minimal pathology, losing only a small amount (,5%) of weight on the first day after immunization and returning to their starting weight by the second day after immunization. IL-1R2/2 mice lost significantly less weight than wild type control animals after challenge (P = 0.03 from day 1-day 4 after challenge, Mann-Whitney test). Because mice deficient in the IL-1R cannot respond to IL-1, this result demonstrated that either IL-1a or IL-1b, both of which bind to the IL-1R, contributed to acute pathology after rVSV immunization. Mice immunized with VSV vaccine vectors produce IL-1b systemically and at the injection site Both IL-1a and IL-1b are regarded as pro-inflammatory cytokines, but IL-1b rather than IL-1a has been more commonly associated with symptoms such as weight loss and fever that are induced by infection with a live virus or other immune stimulus [16, 17] . To determine whether intramuscular immunization with VSV vaccine vectors induced production of IL-1b in vivo we challenged wild type C57BL/6 mice with rVSV and used an ELISA to quantitate the amount of IL-1b produced locally (at the injection site and in the draining lymph node) and systemically (in the blood). As shown in Figure 2A -C, mice immunized intramuscularly with rVSV had accumulations of IL-1b in the blood, in the quadriceps muscle, and in the popliteal lymph node that drains the quadriceps at 12 and 24 hours after immunization with VSV rwt. These results confirmed that IL-1b was produced in vivo both locally and systemically after intramuscular rVSV challenge, and was consistent with the results of Poeck et al. who found that wild-type mice injected intravenously with rVSV had detectable levels of IL-1b in the serum at six hours after challenge [22] . Our results were also consistent with the hypothesis that IL-1b caused the acute pathology that occurs after immunization with rVSV vaccine vectors, and suggested that reducing the production of IL-1b after rVSV immunization might correspondingly reduce reactogenicity and other undesirable side effects of vaccination. Mice deficient in the IL-1R control rVSV replication, have normal cellular and humoral immune responses, and are immune to high dose re-challenge IL-1b causes some deleterious effects such as fever and anorexia, but has also been shown to contribute positively to the generation of adaptive immune responses induced by live virus infection [23] . The role of IL-1 in control of VSV replication has not been examined previously, and reports describing the role of IL-1 in control of other viruses in vivo are not in agreement. Because our ultimate goal is to be able to generate less reactogenic rVSV vectors by attenuating the host inflammatory response, it was important to determine whether IL-1 was required for the control of vaccine vector replication, generation of humoral and cellular immune responses, or to generate protection against rechallenge. To investigate these questions we intramuscularly immunized mice deficient in the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R2/2) with 5610 8 PFU of rVSV and measured viral loads, induction of antibody and T cell responses, and protection from rechallenge. As shown in Figure 3A , viral loads in the quadriceps muscle (injection site) were not significantly different between wild type and IL-1R2/2 mice (n = 3 per group) at 24 hours after infection, which is the peak of VSV replication in vivo. Also, virus was not detected 2) are protected from acute weight loss after intramuscular immunization with rVSV. Eight to ten week old female C57BL/6 mice were immunized with a single intramuscular injection to the left rear quadriceps of 5610 8 PFU of live replicating rVSV. Graph shows average percent initial weight by day for each group of mice beginning on the day of immunization (Day 0). IL-1R2/2 mice (n = 3) lost less weight and recovered more quickly than wild type (WT, n = 4) mice after immunization. The difference in weight loss was significant from day 1-day 4 after challenge (P = 0.03, Mann-Whitney test). This experiment has been performed two times with consistent results. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0046516.g001 in the blood of any infected animal. Those results demonstrated that IL-1 is not required for the control of VSV replication in vivo. As shown in Figure 3B , serum neutralizing antibody titers against VSV were not significantly different in IL-1R2/2 (n = 4 per group per timepoint) and wild type mice (n = 5 per group per timepoint) at any time after immunization. When we used an MHC Class I tetramer to measure CD8 T cell responses to an immunodominant H-2 K b -restricted epitope (N-RGYVYQGL-C) in the VSV N protein [24] , IL-1R2/2 mice had slightly fewer anti-VSV N specific CD8 T cells in the blood than did wild type animals ( Figure 3C ) at 14 and 28 days after immunization, although the difference was only statistically significant at 14 days after immunization (P = 0.03, Two-tailed T test). Finally, to determine whether these immune responses were sufficient to protect wild type and IL-1R2/2 mice from re-challenge with rVSV, we challenged all animals intranasally with 1610 8 PFU of rVSV at eight weeks after the primary infection. As shown in Figure 3D , pre-immune wild type and pre-immune IL-1R2/2 mice were fully protected from rechallenge, while naïve wild type animals (n = 7, open triangles, Figure 3D ), lost up to 20% of their pre-infection body weight. Two out of the seven naïve animals succumbed to infection. Together, these results indicated that IL-1 was not required either for the control of rVSV replication in vivo, or for the generation of protective anti-VSV immune responses. The results also supported the idea that suppressing the production of or response to IL-1b in response to rVSV vector administration would not render rVSV vectors unsafe or non-immunogenic. Mice deficient in inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC are partially protected from acute weight loss after immunization with rVSV vaccine vectors Because the ultimate goal of these studies was to devise strategies by which we could suppress IL-1b production and thereby reduce the pathology of rVSV vectors in vivo, we sought to determine the mechanism by which IL-1b was being produced in response to VSV. IL-1b is synthesized as an inactive precursor molecule (pro-IL-1b), which must be cleaved either intracellularly by endogenous protease caspase-1 [25, 26, 27] , or extracellularly by matrix metalloprotease 9 [28] or other neutrophil [29] and mast cell-associated proteases [30] to become biologically active. It was shown recently that murine bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) infected with VSV in vitro produce IL-1b via formation of an inflammasome composed of RNA helicase RIG-I, adaptor molecule ASC, and caspase-1 [22] . Because the authors did not test whether RIG-I, ASC, and caspase-1 were required to produce IL-1b in response to VSV in vivo we used caspase-1-deficient and ASC-deficient mice to determine the effects of the absence of these molecules on acute pathology after rVSV immunization. It was not practical to test RIG-I deficient mice for IL-1b induction, because RIG-I deficient mice do not produce IFN in response to VSV and therefore rapidly succumb to infection [31] . We challenged ASC-deficient mice (ASC2/2) and wild type C57BL/6 mice intramuscularly with 5610 8 PFU rVSV as in Figures 1, 2 , and 3 and measured production of IL-1b and acute pathology after immunization. As shown in Figure 4A , the systemic and local production of IL-1b was not significantly reduced in ASC2/2 mice relative wild type control mice immunized in parallel. Consistent with that result, and with our prediction that IL-1b induces acute weight loss after rVSV infection, ASC2/2 (n = 5) mice lost slightly less weight after rVSV challenge than did wild type C57BL/6 (n = 6) mice infected in parallel, with the difference only reaching statistical significance only on the second day after challenge (P = 0.004, Mann Whitney Test, Figure 4B ). A second experiment replicated these findings almost exactly, with ASC2/2 mice (n = 6) showing slightly enhanced protection relative wild type animals (n = 10, Figure S1 ). The difference in weight loss between wild type and ASC2/2 mice was small but highly reproducible, and ASC2/2 mice were never protected to the same extent as IL-1R2/2 mice. To confirm that observation, we infected the three groups in parallel (5610 8 PFU rVSV intramuscular). As shown in Figure 4C , IL-1R2/2 mice (n = 4) lost significantly less weight than wild type (n = 5) mice (days 1-4 after challenge P,0.05 via one way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison test) and recovered their pre-immunization body weight more quickly than either wild type or ASC2/2 mice. The difference in weight loss between IL-1R2/2 and ASC2/2 mice was significant on the first and second day after challenge (P,0.05 via one way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison test). Similar to the results obtained in IL-1R2/2 mice, ASC2/2 mice made equivalent humoral responses and slightly reduced cellular responses to VSV, and were fully protected from high dose rechallenge ( Figure 4D -F). Taken together, these results demonstrated that production of IL-1b in vivo after intramuscular rVSV immunization occurred independent of inflammasome adaptor molecule ASC. Because ASC deficient mice were not protected fully from acute pathology after rVSV immunization, strategies that suppress the function of ASC would be predicted to partially but not completely abrogate acute pathology after rVSV immunization. Mice deficient in caspase-1 are partially protected from acute weight loss after immunization with rVSV vaccine vectors Similarly, when we immunized mice deficient in caspase-1 (caspase-12/2) or wild type mice with 1610 9 PFU of rVSV, caspase-1 deficient mice did not have significantly reduced levels of IL-1b relative wild type mice ( Figure 5A ) when we measured IL-1b production at the injection site and in the draining lymph node by ELISA. Consistent with those data, caspase-1 deficient mice immunized intramuscularly with 5610 8 PFU of rVSV as in Figure 4B -C (n = 5 per group), were partially but not completely protected from acute weight loss ( Figure 5B ) relative wild type mice (n = 5), with the difference in weight loss between wild type and caspase-12/2 mice being significant only on days 2 and 3 after challenge (P,0.05, Mann Whitney test). Caspase-1 deficient mice controlled viral replication as well as wild type mice ( Figure 5C , n = 6 per group), with no significant difference in viral loads in the quadriceps muscle of infected animals at 24 hours after infection. As with IL-1R2/2 mice, no virus was recovered from the blood of infected mice. Caspase-1 deficient mice made robust humoral ( Figure 5D ) and cellular ( Figure 5E ) responses to VSV, which were not significantly different than those of wild type mice.
