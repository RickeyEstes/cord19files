The purpose of this study is to generate an optimal set of parameter estimates for each country through simulations. Each simulation generates a set of parameter estimates. The minimum mean standard error (MSE) is used as the selection criterion to determine which set of parameter estimates is optimal for that country. A comparison of the optimal sets is then possible, and impulse responses can be determined for prediction purposes. This process involves the methodology described below.
