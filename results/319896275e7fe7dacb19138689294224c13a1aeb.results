The ability of H5-HA to pseudotype lentiviral particles does not correlate with HA protein expression level in producer cells Similar to HA of other subtypes of influenza viruses, H5-HA is highly mutable as a result of antibody-selection pressure, leading to the rise of divergent H5N1 viruses that are categorized into various strains and clades [13, 14, 22] . To ascertain the flexibility and adaptability of H5pp production as an alternative approach for serological studies in the event of novel emerging H5N1 viruses, we sought to develop cladespecific H5pp and compared the ability of three other H5N1 viruses belonging to different clades to pseudotype lentiviral particles. H5-HA from clade 1 (H5Cam), clade 2.1 (H5Ind), clade 2.2 (H5Qin) or clade 2.3 (H5Anh) (see Table 1 ) was expressed in 293T cells together with lentiviral backbone plasmid to allow the production of H5-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (H5pp). Expression levels of H5-HAs in transfected 293T cells was monitored by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody directed against the C-terminal tag (Fig. 1A , upper panel). Supernatants containing H5pp were harvested 48 hr post-transfection, and used to transduce MDCK cells for luciferase reporter activity assay (Fig. 1A , lower panel), as described in Materials and Methods. Unexpectedly, we observed significant differences in the transduction of MDCK cells by H5pp, depending on the clades of H5-HAs. In particular, H5Anh from A/Anhui/2005/01 resulted in very low luminescence levels after particle transduction in MDCK cells; whereas H5Cam from A/Cambodia/40808/2005 was the most efficient, inducing a consistent 3-4 log increase in luciferase activity compared with H5Anh ( Fig. 1A -B, lower panels). Analysis of cell lysates by Western blots, however, demonstrated that all H5-HAs tested were well expressed in the producer cells and, consequently, that luciferase reporter activity in MDCK target cells did not correlate with the level of HA protein expression in the cells (Fig. 1A) . Two main protein bands were detected, consistent with the expected electrophoretic mobility of the uncleaved protein (HA0) and the C-terminal portion of the cleaved form (HA2 subunit), whereas the N-terminal fragment (HA1 subunit) could not be recognized by the anti-FLAG antibody due to C-terminal tagging (Fig. 1A) . We next decided to compare in detail the behaviour of H5Cam and H5Anh. To determine whether the difference in luciferase reporter activity was due to the level of H5pp production, culture supernatants containing H5Cam-pp and H5Anh-pp were concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and the resulting H5pp pellets were analyzed by Western blotting. Our results showed that the number of particles produced in the culture supernatant was significantly less for H5Anh than for H5Cam in presence of soluble bacterial neuraminidase, as indicated by lower levels of p24 in concentrated supernatants to detect the lentiviral core and lower luciferase reporter activities in MDCK cells (Fig. 1B) . More importantly, incorporation of H5Anh into the pseudotyped lentiviral particles was not observed using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1B, upper panel) . Altogether, these data suggest that H5Anh cannot be efficiently incorporated into pseudotyped particles and released into the cell culture supernatant. Swapping of HA2 domain (including the polybasic cleavage site) does not increase production of H5Anh-pp Sequence analysis of the polybasic cleavage site reveals that H5Anh has a deletion of a lysine residue when compared to H5Cam and moreover, there is an additional amino acid difference in the HA2 region at position 533, which is located at the border between the ecto-domain and the transmembrane domain (TMD) ( Fig. 2A) . Thus, H5Cam has an isoleucine at position 533 (I533), while H5Anh has a threonine (T533). Cleavage of HA into HA1 and HA2 subunits by host protease is a critical step for influenza viruses to gain membrane fusion capability [23, 24] ; whereas the TMD of HA is important for its association with lipid rafts at the plasma membrane [25] . To test the potential influence of these differences in the cleavage site and at position 533, we generated several chimerical constructs in which either the entire HA2 region including the cleavage site was replaced with that of H5Cam (AnhCam1), or only the cleavage site (AnhCam2) or a single T533I amino acid change was introduced (AnhCam3). All constructs were FLAG-tagged at the C-terminal end of H5 sequences as described in the Materials and Methods section ( Fig. 2A) . When transfected into 293T cells, all three mutant H5Anh proteins were well expressed in the producer cell lysates (Fig. 2B) ; however, analysis of transduction levels of MDCK target cells by H5pp produced with these H5AnhCam chimerical proteins suggests that none of them was able to increase the production of pseudotyped particles (Fig. 2C) . These data indicate that differences in the HA2 domain cannot account for the reduced ability of H5Anh to form pseudotyped particles. Two amino acid substitutions in the 130-loop of the receptor binding domain (RBD) are sufficient to confer H5Anh pseudotyping ability Sequence alignment of H5-HA proteins revealed a striking amino acid divergence at 9 positions over a short stretch of only 33-amino-acid-long region around the 130-loop of RBD (Table 1) , which accounted for over 30% of the amino acid differences found in the entire HA molecule (576 amino acids in length). Therefore this region was chosen for site-directed mutagenesis to generate a series of H5Anh mutants that were subsequently tested for their ability to pseudotype lentiviral vectors. The level of protein expression for all H5Anh mutants in producer cells was comparable, albeit slightly lower for AnhM1 and AnhM6 (Fig. 3A) . Interestingly, all H5Anh mutants that harbored residues alanine-valine at positions 133-134 (AnhM1-5, Table 1 ) displayed a largely restored ability of H5Anh to produce pseudotyped particles, despite other sequence differences at the 130-loop flanking region (Fig. 3B ). By contrast, AnhM6, which contains H5Cam-like 130-loop flanking sequences but serine-alanine at positions 133-134, did not generate efficiently H5Anh-pp in culture supernatant (Fig. 3B) . These data clearly demonstrate that amino acid residues at positions 133-134 are crucial for efficient H5pp production. More specifically, substitution of the two amino acids S133-A134 of H5Anh with A133-V134, which are unique to H5Cam sequence, confers H5Anh the ability to be incorporated into the lipid envelope of lentiviral particles and is essential for efficient production of transduction-competent H5Anh-pp. A single A134V mutation in the 130-loop of the RBD of H5-HA is the critical determinant for H5pp production To further delineate the respective roles of A133 and V134 for efficient pseudotyping, two additional H5Anh mutants were generated with a single amino acid substitution either at position 133 (S133A, AnhM7) or 134 (A134V, AnhM8) ( Table 1) . These experiments revealed that the A134V mutation was sufficient to confer H5Anh the ability to be incorporated into transductioncompetent pseudo-particles; whereas the S133A mutation was not (Fig. 4A) . We also generated reciprocal mutants of H5Cam that contained either the two residues found at positions 133-134 of H5Anh (viz., S133-A134; CamM1), or only one single V134A change (CamM2), or A133S substitution (CamM3) ( Table 1) . Again, the presence of valine at position 134 was found to be crucial for efficient H5pp production, whereas the A133S substitution had only a marginal effect, consistent with the results obtained with H5Anh mutants (Fig. 4A ). To confirm that the effect of valine at position 134 was indeed on the production of H5pp, we analyzed by Western blot both cellular lysates and culture supernatants containing H5pp that were concentrated by ultracentrifugation (Fig. 4B ). This series of experiments showed that incorporation of the ''Anhui-like'' single mutant CamM2 into the pseudotyped lentiviral particles was below the antibody detection limit, as also seen for wild-type H5Anh; whereas the ''Cambodialike'' single mutant AnhM8 induced H5pp production with an efficiency similar to H5Cam ( Fig. 4A-B) . Altogether, these experiments demonstrate that valine at position 134 (V134) is a critical residue for efficient H5pp production. The A134V mutation affects cell surface expression level of HA Because influenza virus, as well as particles pseudotyped with HA, buds from the plasma membrane [11, 18] , we reasoned that changes in surface expression of H5-HA could have an impact on the production of H5pp. Thus, we have compared by flow cytometry plasma membrane expression levels of HA protein in cells transfected with H5Anh and H5Cam. Cells were labelled with an anti-H5N1 antibody, fixed and then stained with a PEconjugated secondary antibody. As assessed by measuring mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), cell surface expression of H5Anh was significantly less compared to H5Cam ( Fig. 4C ; p,0.01). Interestingly, introduction of the A134V mutation into H5Anh (AnhM8) increased its cell surface expression ( Fig. 4C ; p,0.02), and conversely, a V134A mutation in H5Cam (CamM2) reduced transport to the plasma membrane to a level that was not significantly different from that measured with H5Anh (Fig. 4C ). These data demonstrate that the Ala to Val substitution at position 134 enhances surface expression of H5-HA.
