To determine the importance of residues A231 and D233 of 3D pol , we constructed 3 mutant replicons: D233A, A231C and the double mutant A231C/D233A ( Figure 1 ). The site and amino acid mutants we chose to study were obtained during a ribavirin resistance screen (data not shown). Moreover, we wished to determine the function of the conserved D233. Poliovirus luciferase replicons (kindly provided by R. Andino) consist of a luciferase reporter gene (either firefly or renilla) substituted, in frame, for the capsid region [16] . The renilla luciferase replicon was mutagenized 3 separate times for this study and the firefly replicon once. For mutagenesis, we used the Stratagene Quick Change Kit II. Double stranded DNA encoding the replicon along with the mutagenic primer pair was used as template and primers for pfu Ultra high fidelity enzyme. The mutagenic oligonucleotides consisted of a sense strand of 32-45 bases flanking the mutations and the complimentary oligonucleotide. For the mutagenesis reaction, target DNA and the mutagenic primers were thermocycled. In this strategy, both strands of the target are synthesized. The first cycle was 95°C for 30 sec. The following 16 cycles were 95°C 30 sec, 55°C 1 min and 68°C for 9 1/2 min (1 minute/kb). The products were then treat with Dpn I for 1 hr at 37°C to remove the unmutagenized bacterial DNA. The reaction products were then transformed into XLI Blue supercompetent cells and plated in the presence of X-gal and IPTG. A mutagenized β-galactosidase (Whitescript) was
