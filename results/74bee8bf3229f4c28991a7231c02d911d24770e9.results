All nasopharyngeal swabs samples from healthy volunteers were submitted to the six considered SARS-CoV-2 assays to check the generation of unspecific response. We observed consistent falsepositive results for N and N2 (60 out of 60 samples for both). N3 assay generated false positive signal or inconclusive results in 13 out of 60 tested samples. N2, N3, and N assays were not considered for subsequent experiments due to the lack of analytical specificity under our conditions (figure 1). .

This SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic synthetic RNA was quantified and a previously known copy number solution was spiked into negative swabs to construct positive samples as similar as possible from real clinical samples. These constructed samples were submitted to the automated workflow for assays that passed in the analytical specificity evaluation (N1, E, and RdRP). Limiting dilution of 1:2 (from 2.64x10 4 to 4.04x10 -1 copies/reaction) of the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic RNA was tested in order to evaluate the assays' limit of detection. Probit regression analysis returned the limit of detection of 21 (95% CI 16.5 -31.1) copies/reaction for N1, 141 (95% CI 109 -207) copies/reaction for E and 350 (95% CI 281 -508) copies/reaction for RdRP (Figure 1, B ). E and RdRP assay primer/probe concentrations were modified and limits of detection changed to 457 (95%CI 382 -598) and 33.7 (95% CI 27.6 -46.8) copies/reaction, respectively. Primers/probe concentration optimization did not interfere with specificity of the assays (20 healthy volunteers samples tested).
