Four children were excluded because of insufficient sampling frequency. For the asymptomatic condition, the criteria were the absence of respiratory symptoms (cough, sniffle or sore throat) and systemic symptoms (fever or rash) from one week before to two days after sampling. Of the 286 samples, 200 were from children who were asymptomatic (Fig. 1) . When RNA was EV/RV positive by real-time PCR but the viral VP4/VP2 region could not be amplified by semi-nested RT-PCR, we defined it as EV/RV untyped. The threshold cycle (Ct.) of real-time PCR is a relative measure of the concentration of the target in the PCR reaction. If the Ct. value of the EV/RV real-time PCR test is high (over 36.0), the nucleic acids cannot be amplified by the semi-nested PCR used for genotyping (data not shown). Of the 200 samples, 45 (22.5%) were real-time PCR positive. Four of the 45 positive samples contained two viruses. The prevalence of respiratory viruses among asymptomatic children varied from 9.1% (1/11) to 42.9% (15/35) and that in the symptomatic period ranged from 18.2% (2/11) to 57.1% (4/7) ( Table 2 ). The most frequently detected virus was RV genogroup A (RVA) (n = 10) ( Table 3) . EV/RV from 11 samples could not be genotyped. Two of the 4 samples with codetection contained RVC and adenovirus, one RVB and adenovirus, and one EV/RV untyped and hCoV 229E. Human PeV was detected in 8 samples. After hPeV was detected in a sample from a symptomatic child, it was subsequently detected for more than three weeks without any symptoms (Fig. 1, Child B) . In samples from symptomatic children, PIV, RSV and hCoV OC43 were detected in addition to the viruses detected in those from asymptomatic children (27/86; 31.4%). The most commonly detected virus was RVA (10/27; 37.0%). Among the 27 samples, 2 contained PIV and RVA. FluV, hBoV and hMPV were not detected.
