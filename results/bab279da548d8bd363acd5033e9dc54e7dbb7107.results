From January 2008 to December 2015, Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Xicheng District in Beijing recorded 1 294 279 ILI visits and a total of 41 269 165 clinic attendances. Percentage of number of ILI visits to number of total clinic attendances (ILI%) had been widely used as an indicator for influenza activities. 15 Figure 1A illustrates age-specific trends in weekly ILI% throughout 8 years. Peaks of influenza activities appear from end of December to middle of January across different age groups in the past years. Summer peaks were observed for groups of age 0-4 and 5-14 without a consistent annual pattern. During the winter school breaks, ILI incidence decreased substantially in age groups of 5-14 and 15-24, but modestly in age groups over 25 (figure 1B). During the summer school breaks, only ILI incidence in age group of 5-14 reduced dramatically, while levelled off for other age groups (figure 1B). A decline of schoolchildren-to-adults IRR during school breaks implied an age shift in patients with ILI towards adults, and further suggested a reduction of influenza transmission among schoolchildren. IRRs of younger schoolchildren aged 5-14 to adults was higher during winter school breaks than before breaks, while the opposite was true for the IRRs of older schoolchildren aged 15-24 to adults (table 1, figure 1C) . During summer breaks, schoolchildren-to-adults IRRs were significantly lower than those of 2-week before or after school breaks ( p<0.001). To be specific, IRRs of age 5-14 to age above 60 had declined by 13.3% (95% CI 3.59%, 22.1%). The above conclusion was robust when we considered a 4-week window before and after winter/ summer break (see online supplementary table S3). Since long-term trend and seasonal pattern of ILI visits could be two confounders in the previous analysis of IRRs, we used a Poisson regression model to assess the effect of school breaks on ILI incidence. The models generally well fitted the observed ILIs with adjusted pseudo Figure 1 Age-specific ILI incidence rates, adjusted average ILI incidence rates, adjusted average ILI IRRs of influenza surveillance data by week in Beijing, 2008-2015.

The upper plot is IRRs of age 5-14 to adults; the lower plot is IRRs of age 15-24 to adults. ILI, influenza-like illness; IRR, incidence rate ratio. R 2 values for the five age groups (0-4, 5-14, 15-24, 25-59 and 60 years or older) ranging from 0.44 to 0.56. After incorporating the autocorrelation within error terms, we estimated IRRs of during/after to before winter break and their CIs (table 2) . During-to-before IRRs were smaller than 1 for all age groups. However, the starting time and duration of the ILI reduction varied across different age groups. In age group of 15-24, ILI incidence dropped substantially by around 40% during the whole school break and lasted for 4 weeks thereafter. Declines of during-to-before IRRs for age groups of 0-4 and 5-14 were also observable but not necessarily smaller than declines in adults (table 2). For adults (age 25-59 and 60 years or older), ILI reductions were statistically significant in the second and third week of the break and lasted for about 2 weeks (table 2). Among all age groups, incidence of ILI visits returned to regular patterns with none of after-before IRRs statistically significant 3 weeks after the end of winter breaks (table 2) .
