Cyclosporin A Blocked HBV Infection. We focused on HBV entry and established a cell culture system to evaluate this step in HBV infection. To identify small molecules inhibiting HBV entry, we pretreated HepaRG cells 27 with compounds for 2 hours, then added a HBV inoculum and continued incubation with compounds for 16 hours (Fig. 1A) . After washing out free HBV and compounds, the cells were cultured for an additional 12 days in the absence of compounds (Fig. 1A) . For robust chemical screening, HBV infection was monitored by the viral envelope protein (HBs) level secreted from the infected cells at 12 days postinfection by ELISA. This assay could identify heparin, an HBV attachment inhibitor, 28, 29 and bafilomycin A1, a v-type H 1 ATPase inhibitor that blocks acidification of vesicles and HBV entry, 30 but not lamivudine, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, 31 as compounds reducing HBs protein level in the medium (Fig. 1B ). In addition, use of an anti-HBs antibody to neutralize viral entry, but not use of an anti-FLAG antibody, reduced viral protein secreted from the HBV-infected cells (Fig. 1B) . Thus, this system is likely to evaluate the effect of compounds on the early phase of the HBV life cycle, including attachment and entry, but not effects on HBV replication. A chemical screen with this system revealed that CsA reduced HBs secretion from HBV-infected cells ( (Fig. 1F ). The anti-HBV effect of CsA was also observed on HBV infection of PHHs in the absence of PEG8000 (Fig. S1B) , indicating that the effect of CsA did not depend on PEG8000, which was normally included in the HBV infection experiments. These data suggest that CsA blocked HBV infection. Effect of Cyclosporin A on HBV Entry. CsA decreased HBs and HBe secreted from the infected cells in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 2A) . We next investigated which step in the HBV life cycle was blocked by CsA. The HBV life cycle can be divided into two phases: the early phase of infection including attachment, entry, nuclear import, and cccDNA formation, and the following late phase representing HBV replication that includes transcription, assembly, reverse transcription, and viral release. 32 Lamivudine drastically decreased HBV DNAs in HepAD38 cells, 33 which reproduce HBV replication but not the early phase of infection (Fig. 2B ). In addition, continuous treatment with lamivudine as well as entecavir and interferon-a for 4 days after HBV infection could decrease HBV DNA levels in HBV-infected Hep-aRG cells, which suggests an inhibition of HBV replication (Fig. 2C) . Nevertheless, lamivudine did not show an anti-HBV effect when applied only prior to and during HBV infection (Fig. 1A,B) , suggesting that the anti-HBV compounds identified in Fig. 1A interrupted the early phase of the HBV life cycle. We then examined whether CsA inhibited attachment or entry. For evaluating HBV attachment, 34 cell surface HBV DNA was extracted and quantified from HepaRG cells exposed to HBV at 4 C for 3 hours and then washed ( Fig. 2D-a) . For the internalization assay, 34 the above cells, after washing, were further cultured at 37 C for 16 hours to allow HBV to internalize into the cells, and then trypsinized to digest HBV remaining on the cell surface to allow quantification of internalized HBV DNA (Fig. 2D-b) . CsA slightly reduced the amount of attached HBV DNA, although the effect was not statistically significant ( Fig. 2D-a) . In contrast, CsA caused a significant reduction of HBV DNA in the internalization assay ( Fig. 2D-b) . In the time of addition assay as shown in Fig. 2E , treatment with CsA during HBV infection decreased HBs and HBe production ( Fig. 2E-b) , while CsA did not have an anti-HBV effect when delivered after HBV infection (Fig. 2E-c) . Thus, CsA appears to primarily block the entry step including internalization. To examine whether CsA targeted HBV particles or host cells, we preincubated HBV with CsA and then purified the CsA from the HBV inoculum, followed by measurement of the HBV infectivity using HepaRG cells (Fig. 2F) . Preincubation with CsA did not affect HBV infectivity, in contrast to the antagonizing effect of heparin to HBV particles (Fig. 2F) , suggesting that CsA did not affect HBV particles but rather targeted host cells. Cyclosporin A Showed a Pan-Genotypic Anti-HBV Effect. We examined the anti-HBV effect of CsA on the infection of different genotypes of HBV into PHHs. As shown in Fig. 3A , CsA reduced the infection of HBV genotype A, C, or D, which differ in sequences from the virus strain used in all of the other figures. However, CsA did not affect the entry of HCV, in contrast to the inhibition of HCV entry by heparin, bafilomycin A1, or an anti-HCV E2 antibody (Fig. 3B) . Effect of Immunosuppressants on HBV Infection. CsA is used clinically as an immunosuppressant, such as in patients following liver transplantation. 13 We therefore investigated the activity of other immunosuppressants on HBV infection. Among the additional immunosuppressive drugs examined, only FK506 was able to suppress HBV infection (Fig. 4A) . CsA is known to have three major cellular targets: cellular cyclophilins (CyPs), calcineurin (CN), and transporters including MDRs and MRPs. 18 Although both CsA and FK506 can inhibit CN (Fig. 4B) , this activity was dispensable for the anti-HBV effect, as PSC833, a CsA derivative inactive for CN inhibition (Fig. 4B) , 18 could still inhibit HBV infection (Fig. 4C) . As PSC833 and FK506 did not bind to the active site of CyPs (Fig. 4D) , CyP inhibition is not likely to be responsible for the anti-HBV activity. CsA Blocked HBV Infection Through Targeting NTCP. Recently, NTCP was reported as a candidate entry receptor for HBV. 22 A transporter activity assay showed that CsA inhibited the activity of NTCP both in 293 (Fig. 5A) and HepG2 cells (Fig. 5B ) engineered to stably overexpress NTCP, as previously reported. 35 CsA was also suggested to bind to NTCP on the membrane in a ligand binding assay using HepG2-NTCP cells (Fig. S2) . NTCP messenger RNA (mRNA) was expressed in HepaRG cells and PHH, which are HBV-susceptible, while little to no expression was detected in HBVnonsusceptible cell lines including HepG2, Huh-7, FLC4, and nonhepatocyte HeLa cells (Fig. 5C ). In contrast, CyPA and CyPB were expressed in all of these cell lines, irrespective of infection susceptibility. Intriguingly, we found that the inhibition of NTCP transporter activity correlated with anti-HBV entry activity (Figs.  5A, 4A,B) . These results suggest the possibility that compounds targeting NTCP have the potential to block HBV infection. To test this prediction, we treated Hep-aRG cells with compounds known to inhibit NTCP, including ursodeoxycholate, cholic acid, propranolol, progesterone, and bosentan 35, 36 to investigate the effect on HBV entry using the protocol in Fig. 1A . As shown in Fig. 5D , these compounds inhibited HBV infection. Thus, inhibition of NTCP blocked HBV infection. We also showed that HepG2 cells overexpressing NTCP were susceptible to HBV infection (Fig. 5E) , as reported recently. 22 Treatment with CsA also reduced HBs and HBe secretion when these cells were infected with HBV (Fig. 5E) , suggesting that CsA inhibited NTCPmediated HBV infection. The binding of the HBV large envelope protein (LHBs) to NTCP was reported to be important for HBV entry. 22 Thus, one mechanism by which compounds that directly inhibit NTCP activity may block HBV entry is interruption of the binding between NTCP and LHBs. To test this possibility, we established an AlphaScreen assay to evaluate LHBs-NTCP binding in vitro as described in the Materials and Methods. In vitro synthesized NTCP and LHBs were at least partially functional, as NTCP bound to its substrate TCA (Fig.  S3A) and LHBs could neutralize HBV infection into HepaRG cells (Fig. S3B) . As shown in Fig. 5F , incubation of recombinant NTCP with LHBs but not middle (MHBs) and small envelope protein (SHBs) produced a significant AlphaScreen signal ( Fig. 5F-a, left) indicative of a direct protein-protein interaction. In contrast to NTCP, recombinant GST or other nonrelevant proteins, LCK and FYN, 37 did not produce a binding signal when incubated with LHBs ( Fig. 5F-a) , suggesting that our AlphaScreen assay produced a specific signal for the interaction of NTCP with LHBs. Consistent with the report that the pre-S1 region of LHBs was important for the binding to NTCP, 22 the signal was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of pre-S1 lipopeptide HBVpreS/2-48 myr , 5 (Fig. 5F-b) but not of an inactive mutant of pre-S1 (Fig. S3C) , indicating a competition of pre-S1 with LHBs for NTCP binding. In this assay, CsA as well as FK506 and a CsA derivative, SCYX1454139 (see the next section), were shown to reduce the signal for LHBs-NTCP binding in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 5F-c,d,e) . These results suggest that CsA targets NTCP and thereby inhibits the interaction between LHBs and NTCP. Identification of CsA Analogs Possessing a Higher Anti-HBV Potential. Considering CsA as a lead compound, we tested CsA analogs for anti-HBV activity. As shown in Fig. 6A , SCYX618806 reduced HBs secretion after HBV infection, while a related analog SCYX1774198 did not have a significant anti-HBV effect (Fig. 6A,C) . Additional analogs, SCYX827830 and SCYX1454139, had significant anti-HBV activities (Fig. 6A,C) . Alisporivir (Debio 025), an anti-HCV drug candidate, 38 also decreased HBV infection to the equivalent level to CsA (Fig. 6B) . Figure 6D shows a dose-dependent reduction of HBs secretion by treatment with SCYX618806, SCYX827830, and SCYX1454139, all of which had more potent anti-HBV activities than CsA (compare Fig. 6D with Fig.  2A) . These results indicate that anti-HBV activity is not disrupted by at least some changes to the 3glycine, 4-leucine, and 8-alanine residues of CsA, although additional analogs will need to be evaluated for a full understanding of the structure-activity relationships. Notably, SCYX618806 and alisporivir bear modifications on the 4-leucine residue of the CsA backbone that prevent CN binding and immunosuppressive activity (Table S1 ), further confirming that anti-HBV activity does not require immunosuppressive activity. Notably, SCYX1454139 showed the strongest anti-HBV entry activity among 50 CsA derivatives examined (data not shown and Fig. 6E ). The median inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) for anti-HBV activity as well as CC 50 s determined by an MTT-based cell viability assay are shown in Fig. 6E . The IC 50 and CC 50 of SCYX1454139 were 0.17 6 0.02 and >10 lM, respectively, a profile superior to that of CsA (IC 50 and CC 50 of 1.17 6 0.22 and >10 lM, respectively). Inhibition of HBV infection by treatment with SCYX1454139 was also observed in PHHs, in which also the anti-HBV effect of SCYX1454139 was more remarkable than that of CsA (Fig. 6F) . These results clearly indicate that analogs of CsA may include compounds with greater anti-HBV potency than that of CsA itself.
