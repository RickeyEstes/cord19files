Influenza like Illnesses (ILI)-related claims data provide higher spatial and temporal resolution into ILI-case counts within the US One of the primary goals for our study was to quantitatively assess the timeliness and coverage (both in space and time) of the IMS Health claims data. As part of this exploratory study, we extracted the data as described in the Methods section and compared this data with CDC ILINet and GFT datasets. Note that both CDC ILINet and GFT data are known to be correlated [14, 18] , however both datasets correspond to different modalities. While the CDC ILINet data is primarily focused on out-patient visits, GFT uses search patterns of users to identify patterns of influenza occurrence. In spite of the differences in data collection and curation, we hypothesize that the IMS Health claims data, based on the case definition used in this current study will closely match the temporal trends observed from the CDC ILINet and GFT data.
