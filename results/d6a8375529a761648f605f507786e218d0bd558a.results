A total of 72 dogs presented with diarrhoea were tested for the presence of CPV antigen. Out of this number, 61.11% tested positive (44/72). Different breeds of dogs were tested. Rottweilers recorded the highest percentage of positive cases of 87.50% (7/8), followed by the Boerboels and Mixed Breeds with positive cases of 69.23% (9/13) and 54.55% (18/33) respectively. The lowest percentage of positive cases was recorded in the Bull mastiff with 41.67% (5/12) as shown in Figure 2 . CPV was also detected in Shi Tzu, German Shepherd, Bordeaux and English Mastiff. No local breed was presented to the clinic with symptoms described for CPV during the study period. Regarding sex predisposition, males recorded a higher percentage of positive cases (61.54%; 24/39) than females (60.61%; 20/33). The dogs tested were divided into two age groups: <6 months old and >6months old. Puppies below 6 months recorded a percentage of 65.67% (44/67) positive cases whereas no positives were recorded in dogs older than 6 months (0/5). Out of 24 unvaccinated dogs that were presented, 17 were positive (70.83%), while 27 out of 48 vaccinated dogs presented were also positive (56.25%) for CPV antigen. CPV antigen was detected in both categories of dogs with and without haemorrhagic diarrhoea. 15 out of 30 dogs presented without haemorrhagic diarrhoea tested positive representing 50% and 29 out of 42 (60.05%) presented with haemorrhagic diarrhoea also tested positive.
