Genome-wide 3′-tiling microarray to identify differentially expressed genes in F. graminearum harboring FgV1-DK21 The virus-infected F. graminearum exhibited strong inhibition of mycelia growth as well as reduced levels of DON at 7 days after inoculation ( Figure 1 ). To visualize how gene expression patterns were affected at different time points, we generated scatterplots ( Figure 2 ). Radial growth was measured on PDA 120 h after inoculation. b The number of spores was measured in CMC broth at 25°C for 9 days. The number of spores indicated represents the number per 1 ml. Data were described previously [6] . c Production of deoxynivalenol and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol. For toxin analysis, all strains were grown in minimal medium supplemented with 5 mM agmatine and incubated for 7 days. d N/D: not detected. * The value is significantly different than that of the virus-free isolate as determined by a Student's t-test. Interestingly, the scatterplots showed that there were no significant differences in the number of differentially expressed genes between 36 h and 120 h; however, it appeared that the changes in gene expression at 120 h were somewhat more extensive than those at 36 h ( Figure 2 ). To identify differentially expressed genes, we first performed hierarchical clustering, which identified gene sets of significantly differentially expressed genes at Figure 2 Differentially expressed F. graminearum genes during FgV1-DK21 infection identified by microarray. Scatterplots of normalized signal intensities 36 h (A) and 120 h (B) after inoculation with FgV1-DK21 as compared to virus-free samples. All signal intensities were converted to a log10 scale. The diagonal lines indicate a two-fold change. The Venn diagram illustrates the total number of genes that were significantly differentially expressed at 36 h and 120 h (C), down-regulated genes (D), and up-regulated genes (E). The heat map shows the expression patterns of 384 genes that were hierarchically clustered and differentially expressed at both 36 and 120 h (F). Red and green indicate upregulation and down-regulation, respectively. two different time points (Additional file 1: Table S1 and Additional file 2: Table S2 ). Most of the identified genes showed at least two-fold differential expression. A total of 1775 genes, representing 13.3% of 13,382 genes, were differentially expressed at both time points ( Figure 2C ), with 1109 (5.4%) and 1050 genes (5%) identified as differentially expressed at 36 h and 120 h, respectively ( Figure 2C ). Moreover, 384 genes (3%) were differentially expressed at both time points ( Figure 2C ). We further analyzed the lists of differentially expressed genes according to those down-regulated vs. those upregulated ( Figure 2D , E). Genes with an adjusted P-value less than 0.05 were selected as differentially expressed genes. In both time points, 940 genes (7%) were downregulated whereas 904 genes (7%) were up-regulated ( Figure 2D , E). Among the down-regulated genes, there were more differentially expressed genes at 120 h (561 genes) than at 36 h (499 genes) ( Figure 2D ). In contrast, more genes were induced at 36 h (610 genes) than at 120 h (489 genes) ( Figure 2E ). Moreover, 120 genes and 195 genes were commonly found in the group of downregulated and up-regulated genes, respectively ( Figure 2D , E). We then investigated the expression patterns of 384 genes that were differentially expressed at both time points using hierarchical clustering, which sorted the genes into four groups according to expression patterns ( Figure 2F ). Group A contained 36 genes that were highly downregulated at 36 h but were up-regulated at 120 h. In contrast, the 33 genes belonging to group B were highly induced at 36 h, and subsequently down-regulated ( Figure 2F ). Group C included 120 genes that were strongly repressed regardless of virus infection time, and group D contained 195 genes that showed consistently elevated gene expression across both time points. Representative genes showing significant expression change and real-time validation of the microarray data by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR Representative fungal genes that showed significant gene expression are listed in Table 1 . At 36 h, several genes encoding enzymes including phospholipase/carboxylesterase, polyketide synthase, eukaryotic aspartyl protease and dipeptidyl aminopeptidases were highly induced, whereas transcripts involved in transport, such as amino acid transporter permease and ABC transporter, were up-regulated at 120 h (Table 1 ). In contrast, several of the repressed genes at 36 h included maltose transporter, linoleate diol synthase, and genes with unknown functions, whereas those encoding ferric reductase and abhydrolase 3 were strongly repressed at 120 h (Table 1) . To validate the microarray data, we selected 20 genes whose expression was significantly affected in the host containing FgV1-DK21, as demonstrated by the microarray analysis, and determined their relative expression by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) ( Figure 3 and Additional file 3: Table S3 and Additional file 4: Table S4 ). Genes that showed diverse expression patterns were categorized into different functional classes (Figure 3 and Additional file 3: Table S3 ). The results of the qRT-PCR were highly consistent with those of the microarray data. For example, according to the qRT-PCR and microarray results, the transcript levels for three genes, including FGSG_01379, FGSG_03143, and FGSG_03911, were highly reduced at both 36 h and 120 h, whereas FGSG_03788, FGSG_00023, FGSG_07804, FGSG_07801, and FGSG_13222 were strongly induced regardless of the time point ( Figure 3A -C). When the mRNA level of a gene is too low to quantify, or the P-values from the microarray data are very high, it is highly likely that qRT-PCR results will not correlate with microarray data, as was observed for FGSG_11119 and FGSG_04089 ( Figure 3A ). As compared to the microarray approach, qRT-PCR offers a highly sensitive technique for detecting low amounts of transcripts and provides the transcript level for the gene of interest. For example, the expression intensities for 11 genes were relatively low, ranging from 0 to 2.97 ( Figure 3A ), whereas the amount of mRNAs for NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenases (FGSG_07801) and dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (FGSG_13222) were very high and ranged from 4424.26 to 5254.08, particularly in the host containing FgV1-DK21 at 36 h ( Figure 3C ). FunCat classification for an overview of the transcriptional reprogramming of F. graminearum harboring FgV1-DK21 We subjected a total of 1775 differentially expressed genes to functional catalogue (FunCat) annotation to gain insight into their functional classifications [29] . Specifically, we divided differentially expressed genes into four groups (Table 2 ). More than half of the differentially expressed genes were not assigned to any functional category. Specifically, 344 genes (71.9%) in the group of down-regulated genes at 120 h were unclassified. Of the functional categories, the vast majority of differentially expressed genes were associated with metabolism ( Table 2 ). Note that 118 genes (28.2%) were downregulated while 81 genes (22.9%) were up-regulated at 36 h, whereas there were more up-regulated genes (95) than down-regulated genes (79) at 120 h. Based on the number of differentially expressed genes, it is likely that genes involved in various metabolic pathways were severely repressed at 36 h and then were gradually induced at 120 h. Along with a gene set for metabolism, genes associated with energy were highly down-regulated (26 genes) at 36 h (Table 2 ). In contrast, genes involved in transcriptional and translational machinery were dominantly up-regulated early after FgV1-DK21 infection. For example, genes associated with the cell cycle and DNA processing (21 genes), transcription (46 genes), protein synthesis (35 genes), protein fate (18 genes), and those encoding proteins with binding function (81 genes) were highly upregulated at 36 h. The number of down-regulated genes associated with cellular transport at 36 h was almost twice that of up-regulated genes. Conversely, the number of upregulated genes that govern cellular transport was similar to that of the down-regulated genes at 120 h.
