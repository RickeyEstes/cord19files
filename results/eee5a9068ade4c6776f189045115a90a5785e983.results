The nucleotide sequences of the complete N gene, the partial S gene and the region from the p4.7 to p12.7 genes of two positive samples (11V11708/IRL/2011 and 13V08313/IRL/2013) were determined. The nucleotide identities of the N and S genes of the two Irish ECoVs were 99.8% (1338/1341 nucleotides) and 99.5% (650/653 nucleotides), respectively. The nucleotide identities of the N gene of the two Irish ECoVs and the ECoVs from other continents are summarised in Table 2 . Phylogenetic analysis was performed for the nucleotide sequences of the complete N and partial S genes (Figure 1 ). The analysis for the N gene showed that Irish ECoVs were independently clustered although they were closely related to Japanese viruses identified after 2009. In the phylogenetic tree of the S gene, Irish ECoVs were closely related to all other ECoVs analysed. The length of the region from the p4.7 to p12.7 genes in the two viruses was 544 base pairs. Compared with NC99, Irish ECoVs, had a total of 37 nucleotide deletions within p4.7 and the non-coding region following the p4.7 gene. Compared with Obihiro 12-1 and 12-2, Irish ECoVs had a three-nucleotide insertion. When compared with Tokachi09, the Irish ECoVs had a 148-nucleotide insertion (see Figure S1 ). The p12.7 gene of the two Irish ECoVs did not have deletions or insertions, and the nucleotide identities were 98.8-99.7% between these viruses and the other ECoVs (NC99, Tokachi09, Obihiro12-1 and Obihiro12-2).
