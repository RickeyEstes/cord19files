In order to study resistance development against CatB/CatL inhibitors, we used a VSV-EBOV chimeric virus encoding firefly luciferase and eGFP ( Figure 1A ) and examined inhibition by the CatB and/or CatL inhibitors MDL28170, CA-074, and CatL inhibitor III. CA-074 is largely specific for CatB while MDL28170 and CatL inhibitor III inhibit both CatB and CatL [26, 30, 31] . Vero E6 cells were chosen for experimentation since this cell line allows for efficient replication of EBOV and has previously been used to study inhibition of EBOV-GP-driven entry by CatB/CatL inhibitors and the development of viral resistance against these inhibitors [17, 29, 32, 33] . Preincubation of Vero E6 cells with these inhibitors followed by infection with VSV-EBOV universally resulted in efficient and dose-dependent inhibition of infection, with IC50 values of 1.3 µM (CatL inhibitor III), 2.2 µM (MDL28170), 16.1 µM (CA-074) ( Figure 1B) . Moreover, MDL28170 and CatL inhibitor III reduced VSV-EBOV infection to background levels when applied at 10 µM without eliciting unwanted cytotoxicity ( Figure 1B,C) . In contrast, 20 µM of CA-074 reduced VSV-EBOV infection by only 70% and caused measurable cytotoxic effects, although it should be stated that VSV infection was not affected at this concentration ( Figure 1B,C) . The lack of unspecific VSV inhibition despite measureable cytotoxicity might result from differences between incubation periods: Infection efficiency was measured at 18 h after addition of compound while cytotoxicity was measured at 24 h after addition of compound. In sum, we defined experimental conditions under which EBOV-GP-but not VSV-G-driven entry was blocked by CatB/CatL inhibitors in a concentration-dependent manner. MDL28170 was selected for further analysis because this compound caused a dose-dependent inhibition of VSV-EBOV over a broader range of concentrations (1.25-40 µM) than CA-074 (10-80 µM) or CatL inhibitor III (1.25-10 µM), while it did not have any non-specific side-effects on cell viability and infectivity of VSV up to a concentration of 40 µM. In order to determine how EBOV-GP can acquire resistance against MDL28170 the experimental setup depicted in Figure 2 was chosen. First, VSV-EBOV was passaged 5 times in Vero E6 cells in the presence of 20 µM MDL28170, the concentration that reduced VSV-EBOV infection by~99.5% without causing unwanted cytotoxic effects. Then, MDL28170 sensitivity of passaged and control virus was analyzed and the GP sequences were determined ( Figure 2 ). [purple], and CatL inhibitor III [orange]) or DMSO (control) before cell viability was quantified. Presented are the combined data of three independent experiments for which the viability of control-treated cells was set as 100%. Error bars indicate SEM. Statistical significance of differences in cell viability between control-and inhibitor-treated cells was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's posttest (p > 0.05, not significant [not indicated]; *, p ≤ 0.05; **, p ≤ 0.01; ***, p ≤ 0.001). MDL28170 was selected for further analysis because this compound caused a dose-dependent inhibition of VSV-EBOV over a broader range of concentrations (1.25-40 µM) than CA-074 (10-80 µM) or CatL inhibitor III (1.25-10 µM), while it did not have any non-specific side-effects on cell viability and infectivity of VSV up to a concentration of 40 µM.

Then, MDL28170 sensitivity of passaged and control virus was analyzed and the GP sequences were determined ( Figure 2 ). In the absence of MDL28170, control virus (passage 0, P0) and passage 5 virus replicated with comparable kinetics in control-treated cells ( Figure 3A ). In contrast, passage 5 virus replicated more efficiently in the presence of MDL28170 as compared to WT virus ( Figure 3A ), indicating that passaging was associated with MDL28170 resistance, most likely due to the acquisition of mutations. Indeed, sequencing revealed that passaging was invariably associated with emergence of amino acid substitution V37A and in some cases also S195R ( Figure 3B ,C).

The introduction of V37A and S195R into EBOV-GP did not interfere with robust GP expression in transfected cells ( Figure 4A ) and incorporation into VSV particles ( Figure 4B ). Moreover, both mutations did not alter EBOV-GP-driven entry into cell lines of fruit bat (natural reservoir, EpoNi/22.1), macaque (animal model, LLC-MK2), African green monkey (animal model, Vero E6), and human (accidental host, 293T) origin ( Figure 4C ). In addition, the GP2 subunit contains the internal fusion loop (IFL, green), two heptad repeat domains (HR1, light brown and HR2, dark brown) and the transmembrane domain (TMD, dark grey). Highlighted below the scheme are the regions in EBOV-GP, in which amino acid substitutions were detected within this study. The amino acid sequence of EBOV-GP from P0 VSV-EBOV is shown in the first row, followed by the corresponding sequences obtained after five passages in untreated (no inhibitor, control) or cathepsin inhibitor-treated (MDL28170) Vero E6 cells (dots indicate identical amino acid residues compared to P0 and the letters "a", "b", and "c" refer to independent experiments.

V37A conferred resistance against MDL28170, CA-074, and CatL inhibitor III while S195R failed to confer or enhance resistance when tested alone or in combination with V37A, respectively ( Figure 5 ). Thus, a single amino acid mutation, V37A, rapidly arises upon passaging of VSV-EBOV in the presence of MDL28170 and confers resistance against this and related inhibitors.
