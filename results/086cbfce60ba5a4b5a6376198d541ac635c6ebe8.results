The group with highest surviving median values was E1 (see Fig. 1 and Table 2 ), amounting two times the survival median in comparison with the CUCH and CUUCH groups (P = 0.007). Also, a statistical difference was found in terms of survival means in favor of group E1 as compared to group E2. Total basal hemocyte counts had mean values that ranged from 9752 ± 1402 to 11 288 ± 1398 ± 1SD with no statistically significant difference among groups. As the trial progressed values in all groups except the CUUCH group, showed a steady decay in the mean number of total hemocytes. However, no statistically significant difference among them was detected (see Table 3 ). Macroscopic lesions observed in dead shrimps in the glycyrrhizic acid-treated group (E1) were limited to some shrimps with antenna and uropods lightly reddened. Other changes were unnoticed. Group E2 showed reddening of antenna, full gut and some shrimps were flaccid, slightly darkened and grooved, as if affected with a very mild form of WSSV. Lesions in shrimp challenged with WSSV and not treated (CUCH group) were characterized by reddening of antenna, and guts were found empty and most of them grooved, as characteristic of WSSV. For the CUUCH group macroscopic lesions were not specific and unrelated to WSSV. Histological results from mortality showed that CUCH shrimp had hypertrophied nuclei of the ectodermic cells with heterophilic nuclear inclusions that were also found in antennal gland cells and in the epithelial cells of the stomach. In this latter organ some few cells were clearly necrotic. The lymphoid organ showed karyorrhexis in some cells and basophilic inclusion bodies within the nucleus. These lesions comply with white spot syndrome. There were no microscopic lesions related to WSSV in shrimps treated with glycyrrhizic acid as in group E1, or in the untreated-unchallenged group. Group E2 did not present necrotic cells, and the nuclear inclusions were considerably less abundant.
