Upon hydrolysis of β-keto ethylesters, ethanol is released and a β-keto acid is formed. Afterwards the acids can decarboxylate to carbon dioxide and acetophenone. A small amount of Table 2 . Enzymes for screening. For comparison of enzyme activity equal protein concentrations (mg/mL) were used. The concentrations of all hydrolase solutions were determined by Bradford assay. Stock solutions of hydrolases were 10 mg/mL. All enzymes but pNB-Est13 were were purchased comerially. pNB-Est13 was hetrologous expressed in E. coli.
