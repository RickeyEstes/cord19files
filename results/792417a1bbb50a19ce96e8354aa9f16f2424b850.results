We recruited nine patients with septic shock. Table 1 shows mean RBC thermal fl uctuation and SOFA scores. Conclusion RBC thermal fl uctuation analysis allows variations in RBC elasticity during sepsis to be quantifi ed at a cellular level. We could not identify any specifi c trend between sepsis severity and erythrocyte elasticity. Cells demonstrated both increases and decreases in fl uctuation independent of SOFA score. This is contrary to current evidence that suggests RBC deformability is reduced during sepsis. Reference Introduction Whole blood experiments suggest that cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) causes red blood cell (RBC) trauma and changes in deformability that may contribute to postoperative microcirculatory Introduction Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)/ lipocalin2, known as a sensitive biomarker of acute kidney injury, prevents bacterial iron uptake, resulting in the inhibition of its overgrowth [1] . We previously demonstrated that this protein was discharged into gut lumen from crypt cells in septic conditions, and inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli [2] . However, it remains unclear which pathway is associated with the upregulation of NGAL. We therefore designed the present study to reveal whether the patternrecognition receptor of bacteria, the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, plays a pivotal role for NGAL secretion from gut crypt cells. Methods With our institutional approval, the ileum and colon of male C57BL/6J mice (6 to 7 weeks) were everted and washed by Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ free PBS buff er fi ve times. Tissues were incubated with Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ free PBS containing 30 mM EDTA for 1 hour to isolate crypt cells of gut. The cell suspension was fi ltered through a cell strainer (40 μm) twice, and deposited the crypt cells by centrifugation at 700×g. The isolated crypt cells were resuspended in PBS and stained with 0.25% amido black for labeling paneth cells. The 5×10 5 crypt cells were resuspended in 50 ml HBSS containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The crypt cells were incubated at 37°C with or without TLR ligands: lipopolysaccharide (TLR4 ligand, 10 μg/ml) and CpG-DNA (TLR9 ligand, 8 μg/ml). After a 2-hour incubation period, the crypt cells were deposited and eluted mRNA to measure the expression of both NGAL and TLR mRNA using real-time PCR. Results More than 70 to 80% of collected cells were stained by amido black. LPS signifi cantly upregulated the expression of NGAL and TLR4 mRNA in ileum and colon crypt cells (P <0.05). Although the CpG-DNA did not upregulate NGAL and TLR9 mRNA in ileum crypt cells, the apparent expression of NGAL and TLR9 mRNA was found in colon crypt cells (P <0.05). Conclusion Bacterial stimulation of TLR4 and TLR9 pathways plays a pivotal role in the expression of NGAL mRNA in gut, suggesting that NGAL, derived from gut crypt cells, could contribute to the regulation of the intraluminal microfl ora in the critically ill. References Introduction Most individuals infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 infl uenza A virus (IAV) (H1N1pdm) experienced uncomplicated fl u. However, in a small subset of patients the infection rapidly progressed to primary viral pneumonia (PVP) and a minority of them developed ARDS. Inherited and acquired variability in host immune responses may infl uence susceptibility and outcome of IAV infection. However, the molecular nature of such human factors remains largely elusive. Methods We report three adult relatives with the autosomal dominant GATA-2 defi ciency. P1 and his son P2 had a history of myelodysplastic syndrome and a few episodes of mild respiratory infections. They developed PVP by H1N1pdm which rapidly evolved to ARDS. They died at the age of 54 and 31, respectively. Results Patients were heterozygous for a novel R396L mutation in GATA2. Like other patients with GATA-2 defi ciency, the three relatives had absence of peripheral NK and B cells and monocytopenia. However a high number of plasma cells, which were found to be pauciclonal, were observed in peripheral blood from P1 during H1N1pdm infection. P1 and P2 had normal levels of immunoglobulins and IgG antibodies against common viruses. Microneutralization test showed that P1 produced normal titers of neutralizing antibodies against H1N1pdm and against the previous annual H1N1 strain. Our results suggest that a few clones of long-living memory B cells against IAV expanded in P1; and that these cells produced cross-reactive antibodies against H1N1pdm, similar to those recently described. During the fl u episode P1 had a strong increase of IFNγ-producing T cells and of IFNγ production. The Th1-related chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL9, as well as IFNγ, MCP-1 and IL-8, were strongly elevated in serum from P1 and P2 in the course of H1N1pdm infection. Conclusion GATA-2 defi ciency is the fi rst described Mendelian inborn error of immunity underlying severe IAV infection. Primary immunodefi ciencies predisposing to severe IAV infections may debut, even in adults without a history of previous severe infections. The massive IFNγ-mediated cytokine storm may explain the fatal course of H1N1pdm infection in our patients. Introduction Adenosine exerts anti-infl ammatory and tissue protective eff ects during systemic infl ammation. While the anti-infl ammatory properties may induce immunoparalysis and impede bacterial clearance, the tissue protective eff ects might limit organ damage. The eff ects of a common loss-of-function variant of the adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1 gene (AMPD1), which is associated with increased adenosine formation, in patients with sepsis are unknown. Methods In a prospective cohort, genetic-association study, the eff ects of the presence of the AMPD1 gene on immune function, multiorgan dysfunction and mortality in septic patients was studied. Pneumosepsis patients (n = 402) and controls without infection (n = 101) were enrolled. Results In pneumosepsis patients and controls, a similar prevalence of the 34C>T (rs17602729) mutation in the AMPD1 gene was found. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed a tendency of increased mortality in patients with the CT genotype, compared with patients with the CC genotype (OR 1.53; 95% CI 0.95 to 2.5). Moreover, carriers of the CT genotype tended to suff er more from multiorgan dysfunction, OR 1.4 (0.84 to 2.3) and 3.0 (0.66 to 13.8), for CT and TT, respectively (P = 0.07). In septic carriers of the CT genotype, the ex vivo production of TNFα by LPS-stimulated monocytes was attenuated (P = 0.005), Introduction Hypogammaglobulinemia has been frequently found in adult patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Furthermore, it seems that at least a low serum level of IgM is correlated with higher mortality in sepsis. The mechanisms of hypogammaglobulinemia in septic shock have not yet been explained. It has been hypothesized that outfl ow of immunoglobulins into the extravascular space due to increased capillary permeability could reduce immunoglobulin serum concentrations. Angiopoietin-2, which directly disrupts the endothelial barrier, is markedly elevated in sepsis and other infl ammatory states and its serum level has been correlated with microvascular leakage, end-organ dysfunction and death in sepsis. Methods In the prospective, noninterventional study, we assessed the correlation between the capillary leakage marker angiopoetin-2 and serum levels of IgG and IgM in 41 patients with community-acquired severe sepsis or septic shock on admission. Blood samples were obtained during the fi rst 12 hours after admission to hospital. Results Mean age of patients (17 females) was 70 years. Median APACHE II and SOFA scores at admission were 24 and 11, respectively. The mortality rate was 45%. Thirty-four percent of all patients had level of IgG <650 mg/dl. The median concentration of angiopoietin-2 in the hypo-IgG group was 11,958 pg/ml, which was not statistically diff erent (Mann-Whitney; P >0.05) than in the rest of patients with normal levels of IgG (15,688 pg/ml). The concentration of IgM <40 mg/dl was found in only four patients (10%) and all died. Pearson's correlation test showed that the correlation between the concentrations of angiopoietin-2 and IgG (correlation coeffi cient 0.191) or IgM (correlation coeffi cient 0.0408), respectively, were not statistically signifi cant (P <0.05). Conclusion At present the hypothesis that increased microvascular leakage is responsible for hypogammaglobulinemia in septic patients could not be accepted. Studies on larger number of patients are needed. In addition, it is necessary to further explore other possible mechanisms, such as increased catabolism and consumption of antibodies or inadequate synthesis of immunoglobulins, which could also be responsible for hypogammaglobulinemia in sepsis. In the open fi eld test, the CLP group showed a signifi cant decrease in total squares passed on days 10 and 30. Similarly, total numbers of rearing and grooming were dramatically decreased in the CLP group in comparison with control and sham groups (P <0.005). In the elevated plus maze test, the number of entries to open arms decreased in the CLP group. In the forced swim test, there was a tendency for increase in immobility time in the CLP group, although the data were statistically insignifi cant. All of these values which were indicating the importance of behavioral alterations were improved on day 60. Immunoglobulin therapy prevented the occurrence of these behavioral changes. Especially, animals in the IgGAM group conserved the values quite near to those of the control group in measured parameters. Conclusion Sepsis, even though it has been treated with conventional antibiotics, caused a negative eff ect on behavioral parameters. In this study, IgG and IgGAM treated animals in the presence of CLP did not show these behavioral changes. Therefore our results suggest that a single dose of i.p. IgG and IgGAM treatment, which was applied immediately after the sepsis procedure, prevents behavioral defects observed following sepsis. Introduction Thrombomodulin is an endothelial cell cofactor and glycoprotein for thrombin-catalyzed activation of protein C. A recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rhsTM) has been recently developed, and this new agent has a unique amino-terminal structure exhibiting anti-infl ammatory activity including sequestraction and cleavage of high-mobility group box 1(HMGB-1). Methods In this study, 13 patients with septic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) were treated with rhsTM, which is Recomodulin® Inj. 12800 (Asahi Kasei Pharma Co., Tokyo, Japan). Patients with septic DIC were treated with 130 to 380 U/kg/day. Results There were signifi cant results for improvement of APACHE II score and DIC diagnostic criteria score for critically ill patients after treatment using rhsTM (P <0.01). Improvement for platelet count and D-dimer level were also observed in this study (P <0.05). Activation of antithrombin (AT) also was signifi cantly increased after treatment (P <0.05). Hospital mortality was 15.4% in this study. Conclusion The rhsTM might be one of most important endogenous regulators of coagulation, acting as the major inhibitor of thrombin as well as AT III. This new agent may play an important role in treatment for septic DIC. Introduction Antithrombin III (AT III) has been known to contribute to anti-infl ammatory response as well as its anticoagulation. Our previous Introduction Sepsis and septic shock are complex infl ammatory syndromes. Multiple cellular activation processes are involved, and many humoral cascades are triggered. Presumably, endothelial cells play a pivotal rule in the pathogenesis of sepsis, not only because they may infl uence the infl ammatory cascade but also because, upon interaction with excessive amounts of infl ammatory mediators, the function of these cells may become impaired. It is likely that a general dysfunction of the endothelium is a key event in the pathogenesis of sepsis [1] . HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors have been shown to exhibit pronounced immunomodulatory eff ects independent of lipid lowering. Most of these benefi cial eff ects of statins appear to involve restoring or improving endothelial function [2] . We hypothesize that statins can improve endothelial dysfunction in septic patients. Methods A double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was undertaken. We enrolled adult patients within 24 hours of severe sepsis or septic shock diagnosis and randomized them to placebo or atorvastatin 80 mg/day for a short term. Endothelial dysfunction was assessed measuring plasmatic levels of IL-6, ET-1, VCAM-1 by ELISA and measuring fl ow-mediated vasodilatation of the brachial artery at basal, 24 and 72 hours after randomization. Results We studied 47 patients, 24 in the placebo group (mean age 52 ± 20 years, 29.1% male; APACHE II risk score 23.5 ± 7.3) and 23 in the statin group (mean age 49.5 ± 18 years, 53.4% male; APACHE II risk score 23 ± 6.9). The baseline characteristics of the placebo group were similar to statin patients as well as the mean length of stay in the ICU (8.6 ± 7.4 and 9.1 ± 8 days, respectively) and the time on vasopressors (49.3 ± 47.1 and 59 ± 91.1 hours, respectively). No signifi cant diff erence was observed on the temporal variation of biomarker levels (IL-6, VCAM-1, ET-1) between treatment and control groups. The intrahospital mortality rate was 26% in the statin group and 45% in the placebo group (P = 0.17). Introduction A novel sorbent hemoadsorption device for cytokine removal (CytoSorbents, USA) was developed and successfully tested in animal models of sepsis. The experience in the clinical setting is still limited to case reports. In this fi rst clinical trial, we tested the hypothesis that treatment with sorbent hemoadsorption could safely and eff ectively reduce cytokines in septic patients with acute lung injury (ALI). Methods Ventilated patients fulfi lling the criteria for severe sepsis and ALI were enrolled in this multicenter randomized, controlled, openlabel study comparing standard of care with or without hemoperfusion treatment. Primary endpoints were safety and IL-6 reduction. Treated patients underwent hemoperfusion at fl ow rates of ~200 to 300 ml/ minute for 6 hours per day for 7 consecutive days. The overall mean reduction in individual plasma cytokines for the control and treatment groups during the treatment period was calculated using a generalized linear model. Results Forty-three patients (18 treated, 25 control) completed the study and were further analyzed. Incidence of organ dysfunction at enrollment (treatment vs. control) was: septic shock (94% vs. 100%, P = 0.42), acute respiratory distress syndrome (67% vs. 56%, P = 0.33), and renal failure (39% vs. 24%, P = 0.54). During 115 treatments no serious device-related adverse events occurred. On average, there were no changes in hematology and other blood parameters except for a modest reduction in platelet count (<10%) and albumin (<5%) with treatment. Hemoperfusion decreased IL-6 blood concentration signifi cantly (-49.1%, P = 0.01), with similar reductions of MCP-1 (-49.5%, P = 0.002), IL-1ra (-36.5%, P = 0.001), and IL-8 (-30.2%, P = 0.002). The 28-day mortality (28% vs. 24% control, P = 0.84) and 60day mortality (39% vs. 32% control, P = 0.75) did not diff er signifi cantly between the two studied groups. Conclusion In this fi rst clinical study of a novel sorbent hemoadsorption device in patients with severe sepsis and ALI, the device appeared to be safe and decreased the blood concentration of several cytokines. Further research is needed to study the eff ect of the device on the clinical outcome of septic patients. response; and the changes of endotoxin and proinfl ammatory molecules. Methods Forty septic/septic shock patients with renal failure were enrolled in the study. All patients had preoperative endotoxin >0.6 level/units (EAA Spectral D) and were submitted to high-volume hemodiafi ltration (50 ml/kg/hour, Prismafl ex; Gambro) with a new treated heparin-coated membrane (oXiris; Gambro). At T0 (pretreatment) and T1 (24 hours) the main clinical and biochemical data were evaluated. All data are expressed as mean ± SD. One-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction was used to evaluate the data changes. P <0.05 was considered signifi cant. Results Table 1 presents the main results of this study. Conclusion In septic/septic shock patients with renal failure, CRRT with a new treated heparin-coated membrane (oXiris; Gambro) is clinically feasible, and has a positive eff ect on renal function and hemodynamics. An adsorbing eff ect on proinfl ammatory mediators may have a role in these results. These data and the trend toward a decrease of endotoxin during the treatment warrant further investigation. Reference Introduction Endotoxin, a component of the outer membrane of Gramnegative bacteria, is considered an important factor in pathogenesis of septic shock [1] . The aim of our study was to determine whether endotoxin elimination treatment added to the standard treatment would improve organ function in patients with septic shock. Methods Adult patients with septic shock who required renal replacement therapy (RRT), with a confi rmed endotoxemia, and suspected Gram-negative infection were consecutively added to the study within the fi rst 24 hours after diagnosis. All patients received full standard treatment for septic shock. Endotoxin elimination was performed using the membrane oXiris (Gambro, Sweden), a medical device for continued RRT with the unique feature of endotoxin adsorbtion. An endotoxin activity assay was used to monitor endotoxin elimination therapy at baseline (T0), 3 hours (T1), 12 hours (T2), 24 hours (T3), 48 hours (T4), and 72 hours (T5). Our key indicators were the improvement in hemodynamics and organ function, and decrease of endotoxin activity (EA) in blood. Continuous variables are presented as mean values with standard deviations. Results High EA level at baseline (0.74 ± 0.14 endotoxin activity units (EAU)) signifi cantly decreased during RRT with oXiris membrane to 0.46 ± 0.02 (T1), 0.34 ± 0.01 (T2), 0.4 ± 0.02 (T3), 0.46 ± 0.04 (T4), 0.35 ± 0.07 (T5) EAU (P <0.05). MAP increased from baseline 72 ± 14 to 81 ± 18, 76 ± 6, 77 ± 7, 83 ± 13, 87 ± 10 mmHg (P <0.05), and the mean norepinephrine use decreased from 0.23 ± 0.04 to 0.19 ± 0.02, 0.11 ± 0.01, 0.09 ± 0.01, 0.04 ± 0.01, 0.0 μg/kg/minute (P <0.05) at T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, respectively. The SOFA score had decreased from 14 ± 4 to 12 ± 2, 9 ± 3, 7 ± 3 points (P <0.05), and the procalcitonin level declined from 107 ± 123 to 45 ± 41, 29 ± 30, 17 ± 157 ± 1 ng/ml (P <0.05) at T0, T3, T4, T5. Conclusion RRT with oXiris membrane resulted in the eff ective elimination of endotoxins from the blood. The therapy was associated with an increase in blood pressure, a reduction of vasopressor requirements, and an improvement of organ function. The application of the endotoxin activity assay was useful for bedside monitoring of endotoxemia in ICU patients. Introduction Severe sepsis and septic shock remain the most serious problem of critical care medicine with a mortality rate of 30 to 55% [1] . Several studies have demonstrated positive eff ects of selective adsorption of LPS on blood pressure, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, endotoxin removal and mortality [2, 3] . The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effi ciency of using the selective adsorption of LPS, Toraymyxin -PMX-F (Toray, Japan) and Alteco® LPS Adsorber (Alteco Medical AB, Sweden), in the complex treatment of patients with severe sepsis. Methods Forty-six patients with Gram-negative sepsis in the postoperative period were enrolled into the study. Toraymyxin -PMX-F was used in the PMX-F group (n = 14), while Alteco LPS adsorption was used in the Alteco LPS group (n = 32). The clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1 . The SOFA score, PaO 2 /FiO 2 , procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), endotoxin activity assay (EAA) was noted before, 24 and 48 hours after the selective adsorption of LPS. Results At 48 hours after PMX-F, signifi cantly decreased PCT from 17.5 (5.0; 40.9) to 7.1 (4.8; 13.0) ng/ml, P = 0.028, decreased CRP from 180 (133; 286) to 132 (68; 155) mg/l, P = 0.015 and SOFA score from 7.0 (3,0; 8.0) to 6.0 (3,0; 7.0), P = 0.007. At 24 hours after Alteco LPS, signifi cantly decreased PCT from 8.7 (3.0; 25.9) to 4.8 (2.1; 10.0) ng/ml. The 28-day mortality rate was 14.2% (n = 2) in the PMX-F group and 31.3% (n = 10) in the Alteco LPS group. Introduction Corticosteroid (CS) therapy in sepsis remains controversial and was fi rst introduced in sepsis management for its antiinfl ammatory property. CS has found a role in septic shock amelioration with inconsistent outcomes. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) includes CS as a Level 2C recommendation in septic shock [1] . Adapting and practicing SSC guidelines vary between critical care units. Accordingly, a survey was conducted to elucidate the usage of CS for septic shock by UK critical care physicians (CCPs). Methods Following approval by the UK Intensive Care Society (ICS), the survey was publicised on the ICS website and its newsletter. Results A total of 81 intensivists responded to this online survey. Seventy-four (92.5%) CCPs prescribed CS only if the septic shock is poorly responsive to fl uid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. Six (7.5%) initiated CS at the same time as vasopressor therapy. None initiated CS for patients with severe sepsis. No CS other than hydrocortisone is being used. The most commonly used intravenous regimen is 50 mg 6 hourly (65%) followed by 50 mg 8 hourly (11%). Only 10% of CCPs would prescribe it by infusion. Less commonly used regimens were 100 mg 8 hourly (6%) and 100 mg 6 hourly (5%). Only 5% would consider adding fl udrocortisone. Prior to initiating CS, 5% of CCPs would perform a short synacthen test, while 94% would not. The majority (89%) of CCPs would stop CS after resolution of shock state or when vasopressor infusion is terminated whilst 11% after a fi xed duration. Withdrawal of CS also diff ered, in that 25% tapered/weaned steroids, 31% stopped it abruptly and 44% of CCPs would base their CS cessation pattern on the clinical context. Only 46% of CCPs believe that CS is benefi cial whereas 44% were unsure of the benefi ts in septic shock. Only 29 (36%) responders indicated that their critical care unit had a written protocol for CS in septic shock. Conclusion The perceptions, usage and cessation of CS in septic shock vary but do appear to have shifted in the last decade. A UK survey in 2003 identifi ed that only 60% of ICUs used CS for septic shock and over 22% perform a short synacthen test [2] . It appears that many intensivists are using CS for septic shock, despite confl icting outcome data. We all strive to practice evidence-based medicine but until we have a robust, reliable and methodical randomised control trial that attempts to resolve the CS debate, practice will remain diverse on this subject, as refl ected by our survey. References Introduction From December 2009 to December 2010, 47 patients in Scotland presented with confi rmed anthrax infection manifested by soft tissue disease related to heroin injection. These cases represent the fi rst known outbreak of a recently recognized form of anthrax, termed injectional anthrax, which appears to be associated with a high mortality rate (28% in confi rmed cases from the UK outbreak). While epidemiologic data from this outbreak have been published, no report has systematically described fi ndings in patients at presentation or compared these fi ndings in nonsurvivors and survivors. Methods To better describe injectional anthrax, we developed a questionnaire and sent it to clinicians who had cared for confi rmed cases during the outbreak. Completed questionnaires describing 27 patients, 11 nonsurvivors and 16 survivors, were returned. Results In preliminary analysis of categorical data, a signifi cantly (Fisher exact test) greater proportion of patients with compared with without the following fi ndings did not survive; history of alcohol use (P = 0.05); the presence of lethargy (P = 0.01), confusion (P = 0.03), nausea (P = 0.04), abdominal pain (P = 0.02), or the need for vasopressors (P = 0.002), oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or steroids (all P = 0.004) at presentation; and excessive bleeding at surgery (P = 0.01). Initial analysis of continuous data demonstrated that, compared with survivors at presentation, nonsurvivors had signifi cantly (one-way ANOVA) increased respiratory rate, percent neutrophils on complete blood count, hemoglobin, INR, C-reactive protein, and bilirubin and signifi cantly decreased temperature, systolic blood pressure, platelets, sodium, albumin, calcium (corrected for albumin), base excess and bicarbonate (all P ≤0.05). Conclusion The implications of the apparent diff erences noted between nonsurvivors and survivors in this survey of cases from the fi rst known outbreak of injectional anthrax require further study. However, these diff erences might inform the design of research during future outbreaks or of methods to identify patients most in need of anthrax-specifi c therapies such as toxin-directed antibodies. Introduction Based on the results of our previous studies [1] we have identifi ed clinical risk factors for the emergence of Gr(+) infections in our ICU and we have developed a new algorithm for combating them. The choice of the particular antibiotic drug is guided by additional risk factors for severity of illness and data on the infectious focus. The response to therapy and its duration are also stated. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effi cacy and safety of this preemptive approach. Methods A randomized prospective controlled trial was carried out from September 2010 to September 2012. Patients were submitted to block randomization and stratifi ed on the basis of their initial SAPS II exp score. Antibiotic therapy was started on the day of inclusion in the treatment group and only with proven Gr(+) pathogen in the control group. Initial data were gathered on demographics, diagnosis, proven risk factors for sepsis-related mortality, severity of infl ammatory response, ventilator-associated pneumonia and organ dysfunction. Dynamics of SIRS, CPIS and SOFA scores, subsequent infectious isolates, ventilator-free days, length of ICU stay and outcome were followed for each patient. Results A total of 170 patients were enrolled. No statistically signifi cant diff erences in their basal characteristics were found. The subsequent score values, length of ICU stay and the number of ventilator-free days were also comparable between groups. The majority of Gr(+) pathogens were isolated between 6 and 10 days of inclusion. No diff erences were found regarding the concomitant Gr(-) fl ora and the related antibiotic therapy. The new organ dysfunction severity was similar in both groups (P = 0.37). The in-hospital mortality was 26.2% in the treatment group versus 18.6% in the control group (P = 0.56). Signifi cant diff erences between the Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival were also not found (log-rank test P = 0.81). No major adverse reactions were observed. Conclusion The implementation of this new policy failed to reduce the degree of organ dysfunction severity and was not associated with signifi cant survival benefi t. Moreover, even though it did not reach statistical signifi cance, a second peak of Gr(+) isolates was observed as a possible complication of the preemptive therapy. Whether this approach could lead to vancomycin MIC creep or there could still be a niche for it later in the course of treatment and/or in nontrauma patients remains to be further explored. Reference Introduction Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baum) is a leading cause of septicemia of patients hospitalized in the ICU with high mortality rates. The aim of our study is to investigate the risk factors associated with A. baum bacteremia and its mortality rates. Introduction The French military hospital at the Kaboul International Airport (KaIA) base provides surgical care for International Force and Afghan National Army soldiers, and also local patients. The development of multiresistant bacteria (MRB) nosocomial infections has raised a major problem complicating the care of combat casualties [1] . The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of MRB carriage on admission to the ICU in this combat support hospital. Methods We used a prospective observation study on patients admitted to the French military ICU in KaIA over 3 months (July to September 2012). All hospitalized patients were assessed for the presence of colonization with MRB: nasal and rectal swabs were performed to identify, respectively, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and extended-spectrum β-lactamases bacteria (ESBLB). The following data were recorded for each patient on admission: demographic characteristics, bacteriological results, length of stay, type of previous hospitalization. Results Sixty-three patients were admitted. The mean length of stay (MLS) was 3 ± 3 days, and the mean age was 25 ± 14 (13 patients <15 years). Patients were hospitalized for combat-related trauma (74%), noncombat-related trauma, medical pathologies (10%), and postoperative care (8%). They were Afghans (92%) or westerners (8%). Swabs were not realized for eight patients. Forty-three percent revealed an ESBLB colonization: Escherichia coli (22 patients), Klebsiella pneumoniae (one patient), Acinetobacter baumanii (one patient). No patients were colonized with MRSA. Ten patients (16%) were directly admitted to the ICU, 12 (19%) had been hospitalized before admission, 39 (62%) were transferred after resuscitative and stabilization care in a level 2 unit. For the two last categories, the MLS (for previous hospitalization) was respectively 14 ± 28 days and 8 ± 6 hours. Among patients transferred after care in a level 2 unit, MLS was no diff erent between colonized and noncolonized patients: 8 ± 7 versus 9 ± 6 hours (P = 0.5, Mann-Whitney test). Conclusion In this study, prevalence of colonization with ESBLB at admission is very high, suggesting a high prevalence of MDR colonization in the local population in Afghanistan. It remains important to intensify the prevention policy against MRB cross-transmission in the deployed ICU. Critical Care 2013, Volume 17 Suppl 2 http://ccforum.com/supplements/17/S2 Introduction The aim of this study is to describe the clinical and epidemiological profi le of ICU patients receiving tigecycline (TGC) and to evaluate the potential benefi ts of TGC higher doses. Methods All patients admitted to our ICU between 1 June 2009 and 31 May 2012 who received TGC were evaluated. Cases were excluded when infections were not microbiologically confi rmed. Results Over the study period, 100 patients fulfi lled the inclusion criteria: 54 in the SD group (50 mg every 12 hours) and 46 in the HD group (100 mg every 12 hours). The SD group and the HD group were not signifi cantly diff erent in terms of age, severity of disease, duration of TGC therapy, rate of concomitant other active antibiotic use and of inadequate empirical antimicrobial therapy (IIAT) (P = NS). MDR A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae were the main pathogens isolated. The percentage of germs other than A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae was higher in the SD TGC group (P <0.01). Otherwise infections due to less susceptible germs (TGC MIC value ≥1 μg/ml) were mainly treated with TGC higher doses (P <0.01). No signifi cant diff erences were found in terms of ICU mortality (P = 0.8). The rate of abnormal laboratory measures during TGC treatment was similar between the two groups (P = NS). No patients required TGC discontinuation or dose reduction because of suspected adverse events. In the VAP subpopulation (63 patients: 30 received SD and 33 HD), the clinical cure rate and microbiological eradication percentage were higher when TGC was used at higher doses (57.6% vs. 33.3%; P = 0.08 and 57.1% vs. 30.4%; P = 0.1). Table 1 shows multivariate analysis of clinical cure predictors in the VAP subgroup. Conclusion In critically ill patients, HD TGC use seems to be safe and, combined with other active antibiotics, may increase the rate of MDR germ VAP clinical success. IIAT and the severity degree of patients' clinical condition still remain major determinants of VAP treatment failure. Reference Introduction Amikacin Inhale (NKTR-061, BAY41-6551) is a drugdevice combination in clinical development for adjunctive treatment of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with Gram-negative pneumonia. The product uses a proprietary vibrating mesh nebulizer system (PDDS Clinical) with amikacin sulfate formulated for inhalation (3.2 ml of 125 mg/ml amikacin solution) for a 10-day twice-daily course of therapy. It is designed for use with two delivery systems: one system for intubated patients (On-vent; Figure 1 ), and a second Handheld (HH) system for patients who are extubated before completing the course of therapy ( Figure 2 ). We investigated in vitro the amikacin lung dose delivered by PDDS Clinical. Methods An estimated lung dose (ELD) for On-vent setting was measured in vitro after collecting aerosolized amikacin from a fi lter at the end of an endotracheal tube during ventilation. The ELD for the HH device was calculated from the fi ne particle fraction (FPF <5 μm) postmouthpiece, multiplied by the in vitro delivered dose post-mouthpiece. FPF <5 μm refl ects lung deposition observed during phase 2 clinical trials [1] . Eighty-one nebulizers with volume median diameter (VMD) Introduction Recent studies demonstrate that a loading dose of 25 mg/kg (total body weight) of amikacin in septic patients is required to reach a suffi cient peak concentration. This study examines parameters infl uencing the relation between amikacin dose and peak concentration. Methods In this retrospective study we looked at 47 patients (128 peak levels) between 2003 and 2012. Multivariate linear regression analysis was done for several parameters: administered dose calculated with total body weight, ideal body weight, adjusted body weight, type of intensive care patient, BMI, daily fl uid balance, SOFA score and APACHE score, and patient characteristics were analyzed. Results A linear correlation between dose and amikacin peak level was confi rmed (Figure 1) . A total 54.69% of all amikacin administrations did not result in a therapeutic peak level. The multivariate linear regression analysis showed the best linear correlation with adjusted body weight and SOFA score. The comparison of variables between four patient groups, based on the deviation between measured peak level and predicted peak level (according the linear correlation), showed new variables that may infl uence peak level. Conclusion This confi rms that low doses (<18 mg/kg) of amikacin in intensive care patients seldom result in a therapeutic peak level. The proposed loading dose of 25 mg/kg is good for reaching a therapeutic level, although 29.6% remains subtherapeutic. Due to the linear correlation, more therapeutic levels may be reached with higher doses (25 to 30 mg/kg). New variables need further investigation to explain the high variability in achieved peak level. Introduction Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD) occurs in as many as 30% of patients receiving antibiotics, often leading to increased morbidity, prolonged in-hospital stay and additional healthcare resource utilisation. Age, antibiotics and prolonged postoperative ward and ICU stay have been suggested to be independent risk factors. In such patient populations, probiotics may be used to prevent antibioticassociated diarrhoea, yet they are not routinely recommended as a component of perioperative care. The aim of this study was to model the long-term costs associated with AAD and to assess the eff ectiveness of probiotics as a preventive strategy. Our results indicate an estimated incremental lifetime cost of £13,272.53 per ADD patient, largely driven by increased ICU length of stay and readmission rates. The addition of probiotics to the standard perioperative regime is associated with a small survival benefi t of 1.2 months, yet a cost reduction of £917.3/ADD patient. The main cost was increased duration of ICU stay and readmissions, which contribute to 85% of total expenses. Conclusion AAD is associated with a signifi cant increase in costs from a societal perspective. The provision of probiotics can achieve substantial cost savings and can be recommended as a cost-eff ective regime in the perioperative setting. Preventing ADD off ers a potentially signifi cant reduction of in-hospital costs and resource expenditures. Introduction Novel treatment strategies for invasive candidiasis (IC) are constantly emerging. Nevertheless, diffi culties in diagnosis pose a challenge on their reliability, effi cacy and safety. We have previously developed and approbated in our ICU an algorithm for empirical antimycotic therapy, combining the most signifi cant risk factors for IC with three major clinical criteria for persistent nonbacterial sepsis [1] . On the other hand, preemptive therapy, based on identifi cation of mycotic antigens and/or anti-mycotic antibodies in serum, is regarded as more reliable, even though it is known for its low sensitivity. The aim of the current study was to compare and evaluate the possible outcome benefi t of our protocol implementation versus detection of galactomanan in patient's serum as a trigger for antimycotic treatment initiation. Methods A randomized prospective controlled trial was carried out from September 2010 to September 2012. After the implication of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, patients were submitted to block randomization and stratifi ed on the basis of their initial SAPS II exp score. Antimycotic therapy was started on the day of inclusion in the control group and only with positive galactomanan serum test in the preemptive therapy group. Initial data were gathered on demographics, proven risk factors for IC-related mortality, severity of infl ammatory response and organ dysfunction. Dynamics of SIRS and SOFA values, Candida colonization index, ventilator-free days, length of ICU stay and outcome were followed for each patient. Results A total of 106 patients were enrolled. No statistically signifi cant diff erences in their basal characteristics were found. The subsequent SIRS and SOFA scores showed fi rm dynamics in the control group, although the new organ dysfunction severity was insignifi cantly lower. The length of ICU stay and the number of ventilator-free days were comparable. The in-hospital mortality was 47.1% in the preemptive therapy group versus 31.3% in the control group (P = 0.94). A total of seven adverse reactions were observed among treated patients, yet not associated with higher mortality risk. Conclusion The choice of empirical versus preemptive therapy led to earlier and more stable reduction in the degree of organ dysfunction severity. It showed to be at least not inferior if not equal; in terms of survival benefi t and expediency of treatment. Moreover, galactomanan detection fails to guide the choice of the individual antimycotic, based on the expected Candida spp. Reference Introduction Invasive candidemia is a major cause of increased mortality among ICU patients. Antifungal agents like liposomale amphotericin B and azoles could not accomplish the claim to be fi rst choice in the treatment of invasive fungal infection (IFI) because of side eff ects and eff ectiveness. Especially, cardiothoracic surgery patients as a group of high-risk patients are in a focus for new strategies and agents. A new class of antimycotic agents, the echinocandins, with a low profi le of side eff ects, low interactive potential and high eff ectiveness in the treatment of candidemia, is a powerful option in the treatment of IFI. We report our single-center experience with a modifi ed clinical treatment approach based on clinical score of Leon and using echinocandins as fi rst-line therapy for proven and suspected fungal infection. Methods From May 2011 to October 2012, 2,844 patients were treated on our cardiothoracic ICU. We evaluated 37 cardiothoracic postoperative patients with proven or suspected IFI or prophylaxis ( Figure 1 ). The records were evaluated for cardiothoracic procedures, microbiological and yeast date, cardiothoracic surgery score (CASUS), ICU and clinical data. Mean age was 67.4 years with 64% male patients. Most patients had combined CABG and valve procedure (n = 20), other groups were HTX and LTX (n = 4), assist therapy (n = 4), TAVI (n = 3) and other procedures. Mean predicted mortality using the logarithmic CASUS score at the onset of IFI was 59%. C. albicans was isolated in 73%, C. glabrata in 21%. Length of antifungal treatment using micafungin in 30 cases was 14 ± 5 days. Eradication of yeast was successful in 79% but mortality of all patients remains high at 36.8% but was lower than predicted in the CASUS score. Mortality was not yeast related. Conclusion Our described treatment approach shows encouraging results for the treatment of IFI especially in high-risk cardiothoracic patients. with fungi [1] . The relationship between colonization and invasive fungal infection (IFI) in severely ill ICU patients with a VAD support is not described. This study analyzes the incidence and outcome of fungal infection and colonization in VAD patients in bridge to transplantation or in destination therapy. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of all VAD implantations in our surgical ICU between 2007 and 2012. The incidence of fungal colonization, antifungal prophylaxis, bacterial sepsis and the mortality of IFI versus no IFI patients were compared. Results In the study period, 34 patients with severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock were selected for a VAD implantation (nine in destination therapy). The overall mortality rate was 50% during mechanical assistance. Confi rmed (n = 8) and highly suspected (n = 2) IFI occurred during the ICU stay in 29% of patients who were treated with echinocandins, voriconazole and/or liposomal amphotericin B. The isolated fungi were: six Candida albicans, two parapsilosis, one glabrata and one invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Antifungal prophylaxis with fl uconazole was administered to 18% of patients at mean for 5 days mainly in the more recent implantations. In the no IFI population, 54% (n = 13) had a systemic or VAD bacterial sepsis with a mortality rate about 54%. The mortality without any sepsis was reduced to 18%. Fungal colonization was signifi cantly more present (90% vs. 50%) before IFI in VAD patients. The mortality rate was dramatically higher with IFI (80% vs. 38%) in accordance with the literature [1] . See Table 1 . Conclusion In our center, we observed a high incidence of IFI in ICU patients with VAD that was associated with a mortality rate of 80%. Screening of fungal colonization appears to be very important during the ICU stay for VAD patients. Trials are needed for investigating the use, the drug choice and the timing of antifungal prophylaxis for such high-risk patients. Reference Introduction Echinocandins are recommended fi rst-line treatment for candidaemia [1] . A cost-eff ectiveness model developed from a UK perspective examined costs and outcomes of antifungal treatment for candidaemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis based on European clinical guidelines [1] . Methods Costs and treatment outcomes with the echinocandin anidula fungin were compared with caspofungin, micafungin, fl uconazole, voriconazole and amphotericin B. The model included non-neutropenic patients aged ≥16 years with confi rmed candidaemia/ another form of invasive candidiasis receiving intravenous fi rst-line treatment [2] . Patients were categorised as a clinical success or failure (patients with persistent/breakthrough infection); frequency data for each outcome were taken from a mixed-treatment comparison [3] . Successfully treated patients switched to oral therapy. Clinical failures switched to a diff erent antifungal class. It was assumed that second-line treatment duration was equivalent to that of fi rst-line treatment and only two lines of therapy were required to treat infection. Other inputs were all-cause 6-week mortality, cost of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and other medical resource use costs. Life-years were calculated using a published model [4] . Antifungal agent-related AEs were taken from the product label/literature. Resource use was derived from the literature and discussion with clinical experts. Drug acquisition/ administration costs were taken from standard UK costing sources. Results First-line anidulafungin for treatment of candidaemia was cost-eff ective per life-year gained versus fl uconazole (incremental cost-eff ectiveness ratio £813). Anidulafungin was cost saving versus caspofungin and micafungin in terms of life-years gained due to lower ICU costs and a higher rate of survival combined with a higher probability of clinical success. Conclusion Anidulafungin was cost-eff ective compared with fl uconazole for treatment of candidaemia and was cost saving versus other echinocandins in the UK. European guidelines recommend echinocandins as fi rst-line treatments for candidaemia [1] ; this model indicates that anidulafungin marries clinical eff ectiveness and cost-eff ectiveness. The AGFR in the respiratory circuit was almost same in typeB, but there was obvious decrease in the AGFR in typeV (7.1 ± 1.0, 17.7 ± 0.8, 21.9 ± 0.9, 29.9 ± 3.6, 36.9 ± 2.7, 45.0 ± 5.5 l/minute at assumed fl ow, 10, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60 l/minute, respectively). HFNC signifi cantly increased maximal expiratory pressure in both groups, 1.5 ± 2.1, 2.0 ± 1.0, 3.0 ± 2.8, 4.5 ± 3.5 mmHg for typeV and 2.5 ± 0.7, 5.8 ± 2.4, 6.0 ± 2.8, 8.0 ± 2.8 mmHg (maximum 10 mmHg) for typeB, when AGFR was set at 30, 40, 50, 60 l/minute. Higher AGFRs were found to result in larger increase in maximum expiratory pressure. The data indicate that HFNC are associated with an increase in intratracheal expiratory pressure. Because it was diffi cult to determine end-expiratory pressure, we chose maximal expiratory pressure for a substitute. The reason why AGFR in typeV was lower than assumed fl ow may be the resistance generated by NC. The larger increase in expiratory pressure in our study than previously reported may be due to the eff ect of high respiratory resistance of Japanese who have relatively small airway structure compared with western people. Conclusion HFNC are eff ective in providing higher expiratory pressure. It is important to know the fl ow rate is lower than expected when the Venturi type is used. Results A weaning-induced pulmonary edema was diagnosed in 12 instances (PAOP signifi cantly increased from 15.6 ± 0.6 to 25.8 ± 0.9 in these cases). EVLWI, BNP, plasma protein and hemoglobin concentrations signifi cantly increased in these instances (28.3 ± 5.7%, 20.2 ± 7.8%, 9.6 ± 0.8% and 9.3 ± 1.3%, respectively) while they did not signifi cantly changed in cases without weaning-induced pulmonary edema. The increase of EVLWI ≥8.5% (+1.5 ml/kg), an increase in BNP ≥6.7% (+23 pg/ml), an increase in plasma protein concentration ≥5% and in hemoglobin concentration ≥5% exhibited good areas under the ROC curves to predict weaning-induced pulmonary edema (0.97 ± 0.03, 0.80 ± 0.11, 1.0 ± 0.00 and 0.92 ± 0.05, respectively). These areas under the ROC curves were not statistically diff erent. The baseline values of EVLWI, BNP, plasma protein and hemoglobin concentrations did not predict weaning-induced pulmonary edema. Conclusion The increases in EVLWI, in plasma protein and hemoglobin concentration and in BNP are valuable alternatives to the pulmonary artery catheter for diagnosing weaning-induced pulmonary edema. The extent of stress raisers increased with the severity of ARDS (14 ± 5, 18 ± 8, 23 ± 1% of lung parenchyma in mild, moderate and severe ARDS, P <0.0001). The extent of stress raisers correlated with the dead space fraction (r 2 = 0.34, P <0.001), with the fraction of poorly aerated tissue (r 2 = 0.36, P <0.0001) and also has a negative correlation with the fraction of well infl ated tissue (r 2 = 0.47, P <0.0001). The response to PEEP, passing from 5 to 45 cmH 2 O is minimal (average decrease of stress raiser extent 6 ± 5%) and inter-individual variability is great (in 11 patients, stress raisers increased passing from PEEP 5 to PEEP 45). Stress raisers turn out to be greater in nonsurvivor patients than in survivor patients (17 ± 7 vs. 20 ± 9% of lung volume, P = 0.03). The ART strategy did not increase the risk of barotrauma (relative risk (RR) = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.19 to 3.30) in the fi rst 7 days after randomization or the need to initiate or increase vasopressors or mean arterial pressure <65 mmHg (RR = 1.14, 95% CI = 0.65 to 2.02, P = 0.67) 1 hour after randomization. However, the ART strategy increased the risk for severe acidosis (pH <7.10) 1 hour after randomization (RR = 3.20, 95% CI = 1.12 to 9.20, P = 0.03). Conclusion ART is feasible. The incidence of adverse events was similar between groups except for severe acidosis 1 hour after randomization. Hence we adjusted the study protocol, increasing the respiratory rate (from 10 to 15/minute) during MSARM. Introduction Cardiac surgical procedures are associated with a high incidence of postoperative complications, increasing costs and mortality. The purpose of this study is to evaluate prospectively the impact of two protective mechanical ventilation strategies, both using low-tidal volume ventilation (6 ml/kg/ibw) after cardiac surgery. Conclusion The reliability of pressure measurements and also of compliance estimation via the tested catheters is high. Only in two catheters was the fi lling volume a critical point for a precise measurement of pressure or for estimation of compliance. Immediately after unpacking, adhesion of the balloon material might prevent reliable pressure measurement, therefore before the fi rst measurement overfi lling of the balloon and retention of the excess gas seems strongly recommended. In all patients RR decreased with the increase of extracorporeal CO 2 removal and a negative correlation was found between RR and ECCO 2 Cl/total VCO 2 (r 2 = 0.42, P <0.01). In all patients we were able to obtain a reduction of RR below 15 (28 ± 4 vs. 8 ± 4, RR at low gas fl ow vs. RR at maximal gas fl ow, P <0.001). The selected maximal gas fl ow was variable between diff erent patients (6.7 ± 2 l/minute), corresponding to diff erent levels of ECCO 2 Cl/total VCO 2 (83 ± 17%, range 53 to 100%) and RR response (8 ± 4, range 5 to 14). Conclusion In patients with COPD exacerbation, who failed noninvasive ventilation, VV-ECMO allows one to maintain spontaneous breathing. Titration of extracorporeal CO 2 removal leads to control RR. This approach could interrupt the vicious circle of dynamic hyperinfl ation and allow the defl ation of lung parenchyma. Table 1 presents the main results. The CO 2 removal by membrane oxygenator ranged from 56 to 37 ml/minute. All patients survived to the treatment and 7/10 were weaned from the ventilator at the end of ECCO 2 removal. Only one oxygenator was used for every patient without clotting of the circuit or any major bleeding problem.  No animal-ventilator dyssynchrony during stimulation (MV+STIM) was noted while peak airway pressures were reduced. During STIM there was no discernible paradoxical movement of the diaphragm. In addition, PCO 2 and PO 2 confi rmed that adequate ventilation and oxygenation can be provided by the system, while PAWP could be reduced (Table 1) . Introduction Retrospective studies suggest that cardiac troponin levels are often elevated in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) indicating a poor survival. Novel high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTnT) assays have better analytical precision than standard troponin (cTnT) assays. We elaborated a prospective cohort study to investigate the prognostic value of this novel biomarker in patients with AECOPD. Methods Fifty-six patients (mean age 64 years, 68% male) with the fi nal diagnosis of AECOPD were enrolled. Those who were diagnosed with acute coronary syndromes were excluded. We measured cardiac troponin T with a standard fourth-generation assay and a highsensitivity assay. Clinical, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data were collected at admission and the primary prognostic endpoint was death during 30 days of follow-up. Introduction British Thoracic Society guidelines on communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) advocate ICU referral for patients with CURB65 score of 4 and 5. A recently developed scoring system, SMART-COP, designed to identify patients at need of intensive respiratory or vasopressor support (IRVS), has been validated in a variety of settings. It predicts the need for ICU admission (defi ned as need for IRVS) with greater accuracy than CURB65, but is not used routinely in our UK institution. Methods We retrospectively analysed critical care admissions of patients with a diagnosis of CAP in a UK district general hospital -ICNARC-coded diagnoses of pneumonia (bacterial, viral, no organisms isolated) over a 7-month period (August 2011 to January 2012). We ascertained the CURB65 and SMART-COP scores on referral to the ICU and matched them in relation to the need for IRVS, length of inotropic and ventilatory support and ICU length of stay. Results Our search revealed 28 potential matches. Five patients were excluded (not CAP) and the notes for seven patients were not available for analysis. We analysed the notes of 16 patients matching our criteria. In this small sample, there was a strong association between increasing SMART-COP score and the need for IRVS (correlation coeffi cient r = 0.96). There was also a strong correlation with longer inotropic support (r = 0.85) and longer ventilatory support (r = 0.96) with increasing SMART-COP scores but a weaker correlation with length of ICU stay (r = 0.49). Moreover, none of the patients admitted to the ICU had CURB65 score higher than 3 at the time of ICU referral. Conclusion In our small sample, higher SMART-COP score was associated with increased likelihood of IRVS. This suggests that a further study with a larger sample size should be performed to investigate whether SMART-COP is an improvement on CURB65 in predicting the need for IRVS in UK intensive care patients. Introduction Streptococcal pneumonia remains the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), bacterial meningitis and bacteremia. Severe pneumonia caused by streptococcal pneumonia frequently exists in the emergency room or ICU. We performed this study to evaluate the eff ect of steroid therapy for severe streptococcal pneumonia patients with mechanical ventilation retrospectively. Methods We enrolled 13 adults of streptococcal pneumonia patients who required mechanical ventilation. Seven of 13 patients (S group) were administered with steroid (hydrocortisone 200 to 300 mg/day), and the remaining six patients received no steroid therapy (NS group). As the conventional therapies, mechanical ventilation was commenced when a patient's PaO 2 /FiO 2 showed less than 200 or they clinically complained of being short of breath. All patients received appropriate fl uid therapies, vasoactive agents and blood transfusion according to the protocol of early goal-directed therapy in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines 2008, and also were treated with antibiotics, immunoglobulins (5 g/day for 3 days) and sivelestat sodium hydrate (4.8 mg/kg/day for 7 days). The APACHE scores in the S group and NS group were 27 ± 10 and 23 ± 4, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were 8 ± 4 and 7 ± 3, respectively. These scores showed no signifi cant diff erence between the groups. Procalcitonin (PCT) in the S and NS groups was 20.7 ± 21.7 and 45.0 ± 47.7 ng/ml, respectively, and there was no signifi cant diff erence between the groups. PCT declined signifi cantly in both groups. PaO 2 /FiO 2 of the NS group was signifi cantly higher than the S group on ICU admission and 4 days after admission, but no signifi cant diff erence on 7 days after ICU admission. IL-6 of the NS group declined signifi cantly after ICU admission, and the S group also tended to decline. Conclusion Steroid therapy for severe streptococcal pneumonia patients with mechanical ventilation may have a potential to maintain oxygenation of the lung, but no signifi cant eff ects on changes of infl ammatory markers (IL-6, CRP). Introduction Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive and nonradiating imaging technique, which can be used to visualize ventilation distribution of the lungs and could distinguish between the dependent (dorsal) and nondependent (ventral) parts. The ratio for dependent/nondependent distribution of ventilation is signifi cantly higher at lower support levels compared with higher support levels in both PS and NAVA. However, during NAVA there was signifi cantly less impedance loss between the diff erent levels of assist compared with PS. Tidal volumes decreased when decreasing assist levels during PS whereas not during NAVA ventilation. The electrical activity of the diaphragm decreased in both PS and NAVA with higher levels of assist. Three patients showed an increase in dependent tidal impedance variation (TIV) after lowering the assist level from 15 to 10 cmH 2 O. This increase in TIV did not occur during NAVA ventilation. Conclusion There is more ventilation in the dependent part of the lung, compared with the nondependent part, at lower levels of assist. This could indicate that at higher support levels the contribution of the diaphragm is reduced. During NAVA ventilation, there is an autoregulation in which the patient is adjusting his tidal ventilation to maintain homogeneous ventilation distribution. in status asthmaticus. Our purpose was to analyze BiPAP use and outcomes for children with status asthmaticus and obesity in our PED. Methods Patients placed on BiPAP in the PED for status asthmaticus from 1 January 2010 to 31 August 2012 were included in the analysis. Subjects were divided into moderate and severe exacerbations and then further subdivided into the following growth curve-based weight subgroups: <90 percentile, 90 to 97 percentile and >97 percentile. Subjects received standard asthma therapies in addition to BiPAP. Data were obtained at the bedside by the respiratory therapist or collected retrospectively by study investigators. Data were stored and analyzed using a RedCap database. Results Three hundred and fi fty-nine subjects were analyzed. Table 1 shows the time on BiPAP per visit. Children whose weight was >97 percentile revealed trends towards longer treatment times on BiPAP compared with the other two groups. We explored the feasibility, reliability and physiological signifi cance of diaphragm thickening on ultrasound. Methods Five healthy subjects participated. We monitored inspiratory fl ow, volume, esophageal and gastric pressures, and diaphragm electrical activity (by esophageal and surface electromyography) while subjects performed a series of inspiratory maneuvers: tidal breathing, threshold-loaded breathing, a Muller maneuver, and inspiration to various lung volumes above functional residual capacity. At the end of each inspiratory eff ort, subjects were instructed to close the glottis and relax the respiratory muscles (so as to maintain lung volume while eliminating diaphragm activation). Sonographic images of diaphragm thickening during these maneuvers were obtained using M-mode with a 13 MHz linear array probe placed in the right ninth, 10th, or 11th intercostal space between the middle and anterior axillary lines. Results Diaphragm thickening in the zone of apposition was readily visualized by ultrasound in all fi ve subjects. Mean end-expiratory diaphragm thickness was 2.1 mm (SD = 0.3 mm). During tidal breathing, the diaphragm thickened by a mean of 35% (SD = 31%). The Bland-Altman coeffi cient of reproducibility was 0.5 mm; approximately 50% of measurement variability arose from caliper positioning on the ultrasound machine; diaphragm thickness measurements changed as the probe was placed in diff erent intercostal interspaces. Diaphragm inspiratory thickening increased signifi cantly with increasing inspiratory eff ort but also varied with lung volume independent of eff ort. At inspiratory volumes below 40% of inspiratory capacity, lung volume change contributed minimally to diaphragm thickening. Conclusion Visualizing diaphragm thickening in the zone of apposition by ultrasound provides a feasible non-invasive technique for monitoring diaphragm activation in healthy subjects. Diaphragm thickening primarily refl ects muscular eff ort rather than altered muscle conformation induced by changes in lung volume, especially at lower inspiratory volumes. The studied ETTs remained in place for a median of 7 days (IQR range 4 to 15). The amount of secretions assessed by CT scan was 0.293 ± 0.290 ml (range 0.032 to 0.777 ml). Secretion volumes were not related to patient severity at admission (SAPS 2, P/F ratio) or days of intubation; an inverse correlation with patient's age was present (P = 0.032, R 2 = 0.46). Bacterial growth was present in 9/11 (82%) ETT fl uids cultures and Candida spp. showed an elevated prevalence (6/11, 55%). In the bench tests, the cleaning device reduced resistance to airfl ow (diff erence before and after cleaning 5.5 (95% CI = 8.9 to 1.6) cmH 2 O/l/second, P = 0.006). After cleaning, resistance resulted higher than intact ETTs, although with a clinically negligible diff erence (diff erence 0.3 (95% CI = 0.2 to 0.6 cmH 2 O/l/second), P = 0.032). Conclusion Micro-CT scan is a feasible and promising technique to assess secretions volume in ETTs after extubation. The use of an ETT cleaning device decreases resistance to airfl ow in bench tests; the eff ectiveness of such a device in the clinical setting could be properly assessed by post-extubation CT scan. [1, 2] . The objective was to develop and validate a simplifi ed score for identifying patients with DI in the ICU and to report related complications. Methods Data collected in a prospective multicenter-study from 1,000 consecutive intubations from 42 ICUs were used to develop a simplifi ed score of DI, which was then validated externally in 400 consecutive intubation procedures from 18 other ICUs and internally by bootstrap on 1,000 iterations. In multivariate analysis, the main predictors of DI (incidence = 11.3%) were related to the patient (Mallampati score III or IV, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, reduced mobility of cervical spine, limited mouth opening), to pathology (severe hypoxia, coma) and to the operator (non-anesthesiologist). From the β-parameter, a sevenitem simplifi ed score (MACOCHA score; Introduction In mechanically ventilated neonates the fl ow-dependent resistance of the endotracheal tube (ETT) causes a noticeable pressure diff erence between airway and tracheal pressure [1] . This may potentially lead to retardation of the passive driven expiration and dynamic lung infl ation consecutively but more importantly increases . The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between NT-proBNP and CCE and the potential usefulness of such variables during the weaning process from MV. Methods Twenty-two long-term (>48 hours) mechanically ventilated patients capable of performing a weaning trial of spontaneous breathing (SBT) were enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria were: age >18 years and equipment with a standard arterial catheter line. Exclusion criteria were: neuromuscular disease, tracheotomy, renal failure, and traumatic brain injury. During the weaning process, NT-proBNP plasma levels, CCE, and standard hemodynamic and ventilatory data were collected 30 minutes before extubation (T1), 2 hours (T2) and 12 hours later (T3). After removal of tracheal tube, patients with a history of heart failure received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP group). Patients with normal cardiac function were maintained with spontaneous breathing (SB group). Results Sixty-six paired NT-proBNP and CCE values were obtained. Patients in the SB group and in the CPAP group were 10 and 12, respectively. In both groups there was a trend towards an increase in NT-proBNP values after extubation, an opposite trend was observed regarding CCE values (P <0.05). NT-proBNP levels showed an increase after extubation (T2, T3) compared with T1; conversely, CCE showed an inverse trend. Overall, a negative correlation was found between NT-proBNP and CCE values (R = -0.81, P <0.001). Signifi cant inverse correlations were found between NT-proBNP and CCE at T1, T2, and T3 (R = -0.91, -0.75 and -0.73 respectively; P < 0.001). The overall correlation between NT-proBNP and CCE was -0.74 in the SB group and -0.86 in the CPAP group. Standard hemodynamic and ventilatory data did not show signifi cant changes during the study. Conclusion NT-proBNP correlated well with CCE. The latter seems to be an additional attractive index of cardiovascular state that, in association with NT-proBNP changes, may provide information about cardiac function on a beat-by-beat basis during weaning process from MV. The search results are summarised in Table 1 . A total of 80 guidelines were identifi ed. Five were found to satisfy the AGREE II criteria and only three related to the entire spectrum of tracheostomy management. The majority was informal and was not published or evidence based. Conclusion Five evidence-based guidelines on adult tracheostomy management were identifi ed. This may represent a paucity of evidence on the subject, suggesting that further clinical trials on the topic are needed to contribute to the evidence base. This also highlights the need for international consensus on the topic, to reduce duplication of eff orts, standardise practice, and improve outcomes. [1] concluded that the majority of airway-related signifi cant complications in ICUs resulted from displaced or blocked tracheostomies and recommended together with the Intensive Care Society and the National Tracheostomy Safety Project that each ICU in the UK should have an emergency airway management plan and guidelines [2] . The aim of this survey was to establish whether such guidelines exist and are familiar to those working within the ICUs of the East of England (EoE), their ease of availability in an emergency and the degree of emergency tracheostomy training within the region. Methods Data collection was via a telephone survey of 11 ICUs in the EoE training region during July 2012 with one senior ICU nurse and one ICU trainee questioned per hospital. Questions related to the existence and accessibility of guidelines for tracheostomy emergencies, and to the respondent's degree of emergency tracheostomy training and their perceived availability of formal training. Results All 11 ICUs questioned perform and manage tracheostomies. Of 22 respondents, 10 knew of guidelines covering all of the emergencies described above and their location. Four respondents thought that these guidelines were accessible in an emergency setting, one-half of which were on computer systems requiring a login and search function. With regards to emergency management, 19 respondents felt competent in a tracheostomy emergency; almost exclusively through experience and in-house teaching. No respondents were aware of any formal emergency tracheostomy management courses. Conclusion Despite national guidance within the UK this survey highlights that implementation and awareness of emergency tracheostomy guidelines in ICUs in the EoE region is poor, and when present they are not readily accessible in an emergency. Emergency training has largely been informal and the availability of formal training courses has not been recognised. In order to improve patient safety there is a need to ensure that emergency tracheostomy management including guidelines, equipment and formalised tracheostomy emergency training are adopted and embraced universally. References Introduction A fatal incident related to a blocked tracheostomy tube prompted a review in our Trust. To provide safe tracheostomy care, changes in staffi ng, education and operational policies were recommended. Training of potential fi rst responders to tracheostomy or laryngectomy emergencies remains outstanding. We aim to quantify the training defi cit. Tracheostomies are common in critical care but these patients require ongoing management of an artifi cial airway on discharge to the ward and even the community. In 2010 our critical care unit cared for 108 tracheostomy patients, of which 30 were transferred to the wards. The 4th National Audit Project highlighted complications including hypoxic brain injury and death [1] and the National Patient Safety Agency recognised a number of avoidable aspects [2] . Existing guidelines for management of these patients including emergencies are not widely known. Methods An anonymous online survey was sent to all trainees who may respond to a tracheostomy emergency in our organisation. Trainees in anaesthesia/critical care, general medicine, general surgery, ENT, thoracics and A&E were approached. All completed forms were included. We achieved a response rate of 39% (65/168). Respondents comprised: 33% anaesthesia/critical care, 47% medicine and 14% surgery. Over one-half (36/65) had managed tracheostomy/laryngectomy emergencies, with 42% (15/36) of these incidents occurring on the wards and one in an outpatient clinic. Only 20% (13/65) had received any formal training on management of a blocked/misplaced tracheostomy tube and only 18% (12/65) were aware of any guidelines. One-third of responders lacked confi dence in management of these emergencies and 88% felt they would benefi t from formal training including simulation. Conclusion The population of patients with exteriorised tracheas is increasing and represents a high-risk group. Management of airway emergencies in these patients is not part of standard life-support courses. According to our trainees, these scenarios are relatively common and a signifi cant proportion of fi rst responders are poorly equipped to deal with them. Our Trust will be including specifi c training on the emergency management of neck breathers as part of in-house resuscitation training. We would contend that national resuscitation courses should consider doing the same. Introduction Usually percutaneous tracheostomy is accomplished via the tracheal tube. Some severe complications during percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) may be related to poor visualization of tracheal structures. The alternative implies extubation and reinsertion of a laryngeal mask (LMA). An accidental extubation as well as an injuring of the vocal cords (because of the infl ated cuff during dislocation) appears impossible in this method. Subjectively, the bronchoscopic view obtained via a LMA seems to be better than that obtained with an endotracheal tube (ET) [1, 2] . Methods In this prospective observational study, the bedside PDT was performed using the Ciaglia Blue Dolphin method in 150 critically ill patients. The patient's tracheal tube was exchanged for a LMA Fastrach™ before undertaking PDT. The insertion of the LMA, the quality of ventilation, the blood gas values, the view of the tracheal puncture site, and the view of the balloon dilatation were rated as follows: very good (1), good (2), barely acceptable (3), poor (4), and very poor (5) . In the study period, ultrasound guidance was employed for a total of 291 central line insertions in 220 ICU patients. Coagulopathy was detected in 127 cases at the time of CVC placement (43.6%). On the day of CVC insertion, coagulation abnormalities were corrected in 20 cases (15.7%); 33 out of 50 patients with severe coagulopathy (66.0%) and 74 out of 77 patients with coagulopathy of moderate severity (96.1%) had no correction at all. Correction was started only after CVC insertion for reasons unrelated to CVC placement in a further eight and two patients with severe and less severe coagulopathy (16.0% and 2.6%), respectively. No bleeding complications were observed. Conclusion In patients undergoing CVC insertion in our ICU, coagulopathy is common. We observed uncomplicated CVC placement in all 41 patients with severe uncorrected coagulopathy and in a further 76 patients with coagulopathy of moderate severity. When combined with other studies, our data suggest that ultrasound-guided CVC placement without routine correction of coagulation abnormalities may be safe in the ICU. In 2002 the total number of X-rays performed in patients at our unit was 2,306, which corresponds to the approximate number of inserted CVCs at that time, since a confi rmatory X-ray was routine. X-rays were rarely performed on other indications in our unit. X-ray costs were at that time approximately €300,000 (~€130/each). The year after, 1,726 chest X-rays were performed, refl ecting both the use of intracardiac confi rmation of correct CVC position and also a reduced use of CVCs. This trend has continued over time. In 2011 approximately 600 CVCs were inserted at our unit. X-rays were performed in about 20% of these cases. The cost for a chest X-ray is today ~€200, meaning that X-ray costs were approximately €24,000. We have not experienced any medical problems when intracardiac ECG was used for positioning confi rmation. On the contrary, aspiration of venous blood without apparent p-waves in a patient with sinus rhythm may suggest improper placement of the CVC; for example, the right brachial vein. Conclusion If we had continued to use CVCs at the same frequency as we did 10 years ago, and used X-ray confi rmation in practically all cases, we would have paid approximately €460,000 annually. Reduced use of CVCs, in combination with intracardiac confi rmation of CVC positioning, has not only allowed us to reduce costs associated with CVC insertion by more than €400,000, corresponding to a reduction rate of more than 90%, but also decreased the patient's exposure to X-ray irradiation. Fifty-three patients (18.5%) had evidence of CO monitoring. LiDCO was the most popular method ( Figure 1 ). A total of 264 (94%) patients received treatment with vasopressors and/or inotropes. CO data were utilised in a variety of ways ( Figure 2 ). Conclusion The majority of potential donors require vasopressors and/or inotropes post BSD, but it seems only a minority currently have their CO monitored. There is variation in how CO data are utilised to direct haemodynamic management. We welcome the development of standardised bundle-driven donor management. Reference  In total, 940 CCI and 382 TDCI values were obtained: 940 paired PiCCI and PuCCI; 358 paired AutoCI-TDCI measurements. TDCI values ranged from 1.5 to 6.9 l/minute/m 2 (mean 3.6 ± 1.1), AutoCI from 1.8 to 7.2 (3.6 ± 0.9), PiCCI from 1.0 to 7.1 (3.5 ± 1.1) and PuCCI from 1.3 to 7.6 (3.6 ± 1). Pearson's correlation coeffi cient comparing mean PuCCI and PiCCI values per patient had an R 2 of 0.79. Comparison between AutoCI and TDCI had an R 2 of 0.51. Changes in AutoCI correlated well with changes in TDCI (R 2 = 0.44, concordance coeffi cient = 95.7), as did changes in PuCCI versus changes in PiCCI (R 2 = 0.99, CC = 93.4%). Changes in PiCCI and PuCCI induced by an intervention correlated well with each other (R 2 = 0.86, CC = 100%). The percentage error (PE) obtained by Bland and Altman analysis and R 2 for the diff erent comparisons are presented in Table 1 . In the group treated with a restrictive volume approach, patients received fl uids at the rate of 7.0 ± 1.0 ml/kg/hour. PaO 2 /FiO 2 was 288 ± 14 after intubation and 270 ± 22 before extubation. In the group treated with a liberal volume approach, fl uids were replaced at 11.0 ± 2.0 ml/kg/hour. PaO 2 /FiO 2 was 259 ± 24 after intubation and 223 ± 43 before extubation. Surgery combined with OLV was found to signifi cantly aff ect the PaO 2 /FiO 2 value (ANOVA, F 1,14 = 15.85a, P = 0.001, partial η 2 = 0.531). The average PaO 2 /FiO 2 level was signifi cantly higher in the restrictive-replacement group than in the liberal-replacement group (ANOVA, F 1,14 = 9.66, P = 0.008, partial η 2 = 0.408). There was no interaction between the groups (ANOVA, F 1,14 = 1.7a, P = 0.215, partial η 2 =0.108). Mean length of stay in the ICU was similar between the restrictive-replacement group (5.2 ± 2.3 days) and the liberalreplacement group (6.3 ± 1.6 days) (ANOVA, F 1,14 = 0.814a, P = 0.382, partial η 2 = 0.055). Conclusion Results from this small sample indicate that esophageal carcinoma surgery by itself had a detrimental eff ect on the PaO 2 /FiO 2 value, which restriction of perioperative volume did not signifi cantly aff ect. Volume restriction also did not aff ect length of stay in the ICU.  Results Twenty patients were enrolled in the study. Values of r 2 , bias and limit of agreement at T1 and T2 are summarized in Table 1 . CO values ranged from 3.9 and 8.6 l/minute (echo), from 3.4 to 9.9 (Vigileo) and from 4 to 8.3 (MostCare); the Pearson's and Bland-Altman methods showed poor agreement between COECHO and COVIG, demonstrating a tendency to overestimation (see Figure 1 ). The percentage of error (PE) was 51.7% at T1 and 49.3% at T2. On the contrary, MostCare measures showed good agreement with echocardiography (see Table 1 ) with a PE of 22.4% at T1 and of 17% at T2. Conclusion Vigileo did not prove to be a substitute to the reference system; pre-loaded data, necessary for vascular impedance estimation, may be one of the main limitations that made Vigileo measurements less accurate than the MostCare ones. On the contrary, MostCare, an uncalibrated totally independent system, was shown to properly estimate the vascular impedance in these hemodynamically stable patients. Further comparisons in unstable conditions are needed to confi rm our observations. References Previous studies have found an association between severity of acute infl ammatory states and increased arterial stiff ness but it is not known whether non-invasive pulse waveform analysis could predict development of multiple organ failure in septic patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the photoplethysmographic brachial artery pulse wave transit time and augmentation index and their changes in response to induced forearm ischemia in septic ICU patients and correlate these indices to the development of subsequent end organ damage. Methods A prospective observational study in patients with sepsis within 24 hours of admission. Severity of sepsis was assessed with APACHE II score (median 18.5) and SOFA score (median 7.5). Threeminute signal recording was done concurrently from the brachial artery at the elbow and the radial artery at the wrist with an originally designed photoplethysmograph at rest and after 5 minutes of induced forearm ischemia. Recordings were analyzed to obtain the pulse wave transit time and augmentation index at rest and 60 seconds after induced ischemia. The SOFA score was recalculated at 48 hours post recording. Results We studied 14 consecutive general ICU patients. There was a negative linear relationship between the pulse wave transit time (median 22.6 ms) at rest and increase in SOFA score in 48 hours (P = 0.02, r = 0.96). The postischemic pulse wave transit time increased in all patients (median 25.7 ms) but no association was found between the proportion of increase and subsequent change in SOFA. Correlation between rest (median 7.6) and postischemic (median 7.2) augmentation index and 48-hour SOFA scores was not statistically signifi cant (r = 0.57, P = 0.46). Conclusion This study indicates that in early sepsis pulse waveform characteristics could predict the risk of developing end organ failure. The pulse wave transit time is more robust than the augmentation index and could be easier to use in patients with poor perfusion. Vascular reactivity indices do not seem to have predictive value in this context. Reference  We performed 168 paired measurements (pre-fl uid and postfl uid challenge), with a SV response rate of 45%. Overall predictive values were poor, but slightly better for static versus dynamic variables (Table 1) . When SV response was analysed as a continuous variable, the two predictive multivariable variables were change in TEDVI and baseline dp/dt (r 2 = 0.30, both P <0.001). Conclusion The predictive ability for typical static and dynamic haemodynamic variables, when taken in isolation, is poor. However, improved prediction is seen when baseline contractility is taken into account. pressure (MAP)-guided fl uid therapy on microcirculatory perfusion in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Methods Patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery were randomized into a PPV/CI-guided group (n = 11) or a MAP-guided (n = 12) group. PPV, CI and MAP were measured using the non-invasive fi nger arterial blood pressure measurement device ccNexfi n (Edwards Lifesciences BMEYE, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Tidal volumes were ≥8 ml/kg with PEEP ≥8 mmHg. In both groups, MAP of 70 mmHg was maintained. In the PPV/CI group, an intraoperative algorithm was used keeping the PPV under 12% and CI above 2.5 l/minute/ m 2 using fl uid therapy and dobutamine and noradrenaline infusion, respectively. Sublingual microvascular perfusion was measured after anesthesia induction, and every subsequent hour using sidestream dark-fi eld imaging (Microscan; Microvision Medical, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). The perfused small vessel density (PVD) values were offl ine quantifi ed. The fi rst hour during surgery, the PPV/CI-guided group tended to receive more fl uids than the MAP-guided group (1,014 ± 501ml vs. 629 ± 463 ml; P = 0.07). At this time point, the PVD was slightly lower in the PPV/CI-guided group (16.7 ± 3.1 mm/mm 2 ) when compared with the MAP-guided group (17.9 ± 3.9 mm/mm 2 ; P = 0.41). In both groups the PVD remained stable during the fi rst 2 hours of surgery. However, 2 hours after the start of surgery, the PVD in the PPV/CI group restored and tended to be higher than in the MAP-guided group (21.1 ± 1.9 vs. 18.1 ± 3.4 mm/mm 2 ; P = 0.09). After 1 hour of surgery, the administered fl uid volume correlated inversely with PVD (r = -0.59, P = 0.011). Conclusion Goal-directed fl uid management resulted in a higher administered fl uid volume in the beginning of surgery, and this was associated with a slightly reduced microcirculatory perfusion when compared with MAP-guided fl uid management. Microcirculatory perfusion tended to improve as surgery progressed in the goal-directed fl uid therapy group. Our fi ndings suggest that goal-directed and MAPguided fl uid management are associated with distinct patterns in fl uid resuscitation, which may be of consequence for microvascular perfusion. Introduction Previous studies demonstrate that loss of glycocalyx integrity is associated with impaired microvascular function. We investigated whether glycocalyx dimensions are reduced in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with or without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and are paralleled by loss of microcirculatory perfusion using in vivo microcirculation measurements. Methods Patients undergoing on-pump surgery with nonpulsatile (n = 11) or pulsatile (n = 13) CPB or off -pump surgery (n = 13) underwent sublingual sidestream dark-fi eld imaging at baseline, during coronary grafting and upon ICU admission to assess perfused microvascular vessel density. Glycocalyx integrity was evaluated using the GlycoCheck Measurement Software, and expressed as the perfused boundary region (PBR). An increase in PBR represents deeper penetration of erythrocytes into the glycocalyx, and is indicative for compromised glycocalyx thickness. Introduction Cold exposure can be adapted for exercise or therapeutic purposes, but its impact on microcirculation in healthy humans has not been well defi ned. We hypothesize that whole body cold stress may impair microcirculation. Methods Seven volunteers were recruited for the water immersion procedure. During the cooling protocol the volunteers every 20 minutes of immersion were asked to step out from the bath and rest for 10 minutes in a room environment and then return to the water bath for the next 20 minutes of immersion. This head-out immersion procedure in bath water at 14°C continued until the rectal temperature was dropped to 35.5°C or the time of 180 minutes was terminated. Maximum cold water immersion time was 120 minutes. Before, at the end of whole body cooling and 1 hour after cooling was ended, systemic hemodynamics and direct in vivo observation of the sublingual microcirculation were obtained with sidestream dark-fi eld imaging. Assessment of microcirculatory parameters of convective oxygen transport (microvascular fl ow index (MFI), proportion of perfused vessels (PPV)), and diff usion distance (perfused vessel density (PVD) and total vessel density (TVD)) was done using a semiquantitative method. Results During cooling and 1 hour after cooling was ended, a signifi cant increase in cardiac output (P = 0.028 and P = 0.043) was observed, but there were no changes in heart rate or mean arterial pressure in comparison with baseline variables. There were no signifi cant changes in PPV, MFI, PVD and TVD of small vessels in comparison with baseline variables during all observational time. Conclusion Defined cold exposure had no effect on the microcirculation. Introduction Vasodilation and increased skin blood fl ow (also sweating) are infl uential in heat dissipation during heat exposure and exercise. It is unclear how heat stress infl uences microcirculation. Side dark-fi eld imaging visualizes the blood fl ow at the capillary level and helps to assess perfusion heterogeneity. Clinical and experimental data show that the sublingual region is clinically relevant for detecting microcirculatory alterations and more represents central microcirculation than cutaneous perfusion. We hypothesize that whole body heat stress may increase capillary density. Methods Eight healthy men with no history of cold and/or heat injury were recruited to this study. Passive body heating was performed by continuous immersion up to the waist in the water bath at 44°C and continued until rectal temperature reached 39.5°C. Before, at the end of whole body heating and 1 hour after heating was ended, systemic hemodynamics and direct in vivo observation of the sublingual microcirculation were obtained with sidestream dark-fi eld imaging. Assessment of microcirculatory parameters of convective oxygen transport (microvascular fl ow index (MFI), proportion of perfused vessels (PPV)), and diff usion distance (perfused vessel density (PVD) and total vessel density (TVD)) was done using a semiquantitative method. Vessels were separated into large (mostly venules) and small (mostly capillaries) using a diameter cutoff value of 20 μm. Results Whole body heating resulted in signifi cantly increased heart rate (P = 0.012) and cardiac output (P = 0.046) in comparison with baseline variables. One hour after heating was ended, the heart rate Introduction Serial measurements of lactate over time may be a better prognosticator than a single lactate concentration [1] . Early lactateguided therapy also reduces ICU length of stay and ICU and hospital mortality [2] . This study aims to assess the prognostic value of the lactate clearance (LC) in the fi rst 24 hours in surgical patients. Methods In a prospective cohort during 1 year, we followed consecutively enrolled patients admitted immediately postoperative to the surgical ICU of Hospital Santa Luzia, Brasília, Brazil. Patients were assigned to two groups: LC >10% and LC ≤10%. The primary outcome measure was mortality at 7 and 28 days. The secondary outcome included hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS). Results A total of 417 patients were followed. In total, 50.4% were male and 83% underwent elective surgery. The mean age was 59 ± 16, APACHE II score 8 ± 5, SAPS 2 26 ± 11. The mortality at 7 days was 0.95% (n = 4) and the mortality at 28 days was 2.15% (n = 9), respectively. Hospital mortality was 4.79% (n = 20). Sixty-one percent (n = 255) of the patients had LC >10% versus 39% (n = 162) with LC ≤10%. Those who had LC ≤10% were older (62 ± 16 vs. 57 ± 17, P = 0.00) and had greater APACHE II score (9 ± 6 vs. 7 ± 4, P = 0.00) and SAPS 2 (28 ± 12 vs. 25 ± 10, P = 0.02). There was no diff erence in ICU LOS (5 ± 12 vs. 4 ± 9 days, P = 0.54) and hospital LOS (10 ± 15 vs. 9 ± 11 days, P = 0.48). Initial lactate levels were lower in the group with LC ≤10% (1.1 ± 0.9 vs. 1.9 ± 1.6, P = 0.00); however, mean lactate was higher in 24 hours (2.0 ± 1.8 vs. 1.0 ± 0.7, P = 0.00). All of the patients who died in the fi rst 7 days had LC ≤10% (2.46%, n = 4, P = 0.02); this group also had a higher mortality at 28 days (4.32%, n = 7 vs. 0.78%, n = 2; P = 0.03). The relative risk for mortality LC ≤10% in 7 and 28 days was 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.05) and 5.07 (95% CI: 1.17 to 27.09), respectively. Signifi cant diff erence was observed in the Kaplan-Meier survival curves for 7 and 28 days (P = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). The sensibility of LC ≤10% was 100% (95% CI: 51 to 100%) for 7-day mortality and 78% (95% CI: 45 to 94%) for 28-day mortality. The specifi city was 62% (95% CI: 57 to 66%) for 7-day mortality and 62% (95% CI: 57 to 66%) for 28-day mortality. Conclusion Despite initial lactate levels, lactate clearance ≤10% proved to be a good predictor of mortality in 7 and 28 days in surgical patients admitted in the postoperative period to the ICU. References Introduction The use of peripheral perfusion objective parameters to anticipate successful resuscitation in septic shock has been recently investigated [1] . The mottling score, a perfusion parameter used for decades, has been proposed to correlate with septic shock survival [2] , and was tested in this study as a clinical tool in predicting mortality. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted, with patients consecutively admitted to a tertiary hospital ICU in Brasília, Brazil. From July 2011 to May 2012, all patients diagnosed with septic shock were enrolled. Demographic data, diagnoses, shock origin and severity scores were recorded. After initial resuscitation, the score was registered in the fi rst 3 days by the same observer, considering the score on the lower limb without an arterial catheter, or the worst between the lower limbs, and the worst in the 3 days. Exclusion criteria were terminal illness with no intervention decision and incomplete Methods Pigs (20 to 30 kg) were randomized into one of the groups: Sham (n = 2), HS (n = 9), LR (3× volume bled; n = 9) or TERLI (2 mg bolus; n = 9). HS induced to target MAP of 40 mmHg was maintained for 30 minutes. Brain tissue oxygen pressure (PbtO 2 ), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), haemodynamics and blood gas analyses were assessed prior to HS (baseline) up to 120 minutes after treatment. Tissue markers of brain oedema (aquaporin-4 (AQP4) and Na-K-Cl cotransporter-1 (NKCC1)), apoptosis (pre-apoptotic protein (Bax)) and oxidative stress (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)) were also measured. Results Sham animals had no signifi cant changes in the variables assessed. HS resulted in a signifi cant decrease in CPP (mean varied from 36 to 39 mmHg), PbtO 2 (from 23.6 to 26.6 mmHg), ICP (from 1 to 2 mmHg) and haemodynamics (MAP from 38 to 40 mmHg; CI from 1.8 to 2.1 l/minute/m 2 ), and a signifi cant increase in blood lactate (from 6.7 to 8.9 mmol/l) and cerebral AQP4 (mean ± SE; 167 ± 54% of sham), NKCC1 (237 ± 47% of sham), Bax (167 ± 44% of sham) and TBARS. Fluid resuscitation was followed by an increase in ICP (from 7 to 9 mmHg) and a decrease in CPP (from 41 to 52 mmHg), with an increased expression of cerebral AQP4 (210 ± 56% of sham), NKCC1 (163 ± 32% of sham) and Bax (137 ± 24% of sham Introduction Shock induces mitochondrial damage, which can lead to tissue injury and infl ammation. Resuscitative adjuncts to limit mitochondrial injury may be eff ective to reduce tissue injury and protect against the sequelae of hemorrhagic shock (HS). Others and we have demonstrated the protective eff ects of inhaled carbon monoxide (CO) or nebulized sodium nitrite (NaNO 2 ) in models of HS. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that CO and NaNO 2 protect against hemorrhagic shock-induced tissue injury/infl ammation by limiting mitochondrial damage and preventing bioenergetic failure. Methods Twenty anesthetized female Yorkshire pigs were subjected to severe hemorrhage until unable to compensate or 90 minutes, and were then resuscitated with volume/pressors. Muscle and platelet samples were obtained at baseline (BL) and 2 hours after resuscitation (EndObs). Animals were randomized to: standard of care (HSR, n = 5); HSR+CO (CO; 250 ppm×30 minutes, n = 6); or HSR+NaNO 2 (NaNO 2 ; 11 mg in PBS×30 minutes, n = 6), and sham (n = 3). CO or NaNO 2 were initiated ~30 minutes before resuscitation. Primary endpoints were changes in muscle and platelet mitochondrial respiration between BL and EndObs, quantifi ed by muscle respiratory control ratio (RCR, traditional respirometry), and by the change in proton-leak respiration (PLR) and mitochondrial reserve capacity in platelets. Secondary endpoint was mortality at EndObs. Results Skeletal muscle RCR decreased in the HSR group (P = 0.04) but not in sham. Decrease in RCR was primarily due to decreased ADPdependent respiration, without change in state 4 respiration. HSR also resulted in platelet mitochondrial dysfunction as demonstrated by increased PLR and decreased reserve capacity. This correlated with increased platelet activation (%CD62P+ by fl ow cytometry) in HSR. CO or NaNO 2 treatment prevented these deleterious changes in both muscle and platelet mitochondrial respiration, as well as limited HSR-induced platelet activation. CO treatment also improved reserve capacity compared with baseline. Mortality was higher in HSR than in CO or NaNO 2 (80 vs. 33 and 33%, respectively). Conclusion In severe HS, mitochondrial injury in platelets and muscle was limited by CO or NaNO 2 . Although not powered for a secondary endpoint, mortality was double in HSR versus adjunctive therapies. This suggests that CO and NaNO 2 may protect mitochondrial function by maintaining ATP-coupled respiration and reserve capacity, and that this may confer a survival advantage. However, further investigations are required. Introduction Norepinephrine has been widely used in septic shock. However, its eff ect remains controversial. We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the eff ect between norepinephrine and other vasopressors. Methods The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases from database inception until October 2012 were searched. We selected randomized controlled trials in adults with septic shock and compared norepinephrine with other vasopressors. The quality of each study included was assessed with Jadad score. After assessing for heterogeneity of treatment eff ect across trials using the I 2 statistic, we used a fi xed eff ect model (P ≥0.1) or random-eff ects model (P <0.1) and expressed results as the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or the standardized mean diff erence (SMD) for continuous data with 95% CI. Results Eighteen trials (n = 2,715) met inclusion criteria, which compared norepinephrine with fi ve diff erent vasopressors (dopamine, vasopressin, epinephrine, terlipressin and phenylephrine). The mean Jadad score was 3.11. Overall, there was no diff erence in mortality in the comparisons between norepinephrine and vasopressin, epinephrine, terlipressin and phenylephrine (P >0.05, respectively). However, norepinephrine had a trend in decreasing mortality compared with dopamine (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.02; P = 0.08). There were a decreased heart rate (HR) (SMD, -2.10; 95% CI, -3.95 to -0.25; P = 0.03), cardiac index (SMD, -0.73; 95% CI, -1.14 to -0.03; P = 0.004) and an increased systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) (SMD, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.45; P <0.0001) with the treatment of norepinephrine compared with dopamine. Conclusion There is not suffi cient evidence to prove that norepinephrine is superior to vasopressin, epinephrine, terlipressin and phenylephrine in terms of mortality. However, norepinephrine is associated with a decreased HR, cardiac index and an increased SVRI, and appears to have a greater eff ect on decreasing mortality compared with dopamine. The patients received 0.5 ± 0.1 and 1.1 ± 0.2 g amino acids/ kg/day (P <0.001) on the days with 50 and 100% of measured energy expenditure respectively. Energy expenditures were 23.4 ± 2.7 and 24.5 ± 2.3 kcal/kg/day (P = 0.05) on the 50 and 100% days respectively. Plasma amino acids concentrations were 2.8 ± 0.5 and 2.9 ± 0.4 mM (P = 0.085) on the 2 days respectively. Whole body protein synthesis was 12% lower when 50% of energy expenditure was given, 11.7 ± 3.0 versus 13.3 ± 2.2 mg/kg/hour (P = 0.025), whilst protein degradation was unaltered 13.6 ± 3.5 versus 14.0 ± 2.6 mg/kg/hour (P = 0.56). Also protein oxidation was unaltered 3.0 ± 2.1 versus 2.9 ± 1.4 mg/kg/hour (P = 0.85). This resulted in a 60% higher whole body protein balance with the normocaloric nutrition, -1.9 ± 2.1 versus -0.7 ± 1.3 mg/kg/ hour (P = 0.014). Conclusion The protein kinetics measurements and the protocol used were useful to assess the effi cacy of nutritional support in critically ill patients. In the critically ill neurosurgical patients treated in the ICU, hypocaloric feeding was associated with a more negative protein balance, while the amino acid oxidation was not diff erent. controlled trial (EPaNIC: clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00512122) [2] showed that withholding parenteral nutrition during the fi rst week of ICU stay whereby tolerating substantial caloric defi cit (late PN) accelerated recovery and shortened weaning time as compared with early parenteral substitution for defi cient enteral feeding (early PN). We examined the impact of late PN, as compared with early PN, on incidence and recovery of ICUAW. Methods A preplanned subanalysis of adult patients included in the EPaNIC trial. The study was performed between October 2008 and November 2010 and included those patients who required intensive care for ≥8 days as well as a computer-generated, admission categorymatched, random sample of short-stay ICU patients, the latter to correct for possible bias evoked by earlier ICU discharge in one of the two study groups. Assessors blinded for treatment allocation evaluated muscle strength clinically three times weekly from awakening onward and performed nerve conduction studies and electromyography (NCS and EMG) weekly. The primary outcome was the incidence of ICUAW, diagnosed clinically by the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score (<48/60) [3] at fi rst evaluation. Secondary outcomes included ICUAW at worst and last MRC evaluation, recovery from ICUAW and incidence of abnormal fi ndings on NCS and EMG. All analyses were performed on the total dataset and on a for-baseline characteristics propensity score-matched sample to correct for possible imbalances between the groups. [1] . Plasma total bilirubin was quantifi ed in all patients daily while in the ICU. Liver enzymes ALT, AST, GGT and ALP were quantifi ed twice weekly in all patients while in the ICU. In a random predefi ned subset of patients, circulating bile salts were also quantifi ed with MS-HPLC at baseline and on day 3, day 5 and the last day in the ICU (n = 280). Gallbladder sludge was evaluated by ultrasound on ICU day 5 by blinded assessors (n = 776). Results From day 1 after randomization until the end of the 7-day intervention window, plasma bilirubin was higher in the late PN than in the early PN group (all P <0.001). In the late PN group, as soon as PN was started on day 8, plasma bilirubin also fell and the two groups became comparable. Maximum levels of GGT, ALP and ALT during the ICU stay were higher in the early PN group (all P <0.01). Compared with baseline, the circulating glycine and taurine conjugated primary bile salts were elevated on day 3, day 5 and last day of the ICU stay (P <0.01 for all). However, there was no diff erence between the two groups. More patients in the early PN than in the late PN group had gallbladder sludge on day 5 (45% vs. 37%; P = 0.04). Conclusion Tolerating substantial caloric defi cit by withholding PN until day 8 of critical illness increased circulating levels of bilirubin but reduced the occurrence of gallbladder sludge and lowered GGT, ALP and ALT levels. These results suggest that hyperbilirubinemia during critical illness dies not necessarily refl ect cholestasis and instead may be an adaptive response. Additional analyses on a propensity scorematched patient population are ongoing. Reference the duration of renal replacement therapy (RRT) [1] . The impact of the intervention on early markers of catabolism has not been investigated. Methods We studied the impact of early versus late PN on daily markers of catabolism in the ICU in the total study population and in propensity score-matched subgroups of long-stay patients. In addition, we calculated the net incorporation rate of the extra amino acids supplied by early PN. Results Plasma urea, the urea/creatinine ratio and nitrogen excretion increased over time in the ICU. Early PN further increased these markers of catabolism, from the fi rst day of amino acid infusion onward, and only marginally improved the nitrogen balance. Also in the group that received PN only after the fi rst week in the ICU, ureagenesis was increased by infusing amino acids. Over the fi rst 2 weeks, approximately two-thirds of the extra amino acids supplied by early PN were net wasted in urea. The above fi ndings were confi rmed in propensity scorematched subgroups of long-stay patients. The higher urea levels with early PN, rather than the kidney function as such, may have driven the observed longer duration of RRT, as supported by multiple regression analysis. Conclusion The extra amino acids supplied by early PN appeared ineffi cient to reverse the negative nitrogen balance, not because of insuffi cient amino acid delivery, but rather because of insuffi cient incorporation with, instead, increased degradation into urea. The substantial catabolism of the extra amino acids, leading to pronounced urea generation, may have prolonged the duration of RRT in the early PN group. Introduction Muscle weakness of critical illness is associated with prolonged dependency on ventilatory support and delayed rehabilitation. Muscle wasting related to poor nutrition has long been considered a major determinant, whereas the importance of myofi ber integrity only recently emerged [1] [2] [3] [4] . We hypothesized that nutrient restriction early during illness aggravates atrophy while preserving myofi ber integrity by activating the crucial cellular quality control pathway autophagy. The latter could be important to preserve muscle function. Methods Critically ill patients (n = 122) were randomized to early (early-PN) or late (late-PN) initiation of parenteral nutrition to complete failing enteral nutrition, while maintaining normoglycemia (80 to 110 mg/ dl) with insulin, in the EPaNIC study [5] . Vastus lateralis biopsies were harvested after 1 week and compared with matched controls (n = 20). Results As compared with controls, muscle from critically ill patients showed reduced myofi ber density, a shift to smaller (especially type I) myofi bers, lower myosin and actin mRNA, upregulated mRNA of the ubiquitin ligases muscle-ring-fi nger-1 and atrogin-1, a small increase in the autophagosome formation marker LC3-II/LC3-I, and increases in the autophagic substrates ubiquitin and p62 (all P ≤0.006). Late-PN, resulting in a larger caloric defi cit than early-PN, had no substantial impact on atrophy markers. In contrast, late-PN increased LC3-II/LC3-I (P = 0.02), which coincided with less accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins/aggregates (P = 0.05). Fewer patients on late-PN developed muscle weakness as compared with early-PN (42% vs. 68%, P = 0.05). In multivariable analysis, a lower LC3-II/LC3-I ratio (P = 0.05) and higher myofi ber density (P = 0.04) were independently associated with muscle weakness. Conclusion Early-PN did not counteract muscle atrophy whereas it suppressed autophagy and aggravated weakness. Statistically, muscle weakness was not explained by atrophy or wasting but rather by impaired autophagy and preservation of muscle density. Thus, tolerating nutrient restriction early during critical illness may preserve myofi ber integrity by activating autophagy. Introduction Closure of an acute hospitals emergency department (ED) has important ramifi cations for those centres expected to take up the resultant workload. The continued reconfi guration of emergency care is likely to produce an increasing number of these scenarios. Little evidence is available to support planning of such initiatives and thus the implications are diffi cult to anticipate. This study aims to demonstrate one hospital's experience of the rationalisation of emergency care and its eff ect on workload. Methods This retrospective study was conducted in a large teaching hospital. Activity data were analysed for a 12-month period following the closure of a neighbouring ED. The results were subsequently compared against the year prior to closure. Attendance, triage data, admission rates and waiting times were compared across the two periods, as were workload data for all grades of physician. The chisquared test was used to examine diff erences between groups. Results In the period studied, the gross attendance fi gure increased by 20,480 (33.72%), whilst the admission rate rose from 22 to 27%. Following closure of the neighbouring ED, the proportion of highacuity patients attending our institution increased dramatically, with the proportion of category one and two patients (Manchester Triage Scale) increasing by 8.33% (P = 0.076) and 18.80% (P <0.001), respectively. Likewise, ambulance arrivals increased out of proportion to the total increase in attendances (P = 0.016). Admissions from the ED to the ICU increased by 63.04%. Consultants workloads now include 50% more category 1 and 2 patients (P = 0.001). Conclusion Reconfi guration of emergency care can have dramatic implications for existing services; these may not always be anticipated. Rationalisation of ED's may result in a concentration of high-acuity patients accompanied by a downturn in the numbers of patients whose presentations are amenable to care delivered in other settings. This abrupt change in case mix requires a re-examination of existing workforces and their seniority. The average level of TCA in the study group was 1,116 ± 635 and TCA levels were positively correlated with the duration of QRS interval (P <0.01). In time-domain nonspectral evaluation, SDNN (P <0.001), SDNN (P <0.05), RMSDD (P <0.01), and pNN50 (P <0.01) were found signifi cantly lower in the TCA intoxication group compared with the control group, while NN50 (P <0.01) was signifi cantly higher in value. The spectral analysis (frequency domain) of data recorded at fi rst 5 minutes after intensive care admission showed that the values of the nLF (P <0.05) and LF/HF ratio (P = 0.001) were signifi cantly higher in the TCA intoxication group than the controls, while nHF (P = 0.001) values were signifi cantly lower. The frequency domain spectral analysis of data recorded at the last 5 minutes showed a lower nHF (P = 0.001) in the TCA intoxication group than the controls, and the LF/HF ratio was signifi cantly higher (P <0.05) in the intoxication group. SDNN (P <0.001), RMSDD (P <0.01), SDNNi (P <0.01), and pNN50 (P <0.01) levels were higher in patients with positive ECG fi ndings than those without positive ECG fi ndings. The LF/HF ratio was higher in seven children with seizures (P <0.001). Conclusion Existing fi ndings give us an idea about HRV's value to determine arrhythmia and predict convulsion risk in TCA poisonings. HRV can be used as a non-invasive method in determining the treatment and prognosis of TCA poisoning. Results HMMD receives an average of 30 cases of stroke monthly, and thrombolysis did not occur before the implementation of the TM Project, because of the lack of neurologists available to conduce the cases. After implementation of the TM Program, six cases of ischemic stroke were thrombolyzed with alteplase; only one case (16%) progressed to death from septic shock, and one case (16%) presented symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Conclusion Thrombolysis in ischemic stroke reduces 30% the risk of disability and 18% the mortality rate. This procedure has been only feasible to be done in the community setting because of the implementation of the TM Project, which permits the presence of a real time consultation with a specialized neurological team from a tertiary center. analyses, and then returned home. In total, 25.50% of patients were hospitalized in a medical or surgical department, and 12.42% in the short-term hospitalised unit of the emergency department (stay duration <24 hours). Some 5.10% of patients worsened and were oriented in the ICU. A total 3.77% of patients in a cardiac ICU. In total, 73.84% of patients had stay duration less than 6 hours in the ED, 24.45% <24 hours. Forty percent of patients supported by fi remen and 54% supported by private ambulance left the hospital after a single medical consultation. The total decrease in monthly patient infl ow from ED to the ICU and CCU was 30.1% (P = 0.003); that is, from the mean of 47.7 ± 8.2 to 33.3 ± 8.3 patients (Figure 1) <0.001) . The result is longer overall hospitalization of patients having WI (P < 0.001) and a higher number of surgeries (P <0.02). After the ER, 54% of patients with WI were hospitalized in the ICU (86% of them after surgery) but only 26% of patients involved in a CA (71% after surgery). As many patients with WI as involved in a CA (40%) were admitted to the ward (89% of patients with WI after surgery but only 63% of patients with injuries due to a CA). Thirty-three per cent of patients involved in a CA returned home and one was transferred, whereas only three patients with WI returned home after being in the ER, three patients were transferred and one died in the operating room. Observed paediatric mortality in our medical treatment facility was 2.9% (10 children out of 341): three children died of WI, three due to a CA and one of septic shock due to a medical cause. Conclusion War injuries are more prone to cause polytrauma than CA. According to the PTS, ISS, NISS, TRISS and ASCOT, children experiencing WI have higher severity scores and predicted mortality rate than others, stay longer in the hospital and have more surgeries.  Our research indicated that disaster medicine should be established systematically or it is necessary to compile a compendium of disaster medicine from a broad perspective or from a bird's-eye and long-term view. The Japanese version was tentatively completed with 22 volumes as of the fi nancial year 2005, of which nearly three-quarters are written in Japanese. Although this worked partly during the aboveshown catastrophe in Japan 2011, several problems are left to be solved; that is, the insuffi cient operation system of the Japan DMAT or Disaster Medical Assistant Team that seemed to have caused a large number of preventable deaths. Conclusion The large number of casualties during a major disaster is a global problem, even in the developed countries. When the role of the intensivist is reviewed, many roles were verifi ed to be important; that is, as a leader of a medical team or triage offi cer as well as a professional in the fi eld of specifi c intensive care. However, there are many problems to be solved in the fi elds of disaster medicine. In order to solve the diversifi cation or the various medical problems, it is necessary to compile or systematize a disaster medicine of the world version. The concept of the compendium and our process of trial are shown in relation to intensive care. There are distinct diff erences in the pathophysiology between medical cardiac arrests and TCA. Traumatic pathologies associated with an improved chance of successful resuscitation include hypoxia, tension pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade [1] . The authors believe a separate algorithm is required for the management of out-of-hospital TCA attended to by a highly trained physician and paramedic team. Methods A suggested algorithm for TCA was developed based on the Greater Sydney Area Helicopter Emergency Medical Service's standard operating procedures and current available evidence. Results An algorithm for the general management of TCA can be seen in Figure 1 . In TCA, priority should be given to catastrophic haemorrhage control (tourniquets, direct pressure, haemostatic agents, pelvic and long bone splintage) and volume resuscitation. Simultaneous oxygena tion optimisation should occur with proactive exclusion of tension pneumothoraces with bilateral open thoracostomies. Cardiac ultrasound (US) should be used to help exclude cardiac tamponade and assist in prognostication. The US presence of true cardiac standstill versus low pressure state/pseudo-PEA, and an ETCO 2 <1.3 kPa carries a grave prognosis in TCA. Given the high incidence of hypovolaemia, hypoxia and obstructive shock prior to TCA, the role of adrenaline and chest compressions are limited. Figure 2 shows a suggested algorithm for the management of penetrating TCA requiring prehospital thoracotomy. We identified 130 missions involving the winching of a physician, of which 120 case sheets were available for analysis. The majority of patients were traumatically injured (90%) and male (85%) with a median age of 37 years. Seven patients were pronounced life extinct on the scene. A total of 63 POI were performed on 48 patients. Administration of advanced analgesia was the most common POI making up 68.3% of interventions. Patients with abnormal RTSc 2 scores were more likely to receive a POI when compared with those with normal RTSc 2 (P = 0.03). The performance of POI had no effect on median scene times (45 vs. 43 minutes; P = 0.51). See Tables 1  and 2 . Conclusion Our high POI rate of 40% coupled with long rescue times and the occasional severe injuries supports the argument for winching doctors. Not doing so would deny a signifi cant proportion of patients time-critical interventions, advanced analgesia and procedural sedation.  The long thoracic nerve was found in the fi fth intercostal space in 16 of 32 cases, always in or posterior to the midaxillary line. Contrary to the description in Grays' Anatomy (40th edition) it terminated before the inferior border of serratus anterior. Most commonly it was found to end by branching in the fourth (right) or fi fth (left) intercostal space (range third to sixth). Lateral cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves were found in the fi fth intercostal space in 25 of 32 cases. Contrary to the description in Last's Anatomy (12th edition) they always passed anterior to the midaxillary line (and marker). Conclusion Placement 1 cm anterior to the midaxillary line minimises risk to the long thoracic nerve and lateral cutaneous branches of intercostal nerves. We therefore conclude that not all areas of the British Thoracic Society safe triangle are indeed safe, and anteroposterior placement should follow the European Trauma Course and ATLS guidelines: just anterior to the midaxillary line (for example, 1 cm). Introduction Whole body computed tomography (WBCT) appears to be useful for the early detection of clinically occult injury, although its indications have been controversial. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical prediction score to clarify the indications for blunt trauma patients with multiple injuries (MI) who require WBCT. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of 173 patients with blunt trauma who underwent WBCT at our emergency center between June 2011 and July 2012. We chose the presence or absence of MI (Injury Severity Score ≥15) in need of surgical intervention as the outcome variable. We used bivariate analyses to identify variables potentially predicting the presentation of MI. The predictor variables were confi rmed by multivariate logistic regression analyses. We assigned a score based on the corresponding coeffi cients. Results Among the 173 patients enrolled, 53 were in the MI group. Four predictors were found to be independently signifi cant by the logistic analysis: (1) body surface wound ≥3 regions, (2) positive focused assessment with sonography for trauma, (3) white blood cell count ≥11,000/μl, and (4) D-dimer ≥8 μg/ml. Score 1 was assigned to predictor (1), score 2 was assigned to predictors (2), (3) and (4). A prediction score was calculated for each patient by adding these scores. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.89. No patients with a score of 1 or less had MI (Figures 1 and 2) . Conclusion In patients with a score of 1 or 0, the presence of MI is less likely. These patients may not require WBCT, and selective CT scans of body parts based on clinical presentation should be considered. (Figure 1) . The most common intervention as a result of the ultrasound was initiation of a pressor infusion (33.3%), of which 71.4% were ionotropes. Additional therapies included blood transfusion (4.8%), heparin (9.5%), tPA (4.8%), cardiac catheterization (4.8%), and surgery (9.5%). ROSC was achieved in 37.5% of patients; average time to ROSC was 13 minutes. A total 33.3% of patients who underwent ALS were alive at hospital discharge and 28.6% at 1 year. Conclusion Focused cardiac ultrasound is a feasible adjunct to ALS resuscitation and may assist in the early identifi cation of reversible causes of cardiac arrest. Care must be taken to ensure no interruptions to cardiac compressions are made by performance during pulse checks. Further studies are needed to examine the outcomes associated with its integration into resuscitations. In the present study, we examined that about 90% of CA1 pyramidal cells in the adult gerbil hippocampus died at 4 days post ischemia; however, in the young hippocampus, about 56% of them died at 7 days post ischemia. We compared immunoreactivities and levels of CBPs, such as CB-D 28k, CR and PV. The immunoreactivities and protein levels of all the CBPs in the young sham were higher than those in the adult sham. In the adult, the immunoreactivities and protein levels of all the CBPs were markedly decreased at 4 days post ischemia; however, in the young, they were apparently maintained. At 7 days post ischemia, they were decreased in the young; however, they were much higher than those in the adult. Conclusion In brief, the immunoreactivities and levels of CBPs were not decreased in the ischemic CA1 region of the young 4 days after transient cerebral ischemia. This fi nding indicates that the longer maintenance of CBPs may contribute to a less and more delayed neuronal death/ damage in the young. delay in reaching target temperature [1] . We hypothesize that early and rapid induction of hypothermia will mitigate neuronal injury and improve survival in a swine model of TBI. Methods Twenty domestic cross-bred pigs (34 to 35 kg) were subjected to a 5 ATM (100 ms) lateral fl uid percussion TBI. The brain temperature and ICP were measured using Camino®. Serum biomarkers for neuronal injury -S-100β, neuron-specifi c enolase, glial fi brillary acid protein (GFAP), and neurofi laments heavy chain -were measured daily using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Twelve of the injured animals were rapidly cooled to 32°C within 90 minutes of the injury using a transpulmonary hypothermia technique [2] . Hypothermia was maintained for 48 hours. Eight injured control animals were maintained at 37°C. In both groups, anesthesia (isofl urane 1%) was discontinued and the animals were weaned off the ventilator after 48 hours. Five days post injury, the surviving animals were euthanized and necropsied. The data were analyzed using a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test, and ANOVA. Results Ten of the 12 hypothermia and four of the eight normothermia animals survived to the end of the 5-day study (χ 2 = 2.597, df = 1, P = 0.1071). Although the probability of type I error between survival curves was 11%, the study was clinically signifi cant and showed a clear trend toward improved survival with hypothermia. The intracranial pressures were signifi cantly (P <0.05) lower in the hypothermia group. Both interventions -that is, general anesthesia and hypothermiamitigated the rise of serum biomarkers following TBI. However, the suppression of biomarkers was sustained during the recovery period only in the hypothermia group. With the exception of the GFAP levels, the curves of all biomarkers were signifi cantly diff erent between the groups. Conclusion Our preliminary fi ndings show early initiation, rapid induction, and prolonged maintenance (48 hours) of cerebral hypothermia to lower intracranial pressure, blunt the rise in serum biomarkers, and improve survival following TBI. References Introduction Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a contributing factor to approximately one-third of all injury-related deaths in the USA annually. Updated statistical records for TBI in Egypt are lacking. The current research is aiming to estimate the prevalence of TBI in Egypt in order to develop a comprehensive TBI prevention program. Methods A 1-year period (one calendar month every quarter of 2010) descriptive epidemiological study of moderate and severe TBI cases admitted to the emergency department, Cairo main university hospital. The data collection sheet included personal data (age, sex and residency), incident-related data (cause, nature and time of injury) and both clinical and radiological fi ndings. Introduction One of the most used prognostic models for traumatic brain injury is the IMPACT-TBI model, which predicts 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcome. Our aim was to study whether adding markers of coagulation improves the model's predictive power when accounting for extracranial injury. Methods Patients with a TBI admitted to a designated trauma center in 2009/10 were screened retrospectively and included according to the IMPACT study criteria. The predictive outcome was calculated for included patients using the full IMPACT-TBI model. To assess coagulopathy and extracranial injury we used the prothrombin time percentage (PT), platelet count (10 9 ), and injury severity score (ISS Introduction Evidence suggest that endogenous lactate, produced by aerobic glycolysis, is an important substrate for neurons, particularly in conditions of increased energy demand. This study aimed to examine brain lactate metabolism in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (STBI). Methods A prospective cohort of STBI patients monitored with cerebral microdialysis (CMD) and brain tissue oxygen (PbtO 2 ) was studied. Brain lactate metabolism was assessed by quantifi cation of elevated CMD lactate samples (>4 mmol/l). These were matched to pyruvate and PbtO 2 , and dichotomized as hyperglycolytic (CMD pyruvate >119 μmol/l) versus nonhyperglycolytic or as hypoxic (PbtO 2 <20 mmHg) versus nonhypoxic. Data were expressed as percentages per patient. Global brain perfusion (categorized as oligemic, normal or hyperemic) was assessed with CT perfusion (CTP). Results Twenty-four patients (total 1,782 CMD samples) were studied. Samples with elevated CMD lactate were frequently observed (41 ± 8% SEM of individual samples). Brain lactate elevations were predominantly hyperglycolytic (73 ± 8.2%), whilst only 14 ± 6.3% of them were hypoxic. Trends over time of both lactate patterns are shown in Figure 1 . On CTP (n = 17; average 48 hours from TBI) hyperglycolytic lactate was always associated with normal or hyperemic CTP, whilst hypoxic lactate was associated with oligemic CTP (Table 1) .  The median cumulative epinephrine dose in the animals that received the vasopressin infusion was 715 mg with a 25th to 75th interquartile range (IQR) of 320 to 930 mg. The median cumulative epinephrine dose in the control group was 2,044 mg (IQR 1,640 to 2,344 mg). This was statistically signifi cant (P = 0.003), based on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Conclusion A low-dose infusion of vasopressin can signifi cantly reduce vasopressor requirements and improves hemodynamics in hypothermic, brain-injured swine. This hemodynamic stability may improve neurological outcomes. Introduction Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and of severe neurologic sequelae. Long-term functional outcome of TBI and its best timing of assessment are not well understood, and may be evaluated too prematurely in clinical studies because of resources required to do so without too much missing data. Hence, we conducted a systematic review of studies in severe TBI patients to evaluate the long-term functional outcome. We hypothesized that functional impact measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), or the extended version (GOSe), may plateau after several months in patients with severe TBI. Methods We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies (prospective and retrospective) in patients with severe TBI. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, BIOSIS, CINAHL and Trip Database from their inception to December 2011. References of included studies were searched for additional studies. Two reviewers independently determined study eligibility and collected data. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of unfavourable functional outcome (GOS 1 to 3 or GOSe 1 to 4) at 6 to 12 months, 12 to 18 months, 18 to 24 months and more than 24 months after severe TBI. We calculated Freeman Tukey-type arcsine squareroot transformations and pooled data using random-eff ect models. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I 2 test and sensitivity analyses were based on a priori hypotheses. In total, 4,432 studies were assessed for eligibility; 209 studies (n = 31,540) were included. In the 188 studies using the GOS, a poor functional outcome was observed in 56.6% (95% CI = 54.0 to 59.1%, I 2 = 91%), 51.9% (95% CI = 38.0 to 59.0%, I 2 = 84%), 57.0% (95% CI = 48.2 to 55.5%, I 2 = 93%) and 56.9% (95% CI = 48.2 to 65.1%, I 2 = 93%) of patients at 6 to 12 months, 12 to 18 months, 18 to 24 months and beyond 24 months, respectively. In the 18 studies using GOSe, a poor functional outcome was observed in 62.9% of patients at 6 to 12 months (95% CI = 55.9 to 69.2%, I 2 = 90%) and 54.6% at 12 to 18 months (95% CI = 43.2 to 65.8%, I 2 = 90%). Heterogeneity was present in most analyses and was not entirely explained by the planned sensitivity analyses. Conclusion Considering that the incidence of patients with an unfavourable outcome remained constant at diff erent assessments, a follow-up of severe TBI patients longer than 12 months does not provide incremental information. Functional outcomes measured longer than 12 months after the injury may not be warranted in clinical studies. Introduction Prevention of secondary brain injury is the cornerstone in the management of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Although a variety of monitoring methods are available, due to lack of strong evidence their use varies considerably [1] . The objective of this survey was to provide an overview of the current practice in monitoring of patients with severe TBI in all neuro-ICUs across the UK. Introduction Pulmonary complications are frequently occurring medical complications after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) [1] . Early respiratory deterioration (ERD) may be associated with delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) or outcome and would then be a potential target for therapeutic interventions. We investigated whether respiratory deterioration within the fi rst 72 hours after admission predicted DCI or poor outcome. All WFNSpt 1 to 2 patients completed neuropsychological tests at each time point. WFNSpt 3 and WFNS 4 patients were testable in 80% and 50% of the cases respectively at early time points. WFNS 5 patients were not testable at any time point. In all testable patients, cognitive functions were severely impaired at early time points. At 3 months in WFNS 1 to 3 a good recovery of language defi cits while only a partial recovery of attention, memory and executive functions were observed; at the same time point 70% of WFNS 4 patients became testable, but they had a worse recovery of all cognitive functions. At 1 month after SAH less than 30% of patients return to work, at 3 months approximately 50%. Despite a good recovery of everyday life activities at 3 months, for all patients quality of life was lower than a normal population. Conclusion Cognitive dysfunction has diff erent time courses after aSAH: signifi cant defi cits in diff erent cognitive domains, worse quality of life and diffi culties in return to work persist in more than 50% of patients at 3 months following SAH. Results Pretreatment with 20 mg/kg, but not 10 mg/kg, of ASA-DA protected against ischemic neuronal death and damage, and its neuroprotective eff ect was much more pronounced than that of ASA or DA alone. In addition, treatment with 20 mg/kg ASA-DA reduced the ischemia-induced activation of astrocytes and microglia. Conclusion Our fi ndings indicate that ASA-DA, a new synthetic drug, prevents against transient focal cerebral ischemia, which provides a resource for the development of its clinical application for stroke. Introduction Acute neurological injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Global prevalence and regional disparities of etiology, interventions, and outcomes are unknown. The aim of this point-prevalence study was to measure the burden of pediatric neurological injury and to describe variations in interventions and outcomes in ICUs. Methods One hundred and three ICUs on six continents enrolled subjects on 4 specifi c days in a 1-year period. Included subjects were between ages 7 days and 17 years who were diagnosed with acute traumatic brain injury, stroke, cardiac arrest, central nervous system infection or infl ammation, status epilepticus, spinal cord lesion, hydrocephalus, or brain mass. Sites completed a secure web-based case report form that included subject and hospital demographics, details about the neurological disease, interventions, length of stay, and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) score (good outcome = PCPC 1 to 3) and mortality at hospital discharge. Results Of 3,113 subjects screened, 1,009 (32%) met enrollment criteria. The mean number of subjects enrolled per site for each study day was 2.4. Most sites were dedicated pediatric ICUs with a mean number of 22 ICU beds (range 3 to 72). ICUs had resources to invasively monitor intracranial pressure (93%), continuous electroencephalography (14%), invasive and non-invasive brain tissue oxygenation (14% and 57%), and somatosensory evoked potentials (39%). There were on average 11 ICU faculty and six fellows per site, and nearly one-half reported a neurocritical care ICU team. Subjects were 58% male and 52% white, and 60% had normal pre-admission PCPC scores (85%). Status epilepticus and cardiac arrest (both 21%) had the highest prevalence. Sixty-one per cent of subjects were mechanically ventilated during ICU admission. ICU length of stay was a mean 29 days (median 43 days) and hospital LOS was a mean 43 days (median 61 days). Survival at hospital discharge was 87% with 58% of subjects discharged home and 17% to inpatient rehabilitation. Conclusion Acute neurological disease is a signifi cant pediatric health issue. These data suggest a vital need for increased research and healthcare resources to assist in the challenge of improving outcomes for these children.  We found that LPVH correlated with SCT, PAT and TEG. However, our proposed method is more voluminous: indexes ICC (the intensity of the contact phase of coagulation), t1 (the time for the contact phase of coagulation), and AO (initial rate of aggregation of blood) are consistent with PAT; indexes ICD (the intensity of coagulation drive), CTA (a constant thrombin activity) and CP (the clot intensity of the polymerization) are consistent with SCT and TEG. In addition, the advantage of this method is to determine the intensity of fi brinolysiswith the indicator IRIS (the intensity of the retraction and clot lysis). Conclusion LPVH allows one to make a total assessment of all parts of hemostasis: from initial viscosity and platelet aggregation to coagulation and lysis of clots, as well as their interaction. These fi gures are objective and informative, as evidenced by close correlation with the performance of traditional coagulation methods. prophylaxis in orthopedics or in cases of acute coronary syndromes. The main drawback of FOND is that routine monitoring is not currently available. This could be a problem during the management of critical and surgical patients, especially in cases of old patients and renal failure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of thromboelastography (TEG) to determine the level of anticoagulation due to FOND in a surgical population. In total, 1,787 cardiac surgical patients were included. A total of 19 (1.1%) patients developed TRALI within 24 hours following surgery. Patients developing TRALI were older compared with patients not developing TRALI, mean age respectively 71 and 65 years (P = 0.035). Furthermore, patients developing TRALI had higher APACHE II, APACHE IV, EURO and ASA score (P = 0.000, P = 0.000, P = 0.000 and P = 0.37 Introduction Volume resuscitation is essential to restore normovolemia during hemorrhagic shock, burns and sepsis. However, synthetic colloids cause dilutional coagulopathy. The aims were to determine whether the natural colloid albumin induces a lesser degree of coagulopathy compared with synthetic colloids, and the comparative eff ectiveness of fi brinogen concentrate to reverse coagulopathy following dilution with these solutions. Methods Rotational thromboelastometry-based tests were used to examine coagulation parameters in samples from 10 healthy volunteers, in undiluted blood and samples diluted 1:1 with saline, was seen for samples diluted with synthetic colloids (P <0.001) but not albumin (P = 0.10). Following addition of fi brinogen, FIBTEM MCF, EXTEM MCF and EXTEM AA were signifi cantly higher, and EXTEM CFT was signifi cantly shorter in samples diluted with albumin versus those treated with HES or dextran (P ≤0.001). Conclusion Hemodilution using albumin induced a lesser degree of coagulopathy compared with the synthetic colloids HES and dextran. In addition, albumin-induced coagulopathy was more eff ectively reversed following addition of fi brinogen concentrate compared with coagulopathy induced by synthetic colloids. Comparative assessment of the diff erent fl uid modalities is hampered by a paucity of direct trials. We present a network meta-analysis for assessing the relative eff ectiveness of two fl uid treatments in sepsis when they have not been compared directly in a randomized trial but have each been compared with a common treatment. Methods A systematic review of trials sepsis yielded 13 trials for assessment in network meta-analysis. The indirect comparison between albumin, HES and crystalloid was conducted using Bayesian methods for binomial likelihood, fi xed-eff ects network meta-analysis with a Monte Carlo Gibbs sampling method. Studies in septic patients with crystalloid as a reference treatment compared with any formulation of the colloid treatments albumin or HES were included, as were direct head-to-head trials between the two colloids. Results Odds ratios between the diff erent treatments were obtained ( Figure 1 ). Ranking the interventions [1] demonstrated that albumin ranked highest in lowering mortality at a 96.4% probability compared with 3.6% and 0.01% for crystalloid and HES, respectively. Conclusion Albumin as a fl uid therapy in sepsis is associated with the lowest mortality of the three modalities studied. (SAP), SV and CO were recorded directly before the administration of any colloid (T0) and every 5 minutes for the next 1 hour (T1 to T12). Kolmogorov-Smirnov was used to test normal distribution of data and ANOVA was used for the statistical analysis. P <0.05 was considered statistically signifi cant. Results Demographic data and ASA classifi cation did not diff er statistically signifi cant among the six groups of the study. CO, SV, HR and SAP did not show any statistically signifi cant evolution compared with their baseline value during the study period. Moreover, there were no statistically signifi cant diff erences among the six study groups with regard to any of the recorded parameters. Conclusion According to our results, volume replacement with the six colloids tested in our study did not result in any hemodynamic response. Within comparison of these six colloids did not reveal any statistically signifi cant diff erence in any of the parameters recorded according to our protocol.  Methods The study is based on 1,008 patients who received procedural sedation with propofol in the emergency department between December 2006 and March 2012. Patients were selected and sedated to a strict protocol by ED consultant staff . We applied the AE tool by performing a search through patient records, discussion with consultants performing the sedation and consensus opinion. Results From 1,008 cases we identifi ed 11 sentinel (six of hypotension, fi ve cases of hypoxia), 34 moderate, 25 minor and three minimal risk adverse events. Of the 565 surveys distributed, 360 were completed (63.7%). The majority of respondents were ICU nurses (79%). Delirium was considered a major problem (83%) that requires adequate treatment (99%) and is underdiagnosed (81%). Respondents considered that routine screening of delirium can improve prognosis (95%). However, only a minority (20%) answered that delirium is preventable. Only 39% of the respondents had received any training about delirium in the previous 3 years and 77% of them found training useful. The mean delirium knowledge score was 6.6 out of 10 (SD = 1.54). When all groups were mutually compared, nurses scored lower than delirium experts (ANOVA, P = 0.013). The respondents (58%; n = 210) from three ICUs indicated that CAM-ICU assessment was department policy. However, 50% (n = 106) of these respondents felt unfamiliar with CAM-ICU and only 47% (n = 99) of them indicated that a positive CAM-ICU was used for treatment decisions. Haloperidol was the fi rst-choice pharmacological treatment. Only 21% of all respondents knew that a national ICU delirium guideline existed, but in-depth knowledge was generally low. Conclusion Our survey showed that healthcare professionals considered delirium an important but underdiagnosed form of organ failure. In contrast, screening tools for delirium are scarcely used, knowledge can be improved and protocolled treatment based on positive screening is often lacking. These results suggest that the focus of implementation of ICU delirium management should not be on motivational aspects, but on knowledge improvements, training in screening tools and implementation of treatment and prevention protocols. Introduction Delirium is an acute disturbance of consciousness and cognition. It is a common disorder in the ICU and associated with impaired long-term outcome [1, 2] . Despite its frequency and impact, delirium is poorly recognized by ICU physicians and nurses using delirium screening tools [3] . A completely new approach to detect delirium is to use monitoring of physiological alterations. Temperature variability, a measure for temperature regulation, could be an interesting parameter for monitoring of ICU delirium, but this has never been investigated before. The aim of this study was to investigate whether temperature variability is aff ected during ICU delirium. We included 47 patients with a total of 59 measurements. In 28 cases patients had positive response to furosemide. Median RI in responders was 0.67 (range 0.55 to 0.78) and in nonresponders 0.79 (range 0.58 to 0.81); P = 0.027. Construction of receiver operating characteristic curve showed 83% sensitivity and 81% specifi city for the cutoff RI 0.73. No other measured patient characteristic was found to be predictive of response to diuretic treatment. Conclusion Our results show that the RI could be used to guide diuretic treatment in nonhypovolemic, nonhypotensive septic patients. Further studies are needed to confi rm those preliminary results. Introduction As a proof of concept, the potential added value of chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) as a more early and specifi c diagnostic parameter for acute kidney injury (AKI) was investigated in adult ICU patients that underwent elective cardiac surgery. . Conclusion SDMA appears to be an accurate and precise estimate of GFR and a more sensitive biomarker of renal dysfunction than SCr. We predict SDMA will perform better than SCr as a biomarker of AKI. This forms the basis of a future study. Introduction Growing evidence hints that bidirectional interaction between heart failure and kidney disease and renal insuffi ciency is a strong predictor of mortality as well as causally linked to the progression of heart failure. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is an early predictor of acute kidney injury (AKI). We evaluated the impact of NGAL on morbidity and mortality in patients with acute heart failure. Methods Seventy-six patients presenting with symptoms consistent with acute heart failure (median age 72 years, 56% male) were enrolled. Plasma NGAL levels were measured by an ELISA at admission and compared with the glomerular fi ltration rate (eGFR) and B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. The primary outcome was AKI development defi ned by RIFLE criteria (fall in GFR >25% or creatinine rise ≥50% from baseline, or a fall in urine output <0.5 ml/kg/hour) and secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. Conclusion NGAL is emerging as a promising biomarker of AKI in the setting of acute heart failure and elevated NGAL levels indicate a poor prognosis in this population regarding morbidity and mortality. Introduction AKI is a common occurrence in sick hospitalized patients, in particular those admitted to intensive care. Published data suggest that 4 to 5% of all critically ill patients develop severe AKI and require initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) [1, 2] . Such patients have high mortality rates often exceeding 60% [2] . We aimed to review the outcomes of patients admitted to the ICU and required renal replacement therapy for AKI. We examined whether aetiology of AKI, comorbidity burden, hospital length of stay and treatment in ICU had any signifi cant association with survival in the study cohort. Methods During 2009, 56 patients were identifi ed to have received RRT with AKI who were admitted to the ICU at the Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust. Computerised and paper-based case records were examined for these patients to collect the data. AKIN classifi cation was used to classify the severity of AKI. Conclusion Individuals who develop dialysis-dependent AKI in the ICU setting in general terms either die or recover. Sepsis is the most common association with death. The need for mechanical ventilation and inotropic therapy are both associated with increased incidence of death. The average quantity of the substitutive renal therapy procedures in the CG was 13.4 ± 0.7, in the IG it was 8 ± 0.6 (P <0.05). The recuperation of the renal excretory functions was on 19 ± 1 day in 12 patients of the CG, and on 11 ± 1.3 day in the IG, from the moment of substitutive renal therapy start (P <0.05). Lethality in the CG was 43% (nine patients), and in the IG it was 29% (six patients, P <0.05). The duration of the MLV in the CG and IG was 21 ± 1.2 days and 16 ± 1.2, respectively (P <0.05). In the IG the duration of the ICU was lower by 23%, hospitality duration was lower by 17% (P <0.05). Conclusion The effi ciency of the substitutive renal therapy depends directly on the hydroelectrolytic and metabolic changes and toxicosis degrees in the polytrauma complicated by multiple organ failure syndrome. The early start of the dialysis methods treatment allows one to achieve the earlier recuperation of the renal functions and to decrease the lethality level by 14%. Methods Seventeen septic patients with AKI treated with vancomycin and seven patients with gentamicin on CVVH were included. In the vancomycin group, patients received the fi rst dose of 1.0 g intravenously followed by 1.0 g/12 hours if not adjusted. In the gentamicin group, patients received a loading dose of 240 mg followed by a maintenance dose every 24 hours. The vancomycin maintenance dose was optimized to achieve AUC 0-24 /MIC ≥400 (Cmin >10 mg/l), gentamicin target was Cmax/MIC of 8 to 10. Maintenance doses were adjusted according to drug level simulation using a pharmacokinetic programme. The median vancomycin total clearance (Cltot) was 0.89 and 0.55 ml/minute/kg on the fi rst and second day of the study. CRRT clearance accounted for about 50 to 60% of vancomycin Cltot found in a population with normal renal function (0.97 ml/minute/kg). Vancomycin serum concentrations after the fi rst dose were below the required target of 10 mg/l as early as 6 hours in 10 patients. AUC 0-24 / MIC ≥400 ratio was achieved in 67% of patients on the fi rst day. The median gentamicin Cltot was 0.68 and 0.79 ml/minute/kg on the fi rst and second day of the study. CRRT clearance accounted for about 50% of gentamicin Cltot found in a population without renal impairment (0.73 ml/minute/kg). The target Cmax/MIC ratio was achieved in 78% of patients after the fi rst dose. Conclusion CVVH at a fi ltration rate of 45 ml/kg/hour leads to high removal of both antibiotics. Due to rapid change in patient's clinical status it was impossible to predict a fi xed dosage regimen. We recommend administration of unreduced loading dose and: blood sampling as early as 6 hours after fi rst vancomycin dose; blood sampling 30 to 60 minutes after gentamicin administration and before the next dose; and the maintenance dose should be based on druglevel monitoring. CRRT. The aim was to evaluate the eff ects on electrolyte and acid-base status of a new RCA-CVVH protocol using an 18 mmol/l citrate solution combined with a phosphate-containing replacement fl uid, compared with a previously adopted RCA-CVVH protocol combining a 12 mmol/l citrate solution with a conventional replacement fl uid. Methods Until September 2011, RCA-CVVH was routinely performed in our centre with a 12 mmol/l citrate solution and a postdilution replacement fl uid with bicarbonate (HCO 3 -32, Ca 2+ 1.75, Mg 2+ 0.5, K + 2 mmol/l) (protocol A). In cases of metabolic acidosis, not related to inappropriate citrate metabolism and persisting after optimization of RCA-CVVH parameter setting, bicarbonate infusion was scheduled. Starting from September 2011, in order to optimize buff er balance and to reduce the need for phosphate supplementation, a new RCA-CVVH protocol has been designed using an 18 mmol/l citrate solution combined with a recently introduced phosphate-containing replacement fl uid with bicarbonate (HCO 3 - Conclusion Protocol B provided a buff er balance more positive than protocol A and allowed one to adequately control acid-base status without additional bicarbonate infusion and in the absence of alkalosis, despite the use of a standard bicarbonate concentration replacement solution. Furthermore, the combination of a phosphate-containing replacement fl uid appeared eff ective to prevent hypophosphatemia. Introduction The aim of this study was to establish the intraobserver and interobserver variation of ultrasonographic measurements of the rectus femoris muscle cross-section area (RF-CSA). Muscle wasting is frequent in the ICU, aff ecting more than one-half of the patients with severe sepsis [1] . Muscle mass reduces rapidly, and 15 to 20% is lost within the fi rst week [1] . To monitor muscle mass, ultrasound has the benefi ts of being both readily available in the ICU and non-invasive. Ultrasonographic measurement of RF-CSA has an almost perfect correlation with MRI (mean interclass correlation (ICC) = 0.999) [2] and RF-CSA is linearly related to maximum voluntary contraction strength in both healthy subjects and COPD patients (r = 0.78) [3] . Methods The study had two purposes: to determine the intraobserver variation for RF-CSA by one observer scanning 15 healthy adult volunteers three times each at 2-day intervals; and to determine the interobserver variation for RF-CSA by two observers each scanning 15 adult ICU patients on the same day. Patients were in a supine position, legs in passive extension. The transducer was placed perpendicular to the long axis of the right thigh over the RF, two-thirds of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the superior patellar border [1] . RF-CSA was calculated by planimetry. At each scan, three measurements were made. For intraobserver variation, the 3×3 scans were analyzed using the interclass correlation coeffi cient. For interobserver variation, the three measurements from each observer were averaged and compared using Bland-Altman statistics. Results Intraobserver variation: 15 healthy adults, age 39.6 ± 2.4 years, weight 66.8 ± 2.3 kg, sex three male/12 female. ICC: 0.996 (95% CI: 0.990 to 0.998). Interobserver variation: 15 ICU patients, age: 77 ± 8.3 years, weight: 71.3 ± 9.1 kg, sex nine male/six female. Bland-Altman: bias: -0.07 cm 2 , 95% limits of agreement -0.188 to 0.048 cm 2 . Conclusion Ultrasonographic measurement of RF-CSA is easily learned and quickly performed. It has a very low intraobserver and interobserver variation and can be recommended as a reliable method for monitoring muscle wasting in the ICU. The main results, from four preliminary experiments, are shown in Figure 1 . In the presence of glutamate plus malate, only platelets incubated with a high dose of metformin had a mitochondrial VO 2 signifi cantly lower than controls. In the presence of succinate, mitochondrial VO 2 of controls did not change signifi cantly whereas that of platelets incubated with metformin did. The eff ect of succinate tended to become larger as the dose of metformin was increased from 0 up to 166 mg/l (0.3 ± 0.2 vs. 0.6 ± 0.3 vs. 1.0 ± 0.3 nmol/minute*10 6 cells) (P = 0.068). Even so, mitochondrial VO 2 of platelets incubated with the highest dose of metformin did not return to the levels of controls. Extra-mitochondrial VO 2 was always the same. Introduction Metformin, widely used as an antidiabetic drug, activates the AMP activated protein kinase, a key regulator of the metabolism providing protection under fuel defi ciency. Chronic metformin therapy has been shown in long-term follow-up clinical studies to reduce cardiovascular mortality [1] . In animal experiments, acute metformin pretreatment has been shown to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury on cardiomyocytes [2] . We want to evaluate whether outcomes are aff ected in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Introduction Metformin, an oral hypoglycemic drug, belongs to the biguanide class and is now generally accepted as fi rst-line treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially in overweight patients [1] . In some predisposing conditions, the use of metformin may result in metforminassociated lactic acidosis (MALA), a rare adverse event associated with a high mortality rate [2] . The aim of this study is to assess risk factors and prognostic factors in patients with MALA. [4] . In our study, a higher plasma concentration of lactate represents the main negative prognostic factor, as pointed out by other studies [5] . The prothrombin activity, which is considered to be a decisive prognostic factor in the study of Peters and colleagues [6] , was not impaired in patients with poor outcome. Introduction Stress hyperglycemia in the critically ill is a complex process in which insulin signaling is systematically hijacked to provide energy substrate for metabolic priorities such as cell healing or infection containment. Fluctuating levels of plasma glucose are associated with increased mortality in the ICU [1] . We develop a multiscale mathematical model that can characterize the severity of stress hyperglycemia based on a fundamental understanding of the signaling molecules involved. Methods Insulin resistance following insult has been shown to be driven primarily by the immune response via the cytokine IL-6 [2] . We created a multiscale mathematical model that links circulating glucose and insulin concentration dynamics from the extended minimal model [3] to a cellular insulin response model [4] that captures insulinmediated glucose uptake in an insulin-responsive cell. Results Inhibitory dynamics driven by IL-6 were incorporated into the cellular model to attenuate an insulin signaling intermediate (insulin receptor substrate 1) according to the proposed biological mechanisms. The percentage reduction in glucose uptake as a function of IL-6 concentration was fi t to data from patients who underwent elective abdominal surgery [2] , shown in Figure 1 . The overall multiscale model captures decreased insulin signaling as a result of increased IL-6 levels and the subsequent hyperglycemia that may ensue. Introduction Hyperglycemia is frequently encountered in critically ill patients, and associated with adverse outcome. Improvement of glucose protocol adherence may be accomplished using electronic alerts. We confi gured a non-intrusive real-time electronic alert, called a GLYC sniff er, as part of our Intensive Care Information System (ICIS) that continuously evaluates the occurrence of persistent hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Conclusion A real-time electronic persistent glycemia sniff er resulted in a signifi cantly higher proportion of normoglycemia, without increasing the variability. Furthermore, hypoglycemic events occurred less frequently, and were resolved more timely. Smart alerting is able to improve quality of care, while diminishing the problem of alert fatigue. Introduction A recent study showed that hyperglycaemia (blood glucose ≥7.8 mmol/l) in nondiabetic patients hospitalised in a medical ICU is associated with increased risk of diabetes [1] . We investigated a large mixed ICU population to confi rm these results. Methods This study retrospectively included patients with negative history of diabetes admitted to ICUs during the year 2007. We excluded patients receiving steroids, with newly diagnosed diabetes and those with end-stage disease. Patients were followed-up 5 years after index admission. Diagnosis of diabetes within 6 months from the index admission was presumed as revealing DM at inclusion, which excluded the patient. Patients who were taking glucocorticoids during the followup period were excluded. Diabetics were identifi ed from ICD-9 documentation. Propensity score for death (pDead) was computed from either SAP1 (MIMICII) or APACHE III (HIDENIC) to assess the risk of death. Hypoglycemia was defi ned as AVG ≤60 mg/dl. AVG was computed as the area under the glucose curve throughout ICU admission. Mortality was examined within bins (each bin is categorized by a 10 mg/dl increase in AVG) and was compared between adjacent categories using a chi-square test. The same method was repeated among diabetics, nondiabetics, patients with lower (pDead greater than median) and higher (pDead lower than  We included 139 patients with HIV/AIDS admitted to the ICU. Median age was 40 (31 to 48) years and 71% were male. Severe malnutrition was common (34%). The CD4 cell count was 84 (25 to 274) cells/mm 3 and viral load was 17,733 (67 to 174,214) copies/ml; 57% had at least one opportunistic infection; 55% had used antiretroviral therapy previous to ICU admission. Mechanical ventilation was used by 46% of patients and hospital mortality was 42%. Total SOFA score was 5 (2 to 9) points. Cardiovascular dysfunction was the most common on the fi rst day of stay (51%), followed by respiratory (42%), neurological (40%), renal (35%), hematological (27%) and hepatic (17%). Cardiovascular and renal dysfunctions presented with higher rate of severe dysfunction (30% and 15%, respectively). Rates of neurological (P = 0.002), renal (P = 0.009) and hematological (P = 0.003) dysfunctions were higher in nonsurvivors. Age, CD4 cell count, malnutrition, and opportunistic infections were included in the multivariate analysis. Neurological dysfunction was the independent risk factor for hospital mortality (odds 3.2 (1.4 to 7.2)). The presence of neurological dysfunction was dichotomized: associated or not with primary neurological diagnosis; survival was lower in the patients with neurological dysfunction and without primary neurological diagnosis (log-rank test 0.001 in the 7-day and 0.02 in the 28-day analysis). Sixty-day survival was similar in primary and secondary neurological dysfunction, but it remained lower than in patients without neurological impairment. Conclusion Neurological dysfunction was independently associated with hospital survival, mainly in those AIDS critically patients without primary neuropathy. Results A total of 273 charts were reviewed. In total, 242 were categorized into A (n = 126), B (n = 79) or C (n = 37). D (n = 31) consisted mainly of patients with hematological malignancies (n = 12) and patients with chemotherapy or immunosuppressive treatment (n = 14). The groups diff ered in length of stay with A< B< C. During the fi rst 3 days the SOFA score was higher in A compared with C and in B compared with C. The duration of antibiotic therapy was longer in both B and C compared with A. There were no diff erences in 28-day mortality (A: 34/126 = 27%, B: 30/79 = 38%, C: 15/37 = 40%); however, the proportions of patients dying between days 8 and 28 were higher in B (14/63 = 22%) and C (7/29 = 24%) compared with A (5/95 = 5%). Conclusion In this retrospective material it was possible to categorize 88.6% of all patients as having primary, secondary or tertiary sepsis. The categories diff ered in clinical picture at presentation as well as in outcome. A prospective study is warranted to validate the results of this study. Conclusion Older people represent a growing proportion of the population although their representation in the critical care population remained constant in this 10-year study. These patients had a slightly higher median APACHE II score and 14.5% greater critical care mortality than the younger patients. The majority of survivors were able to go home; however, 31% died within 22 months with signifi cant life expectancy curtailment, surviving on average only 7.4 months after discharge; this has not changed in the last 10 years. Those who survived this initial period (69%) had a much better outlook. This information may be vital to patients and physicians when discussing admission to critical care. Reference Of the 150 responders, 31% had adverse psychological outcome, defi ned as PTSS-10 >35 and/or HADS subscales ≥8. After analysis, six predictors with weighted risk scores were included in the screening instrument: major pre-existing disease, being a parent to children younger than 18 years of age, previous psychological problems, in-ICU agitation, being unemployed or sick-listed at ICU admission and appearing depressed in the ICU. Each predictor corresponded to a given risk score. The total risk score, the sum of individual risk scores, was related to the probability for adverse psychological outcome in the individual patient. The predictive accuracy of the screening instrument, as assessed with area under the receiver operating curve, was 0.77. When categorizing patients in three risk probability groups -low (0 to 29%), moderate (30 to 59%) and high (60 to 100%) risk -the actual prevalence of adverse psychological outcome in respective groups was 12%, 50% and 63%. Conclusion The preliminary screening instrument may aid ICU clinicians in identifying patients at risk for adverse psychological outcome after critical illness. Prior to wider clinical use, external validation is needed.  We created a DBN for the analysis of MODS studying the relations between organ failures at diff erent times. The DBN was made so that each organ failure is dependent on the previous one. We also considered a corrective factor to take account that not all patients completed the observation. Using software (GeNie) we obtained the probabilities of the organ failure sequences. Conclusion The use of DBNs, although with our limited set of data, allowed us to identify the most likely organ dysfunction sequences associated with a fi rst known one. Capability to predict these sequences in a patient makes DBNs a promising prognostic tool for physicians in order to treat patients in a timely manner, or to test a treatment effi cacy. Introduction Assessing whether a critically ill patient should be admitted to an ICU remains diffi cult and mortality amongst ICU patients is high. To render intensive care with no prospect of success is an immense emotional burden for both patient and relatives, and a great socioeconomic burden for society as well. Therefore, validated strategies that can help identify patients who will benefi t from intensive care are in demand. This study seeks to investigate whether preadmission quality of life can act as a predictor of mortality amongst patients admitted to the ICU. Methods All patients (>18 years) admitted to the ICU for more than 24 hours are included. In order to assess preadmission quality of life, the patient or close relatives complete the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) within 72 hours after ICU admission. Mortality is evaluated from ICU admission until 30 days hereafter. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses are employed to assess predictive value for mortality using fi ve models: Introduction Long-term compromise after traumatic injury is signifi cant; however, few modifi able factors that infl uence outcome have been identifi ed. The aim of this study was to identify acute and early post-acute predictors of long-term recovery amenable to change through intervention. Methods Adults (>17 years) admitted to the ICU, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Australia following injury were prospectively followed. Data were collected on demographics, pre-injury health, injury characteristics and acute care factors. Psychosocial measures (selfeffi cacy (SE), illness perception (IP), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and psychological distress) and health status (SF-36) were collected via questionnaire 1, 6, 12, and 24 months post injury. Outcomes of interest were the Physical Function (PF) and Mental Health (MH) subscales of the SF-36. Regression models were used to estimate predictors of physical function and mental health over a 2-year period. A subject-specifi c intercept in a mixed model was used to account for repeated data from participants over time. Results Participants (n = 123) were young (median 37, IQR 22 to 55 years), predominantly male (83%) and spent on average 3 days in the ICU and 3 weeks in hospital. Response rates were over 55% at each follow-up, with responders similar to nonresponders except for being generally older. PF and MH scores improved over time, although the averages remained below the Australian norms at 24 months. Predictors of PF included IP (β = -1.5, 95% CI = -3.1 to -1.1, P <0.01), SE (β = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.3 to 2.6, P <0.01), hospital length of stay (β = -1.7, 95% CI = -2.0 to -0.8, P <0.01), never having been married (β = 1.8, 95% CI = 0.3 to 5.5, P = 0.03), and having injury insurance (β = -2.7, 95% CI = -6.9 to -1.9, P <0.01). Predictors of MH included PTSD symptoms (β = -2.4, 95% CI -3.4 to -1.4, P <0.01), psychological distress (β = -6.9, 95% CI = -8.9 to -5.2, P <0.01), SE (β = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.2 to 1.1, P <0.01), and unemployment (β = -2.3, 95% CI = -5.0 to -0.2, P = 0.04). Conclusion Trauma ICU patients experience compromised physical function and mental health 24 months after injury. Psychological distress, self-effi cacy and illness perception infl uence outcomes and are potentially amenable to change in response to interventions initiated during hospital stay. Introduction Swiss Diagnosis Related Groups (SwissDRG) have been eff ective since 1 January 2012. The infl uence of this new system on patients' discharge characteristics from a large ICU is not known. With the introduction of the DRG we expect patients to be discharged after a shorter length of stay on the ICU and with higher severity of illness. The supply of hospital beds varied from 72.4/100,000 population in Kumasi to 245.8/100,000 in Boston. ICU beds with capacity for invasive mechanical ventilation and intensive nursing services ranged from 0.4/100,000 in Kumasi to 19/100,000 population in Boston. The number of ambulances varied 70-fold between cities. The gap between cities widened when demand was estimated based on disease burden, with a 70-fold diff erence between cities in ICU beds/acute deaths. In general, most of the data were unavailable from municipal authorities. Conclusion The provision of acute care services, a key aspect of urban infrastructure, varied substantially across the seven diverse urban settings we studied. Furthermore, the local municipal authorities generally appeared to have little knowledge of their acute care infrastructure, with implications for future planning and development. Resources may not always be allocated by severity of illness, but by custom or habit, particularly if diff erent groups administer bed control and triage. Specialty-specifi c diff erences may exist even when a single team controls triage. Variability in resource utilization has important implications for cost-containment and triage. Methods Patients admitted to a single, closed medical/surgical ICU with full-time intensivists and unifi ed triage control in a large, university-affi liated hospital were evaluated during 2011 to 2012. Patients who died in the ICU were excluded. The day of discharge (D/C) and severity using APACHE IV and its related Acute Physiology Score (APS) component were calculated daily for the fi rst 7 days. Trend was assessed across days by Cuzick's test. Results A total of 719 surgical and 925 medical patients met inclusion criteria. In total, 20.2% of surgical and 21.3% of medical patients had an ICU LOS <1; P = 0.58. Admission severity was correlated with length of stay, P = 0.014 for both medical and surgical patients. Medical patients are sicker on admission and D/C from the ICU than surgical patients (P <0.05) (Figure 1 ). Conclusion ICU utilization diff ered by patient type even with unifi ed triage control within a single unit. Surgical patients were less severely ill on admission to and D/C from the ICU. A signifi cant percentage of medical and surgical patients are D/C within 1 day and may be more effi ciently served in a less resource-intensive environment. The reasons for the diff erences in ICU utilization for surgical versus medical patients require clarifi cation and may have implications for both resource utilization and cost. Introduction Interest in safety and clinical outcomes of inpatients has been growing in Japan, because the 100,000 Lives Campaign was introduced under the Japanese Patient Safety Act in 2008. In this act, an introduction of the Rapid Response System (RRS) was one of the mainstreams to inpatients' care. However, many Japanese healthcare providers cannot understand how to achieve the introduction of the RRS, because there are few who have knowledge of the system. Therefore, we developed a new introductory training course for the RRS. The educational eff ectiveness was analyzed through the surveillance questionnaires after the course. Methods The educational program includes a lecture series con cerning the outline and management methods, introduction of facilities that have already deployed, small group discussions, and teaching methods-of-training for the medical emergency team using a simulator. Evaluation was made in the fi ve-point scale by 82 participants (58 physicians, 16 nurses and eight other professions) throughout seven courses. The questionnaires are: A. understanding of RRS, B. knowledge acquisition about patient safety, C. expectation for decreasing the cardiopulmonary arrest by RRS, and D. expectation for decreasing the psychological burden by RRS. Results Seventy-three participants (89.0%) answered the questionnaires. The numbers of participants who scored more than four points were as follows: A. was 71 (97.2%), B. was 70 (95.9%), C. was 64 (87.7%), and D. was 68 (93.2%), respectively. The majority of participants obtained the correct knowledge, and had a solid understanding for the RRS. It was evident that providing abundant material and didactic lectures traced from the introduction to management, and collecting and resolving the questions, promoted comprehension. However, there is a limitation of whether or not the participants introduce the RRS into their own institutions. It is essential to improve the course and continue to support the activities of the participants. Conclusion Our training course may promote the introduction and dissemination of the RRS in Japan. Of 225 questionnaires distributed, the response rate was 66% (31% doctors, 56% nurses and 13% AHP). Staff with either less than 1 year experience or greater than 10 years experience had the greatest exposure to the Mental Capacity Act and Data Protection Act, suggesting a gap in knowledge in staff with intermediate experience. Knowledge of the Caldicott principles were unaff ected by experience, with many experienced respondents having 'No Idea' . The majority of respondents (unaff ected by experience) felt that when giving information to relatives face to face, relatives should be kept fully informed. When giving information over the telephone, most doctors felt the response should be tailored to the knowledge of the person being spoken to whilst nurses were split between tailoring the response, giving full information, setting up a password system and not giving any information at all. Most respondents felt date of birth and hospital number constituted 'Patient Identifi able Information' . However, experienced staff did not appreciate the importance of unusual diagnosis and clinical photographs as also being able to identify patients. Similarly, the majority knew that the patient themselves identifi ed the 'Next of Kin' but 7% (unaff ected by experience) felt this was decided by the family and felt the family could decide on resuscitation status. When consent is required for an elective procedure in a patient who lacks capacity, doctors tended to have a better understanding of the need to delay the procedure where possible than nurses, the majority of which felt this could be decided by the next of kin or two consultant doctors. Most doctors felt that 'Acting in the Patient's Best Interests' would mean doing what would give the patient the best outcome rather than doing what the patient would have wanted (unaff ected by experience). The majority of staff , on answering this questionnaire, felt that they lacked suffi cient knowledge on the subject and most felt annual reminders would be useful. Since November 2011, 153 cases of severe sepsis have been audited and reported back to clinicians. Compliance with antibiotics in <1 hour has risen from 35 to 75% and compliance with the pre-ICU elements of the resuscitation bundle has risen from 20 to 70% ( Figure 2 ). Feedback from clinicians has been encouraging as our reports highlight both positive and negative examples of practice. Conclusion Individualised feedback on sepsis care has led to substantial improvements in guideline compliance. This concept could be translated to other time-dependent patient pathways. Introduction When we talk about safety culture, we speak of being aware that things can go wrong. We must be able to recognize mistakes and learn from them, sharing that information fairly and impartially to try to prevent its recurrence. Organizations such as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) have developed tools to help organizations measure their safety culture and there is little information about our country. Methods A descriptive survey study. We sent the Spanish version of the questionnaire on patient safety culture (AHRQ) to the nursing staff of a polyvalent ICU of 42 beds in a tertiary hospital. The questionnaire was sent to 179 nurses, receiving correctly answered 88 surveys (response rate of 49.16%). On a scale of 0 to 10, 6.97 points was obtained to estimate the safety climate for staff respondents. The item best scored was teamwork in the unit (65.9%). Detected as a fortress, 'communication between nurses at shift changes' (76.1% positive responses). The worst rating was obtained in the section on human resources, followed by management support in the fi eld of patient safety. Conclusion The perception of safety culture in an ICU by nursing staff is far from optimal levels. The team work dimension was identifi ed as the most valued by workers, with the transmission of information on shift changes the most valued item. Methods To compare our number of admissions, related activity and case-mix indicators 1 year before and after the geographical change was done. We analyzed our whole number of patients admitted to the ICU. We used the chi-square test for categorical variables and one-way analysis of variance for quantitative data. Minitab and Statbas statistical programs were used. We plotted activity data using the Barber-Johnson 1 diagram. Results A total of 2,774 cases (63% males; mean age 61 years) were admitted to our ICU during the period (1 year before and after the transfer). No diff erences between both groups were founded in demographic data, Knaus score and NYHA status. Regarding their origin, we found more patients admitted from other hospital centers (20 vs. 29%; P <0.001). APACHE II score increased from 17.24 to 19.08% (P <0.001) and a slight increase change in SAPS 3 score was also found (52.29 to 53.75; P <0.01  The incidence of pressure ulcers in the 4 months since the initiative began has averaged 2.25 per month compared with 7.8 per month prior to commencement of intentional rounding. Added to the rounding tool at the end of September 2012, RRT rates in the preceding 4 months averaged 31.5 ml/kg/hour over 24 hours, an 11.9% reduction from the previous average of 35.75 ml/kg/hour. If the pattern of RRT was to continue, this could equate to a cost saving of UK£40,000 per annum. Conclusion The use of a modifi ed targeted intentional rounding tool by the nursing shift leader can help ensure that best practice guidelines are adhered to. This strategy can improve patient outcomes and provide potentially signifi cant fi scal benefi ts. References Introduction Handovers are often associated with poor communi cation. ICU patients with multiple complex problems are ideal to study naturally occurring handovers. However, few studies have been conducted in the ICU. Methods We conducted questionnaires of physicians and nurses involved and observed handovers in real time of medical ICU patients over 1 month. We interviewed 580 of 672 physicians and nurses involved (86.3%) and observed 90 real-time handovers (45 patients, 26.8%) of 168 patients. Mean duration of handover was 391.3 (± 263.6) seconds, 78.5% were face to face and 1.26 (± 1.75) distractions per handover were noted, person-to-person calling being the commonest mode of distraction (46.7%). Nurses received training during induction in signifi cantly higher numbers, covered allied specialties more and reviewed the patients early (all P <0.05). Perception of the relative importance of diff erent components of the handover varied signifi cantly between donors, recipients, physicians and nurses. Both physicians and nurses seldom (39.7%) reviewed the available electronic past medical records of the patient before handover, which in addition to training in handover and overall confi dence level in the management following handover are signifi cantly associated with better satisfaction in univariate analysis; only the confi dence level in patient management remained signifi cant after multivariate analysis. However, agreement between donor and recipient on overall satisfaction was poor (P >0.05). Nursing handovers were signifi cantly longer than physicians' (572.08 ± 214.68 vs. 168.6 ± 97.27 seconds, P <0.001) but are also associated with higher distractions particularly during evening shifts. Conclusion A higher percentage of nurses received handover training; nursing handovers are longer and more inclusive of other components of patient management; perceived importance of components of handover varies among healthcare professionals; distractions are common during handovers and associated with longer duration, by nurses and in the evening shifts; and higher confi dence level in patient's management following the handover is associated with better satisfaction. using telemedicine to provide acute burn and critical care consultation on pediatric and adult burn patients in Lviv, Ukraine, as well as in triage and transport of critically ill patients from Lviv to a tertiary-care facility in the USA for further management. Methods Using a new telemedicine learning center established at City Hospital #8 in Lviv, Ukraine, consultations regarding acutely injured burn victims occurred between physicians in Ukraine and physicians at Shriners Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. After the initial presentation, each patient was reviewed on a daily basis by physicians in Boston. Skype, an Internet-based communication tool, was used in communication with the Burn Center in Lviv. Radiographic images were scanned and digitalized using an electronic scanner, and JPEG image compression was used to facilitate the transmission of radiographic images and patient charts. Informed consent and HIPPA guidelines were followed in transmitting any patient-related information. Results Since 2011 we have provided consultation on 14 patients in Lviv, Ukraine, ranging in age from 15 months to 63 years. Each patient had an average of six consultations. We present two of these cases as examples of the capabilities of our telemedicine program. The fi rst case involved a 15-month-old female with 40% TBSA from scald injury, where telemedicine was instrumental in the primary assessment as well as to arrange a direct assessment from a nearby burn surgeon. The second case resulted from a house fi re with multiple casualties, where physicians in Boston were able to utilize telemedicine to guide the initial resuscitation and airway management of three critically burned children, as well as to arrange for transport of one of the victims, an 11-year-old male with 87% TBSA, from Ukraine to the USA for acute management. Multiple diffi culties were overcome in implementing the system between the two countries including: time zone diff erences, language barrier, and diff erent approaches to patient care. Conclusion We have established a telemedicine program linking physicians in Boston, MA, USA with City Hospital #8 in Lviv, Ukraine to improve care in pediatric and adult burn patients. Our program has provided consultation on 14 patients since 2011, and it highlights the capabilities of telemedicine for acute consultation as well as triage and transport of critically ill patients to tertiary-care facilities. Introduction During the last few years the frequency of end-oflife decisions (EOLD) signifi cantly increased in ICUs. The method of nurse involvement in making EOLD is diff erent worldwide [1, 2] . The purpose of this study was to analyze opinions of nurses about therapy restriction. We have examined with a multicenter study the opinions of the medical stuff about end-of-life care in Hungarian ICUs. Methods We performed a questionnaire evaluation among physicians and nurses of ICUs about infl uencing factors of therapy restriction, the method of the decision-making process, and the frequency of diff erent EOLD. The questionnaire, containing 21 questions, was delivered electronically to Hungarian ICUs, and then we analyzed the responses anonymously. The retrieved 302 answers (191 physicians, 102 nurses) were analysed using a nonparametric Student's test. Results A total 71% of the nurse responders work in university clinics, 2% in regional centrum, 24% in municipal hospital, 3% in other ICUs. The nurses found both human (2.72/5 vs. 1.98/5) and material (2.81/5 vs. 2.12/5) resources more restrictive factors during patient admission than physicians (P = 0.025, P = 0.0024). Nurses working in municipal hospital were more strongly infl uenced by lack of material and human resources (3.34/5, 3.3/5) than nurses working in university clinics (2.2/5, 2.43/5), P = 0.01, P = 0.025. Younger nurses (working between 6 and 10 years) were more interested in the patient's or surrogate's wishes than older nurses (working more than 10 years). Religion did not infl uence patient admission and forego therapy; however, religious nurses compared with atheists and nonpracticing believers preferred to prolong therapy against the patient's will (P = 0.04). Nurses felt that physicians slightly involved them in the end-of-life decision-making process (2.1/5 vs. 2.4/5 P = 0.0001). Conclusion We found that the workplace, level of medical attendance, godliness, work experience, and position in medical staff strongly infl uenced making EOLD. While limitation of the therapy should be team work, nurses felt their opinions were hardly taken into consideration, although nurses seemed to be more realistic in the decision-making process. Introduction More than one in fi ve people admitted to an ICU will die there. Research has highlighted concerns about support for patients and families and decision-making in this context [1, 2] . Here, we describe the development and evaluation of a tool to improve palliative care in a 32-bed general ICU in a central London teaching hospital. Methods Medical Research Council guidance for complex interventions Phase 0 to I comprised literature review, theoretical modelling, observation and qualitative interviews and focus groups with staff and families exploring concerns and views of interventions identifi ed in the literature review. Phase II comprised intervention development, implementation and evaluation of tool feasibility and eff ects using staff survey, observation, audit of records and relative survey. Results Phase I: 47 staff and 24 family members were interviewed. The short time between decisions for treatment withdrawal and death, plus concerns for support management, communication and decision-making, highlighted a need to ensure excellent psychosocial assessment for all. Phase II: as part of integrated care guidelines, we developed the King's Psychosocial Assessment and Care tool (K-PACE). K-PACE is used for all patients entering the ICU, completed within 24 hours of admission. It contains psychosocial assessment of the family and patient needs, and identifi es key individuals for contact. Educational training was supported by K-PACE and was implemented in two waves. Post-implementation survey of 95 ICU staff found that most (80%) were aware of K-PACE. Eighty-two per cent of nurses but only 17% of doctors had completed the tool. In total, 158/213 (74%) family members responded to the survey (additionally three patients responded). There were high levels of satisfaction for symptom control and psychosocial care but concerns continued regarding explanation of treatment and care. Conclusion K-PACE is a feasible tool to improve the palliative care of patients and their families in the ICU. Further refi nement is needed and planned, with consideration of roll-out into the wider medical centre. be concerned involving the family's will. Especially, stopping or withdrawing therapy is a quite diffi cult operation in Japan because of legal issues. Our hypothesis is that some diff erence exists in thoughts between physicians and nurses for terminal patients in the ICU. The aim of this study is to know their real thoughts. Methods A questionnaire survey was performed on physicians and nurses in our medico-surgical ICU. The questionnaire consists of 11 questions with fi ve optional answers related to the thoughts of participants about treatment of hopeless or brain death patients. Concretely, the questions were; whether to withhold therapy or not, whether to accept to withdraw therapy or not and with family's will, whether to accept to immediately stop therapy and with family's will, whether to positively or not donate organs from a brain death patient, necessity of ICU care for brain death patients, and feeling guilty and stress for stopping or withdrawing therapy. The optional answer has fi ve gradations from 'Yes' to 'No' for all questions. The participants were asked to answer the questionnaire by expressing themselves without regarding legal issues or the consensus. It was guaranteed to be anonymous for them in the data analysis. The answers were compared between physicians and nurses. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. P <0.05 was considered statistically signifi cant. Results There were in total 52 participants (response rate 98.1%) with 20 physicians and 32 nurses. Withdrawing therapy was signifi cantly accepted in nurses than in physicians (83% vs. 55%, P = 0.039), when the family well understood. Withholding therapy should not be operated for brain death patients for physicians (65%), while it seemed a diffi cult judgement for nurses (23%, P = 0.021). ICU care for brain death patients is less necessary for physicians than nurses (80% vs. 53%, P = 0.016). There were no signifi cant diff erences in other questions between physician and nurses such as feeling guilty or stress for stopping or withdrawing therapy. Conclusion Some of end-of-life thoughts in the ICU showed diff erences between physicians and nurses. Introduction Optimal patient evaluations of ICU rehabilitation therapy remain unclear. Methods One hundred ICU patients with acute respiratory failure were randomized to receive early rehabilitation (ER) or usual-care (UC). Cohort 1 (n = 50) received ER as one physical therapy (PT) session/day versus UC; Cohort 2 (n = 50) received ER as 2 PT/day with the second session resistance training, versus UC. UC was without ER. Blood was drawn for cytokines through day 7. Cohort 2 underwent strength and physical functional assessments using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), a valid and reliable measure of physical function consisting of walking speed, balance, and repeated chair stands. It is a well-studied composite measure in older persons, but has not been used in ICU survivors. Small changes of 0.5 to 0.6 points in the SPPB have been shown to be clinically meaningful. Conclusion In this pilot study, early ICU rehabilitation was safe, and was associated with numerically although not statistically shorter hospital stay, greater strength and improved functional scores. Particularly, the SPPB demonstrated discriminatory ability in groups of ICU survivors with low physical function. Future early ICU rehabilitation studies should consider ICU survivor assessments using the SPPB due to its ease, reproducibility and discriminatory ability following ICU and hospital discharge. of the demographic variables such as sex, age, education, race and length of stay had an eff ect on perceived quality of care. Conclusion The CQI 'R-ICU' turned out to be a valid, reliable, sensitive and feasible instrument. Large-scale implementation is recommended.
