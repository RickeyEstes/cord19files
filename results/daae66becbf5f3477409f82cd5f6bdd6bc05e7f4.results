Evaluating the interferon response in AK-D and IFNαR2-deficient AK-D 2.2 cells. We first targeted the type I interferon receptor (IFNαR) in an immortalized cell line derived from feline lung tissue (AK-D) using Crispr/Cas gene editing. AK-D cells were chosen because they are permissive to the serotype I FIPV Black strain used here and have a defined genotype. To disrupt the IFNαR2, wild-type AK-D cells were transduced with lentiviruses carrying a pLentiCRISPRv2 on which a single-guide (sg) RNA, targeting exon 2 of feline ifnαr2 (2.2), was encoded. Positive selection was performed using puromycin and surviving cells were cultivated as a polyclonal population termed AK-D 2.2. As there is no available IFNαR-specific antibody to detect the presence of feline IFNαR2 protein, we used a functional assay to evaluate the AK-D 2.2 cells for an IFN signaling-deficient phenotype. Increasing concentrations of purified feline IFNα were exogenously applied to AK-D or AK-D 2.2 cells and levels of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) 54 transcript were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR). ISG54 expression is prominently upregulated following activation of the type I IFN receptor (Fensterl and Sen, 2011) and is used here to report on the functionality of the IFNαR. As expected, parental AK-D cells responded to exogenous IFNα with a dose-dependent increase in ISG54 expression. The AK-D 2.2 cell population, however, produced significantly fewer ISG54 transcripts than the parental AK-D cells (Fig. 1A) , indicating a disruption of the type I IFN response pathway. The subtle, yet concentration-dependent ISG54 transcription observed from AK-D 2.2 cells may be attributed to the polyclonal nature of the AK-D 2.2 cell population, which were selected for positive transduction, but not necessarily loss of IFN signaling. Nonetheless, these results indicate that the AK-D 2.2 cells have a diminished total response to IFNα, likely due to disruption of the IFNαR2. Evaluating growth kinetics of serotype I FIPV Black in AK-D 2.2 cells. To determine if disrupting the IFNαR2 had an effect on replication of FIPV Black we evaluated the viral growth kinetics in AK-D and AK-D 2.2 cells. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay of cellfree supernatants derived from cells infected with FIPV Black at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. FIPV Black achieved a maximum titer > 10 6 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL in both cell types. The kinetics of FIPV Black were similar in AK-D and AK-D 2.2 cells (Fig. 1B) , with both cell types producing peak titers at 42 h post-infection (HPI), suggesting that the IFNαR2 does not significantly impact virus growth in this cell type. This was expected as FCoVs encode multiple IFN antagonists, which permit replication in AK-D cells independent of an IFN response (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2014 (Dedeurwaerder et al., , 2013 . Determining the utility of the AK-D 2.2 cells in visualizing FIPV Black plaques. Next, we asked if AK-D 2.2 cells can be used as an indicator cell type to accurately determine FIPV Black titer by plaque assay, a point of critical importance in future studies characterizing HIS mutant FIPV strains. An ideal indicator cell type allows a virus to form well-defined and easily enumerable plaques; therefore, we sought to determine if virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) or plaque size are affected by the absence of IFNαR2 in AK-D 2.2 cells. To evaluate CPE progression, AK-D and AK-D 2.2 cells were infected with 0.1 MOI FIPV Black. Over 48 h, we observed increased CPE in AK-D 2.2 cells compared to parental AK-D cells (data not shown), suggesting an increase in virus spread. To evaluate plaque formation, plaque assays were performed using a known concentration of FIPV Black, which was serially diluted and applied to AK-D and AK-D 2.2 indicator cells. FIPV Black formed large and enumerable plaques in AK-D 2.2 cells, which allowed for more accurate determination of virus titer compared to the parental AK-D cells (Fig. 1C) . In AK-D 2.2 cells, plaques were more easily identified at 72 hpi, and plaque sizes were comparable to those on Fcwf-4 CU cells at 48 hpi as we recently reported (O'Brien et al., 2018) . It was difficult to accurately determine virus titer using wildtype AK-D cells, as the plaques were too small to count accurately at both time points and led to an underestimation of PFU/mL. Our results highlight the utility of the AK-D 2.2 cells in determining the titer of serotype I FIPV and indicate that this cell line will be critical in future studies investigating IFN antagonist-mutant strains of FIPV. Disrupting IFN signaling in Fcwf-4 CU cells and evaluating the IFN-responsiveness and FIPV Black replication kinetics in an isolated clone. In addition to disrupting IFN signaling in AK-D cells, we also targeted the IFNαR2 in the feline macrophage-like cell line, Fcwf-4 CU. These cells are a more physiologically relevant cell type in which to study FIPV and grow the Black strain to high, cell-free titers (O'Brien et al., 2018) . To knock down the IFNαR2, parental Fcwf-4 CU cells were transduced with lentiviruses carrying pLentiCRISPRv2 encoding an sgRNA targeting the second exon of the feline ifnαr2 gene (2.2), the same sequence targeted in AK-D cells. Positive transductants were selected using puromycin and cells were cultivated as a polyclonal population termed Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly. To evaluate the type I IFN-responsiveness of the Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly cells, cultures were treated with 1000 U of feline type I IFN for 6 h and evaluated for expression of ISG54. Compared to the parental Fcwf-4 CU cells, the Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly cells had reduced ISG54 transcript production suggesting positive disruption of the ifnar2 gene ( Fig. 2A) . Next, in order to obtain a single, geneticallydefined cell line, the Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly cells were sorted into a 96-well plate at one cell per well, and grown for 30 days. Three isolated clones (CL1-3) were evaluated for IFN-responsiveness by first stimulating with 1000 U of IFN then measuring levels of ISG54 transcript by qPCR ( Fig. 2A) . Fcwf-4 2.2 Poly clone 3, which exhibited the most subtle ISG54 response, were termed "IRN" for IFNα Receptor Null and maintained for further analysis. FIPV Black replication kinetics were similar in the parental Fcwf-4 CU and Fcwf-4 IRN clonal cell line as determined by plaque assay measuring infectious particles (Fig. 2B ) and by qPCR measuring production of nucleocapsid (N) gene transcript (Fig. 2C ). To further evaluate IFN responsiveness, Fcwf-4 CU and IRN cells were treated with 1000 U of type I IFN for 8 h prior to infection with FIPV Black (MOI = 0.01). As expected, virus replication was significantly reduced in parental CU cells pre-treated with IFNα (Fig. 2D ). In contrast, pre-treatment of IRN cells with IFNα did not negatively impact virus replication ( Fig. 2D ) thereby providing further support of the IFNαR-null phenotype in this cell line. Lastly, we evaluated plaque size differences formed during FIPV Black replication in CU and IRN cells. Similar to what we observed with AK-D 2.2 cells, FIPV Black formed significantly larger plaques at days 3-4 post-infection in the IFNαR-null IRN cells compared to parental CU cells ( Fig. 2E and F). Together, these results describe the successful generation and isolation of an IFNα response-deficient Fcwf-4 CU cell line, which will be highly useful in the recovery and study of IFN-antagonist mutant FCoVs in future studies. Determining how IFN signaling is disrupted in Fcwf-4 IRN cells. Crispr/Cas gene editing targets and cleaves a specified nucleotide sequence leading to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair. This naturally imperfect double-strand break reconstruction process commonly introduces in/del mutations, which can disrupt gene transcription, reduce protein function or cause early termination of protein translation. We reasoned that the most direct method to determine how the IFNαR2 gene may be disrupted was to compare the ifnar2 mRNA sequences produced in Fcwf-4 CU and IRN cells. Indeed, we found that the ifnar2 mRNA obtained from Fcwf-4 IRN cells contained a 14-nucleotide deletion at the intended Cas9 cleavage site (Fig. 3A) . The frameshift arising from this deletion positioned a stop codon in-frame, resulting in early termination at residue 27 and, likely, a shortened IFNαR2 protein (Fig. 3A) . Further, we asked if ifnar2 transcription was affected by this mutation. We found that mRNA expression from ifnar2 exon 1-4, the region targeted by our sgRNA sequence, was actually higher in IRN cells compared to parental cells (Fig. 3B ) indicating that disruption did not negatively impact transcription. Finally, we determined that the melting temperatures of the parental and IRN ifnar2 exon 1-4 mRNA amplicons produced during qPCR differed, on average,
