Isolation of CHO-K1 clones resistant to GP-mediated entry A replication competent VSV encoding ebolavirus Zaire (ZEBOV) GP and mCherry in place of VSV G was constructed. Cellular entry of this recombinant virus, VSV EboGP mCherry, is mediated by the ebolaviral glycoprotein, similar to a previously described vaccine virus, VSVDG/ZEBOV GP (Feldmann et al., 2007; Garbutt et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2005) . The ebolavirus GP requirement for entry was confirmed through loss of infection in the presence of lysosomotropic reagents and CatB-and CatLspecific inhibitors (data not shown). Infection of susceptible cells with this recombinant virus results in efficient killing and is the basis for the selection strategy employed below. The functionally haploid cell line CHO-K1 was used to identify cells resistant to infection with VSV EboGP mCherry using the strategy outlined in Fig. 1a . Infection of unmutagenized CHO cells with VSV EboGP mCherry at an MOI of 8 produced numerous colonies. In contrast, infection with VSV-GFP, a VSV vector expressing its own glycoprotein and a GFP marker, did not produce any viable colonies. This observation suggests that there is a high level of natural resistance to ebolaviral entry in CHO cells. After expansion, colonies were pooled and cloned by limiting dilution. Clonal cell lines were tested for susceptibility to VSV EboGP mCherry and VSV GFP. Four clonal cell lines (R1, R2, R4, and L2) that displayed complete resistance to VSV EboGP mCherry, while maintaining susceptibility to VSV GFP, were chosen for further characterization. These four cell lines were derived from resistant colonies isolated from separate plates challenged with VSV EboGP mCherry. The R2 and L2 cell lines display a similar morphology to wildtype (WT) CHO-K1 cells while R1 cells are much larger than WT cells with a more fibroblast-like appearance, and the R4 cells are larger and rounder than the CHO-K1 parent. The susceptibility profiles for clones R1, R2, R4, and L2 were confirmed by examining expression of mCherry or GFP via light microscopy at varying time points post-infection (PI) with VSV EboGP mCherry or VSV GFP, respectively (data not shown). Beginning 6-8 h PI, GFP is visible for R1, R2, R4, L2, and WT CHO-K1 cells infected with VSV GFP. By 24 h PI all cells are infected and most show a cytopathic effect from VSV replication. Infection of WT CHO-K1 cells with VSV EboGP mCherry produces a similar pattern. In contrast, for the R1, R2, R4, and L2 cell lines neither expression of the mCherry marker nor the cytopathic effects of VSV replication is seen with either high or low MOIs of VSV EboGP mCherry at any time point up to 48 h post-infection. Given the rapid kinetics of VSV replication in these cells, even low levels of infection would be apparent by 48 h. A more quantitative analysis using flow cytometry demonstrates that all four cell lines are effectively infected with VSV GFP (Fig. 1b) . On the contrary, while an average of 33% of WT CHO-K1 cells express mCherry 12 h after challenge with VSV EboGP mCherry, less than 0.2% of R1, R2, R4, and L2 cells express mCherry (Fig. 1b) . This data indicates that the R1, R2, R4, and L2 cells are resistant to infection mediated by Zaire ebolavirus GP, but not VSV G. CHO-K1 clones are resistant to transduction with HIV pseudotypes bearing ZEBOV GP, but not VSV G To ensure that the resistance of these clones was specific for GP-mediated entry, we examined whether the clones were susceptible to transduction with HIV pseudotypes encoding GFP and bearing VSV G (HIV/VSV G) or Zaire ebolavirus GP (HIV/ ZEBOV GP). Cells were fixed 48 h PI and analyzed by flow cytometry for GFP expression. All four resistant clones had similar levels of transduction with HIV/VSV G as WT CHO-K1 cells, as determined by the percent of cells expressing GFP (Fig. 2a) . In contrast, while on average approximately 26% of WT CHO-K1 cells expressed GFP following transduction with HIV/ZEBOV GP, less than 2% of the resistant cells were transduced. This represents less than ten percent of the level of transduction of WT CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 2a) . A similar result was seen when the resistant cells were challenged with HIV pseudotypes bearing Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV) GP, Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus (CIEBOV) GP, or Reston ebolavirus (REBOV) GP (Fig. 2b) . There was no statistically significant difference in the level of infection for each cell line when comparing across filoviral glycoproteins. Taken together, these data indicate that the resistance to infection observed for R1, R2, R4, and L2 cells is specific for filoviral GP-mediated entry. Ebolavirus GP is normally processed by endosomal cathepsins during entry into the host cell. This cleavage is believed necessary to activate the fusogenic potential of GP. To test whether the resistance to infection in the isolated CHO cell lines was due to a defect upstream of the ebolavirus GP proteolysis step, we challenged the resistant cells with an HIV pseudotype bearing a mutant form of GP that mimics processed GP (GP 0 , Fig. 2a ). This mutant form, GP 0 , contains a furin recognition sequence, RRKR, at amino acids 203-206 (Fig. S1a ). In the presence of furin, GP 0 is cleaved at amino acid 207, producing a GP1 fragment that is six amino acids longer than the CatL processed species (Hood et al., 2010) . Cells were transduced with HIV/ZEBOV GP 0 pseudotypes encoding GFP and analyzed by flow cytometry. Although GP 0 incorporates into HIV virions at a ratio of approximately 0.5:1 compared to WT GP, pseudotypes bearing GP 0 are more infectious (see Fig. 2a , WT cells). The increased susceptibility of WT CHO-K1 cells to HIV/ZEBOV GP 0 (average of 45% of cells infected compared to 26% with WT GP) was not seen in the resistant cell lines. The lack of an increase in susceptibility for the resistant cell lines indicates that the resistance to infection seen in these cell lines could not be overcome by prior cleavage of ebolavirus GP (Fig. 2a) .
