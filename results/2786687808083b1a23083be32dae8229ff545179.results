Mesenchymal stem cells enhance short-and long-term recovery from experimental acid aspiration acute lung injury In 24 h, i.p. administration of WT-MSCs 1 h after induction of acid aspiration acute lung injury significantly improved arterial oxygenation and decreased the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient in WT-mice in comparison to PBS (p < 0.05 and p = 0.001, respectively) ( Fig. 2a and b) , without modification of PaCO 2 and even in presence of slightly worse pH values (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Early improvement in oxygenation yielded by WT-MSCs was likely obtained by reduction of lung edema: in fact, the lungs' wetto-dry ratio in 24 h was decreased by WT-MSCs in comparison to PBS (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2e) . Similarly, micro-CT scan analysis showed that the extent of lung collapse significantly decreased between 1 and 24 h in WT mice treated by WT-MSCs (p = 0.01), likely indicating decreased superimposed weight from reduced lung edema (Table 1 and Fig. 3 ), but not in those treated by PBS. Histology performed in 24 h showed decreased disruption of lung structures in mice treated by WT-MSCs in comparison to PBS (Table 1) , even though this difference did not reach statistical significance. BAL total protein concentrations were left unchanged by WT-MSCs treatment (Fig. 2f) . Mice treated by WT-MSCs, indeed, showed significant reduction of total cell count in BAL fluid in 24 h and substantial dampening of neutrophil recruitment into the alveoli (p < 0.05 for both; Fig. 2c , d) in comparison to PBS. Accordingly, levels of proinflammatory cytokines (i.e., CXCL1 and TNF-Î±) in BAL fluid were significantly reduced by WT-MSCs (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively), but not by PBS (Table 1) . Interestingly, circulating PTX3 was reduced in WT-mice treated by WT-MSCs (albeit non-significantly) and not in WT-mice treated by PTX3-deficient MSCs (Table 1) . In this study, we showed that treatment by i.p. WT-MSCs administered 1 h after acid aspiration attenuated the evolution of fibrosis, as demonstrated by lower collagen deposition (OH-Pro assay) in 2 weeks (Fig. 4a ) in comparison to mice treated by PBS. In 1 week, D-dimer concentration was significantly increased in the lungs of mice treated with WT-MSCs (p < 0.001, Fig. 4b ) in comparison to PBS, suggesting that dampening of long-term fibrotic evolution might have followed both reduced inflammation and enhanced fibrinolysis by WT-MSCs in the days after injury.
