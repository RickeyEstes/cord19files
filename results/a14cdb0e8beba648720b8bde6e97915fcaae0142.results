Certain subgroups of patients within the dataset produced substantially different R estimates (Table 2) . For patients who traveled to 1 of the 12 countries during their incubation or symptomatic period, we calculated R = 2.9 transmissions per patient; for patients deliberately evacuated from West Africa for treatment, R = 0.05; for patients who acquired infection in the new country after an introduction, R = 0.3. Estimates of k produced wide CIs within subgroups, from values <1, which are consistent with a highly dispersed distribution, to large values, which are consistent with a Poisson distribution. Assuming R 0 = 3, estimated on the basis of travelerimported cases, and R c = 0.3, estimated on the basis of locally acquired cases, the chance of an outbreak with >10 transmissions after a single introduction ranges from ≈7%-13% across the 3 assumed values for k: 0.1, 1, and 10 ( Figure 1, panel A) . The chance of an outbreak with >100 transmissions is negligible (<0.01%) for k = 10 and k = 1 but rises to ≈0.4% under a high variability assumption of k = 0.1 because of increased likelihood of superspreading. We considered the effect of 2 ways to reduce the risk from those results: decreasing R c to approach the level of control achieved among evacuated patients (30) and eliminating the initial high-average transmission step to reflect preidentification of the initial infected traveler. When R 0 = 3 but R c is decreased to 0.1 (Figure 1 , panel B), the chance of >10 transmissions is 1%-10%. The chance of >100 transmissions is <0.01% for k = 10 and k = 1 and 0.2% with high variability. Assuming that the initial patient is identified and that transmission is controlled (R = 0.3) (Figure 1, panel C) causes a much more substantial decrease in outbreak risk, to a range of 0.04%-1% for >10 transmissions and <0.01% for >100 transmissions, even with high variability. Assuming R = 0.1 for all patients causes >10 transmissions to be very unlikely, with a 0.01% chance even with high variability (Figure 1, panel D) . In addition, we compared the 4 scenarios and considered worst-case outbreaks at 2 probability levels: the outbreak level estimated by the model to be exceeded in 1% of introductions (Figure 2, panel A) and the outbreak level estimated by the model to be exceeded in 1 in 10,000 introductions ( Figure 2, panel B) . The effect of identifying the initial patient is stronger than the effect of reducing R c , but the combination produces a synergistic effect. For example, at moderate variability (k = 1), the 0.01% worst-case outbreak size when R 0 = 3 and R c = 0.3 (49 total transmissions) is reduced to 73% of that value (36 total transmissions) when R c is reduced to 0.1. The worstcase outbreak size is reduced to 31% (15 total transmissions) when the initial patient is identified. Reducing R c (i.e., postcontrol average number of transmissions per patient) and identifying the initial patient together decrease transmission size to 10% of the worst-case value (5 total transmissions), which is greater than the expected reduction (to 22%) if each intervention was conducted independently. The worst-case risk reduction is greatest under the assumption of high transmission variability (k = 0.1); the 0.01% worst-case outbreak size is reduced from 239 total transmissions to 4% or 10 total transmissions when both intervention assumptions are applied. We also explored the sensitivity of exceedance probabilities to additional values of R and k (online Technical Appendix Figure) and showed nuances of how higher variability can simultaneously increase the probability of the best-case scenario (no transmissions) and of worst-case scenarios (e.g., superspreading, which can lead to large outbreaks).

A) R 0 = 3 for initial case, assumed to be traveler during incubation or symptomatic period; and R c = 0.3 for subsequent cases, assumed to be locally acquired cases in countries other than Guinea, Sierra Leone, or Liberia. B) R 0 = 3 for initial case, assumed to be patients evacuated for treatment; and R c = 0.1 for subsequent cases. C) R = 0.3 for all cases. D) R = 0.1 for all cases.
