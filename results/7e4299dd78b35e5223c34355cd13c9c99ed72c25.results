A total of 183 megabats consisting of four different species were included in this study (Table 1) . Among these, Pteropus sp. and Dobsonia sp. were not identified at species level, but other genetically close species Pteropus hypomelanus and Dobsonia moluccensis, were included 21 . In an earlier study, BuV was detected from the spleen tissues and faeces of shrews 9 . Therefore, we used nested-PCR targeting for the NS1 gene of BuV using 183 spleens and 96 faeces samples (faecal samples were unavailable for a subset of megabats). As shown in Table 1 , BuV was identified in three spleen and nine faeces specimens from Pteropus vampyrus, and one spleen specimen from Pteropus sp. Among these, one Pteropus vampyrus in Magelang was positive for BuV in both the spleen and faeces. With a limited number of samples, the detection rate of BuV in spleen (2%) was lower than that in faeces (9%). Based on the nucleotide sequence identity, we tentatively grouped and named the identified BuVs into three strains: megabat bufavirus 1 (MgBuV1) originating from Pteropus vampyrus in Surabaya and Magelang (accession numbers LC085668 to LC085676), megabat bufavirus 2 (MgBuV2) from Pteropus vampyrus in Lima Puluh Kota (LC085665 and LC085666), and megabat bufavirus 3 (MgBuV3) from Pteropus sp. in Paguyaman (LC085667). The partial NS1 gene fragment of MgBuV1 showed 81-83% and 91-92% nucleotide identity to MgBuV2 and MgBuV3, respectively. The corresponding region of MgBuV2 was 80% identical to that of MgBuV3. Currently, DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases contain complete or partial nucleotide sequences of BuV from humans, nonhuman primates, shrews, rats, pigs and microbats. A phylogenetic tree was generated on the basis of the identified sequences of NS1 gene in this study and a corresponding region of the available reference sequences of protoparvoviruses including BuVs (Fig. 1) . Known BuVs formed subgroups by host were distinguishable from other protoparvoviruses (groups 1-6, Fig. 1 ). MgBuV1, MgBuV2 and MgBuV3 diverged from a common ancestor of known protoparvoviruses and were likely to form a distinct subgroup from other BuVs, including microbat-borne BuVs (group 7, Fig. 1 ). To reveal the whole genome sequence and genetically characterise further the identified BuVs, we subjected DNA samples isolated from spleens and faeces to next-generation sequencing. A small number of sequence reads from MgBuV1, but not MgBuV2 and MgBuV3, enabled to amplify the overlapping large fragments by PCR and determine nearly the whole genome sequence, including the complete protein-coding region. The obtained genome sequence of MgBuV1 (accession number LC085675) was 4765 nt in size and encoded three complete ORFs: the non-structural protein (NS1) and the viral capsid proteins (VP1 and VP2). These proteins showed 46-61% amino acid sequence identities to those of other BuVs of which complete genome sequences were available ( ( Fig. 2 ). NS1 contained a putative endonuclease metal coordination motif "HIH" and the helicase motif Walker A "GPASTGKS". The VP1 of most parvovirus species possesses a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) motif that is required for viral entry 22 . Three potential sites responsible for the enzymatic activity of PLA2 were strictly conserved in the VP1 of MgBuV1: a calcium-binding loop site "YLGPG" and two catalytic sites "HDLEY" and "D". The N-terminus of the VP1 and VP2 of MgBuV1 had a glycine-rich motif (G-rich) required for the cellular entry of parvovirus 23 . Recently, six partial genome sequences of human BuV-like parvovirus were identified from insectivorous microbats in Hungary and China 13, 14 . These sequences covered a partial coding region of NS1 and almost complete to complete coding regions of VP1 and VP2 (Fig. 2) . Therefore, using the coding region of VP2, we performed a phylogenetic analysis to infer the deeper phylogenetic relationships between these microbat-borne BuVs and megabat-borne MgBuV1 (Fig. 3 ). All microbat-borne BuVs formed a single cluster (group 5, Fig. 3 ). MgBuV1 branched from the common ancestor of human BuVs, non human primate-borne BuV (WUHARV parvovirus) and pig-borne BuV, and represented a distinct lineage of BuV (linage 4, Fig. 3 ). WUHARV parvovirus (linage 3, Fig. 3 ) fell into the cluster of human BuVs (group 2, Fig. 3 ), consistent with a previous study of past recombination events behind the origin of WUHARV parvovirus 13 . We searched for putative recombination events on the genome of MgBuV1 using two different approaches based on sliding window analyses, one using the Bootscan approach and the second using Bayesian inference (Fig. 4A,B) . Both analyses suggested a mosaic genome structure in MgBuV1 and possible recombinations among ancestors of MgBuV1, WUHARV parvovirus and porcine parvovirus Zsana, around nucleotide positions 778 to 2384 of the MgBuV1 genome (Fig. 4C) . These observations were supported by independent phylogenetic trees built from five regions bordered by the inferred recombination breakpoints (Fig. 5A-E) . Among the BuVs and related protoparvoviruses, MgBuV1 branched from the ancestor of porcine parvovirus Zsana in the phylogenetic tree at position 778 to 1219 (Fig. 5B) and position 1856 to 2384 (Fig. 5D) . However, MgBuV1 branched from its ancestor WUHARV parvovirus at position 1219 to 1856 in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5C ). In contrast, MgBuV1 formed a distinct lineage in phylogenetic trees constructed from position 2384 to 4765 (Fig. 5E ). Based on this evidence, we inferred the parsimonious origin of the mosaic genome in MgBuV1 from both recombination analyses (Fig. 4C) .
