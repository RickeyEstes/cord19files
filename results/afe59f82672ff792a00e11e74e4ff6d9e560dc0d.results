Descriptive epidemiological data of each PHC jurisdiction. During the 2010-2011 influenza season in Miyazaki Prefecture, the first case was reported in the Miyakonojo PHC; Weekly CPS in Miyakonojo was 0.3 at the 40 th week in 2010 (Fig. 1) . In all the PHC jurisdictions, one or more phases in which Weekly CPS shifted from a decrease to an increase were observed, and a secondary epidemic defined in the introduction section was confirmed without Takachiho. According to a national population census conducted in 2010, Table 1 shows the population of each jurisdiction and the estimated number of people who moved between jurisdictions. The outflow population was large in the order of Takanabe, Miyakonojo, and Miyazaki city, and inflow population was in the order of Miyazaki city, Miyakonojo, and Takanabe. The ratio of population influx and efflux to the night-time population was large in the order of Takanabe, Chuo, and Hyuga with respect to influx and Chuo, Takanabe, and Kobayashi with respect to efflux. The epidemic ended in the 40 th week of 2010, in which Weekly CPS was higher than 0 at least in one jurisdiction. Similarly, the epidemic started in the 27 th week of 2011, and Weekly CPS became 0 in all the jurisdictions. Before the start of the epidemic, Weekly CPS continued to be 0 for two consecutive weeks from the 39 th week in 2010, and also continued to be 0 for two consecutive weeks till the 26 th week in 2011 after the end of the epidemic. Therefore, we evaluated the predictability of the spline model according to the Akaike's information criterion (AIC), which had the highest applicability when the beginning and end of the epidemic were set at the 38 th week of 2010 and the 26 th week of 2011, respectively. Weekly R t and its 95% credible interval. The R t of each of the nine jurisdictions was estimated and plotted with Weekly CPS (Fig. 2) . The 95% credible intervals of R t were: Miyazaki city (1.9-2.0), Chuo (1.9-2.9), Miyakonojo (1.4-1.5), Nobeoka (1.4-1.6), Nichinan (1.6-1.8), Kobayashi (1.7-1.8), Takanabe (1.5-1.8), Takachiho (0.9-1.3), and Hyuga (1.1-1.2) when the pre-epidemic warning at each jurisdiction was issued, and Weekly CPS was higher than 10.0. Therefore, all the lower 95% credible interval limits were higher than 1.0, except that for Takachiho at the time of issual of the pre-epidemic warning. All the R t values were lower than 1.0 when Weekly CPS value was lower than the reference value for the end of the epidemic warning (i.e. 10.0). Furthermore, once Weekly CPS was lower than 10.0, it exceeded 10.0 again in all the jurisdictions except Takachiho. Particularly, in Miyazaki city, Chuo, and Nobeoka, the value reached 30.0 again which is the reference value for epidemic warnings. In the case of a secondary epidemic, all the lower 95% credible interval limits were also higher than 1.0 except in Takachiho.
