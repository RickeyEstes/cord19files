RVs were identified in 27 (33%) of the 81 specimens analyzed (Table I) . Twenty-five (93%) of the RV-positive children were 6 months of age or older (P = .003 versus children <6 months of age; Fig 2) . RV infections were most common in the 12-to-17-months age group, being present in 65% of the children at that age. Enterovirus infection was found in 10 children, with no significant Asthma, rhinitis, other respiratory diseases age dependence; coronavirus infection was found in none of the children. Of the 81 children, RSV infection had been diagnosed in 21, most (67%) of whom were less than 6 months of age (Fig 2) . Parainfluenza viruses had been identified in 11 children (type 3 in 9 cases) and adenoviruses in 4 children. In most (81%) of the 27 cases with RV identified there were no other viral findings. In 5 cases there were concomitant viral identifications: adenovirus in 3 children (1 had parainfluenza virus also), RSV in 1 child, and enterovirus in 1 child. Enterovirus infections were mixed in 5 cases (50%), 4 with RSV and 1 with RV. In all, 1 or more viruses were detected in 59 (73%) of the 81 children with adequate frozen NPA samples available. The 1992-1993 recruitment period occurred between 2 RSV infection epidemics: the peak incidence of RSV infections appeared at the beginning of 1992, representing an ongoing winter epidemic started at the end of 1991, and this was followed by a minor spring epidemic in 1993. In contrast, the peak incidence of RV infections occurred at the end of 1992, between the major and minor RSV epidemics. Among the baseline characteristics in the 82 children followed to school age, an earlier episode of wheezing (1 separate physician-diagnosed wheezing episode that had occurred before the index hospitalization; OR, 4.29; 95% CI, 1.02-17.99), atopic dermatitis (OR, 4.11; 95% CI, 1.42-11.84), a total serum IgE level of ≥60 kU/L (OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.03-11.33), and a blood eosinophil count of ≥0.45 × 10 9 /L (OR, 7.02; 95% CI, 2.26-21.79) were in age-and sex-adjusted analyses significantly predictive of asthma. In this selected group of wheezing children, RSV identification was negatively associated with later childhood asthma (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.06-0.93), again independently of age and sex. The same baseline characteristics were predictive of asthma in the 66 children with NPA samples available for RV and enterovirus studies (data not shown). Therefore, these characteristics are evaluated in further analyses on RVs and enteroviruses (Table II) . As seen in Table II , RV findings were significantly associated with the presence of atopic dermatitis in infancy, independently of age and sex. In contrast, no associations were found between RV infections and elevated total serum IgE, blood eosinophilia, or history of an earlier episode of wheezing. Enterovirus identifications had no dependence on age, sex, or any of the other aforementioned factors (Table II) . Of the 66 children with frozen NPAs and follow-up data available, RVs were identified in 25 (38%) and enteroviruses in 9 (14%). Asthma was considered to be present in 27 (41%) of the 66 children at early school age (Table III) . Asthma was present in 15 (60%) of the RVpositive cases and in 2 (22%) of the enterovirus-positive cases (Table IV) . As single viral identifications (n = 20), RVs were associated with early school-age asthma, independently of age, sex, and atopic dermatitis on entry into the study. When the mixed RV infections (n = 5) were included in the analyses, the risk for asthma remained increased (OR, 2.29) but the statistical significance was lost. In contrast, enteroviruses had no association with later asthma. In all, RVs were identified in frozen NPAs in more than one half (56%) of the later asthmatics. The figure varied from 25% to 75% in the 4 different age groups, from the youngest to the oldest group, respectively.
