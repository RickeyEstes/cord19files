Electrophoresis of cytoplasmic MHV RNA. 32P-labeled RNA from coronavirusinfected cells was used as a probe to detect RNA-binding proteins from purified virus. The probe was a mixture of genomic RNA and six subgenomic mRNAs which form a nested set with common 3' ends ( Fig. 1 ; Robb and Bond, 1979; Spaan et aL, 1981; Wege et al, 1981) . By densitometric scan, 52% of the labeled RNA was found to be of genome size (band 1; 5.5 X 106). The molecular masses in megadaltons of the mRNAs were as follows: band 2, 3.41; band 3, 2.71; band 4,1.16; band 5,1.03; band 6,0.79; band 7, 0.65. The band at the top of the gel was at the origin and probably consisted of RNA aggregates. The =P-labeled MHV-A59 RNA and cytoplasmic RNA from uninfected cells were degraded by RNAse and were therefore single-stranded and free of protein (data not shown). of q-labeled MHV cytoplasmic RNA. Cytoplasmic RNA was endogenously labeled with inorganic phosphate and purified from MHV-A59-infected 1'7 Cl 1 cells, as described in the text. The RNA sample loaded onto the gel was 7.25 X 10' cpm. Identification of RNA-bindiw proteins in virions. RNA-binding proteins from purified virions were identified with the RNA overlay-protein blot assay using cytoplasmic 32P-MHV RNA as the probe (Fig.  2) . The major RNA-binding protein in MHV virions was the 50K nucleocapsid protein, N. A previously undetected 140K viral protein (Fig. 2) was also identified as an RNA-binding protein. It comprised approximately 3.4% of the total virion protein as estimated by densitometric scans of an immunoblot (lane A) and a Coomassie bluestained gel. Preliminary studies suggest that the 140K protein bound RNA as effectively as did the N protein on a weightby-weight basis. There was no detectable binding of RNA by either form of the E2 glycoprotein, which forms the viral spikes. Glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of El, the membrane glycoprotein, bound only trace amounts of RNA. 32P-labeled RNA from VW-infected cells also bound to the N and 140K proteins of MHV with high efficiency (Fig. 2, lane C) , indicating that the observed RNA-binding was not nucleotide sequence specific. Characterization of the l@K protein. The 140K protein was detected by immunoblotting purified virion proteins isolated from 17 Cl 1 cells, with monospecific antiserum against N protein, but not with monospecific antisera against the other viral proteins El and E2 (Fig. 3) . Anti-El detected both monomeric and dimeric El (Fig. 3 loaded gels reacted specifically with antiserum to N (Fig. 3 , lane C) but did not associate significantly with RNA (data not shown). Antiserum raised against NP-40disrupted virions also detected the 140K protein in virions grown in other cell types, including DBT, Sac-, and L2 cells (data not shown). The 140K protein was also detected in 1'7 Cl 1 and DBT cell extracts 18 to 24 hr p.i. (data not shown). To determine whether the 140K protein was a multimer of N, total virion proteins of the 140K band excised from a gel were boiled and treated with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol before electrophoresis (Fig. 4) . Reduction of the 140K protein yielded only N (Fig. 4B, lane 2) . The same relationship between the 140K protein and N was demonstrated by reacting them with 32P-labeled cytoplasmic RNA from MHV-infected cells (data not shown). Thus, the 140K protein appears to be a multimeric molecule composed of three N monomers held together by intermolecular sulfhydryl bonds. Detection of RNA-binding proteins in mock-irlfected and MHV-in&ected cells. The RNA-binding proteins of mock-infected and MHV-infected 17 Cl 1 cells were identified using the ROPBA (Fig. 5) . N was readily detectable as an RNA-binding protein at 8 hr p.i. in MHV-A59-and MHV-JHM-infected cell extracts (data not shown). The electrophoretic mobility of N from MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM cell extracts differed by 3 kDa. In cell extracts prepared at 15 hr (MHV-A59) and 13 hr (MHV-JHM) p.i., the ROPBA detected two additional virus-specific RNA-binding proteins which migrated slightly ahead of N (Fig. 5B) . These proteins, designated N' and N" because they reacted with monospecific anti-N antibody (Fig. 5A) , are believed to be cleavage products of N (Cheley and Anderson, 1981) , and may be degradation products. That they have RNA-binding activity suggests that their RNA-binding domains were not removed by cleavage. There were many cellular proteins in the protein blots of uninfected 17 Cl 1 cell extracts. Of these, at least 12 bound MHV-A59 RNA in the ROPBA (Fig. 5B) . Cellular RNA-binding proteins, including ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in translation, have been studied by the ROPBA and protein is a multimer of N. Protein samples were run on a 5-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel after the usual 37" treatment for 30 min (A) or after boiling 5 min, followed by reduction with 5% 2-mercaptoethanol (B). After electroblotting, the blot was reacted with virion-specific antiserum (1:lOO dilution), and developed with horseradish peroxidase and I-chloro-1-naphthol. Lanes 1, purified MHV-A59 virus (2.8 pg); lanes 2, gel-purified 140K protein.

The molecular weights of marker proteins are shown on the right, and are in kilodalton units. other methods (Rozier and Mache, 1984; Gourse et aL, 1981; Shatkin et al., 1982) . Interaction of MHV RNA-binding proteins with nucleic acida The affinity of viral RNA for proteins in infected cell extracts was studied by reacting separate strips of a protein blot with RNA in buffers containing different sodium chloride concentrations and washing in the corresponding buffer (Fig. 6) . Increasing the salt concentration above 0.075 M reduced RNA binding and very little binding was detected above 0.1 MNaCl. Subsequent amido black staining of the same blot showed that proteins were not dissociated from the paper at this ionic strength. RNA binding was also pH dependent. It diminished above pH 8 and background increased below pH 7 (not shown). To examine the nucleotide sequence specificity of the RNA-protein interaction, mock-infected and MHV-A594nfected 17 Cl 1 cell extracts were electroblotted from SDS gels and probed with several different 32P-labeled nucleic acids (Fig. 7) . Probes were equalized with respect to counts per minute per milliliter. In 15-hr MHV-A59 infected cell extracts, similar bands of RNA-binding proteins were detected using as probes MHV-A59 RNA, cellular RNA, MHV leader cDNA, and ds BRV RNA. N bound all of the probes tested. Longer exposure of Fig. 7C yielded the same pattern of viral and cellular RNA-binding proteins seen with the other probes. N also bound 32P-5'-end labeled HSV-1 and calf thymus DNAs (not shown). These results showed that, in the ROPBA, N protein bound nucleic acids in a manner which was not specific for nucleotide sequence. DISCUSSION We have identified RNA-binding proteins of a coronavirus using a sensitive and direct method, the RNA overlay-protein blot assay (Bowen et a& 1980) . In MHV virions, the N protein was found to be the major viral RNA-binding protein (Fig. 2) , as expected since the helical viral nucleocapsid is composed of N protein and genomic RNA (Sturman et aL, 1980) . In purified MHV-A59 virions we detected a new 140K mol wt RNA-binding protein which is apparently a trimer of N protein held together by intermolecular disulfide bonds. The 140K protein was not detected previously because reduction of SDS-PAGE samples dissociated its intermolecular disulfide bonds (Fig. 4) . Formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds does not prevent the N subunits of 140K from binding to RNA. A trimeric assembly of N protein may be a general feature of coronaviruses. In bovine coronavirions a 160K disulfidelinked protein which reacts with antiserum to the nucleocapsid protein has recently been detected (Hogue et aL, 1984) . Oligomerization of some molecules of N is POSsibly associated with nucleocapsid or virion assembly, perhaps stabilizing the helical structure of the nucleocapsid by linking N monomers on successive turns of the helix. Oligomeric nucleic acid-binding proteins appear to be common virus structural components. The nucleocapsid of HSV-2 contains a protein of mol wt 350K which consists of two disulfide-linked proteins (Zweig et a& 1979) , and disulfide-bonded multimeric forms of DNA-binding proteins of vaccinia and hepatitis B viruses have recently been detected (Ichihashi et uL, 1984; Petit and Pillot, 1985) . Binding of RNA to N in the ROPBA was weak since RNA was dissociated at a salt concentration of 0.1 M (Fig. 6) . The interaction of the rotavirus core protein VP2 with rotavirus RNA in the ROPBA is affected similarly by ionic strength (Boyle and Holmes, submitted) . Biologically significant interactions of RNA with viral proteins can occur at low ionic strength. For example, in vitro assembly of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA and protein is routinely done at 0.1&f ionic strength, pH 7 (Butler, 1984) . The binding of RNA to N detected by the ROPBA was not nucleotide sequence specific, since several different types of nucleic acids bound to N. The biological significance of this weak, nonsequence specific RNA-binding is unclear. Partial denaturation of N during SDS-PAGE and electroblotting may have favored nonsequence specific binding. Alternatively, lack of nucleotide sequence specificity in N binding may reflect a property intrinsic to proteins which form helical nucleocapsids encasing the entire genome. During assembly of some viruses with helical nucleocapsids, such as VSV (Blumberg et aL, 1983) and TMV (Butler, 1984) , a specific nucleation site on the viral RNA is required to bind the first protein molecules, but binding of subsequent protein monomers to the remainder of the genomic RNA is not nucleotide sequence specific. Sequence specific RNA-binding of N might be identified using short RNA probes for specific regions of the coronavirus genome in competitive binding studies using the ROPBA or filter binding assays (Riggs et aL, 1970) . The RNA-binding domains of N and the 140K trimer of N are probably in one or more of the five basic regions of the N pro-tein (Armstrong et al, 1983a, 198313; Skinner and Siddell, 1983) . In other nucleic acidbinding proteins, phosphorylation regulates nucleic acid-binding (Wilcox et cd, 1980; DeBenedetti and Baglioni, 1934; Leis and Johnson, 1934) . In MHV N protein, a serine-rich region (ser 194-ser 220), which could be a site for phosphorylation, may be involved in RNA binding. Using a solid phase binding assay with synthetic peptides of N protein domains, it should now be possible to identify the RNA-binding domain(s) of the N protein. The ROPBA has proved to be a useful approach for initial identification of the major coronavirus RNA-binding proteins. Additionally, this assay has been used to detect nonstructural RNA-binding proteins in extracts of rotavirus-infected cells (Boyle and Holmes, submitted) . Coronavirus nonstructural proteins, which are present in low amounts in infected cells, were not detected with the ROPBA, possibly because they comigrate with cellular RNA-binding proteins. Two-dimensional electrophoresis may help to detect RNAbinding activity of coronavirus nonstructural proteins. Note added, in prooj While this manuscript was in preparation, the ROPBA was used to identify an RNAbinding protein of Berne virus, a member of the To rowi& (Horzinek et al, 1985) .
