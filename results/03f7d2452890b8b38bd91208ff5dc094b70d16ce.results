Results are reported using the Pronovost Knowledge Translation Cycle. 17 Summarize the science A literature review focused on the current evidence for opportunities and barriers to compliance in infection control, including hand hygiene that is the most researched infection control intervention, and in addition evidence from related fields such as psychology. Five themes emerged that are summarized. a) Knowledge, education, and training Improving infection control knowledge, education, and training can enhance compliance and potentially reduce infection acquisition, [21] [22] [23] although its impact and value is disputed. 24, 25 The effect of education is difficult to gauge as it is one of a bundle of interventions in studies in which it has been judged to be beneficial. [26] [27] [28] [29] Further, improvements after education may not be sustained, [30] [31] [32] and may require continuous renewal to sustain reported effectiveness, 29 although a limited ongoing residual effect has been reported. 33 The "stickiness" 34 and memorability of ideas have influenced key concepts such as the "My Five Moments of Hand Hygiene" concept 35 promoted by the World Health Organization, which has been widely adopted as an approach to indicate when hands should be cleaned. Lack of understanding of expectations and ambiguity is a significant barrier to compliance, particularly with guidelines. 36 This is compounded by the considerable variation in the scope, approach, content, expectations, and terminology in infection control guidance and recommendations. 37, 38 Improving and clarifying infection control information and expectations may improve compliance, 39 knowledge and high levels of self-efficacy are recognized to improve performance, 40 whereas poor self-efficacy, despite good theoretical knowledge, is more likely to be associated with lower compliance. 25
