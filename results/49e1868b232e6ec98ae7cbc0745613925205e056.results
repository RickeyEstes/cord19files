Bi(III) exerts anti-MBL activity in vitro. The antimicrobial activities of metal compounds with a β-lactam antibiotic were initially screened against a clinical isolate of NDM-1-positive E. coli, hereafter denoted as NDM-HK (Supplementary Table 1) 33 . The NDM-1-producing strain was confirmed to be resistant to a carbapenem, meropenem (MER) as judged by its minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 16 µg mL −1 , which is higher than the breakpoint value (>8 µg mL −1 ) for MER against Enterobacteriaceae defined by European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) 34 . The growth inhibition was examined in the presence of 10, 50, and 200 µM of a panel of metal compounds and MER at subinhibitory concentration (½MIC) for 24 h after bacterial inoculation. Primary screening gave rise to two active metal compounds i.e., bismuth nitrate (Bi (NIT) 3 ) and gallium nitrate with >90% growth inhibition based on optical density (OD) reading ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). (Bi (NIT) 3 ) showed higher bioactivity than gallium nitrate in the subsequent colony-forming unit (CFU) counting, in which, surprisingly, no colony was observed in agar plate after serial dilutions when (Bi(NIT) 3 ) was used ( Supplementary Fig. 1b) . This implies that Bi(III) compounds may facilitate MER to kill NDM-1 producer. Given its clinical usage for the treatment of H. pylori infection, CBS was selected to further evaluate whether it can be repurposed to treat MBL-positive bacterial infection together with β-lactam antibiotics. We first examined whether CBS (Fig. 1a) can resensitize NDM-1 producers toward carbapenem using MER as an example. Standard checkerboard microdilution method was used to monitor the interaction between MER and CBS against NDM-HK. A strain cured of pNDM-HK served as NDM-1-negative control, denoted as NDM-HK PCV (plasmid cured variant), with MIC of 0.03 µg mL -1 for MER. CBS itself showed no or minor growth inhibition toward either NDM-1-positive (Fig. 1b) or negative bacteria (Fig. 1c ) even at 256 µg mL -1 ; however, when MER and CBS were used in combination, the MIC values of MER against NDM-HK gradually dropped to 2 µg mL -1 ( Fig. 1b and Table 1 ), which is the empirical susceptible level according to EUCAST 34 , and the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was determined to be 0.250 (Supplementary Table 2) , indicative of the synergistic interaction between them (FICI ≤0.5 is defined as synergism). By contrast, no such synergism was detected in NDM-HK PCV (FICI = 2 as shown in Fig. 1c) . The potent synergy is also demonstrated by time kill curves, which show that the population of NDM-HK at the exponential phase is significantly lowered (by more than 1000-fold) upon exposure to the drug combination of MER and CBS for 24 h (Fig. 1d) . CBS could reduce MIC values of MER toward NDM-1-positive, but not negative strain, suggesting that CBS might abolish the enzymatic activity of NDM-1. To examine whether CBS is able to inhibit enzymatic activity of NDM-1, we carried out the steady-state kinetics using MER as a substrate and observed dose-dependent inhibition on the activities of NDM-1 and related MBLs, e.g., VIM-2 and IMP-4 by CBS (Fig. 1e) , ultimately leading to the activities of MBLs being inhibited by approximately 90%. Comparable halfmaximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values of CBS were observed for NDM-1, VIM-2, and IMP-4, which were determined to be 2.81, 3.54, and 0.70 µM, respectively ( Fig. 1e and Table 2 ). In consistence with cell-based studies, the results of the enzymatic assays confirm the capability of CBS in restoring MER antimicrobial activity was attributable to its inhibition on NDM-1 activity. We also observed a similar synergism pattern Table 1 to exemplify their potent synergy with MER against different MBL producers. In particular, a complex of bismuth with N-acetyl-cysteine (Bi(NAC) 3 ) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity against different MBL-positive strains with a 32-fold, 64-fold, and 16-fold decrease in the MIC of MER against NDM-1-positive, VIM-2-positive, and IMP-4-positive E. coli, respectively, and the FICI values ranged from 0.063 to 0.188 ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ). The combination of MER and Bi(NAC) 3 was able to eradicate the bacterium completely within 6 h ( Supplementary Fig. 4a ). Such an excellent inhibitory activity may arise from cooperative inhibition of Bi(III) ions and NAC ligand dissociated from Bi(NAC) 3 , as well as elevated cellular uptake of Bi(III) (Supplementary Fig. 4b) . Moreover, the bactericidal activity of MER against MBLpositive bacterial strains was also boosted by Bi(III) compounds, manifested by a 2-16-fold decrease in its minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) of MER (Table 1 and Supplementary  Table 2 ). The enzyme-based assay further demonstrates that the Bi(III) compounds were able to inhibit MBLs with comparable IC 50 values (Table 2 ). Among them, (Bi(NIT) 3 The result shows that the inhibitory effect on MBLs was generally observed for Bi(III) compounds. This is sufficient to demonstrate that the inactivation of these MBLs is attributed primarily to Bi (III) ions.
