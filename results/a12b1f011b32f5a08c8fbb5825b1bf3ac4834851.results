Of the 1462 women with pneumonia, 1363 (about 93%) were bacterial pneumonia. Table 1 presents the distributions of maternal, paternal, and infant charac-teristics between women with and without pneumonia. After matching for maternal age, we found that there was no significant difference in the distribution of infant sex, parity, maternal highest educational level, and geographic region. In addition, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of comorbidities of gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, anemia, hyperlipidemia, alcohol abuse/alcohol dependence syndrome, and obesity between women with and without pneumonia. However, women with pneumonia were more likely to have CHD than women without pneumonia (P ϭ .002). The prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes is presented in Table 2 . It shows that women with pneumonia had a higher prevalence of LBW infants (9.8% vs 5.9%, P Ͻ .001), preterm births (12.3% vs 7.1%, P Ͻ .001), SGA infants (20.7% vs 16.2%, P Ͻ .001), CS (55.5% vs 40.6%, P Ͻ .001), preeclampsia/eclampsia (2.7% vs 0.8%, P Ͻ .001), and Apgar scores Ͻ7 at 5 minutes (0.7% vs 0.2%, P Ͻ .001) than women without pneumonia. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of major congenital anomalies (0.9% vs 0.7%, P ϭ .396) between women with and without pneumonia. Moreover, the distributions of adverse pregnancy outcomes did not differ significantly for women with viral and with bacterial pneumonia (data not shown in table). Table 3 presents the crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for adverse pregnancy outcomes between women with and without pneumonia. Conditional logistic regression analyses (conditioned on maternal age group) revealed that compared to women without pneumonia, the OR for LBW, preterm birth, SGA, CS, Apgar scores Ͻ7 at 5 minutes, and preeclampsia/eclampsia in women with pneumonia were 1.73 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.41-2.12), 1.71 (95% CI, 1.42-2.05), 1.35 (95% CI, 1.17-1.56), 1.77 (95% CI, 1.58 -1.98), 3.86 (95% CI, 1.64 -9.06), and 3.05 (95% CI, 2.01-4.63) respectively, after adjusting for highest maternal educational level, marital status, geographic region, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, CHD, anemia, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and alcohol abuse/alcohol dependence syndrome, as well as infant sex and parity, and paternal age. There was no increased OR for congenital anomalies for women with pneumonia. Furthermore, we analyzed the OR for adverse pregnancy outcomes according to pregnancy trimester. We found that the onset of pneumonia in about 93.6% of the women analyzed in this study occurred during the first trimester. Table 4 shows that when compared to comparison women, the adjusted OR for LBW, preterm birth, SGA, CS, Apgar scores Ͻ7 at 5 minutes, and preeclampsia/eclampsia in women with pneumonia during
