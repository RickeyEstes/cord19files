The mean age and the mean BMI of the patients did not differ significantly among the four groups whereas the controls were significantly younger and their BMI was significantly lower (ANOVA-test). The proportion of diabetic patients did not differ significantly among four patient groups (chisquare = 1.69, P = 0.639) as well as the proportion of patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia (chi-square = 1.63, P = 0.652).
