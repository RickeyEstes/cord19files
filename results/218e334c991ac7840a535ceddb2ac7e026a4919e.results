The epidemic curve for a base-case pandemic with R 0 of 2.5 had a 12-week duration ( Figure 2 ). When no action was taken, peak HCW absenteeism was ≈10%. Treatment only, using 121,000 doses of oseltamivir, decreased peak absenteeism to 8%. Prophylaxis for 4 weeks required 117,000 treatment doses in addition to 560,000 dedicated prophylaxis doses (equivalent to treatment courses for 1.6% of the general population) and led to higher peak absenteeism than treatment only. Eight weeks of prophylaxis required 52,000 treatment doses in addition to 1.12 million dedicated prophylaxis doses (equivalent to treatment courses for 2.7% of the general population) and reduced peak absenteeism to ≈2%; the peak occurred as a secondary increase after termination of prophylaxis. Discontinuing prophylaxis for clinical infections and redistributing stockpiles to prolong prophylaxis in other HCWs did not provide additional outcome benefits because the doses saved were insignificant; >96% were used during the preplanned duration for the relevant scenarios. From the Monte Carlo simulation of peak absenteeism for different strategies in a pandemic with R 0 of 2.5, with varying disease severity and antiviral efficacy parameters, 6 weeks of prophylaxis was sufficient under all scenarios to have a net benefit over treatment only (Figure 3 ). One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the following input parameters had the most effect on peak absen-teeism: "days of medical leave without treatment," with 15%-96% variation from the baseline outcome, depending on the R 0 and strategy used; "reduction in medical leave with treatment" with 22%-61% variation; "symptomatic proportion in infected persons without prophylaxis" with 19%-25% variation; and "oseltamivir efficacy in preventing disease in infected persons" with 21%-87% variation. Other input parameters had less effect on the outcome. Table 2 shows the outcomes for pandemics with different R 0 . If no action was taken for pandemics with R 0 >2, absenteeism exceeded 5% for >15 days. In pandemics with lower R 0 (≤2), pandemic durations were longer and peak absenteeism did not exceed 10%. Treatment only in these pandemics reduced peak absenteeism by as much as 25% compared with no action. However, prophylaxis of ≈8 weeks did not accrue substantial benefits over treatment only. Pandemics with higher R 0 (>4) were of shorter durations; peak absenteeism was >20% in some scenarios. Treatment only reduced peak absenteeism by >15%, and 6 weeks of prophylaxis was sufficient to reduce peak absenteeism by >75% over no action. Across all R 0 , insufficient durations of prophylaxis increased peak absenteeism compared with results for treatment only. During a pandemic similar in severity to the 1918 influenza pandemic, with a 5% mortality rate and R 0 of 4 (14) , peak absenteeism reached 20% with no action; hospitalizations and deaths contributed substantially to absenteeism, unlike the situation in less severe pandemics. The 3 strategies-treatment only, 4 weeks of prophylaxis, and 6 weeks of prophylaxis-reduced peak absenteeism by 25%, 43%, and 80%, respectively. We also tested the adequacy of prophylaxis for a basecase pandemic under different scenarios for HCW-to-HCW and patient-to-HCW transmission. Higher HCW-to-HCW transmission resulted in an increased postprophylaxis epi- demic peak. The HCW epidemic coincided with the general population epidemic if the patient-to-HCW infections variable was minimized (H/P = 0). Increasing H/P alone shifted the HCW epidemic such that it preceded the general population epidemic and amplified peak absenteeism by as much as 1.4× for the base case. For the prophylaxis strategies, increasing the patient-to-HCW transmission resulted in the distribution of HCW absenteeism away from the postprophylaxis period into the pre-and intraprophylaxis periods, which resulted in lower peak absenteeism up to a point. For H/P >2.0, peak absenteeism occurred before initiation of prophylaxis, negating the effect of longer durations of prophylaxis. Under all HCW-to-HCW and patientto-HCW transmission scenarios for a base-case pandemic, 6 weeks of prophylaxis provided equal or superior results to treatment only; 8 weeks of prophylaxis was always superior (Online Technical Appendix). Figure 4 shows the changes in peak absenteeism when latent and infectious periods were varied. For any rate of growth, assuming different latent periods changed peak absenteeism by <1% for most scenarios; assuming longer infectious periods increased peak absenteeism by <3%. However, epidemics with higher growth rates for any latent and infectious periods increased peak absenteeism by >10% when no action was taken. Although changes in the transmission parameters substantially changed peak absenteeism levels for certain scenarios, the overall conclusions remained similar. For epidemics with low peak absenteeism (<10%) and prolonged duration (low growth rate), prophylaxis strategies were less effective than treatment only. In contrast, for epidemics with higher peak absenteeism (>10%) and shorter duration (high growth rate), prophylaxis of >6 weeks was superior to treatment only. Figure 5 shows the adequacy of prophylaxis for a base-case pandemic under different prophylaxis initiation points based on pandemic detection. Earlier detection and prophylaxis initiation resulted in a greater likelihood that shorter durations of prophylaxis would be ineffective. If prophylaxis were initiated on entry of the first pandemic case, 14 weeks of prophylaxis would be required for maximal benefit. Prophylaxis for 6 weeks was more effective than treatment only if it was initiated when incident pandemic cases in the general population exceeded 10% of the ILI rate, whereas 8 weeks of prophylaxis was effective when incident pandemic cases exceeded 1%.
