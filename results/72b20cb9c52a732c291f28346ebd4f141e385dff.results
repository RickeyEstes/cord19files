The internal reliability of each year's six-core-competencybased OSCE had excellent agreement (Table 1 , Cronbach's alpha in 2007 ¼ 0.728, in 2008 ¼ 0.69, in 2009 ¼ 0.87). The overall 3-year internal reliability of summary OSCE scores and core-competency subscores were also acceptable ( Table 3 ). In addition to professionalism aspects of core-competency, the overall 3-year inter-rater reliability (Kappa statistics) on the summary OSCE scores and core-competency subscores was also good (Table 4 ). In Fig. 1A , a significant difference in the performance between different aspects of core competency (F ¼ 49.8, p < 0.05) was noted. PGY 1 residents had the highest pass rate in the aspect of interpersonal and communication skills (81%), whereas the lowest pass rate was noted in the aspect of professionalism (53%). Interestingly, the corresponding data in Table 3 confirmed that the highest subscores were noted in the aspects of interpersonal and communication skills, whereas the lowest subscores were observed in the professionalism aspect. The eigen values (with variance accounted for presented in parentheses) of the six factors resulting from this PCA of our study were 6.28 (28%), 2.93 (39%), 2.17 (47%), 2.25 (54%), 1.4 (59%) and 1.4 (63%), respectively. Additionally, the resulting scree plot of the eigen values revealed that the leveling off to a straight horizontal line occurred after the sixth eigen value. Then, we performed a principal axis factor analysis with oblique rotation to a preselected six-factor solution. The factors that emerged from this analysis clearly reflect each of the six core competencies of residency (Table  2) . Intriguingly, items from each competency loaded on their intended factor and did not load with items from different scales of competencies. In other words, the factor analysis resulted in a nearly perfectly clean structure, providing evidence that our theoretically derived items in checklist of PGY 1 OSCE were distinct and evident in the reflection of core competence of their clinical performance. In a sub-group of PGY 1 residents who received both the pre-course and post-course six core-competency-based OSCE, the test/retest (external) reliability was borderline (Table 4 ). However, we clearly observed significantly increased OSCE scores and subscores after the internal medicine training program. Meanwhile, the pass rates were markedly improved in all aspects of core competencies in PGY 1 residents (Fig. 1B) . The most improved aspects were patient care and professionalism (Table 5 ). In contrast, the performance in systems-based practice was not significantly improved after the training program.
