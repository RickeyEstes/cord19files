Virtual screening outcomes. The goal of this study was to identify molecules that inhibit EBOV infection by interfering with the interactions required for formation of the GP2 six-helix bundle (6HB). Since the conformational change required to produce the postfusion structure is dependent on CHR binding the NHR region of GP2 (Fig. 1 ), a virtual screen of approximately 1.7 million compounds was conducted to a five-helix bundle model of GP2 constructed by the removal of one CHR from a high-resolution postfusion structure (PDB entry 2EBO [25] ) (see Materials and Methods, below). Compound prioritization led to 83 candidates purchased for experimental testing (Fig. 2 ) and employed five distinct scoring functions: DCE SUM (DOCK Cartesian van der Waals and electrostatic energy), FPS VDW (footprint comparison of the van der Waals energy of the reference peptide and selected ligands), FPS ES (footprint for electrostatic energy), FPS SUM (footprint for both van der Waals and electrostatic energy), and TS (total score; the combination of DCE SUM and FPS SUM ). A large number of molecules was prioritized based on their structural and spatial similarity to the reference ligand composed of a segment of the CHR that made the most favorable interactions with our model of a GP2 five-helix bundle. As a rule, all 83 compounds chosen for experimental testing showed good overlap with the reference (Fig. 2A) . However, those selected based on favorable footprint similarity (FPS) have somewhat better overlap than those selected based on DCE or TS (Fig. 2B) . Consistent with visual inspection (Fig. 2) , molecules in each of the five groups share similar size and flexibility, with a mean molecular weight (MW) distribution of 467.3 g/mol and number of rotatable bonds of 9.5 (Table 1) . Compounds purchased based on similarity in electrostatic (ES) interaction profiles (FPS ES ) had the overall smallest MW (414.0 g/mol) and fewer numbers of rotatable bonds (8.3) , while those selected from the TS list were largest (492.3 g/mol) ( Table 1) . As expected (45, 55) , compounds selected using a specific scoring function (Table 1 , scoring function column) generally showed the best average score with regard to that specific chemical or physical property (Table 1 , Property columns). For example, compounds prioritized using the DCE SUM function yielded a more favorable (lower) average DCE SUM energy (Ϫ65 kcal/ mol) than those obtained using other functions (Ϫ49 to Ϫ59 kcal/mol). Likewise, molecules selected using FPS SUM resulted in a more favorable average FPS SUM score (5.5) than the other groups (7.8 to 19.1). For compounds prioritized using FPS ES and FPS VDW footprint components, the scores were the lowest (1.6) and second lowest (3.9), respectively, among their respective FPS ES and FPS VDW groups. For the DCE SUM -selected group, the favorable scores can be attributed to strong ES interactions resulting in an average DCE ES score of Ϫ15.5 kcal/mol, over 2-fold greater than the ensemble average (Ϫ6.9 kcal/mol). The overall strength of the DCE SUM scores, in conjunction with being the second smallest group in terms of MW and number of rotatable bonds (9.2), suggests that the DCE SUM list compounds are highly polar. In contrast, the TS list interactions are dominated by strong VDW interactions due to their larger size (MW ϭ 492 g/mol) ( Table 1) . Consistent with the fact that FPS SUM is a part of the TS scoring function, the FPS score components are better than those observed using DCE SUM . However, the overlap is relatively moderate (FPS SUM ϭ 10.5, FPS VDW ϭ 6.8, FPS ES ϭ 3.7); therefore, future work could explore increasing the contribution of the FPS component of TS. In summary, molecular property analysis confirms that the 83 purchased candidates are similar in size and flexibility but diverse in terms of interaction energy and overlap the reference peptide. Nine molecules from the initial in silico screen inhibit EBOV-pseudotyped virus entry in vitro. The 83 compounds identified from the aforementioned in silico screen were tested for their ability to inhibit EBOV entry and for cytotoxicity at 25 M (6, 30, 45) . EBOV (HIV-1/EBOV)-pseudotyped virus entry into 293T cells was quantified by luciferase signal normalized by cytotoxicity and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control to yield the infectivity signal per cell as a fraction of the maximum (see Materials and Methods). Encouragingly, nine compounds resulted in a normalized luciferase signal of Յ0.25 (Fig. 3, blue) . Additionally, the observed luciferase signal for the nine compounds was approximately 1.5 standard deviations below the average infectivity signal for all 83 purchased molecules, 0.76 Ϯ 0.40. Although the two compounds with the most activity (I01 and I49) were also the most cytotoxic (Fig. 3 , lower, blue), all nine hits with activity were retained and used as starting points for identification of structurally related analogs in a secondary computational screen (see Discussion). Secondary similarity screen. To identify additional compounds with enhanced activity, a second similarity-based computational screen was conducted to explore the chemical search space around the nine initial hits. Each of the hits in turn was used to rescore and rerank the top 100,000 docked molecules from the initial screen to identify compounds with similar functionality and three-dimensional (3D) shape using the DOCK Hungarian similarity (HMS) scoring function (56) . The 500 top-scoring molecules from the nine unique lists were further interrogated using five additional functional methods to assess energy score (DCE) and similarity to the initial hit (footprint [FPS], pharmacophore [FMS], volume overlap [VOS], and Tanimoto). Figure 4 compares docked geometries for four of the initial hits (gray) overlaid with two representative compounds each (orange) from the secondary screen. In these examples, with the exception of I49, the compounds generally showed strong overlap and made residue-based interaction patterns similar to those of their respective references (Fig. 4 ), corresponding to a high average VOS score of ϳ0.7 and a low average FPS score of ϳ5.6. Despite the overall similarity of ligand scaffolds within each group, the use of different DOCK functions generally resulted in the selection of chemically diverse molecules at the atomic level. In some cases, however, the same ligand was the top-ranked candidate across the different groups. For example, rank ordering by pharmacophore or volume overlap yielded the same top-scored results for I01 (FMS ϭ 1.56, VOS ϭ 0.82), which suggests high structure and functional similarity with the initial hit (Fig. 4 , FMS and VOS). Overall, the secondary virtual screen resulted in the selection of 82 additional candidates, which were subsequently evaluated for inhibition and cytotoxicity at 25 M against EBOV-pseudotyped virus. A luciferase signal of Յ0.25, which was more than 1 standard deviation below the population mean luciferase signal of 0.54 Ϯ 0.30, was used to identify 16 additional hits with moderate to low cytotoxicity ( Fig. 3 , green, S prefix). Dose-response characterization of candidates against HIV/EBOV-GP-pseudotyped virus. To further explore the 25 most promising candidates identified from the two in silico screens (9 initial plus 16 secondary), in terms of reducing infectivity and their effects on cell viability, the dose-dependent activity for each was measured. Of the 25 tested from Fig. 3 , 11 compounds exhibited generally well-behaved entry inhibition compared to that of the known control inhibitor, E64, seemingly independent of cytotoxicity, especially at the observed 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values, as shown in Fig. 5 . The structures of the 11 compounds, with code names, are shown in Fig. 6 . Encouragingly, of the 11 molecules, 7 exhibited IC 50 values under 10 M, comparable to the results observed for the control inhibitor E64 (IC 50 ϭ 5.70 Ϯ 5.67 M) under the same conditions ( Fig. 5 and Table 2 ). Specifically, the IC 50 values for I01, I49, and S31 were less than 5 M, and the IC 50 values for S03, S33, S36, and S49 were less than 10 M (Fig. 5 and Table 2 ). An accurate cytotoxic concentration that results in 50% cell death (CC 50 ) could be obtained for 9 of the 11 compounds. For S42, S58, and E64, the computed CC 50 values had large standard deviations, although examination of the cytotoxicity curves suggests minimal impact on cell viability. The two most potent molecules in this assay, I01 and I49, displayed CC 50 values of approximately 11 to 15 M ( Table 2 ). All other hits had observed CC 50 values of 29 M or greater. Selectivity index (SI ϭ CC 50 /IC 50 ) values were also calculated. The higher the SI ratio, the more potent and the safer the compound is projected to be in vivo. Examination of the data showed a range of SI values from 3 to 14 for pseudotyped virus ( Table 2) . Of the compounds with computable SI, the two hits with the greatest SI were S03 and S49, which have SI values around 13 (Table 2) .
