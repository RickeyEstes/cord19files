The plasma protein content of the patients and the controls are presented in Table 1 . No significant differences were observed in plasma protein contents of patients and controls. The ethanol fractionation was used to enrich low molecular weight proteins. As shown in Figure 1 , most of the low molecular weight proteins were enriched in the ethanol supernatant rather than the precipitate. We found that 50% (v/v) ethanol was more efficient in fractionating low molecular weight proteins. To avoid any protein losses from the sample, we used both supernatants and precipitates of these fractions for 2-DE analysis. For the first dimension 24 cm IPG strips with pH values in the range of 4-7 were used. The proteins were resolved in homogeneous 15% acrylamide gels in the second dimension to obtain greater resolution for small proteins. About 300 spots in each colloidal CBB-stained gel can be visualized by ImageMaster software. Representative 2-DE images of plasma profiles from a healthy control for 50% (v/v) ethanol precipitate and ethanol supernatant are shown in Figure 2A and 2B respectively. Comparing the proteomics patterns of these two gels shows that both immunoglobulin heavy and light chains are separated in ethanol precipitate ( Figure 2A ) and albumin is distributed both in ethanol supernatant and precipitate (Figure 2A and 2B) . Moreover, most of the small molecular weight proteins in the range of 15-50 kDa, have significantly (p < 0.05) higher spot volume and intensity in ethanol supernatant rather than precipitate ( Table 2 and Figures. 2A and 2A) . We analyzed the differences in the plasma protein patterns, comparing the gels of the diseased and healthy controls. The analysis of protein patterns of the plasma was focused on those protein spots which showed differences, comparing the patients and the controls. They were compared with Image Master 2-DE software and indicated only protein results in all cases (100%) with the same condition. As shown in Figures 2 B and 2C, twenty six protein spots were subjected to MALDI TOF MS analysis. All selected proteins and their isoforms were subsequently identified by PMF and MS/MS U S25% P25% S50% P50% S75% P75% Figure 1 SDS-PAGE of plasma proteins fractionated with different concentrations (v/v) of ethanol.

Table 3 lists the identities of the proteins and their isoforms which were analyzed in this experiment using MALDI TOF MS. Figures 2B and 2C shows the location of these protein spots in the 2-DE gels of a healthy controls and an exposed patients respectively. Volume and intensity of those protein spots which were only present in all patients' plasma but none of the healthy controls are shown in Table 4 . Images from other healthy volunteers and patients were similar (data not shown). Haptoglobin Î±1 chain isoforms (spots 21, 22 and 23) were only detected in the plasma of the severe lung diseases patients but were not detectable in healthy controls ( Figure 2B and 2C). Furthermore, serum Amyloid A1 isoforms (spots 24 and 26) were only seen in the plasma of the patients but none of the healthy controls ( Figure 2B and 2C).
