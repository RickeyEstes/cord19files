The control group was used to achieve the SNPs genotype frequency and to associate with severe acute viral bronchiolitis group. Table 3 shows SNPs description including MAF and HWE. SNPs rs10735810 (VDR) and rs11688 (JUN) assays failed in our test. SNPs rs1065341 and rs2280788 (CCL5) are not in HWE for patients and controls subjects. Moreover, SNP rs1060826 (NOS2) is not in HWE only for controls subjects. Fig. 1 and Table 4 show association between polymorphisms and the presence of bronchiolitis for different types of virus. The evaluation of the presence of bronchiolitis for different types of virus revealed an association between SNP rs2107538*CT (CCL5) and bronchiolitis caused by RSV (OR = 1.646; 95%CI = 1.054 to 2.57) and RSV subtype A (OR = 1.754; 95%CI = 1.06 to 2.902) specifically, and between SNP rs1060826*GG (NOS2) and bronchiolitis caused by rhinovirus (OR = 2.649; 95%CI = 1.309 to 5.362). In patients without comorbidities, we observed an association between SNP rs1060826*GG (NOS2) and bronchiolitis caused by rhinovirus (OR = 3.369; 95%CI = 1.435 to 7.908). Fig. 2 and Table 5 show association between polymorphisms and bronchiolitis severity. SNPs rs4986790*AG (TLR4) (OR = 8.025; 95%CI = 1.26 to 51.12) and rs2228570*CC (VDR) (OR = 8.889; 95%CI = 1.312 to 60.21) were associated with progression to death, rs352162*TT (TLR9) (OR = 5.207; 95%CI = 2.118 to 12.8), and rs187084*TC (OR = 0.455; 95%CI = 0.222 to 0.935) (TLR9) with ICU admission, and rs352162*CC + CT (TLR9) (OR = 2.718; 95%CI = 1.103 to 6.695) and rs2107538*TT (CCL5) (OR = 4.974; 95%CI = 1.047 to 23.63) with need for mechanical ventilation. Data are expressed as mean Â± standard deviation; medians (range) or frequencies (percentage). A.E. Alvarez et al. Gene 645 (2018) 7-17 In patients without comorbidities, SNP rs1898830 (TLR2) was associated with progression to death because the four patients who died during the study were heterozygous for this SNP (P = 0.036). Additionally, rs1927911*CC (TLR4) (OR = 3.578; 95%CI = 1.238 to 10.34) and rs2107538*TT (CCL5) (OR = 6; 95%CI = 1.221 to 29.48) were associated with need for mechanical ventilation, rs7656411*GT (TLR2) (OR = 2.5; 95%CI = 1.093 to 5.718) with length of oxygen use, and rs352162*TT (TLR9) (OR = 4.886; 95%CI = 1.689 to 14.13) and rs2280788 (CCL5) with ICU admission. The rs2280788 (CCL5) heterozygous genotype was only present in patients who required ICU admission (P = 0.036).
