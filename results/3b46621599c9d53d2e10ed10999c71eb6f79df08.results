Three hundred and eighty-four hospitalized patients were recruited into the study on 165 random-sampling days over the course of 10 study months. Based on the radiologic criteria detailed in the "Materials and Methods" section, 183 patients were allocated to the CAP group and 201 to the NPLRTI group. Over the same time, 450 control subjects were recruited into the study. Table 1 presents a comparison of participant characteristics, including age, sex, smoking status, and vaccinations for the three study groups. For data analysis purposes, any participant in whom at least one of the three samples was positive for one of the RVs was considered to be positive for that virus. Table 2 presents the distribution of the 12 viruses identifi ed in the three study groups (individually and by virus group) together with a comparison of the frequency of each main virus group, the total number of viruses, and the total number of subjects showing positive for the viruses between the CAP group and the other two study groups. The number of viruses identifi ed and the number of subjects showing positive for the viruses was signifi cantly higher in the CAP group than in the control group and signifi cantly lower than in the NLPRTI group. The same relationship was seen for infl uenza viruses and rhinovirus in the three groups. In the other two virus groups, RSV and coronaviruses, there were higher proportions in the CAP group compared with the control and NPLRTI groups. The mean age of the 58 patients with CAP who were positive for at least one virus was 63.4 6 17.5 years compared with 58.0 6 21.6 years for the 125 patients with CAP in whom no virus was identifi ed. This difference did not reach statistical signifi cance. Fourteen (24%) of the patients with CAP with at least one virus were present or past smokers compared with 53 (42%) of those who were negative for all viruses ( P 5 .03).
