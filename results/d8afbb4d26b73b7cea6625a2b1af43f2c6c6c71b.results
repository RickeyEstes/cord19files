A total of 1187 stool specimens were examined during the period of study. Viruses were detected in 336 specimens (28.3%). Ad was found more frequently than other viruses, being detected in 105 (8.8%) of specimens compared with 83 (7%) rotavirus (38 by EIA and 45 by EM). EM also detected eight (0.7%) Norwalk virus, seven (0.6%) astrovirus, six (0.5%) calici viruses, four (0.3%) corona viruses, and 35 (2.9%) undetermined small round viruses. Virus culture yielded 88 (7.4%) enterovirus isolates. A comparison of the number of Ad isolates detected in stool specimens by tissue culture (TC), EIA, and EM, and typing by restriction enzyme analysis is shown in Table 1 . The sensitivities of TC, EIA, and EM were 89% (93 of 105), 45% (47), and 35% (37), respectively. The relative percentage (and number) of enteric and conventional Ad types among the 105 positive specimens were 28% (29), and 65% (68) respectively, with 7% (8) of positive specimens proving untypeable. A total of 93 specimens yielded Ads in cell culture, 21 of which were enteric types and 68 conventional isolates. Four culture-positive Ads grown on HEp-2 cells could not be repassed for serotyping. The serotypes of nonenteric Ad are shown in Table  2 : 27% (10 of 37) of the EM positives were found to be nonenteric Ad, including Ad serotype numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, and 31 with 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, and 1 positives, respectively. Five culture-positive Ads were identified as variants of Ad2 (3), Ad3 (1), and Ad31 (1) by restriction enzyme analysis as they could not be identified by serum neutralization. A total of 29 (62%) of the 47 specimens that reacted with the group-reactive EIA were also positive with the Ad40-and Ad41-specific EIA. Similarly, 23 of 37 specimens or 62% of EM-positive specimens were identified as containing enteric adenovirus. Four of 37 EM positive Ad or 11% were only detectable by EM. Both the EIA and EM results suggest that the enteric Ads are more often present in amounts that are detectable by these techniques. Of the EIA-positive specimens, 21 demonstrated restriction patterns of a variant strain of Ad41 (Hammond et al., 1985) . The remaining eight Ad40/41 type-specific enteric EIA-positive specimens could not be cultured in 293 cells. The blocking assay was performed on five of these eight specimens and the results are shown in Table 3 . The reference strains of Ad40 (Dugan) and Ad41 (TAK) showed >50% reduction in OD with homologous Ad40 and Ad41 monoclonal antibody. With the variant strain, a partial reduction in OD (37%) of Ad41 variant and four Ad-positive specimens (varying from 12% to 33%) was seen with monoclonal antibody against Ad41. These data suggest that these culture-negative specimens may represent serotypes other than 40 or 41, or were variant enteric serotypes. The EM-negative stools and the stools containing other viruses were aOnly Ad-positive specimens by EM were cultured in 293. ~Fhese 10 specimens were also positive on HEp-2 cells. aAd serotypes 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, and 31 found to be positive by electron microscopy. bNumber of variants of prototypes of Ad species by restriction enzyme analysis. found to be negative by EIA, which reveals the high specificity of the Ad group EIA test. Ad was detectable throughout the year. More diagnoses of Ad occurred during spring (April) and early fall (September through November) as shown in Figure 1 . Distribution of Ad and rotavirus positives by age is shown in Figures 2 and 3 , respectively. Of the Ad-positive children, 73% were found to be K2 years of age. troenteritis in infants. They have also been implicated in diarrheal outbreaks in hospitals (Chiba et al., 1983; Flewett et al., 1975; Richmond et al., 1979) . Ads detectable in stools by EM are frequently associated with gastroenteritis (Brandt et al., 1979; Retter et al., 1979) . In our study, both nonenteric and enteric Ads, belonging to subgroups A, B, C, and F, were detectable by EM. Nonenteric Ads detectable by EM included serotypes 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, and 31. Two isolates of Ad31 (one Ad31 variant) were also identified, which have been implicated in diarrheal disease (Brown, 1990; Hammond et al., 1985) , which produce clinical symptoms similar to enteric Ad (Krajden et al., 1990) . Enteric Ad was detectable in 28% (29) of the 105 Ad-positive specimens, 21 of which were confirmed analysis, previously reported (Hammond et al., t 1985) . There was no Ad40 observed, which has been ~a reported to be diminishing in recent years (Brown, 1990; Van der Avoort et al., 1989) .
