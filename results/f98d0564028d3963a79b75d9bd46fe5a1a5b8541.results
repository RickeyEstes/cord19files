Overall mean seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in the sampled population is 46.9% (95% CI 41.4-52.5) with a prevalence of 60.8% (53.6-67.7) in the adult, 21.3% (12.9-31.8) in the juvenile, and 39.3% (27.1-52.7) in the young cohorts (S2 Fig; S1 Table) . All nine herds had at least one positive camel, with the lowest mean herd prevalence of 14.3% (95% CI 4.8-30.3%) and the highest of 82.9% (95% CI 66.4-93.4) (S1 Table) . In addition to MERS-CoV antibodies, there was a high level of circulation of BCoV (based on HCoV-OC43 S1 as a proxy) in the camels as has been previously documented in other dromedary camel populations (S2 Fig) [7] , [17] . All samples tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV (S1 Fig). Analyses of exposure by age provides evidence of higher levels in older individuals (F 2,23 = 2.661 p = 0.09); young animals had a significantly lower prevalence compared to adults (Duncan's test, P<0.05), as well as a trend towards higher prevalence rates in smaller herds (F 1,6 = 4.23; p = 0.085). There was no statistical effect based on herd management type, with prevalence in commercial herds (43.6%; 35.8-49.6), commercial/pastoralist herds (51.9%; 37.6-66.0) and nomadic herds (56.8%; 44.7-68.2) (X 2 ; P = 0.1). Additionally, there was no statistical difference in prevalence based on herd isolation with high (40%; 28.2-54.6), intermediate (52%; 41.2-60.5), and low (54%; 44.7-68.2) isolation (X 2 ; P = 0.6).
