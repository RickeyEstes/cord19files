The specimen extracted was identified as a male metastrongyloid nematode (Nematoda: Metastrongyloidea) of 14.4 mm long with caudal bursa and two spicules of 652 μm (Fig. 2) . Based on the length of the spicules, O. rostratus and A. abstrusus were discarded, whereas this length is similar to that found in Troglostrongylus spp. and G. paralysans. Two 18S ribosomal RNA gene fragments, 340 and 665 bp, were obtained (MG870088 and MG870089, respectively). A BLAST search of GenBank showed the highest identity (99%) with G. paralysans (GenBank Accesion number JX975484) obtained from Felis catus from Chile. Both fragments were concatenated to perform the phylogenetic analysis, which also showed that the nematode observed in this study is most closely related to G. paralysans (Fig. 3) . One week after surgery the fibrin deposits disappeared and the foci of chorioretinitis remained stable, but posterior synechiae were persistent, there was a presence of corneal edema in the area of the incision, and the individual showed incipient cataract. A local and oral treatment was performed for one month and two weeks respectively. Antiparasitic treatment was carried out with fipronil, (S)-methoprene, eprinomectin and praziquantel (Broadline spot-on ® Merial solution). Subsequent explorations were positive, and no symptoms of uveitis reappeared, leaving the foci of chorioretinitis inactive, whereas remnants of posterior synechiae and incipient cataracts remained as sequelae of surgery. After 6 months, the cat is stable and without symptoms, waiting for cataract surgery.
