The ideal number of 1% (or 5%) VaR violations is 10 or 50 in each replication. I will analyze the distribution of the number of VaR violations from each model to compare their VaR forecasting performance. As there are 1000 replications, such a distribution of the number of VaR violations will have 1000 points. Panel A and Panel B in Tables 2 and 3 respectively report mean and variance of the number of violations over one-step-ahead and five-step-ahead 1% VaR forecasts from each model. In general, under all the DGPs, the VaR forecasts provided by all the models are positively biased. The ARMA-RV model gives the most biased forecasts with the highest variance, and the HAR-CJN model provides the least biased forecasts with the lowest variance. More importantly, the two realized volatility models (HAR-CJ model and HAR-CJN model) which explicitly model jumps produce less biased and variant VaR forecasts than the other two realized volatility models. To assess the trade-off between bias and variance, I also employ the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to compare the VaR forecasting performances of these models. For example, the MSE of 1% VaR is defined as where X i is the number of violations in the ith replication, and 10 is the ideal number of violations for 1% VaR at each replication. Panel C in Tables 2 and 3 reports MSE of one-step-ahead and five-step-ahead 1% VaR forecasts of all the models. It is clear that under all the DGPs, ARMA model and HAR model perform a bit similarly. However, the HAR-CJ model and HAR-CJN model always have the lower MSEs than the other two models. Moreover, when the jump intensity is time-varying and state-dependent, the HAR-CJN model has lower MSEs than the HAR-CJ model, as the jump intensity dynamics are clearly modeled in the former. The similar tendencies are observed at 5% VaR forecasts, and the results associated with this can be provided upon request. These results provide a strong evidence that explicitly modeling jumps in realized volatility model can better describe the tail behavior, and thereby provide better tail point forecast of the asset return distribution.
