A respiratory virus was detected in 401 ⁄ 1055 (38AE0%) samples collected over the 2-year period from 2003 to 2004. The detection rate was higher in 2004, 248 ⁄ 559 (44AE4%), compared with 2003, 153 ⁄ 496 (30AE8%). CMV was most frequently found (158 ⁄ 1055; 15AE0%) followed by adenovirus (n = 65; 6AE2%), RSV (42; 4AE0%), parainfluenza 3 (n = 32; 3AE0%), hMPV (n = 28; 2AE6%), influenza virus A (n = 8; 0AE76%), parainfluenza virus 1 (n = 6; 0AE57%), parainfluenza virus 2 (n = 4; 0AE38%) and influenza virus B (n = 1; 0AE09%). In 48 (4AE5%) samples a known respiratory virus was grown in shell vial culture but could not be further identified. Of CMV-positive respiratory samples 44AE9% (71 ⁄ 158) were from HIV-infected children, 24AE0% (38 ⁄ 158) from HIV-negative children and for the remainder the HIV status was unknown. In both HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups the rates of co-infection with another known respiratory virus were similar, 12 ⁄ 71 (16AE9%) and 7 ⁄ 38 (18AE4%) respectively. HCoV-NL63 was detected in 4 ⁄ 496 (0AE81%) and 5 ⁄ 559 (0AE89%) samples from 2003 and 2004 respectively. All HCoV-NL63-infected children, with the exception of one aged 30 months, were under 2 years ( Table 1 ). The majority, 6 ⁄ 9 (66AE7%), were <6 months. The HIV status of only those children from 2004 was known and 4 ⁄ 5 HCoV-NL63-infected children from this year were HIV-positive. In two instances a co-pathogen was identified, hMPV and adenovirus. In 2003 3 ⁄ 4 positive samples were collected in March (autumn) while in 2004 HCoV-NL63-positive samples were found in March, May, August and September (Table 1) . A diagnosis of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection was made in six (67%) children. Two HCoV-NL63-positive infants aged 50 and 71 days respectively, required admission to the intensive care unit; both were HIV-positive.
