We identified a total of 194 PM episodes in 182 patients. Thirty eight (20 %) patients were diagnosed with recurrent meningitis, and they had 93 prior episodes recorded. The majority of patients with recurrent meningitis experienced two meningitis episodes, but we found 3 patients with 7, 11 and 40 recurrent episodes. Nineteen (50 %) patients in recurrent meningitis group and 90 (58 %) in non-recurrent group were men. Median age of patients with recurrent versus non-recurrent meningitis was 29 versus 57 years (p < 0.001). Nine (24 %) patients with recurrent meningitis versus 64 (41 %) patients with non-recurrent meningitis had an underlying immunosuppressive condition (p = 0.02, OR:0.41, 95 % CI:0.18-0.92). The immunosuppression was: diabetes mellitus in 32 (44 %), alcoholism in 19 (26 %), endstage liver disease in 7 (9.5 %) and malignancy, malnutrition, pregnancy, splenectomy and immunosuppressive therapy in 15 (20.5 %). We found dissemination of infection from a contiguous site in 74 (38 %) cases, bone defects and/or CSF leakage in 36 (18.5 %) cases and hematogenous spread in 14 (7.2 %) cases. A cranial bone discontinuity and/or CSF leakage were identified in recurrent versus non-recurrent meningitis in 21 (55 %) versus 15 (10 %) episodes (p < 0.001, OR:14.41, ). Hematogenous spread was observed only in the non-recurrent meningitis group. In recurrent versus nonrecurrent meningitis, impaired consciousness on admission was noted in 15 (40 %) versus 64 (41 %). We noted one death (2.6 %) among patients with recurrent PM group vs 42 (27 %) in the non-recurrent group (p<0.001, OR:0.07, 95 % CI:0.01-0.5). Death was associated with nonrecurrent meningitis (p < 0.001), contiguous spread (p = 0.014), immunodepression (p = 0.01) and impaired consciousness (p = 0.005). The study included 55 patients with a mean age of 57.9 years old and a sex ratio M:F = 1:1.75. The primary septic focus was found in 92.7 % of cases: respiratory (43.1 %), digestive (31.4 %), urinary (21.6 %), others (3.9 %). The most frequent isolated germs were E. coli (46.7 %), Streptococcus pneumoniae (20 %), Clostridium difficile (13.3 %), others including Klebsiella, Legionella, Neisseria meningitidis (20 %). 3.6 % of patients had septic metastases (cerebral or cutaneous) and 67.3 % presented at least one organ failure: hematological (57.3 %), renal (21.8 %), respiratory (5.5 %). The mean value of initial NLR was 17.7 and it was statistically significant correlated with the number of organ failures, with APACHE (p = 0.01) and APS (p = 0.01) scores and with the mortality rate (p = 0.01). This last correlation was stronger than the one between PCT with the mortality. VPM (mean value of 8.1 fl) and RDW (14.5) did not correlate with the two scores. PCT with a median of 14.58 ng/mL was correlated with APACHE (p = 0.02), APS (p = 0.05) and mortality rate (p = 0.05). Conclusions Septic patients' outcome can be easily appreciated using NLR, which proved an important prognostic role in sepsis through the statistically correlations with the severity scores and the estimated mortality rate. PCT also remains a good test to appreciate the severity. Although some studies showed the importance of VPM and RDW in sepsis, these markers weren't associated with the prognosis. Among 94 sonicated orthopedic implants we isolated 5 anaerobic bacteria (5.3 % prevalence). Propionibacterium acnes was isolated in 3 cases, on one clavicle plate and on one hip and one shoulder replacement. Parvimonas micra and Finegoldia magna were the other two anaerobes isolated from a hip and knee prosthesis. Patients from whom anaerobe bacteria were isolated were 3 males and 2 females with a median age of 48 years (45; 67). All the anaerobic infections were monobacterial. The median time between surgery and the onset of the symptoms was 12 months (5;30). All the isolated strains were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested except for metronidazole to which Propionibacterium acnes is resistant. The annual evolution of morbidity revealed a relatively constant number of cases in the period 2013-2015, with a significant increase in cases in 2016 (45.83 %) . The study included 14 children and 10 adults, sex ratio (F/M) 1.18 and a predominant urban origin of cases (15 urban/ 9 rural). Of the 24 patients, 21 showed signs of single respiratory manifestations (25 %) or in combination with skin manifestations (20.83 %), joints (12.5 %), liver (12.5 %) or neurological manifestations (45.83 %). Respiratory impairment was more common in adults (p = 0.007) and neurological impairment in children (p = 0.008) and in women (p = 0.05), with no difference by gender or age, referred to other extra pulmonary manifestations. MEP patients were admitted to hospital early (8 days versus 16 days). The average duration between the occurrence of respiratory and extrapulmonary events was a day for the joint, 4.6 days for neurological, 7 days for liver manifestations and 12.5 days for skin manifestations. MEP appearance was not favored by the patient's immune suppressed status (p = 0.807), previously administered antibiotic therapy before hospitalization (p = 0.632). Those with only pulmonary manifestations frequently received macrolides prior to hospitalization (p = 0.011) with no difference between the 2 groups with the administration of beta-lactams (p = 0.102). Leukocytosis was detected in a high proportion of those with MEP (p = 0.05), and we identified no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of the values of other inflammation tests, of liver cytolysis tests, pulmonary radiographic changes (p = 0.795) or the frequency of complications (p = 0.345). The average length of hospitalization was higher in patients with MEP (10.83 days versus nine days those without MEP). In the 60 months of study, 265 children met the clinical and biological criteria for severe bacterial sepsis; 68 % of the patients came from other hospitals, reason for which we consider that the etiology is most likely nosocomial pathogens. Sex distribution was approximately equal. Considering age distribution, children in the group 3-5 years of age prevailed; 49 of them were immunosuppressed; 10 patients had acquired immunosuppression, 20 congenital and 19 mixed. We obtained 163 hemoculture positive results (61 %) and 112 obtained by molecular methods. The data were correlated with conventional methods of diagnosis. Conclusions Bacterial sepsis in children is a serious condition resulting in 24 deaths (14 %) in our study. It requires quick etiologic diagnosis and establishment of appropriate emergency treatment. PCR is an effective and rapid diagnosis method, identifying the causal agent in 42 % of cases. Background Staphylococcus aureus is a common colonizing and infecting agent in humans [1] , with increased mortality in case of bacteremia. Case report A 60 year old man with a history of diabetes and hypertension was referred to our clinic with the suspicion of infective encephalitis. The onset of symptoms was 10 days prior to presentation with high fever, malaise, lower limb muscular weakness which progressed to paresthesia, rigidity and intense headache with bradypsychia and bradylalia. The patient denied using any recreational drugs, recent head trauma or any other open skin lesions. At admission he was febrile, bedridden, with generalized muscular atrophy, Janeway lesions, petechiae, 5 th right toe necrosis, left endophthalmitis, holosystolic murmur in the apex with radiation to the axilla, hepatomegaly, with no signs of meningeal irritation. The lab reports showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute inflammatory syndrome, positive procalcitonin, hyperglycemia with high glycated hemoglobin level, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia. Transthoracic echocardiography showed mobile mitral valve vegetation on the anterior leaflet, 10 mm in diameter, with normal ejection fraction. Two sets of blood cultures grew methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Chest X-ray showed peripheral, bilateral, lower lobe infiltrative densities. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed suggestive images for small abscesses in the supratentorial region. Given this data, the diagnosis of infective endocarditis with multiple septic emboli (pulmonary, ocular, cerebral) was established. Antibiotic therapy with linezolid and rifampin was initiated, due to a very good multiple organ penetration. As musculoskeletal secondary determination (septic arthritis, thigh abscess) and linezolid hematological side effects (anemia) occurred, we switched therapy to oxacillin, amikacin and levofloxacin. The patient had a good clinical response, with a total course of antibiotic therapy of 6 weeks. He was referred to a cardiovascular surgeon for further monitoring. Conclusions Patients suffering from uncontrolled diabetes have a higher risk of infections with endogenous microbes, with more severe outcomes. In our case, even if the MSSA strain isolated in hemocultures didn't represent a therapeutic challenge in terms of antibiotics options, it did develop into a severe and life threatening illness. This strain of MSSA possibly used all its energy in the synthesis of multiple virulence genes (adhesion, penetration, invasion) which determined numerous extra-cardiac complications of endocarditis. We identified five patients hospitalized for Streptococcus suis infectionfour patients had meningitis and one patient had endocarditis. Two patients reported contact with pork meat. In patients with meningitis the median age was 43 years (IQR 40-45), with a male: female ratio of 3:1. Three patients presented with altered level of consciousness and two with severe hearing impairment. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) examination showed changes characteristic for bacterial meningitis. Latex agglutination test for Streptococcus pneumoniae was positive in two patients, nonetheless, Streptococcus suis was isolated in CSF in all patients. They were all treated with a third generation cephalosporin for 14 days and all of them improved. Two patients developed sequelae, consisting in permanent sensorineural deafness and ataxia. In the studied period we identified a total of 194 cases of pneumococcal meningitis, in which the diagnosis was based on appearance on Gram stain and/or positive latex agglutination reaction of CSF samples in 82 (42 %) and positive culture in 112 (58 %) patients. The patient with endocarditis was a 40 year old male, who was admitted for fever and malaise. Echocardiography showed aortic valve endocarditis. The patient underwent treatment with a beta-lactam/betalactamase inhibitor and an aminoglycoside for 4 weeks, and after valve replacement with a glycopeptide for 4 weeks. We identified 18 strains of KP in 2010: 46.15 % resistant to aminopenicillin-betalactamase inhibitors association, 37.7 % resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam, 38.46 % resistant to third generation cephalosporins, 47.07 % resistant to fluoroquinolones, 41.17 % resistant to aminoglycosides. We didn't find any strains resistant to carbapenems. 38.88 % of the strains had combined resistance to fluoroquinolones, third generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides and 22.22 % were extended-spectrum betalactamases (ESBL) producing strains. In 2015, 37 strains of KP were isolated. The resistance rates to aminopenicillin-betalactamase inhibitors association, piperacillintazobactam, third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides were 36.11 %, 24.32 %, 29.72 %, 27.02 % and 21.62 %, respectively. One strain was resistant to carbapenems. 21.62 % of the strains had combined resistance and 29.73 % were ESBL. The overall resistance to aminopenicillin-betalactamase inhibitors association, piperacillin-tazobactam, third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, gentamycin, amikacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and the combined resistance decreased statistically non-significant. The same thing was noticed for the increasing rate of ESBL producing strains. During the study period, 1806 blood cultures were performed, and only 233 (12.9 %) were positive. Blood cultures were positive for S. aureus in 77 % of cases, Klebsiella pneumoniae in 8.1 % of cases and Escherichia coli in 4.5 % of cases. Distribution by age of blood culture positive for S. aureus were: under 1 year old -14.8 % of cases, 1-16 years old -17.3 % and over 16 years old -67.8 %. The blood cultures MRSA percentage was 45.5 % (82 out of 180 tested strains) with a peak in 2013 (28 strains) compared to 2015 (8 strains). The antibiotics resistance in S. aureus isolated strains was: to penicillin 83.9 %, to oxacillin 45.5 %, to clarithromycin 45.4 %, to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 31.6 %, to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 30.8 %, to ceftriaxone 24.5 %, to meropenem 19.3 %, to levofloxacin 18 %, to gentamicin 17.7 %, to chloramphenicol 11.9 %, to clindamycin 10.4 %, to vancomycin 7.78 %, to linezolid 4.9 %. The MRSA percentage was higher in infants (53.3 %) compared to adults (44.8 %), without statistically significant difference. Conclusions S. aureus was the most common etiologic agent isolated in blood cultures, with a high prevalence of methicillin-resistant strains (45.5 %). From the tested antibiotics, the lowest resistance was observed at linezolid and vancomycin. Clindamycin, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones were active against strains of MRSA without antibiotics multiresistance. Background β-lactamases production remains the most important mechanism of β-lactam resistance. The most prevalent extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) in hospital and community settings that preferentially hydrolyze cefotaxime, belong to plasmid-mediated ESBL, is CTX-M. Our objective was to study bacterial resistance to improve the diagnosis and treatment of infections with these pathogens. Methods Fifty-nine strains (isolated from urine and several from blood) were collected between June 23 rd and September 23 rd 2011 from two hospitals of Quebec City in Canada. Strains were sent to the Research Center of Infectious Diseases of Laval University in Quebec City. Identification and antibiotic resistance were determined using the Vitek® 2 System (bioMérieux). ESBL production was tested according to CLSI recommendations. Crude DNA extracts were prepared from each strain by a rapid DNA extraction method. DNA was used for PCR amplification using different primers specific to bla TEM , bla SHV , and bla CTX-M genes. All amplicons produced were sequenced, to identify the genes of resistance. From 59 strains tested, 32 (54.2 %) were ESBL+, and 28 (45.8 %) were ESBL-. Escherichia coli was the most prevalent species with a percentage of 88.1 % of the strains tested. The 32 ESBL producing-strains were positive for at least one of the resistance genes tested. The predominant resistance gene was bla CTX-M either alone or in combination with the bla TEM gene, all present in E. coli. Sequence analysis of the 28 bla CTX-M genes found revealed that 18 strains were members of CTX-M group 1, and 10 were members of CTX-M group 9. Two different resistance genes were identified in 15 strains: bla CTX-M + bla TEM (13) and bla SHV + bla TEM (2) . However, sequence data revealed that all bla TEM genes identified in both ESBL+ and ESBL strains did not encode ESBL. This suggests that the resistance phenotype in ESBL-producing strains with two resistance genes should be conferred by bla CTX-M or bla SHV genes. Another resistance gene, not tested in this study, is most likely responsible for the ESBL resistance phenotype in the strain containing only the bla TEM -non-ESBL gene. This pilot study included the following types of infections: recurrent endocarditis with Staphylococcus aureus, chronic osteomyelitis with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, periprosthetic dorsolumbar soft-tissue infection with S. aureus, chronic cutaneous infection with S. simulans, E. coli and P. aeruginosa, axillary hidradenitis with Proteus mirabilis and S. epidermidis and chronic osteomyelitis with S. aureus. For all six cases the combined therapy proved to be safe, with no adverse reactions and no adverse changes in laboratory parameters. A total of 5 patients had negative cultures during therapy, but 7 days after the end of therapy the cultures became positive again for 3 of the cases. For one patient (recurrent endocarditis with S. aureus) we concluded that the timespan between relapses was longer after receiving the combined therapy compared with antimicrobial treatment alone. In one case (periprosthetic dorsolumbar soft-tissue infection with S. aureus) we achieved sustained bacteriological response, although the patient was considered hard-to-treat due to a history of multiple drug allergy syndrome, presence of multiple foreign bodies (metallic rods and screws), with biofilm formation and a history of unsuccessful long term antibiotic therapy. The percentage of carbapenem-resistance in Escherichia coli was low in the past four years, 0 (2012) -2.1 % (2015) in the past four years, but several resistant isolates represent an alert for the risk of community acquired infections due to XDR strains. For other Gram-negative bacteria the carbapenem-resistance is already high or rapidly emerging: Background Healthcare-associated meningitis or ventriculitis is a serious and life-threatening complication of invasive neurosurgical procedures or penetrating head trauma. The reviewed cases involved 78 adult patients. The age of the patients was between 18 and 89, with a higher frequency in the age group 60-80. Healthcare-associated bacterial meningitis may occur after neurosurgical procedures, head trauma, placement of internal or external ventricular catheters, ENT and maxillofacial surgery. From 78 cases, in 42 there was a positive cerebrospinal fluid culture. The most frequent agents are Gram negative bacilli (Pseudomonas spp, Acinetobacter spp, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and Gram positive cocci (Staphylococcus aureuswith a particular focus on MRSA, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniae). At the admission in the clinic the signs and symptoms were: fever, headache, changes in mental status (Glasgow Coma scale 3-12), nausea/vomiting, focal neurologic deficit, neck stiffness, seizures and photophobia. The diagnostic evaluation involved neuroimaging investigation (CT/MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. Empiric antimicrobial therapy should be directed towards the likely infecting pathogen. The complications involved were brain abscess, ventriculitis, cranial nerve damage, deafness and blindness. The outcome was negative in 38 % of cases and positive in 62 % (with disability in 30 patients and without disability in 32 patients). In our Institutespecialized in diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseasesnosocomial infections in different stages of evolution are part of our current pathology. Based on this argument, in our ICU from January to July 2016, there were 13 cases considered "imported" nosocomial infectionsfailure of previous treatmentsand 1 case was declared "novel" nosocomial infectionventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) with A. baumannii in an immunocompromised patient with end stage AIDS/HIV infection. Unfortunately, his evolution was continually unfavorable with subsequent death. Ten patients with "imported" nosocomial infections had favorable evolutions, and were discharged in good conditions. The 2 others died as a result of VAP with MRSA and VAP with P. aeruginosa respectively. We included 124 patients of which 56 were males. The mean age was 51.7 ± 23.4 years. Two patients with liver transplant and a patient with HCV genotype 1a received 24 weeks of treatment. Two patients did not receive ribavirin: one with minor thalassemia, one with polyarthritis. We included 2 patients with diabetic nephropathy with end stage renal disease (ESRD), one undergoing hemodialysis. 58 patients have reached the end of treatment (one patient with liver transplant); 57 of them had undetectable viremia; one had viremia <15 IU/mL. 15 patients have been evaluated at 12 weeks after EOT; they all had undetectable viremia at EOT, and had sustained virologic response. Ribavirin was discontinued in 7 patients -2 due to severe cutaneous reactions -erythroderma. Both patients with ESRD discontinued ribavirin after week 2 due to severe anemia. One patient with systemic lupus stopped ribavirin at week 2 due to hypotension. A patient with thalassemia presented duodenal hematoma with pancreatic reaction in the first week, with improvement under medical therapy and discontinuation of ribavirin, with undetectable viremia at EOT. Ribavirin doses were decreased at week 4 in a patient with variceal bleeding, and stopped at week 8 due to severe anemia. These patients also had virologic response at EOT. Another patient presented with hepatocellular carcinoma in week 2; he underwent transarterial chemoembolization in week 8, with decompensation by ascites, ultimately with good evolution, undetectable viremia at EOT and complete response of the nodule. The mean initial levels of transaminases were double the normal values; they decreased dramatically after the first two weeks of treatment and low levels were maintained throughout therapy. The mean initial bilirubin level was normal, with values increasing during the first month: 1.4 mg/dL at week 2 and 2.84 mg/dL at week 4. Afterwards there was a small constant decrease and normalization after EOT. Clinical manifestations were scanty in both groups: right hypochondriac pain in 44.4 % of cases in Group I, and 36.4 %in Group II, weakness or fatigue -22.2 % in Group I, 9.1 %in Group II. At the end of treatment no clinical manifestations were present. Complete blood count, leukocyte count remained in the normal range with nonsignificant evolution. Lymphocyte count trended to increase within the normal range. Platelet count did not change significantly. Biochemistry tests: positive evolution of both total and direct bilirubin levels with their normalization in both groups was observed. ALT, AST and GGT were increased in all patients of both groups. In Group II, the average values of these parameters tended to reduce. In patients of Group I, the reduction was more significant than in those of Group II. Molecular biology assays. The HCV RNA level decreased from 442,843,736 IU/mL to 288,801,564 IU/mL, but did not become negative. The HBV DNA level reduced on average by 50 % (at the beginning of treatment -4,729,167 IU/mL, and 1,833,933 IU/mLat the end of treatment), and in 4 patients HBV DNA was not detected. Eighty-seven patients with HCV compensated cirrhosis are treated in our department with OPrD-ribavirin regimen. Three patients discontinued the antiviral therapy, two of them because of liver decompensation. After one month of therapy, 20 patients had total bilirubin more than 2 mg/dL and 7 of them had total bilirubin more than 4 mg/dL (the maxim value was 21 mg/dL). In the same time, these patients developed anemia and 16 of them permanently discontinued ribavirin. Five patients had high value of bilirubin (more than 10 mg/ dL): one patient with predominance of unconjugated bilirubin and severe anemia (with hemolytic mechanism with recovery after ribavirin discontinuation and 2 patients with liver decompensation (with discontinuation of DAA regimen). Three of these patients did not develop liver decompensation and a slow recovery after discontinuation of ribavirin was observed. The risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia were analyzed and two of them were highly correlated with this side effect: Child-Pugh score at baseline 6 (RR 8 (4.48; 14.28) with p < 0.0000001) and baseline level of platelet count less than 100000/cmm (RR 5.36 (1.973; 14 .56) with p < 0.0001). Until now 88 of our patients received approval for OPrD therapy, 87 for compensated cirrhosis and one with F3 fibrosis and severe depression. A patient experienced liver decompensation during the third month of therapy, when cholangiocarcinoma was diagnosed, and died 2 weeks later. Our patients are in different stages of therapy: 37 patients at the end of follow-up (EF) -42.52 %, 30 patients at the end of therapy (EOT) -34.48 %, 5 patients during the third month of therapy -5.74 %, 10 patients during the second month of therapy -11.49 % and 5 patients during the first month. From the 27 patients whose viral load has been analysed after 4 weeks of therapy, 24 registered undetectability (88.88 %) and 2 patients had a viral load under the low limit of quantification. 66 patients finished the therapy and all had undetectable viral load. 38 patients finished the 12 weeks monitoring period and all of them registered sustained virologic response. Two patients prematurely discontinued antiviral therapy due to liver decompensation and cardiac disorders. From 53 patients with abnormal ALT at baseline, 32 (60.37 %) had normal ALT after 2 weeks of therapy and 50 (94.33 %) patients had normal ALT after 4 weeks of therapy. Between November 2015 and July 2016, 87 patients received approval for OPrD and ribavirin therapy for HCV compensated cirrhosis, 86 for genotype 1b and one patient with genotype 1 with undetermined subtype. Some of our patients had contraindications for ribavirin usage (chronic anemia -2 patients) and we also have patients with prematurely discontinuation of ribavirin. 85 patients started ribavirin, but after one month of antiviral therapy, the ribavirin was discontinued for 16 patients (18.82 %) and for 23 (27.05 %) patients the dose was reduced. The most important reason for ribavirin discontinuation and dose reduction was severe anemia but we also have patients with moderate or mild anemia but with severe jaundice (7 patients with total bilirubin more than 4 mg/dLamong them, 5 patients had bilirubin more than 10 mg/dL). After two more months of therapy, other 7 patients discontinued ribavirin. Out of 81 patients who received at least 2 months of therapy, 23 patients discontinued ribavirin (28.39 %) and for 20 patients the ribavirin dose was reduced (24.69 %). Only 38 patients received full dosage of ribavirin for at least two months. Despite the ribavirin dose reduction or discontinuation all the patients who completed 12 weeks of therapy achieved undetectable viral load and all patients who completed the follow-up period achieved sustained virologic response. Eighty seven Child A cirrhotic patients were treated in our Department: 70 patients had 5 points at Child score (80.45 %) and 17 patients 6 points (19.55 %). Five patients (5.74 %) developed liver decompensation during antiviral therapy. Two patients permanently discontinued antiviral therapy: one after 23 days of therapy − because after the discontinuation of ribavirin and supportive therapy the outcome wasn't good and the second one was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma after 9 weeks of therapy. Two patients with liver decompensation had a good outcome after cessation of ribavirin and supportive therapy. They had completed the therapy with OPrD and achieved SVR12. One patient is still in hospital under strict monitoring; ribavirin was stopped but OPrD regimen was not yet discontinued. The mean age was 63 year-old, 3 male and 2 female, 3 naive patients and 2 previously treated with null response. All the patients had Child score 6. All the patients had at baseline: abnormal INR (but less than 1.7the limit accepted by Child Pugh score), platelet count under 100000/cmm, mild increase of total bilirubin (between 2 and 3 mg/dL for 4 patients and below 2 mg/dL for one patient) and albumin below 3.5 g/dL in one patient. Four patients had esophageal varices at baseline and all patients had an increased spleen diameter. A total of 87 patients were followed, with a median age of 63 years (IQR 54-70 years) and 47 % males. 36 patients (41.4 %) reported at least one clinical adverse event. The most common were fatigue (26.4 %), pruritus (13.8 %), dizziness (8 %), sleeping disorders (6.9 %), nausea and/or vomiting (6.9 %), muscle and/or bone pain (4.6 %), headache (3.4 %), diarrhoea (3.4 %) and skin rash (2.3 %) . The main laboratory abnormalities were anemia (44.8 %) and hyperbilirubinemia (23 %). After the first month of treatment, 20 patients (23 %) developed mild anemia (hemoglobin level 11-12 g/dL) and 19 (21.8 %) developed moderate anemia (hemoglobin level < 11 g/dL). A total bilirubin level > 2 mg/dL after one month of therapy was observed in 20 patients (23 %) and for 16 (18.4 %) of them ribavirin was discontinued. Three patients discontinued treatment, two of them because of liver decompensation. In 2015-2016, three patients known with chronic HBV were admitted in our department for jaundice and ALT increase. The first case is a young woman, pregnant in 24 weeks, under ETV for 4 years, with negative HBeAg and undetectable VL, who decided to stop therapy when she discovered the pregnancy. Six months later she was admitted in our clinic for important hepatocytolysis. The biological exams revealed: ALT > 20 x upper limit of normal (ULN), positive HBeAg, HBV VL of 9 log IU/mL, normal prothrombin concentration and mild hyperbilirubinemia. The patient received off label lamivudine with slow decrease of ALT and VL of 2 log IU/mL at delivery. ETV therapy was reintroduced after delivery, with favorable outcome. The second case is a young man who discontinued ETV because he lost his medical insurance. During antiviral therapy he had normal ALT and undetectable VL. Five months later, he presented ALT 5xULN, jaundice and high VL. The patient renewed his insurance and ETV was reinitiated, with good outcome. The last patient, a 28 yearold man is still hospitalized. He was under ETV for 6 years with good biological outcome, after a previous therapy with peginterferon. In January 2016, he stopped ETV by himself and in August he was admitted in our clinic for jaundice and vomiting. The tests showed ALT 60xULN, hyperbilirubinemia (16 mg/dL), positive HBeAg and decrease of prothrombin concentration and fibrinogen. The therapy with tenofovir was immediately started and after 5 days, the prothrombin concentration became normal, but ALT and bilirubin remained increased. Conclusions NAs therapy must be continued until HBs seroconversion, even in patients who achieved undetectable VL. The risk of severe liver decompensation especially in young people is extremely high. In women with childbearing potential, ETV can be switched with tenofovir and the therapy must be continued during the entire pregnancy. Consent Written informed consent was obtained from the patients for publication of this Case report and any accompanying images. A copy of the written consent is available for review by the Editor of this journal. Eighty-seven patients with HCV compensated cirrhosis were treated in our department. The mean age was 61.93 years old and sex ratio F:M = 1.12:1. After one month of therapy, 19 patients (21.83 %) developed moderate anemia with hemoglobin below 11 g/dL (between 7.8 g/dL and 10.8 g/dL, with a medium value of 9.8 g/dL). Sixteen of these patients permanently discontinued ribavirin during first month of antiviral therapy and two patients permanently discontinued all therapeutic regimen: one patient for severe cardiac disturbances and the other for liver decompensation with important jaundice. For other 3 patients the dosage of ribavirin was reduced. For 20 patients, hemoglobin level after first month of therapy was between 11 and 12 g/dL (mild anemia -22.98 %) and because of severe fatigue, the dosage of ribavirin was reduced. After 2 months of therapy from 81 patients who reached this endpoint, other 7 patients permanently discontinued ribavirin due to moderate anemia (below 11 g/dL). 37/67 (55.22 %) of patients who completed the therapy had anemia despite the reduction or discontinuation of ribavirin. 37 patients finished the monitoring therapy (SVR12) and all the patients who developed anemia had normal level of hemoglobin. Regarding thrombocytopenia, it was improved during antiviral therapy. The analysis was performed for 67 patients who finished the therapy. At baseline, 13 patients had severe thrombocytopenia (19.40 %) and 38 patients had platelet count more than 150000/cmm. At the end of treatment, 6 patients remained with severe thrombocytopenia (8.9 %) and 53 patients had platelet count more than 150000/cmm (79.1 %). The statistical analysis showed significant increases of platelet count. The study included 371 participants (77 in the study group and 294 in the control group). The median age of the study group was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 24, 26.5 years), and 23 years (IQR: 22, 24 years) in the control group. The male-to-female ratio was 0.9:1 in the study group vs. 1:1 in the control group. The following risk factors for HBV or HCV transmission were significantly more prevalent in the study group: blood transfusion or organ transplantation after 1992 (p = 0.029), history of coagulopathy (p = 0.048), injected drug use (p = 0.048), having lived with someone with hepatitis B (p = 0.005), history of travel to countries with high HBV risk (p < 0.001), never having undergone screening for hepatitis (p < 0.001) or HIV (p < 0.001), history of unprotected oral (p = 0.004) or vaginal (p = 0.004) intercourse with more than one partner in the last year, occupational exposure to HIV/hepatitis (p < 0.001 each), tattoos or piercing (p < 0.001). However, the study group also presented positive health-related behaviors, such as: history of vaccination against hepatitis A (p < 0/001) or hepatitis B (p = 0.001), a previous negative result upon screening for hepatitis (p < 0.001) or HIV (p < 0.001). We enrolled 30 HCV-infected patients: 8 (26.7 %) males and 22 (73.3 %) females, with mean age 66 ± 9.44 years. Most cases (83.3 %) had non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), 10 % chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 3.3 % Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and 3.3 % Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM). Based on histologic features the HM indolent subtype was predominant (53.3 %) versus aggressive subtype (46.7 %). Advanced fibrosis (stage F3-F4) was present in 68.2 % of patients and 31.8 % had moderate or severe necroinflammatory activity. Nine patients (30 %) had high HCV-RNA viral loads (>600 000 IU/mL) at baseline. HCV-R was present in 30 % of cases, after a mean of 4 months (range: 3-12 months) from enrolling. A hepatic flare was associated only in 3 of these cases. Three (10 %) patients died, one due to HCV associated fulminant hepatitis and two due to HM complications.The median HCV viral load at baseline was 507525.00 IU/mL (IQR = 3074957 IU/mL) in HCV-R patients versus 471129.00 IU/mL (IQR = 1562720 IU/mL) in patients without HCV-R. Neither sex (p = 0.23), age (p = 0.13), HCV-RNA levels at baseline (p = 1), presence of fibrosis (p = 1), necroinflammatory activity or HM type significantly influenced the risk of HCV-R. All patients showed a constant evolution of IFN ɣ levels with a moderate increase of IFN γ from 59 to 200 pg/mL during the first 6 months of treatment. Interestingly, all patients with a recent infection (<1 year) showed much higher pre-therapy serum levels of IFN γ (984-1282 pg/mL) than those with a more distant infection (IFN ɣ serum levels 120-171 pg/mL). Conclusions HCV patients with a sustained response to peg interferonα/ribavirin therapy display constant levels of IFN γ during the first 6 months of treatment. The level of IFN γ in recent HCV infections was much higher compared with more distant infections. The pre-therapy level of serum IFN ɣ did not influence the virologic outcome to the standard interferon α therapy. Background Risk-reduction campaigns are essential parts of national health programs. To better select the population groups to target, we have undergone an assessment of specific risk factors for transmission of HBV, HCV and HIV infection in Romania. We analyzed a significant sample from the general population in Romania, with a median (interquartile range) age of 46 (36, 57) years and a male to female ratio of 0.6:1. We identified a higher prevalence of risk factors in the male population, namely a history of sexuallytransmitted infections (STIs -OR: 3.4, CI 95 %: 1.3, 10.0), piercing/tattoos (OR: 1.9 CI95 %: 1.4, 2.6), unprotected anal (OR: 2,6, CI95 %: 1.1, 6.0), vaginal (OR: 2.2, CI95 %: 1.5, 3.3) and oral (OR: 5.5, CI95 %: 2.9, 10.2) intercourse but not homosexual intercourse (p = 0.524), multiple sex partners (p = 0.403), injecting drug use (IDUp = 0.205), or needle sharing (p = 0.613). The prevalence of IDU was significantly higher in patients who also had a history of STIs (OR: 372, CI95 %: 64, 2180), and the same was true for needle sharing (OR: 124, CI95 %: 26, 598). Similarly, piercings/tattoos were significantly associated with IDU (OR: 69, CI95 %: 14, 346), needle sharing (OR: 16, CI95 %: 4.5, 56.8), all types of unprotected intercourse: homosexual (OR: 10, CI95 %: 4.7, 21.2), oral (OR: 34, CI95 %: 19, 61), vaginal (OR:13, CI95 %: 8, 23), or anal (OR: 25, CI95 %: 10, 64), and multiple sex partners during the past 6 months (OR: 10, CI95 %: 7, 14). We present the results for 87 patients, with a male-to-female ratio of 0.9:1, a median (interquartile range -IQR) age of 58 (49.5, 64.5) years and a mean ± standard deviation duration of HCV evolution of 9.2 ± 4.9 years. Follow-up data is currently available for 60/87 patients (69 %) and all achieved sustained virological response. The median (IQR) liver stiffness at baseline was 13.9 (12.6, 19.2) kPa and it decreased significantly to 10.7 (7.8, 15.1) kPa at 12 weeks post-treatment (p = 0.002, Z = −3.146). The median decrease in liver stiffness was −1.8 (−3.1, −0.2) kPa over an interval of 24 weeks, and it was correlated with shorter evolution of HCV infection prior to starting treatment (rs = 0.346, p = 0.023). Out of 21 patients with chronic HCV, 18 were naive and 3 pre-treated with peg-IFN and ribavirin. 13 (62%) were men and 8 (38%) women with ages between 21 and 58 years. Most patients had a poor clinical picture like fatigue, right upper quadrant pain. 14 (66.6%) patients had moderate level of hepatic cytolysis (ALT average 188 U/L), bilirubin was within normal limits. HCV RNA detected prior to treatment ranged from 290.000 to 24 million copies/mL (average 3.8 million copies/mL). Degree of fibrosis -F0 was established in 2 patients, F1 -in 3, F2 -in 12 and F3 -in 4 patients. No adverse events occurred in any patient during treatment with SOF/DCV. At 4 weeks of antiviral therapy 20 (95.2%) showed undetectable viremia HCV-RNA, only one patient decreased from 8 million to 500.000 copies/mL. All 21 (100%) patients achieved ALT normal limits. At 12 weeks of treatment all 21 patients experienced virologic response (HCV RNA -undetectable). At 24 weeks after starting of treatment 13 (62%) patients had SVR (HCV RNA -undetectable). 8 patients are on the point of completing treatment with dynamic supervision to 24 weeks. The study was carried out on a number of 51 HIV positive patients, out of which 45 pregnant women eventually gave birth and 6 had second trimester spontaneous abortion (patients with deliberate pregnancy). Out of the patients who delivered (42 by Caesarian section and 3 by vaginal birth) 6 cases were diagnosed with thrombophilia (2 cases with antiphospholipid syndrome and 4 cases with congenital thrombophilia). The thrombophilia diagnosis was established in 5 of the cases with spontaneous abortion with repetition in the second pregnancy trimester. In all cases the treatment with low molecular weight heparine was initiated. Four PML pathologic diagnoses were issued, three of them as confirmation to their respective three clinical suppositions and one without a corresponding clinical diagnosis. PML was also suspected in a patient that lacked relevant pathologic evidence for its confirmation. However, the patient proved to be suffering from cerebral cryptococcosis. In the case of two patients, PML was the sole pathologic diagnosis, whereas the rest of them exhibited PML accompanied by HIV encephalopathy. There were also three clinical diagnoses that were speculated, alongside PML, all of them being refuted by the postmortem examination: cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral toxoplasmosis and lymphoma. Four HIVE pathologic diagnoses were issued, with no correlation with the clinical suppositions inferred in regard to the concerned patients. These pathological diagnoses were associated with ischemic stroke, PML, cerebral hemorrhage, lymphoma or toxoplasmosis. HIVE was clinically suspected in six patients, but all of them were proved to be affected by other disorders, such as meningoencephalithis, hyperemia and cerebral edema, PML or pons/cerebellar decrepitude. In all, there were no confirmed cases of HIV encephalopathy. During the 4 year monitoring period, the following results of HIV time of detection in IDU/HIV mothers were obtained: 40 % (25/62 mothers tested) were found with HIV before pregnancy, 11.2 % (7/62) during pregnancy, 41 % (26/62) during delivery and 6.4 % (4/62) in the first 24 hours after birth. Although all newborns perinatally exposed to HIV/IDU benefitted from post-partum prophylaxis and received artificial nutrition, 14.5 % (9/62) exposed to drug use were HIV infected. All children had poor neonatal adaption, mainly a severe withdrawal syndrome -57 % (40/62) of newborns monitored and more than 50 % had neurological lesions. The mean level of serum LL37 in all HCV patients was lower than controls 48.75 (±19.02) ng/mL versus 80.98 (±82.78) ng/mL but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.435). The mean value of IFNɣ was also only numerically higher in HCV infected patients 604.94 (±1532.17) pg/mL than controls 235 (±131.77) pg/mL, p = 0.6. The level of LL37 exhibited a moderate positive correlation with IFN ɣ (r = 0.571) as well as a mild positive correlation between LL37 and ALT (r = 0.404). No statistically significant correlations of LL37 serum concentrations were found when compared with other biological parameters and virologic response. Antiganglioside autoantibodies identified in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients and in the control group exhibit different serologic profiles. In HIV infected patients the prevalence of autoantibodies of IgM type against gangliosides was as follows: 28.12 % anti-GM1, 6.25 % anti-GM2, 9.37 % anti-GM3, 6.25 % anti-GD1a, 3.12 % anti-GD1b, 0 % anti-GT1b, 3.12 % anti-GQ1b. In the control group antiganglioside antibodies of IgM type were absent. Measles is highly contagious and can occur anytime, but that can be prevented by vaccination. It is to be emphasized that in just three months of 2016 (May-July) 31 cases of measles were counted in our hospital. The most affected age group in 2016 was between 1 to 3 years, which represents 48.3 % of all cases. In the latest years much more atypical forms of measles have been recorded, some of them severe, predominantly with pulmonary complications, even children with interstitial lung disease. In 30 countries from Europe, measles cases didn't occur in 2014. Likewise in Romania, Timiș county, measles wasn't present in 2008/2009 and 2013/2014. Conclusions This is a disease which can be prevented by following the vaccination programs. The pathogenesis of influenza includes an impairment of pulmonary defenses which is said to "open the gates" for bacterial superinfection, and Streptococcus pneumoniae is one the leading pathogens of superinfection, particularly in children without history of anti-pneumococcal vaccination. The study included 206 cases of influenza, occurring in children with a median (interquartile range) age of 4.2 (2.5, 6.5) years. The influenza season started late December and lasted until late May, with A viruses being predominant (92.4 %). Complicated influenza was diagnosed in 73.9 % of the cases, and this was also the main presenting complaint. Complications included: myositis (24 %), encephalitis (3.9 %), other central nervous system complications (2.8 %), viral pneumonia (61 %), bacterial superinfection pneumonia (6.7 %), acute otitis media (6.1 %). Eight (3.9 %) patients with influenza presented positive nasal cultures and one other case (0.5 %) presented acute pneumococcal otitis media, identified after a median (IQR) duration of influenza illness of 6 (4, 7) days. In patients with influenza plus pneumococcal colonization the number of complications was significantly higher (median 2 vs. 1, p = 0.037, U = 416). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was a good indicator of pneumococcal presence (median 26 vs. 16 mm/h, p = 0.038, U = 197), as opposed to fibrinogen (median 281 vs. 266 mg/dL, p = 0.466, U = 545.5) or C-reactive protein (median 4.2 vs. 3.2 mg/L, p = 0.589, U = 603). Importantly, the duration of hospital admission was significantly longer (median 6.5 vs. 5 days, p = 0.026, U = 424.5) in cases with concomitant pneumococcal colonization. The simplest forms of enterovirus infections registered were cases of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, that only required hospital management secondary to dehydration or to associated gastroenteritis; the registered number of HFMD exceeded 170 cases, representing over 80 % from enteroviruses induced infections. There was no record of secondary myocarditis, but an overwhelming number of acute viral meningoencephalitis cases (24) were reported, some of them undergoing severe forms of the meningoencephalitis syndrome, complicated by convulsive status, plegias and/or important motor deficits. The epidemic peak was reached during the mid-summer season (June-July) when the integrated pediatric intensive care (PIC) department managed 20 out of the 24 registered cases of the 2016 season. Important central nervous system involvement, with magnetic resonance imaging documented lesions, was present in 5 patients, but no fatal cases were registered. There were 21 subjects enrolled with median age of 50.6 years old. 57.14 % were male, 100 % Caucasian. High-risk conditions were present in 34 %. The majority of influenza viruses of the patients in the case study matched the strains present in the seasonal vaccine, but none of the patients had been vaccinated. The demographical spectrum impressed through diversity. The mortality rate was 31.8 % taking into account that influenza might have triggered latent disorders or exacerbated chronic afflictions and put the patients at risk of acquiring bacterial superinfections. The data strongly implicate A H1N1 influenza virus infection combined with bacterial superinfection as the primary cause of mortality during the A H1N1 influenza outbreak. Bacterial reinfection with unique or mixed germs, type MDR, PDR, both cocci (MRSA pneumonia E. faecium) and Gram negative bacilli (A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, E. coli) and fungi (C. albicans, C. non albicans: glabrata, kefir) detected in both carriage and pathological products or on the surface of catheters or probes, were the targets of antimicrobial therapy (AB latest dose and multiple association and supportive therapy ± antifungal therapy appropriate to the stage of sepsis + antiviral therapy -oseltamivir) initiated early and individualized casework. Advanced support of vital functions and physiopathogenic supportive therapy with intensive nursing formed the basis of therapeutic complex behavior. The death of the 8 patients was carefully analyzed from a bacteriological standpoint: 5 cases died of severe sepsis or septic complications caused by pneumococcus, K. pneumoniae, P C, A. baumannii + A. fumigatus, MRSA and 3 cases, admitted in extreme status of serious critical conditions, unstable condition, in septic shock and MSOF had unidentified etiology and death between 3-9 days after admission. The total number of laboratory confirmed influenza cases was 359, of which 334 were Type A subtype H1N1, 13 type A, negative subtype H1N1, 8 type A, 1 type A subtype H3, 3 type B. Hospitalization was necessary for 74 patients with SARI (45 females and 29 males), belonging to different age groups (2-4 years -1, 15-49 years -21, 50-64 -36, over 65 -16) , backgrounds of different origin (urban 52, rural 22) with comorbidities (cardiovascular 38, bronchopulmonary 12, diabetes 4 cases, other 44, pregnancy 3, obesity 37), with history of travel abroad (Bulgaria, Libya) -2 cases, previous contact with a person with confirmed influenza -1 person, and only 4 persons with a history of influenza vaccination. Sixty-six patients had clinical signs of pneumonia. There were medical complications like acute respiratory failure -15 cases and secondary bacterial infection (pneumonia) -56 cases. 68 patients received antibiotic therapy, 38 patients received oxygen. All survived. No patient was mechanically ventilated. Serum levels of IL-6 were significantly higher in patients with viral infections (31.2 ± 7.3 pg/mL p < 0.05), malignant melanoma (19.3 ± 6.8 pg/mL, p < 0.05) and malignant melanoma associated with viral infections (37.9 ± 11.5 pg/mL, p < 0.05) than in the control group (2.11 ± 0.85 pg/mL). Compared to controls (74.23 ± 2.17 ng/mL), serum levels of sIL-6R were moderately elevated in patients with viral infections (114.1 ± 33.6 ng/mL, p <0.05), malignant melanoma (96.3 ± 31.4 ng/mL, p > 0.05), and malignant melanoma associated with viral infections (127.1 ± 43.1 ng/mL, p < 0.05). Significant variations were also obtained for sgp 130, as follows: 281.4 ± 19.4 ng/mL in the control group, 309.8 ± 22.4 ng/mL, p > 0.05 in patients with viral infections, 363.8 ± 43.8 ng/mL, p < 0.05 in patients with malignant melanoma, 331.3 ± 29.5 ng/mL, p = 0.05 in patients with malignant melanoma associated with viral infections. Conclusions IL-6 is secreted in response to viral infections and malignant transformation. The sIL-6R subunit is overexpressed in viral infections. Soluble glycoprotein 130 is synthesized in small amounts in the studied viral infections. Therefore IL-6 may be involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses of the human body through many mechanisms. In viral infections IL-6 trans signaling pathway is overexpressed. Knowledge of intracellular signaling mechanisms of IL-6 has important consequences on the therapeutic strategies which are aimed at blocking the activity of this cytokine.  Subjectively patients described signs such as weakness, fatigue, effort pain. Objectively we have detected the presence of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. After 2 years of persistence of HBsAg in 3 patients vascular stars were present, which were later shown as signs of chronic active hepatitis. We have followed the dynamics of viral markers, evolving pursued hepatodepressive syndrome, syndrome retention cytolysis and inflammatory dysproteinemia. Humoral changes present in HBsAg persistent hepatitis are generally encountered in the acute phase (but with different intensity), plus they develop or intensify the inflammatory syndrome. In cases with persistent HBsAg the dynamic development of humoral syndromes is categorically different compared to the evolution of hepatitis with the same syndromes in cases of acute infection evolving with HBsAg negativity. We have assessed 120 pregnant female patients, with a median (interquartile range) age of 30 (26.3, 33) years and a median (interquartile range) duration of pregnancy of 30 (26.5, 33) weeks at the time the smear and culture tests were performed. Roughly half (58, 48.3 %) of the patients presented the normal Gram-positive tinctorial predominance on vaginal smears while 39 (32.5 %) presented apparently pathogenic Gram-negative flora, although only 2 of the vaginal discharge cultures (1.7 %) grew Gram-negative bacilli, namely E. coli. Another 17 (14.2 %) vaginal cultures were positive for yeasts, and all were negative for S. aureus, Klebsiella spp., and Trichomonas vaginalis. Among cervical cultures, 11 (9.2 %) grew E. coli (including the two cases that also had positive vaginal cultures for E. coli), 2 (1.7 %) grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12 (10 %) grew yeasts, 1 (0.8 %) grew Enterococcus spp. and none were positive for S. aureus or Trichomonas vaginalis. Of the 11 identified E. coli strains, almost half (n = 5) were resistant to ampicillin, 2 were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and all were susceptible to cephalosporins, carbapenems, and co-trimoxazole. Klebsiella strains were positive for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and were significantly more frequent at lower gestational ages (p = 0.023, Z = −2.152), while fungal growth from cervical cultures was significantly associated with younger maternal ages (p = 0.040, Z = −2.056). We studied 120 pregnant women with a median (IQR) gestational age of 30 (26.5, 33) weeks. The patient sample was representative for Southern Romania: 82 (68.3 %) from urban areas, 79 (65.8 %) from the Bucharest-Ilfov area, 32 (26.7 %) Southern, 5 (4.2 %) South-Eastern and 2 (1.7 %) from the South-Western area of Romania, while two patients were from Ukraine and Moldova. One-fourth of the patients (32, 26.7 %) had previous obstetrical medical history: uterine scarring (n = 24, 75 %), uterine fibroids (n = 2, 6.3 %), history of preeclampsia (n = 2, 6.3 %), and cervical scarring, septate uterus, history of placenta praevia, or history of intrauterine death (n = 1, 3.1 % each). None of the vaginal cultures yielded GBS while 7 (5.8 %) of the cervical cultures grew GBS. The patients did not consent to intra-rectal cultures, therefore the real prevalence of GBS colonization may be somewhat underestimated. The mean age ± SD of patients with positive GBS cultures was 30.03 ± 6.4 years; cultures were collected at a median gestational age of 38.5 ± 1.6 weeks. Urine cultures were performed in all but one case of GBS colonization and only one of them yielded asymptomatic GBS bacteriuria requiring treatment during pregnancy along with standard intra-partum antimicrobial prophylaxis for GBS colonization. The prevalence of GBS colonization was slightly higher in patients from urban areas (6/82, 7.3 % vs. 1/36, 2.8 %) but the difference failed to reach statistical significance, probably due to the small number of overall positive cultures (p = 0.674, χ(1) = 0.924). The prevalence of GBS was not influenced by obstetrical history (p = 0.187, χ(1) = 2.703), patient age (p = 0.951, Z = 0.062), or gestational age (p = 0.620, Z = −0.496), and GBS colonization increased the odds of C-section 12-fold (OR: 12.242, CI95 %: 2.420-61.933, p = 0.005, χ(1) = 13.392). During the survey period the department worked on 16 cases of ATLL, with a mean surviving period of 14 months post-diagnosis. Hyper-CVAD, or CHOP-regimen based chemotherapy were implemented, in association with antiretroviral therapy in 5 (30 %) of the managed cases. Only 3 (18.5 %) patients were known as HTLV positive patients before the oncologic diagnostic, being followed in monitoring infectious diseases centers; in one case a vertical transmission was identified after the mother's diagnosis as a ATLL; 9 (56 %) of the patients presented with a HBV or HCV co-infection and 4 (25 %) of the patients declared they travelled and practiced at-risk activities in HTLV endemic areas. We present the preliminary results for the first 200 patients screened, with a mean ± standard deviation age of 31.2 ± 4.9 years, most of them (81 %) from urban areas, with wide national coverage: 66.5 % Bucharest-Ilfov, 26 % South, 3.5 % South-West, 2.5 % South-East and 1.5 % North-East Romania. Screening was performed at a median (interquartile range-IQR) gestational age of 21. 1 (11.8, 21.1) 46.9 [26.2, 107.7 ] IU/mL). Anti-Toxoplasma IgM (or IgM + IgG) were positive in 4.5 % (4 %) of patients, 1.5 % (1 %) for rubella and 4 % for CMV (all 4 % IgM + IgG). Patients with positive anti-CMV IgM had higher gestational ages at screening: 29.4 ± 9.7 vs. 21.6 ± 10.9 weeks (p = 0.048, t(193) = −1.988, high effect-size, d = 0.8). Patients with positive anti-Toxoplasma IgM were significantly more likely to cumulate pregnancy-associated adverse-behaviors (e.g., smoking, p = 0.008, χ(2) = 9.620), while those with anti-Rubella IgM were frequently ex-smokers (p = 0.004, χ(2) = 11.102). Rural dwelling was not a risk factor for acute infections. Monitoring data presented above have demonstrated that of the 34 patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), 26 patients developed severe sepsis of bacterial etiology with ARDS with respiratory starting point (nosocomial pneumonia). Pathogens involved were put out in pathological products as: sputum -1 case, tracheal aspiration -8 cases, hemoculture-5 cases; invasive devices: catheters, e.g.: IOT (5 cases), CVC (4 cases), urinary catheter (4 cases). Cocci pathogens accounted for: 12 cases (pneumococcus -8, MRSA -3, Staphylococcus aureus -2, Enterococcu spp. -2). Gram-negative bacilli: 13 cases (A. baumanii -3, Pseudomonas -5, Klebsiela pneumoniae -5). Fungi: 3 cases (C. krusei, C. albicans, C. glabrata). Of the 26 developed nosocomial pneumonia 11 had unfavorable evolution, 42 % death rate. Median age of affected patients was 62.5 years. Antimicrobial therapy, according to microbiological evidence included associations of last generation antibiotics in individualized doses, ± antifungals ± antivirals (oseltamivir) in case of flu. ARF required specific protective measures using noninvasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation. ARDS in influenza was analyzed separately. Out of 178 cases hospitalized during this period with chickenpox diagnosis, 165 presented various complications. The majority of complications occurred in preschool age children, with an impressive number of cases (40 -22.4 %) under one year of age. We found a gender predominance (56.1 % male, 43.9 % female), primarily within the urban population (74.1 %). The most frequent complication of varicella was bacterial superinfection of skin lesions (40.6 %) and pneumonia (36.3 %). Cellulitis occurred in 67 cases, 11 cases presented abscess with various locations (facial, extremities, trunk), requiring multidisciplinary treatment. Streptococcus pyogenes was the leading cause of bacterial infections (46.2 %), but also Staphylococcus aureus was found in a few cases. Other cutaneous complications include hemorrhagic varicella (3 cases) or purpura fulminans (1 case) which is associated with thrombocytopenia and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Invasive group A streptococcal disease (GAS) appeared in four cases, presenting positive blood culture, and multiorgan involvement in two cases, with favorable evolutions after treatment. Other complications were neurologic, which were reported in 15 children (6 %); meningitis was the leading diagnosis, followed by encephalitis and cerebellitis. One case of decease occurred at a child with purpura fulminans. Conclusions Bacterial infections complicating chickenpox cause significant morbidity and mortality, mainly in patients younger than 5 years of age. Varicella increases the risk for acquiring GAS disease. Cellulitis is the most common infection, deep-seated and septic infections can occur in immunologically healthy children with varicella. Chickenpox continues to cause significant morbidity in the pediatric population. Background Clostridium difficile colitis is currently a public health issue because of the rising numbers of cases reported both in children and adults. This condition arises because of excessive antibiotic use but also because of the immunodepression caused by chemotherapy in oncological treatments. We propose to appraise the clinical forms of Clostridium difficile colitis in children as well as the evolution under treatment. In the aforementioned period we have registered 24 cases of Clostridium difficile colitis in children. The most affected categories were the 4-8 years age group (41.6 %), female patients (75 %), with 25 % of the patients being immunosuppressed. No deaths were registered, and 50 % of cases relapsed (3 cases -1 relapse, 4 cases -2 relapses, 2 cases -3 relapses, 3 cases -more than 3 relapses). In cases with more than 3 relapses we have performed fecal microbiota transplantation. In one case with multiple antibiotic allergies, we performed fecal microbiota transplantation as the first choice of treatment without any previous antibiotic treatment. All fecal transplantation procedures were successful, without any incidents, and none of the cases registered any relapses. We identified 238 patients with CAP, which constituted the study lot. General data of the study lot: gender distribution: 52 % male and 48 % female, 57 % (138) of patients were from urban areas, 43 % (100) patients were from rural areas with the predominance of elderly patients (50 % of cases aged over 60 years). The duration of hospitalization in the study group was significantly higher than the duration of hospitalization in patients with other infectious diseases (7.06 days vs. 6.11 days, p < 0.0001). Most cases of CAP (69 %) were typical pneumonia (by Laennec classification). Unfavorable outcome was recorded in 4 % of cases. Evaluation by criteria of severity (i.e., CURB-65 score and sepsis criteria) in the study group showed that most subjects met severity criteria, as follows: CURB-65 ≥ 3 points -85 % of cases and sepsis defined by 2016 consensus criteria -97 % of the cases. In most cases, patients in the study group, associated comorbidities, the most common comorbidity was chronic lung disease (37 % of cases). CAP etiology was identified in 15 % of cases. The etiology most frequently involved in CAP in the study group was represented by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Conclusions CAP patients were often elderly patients from urban areas. The duration of hospitalization in subjects with CAP was significantly higher vs subjects with other infectious diseases. The most common clinical presentation was a typical pneumonia, meeting criteria of severity (i.e., score CURB-65 ≥ 3 points and/or presence of sepsis criteria), in a patient associated comorbidities and having sometimes a fatal outcome. The most common identified etiology was S. pneumoniae. We identified more that 3963 cases with an annual average of 793 cases. Most were registered in urban areas (2311 cases, 463/year), comparing with rural areas (1652 cases, 331/year) affecting mainly men (232 cases/year). Comparing with the other Candida infections the stomatitis represents an average of 46.6 %. The incidence of cases is higher at 0-4 years old group (51.2 %), mainly in male children between 0-1 years old. Over age 4 the percentage tends to reverse. The tests showed a significant correlation with age of the patients. Among 9 suspicions, 4 were "confirmed", 2 "probable" and 3 remained "suspected". All had cutaneous lesions. In one, the main form was meningo-encephalitis. Median age was 43 year-old (34-67), male:female ratio 5:4. All live in rural areas and have been in contact with cows/goats/sheep. Case 1/2013: confirmed, 34 year-old man, butcher: black eschar and malignant edema on left upper limb; subsequently developed necrotizing fasciitis, superinfected with MDR Gram-negative bacilli, requiring adapted salvage antibiotic therapy and surgical decompression. Cases 2, 3&4/2014: suspected cases, females (39, 51, 57 year-old), painless red-vesicular lesion and black eschar on fingers, surrounding edema, after contact with similar lesions on animals. All had positive B. anthracis in-house serology. Case 5/2015: a 43 year-old shepherd with meningo-encephalitis: fever, psycho-motor agitation, hemiparesis, aphasia, neck-stiffness, CSF compatible with acute bacterial meningitis; black eschars on both hands. From CSF and cutaneous lesions, DNA-Bacillus anthracis was positive PCR-techniques performed in Victor Babeș Clinical Hospital, Bucharest, where the patient was transferred in ICU). Cases 6,7,8&9/July 2016: 2 confirmed, 2 probable, all shepherds with deceased animals, all cutaneous forms: a cluster of 3 (2 men and a woman: 67, 42 and 61 year-old) and a 34 year-old man. All patients had favorable evolution. Questionnaires were filled out by 157 HCWs. Physicians represent 36 % of all respondents. All participants are familiar with Ebola virus disease, but only 54 % of nurses had learned about it before the 2014 epidemic, as opposed to 75 % of medical doctors. The most frequent symptoms and main routes of Ebola virus transmission were correctly identified by the majority of respondents, whereas the possibility of airborne transmission was the most common misperception (55 %). During the epidemic, participants were slightly more worried for the health of their families, mean score 6.25/10, rather than for personal risk of contracting Ebola, 5.88/10 (p = 0.025). HCWs who had been involved in the medical care of Ebola suspect cases are two times more likely to volunteer to care for such patients in the future (RR = 2.475, 95 % CI 1.283-4.774, p = 0.039). Participants obtained most of the information on Ebola at their workplace (82 %); 92 % of HCWs attended at least one specific training and 64 % believe there are adequate personal protection methods available at the Institute. Donning/removing personal protective equipment was the most frequented course (85 %). Many participants think they were provided with sufficient information on EVD (66 %), but wanted to know more about preventive methods, treatment and the preparedness plan of Romania. Twenty-eight children with sepsis and 21 without sepsis were enrolled. In all children enrolled, we found a negative correlation of 25(OH)D levels with PRISM-III score (R = −0.333, p = 0.01) and a positive correlation with iron, total and ionized calcium levels (R = 0.312, p = 0.03, R = 0.394, p = 0.007, respectively R = 0.515, p = 0.001). Patients with sepsis had a significantly lower median levels of 25(OH)D compared to cases without sepsis (21.35 ng/mL versus 34.8 ng/mL, p = 0.0004). The relative risk for sepsis was 2.22 (p = 0.03, specificity 0.79) and for PRISM-III >5 was 3 (p = 0.03, specificity 0.729) at vitamin D concentration <20 ng/mL. Compared to the group without sepsis, the sepsis group had significantly lower levels of HDL-cholesterol (22 mg/dL vs. 38.4 mg/dL, p = 0.015), albumine (3.6 g/dL vs. 4.08 g/dL, p = 0.005), total and ionized calcium (9.4 mg/dL vs. 9.8 mg/dL, p = 0.01, respectively 4.3 mg/dL vs. 4.8 mg/dL, p = 0.02). Among 30 patients with tick bites 21 were women with the average age of 40.8 years and 9 men, aged 58.1. 25 persons were from urban and 5 from rural areas. Seventeen patients (1 st group) did not show symptoms of Lyme borreliosis while 13 (2 nd group) were diagnosed with Lyme disease (LD). The mean span, while ticks were attached to the host was in average 1.7 days among persons in the first group while in second one -2.5 days. The incubation period in LD patients varied from 7 to 32 days, and lasted in average 13 days. The diagnosis was established based on clinical presentations, erythema migrans (EM) and was confirmed by ELISA IgM and IgG anti Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) antibodies. The most frequently revealed were complains on EM, pain and local burning sensations. Patients from the first group were given prophylactic treatment with doxycycline 200 mg as a single dose or amoxicillin in case of contraindications. None of them developed LD during a 45 days follow up period. Treatment for LD patients was successful in most of the cases; 4 patients were given doxycycline 100 mg twice daily (BD) for 14 days, 2for 10 days and 1 had doxycycline 100 mg BD for 21 days. Amoxicillin 500 mg orally TID for 14 days was prescribed to 3 patients and for 10 days in the same dosage to 2 patients. One person was given ceftriaxone 1 g BD for 21 days. Most of the patients had treatment as outpatients and just in 1 case the patient needed hospital treatment. During 45 days follow up period 1 patient was still complaining of anxiety, headaches and insomnia. Another one complained of general weakness. In one case skin lesions persisted despite of long lasting courses of antibiotics. Conclusions During a 60 days period LD was diagnosed in 13 patients who presented to the hospital with a history of tick bite. Fourteen patients were given doxycycline or amoxicillin as a prophylactic treatment which proved to be effective in all cases. Patients with LD were treated successfully with doxycycline or amoxicillin for a course lasting from 10 to 14 days as outpatients. In most of the acute LD cases outcomes were favorable. Background Drug-resistant (DR) tuberculosis (TB) is a growing problem in HIVinfected patients, being associated with high rates of treatment failure and mortality. According to WHO, in 2014, 312 (2.1 %) patients diagnosed with TB were HIV-infected. The rate of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) was 2.8 % (1.8-4.2) in the newly diagnosed TB cases and 11 % (8-15) in the retreatment group. Objective: Our aim was to describe clinical and laboratory characteristics of DR-TB in HIV infected patients. We identified 150 HIV-infected patients with TB, of which 102 (68 %) had microbiological confirmation. Nineteen (19 %) patients had DR-TB: six (6 %) patients had resistance to isoniazid, 7 (7 %) to rifampicin and 6 (6 %) had MDR-TB. HIV diagnosis was established before TB diagnosis in 14 (74 %  Compared to the control group (158 ± 39 pg/mL), the serum levels of KIM-1 were higher in patients with urinary infections (246 ± 82 pg/mL, p = 0.002). A negative correlation between KIM-1 levels and eGFR was observed in patients with urinary tract infections (r = −0.542, p = 0.001), and a positive association between KIM-1 and serum creatinine (r = 0.329, p = 0.015). No significant correlation between KIM-1 and other analyzed parameters were determined. Serum levels of gangliosides were significantly higher in patients with BPH and urinary tract infections compared with those without infection (28.4 ± 4.1 mg/dL in group A versus 22.7 ± 6.3 mg/dL in group B, p = 0.022). The statistical analysis showed the following correlations: between serum levels of gangliosides and PSA: r = 0.339, p = 0.053 in group A, r = 0.128, p = 0.042 in group B; between serum gangliosides and CRP: r = 0.301, p = 0.027 in group A, r = 0.326, p = 0.054 in group B, between serum gangliosides and IPSS: r = 0.367, p = 0.047 in group A, r = 0.209, p = 0.058 in group B. No relation between serum gangliosides and prostatic volume was observed. Toxocariasis prevalence in our geographic region is 51.7 %, with no significant gender differences. We can say that the majority of cases (66.5 %) were in the age group of 30-39 years and 40-49 years, while the minimum number of cases was found in the age group 60-69 years -(4 cases). The gender distribution of cases shows that 91 % of cases were women, 122 cases (67.77 %) being owners of pets (dogs). General clinical manifestations were represented by latch edema (44.44 %), headache (43.33 %), paresthesia (36.66 %), sweating (35.55 %), hoarseness (27.77 %), exanthemas (21.11 %) and abdominal pains (11.11 %). Locating ocular larvae of T. canis occurred more often in older children (10-16 years) and in adults. In the studied cases we met decreased visual acuity in 9 cases, 6 cases of uveitis, 2 cases with retinal granuloma, and 4 cases of endophthalmitis, all cases being hospitalized in Ophthalmology Clinics for appropriate therapy. Biochemical tests useful for diagnosis were represented by: major hypereosiniphilia, hyperleukocytosis, increasing ESR and gammaglobulin. In our study, leukocytosis was found in 62 % of cases and hypereosiniphilia in 88 %. For the certain diagnosis of toxocariasis we used serological methods which consisted in determination of specific Toxocara antibodies. Toxocara antibodies were present in all studied patients. The result was positive in 96 (69.56 %) cases and negative in 42 (30.43 %) cases. An IgG antibody titer of 1/100 was found in 40.5 % cases. The described complications and sequelae were met in 42 cases: respiratory disorders, ocular larva migrans, splenomegaly, uveitis, chorioretinitis and hepatomegaly. Conclusions Toxocariasis is characterized by expression of polymorphic clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic to various clinical forms with severe expression. What is needed in terms of future control programs is the radically development of new approaches, such as the effectiveness of molecular vaccines or based on DNA, offering the possibility of lifelong protection. The most pyogenic infections in the oro-maxillo-facial region are of odontogenic origin and are mixed infections, involving aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The microbiological investigation is not commonly performed in such infections. The aim of the present study was to identify at species level a collection of 31 isolates of anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, stored in ultra-freezer at the laboratory of the Microbiology Department, Faculty of Dentistry, University of Medicine and Pharmacy (U.M.F.) "Carol Davila" -Bucharest. The strains had been previously isolated from pus samples collected by needle aspiration from 31 patients among those treated for different types of odontogenic abscesses (vestibular abscess, submandibular abscess, etc.) at the Department of Oro-Maxillo-Facial Surgery, U.M.F. "Carol Davila" -Bucharest, during March 2012 -March 2014. All isolates except one belonged to Parvimonas micra (formerly Peptostreptococcus micros and Micromonas micros). The remaining strain was identified as Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus). Conclusions Parvimonas micra is by far the predominant species of anaerobic Gram-positive cocci involved in odontogenic abscesses. Species identification must not be neglected in oro-maxillo-facial infections due to its contribution to a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of such infections. Of the 646 samples, 339 were positive: 309 for Influenza Virus-IV and 30 for other respiratory viruses; 19 RSV, 1 hMPV (human MetaPneumoVirus), 2 Coronavirus 229E, 1 Adenovirus, 2 Rhinovirus, 5 Bocavirus. Three of the patients positive for RSV died (one death occurred in a woman of 82 years, one in a woman aged 59 years and one in a child 5 months). The three deceased patients had associated diseases. We mentioned that in February 2015 we reported a death from a child aged 2.9 years with type B of RSV disease and who didn't present associated diseases. Lung samples were sequenced from this patient to confirm the presumptive diagnosis of RSV infection caused by type B. Sequencing showed 100 % identity between the two pieces of lung and 97-98 % identity with sequences from GenBank. For every studied variable (psychopatological or quality of life indicators) a generalized linear model (GLM) was elaborated where we included the probable risk factors. Level of education attained, sex and marital status are important factors of risk for the state of health (both psysical and psychological) and quality of life among people living with HIV/AIDS. Level of education is significantly associated with depressive disorder (<0.001), anxiety disorders (0.019; 0.002; <0.001), post traumatic stress disorder (0.004), obsessive-compulsive disorder (0.011), substance use abuse (0.01), neuro-cognitive function (<0.001) and with quality of life indicators: health (0.04), psychological (<0.001), social relationships (0.001), environment (<0.001), and overall quality of life perception (0.007). Sex is strongly associated with global cognitive function (0.030), depressive disorder (0.011), substance use abuse (0.017), somatic symptom disorder (0.026), physical (0.009) and spirituality domain (0.01). Marital status is associated with global cognitive function (0.016), depressive disorder (0.005), anxiety disorders (0.012; 0.039; <0.001), obsessive-compulsive disorder (0.006), emotional stability (0.041) and psysical domain (0.036), social relationships (0.009) and overall quality of life perception (0.003). Age is a risk factor regarding cognitive decline (0.021; 0.042; 0.049), while the serostatus (asymptomatic/symptomatic/AIDS converted) is associated with depression (0.022), social phobia (0.003), substance use disorders (0.007), perceived stress (0.041) and general health condition (0.004). Subjects who perceived themselves as sick have a higher risk of substance abuse (0.004), isolation (0.024) and antisocial behaviour (0.048). During the epidemic seasons of years 2013-2016 164 strains of influenza virus were tested phenotypically (type A subtype H1N1 or H3N2 and type B). With the exception of two strains which exhibited IC50 values at the upper limit of normal inhibitions, all were within the sensitive criteria to oseltamivir and zanamivir.
