Two hundred and twenty nine people, participating in Hajj, attended the travel clinic at Hospital Nord and agreed to participate in the study. In addition, 98 people were approached during the pre-travel preparation session. Among them, 71 were included in the study and 27 either refused to participate or were already recruited in the study at the hospital. In total, 300 individuals were thus included in the study, with a male-to-female sex ratio of 1:1 and a mean age of 58.5 years (SD: 14.09; range, 22e85 years) ( Table 2) . About 13% were born in France and the others were immigrants, mainly from North Africa. The average duration of stay for immigrants in France was 37 years (Range: 1e65 years). One hundred and thirty-three (44%) of the participants had at least one chronic comorbidity; with hypertension and diabetes being the most frequent. In addition, 79% of the participants were either obese or over-weight. Out of 300 study participants, 194 (64.7%) had at least one risk factor warranting pneumococcal vaccination in the context of the Hajj; of whom 13 (6.7%) reported receiving a pneumococcal vaccination in the past 5 years. Sex was evenly distributed between those having risk factors and those not having risk factors for pneumococcal diseases (p > 0.05). Age was unevenly distributed between the two groups (p < 10 Ã€3 ) with the risk group having a higher mean age of 65.7 years (95% CI 64.5e67.1) than the not-at-risk group of 45.2 (95% CI 43.0e47.4). The overall knowledge of participants about the severity of pneumonia and the existence of a vaccine was low. Even though one-third of them (33.7%) had an indication for pneumococcal vaccination according to the French guidelines, independent of their participation in the Hajj, only 7% were offered the vaccination by their general practitioner ( Table 3) . Three of the questions had significantly different responses between the risk and the not-at-risk group. However, when multinomial logistic regression was performed with age group below and above 65 years as one of the covariates, the differences became insignificant for two of those questions. After adjusting for covariates, response to the question "Did your general practitioner ever recommend vaccination for pneumococcus?" was significantly different in both groups (p Z 0.039). Those in the risk group had the vaccination recommended to them more often than those in the not-at-risk group.
