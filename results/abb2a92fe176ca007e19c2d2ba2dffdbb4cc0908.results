From 2015 to 2017, 278 flocks were examined; of these, 145 (52.16%) were found to be IBV-positive. Based on phylogenetic analysis, the strains were clustered in four distinct groups (Fig. 2) . The distributions of different IBV genotypes expressed as a percentage of total IBV detected is shown in Table 1 . The most frequently occurring type was IS-1494-like IBV with 70.34% frequency of occurrence rate; 793/B was the second most common type with 19.31% frequency of occurrence. The third and fourth most frequently detected IBV types were Massachusetts and QX with rates of 7.58% and 2.75% respectively (Fig. 3) . QX IBV was not detected in Isfahan, Kurdistan, Golestan, and Khuzestan provinces. The highest frequently occurring of IBV was detected in Isfahan province (68.57%) and the lowest in Khuzestan province (39.39%). Sequence similarity among IS-1494-like IBV strains of this study varied between 98.86% to 100% and they had more than Table 2 ).
