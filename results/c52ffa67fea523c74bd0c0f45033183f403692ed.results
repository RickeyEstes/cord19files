In vivo description of SP-C pos , CCSP pos and SP-C pos /CCSP pos pulmonary cells The expression of SP-C and CCSP was analyzed in the lungs of 0 to 3 month old lambs by immunohistochemistry on frozen sections using cross-reacting antibodies. As expected, these antibodies specifically recognized cells expressing SP-C in the alveoli and cells expressing CCSP in the bronchioli ( Figure 1A ) validating their use as specific markers of respectively AECIIs and club cells in sheep. AECIIs were easily detectable in most of the sections due to their high expression of SP-C ( Figure 1B ) and club cells expressing CCSP were detectable when bronchioli were present on the lung section. Interestingly, rare SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells were observed in some lung sections ( Figure 1B) , demonstrating the presence of bronchioloalveolar progenitors in newborn lambs. Among the 4 independent lungs and repeated immunostainings, the SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells remained rare and only present on few lung sections. But this first in vivo evidence for the presence of progenitor-like pulmonary cells prompted us to search for these rare cells among cells obtained from lung dissociation. To quantify the respective frequency of AECIIs, club cells and progenitors, cell suspensions obtained by enzymatic dissociation of lung tissue from 10 lambs (0 to 3 month old) were analyzed for their expression of SP-C and CCSP by flow cytometry. Based on the dot plot analysis from a representative lamb ( Figure 1C ) and the compiled data from 10 lambs ( Figure 1D ), the suspensions of lung cells repeatedly contained 40% (± 18.5) SP-C pos cells and 0.65% (± 0.60) CCSP pos cells ( Figure 1D ). Co-expression of SP-C/CCSP was then analyzed to quantify the bronchioloalveolar progenitors. An average of 0.33% (± 0.31) of the total cells co-expressed the two markers and presented an immunophenotype compatible with lung progenitors ( Figure 1D ). We noted the low percentage of club cells in the cell suspensions issued from tissue dissociation. This may be attributed to our tissue processing. In order to work mainly with the cell populations present into the lung parenchyma, we carefully have macro-dissected the lung tissues before enzymatic digestion in order to limit cells coming from the bronchi and bronchioli. Moreover, the number of club cells in the lung of large mammals is lower compared to rodents. In vitro expansion and phenotypic characterization of primary airway epithelial cells Dissociated cells were grown in culture with selective Quantum286 synthetic medium complemented with KGF and HGF (referred to "complete Q286 medium") on fibronectin-coated plates and maintained for two to three passages as previously described [22] . Small and large cubical epithelial cell colonies and a few spindleshaped cells were rapidly observed after 3 days of culture; the small cubical cells proliferated and were further characterized for the expression of SP-C and CCSP. As shown by specific labeling in immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry, a majority of the observed cubical cells were SP-C pos AECIIs, while few of them were CCSP pos club cells (Figure 2A and 2B) . Interestingly, a minor population of SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells, compatible with bronchioloalveolar progenitors, was reproducibly identified in culture (Figure 2A and 2B). Compared to the AECIIs, the SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells were semi-adherent round cells with small cytoplasmic extensions ( Figure 2A ). These double positive SP-C pos /CCSP pos cells were rare after lung dissociation but enriched and maintained upon in vitro culture with synthetic medium ( Figure 2B ).
