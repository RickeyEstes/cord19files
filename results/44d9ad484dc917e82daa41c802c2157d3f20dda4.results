Co-administration with vectors encoding papillomavirus L1 or L2 significantly enhances the antigen-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 or OVA DNA vaccination In order to characterize the antigen-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses generated by vaccination with CRT/ E7 or OVA DNA in combination with vectors containing codon-optimized BPV1 L1 or L2 DNA, C57BL/6 mice (five per group) were vaccinated intradermally via gene gun with CRT/E7 or OVA DNA with or without BPV1 L1 or L2 DNA twice at 1-week intervals. Splenocytes from vaccinated mice were collected 1 week after last immunization and the E7 or OVA-specific T cell immune responses were characterized using intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 , mice vaccinated with CRT/E7 or OVA DNA vaccine in combination with BPV1-L1 or L2 DNA generated significantly higher E7-specific and OVAspecific CD8 + T cell immune responses compared to mice vaccinated with CRT/E7 or OVA DNA alone. To evaluate whether the enhancement of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses by co-administration of BPV1 L1 or L2 DNA is also observed in other papillomavirus systems, we co-administered HPV16 L1 or L2 DNA with CRT/E7 or OVA DNA vaccination. Of note, co-administration of HPV16 L1 or L2 DNA with CRT/ E7 or OVA DNA vaccination also generated significantly higher E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses compared to CRT/E7 or OVA DNA vaccination alone in mice (Fig. 2) . Thus, our data indicate that co-administration with papillomavirus L1 or L2 DNA significantly enhances the antigen-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses generated by DNA vaccination. Co-administration of papillomavirus L1 or L2 DNA with CRT/E7 or OVA DNA led to the generation of L1/L2specific CD4 + T cell immune responses In order to determine whether the co-administration with BPV1 L1 or L2 DNA with CRT/E7 DNA will lead to the generation of L1 or L2-specific CD4 + T cell immune responses, C57BL/6 mice (five per group) were vaccinated intradermally via gene gun with CRT/E7 DNA with BPV1 L1 or L2 DNA. Mice vaccinated with CRT/E7 DNA alone were used as negative controls. Splenocytes from vaccinated mice were collected 1 week after last immunization and incubated with BPV1 L1/ L2 virus-like particles (VLPs). The L1 or L2-specific CD4 + T cell immune responses were characterized using intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, mice vaccinated with BPV1 L1 in combination with CRT/E7 DNA led to the generation of L1-specific CD4 + T cell immune responses. Similarly, vaccination with BPV1 L2 with CRT/E7 DNA led to significant level of L2-specific CD4 + T cell immune responses compared to vaccination with CRT/E7 alone. Again, to observe whether the CD4+ T cell responses elicited by this vaccination strategy extend to other papillomavirus systems, we coadministered HPV16 L1 or L2 DNA with CRT/E7 or OVA DNA vaccination. As shown in Fig. 3c and d, compared to vaccination with CRT/E7 or OVA DNA alone, mice vaccinated with HPV-16 L1 or L2 DNA in combination with CRT/E7 or OVA DNA led to the generation of L1 or L2-specific CD4 + T cell immune responses. These results suggest that co-administration with DNA encoding papillomavirus L1 or L2 with Fig. 1 Characterization of antigen-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses generated by antigen-specific DNA vaccine mixed with vectors containing BPV1 L1 or L2 DNA. C57BL/6 mice (five per group) were vaccinated intradermally via gene gun with 2 μg/mouse of CRT/E7 or OVA DNA with or without BPV1 L1 or L2 DNA twice at 1-week intervals.

Co-administration with BPV1 L1 DNA significantly enhances the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination In order to determine if the observed enhancement of antigen-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses by coadministration of BPV1 L1 DNA can translate into potent therapeutic antitumor effects, we performed in vivo tumor treatment experiments using an HPV-16 E7expressing murine tumor cell line, TC-1. TC-1 also expresses HPV16 E6, but does not contain either L1 or L2. C57BL/6 mice (five per group) were first challenged with TC-1 tumor cells subcutaneously. One week after tumor challenge, mice were treated intradermally via gene gun with CRT/E7 DNA alone, BPV1 L1 DNA alone or CRT/ E7 DNA in combination with BPV1 L1 DNA. Vaccinated mice were boosted twice at 1-week intervals with the same dose and regimen. Tumor growth were monitored twice weekly by caliper measurements and palpations. As shown in Fig. 4 , tumor-bearing mice treated with CRT/E7 DNA vaccine in combination with BPV1 L1 DNA generated significantly reduced tumor volume and prolonged survival compared to mice treated with CRT/ E7 DNA alone or BPV1 L1 DNA alone. Thus, our data indicate that co-administration with BPV1 L1 DNA is capable of significantly enhancing the therapeutic antitumor effects generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination. The enhancement in E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses are contributed by CD4+ T helper cells In order to determine the mechanism underlying the observed enhancement of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by coadministration with L1 or L2 DNA vectors, we have generated pcDNA3 encoding the reverse sequences of L1 (BPV L1 (−)) or L2 DNA (BPV L2 (−)). C57BL/6 mice (five per group) were vaccinated intradermally via gene gun with CRT/E7 DNA with or without the reverse sequence of BPV1 L1 or L2 DNA twice at 1-week intervals. Splenocytes from vaccinated mice were collected 1 week after last immunization and the E7-specific T cell immune responses were characterized using intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. We found that mice vaccinated with CRT/E7 DNA vaccine in combination with the reverse sequence BPV1-L1 or L2 DNA did not lead to the increased frequency of E7-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses observed in mice Fig. 2 Characterization of antigen-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses generated by antigen-specific DNA vaccine mixed with HPV-16 L1 or L2 DNA. C57BL/6 mice (five per group) were vaccinated intradermally via gene gun with 2 μg/mouse of CRT/E7 or OVA DNA with or without HPV-16 L1 or L2 DNA twice at 1-week intervals. Splenocytes from vaccinated mice were collected 1 week after last immunization and the E7 or OVAspecific T cell immune responses were characterized using intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. a Representative flow cytometry data depicting the number of E7 (upper panel) or OVA (lower panel)-specific CD8 + T cells. b Bar graph representing the number of E7 (upper panel) or OVA (lower panel)-specific CD8 + T cells/3x10 5 splenocytes (mean ± SD). Data shown are representative of two experiments performed. * indicates p < 0.05 Fig. 3 Characterization of BPV1 and HPV-16 L1 or L2-specific CD4 + T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 or OVA DNA mixed with DNA encoding BPV1 or HPV-16 L1 or L2. C57BL/6 mice (five per group) were vaccinated intradermally via gene gun with 2 μg/mouse of CRT/ E7 with or without BPV1 or HPV-16 L1 or L2 DNA twice at 1-week intervals. Splenocytes from vaccinated mice were collected 1 week after last immunization and pulsed with 5 μg/mL of BPV1 or HPV-16 L1/L2 VLPs. The BPV1 L1/ L2-specific CD4 + T cell immune responses were characterized using intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. a Representative flow cytometry data depicting the number of BPV1 L1/L2-specific CD4 + T cells. b Bar graph representing the number of BPV1 L1/L2-specific CD4 + T cells/3x10 5 splenocytes (mean ± SD). c Representative flow cytometry data depicting the number of HPV-16 L1/L2-specific CD4 + T cells. d Bar graph representing the number of HPV-16 L1/L2-specific CD4 + T cells/3x10 5 splenocytes (mean ± SD). Data shown are representative of two experiments performed. * indicates p < 0.05 vaccinated with CRT/E7 DNA with BPV1-L1 or L2 DNA (data not shown). The insert sequences does not express into L1 and L2 that activate CD4+ T cell help, thereby cannot enhance the E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses of the CRT/E7 vaccine. The result suggests that CD4+ T cell help generated by co-expression of L1 or L2 protein promotes E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses to CRT/E7 DNA vaccination. Co-administration of BPV1 L1 DNA with CRT/E7 DNA led to the generation of L1-specific neutralizing antibodies In order to determine if co-administration of BPV1 L1 DNA with CRT/E7 DNA will lead to the generation of BPV1 L1-specific neutralizing antibodies, C57BL/6 mice (three per group) were immunized on days 1, 15, and 30 intradermally via gene gun with CRT/E7 and/or BPV1 L1 DNA. In vitro neutralization assays were performed using BPV1 L1 pseudovirus on twofold dilutions of antisera collected from the mice 2 weeks after the final immunization. Mice vaccinated with CRT/E7 in combination with BPV1 L1 DNA were found to generate similar neutralizing antibody responses compared to mice vaccinated with BPV1 L1 DNA alone (Fig. 5) . Co-administration of BPV1 L1 or L2 DNA with OVA DNA vaccination generated OVA-specific CD8+ T cell response through intramuscular administration Finally, we evaluate whether co-administration with papillomavirus L1 or L2 DNA can elicit potent antigenspecific CD8+ T cell responses when applied through different route of administration. C57BL/6 mice (three per group) were vaccinated intramuscularly with OVA DNA with or without BPV1 L1 or L2 DNA twice at one-week intervals. One week after the last immunization, PBMCs were collected and the OVA-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses were characterized through flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Fig. 6 , mice vaccinated intramuscularly with OVA DNA in combination with BPV1 L1 or L2 DNA generated significantly higher percentage of OVAspecific CD8+ T cells compared to mice vaccinated intramuscularly with OVA DNA alone. This data indicates that co-administration with papillomavirus L1 or L2 DNA can lead to enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses through the intramuscular route of administration.
