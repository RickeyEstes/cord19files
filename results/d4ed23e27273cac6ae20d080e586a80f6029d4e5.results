Screening hybrid cultures from several fusions resulted in one positive cell line, BM-8, which had antibody activity to B. abortus LPS. The ascites fluid produced from twice cloned cells was tested by ELISA and found to contain antibody of the IgG1 subclass. No reactivity was apparent with antibody to mouse IgG (H and L) or mouse IgM. Antibody was prepared from pools of ascites fluid by affinity chromatography. Several batches were pooled, dialyzed and concentrated. A typical affinity chromatography run is presented in Fig. 1 . Immunoelectrophoresis (Fig. 2 ) revealed a single precitipin arc when developed with rabbit anti-bovine gamma globulin. This arc was fairly long, indicating some heterogeneity, although not as extensive as IgG1 prepared from serum (also by affinity chromatography). Double agar gel immunodiffusion with antisera specific for the heavy chains revealed reactivity with anti-IgG1 only and anti-A antisera (results not illustrated). SDS-PAGE gave two bands when stained with Coomassie blue, one at 55 000 D and one at 25 000 D, indicating the appropriate molecular weights for heavy and light chains (see Fig. 3 ). The BM-8 antibody was not able to agglutinate B. abortus cells at a neutral pH at concentrations of antibody of less than 25/~g/ml. Above 25/lg/ml a very fine, "powdery" agglutinate could be visualized but no increase in clumping was seen with increased concentrations of antibody. Similarly, control IgG1 antibody to B. abortus LPS did not cause agglutination at concentrations below 20/~g/ml. Agglutination at pH 3.65 occurred with both BM-8 and control IgG1 to concentrations of 500 ng/ml in 10 min. The BM-8 antibody did not appear capable of precipitating B. abortus LPS in agar containing 1.0 M NaCl at the levels tested while the control IgG1 preparation did give a diffuse precipitin band at 1.0 mg/ml. The BM-8 antibody was capable of fixing guinea pig complement. In the diagnostic CFT, 200 ng/ml of the antibody gave 50% activation of three CHso units of complement (Fig. 4) . Similarly, in the diagnostic indirect ELISA, using B. abortus LPS as the antigen and mouse monoclonal antibody to bovine IgG1, conjugated with HRPO, as the detection reagent, 25 ng/ml of BM-8 could be detected after 10 min of development at an OD of 1.0 at 414 nm. These data are presented in Fig. 5 . In the competitive ELISA, the BM-8 antibody was unable to compete with the monoclonal antibody to B. abortus LPS.
