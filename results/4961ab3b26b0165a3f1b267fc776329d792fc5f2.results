The results of the regression models estimated to identify the optimal Minkowski coefficients are summarized in Figure 2 . Figure 2a summarizes the regressions for the road distance coefficient optimization, and Figure 2b for the optimization of the travel time coefficient. Figure 2 shows different values of a goodness-of-fit indicator (R 2 ) obtained from a regular sample of p values throughout the [  Visual illustration of road distance and distance metrics the methods used to measure distance, it displays the second largest standard deviation and range. Travel time can be immediately compared with all the distance metrics, as 1 minute corresponds to 1 kilometer: in comparison with road network distance, travel time displays a lower standard deviation and a shorter range, with a minimum travel time of 1.51 minutes, and a maximum of 26.76 minutes, under optimal conditions. Conversely, its mean displays the highest value, 12.11 minutes. Shorter range and higher mean are likely due to the opposite effects of speed limits on road segments of different length: in general, longer travel paths include large segments that occur on major roads, where speed limits are higher, whereas shorter trips tend to occur on minor roads, which are associated with lower speed limits. As a consequence, a model that takes speed into consideration produces a shorter travel range. Consistently, the standard deviation is lower. The higher mean value suggests that overall speed limits tend to slow down travel; that is, segments with low speed limits have a large impact on the overall travel pattern throughout the road network. Euclidean distance tends to underestimate road distance, as shown by the mean and range; the standard deviation is lower than for road distance, with values that are fairly close to those for travel time. This is probably due to the smoothing effect of a uniform distance model, which produces lower values than actual road distance for curvilinear segments and the most complex paths. Manhattan distance tends to overestimate road distance and produces values consistently larger than those of Euclidean distance. Its mean value is very close to the road distance mean, but it also presents the largest standard deviation and the largest range. This may suggest that the Calgary road network contains several parts that follow the Manhattan pattern (hence a similar mean value), but the presence of different patterns in the same network increases its error (large standard deviation). In comparing Euclidean and Manhattan distances, Manhattan distance produces a close approximation of the mean, and only slightly overestimates the standard deviation, whereas Euclidean largely underestimates both values. For the range, both metrics produce approximately the same error, though with opposite sign. This suggests that, overall, Manhattan is a better model than Euclidean for the Calgary road network. The value of p = 1.54 best approximates road distance in the Minkowski formula. Indeed minimum and maximum values are close approximations, whereas mean and standard deviation underestimate road distance. This result can be considered satisfactory, as it indicates that the error is minimized for individual measurements, but overall the method displays the aforementioned smoothing effect, whereby mean measurements tend to be slightly smaller than actual ones, with overall lower variations around the mean. It shall be observed that this distance metric is approximately half-way between Euclidean and Manhattan; however, all the descriptive statistics present values that are closer to the Euclidean than the Manhattan results. The value of p = 1.31 best approximates travel time in the Minkowski formula. Interestingly, the descriptive statistics suggest that this metric is the best approximation of road distance; indeed a close approximation. As noted, Determination of optimal p values for Minkowski distance Figure 2 Determination of optimal p values for Minkowski distance. travel time presents features that differ from distance, i.e., larger mean and lower range: this combination is hard to achieve by the class of metrics considered, because p values closer to 1 (Manhattan) produce larger means, whereas p values closer to 2 (Euclidean) produce lower ranges. In light of these considerations, a relatively low p value, such as p = 1.31 most closely approximates this pattern, rendering a model that is less extreme than Manhattan, as shown by a lower standard deviation. Overall the metric p = 1.31 provides a model of travel that is intermediate between measured road distance and travel time measured under optimal conditions. This is supported by almost all the descriptive statistics; the greatest shortcoming of this metric is its poor approximation of the mean. This value produces the best of all the metrics examined. Finally, it shall be noted that the travel time pattern would be very different if measurements were to consider less favorable conditions. The most common impediments to fast travel in Calgary include traffic congestion, e.g., rush hour, and severe winter weather conditions. Traffic congestion tends to affect major roads more heavily, where feasible speed can easily be reduced by 20-25% of the speed limit, whereas its effect is generally lesser on minor roads. Severe winter weather conditions are likely to have a comparable effect on major roads, but they will also have comparable or worse effects on minor roads. However, a speed reduction from 80 to 60 km/h on long road segments significantly impacts travel time, lowering the maximum and range values, and increasing the mean value. Conversely, an equivalent or greater speed reduction from 50 to 40 or 35 km/h on shorter road segments is likely to have only a minor impact on the overall travel time. Seeking to approximate such travel pattern via a Minkowski p value is therefore unlikely to produce better results. Table 2 presents a selection of summary statistics of the differences between each empirical measurement and the distance metrics considered. These are only global results, overshadowing the performance of each distance model throughout the city. These results suggest that, globally, the differences produced by each model are modest.
