In the context of infectious diseases from which hosts can recover (e.g. malaria, influenza, pneumococci, etc), disease maps that form loops are representative of the trajectory from health, through infection and sickness and back to recovery or death [15] . In particular, disease space with looping behaviour and disease maps that are circular can be used to, for example: 1.) describe the in-host dynamics of infections; 2.) identify where data of patients lie along the infection timeline, regardless of whether the stage of the infection is known (for example, from cross-sectional studies or from data of patients coming clinics to be treated, at different (and unknown) stages of the infection); and 3.) distinguish between more and less resilient individuals, from a relatively early stage of the infection course. This methodology was applied in [15] to investigate malaria. Motivated from this approach, we investigated if looping curves are a common motif in influenza or influenza in co-infection with bacteria. To that end, we also generated phase plots of pairs of features of our data sets and used K-nearest neighbour analysis, as is explained below. Definition 3.1: Disease space is the multidimensional space that can be plotted using quantitative measurements of disease symptoms as axes. Definition 3.2: Parameters of a data set that oscillate, partially overlap and have a time lag between them are called hysterectic parameters [15] . Definition 3.3: When pairs of hysterectic parameters are plotted against each other in their phase plot they create loops [15] . These can be considered two dimensional projections of the higher dimensional looping behaviour of the data set and are referred to as disease maps .
