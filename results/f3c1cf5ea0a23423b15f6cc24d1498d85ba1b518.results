During the study period, a total of 1494 pneumonia patients aged !65 years were enrolled in the study. Among them, sputum samples were obtained from 1044 patients (70%). After excluding 230 patients whose influenza vaccination history were unavailable (22% of patients with sputum samples), a total of 814 patients were eligible for our analyses (Fig. 1) . Among them, 42 (5%) tested positive for influenza virus by PCR: 40 were positive for the influenza A virus, and the other two were positive for the influenza B virus. Among the 26 influenza A-positive samples that were subtyped (65% of all influenza A-positive samples), all were positive for the H3N2 strain. Non-influenza viruses were detected in 178 patients: HRV was the leading virus detected (n = 77, 9%), followed by RSV (n = 36, 4%). Non-influenza viruses were co-detected in 6 of the 42 influenza-positive patients (14%) and detected in 172 of the 772 influenza-negative patients (22%). Bacterial pathogens were co-detected in 26 of the 42 influenza-positive patients (62%). Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between influenza pneumonia patients (i.e., cases) and noninfluenza pneumonia patients (i.e., controls) (Tables 1 and 2 ). Cases were more frequently found in winter seasons than controls, but other characteristics were similar between cases and controls. Among 814 patients, 525 (65%) had been vaccinated for influenza. Vaccinated patients more frequently had received home oxygen therapy and had been diagnosed with chronic respiratory obstructive disease than unvaccinated patients, while other characteristics were similar between two groups (Tables 1 and 2) . After adjusting for confounders, the IVE against laboratoryconfirmed influenza pneumonia was 58.3% (95% CI, 28. ( Table 3 ). The change in IVE estimates was marginal after additional adjustment for performance status (58.9%; 95% CI, 30.6-75.7%) or BMI category (58.0%; 27.6-75.6%); therefore, these variables were not included in the final models. The sensitivity analyses showed similar results. IVE was relatively higher (68.9%; 95% CI, 46.4-81.9%) when we used patients who were negative for influenza but positive for non-influenza viruses as controls, but the value was almost identical to the primary analysis when we used patients who were negative for all viruses (57.8%; 95% CI, 26.9-75.7%). For the secondary outcomes, the IVE against primary influenza pneumonia (70.1%; 95% CI, 19.8-88.9%) was higher than that Table 4 . The IVE against influenza pneumonia was higher in patients with immunosuppressive conditions (85.9%; 95% CI, 67.4-93.9%) than in those without these conditions (48.7%; 95% CI, 2.7-73%; test for interaction, p = 0.001). IVE did not differ by sex. The point estimate of IVE decreased with increased age, but the difference did not reach a statistically significant level (test for interaction, p = 0.17). Patients' chronic conditions and statin use status did not modify IVE.
