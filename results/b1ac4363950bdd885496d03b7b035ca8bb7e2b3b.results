Cells Lacking RNase L Are Resistant to AZA Treatment. DNMTi's induce the accumulation of self dsRNA in several different tumor cell types (7, 14, 15) . We confirmed this observation in A549 NSCLC cells treated with 50 μM AZA for 48 h by visualizing cytoplasmic dsRNA accumulation with a monoclonal antibody against dsRNA (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ). While there was no detectable dsRNA in untreated cells, accumulation of dsRNA in the cytoplasm was apparent after AZA treatment. To determine whether RNase L affects AZA sensitivity, we compared parental vector control A549 cells (wild type; WT) with RNase L knockout (KO) cells, previously generated with CRISPR-Cas9 technology (33) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A ). Cells treated with different amounts of AZA were monitored for survival as a function of time using an IncuCyte real-time cell imaging system (Essen Bioscience) and a dual-dye method. While the majority of WT cells appeared dead after 48 h of AZA treatment, the AZA-treated RNase L KO cells appeared normal ( Fig. 1 A-D) . Quantification of WT cell survival showed that 63 and 77% of the cells had died by 60 h in response to 50 or 100 μM AZA, respectively (Fig. 1E ). Cell death in WT cells was observed at concentrations of 6 μM AZA or greater. In contrast, the RNase L KO cells were highly resistant to 100 μM AZA after 60 h, with little or no death (Fig. 1F) . To confirm that RNase L was responsible for AZA sensitivity, RNase L KO A549 cells were transiently transduced with lentiviral constructs encoding either WT or nuclease-dead mutant (R667A) RNase L (34) (Fig. 1G ). Knockin (K-In) of WT RNase L sensitized the cells to AZA, leading to decreased cell survival, whereas introduction of mutant RNase L (R667A) had a diminished effect on cell survival (Fig. 1H) . These results demonstrate that AZA-induced cell death requires RNase L with a functional catalytic domain. Individual OAS1, 2, or 3 Isoforms Are Sufficient for Increasing AZA-Induced Cell Death. Immortalized, human mammary epithelial hTert-HME1 (HME) cells were also rendered highly resistant to AZA by knockout of RNase L ( Fig. 2 A-C) . The relative contributions of the different OAS isoforms to AZA-induced cell death were determined with double-knockout (DKO) HME cells, each expressing only one of the three enzymatically competent OAS isoforms. DKO cells lacking OAS2 and 3, OAS1 and 3, or OAS1 and 2 express only OAS1 (O1), 2 (O2), or 3 (O3), respectively (Fig. 2D) . Survival of the different types of untreated cells was unaffected by OAS DKO or triple-knockout (TKO) genotypes ( Fig. 2 E and H) . Interestingly, expression of any of the three OAS isoforms rendered HME cells nearly as sensitive to AZA as the WT cells (Fig. 2F ). However, compared with WT cells, the HME cells lacking all three OAS isoforms, namely TKO cells, were relatively resistant to AZA ( Effect of MAVS on AZA Sensitivity. dsRNA signaling to the type I IFN genes requires the MDA5-RIG-I/MAVS pathway (35) . Therefore, to determine whether IFN production, with subsequent OAS induction, is required for AZA-induced cell death, A549 cells in which MAVS was knocked out individually or in combination with RNase L were used (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A ). MAVS KO A549 cells were only slightly less sensitive to AZA treatment than WT cells, suggesting that, although IFN production may have contributed to AZA-mediated cell death, its effects were modest (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 B and C). However, the RNase L-MAVS DKO cells were resistant to AZA at concentrations as high as 50 μM (SI Appendix, Fig. S2D ), similar to RNase L KO cells (Fig. 1F) . These results suggest that basal The data are the averages ± SD from three identically treated replicates. Two biological replicates were performed, each with a minimum of three technical replicates. *P < 0.05, ***P < 0.001. levels of OAS1 to 3 in A549 cells, confirmed by gene expression analysis (SI Appendix, Table S1 ), are sufficient for the cell-lethal effect of AZA, through RNase L activation. AZA Causes Apoptotic Death of A549 Cells. To determine the mode of cell death by AZA, caspase-3/7 activation was monitored as a marker of apoptosis by real-time imaging with the IncuCyte system and software (Fig. 3) . While WT A549 cells activate caspase-3/7 strongly in response to AZA, the RNase L KO A549 cells were resistant to AZA (Fig. 3 A and B) . MAVS KO cells showed a modest reduction in caspase-3/7 activation, whereas RNase L-MAVS DKO cells were highly resistant, similar to the RNase L single-KO cells (Fig. 3 B-D) . As a positive control, the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-FMK greatly suppressed caspase-3/7 activation, as expected. To confirm that AZA treatment induces apoptosis, PARP cleavage was monitored in Western assays. Treatment of WT A549 cells with 50 μM AZA for 48 h resulted in cleaved PARP (Fig. 3E ). In contrast, identical treatment of RNase L KO A549 cells did not lead to PARP [poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase] cleavage. Thus, AZA induction of both caspase-3/7 activation and PARP cleavage in WT but not in RNase L KO cells indicates cell death occurred through the proapoptotic activity of RNase L (25, 26, 36) . Death. To further validate the involvement of RNase L in AZAmediated cell death, a potent small-molecule inhibitor of RNase L, valoneic acid dilactone (VAL), was used. Treatment of A549 cells with 10 μM VAL protected them against the cytotoxic effect of AZA (Fig. 4 A and B) . Similarly, VAL suppressed caspase-3/7 activation in response to AZA, showing that apoptosis was prevented by chemical inhibition of RNase L (Fig. 4C) . Previously, we reported that RNase L activity triggers the phosphorylation of JNKs, and also that JNK-deficient cells are resistant to RNase L-mediated apoptosis (29) . Accordingly, AZA-induced cell death was inhibited by treating WT A549 cells with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (Fig. 4D) . The RNase L KO cells were resistant to AZA in the absence or presence of this inhibitor (Fig. 4E) . The rescue from cell death by the JNK inhibitor implicates JNK in the RNase L-dependent mechanism of apoptosis in response to AZA treatment.
