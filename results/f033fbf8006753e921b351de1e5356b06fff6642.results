We have determined the identity of the immunoglobulin V-genes encoding mAbs to groups B and C capsular PS and compared the genetic relationship with antibody functionality. These monoclonal antibodies were developed against N. meningitidis and have use for evaluation in immunological assays for N. meningitidis (Mandrell and Zollinger, 1982) . Monoclonal antibodies 2-2-B and 4-2-C have exquisite specificity for groups B and C meningococci, respectively, with little cross-reactivity in ELISA (Fig. 1) . Antibody 2-2-B binds with specificity to the type B capsular polysaccharide antigen, with the reactivity of the antibody with capsular polysaccharides from type C at background levels. In contrast, mAb 4-2-C binds with high specificity to type C capsular polysaccharide with no reaction against encapsulated serogroup B organisms. Indeed, analysis of the serogroup reactivity of these two mAbs on 13 distinct serogroups confirms the utility of these mAbs in meningococcal diagnostics (Table 3) The discrete difference between groups B and C sialic acid containing polysaccharide antigens is limited to the type of bond between the sialic acid molecules and the O-acetyl group in group C PS (Table 1 ). In this case, mAb 4-2-C is against a homopolymer of sialic acids linked in alpha 2,9 linkages which is found in the type C capsular PS, and mAb 2-2-B is against a homopolymer of sialic acid linked in alpha 2,8 linkages, found in type B capsular PS. We determined the molecular sequence of the expressed and rearranged immunoglobulin V-genes by sequencing the Table 3 Reactions of anti-B, anti-C monoclonal antibodies against 13 known serogroups of meningococci 2 and 3 , respectively). Consensus and degenerate forward primers were designed to be complementary to sequences in the upstream leader region or the N-terminal framework 1 regions of most known murine V H and V L genes and back primers were based upon conserved constant region sequences (Dattamajumdar et al., 1996; Kabat et al., 1991) . Highly similar alleles from the J558 immunoglobulin V H family encode the V H of the anti-type B and C capsular polysaccharide mAbs. Our analysis of the cDNA sequences (Fig. 2) . Analysis of 4-2-C and 2-2-B reveals that the heavy chain of 4-2-C is encoded by a J558.5 allele linked to a DH SP2.8.01 and a JH1.01 cassette, whereas 2-2-B is encoded by a J558.2 allele linked to a DH SP2.7.01 allele and a JH2.01 cassette. Interestingly, the 4-2-C V H and 2-2-B V H have 93% nucleotide identity through their V H region resulting in 13 amino acid substitutions; 4 clustered in CDR1; 4 in CDR2; and the other mutations falling outside of the CDRs. The primary sequences of 4-2-C and 2-2-B are very different in the CDR3. The length of the CDR3 domain of 2-2-B V H is 12 amino acids whereas 4-2-C has 10 amino acid residues. Interestingly, in these two V H -domains, the CDR3 region has only 52% identity at the nucleotide level but the inferred amino acid sequence reveals that CDR3 of 4-2-C V H has three hydrophobic amino acid residues (W, F, W) while 2-2-B H3 has one hydrophobic amino acid residues (F) (Fig. 2) . These hydrophobic types of residues have been implicated as being important for antibody binding to carbohydrate antigens (Hutchins et al., 1996; Smithson et al., 1999) . This is consistent with the findings of others (Garcia-Ojeda et al., 2003) who found that 23/39 (∼59%) C-type PS reactive monoclonal antibodies were likely expressing the J558 allele according to Northern blot RNA analysis. This number decreased to 50% when examining only those mAbs generated from mice immunized with the native PS antigen and excluding animals injected with protein-conjugated PS antigen conjugates. Detailed analysis of the heavy chain domains (Fig. 2b) reveals high conservation of the CDRs in the independently derived group C reactive mAbs. This is quite remarkable given that the CDR3 is comprised of the rearrangement of three separate genetic mini-elements and occurred independently in different B cells, in different animals. The V H of 2-2-B, the anti-group B mAb has a distinct and extended CDR3 region, but otherwise is highly identical I the CDR1 and 2 regions. To the authors knowledge this is the first time that the Vgene sequence of an anti-group B capsular PS mAb has been determined. There is a recurrent use of identical light chain variable regions to encode monoclonal antibodies to group C PS. Remarkably, all of the anti-C PS mAbs, which were independently derived, use the identical light chain variable region (with a few changes in our sequences due to primer instilled changes). The 4-2-C light chain has very high identity with the light chain genes from other previously identified group C PS mAbs (Fig. 3) . Of note, the Vk domain of 4-2-C has 100% identity with Vk domain of the 177.16 mAb further The IGKV4-57*01 sequence represents the closest corresponding germline V K sequence to 4-2-C V K as determined by both V-Quest (http://imgt.cines.fr) and Ig-BLAST at NCBI. The 177.16, C2/655.7, and 2016.3 V K sequences are the corresponding V K genes from other functional anti-meningococcal antibodies submitted previously to NCBI by Garcia-Ojeda et al. (2003) . The IGKV1-110*01 sequence represents the closest corresponding germline V K sequence to 2-2-B V K (V-Quest). A dash (-) indicates the same amino acid in the clones, while a dot (·) indicates the same nucleotide codon in the clones. (//) Stands for the seven codon deletion in CDR2 which is not depicted. (B) Inferred amino acid sequence alignment of the anti-group B and anti-group C kappa light chain Variable region domains of clones 2-2-B and 4-2-C, respectively. A star (*) indicates the same amino acid residue identity in a position, while a dot (·) indicates a different residue, and a dash (-) indicates inserted spaces placed in the sequence to provide maximum identity. The light chains sequences have 53% identity over the region depicted. supporting the recurrent recruitment of particular V-domains to this antigen, and suggesting an important role for the light chain in determining type C capsular PS specificity. We exclude our observed changes in the sequence of the framework 1 region of 4-2-C VK sequence, as these were templated by the specific primer used to amplify this cDNA. Clones 2016.3 and 177.16 light chain domains are encoded by a Jk2 and Jk4, respectively, whereas 4-2-C is encoded by a JK4. Light chain variable region genes encoding anti-PS mAbs are unmutated. The light chain sequences of mAbs 4-2-C and 2-2-B are essentially pristine compared to the assigned germline Vl genes without somatic mutations in the sequence away from germline (Fig. 3) . The Vk of 2-2-B has one change at the C-terminal end of in CDR3 at position 112 (P to Y), which is most likely due to junctional-joining diversity. The V-kappa sequences of these clones are distinct and this likely contributes to some of the differences in specificity for sialic acid linkages. The functional light chain sequences were also analyzed for relatedness to the available databanks.
