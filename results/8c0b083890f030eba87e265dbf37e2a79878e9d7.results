The protein responsible for the antiviral effect of L. obliqua hemolymph was isolated and purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 75 column . Then, the semi-purified fraction containing the antiviral activity was applied onto an ion-exchange Resource-Q column. As previously demonstrated by our group ), the antiviral protein purified by this procedure decreased the production of measles virus (from 3.3 ± 1.25 Â 10 7 to 2.1 ± 1.5 Â 10 5 TCID 50 /ml) by 157 times the production of poliovirus (2.8 ± 1.08 Â 10 9 to 4.58 ± 1.42 Â 10 7 TCID 50 /ml) by 61 times. These differences were significant at p < 0.05. The mass spectrometry was used to determine the N-terminal of the protein. Further, the N-terminal sequence was analyzed against previously constructed L. obliqua cDNA libraries (Veiga et al., 2005) .
