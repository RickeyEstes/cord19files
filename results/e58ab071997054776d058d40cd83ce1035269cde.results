A total of 104 infants were assessed for enrollment between November 2011 and May 2014; of these, 90 infants diagnosed with viral bronchiolitis-associated apnea (median age, 38 days; IQR, 3 to 152 days) were enrolled in the study. This was an explanatory proof-of principle randomized trial rather than a pragmatic test of caffeine effectiveness in usual practice; thus, 5 infants (2 in the caffeine group and 3 in the placebo group) were excluded from analysis because each was given an extra dose of caffeine after admission to the PICU ( Figure 1 ; available at www.jpeds.com). Of the remaining 85 infants, 43 were randomized to receive caffeine citrate and 42 were randomized to receive placebo. The subjects' baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 treatment arms, except for a significantly different mean duration of upper respiratory symptoms before enrollment (caffeine group, 3 AE 2 days; placebo group, 5 AE 4 days) ( Table I) . Among these 85 patients, 81 had a discharge diagnosis of bronchiolitis. In the placebo group, 2 patients were diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease. In the caffeine group, 1 patient was diagnosed with sepsis and 1 patient was diagnosed with bronchiolitis with myopathy.
