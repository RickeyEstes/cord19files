Baselines for recording of clinical signs and pathological changes were determined from the 6-21-weeklong monitoring of the 46 calves before inoculation, and from the findings in the nine control calves after mockinoculation, respectively. The baselines were set at a respiratory rate of 40 per minute, a rectal temperature of 39.3Â°C and 5% consolidation of the lung tissue. Number of days with clinical signs and nasal excretion of BRSV between day 0 and 8 PI are summarised in Table 1 .
