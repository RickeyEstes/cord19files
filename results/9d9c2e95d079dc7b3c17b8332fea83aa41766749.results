In the nine cats, clinical signs included lethargy and anorexia (7/9, 78%); polyuria and polydypsia (4/9, 44%); lameness (1/9, 11%); paresis/ paralysis and/or pain (4/9, 44%). CNS deficits (dementia with concurrent deficiency in mid brain or brainstem) were documented in three out of nine cats (33%) ( Table 1) . Common metabolic abnormalities included hyperglobulinaemia (globulin O50 g/l) in all cats, renal azotaemia (creatinine O 110 mmol/l) in four out of nine (44%) cats, hypercalcaemia (calcium O 3.00 mmol/l) in three out of nine (33%) cats. Ionised calcium (O5.7 mg/dl) in three out of nine (33%) cats and hypoalbuminaemia (albumin ! 25 g/l) in six out of nine (67%) cats (Table 2) . Initial pretreatment leukocyte counts were variable ranging from 2.4 to 19.4 (!10/l) (mean, 8 ! 10/l; range 5e18 ! 10/l). Leukopenia was noted in cases 1, 4, 8 and 9. The leukocyte count was within normal range in cases 3, 5 and 7. Leukocytosis was noted in cases 2 and 6 ( Table 2) . Non-regenerative anaemia was found in cases 1, 2, 4, 8 and 9. Routine urinalysis revealed proteinuria (protein O 30 mg/dl) in (7/9, 78%) cases 2 and 9 recorded 21 and 19 mg/dl protein in the urine, respectively (reference range, 0). Abnormalities in urinalysis included changes in specific gravity and deposition of urine sediment (see Table 2 ). Electrophoresis of blood samples revealed monoclonal gammopathy in seven out of nine cats (Fig 1) and polyclonal gammopathy in two out of nine cats (cases 2 and 3). Electrophoresis of urine samples revealed polyclonal gammopathy in case 4, while blood electrophoresis revealed monoclonal gammopathy. Light-chain protein (Bence Jones protein) was found in five out of nine (56%) cats. Serum immunoelectrophoresis to determine the immunoglobulin class was performed in three cats and found to be associated with IgG (cases 7 and 8) and IgA (case 4). Attempts to identify this protein were not made in other cases (Table 2) . Plain radiography of the thorax and abdomen performed in all cats revealed no soft tissue organ abnormalities in eight cats, but in case 2, thoracic radiography showed blurring of the pulmonary vasculature, linear and nodular densities in the lungs and general loss of contrast, typical of interstitial pulmonary pattern and cardiomegally. Abdominal radiograph showed a distended bladder. Routine thoracic and abdominal radiograph were not sufficiently diagnostic of the lytic bone lesions, therefore, close-up bone surveys are essential to detect the bone lesions. Radiographically, skeletal lesions characterised by well-circumscribed osteolytic bone lesions were seen in the cervical spine, (case 6), the lumbar spine, (cases 1, 2, 3 and 9), the left stifle, (case 8) (Fig 2) and the left and right stifles (case 9) (Fig 3) . Contrast myelography was performed in two of the cats and revealed extradural compressive lesion caused by tissue expansion from the bone marrow in cases 6 and 3 (Fig 4) . All eight cats that had ante-mortem surgical bone biopsies exhibited plasma cell infiltration (O20% plasma cell population in bone marrow aspirate) (Table 1) . Post-mortem microscopic examination of sections of neoplasms exhibited abundant (O20%) plasma cells in the bone marrow. These cells were larger, pleomorphic and contain two or more nuclei (Fig 5) . In case 2, post-mortem histopathology of the bone biopsy exhibited abundant (O40%) plasma cells in the bone marrow, with many features of malignancy (multinucleated cells and immature nuclear features). No neoplasia was found within organs of the abdomen and/or the thorax, instead granulomatous lesions, which appeared as white foci on cut surfaces, were found in the liver, kidney, abdominal lymph nodes and spleen ( Table 3 ). The cat also had pulmonary haemorrhage/oedema, myocardial necrosis and blood filled bladder. Bleeding or haemorrhagic disease was observed in four cats in this study. In case 1 retinal vessels were dilated and tortuous, and intraocular haemorrhage was detected on ophthalmoscopic examination. In case 2, on clinical examination there was melena and haematuria, and on postmortem examination there was approximately 25 ml of serosanguinous fluid, mixed with clots of blood in the thoracic cavity, pulmonary haemorrhage and bladder haemorrhage. In case 4, focal areas of perivascular haemorrhage were detected in the retinas of both eyes on ophthalmoscopic examination. In case 8, melena was detected on clinical examination. Relative serum viscosity which was determined by the RBC pipette method was in case 1, 4.51; case 2, 3.65; case 4, 5.46; and case 8, 6.18. Relative serum viscosity in clinically normal cats is reported to be !1.40. An estimate of overall improvement was made based on all the data collected from the owners, related to clinical improvement or deterioration (eg, degree and duration of morning stiffness and stiffness related to activity, increased appetite, resolution of melena and haematuria) and our own assessment related to disease severity (eg, the degree of clinical signs (neurological, cardiac or ocular abnormalities), the degree of lucency seen on the radiographs, haematological parameters (serum protein level, liver enzymes measurement) and functional activity, eg, ability of the animal to move). Little or no improvement was noted in cases 1, 2, 8 and 9. Temporary improvement was noted in case 4 and marked improvement in cases 3, 5, 6, and 7. Cases 3, 5, 6 and 7 were judged to be in complete remission. In those cats with complete remission, transient or absence of the clinical signs were seen in cases 3, 5, 6 and 7, insignificant or complete absence of lucency on radiographs of the affected bone in cases 3 and 6, and return of serum protein level to normal in cases 3, 5, 6 and 7 when serum proteins were re-measured 8 weeks after treatment. At the onset of therapy ALT, ALP and bile acids were found to be within normal limits. A mild elevation of ALT (average 90 IU/l) and ALP (average 115 IU/l) occurred in five cats (cases 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) 4 weeks after treatment, but returned to normal when liver enzymes were re-measured 4 weeks later (cases 3, 4, 6 and 7) and 8 weeks later (case 5). During that time cats were fed a balanced diet with moderate to high levels of high biological value protein and vitamin supplementation. Lethargy after starting treatment increased in all cats, but returned to normal 4 weeks later. All animals presented in this study with the exception of case 2 have definite classic antemortem multiple myelomas by following the criteria described originally by MacEwen and Hurvitz (1977) in dogs. Case 2 also satisfied these criteria but only after a post-mortem examination was performed. Haematological and radiological signs that were repeatedly noted in cases which had less favourable outcome were listed in the aggressive group, and other haematological and radiological signs which had favourable outcomes were listed in the less aggressive group (Table 4 ). The survival time of the four cats in the aggressive group (cases 1, 2, 8 and 9) was 2, 5, 14 and 7 days, with a median survival time of 5 days. The survival time of the five cats in the less aggressive group (cases 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7) was 450, 120, 135, 510 and 720 days, with a median survival time of 387 days. There was significant difference between survival time and mean survival time in the aggressive and less aggressive groups. This may be helpful to assess the tumour burden and outcome of treatment in the future.
