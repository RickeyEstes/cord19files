Using Matlab to simulate the model(2),you can get the figure 1.Day 0 in Figure 1 corresponds to the time when the first infection case (latency period) was found, that is, December 1, 2019. It can be seen from Figure 1 that the epidemic began to concentrate in about 79 days (ie, February 7, 2020). It can be seen that the number of infected people will reach its peak in about 89 days (February 28). In the case of quarantine precautions, the number of infected people may reach 2,384,803, and will eventually come to an end after 103 days (March 13 In fact, the Wuhan Municipal Government not only implemented the city closure measures on January 23, but also regulated traffic facilities in Wuhan and closed down most public places. We can simulate the intensity of government control by adjusting the average number of people k infected each day. From December 1st to January 23rd, the Wuhan Municipal Government did not take effective isolation measures, so when t <54, k = 5; when t â‰¥ 54, the government adopted a series of strong measures such as the closure of the city and simulated them separately. The change in the number of infected persons at k = 1 and k = 2 can be obtained in Figures 2 and 3 . It can be seen from Figure 2 that when the government takes precautionary measures to control the average daily number of contacts per infected person k = 2, it can be seen that the number of infected persons reaches a peak after about 74 days, that is, February 12, 2020, and the number of infected persons is about 106,145 The epidemic situation is expected to come to an end in 90 days; when k = 1, it can be seen from Figure 3 that the number of infected people reached a peak about 70 days later, that is, February 8, 2020, and the number of infected people was about 74,369. It shows that when the government adopts effective quarantine measures, the number of infected people can be greatly reduced.
