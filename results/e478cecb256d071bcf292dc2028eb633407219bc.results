No single specific cysteine in the S protein endodomain was essential for virus replication There are nine cysteines in the CR motif of the MHV S protein (Lopez et al., 2008) . To examine the effects of these residues on virus replication, a series of recombinant MHVs was constructed with mutated S Endo by RNA targeted recombination (Fig. 1A) . The deletion of all 18 residues of the CR motif (Mut-d1), the deletion of 10 residues of the CR motif near the Tm (Mut-d2), and the substitution of all nine cysteine residues of the CR motif with alanine residues (Mut-p1) were lethal for the respective recombinant MHVs (Fig. 1B) . However, the deletion of 8 residues in the CR motif near the Endo (Mut-d3) and all point mutations of 1-2 cysteine residues (Mut-p2 to -p7) did not impair the survival of recombinant MHVs (Fig. 1B) . The size of plaques produced by all survived mutants was significantly smaller than that of the wild-type MHV (p b 0.001) (Fig. 1C) . The statistical analysis showed that the partial deletion mutant (Mut-d3) produced smaller plaques compared with other point mutants (Mut-p2 to -p7) that could be further divided into three groups from small to large: Mut-p4, -p5, and -p7; Mut-p2 and -p3; Mut-6. The tendency might be associated with the importance of these mutated cysteines in the motif. We observed that there was no significant difference between one and two cysteine substitution. Also, the substitution with alanine, serine, or glycine showed the similar effect. Notably, the boundary of the plaques formed by Mut-d3 seemed to be much fuzzy and the plaque size of Mut-p7 had a bigger deviation (Fig. 1B) . These results indicated that no unique cysteine is crucial for virus survival but some cysteines may play more important role in the function of the S protein. Multiple cysteines in the S endodomain were concurrently responsible for virus replication Previous studies have shown that when the CR motif of the S protein was mostly deleted (leaving only four or five cysteines), the production of recombinant MHVs was not affected, but the cell-cell fusion was decreased dramatically (Yang et al., 2011; Ye et al., 2004) . To determine the exact number of cysteines required for the survival of MHV, mutant viruses with only one to six cysteines left in the CR motif of S gene were constructed ( Fig. 2A) . Meanwhile, in order to facilitate the detection of viral survival, gene 4 was replaced by an EGFP reporter in these mutants ( Fig. 2A) . L2 cells were infected with supernatants of the various mutant MHVs produced by targeted RNA recombination and visualised by microscopy at 24 h post infection (hpi). The recombinant MHVs containing one to four cysteine residues in the motif (MH54GFP-1C to -4C) failed to induce any visible syncytia, and the recombinant MHVs with five or six cysteine residues in the motif (MH54GFP-5C and -6C) induced only light syncytia formation (Fig. 2B) . Fluorescent microscopy showed that the MH54GFP-1C and -2C mutant viruses failed to express EGFP, that the MH54EGFP-3C virus expressed a low level of EGFP, and that the MH54GFP-4C, -5C and -6C mutants expressed a high level of EGFP (Fig. 2C ). These results indicated that the replication of the virus depends on the number of cysteine residues in the CR motif and that at least three cysteines in the motif are required for the viability of the recombinant MHVs. Deletion of the cysteine-rich motif impaired the localisation of the S protein to the cell surface The substitution of the cytoplasmic tail of the MHV S protein, which contains the CR motif, with the cytoplasmic tail of the VSV G protein resulted in abolition of cell-cell fusion but did not interfere with expression of the S protein on the cell surface (Bos et al., 1995) . The replication of coronaviruses is critically affected by the cellular localisation of the S protein. The less S protein that is expressed on the cell surface, the weaker the extent of cell-cell fusion (Bosch et al., 2003) . We previously found that membrane-anchored HK protein and cytoplasmic EGFP were differentially located within the cell (Yang et al., 2011) . In this study, the distribution of the HK proteins expressed by four recombinant MHVs ( Fig. 3A ) was further explored by sequential staining to the living and permeabilized cells with two anti-HA antibodies. Two HK proteins, the HKM protein with wild-type MHV S Tm/Endo and the HKP protein with a Tm and a truncated Endo of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) without cysteine residues, were largely localised on the cellular surface (upper two panels in Fig. 3B ). However, HK-2C and HK-6C with the MHV S Tm but partially deleted CR in the Endo were found to be principally distributed in the cytoplasm (bottom two panels in Fig. 3B ). These results indicated that the sequence containing charged residues rather than the number of cysteines in the motif is essential for the accumulation of S protein on the plasma membrane.
