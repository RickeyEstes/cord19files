In vivo experiments show that TCoV is pathogenic in poults, nonpathogenic in chickens, and does not adapt to chickens The TCoV strains used in this study (Table 1) were pathogenic for 1-day-old poults with diarrhea developing by 48 h post-inoculation (PI) and lesions in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract observed in most of the birds by 72 and 96 h PI (Table 2) . Lesions in the GI tracts consisted of pale, flaccid intestines with thin walls, and gaseous watery contents. The ceca were bloated and filled with air and watery contents. Real-time RT-PCR conducted on pooled GI tracts from poults infected with the TCoV/TX-1038/98 strain had cycle threshold (Ct) values of 21.7, 16.7, 20.1, and 37.6 at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h PI, respectively (Table 2) , indicating that the most virus (lowest realtime RT-PCR Ct value) was detected in poults at 48 h PI. Based on this data, the pooled GI tracts from poults given the other TCoV isolates were examined at 48 h PI and the data are presented in Table 2 . No clinical signs of infection were observed in the upperrespiratory tract or in the GI tract when the TCoV/TX-1038/98 or the TCoV/TX-GL/01 strains were given to chickens. To determine if TCoV could revert back to pathogenicity in chickens we passaged the viruses in 1-day-old chicks by infecting the birds, re-isolating the virus from the GI tract and giving it to additional 1-day-old chicks. No clinical signs or lesions were observed when either virus was passaged in 1-day-old chickens. The TCoV/TX-1038/98 virus was detected in pooled GI tracts on day 3 for passages 1 and 2, and on day 5 for passage 3. The TCoV/TX-1038/98 virus could not be detected in the pooled GI tracts from the fourth passage so the experiment was terminated. The TCoV/TX-GL/01 virus was detected on day 3 after the first passage in 1-day-old SPF chickens but could not be detected in the subsequent passage. No clinical signs, lesions, or virus were detected in any of the contact exposed chickens for any of the passages. Finally, the last virus-positive passage of TCoV/TX-1038/98 (third passage) and TCoV/TX-GL/01 (first passage) in chickens were examined for pathogenicity in 1-day-old poults and both were found to induce clinical signs and lesions similar to the original virus before passage in chickens (data not shown). The above data show that TCoV does not adapt or revert to cause disease in chickens.
