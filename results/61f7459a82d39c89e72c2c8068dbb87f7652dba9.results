Two-dimensional gels were prepared from total soluble proteins extracted from 10°C or 20°C acclimated cultures of Daphnia pulex kept under normoxia (oxygen partial pressure: 20 kPa). A total of 224 spots were detected in representative fusion images for each acclimation condition ( Figure 1A , B; encircled spots). The dual-channel representation of both fusion gels revealed a large set of coldinduced proteins of low molecular weight (M r < 40 kDa) in the lower right diagonal half of the gel ( Figure 1C ; red-colored spots). Proteins of reduced expression in the cold were mainly confined to the low-pI range (pI = 4-5) in the upper left diagonal half of the gel (green-colored spots). A total number of 17 spots comprising cold-repressed proteins (36-41, Figure 1A ) and cold-induced proteins (spots 42-52, Figure 1B) were successfully identified by mass spectrometry (Tables 1, see Table 2 for corresponding protein IDs and gen models). Additionally included into the inter-gel comparison was a set of spots (1, 19-22, 28-32, 34-35) , the identity of which was already known from a previous study [12] . These spots showed either constitutive or temperature-dependent expressions. It is conspicuous, that a separation of cold-induced and cold-repressed proteins by M r /pI leads to protein groups of similar classification. Almost all of the identified proteins with a reduced expression in the cold (expression reduction by 40-80%) were secretory enzymes involved in protein digestion (spots 31-32 and 36-41, Table 1 ). These include three trypsins (TRY4B, TRY5F, TRY5L), two chymotrypsins (CHY1A, CHY1C), one astacin (ACN2), and two carboxypeptidases (CPA1A, CPA1B). All these proteins are synthesized as pro-enzymes (zymogens), which are activated by the removal of an N-terminal propeptide (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Owing to the similarities in their M r /pI values, these proteins were multiply identified among the analysed spots. In addition, the multiple occurrence of TRY5F and CHY1C in spots with assigned M r values of 25 and  30 kDa may be explained by the possible co-presence of pro-enzymes and enzymes. The only non-proteolytic proteins identified among these spots were two secretory proteins (ERNA, ERNB) carrying the characteristic domain of the EndoU/XendoU family of endoribonucleases [13, 14] . The spot region 28, which was excised and analyzed in a previous study [12] , contained a mixture of enzymes (including peptidases of the family M2 and M13), which made an expression evaluation impossible. Most dominant among the identified cold-induced proteins were the vitellogenins (VTGs) and actins. These proteins showed a 4-7-fold induction and were detected in ten spots (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) . The multiple detection of these proteins and the large discrepancies between the experimental and predicted M r values (actins: 42 kDa, VTGs: 190-220 kDa) indicate that the main share of the cold-induced protein spots in the lower right diagonal half of the gel ( Figure 1C ; red-colored spots) were proteolytic cleavage fragments. However, it is important to note that VTG cleavage fragments of 65-155 kDa may naturally occur in developing Daphnia embryos (see discussion). The tryptic peptides used for the identification of VTGs covered a large part of the VTG sequences including the superoxide dismutase-like domain (SOD), the large-lipid-transfer module (Vit-N), and the von Willebrand-factor type-D domain (VWD) (Figure 2 ). None of the tryptic peptides could be allocated to the domain of unkown function (DUF1943) and to the interdomain regions. Based on the high sequence coverage by trypic fragment analysis, two vitellogenins (VTG1, VTG4) could be identified ( Figure 2 , lower part). Although the present study did not yield any tryptic peptides for the N-terminal SOD-like domain of VTG2, the presence of VTG2 among the analyzed spots cannot be excluded because of the very large sequence identity of VTG2 and VTG1 (98% identity when excluding the SOD-like domain). Actins were detected in four spots (44, 47, 48, 51) . The tryptic peptides used for the identification of actins (Figure 3 ) covered only the C-terminal half of the 42-kDa pro-2D protein gels from Daphnia pulex acclimated at 20°C (A) and 10°C (B) Figure 1 2D protein gels from Daphnia pulex acclimated at 20°C (A) and 10°C (B). Gel images represent fusion (average) images from a set of three (A) or two (B) biological replicates. Consensus spots used for comparison in (D) are encircled.

Identification was based on 2D gel electrophoresis and nano-HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of trypsin-digested proteins matched against the "Frozen Gene Catalog" of the D. pulex protein database [2] . The compiled information includes the spot number ( Figure 1A , B), the 10-to-20°C expression ratio, the number and sequences of matched peptides, the sequence coverage, the Mascot score as a statistical measure of identification probability, the experimental and theoretical molecular weight (M r ) and isolectric point (pI) of the mature protein (without signal peptide), the predicted length of the N-terminal signal peptide (SP) in secretory proteins, as well as the putative function and symbolic name of the protein. The length of the putative pro-peptide (PP) is additionally provided for proteolytic enzymes that are secrected as inactive precursors (zymogens). The predicted M r and pI values of zymogens and the mature enzymes are given as value ranges. The amino acid sequences of the identified proteins were derived from the gene models listed in Table 2 . a) percentage of predicted protein sequence covered by matched peptides. b) Probability-based MOWSE score: -10*Log(P), where P is the probability that the observed match is a random event. Scores >38 indicate identity or extensive homology (p < 0.05). Protein scores are derived from ions scores as a non-probabilistic basis for ranking protein hits. The Mascot-score calculation was performed using whole-protein sequence (including the N-terminal signal peptide in case of extracellular proteins). *p < 0.05 (t-Test). Putative functions and symbolic names of identified proteins are given in relation to gene model names and protein identification numbers of those loci which were referred to in the present study. DappuDraft protein IDs in bold type indicate manually curated gene models that may differ from those contained in the 'Filtered Models v1.1' set (released by the Joint Genome Institute in July 2007). The Reference DappuDraft gene ID can be used to retrieve the corresponding models from the Filtered Models set. Assignment of protein spots to the vitellogenins of Daphnia pulex teins, suggesting that the N-terminal half was proteolytically cleaved during the preparation of wholeanimal extracts. Proteolytic cleavage is additionally indicated by the discrepancy between experimental (25-36 kDa) and predicted M r values (42 kDa). Owing to the high sequence identity ( 97%), it was impossible to discriminate the expression of cytoplasmic isoforms (ACT1A-D) and muscle-specific isoforms (ACT2A-C). The lower number of tryptic-peptide assignments and the complete lack of EST evidences for ACT1D and ACT2C, however, suggests that these two actins were probably not expressed. A ten-fold up-regulation in the cold was found for an AAA+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities; [15] ), a fragment of which was detected in spot 42. Additional identifications comprised proteolytic cleavage fragments of a molecular chaperone (HSP90, spot 47), the heavy chain of myosin (MHC-1) and a pyruvate kinase (both in spot 48). Since the latter three proteins were co-identified with actins and VTGs in the same spots, it was impossible to assess their induction states. Among the remaining identifications was a group of carbohydrate-modifying enzymes with a constitutive or reduced expression in the cold. Constitutive expressions showed the exo--1,3-glucanase EXG5 (spot 34) and the -amylase AMY (spot 35). The cold-repressed proteins included a cellubiohydrolase (CEL7A, spot 1), an endo--1,4-glucanase (CEL9A, co-localized with paramyosin in spot 19) , an endo--1,4-mannanase (MAN5A, co-local-ized with a -1,3-glucan-binding protein in spot 30), and the enolase ENO (spot 19).
