Expression, localization and cleavage of SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins Before we compared the UPR-activating activity of SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 S proteins, we expressed them in 293FT cells. Both Western blotting ( Figure 1A ) and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy ( Figure 1B ) indicated effective expression of both proteins to similar levels. The molecular sizes of both S proteins were~155 kDa, indicative of post-translational modifications. This was generally consistent with the reported size of SARS-CoV S protein [2] [3] [4] . With the help of the fluorescent ER marker of DsRed-ER, we confirmed that both S proteins resided largely in the ER ( Figure 1B , panels 3 and 6). SARS-CoV S protein is proteolytically processed into S1 and S2 subunits by host proteases such as cathepsin L, factor Xa, trypsin and transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Particularly, TMPRSS2 efficiently activates S proteins of SARS-CoV as well as MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Moreover, TMPRSS2 and related proteases TMPRSS4, which are abundantly expressed in human alveolar epithelial cells, are capable of activating influenza virus hemagglutinin [37] . To investigate whether they might also proteolytically activate HCoV-HKU1 S protein, we expressed them together in 293FT cells. Coexpression of TMPRSS2 with SARS-CoV S protein resulted in the appearance of S1 subunit, indicative of proteolytic cleavage ( Figure 2 , lane 3). Although a V5 tag was added to the N-terminus of SARS-CoV S protein, the cleavage was not affected. The action of TMPRSS2 on SARS-CoV S was highly specific since TMPRSS1 and TMPRSS4 had no activity under the same condition ( Figure 2 , lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, none of the three proteases cleaved HCoV-HKU1 S protein ( Figure 2 , lanes 4-6). Thus, HCoV-HKU1 S protein is not processed by TMPRSS1, TMPRSS2 or TMPRSS4.
