The virus analyzed was from a female in her 40s with acute myelogeneous leukemia (AML) presenting for hematopoetic cell transplant. The previous year she had undergone four cycles of chemotherapy (G-CLAM, G-CLA, cytarabine, and decitabineprimed MEC). Her prior month's bone marrow evaluation showed 16% blasts by flow cytometry with normal cytogenetics. On day -12 (12 days prior to transplant), she was found to be infected by a coronavirus 229E with a cycle threshold (Ct) of 30 and persisted at the same Ct on day −9 (Fig. 1a) . Based on the patient's risk of relapsing leukemia and relative rarity of HCoV pneumonitis, the decision was made to continue with HCT despite ongoing viral shedding. On days −7 and −6 she received cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg, and on days −4, −3, and −2 she received a dose of twice-daily 2 Gy total body irradiation for a cumulative dose of 12 Gy (Fig. 1a) . Other significant drugs the patient received during this time period included acyclovir, granisetron, micafungin, voriconazole, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. A mismatched unrelated donor peripheral blood stem-cell transplant was performed on day 0. Throughout the HCoV infection, the patient had mild nasal congestion but never required supplemental oxygen. Her course was complicated by bacteremia on day 10 (10 days after transplant), thought to be due to grade 2 mucositis, and she was discharged on day 20. Four nasal swab samples over a four-week period were available from the patient. All qRT-PCR cycle thresholds (Ct) recovered over the four-week period were comparable, ranging between 31.3-33.5 ( Table 1 ). The percent of total reads mapping to HCoV 229E ranged from 0.01-0.75%, consistent with the low concentrations of virus found by qRT-PCR ( Table 1) . mNGS of the Day 15 post-transplant specimen revealed a large deletion that encompassed 548 of the 660 nucleotides of the ORF 4 gene (Fig. 1b) with average coverage of 68× across the viral genome. Repeat library preparations of the same specimen demonstrated the same deletion. The deletion was found whether mapping to the HCoV 229E reference genome or the de novo assembly. No read was recovered within the area of the deletion, suggesting the presence of a viral population entirely containing the genomic deletion. mNGS of the day −12 and day −9 specimens from the same patient revealed a completely intact ORF4a/4b (Fig. 1b) . Other than the large deletion, no consensus variants were observed between the HCoV 229E consensus genomes recovered from day −12, day −9, and day −15 specimens. Mapping of reads from the day -12, day −9, day −15 samples to the day −12 consensus genome revealed two minor allele variants that reached >10% allele frequency and had consistent allele frequencies between the day −12 and day −9 samples. The first was a c.12332 A > G, p. K4111R change in the replicase protein that went from undetectable in the day −12 and day −9 specimens and was at Fig. 1 Detection of a 548-nucleotide deletion in a HCoV 229E strain associated with myeloablation. a Depiction of the case history surrounding myeloablation and coronavirus infection. A woman in her 40s with AML was found to be infected with a HCoV 229E just before her HCT. Due to the patient's advanced disease, the decision was made to continue with the transplant. Four successive HCoV-positive nasal swab specimens were available from the patient; two from before treatment with myeloablative cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation and two from after. All days are reported relative to HCT. b Coverage plots of mNGS reads mapped to the reference genome for HCoV 229E (NC_002645) of three samples from the patient revealed the generation of a 548-nucleotide deletion in the ORF4a/4b gene. In addition to deleting 83% of the coding region from ORF4a/4b, the deletion resulted in a frame shift that resulted in a premature stop codon 10 amino acids before the reference genome stop codon. Primer binding sites are denoted in blue for confirmatory junction RT-PCR. c Confirmatory junction RT-PCR of the four available HCoV-positive nasal swabs revealed the absence of the deletion before myeloablation and the presence of the deletion in specimens taken after myeloablation. NTC, no template control 11.9% allele frequency in the day −15 specimen. The second was a c.675_676insU that maintained at 10.6%, 10.8%, and 8.9% allele frequency in the day −12, day −9, and day −15 specimens. No junctional reads across the 548-nucleotide deletion were found in either the day −12 or day −9 specimen by mNGS. mNGS of the day −2 specimen also demonstrated the 548-nucleotide deletion with coverage across the genome consistent with RNA degradation ( Figure S1 ). No consensus variants were observed in the genomic regions covered in the day −2 specimen. Confirmatory RT-PCR across the ORF 4a/4b gene demonstrated an intact gene in the pre-myeloablation specimens and a smaller PCR product consistent with the 548-nucleotide deletion in the day −2 and day 15 post-myeloablation specimens (Fig. 1c) . Deep sequencing of the day −9 and day −2 PCR amplicons revealed no junction reads from the day −9 specimen mapping to the day 15 deletion strain locus with 11,279× coverage at the same locus for the intact ORF4 gene in the day −12 strain ( Figure S2) . Conversely, only one paired-end read from the day −2 specimen mapped to the deleted portion of the ORF4 gene locus in the day −12 strain with 158,938× coverage at the ORF4 locus in the day −15 deletion strain ( Figure S2 ). Attempts to culture each of the patient's specimens on MRC-5 cells proved unsuccessful. No CPE was visualized for any of the patient's four clinical samples and HCoV 229E RNA levels in the culture supernatant were undetectable by qRT-PCR after inoculation, while viral growth was apparent in the positive control HCoV 229E ATCC type strain ( Figure S3 ).
