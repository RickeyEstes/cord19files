Structure of NPC1-C The 1,278 residue human NPC1 contains 13 predicted transmembrane-spanning helices and 3 large luminal domains, domains A, C, and I ( Figure 1A ), the overall structural features of which remain to be illustrated. The crystal structure of the first luminal domain (domain A, also called N-terminal domain, NTD) is previously reported, showing a helical structural fold that contains a deep pocket for binding of sterols (Kwon et al., 2009) . The structure information of the second and third luminal domains (domains C and I, respectively) of NPC1, however, are uncharacterized. Here, we used the pET21a expression vector to produce human NPC1-C (residues 374 to 620) in E. coli BL21 (DE3), and the protein exists as insoluble inclusion bodies. Then the inclusion bodies were refolded to obtain soluble NPC1-C, which behaves as a single monomeric peak in gel filtration ( Figure S1A ). Some droplet-like crystals were obtained using the sitting drop vapor diffusion crystallization method, and the best crystal diffracted to a high resolution of 2.0 Ã… . As there is no homology structural model, the crystal structure of NPC1-C was determined by using single wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing method with the help of a gold derivative. After several rounds of refinement, the final R free and R work reached 21.9 and 18.2, respectively (Table S1) . Overall, NPC1-C is mainly composed of seven a helices in the center as a core and seven b strands surrounding the core, with two protruding loops ( Figure 1B ). The first protruding loop (loop 1) is localized between b2 and b3 strands, while the second protruding loop (loop 2) is between a4 and a5 helices ( Figure 1B ). NPC1-C contains four cysteine residues, all of which were involved in forming disulfide bonds (C468-C479, C516-C533) ( Figure 1C ). Through analysis of primary protein sequence, NPC1-C has seven potential N-linked glycosylation sites, six of which locate in the loops, while one locates at the tip of a4 helix ( Figure S1B ). No glycans are observed in the crystal structure because the NPC1-C protein is expressed in bacterial cells that lack post-translational glycosylation modifications. However, the surface exposure of the seven sites indicates their accessibility for N-glyco-transferases. The intact luminal NPC1-C consists of residues 372 to 640. In our crystal structure, only residues 384 to 624 are visible (Figure S2) . We cannot see the electron density for the N-terminal 12 amino acids and C-terminal 16 amino acids ( Figure S2 ), indicating that these regions might be flexible loops. It is assumed that, with these flexible N-terminal and C-terminal loops, the domain C can protrude from the endosomal membrane (Figure S3) and be easily bound by the primed GP molecule.
