pDC or MyD88 deficiency dramatically decreases IFN-I production but still allows a strong ISG induction during MCMV infection To assess the contribution of pDC activation and endosomal TLR7/9 triggering to IFN-I responses during MCMV infection, we analyzed the induction of IFN-I and ISG in the spleen or blood of BALB/c mice knocked-out for MyD88 or TLR9, or depleted of pDC through administration of the 120G8 mAb directed against Bst2. 120G8 mAb injection dramatically reduced circulating IFN-I titers and splenic Ifnb1 expression at d1.5 after infection (Fig 1A and 1B) . However, unexpectedly, only a slight impairment was observed in splenic induction of 3 canonical ISG at d1.5 and 3 after infection ( Fig 1B) . Consistently, 120G8 mAb injection in BALB/ c mice did not compromise splenic viral control at d6 (S2A and S2B Fig) . Because the administration of the 120G8 mAb resulted in an efficient and selective, even though not entirely specific, depletion of pDC during MCMV infection (see materials and methods), we can rigorously conclude that pDC and their high systemic production of type I IFN are not required for induction of strong type I IFN responses and relatively efficient control of MCMV infection in our experimental settings. Similar results were obtained for splenic induction of Ifnb1 and ISG in BALB/c MyD88 -/and BALB/c TLR9 -/mice ( Fig 1B and S2C Fig). In contrast, ISG induction was completely abrogated in IFNAR -/animals ( Fig 1B) . Thus induction of strong IFN-I responses in the spleen of MCMV infected mice seems not to require pDC, MyD88 or TLR9 functions and can be induced by very low levels of IFN-I.
