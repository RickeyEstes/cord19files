Information regarding the sampling date, biosecurity status, region of sampling, vaccination programs, necropsic and clinical signs, the age of the broilers, and mortality rates are summarized in Table- 1. We collected 14 samples from broiler farms located in Western and Central Algeria from the flocks showing kidney damage and high mortality rates. Eight of these farms had not vaccinated their flocks against IBV, 2 farms conducted the prototype vaccination program but with a short interval between the first and second vaccinations, and 4 farms vaccinated their broilers only against the Mass serotype. All vaccinations were performed through the drinking water route, and all the sampled broiler farms showed poor zootechnical performance with rare period elongation (until 71 days in farm 2) and high mortality rates (up to 50% in farms 11 and 13). The seroprevalence of various IBV strains in broiler flocks suffering from kidney damage in Algeria is summarized in Table- 2. All the broiler flocks (100%) tested in this study were seropositive for the QX variant strain, with high mean titer levels (MT=11 log 2 ) regardless of the vaccination status. Furthermore, 60% and 50% of the broiler flocks were seropositive for antibodies against the 4/91 and M-41 strains, respectively, although with low mean titer levels. The seroprevalence of IBV D-274 was the lowest with only 7% of the broiler flocks testing positive. Six of the 14 broiler samples were positive for the IBV S1 gene, but only two isolates were typable by sequencing and showed a high load of IB viral RNA (Ct 1 =22.15 and Ct 2 =31.4). One of the two sequences was identified as the IBDZ13a genotype. Furthermore, IBV was only detected in the kidney tissues and not in the trachea. All samples showed 93% homology to the partial-S1 sequence acquired from (Figure-1) . The IBDZ13a strain was characterized as an IB 4/91 variant IBV with 29 nucleic acid substitutions differing from the known IB 4/91 vaccine reference strain sequence, which corresponded to eight amino acid substitutions relative to this reference strain (Table-3 ). Three of these amino acid substitutions were from a hydrophobic to a hydrophilic amino acid. A change in hydrophilicity altered the epitopes on the S1 protein of the IB DZ13a virus. The predicted epitopes with differences between the field virus and IB 4/91 vaccine strain are shown in Figure- 1.
