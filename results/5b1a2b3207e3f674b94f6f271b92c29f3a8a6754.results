A total of 41 patients were enrolled, including 19 (46.3%) males and 22 (53.6%) females. 2 (4.88%), 32 (78.05%), 4 (9.75%) and 3 (7.32%) patients were diagnosed as light, mild, severe and critical cases, respectively. The median age was 47 years (35.5-64, range between 15-89 years). 18 patients have been discharged, 21 patients are still in hospital and 2 patients died (their ages were 82 and 65). Old adult male patients are more prone to be in severe conditions (P<0.01). The level of lymphocyte percentage of the severe and critical patients was lower than those of light and mild patients. We found that the level of TnI, one of the cardiac biomarkers, is remarkably higher in critical group (P<0.01) than in other groups, indicative of high risk of cardiac injury. The high level of c-reactive protein (CRP) in critical group (P<0.01) indicated that the occurring of acute inflammation. Note that, the renal and hepatic function biomarkers, creatinine (CRE), alanine aminotransferase (AST) and Aspartate aminotransferase (ALT), were statistically significant (P<0.05). Clinical features and laboratory findings were summarized in Table 1 . All these data indicated that COVID-19 could cause multiple organic injury. All rights reserved.
