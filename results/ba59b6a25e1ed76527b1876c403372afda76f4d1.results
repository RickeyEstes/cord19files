During the 12-week observation period, 20,882 students (282,832 student-weeks of observation) were enrolled at the intervention schools in the first through third grades; 23,569 students (250,584 student-weeks) were enrolled at the 30 control schools. All parents approved providing information about their children's illnesses; however, 7,112 parents (16%) did not give permission for the collection of nasal swab specimens from their children, and the distribution was similar in both groups (p>0.05). No significant differences were found for the 2 groups in median age (8 years), sex distribution (51% male), or the median number of students per school (635 [interquartile range 394-978]). One-week baseline data were collected for intervention and control schools 2 weeks before the hand hygiene intervention activities. This step was carried out to test data collection procedures and ensure the collection of good quality data. No significant difference was found between the intervention group and control group in the rate of absenteeism caused by ILI (relative risk 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-1.4) or in the rate of confirmed influenza episodes (relative risk 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.5). During the 12-week observation period, 4,259 students received a diagnosis of ILI in the control and intervention schools ( Figure 1 ). The rate for influenza testing of in-class students who reported ILI was similar in the control and intervention schools (74% and 77%, respectively; p>0.05). The proportion of students tested who were absent because of ILI was only 12% in the control schools, compared with 22% in the intervention group (p<0.01). The rate of laboratory-confirmed influenza was higher among in-class students who reported their illness in the control schools (35%) than the rate in the intervention schools (18%) (p<0.01). Students who were absent because ILI in the control schools showed a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed influenza (27%) than those in the intervention school (7%) (p<0.01). Incidence of absence (per 100 students) caused by ILI was lower in the intervention group than in the control group for weeks 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12. During the first 4-week period, the 2 groups showed no differences in absence incidence caused by diarrhea and conjunctivitis, although the incidence of absence caused by these conditions was significantly lower in the intervention group for weeks 5-8 and weeks 9-12 ( Figure 2 ). During the 12-week observation period, 4,259 students were diagnosed with ILI in the control and intervention schools (n = 2,552 and n = 1,707, respectively). In the control schools, 881 cases (34.5%) of ILI were identified through in-class reported illness and 74.2% of these students (n = 654) were tested for influenza, of which 34.9% (n = 228) were positive. In contrast, 790 cases (46.3%) of ILI in the intervention schools were identified through in-class reporting, and while a similar proportion were (or was) tested for influenza virus (77%) (n = 609), only 18 .4% (n = 112) were positive for influenza virus (p<0.01). In control schools, 65.5% (n = 1,671) of students were absent caused by ILI, of which 11.6% (n = 194) were tested and 27.3% (n = 141) were positive for influenza virus. In the intervention schools, ILI was responsible for 53.7% (n = 917) of absenteeism. Of these 917 students, 199 (21.7%) were tested and only 6.5% (n = 13) were positive for influenza virus (p<0.01). The incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza (A and B) per 1,000 students was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group over the 12 week observation period as well as during weeks 1-4 (p<0.01) 5-8 (p<0.001), and 9-12 (p<0.001) (Figure 3 ). The incidence of influenza A in the intervention group was significantly lower during weeks 1-4 and 5-8, with no statistical difference in weeks 9-12. The incidence of influenza B was significantly lower in the intervention group during weeks 5-8 and 9-12. The largest number of confirmed cases reported from any single school was from a control school where 66 cases were reported (7.24 cases/1,000 student-weeks). Overall, control schools were 1.6× (95% CI 1.1-2.2) more likely to report at least 1 confirmed case of influenza and 2.8× (95% CI 1.7-4.7) more likely to report multiple confirmed cases of influenza than intervention schools. The monitoring teams observed during their regular visits that ≈93% of the students in the intervention schools had soap and drying material available. All intervention schools (except 2) had a rigorous system of ensuring that schoolchildren were washing their hands at least twice daily. (18) . Concern persists regarding the potential for recombination between seasonal influenza and subtype H5N1 strains with resultant rapid transmission of the recombinant strain, especially among high-density populations such as public school students and staff. In addition, nonpharmaceutical interventions, especially hand hygiene to mitigate pandemic (H1N1) 2009 disease spread, have been advocated by international organizations (19) .
