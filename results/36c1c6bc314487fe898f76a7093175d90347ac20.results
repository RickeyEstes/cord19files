Nineteen children included in the group of patients were lost during the study period because parents refused the return every month to the study center and did not adequately collected information regarding respiratory infections of their children. Consequently, 119 patients were considered and compared to controls. Table 2 summarises the demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population. Gender and age distribution was similar between the children with wheezing and controls, and between the children with non-recurrent and recurrent wheezing. Most of the subjects were Caucasian, and all of them had been born at term. The duration of breastfeeding, use of pacifier and having at least one older sibling were similar between the groups, but exposure to cigarette smoke, high IgE levels and a family history of atopy were significantly more frequent among the children with wheezing than the controls (p = 0.002, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001), and a family history of atopy was significantly more frequent among the children with recurrent than those with non-recurrent wheezing (p = 0.001). The selected SNP allele frequencies were similar in the children with any type of wheezing and in the controls, and similar in the children with non-recurrent or recurrent wheezing. All of the examined SNPs were present in the study population. Table 3 shows the SNP genotype frequencies that were significantly different between the children with wheezing and that controls, and Table 4 those that were significantly different between the children with non-recurrent wheezing and those with recurrent wheezing. IL8-rs4073AT, VEGFA-rs833058CT, MBL2-rs1800450CT and IKBKB-rs3747811AT were associated with a significantly increased risk of developing wheezing (p = 0.02, p = 0.03, p = 0.05 and p = 0.0018), whereas CTLA4-rs3087243AG and NFKBIB-rs3136641TT were associated with a significantly reduced risk (p = 0.05 and p = 0.04). IL8-rs4073AT, VEGFA-rs2146 323AA and NFKBIA-rs2233419AG were associated with a significantly increased risk of developing recurrent wheezing (p = 0.04, p = 0.04 and p = 0.03), whereas TLR3-rs3775291TC was associated with a significantly reduced risk (p = 0.03). No other differences in genotype frequencies were found. Table 5 shows the distribution of viral infections in the children with non-recurrent or recurrent wheezing. RSV was the most frequently detected pathogen in the majority
