Serum cobalamin measurements were available for 74 dogs over the study period. A total of 57 cases were excluded due to insufficient stored serum (49 cases) or inappropriate clinical history (8 cases), leaving 17 cases for analysis. Serum C4 measurement was consequently available for 17 dogs with chronic diarrhoea and 20 control dogs. Clinical cases had an age range from 1.5 to 12 years (median 8 years), control dogs had an age range from 1.1 to 12 years (median 5.5 years) and there was no significant difference between the ages of these groups (P=0.170). The breeds of the dogs in both groups are listed in Table 1 . The final diagnosis in the cases with chronic diarrhoea included idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (11 cases), diet-responsive enteropathy (2 cases), antibiotic-responsive enteropathy (2 cases), exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (1 case) and a suspected corona virus infection (1 case). The diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease was based on histopathological examination of gastrointestinal biopsies, most commonly gastric, duodenal and ileal biopsies. The diagnosis of corona virus was based on faecal PCR testing and eventual resolution of clinical signs with symptomatic treatment. Control dogs had a serum C4 range from 15.1 to 180.1 nmol/l (median 80.9 nmol/l), dogs with chronic diarrhoea had a serum C4 range from 21.3 to 518.6 nmol/l (median 59.9 nmol/l) and there was no significant difference in the C4 concentration between these two groups (P=0.8). Figure 1 shows a boxplot of the serum C4 concentration in the two groups. Serum cobalamin and canine chronic enteropathy activity index were available for all clinical cases. Cobalamin concentration ranged from 100 to 834 pg/ml (median 338 pg/ml), and canine chronic enteropathy activity index scores ranged from 4 to 15 (median 7). When assessing the relationship between serum C4 concentration and serum cobalamin, no statistically significant relationship was identified (P=0.6, correlation coefficient=−0.11). There was also no statistically significant relationship between canine chronic enteropathy activity index and serum C4 (P=0.6, correlation coeffi-cient=−0.04). A cut-off value for serum C4 concentration of 187.2 nmol/l on the ROC curve resulted in a specificity of 100 per cent (95 per cent CI 81.5 to 100 per cent) and a sensitivity of 25 per cent (95 per cent CI 5.3 to 48.6 per cent) for presumptive diagnosis of bile acid malabsorption in this group of dogs (Fig 2) , with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100 per cent (95 per cent CI 31 to 100 per cent) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 59 per cent (95 per cent CI 41 to 75 per cent). If 187.2 nmol/l is set as the upper limit of normal, then three (17.6 per cent; 95 per cent CI 6.2 to 41.0 per cent) of the clinical cases with chronic diarrhoea had a serum C4 concentration significantly above this (at least twice this upper limit). The greatest serum C4 concentration (518.6 nmol/l) was observed in an 11-year-old, neutered male border terrier. This dog was diagnosed with suspected inflammatory bowel disease, which was partially, although never fully, responsive to dietary modification and immunosuppressive medication ( prednisolone and azathioprine). This dog had a serum cobalamin concentration within the reference range (550 pg/ml). The second case with a marked serum C4 elevation (438.0 nmol/l) was a 6-year-old, neutered male border collie. This dog had a complex medical history of previous primary hypoparathyroidism and more recent inflammatory bowel disease. Concerns regarding the effect of prednisolone on serum calcium concentrations prevented use of this drug, and so the dog was primarily managed with chlorambucil and dietary modification; however, his diarrhoea was also poorly responsive to this treatment. Interestingly, at a later time this case was trialled on cholestyramine and showed an improvement in faecal consistency; however, a further dietary modification was made at the same time, making the response difficult to interpret. This dog also had significant hypocobalaminaemia (100 pg/ml), suggesting marked distal small intestinal disease. The third case (serum C4 concentration 362.7 nmol/l) was a 5-year-old, neutered female Jack Russell terrier cross. This dog presented for investigation of chronic diarrhoea and panhypoproteinaemia and was diagnosed with idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease. She was treated with prednisolone, chlorambucil and metronidazole, along with dietary modification. This resulted in an improvement of clinical signs and normalisation of serum proteins; however, the diarrhoea persisted intermittently. Malabsorption of bile acids may offer a potential explanation for the limited response of the diarrhoea to therapy; however, no therapeutic trials were ever performed to confirm this. This dog had a serum cobalamin concentration at the lower end of the reference range (310 pg/ml). The remaining 14 clinical cases were treated with a variety of medications, depending on diagnosis and had a range of outcomes. The two cases of antibiotic-responsive enteropathy, two cases of diet-responsive enteropathy, two case of suspected enteric coronavirus and two case of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency were all treated appropriately for those conditions with an excellent response. The eight cases with idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease were treated with a number of medications, including prednisolone alone (five cases), prednisolone with azathioprine (one case), prednisolone with chlorambucil (one case) and prednisolone with ciclosporin (one case). Seven of these eight cases responded well to treatment with good long-term control of clinical signs; one case deteriorated despite therapy resulting in eventual euthanasia. This dog had a low serum C4 level (25.12 nmol/l). Post hoc power analysis was performed and showed that two groups of 76 cases would be required to detect a statistically significant difference (α=0.05 and power, 1−β=0.80) if similar results were obtained in the two groups.
