Here, we present some simple informative analyses to illustrate the integration of HFV database information and alignments with the database web tools. In addition to the Ebola genome browser, the database has about 30 computational tools to assist with sequence manipulation, format and display, statistical and genetic signature analysis, phylogenetic analysis and geographic distributions (Supplementary Table S1 ). These tools were generally adapted from the Los Alamos HIV database; some are general and can be applied to any organism, but are particularly useful here, while others have been specifically adapted to filoviruses. Some examples: HFV BLAST finds sequences similar to the query sequence within the HFV database. HFV Sequence Locator finds the coordinates of the query sequence with respect to the appropriate reference sequence. Genome Mapper generates and displays maps of genomic features for the selected species. Ebola Quickalign aligns short input query sequences (epitopes, functional domains, primers, binding sites or any local region of interest) to the Filovirus Database premade alignments, or to the user's alignment, and summarizes the variability observed at the location of the query sequence. Quickalign processes short continuous query sequences, or discontinuous positions of interest, e.g. to assess variability of conformational antibody epitopes. AnalyzeAlign shows sequence logos (36) , calculates frequency by position and finds variants in an alignment.
