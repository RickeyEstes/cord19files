In vitro antiviral activity of single agents and combinations against influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) in a CPE assay Oseltamivir, sertraline and rolipram were evaluated for antiviral activity against influenza A/NWS/33 in a cytopathic assay using MDCK cells. The IC 50 of oseltamivir was determined to be 3.47 mM (Figure 1 ). Eight different concentrations of oseltamivir ranging from 0.03 to 100 mM were then combined with different concentrations of sertraline (0.03-10 mM) and rolipram (0.3-100 mM). The drugs used at these concentrations were not cytotoxic as demonstrated by the cell viability assay. Neither sertraline nor rolipram were found to have any antiviral activity as single agents (Figure 1 ). Table 1 shows that the potency of oseltamivir was not increased in the presence of either sertraline or rolipram. The data are represented as fold change in IC 50 of oseltamivir with sertraline or rolipram as compared to that of oseltamivir alone. The statistical significance of this fold change was calculated by the extra sum of squares F test and P,0.05 was considered to be significant. 24 The viral replication inhibition observed with the combinations was not significantly superior to that of oseltamivir alone. It emerged from these experiments that the increased survival in the combination group observed in the earlier experiment was not due to the enhanced antiviral activity of the combination.
