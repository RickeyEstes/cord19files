A total of 350 primary SARS cases from 22 Chinese provinces were included in this study. Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of their corresponding meteorological variables and the air pollution variable. Univariate logistic regression results are presented in Table 2 . DAT (odds ratio (OR) ¼ 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60, 0.86; Po0.001), DAAP (OR ¼ 0.57, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.65; Po0.001), and DARH (OR ¼ 0.60, 95% CI: 0.50, 0.71; Po0.001) were inversely significantly associated with secondary attack rate. In addition, a significant positive association was found for DHS (OR ¼ 1.38, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.64; Po0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis (Table 3) , factors independently associated with secondary attack rate were DAAP (OR ¼ 0.53, 95% CI: 0.42, 0.66; Po0.001), DARH (OR ¼ 0.73, 95% CI: 0.53, 1.00; P ¼ 0.047), and DAWV (OR ¼ 0.81, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.96; P ¼ 0.014). The time variable, i.e. onset time of a primary case, was considered as a potential confounding factor. Adjustment for the time variable led to little change in the results. The space variable, i.e. affected area that a primary case was from, was also considered as a potential confounding factor. To avoid the potential confounding effect from the space variable, we further selected two major affected areas in China, Hebei Province and Inner Mongolia, to repeat the multivariate logistic regression analyses. The regression models included all meteorological variables and API variable with adjustment for the time variable (Table 4 ). In Hebei Province, a total of 135 primary probable SARS cases and their 2856 close contacts during the period of their clinical symptoms before admission were included in the data analysis. Of the 2856 close contacts, 44 (1.5%) later developed clinical symptoms and were diagnosed as probable SARS cases. Only DAWV (OR ¼ 0.38, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.72; P ¼ 0.003) was found to be a significant predictor of secondary attack rate with adjustment for the time variable. In Inner Mongolia, a total of 65 primary probable SARS cases and their 698 close contacts during association between the SARS outbreak and meteorological factors and air pollution have largely been inconclusive. 3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] In the present study, the secondary attack rate before admission of the primary case, whose variation may have resulted from the impact of meteorological factors and air pollution, was used as a dependent variable instead of the daily reported number of SARS cases. Further, the actual onset data rather than the reported data were used to explore the association between secondary attack rate before admission of the primary SARS cases and the meteorological factors and air pollution. The results of this study indicate that secondary attack rate before admission of the primary case was significantly inversely associated with DAWV, and that DAAP, DARH and DHS may also influence the SARS outbreak to some extent. We believe that our results should be of sufficient reliability.
