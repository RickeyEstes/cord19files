Using the quantitative simulation framework developed, we calculated the probability of cases arising in the future on various numbers of days after the outcome of the last detected case. We considered different scenarios (summarized in Web Table 1 ) by varying the offspring distribution of the outbreak, the length of the onsetto-outcome delay period, reporting rate, and assumed transmission scenario. Figure   2 shows the number of days taken (from the outcome of the last detected case) for the probability of cases arising in the future to fall below 5%, for six different offspring distributions. Our simulations show that the underlying offspring distribution during the 'decline' period of the outbreak is the most determinant factor in how long it takes for the probability of cases arising in the future dropped below 5%.
