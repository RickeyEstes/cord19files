Patient 1, a 64-year-old man, had undergone renal transplantation in 1998 for end-stage renal failure secondary to diabetes. His treatments associated mycophenolate mofetil, ciclosporin, and prednisone. Clinical symptoms began on April 22; he was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated on April 30. On May 8, the patient required implementation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and died on May 28 of refractory multiple organ failure. Patient 2, a 51-year-old man, was admitted on April 26. His medical history included a histamine-induced angioedema treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. Patient 2 shared patient 1's room from April 26 to April 29. On May 8, patient 2 presented with asthenia, myalgia, and cough. On May 12, he was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit of the Lille University teaching hospital. ECMO was implemented with on May 14 for refractory hypoxemia despite optimal treatment. The patient was successfully weaned off ECMO on June 17. On July 2, percutaneous tracheotomy was performed. Currently, the patient is able to breathe spontaneously 12 hours per day but requires 3 days intermittent haemodialysis per week. We analysed the expression of the main receptors and regulators involved in the recognition of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from Coronaviridae in the cells isolated from the initial BAL samples of patients 1 and 2. Day 0 is the onset of clinical symptoms compatible with MERS-CoV infection (fever, rigors, chills) for each patient. Here we show that patient 1 could not induce the expression of the key receptors, RIG-1 and MDA-5 ( Figure 1A and 1B), in response to MERS-CoV infection. Moreover, IRF3 and IRF7 expression were decreased ( Figure 1C and 1D) leading to a dramatically decreased IFNa expression ( Figure 1E ), without any difference in IFNb expression ( Figure 1F ). IFNa secretion in BAL supernatants and serum was consistent with the previous findings, IFNa levels were decreased in sera and BAL from patient 1 compared to patient 2 ( Figure 1G ). None of these markers were activated in control, HSV and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. Viral stimulation of pulmonary antigen presenting cells such as alveolar macrophages or dendritic cells leads to the secretion of IL-12 and contributes to activate T lymphocytes into CD4+ T helper-1 (Th1) lymphocytes. Recognition by IL-12R on T CD4+ Th1 cells promotes secretion of IFNc that contributes to the early immune response by inducing death of infected cells and activating two key cells involved in viral clearance, CD8+ T effectors and Natural Killer (NK) cells [9, 13] . Here we report that IL-12 and IFNc levels were decreased in BAL supernatants of patient 1 compared to patient 2 ( Figure 2A) . Furthermore, the kinetic analysis of IL-12 and IFNc levels in the sera after infection shows that patient 2 promoted an early Th1 response mediated by IL-12 and IFNc in response to MERS-CoV ( Figure 2B ). Conversely, patient 1 did not increase IL-12 and IFNc in BAL or sera. Interestingly, the analysis of MERS-CoV load in the serum by quantitative PCR shows that while patient 2 rapidly cleared the virus in this compartment, the virus remains detectable in the serum of patient 1 until death ( Figure 2C ). We also measured serum levels of CXCL10, an epithelial chemokine, and IL-10, since these two cytokines were associated with a poor outcome during viral infection and particularly SARS-CoV acute respiratory infection [7, [14] [15] [16] . In fact, poor outcome was correlated with uncontrolled and durable IL-10 and CXCL10 secretion [7, 14] . Consistent with these findings, we found that both patients initially promoted IL-10 and CXCL10 secretion in response to MERS-CoV ( Figure 3 ). However, while for patient 2 the response was transient for both IL-10 and CXCL10 during the first week following the onset of the first symptoms, patient 1 had a persistent increase of IL-10 and CXCL10 levels. In a recent study, Josset et al. demonstrated, in an in vitro microarray analysis, that MERS-CoV could promote IL-17A expression compared to SARS-CoV [17] . Consistent with these findings, we report that MERS-CoV increases the expression of IL-17A in the lungs ( Figure 4A ). We assessed the secretion of IL-17A in BAL supernatants and showed that IL-17A secretion was increased in both patients in response to MERS-CoV ( Figure 4B) , with higher level for patient 1 compared to patient 2. We hypothesized the involvement of IL-23 secretion, known in humans to trigger IL-17 secretion in response to viruses [18, 19] . To this end, we assessed IL-23 secretion in the lungs and found that IL-23 secretion was significantly increased in BAL from patient 1 compared to patient 2 ( Figure 4B ). Finally, we found elevated IL-23 and IL-17A levels in the serum of patient 1, in the first days following the infection by MERS-CoV ( Figure 4C ). Interestingly, IL-23 secretion was increased in the BAL supernatant of patient 2 during HSV replication. many questions that remain to be answered, options for treatment are a major concern for the medical community. Although it is very difficult to draw a simple line from a clinical observation to a therapeutic protocol, the analysis of the host response is a cornerstone in the design of relevant approaches. This report characterizes the immune response of two patients with different outcomes and highlights the critical role of IFNa in the innate immune response to orchestrate an early adaptive Th-1 response, mediated by IL-12 and IFNc, against MERS-CoV infection.
