The total number of active holdings per year decreased slightly from 47,212 holdings in 2012 to 44,688 holdings in 2015. Out of those holdings 84.1% were farms, 15.1% alpine pastures, 0.24% dealers and 0.58% markets. The decrease in the number of holdings over the years is mainly due to a loss of active farms at a rate of about 800 farms per year, reflecting the general consolidation trends in the European livestock economy. In total, the Tierverkehr Datenbank recorded between 619,273 transports of animals from one holding to another in 2012 and 598,659 transports in 2015 ( Table 2 ). During the four-year study period 52.4% of Swiss cattle farms participated in the summering practice. Overall 20.2% of the alps hosted animals from a single farm, while the remaining 79.8% of alps hosted animals from several (median: 4 farms, inter quartile range: 2-8) farms. Likewise, 44.2% of cattle farms participated in markets by either selling or purchasing animals at markets. At a typical market, one can find animals from 120 (median; IQR: 44-262) different farms. The number of active holdings (Fig. 1) shows a clear seasonality with one peak in early summer and a second one in autumn, coinciding with the summering pattern. The seasonal pattern mainly disappears after excluding alps except for a trough in summer that is still visible for the farms-only data.
