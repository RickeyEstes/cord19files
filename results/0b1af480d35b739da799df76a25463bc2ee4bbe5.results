The green pigment synthesized during conidiation in T. marneffei is dihydroxynaphthalene melanin To examine if the green coloration of conidia was attributed to DHN-melanin, T. marneffei conidia were inoculated onto medium with or without the inhibitor tricyclazole. Tricyclazole inhibits the two hydroxynaphthalene reductases functioning in DHN-melanin synthetic pathway ( Fig 1A) [23] [24] [25] . In the absence of tricyclazole, T. marneffei conidia appeared green ( Fig 1B) . In contrast, in a presence of tricyclazole, the T. marneffei conidia appeared yellow (Fig 1B) . This suggests that the synthesis of DHN-melanin contributes to the green coloration of conidia during asexual development. The T. marneffei genome encodes ten multicopper oxidases Laccases are members of the multicopper oxidase (MCO) family, which also includes ferroxidases and ascorbate oxidases. To identify laccase encoding genes in T. marneffei the C. neoformans Lac1 and A. fumigatus Abr2 (Fig 2A) encoding genes were used as a query sequence in blast searches of the T. marneffei ATCC 18224 genome sequence (GenBank, NCBI). This identified two highly homologous genes (PMAA_072680 and PMAA_085520) (Cnlac1 homology of 88% and 78%, respectively) that were then also used for additional blast searches to retrieve related sequences in the T. marneffei genome. These homology searches identified 10 genes encoding putative multicopper oxidases (PMAA_008350, PMAA_050860, PMAA_055370, PMAA_057450, PMAA_062880, PMAA_072680, PMAA_082010, PMAA_082060, PMAA_085520, and PMAA_100410). Generally, laccases contain four copper atoms including type1 Cu, type 2 Cu, and a pair of type 3 Cu. The patterns of conserved amino acids coordinated with each type of copper are HXHG, HXH, HCHXXXHXXXM/F/L, and HXXHXH, which occupy the L1-L4 signature sequences starting from the N-terminus [34] [35] [36] . We found that 9 of the T. marneffei MCOs (excluding PMAA_062880) have these conserved patterns (see S1 Fig) . Previous phylogenetic studies reveal that MCO sequences are often clustered with other genes according to function, fungal division, and source organism [10, 11, 13] . To predict which T. marneffei MCO participates in conidial DHN-melanin synthesis, we combined 55 fungal MCO sequences and performed alignments using CLUSTALW (http://www.genome.jp/ tools/clustalw/). Tree construction was conducted in MEGA version 6 [37] using the Neighbor--Joining method. The 55 fungal MCO sequences were separated into 5 clades with wellsupported branches (>90% bootstrap support) (Fig 2A) . Each clade was highlighted and named according to sequences with known functions and fungal divisions. The ascomycete laccase lineage can be divided into 2 clades supported with very high bootstrap values (99% and 100%). Focusing on the second clade containing T. marneffei PbrB, this clade comprises of characterized laccases functioning in conidial DHN-melanin synthesis. T. marneffei PbrB is more closely related to A. fumigatus Abr2 than A. nidulans YA [16] [17] [18] . pbrB is expressed during asexual development and localizes to all cell types of the conidiophore The expression of pbrB was investigated by RT-PCR. RNA samples were extracted from T. marneffei F4 grown in BHI broth at 28°C and 37°C for 3 days. A transcript was not detected under these conditions suggesting there is little or no pbrB expression in vegetative hyphal or yeast cells (data not shown). To analyze pbrB expression further, a strain was generated that expresses a fusion construct in which pbrB, expressed from the native promoter, is fused to GFP (pbrB(p)::pbrB::GFP). Conidia of the pbrB(p)::pbrB::GFP strain were inoculated into BHI broth and cultured at 28°C and 37°C for 3 days. In support of the RT PCR analysis, GFP fluorescence was not detected in vegetative hyphal cells at 28°C or vegetative yeast cells at 37°C nlm.nih.gov/protein/) and used to build sequence alignments in CLUSTALW. The alignment was then used to construct a relatedness tree using MEGA 6 software. Phylogenetic relationships of the 55 MCOs were inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method and bootstrap tested (1000 replicates). Branch lengths of the tree under standard conditions (Fig 3A and 3B ). In addition, vegetative cells were grown at 28°C and 37°C in a variety of other types of medium (ANM, Synthetic Dextrose and Malt Extract) and in the presence of copper with low glucose (0.2%) or under acidic condition pH 5.0, which are known laccase inducing conditions [38] . No signal from PbrB::GFP could be detected under any of these conditions after 3, 5 and 7 days of incubation (data not shown). A slide culture of the pbrB(p)::pbrB::GFP strain was prepared to observe expression of pbrB during conidiation. Compared to the negative control (Fig 3C) , strong GFP fluorescence was observed in conidiophores of the pbrB(p)::pbrB::GFP strain, suggesting that PbrB is expressed during asexual development (Fig 3D) . The PbrB::GFP protein was localized as distinct spots in metulae and phialides (Fig 3D) . To investigate if PbrB co-localizes with melanin, melanin was detected in the pbrB(p)::pbrB:: GFP strained by immunolabeling with an anti-melanin antibody. Immunostaining detected strong fluorescence in phialide cells with some weaker staining in the stalk, metulae and conidial cell types. There was also some punctate melanin staining in the various cell types. This staining are drawn to scale and bootstrap support indicating at the branch sites. Fungal MCOs that share a common ancestry with more than 60% bootstrap value are shaded in gray. Functions are defined at each clade based on characterized function of MCO members. (B) A partial alignment representing the conserved motifs of copper binding sites and L1-L4 signature sequences found in T. marneffei PbrB (PMAA_082060) and its orthologs A. fumigatus Abr2 (AFUA_2G17530) and A. nidulans YA (AN6635). The numbers in front of each sequence indicate the amino acid position of a particular protein. Cu binding motifs are identified above the sequences, numbers including 1, 2, and 3 are type 1 Cu, type 2 Cu, and type 3 Cu. The asterisk indicates the potential proton donor for the reaction intermediates. was highly co-localised with the fluorescence form the PbrB::GFP fusion protein (Fig 4) . This supports the hypothesis that PbrB is likely to be involved in melanin biosynthesis during conidiation.
