ACE-2 enzyme activity is reduced in Alzheimer's disease in association with increasing Aβ load and tau pathology ACE-2 activity was significantly reduced by approximately 50% in the mid-frontal cortex in AD compared with age-matched controls (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1a) . ACE-2 varied according to disease severity when the controls and AD cases were grouped and stratified into the following Braak tangle stage groups: 0-II, III-IV, and V-VI (P < 0.0001 by ANOVA). Post hoc analysis using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons revealed that ACE-2 activity was significantly reduced in Braak tangle stages V-VI compared with stages 0-II (P < 0.0001) and stages III-IV (P < 0.05) (Fig. 1b) . No difference was observed between Braak stages 0-II and stages III-IV. In a combined AD and control cohort, ACE-2 activity correlated inversely with total insoluble Aβ levels (r = −0.267, P < 0.01) (Fig. 1c) but not with soluble Aβ (data not shown). ACE-2 correlated inversely with βsecretase activity (r = −0.277 P < 0.001) (Additional file 3: Figure S2 ). ACE-2 correlated inversely with p-tau load (r = 0.327, P < 0.01) (Fig. 1d) . ACE-2 activity is reduced in relation to APOE and ACE1 polymorphisms and CAA severity ACE-2 activity was significantly lower in individuals possessing an APOE ε4 allele, an established genetic risk factor for sporadic AD [49] , than in those without (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2a) . ACE-2 activity also differed significantly Post hoc analysis revealed that ACE-2 activity was reduced in Braak tangle stages V-VI compared with stages 0-II and III-IV (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.05 respectively) and in Braak tangle stages III-IV compared with stages 0-II, but the difference was not statistically different. The bars indicate the mean value and SEM. c and d Scatterplots showing that ACE-2 activity was inversely correlated with insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) load (measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) (r = −0.267, P < 0.01) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) load (measured by field fraction analysis) (r = −0.327, P < 0.001). The solid inner line indicates the best-fit linear regression and the outer lines the 95% confidence intervals. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001. rfu Relative fluorescence units between ACE1 (rs1799752) indel genotypes (P < 0.05), with individuals who were homozygous II for ACE-1 (previously associated with increased risk for AD [17] ) having the lowest ACE-2 activity, although post hoc analysis revealed that this did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 2b) . We assessed ACE-2 activity in relation to CAA severity and found, as for ACE-1 activity [4] , a tendency, although not significant, towards increased ACE-2 activity in cases with moderate to severe CAA compared with absent to mild CAA (P = 0.08) (Fig. 2c) . ACE-2 is inversely correlated with ACE-1, and the ratio of ACE-1 to ACE-2 is increased in Alzheimer's disease ACE-2 activity correlated inversely with ACE-1 activity in a combined AD and control cohort (r = −0.453, P > 0.0001) (Fig. 3a) . The same pattern was observed and remained statistically significant when the control (r = −0.390, P < 0.05) and AD (r = −0.257, P < 0.05) groups were analysed separately. Previous reports have suggested the ratio of ACE-1 to ACE-2 is a good proxy measure for the activation status of classical and regulatory RAS pathways [33] . With this in mind, we calculated the ACE-1/ACE-2 ratio for all cases and found that it was significantly increased in AD compared with controls (P > 0.0001) (Fig. 3b) . The ACE-1/ACE-2 ratio also correlated positively with insoluble Aβ level, approaching significance (r = 0.199, P = 0.059) (Fig. 3c) , and significantly with p-tau (r = 0.252, P < 0.05) (Fig. 3d) . The ACE-1/ACE-2 ratio was increased in individuals possessing an APOE ε4 allele, approaching significance (P = 0.093) (Fig. 3e) , and differed significantly according to ACE1 (rs1799752) indel polymorphism (P < 0.01). Post hoc analysis revealed that the ratio was significantly higher in individuals with ACE1 II (AD risk factor) than in DD (P < 0.01) and in ID than in DD (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3f) .
