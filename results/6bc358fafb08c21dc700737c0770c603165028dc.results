Ea'pression and selection of random sequences Fig. ! shows the insertion of the random 17nucleotide sequence between the Smal and Hindlil sites of pCL627. These sites are situated at the 3' end of a truncated cro-lacZ fusion gene. Gene expression leads to a random hexapeptide sequence n*2ar the C terminus of the hybrid cro-/]-galactostdase protein. In the same way, random octapep~.ides were produced by insertion of a 23-nucleotide random sequence. Presumably, the proline and glycine residues encoded by the Smal site favour a surface exposure of the peptide. Nucleotide sequencing of 15 clones that were randomly selected from the hexapeptide library showed that 11 clones carried one oligonueleotide insert, two carried two oligonucleotides and two had smaller inserts. As shown below, most of the clones that were selected by monoclonal antibodies carried shorter inserts, while none of the clones conformed exactly to the structure shown in Fig. 1 . Presumably, these deviations resulted from errors during the oligonudeotide synthesis or from anomalous annealing events during the library construction. Furthermore, the binding requirements of a mAb may select clones with specific deviations, e.g., clones without intact Sinai sites (see below). As shown in Fig. 1 , stop codons in all three reading frames end the translation irrespective of the length of the insert. To date, all clones isolated from the octapeptide bank contained single inserts (unpublished results).
