Fifty patients were recruited from a pool of 457 ICU discharges screened for participation over a 2-year period (Fig. 1 ). Of the 121 eligible patients who were approached, 59% declined to participate. The commonest reason for declining to participate was a reluctance to undergo further clinical investigations unless absolutely necessary. Characteristics of the enrolled patients and comparison with nonenrolled patients are shown in Table 1 , and premorbid comorbidities of participating patients are presented in Table E1 . All 50 enrolled patients completed a CPET. No patient had any adverse event during testing. The mean time from hospital discharge to CPET was 24 ± 14 days (all data presented as mean ± SD unless otherwise stated). In 70% of cases, the reason given for cessation of pedaling was leg fatigue; shortness of breath accounted for most of the remainder (26%). One patient had to stop because of back pain, and one, because of anxiety. Baseline spirometry showed an FEV 1 of 2.2 ± 0.9 L/min (mean predicted FEV 1 , 2.9 L/min) and an forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3.0 ± 0.8 L/min (mean predicted FVC, 3.6 L/min); the mean FEV 1 /FVC ratio was 74%. Individual patient CPET data are shown in Table E1 . Peak VO 2 was 56% ± 16% predicted (13.8 ± 4.0 mL/kg per minute VO 2 ), and AT was 41% ± 13% of peak predicted VO 2 (10.4 ± 2.7 mL/kg per minute O 2 ). It was not possible to determine the AT for 7 patients. At peak exercise, HRR was 25% ± 14%; BR at peak exercise was 47 ± 19%; and the RER was 0.96 ± 0.11. The EqCO 2 was 39 ± 9. Mean hemoglobin concentration at the time of hospital discharge was 10.3 ± 1.2 g/dL. Of 50 patients, 18 (36%) were taking rate-limiting medication at the time of the test. The mean oxygen pulse at peak exercise was 8.6 ± 2.5 mL per beat (74% predicted). The difference in oxygen consumption between patients who stopped because of shortness of breath and those stopping because of leg fatigue did not reach statistical significance (AT: 9.4 ± 1.9 vs 10.7 ± 3.0 mL/kg per minute O 2 , P = .23; peak VO 2 : 12.9 ± 3.0 vs 14.1 ± 4.4 mL/kg per minute O 2 , P = .36). Comparison of the prospectively stratified subgroups (Fig. 2) showed that patients ventilated for 14 days or more had a significantly lower AT than those ventilated for 5 to 14 days (9.6 ± 3.2 vs 11.7 ± 2.2 mL/kg per minute O 2 , P = .009) and a significantly lower peak VO 2 (12.9 ± 3.7 vs 15.3 ± 4.2 mL/kg per minute O 2 , P = .023). Ventilatory limitation to exercise was defined as present if either of the 2 following criteria were met: 1. V E at peak exercise was greater than 80% of indirectly measured MVV (or BR b20%), 2. Indirectly measured MVV minus V E at peak exercise was less than 12 L/min. Five patients demonstrated evidence of ventilatory limitation to exercise based on these criteria. One patient demonstrated significant desaturation during exercise from baseline levels (N4%). All patients completed an SF-36v2 questionnaire; mean PCS and MCS scores were 32 ± 8 and 37 ± 11, respectively. Only 1 patient had an MCS score greater than 50 (the population norm), and only 4 patients had a PCS score greater than 50. There was no significant correlation between exercise capacity, measured by either peak VO 2 or AT, and either PCS or MCS.
