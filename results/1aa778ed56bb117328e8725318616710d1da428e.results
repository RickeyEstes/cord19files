Overall Structure of MERS-4 and Its MERS-4V2 Variant Bound to the RBD We previously reported that the human monoclonal antibody MERS-4 targets the RBD of the spike glycoprotein and exhibits strong neutralization activity against live and pseudotyped MERS-CoV infection (Jiang et al., 2014) . However, the yield of MERS-4 from the transfected HEK293F cells was rather low (<1 mg/L), hampering our efforts toward detailed structural analysis. To identify a variant with improved productivity, we generated a library of mutant MERS-4 comprising random replacements in the 5-residue-long CDR3 region, displayed on the surface of yeast, and selected for binding to the RBD through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based sorting as described previously (Jiang et al., 2014) . Among a total of 17 selected mutants, only the variant MERS-4V2 demonstrated a substantial improvement of productivity (>10-fold) while maintaining potency as strong as that of the original MERS-4 in neutralizing pseudotyped virus and binding the S trimer (Figure S1A) . Sequence analysis showed that the original CDR3 residues Ala-Gly-Asn-Asp (AGND) of MERS-4 were replaced by Thr-Asn-Thr-Tyr (TNTY) in MERS-4V2 ( Figure S1B ). To study the overall structure of antibodies bound to the RBD, we expressed MERS-4 and MERS-4V2 in HEK293F cells and obtained the corresponding Fab fragments. The antibody and RBD complexes were formed by mixing the MERS-4 or MERS-4V2 Fab with the RBD. However, despite our repeated efforts in optimizing and screening more than 200 crystals, we were only able to obtain X-ray diffraction data of RBD in complex with MERS-4 Fab at 4.5 Å and with MERS-4V2 Fab at 7 Å . Nevertheless, we solved the structure of the MERS-4 Fab/RBD complex (PDB: 5ZXV) and refined it to R work and R free factors of 30.2% and 34.4%, respectively ( Figure S2A ; Table S1 ). We went further to construct an scFv version of MERS-4V2 and replaced the MERS-4V2 Fab during complex formation with RBD. The structure of the MERS-4V2 scFv/ RBD complex (PDB: 5YY5) was successfully solved to a resolution of 2.8 Å with R work and R free factors of 24.7% and 27.7%, respectively ( Figure S2B ; Table S1 ). As shown in Figure 1A , MERS-4 Fab and MERS-4V2 scFv shared the same mode of binding to the RBD. A superimposition of MERS-4 Fab with MERS-4V2 scFv revealed that their respective recognition was largely mediated through interactions with the b5-b6, b6-b7, and b7-b8 loops in the receptor-binding subdomain of the RBD ( Figure 1B ). Negligible structural differences were found between the two, with an overall root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.6 Å for 204 aligned Ca atoms. At the binding interface, the b7-b8 loop of RBD inserted into the cavity between the antibody heavy and light chains, forming interactions with all CDR loops of the antibody except for HCDR3 ( Figures  1C and 1D ). In particular, the short b5-b6 loop interacted with the HCDR1 and HCDR2 loops of the antibody heavy chain, and the long b6-b7 loop predominately interacted with the LCDR2 loop of the antibody light chain (Figures 1C and 1D) . Structural Features at the Binding Interface between MERS-4V2 and the RBD We conducted a detailed analysis of structural features at the binding interface derived from the MERS-4V2 scFv/RBD complex (Figures 2 and S2C ). At the binding interface, 16 MERS-4V2 scFV residues from all 6 CDR except for HCRD3 formed contacts with 15 residues from the b5-b6, b6-b7, and b7-b8 loops of the receptor-binding subdomain of the RBD (Figure 2A ; Table S2 ). Specifically, the RBD residues Leu507 and Ser508 from the b5-b6 loop interacted with Ser30, Asn31, and Tyr53 from the heavy chain ( Figure 2B ; Table S2 ). The RBD residues Gln516, Asn519, Asn521, Gln522, Tyr523, and Pro525 from the b6-b7 loop interacted with Tyr50, Trp51, Asp53, Gln54, Arg55, and Asp61 from the antibody light chain (Figures 2C and 2D;  Table S2 ). Furthermore, the RBD residues Lys543, and Leu545 to Gly550 from the b7-b8 loop interacted with Ala33, Tyr35, Tyr53, and Tyr59 from the heavy chain, as well as Asn32, Tyr33, Tyr35, Trp51, and Trp92 from the light chain (Figures 2B  and 2E; Table S2 ). Among all interactions at the interface, one example of hydrophobic interactions involved Leu548 (RBD b7-b8 loop), Tyr35 (heavy chain), Tyr35 (light chain), and Trp92 (light chain) (Figures 2B and 2E; Table S2 ). Examples of hydrogen bonds included Ser508 (RBD b5-b6 loop) to Tyr53 (heavy chain), Asn519 (RBD b6-b7 loop) to Tyr50 (light chain), Asn521 (RBD b6-b7 loop) to Asp61 (light chain), and Gln522 (RBD b6-b7 loop) to Arg55 (light chain) (Figures 2B-2D; Table S2 ). As indicated above, the HCDR3 appeared not to be involved in the RBD interaction within a distance cutoff of 4.0 Å . This may explain the unchanged neutralizing and binding activities of MERS-4V2 compared with the parental MERS-4 despite the four-residue replacement in the HCDR3 (Figures S1A and S1B).
