Sterol analysis of Petrosia weinbergi was performed with the goal of isolating the rare cyclopropyl sterol that is the biosynthetic precursor to antiviral steroids 4, 6, and 7. The sterols of Petrosia weinbergi were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. The structures of all sterols were unambiguously assigned by comparison of the spectra with those of authentic samples ( Table 1) . The cyclopropyl sterol 13 was isolated as 6.6% of the total Petrosia weinbergi sterols. The identity of this sterol with the (24S,28S)-isomer (13) was determined by comparison with authentic synthetic samples. The (24R,28S)-and (24S,28R)-(10,11) configurations of the cyclopropyl side chain were easily ruled out based on differences in the 1 H-NMR spectra ( Table 2 ) [15] . The 1 H-NMR spectra of the (24R,28R)-and (24S,28S)-isomers (12 and 13) , however, are very similar, but can be distinguished by the C-29 methyl signals, which are found at 1.075 ppm and 1.080 ppm, respectively (Fig. 1) . Comparison of the isolated cyclopropyl sterol with authentic 13 by 1 H-NMR showed that these were identical [15] .
