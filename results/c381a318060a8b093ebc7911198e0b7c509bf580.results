Overall, 102 papers were included in the analysis (Fig 2) . Analysis of the findings and synthesis of the challenges in formulating new methods are summarised below. Analysis: Seven particular scientific questions addressed by the review 1) What are the main water-associated pathogens investigated and where do they occur? Fig 3 shows the frequency of pathogens in the final set of papers. Vibrio cholerae has been studied most for climate and weather effects. A significant proportion (approximately 20% of papers) focused on unspecified water-associate pathogens and these studies were mostly theoretical process-based models. The next significant categories of studies were papers that looked at diarrheal illness as a broad category based on health service data that did not include pathogen-specific information. In terms of pathogen -specific outcomes, the following pathogens were most studied (after Vibrio cholerae): Cryptosporidium spp., Leptospira spp., Schistosoma spp. Giardia sp. and Salmonella spp. Many of these are classified as NTD [2-4] e.g. Vibrio cholerae, Leptospira spp., Schistosoma spp. Giardia sp. (Table 1) . Fig 4 shows the countries where the studies were based. A good proportion of these theoretical process-based models did not link their study with any data for diseases occurring in a particular country (therefore, the outcome was listed as "General" in Fig 4) . The country with the most studies (about 10% of papers) was Bangladesh, mostly in relation to cholera, followed by studies on disease data collected in US, China and Canada (Fig 4) . Thus, the pathogens reported in these studies reflect geographic (origin of infections) and socio-economic (quality of data) features: studies on cholera were associated with low and middle income countries, while Cryptosporidium spp. and Campylobacter spp. were more likely reported in high income countries that have good laboratory-based passive surveillance systems (Fig 4) . 2) What methods have been used? The set of all technical keywords describing the methods used in at least two papers is displayed in a keyword network in Fig 5 ( a high-resolution image for the methods used in each paper can be found in the Supporting Information, S1 Fig, see also S1 Table) . The figure suggests that the most commonly used methods can be grouped into two main clusters: • Process-Based Models (PBM), which are typically described by mechanistic compartmental models [14] , • Time series and spatial epidemiology (TS-SE) such as time series and regression analysis [15] and spatial methods typically based on geographic information system (GIS) [16] . These clusters can overlap. For examples, instances of spatial compartmental models have been developed. Fig 5 is perhaps the most objective way of representing the methods used in the reviewed papers as it is based simply on the technical keywords recorded by their authors. As the technical keywords can be very specific, the next exercise was to identify the general methods used in the papers. A list of the most common general methods is shown in Fig 6 and in S1 Table in the Supporting Information. The entries in Fig 6 and S1 Table do not reflect an established"taxonomy" of the methods (which is not available in the literature); they are mainly guided by the patterns which emerged from keyword network ( Fig 5) and selected based on their potential relevance for the study of the effects of weather and climate. For example, a close inspection of Fig 5 suggests that a substantial number of papers in the PBM clusters employed "Dose-Response Model" (which often use environmental variables, such as temperature as inputs); we therefore identified "Models comprising Exposure-Response Relantionship" as a general method. The same principle guided the structure of Table 3 , which presents some key features of the clusters of methods. In Table 3 , however, we did not discuss methods such as "Descriptive Statistics" and "Survey/Surveillance/Sampling" since these were too generic in terms of their use Challenges with methods for water-associated disease Each dot corresponds to a reviewed paper; the brown bubbles correspond to the keywords describing the techniques. A connection between a paper and a keyword occurs when the related technique is used. The size of the bubble increases (logarithmically) with the number of papers citing the keyword. For visual purpose only, i) the bubbles are displayed with different shades of brown and ii) the technical keywords (listed in S1 Table in the Supporting Information) describing methods used by only one paper are not displayed (the full set is shown in S1 Fig in the Supporting Information). The graph was produced by using the i-graph package [13] in R. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005659.g005 Challenges with methods for water-associated disease for investigating the effect of weather and/or climate change on water-associated diseases. Conversely, the table contains additional entries that did not emerge from the patterns from Fig 5, but we recognized that they are important for such use (e.g. "Investigation of seasonality" and separation of "Time Series Regression" in short and long term studies). Process-based methods (PBM). Most PBM are based on compartmental models, i.e. a subdivision of the entire population into relevant epidemiological categories, such as susceptible, infected, and recovered people [14] . The population dynamics of each category is usually governed by a system of non-linear differential equations (with each single equation corresponding Challenges with methods for water-associated disease [14] . When the models are applied to water-borne diseases, often include an additional compartment describing the dynamic of the pathogen population in the environment. This category is usually indicated by W (water) or B (bacteria). Infections occur when a susceptible individual comes in contact with this additional category of with the infected category (for human-tohuman transmission). Infected people can excrete pathogens, and feed back into the environment compartment. The acronyms (SIR, SEIR, SIB etc.) reflect the specific epidemiological compartments considered. These models typically uses differential equations to estimate the number of individuals in each compartment at any time, but other techniques such as Agent Based Models or difference equations could be employed. These models are fully specified by a set of parameters (e.g. transmission, recover, mortality rate etc.) that regulate the transition from one compartment to another. Many of these parameters depend on environmental variables such as temperature. When the functional form of the parameter vs. the environmental variable is known, investigation of the effect of weather and/or climate change on the epidemics is straightforward. Models Comprising Exposure-Response Relationship The keywords describing approaches for exposure-response relationship ("Beta-Poisson models", "Dose-Response models", "Exposure Model") also belong to the cluster PBM. In fact many papers that employ exposure-response relationship are integrated with compartmental models as a separate module governing the pathogen dynamics in the environment compartment. In the present context, exposure-response relationships relate the magnitude of a stressor (e.g. concentration of a pathogen in the water reservoir) to the response of the receptor (e.g. probability of getting infected). The effect of weather/climate on the exposure-response curve can be direct (e.g. an increase in water load due to rainfall results in a diluted concentration affecting the response) or indirect (e.g. when the functional form of the exposure-response curve depends on weather/ climatic variables) Stability Analysis All papers employing stability analysis (identified by keywords "Global Stability", "Local Stability", "Bifurcation") are connected within the cluster PBM. This is not surprising as standard CMs are based on sets of differential equations, which is the appropriate environment for stability analysis [85] . Stability analysis studies if all sufficiently small disturbances away from the equilibrium solution (e.g. a fixed or periodic population), damp out in time [86] . This property depends on the parameter of the system and a variation of a parameter of the system can lead to a transition from stability to instability (bifurcation). In the present context, a change in the environmental parameters (e.g. mean temperature, rainfall) might lead to a transition from disease free equilibrium to an endemic situation or to a variation in the periodicity. Compartmental Model Calculating Basic Reproductive Number All papers calculating the reproductive numbers ("Basic Reproductive Number", "Effective Reproductive Number" etc.) use PBM approaches. This is usually done analytically from the set of differential equations or by using the Next Generation Matrix approach [87] . The reproductive number, i.e. the number of secondary cases arising from a primary case under certain conditions, depends on the set of parameters. The approach can be used to investigate which range of the relevant environmental parameters might result in the reproductive number below or above one (i.e. the disease fades out or it establishes) Human Mobility Human mobility is often neglected in epidemiological models, however, a small proportion of PBM-papers incorporate human mobility, for example, in the form of "gravity model" [88] . All the reviewed papers, however, focus only on short-term human mobility Human mobility will be likely affected by changes in the environmental and socioeconomic factors arising from climate change [89] , with an impact on formation and severity of the spatio-temporal epidemic patterns. Hydrodynamics Model and Network Analysis The detailed water flow of rivers, estuarine, pipe network etc. can be incorporated in PBM to assess spatio-temporal exposure to contaminated water. This is usually done by employing hydrogeological models or abstract network theory (see e.g. [90] ) where the nodes of the graph represent communities and links represent their connection (hydrological but also due to human mobility). Hydrodynamics models can take into account variations, due to e.g. rainfall, in the spatio-temporal exposure to the pathogen caused by variations in the contact with contaminated water or in the concentration of the pathogen dispersed in the water. Compartmental Model with person-toperson Transmission and also person-toenvironment transmission Person-to-person is an additional mode of transmission of many water-associated diseases, e.g. cholera. Many PBM address these processes by allowing infection transmission when a contact between a susceptible and infected person occur. Furthermore, the infected population can excrete pathogens back to the environment, for example via the sewage system. The process can be reproduced by letting the rate of growth of the pathogen population in the environment increases with the number of infected people. The effects of climate and weather can have an indirect impact on these additional modes of transmission, for example by changing the population size (e.g. due to increased urbanization) and the rates of contact among people, and by altering the patterns of contact at people-environment interface (for instance, socioeconomic factors impacting sewage treatment).
