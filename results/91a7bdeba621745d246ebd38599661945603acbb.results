Random forest-based Bayesian model discrimination was able to discriminate relative timing of symptoms and infectiousness for simulated household-stratified symptom-onset data. With 200 households of size 5, accuracy was 0.6974 for discriminating the five observation models (with random parameters, and 10,0 0 0 training simulations per model). When selecting solely between pre-infectiousness and coincident symptoms versus postinfectiousness symptoms, accuracy was 0.9796 (we call this the two-class accuracy); suggesting that most model discrimination error was between similar models to which the same management decisions might be applied. Accuracy was reduced with fewer households: to 0.608 with 100 households, and 0.518 with only 50 households ( Fig. 1 d) ; these had two-class accuracy of 0.95 and 0.894, respectively. These results were robust with respect to variation in household size ( Figure S2) , with accuracy ranging from 0.648 with 200 households of size 3 to 0.703 with 200 households of size 7. We report results for households of size 5 for the remainder of this section. Remarkably, model discrimination remained accurate when only a small subset of daily household data were observed, when the observations were from an optimal design: a design of size 5 with 200 households was sufficient to produce a classification accuracy of 0.662 and a two-class accuracy of 0.975 ( Figs. 1 d and  2 a) , only marginally below the accuracy of the full design ( Figure  S3 ). Accuracy increased as the design size (i.e., number of days of surveillance) and the number of households increased. The heuristic produced an effectively indistinguishable level of accuracy compared to the optimal across design sizes, both for overall accuracy ( Fig. 1 c) and two-class accuracy ( Fig. 1 d) . The heuristic ensured a substantial reduction in computation time: to produce Fig. 1 c, 39  Fig. 2. (a) Accuracy of model discrimination in designs of size 5, as the number of households increases, and under partial observation. Note that p obs is not a fixed parameter but is sampled from a distribution: The Beta(5,5) distribution has mean 0.5, and the Beta(7.5,2.5) distribution has mean 0.75. Figure S3 shows the equivalent result with a design of size 14. (b) Difference between heuristic designs (coloured points) and optimal designs (black boxes) as the design size increases. Note that we do not evaluate optimal designs of size 1 or 2, and so there are no optimal designs in these columns. (c) Distribution of training sample observations (under each model and number of households) for the most important feature under the heuristic: the proportion of households with 1 case observed on day 2. Each coloured point represents an observation in the training sample. These results correspond to households of size 5, with 10,0 0 0 training samples from each model, each with parameters drawn from the distributions that appear in Supplemental Figure S1 . random forests were required when using the heuristic, compared to 49,107 random forests to produce the optimal results. The key design points (i.e., sampling days) for optimal designs were consistently the second day ( Fig. 2 b) , followed by other days early in the outbreak (i.e., days 3-6, and day 1). Days 7-14 typically had little impact on model discrimination accuracy (i.e., optimal accuracy and two-class accuracy consistently levelled off as design size increased beyond 5; Fig. 1 c/d), and the optimal combination of these days varied due to stochasticity in both training and test data. This is consistent with the feature importance used to develop the heuristic ( Fig. 1 b) , i.e., those days that were consistently optimal were those with highest feature importance. When the most important design point is visualised ( Fig. 2 c) it shows a subtle but clear difference between distributions of observations from the different models; this provides intuition as to how decision trees constructed from many predictors of this form can accurately discriminate models. To assess the impact of asymptomatic infections on model discrimination, we repeated the analysis, except with each individual only being symptomatic (at the point symptoms would otherwise appear) with probability p obs (again, sampled from a prior distribution). This partial observation made model discrimination substantially more challenging: with designs of size 5 and 200 households ( Fig. 2 a) , accuracy was 0.522 and two-class accuracty was 0.863 when p obs ~Beta(7.5, 2.5) (i.e., a mean of 0.75), and accuracy was 0.400 and two-class accuracy was 0.736 when p obs ~Beta(5, 5) (i.e., a mean of 0.5) (compared to 0.622 and 0.975 with complete observation).
