Vaccination with nASP+QuilA, but not pASP+QuilA or nASP+Al(OH) 3 , reduces worm egg production while increasing IgG1 and IgG2 antibody levels. Animals vaccinated in study 1 with the nASP+ QuilA vaccine showed a significant reduction of 59% in cumulative egg output compared to the control vaccinated group. This confirms our previous findings 17 . In contrast, no reduction of faecal egg counts (FEC) was observed following vaccination with pASP+ QuilA (Supplemental Fig. 1A ). Similar to the observations made in study 1, animals from study 2 vaccinated with nASP+ QuilA vaccine showed a reduction of 42% in cumulative FEC compared with the control vaccinated group, whereas no reduction of FEC was observed in the pASP+ QuilA and nASP+ Al(OH) 3 Fig. 1B) . For both studies, vaccination had no effect on worm counts (data not shown).
