Themes and sub-themes The mean age of participants was 43 and the mean time of work experience was 18 years (Table 1) . Overall, 1125 original codes were extracted and after integration using conventional concept analysis, four original themes consisting of 11 sub-themes were identified. The theme of "health infrastructure defection in Iraq" had three sub-themes: "health abandonment in Iraq", "the weakness of health culture" and "problems related to health system". The theme of "poor control of factors effective in infectious diseases" had three sub-themes: the "underlying factors in prevalence of contagious diseases", "health system response to communicable diseases" and "ignoring the risks of the Arbaeen ceremony". The theme of "low perception of risk in pilgrims" had three sub-themes: "lack of awareness in pilgrims", "fatalism in pilgrims" and "unhygienic belief in pilgrims". The theme of "ineffectiveness of health education" had two sub-themes: "training shortage in the targeted group" and "educational content problems" (Table 2) . According to the findings of this study, the main theme is pilgrim-based education. It seems that the biggest issue with the prevention of communicable diseases in the Arbaeen ceremony is pilgrim-based education. Educating pilgrims can directly help people to create or reform health infrastructures in Iraq. Education can also help to identify health risks and respond to them by identifying effective factors in combating infectious diseases. The training of health instructors and guidelines from people who are trusted and accepted by pilgrims, such as missionaries and religious leaders, can have a positive impact on their beliefs. The main point of training is to determine the targeted group both at the level of pilgrims and health directors and consider the training needs of each group in preparing training guidelines.
