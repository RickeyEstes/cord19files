Two hundred and sixty-six patients were eligible for the study, three of whom were eliminated prior to randomization as no study drug was dispensed. The remaining 263 patients were randomized to mupirocin or placebo. Of these, five were excluded from analysis due to cancellation of surgery (four in the mupirocin group and one in the placebo group). One patient was excluded from the intention-to-treat analysis alone, as it was not clear to which treatment he was randomized; he used mupirocin on his own initiative. Of the 257 patients included in the intention-to-treat analysis, 130 received mupirocin and 127 received placebo. The patients in the placebo group who used mupirocin as well as, or instead of, placebo (three patients), were then re-analysed in the mupirocin group (actual treatment analysis). One patient in the placebo group did not use the dispensed therapy and was re-analysed in the same group. Follow-up was complete. Patients in the two groups were similar with respect to demographic characteristics, premorbid illnesses, and pre-and postoperative complications and care (Table I) . Only chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was significantly more prevalent in the mupirocin group compared with the placebo group (10% vs 1.6%; P ¼ 0.006). Overall, nasal carriage of S. aureus was eliminated in 81.5% of patients receiving mupirocin and 46.5% of patients receiving placebo (P < 0.0001) ( Table I) . In the initial intention-to-treat analysis, the overall rates of infection were 18 (13.8%) and 11 (8.6%) (P ¼ 0.319), with seven (5.4%) and six (4.7%) sternal infections in the mupirocin and placebo groups, respectively (Table II) . The odds ratio for infection when adjusted for diabetes, smoking, hypertension, COPD, immunosuppression and obesity was 1.61 (95%CI 0.69e3.75). The total number of nosocomial wound infections was two (1.6%) in the mupirocin group and three (2.4%) in the placebo group (P ¼ 0.243). The total number of S. aureus infections was five (3.8%) and four (3.2%) in the mupirocin and placebo groups, respectively; however, nosocomial S. aureus infections leading to bacteraemia and serious complications including death only occurred in the placebo group (N ¼ 2, 1.6%, P ¼ 0.243) (Tables II and III ). Most infections (N ¼ 11, 65% of all infections in this group) in the mupirocin group were leg infections reported by GPs on follow-up, with no microbiology data and no significant morbidity (Table III) . Infections developed in eight of the 59 patients who were colonized with S. aureus at the time of surgery (10.9%) compared with 17 of the 156 patients who cleared S. aureus (13.6%). This was not a statistically significant difference. Of the patients who did not have repeat nasal swabs, four (12.5%) had infections. When patients who took mupirocin on their own initiative were re-analysed in the mupirocin group, no significant difference was noted. The only independent predictor of infection, when adjusted for age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, cancer, renal disease, smoking and COPD, was obesity (P ¼ 0.034). When S. aureus colonization status at the time of surgery was included in the multivariate regression analysis, it was not predictive of infection. Patients undergoing operations during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Toronto had significant delays between treatment and surgery. These patients were not rescreened pre-operatively. There were four deaths in the mupirocin group and five deaths in the placebo group. None of the deaths in the mupirocin group were attributable to an infection, whereas one death in the placebo group was directly related to S. aureus infection and one death was a result of pneumonia escalating to multi-organ failure. None of the S. aureus isolates from either nasal or wound cultures were meticillin resistant. No adverse effects were reported for either mupirocin or placebo.
