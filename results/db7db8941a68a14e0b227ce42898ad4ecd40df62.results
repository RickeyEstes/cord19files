Of the initial set of 42 full-text articles assessed for eligibility, 11 were excluded once read as they only described systems that sent PHEPR messages to health departments (n = 6) or were opinion articles (n = 5). Data extraction from the final 31 articles resulted in identification of 25 different systems, with one article describing more than one system. Overall, the final 31 articles contained information on the purpose of the system or tool (100%), location of the system (100%), public health organization or agency involved (100%), targeted HCP population (100%), and method(s) used by public health to communicate PHEPR messages to HCPs (100%). Eleven articles (covering 9 systems) included a description of the evaluation used with the system. Type of evaluations included comparative [19] , interviewing [20] , surveying [21, 22] , retrospective [23, 24] , formative [25] , and an assessment following a simulation exercise [26] . One article reported a causal relationship could be "inferred" between the dissemination of health advisories and HCP reporting and testing [27] and two reported receiving feedback but did not detail method [28, 29] . The remaining articles (65%) either did not mention an evaluation or did not contain enough information to determine if an evaluation had been conducted. Of the 25 systems and tools documented, the majority (96%) were North America-based. The location of the systems included: 40% state-level, 32% city-level, 16% country-level, and 8% regional, with one international system (4%). Only one tool was designed to provide PHEPR messages to veterinarians; the remaining targeted HCPs in hospitals, emergency departments and/or outpatient clinical settings. The majority of systems used email (64%) to deliver PHEPR messages. Systems also delivered messages by phone, including cellular (36%); fax (36%); pager (28%); SMS text messaging (16%); handheld devices such as PDAs or Blackberry Â® (16%); other devices such as radios (16%); messaging through an electronic medical record "public health" pandemic "health alert" OR "public health alert" veterinarians preparedness "health advisory" terrorism "preparedness message" surveillance "preparedness communication" system (12%); and "social media" (4%). Some systems also posted the PHEPR message to a web site (24%) for passive consumption. A majority of systems used more than one method (60%) for delivering messages. Only 4 systems were described in sufficient detail to determine that each method was attempted sequentially as opposed to redundant messages being delivered through all devices and formats. Table 4 (additional file 1 table S1 ) lists each messaging system or tool included in the final retrieval set and indicates type of evaluation conducted where applicable.
