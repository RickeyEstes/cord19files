We identifi ed 426 documents with one or more statements of incubation period (fi gure 1). Of the 441 estimates that appeared in these documents, 77 (17%) estimates were original, 168 (38%) gave a source, and 197 (45%) gave no source (table 1) . 38 articles contained data appropriate for analysis (table 2) . 24 (63%) were observational studies and 14 (37%) were experimental studies. Table 1 summarises the incubation periods stated in the literature and the underlying data. Estimates for the incubation period of SARS-associated coronavirus and infl uenza have the most support (more than ten studies). Relatively large experimental studies of parainfl uenza and rhinovirus have been done, but few observational or experimental studies (six or fewer) were available for other diseases. Our estimates of the full distribution of each incubation period using pooled data are shown in fi gure 2 and table 3. Visual comparison of the log-normal fi tted curves with non-parametric estimates shows high agreement (fi gure 2). We estimated times by which 5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% of cases would develop symptoms (table 1) . If fewer than 20 observations were available, we did not estimate the 5th or 95th percentiles. No estimate was made for human metapneumovirus due to insuffi cient data (n=2). Median incubation periods ranged from a half-day (for infl uenza B) to 12 days (for measles). Dispersions ranged from 1·15 to 1·81, with all but SARS-associated coronavirus and rhinovirus being 1·51 or less, which suggest that, for most respiratory viruses, at least 90% of cases will develop symptoms between half and twice the median incubation period (because e 1·67×log(1·51) ≈2).
