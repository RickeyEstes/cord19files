IFNα/β receptor 1 (IFNAR1) blockade results in expansion of TCF1 hi virus-specific CD8 + T cells Blockade of IFN-I signaling during persistent LCMV infection enhances T cell-mediated control of persistent virus infection (Teijaro et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2015) . Here we asked whether virus-specific CD8 + T cells generated in an IFN-I-deficient environment would respond differently than CD8 + T cells generated in an IFN-I-replete environment. To address this question, we used CD8 + T cells from mice with a transgenic T cell antigen receptor specific for the glycoprotein 33-41 antigen (GP33-41) of LCMV (Pircher et al., 1987 (Pircher et al., , 1989 . CD90.1 + P14 cells were transferred into CD90.2 + congenic mice, which were then treated with isotype control or aIFNAR1 antibody and infected with a persistent dose of LCMV Cl13 (Fig. 1 A) . Virusspecific CD90.1 + effector CD8 + T cells were purified 8 d post infection (dpi) and adoptively transferred into CD90.2 + congenic hosts, followed by infection with Cl13 ( Fig. 1 A) . At 7 dpi, we observed significant increases in the percentages and total numbers of virus-specific CD8 + T cells isolated from aIFNAR1treated mice in spleen, lung, and liver compared with virusspecific CD8 + T cells isolated from the isotype controls ( Fig. 1 B) . We next asked whether virus-specific CD8 + T cells from Cl13infected aIFNAR1-treated mice could promote control of persistent virus infection. As done above, virus-specific CD8 + T cells from Cl13-infected isotype-or aIFNAR1-treated control mice were purified and adoptively transferred into Cl13-infected mice depleted of CD4 + T cells, which are unable to clear Cl13 (Fig. S1 A). We observed substantial reductions in viral loads in mice that received T cells from aIFNAR1-treated mice infected with Cl13, and 50% and 100% of mice had completely cleared virus below the limit of detection in serum and liver, respectively, compared with mice receiving CD8 + T cells from isotype control-treated animals (Fig. S1 B) . These experiments demonstrate that IFNAR1 signaling limits the proliferative potential of virus-specific CD8 + T cells in a cell-intrinsic manner. To understand the mechanism by which IFNAR1 prevents CD8 + T cells from proliferating, we compared transcriptomes of CD90.1 + P14 cells from aIFNAR1-versus isotype-treated mice by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) 10 dpi. Strikingly, among the top 15 genes most significantly up-regulated in aIFNAR1-versus isotype-treated mice were Cxcr5, Tcf7, and Id3 ( Fig. 1 C) . These genes mark the recently identified population of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells, characterized by a lower degree of exhaustion and higher proliferative potential. Moreover, genes associated with effector function such as Gzmb were significantly down-regulated in the aIFNAR1 group (Fig. 1, C and D) . Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of genes that distinguish CXCR5 + TIM3 − CD8 + T cells from their CXCR5 − TIM3 + counterparts (Im et al., 2016) showed a significant up-regulation of the CXCR5 + TIM3 − gene signature in aIFNAR1-treated mice (Fig. 1 E) . Indeed, when we examined specifically CXCR5 + P14 and CXCR5 − P14 cells using RNA-seq data (Leong et al., 2016) , the transcriptional variance separating CXCR5 + from CXCR5 − P14 cells was described by the same principal component as variance separating P14 cells from aIFNAR1-versus isotype-treated mice (Fig. 1 F) . These results suggest that IFNAR activity skews CD8 + T cells toward the CXCR5 − phenotype. Accordingly, in WT mice treated with aIFNAR1 versus isotype antibodies, we observed a significant increase in the percentage and total number of virus-specific CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1 G) . We also observed commensurate increases in the expression of BCL6 and TCF1, transcription factors required for CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell differentiation, following IFNAR1 blockade (Figs. 1 H and S1 C). Moreover, the increases in CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell numbers following aIFNAR1 Figure 1 . Blockade of IFN-I promotes the expansion of virus-specific CXCR5 + TIM3 − CD8 + T cells. (A and B) Experimental scheme for adoptive transfer experiments. C57BL/6J host mice received 2 × 10 3 CD90.1 + P14 cells and isotype control or aIFNAR1 antibodies 1 d before infection with Cl13 (2 × 10 6 focusforming units). At 8 dpi, 10 5 P14 cells were sorted from these mice and then adoptively transferred into another two groups of CD90.2 + mice, followed by LCMV Cl13 infection the next day. P14 cells in spleen, lung, and liver of the recipient mice were quantified at 7 dpi. (C-F) P14 cells were transferred into isotype-or aIFNAR1-treated mice, followed by LCMV Cl13 infection the next day. P14 cells were then sorted at day 10 after infection and subjected to RNA-seq analysis.

Left half: Down-regulated with aIFNAR1 treatment. Right half: Up-regulated with aIFNAR1 treatment. Genes with important function in T cells are highlighted. (D) Heat map of hierarchically clustered top differentially expressed genes (by P value) between isotype-and aIFNAR1-treated mice. (E) GSEA Huang et al. Journal of Experimental Medicine treatment were sustained for over a month (Fig. 1 I) . Interestingly, treatment with aIFNAR1 at 30 dpi still caused a significant increase in the frequency and number of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells, demonstrating that IFN-I signaling limits their expansion even in the persistent phase of infection ( Fig. S1 D) . Our results confirm and extend a recent study by Wu et al. (2016) and collectively demonstrate that with aIFNAR1 treatment, mice infected with LCMV Cl13 exhibit increased and sustained CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell generation compared with isotype-treated controls.
