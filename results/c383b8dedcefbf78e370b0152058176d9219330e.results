High-quality de novo assembly and annotation of the Jamaican fruit bat transcriptome. We previously reported a high mortality rate in Jamaican fruit bats experimentally infected with TCRV, in which high-dose inoculations (10 6 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID 50 ]) caused significant and fatal disease as early as 10 days postinfection (22) . Histopathologic findings revealed multiple organ involvement in TCRV disease, including acute neutrophilic splenitis and white pulp hyperplasia, as well as plasmacytic and histiocytic splenitis. To profile the host pathogenic transcriptional response, we generated stranded poly(A) ϩ Illumina RNA-Seq (transcriptome sequencing) libraries using RNA extracted from the organs of experimentally infected bats. For this analysis, we harvested the livers, kidneys, and spleens from 2 control bats (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline [DPBS] treated) and 2 TCRV-infected bats with fatal disease (Fig. 1 ). Our previous analysis indicated TCRV RNA was present in each of these tissues at time of collection (22) . A total of 12 pooled samples were sequenced, generating 693,106,150 raw 100-bp paired-end reads. After demultiplexing, trimming of poor-quality reads and adapter sequences, and removing duplicate reads, 691,108,820 nonredundant reads per sample were used for the transcriptome assembly. De novo assembly of the global transcriptome was performed using Trinity, resulting in 349,855 assembled transcripts of Ն300 bp (mean length of 997 bp) with an N 50 of 3,419 bases that were clustered into 175,144 nonredundant clustered transcripts (unigenes) ( Fig. 2A ) (29) . Inspection of these unigenes identified from the combined transcriptome showed that 35% of the contigs (12,600) are expressed in each of the three different tissues (fragments per kilobase per million [FPKM] , Ͼ1), whereas the expression of many tissue-specific contigs was identified in the spleen, liver, and kidney (Fig. 2B) . The combined Jamaican fruit bat transcriptome was systematically annotated using the Trinotate pipeline, a software suite that automates the functional annotation of the assembled contigs (30) . The annotation report for the combined assembly from the Trinotate pipeline (see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material) represents the predicted coding sequences of Jamaican fruit bat genes and the results of homology searches against the databases listed in Data Set S1. Among the 227,656 transcripts containing complete open reading frame (ORF) sequences, 124,204 nonredundant ORFs (54%) were associated with high-confidence coding predictions, BLAST homology and PFAM domain content (see Data Set S2 in the supplemental material). We compared this combined Jamaican fruit bat transcriptome assembly to those of other mammals through BLASTX analysis. The bat Brandt's myotis (Myotis brandtii) had the highest number of related sequences (8,060 similar sequences [Data Set S2]). Among other mammals were the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) and the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) (with 7,947 and 6,955 similar sequences, respectively) (Fig. 2C) . Differential gene expression following TCRV infection. To investigate the molecular response of bats to TCRV infection, differential gene expression analysis was performed. We used a pairwise comparison of TCRV-infected samples against the corresponding controls and found that the expression levels of hundreds of different genes were altered during TCRV infection (Fig. 3A) . The spleen had the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs); among these 1,912 DEGs, 1,187 were upregulated and 725 were downregulated following infection ( Fig. 3C ; false discovery rate [FDR], Ͻ0.01; log 2 fold change, Ͼ2). We also determined that the kidney and liver each had a greater number of upregulated genes (251 and 188, respectively) compared to the number of downregulated genes in these tissues following TCRV infection (123 and 72, respectively). A comparison of all TCRV-infected tissues against all of the uninfected controls revealed 62 upregulated and 16 downregulated genes ( Fig. 3B and C) . Immune gene expression profile in response to TCRV infection. To gain specific insight into the immune-related gene expression altered in response to TCRV infection, we utilized the ImmPort database to identify those TCRV-altered genes that relate to immune-system functions (31) . Approximately 23% of the 4,723 genes available in the database corresponded to the differentially expressed genes annotated in our analysis (see Data Set S3 in the supplemental material). The coordinating transcript expression . Jamaican fruit bats were inoculated with either TCRV or DPBS (n ϭ 2 for each condition). De novo assembly of the Jamaican fruit bat transcriptome was performed using RNA-Seq data from kidney, liver, and spleen tissues. Differentially expressed genes were then identified in the uninfected and infected tissues using edgeR. values of these identified immune genes were used to evaluate the relationship between the specific uninfected and infected tissues (Fig. 4A ). While all three tissue types studied had unique expression profiles in the infected samples, we further analyzed the transcripts contained in cluster 3, which represent sequences with overall shared expression patterns and found that these corresponding genes map to pathways identified to be affected in response to viral infection (Fig. 4B) . Notably, with the use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA [Qiagen]), we identified the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway to be among the top pathways altered upon TCRV infection (cluster 3, IPA [see Data S4 in the supplemental material]). IFNs are a family of cytokines secreted by host cells in response to viruses and other pathogens to confer antiviral states upon uninfected neighboring cells in an effort to prevent spread of infection (32) . Given that the IFN response has been explored in bats in regard to pathogen-host response (33), we then further examined the relationship between these factors within the spleen, kidney, and liver in response to TCRV infection and found that while most of the identified IFN pathway-related genes were upregulated, all of the factors In addition to the IFN-signaling pathway, we identified signaling pathways for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (among other cytokines), as well as pathways for T-helper cell differentiation and the Th1 pathway ( Fig. 4B ; see Fig. S3 and Data Set S4 in the supplemental material). Further analysis of all DEGs via the Reactome plugin (Cytoscape) identified additional key pathways involved in the immune response (Table 1 ; Data Set S4, "All up-regulated Reactome"). Specifically, we identified increased transcript levels of several cytokine genes (IL6, IL8, IL1A, IL1B, and IFNG) and chemokine genes (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, and CXCL6). To highlight markers associated with circulating immune cells, we focused on those DEGs that were common to two or more tissues, and the data are consistent with increased infiltration of neutrophils into the infected tissues. In kidneys, neutrophil infiltration can cause hyperinflammation and kidney damage (34) . This is further supported by the presence of enriched expression levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGALl) in all three tissues, which is a biomarker for renal damage in humans (35) .
