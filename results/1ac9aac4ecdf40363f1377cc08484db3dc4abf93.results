Clinical observations and virus shedding. Mild watery diarrhea was observed in pigs inoculated with TGEV Miller strain between 2 to 4 days postinoculation (dpi). No clinical signs were observed in pigs from the negative-control, TGEV Purdue, and PRCV-inoculated groups throughout the experiment. All animals survived until the end of the study (42 dpi). All fecal samples collected from pigs in the TGEV strain Purdue, TGEV strain Miller, PRCV-inoculated, and negative-control groups were tested by rRT-PCR and found to be TGEV and PRCV negative prior to the inoculations. Likewise, all oral fluid samples, with the exception of one false-positive (threshold cycle [C T ], 35.5) result in the TGEV Purdue group, were negative before inoculation. The detection of TGEV (S and N genes) and PRCV (N gene) in pen-based feces and oral fluids by rRT-PCR is shown in Fig. 1 . Transmissible gastroenteritis virus was detected in feces between 3 and 28 dpi by rRT-PCR in pigs inoculated with TGEV strain Miller ( Fig. 1A and C) . No significant fecal shedding was detected in pigs inoculated with TGEV strain Purdue or PRCV throughout the study ( Fig. 1A and C). Viral shedding was specifically detected by rRT-PCR in oral fluid samples collected from pigs inoculated with TGEV strain Purdue (1 to 21 dpi), TGEV strain Miller (1 to 9 dpi), and PRCV (1 to 7 dpi) ( Fig. 1B and D) . TGEV antibody response over the course of the experimental inoculation. Serum samples collected from all groups of pigs prior to inoculation were antibody negative for porcine coronaviruses (TGEV, PRCV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [PEDV] , and porcine delta coronavirus [PDCoV]). All pigs in the negative-control group remained TGEV and PRCV seronegative throughout the monitoring period when tested with any of the three TGEV/PRCV differential blocking ELISA kits evaluated in this study ( The percentages of TGEV antibody-positive serum samples reported by the three commercial ELISA kits evaluated over the 50-day study period for pigs inoculated with TGEV strains Purdue and Miller are presented in Fig. 2A to F, respectively. Suspect results are presented as positives or negatives. The first TGEV-specific antibody detection was reported between 7 and 10 dpi in both TGEV-inoculated groups (strains Purdue and Miller). The number of TGEV antibody-positive pigs detected increased through the study, regardless of the ELISA kit used. For the TGEV Purdue inoculation group, no significant differences (P Ͼ 0.05) were found in the percentages of TGEV-seropositive pigs reported by the three ELISAs regardless of the time postinoculation and interpretation of suspect results. In contrast, for the TGEV Miller inoculation group, we found that a significantly higher (P Ͻ 0.05) percentage of TGEV-seropositive animals was detected by the Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA than by both the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA (dpi 10) and Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA (10, 17, and 21 dpi) only when suspect results were interpreted as negative. A nonspecific TGEV antibody response to PRCV-inoculated pigs was reported by the three ELISA kits between 7 and 42 dpi ( Fig. 2G to I). No significant differences in the percentages of TGEV false positives were found between ELISAs over the monitoring period when TGEV suspect results were interpreted as negative (P Ͼ 0.05). However, the overall proportion of false positives was higher when suspect results were interpreted as positive, regardless of the ELISA kit evaluated. Moreover, the percentage of TGEV-false-positive results reported by the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA was significantly greater (P Ͻ 0.05) than those obtained with the Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA (14, 21, and 35 dpi) and INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA (21 to 35 dpi). PRCV antibody response over the course of the experimental inoculation. With the exception of one false-positive result reported (42 dpi) by the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA kit, the negative-control group remained seronegative for PRCV by the three commercial ELISAs throughout the study. On PRCV-inoculated animals, an early PRCV-specific antibody response was first detected at 7 to 10 dpi by the three commercial ELISAs and lasted through 42 dpi ( Fig. 3G to I ). An analysis of the proportion of PRCV-seropositive animals showed significant differences between ELISA kits over time following PRCV inoculation, regardless of the interpretation of suspect results (P Ͻ 0.05). The percentage of PRCVseropositive animals detected by the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA was significantly lower than those with both the Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA (dpi 14 to 35) and INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA (dpi 17 to 21 and 28) (P Ͻ 0.05). No differences were found between the Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant and INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISAs. On TGEV-inoculated animals, a nonspecific PRCV serum antibody response was detected by the three commercial ELISAs. This serologic cross-reactivity seemed to be TGEV strain dependent, with a higher percentage of PRCV-false-positive results in the TGEV strain Purdue-inoculated group ( Fig. 3A to C) than in the TGEV strain Miller group ( Fig. 3D to F). The cross-reactivity appeared more marked at early stages postexposure (7 to 14 dpi). No differences were found between ELISA kits over the course of the study, except at 7 dpi when the proportion of PRCV-false-positive animals detected by the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA was significantly greater (P Ͻ 0.05) than that by the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA regardless of the interpretation of suspect results. Comparative diagnostic performance of the TGEV/PRCV differential ELISAs. The analytical specificity and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the three commercial differential TGEV/PRCV ELISA kits evaluated in this study are presented in Table 1 . Diagnostic parameters are presented relative to the interpretation of suspect results as positive or negative. Overall, the diagnostic sensitivity for the TGEV Miller inoculation group was higher than for the TGEV Purdue group, independent of the commercial ELISA kit evaluated. The Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA kit showed the highest diagnostic sensitivity for antibody detection in pigs inoculated with TGEV strain Miller (94%), regardless of the interpretation of suspect results. The diagnostic sensitivity for the TGEV strain Purdue-inoculated group was higher with the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA kit (79%) when suspect results were considered positive, while it was slightly higher with the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA kit (54%) when suspect results were interpreted as negative. The diagnostic sensitivities for PRCV antibody detection obtained with both Swinecheck TGEV/PRCV Recombinant ELISA (86%) and INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA (81 to 85%) were greater than that of the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA kit (28%). With the exception of the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA, the diagnostic sensitivity calculated for each ELISA kit was not affected by the interpretation of suspect results (positive versus negative). The three commercial ELISAs showed 100% diagnostic specificity for both TGEV and PRCV detection, with the exception for one PRCV-false-positive result reported by the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA, which resulted in a diagnostic specificity of 99.2% for PRCV detection. The diagnostic specificity of any of the evaluated ELISA kits was unaffected by the interpretation of suspect results. The INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA kit showed the highest analytical specificity (less cross-reactivity) for TGEV-specific antibody detection (82.3%). For all three commercial ELISAs, we found higher cross-reactivity to PRCV within the TGEV Purdue inoculation group than in the TGEV Miller group. The highest analytical specificity for PRCV was obtained with the INgezim Corona Diferencial ELISA (84%) when suspect results were interpreted as positive or with the Svanovir TGEV/PRCV-Ab ELISA kit (95%) when suspect results were interpreted as negative; however, the Svanovir TGEV/ PRCV-Ab ELISA kit showed the lowest analytical specificity (39%) of the kits when suspect results were interpreted as positive.
