One hundred ninety-eight participants, 85 men and 113 women, with an age range of 20-88, were enrolled in the study. Skin pigmentation was light (white-yellow) in 154, intermediate (tan-light brown) in 32, and dark (brown-black) in 12. One participant withdrew from the study days after the first blood draw (concentration of 35.7 ng/ml) and two withdrew after the second blood draw (first period mean concentrations of 9.6 and 25.4 ng/ ml). Thus, 197 were followed for the first period, and 195 for the remainder of the study. The study began on September 20, 2009 , the date of the first blood draw, and ended on January 12, 2010, two days after the last blood draw. An interim analysis of the coded data 2-3 weeks after the second period of observation caused the investigators to decide to close the study after the fourth blood draw (the end of the third period).
