Our dynamic BH3 peptide profiling revealed that Bad, Bim, Bid, Puma, and Noxa enhanced MoMP in IAV-but not in mock-infected human non-malignant RPE cells, which represent natural targets for IAV infection ( Figure S1 ) [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . A co-immunoprecipitation experiment using antibodies against pro-survival Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, or Mcl-1 followed by mass spectrometry showed that several cellular proteins, including Bad, Bax, Bak, UACA, PAWR, FLII, Trim21, IMMT, 14-3-3, EFHD2, DHX9, DDX3, NLRP3, and LRRFIP2, as well as viral factors M1, NS1, HA, and NP were present in the complexes ( Figure S2) . Thus, these experiments demonstrated that pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (Bad, Bax, Bak), PRRs (DHX9, DDX3, LRRFIP2), and other factors can be involved in the programmed death of IAV-infected cells. It was shown that ABT-263 targets Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 and alters their interaction with pro-apoptotic Bax, Bad, and Bak [19, 20] . We tested the effect of ABT-263 on the viability of RPE cells infected with IAV or mock by carrying out dose response studies. As readouts, we used fluorescent microscopy, which visualizes dead (green) and living (blue) cells. Fluorescent microscopy revealed that ABT-263 induced the premature death of IAV-infected cells at concentrations not toxic for non-infected cells ( Figure 1A) . We validated the results with the CTxG and CTG assays. The CTxG assay uses fluorescent asymmetric cyanine dye that stains the DNA of dead cells, whereas CTG assay quantifies ATP, an indicator of metabolically active living cells. We calculated the values of the differential area under the dose-response curves between the mock-and IAV-infected cells for both assays (∆AUC CTG and ∆AUC CTG ; Figure 1B ,C,E). High values indicate that ABT-263 was an effective trigger of the premature death of infected cells. In infected cells, the effect was observed already at 12 h post infection, whereas no toxicity was detected for at least 36 h at 0.4 µM ABT-263 in the mock-infected cells ( Figure 1E) . Moreover, the effect was dependent not only on the dose of ABT-263 but also on the viral load ( Figure 1D ). In addition, we evaluated the effect of ABT-263 on IAV replication by tittering viruses produced in cells treated and non-treated with ABT-263. ABT-263 treatment lowered IAV production in RPE cells, as indicated by the fold change between virus titers ( Figure 1D,E) . We obtained similar results in A549 cells ( Figure S3 ). Furthermore, ABT-263 activated caspase 3 in IAV-infected but not in non-treated or ABT-263-treated mock-infected RPE cells at 12 h post infection ( Figure S4 ). These results collectively suggest that ABT-263 induced premature apoptosis in IAV-infected cells and lowered IAV production.

Mean ± standard deviation (SD), n = 3; (D) RPE cells were non-or ABT-263-treated (0.4 µM) and infected with IAV at moi 0.08, 0.4, 2, and 10.

Mean ± SD, n = 3; (E) RPE cells were non-or ABT-263-treated (0.4 µM) and mock-or IAV-infected (moi 3), and cell viability was measured using a CTG assay at the indicated time points.

It also shows the effect of ABT-263 on virus production in drug-(3 µM) and DMSO-treated RPE cells, which is expressed in log 10 fold change (FC). Mean ± SD, n = 3. Importantly, ABT-263 induced the premature death of RPE cells infected with FLUBV, SFV, or HSV-1 and lowered virus production, all at concentrations that are not toxic to non-infected cells (Figure 2 ). We obtained similar results with ZIKV, EV1, EV6, MERS-CoV, HBV, and HSV-2 viruses using different cell lines ( Figure S5 ). Supplementary movies 1 and 2 further reaffirm that the treatment of pancreatic cancer cells infected with SFV with ABT-263 at low moi attenuated the replication and spread of the virus in these cells. These results suggest that Bcl-2i might be used as broad-spectrum antivirals.

To test this, we transfected RPE cells with IAV RNA (vRNA) or plasmid DNA (pDNA) and treated transfected cells with ABT-263. Viral RNA-or pDNA, but not mock-transfected cells, rapidly died after ABT-263 treatment (Figure 3 and Figure S6 A,B) . It is important to note that cell death was dependent on the amount of transfected vRNA and pDNA, as well as on concentration of ABT-263. Moreover, BH3 peptides of Puma, Bad, and Bid induced MoMP in pDNA-transfected ABT-263-treated cells as early as 3 h post transfection, in contrast to cells treated with ABT-263 or cells transfected with pDNA ( Figure S6 F) . As expected, ABT-263 did not accelerate the death of RPE or A549 cells treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are recognized by different PRRs to those that detect intracellular foreign RNA or DNA ( Figure S6 C-E).

In the next experiment, we pre-treated RPE or A549 cells with compounds that inhibit the endocytic uptake (obatoclax or SaliPhe) or the transcription and replication of IAV (JNJ-872 or gemcitabin) [46, 51] and infected them with IAV. ABT-263 did not show any effect on these cells ( Figure S7 ). These results confirmed that intracellular foreign RNA/DNA or its replication intermediates triggered apoptosis, and Bcl-2i accelerate this process.

These results confirmed that intracellular foreign RNA/DNA or its replication intermediates triggered apoptosis, and Bcl-2i accelerate this process. In order to provide further clues on the mechanisms of Bcl-2i-sensitized apoptosis, we investigated the effect of ABT-263 analogues (ABT-737, ABT-199, WEHI-539, A-1331852, and A-1155463) on the viability and death of IAV-infected and mock-infected RPE cells at 24 hpi ( Figure 4 ). In addition, we evaluated the effect of these compounds on IAV replication by titering the viruses produced in cells treated with increasing compound concentrations. We calculated CC50, EC50, and SI values for each compound. We observed that ABT-263 was more selective than structurally similar ABT-737 and ABT-199, whereas A-1155463 was more selective than structurally similar A-1331852 and WEHI-539 (Figure 4 and Figure 5A ). Importantly, the treatment of non-infected RPE cells with these compounds altered the levels of secreted adenine, adenosine, hypoxanthine, IMP, AMP, inosine, and xanthosine, which belong to the ATP metabolic pathway ( Figure S8 ). Altogether, these results suggest that A-1155463 may represent an antiviral lead candidate.
