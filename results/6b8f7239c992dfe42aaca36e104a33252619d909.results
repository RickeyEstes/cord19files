On 25 April 2003, EMOPD began screening all febrile patients with respiratory complaints for SARS. A 30-year-old male suspect case of SARS was admitted on 1 May 2003 with fever (39 C), chills and breathlessness. He developed respiratory failure and was transferred to the respiratory intensive care unit on 2 May. One day later he was put into the isolation ward as a suspected SARS case along with six contacts. A senior resident in pulmonary medicine and the principal investigator examined any contacts in the ward. After five days of isolation, he was moved into a general ward. Facemasks were provided for him and his family but standard procedures for handling samples from SARS cases were not followed. A blood sample taken on admission was sent to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Delhi and proved to be negative for SARS. No convalescent sample was sent, nor were any other respiratory samples examined. The case and the contacts were then discharged. They were asked to report immediately if any sign/symptom appeared in next fortnight. A total of 2165 patients were screened in 28 days, 162 (7.4%) of whom had a history of respiratory complaints. An average of six or seven patients with respiratory complaints were screened for SARS daily. No confirmed case of SARS was found. The flow of patients and their attendants was not systematic and their movement was uncontrolled. Two or three or even more attendants usually accompanied one patient. At the entrance, there was no sign showing the direction to the patient reception area. The corridor was overcrowded, leaving little space for movement of patients, nurses and doctors. There is a central airconditioning system with different airflow control units, but no negative-pressure isolation room or other isolation facility. The floors were wet mopped two or three times per day and once a day with cresol. The emergency operation theatres were fumigated monthly. Initially the principal investigator was only provided with standard facemasks. He wore two at a time for protection. An N-95 mask was made available for the final 10 days. The suspected SARS case and his contacts were also given standard facemasks. Laboratory investigations for SARS were not available in the EMOPD. Attendants crowded around the place of collection for laboratory reports, which they searched for themselves. No information on SARS was displayed, and the staff told the patients/attendants about the symptoms of SARS only when asked. Most of the attendants/patients targeted the principal investigator for information. In the EMOPD there was no online access to information on recent outbreaks of communicable diseases. Journals such as CD Alert are not taken by the EMOPD and none of the resident doctors had heard of CD Alert or the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Report. They were unaware of the notifiable diseases or SARS management protocols.
