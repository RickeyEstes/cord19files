A total of 200 measurements were made for ciliary beat frequency, 100 for ependymal cilia and 100 for respiratory cilia. There was no significant difference (paired t test, P = 0.64) in the ciliary beat frequency obtained using the direct counting and ciliaFA methods (n = 200). The mean difference (± SD) was −0.05 ± 1.25 Hz and was highly correlated (r 2 = 0.991) (Figure 3 ). For ependymal cilia the mean CBF was 36.3 ± 6.4 Hz for the direct counting and 35.9 ± 7.0 Hz for the ciliaFA method. For respiratory cilia the mean CBF was 11.72 ± 2.8 Hz for the direct counting and 11.97 ± 3.0 Hz for the ciliaFA method. The Bland-Altman limits showed agreement from −2.55 to 3.25 Hz for the ependymal cilia and showed a closer agreement for the respiratory cilia (−1.99 to 1.49 Hz). The addition of the bacterial toxin pneumolysin reduced the mean CBF of ependymal cilia within 5 minutes ( Table 1 ). The mean CBF values after 5 minutes exposure to pneumolysin determined by the ciliaFA was 21.45 ± 4.1 Hz. Using the direct counting method, two different observers calculated a mean CBF of 21.75 ± 4.5 Hz and 21.79 ± 4.2 Hz respectively. Repeatability (agreement between methods) was very good and presented values similar to the agreement between two different observers (1.13 Hz and 1.08 Hz respectively). At 15 minutes after the addition of pneumolysin the cilia were mostly static ( Figure 2 ). The ciliaFA accurately predicted the reduction in CBF and detected regions of interest where the cilia had become static.
