Identification and characterization of MERS-CoV-RBD-specific Nbs. To construct the Nb (i.e., VHH) library, we immunized llama with recombinant MERS-CoV RBD (residues 377 to 588, EMC2012 strain) containing a C-terminal human IgG1 Fc tag (i.e., RBD-Fc) and isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the immunized llama. After four rounds of bio-panning and screening using MERS-CoV RBD-Fc, we isolated a positive clone with the highest binding affinity for the RBD. The gene encoding this RBD-specific Nb was subcloned into yeast expression vector to construct NbMS10 (which contains a C-terminal His 6 tag) and NbMS10-Fc (which contains a C-terminal human IgG1 Fc tag) Nbs (Fig. 1) . Both NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc were NbMS10-Fc Nbs. Blood was collected from MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein-immunized alpaca after the last immunization to isolate PBMCs. RNA was then extracted to synthesize cDNA via RT-PCR. This was followed by PCR amplification of the N-terminal IgG heavy-chain fragment (ϳ700 bp), including the VHH gene, while the latter was used as the template to amplify the VHH gene fragment (ϳ300 to 450 bp). The VHH DNA sequence was further ligated into phagemid vector pCANTAB5e and transformed into E. coli TG1 competent cells to construct VHH library. VHH phage display was carried out to isolate RBD-specific clones. After four rounds of bio-panning, the RBD-specific VHH coding sequence was confirmed from the selected positive clones. The identified VHH coding gene containing a C-terminal His 6 or human IgG1 Fc was inserted into Pichia pastoris yeast expression vector pPICZ␣A to construct NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc, respectively, for further soluble expression and purification. expressed in yeast cells, secreted into the cell culture supernatants, and purified to homogeneity ( Fig. 2A, left) . The estimated molecular weights were about 16 kDa for NbMS10 and 50 kDa for NbMS10-Fc, since the latter formed a dimer. These MERS-CoV RBD-specific Nbs from llama, but not severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RBD-specific MAbs from mice, were recognized by anti-llama antibodies ( Fig. 2A, right) . Thus, the yeast-expressed Nbs maintained their native conformation and antigenicity. To characterize their functions, we examined how the Nbs interact with MERS-CoV RBDs. First, we evaluated the binding between the Nbs and MERS-CoV RBD using ELISA. The result showed that both Nbs bound strongly to recombinant MERS-CoV RBD containing a C-terminal folden tag (RBD-Fd) and MERS-CoV S1 containing a C-terminal His 6 tag (S1-His) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B) . Second, we determined the binding affinity of the two Nbs for MERS-CoV RBD using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The result showed that the K d between NbMS10 and RBD-Fc was 0.87 nM, The Nbs were subjected to SDS-PAGE (left) or Western blotting (right), followed by detection using anti-llama antibody. The molecular weight marker (in kDa) is indicated on the left. (B) Detection of binding between NbMS10 or NbMS10-Fc and MERS-CoV S1 (MERS-S1) or RBD (MERS-RBD) protein by ELISA. The plates were coated with MERS-CoV S1-His or RBD-Fd protein (2 g/ml), followed by sequential incubation with respective Nbs and goat anti-llama and HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibodies. The data are presented as mean A 450 values Ϯ the standard deviation (SDs) (n ϭ 2). Significant differences (*; **, and ***) are shown in the binding of Nbs to MERS-S1 or MERS-RBD at various concentrations. (C) The binding kinetics between NbMS10 or NbMS10-Fc and MERS-CoV RBD or S1 protein were measured by SPR. MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein was used for binding to NbMS10 (containing a C-terminal His 6 ), and S1-His protein was used for binding to NbMS10-Fc (containing a C-terminal human Fc). (D) Detection of NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV infection (EMC2012 strain) by a microneutralization assay. The Nb-MERS-CoV mixtures were incubated with Vero E6 cells and observed for the presence or absence of CPE. Neutralizing activity of Nbs was recorded as the concentration of Nbs in complete inhibition of MERS-CoV-induced CPE in at least 50% of the wells (ND 50 ). The data are expressed as mean ND 50 Ϯ the SD (n ϭ 3). The experiments were repeated twice, and similar results were obtained. The "(Ϫ) control" in panels A, B, and D refers to SARS-CoV 33G4 mouse MAb. whereas the K d between NbMS10-Fc and S1-His was 0.35 nM (Fig. 2C) . Third, we carried out MERS-CoV neutralization assay. The result showed that the Nbs efficiently neutralized the infection of live MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain) in Vero cells. The measured 50% neutralization doses (ND 50 ) were 3.52 g/ml for NbMS10 and 2.33 g/ml for NbMS10-Fc (Fig. 2D ). Taken together, the Nbs strongly bound to MERS-CoV RBD and neutralized MERS-CoV infection. Molecular mechanism underlying the neutralizing activities of Nbs. To investigate the mechanism underlying the neutralizing activities of Nbs, we evaluated the competition between the Nbs and hDPP4 for the binding to MERS-CoV RBD. First, we carried out a flow cytometry assay where recombinant MERS-CoV RBD interacted with cell-surface-expressed DPP4 in the presence or absence of recombinant Nbs. The result showed that both Nbs significantly blocked the binding of RBD to cell-surface DPP4 in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 3A and B) . As a negative control, SARS-CoV-RBDspecific 33G4 MAb did not block the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and cell surface DPP4 ( Fig. 3A and B) . Second, we carried out an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) where recombinant MERS-CoV RBD and recombinant hDPP4 interacted in the presence or absence of recombinant Nbs. The result showed that both Nbs, but not were coated with MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein (2 g/ml), followed by sequential incubation with serial dilutions of Nbs or hDPP4 protein (2 g/ml), goat anti-hDPP4, and HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibodies. The percent inhibition was calculated as the RBD-hDPP4 binding in the presence or absence of Nbs according to the following formula: (1 Ϫ RBD-hDPP4-Nb/RBD-hDPP4) ϫ 100. A significant difference (***) occurred between NbMS10 and NbMS10-Fc in inhibition of RBD-hDPP4 binding. The "(Ϫ) control" in panels B and C refers to SARS-CoV 33G4 MAb. The data are presented as the mean percent inhibition Ϯ the SD (n ϭ 2). The experiments were repeated twice, and similar results were obtained. 33G4 MAb, blocked the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4 in a dosedependent manner. Moreover, compared to NbMS10, NbMS10-Fc blocked the RBD-DPP4 binding more efficiently (Fig. 3C) . These data reveal that the Nbs can compete with hDPP4 for the binding to MERS-CoV RBD, suggesting that the Nb-binding site and the DPP4-binding site overlap on the MERS-CoV RBD. To map the binding site of the Nbs on MERS-CoV RBD, we performed alanine scanning on the surface of MERS-CoV RBD and detected the binding of Nbs to the alanine-containing RBD mutants. The results showed that NbMS10 demonstrated tight binding to MERS-CoV RBD containing the single mutations L506A, D510A, R511A, E513A, E536A, W553A, V555A, and E565A and slightly reduced binding to RBD containing triple mutations L506F-D509G-V534A, suggesting that these RBD residues do not play significant roles in Nb binding. Instead, single mutation D539A and double mutations E536A-D539A on MERS-CoV RBD both ablated the binding of NbMS10 to the RBD (Fig. 4A) , suggesting that RBD residue Asp539 plays an important role in Nb binding. We further investigated the role of Asp539 in Nb binding using the MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry assay. Neither NbMS10 nor NbMS10-Fc could neutralize the cell entry of MERS-CoV pseudovirus bearing the D539A mutation, again confirming that residue Asp539 is critical for Nb binding (Fig. 4B ). To examine of the role of the D539A mutation in DPP4 binding, we carried out an ELISA to detect the binding between DPP4 and The plates were coated with RBD-Fd protein (2 g/ml) and treated with or without DTT, followed by sequential incubation with serial dilutions of NbMS10 or NbMS10-Fc and goat anti-llama and HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibodies. The data are presented as mean A 450 values Ϯ the SD (n ϭ 2). The "(Ϫ) control" in panels B and D refers to SARS-CoV 33G4 MAb. The above-described experiments were repeated twice, and similar results were obtained. MERS-CoV RBD bearing the D539A mutation. The result showed that the D539A mutation significantly reduced the binding of the RBD to DPP4 (Fig. 4C ). Overall, these results demonstrate that Nbs recognize the Asp539-containing epitope on MERS-CoV RBD and that this epitope also plays an important role in DPP4 binding. Therefore, the Nbs and DPP4 compete for the same region on MERS-CoV RBD, and mutations in this region can reduce the binding of both the Nbs and DPP4. To investigate whether Nb-recognized epitopes on MERS-CoV RBD are conformational or linear, we detected the binding of Nbs to MERS-CoV RBD with its conformational structure disrupted. To this end, we treated MERS-CoV RBD with reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) to break the disulfide bonds in the protein, and performed an ELISA on the binding between Nbs and DTT-treated RBD. The result showed that neither NbMS10 nor NbMS10-Fc bound to the DTT-treated RBD (Fig. 4D) . As a control, both Nbs bound to untreated RBD with high affinity. Thus, the Nbs recognize the conformational epitope on the RBD. To understand the structural mechanism underlying the neutralizing activities of the Nbs, we examined the competitive interactions among the Nbs, DPP4, and MERS-CoV RBD using structural modeling (Fig. 5 ). In the absence of the Nbs, MERS-CoV RBD binds tightly to the DPP4 receptor, with D539 of RBD serving as a key residue at the binding interface (Fig. 5A) . Here, RBD residue D539 forms a critical salt bridge with DPP4, and it interacts with the surrounding key RBD residues via van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds (Fig. 5B) , enabling RBD and DPP4 to maintain strong binding inter- actions. The Nbs bind tightly to the RBD in the same D539-containing region, abolishing the binding between RBD and DPP4 (Fig. 5C) . Cross-neutralizing activity of Nbs against divergent MERS-CoV strains. To investigate the cross-neutralizing activity of Nbs against divergent MERS-CoV isolates, we performed MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry assay in the presence of the Nbs where the pseudoviruses encode the S gene of various MERS-CoV isolates from different countries (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and South Korea), hosts (human and camels), and time periods (2012 to 2015). These MERS-CoV strains all contain mutations in their RBDs. The results showed that both Nbs potently neutralized the cell entry of all of the MERS-CoV pseudoviruses, with the ND 50 values ranging from 0.003 to 0.979 g/ml (for NbMS10) and from 0.003 to 0.067 g/ml (for NbMS10-Fc) ( Table 1) . Therefore, although the Nbs were developed using the RBD from one MERS-CoV strain (EMC2012), they have broad-spectrum cross-neutralizing activity against existing MERS-CoV strains, as well as potentially future emerging MERS-CoV strains. In vivo half-life of Nbs. To evaluate the in vivo half-life of the Nbs, we injected the Nbs into mice, collected the sera from the mice after different time intervals, and measured the binding between the sera and recombinant MERS-CoV S1 using ELISA. The results showed that the sera collected from NbMS10-injected mice gradually lost their binding affinity for MERS-CoV S1, and completely lost their binding for MERS-CoV S1 10 days postinjection (Fig. 6A ). In comparison, NbMS10-Fc demonstrated stable binding for recombinant MERS-CoV S1 at 10 days postinjection (Fig. 6B) . As a control experiment, sera collected from PBS-injected mice showed no binding for recombinant MERS-CoV S1 (Fig. 6C) . Thus, compared to monomeric Nb, Fc-fused Nb has a significantly extended in vivo half-life likely due to its dimeric structure, which increases the molecular weight of Nb from 16 to 50 kDa and hence may slow down its renal clearance. Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of Nb in transgenic mice. Because MERS-CoV does not infect wild-type mice, we previously developed hDPP4-Tg mice (38) as the susceptible animal model for MERS-CoV research. To evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of NbMS10-Fc, mice were injected with a single dose of NbMS10-Fc 3 days before they were infected with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV and were subsequently monitored for their weight and survival. Trastuzumab, an antibody used for treating breast cancer, was used as a control. The result showed that after MERS-CoV infection, mice treated with NbMS10-Fc had a 100% survival rate (Fig. 7A, above) and steady weight (Fig. 7A, below) . In comparison, mice treated with trastuzumab all died on day 8 postinfection, and their weight also sharply decreased starting from day 4 postinfection (Fig. 7A) . To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of NbMS10-Fc, mice were first infected with MERS-CoV and then treated with single-dose NbMS10-Fc either 1 or 3 days postinfection. The result showed that mice treated with NbMS10-Fc on day 1 postinfection had a 100% survival rate and steady weight (Fig. 7B ). In addition, mice treated with NbMS10-Fc on day 3 postinfection also had a 100% survival rate (Fig. 7C , above); although their weights first decreased on day 5 postinfection, it rebounded on day 7 postinfection (Fig. 7C, below) . In comparison, mice receiving trastuzumab all died on day 8 after infection, and their weights continuously decreased ( Fig. 7B and C) . Overall, NbMS10-Fc has potent prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in protecting susceptible animal models against lethal MERS-CoV challenge. . Virus-challenged mice were monitored for 14 days to evaluate survival rate (above) and body weight changes (below). The body weight data are presented as means Ϯ the SD of mice in each group (n ϭ 6). Significant differences (** and ***) are indicated between the NbMS10-Fc and control groups.
