Three virophages characterized in earlier studies were assayed with these giant viruses, including Guarani, Sputnik and Zamilon virophages 6, 12, 24 Soda Lake ( Fig. 1a and 1b) . Unexpectedly, it was not possible to detect Guarani replication with Tupanvirus Deep Ocean or Tupanvirus Soda Lake ( Fig. 1a and 1b) . After the lysis of host cells coinfected with Guarani and Tupanvirus Deep Ocean or Tupanvirus Soda Lake, each culture supernatant was filtered through 0.22-Âµm-pore filters to remove giant virus particles. The obtained supernatants containing only Guarani particles were subsequently used to infect fresh A. castellanii cells simultaneously inoculated with Tupanvirus Deep Ocean or Tupanvirus Soda Lake. The replication of the virophage was then measured by qPCR. In these assays, Guarani remarkably infected and successfully replicated with both Tupanvirus Deep Ocean and Tupanvirus Soda Lake after only one passage with each virus (Fig. 2a and 2b) . We interpreted this phenomenon as the result of a mechanism of host range expansion that allowed Guarani to replicate with new viral hosts previously resistant to this virophage. A small fraction of the Guarani population in our stocks was likely composed of an emergent mutant able to infect Tupanvirus. We found that Guarani isolated author/funder. All rights reserved.

Taken together, these results present the first evidence of a host range expansion in the virophage. We then analyzed whether host acquisition of Guarani was associated with a fitness trade-off with the prototype isolate of genus Mimivirus, Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV), which has been used beforehand to propagate the wild-type genotype of Guarani 24, 25 . Indeed, experimental evolution studies for other viruses have shown that increasing the virus fitness in one host could result in a fitness penalty in another host 1 . We compared the replication efficiency of Guarani before and after its passages with each Tupanvirus strain using APMV as a giant virus host. Figure 2c shows that even after the acquisition of new virus hosts, the virophage maintained its capacity to replicate with APMV. In addition, the replication efficiency of Guarani isolated from Tupanvirus Deep Ocean and Tupanvirus Soda Lake supernatants with APMV was similar to that of the original strain of Guarani propagated with APMV (Student's t-test, p> 0.66 and p >0.69, respectively). Similar results were obtained with Moumouvirus and Megavirus Courdo 11, which are mimiviruses from lineages B and C, respectively 26, 27 (Fig. 2c ).
