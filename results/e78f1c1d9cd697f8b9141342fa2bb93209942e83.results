The 5V -terminal sequences (nt 1-1263) The nt sequence alignment data obtained from the IBV 5V-termini are presented in Table 1 , Figs. 1 and 2a. The leader sequences (nt 1 -64) of H52, CU705, CU510, Ark99, ArkDPI, CU805, CU570, GA98, Cal99, CU994, K1699, Gray, and BJ strains are identical to each other and each have 3 nt substitutions compared to the Beaudette strain (Fig. 1 ). The DE072 virus has four, the vaccine and challenge M41 strains, and CU-T2 have three, Ma5, K0751, and Florida have two, and Conn has a single nt substitution compared to the Beaudette strain (Fig. 1) . The leader junction sequences termed as leader transcriptionregulating sequences (TRSs) are absolutely conserved in all of the IBV strains compared. The sequence distance data (Table 1 ) obtained from the whole 5V UTR (nt 1 -528) indicate that nt sequence identities were 94 -100% among all IBV strains in this region. The N-terminal coding region (nt 529-1263) of the 5V terminal sequence is more variable with the lowest identity represented by the BJ strain at 84.6-86% identity with the other strains. Pairwise comparisons of the N-terminal sequences from other strains revealed 89.7-100% identity irrespective of serotype, geographic source, and virulence (Table 1 ). The challenge strain NV M41 is identical to the vaccine strain M41 in the noncoding region but in the coding region has a single nt change that results in an amino acid change (data not shown). These relationships are graphically shown in the phylogenetic tree created from the nt sequences of the entire 5V terminal region (Fig. 2a) . No detectable sequence similarity was found when IBV 5V terminal sequences were compared to those of coronaviruses from other groups (data not shown). The PL pro domains (nt 4243 -5553: aa 1239-1675) Sequence distance data derived from multiple alignments of the two overlapping PL pro domains of IBV strains revealed 77.6 -100% identity in PL1 pro and 79 -100% in Fig. 1 . Alignment of the first 80 nucleotides from cDNA sequences derived from the 5V end of 22 heterologous IBV strains. The gray shading represents differences between sequences. The leader sequence is denoted by a solid black line above the sequence and the leader junction sequence is boxed. Sequences with >95% identity are indicated in bold letters. a Because of the overall sequence identity of the vaccine and challenge strains of M41, for brevity, only the vaccine strain is included in this table. PL2 pro , with the former being more variable than the latter ( Table 2 ). The BJ strain differed the most from other strains by 18.1 -22.4% in PL1 pro and 16.5-21% in PL2 pro . The catalytic Cys 1274 and His 1437 residues in the PL pro domains are conserved in all IBV strains (Fig. 3 ). In the overlapping area of the PL pro domains, a region of 24 residues with more heterogeneity has been identified, where only two residues (Phe 1470 and Lys 1485 ) are conserved among all IBV strains (Fig. 3) . In this heterogeneous region, the vaccine and challenge M41 and BJ strains each differed by 12 aa (50%), Conn, CU510, Florida, CU805, and Gray each differed by 11 aa (45%), CU705, Ark99, and Cal99 strains each differed by 10 aa (40%), and all other strains are identical to each other and differed by 9 aa (37.5%) when compared to the Beaudette strain sequence. In the complete PL pro domain, the NV M41 challenge strain has 1 nt and 1 aa difference from the M41 vaccine strain. The relationships between the different sequences are shown in the phylogenetic tree derived from analysis of the aa sequences of the entire PL pro region (aa 1239 -1675) (Fig. 2b) . No detectable sequence similarity was found when IBV PL pro sequences were compared to the PL pro sequences of coronaviruses from other groups (data not shown). The M pro (aa ORF1a 2804 -2943) and the RdRp (aa ORF1b 548 -780) domains The alignments of the deduced aa sequences of IBV M pro and RdRp domains are summarized in Table 3 . The overall sequences are highly conserved in which there are 82.7% (116 aa) absolutely conserved residues in M pro and 92.7% (216 aa) absolutely conserved residues in RdRp (data not shown). The remaining 24 aa differences found in M pro and 17 aa differences in RdRp are distributed throughout the domains (Table 3 ). The M pro and RdRp domains of ArkDPI, GA98, and Gray strains are identical to each other and those of the challenge NV M41 and vaccine M41 strains are also identical to each other. These relationships are graphically shown in the phylogenetic tree created from the aa sequences of the M pro and RdRp domains (Figs. 2c and d). By aligning with the corresponding regions of prototype members of other coronavirus groups, all M pro had 28% (40 aa) absolutely conserved residues including catalytic Cys-His dyad and three substrate-binding sites (Tyr-Met-His), and the RdRp had 47.6% (111 aa) absolutely conserved residues (data not shown). The four RdRp motifs (DXXXD, SGXXXTXXXN, SDD, and K) appear to be fully conserved Sequences with >95% identity are indicated in bold letters. a Because of the overall sequence identity of the vaccine and challenge strains of M41, for brevity, only the vaccine strain is included in this table. 2829 2831 2835 2840 2845 2847 2848 2849 2851 2855 2860 2874 2881 2894 2898 2900 2906 2925 2928 2929 2935 2937 569 572 592 596 606 608 611 674 678 681 698 708 744 752 754 756 765 Beau .
