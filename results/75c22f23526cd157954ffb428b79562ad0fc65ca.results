Of the 853 children on asthma registers, we did not have contact telephone numbers for 59. Of these, 27 contacted the research team in response to the letter, and five expressed an interest in the study. The remaining 22 did not wish to participate, or stated that their child no longer had symptoms of asthma. Other reasons for declining participation included an unwillingness to take part in an arduous study, emigration, domestic difficulties, and the possibility that the project could interfere with school work. After a 2-week training period, 116 children entered the study. The study cohort included 63 boys and 51 girls (mean age 10·2 years, range 7·9-11·6 yrs). 72 children (63%) were atopic. Two children withdrew within 4 weeks of commencement because of poor compliance in recording the diary cards and wearing the NO 2 diffusion tubes, provision of nasal aspirate samples, and reluctance to take further part in the study. Mean follow-up was 37 weeks (range 3-49, excluding the summer recess between July and August, 1995). The mean FEV 1 at entry was 1·73 L (range 1·03-2·49) with a mean percent of predicted FEV 1 of 78% (49-105). 103 children (87%) used inhaled ␤ 2 agonists and 78 (67%) used regular inhaled corticosteroids. For cooking fuel, 35 children lived in households with gas only, 34 with gas and electricity, and 45 with electricity only. We collected a total of 29 405 child-days of NO 2 monitoring and diary data. 2·8% of respiratory symptom scores, 7% of PEF measurements, and 13·2% of NO 2 measurements were missing. Missing NO 2 measurements were mostly because of lost or damaged tubes. 99 children reported 280 upper respiratory-tract symptom episodes (colds) (mean=2·5, range 0-7 episodes per child). We detected infection in 219 episodes (78%). More than 70% of the episode samples were collected either on the same day or within 3 days of the start date of infection. We tested for all upper respiratory-tract infections in combination and by individual virus type (apart from C pneumoniae, influenza, parainfluenza, and adenoviruses because of insufficient numbers). The distribution of the individual NO 2 exposures before upper respiratory-tract infections was divided into low (<7·5 µg/m 3 ), medium (7·5-14 µg/m 3 ), and high (>14 µg/m 3 ) tertiles and the changes in lower respiratory-tract score or PEF rates over these groups were assessed. The number of infections with sufficient exposure and diary card data that we used in the analyses by low, medium, and high tertiles of exposure were 62, 60, and 60, respectively, for all viruses combined; 42, 33, and 34 for picornavirus; 13, 16, and 12 for respiratory syncytial virus; and 8, 8, and 11 for coronavirus. The frequency of M pneumoniae was higher than anticipated, which might have occurred because the study period coincided with a cyclical M pneumoniae epidemic year. As 30 of 43 (70%) M pneumoniae infections were identified in association with another virus (mostly picornavirus), we did not test for M pneumoniae as an individual agent. However, they were included for all infections combined. WHO recommends a 1 h guideline of 200 µg/m 3 , and an annual average of 40 µg/m 3 as a safe threshold to protect public health. 17 The tertiles of NO 2 exposure used in this study are much lower than levels mentioned by WHO, although 23 (20%) children recorded at least one personal NO 2 exposure of more than 100 µg/m 3 , 32 (>1%) of the total personal measurements were greater than 100 µg/m 3 , and 599 (14%) were less than 5 µg/m 3 . Median personal NO 2 exposure was higher in children from families using gas for cooking (12·0 µg/m 3 [range 4·8-58·2]) compared with families using only electricity (8·5 µg/m 3 [4·2-15·6]), p<0·0001 (Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Median NO 2 exposures in the week before infection, the week after infection, and for the rest of the study period (excluding the week before and the week after infections) are reported by tertile in the table. Medians of the low, medium, and high tertiles of personal NO 2 exposure for children in homes where gas was used for cooking were 5·3, 10·2, and 22·9 µg/m 3 , respectively, and 5·1, 9·9, and 18·9 µg/m 3 , respectively for those in households where electricity was used for cooking. Of the total number of personal NO 2 measurements across the tertiles, the proportion from children from gas-cooking homes were 51%, 62%, and 78%, for the low, medium, and high tertiles of exposure, respectively. Personal NO 2 exposures varied widely from week to week and from child to child. Analysis of variance showed that variation in exposure within participants accounted for much more of the scatter (74%) than did the variance between children (26%). Median lower respiratory-tract scores in the week before infection for all children was 1·1 (range 0-8) and 2·1 (range 0-18) in the week after infection. Median PEF rates in the weeks before and after infection were 302 L/min (110-460) and 286 L/min (50-440), respectively. The severity of lower respiratory-tract symptoms was increased and PEF measurements dropped with rising personal NO 2 exposure in the week before infection when analysed for all respiratory-tract infections in combination, and for the two most common cold viruses (picornavirus and respiratory syncytial virus) (figure 1). The exposureresponse relationship with lower respiratory-tract scores was significant for all virus types together and for respiratory syncytial virus alone, with increases in symptom scores of 0·6 (95% CI 0·01-1·18) and 2·1 (0·52-3·81), respectively with an exposure of more than 14 µg/m 3 compared with one of less than 7·5 µg/m 3 (figure 1). Trends across the three NO 2 tertiles were significant in both cases (all viruses, p=0·05; respiratory syncytial virus, p=0·01). An exposureresponse relationship with the severity of reduction in PEF was significant for picornavirus with a reduction of 12 L/min (95% CI -23·6 to -0·80) associated with exposure greater than 14 µg/m 3 compared with exposure less than 7·5 µg/m 3 (p for trend across tertiles=0·04; figure 1 ). There was no significant change in lower respiratory-tract symptoms or PEF measurements with high personal NO 2 exposure in the week after infection.
