Based on the filtering analysis, 14 out of the 94 keywords are not related to influenza epidemics, 20 keywords do not have sequential time series due to low search volume and only 40 keywords are significantly correlated to the case data (see Table 2 ). With the stepwise approach, only 8 of the 40 keywords are used in the composite search index (see Table 3 ). The estimated crosscorrelation coefficient between the search index and influenza case data is 0.96 at lag 0 ( Figure 1 ). Influenza epidemics are observed in the spring and winter as expected. Note that the search index clearly captures the peaks and troughs of the influenza time series curve, thereby making it a good indicator for influenza activity in China. The coefficients b 0 b 1 b 2 for model (2) are 0.56 (P = 0.001), 0.25 (P,0.001) and 20.14 (P = 0.004) respectively. Note the model's Rsquared is 0.95 and the AIC is 18.50. In addition, the Durbin-Watson test statistic is 1.89 suggesting that autocorrelation is not an issue (see Table 4 ). The null hypothesis of the Durbin-Watson test is that the autocorrelation parameter is zero. The model is validated by predicting influenza cases one month at a time, from January 2012 to August 2012. The results are listed in Figure 2 and Table 5 . The mean absolute percent error of prediction for the consecutive eight months is 10.6% (see Table 5 ). We also consider models with second order lags and third order lags but neither of their statistical results are better than that of model [2] (see Tables S1 and S2).
