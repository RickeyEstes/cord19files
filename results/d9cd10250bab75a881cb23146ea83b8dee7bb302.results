We began by searching the penton base genes of HAdV-D for Chi nucleotide sequences that, in bacteria and bacteriophage, act as signals for recombination between homologous DNA (20) . By careful inspection, we identified Chi-like (Chi AD ) sequences, for example, 5=-TCTCCTGA-3= in HAdV-D37, in the relatively conserved region immediately 5= to HVL2 (Fig. 1) . We also noted that the nucleotide sequences of putative Chi AD were generally conserved within proteotypes but not between them. In other studies, patterned alterations of GC content in multiples of 15 nucleotides were shown to facilitate homologous recombination between adjacent brome mosaic virus ssRNAs through the formation of hairpin loops in the RNA (39, 40) . Our computational analysis of similar GC content transitions across whole HAdV-D genomes showed comparable patterns of GC/AT transition at predicted recombination hot spots around hypervariable gene segments in the three major capsid genes-the same segments that constitute the molecular identity of each virus (14, 19, (41) (42) (43) -including the region containing Chi AD immediately 5= to penton base HVL2 (see Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the supplemental material). We applied mFold (http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/ ?qϭmfold/dna-folding-form) to model the secondary structures of ssDNA surrounding and including Chi AD , within the GC/AT transition zone at HVL2. The structures were highly similar within proteotypes, less so between proteotypes (Fig. S2) , suggesting that patterned alterations in GC content generate secondary structures that facilitate homologous recombination between HAdV-D types sharing the same Chi AD . To examine the determinant(s) of homologous recombination among HAdV-Ds and specifically the role of Chi AD , we generated constructs with the Chi AD -containing GC/AT transition zones from the penton base genes of HAdV-D22 and -D64, both from the same HVL2 proteotype (14) , the former with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene without a promoter (D22GFP), and the latter with a CMVT7 (CMV stands for cytomegalovirus) promoter inserted (D64CMV) ( Fig. 2A) . In 293A cells, cotransfection of linearized D64CMV and D22GFP constructs resulted in GFP expression ( Fig. 2B and C). By PCR with primers specific to the recombinant product (Table S1 ) and subsequent sequencing, we confirmed that the two constructs had indeed recombined at the expected location ( Fig. 2D and E), the same recombination locus often seen in HAdV-D recombination in nature (19) . Prior work suggested that a single nucleotide change in Chi can reduce homologous recombination events (44) , with particular emphasis on the importance of the thymidine (T) at the third position (45, 46) . We generated targeted mutations in both constructs to test the specificity of Chi AD at the single nucleotide level, while maintaining homology between constructs for cotransfections. Chi AD nucleotide identities were determined for HVL2 in each of 38 HAdV-Ds to determine a consensus sequence (Fig. 2F ). Mutants not found in any known virus were generated, and nine were selected for testing, including one with nucleotide changes synonymous to D64/22 (SY), one with reverse sequence (RE), one with antisense sequence (AS), and six randomly selected. Mutating Chi AD reduced homologous recombination between vector constructs except for the SY mutant (Fig. 2G) . Subsequent mFold analysis showed that the predicted secondary structure for the SY construct and the location of Chi AD in that secondary structure were highly similar to those of the parent Chi AD (Fig. 2H) . None of the other predicted structures for Chi AD mutants were similar. The RE mutation, which maintained T at the third position and was expected to undergo homologous recombination, had a predicted secondary structure distinctly different from that of the naturally occurring Chi AD . Therefore, nucleotide sequence and secondary structure may be considered covariant determinants of homologous recombination. The human gut microbiota includes trillions of bacteria and countless bacteriophage (47) . Their evolution is driven in part by Rec protein-mediated homologous recombination, specifically the unwinding of dsDNA by the RecBCD complex and upon recognition of Chi, the loading of RecA onto the ssDNA (48) . We quantified homologous recombination between Chi AD constructs in the presence of an endotoxin-free lysate of E. coli strain K-12 in comparison to a lysate from the K-12 RecA mutant strain DH5␣. By trypan blue exclusion, bacterial cell lysates induced no cell toxicity (data not shown). As predicted, the K-12 lysate promoted more homologous recombination between constructs than the DH5␣ lysate (Fig. 3A) . The presence of RecA in lysates from each strain . Thirty-eight HAdV-D genomes were aligned by maximum likelihood analysis, a tree (left) was built based on the amino acid sequences of penton base hypervariable loop 2 (HVL2), and the HAdV-D genomes were divided into proteotypes as previously described (14) , shown by a horizontal line separating the virus type names. The 30 nucleotides shown include the junction between conserved nucleotide sequence (black) and HVL2 nucleotide sequence (blue), with 15 nucleotides on either side of the junction. The Chi AD motifs (shown on gray background) fall predominantly within the conserved sequence but include one nucleotide within the hypervariable sequence. was confirmed by Western blotting. To determine whether the effect was specific to RecA, we also tested K-12 lysates from which we depleted RecA protein with immunomagnetic beads and found that RecA-depleted K-12 lysate induced less recombination than lysate with mock depletion (Fig. 3B ). We next examined the effects of lysates from K-12, DH5␣, and RecA-depleted K-12 on penton base HVL2 recombination between two wild-type viruses with conserved Chi AD , HAdV-D19 and HAdV-D29, chosen because of sufficient sequence disparity in HVL1 and HVL2 to permit PCR discrimination of recombinants. We coinfected both viruses in the intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 (clone C2BBe1) and used conventional and quantitative PCR (qPCR) ( Fig. 3C and D, respectively) to identify recombination of penton base HVL2 between viruses. E. coli K-12 lysate promoted recombination relative to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and to a greater degree than either E. coli DH5␣ or RecA-depleted K-12, with the effect statistically significant by 7 days postinfection. The same results were evident in A549 cells, a lung carcinoma cell line (Fig. S3 ). Because an increase in viral replication due to bacterial lysate could have accounted for the apparent increase in recombined viral DNA (49), we also infected each cell type in the presence of K-12 lysate or PBS control and performed qPCR with primers specific to sequence conserved between the hexon genes of both viruses (Table S1 ). Relative to treatment with PBS, K-12 lysate appeared to reduce but not prevent viral replication through 8 days postinfection in either cell line ( Fig. 4A to D). Upon coinfection and subsequent assay by qPCR, the recombinant accounted for less than 0.1% of total viral DNA in either C2BBe1 (Fig. 4E ) or A549 cells (Fig. 4F) . The relative increase in the ratio of recombinant viral DNA to total viral DNA in the presence of K-12 lysate was maintained when total viral replication was taken into account. Therefore, the absolute number of viral recombinants increased in the presence of bacterial lysates despite a general inhibition of viral replication. Adenovirus-infected cells at the time of viral replication have lost the capacity for cellular biosynthesis, and these cells are in the early phases of virus-induced cell death with reduced integrity to their cellular membranes (50) . In addition, HAdV-D37 was previously shown to release the ectodomain of MUC16 from ocular surface cells, suggesting that adenoviruses may have intrinsic means of reducing overall mucosal barrier function (51) . We next performed confocal microscopy to determine whether RecA would colocalize with viral DNA in infection of C2BBe1 cells (Fig. 5A) . Coinfection with 5-ethynyl-2=-deoxyuridine (EdU)-labeled HAdV-D19 and HAdV-D29 was performed in the presence of E. coli K-12 lysate, and the cells were imaged at 12 h postinfection. RecA protein was identified only in the nuclei of infected cells, where it colocalized with (Fig. S4) . Healthy, uninfected cells excluded Rec proteins. We next performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 6 days after coinfection of C2BBe1 cells pretreated with K-12 lysate. Binding of the IgG control was extremely low (data not shown), so we compared RecA binding of HVL2 Chi AD with binding of RecA to conserved genomic regions without Chi AD : one in protein VI and another at the conserved 3= end of the penton base gene. RecA binding to penton base sequence containing Chi AD was~14-fold greater than to control regions of HAdV DNA (Fig. 5B ). There are noncanonical pathways of RecA loading that function in the absence of RecBCD in phage (52) . To determine whether RecBCD or other bacterial proteins are required for a putative interaction between RecA and Chi AD , we repeated ChIP with recombinant RecA instead of E. coli lysate. The ratios of binding to Chi AD relative to other regions of the genome were similar (Fig. 5B) . Relative to IgG, binding with K-12 lysate was twice that observed with recombinant RecA (data not shown). These data show specificity of RecA binding to Chi AD and suggest that RecBCD dispensably improves binding.
