We have presented a systematic and quantitative approach to discover human disease comorbidities using different sources of available mRNA expression, protein-protein interactions, signalling pathways, disease-gene associations, disease-disease associations and disease-drug associations data. It has been shown that SARS coronavirus infects and replicates in a wide variety of host cells in susceptible animals and human beings [55, 56] . To understand the host response to this pathogen, we analysed the gene expression patterns of SARS infected patients, compared to normal subjects using oligonucleotide microarrays from the NCBI GEO (http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE1739) [55] . We analysed the microarray gene expression data of over 8,700 genes from the PBMCs of 10 SARS patients, and compared with healthy control samples. We found that 274 genes (p < 0.01, > 1.5 fold change) were differentially expressed as compared to healthy controls in which 120 genes were significantly up regulated and 154 genes were significantly down regulated (see Additional file 1: Table S1 ). On the other hand, monocytes are the key immune responsive cells whose function is adversely impacted by HIV-1. HIV-1 infection radically alters the monocyte phenotype, which is reflected in an HIV-1 induced gene expression analysis. Monocyte gene expression microarray data were collected for control and HIV patients from the NCBI GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/ acc.cgi?acc=GSE18464) [57] . To find out the significant dysregulated genes during the HIV-1 infection, we have performed global gene expression analysis. We found that 186 genes (p < 0.01, > 1.5 fold change) were differentially expressed as compared to healthy controls in which 71 genes were up regulated and 115 genes were down regulated (see Additional file 2: Table S2 ). Considering the significantly dysregulated genes of SARS (274 genes) and HIV-1 (186 genes) infections, and gene-disease associations information, we have constructed two gene-disease associations networks (GDN), which are used to explore the shared genetic associations and disease comorbidity. Starting from the bipartite graph we generated biologically relevant network projections and constructed multi-relational gene-disease network in which nodes are diseases or genes, and edges indicate association between gene and disease. This bipartite http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/333 graph consists of two disjoint sets of nodes, where one set corresponds to all known genetic disorders and the other set corresponds to all of our identified significant genes for SARS and HIV-1 infections. The list of disorders, disease genes, and associations between them were obtained from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [58] , a compendium of human disease genes and phenotypes (see details in the Methods section). We classified each disorder into one of 21 disorder categories based on the physiological system affected as introduced in Goh, Cusick, Valle, Childs, Vidal, Barabasi et al. [14] . In the GDN, nodes represent diseases class or genes, and two disorders are connected to each other if they share at least one gene in which mutations are associated with both diseases groups (Figures 1 and 2 ). The number of interlinked genes between SARS infection and other diseases indicates that immunological, hematological, neurological, metabolic and dermatological diseases categories are strongly associated with the SARS infection (see Figure 1 and Additional file 3: Table S3 ). Few genes are also shared between more than 2 categories of diseases i.e those disease groups are also associated through at least that genes. For an instance, the gene ATM shared among SARS infection, cancer and immunological diseases. Therefore, cancer and immunological diseases are also interrelated through the gene ATM. Among all these disease classes immunological diseases class is tightly correlated with the SARS infection due to the highest number of genes (12 genes) shared between them. On the other hand, the number of associated genes between HIV infection and other diseases indicates that neurological, metabolic, cancer and hematological diseases categories are strongly correlated with the HIV infection (see Figure 2 and Additional file 4: Figure 1 The gene-disease association network centred on the SARS infection is constructed based on the different categories of diseases that are connected and showed comorbidities with the SARS infection through the different genes. Red colour represents different categories of disorders and green colour represents different genes that are common with the other categories of disorders. The size of a disease node is proportional to the number of dysregulated genes shared between the infections/disorder groups. A link is placed between a disorder and a disease gene if mutations in that gene lead to the specific disorder. http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/333 Figure 2 The gene-disease association network centred on the HIV infection is constructed based on the different categories of diseases that are connected and showed comorbidities with the HIV-1 infection through the different genes. Red colour represents different categories of disorders and green colour represents different genes that are common with the other categories of disorders. The size of a disease node is proportional to the number of dysregulated genes shared between the infections/disorder groups. A link is placed between a disorder and a disease gene if mutations in that gene lead to the specific disorder. Table S4 ). Few HIV dysregulated genes are also shared between more than 2 categories of diseases such as the gene TGFB1 is shared among HIV infection, cancer and skeletal diseases. It is notable that 11 significant genes (4 upregulated and 7 downregulated) are similarly dysregulated in the both SARS and HIV infections. To observe the association of SARS and HIV infections with other 7 important diseases (chronic heart failure, kidney disorders, breast cancer, parkinson, osteoporosis, type 1 and type 2 diabetes), we have collected mRNA microarray raw data associated with each disease from the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) accession numbers are GSE9006, GSE9128, GSE15072, GSE7158, GSE8977 and GSE7621 [59] . After several steps of statistical analysis we have selected the most significant over and under expressed genes for each infection and disease. We also performed cross compare analysis to find the common significant genes between each disease and SARS/ HIV-1 infection. We observed that SARS infection shares 21, 12, 16, 5, 11, 11, 11 and 13 genes corresponding to the chronic heart failure, kidney disorders, breast cancer, parkinson, osteoporosis, HIV-1 infection, type 1 and type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, HIV-1 infection shares 11, 10, 17, 9, 7, 11, 9 and 7 genes corresponding to the chronic heart failure, kidney disorders, breast cancer, parkinson, osteoporosis, SARS infection, type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Then we built disease-disease relationships network for SARS and HIV-1 infection with other diseases (see Figures 3 (a) and (b) and Additional file 5: Table S5 and Additional file 6: Table S6 ). Since genes do not function alone and they coordinate their activities in the form of complexes or molecular pathways. Therefore two diseases are potentially inter-correlated to each other if they share at least one commonly associated pathway. For this http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/333 reason we have used reactome pathway database [60] and selected the pathways related to these 7 diseases as well as SARS and HIV-1 infections. We have observed that diseases and infections shared pathways between them as shown in Figures 3 (a) and (b) and Additional file 5: Table  S5 and Additional file 6: Table S6 . Dysregulation in a protein subnetwork may yield the dysfunction of multiple protein subnetworks. Therefore, multiple diseases may be caused by the malfunction of a protein complex. So, two diseases are potentially related to each other if they share one or more commonly associated protein subnetwork. To identify the association between diseases based on the PPI subnetwork, we used significantly associated disease protein pairs data from the HPRD data base [61] . To find statistically significant associations among diseases, we built disease networks centred on the SARS and HIV infections in which two diseases are comorbid if there exists one or more protein subnetwork that are associated with both diseases. The disease similarity network and the protein-protein interaction network are integrated systematically and comprehensively in a simple and compact manner to formulate the disease comorbidity for the SARS and HIV-1 infections as shown in Figures 4 and 5. We showed that SARS and HIV infections shared PPI subnetworks with the other 7 diseases or infections similar to the gene-disease and pathway-disease associations as shown in Figures 4 and 5 . Based on the gene expression, protein-protein interaction and molecular pathways data, we have found that both SARS and HIV-1 infections have a strong association with other 8 diseases or infections (chronic heart failure, kidney disorders, breast cancer, parkinson, osteoporosis, HIV/SARS infection, type 1 and type 2 diabetes). These diseases and infections are also strongly correlated among them. We present the correlation strength and distance between a pair of these diseases and infections in Figure 6 . We show that some diseases (such as kidney disorders, breast cancer, osteoporosis and heart failure) are more associated with the SARS infection (see Figure 6 ). Kidney disorder is also tightly connected with the HIV-1 infection. The probability of occurring comorbidities between the more tightly connected diseases is more than that of others. It is notable that the patient medical records contain important evidence regarding the co-occurrences of diseases affecting the same patient. So, we constructed a phenotypic disease comorbidity network using 32 million medical records of 13039018 patients data from MedPAR and analysed its structural properties to better understand the connections among diseases and infections. Nodes are unique diseases and edges indicate co-morbidity of the diseases. We included edges between disease pairs for which the co-occurrence is significantly greater than the random expectation based on population prevalence of the diseases. As pointed out in [2] , the Relative Risk (RR ij ) overestimates relations involving rare infections and diseases, and underestimates relationships between very common disorders or infections. On the other hand, φ-correlation underestimates comorbidity between rare and frequent diseases, and discriminates associations between disorders of similar appearances. Thus, we built a network by selecting only the statistically significant network edges having RR ij ≥ 20 and φ ij ≥ 0.06. Figure 7 summarises the set of all comorbidity associations among all diseases expressed in the study population by constructing a Phenotypic Disease Network (PDN). In the PDN, nodes are disease phenotypes identified by unique ICD-9-CM (The International Classification of Diseases) disease codes, and links connect phenotypes that show significant comorbidity according to the relative risk RR ij ≥ 20 and the correlation φ ij ≥ 0.06. Our phenotypic disease network consists of 336 unique diseases nodes and 1018 co-morbidity relationships. SARS-associated coronavirus ICD-9-CM diagnosis code is 079.82, which is under the group of "Viral and chlamydial infection in conditions classified elsewhere and of unspecified site" and ICD-9-CM diagnosis code 079. Moreover, the ICD-9-CM code 480.3 is for the pneumonia due to SARS associated coronavirus. So we have considered both ICD-9-CM codes 079.82 and 480.3 for our phenotypic SARS comorbidity study. In our 3 digit code data we have considered 079 and for 5 digit code data we have considered 480.3. Considering the relative risk RR ij ≥ 10 between the disease group 079 and other disorder categories, we have constructed the PDN as shown in Figure 8 (a), and considering the relative risk RR ij ≥ 20 between the disease group 480.3 and other disorder categories, we have constructed the PDN as shown in Figure 8 (b). We presented only the most significant relative risk associations (see Additional file 7: Table S7 and Additional file 8: Table S8 ). The ICD-9-CM diagnosis code for the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is 042 to 044, which is under the group of "Infectious and parasitic diseases" and ICD-9-CM code (001-139). So we have considered both 3 digit and 5 digit ICD-9-CM codes for our phenotypic comorbidity studies related to HIV infection. Considering the relative risk RR ij ≥ 20 between the disease group 042 and other disorder categories, we have constructed the PDN as shown in Figure 9 (a) and considering the relative risk RR ij ≥ 100 and φ-correlation φ ij ≥ 0.06 between the disease groups under the sub categories of 042 and other disorder categories, we have constructed the PDN as shown in Figure 9 (b). Only the most significant relative risk association is represented (see Additional file 9: Table  S9 and Additional file 10: Table S10 ). To observe the trend of phenotypic relative risk corresponding to the number of shared genes between 2 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/333 diseases, we have computed the number of shared genes between two diseases and their corresponding phenotypic relative risk of the occurrence of comorbidities as shown in Figure 10 . We observed that with increasing number of shared biomarker genes between 2 diseases, the phenotypic relative risk is also increased. We may predict existing diseases of a patient and the prospective disease comorbidities through the identification of highly up and down dysregulated genes. So based on the available data we could predict the disease comorbidities and the level of the comorbidities using the regression model as Figure 10 . It is notable that ageing is also a "disease", not a natural process, for which age-related diseases increase exponentially with chronological time. So, to understand the impact of ageing on the disease comorbidities for SARS and HIV infections we have considered the ageing data from the GenAge database (http://genomics.senescence. info/genes/human.html) [62, 63] . After cross comparing http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/333 Human lung epithelial cells are likely among the first targets to encounter invading severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [32] . Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the complex epithelial signalling to SARS-CoV is crucial to better understand SARS pathogenesis. Since both of the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections cause severe lung pathology we compare and contrast the genes expression level of SARS-CoV infection and MERS-CoV infection. To compare between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, and the affect on the disease comorbidities, we have performed the time series microarray data analysis for the both types of infections on lung compared to controls. We have considered gene expression microarray data from the NCBI GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/ acc.cgi?acc=GSE45042) [64] . From the analysis of SARS-CoV vs mock-infected controls (treated the same way except without the virus) we have found 215 genes are highly significant and from the analysis of MERS-CoV vs Mock we have found 234 gens are highly significant (see details in the Additional file 11: Table S11 and Additional  file 12: Table S12 ). Interestingly, only 4 genes (NFKBIA, EGR1, DDIT31 and IFIT2) are common between these two infections (see Figure 13 ). However, only 2 genes (NFKBIA and EGR1) play an important role and differentially expressed among the both infections in lung and also in SARS infected PBMCs. Then from the hierarchical cluster analysis of the differentially expressed genes of the lung infection by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we observed distinct groups of genes that were significantly changed over time (see Additional file 13: Figure S1 and Additional file 14: Figure S2 , and Additional file 11: Table S11 and Additional file 12: Table S12 ). The log fold changes of the common 4 genes (NFKBIA, EGR1, DDIT31 and IFIT2) expression level for the infection of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are presented in the Figures 14 and 15 . We observed that the log fold changes of NFKBIA genes expression level is sharply upregulated in the both types of infections corresponding to time point. So NFKBIA is an important bio-marker for the both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections. It is also observed that the inflammatory genes NFKBIA is a highly over expressed in the both PBMCs and lung cells for the infection of SARS and also for the infection of MERS in the lung cells (see Figure 16 ). Indeed, the immune system plays a pivotal role in the outbreak of the inflammatory state. So in case of SARS infection, the NFKBIA gene plays an important role for the disease comorbidities. On the other hand, similar diseases share common genes and could be treated by the same drugs [17] , which may allow us to make predictions for new uses of existing drugs. For an instance, the anti-diabetic drug metformin plays a major protective effect against cancer development and increases significantly higher survival rate of the cancer patients [65] . The finding is that the earlier the metformin regimen was initiated, the greater the http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/333 preventive benefit for the cancer patient. There is an evidence that the antiviral medication, ribavirin, does not work in case of SARS infection [66] . To this end, we used Connectivity Map (Cmap), which is a database of more than 1,400 drug transcriptional signatures in several cell lines [67] . This database allows to identify of molecules that induce similar or opposite transcriptional changes relative to the query signature, based on their connectivity enrichment scores. As a query signature we used our 274 highly dysregulated genes for the SARS infection. We generated the connectivity score value ranges between +1 and -1, where a highly positive score indicates that the drug induces changes similar to those induced by viral infection, while a highly negative score indicates that the drug reverses the expression of the SARS signature. Based on the connectivity score we have selected most potential positive and negative regulators of SARS viral response (see details in the Additional file 15: Table  S13 ). Potential negative regulators indicate that drugs reverse the SARS signature gene expression. Among the negative potential regulator, the drug molecule tetracycline, zalcitabine, gibberellic acid, prestwick-642 and sulfaquinoxaline are more potential for the MCF7 cell line and vorinostat for the HL60 cell line. Based on the data demonstrate the efficacy of different drug against SARS virus can be predicted effective drug treatment for the emergent viruses. Furthermore, immunomodulatory drugs that reduce the excessive host inflammatory response to respiratory viruses have therapeutic benefit to reduce the SARS infection as well as disease comorbidities.
