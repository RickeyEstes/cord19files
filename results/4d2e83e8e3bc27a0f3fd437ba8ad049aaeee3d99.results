We included 100 immunocompromised patients admitted to our ICU with ARF during the study period. Their main characteristics are listed in Table 1 . Median symptom duration at ICU admission was 3 1e6 days. The admission leukocyte count was 7.7 (3.4e14.9) 10 9 L À1 , and 6 (6%) patients had neutropenia at admission. At admission, PaO 2 was 11.3 (8.7e14.6) kPa with a mean oxygen rate of 6 2e12 L$min À1 , PaCO 2 was 4.88 (4.00e5.9) kPa, and pH was 7.42 (7.37e7.46). The use of life-supporting interventions and outcomes over time are reported in Table 1 . The MMA was performed on NPA in 45 (45%) patients and BAL fluid in 55 (55%). Immunofluorescence was positive in 8 (8%) patients and the MMA in 47 (47%) patients (P Z 0.006) ( Table 2) . After excluding rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, the difference remained highly significant (31% versus 8%, P < 0.0001). Coinfection with two viruses was detected in 5 patients using the MMA; the combinations were influenza A and rhinovirus, influenza A and hMPV, influenza A and adenovirus, influenza B and adenovirus, and PIV 2 and coronavirus OC43. .0] 10 9 L À1 vs. 7.2 [3.6e15.6]10 9 L À1 , respectively; P Z 0.67). By univariate analysis, a positive MMA was associated with being a solid organ transplant recipient (P Z 0.01), receiving immunosuppressants in the past month (P Z 0.05), and being tested on NPA (60% vs. 32%, P Z 0.01). No variable was significantly associated with a positive MMA by multivariate analysis. Study patients were classified into diagnostic categories based on a medical chart review (Fig. 1) . The MMA was positive in 30 of the 48 patients with lung infections and 17 of the 52 patients with non-infectious lung diseases. Results of microbial investigations are given in Table 3 . Coinfections with an RV and bacteria or fungi were found in 11 patients with infectious lung disease. These coinfections are described in Table 4 . All patients were considered as having bacterial or fungal lung infection. A patient with non-infectious lung disease had a respiratory sample positive with coagulase-negative Staphylococci and coronavirus NL63. These pathogens were not considered significant. Also, Table 3 compares the MMA-positive and MMA-negative patients in the subgroups with and without lung infection. In the subgroup of patients with noninfectious lung diseases, 12 patients had no diagnosis found at the end of the etiologic investigations. Multiplex molecular assay was positive in 6 (50%) of these patients.
