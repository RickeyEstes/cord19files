Over the 3-year study period (April 2013 to March 2016), respiratory viruses were detected in 3,328 of the 5,298 patients (62.8%) by multiplex real-time PCR. Of the 3,328 patients, 704 (21.2%) were diagnosed with post-viral pneumonia according to chest radiography and/or chest CT findings (in these patients, nasopharyngeal swab [653/704, 92.8%] and bronchoalveolar lavage/bronchial washing fluid [51/704, 7.2%] were used to detect respiratory virus). A total of 251 clinically significant bacterial pathogens were identified in 233 of the 704 patients (33.1%) with pneumonia ( Figure 1 ).
