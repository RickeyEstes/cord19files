The N-terminal fragment upstream of the RBD of the S glycoprotein forms a dimer It has been previously shown for another coronavirus (MHV) that soluble S1 (equivalent to SU) fragments form dimers, that the extreme N-terminal 330 amino acid residue region that contains the RBD participates in the dimerization, and that only dimers bind the receptor CEACAM [16] . However, we and others have previously localized the SARS-CoV RBD downstream from the extreme N-terminus [5, 7, 9] . To address the possibility for oligomerization of RBD-containing fragments and their function in mediating membrane fusion we used our previously described fragments [5] including the one from the extreme N-terminus (residues 17 through 276 denoted as S276) which does not bind the receptor ACE2 and several (S756, S537, and S272-537) which bind it as well as another one from residue 317 through 517 denoted as S317-517 that still retains receptor binding activity. These fragments were also selected because they fold independently and are secreted in the cell culture supernatant although the efficiency of their expression varied significantly (Fig. 1A , left) and their concentration was decreased when coexpressed with S756 (Fig. 1A, right) . To find whether any of these fragments oligomerizes with the largest one (S756) that includes the equivalent of the receptor-binding subunit of the envelope glycoproteins (SU in general and S1 for coronaviruses) we coexpressed them, and then immunoprecipitated the mixtures in the cell culture supernatants with the antibody P540. This rabbit polyclonal antibody was developed against a peptide containing residues 540-555 of the S glycoprotein [5] and binds S756 but not the other fragments (Fig. 1B, left) . All N-terminal fragments except the smallest fragment (S317-517) containing the RBD were co-immunoprecipitated with S756 by P540 (Fig 1B, right) . To rule out the possibility for nonspecific disulfide bond formation that may lead to co-immunoprecipitation, DTT was included in one of the co-immunoprecipitation experiments with no effect on both immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation of secreted S756 (left lanes) or S756 + S276 (right lanes) (Fig. 1C, left panel) . To find the size of the oligomers we cross-linked one of the fragments (S537) with BS 3 . The right panel of Fig.  1C shows the appearance of a new band with a molecular weight corresponding to a dimer but not of higher order oligomers. To exclude the possibilities for artifacts due to cross-linking and further confirm the formation of dimers, the S537 fragment was also analyzed by gel filtration. Two elution peaks were observed: one due to species of molecular weight of about 230 kDa and the other one-of about 110 kDa ( Fig. 2A, upper panel) corresponding presumably to a dimer and a monomer. In contrast, the smallest fragment containing the RBD (S317-517) was eluted only as a monomer at about 35 kDa molecular weight ( Fig. 2A, lower panel) . Overall, these results suggest that soluble SU is a dimer and that the dimerization domain is within the extreme N-terminal region upstream from residue 317 and the RBD.
