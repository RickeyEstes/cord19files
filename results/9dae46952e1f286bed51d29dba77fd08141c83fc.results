Pyrosequencing of the original 2004 oronasal swab resulted in 13,939 helicase sequences and 599 capsid precursor sequences. Pyrosequencing of the five-passage culture of the 2004 oronasal swab resulted in 1418 helicase sequences and 220 capsid precursor sequences. Pyrosequencing of the original 2006 oronasal swab resulted in 5132 helicase sequences and 100 capsid precursor sequences. Sequence positions are given relative to a reference SMSV genome (GenBank Accession # U15301, Neill et al., 1995) . Datasets were submitted to the SRA database at GenBank and are available under accession # SRP001023. Results of deletion analysis are given in Table 1 . Deletions in the capsid precursor region were more common than deletions in the putative helicase region. From the 2004 oronasal swab, 0.7% of the capsid precursor sequence amplification products contained significant deletions, whereas 67.7% of capsid precursor sequences from passage five of the 2004 culture had significant deletions, and 1% of the 2006 oronasal swab had significant deletions. Results of mutational analysis are given in Table 2 . In the putative helicase region, the first 231 nucleotides after the forward primer were used for mutational analysis, correlating with nucleotides 2424-2657 of the reference genome. There were eight mutations with at least 1% prevalence causing coding changes identified in the helicase region, and 17 prevalent noncoding mutations. The only helicase mutation with at least a 1.0% prevalence of minority sequence in the 2004 sample was at position 2424, a minority coding a substitution from glutamine to leucine. The minority population encoding a leucine substitution was more prevalent in the clinical sample (1.0%) than in the passaged culture (0.1%), and the 2006 clinical sample also displayed greater diversity than the culture (1.1%). The only helicase mutation with at least a 1.0% prevalence of minority sequence in the 2004 passaged culture, at position 2632, was noncoding. Of the 24 majority differences between the 2004 and 2006 clinical samples, 17 were noncoding and seven were coding. In the capsid precursor region, the first 226 nucleotides after the forward PCR primer were used for mutational analysis, correlating with nucleotides 5666-5891 of the reference genome. There were 34 mutations with at least 1.0% prevalence causing coding changes identified and 29 prevalent noncoding mutations. The most prevalent capsid precursor mutation identified in the 2004 sample, at position 5666, preceded the start codon. Eighteen of 22 (82%) prevalent capsid precursor mutations from the 2004 passaged culture caused coding changes. Of the 23 majority differences between the 2004 and 2006 samples, 20 were noncoding and three were coding. The three coding mutations were all relatively close, in the region from nucleotides 5793 to 5817. There were nine mutations with at least a 1.0% prevalence of minority sequence in either the
