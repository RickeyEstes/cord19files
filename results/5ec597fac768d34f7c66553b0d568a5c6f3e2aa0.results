There was no substantial difference in the under5 LRI mortality rate between boys (118·2 deaths, 108·2-129·6, per 100 000 boys) and girls (119·5 deaths, 109·6-129·6, per 100 000 girls; data are available on GBDCompare). Since 1990, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths (65·4% decrease, 61·5-68·5; from 2 337 538 deaths to 808 920 deaths), the mortality rate (67·2% decrease, 63·6-70·2; from 362·7 deaths, 330·1-392·0, per 100 000 children to 118·9 deaths, 109·8-128·3, per 100 000 children; table), and the percent of under5 deaths that were due to LRIs (24·6% decrease, 17·2-30·4; from 19·9%, 18·1-21·4, to 15·0%, 14·0-16·0) among children younger than 5 years.
