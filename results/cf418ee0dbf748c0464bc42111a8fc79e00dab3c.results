Additional file 2: Table S1 presents the baseline characteristics of the two birth cohorts, including 7334 octogenarians, 7705 nonagenarians, and 5481 centenarians who were interviewed in 1998 or 2008. Across the three paired age groups, the later cohort had lower prevalence rates of disability than the earlier cohort. For example, 11.8% of octogenarians born 1919-1928 were disabled in 2008, while 17.3% of their age mates were disabled in 1998. We observed 4792 deaths in the earlier cohorts (1141 octogenarians, 1809 nonagenarians, and 1842 centenarians) during 4 years of follow-up and 7123 deaths in the later cohorts (1852 octogenarians, 3074 nonagenarians, and 2197 centenarians) over 6 years follow-up. Table 1 and Fig. 1 present the results by comparing partial total, disability-free, and disabled LE in ages 80-89, 90-99, and 100-105 between successive 10-year birth cohorts, overall and by sex. More recently born octogenarians (born 1919-1928) had a longer partial LE between ages 80 and 89 than octogenarians born 1909-1918, with overall partial LE increasing by 0.20 years (P = 0.044). Most of this gain occurred among women, who experienced an increase in partial LE of 0.32 years (P = 0.012) across the two birth cohorts. This increase in LE was entirely comprised of a 0.32-year rise in partial DFLE (P = 0.004). In Fig. 1 , we observed that, though partial LE in ages 80-89 increased between these two birth cohorts, there was little evidence of a compression of morbidity-that is, the proportion of life spent disability-free in these ages was little changed. Although no increases in partial LE were observed among nonagenarians or centenarians, partial DFLE increased in these persons across successive 10-year birth cohorts, with a gain of 0.41 years (P < 0.001) among nonagenarians and 0.07 years (P = 0.050) among centenarians. As shown in Fig. 1 , there was strong evidence that a compression of morbidity happened over successive cohorts among nonagenarians and centenarians-more recently born cohorts are living substantially more of these years disability-free. Women appeared to be experiencing a more rapid compression of disability across cohorts than men-partial DFLE rose by 0.58 years (P < 0.001) among nonagenarian women and by 0.09 years (P = 0.016) among centenarian women, compared with smaller gains of 0.18 disability-free years (P = 0.054) for nonagenarian men and negligible change for centenarian men. Partial LE estimates and the proportion of life spent disability-free and disabled by urban/rural residence and education are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 , respectively, with detailed results in Additional file 3: Table S2 , Additional file 4: Table S3 , Additional file 5: Table S4 , Additional file 6: Table S5 , Additional file 7: Table S6 , and Additional file 8: Table S7 . Urban residents aged 80-89 lived 0.39 years longer (P < 0.001) in the later cohort compared to the earlier cohort, with the majority of these additional life-years spent disability-free (0.25 years, P = 0.030). In contrast, rural 80-89-year-old individuals saw a much smaller increase in partial LE (0.10 years, P = 0.392) and DFLE (0.10 years, P = 0.428). Though partial LE increased faster for urban residents, the proportions of remaining life spent disability-free and disabled were little changed between the two cohorts. No urban/rural differences in partial LE were seen between birth cohorts in the 90-99 or 100-105 age ranges. Both urban and rural residents in ages 90-99 experienced gains in partial DFLE across successive birth cohorts, though this gain was larger among urban residents (0.54 years, P < 0.001) than in rural residents (0.33 years, P < 0.001). As seen in Fig. 2 , the urban population gained proportionately more years of disability-free life in ages 90-99, with the proportion of life-years lived disability-free rising from 55 to 70% across successive cohorts. In contrast, partial DFLE increased by 0.12 years (P < 0.001) among rural 100-105-year-old individuals between the earlier and later cohorts, compared to 0.02 years (P = 0.602) among urban residents. An urban/rural disparity in partial LE was evident in octogenarians and nonagenarians, where partial LE for rural residents in the later cohort trailed behind total LE for urban residents born 10 years prior. Partial LE and DFLE gains across cohorts in ages 80-89 were largest in the population with no formal schooling (Fig. 3 )-partial LE increased by 0.31 years (P = 0.006) between the two birth cohorts for those without formal schooling. Though gains in partial LE were stronger among those with no education in ages 80-89, LE in this group still trailed behind those who received some formal schooling, particularly among men. Figure 3 suggests that there was little compression of disability happening in either schooling group in ages 80-89. Partial LE was little changed across cohorts in ages 90-99 and 100-105. Those with no formal schooling saw a larger rise in partial DFLE of 0.47 years (P < 0.001) in ages 90-99 (compared to 0.27 years [P = 0.008] for those with some formal schooling) and 0.09 years (P = 0.028) in ages 100-105 (compared to no change for those with some formal schooling). For both those with and without schooling, evidence for the compression of disability was stronger in women than in men across successive cohorts.
