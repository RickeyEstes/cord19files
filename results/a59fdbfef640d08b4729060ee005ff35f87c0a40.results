A total of 223 participants were recruited from four hospitals and followed for 4 weeks. Most participants were female (84.3%), with a graduate degree (71.3%) and were not vaccinated for influenza (78.5%) during the study season (Table 1 ). The mean age of participants was 36.7 years (SD Â±9.7 and range 20-65 years) and around half of them were doctors. Thirteen percent (29/223) of participants had at least one pre-existing medical condition and 64% (143/223) had performed high risk procedures during the study period. Bacteria were isolated from 170 (76.2%) participants at baseline and 127 (57%) participants at the end of the study (Table 2 ). If co-infections were excluded, bacteria were isolated from 57% participants (128/223) at baseline and 44% (98/223) at end of the study. Overall 196 (88%) participants had bacterial colonisation at start or end of the study -148 participants (66%) had only bacterial colonisation while 48 (22%) participants had co-infection with a virus (Fig. 1a) . Among the total participants, 101 (45.5%) were positive for bacteria at both baseline and end of the study, 68 (30.6%) were positive at baseline and negative at the end, 26 (11.7%) were negative at baseline and positive at the end and 27 (12.2%) were negative at both periods (Fig. 1b) . Among all bacterial positive cases, Streptococcus pneumoniae (isolated or co-infected with Haemophilus influenza) was the most commonly isolated organism at baseline (96%, 163/170) and end of the study (72%, 91/127). Sixty-seven cases were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae at both baseline and end of the study -18 from respiratory ward (18%, 18/99), 18 from paediatric ward (38%, 18/47), 9 from fever clinics (29%, 9/31) and 22 from emergency ward (48%, 22/46). There were 35 (15.7%) laboratory confirmed viral infections found at baseline and 20 (9.0%) found at the end of the study (Table 2) . Rhinovirus/enterovirus was the most common viral pathogen accounting for 24 (10.8%) and 10 (4.5%) infections at baseline and the end respectively. Other viruses detected included Adenovirus, Coronavirus, H1N1 and H3N2 influenza virus and human metapneumovirus. Rates of bacterial/viral coinfections were 13% (29/223) at baseline and 4.9% (11/ 223) at the end of the study. Twelve participants (4.5%) developed clinical respiratory illness (CRI) during the 4 week study period and all of these 12 HCWs had positive bacteria isolation at baseline (n = 11, including 4 co-infection with a virus) or end of the study (n = 1). Among asymptomatic participants, 187 (87%) had bacterial colonisation or co-infection at baseline or end of the study. Viruses were also isolated from 5 (2.4%) of asymptomatic cases ( Table 3) . Rates of bacterial colonisation were compared among symptomatic and non-symptomatic participants in the Table 4 . In all three outcomes, rates of bacterial colonisation were higher in symptomatic participants, compared to non-symptomatic, although differences were not statistically significant. In univariate analysis, rates of bacterial colonisation were higher (OR 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.75) in females (90.4%, 170/188) compared to males (74.3%, 26/35) however this was not statistically significant (Table 5) . No other variable was associated with bacterial colonisation.
