Assessing proper refolding of recombinant CD147 and probing CD147 oligomerization Intracellularly expressed CD147 constructs in bacteria are initially unfolded due to improper disulfide formation but can be refolded in vitro to yield milligram quantities of highly soluble and biologically active proteins. The extracellular region of the dominant CD147 isoform (isoform 2, which is CD147 ) contains two Ig-like domains, herein called Ig1 (residues 22-103) and Ig2 (residues 105-205), and each contains two cysteine residues that form a single disulfide bond within each domain. The extracellular region of a less widely found CD147 isoform comprises only the Ig2 domain (isoform 3, which is CD147 94-269 ). The presence of these disulfide bonds was recently confirmed by the X-ray crystal structure of the CD147 extracellular region purified from a bacterial periplasmic expression system that relies on spontaneous folding within this oxidizing environment. 34 However, here we have discovered that both of these isoforms can be readily refolded in their entirety after intracellular bacterial expression to produce soluble proteins (both with and without the signal peptide sequence of residues 1-21, although these residues lead to soluble oligomers). While we can produce many soluble constructs of CD147 that represent different regions of the receptor via our in vitro refolding method (see Materials and Methods), CD147 constructs containing residues 215-229, which correspond to the hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) region, form large aggregates as assessed by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig.  2a, CD147 ). Removal of residues 205-229 that comprise both the membrane-proximal and TM region completely abrogates aggregation (Fig. 2a , CD147 22-269Δ ™). Refolded CD147 constructs comprising the extracellular Ig-like domains were all found to elute as a single monomeric species on size exclusion and were therefore further analyzed by both SDS-PAGE denaturing gels and native gel analysis below. Three CD147 constructs representing either the individual Ig-like domains alone, CD147 22-103 (Ig1) and CD147 94-205 (Ig2), as well as both domains, CD147 (Ig1 and Ig2) , were used to probe both proper disulfide formation and the oligomeric properties of CD147. The single disulfide bond within each extracellular CD147 domain was correctly formed by our refolding procedure as confirmed by SDS-PAGE denaturing gels where the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) reduced each disulfide bond and led to a slower migrating species for all constructs (Fig. 2b) . Furthermore, all extracellular CD147 constructs migrate as a single species on a native gel (Fig. 2c ) and, together with the aforementioned size-exclusion data, suggest that with proper disulfide formation, each Ig-like domain neither self-associates nor interacts with the other Ig-like domain. A final confirmation of proper refolding is shown in the biological activity of our recombinant CD147 (Fig. S1 ). Specifically, our refolded recombinant CD147 stimulates the release of two wellcharacterized pro-inflammatory cytokines in cell culture, TNF-α and IL-1β, providing the first evidence that glycosylation of CD147 is not required for cytokine stimulation as has recently been shown for MMP stimulation. 14 However, caution must be taken in assessing the activity of unglycosylated CD147 since the explicit role of CD147 glycosylation is still poorly understood. For example, the unglycosylated form of CD147 has been found to act as an antagonist of MMP induction in some contexts 38 and there is growing evidence that supports the notion that the degree of CD147 glycosylation in vivo regulates its activity. 39, 40 Moreover, "differentially glycosylated" does not necessarily imply that CD147 is unglycosylated in vivo and, in fact, there is no evidence to suggest that the soluble CD147 forms released from cells are not glycosylated. Thus, future studies aimed at producing glycosylated CD147 from, for example, mammalian expression systems will allow for a rigorous comparative analysis to our unglycosylated forms probed here. Considering that several recent reports have identified trace amounts of CD147 dimerization using one of the exact same constructs that we have begun characterizing here, namely, CD147 , it is important to rationalize why we do not observe such a phenomena. 14, 34 The most likely explanation for these observed differences is intermolecular disulfide bond formation. Specifically, the previous purification schemes of recombinant CD147 relied on spontaneous refolding in the oxidizing environment of the Escherichia coli periplasm and this likely leads to a small population of incorrectly folded protein, which would be susceptible to intermolecular disulfide formation. In contrast, our in vitro refolding procedure may simply be more efficient since we do not observe such dimers on SDS-PAGE or native gel analysis. However, such cross-linked dimers can still be observed within our protein preparations using Western blot analysis, indicating that even our purification procedure produces trace amounts of this cross-linked dimer, albeit at far lower relative concentrations to the monomeric species (Fig. S2 ). While we suspect that these dimers are simply a by-product of purification rather than a biologically relevant protein, it would be naïve to completely rule out a potential role of disulfide shuffling for CD147 homophilic interactions. However, receptor interactions that rely on disulfide shuffling require other protein interactions such as protein disulfide isomerase 41 and such interactions have not been identified for CD147. Regardless of such hypothetical interactions, our data indicate that the extracellular region of the intact fully folded monomeric extracellular domains of CD147 do not self-associate in the absence of another mediator.
