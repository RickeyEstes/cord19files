We recruited 68 participants over 26 weeks between October 2014 and March 2015 (2.6 participants/week: Fig. 1 ). We excluded two (n = 66) [one declined after randomisation, and the other was on antibiotics] and randomised 32 to the intervention arm and 34 to the control arm (Fig. 2) . The majority (76%) were women. Most (76%) preferred paper forms over online feedback. Most (Intervention: 94%, Control: 91%) returned the daily forms, end-of-study form (Intervention: 88%, Control: 85%) and swabs (Intervention: 88%, Control: 91%). Of the sixty-six participants, five did not return daily forms. Of the sixty-one, four did not return end-of-study forms. Of the fifty-seven, three did not return samples. All forms and samples were hence available in fifty-four individuals. 80% in the intervention arm used 3% HS, while 9% each used 2.5%, 2% HS. All but one used Cornish sea salt. One participant left without the sea salt and used another brand available at home. An individual in the control arm reported performing nasal irrigation but provided no further information. The baseline characteristics, symptom severity and degree of interference with daily life were similar in both arms (Table 1) . We identified an aetiology in the baseline sample of 73% (48/66) of participants (Table S1 ). Amongst these, 56% were rhinovirus and 31% were coronaviruses (COV), with the rest due to enterovirus, influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV-3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV). We detected dual infections of rhinovirus with an enterovirus/COV HKU1 in two. Most participants completed the "WURSS-21-Scot" daily until they were well (i.e. a score of 0) on two days (please see Fig. S1 for daily forms). Intervention and control arms completed the symptom diary for a mean (SD) of 6.8 (2.2) and 8.7 (3.3) days respectively. The intervention arm hence had a reduction in duration of illness by 1.9 days (95% CI = 0.4 to 3.3) (p = 0.01) (Fig. 3) . The duration of illness was significantly lower (p = 0.01) even if the first day participants felt well was the end-point [Mean (SD) Intervention: 6.0 (2.4); Control: 8.0 (3.4) days]. Participants performed HSNIG for a median of 5 days (IQR: 3 to 6) and at a median of thrice a day (IQR: 2 to 3) (Fig. 3 ). There was a significant reduction in the duration of runny nose (1.8 days, 95% CI:0.4 to 3.2, p = 0.01), blocked nose (2.7 days, 95% CI:1.2 to 4.1, p < 0.001), sneezing (1.5 days, 95% CI:0.3 to 2.9, p = 0.02), cough (2.4 days, 95% CI:0.9 to 4.0, p = 0.003), hoarseness of voice (1.7 days, 95% CI:0.2 to 3.1, p = 0.02) ( Fig. 3 ; Supplementary  Table S2) . We could calculate the average WURSS-21 score and EQ-VAS scores from the diaries (please also see supplementary results). The median (IQR) average WURSS 21 score in the intervention group was 13.2 (7. Table S3 ). Excluding those with no virus detected in the baseline sample [Intervention: 5 (16%); Control: 12 (35%)], samples on days 1-4 to estimate viral shedding was available in 25 and 20 individuals in intervention and control arms respectively (Fig. 4) . In four individuals [a COV and a rhinovirus each per arm], no virus was detectable on days 1-4. Details of symptom severity, viral shedding and HSNIG are in Fig. 4 . The median (IQR) reduction in viral shedding between baseline and end-point sample in the intervention arm was −2.23 log 10 (−3.04 to −0.32) [n = 26] and −1.51 log 10 (−3.30 to −0.55) [n = 21] in the control arm (p = 0.9). (see supplementary results). We then estimated the proportion of individuals with viral shedding by ≥0.5 log 10 /day between arms (see supplementary results). Four individuals in the intervention arm had paramyxovirus infection but none in the control arm. As paramyxoviruses have a longer life cycle 16, 17 , incubation period 18 , duration of viral shedding 19 and illness 19, 20 compared to rhinovirus [21] [22] [23] [24] , the data was analysed after removing these individuals. A higher proportion in the intervention arm had a fall ≥0.5 log 10 /day compared to controls [Intervention 73% [n = 16/22], Control 43% [n = 9/21], difference −30%, 95% CI for difference in proportion (−58 to −2) p = 0.04]. End-of-study forms were available from fifty-seven individuals ( Table 2) . Over-the-counter medications use (OTCM) use was 36% lower in the intervention arm (95% CI 14 to 59) (p = 0.004). Amongst participants who were not living alone, 35% fewer individuals in the intervention arm (95% CI 10 to 60) had household contacts developing URTI after them (p = 0.006). We received feedback on HSNIG from 28/32 participants (Table S4 ). 93% said that HSNIG made a difference to their symptoms. They found HS easy to prepare (100%). Most preferred to prepare solution in bulk in a flask (86%) and preferred using a small bowl to perform HSNIG (75%). Most considered the procedure either comfortable or moderately comfortable (89%) and the majority (86%) were happy to perform the procedure outside home. The most commonly reported effects were that it helped clear the nose/reduced stuffiness (n = 16), made it easier to breathe (n = 7), speeded up resolution of symptoms (n = 5), reduced the severity of the illness (n = 3) and improved sleep (n = 2). 60% of participants were likely to use HSNIG in the future and 25% of participants were undecided if they would use HSNIG in the future. The figure increased to 86% if the procedure could be made more convenient. Most (71%) however said they were unlikely to use HSNIG as a prophylactic measure.
