Twenty-four out of the 40 calves, 12 males and 12 females met the inclusion criteria, and were thus included in this study. The average weight at birth was 41 kg (minimum value of 34.5 kg and maximum value of 44 kg) and 37.5 kg (minimum value of 35 kg and maximum value of 48.5 kg) for groups C and T, respectively. The mean age at T0 was 7.9 ± 4.8 days for group C, and 7.2 ± 2.9 days for group T. The mean T0-FS were 1.6 ± 0.5 and 2.0 ± 0.7 for groups C and T, respectively. No significant differences were found in terms of the weight at birth, the age of diarrhea onset, and the T0-FS between the two groups (P > 0.05). There were no alterations at the physical examination, and the hydration status was normal for all calves during the entire study period. No differences between groups were found for milk intake. Thus, no pharmacological treatments or fluid therapy were needed. Seven out of twelve (7/12) calves belonging to group C resulted positive for Cryptosporidium parvum, 2/12 for Rotavirus and Coronavirus, and 3/12 negative. Nine/12 calves belonging to group T were positive to Cryptosporidium parvum, 2/12 for Rotavirus and Coronavirus, and 1/12 were negative to the rapid ELISA test performed. Fecal flotation did not show intestinal parasites. The average weight at the third week of life was 53 kg (minimum value of 42 kg and maximum value of 64 kg) and 46.7 kg (minimum value of 46 kg and maximum value of 52.5 kg) for groups C and T, respectively. The average daily gain was 0.643 kg/day (minimum value of 0.143 kg/day and maximum value of 1.024 kg/day), and 0.442 kg/day (minimum value of 0.190 kg/day and maximum value of 0.524 kg/day), for groups C and T, respectively. Differences between the two groups were not significant. The mean DDE in days was 10.3 ± 3.5 for group C, and 6.4 ± 3.9 for group T ( Table 1) . A significant difference between the two groups was found (P = 0.01). The mean fecal score recorded throughout the DDE for group C was 1.6 ± 0.5, while for group T the score was 1.4 ± 0.8, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.03). No statistically significant differences were found between male and female calves for the DDE and fecal score recorded throughout the DDE. No calves refused the tannins solution.
