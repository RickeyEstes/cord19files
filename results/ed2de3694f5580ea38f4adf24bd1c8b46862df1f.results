MBL assays were performed at baseline in 1037 (91%) of the 1142 subjects enrolled in the azithromycin trial. Of these, 909 had experienced one or more AECOPDs in the year prior to enrollment. Duplicate measurements of MBL had coefficients of variations ,15% in all cases and ,5% in most. The median MBL concentration for all patients was 918 ng/mL (interquartile range 508-1683 ng/mL, inclusive range 0-8194 ng/mL). The median MBL concentration in subjects randomized to receive azithromycin or placebo was 1008 ng/mL (95% confidence interval [CI] 909-1082) and 850 ng/mL (95% CI 776-929), respectively (P = 0.017). Patient demographics and clinical characteristics, stratified by MBL concentration, are summarized in Table 1 . The prevalence of MBL deficiency was 0.5%, 1.9%, 24.2%, or 52.3%, when deficiency was defined as #50, #100, #500, or .50 and #1000 ng/mL, respectively (Table 1) . Regardless of the concentration of MBL used to define MBL deficiency, no difference was observed with respect to the prevalence of MBL deficiency by gender, race, or age (with the exception that a greater fraction of women had MBL deficiency defined as .50 ng/mL and #1000 ng/mL than was seen with the other definitions), smoking status, chronic bronchitis, or steroid use, and there was no suggestion that airflow limitation was worse or that GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) stage was higher in subjects with MBL deficiency ( Table 1 ). The same findings were also observed for the subgroups of subjects receiving azithromycin or placebo (data not shown). When analyzing time-to-first AECOPD using a model that included treatment group (ie, azithromycin versus placebo) and log-transformed MBL concentration stratified by clinic, treatment group was significant (P , 0.0001) and log-transformed MBL concentration was not (P = 0.629). The hazard ratio for a one-unit increase in log-transformed MBL concentration was 1.02 (95% CI 0.94-1.12). For the rate per person-year of AECOPDs, a negative-binomial analysis of a model that included treatment group and log-transformed MBL concentration found that treatment group was significant (P = 0.010) but log-transformed MBL concentration was not (P = 0.470). The coefficient for log-transformed MBL concentration in this model was 0.031 (95% CI, âˆ’0.053 to +0.115). The median time to first AECOPD and the rate of AECOPD per patient-year are shown in Figures 1-3 Table 2 relative to the various definitions of MBL deficiency (only five patients had MBL concentrations # 50 ng/mL, precluding life table analyses for patients in this subgroup). Regardless of the MBL concentration used to define deficiency, no association between the time to first AECOPD, or the rate of AECOPDs and MBL concentration was observed in the population as a whole, or in either treatment subgroup. Nonsignificant trends favoring a longer time to first AECOPD were seen in the subgroup of subjects with MBL concentrations , 100 ng/ mL compared with those with concentrations $ 100 ng/mL ( Figure 1A and C). No difference was observed in MBL concentrations in subjects experiencing no, one, two, or at least three AECOPDs during the course of the study in the population as a whole, or in either treatment group (Table 3) .
