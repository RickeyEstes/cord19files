Overall, 2,529 camels were tested, 38 of them being calves < 2 years, 1,400 aged 2-4 years and 1,091 aged > 4 years. None of the 1,300 camels tested from 12 October A total of 311 abattoir workers were recruited for the serological study. Of these, 261 had occupational exposure to camels, with 243 workers having direct exposure to live camels, freshly killed camels or camel meat, and 18 having indirect exposure to camels. Fifty persons recruited in the study worked in the slaughterhouse with no occupational camel exposure. Many workers in the abattoir, including those without direct occupational exposure to camels, reported drinking fresh (unboiled) camel milk, drinking camel urine and the use of camel urine for medicinal purposes (Table) . Irrespective of these modes of exposure, none of the 311 humans tested had any evidence of MERS-CoV antibody in their serum.
