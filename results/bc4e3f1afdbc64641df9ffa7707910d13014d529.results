To identify the 54 kD CPMV-BP, a proteomics study was performed using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The 54 kD protein is found in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction of cells, lacks N-and Oglycosylation, and was identified by its ability to bind directly to CPMV particles using a Virus Overlay Protein Blot Assay (VOPBA) [21] . The VOPBA technique has identified many high-affinity virus receptors including those for coronaviruses [22, 23] , adenoviruses [24] , and arenaviruses [25] . Mass spectrometry analysis focused first on enriched plasma membrane proteins that co-migrated with the 54 kD band on SDS-PAGE; this resulted in identification of 68 individual proteins (Table 1) . Surface biotinylation of cells, followed by isolation of enriched plasma membranes and streptavidin-sepharose purification of biotinylated proteins, separation on SDS-PAGE and VOPBA, yielded a sample in the 54 kD range that was also analyzed by LC-MS/MS and yielded 7 proteins ( Table 1 ). The third approach used the enriched plasma membrane fraction as starting material ( Figure 1A ) followed by sequential column chromatography ( Figure 1B ). Here the membrane fraction was first run over a concanavalin A-sepharose column to remove glycoproteins, and the flow-through fraction was bound to an affinity matrix that was generated when surface lysine residues on purified CPMV particles were directly conjugated to N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester-sepharose (CPMV-sepharose). The CPMV-bound sample was washed several times, and then CPMV-sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and bound proteins separated on SDS-PAGE ( Figure 1C ). Three bands were easily visible by SimplyBlue (Invitrogen) staining, corresponding to the 54 kD CPMV-BP, the 42 kD large capsid subunit of CPMV, and the 24 kD small CPMV capsid subunit. The 54 kD band was excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS using nano-electrospray on a linear ion trap mass spectrometer ( Figure 1D ). In this analysis two proteins were positively identified: vimentin and keratin. Keratin is a common laboratory contaminant that is isobaric with vimentin. Vimentin was also identified in all the preceding mass spectrometry analyses (Table 1) . A complete listing of all proteins identified in each screen can be seen in Table S1 . Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament and a major component of the cytoskeleton. Expressed in cells of mesenchymal origin, vimentin plays a key role in intracellular dynamics and architecture [26] . Vimentin encodes head, rod, and tail domains, and these domains are identified based on sequence and function [26] . Although it has long been considered a cytosolic protein, surface-expressed forms of vimentin have recently been discovered
