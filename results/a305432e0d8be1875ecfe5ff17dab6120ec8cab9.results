cDNA cloning and sequencing of two clones from the 3' end of the genome. Starting material for cDNA cloning was approximately 6 pg of rate-zonally purified genomic RNA obtained from 400 ml of tissue culture medium. An estimated 200 ng of cls cDNA was obtained, as determined by radiolabel incorporation during second strand synthesis, and from this approximately 2000 white colonies were obtained. By colony screening 200 colonies gave a strong signal to 32P-labelecl cDNA prepared from genomic RNA, and of these, 13 had inserts of 200 to 2000 bases as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis of supercoiled plasmids, and were further analyzed by restriction enzyme analysis and poly (A) content. The largest clone of 2000 bases, FG5, did not react by Southern blotting to 32P-labeled oligo(dT), but did cross-hybridize in Southern blot analysis with several other smaller clones that did react strongly with oligo(dT). One of these, 521, a clone of 700 bases, was sequenced in part to determine the primary structure of the extreme 3' end of the genome. The orientation of clones FG5 and 521 in reference to the virus genome and the restriction enzyme sites used for sequencing are illustrated in Fig. 1 . Our orientation presumes polyadenylation at only the 3' end of the genome and this, in turn, is based on the precedent of the documented 3' polyadenylation site in the avian infectious bronchitis virus and mouse hepatitis virus genomes (Lai et al., 1981; Stern and Kennedy, 1980) . The strategy used for sequencing is described in the legend to Fig. 1 . Over 96% of the sequence containing the two complete genes we report was determined either by sequencing both strands or by repeated sequencing of the same strand using different methods of end labeling. Some of the sequences were derived from subclones of FG5 made from the PstI restriction sites. The total sequence of FG5 is illustrated in Fig. 2 . Sequences from 521 that overlap with FG5 are identical to those of FG5 except that the total length of the polyadenylate tail is 15 bases for the 521 clone, and 6 for the FG5 clone. The entire nucleotide sequence was translated in all possible reading frames , 1975; Moreau and Brian, unpublished) . The protein has two properties that are strikingly similar to the nucleocapsid proteins of MHV and IBV (Armstrong et al, 1983; Boursnell et al, 1985; Skinner and Siddell, 1983) . First, it is rich in serine. Thirty-nine (lO%)of the residues are serine making it the most abundant amino acid. Assuming this protein is phosphorylated at serine residues, as is the MHV A59 protein (Stohlman and Lai, 1979) TagI, P&I, and &I sites, derived by restriction endonuclease mapping, and the Hind111 and SalI sites in the multiple cloning region of the pUC9 vector, were the sites used for initial DNA sequencing. Internal AccI, KpnI, and MeI sites were identified from sequence data and were used to complete the sequencing. n Indicates sites labeled at the Send using polynucleotide kinase. 0 Indicates sites labeled at the 3' end using reverse transcriptase and the appropriately labeled deoxynucleotide triphosphate. + Indicates site labeled at the 3' end using dideoxy A and terminal transferase. level of phosphorylation might explain the only 46 (lZ%)are acidic, giving the protein 3-to 6-kd difference between the predicted a net charge of +23 at neutral pH. and measured molecular weights. Second, Although the consensus sequence around the protein is basic, a property expected of the AUG initiator codon for the TGEV nunucleic acid-binding proteins. Sixty-nine cleocapsid protein (UAAAUGG) is not (18%)of the amino acids are basic whereas among the most favored for translation initiation sites that have been described, it is not without precedent (Kozak, 1983) . This AUG, therefore, probably identifies the authentic beginning of the TGEV nucleocapsid gene since the sequence from this point leftward to the end of clone FG5, except for a 12-base intergenic sequence, reveals an open reading frame coding for a protein sharing extensive regions of amino acid homology with the small matrix glycoprotein (M or El) of the mouse hepatitis virus A59 (Armstrong et al., 1984; discussed below) . A second open reading frame to the 3' side of the nucleocapsid protein gene encodes a hypothetical protein of 9101 mol wt that is hydrophobic at both ends. An open reading frame beginning at base 1507 and extending through base 1740 encodes a hypothetical 78 amino acid protein of 9101 mol wt (Fig. 2) . A hydrophobicity analysis of the protein reveals that it is hydrophobic for a stretch of approximately 25 amino acids at each end and it is hydrophilic in its central region. There are eight basic amino acids and four acidic amino acids giving the protein a net +4 charge at neutral pH. Basic and acidic amino acids are distributed evenly throughout the central hydrophilic region, but 4 basic amino acids and no acidic ones are found among the 27 amino acids at the carboxy terminus. There is yet no direct evidence for this protein. DISCUSSION We present the primary nucleotide sequence for the TGEV nucleocapsid protein (N) gene and the deduced amino acid sequence for the protein. This is the first primary sequence data for a coronavirus in the antigenic subgroup to which TGEV belongs, and such information allows one to first, firmly conclude that TGEV shares an ancestral relationship with MHV and IBV, and second, to identify potentially functional domains on the N protein by examining conserved structures among the diverged viruses. The first two coronavirus N gene sequences to be described are those of the closely related JHM and A59 strains of MHV (Armstrong et al, 1983; Skinner and Siddell, 1983) and between these an overall homology of 94% was found for both the nucleotide and amino acid sequences, reflecting the antigenic similarities between the viruses. Interestingly, the antigenically distinct avian infectious bronchitis virus shows no N gene nucleotide sequence homology with MHV, yet shares an overall amino acid sequence homology of 26% (Boursnell et al., 1985) . Furthermore, there is a stretch of 67 amino acids within of serines. (ii) Three cluster groups of 5the amino terminal one-third of the protein 29 basic amino acid residues are found in that shows a sequence homology of 51% parallel with TGEV amino acid positions between the viruses (Boursnell et aL, 1985) O-30, 150-260, and 330-350. (iii) A cluster suggesting that a strong selective pressure of 9-11 acidic amino acid residues is found exists for a specific functional group defined within the last 32 amino acids at the carby this sequence. This interesting pattern boxy terminus. repeats itself in the structure of the TGEV Although TGEV would appear to be N protein. Although TGEV shows no an-equally diverged from IBV and MHV on tigenic relatedness to either MHV or IBV the basis of amino acid sequence, TGEV (Pedersen et aZ., 1978) , and no N gene nu-more closely resembles MHV in its genome cleotide homology with either MHV or IBV, arrangement. Firstly, like MHV, the N it does show an overall amino acid homol-gene for TGEV is flanked on its 5' side by ogy of 27 and 26% with MHV (JHM) and the matrix protein (M or El) gene, whereas IBV, respectively. Furthermore, the con-for IBV, two genes, derived from overlapserved 67 amino acid region is also found ping reading frames and encoding hypoin TGEV (becoming 68 positions when thetical proteins of unknown function, lie TGEV is compared; Fig. 4 ). This conserved between the M and N genes (Armstrong et region is slightly more basic than the over-al, 1984; Boursnell and Brown, 1984) . Our all nucleocapsid protein and therefore may conclusion that the M gene for TGEV lies function as a site of interaction with ge-to the immediate 5'side of the nucleocapsid nomic RNA. gene is based on amino acid sequence ho-Other regions in the N proteins of the mology with the M protein of MHV A59. three viruses share structural similarities Of the 105 amino acids deduced for the in the absence of a common primary struc-TGEV matrix protein sequence, 31% are ture suggesting the existence of additional perfectly homologous and another 15% are conserved functional domains. Although conservative differences ( Fig. 2 and data the N proteins are different lengths (382 not shown). Secondly, the number of nuamino acids for TGEV, 455 for MHV, and cleotides separating the M (El) and N 409 for IBV), when the three are aligned genes is close, 14 for MHV and 12 for by the 68-amino acid conserved sequence, TGEV, and these match perfectly for a the following structural similarities are stretch of 8 bases: observed. (i) Four cluster groups containing 2-10 serine residues are found in parallel with TGEV amino acid positions 20- MHVA59 TCTAAACTTTAAGG 40, Skinner et uZ., 1985) , but their starts at amino acid 53 from the initiator codon for hydrophobicity is only at one end, they map IBV (Boursnell et al, 1985) , amino acid 86 for MHV at an entirely different region in the ge-JHM (Skinner and Siddell, 1983) (Dennis and Brian, 1982) . Assuming TGEV replicates by the consensus scheme proposed for the replication of MHV and IBV, namely that all messages have a 3'coterminal nested set arrangement (as suggested by preliminary experiments with TGEV [Hu et ah, 1984] ), then one of the small messages described by Dennis and Brian may be the message for the hydrophobic protein. From the known sequence ( Fig. 2) , such a message would be 0.20 Md. Two structural features favor the plausability of this being a functional hydrophobic protein gene. (i) The intergenic sequence preceding the gene, inclusive of the N gene stop codon, contains a 6-base sequence, CTAAAC, that is in common with part of the intergenic sequence preceding the N gene for both MHV and TGEV described above, and may play a role in the initiation of mRNA transcription (Budzilowicz et ah, 1985) . (ii) The 7-base sequence, GAGAUGC, at the initiation site of the hydrophobic protein is a favored pattern among eukaryotic initiation sequences (Kozak, 1983) . Assuming that the gene for the hydrophobic protein is real then the 3' terminal noncoding sequence would be a total of 276 bases, exclusive of the poly (A) tail, and would be the shortest noncoding sequence of those identified for coronaviruses. The significance of the noncoding region is not completely known although it undoubtedly functions as an attachment region for the polymerase to initiate synthesis of the negative strand RNA. One possible site that may be critical for recognition or binding is a lo-base sequence, GGGAA-GAGCT, that is conserved between IBV (found 81 bases from the 3' end) and MHV (82 bases from the end). With the exception of the first base, a T instead of G, TGEV shares an identical sequence beginning 77 bases from the 3' end (Fig. 2) .
