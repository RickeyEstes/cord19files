We first applied metaMix on a popular benchmark dataset, for which the community composition and the read assignment is known. We then analyzed RNA-Seq datasets from two clinical samples that were generated for diagnostic purposes. We compare our results with the ones produced by MEGAN version 5.3 and for PT chain at temperature T ¼ 1. c. Schematic of parallel tempering. Exchanges are attempted between chains of neighboring temperatures, where Chain1 at T1 ¼ 1; T1 < T2 < T3 < T4 Pathoscope 2.0. Both methods are similarity based. This property and more specifically their flexibility to work with BLASTx output, makes them better candidates for viral discovery compared with composition-based methods. From the mixture model methods, we have chosen Pathoscope. We were also interested in comparing our results to the ones by GRAMMy, which was the first similaritybased method to use the idea of the mixture model. However, GRAMMy is designed for nucleotide-nucleotide comparisons (BLASTn), which is suboptimal for viral discovery. GRAMMy also only considers unassembled reads and requires that these are of the same fixed length. For these reasons, GRAMMy was not included in the comparison. Default parameters were used for all methods, unless stated otherwise. For the metaMix output, we reported organisms with a posterior probability P > 0.8 (default). The metaMix read support parameter r, which essentially sets the sensitivity/specificity of the method, has an impact on the number of reported species. A large r value can result in the method merging together strains that are differentiated by fewer reads than r. On the other hand a low r can have the opposite effect, whereby the methods splits a strain into two or more strains, by moving a few reads from one strain to a very similar one with which they have equally good matches. The user's choice for this key parameter r should be informed by the biological context. As an example, for the typical human clinical sample where the sample collection might have occurred some time after the infection has taken place, a low value in order to adopt a sensitive approach is reasonable. Hence, for viral identification in human clinical samples, a low and sensitive value (r ¼ 10) is a reasonable choice. In a highly complex environmental metagenomic community where there is a plethora of species of similar abundances, the choice becomes less straightforward especially in the case of closely related strains. We set the default value for general community profiling in environmental samples at r ¼ 30. We also compare the output of metaMix for different values of this parameter as well as for different posterior probability cutoffs. Supplementary Methods presents a discussion on the metaMix settings as well as practical considerations.
