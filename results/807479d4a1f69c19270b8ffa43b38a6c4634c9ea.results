Faecal specimens from 628 neonates were processed and examined for viruses. Rotaviruses were found in 304 (49%) (table i). The four groups of neonates (normal babies tested during surveys, normal babies tested during outbreaks of diarrhoea in the nurseries, those with diarrhoea, and those with mild gastrointestinal symptoms) gave excretion rates of 44%, 46%, 61%, and 45% respectively. Of the 6 nurseries 5 showed evidence of infection. In the sixth nursery no rota viruses were found during the survey or later when there were cases of diarrhoea. The difference between the percentage of positive excretors in the diarrhoea group and that in the normal-baby group is statistically significant (P<0.05). Very few other viral particles were found in the deposits examined by electron microscopy. 2 myxoviruslike particles, 2 coronavirus-like particles, a small 18 nm particle (possibly a parvovirus), 4 mycoplasma-like organisms, and a number of bacteriophages were the only other microorganisms seen. Attempts to isolate viruses by standard cell-culture techniques were unsuccess- More than 100 specimens were tested but no viruses were cultivated. Likewise bacteriological investigations did not reveal any pathogens. Age of Infection Continuing Presence of Virus and Seasonal Incidence 2 nurseries were studied continuously for 9 mo and another for 11 mo. Rotaviruses were regularly found in
