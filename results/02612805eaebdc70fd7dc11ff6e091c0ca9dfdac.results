The average COCI of older ACO patients was 0.55 (standard deviation = 0.3). A total of 243 patients (21.3%) had index values of 1, indicating maximum or all outpatient care received from the same physician. There were 644 (56.4%) and 254 (22.3%) of 1141 patients in the medium (0.3 ≤ COCI<1) and low (COCI < 0.3) COC groups, respectively. The mean age was 74.4 years, and men comprised 61.3% of the patients. Furthermore, 38.2% of the patients had a low insurance premium level. Regarding medical conditions in a preceding year, the percentage of patients who had hypertension and diabetes was 33.6% and 10.4%. 11.4% and 12.2% of the patients had at least one ED visits and admissions, respectively. Regarding the number of ambulatory visits for COPD or asthma during the COC period, 59.8% of the patients had 3 to 12 ambulatory visits. The overall rate for ED visits was 12.6%, and a negative association was found across all levels of COCI (high: 4.9%, medium: 14.6%, and low: 15.0%; P for trend <0.001). The overall rate for hospital admissions was 13.0% and the rate of admissions increased when COCI decreased (high: 7.8%, medium: 14.0%, and low: 15.4%; P for trend = 0.013). The characteristics of all patients and of each COC group are shown in Table 1 . The results of Cox proportional regression are presented in Table 2 . After adjustment, the patients in either the low or medium COC group had a significantly higher risk of ED visits for COPD or asthma compared with the patients in the high COC group (aHR, 2.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45-5.38; aHR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.47-4.93, respectively). In addition, the risk of ED visits was associated with a statistically significant increase of 4% for each additional year of age (aHR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07). Patients who had ED visits (aHR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.93-4.26) or admissions (aHR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.09-2.46) for COPD or asthma in the previous year had higher risks of ED visits for COPD or asthma than those who had no ED visits or admissions. Compared to the patients having 3-12 ambulatory visits, the patients having 13-24 or ≥25 ambulatory visits during the COC period were 100% (aHR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.39-2.88) or 191% (aHR, 2.91; 95% CI, 1.67-5.08) more likely to have ED visits for COPD or asthma, respectively. A similar trend was found in hospital admissions ( Table 2 ). The risk of hospital admissions for COPD or asthma for patients in the low and medium COC group was significantly higher than for those in the high COC group (aHR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.03-3.13; aHR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.04-2.83, respectively). Male patients had a higher risk of hospi-
