: During the ''herald'' wave of the swine influenza H1N1 pandemic, the diagnostic weighted point score system accurately identified probable swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia and accurately differentiated swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia from ILIs and other viral and bacterial community-acquired pneumonias. CONCLUSION: In hospitalized adults with ILIs and negative RIDTs, the diagnostic weighted diagnostic point score system, may be used to make a presumptive clinical diagnosis of swine influenza H1N1 pneumonia. (Heart Lung√í 2009;38:534-538.) Swine influenza (H1N1) pneumonia is caused by a novel influenza A virus containing genetic elements from swine influenza, human influenza, avian influenza, and Eurasian influenza. The current pandemic began in Veracruz, Mexico, and rapidly spread to the United States and then the rest of the world. The ''herald wave'' of the pandemic in the United States began in the New York area at the end of the seasonal human influenza A season. At that time, other respiratory viruses also continued circulating in the community. The initial cases of H1N1 were epidemiologically linked to individuals with H1N1 in the New York epicenter and to those who had recently returned from Mexico. However, very quickly, there were so many secondary cases that a recent or close-contact history of someone with H1N1 became less clear and therefore less helpful diagnostically. The initial cases were relatively mild, but the number of cases rapidly increased during the pandemic. The immediate clinical problem involved differentiating H1N1 from influenza-like illnesses (ILIs) in admitted adults. 1
