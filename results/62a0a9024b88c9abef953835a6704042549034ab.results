Coronaviruses were detected in 126 (11.5%) of 1,087 specimens using the Pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay. Coronaviruses were detected in every month except January with a 20.3% peak on winter months (July) (Figure 1 ). Peaks detection frequency was observed during 2002-2004 and 2008-2009 , with the highest detection in 2008 (Figure 1). Coronaviruses-positive cases were found from patients ranging in age from 2 months to 80 years, with a median age of 33 years. The majority (59%) was female. Twenty percent of coronaviruses-infected patients presented underlying diseases other than cardiac and/or transplanted conditions. Fifteen patients had hypertension, 5 had diabetes mellitus, 1 patient was HIV infected and 1 had congenital kidney disease. The prevalence of HCoV was higher among children with heart diseases (24.6%), patients under stem cell transplantation program (24.3%) and renal transplanted patients (20.2%) than others patients groups. Adults from community and healthcare workers showed similar infection rates despite of the occupational risk of the last group. The lowest ratios of coronaviruses-positive cases were obtained in children from community and hospitalized patients, 3.3% and 1.8%, respectively (Table 1). Coronaviruses-infection was significantly different (p < 0.05) among the studied populations. Children with heart diseases presented the highest risk of acquiring coronavirus infection (OR = 17.0; 95% CI 5.6 -51.8; p Â£ 0.0001) when compared with the other populations by logistic regression analysis. Coryza, cough and fever were the most common symptoms at presentation, reported in 86%, 80% and 49% of positive cases, respectively. Clinical characteristics of coronaviruses-infected patients are shown in Table 2 . Differences on clinical expressions were obtained among the studied populations (p < 0.05). Fever was less found among both renal and patients under stem cell transplantation program when compared with the other groups. Cyanosis was only reported in 1 child with heart disease and wheezing was reported only among hospitalized patients and children, both from community and with heart diseases. Dyspnea, another lower respiratory tract infection symptom besides wheezing, was documented among patients under stem cell transplantation program, children with heart diseases, children from community and hospitalized patients. Healthcare workers presented more sore throat and myalgia than the other studied populations.
