In a fi rst step, the M. myotis maternity colony was surveyed for bat-borne RNA viruses. Broad-range RT-PCR assays for CoVs and AstVs were employed on samples taken in 2008. Screening was extended to include AdVs described in microchiroptera and megachiroptera bats (6, 8, 20) . As shown in Figure 2 , a CoV, 6 different AstVs, and 1 novel AdV were found. The CoV (GenBank accession no. HM368166) was a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus and belonged to a tentative species defi ned by bat-CoV HKU6 (97.4% amino acid identity in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp], typing criteria as defi ned in [9] ). The 6 different mamastroviruses (GenBank accession nos. HM368168-HM368175) clustered phylogenetically with bat-associated AstV, which has been described previously (4, 21) , showing 65.0%-86.0% amino acid identities with related bat-associated AstV from M. chinensis and M. ricketti bats from the People's Republic of China ( Figure  2 ). The AdV constituted a novel Mastadenovirus species (GenBank accession no. HM368167) that was clearly separated from a clade of AdV recently reported in a M. ricketti bat in China and a Pipistrellus pipistrellus bat in Germany (6,20) (A. Kurth, pers. comm.). The closest relatives were bovine AdV C10 (GenBank accession no. AF282774) and Tupaia AdV (GenBank accession no. NC_004453), with 90.0% and 91.0% identity on the amino acid level, respectively. Amino acid identity with the Chinese bat AdV TJM (GenBank accession no. GU226970) was 83.5%. For all 3 viruses, strain-specifi c real-time RT-PCR assays, including cloned, in vitro-transcribed RNA or plasmid DNA quantifi cation standards, were generated (Table 1) . For AstV, 2 assays had to be designed to cover the high diversity of AstVs that was found. These assays were used to monitor virus abundance in the M. myotis bat maternity colony over time. CoV For AstV, no amplifi cation was associated with parturition in the same samples. Total detection rate of astroviruses was 51.2% before birth of the fi rst pup and 40.5% thereafter. However, prevalence and virus concentration signifi cantly increased in the second sampling than in the fi rst and fourth samplings, respectively (χ 2 7.4, p = 0.006); ANOVA, F = 4.4, p = 0.03). This pattern resembled the amplifi cation after formation of the colony as also observed in CoV. Figure 3 , panel B, shows AstV RNA concentrations over time. Concentration and detection rates of AdV were determined next. As shown in Figure 3 , panel C, no marked variation in prevalence was seen. Detection rate was 46.4% before birth of the fi rst pup and 57.7% thereafter. Although statistically signifi cant variation in virus concentrations could be observed (ANOVA, F = 8.2, p<0.001), this was exclusively contributed by slightly lower virus concentrations in the fi rst sampling than in the succeeding samples ( Table 2) . Because of the diverging pattern of amplifi cation of the RNA viruses (CoVs, AstVs) against the DNA virus (AdV), the investigation was repeated the next year (2009). All viruses were detected again ( Figure 3) . Unfortunately, the colony was found to be abandoned after the fi rst postparturition sampling, leaving an incomplete dataset for that year. Still, it could be seen and statistically confi rmed that the CoV was beginning to be amplifi ed after parturition (χ 2 7.85, p = 0.005), while no signifi cant variation in prevalence or virus concentration was visible for the other viruses (data not shown). A repetition of the full sampling scheme was attempted again in 2010. All 5 sampling dates could be completed, yielding a sample of 187 pools in total, equivalent to 935 individual fecal pellets. As shown in Figure 3 , the CoV showed the same 2 amplifi cation peaks as observed in 2008, one after formation of the colony and one after parturition. Mean virus concentrations these samples were signifi cantly increased compared with the samples taken at other times (ANOVA, F = 22.0, p<0.001). The detection rate during the fi rst peak was 100.0%, followed by 2-fold and 5-fold decreases 3 and 6 weeks later (χ 2 52.0, p<0.001), and an augmentation to 97.5% after parturition (χ 2 77.7, p<0.001). The maximal CoV concentration in 2010 was higher than in 2008, at 50,495,886,830 RNA copies/g of feces. The amplifi cation pattern of AstV showed clearer similarities to that of CoV in 2010. An initial peak of detection rate was 97.5%, followed by a detection rate of 22.2%-22.4% in subsequent samples and 97.5%-100% after parturition (χ 2 56.2 and 92.2, respectively, p<0.001). Virus concentrations were signifi cantly increased in these amplifi cation peaks (ANOVA, F = 7.8, p<0.001). The amplifi cation was almost completely contributed by one of the AstV lineages (represented by BtAstV/N58-49), while the other lineages were constant (Figure 3, panel B) . Notably, the BtAstV/ N58-49 lineage had been present only sporadically in the years before (Figure 3, panel B) . Detection frequency for AdV was 58.6% before parturition and 40.3% thereafter without any signifi cant variation in virus concentrations between sampling dates (ANOVA, F = 0.5, p = 0.72).
