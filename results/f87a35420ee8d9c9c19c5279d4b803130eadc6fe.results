In this section extensive numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the impact of population removal/recruitment and its effectiveness through Z-control mechanism by considering several situations like: (i) achieving a predetermined disease prevalence, (ii) disease eradication, (iii) biological feasibility of Z-control method, (iv) sensitivity between control parameter and other model parameters, (v) quantification of control parameter for different levels of disease endemicity.
