Approximately one-half of the parents approached for the study consented to enrollment. The most common reason given for refusal was a concern for an additional procedure on a very small baby, which may have skewed our population towards enrolling neonates of later GA. Fifty infants were enrolled into the study; 27 (54%) were male. The average GA was 28 weeks (range 24 to 32). Eighteen infants (36%) had GA <28 weeks. The average duration of birth hospitalization was 54.6 days. Twenty-five infants (50%) were intubated at some time during hospitalization, for a mean of 12.5 days. Twenty-eight infants (56%) required supplemental oxygen at some time during hospitalization, and 17 (34%) met criteria for diagnosis of BPD. Eleven infants were enrolled from the level 3 NICU, and 39 were from the level 4 regional NICU. One infant died. A total of 708 specimens were obtained and tested from the 50 patients over the 52-week period, for an average of 13.6 specimens per week. No weeks were missed but the level of Vol. 161, No. 5 November 2012 enrollment varied throughout the year-at any 1 time, the number of active patients from the level 3 NICU varied between 0 and 4, and at the level 4 NICU between 2 and 8. Sixty-six of 708 specimens tested positive for at least 1 respiratory virus; 26 neonates (52%) were positive for a respiratory virus on at least 1 occasion. The mean time to detection of the first positive sample was 24 days (range 0-92). For each infected patient, an average of 2.5 swabs were positive during their hospital stay (range 1-13). Viruses detected in the 26 positive patients were PIV3 (13 patients), hMPV (9 patients), RSV-B (8 patients), RSV-A (7 patients), PIV-2 (7 patients), entero/rhinovirus (7 patients), and influenza B (4 patients). Eighteen samples (28% of the positive swabs) included more than 1 virus, and some infants were positive for different viruses at different times. There was evidence of seasonality of detection of particular viruses, with clusters observed (Figure 1) . Fourteen patients had sequentially positive specimens for the same virus, with specimens positive over a range of 3-13 days; however, because we obtained specimens only twice weekly, an accurate determination of duration cannot be made. Sequential detection of hMPV, RSV B, PIV 3, and enterovirus/rotavirus occurred. Kaplan-Meier curves were created reflecting location, sex, GA, and birth weight in order to identify potential predictors of infection. The rate for RVIs was similar between the 2 NI-CUs (5 of 11 from NICU 1, and 21 of 39 from NICU 2, P = .74). The Kaplan-Meier curves comparing each location for sex, birth weights, or GA were not significantly different statistically ( Figure 2 ; available at www.jpeds.com), and the data from each NICU, therefore, were aggregated for comparison of infected and uninfected infants. Clinical comparisons between infected and uninfected infants are shown in Table I . Infected infants compared with uninfected infants had a longer average length of stay (70 days vs 35 days, P = .002), need for intubation (17 of 26 infected infants vs 7 of 24 uninfected infants, P = .01), average duration of intubation (19 days vs 5 days, P = .03), and duration of supplemental oxygen requirement (51 days vs 13 days, P = .002). Nineteen of the 26 infected infants required supplemental oxygen at some point during their hospitalization, compared with 9 of the 24 uninfected infants (P = .006). Seventeen infants required oxygen at an adjusted GA of 36 weeks (the criteria for diagnosis of BPD); 12 of the 17 were among the virus-infected infants and the remaining 5 were uninfected. The probability of acquiring infection was significantly higher for infants diagnosed with BPD (P < .05; Figure 3 ; available at www. jpeds.com). Supplemental oxygen requirements also were higher in the infected cohort. We identified only a single timepoint when 1 uninfected infant required an inhaled concentration of oxygen above 50%, an event that occurred at 36 separate timepoints in the infected group. A Cox proportional hazards model showed modestly significant effects of GA after adjusting for the effect of NICU units and sex (Table II ; available at www.jpeds.com). At each NICU, an infant with lower GA was more likely to be infected. The effect of birth weight in the Cox model was reversed compared with the marginal effect seen in Kaplan-Meier analysis, but 1 child with massive hydrocephalus had a very high birth weight for GA, which skewed the model. When this outlier was removed, the data points tended to cluster with no clear trend (data not shown). We proposed a path model to determine whether virus infection directly extended length of hospital stay or whether this effect was mediated by the need for intubation and oxygen use. The model was confirmed in SAS using covariance analysis of linear structural equations. The effect of RVI on length of stay appeared to be mediated partially through effects on the respiratory system, as there were significant standardized indirect effects of infection on length of stay (P = .001). When THE JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS www.jpeds.com Vol. 161, No. 5 2 outliers were excluded (1 infant who died on day of life 1, another who was discharged to an outlying hospital and lost to follow-up), infection was significantly correlated to length of stay through both direct (P < .003) and indirect (P < .0005) effects ( Figure 4 ; available at www.jpeds.com). Table I shows clinical events in infected and uninfected infants. On average, infected infants had nearly double the number of desaturation events compared with the uninfected cohort (7.1 episodes/d vs 3.9 episodes/d, P < .0001). Episodes of bradycardia were the same between the 2 groups, and there were significantly fewer apnea events among infected infants. This latter finding may have been due to the confounding factor that infected infants were more likely being mechanically ventilated, which precluded apnea. Most infants were evaluated for bacterial infection at the time of birth, and again later at the discretion of the clinical team. A total of 118 blood cultures were obtained from the 50 study patients. Significantly more cultures were obtained from the virus-infected infants than from virus-uninfected infants (70 vs 38, P = .008). Eleven cultures were positive for bacteria from 6 of the virus-infected infants compared with 6 positive bacterial cultures from 4 of the virusuninfected infants (23.1% of virus-infected infants had a positive culture, compared with 16.7% of virus-uninfected infants (P = .73 by Fisher exact test). Of the 11 positive bacterial cultures in infants infected with a viral pathogen, some were repeatedly positive for the same organism. In addition, 1 virus-infected infant had 2 separate blood cultures positive for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Klebsiella, and another had 3 separate cultures positive for Klebsiella sp, MRSA, and Candida sp. The 6 positive blood cultures from infants who never had a virus detected occurred in 4 infants, with 2 sets being repeatedly positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis. All clinical deteriorations and clinical events noted in study patients were reviewed, and changes in respiratory support were associated with coincident oxygen desaturation events. Compared with virus-infected infants, uninfected infants displayed few clinical deteriorations beyond the first few days of life; 38 clinical deteriorations occurred in 26 infected infants vs 8 clinical deteriorations in 24 uninfected infants. During 27 (71%) clinical deteriorations, RVI was detected simultaneously. All 14 episodes of sequential detections of RVIs were associated with clinical deteriorations. Additionally, 7 of the 11 positive blood cultures in the virus-infected group were associated with deteriorations. Specific details for each neonate with RVI detections are shown in Table III (available at www.jpeds.com).
