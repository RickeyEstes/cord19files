Clinical and pathological observations. Clinical signs upon inoculation of sows. Two sows, which were inoculated with a cell culture-adapted PEDV strain (PEDV EU, group A1) showed slight depression over a period of four days, accompanied by reduced feed intake. In contrast, the two sows of group B1 (inoculated with German field PEDV, DE) showed diarrhea and vomiting upon inoculation. Moreover, both sows were anorectic for one day. Thereafter, one of the sows (ear tag 6150) was still showing slight depression over four days whereas the other was free of clinical signs again. All four sows of groups A2 and B2, which stayed naïve prior to farrowing, remained healthy during the pre-farrowing time. Clinical signs upon inoculation of piglets. Sows which were naïve before farrowing and got infected via their inoculated piglets during the trial, showed more severe clinical signs according to our standardized score system for sows (Table 1) than sows, which were directly inoculated four weeks before farrowing (see above). Almost complete anorexia, watery diarrhea, and decrease in milk production was observed from 60 h after the inoculation of the piglets in sows of groups A2 and B2 (see Supplementary Fig. F1 ). The lack of milk production led to a more severe situation for their unprotected infected piglets (malnutrition). Sows, which were inoculated before farrowing (sows of groups A1 and B1), did not show any clinical signs indicative for PED upon challenge of their piglets. One sow of group A1 died from septicaemia two days after farrowing (necropsy revealed severe peritonitis after uterine rupture and intestinal invagination). The respective piglets (which had all taken colostrum) were reared by the remaining sow of group A1. As can be seen in Fig. 1 , none of the MDA-positive piglets showed any severe clinical signs indicative for PED upon challenge inoculation. Very mild signs were discontinuously observed in some animals (pasty feces). One litter (group B1, sow 4423) showed general weakness and remittent shivering leading to clinical scores prior to inoculation. A viral genesis could not be detected by routine PCRs (Porcine enteroviruses (PEV), Suid alphaherpesvirus-1, Classical and African swine fever virus, Atypical porcine pestivirus). Piglets without MDA and inoculated with the cell culture-adapted virus (PEDV EU, group A2) started vomiting 24 hours post inoculation (hpi), and showed diarrhea from 36 hpi. The clinical signs remained over 6 to 7 days with diarrhea as the leading sign (see Fig. 1 , upper graph). MDA-negative piglets challenged with the German field material (DE), started to show signs indicative of PED at 24 hpi, also beginning with vomiting followed by diarrhea. Clinical signs persisted over 10 to 11 days (Fig. 1, lower graph) . As the respective sows showed an almost complete cessation of milk production, piglets showed signs of malnutrition. Two piglets had to be euthanized with an endpoint clinical score because of dehydration and general weakness. Necropsy of the euthanized piglets showed gas-filled intestines. All other piglets were without specific results indicative for PED at the time point of necropsy (end of the trial). Clinical score values differed significantly between groups with and without MDA from 2 to 10 days post inoculation (dpi). In addition, a statistically significant difference was observed at 1 dpi between groups A1 and A2, and 12 to 14 dpi between groups B1 and B2. The above mentioned condition in one litter of group B1 led to a significant difference at the day of challenge that was however not PED related. interested in feed  without clear feed intake  Watery feces, reddened anal region, vomiting   3  Strong depression, almost entirely resting,  decreased milk production, abortion  Total anorexia  Watery feces with blood or fibrin added,  highly reddened anal region, vomiting   Table 1 .

All naïve sows were negative prior to the inoculation of piglets. PEDV shedding of piglets. Detection of PEDV genome occurred in all groups but to a much lesser extent in the MDA-positive animals (see Fig. 2 , PEDV EU in the upper graph, field material DE in the lower). In general, the amount of detectable PEDV genome was influenced by the faecal load on the swab. However, as this phenomenon occurred in all groups, it was regarded as systematic error. All below mentioned genome copy numbers refer to 1 µl RNA extracted from 100 µl faecal suspension (all swabs were submerged in 1 ml medium, irrespective of their load). Piglets of groups A1 and A2 showed viral RNA in rectal swabs beginning 1 dpi until 20 dpi, and the genome load was markedly lower in piglets of group A1 with MDA. Significant differences were found among groups A1 and A2 on 1, 2, 13, and 17 dpi with higher genome loads in the animals without MDA (A2). On the other days, the genome loads were still higher in group A2, but not significantly different. It was quite the same in group B. In this case, genome loads were significantly higher on 1 to 5 dpi and 13 to 18 dpi in piglets without MDA (B2). In more detail, all animals of group A2 were found positive at 1 dpi with genome loads between 1100 and 147000 genome copies per µl, whereas only low virus shedding could be detected in group A1 with genome copy numbers ranging from 0.2 to 64 per µl (see Fig. 2 , upper chart). At 2 dpi, a comparable picture was seen at lower level. However, single results varied considerably (genome copies ranging from 0 to 47000 in group A2 and 0 to 26 in group A1). Only low copy numbers were detected for all animals at 3 dpi (no significant differences). Up to 7 dpi, mainly low genome loads were detected with single animals showing considerable shedding (up to 213500 copies per µl for a MDA negative piglet at 5 dpi). At 7 dpi all but one piglets of group A2 still showed genome loads of 0.4 to 33000 genome copies per µl. Animals of group A1 showed generally lower genome loads with 0.2 to 850 genome copies per µl. Only one piglet of this groups shed higher genome loads with 9600 genome copies per µl. Thereafter, shedding decreased, with faster decline in the MDA positive groups (see Fig. 2 , upper graph). Compared to group A2, MDA negative animals of group B2 showed higher initial virus shedding (up to 18000000 copies per µl) at 1 and 2 dpi. Only a few animals of the MDA positive group were detected positive for a few days with genome loads ranging from 0.15 and 37 genome copies. From 3 dpi, virus shedding decreased gradually with scattered positive findings and high variability. From 17 dpi, all MDA positive animals (B1) were negative while shedding still occurred in MDA negative animals of group B2 (see Fig. 2 , lower graph). Detection of other relevant pathogens. The inoculum of the sows was tested negative for transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine delta coronavirus. Positive results were obtained for porcine circovirus 2, rotavirus A, and porcine enteroviruses (PEV). The piglet inoculum was tested positive for PEV genome (cq value: 30) and showed negative results for all other pathogens. However, no PEV-shedding could be detected in piglets, which showed signs that might have been indicative for PEV infection (group B2; litter of sows 4423 and 6150). The cell culture adapted virus (PEDV EU, groups A1 and A2) was free of all tested pathogens.
