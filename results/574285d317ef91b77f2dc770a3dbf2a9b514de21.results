In cats with URTD, the prevalence was higher for FCV (100%) than for FHV-1 (43.00%) but in clinically normal cats the prevalence was about 50.00% for each virus. Some common clinical signs between both FCV and FHV infections were just seen in cats with FCV (Table 1) . For example, sneezing and coughing never observed in FHV-1 positive cats. Also, prevalence rate of co-infection in both viruses was 30.00% totally (in sick and healthy animals), which just half of them showed clinical disease ( Table 2 ). According to the results, rate of infection with these two viruses, especially FCV, in domestic cats were higher than other reports. Stomatitis was seen in 50.00% of cats with URTD. On our surprise, in 50.00% of cats with corneal ulcers, both FHV and FCV were detected, but in remaining 50.00%, we only found FCV though it has been shown that corneal ulcers are associated with FHV-1 infection (Table 1) . Cats showing clinical signs of URTD were all less than 6 months of age. There was no association between FHV or FCV infections with gender and outdoor access of cats. Also, prevalence rate of FIV and FeLV infections in cats with URTD (87.00% and 93.00%, respectively) were significantly higher than its rates in normal cats (42.00% and 65.00%, respectively). Male and outdoor cats were more infected than female and indoors (Tables 2 and 3) . Interestingly, 43.00% of cats with URTD were positive for all viruses (FHV-1, FCV, FIV and FeLV). Figures 2, 3 and 4 show results of PCR (or RT-PCR) for FIV, FCV1, FHV and FeLV. Table 1 . Association between clinical signs in cats with URTD and infection with FIV, FeLV, FCV, FHV-1.
