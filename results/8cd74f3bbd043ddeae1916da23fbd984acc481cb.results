Two hundred and nineteen patients with symptoms of RTI and 100 asymptomatic controls were included in the study. Ten patients were excluded (Table 1) , leaving 209 for the final analysis. An infectious agent was identified in 94 patients (43%) and in 2 controls (2%). Demographic characteristics and the agents detected are presented in Table 1 . No cases of Enteroviruses or Chlamydia pneumoniae were identified. In 7% of positive outcomes (n = 7) more than one agent was identified (data not shown).
