Effect of CdCl 2 on the cell viability of human MRC-9 normal lung and A549 cancer cells. The viability of the normal and cancerous lung cells exposed to various CdCl 2 concentrations was demonstrated to be dose-dependent (Fig. 1) . The viability of the normal lung MRC-9 cells was reduced by 6, 11, 11, 44, 55, 60 and 75% (Fig. 1A) , while the viability of the A594 lung cancer cells was decreased by 13, 36, 42, 58, 65, 76 and 81% ( (Fig. 2) . The cytokine levels decreased with increasing concentration and duration (Fig. 2) . The results clearly demonstrated that normal MRC-9 lung cells responded to the toxic effect of CdCl 2 with high expression levels of the cytokines in the lysate at early time points and high concentrations and longer exposure durations of CdCl 2 demonstrated toxic effects on the expression levels of the cytokines. Fig. 3 , the expression levels of IL-1α and IL-10 cytokines in the A549 lung cancer cells treated with 0, 50, 100 or 150 µM CdCl 2 concentrations for 6, 12, 18 or 24 h were detected. The lung cancer cells treated with 50 µM CdCl 2 for 12 h demonstrated the maximum expression of each cytokine, and the expression levels decreased as the duration of exposure and concentration of CdCl 2 increased (Fig. 3) . The results clearly demonstrated the response of the A549 lung cancer cells to the toxic effect of CdCl 2 , with high expression of cytokines at high concentrations and longer exposure durations of CdCl 2 , demonstrating the toxic effect on the expression of cytokines.
