By February 16, 2020, a total of 68 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was included in the final analysis, among whom 30 were from Qingdao and 38 were from Wuhan ( Table 1 All patients had respiratory specimens tested for specific IgM antibodies against IFV-A, IFV-B, RSV, ADV, PIV, MP, LP, CP and COX. Among the 30 patients admitted in Qingdao, 24 patients had IgM antibodies detected against at least one of the above-mentioned pathogens, and the overall positive rate was 80.00% (Table 3) ; whereas only one (2.63%) of the patients in Wuhan had positive results for respiratory pathogens. The most common respiratory viruses detected were IFV-A (60.00%) and IFV-B (53.33%), followed by MP (23.33%) and LP (20.00%). Ages of healthy control group ranged from 20 to 55 years, with a median age of 40 years All rights reserved.

Only 4 people (13.33%) of this group had specific-IgM antibody detected in their serum, suggesting asymptomatic infection with single virus (IFV-B). The total infection rate in healthy control was significantly lower than that in COVID-19 patients (P<0.0001, Table 4 ), and none of the individual in control group showed evidence of combined infection with two or more pathogens. The climatic characteristics of Qingdao and Wuhan from December to January of following year were shown in Table 5 , where differences could be observed between the two cities. Although the climate in Qingdao is drier and colder than Wuhan, major respiratory pathogens circulate in the two cities were quite similar.
