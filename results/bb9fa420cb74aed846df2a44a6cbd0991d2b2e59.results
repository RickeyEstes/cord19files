Identification of lycorine as an inhibitor of WNV and DENV-1 Lycorine (Fig. 1A) has been reported to have antiviral activities (See Introduction). To test whether lycorine inhibits flaviviruses, we initially screened the compound using a viral-like particle (VLP)based infection assay. As depicted in Fig. 1B , VLPs of WNV and DENV-1 were prepared by trans-supply viral structural proteins (CprME; through an alphavirus Semliki Forest virus [SFV] expression vector) to package corresponding replicon RNAs containing a luciferase reporter (Rluc2A-Rep). The titers of the VLPs were estimated to be 2.5 × 10 6 and 2.4 × 10 3 FFU/ml for WNV and DENV-1, respectively. Vero cells were infected with 1 FFU/cell of WNV VLP or with 0.01 FFU/cell of DENV-1 VLP (due to the low titer of DENV-1 VLP). The infected cells were treated with 1.5 μM lycorine or were mock-treated with 1% DMSO. At 24 h post-infection (p.i.), lycorine reduced the luciferase signals by 1400-and 1200-fold in the WNV and DENV-1 VLP-infected cells, respectively (Fig. 1C ). Higher concentrations of lycorine were also tested; however, due to cytotoxicity, these results are not presented (see next section). The results indicate that lycorine inhibits WNV and DENV-1.
