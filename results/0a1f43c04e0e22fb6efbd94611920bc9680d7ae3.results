Cases with SLE showed a significantly higher TNF-α −308 (GA + AA genotypes) compared to controls (26.4% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.009, OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.26-4.99) (Table 1) . Similarly, cases showed a significantly higher carriage rate for the IFNG-γ + 874 (AT + TT genotypes) compared to controls (47.2% vs. 32.1%, p = 0.02, OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.11-3.21) ( Table 2) . This was mainly due to the higher frequency of the heterozygous TNF-α GA and INF-γ AT genotypes, consistent with the dominant mode of inheritance. On other hand, comparing the homozygous genotype frequency between cases and control (recessive model) did not yield any significant difference. The frequencies of TNF-α and IFN-γ genotypes were in agreement with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both groups of SLE cases and controls (p N 0.05) (Tables 1 and 2). Cases of TNF-α GA + AA genotypes vs. those with the GG genotype (1 and 2) represent genotype GA, lanes (3 and 4) represent genotype GA, lanes (5 and 6) represent genotype GA, lanes (7 and 8) represent genotype GA, lanes (9 and 10) represent genotype GA, TNF-α −308 GNA was detected at 184 bp. and those having the INF-γ AT + TT genotypes vs. those with the AA genotype revealed no significant difference regarding their age, gender and nephritis class, activity and chronicity indices (p N 0.05) ( Table 3) .
