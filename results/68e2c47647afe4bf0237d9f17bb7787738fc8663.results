A total of eighty-seven fecal samples from two species of bat (E. helvum and E. gambianus) were collected from three localities of the South West Region of Cameroon: Limbe, Lysoka, and Muyuka ( Fig. 1) (Yinda et al. 2016b ). These samples were divided over twenty-five pools of one to five samples each, enriched for viral particles and then sequenced. Illumina sequencing yielded a total of 218 million reads and approximately half was trimmed out in the quality control and deduplication process. Out of the remaining 108 million reads, 14% could be assigned as viral while 86% was non-viral (bacterial, host, or dark matter). Most of the viral reads were assigned as phages (89%) and about 11% were eukaryotic viruses (as summarized in Table 1 ). Only a single pool was made from the samples from E. gambianus fruit bat, which generated mainly phage viral reads after sequencing. Therefore, all eukaryotic genomes described here were from E. helvum. Many of the eukaryotic viral reads belong to vertebrate infecting viral families/orders possessing known and potentially causative agents for gastroenteritis in humans. In particular, we identified members of the order Picornavirales and the families Caliciviridae, Reoviridae, Astroviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Circorviridae, and Parvoviridae. In addition, viruses with a high zoonotic potential belonging to the family Coronaviridae (Betacoronavirus), as well as viruses with a low potential of crossing the species barrier (Papillomaviridae) were detected (Fig. 2) . Strikingly, most of the rotavirus (RV) (family Reoviridae) positive samples were detected in adult pools (92%, Fig. 2B ). This is unlike in other animal (including humans) wherein RV mostly infect their young (Parashar et al. 2006) . Moreover, we observed geographical differences in the percentage of pools in which eukaryotic viral families were present (Fig. 2D ). These differences in the sampling sites (i.e. Limbe, Lysoka and Moyuka) maybe due to differences in the acute infections going on at the time of sampling or due to differences in the age of captured bats (all juvenile bats were from Limbe). A detailed analyses of the viruses belonging to the order Picornavirales and the families Papillomaviridae, Reoviridae (RVA) and Caliciviridae (Sapovirus) have been reported elsewhere (Yinda et al. 2016a (Yinda et al. , b, 2017a Here, we analyzed the remaining viral sequences belonging to double-stranded RNA (families Reoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Partitiviridae), single-stranded RNA (families Astroviridae and Coronaviridae) and single-stranded DNA (families Parvoviridae and Circoviridae) viral groups. All the sizes of the contig (genomes) described in this study, together with their sequence coverage and closest GenBank hit can be found on Supplementary Table S1. 3. Double-stranded RNA viral sequences 3.1 Identification of the first near complete bat rotavirus H genome RVs are major enteric pathogen causing severe dehydrating diarrhea mostly in the young of humans and animals worldwide (Bridger et al. 1998) . RVs belong to the family Reoviridae and the genus RV consists of nine species, A to I (Attoui et al. 2012; Mihalov-KovÃ¡ cs et al. 2015) . RVAs are the most common of all the species having a wide host range including humans. Unlike RVA, RVH, initially referred to as Novel adult diarrhoea RV was mainly identified in humans (China and Bangladesh) and pigs from Brazil, USA, and South Africa (Alam et al. 2007; Jiang et al. 2008; Nagashima et al. 2008; Marthaler et al. 2014; Molinari et al. 2015) . We identified RVH reads in two different bat pools, including one near complete genome. Based on genetic relatedness, all the eleven bat RVH segments recovered were distantly related to those of human (19-74% aa identity) and porcine (29-80% aa identity) RVH strains. The eleven bat RVH gene segments were more or less equally distantly related to both human and porcine RVH strains. Similarly, based on the phylogenetic analysis, bat, porcine, and human RVH strains formed three distinct sub-clusters distantly related to each other (Fig. 3) . A recent paper described partial sequences of VP1, VP3 and VP4 RVH sequences (268, 340, and 202 nt, respectively) from South Korean bat fecal samples (Kim et al. 2016 ). These Korean bat RVH strains were only distantly related to human, porcine and the Cameroonian bat RVH strains (nt identity of 68-71%) described here, suggesting a broad genetic diversity of bat RVH strains ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). RVH was first identified as a cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis in humans in China in 1997 and in a sporadic case of adult diarrhea in Bangladesh (Alam et al. 2007; Jiang et al. 2008 ). It has also been increasingly identified in pigs but this might simply be as a results of improved surveillance rather than recent spread. The current identification of RVH in bats further expands its host range and opens new perspetives on the evolutionary origin and history of this pathogen. It has been clearly associated with gastroenetritis in humans and less clearly in pigs as most known infections occur in co-infections (Rosen et al. 2000) . PBVs have been identified in feces of several mammals, birds, and invertebrates, and in the respiratory tract of pigs and humans (Pereira et al. 1988; Smits et al. 2011 Smits et al. , 2012 Mondal and Majee 2014; ) . PBVs are currently classified into two genogroups (Smits et al. 2011; Malik et al. 2014 ) and recently, a large number of novel PBV-like sequences from insects have family that could not be assigned to any known genus are referred to as others. Families represented by less than 100 reads were excluded. been described (Shi et al. 2016 ). Here, we identified five contigs with a PBV-like RdRp sequence. Surprisingly, these RdRP open reading frames (ORFs) could not be identified using the standard genetic translation code, and only when alternative genetic codes were used, a single large ORF could be identified. All these alternative genetic codes are those of invertebrate mitochondria and have in common a reassignment of the TGA stop to another amino acid (e.g. a tryptophan). An RdRp-based phylogenetic tree indicated that all PBV-like sequences in GenBank globally fall into two main clusters. One cluster mainly contains PBVs that use standard genetic code for protein translation, while the other clade contains PBV-like sequences that make exclusive use of the alternative genetic code for translation (Fig. 4A ). Exceptions to this rule are the Chinese strain (Hubei picobirnalike virus 3) and the Cameroonian strain (Lysoka picobirna-like virus P16-366), both of which use an alternative genetic code, despite clustering within PBVs that use standard genetic code. In the clade of PBV-like viruses that use the alternative genetic code, three of the novel bat strains, P11-378, P14-90, and P15-218 share >98% aa identity and clustered with Beihai picobirna-like Virus 4, 5, and 6 identified in hermit crabs in China (Fig. 4A ). The distant phylogenetic clustering of these strains with crustacean
