To determine how well sendout and in-house test results can be anticipated based on basic information available in the medical record, we used two independent methods-generalized linear modeling (GLM) and classification and regression trees (CART)to build simple, robust test-result predictors and then evaluated the performance of these predictors according to the standard clinical metrics of positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), as well as sensitivity and specificity via the receiveroperator curve (ROC) area under the curve (AUC). As proof of principle for GLM, we first tested it on the anion gap, a result calculated by subtracting the serum concentrations of the anions chloride and bicarbonate from those of the cations sodium and potassium, and confirmed that our methods found a rule for elevated anion gap based on these four items. We next applied GLM to 81 sendout tests ordered regularly at our hospital. GLM generated rules for just 11 of these tests. For the remaining tests, either no recent diagnosis or in-house test result (or age or gender) was sufficiently correlated with the sendout test result, or there were not enough instances in which correlated items appeared with the result, to generate a rule. Only two tests-for high corticotropin (ACTH) and for low ceruloplasmin-had NPV$0.95. Of these, ceruloplasmin had a PPV$0.94. The mean AUC for all rules was 0.69, with models for only three tests having an average AUC$0.75 over 10 repeat runs. Removal of features that did not appear in a majority of rules had essentially no effect on these AUCs (difference in mean AUC#0.02). CART generated rules for 60 tests. However, the AUC for most of these rules was low, with only five tests having AUC$0.75: free T3, alpha-macroglobulin, CA27-29, hyaluronic acid, and alpha fetoprotein (AUC 0.75-0.79). We next applied GLM to in-house tests. A total of 170 in-house tests were analyzed. A number of rules exhibited a high PPV (the probability of seeing an abnormal value given a prediction of an abnormal value by the rule) or NPV (the probability of seeing a normal value given prediction of a normal value). These were mostly components of the complete blood count (CBC) and metabolic panels. Interestingly, the predictive power of these rules was almost exclusively based on a previous measurement of the test in question: in other words, the best rules were for repeat tests, and the best predictor of a result being normal or abnormal was whether it had been normal or abnormal within the previous seven days. For example, the NPV for a low red blood cell count was 0.95 (with PPV = 0.75), with a rule that depended most on the previous red blood cell count also having been low, and the PPV for high total calcium was 0.98 (NPV = 0.76) and based exclusively on the previous total calcium having been high. For comparison, we applied CART to in-house tests, again including in the input data the most recent result for that test if performed within a week of the order. Again, a number of rules exhibited a high PPV ($0.95), and again these were often tests of the CBC and metabolic panels, with rules based almost exclusively on a previous abnormal value. Examples included low white blood cell count (WBC; PPV = 0.97, NPV = 0.79), platelet count (0.95, 0.88), and serum sodium (0.96, 0.65), and high total calcium (0.99, 0.67), mean corpuscular volume (0.98, 0.84), and iron (0.97, 0.56) all of which were determined almost exclusively from the previous value being low or high (Table 1) . Overall, there was good agreement in PPV between GLM and CART for tests for which both methods found rules, but CART outperformed GLM noticeably in NPV (Fig. 2 ).
