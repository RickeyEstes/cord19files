No bacterial pathogens were found in 54% of TBL samples (212/396) and no mycoplasma in 27% of samples (108/396). None of the samples harboured M. bovis (Table 1 ). The majority of P. multocida isolates (102/136, 75%) were indole-negative. Two or more bacterial species were found in 10% of samples (n = 40), and a single bacterial pathogen in 36% (n = 144) of samples. Four different bacterial pathogens were detected in three samples. P. multocida, Arcanobacterium pyogenes and Fusobacterium participated in the majority of mixed infections. However, most of the P. multocida isolates were from single infections (77%), whereas 74% and 76% of A. pyogenes and Fusobacterium spp. infections, respectively, were observed in mixed infections. Concurrent presence of mycoplasmas and bacteria was observed in 38% of samples, and the majority of herds were infected with one or more viruses ( Table 2) . Isolation of P. multocida, Fusobacterium spp. or U. diversum in TBL samples was associated with clinical respiratory disease ( p < 0.05) (Table 3) . However, no association was found with the isolation of P. multocida or Fusobacterium and clinical respiratory disease when no other pathogenic bacteria or mycoplasma were present in the sample. A. pyogenes, P. multocida, M. dispar, U. diversum, M. bovirhinis and Fusobacterium spp. were detected in more than 50% of herds, whereas M. haemolytica, H. somni and Bordetella bronchiseptica were found in five, two and one herd, respectively (Table 1 ). The herds infected with P. multocida or with various mycoplasma species had more calves (mean 3.3-5.7) infected with BAV PIV3 RSV BCV 1 À À À À À À + (1) + (1) À À À À À 2 À À À À + (1) À + (2) + (9) À À À À À 3 b À À À À À À À À À À + À À 4 +(2) À À À À À + (3) À À À + + À 5 + (10) À À À + (2) + (3) + (8) + (9) À À + + + 6 À + (1) À À + (1) + (1) À À + (4) À + À À 7 c À À À À + (1) + (1) + (3) + (8) + (4) + + + + 8 À À À À + (1) + (1) + (2) + (1) + (1) + + + + 9 + (5) À À À + (1) À + (8) + (9) + (3) À + À + 10 + (6) À + (1) À + (1) À + (4) + (8) + (2) + + + À 11 + (7) À À + (1) + (2) + (1) + (1) À + (5) + + + + 12 + (5) + (1) À À À À + (4) + (10) + (8) À + À À 13 + (5) À + (1) À À À + (9) + (7) + (4) À À + + 14 À À À + (3) À À + (1) À + (4) À À À + 15 À À À À À À + (1) + (4) + (5) + À À À 16 + (3) À À À + (1) + (1) + (1) + (3) + (6) + À À À 23 + (1) À À + (2) À + (2) À + (2) + (5) + À + À 24 + (5) + (2) + (1) À + (3) + (4) + (4) + (9) + (7) + + À + 25 À À À + (1) + (1) À + (1) + (5) + (9) À À À À 26 + (1) À À + (5) À + (1) À + (7) + (5) + + À À 27 À À À + (1) À + (1) À À + (1) À À À À 28 + (3) À À + (1) + (1) + (2) + (3) + (3) + (10) À À À À 29 + (2) + (1) À À À À + (2) À + (7) + À À À 30 + (3) + (1) À À À + (2) + (1) + (2) + (6) + À À À 31 + (5) À À À + (1) + (2) + (2) + (5) + (5) + + + À 32 + (4) À À À À À À + (7) + (2) À À À À 33 + (3) À À + (1) + (1) À À + (2) + (4) À + À + 34 + (7) + (1) À À À + (1) + (4) + (3) + (5) + + + + 35 À À À À + (1) + (1) À + (5) + (4) + + À + 36 + (7) À À + (1) + (3) + (2) + (7) + (3) + (8) + À + À 37 c + (9) À À À À À + (5) + (7) + (5) À À À + 38 + (5) + (1) À + (2) + (1) + (2) À À + (4) + + À + 39 + (4) À À + (1) À À À + (7) À À À + À 40 + (7) À + (2) À + (1) In 19 herds only indole-negative and in four herds, only indole-positive phenotypic variants of P. multocida were found. Both variants were detected in five herds. Most herds (78%) harboured more than one bacterial pathogen (Table 2) . A maximum of five different bacterial pathogens were detected in two herds (herds 24 and 38). Concurrent detection of different mycoplasma species was common, and in half of the herds all three mycoplasma species, M. dispar, M. bovirhinis and U. diversum, were found (Table 2 ). In one herd (herd 15) no bacterial pathogens were detected, but co-existing infections with all three mycoplasmas and adenovirus were observed. All six herds with no viral infections had mycoplasmas and three of them U. diversum. Bacterial species prevalent in the virus-negative herds were P. multocida, M. varigena, S. suis, Fusobacterium spp. and A. pyogenes. RSV and BCV were detected by PCR in TBL samples of 10 herds and PIV3 in 6 herds ( Table 1 ). The mean number of PCR-positive samples for each virus varied from 2.5 to 4.6 in the herds. Seroconversion to viruses occurred in 16-19% of the animals, whereas 2-11% of animals turned seronegative in sample 2 (Table 4) . Calves with a positive BCV, PIV3 or RSV PCR result in the TBL sample had a significantly ( p < 0.05, t-test) greater increase in the levels of antibodies of BCV, PIV3 or RSV, respectively (shown as change in the OD value), than those with a negative PCR result. However, there were two herds with TBL samples positive either for RSV or BCV, but without a significant rise in antibody level in any of the 10 calves analysed. For each virus, there were 16-21 herds that could be classified as infected with the virus, PIV3 being the a Significantly more prevalent in healthy and suspect categories than in the diseased category ( p < 0.05). b Significantly more prevalent in diseased than in healthy and suspect ( p < 0.05). most widely spread (Table 2 ). In six herds, no viral infections were detected. A single viral infection occurred in 11 (28%) herds, whereas mixed viral infections occurred in more than half (58%) of the herds. Concurrent infections with two or three viruses were both seen in nine herds. Four concurrent viral infections were found in five herds. BCV was detected more often in faecal samples (n = 70) than in TBL samples (n = 46). Eighty-six calves had BCV in TBL or faecal samples, and 30 of these calves had BCV in both TBL and faeces. Seroconversion to BCV was observed more often in herds in which BCV was detected in TBL than in herds with BCV-positive faecal samples (Table 5 ). BCV was found in faecal samples in 13 herds, and in 8 of these herds BCV was also detected in TBL samples (Table 5 ). In six herds, BCV was detected in more than half of the faecal samples. In two of these herds, BCV was detected in all 10 TBL samples and in other two herds in 4 TBL samples.
