Optimum reaction temperature and time for the diagnosis of PEDV by RT-PSR Electrophoretograms showed no obvious difference in the gradient bands produced at temperatures ranging from 60°C to 64°C; however, the bands were slightly more obvious at 62°C. With increasing reaction time, the bands become more visible, and reached a peak at 50 min. Therefore, the optimum temperature and time for detecting PEDV by RT-PSR was 62°C and 50 min, respectively. The RT-PSR assay for PEDV detection was optimized as follows: reverse transcription at 42°C for 15 min and spiral amplification at 62°C for 50 min.
