The FIPV pathotype was detected in 25/59 effusion samples. Of these, 24 were from cats with FIP, but one effusion sample from a control cat was also positive for FIPV with mutation M1058L. Mutation M1058L was found in 23/25 FIPV samples. Mutation S1060A was found in none of the FIPV samples. A mixed pathotype of FIPV and FECV was detected in 2/59 effusion samples (all from cats with FIP). In 12/ 59 effusion samples, FCoV RNA was detected, but pathotyping was not possible (BLD or IND). The remaining 22/59 effusion samples did not contain FCoV RNA (Tables 1, 2
