This comparative case control prospective study was conducted on 50 patients admitted to the Critical Care Medicine Department &Respiratory Intensive Care Unit in Alexandria Main University Hospital by acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and fulfilling the criteria for application of non invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Patients were randomly assigned into two equal groups by allocated randomization: Group I (cases): 25 patients received conventional medical treatment plus early fiberoptic bronchoscopy during non invasive ventilation. Group II (controls): 25 patients received only conventional medical treatment and noninvasive ventilation. Comparison between the two studied groups according to arterial blood gases at different periods At admission, patients were initially managed with repeated sittings of bronchodilator nebulizer through a face mask with O2 flow 5-10 L/min, pH in group I ranged between 7.23 and 7.32 with a mean value of 7.27 ± 0.03 while in group II, pH ranged between 7.22 and 7.32 with a mean value of 7.28 ± 0.03 with no statistical difference between both groups (p 0.059). Six to twelve hours from admission during NIV (before Bronchoscopy), pH in group I ranged between 7.25 and 7.34 with a mean value of 7.30 ± 0.03 while in group II, pH ranged from 7.10 to 7.36 with a mean value of 7.29 ± 0.08 with no significant statistical difference between both groups (p 0.561). 8-14 h from admission during NIV (2 h after bronchoscopy in group I), Improvement of pH in group I ranged between 7.33 and 7.46 with a mean value of 7.38 ± 0.04 which was significantly better than values in group II, as pH ranged from 7.31 to 7.38 with a mean value of 7.36 ± 0.02 (p 0.015). At admission on face mask with O2 flow 5-10 L/min, PCO2 in group I ranged between 64.0 and 92.0 mmHg with a mean value of 77.24 ± 08.42 mmHg while in group II, PCO2 ranged between 60.0 and 92.0 mmHg with a mean value of 72.76 ± 09.04 mmHg with no statistical difference between both groups (p 0.076). Six to twelve hours from admission during NIV (before bronchoscopy), PCO2 in group I ranged
