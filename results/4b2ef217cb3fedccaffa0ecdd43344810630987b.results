In silico analysis of EPS8 protein for potential candidate peptides. To identify potential CTL epitopes of EPS8, the two algorithms SYFPEITHI and BIMAS were used to predict the potential peptides with high binding ability to the HLA-A*0201 molecule, which was a limiting step, resulting in a small number of peptides, and four peptides shared by those two algorithms were selected. The algorithm NetChop was then used to predict whether the peptides would be cleaved at the C-terminus, and only peptides with cleavage sites at the C-terminus were selected. Finally, five different algorithms were used to further confirm the selected peptides. Four 9-mer peptides with starting positions in the EPS8 protein sequence at 455, 276, 360 and 92, were finally selected ( Table I) . The positive and negative control peptides are also listed in the table. In vitro analysis of peptide affinity and binding stability to the HLA-A*0201 molecule. Evidence suggested that peptide affinity to MHC molecules is often correlated with its immunogenicity (26) . Therefore, the TAP-deficient and HLA-A*0201-positive cell line T2 was used to detect peptide affinity for the HLA-A*0201 molecule. When exogenous peptides were added, the MFI of T2 cells increased significantly (Fig. 1A) (Table I) , and no weak-affinity peptides were found in the four candidate peptides according to the definition of peptide affinity for the HLA-A*0201 molecule. In the BFA decay assay, with increasing time, the MFI of T2 cells in each group decreased (Fig. 1B) , and the DC 50 -value was calculated to reflect the peptide/MHC complex stability; the longer the time, the more stable the complex. Complex stability of peptide 455/HLA-A*0201 and peptide 360/HLA-A*0201 was the highest, as their DC 50 -values were all >8 h, followed by peptide 276 with DC 50 <8 h, while the stability of peptide 92/MHC complex was lowest with a DC 50 of 2-4 h (Table I) . EPS8 expression detection and phenotypic analysis of target cell lines. To identify candidate target cells, RT-qPCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of EPS8; furthermore, the protein expression of EPS8 was detected by western blot analysis. Among the eight cell lines, MCF-7, SW480, KG1a and K562 were EPS8-positive at the mRNA expression level ( Fig. 2A) and the protein expression level (Fig. 2B) . The HLA-A phenotype of the target cells was detected by direct immunofluorescence antibody staining and flow cytometric analysis. Of the eight cell lines, only MCF-7 and T2 were HLA-A*0201-positive ( Fig. 3A and B) .
