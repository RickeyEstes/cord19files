General characteristics of HCA-outbreaks. Since 1 January 2015 to 1 October 2018, 2,260 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections have been reported to WHO. Figure 1A illustrates the global epidemic curve since MERS was first identified in humans. Each peak is associated with a health care associated outbreak (colored lines, Fig. 1A ). From 2015, affected countries implemented systematic contact tracing and follow up (including laboratory testing), investigation and data collection of MERS suspect cases 41, 42 . In our analysis, a total of 423 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases from eleven distinct HCA-outbreaks during 2015-2017 were included ( Table 1 ). The eleven HCA-outbreaks varied in terms of duration, size and epidemiological profile ( Table 1, Fig. 1B) . The median number of total reported cases per outbreak was 10 (interquartile range, [IQR] 6-27), ranging from 5 to 186 cases. The median duration was 20 days (IQR 16-23), ranging from 10 to 57 days. Three outbreaks began with sporadic cases during the first two to five weeks of the outbreak, while the other eight displayed a rapid increase to the peak. The median time between onset of symptoms of the first reported case and the peak of incidence was 3 weeks (IQR 2-3.75), ranging from 2 to 6 weeks. The case fatality ratio (CFR) in outbreaks was 28% (116 reported deaths among 423 cases), compared with the global overall CFR of 35.5% (800 reported deaths among 2,254 cases reported as of 1 October 3 (Table 1) . During HCA outbreaks, CFR ranged from 0 to 75% (p < 0.01) and CFR was significantly lower among HCP MERS-CoV infections compared to non-HCP MERS-CoV infections (2% vs. 36% p < 0.01). Demographic and clinical characteristics. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the cases from HCA outbreaks included in our analyses are summarized in Table 1 . The median age was 54 (IQR, 36-65), and significantly varied by outbreak (p < 0.001). Five outbreaks had a median age <40 and the other 6 outbreaks had a median age â‰¥50. The majority of cases were male (57%, n = 243/423), and the sex ratio among cases differed significantly between outbreaks (p < 0.001). The overall proportion of HCP was 25% (n = 105/422). This proportion varied significantly by outbreak (p < 0.001), from 13% to 89% (Table 1) . Median age was significantly lower among HCP than non-HCP cases (35 IQR 29-46 vs 58 IQR 45-70, p < 0.001) and the proportion of females was higher among HCP than non-HCP (70% vs 33%, n = 422, p < 0.001). More than half (57%, n = 214/377) of cases had at least one underlying co-morbid condition (Table 1) , and this was significantly lower among females compared to males (46% vs 64%, respectively, n = 377, p < 0.001) and among HCP compared to non-HCP (13% vs 70%, n = 376, p < 0.001). Sixteen percent (n = 67/419) of cases were asymptomatic at time of reporting (Table 1 ). This proportion varied significantly between outbreaks ranging from 0% to 87% (n = 419, p < 0.001, Fig. 1C ). Median age of asymptomatic cases was 34 (IQR, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] , the majority of whom were females (70%, n = 47/67) and had no underlying co-morbid conditions (78%, n = 29/37). The proportion of HCP among asymptomatic infections was high (70%, n = 47/67), and the CFR was null. The median duration between symptom onset and case notification to WHO was 5 days (IQR 3-8). Risk factors associated with fatal outcome. In univariate analysis, fatal outcome was significantly associated with age (p < 0.001), presence of underlying comorbidities (p < 0.001), non-HCP status (p < 0.001), and male sex (p < 0.001, Estimation of time-varying reproduction number. At the start of each HCA outbreaks, the case reproduction number R (t) ranged from 1.0 (95% CI 0.7-1.3) to 5.7 (95% CI 3.0-9.0) ( Table 1 and Fig. 2 ). Estimates of R (t) dropped below 1 within 2 to 6 weeks from the first reported case in the outbreak (n = 11 outbreaks, median 3 weeks, IQR 2-4).
