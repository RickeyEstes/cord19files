Population Characteristics. The selected characteristics of patients with TB and control subjects in this study are shown in Table 1 . The study consists of 1,020 patients with TB and 1,020 control subjects. The male/female ratio of patients with TB was 1.10, and the mean age was 43.2 years (± SD, 14.9) ( Table 1) . For the 1,020 controls, the male/female ratio was 1.02, and the mean age was 44.3 years (± SD, 15.0). Controls were comparable with cases with regard to mean age and gender (all P values > 0.05). The genotyping results are presented in Table 2 . The observed genotype frequencies for the four polymorphisms conformed to the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls (all P values > 0.05). Consistent with the previous reports 11, 24 , the codon 52 (A/D) and 57 (A/C) variants were not observed in our ethnic northern Chinese individuals. The frequencies of variant alleles L, X, Q and B in the controls were 48.7%, 14.5%, 13.2% and 14.0%, respectively, similar to those reported in other southern or northern Chinese subpopulations 11,24 . Polymorphisms and Risk of TB in this study. On the basis of unconditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for known confounding factors including age and gender, a statistically significant association with the susceptibility to TB was observed with the condon 54 variant. Subjects homozygous and heterozygous for variant B allele (i.e. B/B plus A/B genotype) had an increased susceptibility to TB compared to those homozygous for the wild-type A allele (OR = 1.57, 95% CI 1.30-1.91, P = 1.3 × 10 −6 ; simulation number = 10,000,000; Table 2 ). The association was still significant even after correction for multiple comparisons. None of the remaining three variants (H/L, Y/X and P/Q) were found to be significantly associated with susceptibility to TB. Logistic regression models including random effects obtained results similar to those obtained in models including fixed-effects (Table 2 ). In addition to single SNP analysis, haplotype analysis was also performed for the MBL2 gene. We identified 5 haplotypes (HYPA, LYPB, LXPA, LYQA and LYPA) using the PHASE program, with the frequencies of these haplotypes greater than 5% in both cases and controls. The frequencies of these 5 haplotypes in controls ranged from 51.3% (HYPA haplotype) to 7.0% (LYPA haplotype), similar to those reported in other Asian populations of Japanese and Vietnamese 16 . In haplotype analysis, only LYPB showed a significant association with increased risk of TB (OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.27-1.87; P = 4.2 × 10 −6 ; global haplotype association P = 3.5 × 10 −5 ; simulation number = 10,000,000; Cases are patients with tuberculosis. Comparisons of gender and age distributions between cases and controls were performed by use of the one-sided χ 2 test. Differences of mean age between cases and controls were analyzed by use of an unpaired t test. Table 3 ). Furthermore, we grouped cases and controls by harboring haplotypes associated with high, medium, or low MBL expression 25 , to evaluate whether haplotype pairs associated with various levels of MBL expression were associated with susceptibility to TB risk. In 1,020 patients with TB, 618 (60.6%) were in the high expression group, 298 (29.2%) in the medium group, and 104 (10.2%) in the low group. In 1,020 controls, this distribution was 723 (70.9%), 234 (22.9%) and 63 (6.2%), respectively (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.29-1.90, P = 1.4 × 10 −6 , with adjustment for age and gender; simulation number = 10,000,000; Table 2 ), implicating that the individuals bearing medium or low expression haplotype pairs had an increased risk of TB and that the MBL deficiency might play a potential role in susceptibility to TB. The associations between the four MBL2 polymorphisms and susceptibility to TB were further examined with stratification by age and gender, with no differences observed for MBL2 polymorphisms individually or in haplotype between stratums (all P values > 0.05, test for homogeneity).
