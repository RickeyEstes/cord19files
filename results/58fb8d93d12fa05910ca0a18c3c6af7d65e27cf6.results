Of the 40 experts that agreed to participate, a total of 32 completed the study, with an overall response rate of 80% ( Table 2) . The major finding of the study was consensus of 62 specific competencies. The remaining 7 items that reached consensus concerned knowledge of organizational activities and administrative routines (items 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 29, 68) . There was consensus concerning the importance of daily emergency care nursing competencies such as basic first aid, and triage, as well as more specific and advanced competencies. The specific and advanced competencies encompassed special populations and rare events such as biological/chemical events and proper actions regarding these incidents. In addition, competencies concerning the incident command system including disaster preparedness plans and decision making were seen as essential disaster medicine competencies for ED registered nurses (Table 3) .
