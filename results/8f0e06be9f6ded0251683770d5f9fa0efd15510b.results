The US labor force is composed of 136 million persons, 6 million of whom are healthcare workers with potential patient contact (16, 17) . Approximately half of these are registered or licensed practical nurses. An additional 3 million persons work in healthcare-support occupations and may have patient contact, including nursing aides, orderlies, and attendants (1.3 million); home health aides (560,000); and medical or dental assistants (600,000) (16, 17) . These estimates do not include persons without routine patient contact employed in such occupations as healthcare administrators, medical secretaries, and other clerical staff (16, 17) . From 2000 to 2002, the Department of Labor reported an annual average of 77 healthcare worker deaths with the "industry" categorization versus 93 deaths with the "occupation" category (12) . Deaths from transportation accidents and assaults and violent acts accounted for most. To address the latter problem, NIOSH recently published the monograph Violence: Occupational Hazards in Hospitals (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/2002-101.html). Specific data are reported for some but not all healthcare worker occupations in the "occupation" classification ( Table 1) . For example, an annual average of 10 doctors, 18 registered nurses, and 18 health technologists/technicians died. In addition, statistics maintained by the National EMS (Emergency Medical Services) Memorial Service show that â‰ˆ12 emergency medical service workers are killed annually, including 13 in 2002 (18) . The EMS deaths are not specifically noted in the Department of Labor statistics; therefore, whether these deaths are included in the overall number is uncertain.
