SAFV was detected at low concentrations upon repeated measurements (ct value = 39) in one of the 150 deceased individuals. This patient was a 2-year, 7-month-old previously healthy boy who died suddenly and unexpected after one day of slight fever. Using direct VP2 genotyping analysis, we determined the identified SAFV to be SAFV genotype 2. SAFV was also detectable in frozen blood (ct-value 30) and respiratory secretion (ct-value 22) while the cerebrospinal fluid was negative. As the present case was a forensic autopsy case routine examinations for other pathogens were performed prior to this study in order to establish the cause of death. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and non-hemolytic streptococci were isolated from lung tissue while enterovirus was detected in respiratory secretion. The results are shown in Table 1 . Histological examination revealed acute inflammation in the myocardium (Figs. 1 and 2) and in the lung tissue (Fig. 3) while the other examined organs revealed no signs of inflammation or other diseases. Due to the inflammatory alterations and the detection of enterovirus in the respiratory secretion, analysis for SAFV and enteroviruses was also performed on FFPE lung tissue, which despite repeated trials was negative for both viruses.
