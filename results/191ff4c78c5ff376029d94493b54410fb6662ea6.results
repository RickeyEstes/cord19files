Of the 738 passengers on the 2 fl ights, 319 (43%) responded to a questionnaire; 143 (18%) of passengers could not be contacted. Cross-checking of mandatory notifi cations of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 against all passengers on both fl ights found 2 additional pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection cases while also confi rming symptom data on survey responses. Contact tracing by public health authorities found 5 additional passengers with ILI who had negative test results for pandemic (H1N1) 2009. No passengers who had positive test results for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had underlying health conditions considered to make them more susceptible to infl uenza; however, 5 of 32 passengers reporting ILI postfl ight had >1 potential concurrent conditions (1 each of obesity, diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, asthma, and chronic lung disease). Limited analysis demonstrated that the concurrent condition did not make these persons more susceptible than other passengers to contracting an ILI. Combined results from the survey and disease notifi cation data sources identifi ed 8 passengers who had an ILI at the beginning of the 14-hour fl ight. For 4 of these passengers, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection was later laboratory confi rmed; for 1, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection was confi rmed as negative; 3 passengers were not tested. ILI symptoms developed in 2 other passengers during the fl ight, and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was confi rmed in both. Twenty-four passengers were identifi ed as developing ILI symptoms <7 days after arrival in Australia. Of these, 2 passengers had laboratory-confi rmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection, 15 had illness confi rmed as negative for the pandemic virus, and 7 were not tested. Most passengers experienced onset of symptoms <3 days after fl ight arrival; however, 6 passengers did not state exact date of disease onset ( Figure 1 ). Self-reporting of symptoms from passengers did not distinguish between different causes of ILI (Table) . Fever was reported from 4 of 8 passengers with confi rmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009, 7 of 16 passengers whose ILI was confi rmed negative for pandemic (H1N1) 2009, and 2 of 10 passengers with ILI who were not tested. Two or fewer symptoms, not including fever, were reported for 3 of the 8 passengers with confi rmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009, 7 for those testing negative for pandemic (H1N1) 2009, and 6 with ILI who were not tested.
