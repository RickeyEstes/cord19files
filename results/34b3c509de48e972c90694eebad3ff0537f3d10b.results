Unbiased metagenomic sequencing allows detection of any potential pathogens in a sample. We performed metagenomic analysis of all sequencing reads from this patient's CSF and identified enterovirus; no other pathogen, including mumps virus, was found. We assembled a near-full-length enterovirus genome (7212 base pair [bp], median depth of coverage 10Ã—), which included the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) and near-complete coding region, but not the 3' end (21 bp) of the coding region or the 3'-UTR. By comparing this genome to published enterovirus genomes, we found that this virus belongs to echovirus subgroup 30 ( Figure 1A ), a member of the highly diverse enterovirus B species group, which includes most echoviruses, coxsackie B viruses, and coxsackie A9 virus [3] . Echovirus 30 has not previously been associated with orchitis, but other enteroviruses have, including echovirus 6 [4] and coxsackieviruses A9 and B [5, 6] . Therefore, we investigated whether the virus we identified was a recombinant between echovirus 30 and a subgroup that is more commonly associated with orchitis, because recombination between enteroviruses occurs frequently [3] . We first examined the VP1 gene, which encodes a capsid protein that interacts with host cell receptors and may therefore confer tropism for specific tissue such as the testes. In phylogenetic analysis of the VP1 gene, our virus again clustered with echovirus 30, rather than a subgroup more commonly associated with orchitis ( Figure 1B ). In the 4 kb at the 3' end of the genome, we observed similarity between our genome and coxsackievirus B5 (Supplementary Figure 1A) but did not observe specific evidence of recombination in this region (Supplementary Text and Supplementary Figure 1B) .
