Introduction: High-flow oxygen therapy (HFNC) has shown a benefit for the prognosis of patients with hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (ARF), while noninvasive ventilation (NIV) remains debated in this indication. We evaluated the effect of HFNC on alveolar recruitment and lung volumes in hypoxemic ARF compared to NIV and facial mask (FM). Patients and methods: A prospective cross-over physiological study was conducted. Eligible patients had to present a hypoxemic ARF due to pneumonia requiring HFNC and or NIV according to ICU physician. Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and underlying respiratory disease were excluded. Each patient was investigated with the Pulmovista ® (Dräger, Lübeck, Germany) device and underwent 15 min periods of HFNC or NIV in a randomized order, interspersed with 15 min periods of FM used as reference. The primary endpoint was the comparison of global and regional end-expiratory electrical lung impedance (EELI) between NIV and HFNC. Secondary endpoints were the comparison, between the 3 techniques, of lung volumes (global and regional tidal variations (TV), respiratory parameters, hemodynamic tolerance, dyspnea and comfort. Results: NIV 1.1 ). Global and regional TV increased under NIV compared to HFNC (p < 0.05) or FM (p < 0.05), while HFNC did not modify TV over FM. NIV significantly improved the SpO2 FiO2 ratio compared to HFNC (p = 0.001) (fig 1.2) . HFNC significantly reduced respiratory rate vs FM (p = 0.04) but not NIV. No difference was found for dyspnea score between the 3 techniques. Patient comfort was similar between HFNC and FM but decreased with NIV. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a similar benefit of HFNC and NIV on alveolar recruitment with the settings used, as compared to FM. By contrast to HFNC and despite a better oxygenation, NIV also increases lung volumes which may contribute to its potentially deleterious effect during hypoxemic ARF leading to the recent concept of Patient Self Inflicted Lung Injury or P-SILI (Brochard L et al. AJRCCM 2017 + 195-438-42) . Introduction: Ventilatory Acquired Pneumonia (VAP) is one of the main nosocomial infection in adult ICU. Only one prospective multicenter study performed during six months in 16 PICUs of the US has prospectively described pediatric VAP. We design the INCIPAVE study to report the occurrence of VAP in european PICUs, focusing on patients, risk factors (RF), micro-organisms involved, diagnostic tools and antibiotics used. The first aim of this study was to calculate the incidence of VAP. Patients and methods: Multicenter prospective cohort study from 03/04/2017 to 03/04/2018 including all patients mechanically ventilated (MV) at least once in eight PICUs, one in the Netherlands and seven in France. VAP was defined using the 2015 CDC criteria, applied during PICU stays, excluding the 48 h preceeding and following PICU. Patients were described on admission and main RF ever tested in the medical litterature were daily included by a pediatric intensivist of each PICU in an electronic database on a securized dedicated website. The Ethics Committee of the French Society of Intensive Care approved the study, which has been declared to the CNIL and recorded on Clinical-Trials.org. All parents were individually informed by a dedicated sheet. Descriptive data are reported as number (%) or medians [first-third quartiles]. Incidence was calculated as the number of VAP for 1000 days of MV. Results: These results are based on declarative information reported in the INCIPAVE database during its first opening on September 2018, before cleaning. During one year, 2047 episodes of MV were included in 1856 patients (26.5 months [6 + 92], 12kgs [6.4 + 23.22], 56% of males). Main reasons for admission to PICU were post-operative care (35.1%) and respiratory (23.7%), neurological (17.1%) or circulatory (12.2%) failures. PIM-2 score was 2.8% [1.3 + 7.5] with an observed mortality of 10.9%. PELOD-2 score on day-1 was 5 [4.7] . Patients were ventilated via uncuffed tubes in 19.6% of cases (7.8% of tracheostomy). A total of 158 VAP was declared during 11685 days of MV. The incidence of VAP was 13.5 1000 days of MV (IC95% -[11.4 + 15.6]). Conclusion: This incidence of VAP in INCIPAVE study is higher than the incidence reported recently by Gupta (7.0 1000 days of MV) (1) . New analyses are planned after cleaning of the database, including a special reading of each case of VAP. On the day of PE diagnosis, early group also presented with higher SOFA scoring (p < 0.001) and higher infection rate (p = 0.005). Biological assessment revealed lower platelet levels (p = 0.001) and lower P F ratio in the early group (p = 0.008). Our study showed that early PE was associated with more transfusions (p = 0.002) and surgical treatment measures (p = 0.023). The incidence of long bone fractures in lower extremities was higher in those with early PE compared with the other patients (p = 0.039 Introduction: Bag mask ventilation is the most spread technic for ventilation for cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) despite several adverse effects. Gastric gas insufflation may favor lung regurgitation and as result occurrence of aspiration pneumonia (1). We hypothesized that continuous chest compression (CC) may limit the risk of high tidal volume and gastric inflation compared to a 30-2 interrupted CC strategy. The aim of this experimental study was assess the impact of different CC ventilation strategies on gastric inflation and ventilation during a 6 min prolonged simulated CPR. Patients and methods: 5 Thiel Embalmed Cadavers (TEC) from a donation program of the Université du Quebec Trois-Rivieres (CER-14-201-08-03.17) were ventilated 30 min to recruit lungs. (2) . Flow and Airway Pressure were measured at the airway opening (Acq-Knowledge software Biopac©). A surgical gastrostomy was performed through a 5 cm midline laparotomy to introduce a cuffed tracheal tube (size 6) into the stomach cavity + this tube was connected to a Wright spirometer to measure cumulated gastric inflated volume. Experimental protocol-3 strategies were randomly applied during 6 min on each cadaver. 1. 30-2 with Interrupted Chest Compressions (ICC 30-2). Two successive bag insufflations after interrupting CC every 30 CC + . 2. 30-2 with Continuous Chest Compressions (CCC 30-2). Same CC ventilation ratio than in the first strategy but without interrupting CC. 3. Continuous CC with 1 bag insufflation every 6 s (CCC 10 min). Before each strategy the stomach was completely emptied through the gastrostomy tube, and the order of each strategy experimented were randomized for each cadaver. Results: 5 cadavers were analyzed (mean age 75 ± 8 years, 60% female, PBW 56 ± 10 kg). Expired bag tidal volume averaged during the 6 min long period was 319 ± 165 ml during (ICC 30-2), 341 ± 142 ml during (CCC 30-2) and 277 ± 103 ml (CCC 10 min). Cumulated gastric inflated volume was significantly higher during (ICC 30-2) compared to CCC strategies (fig)-5.9L 6 min (ICC 30-2) + 2.1L 6 min (CCC 30-2) and 2.24L 6 min (CCC 10 min) (p < 0.005). Conclusion: Compared to the recommended (ICC 30-2) strategy, continuous chest compression significantly reduced cumulated gastric inflation. Interestingly, CCC did not affect ventilation actually delivered during CPR. The optimal ratio between chest compression en ventilation during continuous chest compression remains open to discussion. Introduction: Cardiac events are often seen in acute cerebral palsy, and they would be an indicator of poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to clarify the heart-brain interaction in terms of incidents and repercussions on the morbidity and mortality of cerebral palsy patients. Patients and methods: It was a prospective study, over 6 months, including consecutively all the acute cerebral palsy patients, initially admitted to the vital emergency room, and having benefited from a systematic cardiac assessment, namely an ECG, an echocardiogram and a troponin assay during the 24 h. Patients transferred from another hospital and or having a cardiac check-up after 24 h were excluded. The epidemiological, clinical, paraclinical, therapeutic and evolutionary parameters were studied. A univariate statistical study was carried out to deduce the prognostic factors of early mortality (< 48 h) among cardiac assessment components (p < 0.05). Results: 76 patients were included, with an average age of 56.16 ± 13.56 years, and sex ratio 1.23 (42H 34F). The diagnoses related to the cerebro-lesion were-ischemic stroke (28 cases 36%), severe head trauma (24 cases 32%), hemorrhagic stroke (20 cases 26%), severe meningitis (4 cases 6%). The cardiac events observed were-an electrical anomaly in 19 patients (25%), an increase in troponin in 13 patients (17%) and an echocardiographic anomaly in 7 patients (9%). The distribution of cardiac events by type of brain injury is shown in Table 1 . The early mortality rate (< 48 h) was 16% (12 deaths)-6 hemorrhagic stroke, 3 ischemic stroke, 3 severe head trauma, and no severe meningitis. The prognostic value of various cardiac events in cerebral palsy patients by type of aggression is shown in Table 1 . Discussion: Our study did not show a statistically significant difference in terms of early mortality according to the presence or absence of one or more cardiac incidents. On the other hand, very important NPVs have been noted, all brain lesions combined. Conclusion: The absence of cardiac events in cerebral palsy patients would favor a better early evolution. This finding should be confirmed by a broader study. We recommend performing a cardiac checkup in any cerebral palsy patient during the first 24 h. Introduction: Doppler-based resistive index (RI) and semi-quantitative evaluation of renal perfusion using colour-Doppler (SQP) have been suggested as potential predictors of AKI occurrence in ICU patients without renal dysfunction (1). These results are however limited to preliminary data (1). This study aimed at evaluating the performance of RI and SQP to predict AKI within 3 days in critically-ill patients without overt AKI. Patients and methods: Post-hoc analysis of a multicentre prospectively collected dataset. Adult patients without cardiac arrhythmia and requiring mechanical ventilation were included. Patients with severe chronic renal dysfunction or known renal artery stenosis were excluded. AKI was defined according both urinary output and serum creatinine criteria of the KDIGO definition. Renal Doppler was performed at study inclusion. Results are reported in n (%) or median (IQR). Adjusted factors associated with AKI development were assessed using mixed logistic regression model taking centre as random effect. Results: Overall, of the 351 patients included in this study, 118 had no AKI at study inclusion and were ultimately included in the post hoc analysis. Half of the patients were of male gender (55.6%; n = 66) and median age was 58 [IQR 44-67]. In addition to mechanical ventilation, 47 patients (39.8%) required vasopressors, and 46 (39.0%) had a sepsis at inclusion. Median LOD score was 7 [IQR 5-9]. Overall, 34 patients developed AKI during the first 3 days of ICU stay (28.8%). Semi-quantitative perfusion score (ranging from 3-full perfusion to 0 no perfusion) was 2 [2-3] and 2 [1] [2] [3] respectively in patients with and without AKI at day 3 (P = 0.06). Doppler-based resistive index was 0.64 [0.57-0.70] and 0.67 [0.62-0.70] respectively in patients with and without AKI at day 3 (P = 0.18; figure) . Area under ROC curve in predicting AKI within 3 days was 0.60 (0.49-0.71) for SQP and 0.58 (0.47-0.60) for RI. After adjustment for confounders, neither SQP (OR 0.58; 95%CI 0.31-1.10) nor Doppler-based RI (OR 29.15; 95%CI 0.12-703) were associated with AKI at day 3. Most data about platelet transfusions in the ICU have been obtained from general cohorts with peripheral thrombocytopenia and ongoing active bleeding or subjected to invasive procedures. In patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia, the management of platelet transfusions remains somewhat empirical, derived from studies performed in hematology patients under stable clinical conditions. We herein described and analysed the determinants of post-transfusion platelet increments in cancer patients with hypoproliferative thrombocytopenia in the ICU. : heighty height patient were included. Candiduria was found in 25 patients (28.4%) and 13 patients had candiduria density > 105 CFU/mL. C. albicans was found in 13 patients. The mean interval between admission and the onset of candiduria was 11.9 ± 16.42 days. Seven patients (9%) developed candidemia + from whom 5 had a concomitant candiduria. The diagnosis of invasive candidiasis was made in 14 patients (9%). The risk factors to develop invasive candidiasis in patients with candiduria were-renal failure (p = 0.17), candida score > 2.5 points (p = 0.04) and Pittet index > 0.5 (p = 0.01). By logistic regression, only renal failure was the independent factor associated with invasive candidiasis in patients with candiduria (p = 0.02, OR 17.6, 95% CI 1. 5-203.8 ). An association candiduria > 105 CFU ml and a Pittet index > 0, 5 were significantly associated with invasive candidiasis (P = 0.04). The mortality rates were at 37.5%. Conclusion: Candiduria > 105 CFU ml in the intensive care patients with several risk factors can predict invasive candidiasis. So a permanent mycological surveillance is widely recommended in order to make the early diagnosis and to start appropriate antifungal therapy. The data about epidemiology, patient significant clinical data, surgery, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, central venous catheter, urinary catheter, arterial catheter, total parenteral nutrition, leucopenia, neutropenia, previous antimicrobial therapy or prophylaxis were collected. Results: Twenty-three per cent of the 164 patients enrolled in our study, had fungal infection (25 cases) or fungal colonization (13 patients). Median score was 3 [2] [3] . Candida albicans was isolated in 60% of infections cases and 46.1% in colonization cases. Candiduria was detected in 40% and candidaemia was observed in 52% of patients. Patients who had developed fungal infections had central line insertion in (92%), prolonged length of stay (76%), prolonged antibiotic therapy (68%), use of corticosteroids (36%), and neutropenia (12%). Fluconazole was the first line used antifungal treatment (n = 23). Amphotericine B was used in three patients. Median hospital stay was 27 [18 -49] days. Multivariate analysis revealed that catecholamine use was associated with fungal infection and colonization (p = 0.04). Conclusion: Fungal infection and colonization were frequent in our population but only use of catecholamine appeared as a risk factor. : Admission blood lactate was below 1.5 mmol/L in 88 828 (10.6%) patients and potassium levels were above 5.5 mmol/L in 93 828 (11.2%). Patients with hyperkalemia presented more frequently with initial non-shockable rhythm and experienced longer collapse before resuscitation. At ICU admission, patients with hyperkalemia presented with deeper acidemia (7.1 [6.95-7.18] vs 7.23 [7.13-7 .32], p < 0.001), higher lactatemia (7.3 [3.7-12.5] vs 5.1 [2.5-9], p < 0.001) and higher serum creatinine level (159 [102-230] vs 103 [77-137], p < 0.001). Following multivariate linear regression, kalemia was only associated with initial non-shockable rhythm (β = -0.34, 95%CI = -0.58 ± 0.11), higher creatininemia (β = 0.003, 95%CI = 0.002, 0.004) and elevated PaCO2 (β = 0.01, 95%CI = 0.005 + 0.02) but not elevation of lactate levels. Indeed, a statistical negative trend between potassium blood level and lactatemia was observed (β = -0.02, p = 0.07). Sensitivity analyses performed on patients without AKI and CRD showed similar results. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the absence of an association between blood lactate and potassium levels during acidosis with severe acidemia in the successfully resuscitated OHCA patient setting. This phenomenon appears to be independent of AKI. Our results suggest that kaliemia are in fact strongly linked to arterial PaCO2. Introduction: Mitral velocity (E wave velocity and A wave velocity), and early diastolic mitral annulus velocity E' assessed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) are correlated to pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) in cardiologic patients. These parameters are dependent on loading conditions, modified by mechanical ventilation and the use of catecholamine. In ICU ventilated patients receiving catecholamine, E A ratio and E' velocity has not been evaluated. Patients and methods: This observational prospective study included 12 consecutives patients (mean age = 61 ± 15.3 years) with septic shock and ARDS. All patients were treated with catecholamines (mean dose (mg h) = 3.4 ± 3.0) and ventilated (mean FIO2 (%) = 0.8 ± 0.3, mean tidal volume (mL kg) = 6.2 ± 0.5). A volume expansion was performed with Ringer lactate solution at the discretion of clinician. Echocardiographic, Doppler examinations and hemodynamic measurements were repeated after volume expansion. We obtained 32 measurements. Doppler mitral inflow and TDI mitral annulus velocities were determined and compared with PAOP measured by a Swan-Ganz catheter. All TTE parameters were analyzed off-line by an independent operator, blinded to clinical history and PAOP values. Results: Fluid challenge increased the ScVO2 (from 73.3 ± 10.1 to 76.0 ± 7.8%) and PAOP (from 11.2 ± 3.0 to 12.8 ± 3.4 mmHg). However, there was no difference in cardiac index (from 4.0 ± 2.1 to 4.0 ± 2.0 l min m 2 ). There was no significant correlation between PAOP and the E wave (Beta 4.64 IC 95% [-0.18, 9.47 Introduction: The central venous catheter (CVC) allows to infuse several drugs simultaneously in intensive care units thanks to the use of Y-set infusion lines. Many constraints are encountered in the management of pediatric populations-limited infusion rates according to the age of children, maximum infusion volumes in relation to their weight. Indeed, a limitation of the water supplies has to be performed because of the hyper-permeabilization of the vessels in this population. So, optimization of infusion sets is therefore essential to improve and secure this support. Our main objective was to evaluate infusion practices and to identify optimization suggestions. Patients and methods: Observation of infusion lines on CVC were conducted for 3 months (December 2017 to March 2018) in the pediatric resuscitation department. A restitution of these observations was carried out in the unit to form a working group to optimize the infusion setups. Several proposals for perfusion set will be discussed. Results: Conducted interviews with nurses lasted approximately 5 to 10 min according to a grid composed of multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions. 32 infusion lines were observed and 14 nurses interviewed (34% of the nurses staff ). This observation concerned 14 children under 1 year old, 12 children between 1 and 6 years old and 6 children over 6 years old. 37% of CVC were placed in jugular vein, 25% in femoral, 31% in subclavian and 7% other. There were 50% trilumen, 38% bilumen and 12% monolumen CVC. Only 51.9 ± 0.2% of available ports were used on infusion lines. CVC dressings were changed every 4 days or when they were soiled or unstuck. 71% of nurses declared problems with the dressing-dressings are too bigs for the youngers, inadapted for burned children, not yet sticky for those who drool. 79% of nurses have encountered drug incompatibilities during infusion through CVC but all surveyed nurses knew the existence of the unit's drug incompatibilities table. Conclusion: The evaluation of nurses practices highlighted a good knowledge of the types of infusion lines compared to the recommendations. However, efforts must be made to rationalize the number of lines available on the infusion set by integrating infusion devices with optimized geometry to limit drug incompatibilities. A discussion with the medical team about sizes of catheters according to the child weight will be engaged. Smaller dressings have been referenced in the unit and a modification in dessings change frequency was considered at 7 days. Introduction: Malnutrition is prevalent in children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Inadequacy energy intake is known to be a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in critically children. SFAR (Société Française d'Anesthésie et de Réanimation) published in 2014 European nutritional guidelines. This study aimed to evaluate nutritional practices in a French PICU by comparing energy and protein intake using SFAR's recommendations and 2017 American recommendations and to identify risk factors of inadequate energy intake using SFAR's recommendations. Patients and methods: This study was retrospective in one PICU in a University's Hospital from 2014 to 2016. Children aged one month to eighteen years old who were receiving an exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) were included. Patient hospitalized less than 48 h, patient fed exclusively by oral or parenteral route were excluded. Individual energy and protein intake were calculated for each day and compared to SFAR's recommendations. Satisfactory energy intake was considered to be followed if equal to or greater than 90% of SFAR's recommended intake. Two groups were constituted and compared to identify risk factors between patients following or not the SFAR's recommendations-"optimal EN group" -children who received more than 90% of energy recommendation maintained for a least half of the ICU stay and "no optimal EN" if children didn't. Results: 418 patients were involved in this study. Malnutrition at admission occurred in 151 patients (36.6%). Average energy intake were 47.5 kcal kg day (IC95% = 27-62) that represented 75% and 87.8% of energy estimated intake by SFAR's recommendations and Schofield equation respectively. Energy intake received was closer to intake estimated using Schofield equation than those recommended by SFAR (Figure 1 ). SFAR's recommendations were respected for 43% of patients. The 2017 American recommendations were taken on board for 80% of patients. Average protein intake were 1.2 g kg day (IC95% = 0.6-1.5) that represented 67% of intake recommended by SFAR. 88 patients (21%) had an "optimal EN". The median time to initiate EN was longer in "no optimal EN" group. Vasopressors were identified to be a risk factor of no meeting the SFAR's recommendations (OR = 5.34, IC95% = 1-28.4, p = 0.04). Conclusion: Only 43% of patients respected SFAR's recommendations. Vasopressor was a risk factor of no meeting SFAR's recommendations. The 2017 American recommendations using Schofield equation were respected in 80% of patients. An enteral feeding protocol could reduce the median time to initiate an EN support. intolerance (HI) to depletion for children don't exist to our knowledge. Another study showed that calibrated abdominal compression (CAC) was able to predict fluid responsiveness in children with acute circulatory failure. Patients and methods: The primary objective of our study was to determine if the variation of stroke volume index (SVi) during CAC -our test index-can predict HI to depletion defined as a decrease of 15% of cardiac output after depletion of at least 10 mL kg in children with FO. We conducted a prospective non-interventional study in a french teaching hospital with a cardiologic ICU. All patients under eight years old who might be suffering from FO and who needed depletion with diuretics were selected. We only included those who had urinated more that 10 mL kg in less that two hours. We assessed the SVi with the Aortic Flow Velocity Integral by transthoracic echocardiography before depletion, during the CAC and after depletion. We recorded other hemodynamic parameters considered as secondary outcomes. Results: 47 patients were included after cardiac surgery. Only six had a decreased cardiac output by more than 15% after depletion. Introduction: In 2016 an international task force changed the definitions of sepsis and septic shock in adults, using an organ failure score named the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). The concept of new and progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (NPMODS), corresponding to organ dysfunction aggravation, has been proposed as proxy of mortality in some critical diseases. Many criteria exist to define these organ dysfunctions-the Proulx criteria, the Goldstein criteria, the Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD2) score, and the Pediatric SOFA score. The aim of the study was to compare these four definitions with each other, to find the best definition of NPMODS that could be used as surrogate outcome in the pediatric septic shock therapeutic trials. Patients and methods: This is a retrospective observational study, from January 2011 to December 2016, in a single PICU. Inclusion criteria were age < 18 years, hospitalization in PICU for septic shock (2005 definition). The primary outcome measure was PICU mortality. The secondary outcome was an evaluation of morbidity-mortality using the evolution of the Pediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC). Results: 149 patients were included. Mean age was 5 years (± 5.5 years), 16 patients (10.7%) were less than 28 days old. 18 patients died (12.1% of fatality rate). 44 patients (29.5%) had a significant worsening delta-POPC. The most common causes of septic shock were meningitis or meningoencephalitis (15.8%), purpura fulminans (15.1%), and intraabdominal infection (15.1%). Patients developed NPMODS in 26.2% according to Proulx criteria, 30.9% according to Goldstein criteria, 30.2% for PELOD2, and 28.9% for pSOFA. The four definitions used to define NPMODS were significantly associated with mortality and delta-POPC (p < 0.001). The deceased patients did not have scores that worsened in the first five days, but the scores did not improve. On the contrary, the scores of survivors improved within the first 5 days whatever the definition used. Conclusion: NPMODS definition could be a surrogate outcome of mortality, usable in pediatric septic shock therapeutic trials, whether using the Proulx, Goldstein, PELOD2 or pSOFA criteria. However, this definition only considers the onset or the aggravation of organ dysfunction. Further studies would be needed to create and validate an alternative definition, which incorporates the notion of non-improvement of organ dysfunction over time, which would better reflect the natural course of the most severe patients with pediatric septic shock. Introduction: Electrical velocimetry (EV) is a non-invasive method of continuous left cardiac output monitoring. The main objective was to validate EV by investigating the agreement in cardiac output measurements performed by EV and trans-thoracic echocardiography. Patients and methods: We conducted a prospective single-center pilot study in the 8 beds pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). We included children from 28 days to 10 years, with hemodynamic instability or circulatory failure, and excluded children with congenital heart disease or impossible chest access impossible. We simultaneously measured cardiac output by EV and echocardiography. Agreement, bias and precision of the measurements were analyzed by the Bland-Altman method. Bias < 10% and percentage error < 30% were considered clinically acceptable. Parameters of contractility (ICON for EV and Left ventricular ejection fraction) and preload dependance (Stroke Volume Variation SVV for EV and variation in aortic blood flow velocity in echocardiography) were compared. Results: 10 patients were included (median age 3.5 years [0. , median weight 17.25 kg [5.36-28] ), and 38 measurements were performed and analyzed. The bias and percentage error for cardiac output measurement were 0.46% and 21.73%, respectively. There was no correlation between the parameters assessing contractility (left ventricular ejection fraction in echocardiography and contractility index in EV) (r = 0.14, p = 0.38), or those evaluating the preload dependence (variation in aortic blood flow velocity in echocardiography and SVV in EV) (r = 0.193, p = 0.244).
