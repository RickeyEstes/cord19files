Distribution of sensitizer in materials and optical transmittance of sensitizer incorporated films HDPE sheets containing varying concentrations of sensitizers were subject to examination by confocal laser microscopy. Samples were first viewed in reflectance mode, in order to provide images of the material surfaces. No distinct visual alterations to the polymer surface were seen upon addition of TPP to the HDPE mixture, however, inspection of TMPyP incorporated HDPE appears to show some aggregates at the material surface; there also appears to be some modification to the polymer surface upon addition of the higher concentrations of MB and TBO, likely due to the presence of aggregates at the material surface, compared with the relatively smooth surface of the pure HDPE, as illustrated in Figure 1 . The use of fluorescence imaging allowed visualization of the sensitizer throughout the materials. At both 0.40% and 0.05% TPP loading, an even fluorescence signal was observed on the surfaces of the samples, indication that the photosensitizer has been well mixed with the polymer and has produced a largely homogenous surface, as displayed in Figure 2 . However, fluorescence imaging of the surface of TMPyP incorporated HDPE revealed incomplete mixing of the photosensitizer with the material, at both the 0.05% and 0.40% concentrations ( Figure 2) . As fluorescence imaging of materials containing TBO and MB was not possible, optical microscope images were collected and revealed a relatively even colouring with minimal alteration in the surface compared to HDPE; however, the images show small UV-visible spectroscopic analysis of photosensitizer-loaded samples was performed to determine the transmittance of light through the sample, in order to give a measure of optical clarity and transparency. The mean transmittance of pure polyethylene film, across the visible range (390 nm-750 nm), was 68%. Compared with this, the transmittance of low concentration porphyrin-incorporated materials (0.05% TPP and TMPyP) was approximately 49%, in both cases. Samples containing 0.4% TMPyP exhibited transmittance of 37%, while 0.4% TPP reduced transmittance to 33%. For phenothiazine incorporated films, the transmittance of low concentration materials (0.05% TBO and MB) was approximately 46% and 44%, respectively. Samples containing 0.40% MB exhibited transmittance of 28%, while 0.40% TBO reduced transmittance to 14%.
