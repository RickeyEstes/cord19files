Between June 2010 and May 2011, 70 participants were enrolled (Table I) . Five subjects did not return for visit 3 and were not included in the analysis. The mean age was 11 AE 3.2 years, 67% were male, 88% were atopic (presence of !1 positive skin test result to an aeroallergen), and 31% were obese. Fortythree percent of the enrolled children were Caucasian, 38% were Hispanic, and 18% were African American. Fourteen percent carried the diagnosis of mild-persistent, 67% moderatepersistent, and 18% severe-persistent asthma. Seventy-five percent of the subjects were on inhaled GC therapy (15% on inhaled GC monotherapy and 60% on combination inhaled GC/long-acting beta-agonist therapy). More than 40% reported having an ED visit for acute asthma in the past year, requiring systemic steroids in the last 6 months, and having a history of hospital admissions for acute asthma. Review of medication use at baseline (visit 1) compared with the time of exacerbation (visit 2) found no significant difference in the percentage of study participants on inhaled GC therapy alone or in combination with a long-acting beta-agonist, nor were significant differences found in the inhaled GC dose at visit 1 compared with visit 2. In addition, both FENO level and lung function were in the normal range at visit 1 (geometric mean FENO level ¼ 20.7 ppb; Four of the 70 subjects were missing recorded calendar dates for their visits and were excluded from the mixed models (total of 66 subjects for FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC, and FEF 25-75 models). In addition, 2 subjects were missing both baseline and follow-up FENO measurements and 1 subject was missing race information (total of 63 subjects for FENO models). At visit 2, the subjects had median daytime symptoms of 3 d/wk, nighttime symptoms 3 times a month, and required rescue albuterol for 1-day duration. Compared with baseline, a significant increase in log exhaled NO (þ0.76), and decrease in lung function (FEV 1 % predicted, À24; FEV 1 /FVC, À12%;, and FEF 25-75 % predicted, À34), was noted at the time of exacerbation (all P values <.001) (Tables II and III) . At visit 3, a significant decrease in log exhaled NO (À0.76) and improvement in lung function parameters (FEV 1 % predicted, þ21; FEV 1 /FVC, þ9%; and FEF 25-75 % predicted, þ29, respectively) (P < .001) were found from the time of exacerbation measurement and after the initiation of prednisone (Table III) . There were no differences between log FENO (P ¼ .99), FEV 1 % predicted (P ¼ .1), FEV 1 /FVC (P ¼ .07), and FEF 25-75 % predicted (P ¼ .2) after the initiation of prednisone treatment and baseline measurements. Fifty-six percent of the children had evidence for a PCR (þ) exacerbation, with 1 or more respiratory viruses identified by PCR. No differences in patients' demographic characteristics were noted at baseline between children with PCR (þ) versus PCR (À) asthma exacerbations (Table I) . The most commonly identified virus was rhinovirus, occurring in 62% of the participants followed by corona virus in 13%, influenza or metapneumovirus in 10%, and parainfluenza in 5%. Of the 39 children with positive viral PCR, 11 had more than 1 virus identified at the time of the exacerbation. Using unadjusted and adjusted models, changes in the following outcomes (log FENO, FEV 1 , FEV 1 /FVC, and FEF were evaluated between PCR (þ) and PCR (À) groups. In the unadjusted log FENO model, the interaction between PCR (þ) and PCR (À) groups and visit was marginally significant (P ¼ .06; Figure 2 , A). A trend was also found using adjusted analysis (P ¼ .07; Figure 2 , B). In both the unadjusted and adjusted models, there was no difference in log FENO between the 2 exacerbation groups by PCR viral detection at baseline (or steady state), but higher log FENO was found in PCR (À) than in PCR (þ) children at the time of exacerbation and after the initiation of a prednisone course (P ¼ .05 and .001, respectively, from adjusted analysis). No differences were found between PCR (À) and PCR (þ) groups in the measures of lung function studied across visits.
