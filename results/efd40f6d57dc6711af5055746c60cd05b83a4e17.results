After vaccination, active CDV seroconversion was demonstrated in the pups (Table 2 ). All three negative control pups started to show signs of CDV-related illness 7^8 days after challenge. By 10 days after challenge they presented with prostration, dehydration, respiratory, enteric and nervous signs. Two pups were humanely destroyed on day 10 after challenge, due to the severity of the disease. One control pup was kept alive and recovered from disease. All 12 vaccinated pups survived intravenous challenge with CDV uneventfully; they were alert and healthy during the 21 day observation period. No marked clinical abnormalities were observed in any of the vaccinated dogs after challenge. Three vaccinated pups were recorded to have either serous nasal discharge or to have loose stool for 1 day only.
