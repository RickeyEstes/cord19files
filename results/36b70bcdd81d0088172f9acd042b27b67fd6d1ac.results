Thirty-two asthmatic patients and 73 patients with COPD with sputum mediator records at exacerbation were included in this study. Their demographics, clinical characteristics, and sputum mediators were summarized across the diseases in Table E1 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline. org. Inhaled corticosteroid dose was not different between asthmatic patients and patients with COPD. All asthmatic patients were receiving long-acting b-agonist treatment, and all but 2 patients with COPD were receiving a long-acting b-agonist and/or a long-acting muscarinic antagonist. Asthmatic patients were younger and more obese and had better lung function than patients with COPD. VAS scores, cellular profiles, and bacteria-associated exacerbations were not significantly different between the 2 diseases. Levels of several sputum mediators (IL-5, IL-6 receptor [IL-6R], CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL5, and CCL26) were significantly increased in asthmatic patients versus patients with COPD, whereas levels of IL-6, CCL3, CCL4, and TNF receptor (TNF-R) 1 were significantly increased in patients with COPD versus asthmatic patients. However, levels of the majority of mediators, such as IL-1b, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, CCL2, CCL13, CCL17, TNF-a, TNF-R2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and IFN-g, were not significantly different between asthmatic patients and patients with COPD (see Table E1 ). Similarly, levels of the serum mediators IL-5, IL-8, CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL17, CCL26, TNF-a were increased in asthmatic patients versus levels of IL-1b, IL-6, CCL4, and TNF-R1, which were increased in patients with COPD, and others (CCL2, CCL13, TNF-R2, and VEGF) were not different between groups (see Table E1 ). Fourteen asthmatic patients and 40 patients with COPD who had sputum mediators at exacerbation also provided sufficient sputum for further microbiome analysis. Alpha diversities at the phylum and genus levels were not different between the asthma and COPD groups, as shown in Figs E1 and E2 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org. Beta diversities were 0.25 for asthmatic patients and 0.20 for patients with COPD at the phylum level. At the genus level, beta diversities were 0.52 for asthmatic patients and 0.49 for patients with COPD. Phyla and genera with median relative abundance of greater than 2% were Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria at the phylum level and Actinomyces and Rothia species (both phylum Actinobacteria), Lactobacillus and Streptococcus species (both phylum Firmicutes), and Neisseria, Haemophilus, Moraxella, and Pseudomonas species (all phylum Proteobacteria) at the genus level. The relative abundance of the most abundant phyla and/or those known to be major airway pathogens across asthmatic patients and patients with COPD and the Proteobacteria/Firmicutes ratio (P/F ratio) for asthmatic patients versus patients with COPD are presented (see Fig E1) . At the phylum level, the airway ecology was similar between asthmatic patients and patients with COPD with only Bacteroidetes significantly increased for asthmatic patients compared with patients with COPD (see Fig E1) . The relative abundance of the most abundant and clinically relevant genera (Streptococcus, Haemophilus, and Moraxella) was also not significantly different between asthmatic patients and patients with COPD (see Fig E2) .
