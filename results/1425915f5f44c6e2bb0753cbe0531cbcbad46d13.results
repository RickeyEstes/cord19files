TNF-a Protein Production by Astrocytes from EAE-resistant and -susceptible Rat Strains. We examined TNF-a protein production by astrocytes from Lewis and BN rat strains in response to three different stimuli. Lewis and BN astrocyte cultures were treated with varying concentrations of LPS (1-10,000 ng/ml) with and without IFN-y (100 U/ml), or IFN-y (1-1,000 U/ml) plus RAO (1,000 U/ml) for 18 h, at which point the supernatants were harvested and assayed for TNF-a production . As shown in Fig. 1 , BN astrocytes produced TNF-a in response to LPS in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment of these cells with IFN-y, then LPS, did not result in significant enhancement of TNF-a production. Even more striking was the observation that BN astrocytes secreted neglible amounts of TNF-a in response to the stimuli of IFNy/IL 10 . This induction pathway was previously shown to be dependent on a priming signal generated by IFN-y, then subsequent exposure to 11,10 (11) . Lewis astrocyte cultures exhibited a different induction pattern with respect to TNF-a production . Lewis astrocytes responded poorly to LPS alone at all concentrations tested, yet when pretreated with IFN-y, then exposed to LPS, TNF-a protein production increased significantly (Fig . 2) . Lewis astrocytes also produce TNF-a in response to IFN-y/IIr10, in the range of what was previously observed for astrorytes from the outbred rat strain Sprague-Dawley (11). The Lewis x BN Ft rats show susceptibility to EAE compared with the fully resistant BN rat, however, disease severity in the Fl strains is less than that observed for Lewis rats. The Ft astrorytes produced low amounts of TNF-a in response to LPS, and IFN-y pretreatment significantly enhanced LPS-induced TNF-a production (Fig. 3) . The absolute levels of TNF-a in response to IFN-, y/ LPS, though, were less than those observed for the Lewis astrorytes . The Fl astrocyte TNF-a production in response to IFN-y/IIr1O was modest . Prostaglandins have been demonstrated to inhibit LPS-and IFN-, y/LPS-induced TNF-a expression in murine macrophages (41) (42) (43) (44) . As astrorytes have the ability to secrete PGE2 (45) , we wished to determine if endogenous PGE production contributed to strain differences in TNF-a production. Lewis and BN astrorytes were treated with 1 kg/ml of indomethacin, which blocks PGE2 synthesis, and then 80 4 Tumor Necrosis Factor Expression by Astrocytes TNF-a production was assessed. Treatment of cultures with indomethacin increased TNF-a production by both BN and Lewis astrocytes, but did not alter the overall pattern of TNF-a expression in response to LPS or IFN-y/LPS (Table 1) . Similar results were obtained for IFN-y/IIr1a-induced TNF-a production (data not shown) . Most striking is the consistent low level of TNF-a production by Lewis rats in response to LPS plus indomethacin, and the enhancement with IFN-,y pretreatment . These results suggest that differential TNF-a production by astrorytes from BN and Lewis rats is not due to suppression by endogenous PGE2 . TNF-a mRNA Expression by Astrocytes from EAE-resistant and -susceptible Strains. We next examined TNF-a mRNA levels from stimulated BN and Lewis astrocytes to assess if differences in TNF-a protein expression were reflected at the mRNA level. We had previously used the sensitive technique of reverse transcription (RT PCR) to demonstrate levels of TNF-a mRNA in astrorytes because very low levels of this specific RNA are expressed (11) . The astrorytes from BN and Lewis were incubated with LPS (10 jig/ml) for 4 h, IFN--Y (100 U/ml) for 8 h followed by LPS for an additional 4 h, or IFN-y (100 U/ml) for 8 h followed by IIAR (100 U/ml) for an additional 4 h; then RNA was isolated. Using this RNA, we initially synthesized the corresponding cDNA by RT, and then used PCR to amplify a specific sequence of the TNF-ci cDNA as described in Materials and Methods. As shown in Fig. 4 , the amplified TNF-ot cDNA sequence is detected in astrocytes stimulated with LPS alone, IFNy/LPS, or IFN-y/11,10, but not in unstimulated astrocyte cultures . The amplified sequence, hybridizing with a mouse TNF-cx cDNA probe, had the expected size of 275 bp. To insure linearity of the assay, varying amounts of the PCR product (1-16 p,l) were run on a Southern blot . Scanning ofthe autoradiographs was performed on the exposure shown in Fig . 4 , as well as ones developed for less time. Differences in TNF-ct mRNA expression were observed within each rat strain, depending on the stimulus used, as well as between BN and Lewis astrocytes. Comparing TNF-ci mRNA levels in BN astrorytes, our results indicate that these cells express TNF-oi mRNA in response to LPS alone, and slightly more upon pretreatment with IFN-y (1.5-fold increase) . Low levels of TNF-ot mRNA are expressed in response to stimulation with IFN-y/IL1# compared with mRNA levels from LPS-80 6 Tumor Necrosis Factor Expression by Astrocytes or IFN-y/LPS-treated astrocytes . When examining TNF-ci mRNA expression by Lewis astrorytes, we observed that low levels of TNF-ot mRNA are detected in cells stimulated with LPS alone, enhanced expression with the combined stimuli of IFN-y/LPS (2.5-fold increase), and even higher levels of TNT-ot mRNA upon stimulation with IFN-y/IIr1/3. These differences within each strain are consistent with the TNF-a protein results (Figs. 1 and 2) , although the differences in the mRNA levels are not as pronounced . When TNF-cx mRNA levels are compared between BN and Lewis astrocytes, the most striking difference is in response to IFN-.y/11,10 ( Fig . 5) . TNFca Protein Production by Peritoneal Macrophages_from EAEresistant and -susceptible Rat Strains. To determine if the differences in TNF-ot production by Lewis and BN astrorytes were restricted to this cell type, we examined TNF-ot production by peritoneal macrophages from these same strains. Peritoneal macrophages were obtained from adult Lewis and BN rats as described in Materials and Methods, and exposed to the stimuli of LPS, IFN-y, IFN-y/LPS, and IFN-y/IL1/3 . As shown in Table 2 , peritoneal macrophages from both strains produce TNF-ci in response to LPS, and IFN-y pretreatment enhances TNF-a production . In addition, these cells produce TNF-ot in response to IFN-y/IL1j3 in a comparable manner. 16 pl of the PCR product from unstimulated control astrocytes was analyzed (lane 1) . Analysis was by Southern blot hybridization with a labeled 1,300-bp mouse TNF-a cDNA. The blots were exposed to X-Omat film for 7.5 h at -70Â°C. Similar results were also obtained when testing neonatal microglia (data not shown) . This suggests that TNF-a production in these rat strains is regulated differently in astrocytes vs. peritoneal macrophages and microglia. Figure 5 .
