We used a single dose of 20 Î¼g/mouse of carbon nanoparticles (CNP) generated by spark discharge from graphite electrodes to induce an aseptic, acute neutrophilic inflammatory response in the lungs of healthy C57BL/6 mice by intratracheal instillation (IT). Particle dispersions where characterized by a mean agglomerate size of 190 nm (DSL) consisting of primary carbon particles of 7-12 nm (Additional file 1: Figure S1 ). In comparison to sham treated controls, the IT delivery of 20ug CNP induced no detectable histological alterations in the epithelial architecture of the lungs within 24 h after instillation. However, particle laden alveolar macrophages (AM) can be detected in the alveoli and even more prominent on cytospin preparations of by BAL recovered cells from CNP treated lungs (Fig. 1 ). The appearance of particle laden AM was accompanied by an accumulation of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) 24 h after CNP IT. No particle agglomerates could be detected in structural cells, such as ATII cells.
