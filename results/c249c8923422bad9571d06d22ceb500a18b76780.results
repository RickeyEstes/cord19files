Subjects were enrolled between 17 January 2003 and 05 November 2003. The last day of data collection for all subjects was 31 January 2004. Two hundred and thirty-four children were enrolled with 229 returning at least one of the monthly symptom diaries, providing 56,397 child-days of data. This represented 82.5% of 68,400 possible childdays of data had all diaries been returned. There was at least one symptom present on 12,720 (22.6%) study days, with Category B more common than Category A symptoms ( Table 1 ). The most frequent symptom was runny nose/nasal congestion, present on 9024 days (16.0%). Symptoms were most commonly present in June and August 2003 being found on 32% of child-days both months, and least common during January 2004, present only on 8% of child-days. Of all study households, 229 were dual parent families and 5 were single parent families. At the enrolment interview, 26% (60/234) of study mothers and 9% (20/229) of study fathers were classified as healthcare workers. There was at least one healthcare worker in 68 (29%) households. Of the 730 ARIs identified, no specimen was returned for 187 (25.6%) and at least one specimen was returned for 543 (74.4%): 524 ARIs with one specimen, 18 with two specimens, and one with three specimens, bringing the total number of evaluable specimens to 563. There were 409 (73%) specimens that were positive for at least one virus: 154 (27%) had no virus detected; 354 (63%) had one virus detected; 50 (9%) had two viruses detected; and 5 (1%) had three viruses detected. We explored whether specimens were positive for any virus by a number of categories: if the collecting parent was a healthcare worker, inclusion of a throat swab, and collector reported quality of the collection method (Table 2) . There was no apparent difference in the likelihood of identifying any virus by healthcare worker parent or by the collector's impression of collection quality. A throat swab was included in 70% of specimens (394/563), but its presence did not improve the likelihood of a positive result (Table 2) . We examined whether a throat swab made any difference to positivity for individual virus types (Table 3) . For all RNA viruses the likelihood of positivity was very similar for both specimen types, other than parainfluenza viruses which were more commonly identified in a nose-only swab (p = 0.046). A higher proportion of specimens that included a throat swab identified an adenovirus, 9% versus 5%. We calculated the delay between ARI onset and specimen collection, and specimen collection and testing, to see if they had any impact on swab positivity (Table 4) . A short delay between onset and collection appeared to have little impact on positivity, with all specimens collected within 5 days of onset having a minimum positivity rate of 71% regardless of the delay in testing, and an overall positivity rate of 74%. The rate of positivity appeared to fall for specimens collected following a delay from onset to collection of six or more days when combined with a delay in testing of two (63% positive) or more days (61%). There were 205 household contact illnesses identified following 175 ARIs in a study child: 148 with a single subsequent illness, 24 with two illnesses, and three with three illnesses. This resulted in the collection of 184 specimens from household contacts, with 74 (40%) of these being selfcollected. These specimens are currently stored in a minus 70 â€¢ C freezer waiting complete respiratory virus PCR testing. We received completed study conclusion questionnaires from 183 (78%) families. Most of these families (87%) reported that they would have been willing to continue with the study for another year. The most difficult study procedure was reported to be collecting a throat swab from the study child (58%), followed by completing the burden diary for the study child (21%), keeping the daily symptom diary (11%), collecting a nose swab (3%), taking swabs from household contacts (2%), and completing a burden diary for the household contacts (1%). Four percent of participants found no task difficult. When parents were asked whether they would enrol their child into a hypothetical vaccine study using similar methods to ReVS (daily symptom diary and NTS collection): 35% said yes without qualification; 45% said they would consider it, but would need to hear more about the study before deciding; the remaining 20% said no, either because they were not happy for their child to receive an experimental vaccine (13%), were not happy to collect daily symptoms and specimens (3%), or were not happy to have an experimental vaccine, nor collect daily symptoms and specimens (4%).
