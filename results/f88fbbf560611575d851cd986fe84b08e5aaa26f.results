The overall prevalence of cryptosporidial infection in cattle was 19.7%. Infected bovines were found in 19 out of 30 (63.3%) farms surveyed. Oocyst shedding was recorded in bovines ranging from 3 days old to adults, although infection rates were significantly higher in suckling calves (53.8%) than in the remaining age groups (P < 0.0001) ( Table 1 ). The size and structure of the oocysts identified in positive samples was consistent with that of C. parvum (Upton and Current, 1985) . Analysis of selected infection rates in suckling calves showed that 44.4% of calves 3-4 days old were infected, although the percentage of calves shedding oocysts peaked at 6-15 days (76.7%), decreasing to 40% in calves aged 1 month. Semiquantitative counting of cryptosporidia positive smears showed that infection intensities were usually low, since 88.1% of infected animals excreted few oocysts. Moderate or many oocysts were detected in some of the suckling calves less than 1.5 months old (4.8% and 23.8%, respectively) and weanling calves aged 1.5-4 months (0% and 5.9%, respectively), whereas all the infected bovines older than 4 months excreted few oocysts. At sampling, diarrhoea was reported in 51 (65.4%) suckling calves and 18 (14.9%) weanling calves. As much as 78.6% of suckling calves and 29.4% of weanling calves infected by C. parvum had diarrhoea, whereas infection was always asymptomatic in bovines older than 4 months. Cryptosporidial infection rates were higher in diarrhoeic than in non-diarrhoeic calves, in both suckling (64.7% and 33.3%, respectively) and weanling calves (27.8% and 11.6%, respectively), but the differences were only statistically significant in suckling calves (P < 0.01). It is worth noting that all calves shedding moderate or many oocysts had diarrhoea, whereas asymptomatic infection was always correlated with few oocysts in faeces. Nevertheless, diarrhoea was also associated with low intensity of infection, since 70% of suckling and 25% of weanling calves shedding few oocysts had diarrhoea. Similarly, an association between infection intensities and faecal consistency was found in diarrhoeic suckling calves, as the number of those excreting liquid stools significantly increased with the number of oocysts found in the faeces (P < 0.05) (70% of suckling calves shedding many oocysts had liquid stools, in contrast with 50% of those shedding moderate and 23.8% of those shedding few oocysts). On the other hand, Giardia cysts were identified in 65 bovines (11.7%) from 16 (53.3%) of the farms surveyed. Infection rates were significantly higher in suckling (14.1%) and weanling calves (38%) than in the other age groups (P < 0.001) ( Table 1) . Cysts were classified as belonging to the Giardia duodenalis group based on their structure (Thompson et al., 1993) . Diarrhoea was recorded in 45.5% of suckling and 10.9% of weanling calves infected by Giardia, but it was not found to be statistically associated with infection. In fact, rates were higher in non-diarrhoeic than in diarrhoeic calves, in both suckling (22.2% and 9.8%, respectively) and weanling calves (39.8% and 27.8%, respectively). Prevalence of enteric parasites in calves with diarrhoea, including monoinfections and mixed infections, is presented in Table 2 .
