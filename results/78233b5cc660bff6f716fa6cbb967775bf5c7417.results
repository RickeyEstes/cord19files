Bat respiratory epithelial cells were more resistant to influenza virus infection than MDCK cells but were relatively more permissive to avian than human virus strains Despite speculation that bats may be potential hosts for conventional influenza viruses, few studies have examined the infectious relationship between influenza viruses and bats. Lung epithelial cells derived from three bat species, T. brasiliensis (TB1-Lu) E. helvum and C. perspicillata (C. perspic), were subjected to virus infection using two LPAI viruses, H2N3 and H6N1 virus, and two human influenza viruses, USSR H1N1 and pdm H1N1 virus, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0, based on focus forming assays. MDCK cells were used as a comparative control cell line due to their use as a reference cell line for influenza A virus titration [18, 19] . MDCK and bat cells were immunostained for viral NP at 6 and 24 hpi (Fig. 1) . At 6 hpi, intranuclear viral NP was extensively detected in MDCK cells infected with each of the four viruses and at 24 hpi NP presence had extended into the cytoplasm (Fig. 1a) . Similar extensive pattern of infection was not observed with bat cells. TB1-Lu cells were not readily infected by either human or avian viruses. At 6 hpi, there was little or no detection of NP; at 24 hpi, NP was found only in a limited proportion of nuclei (Fig. 1b) . In E. helvum cells infected with LPAI viruses (H2N3 and H6N1), NP was extensively detected by 6 hpi (Fig. 1c) . By 24 hpi, NP was detected in the cytoplasm accompanied by widespread detachment of cells. In contrast, in E. helvum cells infected with human viruses (USSR H1N1 and pdm H1N1), NP was only detected in a small proportion of cells even at 24 hpi suggesting that they were less infected with human than avian influenza viruses. A similar infection pattern was observed in C. perspic cells. At 6 hpi with avian viruses, most nuclei of C. perspic cells were strongly labelled for NP and by 24 hpi, cytoplasmic NP was evident with extensive cell loss (Fig. 1d ). With human USSR or pdm H1N1 virus, limited number of C. perspic cells were infected even at 24 hpi with NP largely localised to the nuclei. In summary, all three species of bat cells infected with human and avian influenza viruses showed much less viral NP production than correspondingly infected MDCK cells, with TB1-Lu cells producing the least viral NP. Relatively, E. helvum and C. perspic cells showed greater NP production and cell loss at 24 hpi when infected with avian than with human viruses. Viable progeny virus output from all three species of bat cells was significantly less (P ≤ 0.0001) than from correspondingly infected (at 0.5 MOI for 24 h) MDCK cells (Fig. 2a-d) . Notably, avian H2N3 and H6N1 influenza viruses (Fig. 2b and d) generated proportionally more progeny virus than human USSR H1N1 and pdm H1N1 viruses (Fig. 2a and c) for each type of bat cells. Among the three species, TB1-Lu cells clearly produced the least progeny viruses (Fig. 2a-d) perspic cells appear more replication permissive and exhibit greater cytopathogenicity to avian than to human influenza viruses. Lack of human sialic acid α2,6 linkage receptor contributed to host resistance in TB1-Lu cells The transfection of bat cells with FITC-labelled siRNA using Viromer blue reagent (Lipocalyx), designed to mimic natural influenza viral entry and membrane fusion [20] , showed reduction in endosomal uptake of siRNA by TB1-Lu relative to E. helvum, C. perspic and MDCK cells (Fig. 3a) . This reduced uptake by TB1- are more adapted to SA receptors with α-2,3 linkage [21] [22] [23] . We examined the expression and spatial distribution of SAα2,3-GalG(1-3)GalNAc and SAα2,6-Gal receptors in the three species of bat and MDCK cells by binding with plant lectins MAA II and SNA, respectively, to determine if they could potentially account for host species differences in influenza virus susceptibility. Both SAα2,3-Gal and SAα2,6-Gal receptors were extensively detected in MDCK, E. helvum and C. perspic cells (Fig. 3b) . However, in TB1-Lu cells the avian SAα2,3-Gal receptor was clearly present; human SAα2,6-Gal receptor was barely detected. The lack of a major receptor type in TB1-Lu cells could contribute to host resistance ( Figs. 1 and 2 ) by reducing cell entry of influenza viruses. To further explore the functional impact of SA receptors on influenza virus infection, SA receptors were collectively removed from the cell surface using a generic neuraminidase derived from Clostridium perfringens, as previously described [16] (Fig. 3c) . In all cell types, the removal of SA receptors resulted in sharp decrease in virus output (Fig. 3d) Mock transfected MDCK cells showed complete absence of fluorescence. b E. helvum and C. persic but not TB1-Lu cells expressed human and avian SA receptors. Bat and MDCK cells were subjected to binding by plant lectins SNA and MAA II for the detection of human SAα2,6 Gal (green) and avian SAα2,3 Gal (red) receptors respectively. Avian SAα2,3 Gal and human SAα2,6 Gal receptors were readily found in all cell types except for TB1-Lu cells where SAα2,6 Gal receptor was barely detected. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). c SA receptors were effectively removed from MDCK cells treated with a broad spectrum neuraminidase derived from Clostridium perfringens. Post-treatment, there was hardly any detection of SA receptors using MAA II and SNA lectins. d Collective removal of SA receptors with neuraminidase resulted in a marked reduction in progeny virus production from all three bat species. All results shown are representative of three experimental repeats cells could be an added factor of host resistance to entry of human influenza viruses in this cell type.
