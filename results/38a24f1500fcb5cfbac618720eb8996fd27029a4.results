From the year 2011 to 2015, sales of antibiotics for use in food producing animals decreased by 29.8% ( Table 1 ). In the same time, the percentage represented by premixes decreased from 67.8 to 57.7%. Therefore, measured in kg, antimicrobials sold in premixes made the largest part of yearly sales of antimicrobials for the veterinary medicine. As a consequence, pigs and calves are the most pertinent species among food producing animals to be investigated for use and trend detection. In tonnage sold for use in these species, the decrease in the 5 years under investigation is comparable: 38.4% in pigs and 30.1% in calves. However, normalizing these numbers to the respective biomass of the produced (slaughtered) population reveals a much higher use per kg of biomass for calves (449.9 mg/kg biomass in 2015) than for pigs (77.4 mg/kg biomass). The difference between both species even increased from 4.8-fold higher for calves in 2011 to 5.8 in 2015. Normalizing sales data to either the overall biomass of food producing animals or to the biomass of a particular species is a crude estimate of antimicrobials use, not taking dose or duration into account. We therefore calculated the number of course doses (ACDs) per product and species. A summary of the results is presented in Table 2 . The total number of ACDs was approximately 4.5 times higher in pigs and decreased by 31.7% over the years under investigation, whereas the decrease for calves was 23.0%. Normalization to the number of slaughtered animals showed a much slower decrease of 14.9% for calves between 2011 and 2015 compared to 29.6% in pigs. As a result, the difference between both species grew from 2.3-fold in the year 2011 to 2.8-fold in the final year under investigation. Not all antibiotics have the same potential impact on resistance selection and consequences for the treatment of both humans and animals. Moreover, different products are authorized for distinct conditions in pigs or calves. The repartition of the number of ACDs per class of antimicrobials was therefore calculated separately for each species for the year 2015. Table 3 presents the repartition by antimicrobial class for ingredients sold in premixes and as parenteral injections. In this year, polymyxins (in form of colistin) were the class with the highest potential numbers of ACDs per pigs, followed by sulfonamides. In calves, the highest number was represented by penicillins (mainly sold as aminopenicillins) followed by tetracyclines. The total number of ACDs per animal was 4.43 times higher in calves than in pigs. The same calculation was done for injectable products as these may contain antimicrobials of the highest priority [HPCIA; (26) ] not available for oral application. For pigs, the highest number of ACDs per animal in the year 2015 was represented by macrolides, followed by aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. For calves (amino)penicillins were the class with the highest number of course doses per animal, followed by macrolides and aminoglycosides. The total number of potential ACDs per animal for injectable products in the year 2015 was 1.485 for calves and 1.088 for pigs. Finally, the evolution of the number of potential ACDs per animal for HPCIAs is presented in Table 4 . For macrolides used in pigs, a decrease of 22.0% for products sold as premixes was attenuated by a corresponding increase of 11.8% for injectables. This pattern was even more evident in calves where a reduction of 27.1% for premixes was almost completely compensated by an increase of 25.7% in injectables. With respect to the other two classes of HPCIAs, sales of products containing fluoroquinolones remained stable for pigs (−1.5%) and an increase of 6.4% was observed for the number of potential ACDs per animal in calves. Courses with cephalosporins of the third and fourth generations showed a comparable decrease in pigs (−16.4%) and calves (−15.7%).
