Optimal amplification of the Y. ruckeri yruI/yruR gene by ERM-LAMP assay was obtained at 63Â°C for 60 min, as shown by both agarose gel electrophoresis and real time turbidity measurements. Amplified products exhibited a ladder-like pattern on the gel (Fig. 1) . Specificity of the amplification was confirmed by digestion of the LAMP products using HphI restriction enzyme (Fig. 1) , the sizes of the resultant digestion products were as predicted (87 bp and 108 bp). Results obtained with the visual detection methods correlated with agarose gel electrophoresis results. When FDR used, a strong green fluorescence was emitted by LAMP positive reactions (F ig. 2, Tube No.3) when exposed to UV light and no fluorescence was evident for a negative reaction (Fig. 2, Tube No. 4) . Likewise, after addition of SYBR Green I dye, the ERM-LAMP products appeared green (Fig. 2 , Tube No. 5), while in the negative control tube the original orange colour of SYBR Green I did not change (Fig. 2 , Tube No. 6). With Roxlabelled probe, a pellet formed emitted a red fluorescence for a positive reaction (Fig. 2 , Tube No. 2), but there was neither pellet nor fluorescence observed in the negative control tube (Fig. 2, Tube No. 1) . The specificity of ERM-LAMP primers was confirmed by amplification of yruI/yruR gene from all Y. ruckeri tested strains while there are no amplification products detected from the other bacterial species, non-infected fish tissues or negative (no template) LAMP reaction control (Fig. 3) . Both agarose gel electrophoresis and visual detection methods showed that, the lower detection limit of the ERM-LAMP method is 10 -6 dilution, which equal to 1 pg of the Y. ruckeri genomic DNA (Fig. 4) , while PCR showed no amplification after a dilution of 10 -5 which equal to 10 pg Y. ruckeri genomic DNA (Fig. 5) . The LAMP assay detected Y. ruckeri DNA from 15 infected fish samples, which were also positive by PCR (Fig. 6 &7) . Samples from all 4 control fish were negative in both assays.
