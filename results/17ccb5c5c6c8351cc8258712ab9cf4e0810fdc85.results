The background characteristics and baseline measures are summarized in Table 1 . There were no significant differences between vaccine and placebo groups in age, financial strain, work demands, or in physiological measures. The mood scores showed a high positive vigour score coupled with low ratings on negative scales, indicating that participants were generally in positive moods. Mood scores did not differ significantly between groups, with the exception of fatigue (t = 15.3, P <.05), where ratings were higher in the placebo than vaccine group. However, the scores in both groups were extremely low (possible range 0 -24), so the difference was trivial. None of the participants reported appreciable symptoms preinjection.
