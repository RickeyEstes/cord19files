The questionnaire was completed by 527 HCWs, 401 (76.1%) of them were females and 142 (26.9%) were aged over 50 years. Characteristics of the surveyed participants are summarized in Table 1 . A total of 262 HCWs (49.7%) reported having received the seasonal influenza vaccine during the current immunization campaign, while only 87 of them (16.5%) affirmed having received the pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 vaccine. Seventytwo responders (13.7%) reported having undergone immunization for both seasonal and pandemic influenza. Receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine was significantly more likely among males (P < 0.001), HCWs with history of previous seasonal vaccination in the 2008-2009 campaign or pandemic influenza vaccination during the current campaign (P < 0.001 in both cases), resident and staff physicians (P < 0.001 in both cases), and being in a priority group for seasonal influenza immunization (P < 0.001). Conversely, HCWs who reported regular contact with patients (P = 0.003) as well as the nursing assistants (P = 0.002) and nurses (P < 0.001) had lower coverage rates for seasonal vaccination ( Table 2) . For pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza, the factors showing a significant association with receipt of vaccination were male gender (P < 0.001), a history of seasonal vaccination either in the previous or current campaign (P < 0.001 for both), being in a priority group for seasonal (P = 0.01) or pandemic influenza immunization (P < 0.001), and being a resident or staff physician (P <0.001 in both cases). Nursing assistants (P = 0.015) and nurses (P < 0.001) were again more likely to refuse pandemic vaccine, as summarized in Table 2 . We identified three variables independently associated with the acceptance of seasonal influenza vaccine: history of previous seasonal vaccination (OR: 0.05; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.03-0.09; P < 0.001), simultaneous pandemic vaccination during the current campaign (OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.14-0.75; P = 0.008), and being a resident physician (OR: 0.01; 95% CI: 0.00-0.08; P < 0.001). We also identified three variables associated with the acceptance of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza: simultaneous receipt of seasonal vaccine (OR: 0.27; 95% CI: 0.14-0.52; P < 0.001), being a staff (OR: 0.08; 95% CI: 0.04-0.19; P < 0.001) or a resident physician (OR: 0.16; 95% CI: 0.05-0.50; P = 0.002). Self-reported membership of a priority group for pandemic vaccination was associated with refusal (OR: 5.98; 95% CI: 1.35-26.5; P = 0.019). As shown in Fig. 1 , the most frequent reasons for accepting seasonal influenza vaccination were "self-protection" (51.9%), "protection of the patient" (23.7%), and "being in a priority group for immunization" (12.2%). Fig. 2 summarized the reasons adduced for refusal of seasonal influenza vaccination, with "doubts about vaccine efficacy" (20.8%), "fear of adverse reactions" (14.0%), and "lack of concern" (13.2%) as the most commonly reported. With regards to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza vaccination, "self-protection" (33.3%), "protection of the patient" (31.0%) and "protection of own family and colleagues" (21.8%) were the most common reasons for acceptance (Fig. 1) , whereas the existence of "doubts about vaccine efficacy" (30.0%), "fear of adverse reactions" (16.6%), and "lack of concern" (9.1%) were the main reasons adduced for refusal of such a measure (Fig. 2) . In most of the cases, the main arguments either to accept or to refuse the pandemic influenza vaccine significantly differed to those reported for seasonal influenza. When specifically analyzed the reasons for refusal of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza immunization among the 190 HCWs (36% of all responders) that reported having received the seasonal influenza vaccine but not the pandemic, the presence of "doubts about vaccine efficacy" (38.1%), "fear of adverse reactions" (19.4%) and "lack of concern" (9.0%) again emerged as the ones most commonly adduced. Finally, among the 15 HCWs (2.8% of the total sample) vaccinated against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza but not against seasonal influenza, the most frequent reasons given for the refusal of the latter were "lack of time availability" (7 responders) and the "perception of not being at risk for acquiring the disease" (2 responders). A total of 84 surveyed HCWs (15.9%) declared to be included in a priority group for the seasonal influenza vaccination because of their medical conditions. Most of them were females (77.4%) and medical technicians (33.3%) with habitual patient contact (76.2%). The most frequent reasons for non-receipt of seasonal influenza vaccine in this subgroup were the existence of "doubts about vaccine efficacy" (36.0%) or "fear of adverse reactions" (20.0%). In the same way, among the 74 HCWs (14.0%) that reported being in a priority group for the pandemic influenza vaccination the arguments for refusal were "doubts about vaccine efficacy" (30.4%) and "fear of adverse reactions" (17.4%).
