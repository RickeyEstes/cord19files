From January 11, 2020 to February 10, 2020, a total of 1,334 patients with a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recorded in the Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, while 6.2% (82/1334) of patients with this disease were dead. In the same period, the rate of mortality for all causes and non-COVID-19 in this hospital, were 2.3% (162/7119) and 1.4% (80/5785), respectively. The mortality rate of COVID-19 was higher than that of non-COVID-19 (p<0.001). author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We analyzed the causes of mortality of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (table 2) . Respiratory failure remained the leading cause of death (69.5%), following by sepsis syndrome/multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MOF) (28.0%), cardiac failure (14.6%), hemorrhage (6.1%), and renal failure (3.7%). Furthermore, respiratory, cardiac, hemorrhage, hepatic, and renal damage were found in 100%, 89%, 80.5%, 78.0%, and 31.7% of patients, respectively. A majority of patients (75.6%) had 3 or more damaged organs or systems following the infection with SARS-CoV-2. were observed in patients. All rights reserved.

Increased C-reactive protein level, high NLR, increased lactate dehydrogenase, and increased D-dimer were found in all patients. The incidence of neutrophilia was increased from 74.3% to 100%, and the incidence of lymphopenia was reduced from 89.2% to 73.7%. The incidence of high creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were increased from 15.3% The median time from initial symptom to death was 15 days (IQR 15-20) and a significant association between aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.002), alanine aminotransferase (p=0.037) and time from initial symptom to death were interestingly observed (figure 1A-C).
