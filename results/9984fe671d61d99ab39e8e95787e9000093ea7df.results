Influence of N-glycosylation on binding of conformational HIV antibodies to yeast-produced gp120 Since HIV spike proteins are highly glycosylated, proteolytically processed, and contain numerous disulfide bonds, only eukaryotic cells with appropriate protein processing machinery can serve as hosts for the display of functional protein. Whereas mammalian cell lines are relatively slow growing, and achieving the single genotype-phenotype linkage requires viral transfections or other rather cumbersome and time-consuming methodologies, the yeast S. cerevisiae is a robust and well-described eukaryotic host for cell-surface display [42] . Yeast are capable of displaying complex mammalian glycoproteins such as antibody fragments, full-length antibodies, peptide-MHC molecules, or growth factor receptors [42] [43] [44] [45] , as well as a growing number of viral envelope proteins of fragments thereof such as hemagglutinin, the gp120 core, Dengue E protein, SARS-CoV, West Nile Virus envelope, and the Hepatitis C Virus envelope protein E2 [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] , suggesting that the display of HIV envelope protein is feasible in principle. Nevertheless, in S. cerevisiae, N-linked glycans are extended and mannose-rich [52] , though P. pastoris yeast strains with human or human-like N-linked glycosyation have been reported to overcome this limitation [53, 54] . To investigate whether heterologous N-glycosylation in yeast has a major effect on the recognition of gp120 by conformational antibodies, we compared HIV-1 JR-FL gp120 produced in either S. cerevisiae strain YVH10 or glycan-engineered P. pastoris [53] for binding to a panel of conformational HIV-1 bnAbs. The mannose-rich N-glycosylation in YVH10 is trimmed to a more human-like 5-mannose stem in engineered Pichia, which may promote proper protein folding and conformational Ab recognition. However, we found that Pichia-produced gp120 did not display a clearly improved binding profile across a panel of bnAbs (S1 Fig.) . Furthermore, P. pastoris-produced gp120 appeared somewhat more fragmented on a Western blot, suggesting more proteolytic degradation as compared to S. cerevisiae. Therefore, and because of the well-established and characterized Aga1/2-based display system, S. cerevisiae was chosen as host for HIV spike protein display. Design of a codon-optimized gp140 for expression in S. cerevisiae Since the secretion of a full-length JR-FL gp140 including the stabilizing SOS and I559P substitutions (SOSIP JR-FL gp140 [36, 37] ) in S. cerevisiae YVH10 had failed, we fragmented the gene and compared the level of secreted protein between a gp120 stripped core construct described previously [47] , gp120 trimmed at N-and C-termini, full-length gp120, a full-length SOSIP gp140, as well as gp41, and gp41 lacking its hydrophobic fusion peptide (Fig. 1A) . Notably, proteins were not secreted as Aga2 fusions in this study. Firstly, both gp120 fragments and fulllength gp120 could be secreted at clearly detectable levels, but not full-length SOSIP gp140. Secondly, the omission of the fusion peptide clearly enhanced secretion of gp41, suggesting that its omission or modification may also improve full-length gp140 secretion. Thirdly, gp120 collapsed near its expected MW of 52 kDa after treatment with N-glycosidase PNGase F, suggesting extensive N-glycosylation ( Fig. 1B and 1C ). Based on these findings, we rationally designed a JR-FL SOSIP-based gp140 (designed, or d-SOSIP) with some modifications: codons were optimized for S. cerevisiae [55] ; hydrophobic amino acids within the fusion peptide were replaced by structurally related but more hydrophilic residues, which if possible were found among circulating viral sequences (Fig. 1D) ; and lastly the Furin protease cleavage site was substituted with a yeast Kex2 recognition site, and a predicted internal Kex2 site was removed. We then compared secreted protein content in cell culture supernatant and found that d-SOSIP, but not the initial JR-FL SOSIP gp140 could be detected at significant levels. The d-SOSIP variant was significantly N-glycosylated, and collapsed after PNGase F-treatment (S1C Fig.) .
