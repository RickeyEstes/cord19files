Our research returned 278 English articles and 285 Chinese articles after removing duplications. After screening the titles and abstracts, 482 of these articles were excluded. The full texts of 81 articles were assessed, among which the control group did not receive steroid therapy (25); the article was a review (7); the study was non-SNP-related (5); the research was basic (3); the study did not report frequencies or effect size results (2); the study did not include steroid-related ONFH (2); the study was a case report (2); the research was microRNA related (2); the report was a duplicate (2); and the research was of heredity SONFH (1). Finally, we collected 30 trials assessing 7,553 patients for our meta-analysis (Table 1, Figure 1) . All studies used a case-control design except one that used a cohort design (Karol et al., 2015) . In addition, Weibao Fang's two studies (Wei, 2011a,b) , and Kuribayashi and Tamura's studies (Tamura et al., 2007; Kuribayashi et al., 2008) included the same patient population but did not assess the same SNPs. We analyzed different SNP results and excluded duplicated results. The NOS scores were six to nine points, and the overall quality was ideal in observational studies (Table 1) . Six SNPs in four genes were included in the meta-analysis. In the ABCB1 gene, rs1045642 is also known as C3435T, is located in the coding region, and is a synonymous mutation. In this research, the pooled results for rs1045642 showed that the C > T mutation protected against SONFH in the allelic model (I 2 = 50.2%; OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55-1.00; p = 0.046) (Figure 2, Table 2 ). In the ApoB gene, rs693 is located in the coding region. The results showed that there was no significant relationship between this mutation and SONFH in the allelic model (I 2 = 58%; OR: 2.63; 95% CI: 0.92-7.54; p = 0.072). However, other models showed that this mutation could increase SONFH risk (heterozygous model: I 2 = 54.5%; OR: 2.46; 95% (Figure 2 , Table 2 ). The level of evidence of the above positive results was assessed according to GRADE guidelines. The allelic model of ABCB1 rs1045642 showed a protective effect against SONFH. In these results, 1,141 patients were included; the average NOS score was 7.88. Although the SE was relatively small, there was heterogeneity (I 2 = 50.2%, p = 0.02). Thus, the level of evidence was very low (Figure 3 ). The heterozygous model and dominant model of ApoB rs693 showed that the mutation increases SONFH risk. The SE of the two models was smaller than 0.2, and heterogeneity was not obvious (heterozygous model: I 2 = 54.5%, p = 0.111; dominant model: I 2 = 31.40%, p = 0.212). The level of evidence was moderate because of the large effect (OR>2) (Figure 3) . The homozygous and recessive models of ApoB rs693 also showed that the mutation increases disease risk without heterogeneity (homozygous model: I 2 = 24.4%, p = 0.25; recessive model: I 2 = 32.1%, p = 0.225). Although the SEs were larger than 0.2, the OR was greater than 5. Thus, the evidence levels were also moderate (Figure 3) . In addition, the average NOS scores of these four models were 8 to 8.25. The dominant model of ApoB rs1042031 indicated that the mutation increases SONFH risk without heterogeneity (I 2 = 50.3%, p = 0.11). The SE of the result was less than 0.2, and the OR was greater than 2. Thus, the level of evidence was moderate (Figure 3) . However, the genetic linkage disequilibrium that exists in the above positive results might affect stability.
