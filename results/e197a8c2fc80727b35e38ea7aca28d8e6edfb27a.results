Clinical findings. In late December 2018, all ten cats kept at household A were brought to a veterinary hospital with reported acute depression, bloody diarrhea and bloody respiratory discharge. All 10 cats, aged from 1-3 y, had been up-to-date vaccinated for FPLV, feline calicivirus (FCV), FeLV and rabies virus (RV). Later, in the beginning of January 2019, four core-vaccinated cats, aged from 1-2 y, from household B showed clinical signs of depression, followed by diarrhea, acute hemoptysis and ataxia; while three 1-month-old non-vaccinated kittens in household C were carried to the hospital in late February 2019 due to the acute onset of depression, anorexia, bloody diarrhea, hemoptysis and seizure. Essential diagnostic tests showed severe anemia and marked leukopenia (ranging from 1,200-3,500 cells/ ÂµL) without significant changes in the blood chemistry panels in all cats. Neither protozoa nor parasitic eggs were found by microscopic fecal examination. The FeLV and FCoV antigen and FIV antibody tests all revealed negative results, while the FPLV antigen rapid test kits were positive. No evidence of detectable warfarin and organophosphate derivatives were observed in both the urine and feces samples. Bacterial cultures from nasal and fecal swabs in randomized cats from households A and B showed isolated Klebsiella sp. and Escherichia coli growth, respectively. However, no relevant findings in the aerobic bacterial cultures of the oral swab samples of cats from household C were found. All 10 cats from household A did not respond to supportive treatment with antibiotics and fluid therapy, and decompensated over the course of 48 h. Including the cats and kittens in households B and C, 13 of the 17 affected cats died. Based on the availability of the owner's consent, three of these moribund cats (one from each household, where cat no.1 to 3 was from household A to C, respectively) were submitted for necropsy and pathological examination. The FBoV-1 infected cat status, household of origin and sampling procedure are summarized in Fig. 1 . Postmortem examination and histopathology. The prominent gross findings of all necropsied cats revealed severe hemorrhage in various organs, including the brain, lung, liver, intestinal tract and lymph nodes. Their morphological diagnoses were severe acute diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage (Fig. 2a) , segmental hemorrhagic enteritis with massive hemorrhagic lymphadenopathy (Fig. 2b,c) , petechial hemorrhagic encephalitis (Fig. 2d) , and necrotizing hemorrhagic hepatitis. The degree of severity of systemic hemorrhage varied among the cats. With respect to the histopathology, representative sections of the brain, lung, heart, tongue, stomach, small and large intestine, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes from three cats (no.1-3), designated 18R217C, 19R81C and 19R124C, respectively, were examined. The morphological findings were broadly similar among all three examined moribund cats. Changes in the small intestine were severe and included extensive villous blunting and fusion along with crypt necrosis. Large, amphophilic, intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed in rare crypt epithelial cells (Fig. 2f) . In the ileum, spleen, and lymph nodes, the numbers of lymphoid follicles were markedly depleted with variable accumulations of fibrin, karyorrhectic debris, and aggregates of histiocytes within the center of the remaining lymphoid follicles (Fig. 2h) . In cat nos. 2 (19R81C) and 3 (19R124C) , the lungs were markedly congested with multifocal to diffuse histio-lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, and the perivascular spaces of many pulmonary vessels were markedly edematous (Fig. 2e) . In cat no. 1 (18R217C), the lung was edematous, and had patchy hemorrhages with increased numbers of circulating neutrophils throughout the alveolar capillaries. In cat no. 3, the liver had random foci of hepatic necrosis with multifocal areas of lobular collapse. In addition, biliary hyperplasia was noted. In cat nos. 1 and 2, the microscopic findings of the liver were within normal histologic limits. For the heart, there were small hemorrhagic foci observed in cat no. 1. Interestingly, cat no. 1 had vascular changes in the cerebrum and cerebellum that were characterized by engorged blood vessels containing variable numbers of PAS-and Alcian blue-negative, eosinophilic, homogenous globular material and an expansion of the perivascular Robin-Virchow space ( Fig. 2i) with open spaces containing variable amounts of eosinophilic flocculent material intermixed with rare, small, proteinaceous droplets ( Fig. 2i, inset) . The affected blood vessels were lined by plump reactive or occasionally pyknotic endothelial cells. General virology. Initially, the pan-PCR panels specific for respiratory and intestinal viruses, including herpesvirus, paramyxovirus, calicivirus, coronavirus and parvovirus, were performed on the fecal extracted total viral RNA/DNA samples (n = 17). These showed positive results only with the pan-parvovirus PCR. However, the pan-BoV PCR revealed positive results in only seven fecal samples (41.2%), with three, two and two being from household A, B, and C, respectively. To complete the investigation, viral detection in fresh frozen tissue samples (rather than FFPE samples) of all three dead cats was examined by pan-viral PCRs. Positive pan-BoV PCR results were observed in the lung, lymph nodes and intestine of all cats. On the other hand, positive pan-parvovirus PCR results were noted only in the intestinal and mesenteric lymph node samples with no evidence in the other organs. Pan-PCRs for the other viruses were negative in all tissue samples.
