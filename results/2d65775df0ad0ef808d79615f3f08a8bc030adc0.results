Of 2316 respiratory specimens tested in the study period (1510 ResPlex II, 806 RVP FAST), at least one respiratory virus was detected in 1065 (46.0%). The most commonly detected virus was entero/rhinoviruses (498, 21.5%), followed by RSV (267, 11.5%), influenza A viruses (88, 3.8%), bocaviruses (85, 3.7%), PIV (83, 3.6%), HMPV (71, 3.1%), coronaviruses (54, 2.3%), adenoviruses (47, 2.0%) and influenza B viruses (13, 0.6%). While most seasonal viruses like RSV and influenza A and B viruses were found mainly during winter months, entero/rhinoviruses were detected in similar numbers throughout the study period ( Fig. 1) . Of the 498 entero/rhinovirus positive respiratory specimens, 248 (50%) had residual sample available for typing. In several instances multiple specimens were collected from one patient. In order to account for this, specimens belonging to the same infection episode (defined as identical virus by sequencing) in a patient were excluded. This resulted in a total of 204 episodes of entero/rhinoviral infection in 195 patients (median age 0.98 year, interquartile range (IQR) 1.79 years) of which 163 (79.9%) were in children under the age of 3 (median age 0.67 year, IQR 0.91 years). The main virus was HRV-C with 99 infection episodes (48.5%) followed by 60 HRV-A (29.4%), 15 enteroviruses (7.3%) and 8 HRV-B (3.9%). In 22 episodes (10.8%), the sequencing of VP4/VP2 failed despite the use of degenerate primers. Although 5 NCR sequences were available, they were not suitable for typing [16] and were Table 1 Univariate analysis of respiratory viral co-pathogens and non-viral co-pathogens.
