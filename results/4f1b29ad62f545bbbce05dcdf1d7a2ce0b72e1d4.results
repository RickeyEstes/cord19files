Production of retroviral particles pseudotyped with influenza A ⁄ Vietnam ⁄ 1194 ⁄ 04 HA Retroviral (MLV) and lentiviral (HIV) vector particles pseudotyped with Influenza A ⁄ Viet Nam ⁄ 1194 ⁄ 2004 HA were made by cotransfection of an HA-expressing plasmid, pI.18 ⁄ VN1194 HA, with plasmids encoding gag-pol and GFP or Luc vector genome in 293T cells (Figure 1a) . Culture supernatants were used to infect human 293T cells as a representative human cell line, canine MDCK cells as the preferred cell line for culturing influenza viruses, QT6 quail cells and porcine PK15 and ST-IOWA cells as potential mixing vessels for human and avian influenza viruses. 25, 26 VSV-G-pseudotyped particles were used as a positive control and infected all cell lines tested (data not shown). MLV(HA) pseudotypes infected all cell lines tested with the highest titer obtained on 293T cells (5 · 10 6 IU ⁄ ml), while HIV(HA) titers on human, canine and quail cells were broadly equivalent to MLV(HA) titers (Figure 1b) . The titer of MLV(HA)-Luc on 293T cells was 1.6 · 10 7 RLU ⁄ ml. All neutralization assays were performed using MLV(HA) pseudotypes on 293T cells as the most effective combination.
