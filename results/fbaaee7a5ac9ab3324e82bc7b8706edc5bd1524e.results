Replication-competent controlled HSV-1 vectors. The two-component HSP promoter-based gene switch employed in the vectors in the present study relied on the transactivator GLP65, which is activated by a narrow class of antiprogestins, including mifepristone and ulipristal (31, (33) (34) (35) . GLP65 is a chimeric protein consisting of a DNA-binding domain from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor GAL4, a truncated ligand-binding domain from a human progesterone receptor, and a transcriptional activation domain from human NF-B protein P65. A DNA segment con-GAL4-responsive promoters (Fig. 1B) . In vector HSV-GS7, the replication-essential late gene UL38/VP19c had been subjected to gene switch control by replacement of its promoter with a GAL4-responsive promoter. Replication of HSV-GS3 had previously been shown to be strictly dependent on activation by heat and antiprogestin in single-step growth experiments (35) . When activated, the recombinant replicated nearly as efficiently as the wild-type virus, 17synϩ. When administered to the footpads of mice, HSV-GS3 replicated only subsequent to an activating treatment with locally administered heat in the presence of systemic antiprogestin. The results of a single-step growth experiment with HSV-GS7 are shown in Fig. 1C . The recombinant replicated approximately as well as HSV-GS3 following heat treatment in the presence of the antiprogestin ulipristal (35) . No replication was observed after either heat or antiprogestin treatment or in the absence of any treatment. To verify that HSV-GS7 replication was also tightly controlled in vivo, two of three groups of mice were administered HSV-GS7 virus (50,000 PFU per mouse) in the footpads, and the mice of one of the groups were given ulipristal intraperitoneally (i,p.) and, 3 h later, were subjected to a heat treatment to the footpads at 45°C for 10 min. One day later, all the mice were euthanized, and DNA and RNA were extracted from their feet and analyzed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and RT-qPCR, respectively. Substantially larger amounts of HSV-1 DNA were detected in the feet of heat/ulipristal-treated mice than in untreated mice (Fig. 1D ). Expression of several viral genes was observed for activated virus, but not for unactivated virus, strongly suggesting that viral replication and gene expression occurred only subsequent to heat/ ulipristal activation. Protective immunity induced by activated HSV-GS3. Induction of protective immunity was evaluated in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model (36) . In the first experiment, the virus vector HSV-GS3 or KD6 (an ICP4 Ϫ replication-incompetent HSV-1 recombinant [37] ) was administered under anesthesia to the plantar surfaces of both rear feet of adult Swiss Webster outbred female mice (50,000 PFU per animal; 20 animals per group). Concurrently, and again 24 h later, the animals of one of the HSV-GS3 groups received an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight mifepristone. Three hours after inoculation, the mice in this group were subjected to heat treatment (43.5°C for 30 min) by immersion of their hind feet in a temperaturecontrolled water bath. Twenty-two days later, all the animals were challenged with a 20-fold lethal dose of the HSV-1 wild-type strain 17synϩ administered by the same route as the original virus inoculum. Survival of the animals was followed until no more lethal endpoints were reached, i.e., until all surviving animals had fully recovered (Fig.  2 ). KD6 induced a modest level of immunity. As had been expected, because it did not replicate and also did not express the major transcriptional regulator ICP4, unactivated HSV-GS3 provided a comparable degree of protection. Activated HSV-GS3 produced a far greater protective effect. Therefore, one round of efficient replication and/or expression of the master regulator ICP4, resulting in expression of all the viral proteins, produced a dramatic enhancement of protective immunity. It was noted that the heat and antiprogestin treatment had no systematic effect on the level of protection induced by the replication-defective virus KD6 (see "Statistical evaluation of data from all comparable experiments" below). To determine whether immunization with activated HSV-GS3 reduced replication of the challenge virus more effectively than unactivated HSV-GS3 or the replication-defective KD6 virus, additional groups of animals (5 animals per group) were immunized and challenged with wild-type virus as described above. Four days after challenge, the animals were euthanized, their feet were dissected and homogenized, and virus present in the homogenates was titrated on rabbit skin (RS) cells. The results revealed that activated HSV-GS3 reduced challenge virus replication by nearly 2 orders of magnitude (6. We next examined in a similar experiment whether induction of enhanced protective immunity was caused by activation of the heat-and antiprogestin-dependent gene switch that controls the expression of ICP4 and ICP8 in the HSV-GS3 recombinant. In this and all subsequent experiments, ulipristal was utilized instead of mifepristone because the former compound is a more active gene switch coactivator than the latter compound (35) . Furthermore, the heat treatment regimen was changed to heat exposure at 45°C for 10 min to achieve greater reproducibility between experiments. The results revealed that enhanced protection was achieved only following activation of HSV-GS3 by heat treatment in the presence of ulipristal (Fig. 3 ). Heat treatment alone or ulipristal alone did not significantly increase the protective effect over that produced by the unactivated virus. These findings strongly suggested that it was the activation of the dual-responsive gene switch in HSV-GS3 that prompted the expression of the regulated replication-essential genes, as well as efficient virus replication that in turn resulted in the observed enhanced protective response. Note that in this experiment the virus inoculum was 500,000 PFU rather than 50,000 PFU, as in most other experiments (Table 1 and Fig. 2 , 4, and 5A; see Fig. 7 and 8). This may account for the somewhat elevated level of protection induced by unactivated HSV-GS3 and KD6. HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 induce comparable protective responses. The greatly enhanced protective response that resulted from transient activation of the gene switch in HSV-GS3-immunized animals could have been due to the efficient virus replication triggered by the activation and/or to the activation of the genes for the major transcription regulator ICP4, which in turn stimulated expression of all the other viral genes in primarily infected cells. Another question was related to whether abundant viral gene expression in secondarily infected cells (which may include antigenpresenting cells) could further enhance the immune response. Since the ICP4 genes are regulated in HSV-GS3, little expression of viral genes was expected to occur in the absence of another activating treatment. Recombinant HSV-GS7 in which the late VP19c gene had been subjected to regulation was constructed to examine these issues. HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 were compared in the mouse footpad challenge model. The results revealed that activated HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 provided similar levels of pro- Table 1 and Fig. 6 for information from comparable experiments. tection (Fig. 4) . In the absence of activation, the protective effect of either recombinant was modest. Taking data from other experiments into account, the average protective effect for unactivated HSV-GS3 was 22% and that for unactivated HSV-GS7 was 13% (see "Statistical evaluation of data from all comparable experiments" below). The fact that the two recombinants that lacked expression of different proteins in the absence of activation induced comparable (modest) protective responses strongly suggested that it was not the absence of one or the other viral protein that limited the immune response to the recombinants. It was instead the vigorous replication of the activated recombinants that enhanced the protective responses against them. In secondarily infected cells (in which HSF1 was not activated), HSV-GS7 was expected to express all viral proteins except the regulated capsid protein at approximately normal levels. In contrast, HSV-GS3 all but lacked ICP4 expression in the absence of activation and exhibited dramatically curtailed expression of other viral proteins (35) . The finding that HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 induced comparable protective responses suggested that viral proteins expressed in secondarily infected cells did not contribute in a relevant fashion to the immune response. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the immune system was sufficiently sensitive to detect the very low levels of viral antigen expression occurring in cells secondarily infected with HSV-GS3. A second immunization further enhances protective immunity. We next investigated whether a second activation treatment applied 2 days after the first treatment (i.e., at a time at which the initial round of replication of HSV-GS7 should have been completed) or a second immunization would further enhance protection against wild-type virus challenge. The second immunization was administered 3 weeks after the initial virus application. Booster virus was either activated or left unactivated. As shown in Fig. 5A , groups of mice were immunized with 50,000 PFU/animal of recombinant HSV-GS7. Activation of the virus induced an immune response that protected 75% of the animals after challenge with wild-type virus. After the second immunization with a similar dose of HSV-GS7, all the animals were protected. However, this occurred only if the booster virus was also subjected to an activating treatment. A second activation after a single dose of HSV-GS7 had no apparent effect. As effects of reimmunization may be more apparent in mice immunized with smaller quantities of virus, the experiment also featured parallel groups of animals that were immunized and boosted with 5,000 PFU/animal of recombinant HSV-GS7. As Fig. 5B documents, a second immunization followed by virus activation had an even more pronounced effect at the 10-fold-reduced virus doses. It was noted that in this part of the experiment a second activation appeared to modestly enhance the protective immune response (not statistically significant). Statistical evaluation of data from all comparable experiments. Relevant data from all immunization/challenge experiments that were conducted using essentially identical protocols are assembled in Table 1 . The results of a meta-analysis of the HSV-GS7 data are presented graphically in Fig. 6 . The difference in immunization efficacy between activated and unactivated HSV-GS7 was found to be highly significant. Also significant was the increase in protection afforded by a second immunization with an activated HSV-GS7 vector. The effect of the second activation 2 days after virus administration and the first activation was not statistically relevant. Immune correlates of protection against challenge. The presence and levels of antibodies capable of neutralizing HSV-1 strain 17synϩ were assessed in sera of mice that had been treated with activated or unactivated HSV-GS vectors or with the replication-incompetent virus KD6 (all at 50,000 PFU per animal) 3 weeks earlier. As expected, neutralizing antibodies could be detected subsequent to immunization with KD6 or unactivated HSV-GS (Fig. 7A ).

Activation, regional heat treatment at 45°C for 10 min in the systemic presence of an anti-progestin (50 g/kg ulipristal in most experiments.). Challenge, 10,000 PFU HSV-1 strain 17synϩ.

Data relating to incomplete activation (heat treatment only, or antiprogestin only) were omitted. unactivated HSV-GS vector-immunized animals were comparable. Both activated HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7 induced neutralizing antibody responses clearly superior to those induced by unactivated HSV-GS3 or HSV-GS7 or by KD6. To assess cellular immune responses, HSV-1-specific responder cells present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of mice that had been immunized 3 weeks earlier were quantified by a modified limiting dilution lymphoproliferation assay. Both unactivated HSV-GS vectors and KD6 virus were found to be capable of inducing detectable levels of HSV-1-specific responder cells (Fig. 7B ). Substantially better responses were produced by activated HSV-GS3 and HSV-GS7. Immune responses to a heterologous antigen presented in the context of vigorous viral replication. To evaluate immune responses to a heterologous antigen expressed from an HSV-GS vector, recombinant HSV-GS11 was constructed. The recombinant was derived from HSV-GS3 by the insertion in the UL37-UL38 intergenic region of an expression cassette comprising a gene for an equine influenza virus (EIV) hemagglutinin (HA) (EIV Prague/56 HA) functionally linked to a cytomegalovirus (CMV) (immediate-early) promoter (Fig. 8A) . Expression of the influenza virus gene was verified in groups of adult female BALB/c mice inoculated on the rear footpads with either saline, HSV-GS3, or HSV-GS11 (50,000 PFU per animal). The HSV-GS3 group, as well as one of the HSV-GS11 groups, was subjected to activation treatment. Another HSV-GS11 group underwent an activation treatment twice; the second treatment was administered 2 days after the first treatment. One day after the last treatment, the animals were euthanized, and RNA was extracted from one hind foot and protein from the other. The results from an RT-qPCR analysis of HA gene expression are shown in Fig.  8B and the results from an EIV Prague/56 HA-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in Fig. 8C . HA RNA and HA could be detected in samples from HSV-GS11inoculated animals, most abundantly when the animals had been subjected to activation treatment. Both HA RNA and protein levels appeared to be somewhat higher in twice-activated animals than in once-activated animals. To assess immune responses, additional groups of mice were inoculated with saline (mock immunization) or with 50,000 PFU of HSV-GS3 or HSV-GS11 (three groups). All the animals in the HSV-GS3 group and in two of the HSV-GS11 groups were subjected FIG 4 Immunization with HSV-1 replication-competent controlled recombinant HSV-GS7 and comparison with HSV-GS3. Mice were inoculated on both rear feet with 50,000 PFU/mouse of either HSV-GS3 or HSV-GS7 or were mock immunized with saline. For each recombinant, one group of animals was subjected to heat treatment in the presence of ulipristal as described in the legend to Fig. 3 (activated) and another group did not receive this treatment (unactivated). At 21 days postinoculation, all the mice were challenged with a 20-fold lethal dose of wild-type HSV-1 strain 17synϩ applied to both rear feet. The data are presented as percent survival for each treatment group (n ϭ 20 for each HSV-GS3 or HSV-GS7 group; n ϭ 10 for the mock-immunized group; ***, P Յ 0.05). See Table 1 and Fig. 6 for information from comparable experiments. to an activation treatment. The animals of one of the HSV-GS11 groups received a second activation treatment 2 days later. All the animals were sacrificed 21 days postimmunization. Serum samples were tested for their ability to neutralize EIV Prague/ 56. As expected, neutralizing antibodies were not detected in unimmunized (not shown), mock-immunized, or vector-immunized animals (Fig. 8D) . Unactivated HSV-GS11 was capable of inducing a modest neutralizing antibody response. Activation of HSV-GS11 shortly after inoculation resulted in a severalfold-magnified response. It was noted that twice-activated HSV-GS11 elicited a response only marginally better than that elicited by once-activated virus (not statistically significant). HA-specific responder cells present in PBMCs were quantified by the same type of responder cell frequency (RCF) assay that had been used to assess the numbers of HSV-1-specific responder cells. ; activated on day 1 and reactivated 2 days later (activated ϩ 2nd activation; n ϭ 20); activated on day 1 and readministered 50,000 PFU/mouse of HSV-GS7 21 days later (activated ϩ boost; n ϭ 10); or activated on day 1, readministered 50,000 PFU/mouse of HSV-GS7 21 days after the first inoculation, and reactivated 3 h later (activated ϩ boost ϩ 2nd activation; n ϭ 10). Twenty-one days after the last treatment, all the mice were challenged with a 20-fold lethal dose of wild-type HSV-1 strain 17synϩ applied to both rear feet. **, P Յ 0.05; ***, P Ͻ 0.01. (B) Similar to panel A, except both initial and second immunizations were 5,000 PFU/mouse of HSV-GS7 (n ϭ 10; for the second immunization, n ϭ 20) (***, P Յ 0.05). The data are presented as percent survival for each treatment group. See Table 1 and Fig. 6 for information on comparable experiments. HA-specific responder cells were not detected in unimmunized (not shown) or mockimmunized (Fig. 8E) animals. Induction of a cellular immune response was observed in animals immunized with HSV-GS11 but not subjected to an activation treatment. An activated vector (HSV-GS3) produced a similar response. Far greater numbers of HA-specific responder cells were found in animals immunized with once-or twiceactivated HSV-GS11.
