The frequency of pathogens identified in samples of sand obtained from parks is shown in Table 1 . There was no statistical difference (p >0.05) between the presence of the different pathogens in the parks sampled. E. coli and R. equi strains were the most common pathogens isolated throughout the study. R. equi strains were isolated in 23 (11.5%) sand samples. None of the R. equi isolates showed virulent (vapA gene) or intermediately virulent (vapB gene) plasmid profiles. Sixty-three (31.5%) strains of E. coli were identified. The following virulence factor genes were identified in the E. coli strains: eae, bfp, saa, iucD, papGI, sfa and hly. Phylogenetic classification showed that the 63 E. coli isolates belonged to groups B1 (52.4%), A (25.4%) and B2 (22.2%). No E. coli serotype O157:H7 was identified ( Table 2) . Eggs of Toxocara spp. were recovered only in three of the parks. Genetic material of bovine Coronavirus was identified in one public park (Table 1) , as suggested by the sequencing analysis of the 136 bp amplicon obtained in one sample (data not show). No Salmonella spp. or Rotavirus isolates were identified in the samples of sand.
