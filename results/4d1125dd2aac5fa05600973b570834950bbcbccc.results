Early peripheral blood expression of AKAP7 is associated with the development of post-stroke BBB disruption. In order to determine the relationships between the expression levels of the 16 stroke-associated candidate genes and post-stroke BBB disruption, we first recruited a modestly sized discovery cohort consisting of 27 acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Peripheral whole blood samples were obtained at emergency department admission and transcriptional profiling was performed via microarray. BBB permeability was assessed via level of HARM (none, mild, moderate, or severe) on perfusion-weighted imaging at 24 hour follow up (Fig. 1) . We then employed bias-reduced logistic regression using forward stepwise variable selection to determine whether early expression levels of any the 16 candidate genes were predictive for the development of poststroke severe HARM. The median time from symptom onset to blood draw across all discovery cohort subjects was 7.4 hours. In terms of clinical and demographics characteristics, patients presenting with severe HARM at 24 follow up were significantly older and displayed a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia relative to patients presenting with lower levels of HARM (Table 1) . Furthermore, a higher proportion of patients presenting with severe HARM received thrombolytic intervention via recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) than those presenting with lower levels of HARM, however this difference was not statistically significant. Of the 16 candidate genes, only the total expression levels of AKAP7, a gene encoding a protein kinase A (PKA)-binding scaffolding molecule known as A kinase anchoring protein 7 (AKAP7), were significantly associated with the development of post-stroke severe HARM after controlling for age, dyslipidemia, and rtPA (p = 0.025*, Odds ratio = 4.0, 95% confidence interval = 1.1-56.8, Fig. 2A ). Specifically, elevated whole blood expression levels of total AKAP7 at emergency department admission were associated with increased degree of HARM at 24 hour follow up (Fig. 2B) . Furthermore, early total expression levels of AKAP7 showed a modest ability to predict post-stroke BBB disruption, demonstrating 100% sensitivity (95% confidence interval = 63.1-100%) and 68.1% specificity (95% confidence interval = 43.5-87.0%) for the development of severe HARM (Fig. 2C ). AKAP7 exhibits strong co-expression with ITGA3 in peripheral blood following stroke. In order to gain insight into the possible role of AKAP7 in the context of post stroke BBB disruption, we next performed a genome-wide correlational analysis in which the correlation coefficients between the expression levels of AKAP7 and each of the other 18,000 genes detected via microarray were calculated. Genes were then ranked based on the absolute strength of relationship between their expression levels and those of AKAP7. We theorized that genes which were strongly co-expressed with AKAP7 would likely be mechanistically related. ITGA3, which encodes a cellular adhesion molecule known as integrin alpha 3 (ITGA3), was the only gene in the dataset whose expression levels were significantly correlated with those of AKAP7 (Fig. 3A) , exhibiting a robust positive association Scientific RepoRts | 7: 1172 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-017-01178-5 ( Fig. 3B) . Furthermore, like AKAP7, early expression levels of ITAG3 at were positively associated with the development of post-stroke severe HARM in a post-hoc logistic regression analysis controlling for age, dyslipidemia, and rtPA (p = 0.045*, Odds ratio = 3.5, 95% confidence interval = 1.0-28.4). Due to the established role of ITGA3 in mediating leukocyte extravasation 19 , we hypothesized that AKAP7 may be functionally involved in ITGA3 mediated leukocyte trafficking post-stroke. Established and bioinformatically predicted AKAP7 splice variants are expressed in the peripheral immune system and appear to be inversely regulated. It is well established that AKAP7 is subject to alternative splicing, however, little is known about the expression of these splice variants in the peripheral immune system. AKAP7 codes for three splice variants which are known to generate functional scaffolding proteins (AKAP7α, AKAP7β, AKAP7γ) with varying biological activity within the context of PKA signaling 20 . In addition to these established splice variants, AKAP7 may also code for as many as six bioinformatically predicated alternatively spliced transcripts (AKAP7x1, AKAP7x2, AKAP7x3, AKAP7x4, AKAP7x5, AKAP7x6) 21 . In order to determine which AKAP7 splice variants were responsible for the coregulatory relationship we observed with ITGA3, we first aimed to identify which AKAP7 splice variants are expressed in the peripheral immune system. Primers specific to each established and predicated splice variant were designed based on variant-specific priming sites (Fig. 4A ) and RT-PCR was used to probe for the presence of expression in peripheral whole blood samples obtained from two stroke patients and two healthy subjects. PCR products were detected for all tested AKAP7 splice variants in all samples (Fig. 4B) , providing direct evidence that all established and previously bioinformatically predicted AKAP7 splice variants are expressed in the peripheral immune system. Where possible, a second set of primers was used to validate the expression of previously predicted variants (Supplementary Figure 1A) . Once we identified that all established and previously predicted AKAP7 splice variants are expressed in the peripheral immune system, the expression levels of each splice variant were measured in parallel with those of ITGA3 in the peripheral blood of an identically recruited independent validation cohort of AIS patients using qRT-PCR (Table 2 ). In this second cohort of patients, early expression levels of AKAP7α, AKAP7β, and AKAP7γ exhibited significant positive correlations with expression levels of ITGA3 ( Fig. 5A-C) . Interestingly, all previously predicted AKAP7 splice variants displayed inversely related expression levels with regards to ITGA3 ( Fig. 5D -H) as well as the established AKAP7 splice variants (Supplementary Figure 2) . These data suggest that the strong positive relationship between AKAP7 and ITGA3 expression observed in the first cohort of patients was primarily driven by AKAP7α, AKAP7β, and AKAP7γ. This is feasible due to the fact that the previously predicted AKAP7 splice variants appeared to be expressed at much lower levels than those of the established splice variants, as indicated by higher CT values in qRT-PCR (data not shown) and the production of significantly less PCR product in standard RT-PCR when using primers designed for co-amplification (Supplementary Figure 1B) . Interestingly, AKAP7α, AKAP7β, and AKAP7γ all encode for scaffolding proteins with the ability to bind PKA 20 , while the remaining splice variants are predicted to undergo non-sense mediated decay or generate scaffolding proteins which lack a PKA binding domain (Supplementary Figure 3) . Collectively, the data validate the relationship between ITGA3 and AKAP7 observed in the discovery cohort, and suggest dynamic regulation between the PKA-binding and non-PKA-binding AKAP7 variants. Thus, the ratio between the expression levels of these splice variants may be more diagnostically robust than the expression levels of total AKAP7 alone. PKA-binding AKAP7 isoforms are highly expressed on lymphocytes in peripheral blood. To gain further insight into the possible functional role of AKAP7 in the context of post-stroke BBB disruption, we next looked to determine the cellular source of AKAP7 in the peripheral immune system. qRT-PCR was used to measure the expression levels of the AKAP7 splice variants in RNA extracted from isolated leukocyte subpopulations obtained from the peripheral blood of three healthy donors using immuno-magnetic negative selection. Expression levels of the PKA-binding AKAP7 isoforms appeared to be significantly higher on cells of lymphoid origin ( Fig. 6 ), leading us to hypothesize that AKAP7 levels may serve as a marker of post-stroke lymphocyte trafficking specifically.
