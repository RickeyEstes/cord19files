We randomly selected 2854 residents using an ageand gender-stratified sampling method from the household registration record and attempted to contact each person by telephone. We excluded subjects who were not living in Kaohsiung City during the epidemic. The most frequent reasons given for refusal to participate were "tired of being interviewed" and reluctance to disclose personal information for fear of discrimination. We successfully interviewed and obtained blood samples from 1030 residents (36.1%). None of the subjects had a clinical diagnosis of SARS or had been quarantined during the epidemic. A total of 258 (25%) subjects had underlying diseases, most of which (249/258; 96.5%) were mild to moderate. We defined "mild to moderate underlying diseases" (e.g. allergic diseases, atopic dermatitis, hepatitis B) as diseases that were not life-threatening, or that did not result in immunodeficiency. We analyzed factors associated with SARS-CoV infection and stratified the results by age (Table 1) . Forty subjects reported contact with quarantined person(s). In most cases (33/40; 82.5%), they were students whose classmates had family members working in Kaohsiung CGMH during the epidemic. The two patients with SARS-CoV seropositivity (as confirmed by IFA) reported no contact with quarantined persons during the epidemic. None of the quarantined persons who had contact with our subjects were diagnosed as SARSprobable cases during the epidemic. Analysis of other selected factors associated with SARS revealed that only 17 The age-specific SARS-CoV seropositivity rates after the epidemic are shown in Table 2 . Of the 124 persons with a seropositive ELISA, nearly 98% (121/124) were younger than 19 years of age. We used the IFA method to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV in all subjects who had a positive ELISA result. IFA confirmed SARS-CoV in two of the 124 cases, both of whom were under 19 years of age. We found no SARS-related risk profiles or signs of respiratory tract infection in these two patients during the 3 months after the epidemic.
