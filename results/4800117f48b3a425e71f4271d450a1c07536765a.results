We previously showed that HPIV3 HRC-derived sequences interact with HPIV3 F and NiV F HRN, that antiviral potency can be improved by sequence engineering and cholesterol conjugation, and that peptides without linkers between the protein and lipid component are less potent than those with a 4 polyethylene glycol (PEG) linker in the intervening region 6, 8 . Here we investigated the impact of the peptide orientation, as well as the influence of the PEG linker length, on the peptide antiviral efficacy. We focus on PEG linkers for exploration of these mechanisms since PEG features a number of characteristics that may be critical for tissue penetration of cholesterol-tagged peptides. PEG is soluble in both aqueous and organic media, and thus compatible with both plasma/extracellular fluids and membrane environment. Unlike alkyl linkers, PEG linkers do not cause aggregation and precipitation in the compounds in which they are incorporated. PEG is used to prevent non-specific adsorption onto hydrophobic surfaces, being non-toxic and non-immunogenic. The amino acid sequence and the modifications introduced into the peptides used for this study are shown in Fig. 1a . The entire set of peptides used here is based on a single peptide with the "VG" sequence, which has E549V 9 and Q479G introduced into our published HPIV3 F HRC-derived peptide 10 . As for the previously reported NiV, HPIV3 and HIV inhibitors 10 , reaction of the core sequence with a bromoacetyl derivative of cholesterol featuring a 4, 12 or 24-unit PEG spacer (PEG 4, 12 or 24 ) or without linker produced the cholesterol-conjugated monomer. The peptide with the "VG" sequence and a 24-unit PEG spacer before the cholesterol (called VG-PEG24-Chol) is shown in Fig. 1b .
