MPERT opened at 4 PM on May 1, 2009, and 49 children were cared for by 1 physician in the first 8 hours. In a 7-day period, MPERT experienced 18% of the ED volume (total of 356 patients), a median of 48 patients daily, peaking at 83 patients on May 3, 2009 ( Figure 1 ). This partially compensated for the increased patient volume of 120 (50% excess) children over the baseline flow observed in the springtime. Despite the increase in volume, with MPERT wait time (triage time to room) and time in department (arrival time to discharge from ED) in the ED for all patients and for all triage levels decreased (Table) . All MPERT patients were discharged home. The percentage of patients who left without being seen decreased by 44% (from 143 to 81 patients) with the opening of MPERT, and only 3 (Ͻ1%) of MPERT patients left without being seen (PϽ.001). Sixteen children (4.5% of MPERT volume) were mistriaged and had to return to another section of the ED for additional evaluation; reasons included 9 children needing additional laboratory evaluation, 5 requiring intravenous fluids, and 2 requiring breathing treatments. Of these 16, 3 stayed overnight in the observation unit (2 with dehydration; 1 with wheezing) and 1 child with pneumonia and hypoxemia was admitted to the inpatient unit. At the onset of the study, patients were being liberally screened for influenza. Three hundred sixty-nine rapid influenza assays were performed in the week preceding MPERT (13 Figure 1 and the Table are due to exclusion of children being actively resuscitated (triage level I) and children who left the ED before triage from the algorithm. † The natural logarithm of TID is presented here. If the 95% CI of the natural logarithm crosses 0, there is no statistically significant difference in TID. With decreasing patient volumes (Figure 1) , the decision was made to change MPERT staffing to 12 hours on May 7, 2009 , and ultimately closed on that date, after 7 operational days. Despite MPERT closing, additional physician coverage was provided in the ED for the next 2 days for any unanticipated surge in patient volume; because no such surge was observed, staffing returned to baseline. Despite Texas Children's Hospital's reporting the first US pediatric death, the overall morbidity of disease in Houston children was minimal, with no hospitalized child having confirmed swine H1N1 as of May 8, 2009 . However, 29 children with fever and viral respiratory symptoms were empirically isolated, with airborne and contact precautions, despite negative rapid influenza testing results. The total percentage of patients admitted from the ED was 14%, lower than the 17% admission rate ordinarily observed at Texas Children's Hospital. The lower admission rate was due to the high volume of low-acuity patients. The cost of MPERT was approximately $280,000 above expected ED costs, of which $135,000 was supplemental staff pay and $113,000 was MPERT construction and additional laboratory and medical supplies. However, this does not reflect the overall savings to the hospital from decreased time in department and decreased elopements.
