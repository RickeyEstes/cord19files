There was a reduction in the hemoglobin and hematocrit values in the infected group compared to the control group, mainly after the 45 dai when animals started to eliminate the larvae (prepatent period) and on the acute phase of the clinical manifestations. However, significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) were observed from the 20 to 130 dai mainly group B and control (Fig. 1A) . A decrease was also observed in the hematocrit values on 45, 100 and 130 dai for groups A and B compared to control. No difference was observed on 72 dai between groups A and control (Fig. 1B) . The mean numbers of immature neutrophils from 45 to 160 dai, in the infected groups A and B compared to the control. Significant differences were observed between A and control group on 45, 100, 130 and 160 dai (p ≤ 0.05); while between B and control groups significant differences were observed on 45 and 100 dai only (p ≤ 0.05). Significant difference was also detected between the A and B groups on 100 dai (p ≤ 0.05) ( Fig. 2A) . Segmented neutrophils values did not show significant differences when the groups were compared, although a tendency to decrease was seen from 45 dai for group A (Fig. 2B) . Eosinophils counts increased in groups A and B compared to control from 10 dai at the end of the experimental period. Significant differences were observed except on 30 and 100 dai (p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 3) . The main qualitative alterations of the blood films were hypochromia and elongated platelets which were visualized from the 30 dai in both groups A and B. The platelet counts decreased in the infected groups A and B related to control from the 20 dai becoming accentuated on the 72 dai. Significant difference between infected groups and controls were observed from the 20 to 190 dai (p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 4) , this being consistent with platelets aggregation results, which was also reduced on those days. Average values of plasma PT activity in inoculated dogs were reduced from 45 to the 130 dai, returning to normal after this period. Significant difference between groups A and B compared to control were seen from 45 to 100 dai (p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 5) . Significantly higher PTT values for A and B compared to the control were observed from the 10 to 130 dai (p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 6) . Factors V and VIII activities were reduced mainly at 30 and 45 dai. Significant difference between infected groups related to control to factor V activity from 10 to 45 dai and factor VIII activity from 30 to 130 dai to groups B and C and on the 45 and 72 dai to groups A and C (p ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 7) .
