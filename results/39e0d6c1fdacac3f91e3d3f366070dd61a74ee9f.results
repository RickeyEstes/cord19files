The leading cause of death in the eastern Mediterranean region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90·3 deaths per 100 000 people). 8 It surpassed both diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory infections as the leading cause of death in 1990, increasing by 17·2%. There was a shift in main causes of death from communicable to non-communicable diseases in the region. Causes of death and their rates of change varied by country. 8 There was a change in causes of years of life lost (YLLs) from 1990 to 2013 in all countries (appendix p 9). Overall, regional YLLs decreased from 45 312 years per 100 000 people in 1990 to about 24 160 years per 100 000 people in 2013. 8 Djibouti. War was a large contributor to YLLs in Syria in 2013 (38·1% of total YLLs). 8 Overall, regional years lived with disability (YLDs) increased from 9526 years per 100 000 people in 1990 to about 10 057 years per 100 000 people in 2013. 8 Musculoskeletal disorders and mental disorders and substance abuse were major contributors to YLDs in 2013 and had the highest increase (appendix p 10). Nutritional defi ciencies (mainly iron-defi ciency anaemia) decreased in the region overall, but remained a large burden in low-income countries. For example, nutritional defi ciencies remained one of the leading causes of YLDs in Yemen although the YLDs per 100 000 people decreased slightly by 2% from 1990. 8 Overall, regional DALYs decreased from 54 838 years per 100 000 people in 1990 to about 34 217 years per 100 000 people in 2013. DALYs vary disproportionately by age and sex. Children younger than 5 years contributed to about 33% of total DALYs with a rate of 94 884 years per 100 000 people, compared with 34 217 years per 100 000 people for the general population. 8 Ischaemic heart disease was the leading A f g h a n i s t a n B a h r a i n D j i b o u t i E g y p t I r a n I r a q J o r d a n K u w a i t L e b a n o n L i b y a M o r o c c o O m a n P a k i s t a n P a le s t i n e Q a t a r S a u d i A r a b i a S o m a li a S u d a n S y r i a T u n i s i a U n i t e d A r a b E m i r a t e s Y e m e n E a s t e r n M e d i t e r r a n e a n r e g i o n A f g h a n i s t a n B a h r a i n D j i b o u t i E g y p t I r a n I r a q J o r d a n K u w a i t L e b a n o n L i b y a M o r o c c o O m a n P a k i s t a n P a le s t i n e Q a t a r S a u d i A r a b i a S o m a li a S u d a n S y r i a T u n i s i a U n i t e d A r a b E m i r a t e s Y e m e n E a s t e r n M e d i t e r r a n e a n r e g i o n [12] [13] [14] . High blood pressure was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 2013, which increased by 83·3% from 1990 (from 8·5 million to 16·1 million DALYs; table 2; 8 however, the number of DALYs per 100 000 people increased by only 14%. High blood pressure increased from the fi fth highest cause of DALYs in 1990 to fi rst in 2013. Risk factors for DALYs varied by country, with childhood wasting as the leading cause in Somalia, Afghanistan, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause of DALYs in Djibouti. Conversely, noncommunicable disease risk factors were the leading cause of DALYs in high-income countries and middleincome countries (fi gure 1). DALY risk factors varied by age; child malnutrition and suboptimal breastfeeding aff ected the younger age groups (aged 7 days to 4 years) and high bodyweight and systolic blood pressure aff ected the older age groups (aged 60-80 years; appendix p 2). The annualised rates of change for DALY risk factors by burden for the region, low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries are shown in the appendix (pp 3-6). DALYs per 100 000 people attributed to high body-mass index increased by 28% from 1990 to 2013 (from 1961 years per 100 000 people to 2506 years per 100 000 people) and accounted for over 7·3% of total DALYs. 8 For high-income countries, high fasting plasma glucose, high body-mass index, alcohol use, and drug use accounted for the highest annual increase with a high DALYs burden. Decomposition tables for the impact of ageing and population growth on the changes in DALYs from communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, and injuries for the region are shown in table 3, and in the appendix (pp 18-21) for low-income, middleincome, and high-income countries. DALYs caused by non-communicable diseases and injuries increased (mainly because of population growth), whereas DALYs caused by communicable diseases decreased, although the actual rates of DALYs decreased for all risk factors (table 3) . Projected life expectancy using fi gures from 2009 until 2013, based on the trends observed from 1990 to 2008 compared with observed life expectancy from GBD 2013 are shown in fi gures 2 and 3. From 1990 to 2010, Egypt, Libya, Syria, and Yemen had a steady increase in life expectancy of about 0·25 years per year, with a slightly higher increase in females (about 0·3 years) than in males. However, Egypt, Tunisia, and Yemen have lost about 0·25 years of life expectancy due to the uprising that began in 2010. When comparing observed life expectancy to expected life expectancy if no crisis had occurred, we found a large decrease in life expectancy in Libya of more than 9 years for males and 6 years for females. Conversely, a steady decrease in life expectancy was observed in Syria because of the continuing war. Therefore, between 1990 and 2013 life expectancy for Syria would have been 6 years higher than observed for males and 5 years higher for females had the crisis not happened. Moreover, our analyses showed that several countries in the region have experienced a slow-down in lowering infant mortality rate. For example, in Syria the annualised rate of reduction in infant mortality between 2010 to 2013 was -9·1%, in sharp contrast with the rate of decrease of 6·0% before 2010. 9
