Hospital staff viewed proper hand hygiene as important for quality and safety Both hospital and government officials stated that infection control practices were of primary importance to the quality of their hospital care. Furthermore, all participants recognised the fundamental role of hand hygiene in infection prevention. Hospital workers noted that hand hygiene was important for their own safety as well as the patients' well-being. As one hospital president reflected: Hands are a major link to transmission of antibioticresistant microorganisms, which then cause difficulty in clinical treatment, and also waste medication and money. Therefore, infection control management is very important. Hospital staff also viewed the process of improving hand hygiene as having ancillary benefits, stating that the systems and strategies for improving hand hygiene could have positive 'spillover' effects for other infection control practices. These staff suggested that hand hygiene might bring about greater focus on additional behaviour changes such as use of personal protective equipment and more regular and thorough equipment decontamination practices by healthcare workers. Hospital workers were knowledgeable about hand hygiene practices Participants were generally well-informed about recommended hand hygiene practices, and several officials described that this knowledge had improved substantially since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. As one hospital infection control director commented: During the SARS outbreak and avian flu prevention period, we had dedicated orientations for educating healthcare workers about hand hygiene. Since SARS, there are many more hand hygiene training sessions, and people's consciousness in this area has increased. Although there was some variation among healthcare workers in their knowledge and practices regarding hand hygiene, in general, interviewees suggested that compliance had improved substantially in the previous few years since the SARS outbreak. Some suggested that the knowledge of hand hygiene guidelines was greater among young hospital staff or among the more educated public.
