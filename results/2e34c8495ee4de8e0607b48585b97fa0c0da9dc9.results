Identification of Cyclin D3 as M2-CT-binding Protein-The IAV M2 ion channel protein is a multifunctional protein with a highly conserved sequence among influenza A virus isolates that approaches 95% identity in some regions (29, 30) . Among the three viral envelope proteins, M2 possesses the longest CT with a high probability of interactions with the cellular machinery at various steps of the virus life cycle. These include fusion, intracellular trafficking through the secretory pathway (31) , and virus assembly and budding at the plasma membrane (24, 32) . It is of considerable interest to identify intracellular interactors of M2-CT, not only to elucidate cellular components that are exploited by influenza, but also to understand host defenses involved in restricting the virus life cycle. To this end, a random-primed cDNA library from human placenta was screened by Y2H using the IAV M2-CT as bait (Fig. 1A) . The screening revealed human cyclin D3 (GenBank TM accession number NM_001760.2) as one of the most prominent interactors of M2-CT, as summarized in Table 1 . Sequence alignment of the positive clones pointed to amino acid residues 138 -251 as the minimal interacting domain for M2-CT (Fig. 1B) . The M2-binding domain on cyclin D3 is largely outside of its cyclin box, which is responsible for binding to and activation of cyclindependent kinases (33, 34) and also the region in which the greatest homology occurs among the D-type cyclins (35) . This finding, together with the absence of other cyclins among positive clones, suggests a certain degree of specificity of the interaction, which was tested in the next series of experiments. Cyclin D forms a complex with and functions as a regulatory subunit of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK2 and -4), whose activity is required in the cell cycle early G 1 phase (36) . There are three early G 1 phase D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3), which are functionally related with tissue-specific expression profiles (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) . Our results from Y2H screening indicate that only cyclin D3, and not the other two D-type cyclins, interacts with M2-CT. We first checked the specificity of this interaction in human A549 lung epithelial cells. GST-M2-CT fusion protein was purified and incubated with wild-type cell lysate to pull down endogenous D-type cyclins. Cyclin D3 bound specifically to GST-M2-CT and not to either GST or beads (Fig. 1C) . Altogether, these results confirm that cyclin D3 binds to the IAV M2-CT. To examine the intracellular association of M2-CT with cyclin D3 during the IAV life cycle, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed from virus-infected cells. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged cyclin D3 (cyclin D3-FLAG) and infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with anti-M2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1D (lane 1), M2 was found to co-purify with cyclin D3, demonstrating their physical interaction during virus infection, either directly or through a common interactor. No interaction was observed in control samples, where cells were either mocktransfected and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1D, lane 2) or transfected with cyclin D3-FLAG and immunoprecipitated with isotype control antibody (Fig.  1D, lane 3) . These data validate cyclin D3 as a bona fide interactor of influenza M2, corroborating our results from the Y2H screening. The specificity of interaction between cyclin D3 and M2 was tested using a panel of exogenously expressed cyclins (cyclin D1, D2, D3, and E1). Although M2 appears to interact with other cyclins to some degree when they are overexpressed, we consistently found that it has the strongest interaction with cyclin D3 (Fig. 1E) . IAV Infection Induces Cyclin D3 Relocalization and Targets It for Proteasomal Degradation-To understand the functional relevance of cyclin D3-M2 interaction in virus-infected cells, we tested their subcellular distribution through immunofluorescence imaging. To achieve unbiased analysis, A549 cells were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 0.5 to have a mixed population of infected and uninfected cells in the same sample. Cells were fixed at 24 h postinfection (p.i.) and stained for cyclin D3 and M2 proteins. In uninfected cells, cyclin D3 resides both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm with only the nuclear CDK4/6-cyclin D3 complex displaying retinoblastoma (Rb)-directed kinase activity (44) . Interestingly, upon virus infection, a much weaker cyclin D3 signal was observed in the nuclei of infected cells compared with control cells, as revealed by M2 staining. These results suggest that cyclin D3 is redistributed from the nucleus to the cytosol as a response to infection ( Fig. 2A, top panels) . The effect of M2 protein on cyclin D3 relocalization was recapitulated in analogous experiments using A549 cells expressing M2 protein alone ( Fig. 2A , bottom panels), which resulted in the apparent reduction of cyclin D3 from the nucleus, similar to the phenotype induced by viral infection. To address the reduction of cyclin D3 from the nucleus upon virus infection, we fractionated both control and infected cells into cytosol and nuclear material to measure cyclin D3 levels. Cytoplasm-and nucleus-enriched extracts were prepared from A/WSN/33-infected (MOI of 2 to achieve a more homogeneous infection of the cell culture) and uninfected A549 cells. Lamin B1 and GAPDH were used as markers to verify clear separation of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Total intracellular level of cyclin D3 in virus-infected cells decreased to ϳ60% of that observed in mock-infected cells (Fig. 2, B and C, top) . Densitometric analysis indicates that 10% of total cyclin D3 was found in the nucleus of uninfected cells. This is very likely an underestimation because cyclin D3, being soluble, would leak from the nuclear into the cytoplasmic fraction during the experimental procedures. The percentage of nuclear cyclin D3 dropped to Ͻ4% at 8 h p.i. (Fig. 2C, bottom) , indicating trans- Numbers, amino acid positions. C, GST pull-down assay using whole cell lysates from A549 cells. Samples were incubated with either naked beads, GST control (GST), or GST fused to the cytoplasmic tail of A/WSN/33 virus M2 protein (GST-M2-CT) and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-cyclin D3 antibodies after pull-down. Results are representative of three and two independent experiments for cyclin D3 and cyclin D1 pull-down, respectively. Dotted lines, sliced lanes from the same gel. GST protein input was revealed by Coomassie Blue staining. D, co-immunoprecipitation of M2 with cyclin D3. HEK 293T cells infected with A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 2 were lysed at 6 h after infection and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-FLAG or isotype control antibodies. Cell lysates or pellets following immunoprecipitation were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) using the indicated antibodies. Transfection and infection conditions are shown above the blots. Results are representative of three independent experiments. E, HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged cyclins 48 h before infection with A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 2. Cells were lysed at 6 h after infection and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc or isotype control antibodies. Cell lysates or pellets following immunoprecipitation were analyzed by immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. Transfection and infection conditions are shown above the blots. M2 was found to interact with all cyclins tested, albeit to different intensities. Results are representative of three independent experiments. Quantitation of M2 pull-down levels was performed by densitometric analysis of immunoblots. M2 level was normalized to the respective immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged protein level in each condition. The degree of association of M2 with cyclin D1 was around 50% that of cyclin D3 when the same amount of cyclins was immunoprecipitated. Weak binding of M2 to cyclin D2 and cyclin E1, which plays a role in the cell cycle clock one step later than D-type cyclins and is required for cell cycle G 1 /S transition in association with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), was also observed in our experiments. The bar graph shows the mean Ϯ S.D. (error bars) of three independent experiments. **, p Ͻ 0.005; ***, p Ͻ 0.0001 by one-way ANOVA. 2D ). Most of cyclin D3 appeared in the cytosolic fraction under these conditions. Interaction of cyclin D3 with M2, combined with its enrichment in the cytosol upon M2 expression strongly suggests that this association must occur in the cytosol, either directly or as a complex presumably en route to assembly and release of intact progeny virions. The induction of D-type cyclins is growth factor-dependent, and both mRNAs and proteins exhibit moderate oscillations in continuously proliferating cell populations (37, 38, (45) (46) (47) (48) . Given the decrease in total intracellular cyclin D3 levels observed in virus-infected cells, we next addressed whether influenza virus modulates cyclin D3 protein levels in addition to altering its subcellular localization. The expression profiles of cyclin D3 and another cell cycle G 1 phase regulator, cyclin E, were measured through immunoblotting. Cyclin D3 was dramatically down-regulated by IAV infection to almost undetectable levels compared with uninfected cells at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 3A , top). A time course analysis revealed that the steady-state levels of cyclin D3 started declining at 6 h p.i. and decreased by ϳ50% at 9 h p.i. (Fig. 3A, bottom) . Cyclin E, which is activated at the late stage of cell cycle G 1 phase to facilitate G 1 /S transition, displayed only a moderate reduction under identical conditions (Fig. 3A) , contrary to the finding by He et al. (49) , where cyclin E was vastly down-regulated by IAV infection. However, no quantitative analysis was provided in their study, preventing us from comparing the reduction level. It is worth noting that cyclin E exists as multiple proteins ranging in size from M r 35,000 to 50,000 in tumor cell lines, as illustrated by others (see also Fig. 3A ) (50, 51) . However, only one band size of cyclin E was shown in their study, although the same cell type was used. The differential regulation of cyclin D3 and cyclin E indicates that IAV infection specifically deregulates components in the early G 1 phase (G 0 /G 1 phase) of the cell cycle machinery. To further investigate the mechanism of virus-induced cyclin D3 down-regulation, we determined the involvement of the proteasomal degradation pathway in this process. Cells were infected with A/WSN/33 virus in the absence or presence of proteasome inhibitors, MG-101 or MG-132, and tested for cyclin D3 levels. MG-101, also known as calpain inhibitor I, inhibits both proteasome and calpain activities (52) . Calpain is a calcium-dependent protease that produces limited proteolysis of its substrates. Resulting fragments are further degraded by other proteolytic pathways, including proteasome (52) . Calpain has been reported to regulate cyclin D1 at the posttranscriptional level (53) . MG-132 is a proteasome inhibitor that prevents degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins (54) . Uninfected cells were treated with the same drugs to control for the baseline oscillation of cyclin D3 levels. Proteasome inhibition did not affect cyclin D3 abundance in uninfected cells; however, blocking proteasome activity led to a significant stabilization of cyclin D3 in virus-infected cells. MG-101 and MG-132 treatments blocked cyclin D3 degradation by ϳ50 and ϳ60%, respectively, compared with the vehicle control (DMSO)treated group, as measured by densitometric analysis of immunoblots (Fig. 3B) . Thus, an obvious rescue of cyclin D3 was observed after one round of infection (9 h p.i.) through the use of proteasome inhibitors. The regulation of other cell cycle moderators was also investigated. Although viral infection also resulted in cyclin D1, CDK4, and CDK6 down-regulation on protein level (Fig. 4A) , the level of down-regulation is not as robust as that of cyclin D3, and their protein levels could not be rescued by protease and calpain inhibitor when compared with cyclin D3 (Fig. 4B ). These findings suggest that IAV posts a cyclin D3-specific effect during infection. Our data indicate that IAV infection results in reduced cyclin D3 levels in the nucleus of virus-infected cells. This phenotype is triggered by translocation of nuclear cyclin D3 into the cytoplasm, where IAV facilitates proteasomal degradation of cytoplasmic cyclin D3. Influenza A/WSN/33 Virus Infection Arrests Cell Cycle in G 1 Phase-The principal role of the D-type cyclins is to act as growth factor sensors, converting environmental signals into fuel for the cell cycle engine. The interaction between cyclin D3 and M2-CT during the viral life cycle implies a potential regulation of host cell cycle by IAV. This is supported by our observation that cyclin D3 is actively removed from the nucleus and degraded by the proteasome in virus-infected cells. To address whether the cell cycle is compromised, a quantitative profiling of cell cycle kinetics was performed on virus-infected A549 cells. Using an asynchronously growing cell population, we found that virus-infected cells accumulated at G 1 phase when compared with the uninfected group (data not shown). To reduce variability due to a mixed population of cells in differential phases of the cell cycle, we first synchronized them before infection in G 1 using lovastatin, a fungal metabolite shown to affect cell cycle distribution in a reversible manner (55) . Cells were released from the lovastatin block and stimulated with mevalonate at the time of infection to trigger progression into later cell cycle stages. BrdU incorporation and DNA content staining showed that virus infection brought about a cell cycle arrest at 9 h p.i. (Fig. 5A) . The overlay of cell cycle patterns of virus-infected and uninfected cells indicates that infection decreased the peaks representing cells in S and G 2 /M phases (Fig. 5B) . The percentages of cells in G 1 phase exhibited a progressive, time-dependent drop from 83.0 Ϯ 2.1 to 80.1 Ϯ 0.9% and subsequently 45.7 Ϯ 2.8% (at 0, 9, and 24 h p.i., respectively; means Ϯ S.D. of three experiments) in the mock-infected samples. This reduction reflects progression of cells through G 1 phase, followed by entry into the later stages of the cell cycle. In contrast, cells infected by A/WSN/33 virus remained in G 1 with the percentage of cells in G 1 phase hovering above 80% at all time points (Fig. 5C ). Our results demonstrate that IAV infection impairs progression of cell cycle through the G 1 /S intersection. To further prove that IAV infection induced cell cycle arrest in G 1 phase, we used a separate approach. Cells were preaccumulated in G 2 /M phase by treatment with RO-3306, a CDK1 inhibitor (56) . At 0 h p.i., both A/WSN/33-infected and control samples had comparable percentages of cells in all phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 5D) . Similar to the result obtained with lovastatin, the cell cycle pattern of virus-infected cells showed lower peaks for both S and G 2 /M phases when compared with uninfected cells (Fig. 5E ). Upon recovery of cells from drug restriction, both uninfected and infected cells resumed division and initiated a new round of cell cycle, displaying an increased percentage of cells representing G 0 /G 1 phase at 9 h p.i.; only uninfected cells, however, progressed further into S phase. The percentage of cells in G 0 /G 1 phase dropped from around 85 to 65% in the control sample, whereas it remained constant in IAV-infected cells (Fig. 5F ). Collectively, these results indicate that IAV infection perturbs normal cell cycle progression in human cell lines and installs a block at G 0 /G 1 phase. D-type cyclins activate CDK4/6, which initiate phosphorylation of Rb at multiple sites. Hyperphosphorylated Rb (ppRb) releases transcription factor E2F and leads to the activation and transcription of cell cycle progression-responsive genes (38, 57, 58) . To test whether IAV-induced cell cycle arrest was imposed by Rb, the phosphorylation status of Rb was monitored. Phosphorylation on serine 780 (ppRb Ser-780) is specifically catalyzed by the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex but not cyclin E-CDK2 (59) . Not surprisingly, IAV infection progressively resulted in diminished levels of ppRb Ser-780 as a function of time (Fig.  6A) . Furthermore, serine 807/811 phosphorylation on Rb (ppRb Ser-807/811), which affects the S phase of the cell cycle displayed a similar trend (60) (Fig. 6A) , an observation consistent with the virus-induced block at G 0 /G 1 phase. In line with the down-regulation of ppRb proteins, accumulation of hypophosphorylated Rb (pRb) was observed (Fig. 6A) . Inhibition of cell cycle can also occur through induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs). P21 WAF1/CIP1 is a "universal" CKI that inhibits both cyclin and CDK subunits to install a p53-dependent G 1 phase arrest (61) . Interestingly, upon infection, p21 WAF1/CIP1 was down-regulated through proteasomal degradation, indicating that IAV-induced G 0 /G 1 arrest was not mediated through the p53/p21 WAF1/CIP1 pathway (Fig. 6, A and B) . Expression levels of p16 from the INK4 family of CKI, which specifically inhibits the catalytic subunits of CDK4 and CDK6, were also measured. No increase in p16 INK4A was observed even after prolonged infection time (data not shown). From the results described above, we conclude that IAV infection down-regulates cyclin D3 levels, which in turn inhibits CDK4/6 activation and ultimately results in reduced Rb phosphorylation. Consequently, pRb sequesters the transcription factor E2F, which prevents cell cycle entry into S phase (58) . Cyclin D3 Negatively Modulates Influenza Virus Infection-To establish a functional relevance for cyclin D3 in IAV pathogenesis, we studied the effect of Ccnd3 knockdown on virus replication. To avoid off-target effects imposed by the use of siRNA pools, we used an individual siRNA duplex from the published literature (CCND3 #1) for generating a knockdown (62) . siRNA CCND3 #1 effectively reduced endogenous cyclin D3 expression levels by Ͼ90% at 72 h post-transfection, compared with a nonspecific control siRNA (nontargeting (NT)) (Fig. 7A) . Control (NT siRNA-treated) and cyclin D3-deficient cells were infected with A/WSN/33 at an MOI of 0.01 to allow multiple rounds of infection. Viral titers obtained from cyclin D3-deficient cells were at least 10-fold greater than those from control cells (Fig. 7B, left) . Because cyclin D3-M2 interaction was identified using avian M2-CT, we measured the effect of Ccnd3 knockdown on the replication of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus and observed a more Ͼ10-fold higher progeny virus production in cyclin D3-deficient cells when compared with control group at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 7B, right) . The difference in production of H5N1 virus was less significant at 48 h p.i. (ϳ2.5-fold), most likely due to the cytopathic effect of H5N1 virus in a limited cell culture system. To differentiate whether the increased progeny virus titer was intrinsic to the absence of cyclin D3 protein or a consequence of cell cycle arrest induced by cyclin D3 silencing, we next used combinations of siRNAs targeting various steps in the cell cycle to modulate its progression. Concomitant knockdown of Ccnd3 and Rb1 rescued cells from the G 0 /G 1 phase block imposed by cyclin D3 deficiency, allowing us to measure the effect of cyclin D3 alone on virus replication. In addition, we included a Ccne1 knockdown, which induced cell cycle arrest at the G 1 /S interface without affecting cyclin D3 levels. To gain further confidence in the specificity of the cyclin D3 siRNA, we included a second siRNA duplex specific for cyclin D3 (CCND3 #2). Both individual siRNAs and siRNA combinations resulted in significant reduction of the desired gene expressions (Fig.  7C ). In the control siRNA-treated cell population, around 55% of cells were found in G 0 /G 1 phase of the cell cycle. As expected, knockdown of Ccnd3 alone arrested cell cycle progression in A549 cells with ϳ65% (CCND3 #1) or ϳ70% (CCDN3 #2) of cells in G 0 /G 1 phase when compared with cells treated with NT siRNA. A concomitant Ccnd3/Rb1 knockdown rescued cell cycle progression into S phase. Knockdown of Ccne1 expression in A549 cells induced a more robust cell cycle G 0 /G 1 phase accumulation than Ccnd3 knockdown with ϳ80% cells in G 0 /G 1 phase (Fig. 7D) . For all siRNA-mediated knockdowns, cells were subjected to infection with A/WSN/33 virus at an MOI of 0.01 at 72 h post-transfection for progeny virus production. Ccnd3 knockdown with the two individual siRNA duplexes increased progeny virus titers by approximately 1 log. Despite the rescue in cell cycle progression, a double knockdown of Ccnd3/Rb1 did not normalize virus production when compared with NT siRNA-treated cells. A 5-fold difference in viral titers persisted between control cells and those that harbored a double knockdown in Ccnd3/Rb1. Virus titers from cells with Ccne1 knockdown were comparable with those from Ccnd3/Rb1 double knockdown (Fig. 7E, left) . To study whether the inhibitory role of cyclin D3 on viral replication is also applicable to the other IAV strains, two clinical isolates were tested. At both 24 and 48 h p.i., equivalent or higher virus titers for influenza A/HK/1/68 (H3N2) and A/HK/ 54/98 (H1N1) viruses confirmed our results with A/WSN/33 (Fig. 7E, middle and right panels) . To examine the distribution of D-type cyclins in the context of natural infection, we determined their expression in the human airway, in particular human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and pneumocytes. Although cyclin D3 mRNA was expressed at lower levels compared with the other two D-type cyclins in both cell types (Fig. 8A) , comparable protein amounts of cyclin D3 were detected in A549, HBEC, and pneumocytes (Fig. 8B) . Cyclin D2 expression could be detected in the two primary cells but not in A549 (Fig. 8B) . Collectively, cyclin D3 is expressed in tissues along the natural infection route of IAV. To validate its functional relevance in these cells, we performed a knockdown of cyclin D3 in HBECs to study its effect on influenza virus production. As observed with A549 cells, cyclin D3 deficiency in HBEC resulted in ϳ10-fold increase in viral titers, supporting our conclusions from experiments performed in actively dividing cells (Fig. 8, C and D) . Cyclin D3 Inhibits M2 and M1 Interaction but Not Viral Protein Synthesis-To understand the mode of cyclin D3-imposed restriction of IAV production, we first measured whether viral protein synthesis was affected by cyclin D3. To separate the effect of cyclin D3 deficiency from cell cycle arrest, we used the Ccnd3/Rb1 double knockdown. Multiple time points were selected to measure viral protein synthesis within a single cycle of infection. Knockdown cells did not display enhanced viral protein synthesis compared with control cells (Fig. 9) , suggesting that the effect of cyclin D3 on IAV infection probably occurred at a later step after viral protein translation. The biogenesis of viral particles involves proper packaging and assembly of viral proteins and RNA to form intact virions at discrete budding sites. M2 is a multifunctional protein; its cytosolic tail interacts with M1, promoting the recruitment of viral internal proteins and vRNA to the plasma membrane for efficient virus assembly (27) . We postulated that binding of cyclin D3 to M2-CT might affect M1-M2 interaction, resulting in attenuated virus release due to either (i) production of defective virus particles due to improper packaging or (ii) incomplete assembly of virions and hence generation of fewer particles. To test this hypothesis, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with cyclin D3, M1, and M2. Cells expressing M1 and M2 without exogenous cyclin D3 were used as control. For both conditions, M1-M2 binding was detected through co-immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting (Fig. 10A, left, lane 1) . Upon MARCH 24, 2017 • VOLUME 292 • NUMBER 12
