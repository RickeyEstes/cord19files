In the normal rat brain, irradiation did not produce significant histologic changes, demyelination or gliosis within the time period studied. The monoclonal antibodies to class I and I! MHC antigens produced dense staining of the lymph node controls, and of dendritic cells in control brains that had been treated with IFN-7. No differences were detected in the staining patterns in irradiated brain areas compared to unirradiated areas or normal brains: class I was restricted to blood vessel walls, and class II to occasional cells associated with the leptomeninges, choroid plexus and blood vessels, and rare dendritic cells. The antibody to LCA (OX1) produced strong staining in lymphoid controls, but stained only occasional inflammatory cells in the leptomeninges in both irradiated and unirradiated areas and control brains (Fig. 1) . In unirradiated tumor-bearing animals, no strong class I activity was seen in the tumor cells or the surrounding neural cells. In contrast, many class II + cells were seen, especially at the periphery of the tumors. The number of class II + cells increased with time after tumor implantation, reaching 40% of the ceils within selected areas of the tumor mass. Most of the class II + cells had a dendritic morphology suggestive of microglia. Rare cells (5%) had the morphologic characteristics of macrophages, lymphocytes, and occasionally astrocytes. Neither the numbers nor the proportions of cells were significantly changed following irradiation. These identifications were confirmed by serial sections stained with OX6 and antibody to GFAP and with OX6 and OX42. Two kinds of evidence suggest that the class II-positive cells were not tumor cells. In vitro, no class II was detected on 9L cells, even after incubation with IFN-T, suggesting that the 9L cells may not have the potential to express class II MHC molecules. In work to be reported separately, 9L cells were transfected with the Escherichia coli fl-galactosidase gene so that they could be identified histochemically (Lampson et al., 1989) . Double-labelling studies using the modified cells did not reveal class II-positive tumor cells within the brain. Many infiltrating leucocytes were also seen in the tumor-containing areas. As many as 40% of the cells within the tumors were LCA รท. Analysis of lymphocyte subsets showed many T cells, including helper cells (up to 25% of all cells within the tumor mass), fewer cytotoxic/suppressor cells (up to 12%) and rare B cells (less than 5%). In control studies, 9L cells themselves did not crossreact with the antibodies to lymphocyte subsets. Irradiation produced only slight necrosis. There was no significant effect on class I MHC expression in tumor-bearing rats. No significant change 243 was noted in class II MHC expression or lymphocytic infiltration on the first 2 days after irradiation. From day 3 onwards there was a slight increase in the numbers of class II-positive cells and lymphocytes in the irradiated tumors. However, these differences did not reach statistical significance in the Wilcoxon sign rank test (Figs. 2  and 3 ).
