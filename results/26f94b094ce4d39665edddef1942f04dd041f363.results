The political environment It has been recognized that the political environment for Chinese CSOs working on HIV/AIDS has generally been expanding since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. There have been strong political statements from senior government as well as supportive AIDS-specific policies and regulations. However, beyond the AIDS field, the legal environment for CSOs still remains rather restrictive. This is potentially a major obstacle to AIDS CSOs to effectively function in a sustainable manner and help deliver services at scale. The government's formal recognition of the role of civil society in the AIDS response can be highlighted by multiple statements made by senior government officials. For example, in 2004, at the National HIV/ AIDS Prevention and Control Working Conference, Vice Premier Wu Yi emphasized that China's AIDS campaign cannot be won by government alone and that there needs to be social involvement and mobilization of social resources. The speech encouraged all regions and departments to explore new and innovative ideas and develop policy measures to create environments and conditions feasible for societal involvement. 5 More recently, prior to World AIDS Day, 2009, President Hu Jintao pledged to mobilize the whole society to improve HIV/AIDS control. He stated 'China still faces a severe AIDS problem and we should mobilize the forces of all social sectors to tackle the problem persistently'. 3 ii66 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY The AIDS policy environment not only reflects the political will to tackle the AIDS epidemic, but also provides further legitimacy for CSOs to take on an active implementer's role. State Council regulations and national AIDS action plans, such as the 'Regulations on AIDS Prevention and Control' issued on 29 January 2006 13 and 'China's Action Plan for Reducing and Preventing the Spread of HIV/AIDS, 2006-2010,' 14 outline the role of local governments to support CSOs in carrying out HIV/AIDS prevention and control counselling, guidance, advocacy and education, and to provide financial support to governments. However, how these policies are implemented has been left to local interpretation, resulting in inconsistencies in the level of collaboration and support between local authorities and CSOs. No specific policies relating to AIDS CSOs have yet been developed. Despite these positive developments within the AIDS field, the broader socio-political environment for CSOs remains less supportive and is lagging behind the desired pace of development. Overall, the legal environment for civil society in China is thought of as disabling and restrictive to CSO development. 10, 15 The legal framework has not yet been consolidated and CSOs are governed by a set of provisional regulations. 16,17 Official registration for CSOs takes place with MOCA and criteria for registration are high; for example, organizations must have a minimum of RMB100 000 and have a 'management unit' to act as a sponsoring agency. In addition, only one CSO working on an issue is allowed to register at each administrative level and groups working on the same issue in different places are prohibited from coming together as a regional, provincial or national organization. Difficulties in obtaining registration with MOCA have resulted in most grass-roots CSOs remaining unregistered or registering as commercial entities, which makes them liable to pay a 5% tax on any revenue, even for funds received for non-profit purposes.
