The primary selection parameter for antigens capable of inducing CD8 + T cells in peptide-based cancer vaccine formulations is the ability of the peptide binding to MHC I molecules, and hence potential to be presented by appropriate antigen presenting cells (APC) to prime a CD8 + T cell response. The HLA-A2.1 molecule is the most common MHC-I molecule in humans (in âˆ¼44-50% of Caucasians and Asian) (39) , and hence most initial vaccine development aims to identify suitable HLA-A2.1 restricted CD8 + T cell epitopes. CD4 + T cells may help to promote sustained CD8 + T cell reactivity, therefore when extending the peptide sequences around the desired CD8 + T cell minimal epitope, we took the opportunity to incorporate them together with CD4 + T cell epitopes with predicted broad binding affinity to HLA-DR, to offer a potential downstream powerful combination vaccine (40) . However, the present study has only focused on the key issue of the generation of CD8 + T cell epitopes capable of inducing HLA-A2.1 restricted CD8 + T cell immunity in transgenic mice, since if this is not confirmed the vaccine combination would not go forwards into development for use in humans. Apart from epitope design, we also have considered that the peptides selected would need to be feasibly manufactured, as well as retain solubility and stability during the conjugation process (using EDC chemistry) to the vaccine carrier nanoparticles (PSNPs). To further help promote synthetic peptides being effectively processed into CD8 + or CD4 + T cell epitopes after attachment to the nanoparticles, as well as to help protect the peptide ends from the action of exoproteases present and also to improve the epitope recognition in vivo, in some cases, an extra region of amino acids was added at either or both ends (amino and carboxy) in the designed peptides. Based on the above matrix of selection criteria, multiple peptides from HPV, Survivin and WT1 were designed, conjugated to nanoparticles and evaluated for their ability to induce antigen specific T cell responses, in particular CD8 + T cell responses. Further details that led to the design of specific peptides being synthesized, derived from each one of the three proteins, are expanded upon in each corresponding protein section below in results.
