Between January, 2004, and December, 2013, a total of 54 984 661 cases of 45 infectious diseases were reported, resulting in an average incidence of 417·98 cases per 100 000 per year. The infectious diseases with the highest yearly incidence were hand, foot, and mouth disease (114·48 cases per 100 000), hepatitis B (81·57 cases per 100 000), and tuberculosis (80·33 cases per 100 000; table 1; appendix pp 3, 4), which together accounted for Year Year Yearly incidence (per 100 000) APC 2·3% (95% CI -3·0 to 8·0) 66% (276·38 of 417·98 cases) of the overall incidence. 35 of 45 infectious diseases were characterised by seasonal distribution, particularly acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis (September), rubella (April to June), influenza A H1N1 (September to December), and dengue (September to October; table 1; appendix pp 5, 6). Among the 54 984 661 cases of infectious disease, 132 681 deaths were recorded, representing an average yearly mortality of 1·01 deaths per 100 000 and case-fatality ratio of 2·41 deaths per 1000 cases per year. The infectious diseases with the highest mortality in terms of yearly case-fatality ratio were rabies (982·14 deaths per 1000 cases), avian influenza A H5N1 (717·95 deaths per 1000 cases), and plague (379·31 deaths per 1000 cases; table 1; appendix pp 3, 4). Overall yearly incidence of the 45 infectious diseases was highest among male individuals compared with females, across all age groups, and incidence was highest among children younger than 10 years and was lowest among those aged 10-20 years ( figure 1A; appendix p 7) . Overall yearly case-fatality ratios of the 45 infectious diseases were highest among men older than 20 years compared with their female counterparts, and they were lowest among children younger than 10 years and were highest among elderly patients older than 80 years, showing an increasing trend with rising age ( figure 1B; appendix p 7 ). Children had a high incidence of 17 infectious diseases (categorised as group A in figure 1C ): typhus, seasonal influenza, scarlet fever, rubella, pertussis, other infectious diarrhoeal diseases (ie, other than cholera, bacterial dysentery, amoebic dysentery, typhoid, and paratyphoid), neonatal tetanus, mumps, measles, kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis), influenza A H1N1, hand, foot, and mouth disease, encephalitis, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, bacterial dysentery, acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, and amoebic dysentery. Adults had a high incidence of syphilis, schistosomiasis, hydatid disease (echinococcosis), dengue, and cholera (denoted group B in figure 1C) . Furthermore, tuberculosis, leprosy, HIV infection, hepatitis C, and hepatitis B (group C1) showed an increasing trend of incidence by age, which was especially noticeable among men; rabies, malaria, leptospirosis, hepatitis E, and hepatitis A (group C2) showed high yearly incidence among males in all age groups; and A normal (Z) distribution was used to assess significance of the annual percentage change, and the parametric method was used to calculate 95% CIs. ECM=epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis. HFMD=hand, foot, and mouth disease. SARS=severe acute respiratory syndrome. *Joinpoint program provides significant values as p<0·05. †When incidence data contained zero, we substitute the zero with 1% of the smallest incidence. ‡Infectious diarrhoeal diseases other than cholera, bacterial dysentery, amoebic dysentery, typhoid, and paratyphoid. §HFMD, influenza A H1N1, and avian influenza H7N9 were emerging during the period of study, and avian influenza H5N1 was emerging in 2003 according to a previous report. haemorrhagic fever, gonorrhoea, brucellosis, and anthrax showed the highest incidence among middle-aged men (group C3). Case-fatality ratios were high among children for five infectious diseases (denoted group B in figure 1D ): scarlet fever, rubella, pertussis, neonatal tetanus, and hand, foot, and mouth disease. Young adults had high case-fatality ratios for leptospirosis, kala-azar, and dengue (denoted group C in figure 1D ), and the case-fatality ratios for typhus, syphilis, seasonal influenza, schistosomiasis, paratyphoid, measles, hepatitis A, gonorrhoea, epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, cholera, brucellosis, anthrax, and amoebic dysentery (group D) were high for middleaged individuals. Ten infectious diseases showed an increasing trend of case-fatality ratios with age (group E): tuberculosis, other infectious diarrhoeal diseases, influenza A H1N1, HIV infection, hepatitis E, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, haemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and bacterial dysentery. Data for incidence and case-fatality were further analysed by stratification of sex, age group, the diseases them selves, and transmission routes (appendix pp [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . During the study period, the average overall incidence of the 45 infectious diseases increased from 300·54 cases per 100 000 in 2004 to 483·63 cases per 100 000 in 2013 ( figure 2A) . The joinpoint regression indicated an annual percentage change of 5·9% (95% CI 4·3 to 7·6; p<0·05; table 2). However, the increasing trend varied across different periods, and the trend changed after 2009. The annual percentage change was 6·2% (95% CI 2·2 to 10·3; p<0·05) from 2004 to 2008 and 2·3% (-3·0 to 8·0; p>0·05) from 2009 to 2013, indicating a significant decrease in the second 5-year period ( figure 2B, 2C) . During the study period, the average case-fatality ratio increased from 1·86 deaths per 1000 cases in 2004 to 2·58 deaths per 1000 cases in 2013 (appendix p 16). However, the trend was not significant after 2005; specifically, no increasing trend was noted after 2009. Ten of the 45 infectious diseases showed significantly increasing trends in incidence from 2004 to 2013: hydatid disease, hepatitis C, HIV infection, syphilis, brucellosis, schistosomiasis, hepatitis E, other infectious diarrhoeal diseases, mumps, and leprosy (denoted as group B in figure 3 ). In particular, hydatid disease, hepatitis C, syphilis, and HIV infection showed the fastest rates of growth, with annual percentage changes of 24·0% (95% CI 12·0 to 37·2), 19·2% (15·9 to 22·6), 16·3% (13·8 to 18·8), and 16·3% (11·5 to 21·2), respectively (table 2) . Moreover, 20 infectious diseases showed significantly decreasing trends in incidence from 2004 to 2013 (denoted as group C in figure 3 ). In particular, filariasis, plague, and cholera showed the fastest reductions, with annual percentage changes of -68·8% (95% CI -86·5 to -27·6), -65·0% (-86·1 to -11·6), and -27·8% (-42·6% to -9·3), respectively (table 2) . Although hand, foot, and mouth disease, influenza A H1N1, and avian influenza H7N9 were emerging during the study period, and avian influenza H5N1 was first noted in 2003, 7 these diseases showed stable trends after emerging (table 2) . Overall yearly incidence and case-fatality ratios of the 45 infectious diseases varied greatly between geographic areas. The three provinces with the highest overall yearly incidence of the 45 infectious diseases were Beijing (753·45 cases per 100 000), Xinjiang (748·37 cases per 100 000), and Zhejiang (689·88 cases per 100 000). The three provinces with the highest overall yearly case-fatality ratios were Yunnan (7·65 deaths per 1000 cases), Guangxi (6·29 deaths per 1000 cases), and Guizhou (4·82 deaths per 1000 cases). Among the 45 infectious diseases, those with the highest incidence were mainly distributed across 19 provinces (figure 4A), and those with the highest case-fatality ratios were mainly distributed across 23 provinces ( figure 4B ).
