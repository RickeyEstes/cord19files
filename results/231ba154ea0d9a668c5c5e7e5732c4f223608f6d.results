Note that there are several sentences that are in this section that should be moved to the Methods section. The authors could make better use of graphic resources to express their results. For instance most of results of table one could be expressed with a few stacked bar charts. The viral co-infection could be summarized with network charts. And specifically to figure #1, given that probably most of the readers don't know the locality of those cities, this figure could be expressed over a map of Brazil. It could be done by simply placing in each locality the corresponding pie chart with the size of each chart proportional to the amount of patients screened in each site, and the internal division of the chart indicating the proportion of inclusion. This map should contain the equatorial and tropical lines, as the relative position of these cities along the latitudinal gradient are relevant for this study. As suggested in the opening this review, this study should explore further how comorbidities, age, site, sex, use of antiviral, vaccination, etc contribute to the clinical outcomes. This should not only be performed for influenza, but for each one of other viruses (although, for those ones, vaccination and flu antiviral should, of course, not expect to have any effect). The authors state that "Results show variations between Northeast (Fortaleza) and South (Curitiba) Brazil in relation to the peak time of influenza infections, which essentially followed the rain season of each region." In the case of Curitiba, the rainy season happens to coincide with the coldest moths, with in a subtropical and temperate regions of the world is much more relevant [4] . In fact, the prevalent theory points that low absolute humidity is the driver of influenza in temperate regions, so the Curitiba data is a interesting challenge to this hypothesis (as probably absolute humidity is not low if precipitation is high in the winter seasonsomething worth checking with local meteorological data).
