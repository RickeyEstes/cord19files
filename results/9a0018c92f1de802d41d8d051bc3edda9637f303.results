Guanos from two caves in Taiwan were subjected to NGS using the designed primers and the reads were mapped to the viral sequences used for primer design. In two caves (Taiwan 1 and Taiwan 2), sequences matched to the reference were homologous to EMCV, enterovirus F strain, rabbit vesivirus, and Spanish goat encephalitis virus (Supplementary Table 3 ). To confirm the presence of these viral genomes, conventional RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing was performed using specific primers for EMCV (5'CACCATATTGCCGTCTTT, 5'CCACAACTATCCAACTCAC), enterovirus F strain (5'CCACGTGGCGC TAGTACC, 5'ACGGGGTACCGAAAGTAG), rabbit vesivirus (5'TCAAAC CCAATTGGCATCTTC, 5'GCTTTGATGTAGTAGAATTGCCCA), and Spanish goat encephalitis virus (5'TGCGTGTACAACATGATGGGA, 5' CACGCAGTCATCACCACTGA). However, only the EMCV genomic sequences were amplified. To confirm the presence of EMCV, RT-PCR was performed using the specific primers for the EMCV genome (Table 1) wherein only the promoter region was amplified (Fig. 1A) . To eliminate the possibility that the EMCV genome is incorporated in the genome of rodents, Rhinolophinae, and Miniopterinae, the obtained sequence by RT-PCR was then subjected to BLAST wherein the result showed the absence of EMCV in the genome of these animals. Rodents have been known to be the natural reservoir of EMCV. To determine if the guanos collected also contained the excreta of some rodents, identification of animal species was done through DNA barcoding based on the 5'-end and 3′-end regions of the mitochondrial gene, COI sequence. Using the next generation sequencer with CLC genomics software, the number of reads in Taiwan 1 and Taiwan 2 caves were 5'-end: 3256, 3′-end: 3526, and 5'-end: 3198, 3′-end: 3198, respectively. After elimination of reads whose similarity was less than 50% to the COI reference, the number of mapped reads was reduced to 5'-end: 2167, 3′-end: 1936 (Taiwan 1), and 5'-end: 880, 3`-end: 518 (Taiwan 2). Among these read sequences, a total of 189 kinds of consensus sequences were found. Table 3 ). Since the maximal intraspecific distances of COI is between 0.00-11.00% (Yassin et al., 2010) , we considered 89.00% similarity, with the computed maximum variation, as the maximum threshold for identifying the species. Exactly 10/189 consensus sequences were above the threshold similarity to the reference species. Four of these, total of six reads in 5' and 3′ ends, were 96.44%-100% matched to the reference animal species Miniopterus fuliginosus. These sequences were 97.60%-100% similar to the same species when subjected to BLAST (Supplementary Table 4 ). One (1 read) was 91.63% similar to Petaurista alborfus, two (1 read/consensus) were 96.71% similar to Prionailurus bengalensis, one (1 read) was 93.68% similar to Melogale moschata, and two (1 and 7 reads) were 91.28% similar to Mogera robusta. When subjected to BLAST for confirmation, all of them were 100% homologous to species of insects (Cochyllis hospes, Fosterina rustica, Alysiinae sp.) and a spider (Argyroides zonatus). The remaining consensus sequences (150/189) that were below 89.00% similarity, were also subjected to BLAST to determine the species, where 120 of 150 sequences showed ≥ 89.00% similarity to various species of insects and other species such as scorpions, fungi, gastropods, and even a nematode (Supplementary Table 5 ). Moreover, in 23 of the 150 sequences consensus was below 89.00%, with regard to both the reference species and to other species when BLASTed while 7 of the 150 species had no matching species when BLASTed and thus, these sequences could not be identified. All of the highest homologies of 23 sequences did not belong to vertebrates. To further confirm the presence of the EMCV genome in the feces of insectivorous bats, guano samples were also collected in the bat caves in Japan and Korea. The samples from all of the caves examined contained EMCV promoter region (Fig. 1B) , which was confirmed by sequencing. This region was reported to be 100% homologous to Chinese, Korean, and Belgian swine isolates; and other strains from chimpanzee and mice .
