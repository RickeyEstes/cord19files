From January to March of 2014, the ED admitted 142 patients with a diagnosis of CAP. During "standard" PPMC diagnostics weeks, 69 patients were enrolled, and during "FilmArray" weeks, 73 patients were enrolled (Fig. 1) . Of the 69 patients in the standard group, 41 patients were nonevaluable due to a failure to obtain all elements of the protocol-required diagnostic bundle in 25 patients, presence of a noninfectious disease causing pulmonary infiltrates (e.g., congestive heart failure) in 15 patients, and documented presence of a second site of active infection (e.g., UTI) in 1 patient. Of the remaining 28 standard patients, 1 or more pathogens were identified in 24 (85%). Of the 73 patients in the FilmArray group, 42 patients were not evaluable. In 32 patients, there was a failure to obtain all elements of the diagnostic bundle; in 9 patients, the final clinical diagnosis excluded pneumonia; and 1 patient had a second site of active infection. Of the remaining 31 patients, 1 or more pathogens were identified in 22 (70%) patients. The high rate of incomplete diagnostics was largely a result of problems with the order sets of the EMR. The hospital had just installed a new EMR. Despite ordering the proper bundle, the EMR either failed to input the complete order set and/or failed to notify the nursing staff of the orders. The problem was gradually rectified during the first 3-4 weeks of the study. Of note, the nonevaluable patients were otherwise similar to those evaluated with respect to demographics, comorbidities, and other features listed in Table 1
