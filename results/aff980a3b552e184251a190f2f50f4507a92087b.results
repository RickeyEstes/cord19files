Between Dec 29, 2014, and Dec 31, 2015, 77 974 people were contacted to take part in the survey, of whom COPD=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. *Data missing for educational level (n=19), smoking status (n=185), hospital admission for severe pulmonary disease in childhood (n=22), indoor exposure to biomass for cooking or heating (n=66), indoor exposure to coal for cooking or heating (n=76), and exposure to dust or chemicals in the workplace (n=30). †Assessed in participants who were former or current smokers; 1722 current or former smokers had data missing for frequency (cigarettes per day or week) or duration of smoking. and were included in analyses. The general characteristics of participants included and excluded in the analyses are presented in the appendix (p 16). Sex and smoking status were broadly similar between groups; however, compared with those excluded from analyses, people included were younger, were more likely to live in urban areas, had a higher educational level, and were less likely to have a history of tuberculosis. 9134 participants in the survey had an FEV 1 :FVC ratio less than 70% and were diagnosed with COPD. The overall standardised prevalence of COPD in Chinese adults aged 40 years or older was, therefore, estimated as 13·6% (95% CI 12·0-15·2), which accorded with crude estimates (figure, appendix p 17). The age-specific prevalence of COPD rose significantly with increasing age (p<0·0001 for both men and women). The prevalence of COPD differed significantly between men (19·0% [95% CI 16·9-21·2]) and women (8·1% [6·8-9·3]; difference in prevalence 10·9%, 95% CI 9·5-12·4; p<0·0001). The sex difference is most probably attributable to the notable difference in smoking status between men and women (table 1). For current and former smokers, the prevalence of COPD was broadly similar between men and women when assessed by pack-years, and it increased significantly with increments of pack-year (p<0·0001; table 2). Overall, the prevalence of COPD was 8·7% (95% CI 7·3-10·1) in never smokers, 22·6% (19·6-25·5) in former smokers, and 20·4% (18·1-22·6) in current smokers. . Table 4 shows the severity of COPD, by GOLD stage. Among patients with COPD, 56·4% (95% CI 53·7-59·2) of patients were GOLD stage I, 36·3% (34·3-38·3) were GOLD stage II, 6·5% (5·5-7·4) were GOLD stage III, and 0·9% (0·6-1·1) were GOLD stage IV. The corresponding prevalence of COPD of GOLD stage II or higher in the whole population was 6·1% (95% CI 5·4-6·7), 8·3% (7·3-9·3) in men and 3·8% (3·2-4·3) in women (appendix p 17). The prevalence of respiratory symptoms (ie, cough, sputum, wheezing, and dyspnoea) in patients with COPD is shown in the appendix (p 20). Overall, around a third of individuals with COPD had at least one respiratory symptom (33·7% [95% CI 31·6-35·8]), with about two-thirds showing no symptoms. The frequency of respiratory symptoms increased with GOLD severity stage (p<0·0001). Comorbidities of individuals with COPD are shown in the appendix (p 21). 21·3% (95% CI 19·7-22·8) of people with COPD also had hypertension, 5·9% (5·2-6·7) had a history of exacerbation in the past year, and 3·0% (2·5-3·4) had a history of admission to hospital for COPD. Among the 9101 individuals diagnosed with COPD with complete information on mMRC score, 4·5% had an mMRC score of 2 or higher, and 90·9% were categorised as A with the GOLD ABCD assessment tool (appendix p 22). Only 0·9% (95% CI 0·6-1·1) of patients diagnosed with COPD were aware their condition was known as COPD (appendix p 23); 18·9% (17·2-20·5) were aware they had been diagnosed with chronic pulmonary disease (defined as COPD, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema). Of all patients with COPD, only 5·9% (95% CI 4·9-6·9) had ever been tested by spirometry before the survey and 11·7% (10·2-13·2) were taking treatments for COPD. The prevalence of COPD was broadly similar across categories of economic development but was higher in rural residents (p=0·0007), in individuals who had been admitted to hospital for severe pulmonary disease in childhood (p<0·0001), in those with indoor exposure to biomass for cooking or heating (p=0·0002), in people with exposure to dust or chemicals in the workplace (p<0·0001), and in those with lower BMI categories (p=0·0004; table 2). In the multivariable logistic model, older age, male sex, former or current cigarette smoking, hospital admission for severe pulmonary disease in childhood, exposure to dust or chemicals in the workplace, a family history of lung disease, and a history of tuberculosis were all associated significantly with increased risk of COPD (table 5). The population attributable fractions for smoking status and exposure to dust or chemicals in the workplace are shown in the appendix (p 24).
