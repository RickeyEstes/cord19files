Population characteristics are described in Table 2 . Compared to non-IPA, IPA cases were more likely to have cough and pathologic pulmonary sound (p,0.001 and 0.011, respectively) and presented more often pathological chest radiographies and CT scans (p,0.001). Established risk factors for IPA infection such as HSCT, neutropenia, GVHD and corticoid therapy use were homogenously distributed between IPA and non-IPA patient groups. Fifty-seven patients were diagnosed with proven or probable IPA infection according to the revised EORTC/MSG criteria (2008). The association of risk of IPA infection with the individual 27 SNPs in the C-type lectin and chemokine genes is shown in the Table S1 . All analyzed polymorphisms fulfilled Hardy-Weinberg expectations for the control group (non-IPA patients). Several polymorphisms were found to be associated with IPA infection ( Table 3) Table 3 and Table S1 ). After correction for multiple testing using SNPSpD (number of independent marker loci, 21; p = 0.05/21 = 0.002), none of the SNPs retained significance although Dectin-1 rs7309123 showed significance when the carrier status was analyzed (CC+CG vs. GG, P = 0.001; Table 3 ). In order to assess the degree to which the selected SNPs and the positivity of GM correlated, we also performed lineal regression analysis. In the whole population, 3784 assays were performed in duplicate and 531 were considered as positive (14.03%). We found a significantly higher percentage of positive GM among patients carrying the Dectin-1 rs3901533_T allele and among those patients bearing the Dectin-1 rs7309123_G/G genotype suggesting a role of these polymorphisms in determining a defective recognition and clearance of Aspergillus conidia (Figure 1 ). No correlation was observed for the polymorphisms within DC-SIGN that were associated with the infection. We subsequently assessed whether SNPs associated with IPA infection showed capacity to change putative transcription factor binding sites using FastSNP. The predictive functional analysis suggested an intronic enhancer function for the Dectin-1 rs7309123 SNP due to its location in transcription factor Cdxa (caudal type homeo-box transcription factor 1) binding site (GAAAGAC; score 1-2). These data suggest a central role of the rs7309123 in the susceptibility to IPA infection. None of the remaining SNPs associated with IPA infection was predicted to affect transcription factor binding sites or splicing or to introduce a damaging amino acid change. To explore the potential consequences of Dectin-1 rs7309123 SNP, Dectin-1 mRNA expression was measured in 21 healthy donors and was correlated with genotypes. Our results showed that subjects harbouring GG genotype showed a significantly decreased level of Dectin-1 mRNA expression compared to C-allele carriers (p,0.001; Figure 2 ). These results further supported our hypothesis suggesting that Dectin-1 rs7309123_G allele may disrupt binding sites for potential transcription factors. The MDR analysis of the SNPs tested revealed statistically significant interactions. Two SNPs (rs1024611 and rs4264222) were excluded from the MDR analysis as they were in LD with other SNPs using a cut-off value of r 2 ,0.80 in our sample set. The best interaction models selected by the TuRF filter algorithm along with its testing accuracy and cross-validation consistency are shown in Table 4 . The overall best model with the highest crossvalidation consistency (CVC) consisted of a model that included the CCL2 rs4586 , Dectin-1 rs3901533 , CCR2 rs3918358 and Dectin-2 rs7134303 SNPs. This model had a significant testing accuracy of 0.7735 (permutation p,0.001) and a cross-validation consistency of 100/ 100. Of note is that two SNPs showing genetic interaction in this model were not significantly associated with an increased risk of IPA infection in the univariate analysis (CCR2 rs3918358 and Dectin-2 rs7134303 ). The best two-locus model consisted of the Dectin-1 rs3901533 and DC-SIGN rs4804800 SNPs, two variants that showed also association in the single-locus analysis. This model had a testing accuracy of 0.6409 and a cross-validation consistency of 76/100. This model was not any more significant after 1.000-fold permutation testing. However, the entropy based information gain calculated for this pair of SNPs indicated strong synergy, which may be interpreted as the two SNPs acting together to increase the risk of IPA infection. The best three-locus model included the CCL2 rs4586 , Dectin-1 rs3901533 and Dectin-2 rs7134303 SNPs. In this model, testing accuracy raised to 0.7085 (permutation p = 0.025) whereas the cross-validation consistency was of 68/100. Figure 3 illustrates an interaction dendogram that summarizes the estimates of interactions.
