The proportions of sheep, goat, and cattle were 4.4 %, 6.8 %, and 88.8 % respectively. There were more adults than weaners (74.9 % vs 25.1 %) and more female animals (71.2 %) compared to male animals (28.8 %), with 22.5 % of the females being lactating females at the time of the study. Majority of the animals had high rectal temperature (95.6 %) and 4.4 % had physical signs of disease of which 2.7 % was diarrhea, 1.7 % was respiratory distress, and 0.1 % of the animals were icteric. None of the animals had neurological disorders. Additionally, a higher proportion of the animals had ectoparasites (93.9 %), were thin (76.5 %) and have not had any dietary change (98.9 %) ( Table 1) . The sero-prevalence of BCoV in the entire animal population was 53.6 %. Upon stratification by sheep, goats, and cattle, the prevalence was 25.8 %, 43.1 % and 55.8 %, respectively. Cattles had significantly higher prevalence of BCoV compared to sheep and goats. Among the entire animal population, sero-positivity of BCoV was significantly associated with farms with â‰¥ 50 animals (75.9 % vs 24.1 %, p < 0.0001). Upon stratification by type of animal, this effect seemed to be explained by cattle (82.2 % vs 17.8 %, p = 0.027) but not sheep and goats that are normally kept in smaller groups ( Table 2 ). The sero-prevalence of BCoV was highest in the Northern region followed by the Volta region (Table 3) . Even though our sampling sites formed a north-south gradient, there was no latitude-dependent trend in seroprevalence. There was no statistically significant association between the possible risks factors assessed and BCoV sero-positivity among all animals with the exception of dietary change, where a significantly lower odd of BCoV was observed among cattle with recent dietary change [OR = 0.08, 95 % CI (0.01-0.61), p = 0.015] ( (Table 5) .
