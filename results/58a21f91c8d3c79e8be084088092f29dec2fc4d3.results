Genetic association studies of CAP and NP. Data with characteristics of the study populations are given in Supplementary Table S1. In total, the CAP study included 593 subjects, while the NP study comprised 571 patients at high risk of pneumonia development. In both studies, patients and controls were matched by age, sex and ethnicity. Genotyping data are presented in Supplementary Table S2 . SNP frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in both control groups with an exception for TLR4 rs4986791 (CAP controls). Several associations revealed in CAP and NP studies became non-significant after correction for multiple comparisons. However one observation is noteworthy. In the recent meta-analysis 6 assessing the role of host genetic variations in susceptibility to several respiratory infectious diseases (tuberculosis, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-Coronavirus and pneumonia), the IL4 gene allele 2070874-T was the only variant associated with respiratory infections in the pooled group (tuberculosis and respiratory syncytial virus). The IL4 rs2243250-T allele which is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the rs2070874-T allele (r 2 = 1.0) was a susceptibility allele for NP in our study (Supplementary Table S2 ).
