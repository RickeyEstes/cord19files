A total of 178 patients enrolled in the study, of which 9 were excluded because of missing data or loss of follow-up. Finally, 169 older adult patients with severe acute respiratory illness were included in the study analysis, of which 36 (21.3%) patients tested positive for respiratory virus. These patients were sick, so they were all hospitalized.
