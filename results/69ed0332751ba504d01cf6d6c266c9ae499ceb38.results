Twenty healthy volunteers (10 women, mean age 32.2612.9 years; 10 men, mean age 25.362.5 years) were recruited for the coughing experiments (details shown in Table 1 ). All the volunteers were ethnically Chinese and were bilingual for both English and Chinese. The individual plots demonstrated a high degree of variability between the volunteers, which was expected given the different ways each of them coughed. The coughs of some these individual volunteers that were used in this analysis can be seen in the accompanying video montage, where a selection of 10 of these volunteers are also shown coughing freely, then into short and long sleeves (Video S1). Although multiple 'coughing bouts' are shown for each volunteer, only the first 'cough' for each of these volunteers was digitized and used in this analysis. When analyzed frame-byframe, it was relatively easy to distinguish between individual coughs during a 'bout' of coughing (i.e. where an individual coughs several times). The results from each of the two observers were compared at various points during the digitizing process and found to be sufficiently similar (within 10% of each other) to allow the two sets of data to be reasonably averaged for the final graphical presentation (Figure 3 ). For the 10 females (cases 1-10), their maximum detectable cough propagation distances ranged from 0. 16 For the measured parameters (i.e. propagation distance and 2-D projected area, Figure 3 ), the general trend is one of increasing over time, which is expected. Some of these values plateau towards the end of their measurable limits, and even appear to decrease slightly, which is probably due to observer variation at the Figure 3 . The blue crosses in image B represent the (x,y) coordinates of the digitized airflow boundary at that point, as seen by one of the independent observers. The software algorithm measured the resolved detectable distance in the 'x' direction (B), as this was the clinically important parameter reflecting the horizontal propagation distance of the cough. It also measured the maximum detectable 2-D projected area resolved in the horizontal direction of the cough as seen in the side-on view of the shadowgraph visualization of the cough aerosol. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0034818.g002 extremes of these detectable limits, when the cough airflow temperature may be equalizing with that of the ambient chamber air. For the parameters which have been derived from these measured parameters (i.e. cough velocity and 2-D projected area expansion rate, Figure 3 ) there are more fluctuations as these represent the next time-derivative of the measured parameters, i.e. so any change in the gradient of the propagation distance of 2-D projected area curve will register as a fluctuation in curves of these derived parameters. It is interesting to note that many cases show a peak cough velocity shortly after the onset of the cough, which is also reflected in a corresponding increase in the 2-D projected area at the same time, which is not unexpected. Finally, as the cough propagation distance and 2-D projected area curves begin to plateau, the curves for the cough velocity and 2-D projected area expansion rate tend towards zero, which is as expected. Whilst mean and standard deviations of these parameters are easily calculated, we feel that presenting the information summarized in this way would be misleading as each individual cough is quite unique -as can be seen in Video S1. The cough durations for these 20 cases, as shown in Figure 3 , are quite variable. Most lie between 0.20-0.35 s, and none last for more than about 0.35 s, which may represent the maximum duration of visibility for these shadowgraphs, before the exhaled and ambient air temperatures equalized. Some coughs of apparently very short duration can be seen, and re-examination of these video clips revealed that the natural head positions of these volunteers tended to angle their coughs in a downwards direction (and off the bottom edge of the mirror), so limiting the horizontal propagation distance as defined in the digital analysis, but also limiting the number of frames that could be captured before the cough airflow became untraceable as it left the mirror field. Rerecording the coughs with the head position of these volunteers adjusted to allow a more horizontal cough plume to be captured would have extended the distance for which these airflows would have been traceable, but this would not have been the natural posture for these individuals. For some cases, the cough was of very low volume, which may have allowed the temperature of this smaller air mass to decrease more quickly to match that of the ambient air. Hence, these cases exemplify some of the limitations of this naturalistic approach used in this shadowgraph imaging of human coughing. Video S1, demonstrates that the effectiveness of coughing into one's sleeve was also quite variable between individual volunteers, with regard to the degree of blocking of the airflow, depending on how it was performed. Often some form of bifurcation of the cough aerosol was the result (Figure 4) . Qualitatively, it appeared to matter less whether short or long sleeves were worn, but more on how the arm was positioned across the mouth and nose. With only two regular smokers in this cohort of healthy volunteers, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions between the effects of smoking and the airflow dynamics of coughing. However, it is perhaps noteworthy that the highest cough propagation distance and 2-D projected area amongst the male volunteers, was produced by a male volunteer who smoked six 20cigarette packs per week produced may be indicative of the properties of a typically large volume 'smoker's cough'.
