A total of 64 filters were tested for the presence of 18 different viruses by virus isolation in cell cultures and embryonated chicken eggs and by RT-PCR and PCR. Of the 9 positive samples, 7 were from building M and 2 were from building S. Because quantitative RT-PCR was not performed, we cannot speculate on the number of viral copies present on these filters. This should be taken into account in future studies. As shown in Table 4 , 1 prefilter from building M and 1 final filter from building S were also positive for influenza B virus, with an expected DNA band size of 145 bp. Sequence analysis confirmed these to be true positives. The nucleic acid detected in the prefilter of building M matched wild-type influenza B/Ann Arbor/ 1/66/ (GenBank no. M20174), whereas the nucleic acid detected in the final filter of building S matched cold-adapted influenza B/Ann Arbor/1/66/ (GenBank no. M20173). One prefilter from building M was found to be positive for human parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV-1) by RT-PCR. The PCR product was purified and sequenced. Blast analysis of the sequences matched that of the HA gene of human PIV-1 (GenBank no. U70492).
