A total of 1,182 patients with a documented fever or history of fever were recruited in Thailand into the main RCT between June 2016 and August 2017, and of 174 patients presenting with a sore throat between November 2016 and August 2017, 169 had a throat swab taken and were included in this nested study. Of these 169, 79 (46.8%) were male and 91 (53.9%) were aged less than 12 years. Antibiotic use before enrollment in the study was reported by 12/169 (7.1%, see Table 1 ). All patients completed follow-up at days 5 and 14. In all, 164/169 (97.0%) patients were diagnosed with a single respiratory tract syndrome, of which 94/164 (57.3%) had a common cold, 42/164 (25.6%) had pharyngitis, 26/164 (15.9%) had tonsillitis, and 2/164 (1.2%) had bronchitis. Antibiotics were prescribed to 53/169 (31.4%) patients at the index consultation. All but one antibiotic prescription was for amoxicillin (52/53, 98.1%), whereas one patient (1.9%) was prescribed roxithromycin. Antibiotics were prescribed to 2/94 (2.1%) of those with a clinical diagnosis of a common cold, 20/ 42 (47.6%) with pharyngitis, 25/26 (96.2%) with tonsillitis, and 2/2 (100%) with bronchitis. Swab results. Beta-hemolytic Streptococci were isolated in 35/169 (20.7%) throat swabs: 11 (6.5%) GAS, four (2.4%) group B, four (2.4%) group C, one (0.6%) group F, 14 (8.3%) group G, and one (0.6%) non-groupable. Antibiotic susceptibility of GAS. All GAS isolates were sensitive to ceftriaxone and penicillin G. There were resistance to erythromycin in 2/11 (18.2%), clindamycin in 2/11 (18.2%), and chloramphenicol in 2/11 (18.2%) isolates. A single isolate (9.1%) was resistant to all three antibiotics. Intermediate sensitivity to erythromycin was found in 1/11 (9.1%) and to chloramphenicol in a different 1/11 (9.1%) isolate (see Table 2 ). Clinical features of the patients with GAS are shown in Table 3 . Of 11 patients with GAS, eight (72.7%) had abnormal throat examinations, four (36.4%) had pharyngitis, four (36.4%) had common colds, and three (27.3%) had tonsillitis. Only four (36.4%) were prescribed an antibiotic at the index consultation, and one additional patient in the control group with high CRP was prescribed an antibiotic on the return visit at day 5. None of the patients sourced antibiotics from elsewhere during the 2 weeks of follow-up. Patients reported symptom resolution by day 14 in 10/11 (90.9%) cases. One patient had a persisting cough, but their other symptoms (fever, sore throat, and runny nose) had resolved. Median CRP values for each swab result are shown in Table 4 ; there were two missing CRP values at enrollment into the main RCT. The median CRP levels were signficantly higher in patients with GAS than in those with no BHS isolated (P = 0.0302), and higher in those with any BHS isolated (P = 0.0516). C-reactive protein > 8 mg/L had a sensitivity of 81.8% (95% CI 52.3-94.8%) and specificity of 47.4% (95% CI 39.1-55.8%) for the detection of GAS compared with no BHS isolation. There were no significant statistical relationships between CRP values > 8 mg/L (P = 0.112), Centor scores ³ 3 (P = 0.212), and FeverPAIN scores ³ 4 (P = 1.000) and diagnosis of GAS compared with no BHS isolation.
