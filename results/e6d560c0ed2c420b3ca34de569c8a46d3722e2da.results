Of the 425 community-based participants, three subjects who had missing values for more than two items of the child section and more than one item of the family section were excluded from the analyses. One participant of the clinic sample with more than 2 missing values in the child section and no missing values in the family section was included in the score calculation for the family section, but not the child section. In addition, 20 participants from the community sample with more than 1 missing value in the family section and no missing values in the child section were included in the child section analyses only. Table 1 presents the demographic characteristics of the participants. The mean age of the community-based sample was 4.5 ± 0.6 years, whereas the mean age of the clinic-based sample was 4.6 ± 1.2 years. Females comprised 57 and 52% of the community and clinic samples, respectively. Of the community sample, 81% attended private schools, while 19% attended public schools. The clinic sample had statistically significantly higher dmft scores compared with the community sample (9.9 ± 5.0 and 4.0 ± 4.4, respectively). The distribution of the A-ECOHIS responses is presented in Table 2 . Among the community-based subjects, pain was the most reported item (35%), followed by irritability or frustration (24%), and difficulty eating (24%), in the child section. Caregivers being upset was the most reported item in the family section (31%). There was one response of "don't know" to three items (pain, irritability or frustration, and avoid talking) and missing values, which ranged from 0.2% for the pain item to 5.5% for the financial impact item. Among the clinic-based subjects, in the child section, the most commonly reported item was pain (65%), followed by eating difficulty (57%), and difficulty in drinking hot or cold drinks (46%). Most commonly reported in the family section was a caregiver being upset (65%), followed by feeling guilty (53%) about the child's perceived oral health condition. It was evident that subjects in the clinic sample were experiencing a greater impact on QoL compared to those in the community sample. There were 2% of subjects who answered "don't know" to the school absence item, whereas 0.8% reported this for the pronunciation difficulty, avoid smiling or laughing, and avoid talking items. Missing values ranged from 0.4% for feeling guilty, and for irritability and frustration, to 2.8% for the school absence item. Convergent validity was assessed using the communitybased data. The mean A-ECOHIS overall score was much lower for subjects who responded "excellent" (3.9 ± 4) compared with those who responded "poor" (19.1 ± 6.8) to the global health rating question. Similar trends were observed in the child and family sections. When responses to the global question were dichotomized into good and poor health, A-ECOHIS scores in the scale overall and in both of its sections were statistically significantly higher in the latter. The Spearman correlation coefficients between the global oral health rating and the total A-ECOHIS score (r = 0.55, P ≤ 0.01), as well as those for the child (r = 0.54, P ≤ 0.01) and family section (r = 0.50, P ≤ 0.01) scores, were moderate (Table 3) . To test discriminant validity, the A-ECOHIS scores among the community-based data for each of the questionnaire sections were stratified by dmft score ( Table 4 ). The mean A-ECOHIS scores of each section were higher in the higher dmft groups. However, the differences between dmft scores of 0 and 1-5 were not statistically different in some of the domains. The mean A-ECOHIS scores for subjects with a dmft score of zero in the child section, family section and total score were 4.2 ± 4.2, 2.1 ± 2.7, and 6.3 ± 6.2, respectively, whereas they were 4.7 ± 4.3, 2.2 ± 2.9, and 6.6 ± 5.9, respectively, among participants with a dmft score of 1-5. Among subjects with a dmft above 5, the A-ECOHIS scores were 7.8 ± 5.0, 3.6 ± 3.0 and 11.2 ± 7.1, respectively. When the A-ECOHIS scores were compared between the two samples, the A-ECOHIS mean scores were significantly higher among the clinic-based subjects for each of the questionnaire domains (Table 5 ). In the community sample, floor effects were observed in 19 and 40% of the participants in the child and family sections, respectively. However, they were observed only in 13% each of the child and family sections in the clinic sample. No ceiling effects were observed in either of the questionnaire sections in the community sample, and they were observed only in the family section in 2.9% of the clinic-based subjects (data not shown). In the community-based sample, the Spearman correlation coefficient for the relationship between the child and family section scores was of a moderate magnitude but was statistically significant (r = 0.56, P ≤ 0.01). As presented in Table 6 , Cronbach's alpha values for the child section, family section, and overall questionnaire were 0.80, 0.78, and 0.85, respectively. The inter-item correlations between the 13 items of the A-ECOHIS ranged from 0.1 to 0.7; all were positive and statistically significant (P ≤ 0.01-0.03). Test-retest reliability was assessed on the sample of subjects who were administered the questionnaire twice (n = 78); however, 10 of these subjects were excluded because of missing data. The pre-test A-ECOHIS scores of the child and family sections were 6.8 ± 6.5, and 5.1 ± 4.2, respectively, and were 7.4 ± 7.1 and 6.3 ± 4.2, respectively, at the post-test. The mean of the total A-ECOHIS score was 11.9 ± 9.3 at the pre-test and 13.7 ± 10.3 at the post-test. The estimated intra-class correlation coefficients are presented in Table 6 . A-ECOHIS Arabic version of the Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale Excluded from this analysis were 27 subjects who had > 1 missing item on the family section (n = 18), missing information on the global question (n = 7), and missing both > 1 item on family section and information on the global question (n = 2).
