A total of nine dilutions (samples) were generated using an EBOV, Kikwit variant stock. Samples were coded and then tested using the various quantitative methods. Results are shown in Figure 1 . Every sample was quantified by plaque assay (Figure 1a ). The number of plaques used to determine each sample's titer were between 18 and 58 per well except for the most dilute sample (1:1,000,000 dilution), which had between 1 and 4 plaques per well. Using all nine samples, the R 2 for the experimental plaque assay result was 0.9984 with a slope of 0.9633. Experimental titers correlated well to theoretical values (Pearson r = 0.9967, p value < 0.0001). Using the 8 samples whose titers were established using plaque counts between 10 and 150, the concentration of the stock virus was determined to be 1.10E+07 PFU/mL, a difference of 0.21 logs from the original titer (1.78E+07 PFU/mL). The coefficient of variation (CV) for the first seven samples ranged from 7.4% to 22.3%, with 27.8% and 37.7% for the two most dilute samples. The EBOV-specific qRT-PCR assay was linear between 1E+02 and 1E+09 GE of synthetic RNA per reaction (Figure 1b) . R 2 for the standard curve used to determine GE/mL was 0.999 with a slope of −3.48 and an intercept of 45.08 (data not shown). The lowest copy number quantified by the qRT-PCR corresponded to a 1:10,000 dilution of the stock virus (equivalent to 1.23E+03 PFU/mL). While detected, results from the 1:100,000 dilution fell outside the linear range of the assay (CV = 72.9%). Using seven samples whose results fell within the linear range of the assay, the R 2 for the experimental results was 0.9961 with a slope of 1.006. Experimental titers correlated well to theoretical values (Pearson r = 0.9824, p value < 0.0001). The GE/mL of this seed stock was determined to be 3.40E+10, a difference of 0.25 logs from the original GE/mL concentration (1.91E+10 GE/mL). CV ranged from 1.2% to 7.4% for those samples that fell within the linear range of the assay. Experimental results are shown in black. (a) Infectious virus was quantified for each sample using six well plates of confluent Vero E-6 cells and an agarose-based plaque assay (PFU/mL). All samples were tested in six replicates; bars represent standard deviation. (b) Genomic equivalents were quantified for each sample using an EBOV-specific qRT-PCR (GE/mL). All samples were tested in triplicate; bars represent standard deviation. (c) Virus particle concentration (VP/mL) was quantified from each sample using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). All samples were tested in triplicate. Bars represent standard deviation. (d) Virus particle concentration was quantified for each sample using the ViroCyt ® Virus Counter 2100 instrument. All samples were tested in triplicate; bars represent standard deviation. Three grids of each dilution (sample) were prepared and counted using TEM. Particle morphology was not included in this assessment. Virus particles were not detected in sample dilutions greater than 1:31.6 (equivalent to 2.63E+05 PFU/mL). Results from the TEM are shown in Figure 1c . In the most concentrated sample, virus particles from all three grids were counted and yielded a particle concentration, while only two of three grids for the other two samples had virus particles. Using all three samples, the R 2 for the experimental results was 0.1438 with a slope of 0.36. Experimental titers did not correlate with theoretical values (Pearson r = 0.6783, p value = 0.5254). Using only the most concentrated sample, the particle concentration was determined to be 4.01E+07 VP/mL for this stock, a difference of 0.82 logs from the original VP/mL concentration (2.67E+08 VP/mL). The CV for replicate samples was 121.6%. Uninfected Vero E-6 cell culture media was used to determine the background or sample quantification limit of the VC. Using a total of 15 values, we determined the sample quantification limit of the instrument to be 2.8E+06 VP/mL (data not shown). Sample VP/mL results equal to or below this value were reported as below the limit of detection of the instrument (i.e., the instrument qualification limit). Three replicates of each dilution (sample) were tested in the VC. No virus particles were detected in sample dilutions greater than 1:100 (equivalent to 1.03E+05 PFU/mL). Results from the VC are shown in Figure 1d . Using five samples with concentrations in the linear range of the instrument (2.8E+06 to 1.0E+09 VP/mL), the R 2 value for the experimental results was 0.9731 with a slope of 1.5045. Experimental titers correlated well to theoretical values (Pearson r = 0.9940, p value = 0.0006). Particle concentration was determined to be 5.5E+08 VP/mL for this stock, a difference of 0.44 logs from the original VP/mL concentration (1.5E+09 VP/mL). CV ranged from 9.4% to 31.5% for those samples that fell within the linear range of the instrument. Similar dilution analyses were done for a number of filoviruses using the VC, with all stocks yielding linear regression fits of R 2 ≥ 0.95 and slopes between 1.24 and 1.58. The R 2 values and slopes confirm a strong positive correlation and linear relationship between VC results and dilution values (data not shown). The relationship between infectious virus, genomic material, and virus particles as measured by VC and TEM are shown in Figure 2 . These results demonstrate that there is a linear relationship for each assay with R 2 values > 0.97 for all methods except TEM (0.14) and slopes of 0.96 for the plaque assay, 1.01 for the qRT-PCR, 1.50 for the VC, and 0.36 for TEM. As presented in Figure 3 , our study demonstrates that the VC and qRT-PCR quantitative techniques correlated well with the traditional plaque assay; however, the TEM particle count did not. Figure 4 demonstrates that only the VC particle counting technique correlated with the EBOV-specific qRT-PCR. The TEM particle count did not correlate. There is no correlation between the two virus particle quantitative methods when using TEM results for all three dilutions (p = 0.4649) (data not shown). A summary of the initial quantitative assay results for the EBOV, Kikwit variant stock described above is shown in Table 1 (Prep 1). Additional quantitative assay results for a number of different filovirus stocks are also shown in Table 1. In general, particle counts were greater than those of the plaque assay, but lower than those generated from the qRT-PCR. The differences between the two particle counting methods are shown for each virus stock and range from 0.23 to 0.91 logs.
