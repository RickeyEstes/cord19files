SERMs selectively inhibit the entry of the Ebola pseudovirion, but not through the estrogen receptor pathway. As all stages of Ebola entry (binding to and internalization from the cell surface, as well as trafficking to and fusion with the limiting membrane of endolysosome) are mediated by trimeric GP spikes arrayed around the Ebola particles 29, 30 , so the pseudovirion model with Ebola GP can simulate the stages of wild-type Ebola entry, and several groups have studied the Ebola entry mechanism and screened the anti-Ebola entry drugs with Ebola pseudovirion model 3, 6, 31, 32 . We choose the pNL4-3-Luc-R − E − based Ebola pseudovirion to study the Ebola entry, and the Ebola VLP-mcherry (composed by GP, VP40 and VP40-mcherry) to study the Ebola internalization. Then, we treated the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 with two SERMs (tamoxifen and clomiphene), and infected them with the Ebola pseudovirion. Both SERMs selectively inhibited the Ebola entry more than 90%; however, they did not inhibit the entry of the VSV or Influenza A (A/WSN/33(H1N1), WSN) pseudovirions (Fig. 1a) . Treatment with estrogen and estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists did not inhibit the Ebola pseudovirion entry (Fig. 1a) , excluding the possibility that SERMs inhibit the Ebola entry through the ER pathway. To determine the effect of SERMs on Ebola internalization, we transfected the HepG2 cells with the TPC2-EGFP and LAMP1-BFP vectors, and infected the cells with Ebola VLP-mCherry. Co-localization of TPC2-EGFP, LAMP1-BFP and VLP-mCherry demonstrated that SERMs did not inhibit Ebola internalization to the TPC2+ lysosome; rather, they blocked Ebola VLP release from the lysosome (Fig. 1b) .
