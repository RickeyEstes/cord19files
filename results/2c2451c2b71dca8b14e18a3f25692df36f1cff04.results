The viral DNA titres found in the different tissues of the dogs infected naturally by types 2a, 2b and 2c are reported in Fig. 1 . CPV-2 DNA was demonstrated in all tissues analysed, showing a very wide distribution of the virus in the organism. The highest viral loads were detected in the lymphoid tissues, with maximal titres observed in the tonsils of dogs infected with CPV-2c (median titre = 8.98 Â 10 8 DNA copies/10 ml of template) and in the spleen of dogs infected with CPV-2b (median titre = 7.33 Â 10 8 DNA copies/10 ml of template). Very high DNA titres were observed in the bone marrow (median titre of 4.39 Â 10 8 in dogs infected with CPV-2a). The urinary tract was found to contain the lowest CPV-2 DNA amounts, with median titres of about 10 5 DNA copies/10 ml of template in the bladder of all examined dogs. Surprisingly, viral DNA was detected also in the nervous tissues, including brain, cerebellum and cerebral bulb, with median titres above 10 6 DNA copies/10 ml of template in all dogs. Faecal samples contained lower viral quantities than internal organs, with titres ranging between 3.71 Â 10 7 and 8.10 Â 10 7 DNA copies/10 ml of template for types 2c and 2a, respectively.
