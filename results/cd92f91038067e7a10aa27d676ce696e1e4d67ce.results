HIF-1α overexpression in rabbit ASCs. Western blot analysis was performed to detect the protein expression of HIF-1α in rabbit ASCs treated with different concentrations of DMOG. The data showed the expression of HIF-1α protein was increased in response to DMOG treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1) . After treatment for 1 day, the HIF-1α expression in cells respectively increased by ~2-, 4-and 5-fold for 200, 500 and 1,000 µM DMOG, respectively, compared with the untreated ASCs. After treatment for 7 days, the levels of HIF-1α protein in ASCs had no significant difference compared with ASCs treated with DMOG for 1 days, which indicated DMOG could enhance HIF-1α expression at least for 7 days.
