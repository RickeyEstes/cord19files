Twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria, with December 2014 as the peak month of presentation ( Figure 1 ). Most patients were male (64%), and the median age was 41 years (range, 23-73) ( Table 2 ). The most common country of travel was Liberia (44%), and the majority of patients had traveled for Ebola response work (68%). The median timing of presentation was 10 days after travel (range, 1-22). One patient who presented at day 22 was considered a PUI because symptoms had started within the 21day monitoring period. Most patients were evaluated in either the outpatient tropical medicine clinic (48%) or the ED (40%), and the majority had symptoms for 1 day or less (67%) ( Table 2) . None of the patients reported direct contact with a patient with EVD within the prior 21 days, and none met CDC criteria for high epidemiologic risk of EVD. Six patients (24%) were hospitalized after evaluation for management of a non-EVD diagnosis (3 with malaria, 2 with ILIs, and 1 with diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]). One patient initially evaluated in the tropical medicine clinic and discharged with home quarantine was reevaluated at our ETU for Ebola testing 2 days later when fevers continued and an alternative diagnosis was not confirmed. This patient's epidemiologic risk was low, but given the persistent symptoms of undetermined cause, the patient was triaged to the ETU under an abundance of caution. Presenting symptoms among the patients are summarized in Table 3 . Twenty patients presented with fever (80%) ( Table 3) . Other frequently reported symptoms included headache (64%), cough or rhinorrhea (60%), and sore throat (48%). None of the patients presented with hemorrhagic symptoms. Patient diagnoses are summarized in Table 4 . After initial clinical and epidemiologic assessments, Ebola virus testing was performed in 8 patients (32%), and none were positive. All but 1 patient was diagnosed with a non-EVD infectious illness or syndrome. The patient with a noninfectious illness had DKA and required admission in the intensive care unit. Three patients (12%) had P falciparum malaria ( parasitemia ranging from <1% to 3.2%), and none of these patients had taken malaria chemoprophylaxis. The patients with malaria and DKA were among the 6 who were hospitalized (outside the ETU) after initial evaluation in the tropical medicine clinic ED or ETU. Three of the hospitalized patients had EVD testing before admission, and the remaining were determined not to need EVD testing due to a low suspicion of EVD. The most common etiologic diagnosis was influenza A, seen in 6 patients (24%; Table 4 and Figure 1 ). Among the 8 patients with confirmed influenza, 5 (all with influenza A infection) reported receiving influenza vaccination for the current season. None of the patients with influenza B had received the vaccine. Although most of the influenza cases had returned from travel long enough to strongly suggest acquisition of the infection after travel, the 2 patients with influenza B presented soon after travel, increasing the likelihood of acquisition during travel. The majority of patients (60%) were diagnosed with an upper respiratory illness (influenza, other respiratory virus, or ILI). Five patients (20%) had acute diarrhea with a confirmed or unconfirmed cause. All patients recovered from their acute illnesses, and none were determined to have EVD.
