Synthetic ssRNA, resiquimod recruits macrophages posthatch in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts when treated in ovo We examined trachea, lungs, duodenum and large intestine sections for macrophage recruitment following in ovo treatment of resiquimod or PBS. We found that in ovo treated resiquimod at ED18 increases macrophage numbers D1 post-hatch in lungs (P = 0.02), trachea (P = 0.008), duodenum (P = 0.0001) and large intestine (P = 0.002) when compared to PBS treated group (Fig. 1) .
