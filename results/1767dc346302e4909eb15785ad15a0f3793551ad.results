Both HR121 and HR212 were expressed and purified as soluble proteins To produce HR121 and HR212, we used the recombinant E. coli expression system which was able to provide protein products in large quantities at low cost. The two designed proteins (GST-HR121 and GST-HR212) expressed as GST fusion proteins were soluble and readily eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose column by the normal elution buffer (10 mM reduced glutathione, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Moreover, the two GST fusion proteins could be easily cleaved by GST-3C protease ( Figs. 2A and B) . Every liter of cells could yield 30 mg of HR121 and HR212, respectively. These suggested that the soluble recombinant proteins, HR121 and HR212, can be efficiently expressed and purified in large quantities at low cost. The purified HR121 and HR212 were then analyzed in gel filtration for estimation of the molecular weight and the assembly character. The elution peaks of both HR121 and HR212 proteins were just after the peak position corresponding to 52 kDa (Figs. 2C and D) . In SDS-PAGE, both HR121 and HR212 showed major bands with molecular weight 13 kDa (insets in Figs. 2C and D), in agreement with the calculated molecular weights of HR121 and HR212 (13.1 and 13.5 kDa, respectively). These data suggest that both HR121 and HR212 could form trimeric structure (i.e., six-helix bundle) in PBS. However, unlike the six-helix bundles formed by HR1-HR2, those formed by HR121 and HR212 were expected to express three unassociated HR1 or HR2 helices (Fig. 1C) .
