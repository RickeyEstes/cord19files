Primer Extension of the 11K RNA To define the 5'end of the 11K late mRNA by an alternative procedure, we performed primer extension experiments. As a control, we included the thymidine kinase (TK) early mRNA, which showed identical map positions for the 5 end by both Sl analysis and primer extension (Bajszar et al., 1983: Weir and Moss, 1983) . Appropriate 5' endlabeled DNA fragments ( Figure 1A ) were hybridized to early or late RNA from infected cells and then either extended with reverse transcriptase or treated with nuclease Sl ( Figure 1B ). For the TK mRNA, primer extension and Sl nuclease analysis yielded DNA fragments of identical length and of the expected size. A protected fragment of 300 nucleotides was obtained by the nuclease Sl procedure with the 11K mRNA. This places the putative 5' end B. 4500 Figure 1 . Primer Extension and Nuclease Sl Analysis of the TK Early and 11K Late mRNAs (A) shows the coding sequences of the genes (thick lines); the drrection of transcription is indicated by the arrows. The map positions of the 5' end-labeled fragments used as primers and Sl probes are also indicated. For analysis of the TK and 11K mRNAs, the primers were hybridized to early and late RNA, respectively (8, lanes P2). or to tRNA as a control (6, lanes Pl), and extended with reverse transcriptase. Appropriate fragments were also hybridized to early or late RNA and then treated with Sl nuclease (B, C, lanes S,). Resulting DNA fragments were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The sizes (in nucleotides) of DNA fragments are indicated at right. To sequence the RNA, primer extensions of the 11K late mRNA were also performed in the presence of dideoxynucleotides (C. lanes G. A, T, C). The DNA sequence complementary to the RNA around the translabon initiation codon. as read from the gel, IS shown at the right in (C of the late transcript very close to the A residue of the ATG translation initiation codon, a map position similar to the one reported previously (Bertholet et al., 1985) . Primer extension, however, yielded a different and unexpected result. A series of closely spaced bands was observed and these fragments were on average about 20 nucleotides longer than the corresponding nuclease Sl-protected fragment ( Figure 1B ). In addition, intense bands were seen around the position of 1500 nucleotides. This material was resolved into multiple bands upon agarose gel electrophoresis (not shown), indicating considerable length heterogeneity. To exclude the possibility that the primer extension result was due to nonspecific hybridization of the DNA fragment, the primer was hybridized to RNA under the same conditions but was extended in the presence of dideoxynucleoside triphosphates ( Figure 1C ). An easily readable sequence was obtained up to the position of the Slprotected fragment, and this sequence corresponded to that reported previously for the 11K gene (Bertholet et al., 1985) . Beyond this point, bands were observed in all four lanes but were most intense in the '7" track, indicating that this region is rich in A residues (mRNA-like strand). In fact, at least 3-4 A residues immediately upstream of the 11K ATG translation initiation codon could be read. This experiment thus clearly demonstrated that the primer hybridized to the expected RNA but that the RNA contained additional sequences upstream of the 5' end defined by nuclease Sl analysis, and that this stretch was heterogeneous in length and possibly also in sequence.
