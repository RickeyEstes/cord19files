A total of 634 records were initially identified. Of these, 629 were extracted from electronic databases, and the remaining 5 were extracted from a review of reference lists ( Fig. 1 ). After screening titles and abstracts, we discarded 617 studies because they were duplicates (n = 119), animal experiments (n = 248), non-adult patients (n = 177), or non-randomized controlled studies (NRCTs, n = 73). We searched the full-text articles of the remaining 17 studies, and after we excluded those with inadequate reporting of outcomes (n = 7), 10 reports were included in our final analysis.
