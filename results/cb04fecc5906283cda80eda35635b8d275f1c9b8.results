In total, 57/436 samples (13.1%) were positive for influenza-A The performance of all three rapid tests compared to the reference method for influenza-A and -B combined is shown in Table 1 . Using multiplex NAT as reference, Alere TM Influenza A&B, Sofia ® Influenza A + B, and BinaxNOW ® InfluenzaA&B had sensitivities of 82.3%, 59.3% and 29.6%, and specificities of 99.7%, 98.9% and 100%, respectively. Specificity of the test could be confirmed with influenzanegative samples that had been tested with RespiFinder-22 ® (n = 373). Multiplex NAT detected 14 other pathogens in these samples including rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus OC43, NL63, 229E and HKU1, human bocavirus, RSV A and RSV B, adenovirus, parainfluenza-3, parainfluenza-4, human metapneumovirus and the bacteria Bordetella pertussis and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. None of the 11 false-negative samples were positive for another pathogen. Overall, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and Ä values (interobserver agreement) for influenza-A and -B were slightly higher for specimens from pediatric patients (89.5%). The limit of detection for the tests was evaluated using serial dilutions of fresh cell culture supernatant of influenza-A H3N2 and H1N1 and influenza-B grown on LLC-MK2 cells (Fig. 1) . For influenza-A, the detection limit of the Alere TM Influenza A&B according to QNAT was approximately 5,000 GEq/mL (H3N2), 50,000 GEq/mL (H1N1), and 10,000 GEq/mL for Influenza-B. Overall, the sensitivity of both DADs (Sofia ® Influenza A + B and Table 1 Performance The dilutions were directly tested using the Alere TM Influenza A&B (Alere, triangles), Sofia ® Influenza A + B (Sofia, circles), and BinaxNOW ® Influenza A&B (Binax, squares). In parallel, the dilutions were extracted and quantified by QNAT as described in study design [7] . Solid symbols, positive testing; open symbols, negative testing; lines, lower limit of detection of indicated rapid test; hatched area, limit of detection of the influenza QNAT.
