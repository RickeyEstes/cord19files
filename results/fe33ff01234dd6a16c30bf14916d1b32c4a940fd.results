rMERS-CoV/hNIS genetic stability, kinetics, and fitness. Recombinant virus was evaluated by one-step and multistep kinetics and by serial passaging of the virus. rMERS-CoV/hNIS replicated similarly to rMERS-CoV in Vero E6 cells infected at a multi-plicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 with a peak in virus yield of 4 log 10 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml at 24 h. At an MOI of 3, viral yields peaked at 7 log 10 PFU/ml at 48 h and plateaued at 72 h postinfection ( Fig. 1a and b) . The correlations between the multistep growth curves for cells infected at an MOI of 0.01 g (r ϭ 0.96 Pearson correlation, P ϭ 0.0082) (Fig. 1a) and one-step growth curves of cells infected at an MOI of 3 (r ϭ 0.90, P ϭ 0.03) (Fig. 1b) for both viruses were high. Both viruses had comparable cytopathic effects ( Fig. 1c and d) . Expression of the hNIS transgene was evaluated by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) using primers to specifically detect hNIS expression by MERS-CoV. The resulting 635-bp PCR product includes the MERS-CoV leader sequence and a portion of the hNIS transgene. RT-PCR confirmed hNIS expression in rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected Vero E6 cells up to 96 h (Fig. 2a) . The PCR product was not detected in parental rMERS-CoVinfected cells (Fig. 2b) . The RT-PCR assay was also performed to determine the stability of the hNIS transgene following serial passage. The hNIS transgene was stable in rMERS-CoV/hNIS for up to six cell culture passages (Fig. 2c) . hNIS functionality in MERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells. To demonstrate in vitro hNIS functionality, a series of assays were performed to characterize the kinetics of 99m Tcpertechnetate cellular uptake, the relationship between virus concentration and probe cellular uptake, and between probe dose and its detectability by the gamma camera. The in vitro hNIS functionality assay is outlined in Fig. 3a and b. The 99m Tcpertechnetate uptake by rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells in six-well plates was visible on the tissue culture plate images and distinguishable from the background radioactivity in the wells with uninfected and rMERS-CoV-infected cells (Fig. 3c) . In rMERS-CoV/hNISinfected cells, uptake increased with time after infection and reached a maximum, 20% of the dose applied to the well, at the final 96-h postinfection time point (Fig. 4a) . The mean radioactivity values measured in the wells were 89.8 Ϯ 5.6, 0.77 Ϯ 0.15, and 0.57 Ϯ 0.04 Ci for rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected, rMERS-CoV-infected, and uninfected cells, respectively. 99m Tc-pertechnetate uptake was dependent on the virus MOI (Fig. 4b) . Higher MOI was associated with greater accumulation of 99m Tc-pertechnetate by rMERS-CoV/hNISinfected cells. Uptake by rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells was also dependent on the dose of 99m Tc-pertechnetate (Fig. 4c) . The relationship between radioactivity measured by the gamma camera on plate images and the dose of 99m Tc-pertechnetate added to each well was linear with high correlation (R 2 ϭ 0.99, linear regression). At 96 hours postinfection with an MOI of 0.01, uptake was slightly above the background level when the 99m Tc-pertechnetate dose of 0.02 mCi per well was applied, and no uptake was detected when 0.004 mCi of 99m Tc-pertechnetate was added to each well (Fig. 4c) . Therefore, the 99m Tc-pertechnetate dose should be considered a limiting factor for detection of hNIS expression in rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells. Importantly, no changes The specificity of 99m Tc-pertechnetate uptake by rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells was confirmed by adding sodium perchlorate, a specific and competitive inhibitor of hNIS protein function, and assessing uptake at 24 h postinfection ( Fig. 5a) . At a concentration of 0.1 mM, sodium perchlorate blocked 99.5% of the cellular uptake of 99m Tcpertechnetate in rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells at an MOI of 0.01. Sodium perchlorate concentrations below 0.1 mM reduced the inhibitory effect. For example, radiotracer uptake was inhibited by 50% at sodium perchlorate concentrations of 0.001 mM at 24 h postinfection (Fig. 5a) . The effective inhibition of 99m Tc-pertechnetate uptake with 0.1 mM sodium perchlorate declined between 48 and 96 h postinfection (Fig. 5b) , suggesting that viral transcription can overcome the inhibitory effect. By 96 h postinfec- rMERS-CoV Expressing the Sodium Iodide Symporter tion, 99m Tc-pertechnetate uptake in rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells was nearly double the uptake at 24 h postinfection in the presence of sodium perchlorate (Fig. 5b) . In vivo evaluation of rMERS-CoV/hNIS. CRISPR-generated 288/330 ϩ/ϩ DPP4 humanized mice were challenged with parental rMERS-CoV or rMERS-CoV/hNIS by the intranasal route and monitored by SPECT imaging. One group each of mice infected with rMERS-CoV/hNIS and parental rMERS-CoV were euthanized on day 3 postexposure (pe), while another set was monitored to day 7 pe and euthanized. SPECT/CT imaging was performed to determine whether sites of virus replication were evident in these animals. Unfortunately, the low resolution of the clinical scanner used in our biocontainment facility prevented clear discrimination of hNIS-expressing tissues and limited the utility of the imaging. Details of the SPECT/CT data can be found in Fig. S1 and the methodology is described in Text S1 in the supplemental material. Macroscopic evaluation of the lungs from virus-and sham-exposed animals did not reveal any significant pathological changes except in one of the five mice in group 2 (rMERS-CoV). The right caudodorsal lung lobe of this animal was congested. Microscopically, minimal-to-mild perivascular and peribronchiolar inflammation was noted multifocally with variable congestion in rMERS-CoV-and rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected mice (Fig. 6a to e) . Kidney congestion was also noticeable in 40 and 50% of mice in groups 2 and 3, respectively, on day 3 pe and 33 and 50% on day 7 pe in mice in groups 4 and 5, respectively, infected with rMERS-CoV or rMERS-CoV/hNIS ( Table 1 ). The percentage of mice with alterations in the lung was higher on day 7 pe compared to that observed on day 3 pe (100% vs Ͻ83%, respectively). Extensive focal congestion in the lungs and multifocal congestion in the kidneys were observed in one of five mice from group 1 receiving sham infection, but inflammation was not manifested in this group (Table 1) . Infectious virus could be detected only in the lungs from 3/6 mice from group 3 (5.01 Ϯ 0.45 log 10 PFU/mg) but was detected in the lung tissue by plaque assay in 4 of 5 mice from group 2 (6.7 Ϯ 0.43 log 10 [mean Ϯ SD] PFU/mg) (Fig. 6f) . The differences in viral loads between groups 2 and 3 were not statistically significant (two-tailed t test, P ϭ 0.214). RT-PCR indicated maintenance of the hNIS transgene in 3 of 6 mice in group 3 (Fig. 6g) . The inability to detect virus in 3 of 6 mice and the nearly 2 log 10 decrease in PFU/mg observed for rMERS-CoV/hNIS at day 3 supports a loss of viral fitness in vivo. Virus could not be detected by plaque assay or RT-PCR at 7 days postinfection.
