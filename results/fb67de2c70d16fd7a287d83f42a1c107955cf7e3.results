A total of 156 faecal samples meeting the inclusion criteria were collected in several countries, namely Spain (n = 47), Italy (n = 39), France (n = 26), Germany (n = 21), the UK (n = 8), Belgium (n = 10), and the Netherlands (n = 5) ( Table 1 ). The age of the sampled dogs ranged from 4 weeks to 12 years (mean ± standard deviation (SD): 1.11 ± 2.46 years); 133 were pups aged under 3 months and 23 were dogs P1 year of age. Seventy-seven dogs had either not been vaccinated or had not completed the full vaccination protocol. There were minimal differences in the vaccination protocols among the different countries. All vaccine formulations contained modified live CPV (either type 2 or 2b) strains and (when administered) killed CCoV strains. All the samples analysed were epidemiologically unrelated to each other, being representative of different disease outbreaks. (Fig. 1a) . The variant CPV-2c was predominant in Spain (9/13 CPV-positive samples) and widespread in France (7/16) and Germany (7/15), where types 2b and 2a were detected at higher frequency. In Italy, 5/21 positive samples were found to contain CPV-2c strains, with type 2a being prevalent. All the CPV strains detected in the UK (n = 7) were characterised as type 2b, whereas all the Belgian CPV strains (n = 4) were type 2a. By TaqMan real-time RT-PCR, CCoV was detected in 60/156 tested samples (38.5%, CI 30.9-46.1%) with higher detection rates in Italy (20/39, 51.3%, CI 35.6-67.0%), Belgium (8/10, 80.0%) and the Netherlands (3/5, 60.0%) (Fig. 1b) . By using genotype-specific assays, CCoV-I was detected less frequently (24/60 samples) than CCoV-II (56/60 samples). Simultaneous infections by both CCoV genotypes were identified in 20 specimens. A single sample tested positive for CCoV in the UK and was characterised as CCoV-II. CPV and CCoV were found in mixed infections in 28/156 samples (17.9%, CI 11.9-23.9%), including 4 Spanish (8.5%), 12 Italian (30.8%), 1 French (3.8%), 6 German (28.6%), 1 British, (12.5%) and 4 Belgian (40.0%) specimens.
