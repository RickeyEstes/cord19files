Mean daily concentrations of PM 10 & PM 2.5 were 29.4 μg/m 3 and 20.0 μg/m 3 respectively, and reached as high as 336.6 μg/m 3 and 275.8 μg/m 3 during the haze episode in 2013. CO concentration also reached a high of 3.6 mg/m 3 during the same episode. Given Singapore's tropical climate, daily mean of dry bulb temperatures ranged narrowly from 23.4°C to 30.9°C while daily mean of relative humidity ranged from 63.6 to 98.1%. Mean daily counts of non-accidental and cardiovascular mortality for all-ages were 43.5 and 15.4 respectively while figures of 30.6 for non-accidental mortality and 11.2 for cardiovascular mortality were recorded in the elderly aged 65 years old and above ( Table 1 ). The correlation between air pollutant and meteorological data is found in the Additional file 1: Table S1 . There is a very high linear correlation between levels of PM 10 and PM 2.5 (r = 0.923). Completeness of the air pollutant data ranged from 58.2 to 100.0%. For each pollutant, there were 10 to 17 stations that collected data on more than 80% of the days that they were in operation during the study period. There was only one day in 2012 when data for zone was not available from any of the stations.
