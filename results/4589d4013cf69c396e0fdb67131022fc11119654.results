There were 438 confirmed H7N9 cases included in the China CDC database as of the 5th August 2014, and 43 of these were recorded as "mild" cases and were excluded from the analyses here because they form only a small sample of mild H7N9 infections. Among the 395 patients included in this study who all required hospitalization for medical reasons, 173 (44%) patients died. The mean age was 58.2 years old (Â±16.6 years), 71% were male, 139 (35%) cases were residents of rural areas and 189 (68%) cases had underlying medical conditions. Fatal cases were significantly older compared to non-fatal cases (63.0 vs 54.5 years old, respectively; p<0.001) and had a lower proportion of missing data on exposure (42% vs 54%, respectively; p = 0.019) ( Table 1) . We estimated a mean incubation period of H7N9 in all cases of 3.5 days (95% credibility interval, CrI: 3.2-3.8) using a Weibull distribution. Moreover, no factors such as age, sex, location and underlying conditions were significantly associated with the length of the incubation period when fitting a multiple linear regression model (Table 2) . We found a longer incubation period for the 173 fatal cases with a mean of 3.7 days (95% credibility interval, CrI: 3.4-4.1) compared with a mean of 3.3 days (95% CrI: 2.9-3.6) for the 222 non-fatal cases (Fig 1 and Fig 2) , and the difference in means was marginally significant at 0.47 days (95% CrI: -0.04, 0.99). In the multivariable logistic regression model, we found that a longer incubation period was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of death (adjusted odds ratio, aOR = 1.70 per day increase in incubation period; 95% credibility interval, CrI: 1.47-1.97) after adjustment for age, sex, geographical location and underlying conditions (Table 3) . To examine the sensitivity of our results to inclusion of patients with imputed intervals for the cases with missing exposure data, we also fitted the logistic regression models for the subset of 203 patients with recorded exposure intervals (Table 3) . We observed similar results with an increased risk of death associated with longer incubation period (aOR = 1.57 per day increase in incubation period; 95% CrI: 1.25-1.99). In addition, to examine the sensitivity of our results to the assumption of a linear association between incubation time and the log-odds of death, we categorized incubation times into tertiles and found similar results (Table 3) . We also found a similar association when stratifying by age group, with point estimates of 1.35 and 2.13 in persons 0-59y and !60y with 95% credibility intervals including the overall estimate (Table 4 ).
