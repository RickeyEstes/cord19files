Clinical data (table 1) Chronic respiratory disease and smoking were the most frequent accompanying medical conditions in our cohort. Three women were pregnant (one of them was undergoing the second trimester of pregnancy and the other two the third one). Patients were admitted to ICU five days in average following the onset of the symptoms (both groups). Patients in the MV group showed the most severe respiratory status at admission, based on their Pa O2/Fi O2 values and SOFA scores. The appearance of bilateral infiltrates in chest X-Rays was a common finding in both groups (MV and NMV). Our patients showed elevated levels of AST and CPK at the first contact with the critical care services. Lymphopenia was observed in all but three MV patients and one NMV. All patients received antiviral treatment (oseltamivir) upon admission to the ICU. Six out of fifteen MV patients (40.0%) received steroidal treatment in the first 24 hours following admission to the ICU for six out of eight patients in the NMV group (75%). As already mentioned, patients did not show clinical or microbiological signs of bacterial infection at admission to the ICU. Bacterial super infection during the hospitalization period was observed in four out of fifteen (26%) MV patients. No patients in the NMV group suffered from bacterial infection during hospitalization. Based on Hemagglutination Inhibition Assay (HAI), only four patients (two MV and two NMV) had developed specific antibodies against pandemic influenza at the time of admission to the ICU. MV patients stayed longer at the ICU than NMV patients. Seven MV patients finally died, while all NMV patients survived. No differences were found in the proportion of fatal cases between the patients who received early treatment with steroids (n = 2 fatal cases) and those who did not receive that treatment (n = 5 fatal cases), p > 0.05. (982.5), the last three values corresponding to three patients who eventually died. The NMV patient with detectable virus in plasma showed a viral load of 236.25 copies/ml. We found no significant correlation between viral RNA load in plasma and APACHE II severity score at admission. Mutation H275Y in the neuraminidase gene (NA) was found in one sample collected from a MV male patient who had received oseltamivir (150 mg/24 h) for three days before ICU admission. This patient finally died ten days after the onset of the symptoms and six days after admission to the ICU. Partial NA sequence was uploaded to GenBank database with Accession Number CY064798. The haemagglutinin (HA) mutations D222G/D222N were detected in viral samples obtained from five out of fifteen of the most severe patients: three of these cases showed the D222G variation (all of them showed detectable virus in plasma and one finally died) while two fatal cases showed the D222N mutation (one of them showed detectable virus in plasma). In the NMV group, only one patient showed the D222G variation. MV patients with the viral mutation D222G/N did not show differences in pharyngeal viral load compared to those MV patients for whom this mutation was absent..
