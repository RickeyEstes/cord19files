We analyze the geometry of the centerline r a which, due to the slenderness of the flagellar structure, is a close proxy for the shape of the flagellum. In general, the shape of a curve is determined by its curvature κ and torsion τ . Since r a is parametrized by arc length, the two quantities are given by the formulas ∂ s t = κn and ∂ s b = −τ n, where t = ∂ s r a , n = ∂ s t/|∂ s t|, and b = t × n are the tangent, normal, and binormal vector to the curve r a , respectively. Given κ and τ , r a is uniquely determined up to rigid motions. From the previous definitions and from (3) we obtain the relations between curvature, torsion, bending, and twist. In compact form these relations are given by which hold for U = 0. In (20) we introduced the angle ψ that the bending vector U = (U 1 , U 2 ) forms with the line U 2 = 0, see Figure 6 . Now, at equilibrium (12) we have under any dynein actuation. In other words, axonemal deformations are twistless. This is, fundamentally, a consequence of the fact that shear of axonemal MTs and twist are uncoupled (6) . The torsion of the centerline r a is our main focus, since we are interested in emergent non-planarity. Combining (20) and (21) we have that torsion can arise only from the rotation rate ∂ s ψ of the bending vector U along the length of the flagellum. This last observation will be important in the following.
