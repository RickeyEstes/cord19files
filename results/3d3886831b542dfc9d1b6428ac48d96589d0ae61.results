In the following, we assume that the incidence data is provided on a daily basis, i.e. that the time unit is the day. To use the maximum likelihood and time dependent method, it will be necessary that the generation time distribution is discretized using the same time unit. The user may provide incidence data in the following formats: -Vector of dates of onset. A list of dates in character or date format is required. An epicurve object from the Epitools package [15] (epitools::epicurve) may also be supplied. -Vector of incidence counts. In this case, the initial date and/or time step can be supplied separately. We now illustrate the use of the package using an example dataset from the 1918 influenza pandemic [16] , then use simulation to compare methods. The code used for this analysis is given in the Appendix.
