GS-441524 and GS-5734 inhibit MHV replication. GS-441524, a 1=-cyano 4-aza-7,9-dideazaadenosine C-nucleoside (Fig. 1A) , has been shown to inhibit multiple virus families in vitro (24, 26) . To determine if GS-441524 inhibited the model ␤-2a CoV, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), we infected delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells with MHV and treated them with increasing concentrations of drug. We observed a dose-dependent reduction in viral titer with up to a 6-log 10 decrease at 11.1 M GS-441524 (Fig. 1B) . The half-maximum effective concentration (EC 50 ) value resulting from GS-441524 treatment was 1.1 M (Fig. 1C) . We observed minimal detectable cytotoxicity within the tested range, with the concentration resulting in 50% cytotoxicity (CC 50 ) Ͼ300 M (Fig. 1D) . This resulted in a selectivity index (CC 50 /EC 50 ) of Ͼ250. Having demonstrated the inhibition of MHV by GS-441524, we next tested its monophosphoramidate prodrug GS-5734 (Fig. 1E) . Treatment with increasing concentrations of GS-5734 resulted in up to a 6-log 10 decrease in viral titer, and virus was undetectable by plaque assay at concentrations above 0.5 M GS-5734 (Fig. 1F ). GS-5734 inhibited MHV more potently than GS-441524, with a GS-5734 EC 50 of 0.03 M (Fig. 1G) , consistent with higher cellular permeability and more efficient metabolism of the prodrug into the active nucleoside triphosphate by bypassing the rate-limiting first phosphorylation step (27, 28) . We also observed minimal cytotoxicity at concentrations required for antiviral activity of GS-5734, in line with previously reported extensive cytotoxicity studies in relevant human cell types (27) , with a CC 50 value of 39 M (Fig. 1H ), resulting in a selectivity index of Ͼ1,000. These results expand the breadth of GS-441524 and GS-5734 inhibition of CoVs to include the ␤-2a model CoV MHV.
