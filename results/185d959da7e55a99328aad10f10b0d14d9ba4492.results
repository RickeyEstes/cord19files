A total of 111 patients, 54 (48.6%) male, 106 Caucasian (95.4%), with a mean age of 65.3 Â± 18.9 were admitted to the medical ICUs of two tertiary care hospitals. While the patients at Mayo Clinic were older (68 vs 56, P = 0.006), the severity of illness was similar in both centers (median APACHE III score 69 vs 76, P = 0.13). Most patients (97.3%) were admitted to the hospital from November to April. There were 103 influenza A cases (92.7%) and 8 influenza B cases (7.2%). The number of the influenza cases during the observation period is shown in Fig. 1 . There was no difference in mortality between influenza A and influenza B (18.5% vs 25%, P = 0.65). Sixtyfour patients (57.7%) had pre-existing chronic pulmonary disease and 19% were immunosuppressed. Only 35 (31%) patients had received influenza vaccination before hospital admission, although the vast majorities (106, 95%) were eligible for routine vaccination based on age and/or chronic disease criteria. Note: SD = standard deviation; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; APACHE III = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III; IQR = interquartile range.
