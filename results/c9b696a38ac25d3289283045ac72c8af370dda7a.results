The Fayoumi line's resistance phenotype was upheld by the NDV viral load, antibody quantification measurements, and sequence data. To examine the effects of an NDV challenge on the two inbred lines with different resistance, the challenged Fayoumi and Leghorn chickens were inoculated with the La Sota NDV strain, while the nonchallenged chickens were given saline solution as a mock infection. Lachrymal fluid was collected from each chicken prior to infection, at 2 days postinfection (dpi), and at 6 dpi for viral quantification. No NDV was detected in any of the birds prior to challenge or in any of the nonchallenged birds at all times (data not shown). In the challenged birds, the viral load significantly decreased from 2 to 6 dpi (P Ͻ 0.0001), and the line had a significant effect on the viral load (P ϭ 0.045) (Fig. 1 ). At 6 dpi, the Fayoumis had significantly less virus than the Leghorns (P ϭ 0.0122), suggesting that the Fayoumis may have cleared the virus more quickly (Fig. 1) . There was no correlation (r ϭ Ϫ0.0097) between each individual's viral load at 2 and 6 dpi, which was in agreement with the findings of previous studies (19) . Serum from blood collected at 10 dpi was used to quantify NDV-specific antibody via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios at 10 dpi were significantly different (P ϭ 0.0007) between the challenged and nonchallenged birds. Due to the large variation in NDV antibody levels, there was no The viral load is shown as the least-square means of the log copy number, measured by qPCR, of the Fayoumis (white) and Leghorns (gray). Error bars represent standard deviations. A Student t test was used to derive the connecting letters report, in which the values for bars that are not labeled with the same letter are significantly different (P Ͻ 0.05). At 2 dpi, data are for 21 Fayoumi and 28 Leghorn chickens, and at 6 dpi, data are for 12 Fayoumi and 20 Leghorn chickens (total n ϭ 81). (B) The antibody titer is displayed as the least-square means of the S/P ratio in the Fayoumis (white) and Leghorns (gray) at 10 dpi, and the error bars represent standard deviations. The connecting letters report was generated by Student's t test. At 10 dpi, data are for 8 challenged Fayoumi chickens, 13 challenged Leghorn chickens, 6 nonchallenged Fayoumi chickens, and 8 nonchallenged Leghorn chickens (total n ϭ 35). significant difference between the lines within the same treatment category. However, the challenged Fayoumis produced more antibodies, on average (P ϭ 0.367), than the challenged Leghorns (Fig. 1) . Sequence reads that did not map to the chicken genome were analyzed to determine if any mapped to genes in the NDV genome (Fig. 2 ). Viral transcripts were detectable in the challenged birds only at 2 dpi. The main effect of line had a statistically significant impact (P ϭ 0.0264) on the viral transcripts of the challenged Fayoumis and Leghorns at 2 dpi (Fig. 2 ). As expected, the counts per million (cpm) appeared to be higher for genes at the beginning of the virus genome in both lines. Effects of NDV challenge on the trachea transcriptome. Epithelial cells were peeled from the trachea of challenged and nonchallenged birds from both lines at all three times and used for RNA isolation, cDNA library construction, and sequencing. The tracheal epithelium sequencing results were similar across treatment groups, and therefore, we did not expect biases due to differences in the number of reads, mapping percentage, or transcriptome coverage percentage among the treatment groups (Table  1) . On average, approximately 2 million reads were removed from each sample in the filtering process, nearly 90% of the filtered reads were mappable, and about 75% of the Galgal4 transcripts had at least one mapped read (Table 1) . To compare the host responses to NDV, the responses of challenged and nonchallenged birds within each line were compared at each time point in the experiment. These comparisons are referred to as the six major contrasts. As time progressed, there were fewer differentially expressed (DE) genes (DEG) between the challenged and nonchallenged birds in both lines (Fig. 3) . Overall, more genes were upregulated than downregulated (Fig. 3) . Differentially expressed genes that were shared between lines are likely crucial to the response to NDV for all chickens, whereas genes uniquely identified as differentially expressed in the Leghorn or the Fayoumi chickens may be related to the susceptibility and resistance, respectively, of the chickens. The gene for protein kinase C beta (PRKC␤) was the only gene that was uniquely identified to be DE only in the Fayoumis at all three time points. The large difference in the numbers of DEG at 6 dpi in the Fayoumi and Leghorn lines (Fig. 3) suggests that the Fayoumi chickens recovered more quickly from the virus infection, resulting in fewer differences between the challenged and nonchallenged birds. Challenge with NDV stimulated the infiltration and migration of immune cells. The DEG from the challenged versus nonchallenged birds at each time point and within each line were used for cell type enrichment analysis. At 2 dpi, the top cell types enriched were similar for the two lines (Fig. 4) ; whole-blood cells were the most enriched cell type for both lines. At 6 dpi, the lines were the most dissimilar, which corresponds to the difference in DEG numbers ( Fig. 3 and 4) . The enrichment of cancer-type cell lines at 6 dpi may have been a result of high levels of cell proliferation. Overall, the results suggested a conserved response between the two lines and a strong enrichment of immune-related cells after challenge at all time points but no clear shifts from innate to adaptive immune cell types over time. A major pathway predicted by Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) to be activated in all six major contrasts was the leukocyte extravasation signaling pathway. Figure 5A shows the genes in this pathway that were significantly up-or downregulated within each contrast. On the basis of the expression levels of the genes in this pathway (Fig. 5B) , the molecule activity prediction function of IPA predicted, for each contrast, activation of cell mobility and activation of actin cytoskeleton contraction; the IPA output placed more confidence in the prediction of the latter in the Fayoumis than the Leghorns at all time points (not shown). Temporal changes influenced the pathways that were activated or inhibited in each line. The top canonical pathways predicted by IPA are shown in Fig. 6 for each of the six major contrasts. The six major contrasts were clustered by similarity, which was determined by the resemblance of the activation or inhibition scores of all the pathways. The clustering grouped the major contrasts by dpi, with the Fayoumis at 6 dpi being the outlier ( Fig. 6 ). At 6 dpi there were only 119 DEG for the Fayoumis to populate the pathways, making it more difficult to obtain significance for activation or inhibition of a pathway. Several key pathways were significantly activated at all time points in both lines: iCOS-iCOSL signaling in T helper cells, NF-B signaling, the role of the nuclear factor of activated T cells in the regulation of the immune response, calciuminduced T lymphocyte apoptosis, phospholipase C signaling, and CD28 signaling in T helper cells. These conserved pathways may be inherently crucial to the chicken's response to NDV in the trachea. The stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) signaling pathway was activated only in the Leghorns and was activated at all three time points. This pathway may be associated with the Leghorns' susceptibility to NDV (Fig. 6) . Collagen downregulation at 2 dpi was identified only in the Fayoumi chickens. The network shown in Fig. 7 shows the overwhelming downregulation of collagen, which was predicted by IPA to be associated with various diseases and functions, such as connective tissue disorders, dermatological diseases and conditions, and organismal injury and abnormalities. This network had 25 focus modules and had the secondhighest score of the networks generated from this contrast. Of the 30 genes in this network, only 8 were also DE in the Leghorn chickens (Fig. 7) . It does not appear that the downregulation of collagen was limited to a specific collagen type. Direct comparison of the Fayoumi and Leghorn chickens at 2 dpi gave more insight into the pathways and genes associated with resistance. The Fayoumis and Leghorns had a high degree of similarity in the cell populations enriched at 2 dpi ( Fig.  4) , allowing for direct comparison between the two lines. The number of DEG between the Fayoumis and Leghorns was higher in the challenged birds than the nonchallenged birds ( Fig. 8) . Myosin-and troponin-related genes, as well as MHC class I genes, were the most upregulated genes in the Fayoumis relative to the Leghorns at this time. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) signaling pathway had the highest positive Z-score (Fig. 8) , suggesting strong activation of this pathway in the Fayoumi chickens relative to the Leghorn chickens. Examining the genes that were impacted by challenge and line offered potential candidate genes of interest. A contrast was written to compare the interaction between challenge and line at each time point. At each time point, only DEG from the challenged versus nonchallenged contrast within each line were examined for the interaction (line · challenge). The majority of the genes with a false discovery rate (FDR) of Ͻ0.05 for the interaction were from 6 dpi, and nearly half of all genes were uncharacterized proteins (Table 2 ). Further investigation into the function of these uncharacterized proteins would be useful to provide more insight into the resistant and susceptible phenotypes of Fayoumi and Leghorn chickens. The RNA-seq results were validated with an independent test. The Fluidigm Biomark HD system was used as a method of high-throughput quantitative PCR to serve as validation for the transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) results. The expression of 44 genes (Table 3) was analyzed. Figure 9 shows a correlation of 0.91 between the FIG 5 Leukocyte extravasation signaling pathway. For all genes, the absolute LFC was Ͼ1 and the FDR was Ͻ0.05. (A) Gene expression heat map of genes in the leukocyte extravasation signaling pathway generated by contrasting the challenged and nonchallenged birds within each time and line. The contrasts, listed atop each column, were clustered by similarity on the basis of genes (blue text) that were upregulated (red), that were downregulated (green), and that had no change (gray). Genes that were not DE in any of the comparisons were removed from the graph. This pathway was activated in all contrasts (orange), as predicted by IPA. (B) The leukocyte extravasation signaling pathway in the Fayoumis at 2 dpi. Genes were upregulated (red), downregulated (green), or not DE (gray) in the challenged relative to the nonchallenged chickens. Genes in white were not found in the data set because they were removed during normalization, unrecognized by IPA, or not found in the chicken genome. The shapes of the genes represent their function. The genes within a parent node that were DE in any of the six contrasts are shown individually next to the parental node and are denoted with smaller molecules and labels. two methods across all six major contrasts. The high correlation serves as a validation of the RNA-seq technology applied in this study.
