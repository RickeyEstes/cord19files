A total of 100 healthy unrelated Belgian individuals were screened for polymorphisms in the human aminopeptidase N domain that is essential for its HCoV-229E receptor activity. An 871 bp fragment, encompassing APN exon 3, intron 3 and exon 4 was PCR-amplified and sequenced, and was submitted to GenBank under accession number AF527789. The resulting chromatograms were analyzed using the SeqMan multiple sequence alignment tool (Laser-Gene, DNAStar, Madison, WI). Consensus sequences were compared with a reference APN sequence in GenBank (accession number AJ421875) using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). 23 Seven variations were identified, of which six have not yet been described. Table 1 shows the distribution of the allele frequencies. Intron variations are described referring to their relative position in the intron, and exon variation positions are referred to their mRNA nucleotide position (GenBank accession number X13276). The location of the polymorphisms in the APN gene is shown in Figure 1 . While no variations could be found in APN exon 3, four of the identified polymorphisms were located in intron 3 and three in exon 4. In intron 3, a C to T variation was found at intron 3 position 86 (C86T) (GenBank AJ421875, contig position 327) in two individuals, as well as a G to C variation at intron position 395 (G395C) in seven individuals, and a C to T variation at intron position 429 (C429T) in one sample. All individuals were heterozygous for these polymorphisms, which have no apparent functional consequence, as they are located in a non-coding intron region of the APN gene. The fourth observed intron polymorphism, a C to T variation at intron position 389 (C389T) was found in association with three variations in exon 4: an already described C to T polymorphism in codon 311 (GenBank X13276, mRNA, nt position 956), 24 leading to an alanine to valine substitution, and two silent mutations, a G to T variation in codon 318 (nt 978), and a G to A variation in codon 321 (nt 987). Fifteen heterozygotes and one homozygote for these four polymorphisms were found in the group of 100 Belgian individuals. In one of these fifteen heterozygous individuals, the intron variation C429T was found. No deviations from expectations under Hardy-Weinberg assumptions were observed. Haplotypes were determined by sequence analysis of cloned PCR-amplicons in samples of individuals heterozygous for more than one variation. Five haplotypes were identified, and their frequencies are shown in Table 2 . The four linked variations, identified in samples of 16 individuals, were demonstrated to be present on the same allele, and this haplotype was detected with a frequency of 8.5%.
