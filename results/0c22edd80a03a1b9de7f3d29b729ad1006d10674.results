We aligned the GP1 sequences of MACV (residues 59-258) with those of JUNV, GTOV, and SABV to identify conserved residues mapping to the surface of the determined MACV GP1 crystal structure (DNAStar Lasergene Software). We identified ten residues of interest that did not contact hTfR1 in the co-crystal structure yet are conserved in at least three of these viruses: D140, W147, D155, D159, P160, K167, N178, and K211 (colored red, Fig. 1 ). We followed a strategy previously employed for virus receptor identification to evaluate the importance for TfR1 binding of these conserved residues, as well as GP1 residues recently indicated in the published MACV GP1:TfR1 crystal structure [17, 26] . Briefly, we designed codon-optimized open reading frames (ORFs) of MACV GP1D in which one or more of the chosen residues were mutated to alanine, and generated them by gene synthesis (DNA2.0). These ORFs were cloned into a pCDM8-like expression vector [17, 26] with the signal sequence of human CD5 upstream and the Fc region of human immunoglobulin G1 downstream of the ORF. Fc alone and wild-type MACV GP1D-Fc, which was described previously [17] , served as controls. Proteins were purified as described [17, 26] : the individual plasmids were transfected into HEK 293T/17 cells (ATCC) using the calcium-phosphate method and grown in 293 SFM II medium (GIBCO-Invitrogen). Media were harvested and clarified, and Fc fusion proteins precipitated with protein A-sepharose Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare). Fc fusion proteins were eluted with 3 M MgCl 2 , dialyzed in PBS, and concentrated. Purified proteins were assayed by SDS-PAGE followed by Bio-Safe Coomassie staining (BIO-RAD), and measured using the Quant-iT Protein Assay kit (Invitrogen). All mutant plasmids expressed proteins ( Fig. 2A) . We evaluated the ability of the individual mutants to bind to hTfR1 using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays as described [17, 22, 26] . Briefly, HEK 293T/17 cells were transfected with plasmid encoding hTfR1 [17, 22] and lysed 48 h post transfection with RIPA Lysis and Extraction buffer (Thermo Scientific Pierce). Cleared lysates were added to equimolar amounts (200 nM) of Fc, MACV GP1D, or variants thereof, and bound proteins were immunoprecipitated with protein A-sepharose Fast Flow beads. hTfR1 in the cell lysate immunoprecipitates was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot using the WesternBreeze Chromogenic kit (Invitrogen) and a murine monoclonal anti-TfR1 antibody (Invitrogen). Four mutants, D114A, D140A, K167A, and K169A, precipitated hTfR1 as efficiently as wild-type (wt) MACV GP1D or at slightly lower levels. Reduction in GP1 interaction with hTfR1 was observed with mutants S116A, K211A, and D114A/S116A (motif 2 in [1] ), whereas mutants R111A, Y122A, D123A, W147A, D155A, D159A, P160A, N178A, F226A, and the triple mutant Y122A/D123A/K169A effectively inhibited MACV receptor interactions (Fig. 2B) . We performed cell-binding assays as described [17, 26] to determine the ability of these mutants to bind to the surface of MACV-permissive cells. Briefly, Fc constructs were added to 5610 5 Vero cells (ATCC) to a final concentration of 200 nM. Cells with bound proteins were incubated with a 1:40 dilution of FITC-conjugated anti-human Fc antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell-surface binding of constructs was detected by flow cytometry. Baseline fluorescence was determined by measuring cells treated only with the secondary antibody, which was then subtracted from binding values of the tested constructs and control proteins. Overall, cell-binding of mutants supported the co-IP results as mutants that precipitated hTfR1 exhibited high cell-surface binding and vice versa (Fig. 2C) . Exceptions were Y122, S116A and D114A/S116A (motif 2), which bound the cell-surface of Vero cells as or almost as efficiently as wt MACV GP1D, yet exhibited lower hTfR1 levels in the co-IP assays. The K167A mutant exhibited an opposite trend, as it bound less efficiently to the cell-surface than wt MACV GP1D whereas it immunoprecipitated hTfR1 as effectively. We next tested whether gross misfolding was the reason for the inability of some of the mutants to precipitate hTfR1 and to bind to the cell-surface of MACV-permissive Vero cells. We performed far-UV circular dichroism (CD) of the wt GP1D and selected mutants (Fig. 2D ). Far-UV CD spectra were taken in PBS at 5uC with a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter and a 1 mm pathlength rectangular quartz cell. Protein solutions used were from 0.05 to 0.08 mg/ml. Ten scans were accumulated and averaged, without smoothing. The spectra all revealed a single broad minimum in the range of 108 to 216 nm. These results are consistent with similar folding of the wt and mutant proteins, although small changes in the conformation of the mutants cannot be ruled out (the Fc portion of the protein as well as GP1D contributed to the measured signal). We then cloned ORFs encoding mutant GP1s into plasmids expressing full-length MACV GPC. Retroviral pseudotypes were created as described [17, 26] : HEK 293T/17 cells were transfected by the calcium-phosphate method with plasmid encoding 1) MACV GPC and variants thereof, together with 2) the pQCXIX vector (Clonetech) expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) flanked by the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) long terminal repeats, and 3) plasmid containing the MoMLV gag/pol genes. Cell supernatants were cleared and measured using the Retro-X TM qRT-PCR Titration kit (Clonetech). Equivalent amounts of pseudotypes were adsorbed on MACV-permissive cells for 2 h. After 48 h, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) and the percentage of eGFP-positive cells was determined by high-content quantitative image-based analysis using an Opera confocal imager (Perkin Elmer). Cells exposed to mock pseudotypes (media of cells transfected with the pQCXIX vector and the MLV gag/pol plasmid) were used as negative controls. Western blot analysis of MACV GP2 expression in the producer cells (data not shown) and in the various MoMLV pseudotype preparations ( Fig. 3 lower panel) was performed using an antibody against MACV GP2 (New England Peptide) to examine expression, processing, and incorporation levels of wt MACV GPC and variants thereof. In agreement with the co-IP and cell-binding data, MoMLV carrying GPC mutants D114A, S116A, D140A, and K169A had no effect on entry into human (HeLa) and nonhuman primate (Vero) cells (Fig. 3) . Mutants D123A, D155A, P160A, F226A, K167A, and K211A had an intermediate effect on MACV entry, with the first four amino acids playing a more prominent role. Interestingly, MACV GPC mutant F226A had a much more pronounced effect on HeLa cell entry (.80% reduction) than on Vero cell entry (.40% reduction). D155A, P160A, and K211A mutants also exhibited decreased incorporation levels into MoMLV pseudotypes. However, as the cell-entry assay results are in agreement with our results using purified proteins (Fig. 2B and 2C) , we suggest that the observed phenotype is not due to decreased incorporation levels but due to the mutations themselves. MACV GPC mutants N178A and D159A were not incorporated into MoMLV pseudotypes and therefore were unable to transduce either cell line. MACV GPC mutant W147A behaved unexpectedly in that it had no effect on MoMLV transduction efficiency, despite its decreased precipitation of hTfR1 and attachment to the cell surface of MACVpermissive cells (Fig. 2) . We hypothesize that W147A might be misfolded in the context of MACV GP1D but folded correctly in the context of full-length GPC. The two mutants with the most significant effect on cell entry were the R111A mutant and the triple mutant Y122A/D123A/K169A, exhibiting more than 70% reduction in MoMLV transduction efficiency when compared to wt GPC. Finally, the Y122A mutant, while minimally affecting entry into Vero cells, decreased MoMLV entry into HeLa cells. This is in agreement with our assays using purified proteins (Fig. 2) , in which the Y122A mutant bound efficiently to the cell surface of Vero cells (Fig. 2C) yet was unable to immunoprecipitate hTfR1.
