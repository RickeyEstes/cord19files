We recruited 1821 participants from 856 households, across 40 communities. We achieved an overall household recruitment rate of 85.8% and an individual recruitment rate of 49.9%; recruitment was generally easier in rural locations (see the electronic supplementary material). Our study population are broadly representative though young children and 30-34-year-old adults are underrepresented, as are single person households. Overall, there were 12 147 unique contact events reported by participants, comprising 33 789 people encountered within unique contact events. Participants identified contact events, involving either face-to-face conversation or touch, which occurred in 4803 locations.
