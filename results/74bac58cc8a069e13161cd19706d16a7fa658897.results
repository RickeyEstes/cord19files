The analytical sensitivity of the fluorogenic RT-PCR assay was 10-100 times greater than the conventional nested RT-PCR (Herrewegh et al., 1995) . A dilution series of a modified life FCoV vaccine (Primucell-FIPâ„¢) was prepared and tested in triplicate by fluorogenic RT-PCR and by nested RT-PCR. Nested RT-PCR products were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Whereas the conventional nested RT-PCR detected the FCoV down to a 1:10 7 dilution (2 of 3 positive), the fluorogenic RT-PCR detected the whole virus even to a 1:10 9 dilution (1 of 3 positive) (Table 3) . To determine the reproducibility of the fluorogenic RT-PCR dilutions of the standard (50, 500, and 5000 molecules of standard RNA) and viral RNA (1:10 6 , 1:10 5 , and 1:10 4 dilutions of a modified life FCoV vaccine) were prepared. The precision within-run was tested by pipetting the same dilutions ten times on the same 96-well reaction plate, the precision from run-to-run by running the same dilutions in ten different RT-PCRs. In all RT-PCRs all standard samples and samples with viral RNA were detected. The coefficient of variation (in %) of the precision within-run and from run-to-run was in the range of 0.57 -1.50 and 1.16 -3.42, respectively (Table 4) . To assess the risk of cross-contamination, either by PCR products of previous reactions or during pipetting on the 96-well plate, 120 no template controls were included between the samples for reproducibility testing. To decrease the risk of cross-contamination, pipetting was performed in a laminar flow hood. The 96-well plates used in the 7700 ABI Prism system might generate a problem of cross-contamination because pipetting has to be done with the PCR tubes open. All the wells used are only closed with rows of linked caps after pipetting. However, none of the 120 no template controls gave a positive signal indicative for crosscontamination on the 96-well plate. The risk of cross-contamination can therefore be considered as very low, when pipetting is done in a laminar flow hood. To verify that the amplification efficiency of the FCoV standard RNA transcripts is equal to that of the same sequence within the viral genome, the efficiencies of amplification of both templates has to be shown to be approximately equal. A very sensitive method to compare the efficiencies of amplification is to compare the slope of the stan-dard curve of a standard RNA dilution series to the slope of the standard curve of a dilution series of complete virus particles. The efficiencies can be considered as equal if the difference of the slopes (Ds) is smaller than 0.1. In this approach, the Ds value was 0.06 (Fig. 2) , which proves that these standard RNA transcripts are reliable for FCoV quantification. Several isolates were used to determine the crossreactivity of this RT-PCR assay. The expected results, based on the sequence comparisons, were confirmed: all tested FCoV isolates as well as CCV, TGEV and PRCV were detectable, HCV 229E and PEDV were not detectable (Table 5) .
