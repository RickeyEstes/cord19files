The questionnaires were distributed to 4555 HCP, 3431 (75.3%; range, 72.5e85.5%) of whom responded during the study period. After excluding the questionnaires of 66 who did not work in the study hospitals during the outbreak, the results of 3365 (73.9%) were analyzed. The presence or absence of ILI was reported in 2681 (79.7% of 3365 The majority of the 141 infected HCP were female (74.4%) and <40 years of age (76.9%). Their job types were as follows: nurse (45.4%), physician (17.0%), nursing assistant (13.5%), technician (5.0%), and jobs not directly related to patient care (19.1%). They worked principally at the following facilities: non-influenza inpatient (23.0%), non-influenza outpatient (13.5%), influenza outpatient (8.5%), emergency (7.8%) and influenza inpatient departments (5.0%), and facilities not directly related to patient care (33.6%). The possible source of transmission was as follows: patients of the outpatient (45.7%) and inpatient departments (19.7%), those of the community (11.0%), HCP's colleagues (3.1%), and unknown sources (20.5%). Among all responding HCP, the rates of adherence to each part of isolation precautions were as follows, according to a four-point scale: wearing a mask always (32.2%), often (38.8%), rarely (24.4%) and never (4.6%); wearing a gown always (6.9%), often (9.2%), rarely (14.1%) and never (69.8%); wearing gloves always (15.4%), often (22.4%), rarely (25.6%) and never (36.6%); wearing goggles always (0.5%), often (2.2%), rarely (4.3%) and never (93.0%); washing hands always (54.2%), often (35.5%), rarely (7.9%) and never (2.4%). During the outbreak, 82.1% of 3183 HCP were vaccinated for seasonal influenza and 86.6% of 3235 for pandemic H1N1 2009. Among 2180 HCP who answered the major parts of the questionnaires and had data for ILI, the crude and adjusted odds of clinical factors for the development of ILI were calculated (Tables 1 and 2 ). Female gender, <40 years of age, the presence of chronic diseases associated with influenza complications, the presence of ILI or pandemic H1N1 2009 among household members of HCP, and the history of contact with infected patients were more commonly observed in HCP with ILI than in those without. Physicians, nurses and nursing assistants were at a higher risk for ILI than were HCP who had jobs not directly related to patient care. Regarding facility types, HCP who worked in influenza outpatient, influenza inpatient, non-influenza outpatient and emergency departments were at a higher risk for ILI than were those in facilities not directly related to patient care. The risk of developing ILI was lower in HCP who always wore a gown and gloves than in those who did not. In the multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for ILI were female gender, age <40 years, the presence of chronic diseases associated with influenza complications, and the presence of ILI or pandemic H1N1 2009 among household members of HCP. HCP who worked in influenza outpatient, influenza inpatient, non-influenza outpatient and emergency departments had higher adjusted odds for ILI than did those in facilities not directly related to patient care. Of 3135 HCP who answered the questions of the presence of ILI or pandemic H1N1 2009 in their households, 641 (20.4%) reported that at least one of their household members had ILI or pandemic H1N1 2009. Among those HCP whose household members exhibited ILI or pandemic H1N1 2009, 77 (12.0% of 641) cases occurred within one week prior to or after their household members becoming ill. Among these, 57 (74.0%) reported that ILI or pandemic H1N1 2009 occurred first in the HCP and then in their household members. Physicians and nurses were more common in these 57 than in the remaining 20 (12.3% vs. 5.3%; 45.6% vs. 36.8%). The remaining 20 subjects had jobs not directly related to patient care or worked in facilities not directly related to patient care more frequently than the 57 (31.6% vs. 19.3%; 60.0% vs. 34.8%). Also, the former more frequently had affected household members 19 years of age compared to that of the latter (84.2% vs. 57.4%, p Z 0.04) ( Table 3 ).
