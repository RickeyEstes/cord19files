All 10 patients included in this study were males. Their age ranged from 22 to 65 years (median, 35 years). All except one were foreign nationals. Half of our patients were classified as severe CHIKF. We defined severe CHIKF as having a temperature of .38.5uC or pulse rate .100/min, or platelet count ,100610 9 g/ L based on studies defining severe diseases [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Except for the Singapore resident, none had any pre-existing medical condition. Despite being previously healthy, four non-residents developed severe illness. Fever lasted 2-10 days, and fever duration was not significantly different between those who had more severe illness and those who had not (mean, 6.6 days vs. mean, 3.8 days; P.0.05). Two patients reported persistent arthralgia lasting more than two weeks. Demographic and clinical details of the 10 CHIKF patients are summarized in Table 1 . Among our patients, the most common clinical features were fever (100%), arthralgia (90%), rash (50%), and conjunctivitis (40%) ( Table 2 ). Gastrointestinal and constitutional symptoms were less prominent. Arthritis was observed in only one patient, who had an effusion on the right knee. None had neurologic involvement or hemorrhagic manifestation. Table 3 presents a summary of the key laboratory findings among our patients throughout the course of their illness. White cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate for most patients were within the normal range. The mean nadir platelet count (6SD) was 1996115610 9 /L. Only one patient had severe thrombocytopenia (nadir platelet count, ,100610 9 /L) during the course of his illness. Elevated C-reactive protein levels (CRP, .10.0 mg/L) were observed in 60% of patients, but the peak C-reactive protein level was not significantly different between those who classified as severely ill and those who were not (mean, 40.3 mg/L vs. mean, 9.9 mg/L; P = 0.195). The mean peak alanine and aspartate transaminases (ALT and AST) (6SD) were 58636 U/L and 50625 U/L respectively. Both ALT and AST were 2-fold greater than the upper limit of normal in one patient, who had pre-existing liver cirrhosis. None of the patients had a clinically abnormal total protein, urea or creatinine level. Among our patients, the mean nadir protein level (6SD) was 6765 g/dL, and the mean peak urea and creatinine levels (6SD) were 5.161.7 mmol/L and 101616 mmol/L respectively. Lactate dehydrogenase level was the only laboratory parameter that was significantly higher in severely ill patients, compared to those who were not (mean, 732 U/L vs. mean, 525 U/L; P = 0.047). Profiles of 30 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors were determined by a multiplex-microbead immunoassay on acute blood samples collected upon hospitalization. The samples collected ranged from day 2 to day 19 of illness (median, day 4.5). To characterize the overall patterns, a two-way hierarchical clustering analysis was done to allow the classification of individuals according to disease severity based on the clinical features ( Figure 1 ). Evidently, this had the power to discriminate the clinical forms of CHIKF in the samples in this study from the healthy controls, with patients classified as non-severe and severe disease segregating perfectly. The levels of 8 plasma cytokines (IL-2R, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15 and IFN-a) were observed to be most significantly elevated (Figure 2a ) in CHIKF patients compared to uninfected subjects (P,0.05). Among these was proinflammatory cytokine, IL-6 which was very significant. Interestingly, another proinflammatory cytokine, IL-8 was down-regulated in these patients. Anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 was found to be significantly raised in most of the patients (P,0.05). The plasma concentrations of IL-2R and IL-5 were found to be increased in all patients. Levels of IFNa and IL-7 were elevated in all patients. The levels of other cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, IFN-c, and TNF-a, were only marginally increased in the CHIKF group compared with those in the uninfected group ( Figure S1 ). Profiles of chemokines, IP-10 and MIG were shown to be significantly elevated, while Eotaxin was suppressed (Figure 2b ). There was no difference in the levels of other chemokines namely, MCP-1, MIP-1a, MIP-1b and RANTES ( Figure S1 ). Interestingly, the levels of 4 growth factors were found to be significant in the patients, with up-regulation of HGF, FGF-basic and VEGF, with the exception of EGF which was almost totally suppressed ( Figure 2c) . It was observed that the CHIKF patients exhibited low levels of GM-CSF and G-CSF ( Figure S1 ). Finally, in an effort to identify cytokine, chemokine, and growth factor plasmatic levels associated with severity, statistical analyses were performed after stratification of the CHIKF patients according to severity. It was observed that an increase in levels of IL-1b and IL-6, and a decrease in RANTES respectively were associated with disease severity (Figure 3a) . The levels of all other markers were not significantly different ( Figure S2 and S3).
