The studied communities were located within 95 km (severe neurological infectious disease) and 62 km (fatal respiratory infectious disease) of a surveillance hospital. In these communities, 76 of 426 severe neurological disease cases (18%, 95% CI 14%-22%) and 234 of 1,630 fatal respiratory disease cases (14%, 95% CI 13%-16%) attended a surveillance hospital. Adjusting for distance, the case detection probability was nearly twice as high among severe neurological disease cases than among fatal respiratory disease cases (risk ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.3; p < 0.001). At 10 km distance, an estimated 26% (95% CI 18%-33%) of severe neurological disease cases and 18% (95% CI 16%-21%) of fatal respiratory disease cases were detected by the hospital-based surveillance. The detection probability decreased with distance from the surveillance hospital, and the decline was faster for fatal respiratory disease than for severe neurological disease. A 10 km distance increase resulted in a 12% (95% CI 4%-19%; p = 0.003) relative reduction in case detection probability for severe neurological disease but a 36% (95% CI 29%-43%; p < 0.001) relative reduction for fatal respiratory disease (Fig 2C) . Including more complex functional forms of distance in the log-binomial regression models did not improve model fit based on AIC (Table A and Figs . B and C in S1 Text). The probability of detecting an outbreak of exactly three cases (if a single detected case was considered an outbreak) dropped below 50% at distances greater than 26 km for severe neurological disease and at distances greater than 7 km for fatal respiratory disease (Fig 3A) . Fig 3B  and 3C show the minimum number of cases required for surveillance to detect outbreaks with a probability of !90% if different outbreak thresholds are applied. For outbreaks defined as detection of at least one case, we found that an outbreak of fatal respiratory disease required 12 cases (95% CI 11-13) to be detected with 90% probability at 10 km from a surveillance hospital, but 30 cases (95% CI 24-39) to be detected at 30 km. In contrast, the impact of distance on the outbreak size requirement was much more limited for severe neurological disease: eight cases (95% CI 6-12) at 10 km and 11 cases (95% CI 9-14) at 30 km. For outbreaks defined as detection of at least two cases, 14 severe neurological disease cases (95% CI 11-20) and 20 fatal respiratory disease cases (95% CI 18-23) would be necessary for an outbreak to be detected at 10 km distance, and 19 severe neurological disease cases (95% CI 15-24) and 51 fatal respiratory disease cases (95% CI 41-66) at 30 km. The necessary outbreak sizes increased further when a five-case threshold was applied, so that 28 severe neurological disease cases (95% CI [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] and 39 fatal respiratory disease cases (95% CI 35-44) would need to occur for an outbreak to be detected at 10 km distance, and 36 (95% CI 30-46) and 97 (95% CI 79-128), respectively, cases at 30 km. Surveillance hospital attendance among community cases varied by case characteristics, leading sometimes to biased disease statistics among surveillance cases (Table B in S1 Text). For severe neurological disease, individuals aged <5 y represented 48% of community cases but only 29% of surveillance cases (p < 0.001). Additionally, the proportion of cases in the lowest socioeconomic group was lower among surveillance cases than among community cases (43% versus 57%; p = 0.012), while the proportion of individuals aged 15-59 y was higher (43% versus 29%; p = 0.005) (Fig 4A) . For fatal respiratory disease, the proportion of individuals aged !60 y (47% versus 62%; p < 0.001) was lower among surveillance cases than among community cases, while the proportion of individuals aged <5 y (24% versus 18%; p = 0.020), individuals aged 15-59 y (27% versus 18%; p < 0.001), and cases in the highest socioeconomic group (43% versus 37%; p = 0.022) was higher (Fig 4B) . We observed a slight difference in the proportion of females for fatal respiratory disease (34% among surveillance cases versus 38% among community cases; p = 0.108), but not for severe neurological disease (39% versus 40%; p = 0.861). Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses with age as a continuous variable and socioeconomic status classified into quintiles (Figs. D and E in S1 Text). A substantial proportion of cases (severe neurological disease 42% [95% CI 38%-47%]; fatal respiratory disease 26% [95% CI 24%-28%]) visited multiple healthcare providers during their illness. Forty-eight percent (95% CI 44%-53%) of severe neurological disease cases and 31% (95% CI 29%-34%) of fatal respiratory disease cases attended any hospital, including surveillance hospitals (Fig 5) . Including other hospitals that were attended by cases in the surveillance system could have increased the overall case detection probability by 31% (absolute increase) for severe neurological disease cases and 17% for fatal respiratory disease cases. The capacity to detect outbreaks would have increased, so that outbreaks containing four severe neurological or eight fatal respiratory disease cases would have been detected with !90% probability for any distance in the range 0-40 km from the original surveillance hospital, compared to 13 and 47 cases, respectively, with the current system ( Fig. F in S1 Text) . However, since individuals who attended any hospital had similar characteristics in terms of sex, age, and socioeconomic status as those attending surveillance hospitals (Fig. G in S1 Text), this expansion would not have increased disease detection in key groups such as the lowest socioeconomic group. Only with the informal sector incorporated in the surveillance system would cases in such groups be detected.
