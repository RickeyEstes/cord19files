The public hospitals had implemented the HICS earlier than the university (community) hospitals; and had also been provided with a budget with which to conduct relevant training programs. Background information for the participating hospitals is presented in Table 1 . The hospitals were located in 12 different cities including Tehran and 1-2 hospitals from each disaster regional collaborating center of Iran's Ministry of Health. Their location is not disclosed in detail due to confidentiality reasons, in accordance with WHO's recommendations. At the time of this study, there were 9 regional disaster centers of Iran's Ministry of Health. None of the participating hospitals had a hospital disaster plan. Only two hospitals had a designated Hospital Command Centre. The exercise included one of the following hazards; earthquake (n = 15), accident with hazardous materials (n = 5), and fire (n = 3). The lowest total HICS score was 56 and the highest was 119, with a mean of 85 (± 15 SD). The logistic and financial/administration sections received the highest scores, and the planning section had the lowest score ( Figure  1 ). The HICS and its main sections in the public hospitals had a higher performance than university hospitals (Table 3) , except for the operations section where there was no significant difference in performance (P = 0.07). Hospitals with both basic and advanced courses had a higher level of performance (89.2 ± 15.5) as compared to hospitals with only the basic course (77.1 ± 13.3), although the difference was not significant (P = 0.07). There was no significant difference between small and medium hospitals (P = 0.09). No large hospitals participated in the study. Public affiliation was the only independent predictor of the HICS performance (P = 0.04) in a regression model including medium size, public affiliation, advanced course, and earthquake scenario.
