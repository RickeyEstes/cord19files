In the present study, comparative genomics was performed on DENV sequences to find novel vaccine targets. For this purpose, all the ten proteins (3 structural and 7 non-structural) of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4 were analyzed individually by retrieving their partial protein sequences and motif analysis was performed by using MEME SUITE. These conserved motif sequences were then used for B-cell epitope analysis (Table 2) . For the matter of space and clarity, we are reporting the figures for one of the conserved epitopes in the main text, while the others are presented in the supplementary materials (Figs. 1-3, Supplementary data). In total 13 epitopes were found which were further checked for antigenicity, hydrophilicity and surface accessibility. The B-cell epitopes on native proteins are generally composed of hydrophillic amino acids on the protein surface that are topographically accessible to membrane-bound or free antibody. These epitopes tend to be located in flexible regions of an immunogen and display site mobility of epitopes which maximizes complementarity with the antibody's binding site, permitting an antibody to bind with an epitope that it might bind ineffectively if it were rigid. Surface accessibility and hydrophilicity of these predicted epitopes was therefore determined (Table 3 ). The flexibility of these epitopes and the presence of beta turn in their structure were also evaluated. Predicted epitopes of Envelope, NS1, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5 proteins were found out to be antigenic as their score was found out to be higher than the threshold value whereas, few antigens were found to be non-antigenic (Table 3 ). All the predicted epitopes were found to be flexible in nature (Table 3) .
