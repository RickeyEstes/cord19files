The first participant for this study was enrolled on March 22, 2002 ; the last was exited on August 12, 2003. Of 167 people whose eligibility was documented, 157 were enrolled, and 150 were monitored through the duration of their colds, for a total of 1,681 person-days. Of 570 documented callers, at least 160 couldn't be screened, usually due to inability to achieve telephone contact within the enrollment time limit. Reasons for exclusion during screening included symptom duration greater than 48 hours (97), allergic symptoms (43), and insufficient Jackson score (29) . Eleven prospective participants said it would take too much time, and two said we weren't paying enough. For the seven lost to follow-up, six could not be found despite multiple attempts, and one was unable to return from another state, but sent her data booklet documenting 2 days of symptoms past enrollment. For the 151 participants monitored past enrollment, sociodemographic data are portrayed in Table 2 . We obtained a fairly diverse sample in terms of age, gender, income, education, and smoking status; representation of minorities, however, was limited by the homogeneity of the study area. We defined the end of the cold as the last time the participant scored their global illness severity above zero, followed by 2 days of global severity marked zero. If global severity was marked above zero on the day after a single day of zero, the cold was defined to be continuing; however, if the day marked above zero was the 13th or 14th day, this was defined as the end of the cold. Symptom duration prior to enrollment varied from 0 to 49 hours (mean ϭ 30.9 hours). (One person was inadvertently enrolled 49 hours after first symptom began, and was monitored to end of cold. We chose to include this data in analysis.) Adding these hours to the total time from enrollment until last above-zero global severity, mean duration of colds was calculated to be 9.3 days (223 hours), with a standard deviation of 3.7 days (89 hours). A total of 24 (16%) of 151 participants continued to report being sick at the end of their 14-day monitoring period. Results confirmed the diversity of common cold symptoms, and supported the breadth of the WURSS-44 instrument. In this sample, at least once during the first 7 days of monitoring, 99% of participants reported nasal symptoms, 91% reported sore or scratchy throat, and 94% reported cough. Sinus pain or pressure (80%), chest congestion (73%), headache (88%), body ache (84%), feverishness (69%), sweats (55%), and chills (57%) were reported less frequently. Generalized discomfort was measured by the terms "feeling run down," "feeling tired," "lack of energy," and "loss of appetite," which were scored above zero at least once by 97%, 99%, 97%, and 81% of participants, respectively. Interference with thinking (86%), speaking (80%), sleeping (94%), and exercise (84%) was common, as were difficulties with accomplishing daily activities (86%), work outside the home (76%), work inside the home (76%), interactions with other people (87%), and living one's personal life (86%). These data support our contention that colds frequently include functional, quality-of-life domains that the Jackson scale does not address. Using retrospectively assessed Jackson criteria at enrollment, 59 (39%) of our sample had a sore or scratchy throat as their first symptom, 61 (40%) had colds starting with a nasal symptom, and only 8 (5%) started with cough. Simply summing severity points from the 43 items scored on a sevenpoint scale (excluding global change) the mean total WURSS score was 91.3 was at enrollment, with a SD of 48.5, and an interquartile range of 54 to 125. For those with continuing colds, this mean total score increased slightly to 93.5 on day 2, then dropped to 87.5 on day 3, to 79.2 on day 4, and to 74.1 on day 5, to 63.4 on day 6, to 57.5 on day 7, and to 53.8 on day 8. This downward trend continued, with scores stabilizing in the 40s for days 10 through 14 of illness (see Fig.  1 ). Responses to the global severity item followed this trend, with initial mean scores rising from 3.84 on day 1 to 4.03 on day 2, then falling gradually to just under 2 points by day 9. Individual items had mean severities ranging from 2.17 (feeling dizzy) to 3.98 (feeling tired), averaging over the first 3 days for those with these symptoms present. Although importance ratings were significantly associated with symptom severity and functional impairment, only a small proportion of the variance was explained, with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.25 to 0.48. (Because participants reported some difficulty rating the importance of symptoms that they were not experiencing, importance ratings reported here only include data when item severities were scored above zero.) The mean importance of items ranged from 2.54 to 4.22, with generalized symptoms and functional impairments generally reported as more important than specific symptoms. Table 3 displays mean importance by item. To arrive at these values, we first averaged within-person over time, then averaged among participants with valid data, in order to equally represent all participants. Starting without any a priori grouping of items, and seeking to discover and empirically verify illness dimensions, we performed a series of factor analyses, which led to the 10-dimensional structure displayed in Table 4 . Analysis followed procedures suggested by Kroonenberg and Lewis [22] , utilizing both exploratory and confirmatory common factor analysis using maximum likelihood estimation as a guide. Composite construct reliability was estimated using procedures originally suggested by Joreskog [23] , with details provided by Bollen [24] . Of the 42 items used in the models, a total of 36 fit neatly within the 10 dimensions, with 2 to 10 items per dimension. Reliability coefficients ranged from 0.62 to 0.93 (mean reliability was 0.83), and were all significant at P Ͻ 0.01 using Wald testing [25, 26] . Assessment of structural stability over time was evaluated by conducting two analyses. First, the 10-dimensional model pattern was constrained to be equal in a confirmatory factor analysis and assessed at four different time periods, two days from start of the study, three days, four days, and five days, the time frame when overall severity change was greatest. The 10-dimensional structure was supported by the lack of significant change in fit indices in this temporal analysis. Finally, the data from all five days were aggregated and a confirmatory factor analysis based on the 10-dimensional structure was derived. External validity was assessed by comparison to the SF-36 (4-week recall, reported at intake and exit), the SF-8 (24hour recall), and the Jackson scale, both reported daily. (The 24-hour recall version of the SF-8 was added after the study began, with 118 of 151 participants contributing SF-8 data.) Unadjusted pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficients of WURSS-44 with SF-36 were Ϫ0.42 at intake and Ϫ0.35 at exit (P Ͻ 0.01). (For the SF instruments, 100 corresponds to perfect health, with lower scores indicating worse health. For WURSS and Jackson, 0 would correspond to perfect health, with higher scores indicating worse health. Therefore, some coefficients are negative.) Comparing WURSS-44 with Jackson led to correlation coefficients ranging from 0.73 to 0.93 (P Ͻ 0.001). Comparing WURSS with SF-8 yielded correlation coefficients from Ϫ0.60 to Ϫ0.84 (P Ͻ 0.001). These associations were stronger than those between Jackson and SF-8, for which coefficients ranged from Ϫ0.55 to Ϫ0.78 (P Ͻ 0.001) (see Fig. 2) . A partial correlation analysis [27] adjusting for participant age, gender, education, income, smoking status, and illness severity as covariates yielded very similar results, overall, and over time, without indication of need for adjustment. Thus, the data supported our expectations that the WURSS-44 would display stronger associations with the illness-specific Jackson criteria and with general health quality of life instruments, than either of these would with each other. Furthermore, these associations appeared to be linear, stable over time, and not significantly affected by possible confounders. The range of the simply summed WURSS-44 (43 items summed) severity scores varies from 0 to 301 points theoretically (43 items times maximum of 7 points per item), and from 0 to 259 in our sample. Means of total daily scores were in the 90s in the first days of colds, when symptoms were worst, dropping rapidly after the second day of monitoring. As noted above, WURSS scores varied proportionately with Jackson, and inversely with the SF-8 and the SF-36. Comparing retrospective assessments of global change to prospective changes reported on WURSS, a minimal important difference (MID) of 16.7 points per day was calculated for the sum total score. Dividing this estimate of small but important difference by the square root of twice the mean square error of stable patients (280.0) yields a Guyatt responsiveness index of 0.71, suggesting that a randomized trial with two arms would require 92 participants to have ∼90% chance of detecting this level of daily change (assuming α ϭ 0.05 and β ϭ 0.10; two-tailed testing). Using identical methods, MID and responsiveness were calculated for individual items, which were then used as criteria for item reduction. (See Table 3 , and next paragraph.) Using a simply summed score, a MID of 1.56 was calculated for the Jackson scale, yielding a responsiveness index of 0.61 for the Jackson scale. This indicates that a two-armed trial would need 124 participants to detect this level of minimally important daily change. Similarly, an MID of 4.52 and a responsiveness index of 0.54 was calculated for the SF-8, indicating that an SF-8 powered RCT would need 156 participants to detect this level of daily change. To create a shorter instrument with equal or better psychometric properties, we used responsiveness and importance To weight each person's responses equally, data were first averaged within-person-over-time, then averaged among participants Items selected for the WURSS-21 are displayed in bold italics. a The 44th item on the WURSS-44 assesses global change (change since yesterday), and hence cannot be assessed in the same way as the 43 items portrayed here. b Frequency ϭ Scored above zero at least once in first 7 days of monitoring, c Severity and Importance ϭ Mean Ϯ SD; averaged over first 3 days; only for those with symptom present d Minimal important difference MID: Mean day-to-day change for those indicating minimal improvement. to patients as criteria for selecting the items highlighted in Tables 1 and 3 . The WURSS-21 included 10 items assessing symptoms, 9 items assessing functional impairments, and 1 item each assessing global severity and global change. Assuming that the 21 items embedded within the WURSS-44 would have the same psychometric properties when arranged as an independent WURSS-21 instrument, we calculated the MID to be 9.48, and the responsiveness index to be 0.80. This suggests that a two-armed trial of about 74 total participants would have ∼90% power to detect this level of daily change. Because importance and responsiveness were used as selection criteria for the short-form items, it is possible that the WURSS-21 will not perform quite as well as a stand-alone instrument, due to selection bias, regression to Factor analysis followed procedures outlined by Kroonenberg and Lewis [22] . Reliability and standardized loading coefficients estimated by methods of Joreskog [23] and Bollen [24] . Items measuring global severity and global change from the WURSS-44 were not included in the factor analyses. Of the 42 items included, the 36 shown here loaded into the 10 empirically assessed dimensions. a All reliability coefficients are significant at P Ͻ 0.01 using the Wald test [26] . the mean, or both. The WURSS-21 is now undergoing prospective validation as a stand-alone instrument. We advise potential users to power trials conservatively.
