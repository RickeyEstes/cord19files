In total, n = 4484 patients with n = 7316 follow-up visits were included. The number of follow-up visits included per patient ranged from 1 to 10 (Median: 1 visit). The median time on ART was 182 days (Interquartile Range: 70-336 days). Included patients were receiving care at n = 22 DI-supported sites. Approximately 40 % of patients were receiving ART at the Central Hospital (n = 1796) and 1929 (i.e., 43 %) were at least 9 weeks late for a visit. The CDF demonstrated that the majority of patients who were ≥1 week late and subsequently returned to care did so within the first 4 weeks of a missed visit, as per the initial sharp increase of the curve (see Fig. 1 ). Although fewer, patients who were ≥1 week late continued to return even after being 4 weeks late as demonstrated by the more gradual increase in the curve until approximately the 9-weeks-late cut-off. The curve then begins to flatten out, suggesting that the proportion of patients who returned for a subsequent visit decreased once a patient was approximately 9 weeks late for a visit. The hazard function (Fig. 2) shows two main spikes in the proportion of patients who returned relative to those who had yet to return, roughly at 4-week intervals, at 4 weeks and again around the 8-weeks-late cut-off. As in the CDF, Fig. 2 demonstrates that after being at least 9 weeks late, the proportion of new patients who returned relative to those who had yet to return decreased substantially.
