The patterns of dual nucleotide compositions based on the complete genomes of various eubacteria in Table 1 are 2-dimension dot-cluster graphs, as shown in Fig. 1 . To characterize the pattern of dual nucleotide compositions and to classify eubacteria, we focused on particular dot-cluster. A close look to Fig. 1 shows that dot-cluster in some graphs is mainly grouped into two clusters while those dots in other graphs is mainly grouped into one cluster. Now, we divide the grid coordinate system into two regions: I and II, as shown in Fig. 2 . Concentrations of dot-cluster changed markedly two main groups: ''S-Type'' represented by S. aureus and ''E-Type'' represented by E. coli. The conception about ''S-Type'' and ''E-Type'' is presented by Sorimachi and Okayasu (2004) . Here, concentrations of dot clusters are mainly inside Region I in ''S-Type'' whereas they are mainly inside Region II in ''E-Type''. The two groups are separated from each other by these dot-clusters. By using PCA algorithm, eubacteria is classified into two groups, ''S-Type'' and ''E-Type'', based on the dual nucleotides compositions calculated from the complete genome. In ''S-Type'', the patterns of the dot-clusters also show much difference each other. According to the relative location between main clusters, ''S-Type'' can be classified into two subgroups: (i) one subgroup includes the bacteria, S. aureus Mu50, Str. pyogenes M1, B. subtilis, R. prowazekii, C. perfringens 13 and B. burgdorferi. Concentration of dots of them is mainly in the left dot-clusters and (ii) the other consists of the following, L. monocytogenes, C. jejuni, M. pulmonis, H. pylori J99, H. influenzae, M. genitalium and H. pylori 26695. Concentration of dots of these bacteria is mainly in the right dotclusters. Similarly, ''E-Type'' can be also classified into two subgroups. The first subgroup includes those bacteria whose dots are classified into two clusters. They are E. coli, S. typhi, V. cholerae and Y. pestis. Concentration of the dots of the second is mainly one dot-cluster. They are M. tuberculosis, M. leprae, N. meningitides, T. pallidum, M. pneumoniae and U. urealyticum, respectively. The above results show that bacteria in Table 1 are grouped into two classes: S. aureus ''S-Type'' and E. coli ''E-Type'', based on their genomic structures. As Okayasu and Sorimachi (2009) reported both types ''S-Type'' and ''E-Type'', the above species were classified further into their subgroups based on amino acid compositions or codon usages. Similar results have also been obtained by Sorimachi and Okayasu (2004) .
