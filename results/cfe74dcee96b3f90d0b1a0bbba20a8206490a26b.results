All the participants received polio vaccines as planned. The total duration of follow-up was 614 person-years and the median duration 24.3 months. Altogether 89.8% of the children (92.2% of the OPV vaccinated and 89.2% of the IPV vaccinated) completed the entire follow-up. In the OPV group 3.1% and 4.7% of the subjects dropped out at the ages of 12 and 18 months, and in the IPV group 0.4%, 6.0% and 4.4% dropped out at the ages of 6, 12 and 18 months, respectively. A total number of 854 OM episodes were recorded with an average of 2.72 per child during the follow-up. The OPV vaccinated children had slightly less OM episodes during the first 2 years of life than the IPV vaccinated controls (average number 2.59 vs. 2.75 per child, IRR = 0.87 [95% CI 0.72-1.04]), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.121). Since the protecting effect of OPV probably occurred at the age when vaccine viruses were actively replicating in the gut mucosa (at the age of 2-18 months) and when the incidence of OM peaks (at the age of 6-18 months), the numbers of OM episodes were further analyzed between the age of 6 and 18 months. A significant difference was seen between the OPV and IPV groups in the number of OM episodes during this age period (1.58 vs. 1.88 episodes per child, IRR = 0.76 [95% CI 0.59-0.94], P = 0.011). The protective effect of OPV was even stronger among subjects who had started daycare already at the age of 12 months or earlier (P = 0.003; Fig. 2 ). All these analyses were adjusted for the effect of possible confounding factors, i.e. for daycare, pets, breastfeeding and number of siblings.
