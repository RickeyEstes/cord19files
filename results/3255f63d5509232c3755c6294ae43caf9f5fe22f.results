From 2013 to 2015, data of 4,080,766 ED visits were collected in the NEDIS (Table 2. ). Among them, 303,469 (7.4%) had initial body temperature equal to or higher than 38.0Â°C, and 388,943 patients (9.5%) were diagnosed with a designated respiratory infectious disease code (Table 2. The number of daily febrile ED visits and patients with final ED diagnosis of respiratory infectious disease was plotted together in Fig. 2 . They showed moderate to strong correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.86, p b 0.01, Fig. 1) . The expected number of febrile visits by the forecast ARIMA model was plotted simultaneously with the observed number of febrile ED visits as well as number of patients with infectious respiratory disease diagnosis (Fig. 2) . To validate the forecast model, we simulated our forecast model for ED visit data of 2015. Figs. 3 and 4 show the results of the simulation of the forecast model using ED-based syndromic surveillance throughout the entire year of 2015 and the first quarter of 2015. The number of patients with respiratory infectious disease spiked concurrently with the alarms generated by the forecast model using ED-based syndromic surveillance (Figs. 3, 4) . A total of 29 days of 1-day alarms, 72 days of 3-day alarms, and 133 days of 7-day alarms were generated by the forecast model in 2015 (Table 3 ). According to length of alarm duration, sensitivity and specificity varied respectively.
