The UspA1 CEACAM1-binding site is part of an extended trimeric coiled-coil Initially, to probe the structural basis of the bacterial ligandhost receptor interaction, we determined the crystallographic structure of the UspA1 (527-665) fragment. Although this region incorporates several regions with predicted low propensity for coiled-coil formation (Hoiczyk et al, 2000) , UspA1 (527-665) The arrangement of proposed domains in UspA1 with the approximate regions of the binding sites for CEACAM1, laminin and fibronectin is shown. The latter two are located in the N-terminal region (UspA1 residues 299-452 and UspA2 165-318 for fibronectin (Tan et al, 2005) , and UspA1 299-452 and UspA2 30-177 for laminin (Tan et al, 2006) ), and by analogy with YadA (Nummelin et al, 2004) are likely to be within the head group. The bacterial cell membrane is at the bottom of the schematic. CEACAM1 is shown approximately to scale (represented here by the crystal structure of similarly sized CD4; Wu et al, 1997) bound to an epithelial cell membrane (top left). (B) Proposed model for bending of UspA1 in association with binding of CEACAM1 to allow adhesion and infection, as supported by the current study. was found to form a contiguous, extended coiled-coil structure within the crystal lattice ( Figure 2 ). Whereas earlier estimates of UspA1 oligomer composition were ambiguous, the crystal structure confirms that three polypeptide strands coalesce to form a left-handed trimeric coiled-coil. In each chain, there is clear electron density for 135 of the 139 amino acids with four residues (527-530) being disordered at the N terminus of each chain (this and all subsequent sequence numbering refers to UspA1 from the M. catarrhalis MX2 strain). As the trimer lies along the crystallographic threefold axis, the conformation of each monomer within the trimer is identical. There are two monomers within the asymmetric unit and both are highly similar (root mean square deviation of all equivalent Ca's ¼ 1.3 Å ). The resulting rod-like structure is approximately 200 Å long and 20 Å in diameter. To our knowledge, UspA1 (527-665) forms the longest segment of triple coiled-coil for which a high-resolution structure has been determined. Overall, the average periodicity of the coil is 3.5 residues per turn with a pitch of about 150 Å , close to the expected hypothetical geometry (Lupas, 1996) . Analysis of the structure with the coiled-coil software SOCKET (Walshaw and Woolfson, 2001) identified 84 'knobs into holes' interactions; all are of type 4 with packing angles of between 45 and 601 as commonly observed in trimers. Although UspA1 (527-665) appears to adopt a classic trimeric coiled-coil structure, there are a number of surprises. Whereas most of the internal hydrophobic residues (positions a and d by the standard convention; Lupas, 1996) are a mixture of alanines, isoleucines, valines and asparagines-as expected for trimeric coiled-coils-this pattern is disrupted at residue 573 when, unusually, a histidine is incorporated at a d position within the core. This is seen again three turns later at histidine 584 (position a) and then further after another 12 turns at histidine 629 (position d). For both histidines 584 and 629, the potential charge these residues incorporate within the core appears to be ameliorated through the incorporation of a bound phosphate ion. These ions are located equidistant (3.0 Å ) from the histidine of each monomer ( Figure 2B and C). The histidine rings are partially orientated through formation of a bifurcated hydrogen bond between each phosphate oxygen, a bound water, the main chain carbonyl group of Leu 580 (at His 584) and interactions with the neighbouring side chain of Ser 630 (at His 629). It is not clear whether binding of these phosphate ions, presumably from the crystallisation buffer, is biologically relevant. We also observe density consistent with eight chloride ions bound within the central core of the coiled-coil ( Figure 2D ). These are present when an asparagine residue is encountered in the central cavity of the coiled-coil (position d), and in each instance the ions interact via the amide nitrogen of the asparagine side chain with distances ranging from 3.1 to 3.2 Å . Chloride ions have been observed previously in the central core of a number of similar structures including those of fibritin (Tao et al, 1997) and the spike glycoprotein from the SARS coronavirus (Duquerroy et al, 2005) and are proposed to add specificity in aligning the individual monomers of the coiled-coil. Finally, the degree of helical supercoiling relaxes towards the C terminus where there is a stutter in the sequence starting from Ser 657 (three residues of the heptad appear to be missing) and a decrease in supercoiling is evident. Because of the breakdown in the pattern of core hydrophobic residues, this distortion is likely to be inherent within the sequence rather than a response to the artificial truncation of the coiled-coil within this recombinant construct.
