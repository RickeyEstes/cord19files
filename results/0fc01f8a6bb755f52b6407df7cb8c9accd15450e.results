Increased expression of P2X7R in PBMCs from patients with RA. We tested the expression of P2X7R on PBMCs in 19 patients with RA and 22 age-matched normal individuals using quantitative real-time PCR. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 , P2X7R had higher expression levels in the RA group than in the control group, indicating that the P2X7R expression specifically unregulated in RA patients.
