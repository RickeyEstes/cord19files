Sporadic cases of SARS began to be identified after March 14, 2003 , when the first SARS victim was identified in Taiwan. The fulminant period of the SARS epidemic was from April 22 to May 22, 2003, with an average of 9.3 (95% CI, 7.4-11.1) patients per day with a confirmed diagnosis. In the study hospital, 273 suspected SARS patients were admitted via the ED and 75 had a confirmed diagnosis of SARS. As shown in Figure 1 , a significant decrease in daily ED attendance occurred in April, reaching a nadir in May with a mean standard deviation of 115. 4 Figure 1A ). The mean decrease in daily ED visits had a significantly positive correlation with the monthly number of confirmed SARS patients island-wide (p = 0.01). The maximum mean decrease in the percentage of monthly visits during the outbreak compared to 2002 was 51.6% in May (95% CI of mean difference, 47.8-54.1%; p < 0.01). Monthly visits then gradually increased, reaching comparable pre-outbreak levels in November 2003, 4 months after the end of the SARS epidemic ( Figure 1B ). (EDs), especially those who had low-emergency and non-severe diseases. 8 The immediate effect of SARS was to decrease the number of patient visits to the ED. Analysis of the impact of SARS on ED visits and costs may be useful in developing plans to optimize limited health care resources when the next outbreak of a highly infectious disease occurs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the SARS epidemic on ED visits and expenditures in a designated SARS facility. 11 and costs of all patient visits to the ED were retrieved from the hospital computer database for analysis. The total expenditure for services provided and items for each patient included the costs of ED registration and bed, physician services, laboratory investigations, radiography, ancillary procedures and treatments, prescription medications, and other costs per item or service. These costs were included in the computer files of each patient's bill, which listed all the items and services consumed. The expenditures of all patients visiting the ED were covered under the National Health Insurance program.
