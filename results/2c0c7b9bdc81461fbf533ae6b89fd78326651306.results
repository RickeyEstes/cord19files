Enhanced FV immune protection after co-administration of adenoviral vectors expressing FV proteins and specific type I IFN subtypes We generated E1-, E3-deleted Ad5-based vectors with wild-type or chimeric Ad5/35 fiber encoding murine type I IFN subtypes IFNα1, IFNα2, IFNα4, IFNα5, IFNα6, IFNα9 or IFNβ. The identities of the IFN subtypes were verified by sequencing. and similar expression levels and biological functionality were demonstrated in an established bioassay [20] (data not shown). F-MuLV Env and Gag encoding adenoviral vectors were described previously [18] . Highly FV-susceptible CB6F1 mice were immunized with 1 × 10 9 viral particles (VP) each of F-MuLV Envand Gag-encoding Ad5 vectors and boosted with the same dose of Ad5F35 vectors three weeks later (see Additional file 1, Figure S1 for a schematic outline of the experiment). In contrast to our previous work in which we immunized with 5 × 10 9 VP of each vector (1 × 10 10 VP total dose) [18, 19] , this reduced-dose immunization was chosen because it induces only moderate protection on its own, enabling us to analyze the beneficial effect of vectored type I IFN co-administration on vaccine protection. Mice received the adenovirus-vectored F-MuLV antigens co-administered with vectors encoding the selected type I IFN subtypes described above; as a control, one group of mice received the adenoviral vectors encoding F-MuLV Env and Gag and were coadministered vectors encoding luciferase as an irrelevant transgene in order to administer equal amounts of adenoviral particles to all mice. Three weeks after the boost immunization the mice were challenged with FV and the spleen size as a surrogate marker for disease progression was monitored by abdominal palpation. While the immunization of mice with the reduced dose of F-MuLV Env-and Gag-encoding vectors alone did not result in significant protection against initial splenomegaly, coadministration of adenoviral vectors encoding IFNα2, IFNα4, IFNα6 or IFNα9, but not IFNα1, IFNα5 or IFNβ, resulted in significant reduction of FV-induced splenomegaly (P < 0.05; shown in Figure 1A and 1B for days 14 and 17 post-challenge (p.c.)). Improved protection after co-administration of the four IFN subtype vectors was confirmed when animals were sacrificed and spleen weights were measured on day 21 p.c. (Figure 1C ). At this time point, the spleen weights of all vaccinated mice were significantly lower than of unvaccinated control mice demonstrating a moderate protective effect of the low-dose vaccination with F-MuLV Env-and Gag-encoding Ad5 and fiber-chimeric Ad5F35 vectors. However, protection against splenomegaly was significantly improved when mice had been co-administered vectors encoding IFNα2, IFNα4, IFNα6 or IFNα9 (P < 0.05). To ascertain that the observed effects of type I IFN coadministration were due to a modulation of the immune response to the vaccination and not to a direct antiviral effect of residual IFN expression, mice were administered type I IFN encoding vectors alone and challenged afterwards with FV according to the same scheme. Here, no differences in the control of FV-induced disease were observed ( Figure 1D ).
