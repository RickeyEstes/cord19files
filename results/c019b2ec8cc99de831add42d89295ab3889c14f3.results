During the first study period 32 patients were registered as diagnosed with ARDS and treated using the PP. A total of 38 cases of the PP were obtained, as 2 patients were placed in this position twice and 2 patients were placed in the prone position three times while in the ICU. In the second study period, after reviewing the clinical histories and determining the degree of compliance with the quality standard recommended by the SEMICYUC in connection with the PP procedure, 3 cases (7.9%) with incomplete records were detected. While in one case the procedure had not been recorded, in the other two although the procedure and the appearance of DU had been recorded, neither the grade nor the location of the latter had been documented. Subsequently the severe complications associated with the PP procedure were analysed together with the factors possibly associated with them in the remaining 35 cases, as the documentation of the incomplete records was not considered to be very reliable. The sociodemographic and clinical variables (age, sex distribution, days of admission in the ICU and main diagnoses) are shown in Table 1 , where the most frequent diagnosis is pneumonia. The severe complications associated with the PP procedure that the SEMICYUC includes in the quality standard are shown in Table 2 . This shows that the incidence of severe complications due to the turning process (extubation, catheter withdrawal and ETT obstruction) is 0%, and that the only serious complication recorded is DU, with an incidence of 25.7%. These are associated with admission in the PP, and they are mainly grade 2 DU. 88.9% of the DU documented were grade 1 and 2 (reddening and blisters). A total of 9 DU were registered, of which 2 were grade 1 and 6 were grade 2. The grade 1 DU described were located on the ears, cheeks, chin and back of the foot, and the grade 2 ones were on the cheeks, eyelids, abdomen, genitals and scapular waist. Only one grade 4 DU was found, located on the thorax (in the zone of the breast). In 22.8% of cases a facial oedema was registered following the period of lying in the prone position, so that the appearance of conjuntival oedema was recorded in 14.3% of the procedures that were analysed. In connection with nutritional variables, such as hours in the PP, the administration of prokinetic drugs and muscle relaxants, nutrition catheter type and the nutrition given (Table 3) , the high percentage of patients in the PP who were given muscle relaxants stands out (80%), as does the high percentage of prone patients who did not receive suitable nutrition (82.9%). In connection with the possible factors associated with the appearance of DU and as may be seen in Table 4 , although the average number of hours in the PP is higher in patients with DU, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.067). On the other hand, as can be seen in Table 5 , more DU were recorded in those patients who had not received appropriate nutrition, although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.577).
