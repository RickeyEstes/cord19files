Major assumptions in the framework. Throughout this paper, we consider only global spread of epidemics with relatively fast timescales in which epidemics in each population peak within 300 days after establishment (e.g., pandemic influenza, MERS, Ebola) such that changes in demographics (e.g., births, aging) is negligible. In metapopulation epidemic models, populations (e.g., cities) around the world are connected through the travel of individuals via the WAN (see WAN metapopulation epidemic model in Methods for details). We designate population i as the epidemic origin which is seeded with s i infections at time 0. For any given population j, we denote its population size by N j and initial epidemic growth rate by λ j . If populations j and k are directly connected in the WAN, the mobility rate from population j to k is defined as w jk = F jk /N j , where F jk is the direct airtraffic (passengers per day) and w jk ranges mostly between 10 -6 and 10 -3 per day in the WAN ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Let T n ij be the time at which population j receives its nth imported infection. The epidemic arrival time (EAT) for population j is defined as T 1 ij . Our framework is built upon the following assumption 19, 21 . Assumption 1: Suppose populations j and k are directly connected in the WAN and only population j is infected. Exportation of infections from population j to k is a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NPP) 22 with intensity function w jk I j (t) where I j (t) is the disease prevalence (number of infectives) in population j at time t (see Details on assumption 1 in Methods for details). Supplementary Figure 2 shows that assumption 1 is very accurate for a wide range of plausible epidemic scenarios. We will show that the dynamics of global spread is largely analytically tractable because the following assumption is also accurate across these same scenarios. Assumption 2: After the epidemic has established in a given population j, the first few exportations occur while disease prevalence is still growing exponentially, i.e., I j t ð Þ ¼ s j exp λ j t À Á . To this end, we progressively build up our framework by characterizing the probability distribution of EATs for all populations in three metapopulation networks with increasingly complex structure: (i) The two-population network which has the simplest metapopulation structure; (ii) the shortest-path-tree of the WAN (WAN-SPT hereafter) which is the dominant subnetwork driving global spread of epidemics as described by the seminal study by Brockmann and Helbing 20 ; and (iii) the WAN. The two-population network. In the two-population network, the origin population i is only connected to population j. Under assumption 2, the probability density function (pdf) of T n ij can be expressed in closed-form: where α ij = w ij s i , which we term adjusted mobility rate. Figure 1 shows that if n is smaller than 10, Eq. 1 is accurate across a wide range of realistic scenarios (e.g., the percent error in expected EAT is uniformly below 2%), which correspond to epidemics ranging from pandemic influenza (with doubling time around 4 −5 days) to Ebola (with doubling time longer than 20 days). This result leads to the following corollaries for the WAN-SPT and WAN analysis: (i) Exportation of the first n infections is essentially an NPP with intensity function α ij exp λ i t ð Þ; and (ii) the expected time of the nth exportation is given by which corresponds to the (n−1)th exportation for an epidemic that starts at time T 1 ij with seed size s i exp λ i T 1 ij . These analytics can be used to formulate closed-form likelihood functions for inferring parameters from disease surveillance and global spread data (see Methods).
