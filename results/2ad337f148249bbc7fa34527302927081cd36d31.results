During the study period, 112 patients were admitted to the infection unit. Of these, 98 patients (54% female) were isolated in a designated isolation room. These patients used 808 bed-days, with a bed occupancy of 98%. Of the isolated patients, only 44% (NZ44) were considered to be a potential communicable infection risk, although 83% (NZ81) were thought to have an infection and 80% (NZ78) were appropriately admitted according to the local admission guidance (Table I) . Patients thought not to have an infection used 99 bed-days (12% of total bed-days). Patients thought not to be an infection risk used 418 bed-days (52% of total bed-days). Table II summarizes these results and shows comparisons, using the same criteria, with our previous audit cohort. Table III shows a comparison of admission diagnoses before and after implementation of the local admission guidance.
