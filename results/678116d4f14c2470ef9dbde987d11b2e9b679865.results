The Adjuvants Improve the HI Antibody Levels of the Monovalent Vaccine Groups of chickens were administered either one dose or halfdose of ND vaccine with or without CVCVA5. Serum antibodies against ND significantly enhanced in chickens given the ND vaccine mixed with CVCVA5 when compared to those chickens, which received the ND vaccine without CVCVA5 at 2, 3, and 4 weeks PV (Figure 1A) , respectively. Furthermore, the chickens given ND-CVCVA5 vaccine, the HI titers in the group vaccinated with half-dose (0.15 ml) were similar to the group, which received one dose (0.3 ml). However, the dose-effects were observed in the chickens injected with ND vaccine without CVCVA5. In groups of chickens, which received the commercial vaccine without CVCVA5, the HI titers of the chickens given half-dose vaccine were significantly lower than those chickens, which received with one full dose. Enhanced efficacy was examined in the CVCVA5-adjuvanted univalent EDS or IBD vaccine in the chickens. The antibody titers in the groups, which received a half-dose of EDS or IBD adjuvanted vaccines produced similar to the levels as those chickens with one single dose of the adjuvanted vaccines, respectively, while significantly higher than those groups, which received one or half-dose of EDS ( Figure 1D ) or IBD (Figure 1J ) vaccine without immunopotentiators. Chickens from three groups vaccinated with CVCVA5adjuvanted inactivated M41 vaccine had higher antibody levels than the other three groups that received no CVCVA5. This included groups with the H120 prime and M41 booster vaccine, only with a single dose of live H120 vaccine, or with a single dose of inactivated M41 vaccine only ( Figure 1G) . Chickens that received the half-dose of adjuvanted M41 vaccine group elicited similar HI antibody levels as birds given one full dose of adjuvanted M41 vaccine.
