In total, 947 bats (867 insectivorous and 80 frugivorous), representing seven different families and 31 species, were collected at 52 sites in all six provinces of Madagascar: Antananarivo (n = 44 bats), Antsiranana (n = 125), Fianarantsoa (n = 178), Mahajanga (n = 207), Toamasina (n = 37), and Toliara (n = 356). The sampling sites included 22 different caves (n = 480 bats), 18 buildings (n = 290), and 12 different forested areas (n = 177). Thirty-one sites (n = 664 bats) contained at least two species and 21 sites (n = 283) were monospecific. The sampling sites were in different elevational zones, ranging from low (0 to 800 m, n = 40 sites), mid (801 to 1000 m, n = 6), and high (over 1000 m, n = 6), with 761, 101, and 85 bats collected in each zone, respectively. Seventeen sites were sampled in dry (n = 384 bats), 22 in sub-arid (n = 382), 11 in sub-humid (n = 144), and two in humid (n = 37) bioclimatic zones. Twenty-two sites (n = 377 bats) were visited during the summer (warm, wet) season and 30 sites (n = 570) during the winter (cool, dry) season. Ninety-nine of 947 bats (10.5%) tested positive for PVs by RT-PCR, giving a global infection rate of 11.1% in insectivorous bats and 3.8% in frugivorous bats (df (degrees of freedom) = 1; n = 947; χ 2 P = 0.02). The infection rates varied according to province, from 4.5% in Antananarivo to 15.2% in Antsiranana (df = 5; n = 947; χ 2 , P = 0.01). The infection rates of PVs for bats living in caves, buildings, and forests were 12.9%, 7.9%, and 7.9%, respectively (df = 2; n = 947 χ 2 , P = 0.041). The fraction of sites hosting PV positive bats among the 31 multispecies sites and the 21 monospecific sites were 70.9% and 61.9%, respectively (df = 1; n = 947; χ 2 , P > 0.05). The infection rates for PV were 11.4% in multispecies sites and 8.1% in monospecific sites (df = 1; n = 947; χ 2 , P > 0.05). Infection rates at individual sites varied from 2.0% at ANJHB to 38.1% at VINT with no PV positive bat at 17 sites (n = 121) (see Fig. 1 for identification of sites and associated acronyms). At low, middle, and high elevation, the fraction of sites hosting PV positive bats was 67.5%, 83.3%, and 50.0% (df = 2; n = 947; χ 2 , P > 0.05), respectively, and the mean positive rates were 11.4%, 8.9%, and 3.5%, respectively (df = 2; n = 947; χ 2 , P > 0.05). In the humid, sub-humid, sub-arid, and dry bioclimatic zones, the percentages of sites hosting PV positive bats were 50.0%, 54.5%, 72.7%, and 70.6%, respectively (df = 2; n = 947; χ 2 , P > 0.05) and the mean positive rates were 5.4%, 6.3%, 12.0%, and 10.9%, respectively (df = 2; n = 947; χ 2 , P > 0.05). PV positive rates were 7.9% and 12.1% for bats captured during the summer and winter seasons, respectively (df = 1; n = 947; χ 2 , P = 0.038). Sites with UMRVs detection rates higher than 20.0% are indicated on Fig. 1 . Six of seven sampled bat families yielded PV positive individuals, with the exception being Hipposideridae, for which the only Malagasy species is Hipposideros commersoni ( Table 1 ). The highest PV detection rate was in the family Rhinonycteridae (39.3%) and the lowest in the family Pteropodidae (3.8%) (df = 6; n = 947; χ 2 , Scientific RepoRts | 6:23752 | DOI: 10.1038/srep23752 P < 0.001). Half of the sampled species (16/32) contained PV positive individuals. The highest PV infection rate was in Triaenops menamena (n = 21/42; 50.0%) and the lowest in Miniopterus mahafaliensis (4/89; 4.5%) (df = 31; n = 947; χ 2 , P < 0.0001). Insectivorous species had significantly higher detection rates (96/867; 11.1%) than frugivorous species (3/80; 3.8%) (df = 1; n = 947; χ 2 , P = 0.02). No significant difference was found associated with sex and age classes, regardless of diet, habitat or site (χ 2 , P > 0.05). Model construction procedure lead to a binomial Generalized Linear Model (GLM) explaining individual infection based on seven different effects (Table 2) . Among abiotic factors, Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) had an overall effect where, Mean Annual Rainfall (MAR) did not show any overall relationship with infection. However, relationships between rainfall and infection appeared different across multi-versus single-species sites with a quadratic effect observed for MAR. Habitat type and the multispecies characteristics did not show any significant effects, but showed marginal interaction. The multispecies sites show higher infection rates, compared to monospecific sites, for caves compared to buildings and forest capture sites (Fig. 2) , reinforcing the important role of multispecies bat environments on PV infection. Diet was also associated with viral infection (Table 2) , with higher infection among insectivorous bat species, whereas, age and sex did not show any significant relationships. Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with species, locality, and province as random factors were tested separately and did not improve the fit, but models with family, species and locality failed to converge due to numerical issues in model estimation. We conducted a Bayesian analysis on the PV sequences generated from positive Malagasy bats together with PV GenBank sequences from Madagascar and elsewhere in the world. All new PV sequences presented in this study were identified as UMRVs, as they appeared more closely related to morbilliviruses 17 (Supplementary Figure S1 ), than to any other genera of the Paramyxoviridae family. The UMRVs were characterized by a high level of genetic variability and nucleotide sequences varied from 62.0 to 100% sequence identity. Only two sequence pairs of the 99 that tested positive were identical. Although URMVs showed weak exclusivity to their bat host species, two phylogenetic patterns were identified: (i) closely related UMRV sequences were hosted by bat species and families that are phylogenetically closely related, particularly those occupying day roost sites in the same caves i.e., Miniopterus griveaudi and Myotis goudoti at AMBB; Miniopterus gleni and Miniopterus sororculus at BEK; (highlighted in blue in Fig. 3 ). This feature suggests that host-switching events might be favored by physical proximity between phylogenetically closely related bat taxa. (ii) some degree of host-specificity for URMVs was found, with individuals of one host species having closely related UMRVs, independent of other individuals occurring at the same roost site, (i.e., Triaenops menamena at VINT TSP, and ANDRF2) highlighted in green, or distant sites, (i.e., Triaenops menamena at VINT and TSP), highlighted in red on Fig. 3 . In some cases, a correlation was observed between the distance separating capture sites and the degree of nucleotide sequence similarity of the infecting PVs across sites. More specifically, conspecifics living on distant sites host UMRVs that display lower level of nucleotide similarity than those infecting bats at sites in closer geographical proximity (i.e., Triaenops menamena at VINT and TANA, Miniopterus griveaudi at AMBB and ANJHK1, and Miniopterus griveaudi at ANDFR and AMBB) highlighted in yellow in Fig. 3 . This suggests that increasing geographical distance favors virus genetic differentiation and/or low levels of virus migration between bat roosting sites. Using CoRe-PA, we performed a consensus phylogram for both viruses and bats, presented along with their tanglegram depicting bat-virus associations (Fig. 4A ,B). By evaluating 5000 random cost schemes, CoRe-PA computed the most parsimonious reconstruction and predicted the frequencies for co-evolutionary events, including co-speciation, host-switching, duplication, and sorting. For the generated 24 OTUs subset (Table 3a) , the best quality value obtained was 0.256 for a solution with eight co-speciation events, 21 duplications, 52 sortings, and 19 host-switches. For the 39 OTUs subset, CoRe-PA produced 57 reconstructions (Table 3b) , with a quality value of 0.25 and five co-speciation events, 33 duplications, 57 sorting, and 24 host-switches. Hence, for both sets, no clear evidence of co-speciation between UMRVs and bat species was found. The statistical analysis suggests fewer co-speciation events in the data set than expected by chance (99.0% of randomized data sets showed more than eight co-speciation events) but more host-switching events than expected (100% of randomized data sets showed less than 19 host-switching events) (Fig. 5A,B) . Thus, notwithstanding the numerous identified duplication and sorting events, host-switching events appear to be the predominant aspect in the evolutionary history in UMRVs identified from Malagasy bats, as compared to co-speciation. We quantified the degree of congruence between bats and UMRVs topologies, and the potential individual associations for each of the two OTU subsets. The hypothesis associated with independent speciation events could not be rejected by ParaFit (ParaFitGlobal = 38.62571; P = 0.067), for the 24 OTUs subset, whereas a significant overall pattern of association (ParaFitGlobal = 46.158; P = 0.002) was calculated for the 39 OTUs subset. Eight of 50 (16.0%) individual host-virus links were significant, based on a P < 0.05 for the 90.0% threshold, and 19 out of 60 (31.7%) for the 98% threshold. Tables S3a and S3b summarize the different associations of UMRVs with their respective hosts and the corresponding P-values for the two OTU subsets. Among the different bat species, Triaenops menamena was the most coupled species for both OTUs subsets, and Miniopterus mahafaliensis for the 39 OTUs subset. Depending on nucleotide identity, we observed a discrepancy of the global association signal, which is related to specificity increasing genetic variability by increasing the number of clades (i.e., increasing the nucleotide acid identity between sequences).
