e subjects of this study were a total of the 86 infants. ey presented with respiratory symptoms and suspicion of pneumonia. Among them, 46 (53%) were male and 40 (47%) were female, and the sex ratio was 1.15. e mean age was 31 ± 19 days. 54% of the patients were of middle socioeconomic status, 45% had low socioeconomic status, while only one of them was of a high socioeconomic status. According to the parents, 4 (5%) families had a pet at home, 44 (51%) had dampness at home, and 11 (13%) had lived with smokers ( Table 1) . All patients included in this study were conscious and had at least one respiratory symptom with a high frequency of dyspnea, representing 95% of the cases. Cough, rhinorrhea, and fever were frequent with 67%, 62%, and 38%, respectively ( Table 2) . 84% of our patients performed chest X-ray , where 62% were abnormal. 91% of the cases with abnormal chest X-rays results showed a confirmed infection (p < 0.004) using the RT-PCR technique (Table 3 ). Mean duration of hospitalization was 6 ± 5 days; the length of stay of the dead infants was not included, and it was 10 ± 4 days. During this period, 3% of deaths and 10% of complications by nosocomial infection were detected. e results of multiplex RT-PCR showed the presence of 7 types of viruses and one species of bacteria. At least, one pathogen was detected in 71/86 of the samples (83%). e most prevalent virus was RSV, detected in 46/86 of the samples (51%), where type A and B represented 59% and 41%, respectively. In the total of the samples, IV A represented 4% whose one patients had a subtype of IV H1N1, RV was detected in 20/86 (23%) of samples, ADV was detected in 2/86 (2%) of samples, Cor229E in 10/86 (12%) of samples, hMPV was detected in 5/86 (6%) samples, and PIV4 was detected in 2/86 (2%) of samples. 6% of the patients had Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coinfection was seen in 22 specimens representing 26% of all samples (22/86) and 31% of positive samples (22/71). In the case of co-infection with two viruses, 19 samples were positive. Coinfection virus/bacteria were detected in 4 cases. e most frequently detected coinfection combinations were RSV/rhino (n � 7) and RSV/Cor229E (n � 6) ( Table 4 ). According to our study, the seasonality distribution of viruses varies, the graphic shows that viral infections are essentially present in the coldest season (autumn and winter), when the seasonality of some respiratory viruses is not well established. RSV A and B were the most prevalent viruses; they appeared frequently in September and December. e cases with IV A were detected in January, February, and July; influenza H1N1 was detected in February. Cor229E was most predominant in May. RV was detected during the study without any pick. e other viruses hMPV, ADV, and PIV4 were less frequent ( Figure 1) . We compared the epidemiological, clinical, and radiological characteristics between the positive (83%) and negative samples (17%). e proportion of positives in males was 62% (44/71, p < 0.001). e rate of prematurity presented 64.3% in the positives cases (p < 0.04). For the rest of the general characteristics (including age, socioeconomic status, and environment of the patient), the comparison between the two groups does not show any significance (Table 1 ). Most clinical signs and symptoms were present in both groups, with a higher frequency in the positive group. e difference was not statistically significant. Nasal flaring was present only in positive cases with a p < 0.006 (Table 2 ).
