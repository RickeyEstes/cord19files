Temperature does not significantly change the kinetic parameters of Sf6 and OmpA binding. We purified the transmembrane domain of S. flexneri OmpA ("OmpA-TM S.flex " [23] ), confirmed we had functional OmpA-TMs by our previously reported assays [23, 25] ,and then measured the ability of OmpA-TMs to induce Sf6 genome ejection in vitro prior to performing BLI experiments. For all BLI experiments described herein, the ligand, Sf6, was immobilized on amine reactive (AR2G) sensors. OmpA-TMs reconstituted into detergent micelles were used as analytes. To ensure that sodium acetate, pH 4.0 buffer (a low pH buffer in which phage are not typically stored, but which was necessary for tethering to sensors) had no effect on the phage, we monitored the titer of the phage stock over time, comparing it to phage stored in phage dilution buffer, pH 7.6, and found no significant differences. Moreover, we tested the ability of OmpA-All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

In addition, Sf6 binding to OmpA-TM S.flex was specific, as phage Sf6 did not bind to other outer membrane proteins. To determine kinetic parameters of Sf6 and OmpA-TM S.flex binding, we measured the change in interference patterns over time to generate sensorgrams at 25, 30, and 37 o C (Figure 1 ). The generated data were fit in GraphPad prism to a global 1:1 association -then -dissociation model ( Figure 1 ). Calculated kinetic parameters are shown in Table 1 . The analyte concentrations tested ranged from 62.5 nM to 1,000 nM. Consistent with our hypothesis and published results from other bacteriophage and host receptor biosensing work [12, [30] [31] [32] 34, 35] , OmpA-TM S.flex bound Sf6 with nM affinity that varied only slightly with changes in temperature. Based on the calculated parameters in OmpA-TM S.flex bound Sf6 with relatively fast-on and slow-off kinetics. Overall, these data suggest that temperature differences do not significantly affect Sf6 binding to OmpA. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

Goodness-of-fit is described by χ 2 [36] ; the lower the χ 2 , the better the model describes the fit of the data. In addition to χ 2 , the one-state model was the only one to pass the F test, a standard statistic for ensuring validity of a kinetic model [37] . Additionally, equilibrium binding analyses of the data shown in figure 1 yielded K D s of 82.3, 99.6, and 89.9 nM (Table 1) which are all essentially indistinguishable from each other and in reasonable proximity to the constants derived from the kinetic models, i.e. the secondary component (seen with all OmpA-TM variants) is minor and probably reflective of some artifact rather than biology, e.g. ligand presentation. Another potential explanation is that detergent micelle size varies within a preparation, yet is usually smaller than the membrane-inserted portion of a single OmpA β-barrel (~19 kDa) [38] . Therefore, in some cases OmpA stoichiometry within micelles may be a 1:1, but in other cases, multiple micelles likely aggregate around a single OmpA protein, as reported in [38] . This variance likely explains at least part of the complex behavior of our data at high analyte concentrations, and why the residuals are not random at these concentrations. Sf6 genome ejection efficiency is highest at physiological temperatures. We were surprised that the binding kinetics did not change greatly with temperature as phage ejection can often be affected by temperature [8, [39] [40] [41] [42] . Therefore, we tested if Sf6 genome ejection was affected in vitro using our standard assay [23, 25] and measured the efficiency of genome ejection at 25, 30, and 37 o C (Figure 2 ). Reactions were incubated for 10 minutes, which is within the timeframe of the lengths of BLI association phases. Consistent with previously reported data, at 37 o C the majority (>95%) of Sf6 virions have lost their genomes at 10 minutes post initiation of ejection [23, 25] . However, as temperature decreased, the observed genome ejection efficiency in vitro All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. [23] and it was thought that these changes may be due to differences in binding affinities. We purified various OmpA-TMs: one from E. coli, "OmpA-TM E.coli " and four that deviated by single amino acid substitutions from the native S. flexneri sequence (D66A, N67E, P111E, and N155E). These variants were chosen to represent a broad range of phenotypes [23] . Here, we measured the kinetics of Sf6 binding to these various receptor types using BLI and calculated the kinetic and affinity constants for each ( Figure 3 , and Table 2 ). Again, some complexity was evident but a simple 1:1 binding model fit the data better than two-state parallel or conformational change models. The only exception was the lowest analyte concentration for N67E ( Figure 3 , magenta line), for which global fits did not converge, and was therefore eliminated from the analysis. The calculated parameters were consistent with fast-on and slowoff kinetics. OmpA-TM E.coli and all S.flexneri OmpA-TM variants bound Sf6 with nM affinity; the K D s ranged between 6.9 and 65.4 nM. The kinetic parameters of binding for the variants differed only slightly when compared to those of OmpA-TM S.flex . Moreover, the small differences observed do not correspond to the phenotypes previously reported [23] . For example,
