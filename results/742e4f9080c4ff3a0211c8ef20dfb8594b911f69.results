A total of 290 water samples were collected and analyzed for waterborne pathogens, with several of the pathogens having very low occurrence analyzed for only 162 of the 290 samples, during a 29 month period across eight sampling locations (Table 2) . A total of 189 samples were collected during runoff-event periods and 101 samples were collected during low-flow periods. Streamflow during runoff-event and low-flow periods by sampling location are presented in supporting information (Table S6 , Fig. S1 ). Human and bovine viruses were detected more frequently and had higher concentrations than pathogenic bacteria (p < 0.05), and protozoa were not detected during the study (Table 2 ). More detailed interpretations on pathogenic bacteria results are not further discussed due to their low frequency of occurrence across the eight sampling locations.
