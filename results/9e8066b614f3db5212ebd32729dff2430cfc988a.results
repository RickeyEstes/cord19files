A total of 1,241 calves were reared in the 8 farms during the sampling period. Of these, 63 (5%) had signs of diarrhoea, almost all cases occurring during seasons S1 and S2 (Fig. 1) . The prevalence of affected animals in the different farms was up to 21% (Table 1 ) and the incidence varied between farms and between sampling occasions from 0% to 39% (Fig. 1) . Fifty-four out of the 63 diarrhoeal calves (86%) were found in farms F3 (n=31) and F6 (n=23) ( Table 1) .These farms were thus considered as high prevalence farms. The incidence of diarrhoea appeared to be higher during the rainy seasons. In 1994, more diarrhoeal cases were observed in the rainy season and, in 1995 all diarrhoeal cases were found during the rainy season (Fig.1) . A total of 393 faecal samples were collected from healthy (n=330) and diarrhoeal (n=63) calves. Salmonella (n=8) was found in 3 farms in both healthy (n=5) and diarrhoeal (n= 3) calves. According to serotyping they belonged to 5 different serovars: S. Ohio, S. Newport and S. Uganda in diarrhoeal calves and S. Arhus, S. Newport, S. Typhimurium and S. Uganda in healthy calves. Campylobacter was isolated from 44 samples -7 from cases of diarrhoea and 37 from healthy calves. In farm F3 a significant difference was observed in the rate of Campylobacter in all calves (p= 0.001) compared to the remaining farms ( Table 2) . Out of 40 isolates subject to species identification, 32 (80%) belonged to C. jejuni and 8 (20%) to C. coli. The former species was more often found in farm F3 (18/32) while the latter was relatively more common in the other farms (7/8) (p=0.05). E. coli was found in 76% of the calves, and no significant difference between prevalence in healthy and diarrhoeal calves was observed. A total number of 6,757 isolates from 252 healthy (5,670 isolates) and from 47 diarrhoeal calves (1,087 isolates) were subject to typing with the PhenePlateâ„¢ system. Most faecal samples showed the presence of one dominating PhP-type and a few single types. The diver-sity among E. coli isolates in diarrhoeal calves was similar to that of healthy calves (0.949 and 0.958 respectively). Fiftyfive representative strains from diarrhoeal calves and 88 from healthy calves were tested for the presence of K99 antigen (Table 3 ). The K99 antigen was more prevalent in diarrhoeal calves 22/55 (40%) than in healthy calves 14/88 (16%) (p=0.001). Furthermore, the K99 antigen was more prevalent in the diarrhoeal farms than in the other farms (p= 0.009). The presence of genes for enterotoxins STa and LT was investigated by PCR on the same selected 55 strains from diarrhoeal calves and, since all the results were negative, the isolates from healthy calves were not further assayed for STa and LT genes.
