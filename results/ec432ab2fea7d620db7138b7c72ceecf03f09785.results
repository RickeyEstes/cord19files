A CRISPR screen for genes important for EBOV replication. Genome-wide screens using gene-trapping, siRNA or shRNA methods have been used to identify host-factors required for filovirus infection 12, [17] [18] [19] . Here, we performed a whole-genome CRISPR screen using the GeCKOv2 library in Huh7.5.1 cells 29 , and used authentic EBOV (Mayinga strain) to infect the librarytransduced cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3 ( Fig. 1) . Extensive cell death occurred in the infected culture. Surviving cells were then expanded, their genomic DNA was extracted, and their single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences were determined. Several genes with significantly enriched sgRNAs were identified (Table 1 , Supplementary Data 1 & 2) . NPC1 was the top-ranked hit with 5 of 6 sgRNAs enriched. The second hit was Spinster-like 1 (SPNS1), which encodes a putative sugar transporter involved in lysosome function 30 . The third hit was Solute Carrier Family 30 Member 1 (SLC30A1), which encodes Zinc Transporter Protein 1 31 . Further work will be required to confirm a role for these proteins in EBOV infection. Other hits included the previously reported subunits of the HOPS complex VPS16, VPS33A and VPS18 (Tables 1 and 2) . UVRAG (Ultraviolet Radiation Resistance-Associated), which is required for influenza A and VSV entry 32 but not previously implicated in EBOV infection, was also found. CTSL was only a minor hit, while CTSB was not significant. Altogether, these results suggested that our screen was capable of identifying genes required for EBOV infection. With three of six sgRNAs enriched, GNPTAB was a strong hit in our screen and also in that of Carette and colleagues 12 , and we decided to further investigate its role in EBOV infection. GNPTAB is required for efficient EBOV infection. To determine if GNPTAB has a role in EBOV infection, CRISPR genome editing was used to generate a clonal GNPTAB-knockout HAP1 cell line or, as a control, a NPC1-knockout cell line. Mutations in the gene of interest were confirmed by sequencing. Since the selection in our screen was based on the survival of transduced cells following EBOV infection, we first tested the viability of these cells after infection. The parental HAP1 cells, and GNPTAB − and NPC1 − derivatives, were infected and their viability was determined 6 days post infection. Due to EBOV-induced cytopathic effect, the viability of the parental HAP1 cells was reduced tõ 25% of that of mock-infected cells, whereas the GNPTAB − and NPC1 − remained~90% viable after infection (Fig. 2a) . When these cells were infected with recombinant EBOV expressing the fluorescent reporter protein ZsGreen 33 (EBOV-ZsG), robust fluorescence was observed in parental HAP1 cells; fluorescence was lower in GNPTAB − cells, and lowest in NPC1 − cells (Fig. 2b ). This effect was not due to differences in cell growth, as mockinfected cultures had similar growth rates ( Supplementary Figure 1a) . We tested the ability of these cells to support infection by wild-type EBOV and found~170-fold less virus yield in GNPTAB − cells than in parental HAP1 cells ( To confirm a role for GNPTAB in EBOV infection, lentiviruses expressing GNPTAB with a C-terminal myc-tag (GNPTAB-myc), or β-glucuronidase (GUS) as a control, were used to transduce parental HAP1 or GNPTAB − cells. We did not detect endogenous GNPTAB (three different commercially available antibodies were tested), but could detect GNPTAB-myc in the appropriately transduced cell populations (Fig. 3a, b) . Each of the transduced cell lines still expressed NPC1 (Fig. 3b ). When infected with EBOV, the GNPTAB − cells transduced to express GUS (GNPTAB -+ GUS) remained refractory to EBOV-induced cell death, whereas the viability of those reconstituted with GNPTAB-myc was significantly reduced (Fig. 3c ). In addition, the GNPTAB-myc reconstituted cells supported infection by EBOV-ZsG, whereas infection remained impaired in cells transduced to express GUS (Fig. 3d) . The ability to support EBOV infection was not correlated with growth rate, as each grew similarly (Supplementary Figure 1b) . In addition, the growth of LASV-ZsG was similar in each of the reconstituted cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2c) . Altogether, our data indicate that GNPTAB is required for efficient EBOV infection of the haploid cell line HAP1.
