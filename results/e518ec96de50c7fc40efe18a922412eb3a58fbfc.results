Virus specificity of the HSV-CTL assay ( Fig. 1) The specificity of the MV-CTL assay as well as the FLU-CTL assay has been established in pre-vious investigations. The specificity of HSVspecific CTL was examined by comparison to both MV-specific CTL and FLU-specific CTL. In experiment 1, CTL generated to MV lysed MVinfected targets but failed to lyse HSV-infected targets. Similarly, CTL generated with HSV lysed HSV-infected targets but not targets infected with MV. In experiment 2, CTL generated to FLU lysed FLU-infected targets but not HSV-infected targets, while similar virus specificity was demonstrated by C-I'L generated to HSV.
