Temporal, spatial, and demographic patterns of exposure Wolf CPV seroprevalence was 100% across all years, locations, pups, and adults ( Table 3 ; thus none of the wolf models were relevant for Table 4 or S2). The best-supported models ( By contrast, wolf and coyote exposure to CDV varied annually. The best-supported models for CDV exposure suggested constant, low pup exposure and a year effect among adults. There was also marginal support for a model with year and location effects among both wolf pups (D AIC c = 2.04, weight = 0.24) and adults (D AIC c = 2.11, weight = 0.26) which exhibited a much better fit, particularly to the pup data. Among adult coyotes, the bestsupported models included year and resident effects. While the best-supported model for juvenile coyote seroprevalence suggested constant, near-zero exposure, the model exhibited poor fit to 2 years of the data (i.e., 1999 and 2005; Figure 1 ). The probability of CDV exposure among wolf pups was highest in 1999, 2002, and 2005, a pattern less clearly mirrored in the adult data (no year effect was significant) (Figure 1 , Table S3 ). Between these three outbreak years, there was evidence for a small amount of seroconversion among pups (20-33% in 2000, 2001, 2003 , and 2004; Figure 1 ). In addition, both NR pups and adults had as much as a 36% and 14% positive difference, respectively, in their probability of exposure compared to their Interior counterparts (pups: OR = 4.25, 95% CI: 0.97, 18.54; adults: OR = 1.72; 95% CI: 0. 36, 8.25) . Both juvenile and adult coyote seroprevalence mirrored the temporal patterns among NR wolf pups; CDV seroprevalence was 100% in 1999 and 2005 among both age groups and 0% otherwise among juveniles (year effects were not significant; Figure 1 ). Furthermore, adult resident coyotes had as much as an 18% positive difference in the probability of CDV exposure compared to adult transients (OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 0.41, 10.18), although this difference was not statistically significant. The best-supported model for wolf exposure to CHV included a covariate for age class; however, wolf CHV seroprevalence was uniformly high (87%) and estimated probabilities of exposure were 1.0 for all three age classes (95% CIs, juveniles: 0.97-1.0; young adults: 0-1.0; old adults: 0-1.0). Among coyotes, the two competing models with nearly equal AIC c weights suggested support for age class and resident status covariates in the risk of CHV exposure. The probability of CHV exposure among coyotes significantly increased with age class; juveniles had the lowest probability of exposure (Pr[E] = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.38; seroprevalence = 23%), followed by young adults (Pr[E] = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.89; seroprevalence = 51%), and old adults (Pr[E] = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99; seroprevalence = 87%). Although not statistically significant, resident coyotes had as much as an 11% positive difference in their probability of CHV exposure compared to transients (OR = 1.58, CI: 0.59, 4.18). The four best-supported models for N. caninum exposure among wolves suggested that age class, year, and location were important covariates (Table 4 ). Wolves' probability of exposure increased with age; old adults had the greatest probability of exposure to N. caninum There were too few fox samples to look for patterns of exposure, but we did find evidence for fox exposure to CPV, CAV-1, CDV, and CHV (Table 5) . Wolf-pup survival and correlations with pathogen exposure Between 1995 and 2007, we annually monitored an average of 9 (SD = 4, range = 2-15) wolf dens, or an average of 84% (SD = 14%) of reproducing packs. Although the best-supported model for annual wolf-pup survival included only year and location covariates, there was also model support for a year*location interaction (Table 4 ). Pup survival was significantly lower on the NR than in the Interior (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.49) (Figure 3) . Although there was no significant year effect common to both NR and Interior wolves, the probability of survival was significantly lower among NR pups in 2005 (Pr[Survival] = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.33) (survival = 13%) when compared to most years, and lower than average, but not significantly so, in 1999 (Pr[Survival] = 0.37, CI: 0.12, 0.71) (survival = 37%) (See Figure 3 for a comparison of 95% CIs). Although the 95% CIs on the NR survival estimates from 2005 overlap with those of 1995 and 1996, the latter's confidence intervals are almost certainly too large. Survival estimates in these two years were derived from censuses of the small, closely monitored, reintroduced population, and thus were both accurate and precise. Annual wolf-pup CDV seroprevalence coincided with significant variation in annual pup survival on the NR (r 2 = 0.69, t = 24.51, df = 10, P = 0.001), although this was not the case in the Interior (r 2 = 0.02, t = 0.48, df = 10, P = 0.65). None of the other viral pathogens (CPV, CAV-1, and CHV) exhibited significant temporal variation capable of explaining temporal patterns of pup survival. Annual wolf-pup survival was independent of annual pup exposure to N. caninum (NR: r 2 = 0.18, t = 21.39, df = 10, P = 0.20; Interior: r 2 = 0.09, t = 20.91, df = 10, P = 0.38).
