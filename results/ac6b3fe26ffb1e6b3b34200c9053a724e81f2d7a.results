DD363 is an ISRE-luciferase-inducing antiviral compound. DD363 was first selected in a chemical screen because, compared to other tested molecules, it significantly stimulated the expression of the ISRE-luciferase reporter plasmid transiently transfected in HEK-293T cells (6.2-fold induction at 56 M in the initial screen). DD363 is 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-4H-furo [3,2-c] chromen-4-one, which corresponds to a novel chemical series never reported before (Fig. 1A) . It is different from DD264 that we previously identified in the same screen (8), although parts of the molecule exhibit similarities (Fig. 1A) . To confirm DD363 activity, this compound was tested in a dose-response experiment on STING-37 cells, a reporter cell line derived from human HEK-293 cells by stable transfection of the ISRE-luciferase reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 1B , a 3-fold increase in luciferase expression was observed upon DD363 treatment. This is slightly inferior to the results obtained with DD264 but in a similar range. DD363 and DD264 are, however, weak inducers of the ISRE-luciferase reporter gene compared to recombinant beta interferon (IFN-␤) (Fig. 1B) . Nevertheless, we decided to further characterize this molecule and evaluate its antiviral activity in secondary assays. At first, HEK-293T cells were infected with a recombinant strain of measles virus (MV) expressing luciferase as a reporter of viral replication (MV-Luc) and then treated with increasing concentrations of DD363 for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2A , DD363 efficiently inhibited MV growth, as assessed by decreased levels of luciferase activity in cultures. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of DD363 (mean Ϯ standard deviation [SD] ) was estimated to be 11 Ϯ 3 M in this assay (Table 1 ). The inhibition of MV-Luc was persistent at 48 h postinfection but was partially lost at 72 h and limited to the highest concentration of DD363, suggesting that the virus progressively overcame the antiviral effects (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). We also showed that DD363 at 30 M reduced by 1 log the production of infectious MV particles in cell cultures, as determined by virus titration at 48 h postinfection (Fig. 2B) . Besides, this compound showed limited cytotoxicity at these concentrations ( Fig. 2A) , as determined by quantification of the number of living cells in DD363 versus dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)treated wells after 24 h of culture. Under these conditions, the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) of the molecule (mean Ϯ SD) was estimated to 87 Ϯ 7 M. However, kinetic studies showed that DD363 essentially inhibited cellular proliferation rather than killed cells at concentrations below 60 M. Indeed, the number of viable cells increased less rapidly in DD363-treated cultures but did not collapse below the initial number of cells seeded at T ϭ 0 h (Fig. S1B) . Furthermore, the fraction of dead cells in cultures did not increase from 0 to 72 h of culture, and it always remained below 15% in the presence or absence of DD363, as assessed by flow cytometry analysis (LIVE/ DEAD fixable green dead cell stain kit; data not shown). Then, DD363 antiviral activity was tested on two other RNA viruses: chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). HEK-293T cells were infected with CHIKV and treated with DD363 or DMSO alone for 24 h, and cells were immunostained for the expression CHIKV glycoprotein E2. As shown in Fig. 2C , DD363 efficiently suppressed CHIKV replication in these cells. Inhibition by DD363 was also confirmed by the infection of HEK-293T cells with a recombinant strain of CHIKV expressing Renilla luciferase as a reporter of viral growth ( Fig. 2D ; mean Ϯ SD IC 50 ϭ 3.6 Ϯ 0.6 M) (19) . Similarly, DD363 was found to inhibit HCoV-229E growth in human MRC5 cells (Fig. 2E) . We also showed that DD363 reduced the cytopathic effects of HCoV-229E, as assessed by quantifying the number of viable cells in infected MRC5 cultures (Fig. 2F ). Altogether, this demonstrated that DD363 is active against different negative-strand (MV) or positive-strand (CHIKV and HCoV-229E) RNA viruses, while it also inhibits cellular proliferation. Structure-activity analysis of DD363 analogs. To characterize structural features that account for DD363 activity, we first decided to separate the two enantiomers from this racemic mixture, as they could differ in their antiviral potencies. Thus, enantiomers of DD363 were separated by chiral chromatography and tested on HEK-293T cells infected by MV-Luc. Interestingly, only one of the two enantiomers (ϩ) exhibited antiviral potency (Fig. 3) . Altogether, this demonstrated that there are spatial requirements with respect to the connection between the indole moiety and the 2,3-dihydro-4H-furo[3,2-c]chromen-4-one. To further identify chemical features accounting for DD363 potency and select for more potent molecules, a set of 17 structural analogs was synthesized (see supplemental material) (20, 21) . The antiviral potencies of these compounds were tested on HEK-293T cells infected by MV-Luc, and the corresponding IC 50 s are reported in Table  1 and Fig. 4A . Interestingly, the addition of a halogen group (DD776, DD771, and JP52), a methyl (DD778) group, or an ethyl group (JP49) at position R1 increased the antiviral potency (2-to 9-fold higher than for DD363; Table 1 ). As a control, DD778 was shown to inhibit not only MV ( Fig. 4B and Table 1 ) but also CHIKV ( Fig. 4C ; IC 50 ϭ 1.4 Ϯ 0.2 M) replication, with an increased potency compared to DD363 (Fig. 2D ). Then, highly potent analogs with a halogen group (DD771) or a methyl group (DD778) at position R1 were further modified at position R2, R3, R4, or R5 (Table 1 ). The addition of a methyl group at position R2 showed no major effect on the antiviral potency (DD775). In contrast, all compounds modified on the indole moiety were much less potent (JP10, JP25, DD783, and DD784), suggesting that this part of the molecule is essential (Table  1 ). We have also tested analogs of DD363 and DD771 without a nitro group on the furan ring ( Fig. 4A ; JP42 and JP46, respectively). Although DD363 and JP42 showed comparable antiviral potencies, JP46 was much less potent than DD771 (9-fold decrease). Besides, opening the furan ring (JP39) led to some loss of the antiviral potency, supporting the role played by this part of the molecule (Fig. 4A) . Other structural modifications were tested on 2,3-dihydro-4H-furo[3,2-c]chromen-4-one, showing no benefit (DD787) or abrogating the antiviral potency (DD785 and DD786; Fig. 4A ). Furthermore, replacement of the indole moiety group by a 3-chlorophenyl group (DD311; previously described in reference 20), as in DD264 (8), greatly decreased the antiviral activity by comparison with DD363 (Fig. 4A) . Altogether, this established structure-activity relationships for this chemical series, and analogs that are up to 9-fold more potent than the initial hit DD363 were identified. DD778 is an inhibitor of pyrimidine biosynthesis. As mentioned above, DD363 was selected from a screening campaign together with DD264, a compound subsequently characterized as an inhibitor of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis (8) . Although DD363 and its active analogs are chemically unrelated to DD264, they have similar antiviral properties and capacities to induce the ISRE-luciferase reporter gene. This suggested a similar mode of action. We thus determined whether DD778, one potent analog of DD363 showing a better selectivity index, could inhibit de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis like DD264. To address this question, HEK-293T cells were treated with DD778 or DMSO alone, and nucleoside levels in cellular extracts were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and spectrophotometry analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A , uridine (U) and cytidine (C) levels collapsed in DD778-treated cells, whereas purine levels (A and G) were unaffected. This demonstrated that DD778 interferes with pyrimidine metabolism and homeostasis. Of its multiple functions, uridine is also required to synthesize UDP-sugar complexes, which are essential to protein glycosylation. We thus determined whether DD778 could also alter intracellular levels of UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) and UDP N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNac). UDP-Gal collapsed in DD778treated cells, as predicted. Surprisingly, UDP-GalNac was maintained at high levels, suggesting that specific mechanisms help secure intracellular concentrations of this metabolite (Fig. 5B) . We then determined if the lack of pyrimidine nucleosides in DD778-treated cells accounts for the antiviral potency of this compound. Thus, HEK-293T cells were infected with MV-Luc and then cultured with DD778 in a medium supplemented with either uridine or precursors of pyrimidine nucleoside biosynthesis, including dihydroorotate (DHO) or orotate (Fig. 5C ). Uridine and orotate were found to restore viral replication in DD778-treated cells, as assessed by luciferase expression, whereas DHO showed no effect. This established that low levels of pyrimidine nucleosides account for the inhibition of viral growth in DD778-treated cells. Furthermore, the fact that orotate but not DHO could revert the antiviral effects of DD778 suggested that DHODH, the fourth enzyme of pyrimidine biosynthesis that converts DHO to orotate, is the target of DD778 (Fig. 5C ). This is in line with previous reports, including ours, showing that DHODH is the target of numerous broad-spectrum antiviral compounds (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) .
