Downregulation of miR-122 by HCV is attributed to the core protein We analyzed miR-122 expression levels in human liver biopsies from healthy subjects and patients with HCV (S1 Table show the characteristics of the liver biopsies used in this study) and observed decreased miR-122 levels in liver specimens from patients (66 ± 3.7%, 72 ± 0.7%, and 74 ± 1.9% decreases in liver biopsies HCV-1, HCV-2, and HCV-3, respectively from patients infected with HCV) compared with those in the normal liver N-1 (Fig 1A) . In the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh7, which is widely used in HCV studies because of its capability to support HCV replication, the miR-122 level was found to be approximately 100-fold lower than that in the normal liver N-1 (1.25% of miR-122 levels in N-1). In this cell line, HCV infection elicited a 70 ± 1.5% decrease in miR-122 levels at 2 days post infection (Fig 1B) when~30-40% of cells were infected as determined by immunostaining of core protein (S1A Fig). The miR-122 level decreased gradually during the course of HCV infection as early as day 1 post-infection (S1B Fig) . To identify the viral proteins involved in this regulation of miR-122 expression, we monitored miR-122 levels in Huh7-derived cell lines that individually express the HCV core protein, NS5B, and NS proteins (NS3 to NS5B from an HCV genotype 1b subgenomic replicon, which constitutively replicates in the R-1 cell line; Fig 1C, top) . We observed a significant decrease in the expression of the mature form of miR-122 when the HCV core protein was expressed (30 ± 11.5% decrease; Fig 1C and 1D ), whereas its levels were not influenced by NS proteins. Notably, the expression of miR-122 precursors (primary and precursor forms of miR-122) was not altered by the core protein (Fig 1E) , demonstrating that miR-122 transcription and biogenesis were not affected by core protein expression. In Huh7 cells transiently expressing the HCV core protein, decreased miR-122 levels were also observed, as assessed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (53 ± 1.6% of an empty vectortransfected control) and northern blot analysis (35% decrease compared with miR-122 levels in the 6-μg empty plasmid-transfected control) (Fig 1F) , whereas miR-221 levels were not altered upon core protein expression ( Fig 1G) . Transient expression of the core protein did not reduce cell viability ( Fig 1H) . Its expression level in Huh7 cells was in the range of 0.2-0.46 ng/ μg total protein. This level was comparable to that (0.3 ng/μg total protein) in Huh7 cells infected with HCV (MOI = 0.25) and that (0.17 ng//μg total protein) in the liver of HCVinfected SCID mouse with chimeric liver repopulated with human hepatocytes (S1C and S1D Fig show the percentage of core protein-positive cells in the chimeric liver and serum HCV RNA titer in the infected mouse, respectively). The downregulating effect of the HCV core protein was also observed both in R-1 cells ( Fig 1I) and in mouse primary hepatocytes (Fig 1J) , which express the same mature form miR-122 as in human hepatocytes.
