Engineering the BirA R118G biotin ligase into the MHV replicase transcriptase complex To insert the promiscuous biotin ligase BirA R118G as an integral subunit of the MHV RTC, we used a vaccinia virus-based reverse genetic system (Coley et al., 2005; Eriksson et al., 2008) to generate a recombinant MHV harboring an in-frame fusion of myc-tagged BirA R118G to nsp2. MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2 retained the cleavage site between nsp1 and BirA R118G , while a deleted cleavage site between BirA R118G and nsp2 ensured the expression of a BirA R118G -nsp2 fusion protein ( Figure 1a ). This strategy was chosen because it was recently employed by Freeman et al. for a fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) with nsp2 and represents the only known site tolerating large insertions within the MHV replicase polyprotein (Freeman et al., 2014) . MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2 replicated to comparable peak titers and replication kinetics as the parental wild-type MHV-A59 ( Figure 1b) . MHV-GFP-nsp2, which was constructed in parallel and contained the coding sequence of EGFP (Freeman et al., 2014) instead of BirA R118G , was used as a control and also reached wild-type virus peak titers, with slightly reduced viral titers at 9 hr post-infection (h.p.i.) compared to MHV-A59 and MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2 ( Figure 1b) . Western blot analysis confirmed that the BirA R118G -nsp2 fusion protein is specifically detected in MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2-infected cells and that the BirA R118G biotin ligase remains fused to nsp2 during MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2 infection (Figure 1-figure supplement 1) . To further confirm the accommodation of BirA R118G within the viral RTC, MHV-A59-, MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2-, and mock-infected L929 fibroblasts were visualized using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. BirA R118G -nsp2 remained strongly associated with the MHV RTC throughout the entire replication cycle, as indicated by the co-localization of BirA R118G -nsp2 with established markers of the MHV replicase, such as nsp2/3 and nsp8 ( Figure 1c , Figure 1 -figure supplement 2, Figure 1-figure supplement 3 ). This observation corroborates previous studies demonstrating that nsp2, although not required for viral RNA synthesis, co-localizes with other nsps of the coronaviral RTC (Schiller et al., 1998; Hagemeijer et al., 2010; Graham et al., 2005) . Importantly, by supplementing the culture medium with biotin, we could readily detect biotinylated proteins with fluorophore-coupled streptavidin that appeared close to the MHV RTC throughout the entire replication cycle in MHV-BirA R118G -nsp2-infected cells,
