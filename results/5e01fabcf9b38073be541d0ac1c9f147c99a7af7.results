As a first step towards computational construction of RPI networks, we focused on the following question: Given the sequence of an RNA-binding protein, can we predict whether it interacts with a given RNA sequence? In developing sequence-based methods to answer this question, we considered several reduced and alternative alphabet representations of the input protein and RNA sequences. Shen et al. [28] used a Conjoint Triad Feature (CTF) representation to successfully predict protein-protein interactions. The CTF representation essentially encodes each protein sequence using the normalized 3-gram frequency distribution extracted from a 7-letter reduced alphabet representation of the protein sequence (See Methods for details). A recent study [29] demonstrated the utility of the CTF representation for predicting whether a given protein is an RNA binding protein. Inspired by these studies, we chose to encode each protein sequence using the normalized k-gram frequency distributions extracted from the 7-letter reduced alphabet representation of the sequence. The choice of k = 3 yielded the best results. We also explored several alternative representations of RNA sequences and settled on encoding each RNA sequence using normalized 4-gram frequencies extracted directly from the 4-letter ribonucleotide alphabet representation of the RNA sequence. Our choice of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers was motivated by several studies that have successfully used them on classification tasks that are closely related to the RPI prediction [30] [31] [32] [33] . To rigorously evaluate the performance of these methods, we generated two non-redundant benchmark datasets, RPI2241 and RPI369, from PRIDB [34] , a comprehensive database of RNA-protein complexes extracted from the PDB [26] . Most of the RNA-protein pairs in RPI2241 correspond to RPIs involving rRNAs or ribosomal proteins; the rest correspond to RPIs involving other ncRNAs or mRNAs. RPI369 corresponds to RPIs extracted from nonribosomal complexes in RPI2241. "Negative" examples of non-interacting RNA-protein pairs were generated by randomly pairing proteins with RNAs and excluding the known interacting pairs (see Methods for details).
