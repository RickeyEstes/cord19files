In an early experiment, C6 cells inoculated with log dilutions of MVM(p) and held for 4 days were treated with ( In the next experiment, cells in cluster dishes and Lab Tek slides were inoculated in paralIe1 with MVM(p) dilutions and fixed for EIA and IFA, respectively, on day 2,4,5 or 6 (cluster dishes only on day 6). ID,, and fluorescent focus unit (FFU) titers were calculated for each day ( Table 2 ). The virus titer as determined by fluorescent focus test did not change with time, although the size of countable foci did increase. The titer calculated from the EIA increased significantly between day 2 and day 4, plateau&g on day 5 at the same level as the fluorescent focus titer. We next wished to determine whether MVM infectivity was being inactivated by the glutaraldehyde fixation, since processing of large numbers of plates in a biological safety cabinet was cumbersome. Cells were inoculated with 3,000 or 30,000 ID,, of either MVM(p) or MVMfi) and held for 4 days. Supernatant culture fluid was collected from wells prior to treatment with 0.02% glutaraldehyde and at 2, 6, and 24 h after fixation. Viral infectivity was measured by fluorescent focus assay. Infectivity of MVM(i) was reduced by about 70% at 24 h post-fixation. Infectivity of MVM(p) was unaltered by treatment with this concentration of glutaraldehyde, even at 24 h. Since viral inactivation was not achieved with 0.02% glutaraldehyde and since a higher concentration had resulted in unacceptable background signal, we studied the ability of neutral buffered formalin to inactivate virus in the supernates of wells inoculated with 30,000 ID,, of MVM(p). The experiment was performed only with MVM(p), since this strain had been more resistant to inactivation. Formalin at final To confirm that the reaction product detected in the EIA was specific for MVM antigen, a neutralization test using rabbit hyperimmune MVM antibody was performed (Table 3) . Using a challenge dose of 100 ID,, of MVM(p), a marginal mean O.D. value was obtained only at the highest antibody dilution tested (1: 10,000). With lo-fold more virus, there was a significant mean O.D. reading (0.97) for this antibody dilution, but the value was lower than the mean for wells inoculated with virus plus diluent (,1.51). Having confirmed the specificity of the EIA results, we wished to determine whether the assay could be applied to clinical material (infected animal tissue). Homogenates of ' Day post-inoculation of brain collections from neonatal mice infected intracerebrally. brains from neonatal mice inoculated intracerebrally with MVM(p~ or MVM(i) and collected on day 3,7 or 10 post-inoculation were assayed by fluorescent focus test and EIA (Table 4 ). Selected homogenates were assayed repeatedly by EIA to assess reproducibility. Virus titers determined from the two types of infectivity assays were generally similar. In some cases, fluorescent focus titers were about ten-foid higher than EIA titers. The greatest variability among independent assays was 1.0 log,, for a brain sample collected from MVM(p)-infected mice 7 days post-inoculation.
