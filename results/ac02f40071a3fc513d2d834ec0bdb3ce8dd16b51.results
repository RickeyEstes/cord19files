We now illustrate the numerical consequences of our findings based on realistic parameter values and model based formulae and simulations. Mostly, we have chosen parameter values compatible with the recent Ebola epidemic in West Africa as described in [3] . Details about theoretical derivations and about the simulation program and related results are reported in the electronic supplementary material.
