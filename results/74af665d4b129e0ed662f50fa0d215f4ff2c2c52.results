Baseline characteristics of participants and data source. We analyzed data for 58 infants with RSV infection, each of whom had both CD4 + gene expression and nasal microbiome data. The RSV disease severity was measured by the Global Respiratory Severity Score (GRSS). This allowed us to divide infants into two groups based on severity: mild and severe (see Methods section). We emphasize that GRSS is a composite score that reflects the worst values during the entire illness, rather than a single time point, allowing us to address the problem of clinical variability among subjects. GRSS also recapitulates more frequently used factors such as viral load (which has been associated with RSV disease severity in several studies 24, 25 ) and need for hospitalization (Supplemental Fig. 1 ), thus acting as excellent surrogate for disease severity 26 . Among the infants, 23 had mild illness and 35 had severe illness. There was no difference in any demographic characteristics between mildly and severely ill subjects ( Table 1) . The data collection occurred in three stages ( Fig. 2A) . transcriptome data analysis. We first characterized the gene expression data for these infants, as measured by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) of CD4 + T cells collected at two distinct time points, with 46 samples collected during the acute visit (Visit 1) and 34 samples collected at follow-up day 12-16 (Visit 2). Out of 22 subjects who had RNA-Seq samples collected at both the acute and follow-up visit, 7 were mild and 15 were severe (Fig. 2B) . We used principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate the data structure in light of various measured clinical variables (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). This analysis indicated that enrollment season was a significant contributor to structure in our expression data. Therefore, we applied batch-correction to remove this signal from the data. We then performed differential expression analysis, comparing the expression levels of genes between the acute and follow-up visit. We identified 27 genes that were differentially expressed at a Benjamini-Hotchberg false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 (Fig. 2C) . Many of the genes that had higher expression levels in the acute visit are known to be important in mediating host immune response. This included IFITM1 and IFITM2, which are known to inhibit the infection and replication of respiratory syncytial virus 27,28 , IFI27, a known biomarker for RSV 29 , and IRF7, a gene associated with suppression of innate immunity response 30 . Other genes with known associations to RSV and higher expression in the acute visit included SOCS3 31 , MX1 32 , and the ISGylation pathway genes USP18 and ISG15 33 . Our analysis also identified several genes with higher expression in the follow-up visit, including MS4A1, which encodes the CD20 protein, and MCOLN1. CD20 + B cells are prominent in the lung tissue of infants with fatal RSV infection 34, 35 and MS4A1 is upregulated in infants after the administration of live attenuated influenza vaccine, indicating an association with immune system processes 36 . RSV activates innate immunity through the toll like receptor (TLR) pathway. MCOLN1 has been associated with TLR signaling through modulating viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) along with trafficking of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) into lysosomes 37, 38 . MCOLN1 also regulates autophagy 39 , as expected in the convalescence phase of an infection. We also evaluated if any genes changed their expression levels in response to RSV infection severity. We found 600 genes differentially expressed at a nominal p-value significance of less than 0.05. Out of these, the most significantly differentially-expressed gene was EZH1 (p-value = 2.3 × 10 −6 ; FDR = 0.026) (Fig. 2D,E) . EZH1 was previously included in a biosignature proposed as a molecular diagnosis tool for RSV infection 40 . Interestingly, both EZH1 and IFITM have been implicated in immune response signaling indicating resolving infection 27 . Because we were only able to identify a handful of genes, primarily related to immune response, as significantly differentially-expressed in these same infants, we also investigated whether differences between severe and mild RSV infection could be captured using other methods. In particular, we examined whether gene expression differences between mild and severe RSV infection might be better captured through changes in variability rather than in mean expression levels. We evaluated the differential variability in gene expression levels between mild versus severe samples using the F-test and identified 641 (5.5%) genes that were differentially variable at an FDR significance threshold of 0.05. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis 41 identified a number of biological processes nominally associated with these genes (Supplemental Fig. 3 ). Many of these were associated with mitochondrial activity such as mitochondrial gene expression and translation. Mitochondria are important for viral suppression of the innate immunity 30 . www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Microbiome data analysis. We next characterized microbiome data from nasal swabs obtained by 16 S rRNA sequencing. This included data collected at two time points, with 51 samples collected during the acute visit (Visit 1) and 40 collected during a one-month follow-up visit (Visit 3); 23 of these samples were from infants with mild RSV infection and 35 were from infants with severe RSV infection (Fig. 2B) . We used both PCA and Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) with various dissimilarity metrics, including rooted-Jensen-Shannon divergence (rJSD) 42 as well as weighted and unweighted Unifrac distance 43 , to reduce dimensionality and visualize the microbiome data (Supplemental Fig. 4) 44 . We also applied MaAsLin (Multivariate association Analysis with Linear modeling) to test for significant relationships between microbial taxa and clinical outcome, after adjusting for sex, race, and enrollment season 45 . At a nominal p-value of 0.05, this analysis identified one operational taxonomic unit (OTU) -H. influenza -as positively associated with severity, and two OTUs -Ralstonia and Streptococcus -as negatively associated with severity. We also assessed the influence of visit and infection severity on the microbiome composition by using two measures to quantify the α-diversity: (1) observed number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), i.e., the OTU richness and (2) the Shannon index 46 . We found that both α-diversity measures have higher values for infants with severe infection compared to those with mild infection during the acute visit (Visit 1), as well as higher values in the acute as compared to the post-acute visit (Visit 3) for infants with severe infection (Fig. 2F ,G). In particular, the Shannon diversity is significantly different between severe versus mild samples in Visit 1 (p-value = 0.011), and between the Visit 1 and Visit 3 samples among infants with severe RSV infection (p-value = 0.0057). The infection score was estimated during Visit 1 (the acute phase). Severity of infection generally decreases over time, potentially explaining why we observe that the α-diversity decreases between the Visit 1 and Visit 3 samples. integrative analysis of transcriptome and microbiome data. Although it has been suggested that host gene expression is influenced by the microbiome, the biological mechanisms that may facilitate these types of interactions are largely unknown 47 . Integrative analysis of microbiome and transcriptome data could help us understand the relationships between host gene expression, microbial composition, and disease pathogenesis. Therefore, we applied a network-based approach, which systematically evaluates the interdependence of multiple biological entities instead of looking at each one independently, to identify microbiome-transcriptomic relationships important for RSV severity. We focused on the 40 infants from Visit 1 that had paired transcriptome and microbiome data (see Fig. 2B ) and performed dimension reduction on these data using PCA (Fig. 3A ). This analysis identified 13 gene principal components (gPCs) and 10 clade principal components (cPCs) that explained 95% of the variance in each of their respective data (Fig. 3B) . The loadings of each cPC and gPC represent a pattern of highly correlated microbial and transcriptional abundances, respectively (Fig. 3C ). In order to relate these patterns and identify associations between highly varying genes and clades, we calculated the Spearman correlation between the loadings of the top gPCs and cPCs (Fig. 3D ). We find several gPC-cPC pairs that are highly correlated, such as gPC5 and cPC4 (most positively correlated; ρ = 0.48), and gPC4 and cPC7 (most negatively correlated; ρ = −0.43). Interestingly, these relationships are not limited to the top few PCs, which are normally the primary focus of dimension reduction analysis. Instead, these relationships highlight that prominent patterns in microbiome data may be associated with more subtle patterns in gene expression, and vice versa. integration of microbiome/transcriptome relationships with clinical characteristics. To interpret these results, we considered this correlation matrix as edges in a bipartite graph, where nodes are gPCs and cPCs. This network framework can help us identify important transcriptomic-microbiomic (gPC-cPC) relationships. However, since this network was derived using information from all samples, by itself it is unable to shed light on which of these relationships might be associated with differences in the various phenotypic or clinical properties of the input samples, including disease severity. To overcome this limitation, we applied LIONESS 48, 49 , which employs a jackknife approach to reverse engineer a set of sample-specific networks, to our gPC/cPC correlation network. This allowed us to construct separate correlation networks between gPCs and cPCs for each of the infants and to analyze gPC-cPC relationships in light of clinical information for these infants. The weights of edges across these networks are shown in Fig. 4A . We compared the distribution of the sample-specific edge-weights between the mild and severe groups and identified six edges which were nominally www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ significant with a p-value less than 0.05: gPC1 with cPC2, gPC8 with cPC8 and cPC4, gPC3 with cPC10, gPC13 with cPC9, and gPC12 with cPC1 (Fig. 4B) . To assess the robustness of this result, we performed a sensitivity analysis by randomly selecting 10 samples each from mild and severe groups and repeating this analysis 1000 times. This analysis allows us to assess the robustness of our results given our relatively low sample number as well as the disparity between the number of mild and severe samples. If an edge is robustly different between the severe and mild groups, we will recover that association repeatedly across the randomizations. We found that the top edges obtained above were frequently (at least 20% of the time compared to 5% expected by chance) identified as significant with the same direction of effect (Supplemental Fig. 5 ). Microbiome/transcriptome relationships identify clades that may impact the host immune response. Six clade principal components, cPC2, cPC8, cPC10, cPC9, cPC1, and cPC4 (ordered by significance) were identified as differentially-associated with gPCs in the context of RSV severity based on our network analysis. To understand why these cPCs might have a different relationship with the host transcriptome in the context of RSV severity, we identified their associated top OTUs (Table 2) . We find that genus like Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, Alloiococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus are among the top OTUs in cPC2, Ralstonia, Corynebacterium, Neisseriaceae (family, genus not known), and Pseudomonas are among the top OTUs in cPC8, and Corynebacterium, Ralstonia, Alloiococcus, and Staphylococcus are among the top OTUs in cPC10. Some of these same OTUs were also identified as OTUs that discriminate between severe and mild RSV infection in our MaAsLin analysis. The gene principal components that were identified as differentially-associated with cPCs in the context of RSV severity included gPC1, gPC8, gPC3, gPC13, and gPC12. We identified the top genes from these gPCs based on their loadings (Table 3) . Interestingly, we found that 10 of top 20 genes in gPC1 are mitochondrial genes. We also found IFITM1 or IFITM2 in the top loadings of gPC3. These two genes are also significantly differentially-expressed between the acute and post-acute visit, but not between infants with severe versus mild RSV infection (see Fig. 2C ). CCR7 (Chemokine receptor type 7), a top gene in gPC1, gPC8, and gPC3, and ILR7 (interleukin 7 receptor) from gPC8 and gPC12 have been found to be downregulated in RSV patients 50 . Other genes present in the loadings of multiple gene PCs included L-ribosomal proteins (RPL family), which are involved in various pathophysiological process, and SELL (L-Selectin), a cell surface lectin mostly expressed in leukocytes, which is down-regulated in RSV infection. SELL also plays a key role in the recruitment of neutrophils to roll along the endothelium to the infected tissue 51, 52 . We performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the top 100 genes associated with each of these gPCs. For gPC1, top significant terms included "immune system process", "immune response", "viral process", Continued "T cell activation", and "leukocyte activation". Terms associated with gPC8 included "viral gene expression", "viral transcription", and "multi-organism process". Terms associated with gPC3 were associated with signaling pathways like "cytokine-mediated signaling", "type I interferon", "innate immune response", "defense response", "response to other organism", "viral genome replication", "defense response", and "regulation of viral genome replication" (Fig. 5) . Similar functions were identified for gPC12 and gPC13 (Supplemental Fig. 6 ). All of these GO terms are consistent with viral infection and immune response in infected infants. The association of these viral and immune processes with the taxa identified in the associated cPCs allows us to hypothesize that certain microbial species may modulate the immune response in the host CD4 + T cells.
