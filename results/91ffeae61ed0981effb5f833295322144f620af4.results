The intermediate plus strain of IBDV vaccine was prepared by propagating the virus in CEF cell culture. The TCID 50 of the virus was found to be 10 3.5 /0.1 ml and the CLD 50 of the virulent IBDV determined in 3-week-old chick-ens was 10 3 /0.1 ml. All the experimental birds used in the present studies were tested and found negative for the maternal antibodies at 3 weeks of age. In the control groups, all the pre challenge serum samples were negative for precipitin antibodies.
