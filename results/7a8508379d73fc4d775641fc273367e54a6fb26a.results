The clinical course of the disease followed the pattern typical for this model of EAE in the rat (Sedgwick et al., 1987) , namely flaccid tail at 3-4 days, hind limb weakness at 4 days, hind limb paralysis by 5 days, restoration of hind limb function by 7 days, and full clinical recovery by 10 days post-injection of cells. The pathological changes which accompanied these signs were leukocyte infiltration and edema of the white and gray matter of the spinal cord, leptomeninges and the spinal roots. These changes reached their max- Oligodendrocyte loops can be seen at the point indicated by the arrow, x 12000. ,.2, imal severity at 5 days post-injection. In clinically recovered animals there was little cellular infiltration of the spinal cord or meninges to be found by 7 days post-injection and by 10 days the spinal cord appeared normal except for sporadic lymphocytes and a generalized hypertrophy of astrocytes. The only evidence of central demyelination found in these animals was an occasional demyelinated axon in the white matter beneath the pial surface. In addition to cellular infiltration and edema of the spinal nerve roots there was also some demyelination of axons in these regions. A feature of all animals killed while they were showing clinical signs was the presence of pyknotic cells within the spinal cord. Many of these cells seen in plastic sections to be next to myelin sheaths ( Fig. 1) were found by electron microscopy to be surrounded by a small number of myelin lamellae (Fig. 2) . In the animals killed between 3 and 5 days post-injection, lymphocytes were seen in similar locations to the pyknotic cells (Fig. 3) . The cytoplasm of many of these lymphocytes contained electron-dense granular bodies. In animals killed at the time of maximal cell infiltration and edema (4-5 days) the following changes were also seen: lymphocytes processes directed towards single or multiple myelin sheaths, outer oligodendrocyte tongues separated from their myelin sheath by lymphocyte cytoplasm (Fig. 4) , lymphocytes incompletely surrounded by a single myelin lamella, lymphocytes completely surrounded by a single myelin lamella and lymphocytes surrounded by several myelin lamellae (Fig.  3) . The lymphocyte-myelin sheath interactions were also seen in the spinal cords of irradiated animals which received injections of MBP-stimulated lymphocytes. In these animals, the total number of leukocytes in the spinal cord was greatly reduced compared to non-irradiated recipient animals although there appeared to be comparable numbers of lymphocytes associated with myelin sheaths. This is consistent with earlier observations (Sedgwick et al., 1987) that provided evidence that the relatively few cells present in the CNS of irradiated recipient animals were MBPspecific effector cells and suggests, furthermore, that in non-irradiated animals also, it is the MBPspecific effector cells, rather than non-specifically recruited cells, that are in association with myelin sheaths. It is noteworthy that the intramyelinic Fig. 4 .
