Eleven bicolored white-toothed shrews were caught (4 females [#2, #3, #6, #8], 7 males [#1, #5,  #7, #9, #10, #12, #13] ). An overview about the different shrews is given in S1 Table. As animals were integrated into husbandry at different time points, the observation period varied between the animals. In totally six out of eleven shrews (female #2, male #5, female #6, male #9, male #10, male #12) natural BoDV-1-infection was confirmed by detection of viral RNA, in three out of eleven shrews (female #2, male #5, female #6) additionally by detection of infectious virus. Two of the naturally infected shrews (male #5, female #6) died about 9 weeks after the start of the observation period (see below). The five other shrews did not exhibit any evidence for BoDV-1-infection, neither infectious virus nor viral RNA was detected at any time point investigated. During the whole observation period up to 600 days, activity and behaviour during day or night light regime and food intake did not differ between infected and noninfected animals. Furthermore, there was no significant difference of relative body mass trend between infected and non-infected individuals (Mann-Whitney U-test, p > 0.06 for each comparison) (Fig 1) . There was also no significant difference of relative body mass trend between different weeks in husbandry of non-infected animals (Kruskal-Wallis-Test: H(10;42) = 4.3123; p = 0.9322) and between different weeks in husbandry of infected animals (Kruskal-Wallis-Test: H(10;50) = 6,8237; p = 0.7420). Body mass of the individual shrews are shown in S1 Fig. Six shrews (#2, #7, #9 , #10, #12, #13), both infected and non-infected ones, developed focal alopecia after 4 to 5 months. Two animals of group 1 (#5, #6) were found dead without previous symptoms shortly after the initial health monitoring. Post mortem examination revealed intestinal invagination as cause of death in one case and hepatitis and pneumonia without known etiology in the other case. Infected animals caught in 2013 received an intensive initial health monitoring including shedding of the virus for 4 weeks. In these three naturally infected shrews (#2, #5, #6), viral RNA was present in saliva, lacrimal fluid, skin swabs, urine and faeces as well as in the ground substrate from their lairs (Table 1) . During the observation period viral RNA was consistently present in swabs from saliva and skin, however detection varied in urine, lacrimal fluid and was solely sporadically possible in faeces. Ct-values were lowest in samples of saliva. For the investigation of long lasting virus shedding BoDV-1 infected animals were sampled again after at least more than 250 days in the husbandry. In these four naturally infected shrews(#2, #9, #10, #12), viral RNA was present in swabs from saliva, lacrimal fluid, skin and urine, but was not detectable in faeces (Table 2) . Ct-values varied between different animals and between the samples but were lowest in saliva in two animals. Furthermore, infectious virus was successfully isolated on REB cells from all of the BoDV-1-positive shrews caught in 2013 (#2, #5, #6) in samples from saliva (#2, #6), skin/sebum (#2, #6) and urine (#5, #6) (Fig 2) . Viral RNA of isolates from saliva of #2 and saliva of #6 was sequenced (Genbank accession no. KM349818, KM 349819). In a 2150 nucleotide stretch (nt 17 to 2161 covering the N, X, P, half of M-protein-encoding regions) sequences of both isolates revealed a homology of 99% compared to a recent BoDV-1-sequence (GenBank accession no. KF275185) obtained from a shrew of the same endemic area and to an equine BoDV-1-sequence from a horse housed in the same region (GenBank accession no. KF275184) [17] . Both isolates are part of the regional BoDV-1 subcluster 1a. (Fig 3) The results obtained from the living shrews were compared to the organ distribution of viral antigen and BoDV-1-RNA in three naturally BoDV-1-infected C. leucodon from pest control (#2001 and #5017, [17] and another animal #5072 from the same stable as #5017) and in the two deceased shrews. Detailed information about organ distribution is given in S3 Fig. In all of these animals, mRNA, genomic RNA and/or viral antigen were detected in the nervous system and widespread in peripheral organs (e.g. epithelial cells of the parotid gland, lacrimal gland, sebaceous glands, bronchi, kidney tubules, esophagus and epidermal keratocytes) [17] (Fig 4) . Interestingly, viral antigen was also present in the uterus in one shrew. Thus, detection of viral RNA and infectious virus from secretions and excretions in the living shrews (saliva, lacrimal fluid, skin swabs, urine and faeces) fits well with the morphological demonstration of viral antigen and RNA in the respective organ systems and further confirms successful viral replication in peripheral organs. Beside virus shedding via secretions and excretions shedding of BoDV-1 seems also to be possible via scaling of epidermal epithelial cells.
