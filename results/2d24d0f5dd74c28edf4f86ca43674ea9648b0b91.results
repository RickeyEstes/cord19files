The present study addresses the influence of different formulation and processing parameters on the characteristics of spray-dried nanocomposite microparticles. The results were evaluated to determine the optimal formulation for spray drying of PLGA NP-based nanocomposite particles. Further, siRNA-containing PLGA NPs were spray dried using the optimal formulation, and the siRNA extracted from the NPs was evaluated with respect to content, integrity and biological activity.
