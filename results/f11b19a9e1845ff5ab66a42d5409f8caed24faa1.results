Sample collection and sequencing of a cDNA library produced from female Syrian hamster organs The brains, lungs, spleens, kidneys, livers, and hearts were collected from three adult female Syrian hamsters. Total RNAs were isolated, pooled, and contaminating genomic DNA removed. Following adaptor ligation, cDNAs were 39 fragment-sequenced on a Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium instrument. The sequencing generated 1,283,840 reads with an average length of 344 bases. Reads were trimmed for quality and reads shorter than 40 bases were discarded, resulting in 1,212,395 sequence reads available for further assembly and analysis. Figure 1A shows the length distribution of reads before assembly. Consistent with most of the publicly available transcriptome libraries [29] , we observed that our reads ranged between 200 and 600 nucleotides in length.
