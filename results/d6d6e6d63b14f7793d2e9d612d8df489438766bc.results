Thirty-three of 38 persons (87%) occupying 39 of 44 (89%) leadership positions in the activated version of HEICS at NCKUH directly participated in the survey, including the four persons occupying the four leadership positions newly created during the outbreak (Tables  2-5 ). One individual was represented in the survey by a proxy that he appointed, whereas four others, who declined or were unable to participate, were represented by their superiors in the HEICS structure (Tables 2, 3 , and 5). Figure 1 shows the actual activation of HEICS during the SARS outbreak at NCKUH. Four HEICS positions (and corresponding units) and six subunits were created during the SARS outbreak. Six HEICS units not activated during the SARS outbreak included the damage assessment and control, time, delayed treatment, minor treatment, discharge, and dependent care units. The structure and function of newly created HEICS units and subunits (and the modified Triage unit) are summarized in Table 6 . Table 2 shows each activated leadership position in the HEICS administrative section at NCKUH, the job title of each position holder, and new job actions during the event that were not anticipated in the baseline hospital emergency plan. Tables 3-5 show similar information for the HEICS operations, logistics, planning, and finance sections.
