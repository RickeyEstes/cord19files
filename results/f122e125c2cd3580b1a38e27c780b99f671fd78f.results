We performed our analysis in two phases that we then jointly analyzed to improve power for locus discovery. 21 In Phase 1, we genotyped 137 JIA-associated uveitis cases, 247 nonuveitis JIA samples, and 398 population-level controls without JIA or uveitis, all collected from within the Netherlands. Samples were genotyped on the HumanOmniExpress24 array, containing ~700,000 markers. Samples and SNPs underwent quality control (QC) (Materials and Methods) to remove those samples and SNPs with low-quality genotyping data. After QC, 126 JIA-associated uveitis cases, 231 non-uveitis JIA samples, and 394 population-level controls remained ( Table 1) . We prephased the genotyping data using SHAPEIT2 [22] [23] [24] and imputed the phased haplotypes with IMPUTE2, 25-27 using a reference panel constructed from the 2,504 global samples included in the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3. 28 In parallel to genome-wide imputation, we extracted the MHC from the genotype data and imputed additional SNPs, amino acids and HLA types using the SNP2HLA pipeline 29 (Materials and Methods). In Phase 2, an additional 77 JIA-associated uveitis cases and 115 JIA without uveitis samples (total N = 192), collected from Germany, Belgium and Switzerland, were genotyped on the same array. Samples and SNPs underwent QC nearly identical to that of Phase 1 (Materials and Methods). After QC, 66 JIA-associated uveitis cases and 99 nonuveitis JIA samples remained for analysis. The cleaned genotyping data was prephased and imputed both genome-wide and within the MHC, precisely as in Phase 1.
