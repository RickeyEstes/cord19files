A total of 72 consecutive patients were recruited between March 2013 and December 2014. Five patients were excluded: one because of a known infection unrelated to the respiratory tract at inclusion, one as a result of active fungal infection, one because the LDCT was acquired more than 24 hours after the CXR, one was not able to undergo LDCT scanning and for one patient CXR was not available (Fig 1) . Baseline characteristics of the 67 patients are listed in Table 2 . According to the consensus diagnosis 11 patients (16.4%) had a pulmonary infection, of which 5 had IFD (2 possible, 3 probable), 1 had rhinovirus and 5 pneumonia of unknown aetiology. Five of the patients with pneumonia underwent bronchoscopy due to persistent fever and abnormalities on HRCT. In 3 of those patients a probable pathogen was identified after evaluation of BAL-fluid, which was probable IFD in all 3. Furthermore in 35 (55.2%) patients, overall nonspecific mucositis was the most likely cause of fever. In four of these patients abdominal imaging (CT) was performed showing no signs of typhlitis. In 15 patients (22.4%) a focus of infection was not found. The other consensus diagnosis results are listed in Table 3 .
