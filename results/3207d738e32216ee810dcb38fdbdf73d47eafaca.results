Electrophysiological testing. The functional recovery of the sciatic nerves was determined by the action potential amplitude and MNCV (Table I) . The amplitude and MNCV of the high-and mid-dose groups at one, two, four and eight weeks after injury were significantly higher than for the low-dose and control groups (P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the high-and mid-dose groups or between the low-dose and control groups. Administration of glycyrrhizin at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day accelerated the functional recovery of the injured sciatic nerves in the mice. Western blotting and qPCR analysis. The western blotting analysis of the results is shown in Fig. 2 , and the blot grayscale ratio in Table II . Levels of p75NTR protein in each group increased markedly between one and two weeks after injury, and then decreased markedly between two and eight weeks. At each time-point, each glycyrrhizin treatment group had significantly reduced p75NTR protein expression versus the control group (P<0.05 for each). Meanwhile, the high-and mid-dose groups at one and four weeks showed lower levels of p75NTR protein versus the low-dose groups (P<0.05 for each), and the high-dose group expressed significantly reduced levels versus the low-dose group at two weeks (P<0.05). The qPCR analysis of the results is shown in Fig. 2 . Overall, the levels of p75NTR mRNA in each group increased following injury and then decreased. The levels of p75NTR mRNA in the low-dose and control groups increased between one and four weeks and then decreased between four and eight weeks. While a decrease in p75NTR mRNA expression in the high-and mid-dose groups occurred early between two and eight weeks, p75NTR mRNA expression in the high-and mid-dose groups was significantly lower versus the control (P<0.05) at each time-point. Application of glycyrrhizin, particularly using doses of 20 and 10 mg/ kg/day, markedly inhibited the expression of p75NTR at the protein and mRNA levels. Table I . Neuroelectrophysiological potential amplitude (mV) and MNCV (m/sec) of each dose group at each time-point following injury (n=10). Histological staining. Nerve fibers and myelin were dually stained using combined Marsland's and LFB staining methods to detect nerve regeneration and myelinization at eight weeks after injury. Nerve fibers were stained black and myelin was stained blue (Fig. 3A) . Myelin sheaths in the high- (Fig. 3Aa) and mid-dose groups (Fig. 3Ab) were regularly shaped, having uniform thickness and possessing clear borders or little fibrous hyperplasia. Myelin sheaths in the low-dose group were of irregular shape and thickness, and possessed clear borders and visible fibrous hyperplasia (Fig. 3Ac) . Myelin sheaths in the control group were extremely irregularly shaped with marked fibrous hyperplasia (Fig. 3Ad) . Based on these dual stained images, the number of myelinated fibers in five random microscopic fields and their average diameters were analyzed using image analysis software Image-Pro Â® Plus 6.0 (Table III) . The number and diameter of myelinated fibers in the high-and mid-dose groups at each time-point were significantly higher than in the low-dose and control groups, respectively (P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the high-and mid-dose groups or between the low-dose and control groups. Using 10 and 20 mg/kg doses of glycyrrhizin per day accelerated nerve regeneration.
