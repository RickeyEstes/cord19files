IFN-␣/␤R ؊/؊ R ؊/؊ mice are hypersusceptible to YFV-17D infection. We infected WT, ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ , R Ϫ/Ϫ , and ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice with YFV-17D (10 6 PFU) and monitored the survival rates of the mice over a 15-day course of infection. ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice exhibited increased susceptibility to viral infection (30% mortality rate) in comparison to all the other mouse strains tested (Fig. 1A) . Escalating the dose of YFV-17D (10 7 PFU) increased the mortality rate of ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice (survival rate at 9 days postinfection, 40%), but more than 90% of the ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ and R Ϫ/Ϫ survived the viral infection (Fig. 1B) . Infected with 10 7 PFU YFV-17D, both ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ and ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice displayed clinical manifestations of disease, as well as significant weight loss and temperature drop, between days 5 and 10 postinfection, although the WT mice and R Ϫ/Ϫ mice did not exhibit any clinical signs of disease ( Fig. 1C and D; see also Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ mice progressed to clinically apparent disease that reached a peak around day 7 postinfection but recovered over time. ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice exhibited similar initial signs of morbidity, but the symptoms worsened and the animals became moribund or died (Fig. 1C) . Hence, although ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ mice and ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice seemed to be similarly susceptible to YFV-17D at early time points postinfection, most of the ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice, in contrast to the ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ mice, were not able to recover from infection. Taken together, our data suggest that IFN-likely plays a role in preventing the worsening of YFV-17D-induced disease at later stages of infection. Type III IFN-mediated signaling prevents spread of YFV-17D to the central nervous system (CNS). Next, we aimed to identify the virologic event(s) specific to ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice and not to ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ or ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ mice. We quantified viral RNA in the serum of WT, ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ , R Ϫ/Ϫ , and ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice at days 0, 1, 3, and 5 postinfection. As expected, the WT and R Ϫ/Ϫ mice exhibited low levels of viremia through-out this period, likely resulting in complete viral clearance ( Fig. 2A) . In contrast, ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ and ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice were highly viremic during the first 5 days postinfection ( Fig. 2A) , demonstrating the critical role of type I IFN in controlling early viral replication and consistent with previous findings (7, 12, 13) . IFN-did not appear to have any impact on peripheral viral replication even when type I IFN signaling was abrogated. Consequently, we quantified the YFV-17D viral load in more localized tissue compartments of these mouse strains. Evidence of viral replication was found in all tested tissues (spleen, thymus, liver, kidney, and brain) across all cohorts ( Fig. 2B to F). While viral RNA levels decreased to below the limit of detection around day 5 postinfection in the sera of WT and R Ϫ/Ϫ mice, YFV-17D persisted longer (up to 5 days) in other tissues, as previously reported in YFV-17D-infected WT mice (23) . This longer persistence likely preceded viral clearance, as these mice survived up to 15 days postinfection and no significant increase in viral RNA was observed in the tested tissues between days 3 and 5 postinfection. In the spleen and thymus ( Fig. 2B and C), two lymphoid tissues, viral replication was similarly enhanced in the ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ and ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice in comparison to the WT and R Ϫ/Ϫ mice. This trend was also observed in the kidney and liver ( Fig. 2D and E) , two visceral tissues where YFV can replicate. The viral load remained stable or decreased in the spleen, liver, and kidney of ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ and ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice between days 3 and 5 postinfection, suggesting that the immune response might control viral replication in these tissues. Rare cases of neurologic adverse effects have been observed in YFV-17D-infected rhesus macaques, human vaccinees (2, (24) (25) (26) , and ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ mice (7) . We found that the viral load in the brains of ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ mice and ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice was more elevated than in those of WT and R Ϫ/Ϫ mice at day 5 postinfection (Fig. 2F) . However, the viral load in the brains of ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ R Ϫ/Ϫ mice was significantly higher than in those of ␣␤R Ϫ/Ϫ mice at day 5 postinfection, suggesting a more
