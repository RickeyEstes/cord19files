With 14/25 of cloacal swab samples and rest of Nasal Swabs or oropharynx swab samples testing, these patients presented the repeated positive COVID-19 mRNA within 3 (2-7) days after the hospital. Notably, the median time from their last negative result to turning positive was 6 (4-10) days. These patients were then hospitalized again and continued the quarantine protocol. All these patients were asymptomatic and chest CT scanning indicated that 12 of them even showed improvement while rest of them represented with no obvious change compared with previous images. With a few days of prophylactic intervention with Chinese herbal medicine, the RT-PCR results of virus mRNA detection were all turning to negative in both nasopharyngeal swab and cloacal swab samples. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant inverse correlation existed between serum D-Dimer level and the duration of antiviral treatment (r=-0.637, p=0.002), while lymphocyte concentration significantly positively correlated (r=0.52, p=0.008) with the duration of virus reversal. These implied that the imperfect antivirus therapy probably was responsible for the recurrence of COVID-19 virus.
