A total of 6266 children were included in the randomized trial (total cohort); of this total, 3717 ILI episodes that occurred in 2421 children were included in the present analysis (total cohort with ILI episodes tested by multiplex PCR; Figure 1 ). Demographics were similar in both cohorts, except that children in the total cohort were older (mean age 58 months vs 47 months; Table 1 ). A total of 399 children experienced ILI but did not have an adequate sample for laboratory testing ( Figure 1 ); demographics in this group were also similar to those of the evaluated cohort, except that children were older (mean age 55 months; Supplementary Table 1) . Prevalence of RSV Among ILI Episodes and Incidence of RSV-Associated ILI RSV (subtype A or B) was detected for 359 ILI episodes, an overall prevalence of 9.7% (95% CI, 8.7-10.7; Table 2 ). Of these, 235 episodes (6.3%) were associated with an infection of RSV only and 124 (3.3%) with RSV plus coinfection with another respiratory virus(es), most commonly rhinovirus/ enterovirus (Supplementary Table 2 ). The prevalence of RSV in ILI ranged from 4.2% in Costa Rica to 16.0% in the Philippines and 16.2% in Australia (Table 2; Figure 2 ). Overall, the prevalence of RSV in ILI declined with age (Table 2; Figure 2 ). However, the Philippines was the only country in which prevalence was highest in the 6-through 11-month age group (37.1%). In other countries, the highest prevalence was in the 12-through 23-or the 24-through 35-month age groups. No children aged 6-11 months in Australia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Singapore, or Thailand experienced an ILI episode associated with RSV infection; the prevalence in Brazil and Mexico was 6.7% and 6.3%, respectively. The overall prevalence of RSV subtype A among ILI episodes was 3.0% and varied by country and age (Supplementary Table 3 ). Across all age groups, it was highest in Australia (7.2%) and lowest in Costa Rica (0.3%); across all countries, it was highest in the 36-through 59-month age group (4.5%) and lowest in the 6through 11-month age group (1.4%). The overall prevalence of RSV subtype B among ILI episodes was 6.5% and was also variable by country and age (Supplementary Table 4 ). Across all age groups, it was highest in the Philippines (15.2%) and lowest in Mexico (0.9%); across all countries, it was highest in the 6through 11-month age group (16.8%) and lowest in the >60month age group (1.7%). The overall incidence of RSV-associated ILI in the study population was 7.0 (95% CI, 6.3-7.7) per 100 PY. The highest incidence occurred in children aged 12-23 and 24-35 months in all countries except the Philippines, where the incidence was highest in the youngest age group, and in Mexico, where it was similar in children aged 6-11, 12-23, and 24-35 months ( Table 3) . The Philippines had the highest incidence of RSVassociated ILI (81.1 per 100 PY), followed by Brazil, Singapore, and Australia (21-28 per 100 PY); lower incidences were recorded for Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Thailand (13-15 per 100 PY). The occurrence of RSV at different times of the year was highly variable across countries ( Figure 3 ).
