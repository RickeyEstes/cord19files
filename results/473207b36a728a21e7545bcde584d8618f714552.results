The Richards model provides a good fit to the daily South Korea MERS-CoV case data by onset date from May 11 to June 14 (see Fig. 1 ), a total of 166 reported cases. The estimated parameters values of the model fit with 95% confidence intervals (CI) are given in Table 1 . The parameter estimates and the 95% CIs were obtained using the NLIN subroutine in SAS, a nonlinear least-squared approximation routine. The resulting 95% CI is a measure of uncertainty for the parameter estimation but not for the errors in model fit, which conceivably could be much larger. The estimated outbreak turning point of t i = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6-24.0]), or 23-24 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints to June 3-4 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. For computation of the basic reproduction number R 0 , we make use of the point estimate and 95% CI of the serial interval for South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak, T = 12.6 days (95% CI [12.1-13.1]), reported by Cowling et al. (2015) . Subsequently,we estimate R 0 to be ranging between 7.0 and 19.3.
