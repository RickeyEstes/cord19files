Tables I and II summarize the clinical characteristics of the patients from whom the samples were collected. iTRAQ identified 16 different proteins that had ≥1.5-fold differences in expression level between the patients with HBV-induced ACLF and CHB, respectively, and the healthy controls (Table III) . Protein quantification software, based on the relative content of the isotopic reporter group and using m/z 114 as a reference, showed significant results (P≤0.05). Some identified protein was lost in the corresponding reporter group, giving no quantification information. The specific information and re-identification will be published in a future study. The 16 proteins that were identified using iTRAQ were classified into six categories, based on protein function (Fig. 1) . The five proteins that demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression and the most significant correlation with liver diseases were verified using western blotting: CRP precursor, hemoglobin β chain variant Hb S-Wake, apolipoprotein J precursor, platelet factor 4 precursor and VN ( Fig. 2 and Table IV) . Two of the five proteins were not classified according to biological processes (apolipoprotein J precursor and platelet factor 4 precursor).
