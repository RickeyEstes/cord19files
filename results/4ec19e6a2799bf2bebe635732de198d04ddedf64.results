Specific 29-O-methylation of GpppA-capped RNA by SARS-CoV nsp14/nsp16/nsp10 complex In our previous work, we adopted a genetic screening system and biochemical assays to identify SARS-CoV nsp14 as N7-MTase [8] . However, we did not observe any 29-O-MTase activity in various biochemical assays for SARS-CoV nsp16, which was previously predicted to be 29-O-MTase [1, 29] , although a low 29-O-MTase activity was demonstrated for feline coronavirus nsp16 [26] . We and others showed previously that SARS-CoV nsp10 could interact with both nsp14 and nsp16 [30, 31] , suggesting a role for nsp10 in the functions of nsp14 and nsp16. Therefore, we undertook to test the effects of nsp10 on the MTase activities of both nsp14 and nsp16. As shown in Figure 1A , by using radiolabeled and unmethylated G*pppA-capped RNA as substrate (where the * indicates that the following phosphate was 32 P labeled, and the sequence is identical with viral genomic RNA except for the second nucleotide), nsp14 alone could efficiently N7-methylate GpppA-RNA to generate cap-0 structure (m7GpppA) ( Figure 1A , lane 2) and nsp10 did not significantly alter nsp14 N7-MTase activity in our testing system ( Figure 1A , lane 4). While either nsp16 or nsp10 alone did not show any MTase activity ( Figure 1A , lanes 3 and 1), the mixture of nsp10/nsp14/nsp16 gave rise to cap-1 structure (m7GpppAm) ( Figure 1A, lane 7) , indicating that addition of nsp10 and nsp16 rendered the complex active in the 29-O-MTase reaction. We then used radiolabeled m7G*pppA-capped RNA substrate and demonstrated that nsp14 could not 29-O-methylate RNA cap-0 structure ( Figure 1A , lane 12) but the mixture of nsp16 and nsp10 (nsp16/ nsp10) did possess the 29-O-MTase activity to convert cap-0 to cap-1 structure at pH 7.5 and 8.0 ( Figure 1A , lanes 10 and 16). These results indicate that nsp10 may function as a stimulatory factor for nsp16 and is required for the 29-O-MTase activity of nsp16. While this work was ongoing, similar observations were made by Bouvet et al. [25] . Our previous studies showed that SARS-CoV nsp14 N7-MTase could N7-methylate both GpppA-and GpppG-capped RNA in a sequence-independent manner [8] . As both the genomic and subgenomic RNAs of SARS-CoV all start with an adenine, we tested whether SARS-CoV nsp16 29-O-MTase has sequence specificity by using m7GpppA-and m7GpppG-capped RNAs as substrates. As shown in Figures 1B and 1C , SARS-CoV nsp16/ nsp10 complex gave a strong methylation signal on m7GpppAcapped RNA substrate but not on m7GpppG-capped RNA, suggesting that SARS-CoV nsp16/nsp10 functions in cap sequence-specific manner. The VP39 29-O-MTase of vaccinia virus was used as a control in the methylation assay system ( Figure 1C ). Furthermore, we observed that nsp16/nsp10 could not methylate cap analogues and individual NTPs ( Figure 1B) , indicating that the RNA substrate for nsp16/nsp10 needs to contain a stretch of nucleotides linked to the cap.
