To detect FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV in a differential manner, primers targeting the highly conserved region in the M gene were sought. Because of the high sequence diversity among FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV, no consistent difference of more than three continuous nucleotides in the alignments of CCoV and TGEV with FCoV sequences were noted (Fig. 2) . Therefore, a primer pair (S1 and S2) specific for common sequences in all the viruses, CCoV-specific primer (S3), and TGEV-specific primer (S4) were selected for the multiplex RT-PCR (Fig. 2) . S1 and S4 were used as the forward primers, whereas S2 and S3 were used as the reverse primers. The values of G of each primer or among all primer pairs ranged from âˆ’5.40 to 1.20 kcal/mol. In addition, the nucleotide at the 3terminal immediate to the last unique nucleotides in S3 and S4 was substituted with an inosine. The multiplex RT-PCR with S1, S2, S3, and S4 primers permitted successful detection and differentiation of each virus (Fig. 3) . PCR products from each of the three viruses showed a common band amplified by S1 and S2 (380 bp) as a control. CCoV revealed its genome-specific band amplified by S1 and S3 (209 bp) in addition to the common band. TGEV revealed four different-sized bands: the common band (380 bp), a band amplified by S3 and S4 (452 bp), a band amplified by S2 and S4 (623 bp), and a band amplified by S1 and S3 (209 bp). Sequencing analyses demonstrated that each of the amplifications were specific for the intended target sequence. In addition, none of the RT-PCR assays recognized any other pathogens in the repeated experiments. The analytic sensitivity of singleplex assay and multiplex assay was estimated by using serially diluted recombinant vectors with known copy numbers (molecules/L). The estimated detection limit of the multiplex PCR was 780, 2800, and 550 copies for FCoV, CCoV, and TGEV, respectively (Table 2) . For the materials with the same concentrations of the intended targets, the multiplex assays for CCoV and TGEV yielded positive results with 10-fold lower concentration of each virus compared to that used in the singleplex assay. The assay for FCoV yielded the same detection limit between the singleplex and multiplex formats. Standard curves generated by the multiplex test using 10-fold serial dilutions of each recombinant vector showed correlation coefficients (R 2 ) of 0.950-0.968 Table 2 Detection limits of the singleplex and multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays.
