The structure of the -1 translational frameshifting motif of PaYIP3 As seen in Figure 1A , the mRNA of the P. anserina PaYIP3 gene (CDS number Pa_1_8470) overlaps two open reading frames (ORFs). The small one located at the 59 end of the messenger is similar to the S. cerevisiae YIP3 gene (YNL044W), while the larger one at the 39 end is not present in this yeast (Fig. 1B) . This second ORF has no known functional domain and is only found in the genomes of Pezizomycotina, a large group of Ascomycota fungi (see phylogenetic analysis below). Translation from the first 59 ORF should produce a 19.5 kDa protein similar to YIP3. It is possible to generate a larger protein of 61.6 kDa in P. anserina that would encompass both the small 59 and large 39 ORFs by hypothesizing a -1 frameshift. Analysis of 12 independent cDNAs obtained during the P. anserina genome sequencing project showed that the mRNA sequence was identical to that of the gene except for a 173 bp intron located in the 59 untranslated region [21] . This indicates that the putative frameshift is not corrected by either RNA editing or splicing and thus it had to occur during translation. We could not find a canonical frameshift signal; however, examination of the PaYIP3 sequence suggested that frameshifting could happen at codon nu 170, since there is at this position the sequence ''U UUU UCC'', a potential slippery sequence [10] . Despite the fact that this slippery sequence does not match the consensus X XXY YYZ motif, this sequence would still allow tRNA tandem slippage by pairing of the tRNA Ser (IGA) to the -1 codon (UUC) since G-U base pairing between codon and anticodon is possible. Moreover, there is a sequence capable of forming a stem-loop and possibly a pseudoknot two nt downstream of the potential slippery sequence (Fig. 1C ), a feature that should increase frameshifting frequency [9, 10] . Such close vicinity between the slippery sequence and the stimulatory element is rather unusual for a 21 frameshifting stimulatory element. However the G-C stretch at the base of stem 1 is reminiscent of the very well-studied IBV pseudoknot [36] . Despite these unusual features we were able to detect the long frameshifted protein fused with GFP, demonstrating that this 21 frameshifting motif is indeed functional (see below).
