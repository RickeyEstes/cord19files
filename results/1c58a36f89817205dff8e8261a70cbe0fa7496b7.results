Typical FCV cythopatic effect was evident from the first passage on CrFK cell cultures. No growth was observed in cultured cells of canine origin. Results were negative for CPV-2, CCoV, CAV and type A rotavirus antigens. The isolate was identified as FCV by IF test using a cat serum anti-FCV (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, the faecal sample and the infected cells at the passage one and three, were screened for Caliciviridae family, FCV, CaCV, CCoV and CPV-2 by conventional RT-PCR or PCR. Results were negative for CCoV, CaCV and CPV-2. Caliciviruses were identified by using primers p289-p290 (Jiang et al., 1999) , whereas the virus was character-ized as FCV by using primers Cali1-Cali2 (Marsilio et al., 2005) specific for the FCV capsid gene (Fig. 2) . Nucleotide analysis of the PCR product (924 bp in length) obtained by using specific primers for FCV (Cali1-Cali2), confirmed that the virus was closely related to FCV. The novel isolate was designated FCV-Te/10/07. A sequence of 1557-nucleotides (nt) of ORF1 gene, encoding partial proteinase-polymerase region (pro-pol) (corresponding at nt positions 3176-4733 of FCV-F9 vaccinal strain: GenBank accession no. M86379) and 1834-nt of ORF2 gene encoding A-E regions of the VP1 capsid protein (corresponding at nt 5371-7260 of F9 strain), were determined. BLAST and FASTA analyses of the ORF1 sequence, revealed nucleotide identity of Te/10/07 to the FCV-F9 of 78.4%, while identity to CaCV/48 was equal to 52.6%. The highest sequence match was found to the F65 strain (UK/1990) (81% nt identity) isolated from cat with lameness and oral disease (Glenn et al., 1999) . Alignment of ORF2 sequences showed nucleotide identity of Te/10/07 to FCVs sequence available on GenBank database, ranged from about 71% to 80%, while the identity to the F9 strain was 75%. The phylogenetic tree based on the capsid amino acid sequence confirmed that the novel isolate clustered with the FCV group (Fig. 3) . Comparative analysis of the deduced amino acids (aa) sequences of the hypervariable region E (426-520 aa), revealed the highest similarity to strain LS015 (92%) (80% nt identity) (UK, 1985 (UK, -1988 ) associated with chronic stomatitis (Glenn et al., 1999) and to strain F65 (91.5%) (79% nt identity) (Glenn et al., 1999) ; similarity to FCV-F9 was about 87% (75% nt identity), whereas to the canine strain 213/95 (Italy, 2000) (Pratelli et al., 2000a; Martella et al., 2002) was 84% (73% of nucleotide identity). Investigation on the growth properties showed that the Te/10/07 strain tended to produce larger plaques (Fig. 4) than FCV-F9 in CrFK cells. Moreover, consistent with their larger plaque size, we found that the growth kinetic of the novel isolate was faster than F9 strain. As described in Table 1 , during the single-cycle growth kinetic experiment (MOI 10) we observed that the peak yield of FCV-Te/10/07 strain was produced between T1 (4 h p.i.) and T2 (8 h p.i.), while FCV F9 strain peak yield occurred at T3 (12 h p.i.) and T4 (24 h p.i.). In the multiple-cycle growth kinetic (MOI 0.02) we found that the titres of Te/10/07 increased exponentially by 4 h p.i. In contrast the F9 vaccine strain showed an exponential growth by 8-12 h p.i. In thermal inactivation experiments we observed that the loss of infectivity was similar for both strains analysed following 30 min incubation at 46.2 8C and full inactivation at 52.2 8C (data not shown). By serological investigation, neutralizing antibodies were present against the strain F9 in 63.9% (55/86) of dog sera with titres from 1:2 to 1:16; whereas antibodies anti-FCV-Te/10/07 were found in only seven sera (8.13%) all of which had concurrent neutralization antibodies to F9. A serum of these showed neutralizing antibodies titres Fig. 3 . Phylogenetic analysis of the capsid amino acid sequence of the Te/10/07. Tree was generated by using the neighbour-joining distance method. For each strain, the country and year of isolation and the GenBank accession number are indicated. against Te/10/07 higher than F9. However, none of the samples tested resulted positive only for the dog strain ( Table 2) . As reported in Table 3 , the prevalence of FCV-F9antibodies in cats was 76.54% (62/81). Neutralizing antibodies against Te/10/07 strain were recovered in 50.62% (41/81) of samples tested, and 38 sera were positives for F9 strain too, with similar titres or higher. In three cats antibodies were found only against the dog strain.
