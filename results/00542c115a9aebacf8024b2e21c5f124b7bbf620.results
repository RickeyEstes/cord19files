From April 2004 to April 2006, a total of 827 nasopharyngeal specimens from children, hospitalized with acute respiratory disease, were tested for common respiratory viruses. IFA diagnosis indicated that 151 (18.2%) specimens were positive for RSV, 9 (1.1%) for parainfluenza virus, 5 (0.6%) for influenza A virus, 2 for adenoviruses, and 1 for influenza B virus. RT-PCR detected 83 (10.0%) samples containing hMPV, and 14 (1.7%) containing HCoV-NL63. HCoV NL-63 was detected during May (1 specimen), November (4 specimens), and December (1 specimen The HCoV NL-63 positive patients were 5-58 months old (median, 11.5 months) and the ratio of males to females was 1.8:1. HCoV-NL63 positive patients were diagnosed as croup in 9 (64.2%), bronchiolitis in 3 (21.4%), bronchial asthma exacerbation in 1, and pneumonia in 1 (Table 1) . HCoV-NL63 was positive in 31.0% (9/29) of children with croup in this study population. Of the 20 cases of croup that were not associated with HCoV-NL63, RSV was detected in 5 patients, hMPV in 3 patients, and parainfluenza virus in 3 patients. The clinical presentations of patients were cough (100%), fever (35.7%), sputum production (28.5%), and dyspnea (35.7%). No patients had predisposing factors or underlying diseases. The positive PCR products were confirmed by sequencing and the partial -sequences of the 1a gene were deposited in GenBank (DQ093116-DQ093123, DQ351988, DQ453793-DQ453795, DQ534705-DQ534706). Direct sequencing of the PCR products of the 1a gene revealed that seven isolates had the same sequences and others limited variation of sequence (Fig. 2) .
