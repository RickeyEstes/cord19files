Our literature review revealed more than 30 bacterial, parasitic and viral pathogens that may cause persistent digestive disorders. Many of these infectious agents are epidemiologically well characterised in Western settings, while data regarding their occurrence in tropical and subtropical areas are scarce and often contradictory [6, [26] [27] [28] . Table 1 provides a list of all selected pathogens and typical clinical characteristics that may assist clinicians to curtail their differential diagnosis. However, pathogen-specific diagnosis can rarely be done based on the clinical presentations, and hence additional diagnostic tools are needed. The large number of available diagnostic tests for the selected pathogens is a challenge for providing the single most accurate method for a given pathogen. Hence, we classified the different methods into four diagnostic categories, namely (i) microscopy; (ii) culture; (iii) immunology (including enzyme immunoassays (EIA), serotyping of isolates and serology); and (iv) molecular biological diagnosis (e.g. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and DNA sequencing). Selection of a reference test for each specific pathogen is primarily based on the sensitivity and specificity of the test as well as practical considerations (e. g. costs, ease of application, availability, etc.). The results are presented in Table 2 (bacteria), Table 3 (intestinal protozoa), Table 4 (helminths) and Table 5 (viruses). Specific issues on the diagnostic work-up are summarised in the following sub-chapters. Bacterial pathogens Aeromonas spp., Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Salmonella enterica (non-typhoidal serovars, e. g. S. enterica ser. Enteritidis, S. enterica ser. Typhimurium), Shigella spp., Vibrio spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Y. pseudotuberculosis A stool culture on selective media is the test of choice to detect these diarrhoeagenic bacteria [31, 48, 50, 52, 53] . Different solid media (e.g. selective agar plates containing antibiotics and substances favouring the growth of the sought microorganism) are inoculated with a stool specimen to detect and isolate enteric pathogens. The additional use of a selective enrichment broth is helpful to identify pathogenic bacteria if their presence is quantitatively so low that they might otherwise be overlooked on solid media due to the overgrowth of non-pathogenic intestinal flora. The inoculated media are usually incubated for 24-72 hours at 35°C at ambient atmosphere to allow the bacteria to form macroscopically visible colonies. Of note, Campylobacter spp. are isolated using different growth conditions, i.e. incubation at a higher temperature of 42°C in microaerophilic atmosphere [53] . Following the incubation period, the agar plates are examined and morphologically suspicious colonies are identified using different biochemical identification panels or automated phenotypic identification systems (e.g. Vitek W ; bioMérieux, Marcy l'Étoile, France). Recently, more rapid identification algorithms making use of mass spectrometry (MS) have successfully been implemented into clinical microbiology laboratories (e.g. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS (e.g. MicroFlex LT; Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) [98] . Stool culture remains the diagnostic 'gold' standard for enteric pathogenic bacteria disposing certain characteristics which enable them to be selected out of the normal gastrointestinal flora, while other bacteria without such characteristics cannot be distinguished from apathogenic gut bacteria by culture methods alone (see below). Stool culture has important advantages, such as testing of isolated pathogens for antimicrobial susceptibility. As the successful antibiotic treatment of many bacterial intestinal infections requires knowledge of local resistance patterns (e.g. extent of fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter strains), stool culture techniques remain mandatory to guide therapeutic interventions. However, these tests are laborious and require experienced personnel, and typically take 48-72 hours to obtain first results. Hence, other, more rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been developed for some pathogens. For Campylobacter spp., for example, EIAs detecting a specific antigen in the stool proved to be a sensitive alternative to stool culture with results available within a few hours [32, 99] . However, there is no international consensus on immunological assays for detection of Campylobacter spp. and no globally validated and standardised approach, so that these tools should not replace the selective stool culture [100] . PCR assays, characterised by high sensitivity and specificity, have been developed for most of the aforementioned bacteria. Thus far, however, integration into clinical routine testing is still limited. Important drawbacks are the high cost, the need for sophisticated laboratory equipment and well-trained laboratory technicians. Moreover, PCR cannot distinguish between dead or alive bacteria and does not allow testing for antimicrobial susceptibility. However, newly developed multiplex PCR assays are increasingly being evaluated as fast screening tests for early detection of various important enteric pathogens. Besides PCR, novel molecular diagnostics are currently being developed and validated for many bacterial and viral pathogens, e.g. loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays. Results obtained thus far are promising [101, 102] , but it remains to be elucidated whether such nucleic acid amplification tests can be employed on a larger scale in resource-constrained settings in the tropics.
