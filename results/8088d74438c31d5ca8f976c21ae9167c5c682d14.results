In 2016, our Pediatric ED registered 23197 visits, 603 (2.6%) of whom for "acute asthma," "wheezing bronchitis," or "bronchospasm". Of the 603 patients, 491 (81%) were discharged, while 112 children (19%) were admitted, 15% ( = 89) to a short-stay observation (up to 36 hours) and 4% ( = 23) to our Pediatric Unit Ward; 1 child was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit after initial treatment in the Pediatric Ward. The main features of the study population are described in Table 2 . Sixty-five percent of children ( = 394) were males, while the rest of them ( = 209; 35%) were females. The median age of the patients was 3.1 years (range: 2 months-14 years). Forty hundred fifty-nine patients were younger than 6 years (median 2.1 years; = 206 < 2 years; = 253 ≥ 2 years and <6 years), while the rest of them ( = 144; 24%) were school-aged children and adolescents (median 8.7 years). At triage, 94 patients (15.6%) were given white colour tag, 282 (46.8%) green, 225 (37.3%) yellow, and 2 (0.3%) red ( Figure 1 ). The peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) upon arrival was <92% in 5.3% of cases, 92-95% in 34.4%, and >95% in 60.2%. The severity of the episode was classified as mild in 340 cases (56%), moderate in 237 (39%), and severe in 26 (4%), while none of the episodes was classified as lifethreatening. The etiologies of the exacerbations are described in Figure 2 . < .01), while in children ≥6 years 33% of the exacerbations were triggered by an allergic condition (versus 3% in children <6 years; < .01). One hundred ninety-one patients (31%) had a previous history of asthma or wheezing bronchitis and 54 of them (28%) were using an asthma controller therapy. Most had a mild exacerbation ( = 110; 57%) and 69 (36%) moderate, while only 12 (6%) presented a severe asthma attack. Sixteen percent of them required admission either to the short-stay observation or to the Pediatric Ward. Among the children with a previous asthma diagnosis, 95 (49%) were ≥6 years and 63 of them (67%) were not using any controller therapy (either for no prescription or for no use). The severity of the exacerbations in patients who are ≥6 years with a previous diagnosis of asthma and divided into two subgroups (controller therapy, no controller therapy) is shown in Figure 3 : asthmatic patients not using a controller medication were more likely to have a moderate-to-severe exacerbation than their peers under long-term therapy ( < .01). The seasonal trend of the exacerbations is shown in Figure 4 . Children <6 years showed a peak of exacerbations in autumn and winter concurrently with the infectious epidemic season, while school-aged children and adolescents showed a different trend with a peak in early autumn and another one during the pollen season.
