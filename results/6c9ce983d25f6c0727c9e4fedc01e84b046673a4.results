A total of 1005 NP/OP samples were collected from Tanzanian children <10 years old with an axillary temperature ě38˝C from April through December 2008. Among these, 38% (378/1005) harbored an HRV or HEV infection; we highlighted one patient presenting a co-infection with two species (HRV-A67 and HEV-99). Twenty-three percent (86/379) of isolates were not typable because of high CT values and/or bad sample quality. Among the 293 typable Enteroviruses detected in 292 patients, 244 (83%) revealed to be HRV and 49 (17%) HEV ( Figure 1 ). HRV-A types were the most frequent, followed by HRV-C and HRV-B. Among HEV, HEV-B were the most prevalent followed by HEV-A, -C and -D. Although some types were dominant, such as HRV-A12, -A65 and -A81, HRV-B69 and HRV-C2, and -C18 or CV-B5 for HEVs, many distinct types (54 distinct for HRV and 20 distinct for HEV) were co-circulating in our study population. Over the eight-month study period, HRV and HEV infection peaked from June to August (end of long rainy season/beginning of dry season) and from October to November (short rainy season), the maximum number of cases being from June to August for HRV, and October and November for HEV ( Figure 2 ). HEV accounted for 11% of Enteroviruses infections in the rural hospital (12/110), compared to 20% in the urban hospital (37/182; p > 0.05).
