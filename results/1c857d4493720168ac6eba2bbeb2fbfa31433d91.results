The FccRIIA SNP is Associated with Atopy As shown in Table 2 , the FCGR2A SNP (FccRIIA-131His.Arg, rs1801274) is significantly associated with atopy in the familybased association test (FBAT) (P = 0.003). The FCGR2A SNP is also associated with asthma and BHR in FBAT (P,0.05). Conditional logistic regression analysis estimated an OR of 0.732 (P = 0.027, 95% CI: 0.555-0.965) for FCGR2A SNP with atopy, suggesting a protective role against atopy for carriers of the FccRIIA-131His allele (population allele frequency = 0.488). Although the FCGR2A SNP is significantly associated with asthma and BHR in FBAT (P,0.05), the association were not significant in logistic regression analyses adjusted for age and sex. Further validation may be needed to confirm our findings. Furthermore, the functional SNPs of the other three activating FccRs (FccRIIIA, FccRIIIB, and FccRIIC) were not associated with asthma, BHR, and atopy (P.0.05) ( Table 3 ).
