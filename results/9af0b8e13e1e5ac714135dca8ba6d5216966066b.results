CTT κ-values span a narrow range even though CTL sequences are hypervariable: We quantified the evolutionary conservation of different regions within FtsZ across 1209 orthologous proteins. We used the sequences of G-actin derived from orthologs as a reference for this analysis because these sequences are highly conserved across evolution. We used the mean conservation score for G-actin to normalize the conservation scores for different regions of FtsZ. The results are shown in Figure 1C . The core of FtsZ and the CTP motif show considerably higher degrees of conservation when compared to the CTL and CTV regions, which are poorly conserved. We also calculated the distribution of κ-values for CTT sequences derived from 1209 distinct orthologs ( Figure 1D) . Given the conservation of the CTP, it follows that the variation in κ is mainly due to sequence variations within the CTL. Roughly 95% of the CTT κ values are within the interval 0.13 < κ < 0.36. The CTT from B. subtilis FtsZ has a κ value of 0.19. The expected distribution of κ values for randomly shuffled sequences that are constrained to have the CTT composition of B. subtilis FtsZ is shifted to lower values when compared to the actual κ values observed for the 1209 orthologous sequences ( Figure S2 ). However, when compared to the shuffled sequences generated in the absence of any selective pressure, many sequences with higher κ values are found, although very few naturally occurring sequences have a κ value above 0.4. This suggests that there is an evolutionary pressure against CTT sequences with κ values that go above 0.4. Similarly, there appears to be a selection pressure against sequences with κ values lower than 0.15.
