A qPCR assay for the detection of influenza C viruses was established as singleplex as well as duplex qPCR including our routine internal control FCV. The assay proved to be a robust and sensitive tool and furthermore did not show any cross-reactivity to a variety of viral respiratory pathogens and to human genomic DNA (validation results summarised in Table 2 ). The duplex qPCR approach was applied to retrospectively examine 1,588 throat or nasal swabs, of which 1,570 samples gave valid qPCR results, i.e. yielded either an influenza C or a FCV signal (or both) in duplex qPCR runs. Twenty samples (1.3%) were found positive for influenza C virus RNA, with C q values ranging from 19 to 39. The positive samples predominantly were taken between October 2012 and April 2013, reaching an average positivity rate of 2.6% (16/604) in these months (0.7-7.1% per month, Figure 1 ). Outside of this particular winter season, viruses were identified only sporadically with detection rates of 1.2% (3/249, January-April 2012) or 0.2% (1/414, October 2013 -April 2014 . No virus detection was achieved from May to September of any year studied. Also, no particular age distribution could be observed ( Figure 2 ). All influenza C-positive samples were additionally examined by qPCR to identify other respiratory viruses. More than half of the influenza C-positive patients (11/20; 55%) proved to be co-infected with diverse other respiratory pathogens (Table 3) , with influenza C C q values covering the complete range of 19 to 39. All 20 patients with influenza C virus infection reported fever and cough. Fifteen patients reported a maximum temperature between 38.5 °C and 40.2 °C, while for the remaining five patients the maximum temperature was not provided. Additionally, a sudden disease onset (18/20) , rhinitis (18/20) , sore throat (8/20) and muscular pain and/or headache (6/20) were predominant symptoms. Clinical signs of pneumonia were reported for one patient with an influenza C C q value of 25, but also low amounts of influenza A(H3N2) were detected in this sample. In patients with a sole influenza C virus infection, the sudden disease onset (7/9), the maximum fever (38.9 °C -40.2 °C in 6 patients), rhinitis (8/9), sore throat (4/9) and muscular pain and/or headache (2/9) were reported in similar proportions. The sequencing of the HE gene was achieved for 17 samples, of which three yielded only partial sequences. Two of the incomplete sequences covered a consecutive stretch of 1,071 and 1,218 nt, respectively, while The three incomplete sequences were only characterised based on the nt homologies to other sequences. The two fragments of sample 13-04691 (775nt, 557nt) are 100% identical to our sample sequence 13-04332, which belongs to the C/Victoria/2/2012 subgroup of the C/Sao Paulo clade. Similarly, sample sequence 13-05486 (1,037nt) is 100% identical to the sequence of C/Sao Paulo samples 13-04022 and 13-05206, which group into the C/Miyagi/6/2014 subgroup of the C/Aichi/1/99 subclade. Sample sequence 13-00631 has a similarity of > 99.2% to the same Sao Paulo lineage cluster, while the similarity to C/Victoria/2/2012 (98.1%) and the prototype strain sequences for the other five HE lineages is lower (≤ 95.4%).
