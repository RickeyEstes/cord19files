The study consisted of 250 hospitalizations for AECOPD among 219 different COPD patients during the 16.5-month period. In 241 cases (96.4%), a convalescence-phase serum sample was obtained at a mean Ϯ SD interval of 24.7 Ϯ 5.6 days (range, 17 to 53 days) after the first sample was obtained at the beginning of the hospitalization. Since the etiologic diagnoses in this study were based on changes in antibody level/titer between the acute-phase and convalescence-phase sera, we did not include in the final analyses of the study the nine hospitalizations for which no convalescence-phase serum was obtained. One other hospitalization was not included because we found a polyclonal response to all of the pathogens tested. In all, 240 hospitalizations of 213 patients were included in the final analyzed study population. In all 240 hospitalizations, the patients were treated during the course of their hospitalization with systemic corticosteroids. In 37 hospitalizations (15%), chest radiographs were classified by acute-phase imaging as suspected pneumonia, but only 28 of these radiographs (12%) were classified as "pneumonia" by one of the experts on the basis of the paired radiographs (acute phase and convalescence phase). In 23 hospitalizations (10%), paired chest radiographs were classified by the two examiners as pneumonia and were considered such for study purposes. These 23 hospitalizations were for 23 different patients, who were designated as the "PNAE group" of the study. In 13 patients, the pneumonia was right sided; in 8 patients, it was left sided; and in 2 patients, it was bilateral. In 13 patients, the pneumonic infiltrate was homogeneous; in 10 patients, it was nonhomogenous; and in 3 patients, more than one lobe was involved in the pneumonic process. The other 217 hospitalizations were among 190 different patients with COPD, who were designated as the "NPAE group" of the study. Table 1 presents a comparison of data between the 23 patients with PNAE and the 190 patients with NPAE. These include demographic data, baseline spirometry, and arterial blood gas test results in patients in stable condition, rate of chronic steroid therapy, rate of COPD complications, rates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, and rates of chronic comorbidity. No significant difference was observed for any of these variables between the two groups. Table 2 presents a comparison of clinical expressions of the exacerbation and arterial Po 2 and Pco 2 levels at admission between the two study groups. Compared to the NPAE group, the PNAE group had significantly higher rates of abrupt onset of acute exacerbation, fever during the acute exacerbation, crepitations on lung auscultation, and severe hypoxemia. There was no significant difference in the distribution of the exacerbations according to the classification of Anthonisen et al 2 between the two groups, but there was a clear trend to a higher rate of type 1 exacerbation in then PNAE group. Table 3 presents a comparison of the rates of invasive mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care, duration of hospitalization, mortality, and the course of recovery following discharge from the hospital between the two groups. In all of the first four parameters, which are markers of severity of the acute exacerbation, the PNAE group had significantly more severe results. In contrast, no significant difference was found between the two groups in the two parameters that relate to the course of recovery from the acute exacerbation following discharge from the hospital. In 22 of the PNAE hospitalizations (965) and in 153 of the NPAE hospitalizations (71%), at least one infectious etiology for the AE was identified by serologic testing. There was a significantly higher rate of viral etiologies in the PNAE group, especially in relation to parainfluenza virus type 2 and adenovirus. The PNAE group also had a significantly higher rate of bacterial etiologies, particularly pneumococcal. There was no difference between the groups in the rate of atypical bacterial etiologies. Compared to the NPAE group, a vary small and significantly lower percentage of patients in the PNAE group had no infectious etiology identified by serologic tests. More than one etiologic agent (mixed etiology) was found in 13 patients with PNAE patients and in 59 patients with NPAE, who represent 59% and 39%, respectively, of the patients in whom at least one etiologic agent was identified (p ϭ not significant [NS]). In two hospitalizations, blood culture findings were positive at admission. One patient with PNAE had a blood culture finding positive for S pneumoniae and also had a positive serology for that pathogen. This patient also had positive serologic test results for parainfluenza virus type 1, adenovirus, and M pneumoniae. One patient in the NAPE group had a blood culture finding positive for Streptococcus mitis. In this patient, serologic testing results were also positive for adenovirus (Table 4 ).
