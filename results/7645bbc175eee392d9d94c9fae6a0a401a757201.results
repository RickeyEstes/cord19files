Analysis of a single sample of each of the 844 calves born during the study period revealed that 404 calves were shedding oocysts, i.e. the prevalence of infection was 47.9%. The contingency tables containing the variables considered (consistency, mucosity and presence of blood) and on which the statistical analysis was carried out show that in all the calves examined (844) there was a significant association between parasitization with C. parvum and the consistency of the faeces (χ 2 , P < 0.001; linear trend test, P < 0.001). Thus, 52.5% of the parasitized calves had liquid faeces compared with 2.2% with solid faeces. Most of the animals that were not infected had soft faeces (65.5%). There was a significant association (χ 2 , P < 0.001) between parasitization by C. parvum and the presence of mucus in the faeces: 22.0% of the parasitized calves had mucus in their faeces, compared with 10.9% of the non-infected calves. Likewise, there was a relationship between the presence of C. parvum and the existence of blood in the faeces (χ 2 , P = 0.017), 3.2% of the infected calves had blood in their faeces, the incidence being three times higher than in non-infected animals. Furthermore, the relationship between the intensity of infection in the 404 infected calves and the macroscopic characteristics of their faeces was also studied. Statistical analysis showed a significant association between the intensity of infection and the consistency of the faeces (χ 2 , P < 0.001; linear trend test, P = 0.007). Thus, none of the calves with solid faeces had severe infection. However, it was found that there was no association between the intensity of infection and the presence of either mucus or blood in the faeces. In contrast, analysis revealed a significant association between the presence of both blood and mucus, and infection, independently of the intensity (χ 2 , P = 0.002).
