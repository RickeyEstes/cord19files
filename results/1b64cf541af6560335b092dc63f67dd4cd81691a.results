One hundred seventeen patients were admitted to the medical intensive care unit for severe CAP within the study period. Baseline characteristics of patients who suffered in-hospital mortality (n = 16, 13.7%) were compared with patients who survived, in Table 1 . Of note, the patients who did not survived were older compared to survivors (68.5 years vs 61.6 years, p = 0.11). Other baseline demographic and co-morbidity variables were not significantly different. Blood cultures, respiratory specimen cultures and respiratory specimen PCR testing for viruses and atypical bacteria were performed in all patients. Results of microbiological tests are presented in Table 2 . Causative microbial aetiologies were identified in 71.8% of patients with specific organisms presented in Table 3 . Majority of pathogens identified were respiratory viruses and bacteria. Viruses were found in 42.7% of patients (n = 50) with the most common virus being Influenza A. 35.7% (n = 10) of patients with Influenza A received empirical oseltamivir on the basis on clinical suspicion. Bacterial infections were found in 38.5% of patients (n = 45). 15.4% of patients (n = 18) had mixed virus and bacterial co-infections. 32 patients (27.4%) had only viral pathogens and 27 patients (23.1%) had only bacterial pathogens, found as the microbial aetiology for severe CAP. Using hospital mortality as the primary outcome, univariate logistic regression was performed (Table 4 ). Patients who did not survive had a higher APACHE II score and higher serum procalcitonin levels. The microbiological aetiology that was significantly associated with increased hospital mortality was the detection of mixed viral-bacterial co-infections. On multivariate analysis, APACHE II severity score, serum procalcitonin and mixed viral-bacterial co-infections remained significantly associated with increased adjusted odd ratios for hospital mortality. While APACHE II severity score is known to be predictive for mortality in severe CAP, the study found that the presence of mixed viral-bacterial co-infections was associated with increased hospital mortality by an adjusted odds ratio of 13.99 (95% confidence interval 1.30, 151.05, p = 0.030). The patients with respiratory viruses detected (both isolated viral pathogens and mixed viral-bacterial co-infections) were compared with patients who did not have any respiratory virus infections, in Table 5 . The mean serum C-reactive protein was found to be greater (178.1 ± 117.6 mg/L vs. 127.8 ± 105.0 mg/L) in patients without respiratory viruses compared to patients with detection of respiratory viruses (Table 5 ).
