The viruses were chosen based on the following criteria: (1) known to be pathogenic to human; (2) of significant health impact (e.g. HCV, rhinovirus, HIV, mumps, measles, SARS, HPV, and polio); (2) phylogenetically different; (4) proteomes established to a significant degree of completeness. In addition, the viral proteomes were chosen to span a range of proteome sizes, with the smallest viral proteome being 1613 amino acids, the largest being 65,280 amino acids, and all the viral proteomes combined amounting to 302,667 amino acids. The viral proteomes are described in Table 1 . As controls, we used 30 similarly sized protein sets drawn from the human proteome. In brief, we constructed 30 artificial sub-proteomes populated by proteins randomly selected without replacement from the human proteome. The constraints we used were that (1) the size of each artificial sub-proteome was to approximate the size of one of the viral proteomes, and (2) that the combined size of all the artificial proteomes was to approximate the combined size (in amino acids) of the viral proteomes. The 30 resultant artificial human sub-proteomes are described in Table 2 . Table has four columns. The first is the artificial subproteome number. The second is the cumulative amino acid length of all the human proteins in that artificial subproteome. The third column is the cumulative amino acid length of the corresponding viral proteome. The fourth column is the number of human proteins in the artificial sub-proteome. For example, in our virus versus human analysis, information for hepatitis C virus (HCV) was used as follows. The virus has taxonomic ID 11103 and a proteome consisting of 3010 amino acids (see Table 1 ). Corresponding to this virus is the artificial human sub-proteome 9, which contains 12 human proteins which sum to a cumulative length of 2979 amino acids (i.e. just about the 3010 amino acids in the HCV proteome). And similar for each of the other 29 viral proteomes. The list of the human proteins forming the 30 artificial human sub-proteomes is detailed as Swiss-Prot entries in Table 3 . Sequence similarity analyses of each of the 30 viral proteomes (or the 30 human artificial sub-proteomes) to the human proteome were conducted using viral (or human) 5mers sequentially overlapped by four residues. Basically, we used 5-mer sequences as probes to scan viral/human proteins against human proteome since pentapeptides are minimal structural units critically involved in biological/pathological interactions such as peptide-protein interaction and (auto)immune recognition ( [5, 7, 17, 18, 21] and further Refs. therein). Longer amino acid sequences (esa-, epta-, octapeptides, etc.) were used as additional probes to control the similarity pattern.
