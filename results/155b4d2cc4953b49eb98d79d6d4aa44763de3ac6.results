A total of 64 SOT recipients were included, of those, 47 (73.4%) patients required hospital admission. Types of transplant were 32 (50.0%) kidney, 14 (21.9%) liver, 14 (21.9%) heart and four (6.3%) lung with a median time from transplantation of 3. The median time from symptom onset to influenza diagnosis was 4.5 days (IQR 2.0-10.0) with the most common manifestations being cough (56, 87.5%) and fever (48, 48.4%; Table 2 ). Ten (15.6%) patients had severe disease and pneumonia, requiring admission to intensive care and four (6.3%) of them died. No other respiratory viruses were detected in the samples. Bacterial co-infection was more common in patients with severe disease (3, 30% versus 4, 7.4%, p 0.03, RR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1-10.5) with S. pneumoniae (two cases) and Aspergillus spp. (one case) in patients with severe disease versus S. pneumoniae (one case), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (two cases) and Aspergillus spp. and Rhizopus spp. (one case) in patients with non-severe disease. Other factors associated with severe disease were: chronic heart disease (7, 70% versus 15, 24.8%, p 0.01, RR 4.5, 95% CI 1.3-15.6), chronic pulmonary disease (5, 50% versus 11, 20.4%, p 0.04, RR 3, 95% CI 1-9), dyspnoea (7, 77.8% versus 17, 32.1, p 0.009, RR 5.5, 95% CI 1.2-24.5) and pneumonia (10, 100% versus 13, 24.1%, p <0.001; Table 3 ). Patients with severe disease initiated antiviral therapy at a median of 10.5 days (3.8-15.8 days) and patients with nonsevere disease at a median of 4 days (3-11 days) (p 0.21). Two patients with mild disease (3.1%) did not receive oseltamivir therapy, having favourable outcome. Median time of antiviral therapy was 10 days (6.5-14.0 days) versus 5 days (5.0-7.0 days; p 0.002) in severe and mild cases, respectively.
