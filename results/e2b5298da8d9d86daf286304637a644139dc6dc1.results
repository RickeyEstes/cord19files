3.1. G6PD Deficiency Impairs the Expression of the Antiviral Genes, TNF-Î± and MX1, upon HCoV-229E or EV71 Infection The A549 cells were infected with a retroviral vector expressing G6PD-specific (Gi) and Sc shRNA. The generated A549-Gi and A549-Sc were used to delineate the mechanism underlying the increased susceptibility of G6PD-deficient cells to viral infection. The expression of G6PD was significantly reduced in A549-Gi cells compared with the A549-Sc cells ( Figure 1A
