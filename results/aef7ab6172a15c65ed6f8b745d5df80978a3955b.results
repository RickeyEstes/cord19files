Two calves in the LV group were euthanized due to reasons not related to the BVDV infection (e.g. bone fracture due to aggressive temperament). All calves in the study were BVDV negative on the day of experimental inoculation (day 0) on the basis of virus isolation from serum samples. BVDV was isolated from spleen samples in all the animals in the LV (8/8) and HV (10/10) groups on day 5 after challenge, demonstrating an acute infection with BVDV in all the inoculated calves. In contrast, spleen samples from the control group were BVDV negative at the end of the experimental period (data previously published) [22] . The level of CD25 mRNA expression was different in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes of calves inoculated with HV or LV BVDV on day 5 after inoculation. The mRNA expression for CD25 (IL-2 receptor ‚ê£ chain) was upregulated in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes of calves in LV group when compared to the control group (P < 0.05, Table 2 , comparison by Ct method). Calves experimentally challenged with HV BVDV did not show a significant increase in CD25 mRNA levels in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes on day 5 post inoculation. In addition, the CD25 mRNA levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in tracheobronchial lymph nodes of calves in the LV group compared to those in calves in the HV group (Fig. 1, comparison by Ct method). The transcription levels of the CD25 gene in spleen of both groups of BVDV-inoculated calves did not differ from those of the uninfected control calves (P > 0.05, Table 3 , comparison by Ct method). The expression of FoxP3 and CTLA4 did not increase in the tracheo-bronchial lymph node or spleen samples in either of the BVDV-inoculated groups compared to the control group (Tables 2 and 3 , comparison by Ct method). Significant differences were not found in the expression of FoxP3 and CTLA4 between groups (Figs. 2 and 3) . Fig. 4 ) was observed on day 5 post inoculation in tracheobronchial lymph nodes of calves in the LV group relative to the control calves (P < 0.05, Table 2 , comparison by Ct method). There was a significant difference in the mRNA expression level of IDO in tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes between LV and HV groups (P < 0.05, Fig. 4 , comparison by Ct method). In contrast, the mRNA expression of IDO in spleen samples from calves inoculated with BVDV was similar to that observed in the control calves. (Table 3 , P > 0.05, comparison by Ct method).
