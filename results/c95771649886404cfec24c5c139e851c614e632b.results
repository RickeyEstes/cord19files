Specifically, the first panel shows a stationary 300-day endemic wave comprising 10 sub-epidemics with a cumulative case threshold C thr of 20 cases and parameter q = 0. Note that the last few sub-epidemics have not completed their course by the end of the simulation period. The second panel displays a temporary endemic wave comprising 5 sub-epidemics with a cumulative case threshold C thr of 20 cases and parameter q = 0. This epidemic wave profile differs from the previous one in that all of the sub-epidemics have completed their course within the first 250 days of the simulation. The third panel shows an epidemic wave comprising 10 declining sub-epidemics with a cumulative case threshold C thr of 20 cases where subsequent sub-epidemics Fig. 8 Representative 5-week ahead forecasts of the sub-epidemic model to the plague outbreak in Madagascar. The model was able to outperform simpler growth models in short-term forecasts based on the MAE, the MIS, and the coverage of the 95% prediction interval (Table 3) . Black circles correspond to the data points. The model fit (solid red line) and 95% prediction interval (dashed red lines) are also shown. The vertical line indicates the start time of the forecast declines exponentially with rate q = 0.3. The fourth panel displays an epidemic wave with sustained oscillations composed of three sub-epidemics with a high cumulative case threshold C thr of 800 without the effects of interventions (q = 0). That is, each new sub-epidemic is not triggered until the previous sub-epidemic has accumulated 90% of its final sub-epidemic size. Finally, the fifth panel represents an epidemic wave with damped oscillations comprising two sub-epidemics where the second one is affected by interventions or behavior changes (q = 0.6) and is triggered once the first one has accumulated 40% of its total size.
