The helix-helix dimer interface is conserved among all NS1 ED structures The favored dimerization interface of the NS1 ED remains controversial. To date, the isolated EDs of four influenza A virus strains have been examined by x-ray crystallography, giving rise to two proposed homodimer forms: strand-strand and helix-helix ( [28, 29, 30] and PDB ID 3M5R) (Fig. 1B) . In order to examine the possible dimerization arrangements of this domain in more detail, EDs of the divergent mouse-adapted human influenza A virus PR8 and avian influenza A virus Alb/76 were expressed and purified from bacteria. Consistent with previous reports, both EDs were dimeric in solution as determined by gel filtration (data not shown and [28] ). The purified EDs were screened for new conditions under which crystallization may occur in addition to those previously characterized. Four novel crystal forms were identified (three for PR8 NS1 ED and one for Alb/76 NS1 ED) and solved by x-ray crystallography using molecular replacement ( Table 1) . Three of the ED structures contained two molecules of NS1 in the asymmetric unit (PDB IDs 3OA9, 3O9S, and 3O9T), whereas eight monomers were present in the other structure (PDB ID 3O9U) ( Table 2) . Comparison of these new structures with previously published structures of the PR8 ED and Alb/76 ED indicated that in all cases contacts are formed at the helix-helix dimer interface, either within the asymmetric unit (3OA9, 3O9U, and 3O9S) or on a 2fold crystallographic axis (3O9T). In contrast, the strand-strand dimer interface is totally absent except for 3O9U ( Table 2) . Extension of these comparisons to all reported isolated NS1 ED Incompatibilities between ED homodimerization and ED binding cellular proteins. Shown are complexes of NS1 ED with the p85b-iSH2 domain (left panel, PDB ID 3L4Q) and CPSF30-F2F3 domain (right panel, PDB ID 2RHK). W187 is highlighted for reference. Note incompatibilities between NS1:p85b, the strand-strand dimer (Fig.  1B, left) , and the full-length NS1 dimer (Fig. 1A) . Note incompatibilities between NS1:CPSF30 and the helix-helix dimer (Fig. 1B, right) . In all panels, NS1 monomers are colored green or wheat, and cellular proteins are colored red. The N-and C-termini of NS1 constructs are labeled. For the NS1:CPSF30 structure in Fig. 1C , right the second monomers of NS1 ED and CPSF30-F2F3 that make up the published tetrameric complex [33] are shown in gray. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017946.g001 structures indicates that the helix-helix dimer is ubiquitous, suggesting that the contacts at this dimer interface form a favorable interaction. In contrast, no other contact surface, including the strand-strand dimer interface, is consistently conserved among all crystal structures ( Table 2 and Fig. 2 ).
