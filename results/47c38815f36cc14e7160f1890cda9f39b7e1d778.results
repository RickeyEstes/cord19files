With respect to regional interest in the search term "Ebola" (see Fig. 1b ), the greatest RSV was registered in Liberia (100/100), followed by Sierra Leone (99/100) and Guinea (42/100), the three West African countries mainly affected by the 2014 Ebola epidemic. In relation to other countries where Ebola primary cases were registered, the RSVs were 18/100, 14/100, 11/100, 5/100, 4/100, 3/100 and 2/100 in Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, US, Spain, UK and Italy, respectively. Table 1 shows the top and rising queries for the search term "Ebola" both at the global and country levels. Queries varied in the different countries and with respect to global researches: in particular, three out of the first five global Ebola-related rising queries were related to the first primary case of Ebola in the US. Figure 2 shows the interest in Ebola, using "Ebola" as a search term, over time both at the global and country levels. Both quantitative and qualitative differences between the affected African countries and other Western countries with primary cases were noted, in terms of the different flux volumes (expressed as relative percentages) and different time courses. In the African countries, the peaks coincided with Ebola victims being quarantined in Guinea and the WHO announcement of the Ebola epidemic. In particular, in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal, the highest peak of web searches (RSV = 100/100) corresponded with the Belfast Telegraph headline "WHO declares Ebola emergency"; in Guinea the highest peak coincided with the news of the first Ebola victims quarantined; and in Mali with the news of an American doctor being cured for Ebola. In the three primarily affected African countries, Ebola-related web searches declined in the months after the WHO announcement of the Ebola epidemic, despite the increase in Ebola cases. In all Western countries, a similar pattern in Ebolarelated web searches was observed. Further, these trends reflected the global interest in Ebola: the two highest peaks of web searches (on 16 October 2014 and 8 August 2014, corresponding to US President Obama's press release and the WHO announcement of the Ebola epidemic, respectively) could be detected in all curves. In the UK and Italy, two further peaks were observed: in UK, a small peak (RSV = 25/100) was registered on 30 December 2014, corresponding to the news headline "Ebola patient in Britain transferred to London"; while in Italy a small peak (RSV = 17/100) was registered on the third week of April 2014, some days after the news of the first Ebola victims quarantined in Guinea. Figure 3 outlines the regional interest in the search term "Ebola" in each of the 10 countries affected by Ebola primary cases. In the affected African countries, with the exception of Nigeria (see Fig. 3e ), web query search volumes were concentrated in the capital areas, while no queries were reported in regions when the epidemic first spread. In Nigeria, the interest in Ebola was concentrated not only in the capital (Abuja), but also in other not neighbouring regions. However, in Western countries, the web queries were uniformly distributed over the national territory (see Fig. 3 ). Figure 4 shows the weekly GT index for search queries for "Ebola" compared with the number of new weekly Ebola cases, as reported in the WHO patient database and situation report, at the global level and in the three mainly affected West African countries. Raw data about weekly GT index for search queries for "Ebola" and new weekly Ebola cases, as reported in the WHO patient database and situation report, are available in Additional file 2. The correlation between the number of global new weekly cases of Ebola and the weekly GT index was moderate, both considering the WHO patient database (r = 0.553, p-value <0.001) and the WHO situation report (r = 0.409, p-value = 0.001). In terms of the three countries mainly affected by the Ebola epidemic, the correlation between new weekly cases of Ebola reported in the WHO patient database and the weekly GT index varied from weak in Guinea (r = 0.232, p-value = 0.07) to moderate in Sierra Leone (r = 0.481, p-value <0.001) and Liberia (r = 0.640, p-value <0.001). When correlating with new weekly cases of Ebola reported in the WHO situation report, the correlation was weaker and not statistically significant in all cases. Figure 5 shows the correlation between the RSV for "Ebola", the total number of Ebola cases per country registered over the entire period of the outbreak and the HDI, in all countries where Ebola cases were registered. The correlation between the number of Ebola cases registered in all countries during the study period and the GT index was very high (r = 0.916; p-value <0.001). In particular, the three mainly affected African countries are characterised by a strong correlation between the RSV, the number of Ebola cases and the HDI, which is quite different from the other countries (see Fig. 5 ). In order to investigate these correlations more deeply, two different regression models were developed, using GT-based RSVs for "Ebola" searched worldwide, and epidemiological data (the number of Ebola cases) (first model), and the number of Ebola cases and the HDI (second model) as predictor variables (see Table 2 ). The second model showed the best fit (Akaike information criterion = 709.927). The HDI was a negative predictor for GT-based RSV (p-value <0.0001), whilst the number of Ebola cases (p-value <0.0001) and the interaction between the number of cases and the HDI (p-value <0.0001) were positive predictors.
