Statistical analyses showed no significant differences (p > 0.05) in gene expression of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, IFN-g, nVDR, RANKL, and OPG between the initial subgroups (type I vs type II lesions). Both subgroups were also compared to the control group. They both revealed similar significant differences. Therefore data from the initial groups were combined in the further analyses. Q-Q plots (data not shown) showed no deviation from normality for any cytokines or nVDR. The expression of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, IFN-g, and nVDR was all significantly higher in the RL group than in the control group Table 1 Primers for the feline genes of interest (GOI).
