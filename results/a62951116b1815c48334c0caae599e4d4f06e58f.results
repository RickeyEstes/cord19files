Cytotoxicity of two Achillea kellalensis extracts showed different concentrations. Hydro-alcoholic extract had low CC 50 at 600 µg/mL by the NR assay while aqueous extract had high CC 50 at 1000 µg/mL by the crystal violet method ( Table 1 , Figures 1 and 2) . Growing MA-104 cells were treated with various concentrations of Achillea kellalensis extracts and the viability was measured by trypan blue dye exclusion method. In MA-104 cells a decrease in the viability with increasing concentration was observed. The aqueous and hydro-alcoholic extracts showed 50% viability at 800 µg/mL and 700 µg/mL respectively. These data are shown in Figure  3 . The inhibitory effects of A. kellalensis on the bovine rotavirus were examined by the same methods used to evaluate cell toxicity. Extracts from flowers of Achillea kellalensis were shown to be effective against bovine rotavirus. These results of the antiviral assays of A. kellalensis extracts are depicted in Table 1 . In the simultaneous treatment assay and post treatment assay, the extracts were able to prevent viral replication and inhibit the viral CPE on MA-104 cells at 10 TCID 50 . The effective concentration (EC 50 ) of both extracts was observed at 100 µg/mL. In order to test the ability of the two A. kellalensis extracts in inhibiting the adsorption of bovine rotaviruses in MA-104 cells, the virucidal assay was used. However, in contrast to the simultaneous treatment assay and post treatment assay, no inhibitory effects against rotavirus was shown in the virucidal assays and pretreatment assay, and the extracts did not exhibit direct antiviral activity on rotavirus adsorption.
