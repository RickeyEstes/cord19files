A total of 161 patients fulfilling at least two SIRS criteria were included in the study. Because of exceeded time limits between admission and the index test, non-evaluable samples, missing data and withdrawal of consent, 10 patients were subsequently excluded. For the remaining 151 patients, clinical and demographic characteristics, comorbidity and antibiotic treatment before admission are summarized in Table 1 . The expert panel classified 117 patients as infected: 96 with a bacterium, 16 with a virus and five with a parasite. From all but three patients, blood cultures were obtained at admission. A pathogenic bacterium was isolated from blood in 22 patients (15%). At admission and during the first seven days in the hospital, additional cultures were conducted in urine from 96 (64%), sputum from 57 (38%), swabs (skin, wound, or mucosal) from 22 (15%), stools from 19 (13%), and cerebrospinal fluid from 13 (8.6%) patients. A clinically relevant pathogen was isolated from 74 (49%) of the patients. Primary sites of infection and pathogens isolated are summarized in Table 2 . All 19 patients classified as having a bacterial infection in the respiratory system in the absence of microbial documentation had chest radiograph findings suggestive of bacterial infection. In the 34 patients classified as non-infected, the causes of SIRS were respiratory distress (lung oedema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation with no signs of infection, and embolus of the lung; (n = 8), malignant disease (n = 8), intracranial haemorrhage (n = 2), allergic reaction (n = 2), metabolic acidosis (n = 2), noninfectious pancreatitis (n = 1), gout (n = 1), use of impure intravenous drugs (n = 1), ruptured mitral valve chordae (n = 1), ruptured thoracic aneurism (n = 1), Castleman's disease (n = 1), Addison's disease (n = 1), subileus (n = 1) and polymyositis (n = 1). Finally, in three patients no explanation for SIRS was found. There was disagreement among reviewers in 11 cases; by consensus, seven of these were classified as non-infected, two as bacterial infection and two as viral infection. A total of 120 patients (79%) were given antibiotics during the first 24 hours of hospitalization: 64% of the patients with inflammation of nonbacterial origin and 90% of the patients with a bacterial infection. Six patients without a bacterial infection (11%) and three (3.1%) with a bacterial infection died before day 30 after admission. After six months, 11 (20%) patients who did not have a bacterial infection and eight (8.3%) patients who did have a bacterial infection had died. Individual baseline values and median levels of the six biomarkers are shown in Figure 2 . The computed specificities, sensitivities, positive and negative predictive values, and AUCs of the single markers and the composite markers with regard to diagnosis of bacterial infection are shown in Table 3 . The cor-responding ROC curves are shown in Figure 3 . The six-marker test performed significantly better than all of the single markers (P = 0.010 for CRP and P < 0.001 for the five remaining markers). Additional analysis of the ability of single markers to discriminate between infection of any kind and no infection It was apparent from Figure 2 that patients with a parasitic (Plasmodium falciparum) infection had high concentrations of CRP and PCT in particular, and so the effect of omitting these patients on the AUCs for these two markers was determined. This analysis identified AUCs of 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.90) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.69-0.85) for CRP and PCT, respectively, with regard to discrimination between bacterial and nonbacterial causes of inflammation. Several of the markers may be affected by immune-deficient conditions, and therefore an ancillary analysis was conducted in which 38 patients with solid tumours, haematological malignancies, HIV infection, leucocyte counts below 1 Ã— 109 cells/l, or treated with an immunosuppressant were excluded. In this analysis the ability of the markers to diagnose bacterial infections remained virtually unchanged. None of the single marker AUCs changed by more than 0.04 (data not shown). To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the six single markers and the two composite markers in a relevant subgroup, an analysis of the 57 patients diagnosed as having COPD or asthma with acute exacerbation or pneumonia (excluding In addition, the ability of single markers to predict cultureproven bacteraemia was tested. The three markers with the greatest AUCs were PCT, CRP and MIF, with AUCs of 0.84 Table 2 Site of infection and pathogens isolated
