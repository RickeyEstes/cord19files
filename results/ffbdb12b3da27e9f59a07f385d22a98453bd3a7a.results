This study was terminated after the inclusion of 14 calves as the first 8 inoculated animals did not develop CDAD (diarrhea and concurrent fecal C. difficile toxins). On arrival, 13 of 14 calves were clinically normal and had no signs of diarrhea; the calf with diarrhea was used for descriptive analysis and euthanized on day 2. One of eight inoculated calves developed diarrhea within 6 h of inoculation; it was used for descriptive analysis, received two more doses of C. difficile, and was monitored until day 6 as its diarrhea improved by day 2. Comparative statistical analysis was conducted with five control and seven inoculated calves. There was no age difference between the groups (mean AE 1S.D.; 17.6 AE 7.4 h, range = 6-28 h, and 12.6 AE 8.1 h, range = 5-24 h, respectively; p = 0.24), and all calves had adequate plasma protein concentrations (inoculated calves, 73.3 AE 7.1, range = 64-85 g/L; controls, 63.5 AE 3.7, range = 60-70 g/L; p = 0.07) (Rea et al., 1996) . The inocula administered to the calves had a concentration of 1.4 Â 10 8 AE 3.5 Â 10 8 cfu of C. difficile PCR-ribotype 077 organisms (range = 1 Â 10 5 , 1 Â 10 9 ; n = 15), of which, 7.3 Â 10 4 AE 1.5 Â 10 5 cfu were spores (range = 1 Â 10 2 , 4.6 Â 10 5 ; n = 10). By the end of the study, 5/5 control calves and 2/7 inoculated calves developed diarrhea ( p = 0.03), but the average length of study was not different between groups (inoculated: 5.7 AE 0.3 days; range = 5.5-6 days; controls: 4.4 AE 1.5 days; range 3-6 days; p = 0.3). Three of five control calves were euthanized before day 6. In total, 24 and 43 fecal samples were collected from 6 control and 8 inoculated calves, respectively, for C. difficile culture. Of these, 18 and 27 samples, respectively, were processed for C. difficile toxins. All 14 calves tested negative with the toxin ELISA the day of arrival. Toxins were detected in one of the fecal samples tested (1/18 (5.5%) versus 0/27 (0%), p = 0.4); it was from a control calf with diarrhea on day 3. The ELISA was also positive in one of the intestinal samples tested (1/12 (8.3%) versus 0/16 (0%), p = 0.43); the ileum of another control calf euthanized on day 3 due to severe diarrhea. C. difficile was isolated from 26/43 (60.5%) fecal samples of the 8 inoculated calves but not from 24 samples of the 6 non-inoculated calves ( p < 0.001). C. difficile was also cultured from 6/42 (14.3%) intestinal samples representing six calves; 2/6 ceca of controls, and 3/8 ceca and 1/8 duodenum of inoculated calves. Isolation of C. difficile was significantly more frequent from cecum (5/14) than collectively from duodenum (1/14) and ileum (0/14) ( p = 0.01) ( Table 1) . A very low measured agreement (k < 0.2) was observed when the last fecal culture and the intestinal cultures interpreted in parallel were compared. PCR-ribotyping confirmed that 22/26 (84.6%) fecal and 4/6 (66.6%) intestinal C. difficile isolates were the inoculated PCR-ribotype 077 ( Table 1 ). The remaining six isolates, representing five calves (feces of three inoculated, and ceca of two control calves), showed five different PCR-ribotypes (data not shown). Both control calves harbouring C. difficile in the cecum were euthanized due to severe watery diarrhea on days 2 and 3, but tested negative with the toxin ELISA. These calves were the only animals that tested positive for enterotoxigenic E.coli; and one additionally harboured Salmonella spp. C. perfringens was present in both groups (3/6 control, 5/ 8 inoculated; p = 1.0). No verotoxigenic E. coli, rotavirus or coronavirus were identified in the study. Three C. difficile isolates, one PCR-ribotype 077 and two of other ribotypes, were cultured from feces of three calves with <24 h of age, before inoculation. Similarly, two other PCR-ribotypes, cultured from cecum of two controls at 48 and 72 h of age, and from feces of two inoculated calves at 48 h of age, indicated early natural infection. Post-mortem analysis revealed mild-to-moderate non-specific macroscopic changes (intestinal mucosa congestion, increased intestinal fluid content, mesenteric edema and edematous lymph nodes) in 4/6 control and 2/8 inoculated calves ( p = 0.28). Microscopic inflammatory changes were overall mildmoderate, but they were more commonly seen in cecum and ileo-cecal lymph node of inoculated calves (Fig. 1) . No intestinal ulceration, edema, or mucosal pseudomembranes were identified in inoculated animals.
