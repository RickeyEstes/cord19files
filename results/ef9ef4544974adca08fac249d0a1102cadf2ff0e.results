Structure elucidation and quality of the structural models Wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9 and its Cys69Ala and Cys69Ser mutants were cloned with a His 6 tag connected to the N terminus of the protein via the linker sequence VKLQ. The latter tetrapeptide corresponds to the C terminus of SARS-coronavirus Nsp8 (as well as HCoV-229E Nsp8) and therefore introduces a cleavage site for the main proteinase (M pro ) of SARS-CoV. After purification of the His 6tagged protein using Ni-NTA chromatography, cleavage with the M pro yielded Nsp9 with an authentic N terminus. The wild-type Nsp9 was crystallized using a reservoir containing 1.8-2.1 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.0-4.5, and 5% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD). Crystals were of space group P622, with a monomer in the asymmetric unit ( Table 1 ). The structure was determined by molecular replacement, using a monomer of the SARS-CoV Nsp9 25 as the search model, and refined to 1.75 Å resolution. Residues 1-7 and 33-36 could not be modeled due to lack of electron density. Alternate conformations were detected in the electron density for the side-chains of Met9 and Lys82. The final R-factor for the structural model is 19.0% and the R free is 22.4%; 97.2% of the amino acid residues are in the most-favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and the remainder in the additionally allowed regions. 26 The Cys69Ala mutant of HCoV-229E Nsp9 was prepared by single-site PCR mutagenesis from the wild-type plasmid. Preparation of the protein was identical with wild-type Nsp9. The conditions identified for crystallization of the wild-type Nsp9 failed to yield crystals of the mutant. Instead, the following crystallization conditions were established: 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.2 M sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEG-MME) 2000. The crystals displayed space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 , with a dimer of the Nsp9 mutant per asymmetric unit (Table 1) . Residues 1, 2 and 109 of monomer A have not been modeled due to lack of electron density; the same is true for residues 1-4 and 107-109 of monomer B. The segment comprising residues 53-56 could be built into electron density but proved to be very flexible. The structure was refined to a resolution of 1.80 Å, with R = 22.1% and R free = 28.1% (see Supplementary Data Fig. S1 ). Of the amino acid residues in the structural model, 92.5% are in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot and the remainder are in the additionally allowed regions. 26 Overall structure of the Nsp9 monomer Crystals of wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9 contain one monomer per asymmetric unit, which forms a homodimer due to the crystallographic twofold axis (see below). The fold of the monomer is related to the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding modules (OB fold). This fold is characteristic of proteins binding to single-stranded nucleic acids 27 and occurs, for example, in ssDNA-binding proteins from bacteria 28 to man 29 as well as in viruses. 30 The canonical OB fold comprises five antiparallel βstrands that form a partial barrel, and an α-helix that packs against the bottom of the barrel, usually in an orientation along the long axis of the β-barrel crosssection. 27 In the classical OB fold, the α-helix is interspersed between β-strands 3 and 4, but in Nsp9 the helix is appended at the C terminus of the polypeptide chain (residues 92-108). Also, Nsp9 has two extra β-strands (strands 6 and 7) forming a long hairpin (L67). Some of the loops connecting the βstrands, e.g. L12, L23, L45, and L67 (see Fig. 1 ), are very flexible. In the electron density map for wild-type HCoV-229E Nsp9, we unequivocally located an MPD molecule that fills a space between strand β2 and the C-terminal α-helix in the monomer, very much in agreement with the commonly observed binding pattern for this amphiphilic additive. 31 The hydroxyl groups of the MPD make hydrogen bonds with Asn27 and a (half-occupied) sulfate ion, which is in turn interacting with one of two alternative sidechain conformers of Lys82 and the main-chain amide of Asn27. The hydrophobic side of the MPD interacts with Leu29 and packs against the helix near Val106 (Supplementary Data Fig. S2 ). This observation explains nicely why 5% MPD was an essential additive in the crystallization of HCoV-229E wild-type Nsp9, in addition to the (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 . The structure of the monomer of the HCoV-229E Nsp9 Cys69Ala mutant displays an r.m.s. deviation of 0.71 Å from the wild-type monomer (for 92 C α atoms of chain A of the mutant; the corresponding values for chain B are 87 C α atoms and 0.67 Å; see Fig. 1 ). In this calculation, residues 1-7, 33-36 (loop L23), and 107-109 have been omitted because of weak or non-visible electron density in one or both of the two structures. Larger than average deviations occur in loops L12 (residues [19] [20] [21] [22] and L45 (residues 55-60; the tip of this loop at residue Ser58 deviates by 4.36 Å and 2.89 Å between wild-type and mutant molecules A and B, respectively). The r. m.s. deviation between monomers A and B of the Cys69Ala mutant is 0.96 Å (for 99 C α atoms). In contrast to the wild-type Nsp9, MPD was not a useful additive in crystallization experiments with the mutant protein. However, dithiothreitol (DTT) Fig. 1 . Superimposition of monomers.

Again, we located extra electron density between Asn27 and the α-helix (this time near Ile102) and attributed this to a DTT molecule, although the assignment was not as unambiguous as was the identification of MPD in a nearby location in the wild-type protein. Comparison of the Nsp9 monomer with SARS-CoV Nsp9 The HCoV-229E Nsp9 monomer is also very similar to the monomer of SARS-CoV Nsp9 25
