Immune staining with the anti-His monoclonal antibody identified polypeptides of the expected sizes (38.5 and 40 kDa) in the lysates of the bacterial cells transformed with clones S66 and S55, respectively (Fig. 2) . The reactivity of the recombinant polypeptides S66 and S55 was evaluated by Western blotting using dog sera-positive to either CCoV type I or to CCoV type II, as well as negative control sera. Both the 38.5 and 40 kDa polypeptides reacted only with the sera-positive to CCoV type I, while they were not recognized by the sera-positive to CCoV type II and by the negative control sera. In the ELISA the cut-off point was determined as 0.024 when using the polypeptide S66 and 0.033 when using the polypeptide S55. The four sera-positive for CCoV type II displayed an OD median value of 0.034 when using the polypeptide S66 and 0.028 when using the polypeptide S55. Interestingly, the sera-positive for CCoV type I showed OD median values of 0.073 and 0.076 when using the polypeptides S66 and S55, respectively. The 10 negative control sera showed OD median values of 0.016 and 0.009 for the S66 Fig. 2 . Immune-staining with anti-His monoclonal antibody.

The detailed results are shown in Table 1 . The VN test carried out on the negative control sera confirmed the absence of antibodies to CCoV. The four dog sera-positive to CCoV type I resulted negative. Otherwise, the four sera-positive to CCoV type II showed VN titres ranging from 1:32 (three dogs) to 1:16 (one dog) (Pratelli et al., 2003b) .
