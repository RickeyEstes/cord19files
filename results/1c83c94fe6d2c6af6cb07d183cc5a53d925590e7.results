The principles of the Mapitope algorithm A unique computer algorithm Mapitope enabled us to map epitopes on spike protein using peptides that bind to 80R. Mapitope is an updated userfriendly version of the algorithm previously published by Enshell-Seijffers et al. 16 The prediction of an epitope is based on the notion that the panel of peptides derived from a random peptide library collectively represents the epitope of the mAb which they bind. The underlying principle of Mapitope is that the simplest meaningful fragment of an epitope is an amino acid pair (AAP) of residues that lie within the footprint of the epitope. These AAPs can be related to one another on the surface of the antigen such that a cluster is defined which constitutes the majority of the epitope footprint, i.e. the epitope is in essence a cluster of connected AAPs. The AAPs of the epitope need not be consecutive tandem residues of the antigen, but often are the result of juxtaposition of distant residues brought together through folding of the polypeptide chain, the distance between their carbon alphas (parameter D), defines what constitutes a legitimate pair. AAPs of the epitope are simulated by tandem residues of the peptides, affinity selected from the random library. Each peptide is assumed to contain one or more epitope relevant AAPs, which is the basis for mAb recognition of that peptide. In order to identify the statistically significant pairs (SSPs) present in the panel of peptides, the peptides are first deconvoluted into AAPs. Thus, for example to deconvolute a peptide into AAPs, a peptide of the sequence ABCDE... would be written as the series of pairs: AB, BC, CD, DE, etc. All the AAPs derived from the panel of peptides are then pooled and the frequency of each type is calculated. It is next determined whether the AAPs representation in the pool is higher than the random expectation and if so, these pairs are considered to be SSPs. A second parameter of the algorithm (the first being D) is the frequency of a specific pair in a given pool of AAPs derived from the panel of peptides. The number of standard deviations above randomness for a given pair is defined as the statistical threshold (ST). Once the most frequent AAPs are identified, the algorithm seeks the pairs for a selected D value on the surface of the antigen and attempts to link them into clusters. A third parameter of the algorithm is E, the surface accessibility threshold. E defines those residues that are sufficiently exposed on the antigen's surface to be included in the predicted epitope. The accessibility of each amino acid is automatically calculated using the software "SurfRace," 18 which has been assimilated in the algorithm software. In this study the SSPs which were mapped on the 3-D structure of the antigen contained residues that are at least 5% exposed (EZ5); however, impact of the E parameter was examined as well (see below). As contacts between the mAb and the antigen are mostly through functional moieties of the R-groups, conserved residues were consolidated into 13 functional subgroups of amino acids and given single-letter notations: In summary, a mAb is used to screen a random peptide library to generate a panel of peptides Prediction of a Neutralizing Epitope for SARS recognized by the mAb. These peptides are deconvoluted into AAPs and the SSPs are identified. These are then mapped in the crystal structure of the antigen and the most elaborate and diverse clusters on the surface of the antigen are identified. These are regarded as the predicted epitope candidates. Phage display peptide panning against 80R scFv A variety of combinatorial phage display peptide libraries were screened with the 80R single chain variable fragment (scFv) (see Materials and Methods). Two independent panels of peptides were isolated ( Table 1 ). The peptides were derived from two different types of random peptide libraries, 42 peptides derived from cysteine constrained-loop libraries were designated as panel 1 and 18 peptides, derived from libraries of random linear peptides, were designated as panel 2. No common homologous motif was observed within the peptides themselves, or between the peptides and the SARS-CoV spike protein. This is not surprising in view of the fact that the epitope of 80R is conformational. 3 Each set of peptides was used independently for Mapitope analysis, thus generating two independent predictions of the 80R epitope. Analyzing the peptides and defining statistically significant pairs (SSPs) The first step in applying the algorithm is to "translate" the peptides into Mapitope functional notations (see above) and to deconvolute them into AAPs. Deconvolution of peptides into AAPs using the functional notation allows for 13 classes of amino acids and therefore 169 possibilities. However, as 13 pairs are homodimers (e.g. AA, BB, etc.) the total number of different AAPs possible is 156. Deconvolution of the 42 peptides of panel 1 produced a total of 568 AAPs which are represented by 133 different pair types. Taking STR3, a total of 11 pair types were found to be statistically significant pairs (SSPs). These 11 pair types (8% of all available 133 pair types) were represented by 108 pairs (19% of all the 568 pairs). Similarly, deconvolution of the 18 peptides of panel 2 produced a total of 252 AAPs represented by 89 different pair types. Taking STR3, a total of 12 pair types were found to be SSPs. These 12 pair types (13% of all available 89 pair types) were represented by 60 pairs (24% of all the 252 pairs). The Mapitope predictions are based on focusing on those pairs that are statistically enriched. Figure 1 (a) gives the 11 SSPs of panel 1 comparing the observed occurrence with the calculated expected occurrence based on total randomness. Note that in Figure 1 (b) the highest value for occurrence does not necessarily promise the greatest statistical significance, since the statistical significance depends on the individual expectation of each SSP (for more explanation about random expectation of SSPs and factors that can influence this parameter see Enshell-Seijffers et al. 16 ). Compare for example, the SSPs CU versus YC; CU appears 26 times in the peptides, which is five standard deviations greater than its expectation in the library (in a panel of 42 totally random peptides, CU is expected to appear 18.1 times). On the other hand, the SSP YC appears only six times, but is two times more abundant than would be expected; consequently its ST value is 4.76. An extreme case is the pair CJ which exists eight times in the peptides; however, its expected occurrence is 9.05 and therefore this pair is actually under-represented (not shown). Similarly, analysis of the 18 peptides of panel 2 is shown in Figure 1
