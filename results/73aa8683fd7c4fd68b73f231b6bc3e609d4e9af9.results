Subcellular localization of Dhh1, Pat1 and polysomal complexes during exponential growth and the growth retardation phase Dhh1 and Pat1 have been shown to be capable of acting, at least under certain conditions, as translational repressors (3). However, knockouts of these genes have not been observed to lead to enhanced protein synthesis rates (4), thus indicating that we have yet to understand the role of these proteins in controlling global translation and thus cell growth. In order to throw light on this poorly understood area, we used fluorescent tags to label Dhh1 and Pat1 and then compared their subcellular distributions with those of GFP-tagged 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits under different growth conditions. In the first instance, we chose to use the tetracysteine motif (TCM) tag combined with biarsenical dyes (22, 23) to label Dhh1 and Pat1. The TCM fusion constructs used in this work were chromosomally integrated behind the respective natural promoters (see 'Materials and Methods' section) so that the intracellular levels of the encoded fusion proteins were the same as the normal endogenous levels of the non-fused proteins. Focusing first on cells growing exponentially on glucose, we made an unexpected observation: the pool of ribosomes [large (Rpl25a) and small (Rps2) subunits] was partly segregated from Dhh1 and Pat1. This is most evident in single Z-section (not 3D) images in Figure 1A . In controls, western blot analysis of polysomal gradient fractions revealed that the GFP-fused ribosomal subunit proteins were exclusively associated with assembled ribosomal subunits (data not shown). In order to control for any potential influence of the chosen protein tagging strategy, we repeated this experiment using GFP-tagged Dhh1 and Pat1 together with TCM-tagged ribosomes ( Figure 1B ; fluorescence labelling controls are shown in Supplementary Figure S1 ). The advantage of utilizing both tagging procedures is that the 13mer TCM tag is far smaller than GFP, so that any size-related effects of protein tagging could be controlled for by this approach. Moreover, by imaging live cells, we avoided the artefacts that are often associated with microscopy of fixed cells. We next investigated whether this apparent segregation was maintained after cells have undergone the diauxic growth shift from glucose fermentation to ethanol oxidation. It is important to note that we imaged cells prior to the stationary phase since, by definition, in this latter state large numbers of cells are dying (Supplementary Figure S1 ). We observed the previously reported (15) progressive migration of Dhh1 and Pat1 into P bodies in response to the diauxic shift, although not all of the intracellular Dhh1 and Pat1 locates to the P bodies (Supplementary Figure S2 shows 3D projections from serial Z-axis images). However, we also observed that Dhh1 and Pat1 colocalize more extensively with ribosomes downstream of the diauxic shift; this is again illustrated by single Z-section images in Figure 1C . In the merged single section images, the overlap between the GFP-and TCM-tagged proteins is readily identified as yellow patches in the cells. Again, switching the tags between ribosomal subunits and the proteins under study did not alter the observed respective subcellular distributions (Supplementary Figure S3 shows single Z-section images). We also observed that eIF4A, eIF4E, eEF3 and eRF1 remain relatively evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and demonstrate only very limited co-localization with Dhh1 and Pat1 in both exponential growth and in the ethanol respiration phase (Supplementary Figures S4 and S5 show single Z-section fluorescence images). It has previously been reported that eIF4E, eIF4G and Pab1 are found in P bodies (24) and also in what are believed to be distinct bodies that form upon prolonged glucose depletion (EGP bodies, 25) . The shift in distribution of Dhh1 and Pat1 that we have observed evidently allows these proteins to share the subcellular regions in which most of the ribosome pool resides. DAPI staining was used to locate the positions of the nuclei in glucose-fermenting exponentially growing cells and in cells that have undergone the diauxic shift (Supplementary Figure S6) , revealing that at least 90% of the Dhh1 and Pat1 TCM-tag fusions, labelled with ReAsH, are not in the nucleus. Visual assessment of the subcellular distributions of proteins and complexes can be misleading, and we therefore performed quantitative fluorescence intensity analysis of the distribution of Dhh1/Pat1, ribosomes and translation factors throughout individual yeast cells. Cells were imaged in three dimensions, whereby a minimum of 50 serial sections were collected at 0.1-micron intervals and, once deconvolved, the Manders Intersection coefficients (i) were calculated for each tagged protein combination (e.g. Dhh1-TCM and Rpl25-GFP, Pat1-TCM and Rps2-GFP etc.) in either exponential growth or subsequent to the diauxic shift. These analyses allow the degree of intersection/overlap of the red (TCM-ReAsH) signal with the green (GFP) signal to be displayed graphically (Figure 2 ). These 3D, whole-cell distribution analyses reveal that during exponential growth the majority of Dhh1 and Pat1 ($75-80% of the imaged signal) is segregated from ribosomal subunits and translation factors. Upon diauxic growth shift, Dhh1 and Pat1 distribution relative to ribosomes undergoes a striking reorganization and the majority of Dhh1 and Pat1, presumably in the context of P-bodies ( Figure 1C) , intersects with ribosomal proteins. Interestingly, this growth-phase-specific differential distribution is not mirrored to the same extent when comparing Dhh1/Pat1 and translation factors. However, Dhh1 and Pat1 do show a small relative increase in signal overlap with several factors after the diauxic shift (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S4) . The observed co-localization does not tell us whether Dhh1 and Pat1 associate with particular subclasses of ribosomes, and we therefore investigated whether the chromosomally encoded TCM fusions become associated with actively translating, or non-translating, ribosomes under these conditions. Western blotting of fractions generated by sucrose gradient fractionation of cell extracts revealed that Dhh1 and Pat1 are not present in the polysomal fractions during exponential growth, but do appear in the polysomal fractions when cells undergo the diauxic shift ( Figure 3B ). That Pat1 is limited to monosomal fractions in polysomal gradients prepared from exponentially growing cells was also observed previously (5) . The observed co-fractionation effects might conceivably have been attributable to Dhh1 and Pat1 being incorporated into P bodies that run in the same fractions as polysomes. We therefore performed two types of control experiment ( Figure 3C ). The addition of puromycin to inhibit translation drastically reduced the content of polysomes in the higher mass fractions and also shifted the distribution of Dhh1 and Pat1 back into the lower mass fractions, just as would be expected if these two proteins are associated with polysomal complexes. Similarly, the addition of RNase A, which cleaves single-stranded RNA 3 0 of C and U residues, led to both the collapse of polysomes and the redistribution of Dhh1 and Pat1 into the lower mass monosomal and ribonucleoprotein fractions. Overall, these data suggest that the co-localization observed in diauxic growthshifted cells reflects genuine association between Dhh1, Pat1 and translationally active polysome complexes.
