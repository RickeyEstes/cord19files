Squalene-containing adjuvants enhance EBOV VLP-induced total and functional antibody titers VLPs are an effective platform for the display of antigens in their native conformation. 30, 31 To assess their ability for induction of high functional antibody titers, we produced EBOV VLPs by cotransfecting human embyonic kidney-293 (HEK-293) cells with plasmids encoding for the EBOV Zaire strain Mayinga matrix protein (VP40) and the full-length membrane-anchored glycoprotein (GP). 31 After 48 h, the supernatant was harvested, purified, and concentrated via ultracentrifugation. The resulting EBOV VLP preparation contained two major proteins migrating in Coomassie-stained gels at 130 kDa and around 40 kDa (Fig. 1a) . Western blot analysis identified the distinct band at 130 kDa as EBOV-GP1, the large cleavage fragment of EBOV-GP, 31, 32 and two bands between 35 and 55 kDa as two isoforms of EBOV-VP40 due to a second upstream in-frame start codon 33 (Fig. 1b) . To evaluate the effect of adjuvants on total and functional antibody responses, groups of mice were immunized intramuscularly with 10 μg EBOV VLP alone, or in combination with the squalene-containing water-in-oil Sigma adjuvant, the oil-in-water TiterMax adjuvant, or 2% Alhydrogel, all of which are routinely used for animal immunizations, and boosted 2 and 4 weeks later. Serum was collected 2 weeks after each immunization and kinetics of total and neutralizing antibody responses were followed. First antibodies against EBOV-GP were detected after 2 weeks, with approximately 10-fold higher titers in the Sigma and TiterMax adjuvant groups. The titers in all groups gradually increased over the course of the immunizations, but while the final titers induced by non-adjuvanted EBOV VLPs were similar to those in the Alhydrogel-adjuvanted and TiterMax-adjuvanted groups, Sigma adjuvant resulted in 10-fold higher final titers (Fig. 1c) . Neutralizing antibody titers were determined by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) with the recombinant VSV Fig. 1 Ebola VLP production and antibody response kinetics. a, b VLP preparations analyzed after transfection of HEK-293 cells, harvest of the VLP-containing supernatant, purification, and concentration by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion. Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and proteins were a stained with Coomassie blue or b transferred to PVDF membranes. Blots were stained with a polyclonal goat antiserum against EBOV. Lane 1: 10 µg VLP sample containing Ebola VP40 and GP; lane 2: 10 µg VLP sample containing only Ebola VP40; and lane 3: 10 µl negative control (not transfected). All blots were derived from the same experiment and were processed in parallel. c, d Mice were immunized i.m. with 10 µg of VLPs alone or in combination with either Sigma Adjuvant System, TiterMax Gold, or Alhydrogel, and boosted 2 and 4 weeks after the first immunization. Final serum samples were collected 2 weeks after the second boost. The total antibody response against recombinant EBOV-GP c and neutralizing antibody response against VSVΔG/EBOV-GP d are shown. Antibodies against EBOV-GP are reported as reciprocal serum endpoint titers using IPMA and neutralizing antibodies were assessed by the 50% serum neutralization capacity (PRNT 50 ). Symbols represent the mean of each group (n = 3), and error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. The Y-axis begins at the detection limit of the respective assays. Statistical significance is indicated by *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 that expresses the GP of the closely related EBOV Zaire strain Kikwit (VSVΔG/EBOV-GP). 34 First neutralizing antibodies were detected after the second immunization, but a robust increase was only observed in the adjuvanted groups, with a 5-fold increase in the TiterMax-adjuvanted and Alhydrogel-adjuvanted groups and a 20-fold increase in the Sigma adjuvant group (Fig.  1d ), leading us to choose Sigma adjuvant for all further experiments. Induction of robust neutralizing antibody titers requires several immunizations VLPs lack the ability for de novo protein production. To determine the importance of this aspect for the induction of functional antibodies, we compared adjuvanted EBOV VLPs with vector vaccines based on the replication-deficient modified vaccinia Ankara virus (MVA) that expresses either the GP protein of the Zaire EBOV Guéckédou strain alone or in combination with VP40 (unpublished data), and the replication-competent VSVΔG/EBOV-GP. 34 Due to the around 80% amino acid sequence identity and strong structural and functional conservation among Zaire EBOV-GP proteins, the induced immune responses are cross-reactive within the species. 35, 36 As before, mice were immunized three times in 2-week intervals. Total antibody titers against EBOV-GP increased rapidly after initial immunization in all groups, but in contrast to the adjuvanted EBOV VLPs and the VSVΔG/EBOV-GP, there was no further increase after the third immunization with the MVA-based viral vectors (Fig. 2a) . Neutralizing antibodies were detected in MVA/EBOV-GP-immunized groups after the first and MVA/EBOV-VP40/GP-immunized groups after the second immunization and slightly increased to yield final titers around 10 (Fig.  2b ). The first neutralizing antibodies in VSVΔG/EBOV-GP animals were also detected after the first immunization with final titers reaching 40 (Fig. 2b) . Even though the neutralizing antibodies were again only detected after the first boost in the group immunized with adjuvanted EBOV VLPs, titers ultimately reached levels around 100 (Fig. 2b) , illustrating that de novo protein expression is not required for efficient induction of functional antibodies. Immunization with adjuvanted EBOV VLPs induces high neutralizing antibody titers in rabbits To generate larger volume of antisera for optimization of the purification process and to assess the scalability of antisera production, we repeated the immunization protocol in rabbits. Animals were immunized with the adjuvanted EBOV VLPs, MVA/ EBOV-GP, or VSVΔG/EBOV-GP, and boosted 2 and 4 weeks later. Serum was collected 1 week after the second boost. Total anti-EBOV-GP antibody titers (Table 1 , bottom row) and neutralizing antibody levels against VSVΔG/EBOV-GP (Table 2, bottom row) were slightly higher than the titers seen in mice, validating the immunization scheme in a different species. To put the titers obtained after immunization of rabbits in a clinically relevant context, total anti-EBOV antibodies were quantified in a validated whole-virion EBOV antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), used to assess the antibody responses in survivors of EBOV virus disease during the West African outbreak, 37 as well as a virus neutralization assay (VNT) with EBOV Zaire strain Mayinga used to assess antibody responses in VSVΔG/EBOV-GP vaccinated volunteers using the same assay. 38 The optical density (OD) values of rabbit sera tested in the validated whole-virion EBOV ELISA ranged from 3.5 to 4.1 and were thus comparable to high-titer convalescent sera after patients had cleared the virus. 37 Endpoint titrations revealed comparable total antibody titers against EBOV and EBOV-GP ( Table 1 ). The neutralizing antibody titers assessed in VNT with EBOV were for MVA/EBOV-GP rabbit sera more than 10-fold and for VSVΔG/EBOV-GP and VLP rabbit sera more than 75-fold higher than the average geometric mean neutralizing endpoint titers of Fig. 2 Comparison of total and neutralizing antibody responses against EBOV-GP induced in mice using different immunization approaches. Animals were immunized i.m. with 2 × 10 5 PFU VSVΔG/EBOV-GP, 1.5 × 10 8 FFU of either MVA/EBOV-VP40/GP or MVA/EBOV-GP, or 10 µg of EBOV VLPs in combination with Sigma adjuvant, and boosted 2 and 4 weeks later before final serum was collected 2 weeks after the second boost. The total antibody response against recombinant EBOV-GP a and neutralizing antibody response against VSVΔG/EBOV-GP b are shown. Antibodies against EBOV-GP are reported as reciprocal serum endpoint titers using IPMA and neutralizing antibodies were assessed by the 50% serum neutralization capacity (PRNT 50 ). Symbols represent the mean of each group (n = 3), and error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. The Y-axis begins at the detection limit of the respective assays.

Comparison of total antibody responses against EBOV and EBOV-GP induced in rabbits using different antigen expression approaches 16 15 16 Generation of therapeutic antisera for emerging viraly R Schmidt et al. 16 (2 4 ) or 11 (2 3.5 ) in vaccines at day 28 or 180 ( Table 2 ), indicating that titers of the rabbit hyperimmune sera are within the therapeutic range. 38 While more systematic bridging studies would be required to directly correlate our in-house with the official diagnostic assays, the similar relative proportions of the titers induced by the different immunization platforms indicates their suitability for initial analyses. VLP-based antisera production is applicable to other emerging viral infections Immunization with recombinant viruses or VLPs containing the NiV fusion (F) and attachment (G) surface GPs is sufficient to elicit a protective immune response, 20, 39, 40 and there is considerable cross-reactivity with different NiV and even Hendra virus strains. 41 To evaluate the applicability of the VLP-based immunization approach for the production of high-titer antisera against other emerging viruses, NiV VLPs were generated by co-transfecting HEK-293T cells with plasmids encoding the NiV matrix protein (M) in combination with either the F or G protein of the NiV Malaysia strain. 42 After 48 h, supernatant was harvested, purified and concentrated via ultracentrifugation. The resulting NiV-M/G and NiV-M/F VLP preparations showed no distinct bands migrating in Coomassie-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels ( Fig. 3a ), but bands corresponding to NiV-M (44 kDa), NiV-G (68 kDa), and two bands representing uncleaved NiV-F 0 and cleaved NiV-F 1 (approximately 60 and 48 kDa, respectively) could be readily detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3b) . 43 To assess the total and functional antibody responses induced by immunization with the respective NiV GP, two rabbits were immunized intramuscularly with 300 μg NiV-M/F or NiV-M/G VLPs in combination with the Sigma adjuvant. Animals were boosted 3 and 5 weeks later and serum was collected before each immunization and 2 weeks after the second boost to follow the kinetics of the total and neutralizing antibody responses. Antibodies against NiV-F in rabbits immunized with NiV-M/F VLPs were detected after the first immunization, while induction of antibodies against NiV-G required two immunizations with NiV-M/G VLPs (Fig. 3c) . Subsequent immunizations increased total antibody titers, and titers of NiV-F antibodies ultimately reached levels approximately two times higher than NiV-G antibodies (Fig.  3c) . Consistent with these findings, neutralizing antibody titers against the Malaysia strain were found in the NiV-M/F VLP group after the first immunization, while neutralizing antibodies against NiV-M/G were first detected after the second immunization, and these titers increased in both groups of animals after the third and fourth immunizations (Fig. 3d) . The neutralizing titers against the NiV-F and NiV-G glycoproteins (approx. 3000) were well above the level of neutralizing activity (>160 neutralizing units/mL) that protects against lethal NiV challenge in passive transfer studies, 19, 20 which suggests that our rabbit anti-NiV GP sera would also provide a similar degree of protection. Multi-step purification process yields IgG and F(ab′) 2 samples with high recovery of neutralizing activity Acute and delayed adverse reactions to antisera, such as anaphylactic shock and serum sickness, are caused by the immunogenicity of xenogenic serum proteins or complement activation by the Fc portion of whole IgG preparations, respectively. 44 To minimize the risk of unwanted side effects, we established a multi-step purification and concentration procedure using sera from EBOV VLP-immunized rabbits. First, serum proteins were precipitated in a two-step precipitation using 0.864 and 1.728 M ammonium sulfate followed by IgG affinity chromatography using Protein A. Next, IgG was modified by a pepsin digestion to remove the Fc portion to generate F(ab′) 2 preparations (Fig. 4a) . To accurately compare antibody titers over the course of the purification process, titers are expressed relative to the same volume for all samples. The purification and concentration is illustrated on a Coomassie-stained non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel loaded with the same protein concentration of initial serum, purification intermediates after precipitation, and the IgG and F(ab′) 2 preparations (Fig. 4b) . After ammonium sulfate precipitation, more than 90%, and even after subsequent IgG affinity purification more than 80% of neutralization activity were recovered (Fig. 4c) . Pepsin digest led to around 50% loss of neutralization activity in F(ab′) 2 preparations compared to unmodified serum, indicating that the multi-step purification process results in high yield purified IgG preparations with only little loss of functional antibody titers, and F(ab′) 2 fragmentation with at least 50% recovery of functional activity. Comparable in vivo stability of homologous and xenogenic antibodies in mice Antibody half-life is an important efficacy determinant of passive immune therapy. To assess the antibody stability in a different species, mice were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with purified homologous mouse IgG, or heterologous rabbit IgG preparations. Doses were calculated based on total anti-EBOV-GP antibody titers (Fig. 4d) . The antibody levels in recipient mice remained stable over 9 days after injection regardless of the origin of the IgG, and treatment with a higher IgG dose resulted in increased detectable titers in the recipients (Fig. 4d) . Since F(ab′) 2 fragments reduce the incidence of adverse events due to the lack interaction with Fc receptors, they are increasingly used to treat snake envenomation. 45 However, they are associated with a shorter half-life, which may have a greater impact in the context of an amplifying virus than a single dose of venom. 29 To determine the stability of the heterologous rabbit F(ab′) 2 preparation, we injected mice intraperitoneally with different doses. In contrast to IgG, F(ab′) 2 fragments were only detected on the first day after transfer, even if the higher dose was used (Fig.  4d) , indicating that the longer half-life of IgG combined with its potential side effects may have to be weighed against the lower stability and reduced activity of F(ab′) 2 fragments.
