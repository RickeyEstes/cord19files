A total of 422 healthcare professionals completed the survey, resulting in a response rate 94.8 percent. More than 50% of the respondents were female. The majority of the respondents were in the age range between 31 and 40 years. In terms of experience, 50.23% of the respondents had at least 10 years during the study period. As a multi-ethnic country, the respondents' ethnicity was comprised of 33% Malay, 39% Chinese, and 26% Indians. Table 1 shows the statistical summary of the demographic details of the respondents. The mean scores presented in Tables 2 and 3 were obtained by calculating the total response for each item in the questionnaire and the total sample participated in each category. Table 2 presented the health care professionals' preparedness for a Zika outbreak. The data revealed that most of the respondents were prepared for the Zika outbreak. Yet, there were significant differences between healthcare professionals on some of the items asked in the questionnaire. The nurses found it difficult to access the research literature on Zika virus management, with a low mean score for this statement (0.31 ± 0.34), while general practitioners found it easy to access the literature with the highest mean score among the other groups (0.69 ± 0.31), with the significant value p = 0.03. Community Pharmacists felt that they have not participated in educational activities related to Zika virus preparedness on a consistent basis (continuing professional development, education classes, seminars, or conferences) with a low mean score (0.36 ± 0.31), whereas the general practitioners (0.61 ± 0.35) had the highest mean scores and felt they have participated in such activities on a regular basis p = 0.002. Community Pharmacists considered themselves, not prepared for the management of Zika virus, with a low mean score (0.35 ± 0.27), whereas the general practitioners in this study considered themselves prepared for the management of Zika virus with the highest mean score (0.72 ± 0.27) p = 0.002. Table 3 presents the health care professionals' perceived responses to the Zika outbreak. The data revealed that most of the respondents perceived postive responses towards theie preparedness for the Zika outbreak. Yet, there were significant differences found between health care professionals' perceived response towards Zika outbreak on some of the items asked in the questionnaire. Community pharmacists were not confident in identifying the signs and symptoms of Zika virus (0.46 ± 0.44) and providing patient education on the Zika virus (0.71 ± 0.48), with low mean scores for these statements p = 0.05. However, the general practitioners had highest mean scores for these statements. Sub-group one-way analysis of variance tests (Table 4 ) did not reveal any significant differences in mean scores for preparedness among the health care professionals regarding age, gender, profession, and ethnicity. However, there was a significant difference in mean scores for preparedness by level of experience among healthcare professionals. Tukey's post hoc test revealed that among the experience level of >5 to 10 years, the general practitioners mean score 14.52 ± 3.12 was significantly higher than those of the other healthcare professionals; nurses 14.21 ± 3.63 (p = 0.04) and pharmacists 13.87 ± 3.42 (p = 0.03). Table 4 . Differences in preparedness among healthcare professionals by demographic profile. Data expressed are total mean scores ± standard deviation (SD). One-way ANOVA was used. a = p < 0.05 for the difference between general practitioners and pharmacists (one-way ANOVA with the Tukey's post hoc test). b = p < 0.05 for the difference between general practitioners and nurses (one-way ANOVA with the Tukey's post hoc test).
