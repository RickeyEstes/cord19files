Of the 16 nasopharyngeal specimens, four showed cytopathic effect in only one cell line, MDCK. Isolated viruses were identified as influenza of type A by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies of the Respiratory Panel 1 Viral Screening and Identification Kit, (Chemicon Internantional). Following the subtype characterization by the hemagglutination inhibition test, antiserum provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) was used. Isolated viruses were sent to the Influenza Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-Atlanta, GA-for further antigenic and genetic analysis. Influenza viruses were isolated in the respiratory secretions from four patients with recent travel history to Hong Kong, Pequiem, Europe and Taiwan, respectively. Three isolated viruses were characterized as A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) and one as A/New Caledonia/ 20/99 (H1N2). Among them, a mixed infection with influenza virus of type B from a 71year-old woman from Taiwan was observed. In addition, further studies are currently being completed to help characterize a virus isolated from Canada of a suspected case and a microorganism distinguished from a virus, which has been isolated from four suspected cases of SARS.
