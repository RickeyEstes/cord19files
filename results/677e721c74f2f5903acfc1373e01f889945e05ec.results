During January 1998, NEC developed in 8 of the 35 neonates admitted to the NICU during that month ( Figure  1 ). All became ill between January 2 and January 16, 1998. Analysis of the temporal distribution of cases by day showed a peak of 3 cases presenting on January 7, 1998, with 5 single cases presenting at irregular intervals between January 2 and January 16, 1998 (data not shown). The relative risk of NEC developing in January 1998 compared with the preceding 12 months was 10.4 (95% CI, 4.0-27.0; P Ͻ .0001). The January 1998 rate of 23 NEC cases/100 NICU admissions would also exceed the monthly rate for the following 11 months. No additional cases of NEC were identified after January 17-the date control measures were implemented-although new patients continued to be admitted to the unit. Control measures included the cohorting of staff and infants, the mandatory donning of gowns and gloves when providing any care to newborns in the NICU, and the encouraging of hand washing. Hand washing was further facilitated in the NICU by the later replacement of antiquated sinks. Additionally, staff, parents, and visitors were asked to avoid coming to the NICU when they had symptoms of vomiting or diarrhea and to keep out until 72 hours had passed after resolution of symptoms. The 8 cases of NEC appeared to be clustered in space ( Figure 2 ). Six affected infants were housed in isolettes or incubators located at the end of the unit, which was farthest from the entry. Affected newborns were geographically clustered to a degree greater than expected by chance alone (Grimson test for spatial clustering; P ϭ .01). Newborns in adjacent isolettes or incubators tended to be cared for by the same staff member, because individual nursing assignments usually included patients in close physical proximity. To fairly distribute the work load of nursing staff in the unit, newborns requiring more intensive nursing care were distributed evenly throughout the NICU. The bed assignment method was stable with time, except for active cohorting after the diagnosis of NEC. The case-control study demonstrated significant differences between the 8 cases and 25 control subjects (Table I) . Infants in whom NEC developed were a median of 21 days old at illness onset (range, 5-38 days). They were born at significantly younger gestational ages, had lower birth weights, and had lower Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes of life compared with control subjects. Results of statistical analyses are summarized in Table I . Newborns in whom NEC developed had received antibiotics longer than control subjects, although no specific antibiotic was associated with the occurrence of NEC. Although there was no statistical difference in the frequency of administration of granulocyte colony stimulating factor, pressor agents, or corticosteroids in the period before illness onset in cases and during their entire NICU stay in control subjects, newborns in whom NEC developed were more likely than control subjects to have received histamine 2 blocking agents, indomethacin, surfactant, and caffeine. Cases also were more likely to have been diagnosed with hyaline membrane disease and to have required intubation, although the duration of intubation was similar in cases and control subjects. Diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus was similar in both groups. Cases were more likely to have had catheterization of the umbilical artery and were older at the time of first enteral feeding. Although no newborn in whom NEC developed was breastfed, a protective effect of breastmilk could not be assessed because few control newborns were fed breastmilk (Ϸ 20%). No deaths occurred in newborns in whom NEC did not develop. Evaluation of contact between newborns and medical staff showed that cases had more contact with 3 NICU staff members (identified here as A, B, and C) than control subjects. Caregiver B, who was strongly associated with cases, recalled having vomiting and diarrhea around the time of the outbreak and provided care while ill. Of the 7 newborns in whom NEC developed in whose medical records Caregiver B made notations, 3 were documented within 7 days of onset of illness. Caregiver C made notations in all 6 of the medical records of cases in the 7 days before illness onset. No single medical care provider was found to have contact documented in the medical records with all the cases, although caregiver A was a physician who presumably had contact with all newborns in the NICU on a daily basis. This physician's notations in the medical records of cases appeared to indicate an increased level of attention devoted to specific infants. Bacterial, parasitic, and Clostridium difficile toxin assays on stool samples from case newborns yielded no evidence of pathogens. General viral cultures and rotavirus antigen en- zyme immunoassay results were also negative. Six stool samples from cases were available for further analysis. Round, structured, 710-Angstrom particles morphologically compatible with a calicivirus were observed through electron microscopy of all 6 specimens. The presence of NoV in 4 of the stool specimens was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Southern hybridization in 3 of the 4 specimens confirmed the presence of NoV; the fourth specimen was of a volume too small for further analysis. The 2 samples that tested negative with RT-PCR were also of very small volume. We compared the clinical characteristics on presentation of the 8 cases presenting during the outbreak (epidemic cases) and 11 cases that had occurred sporadically in the preceding 7 months (endemic cases; Table II ). Epidemic cases differed from endemic cases only in 1 laboratory characteristic: they had significantly lower percent of neutrophil band forms in peripheral leukocyte counts, although the ranges overlapped. Need for surgical intervention and rate of death did not differ in the 2 groups. Results of statistical analyses are summarized in Table II .
