We enrolled 38 women and 18 men with a median age of 42 years (range: 25-64); 52 (93%) were health care workers and 75% had been vaccinated in the previous year. Fortyfour participants were randomized to prophylaxis and 12 to vaccine. Two participants, both in the prophylaxis group and in health care workers, dropped out before starting antiviral prophylaxis and are not included in the remaining analyses. Demographic characteristics of participants are 15 Of the 42 participants who started oseltamivir prophylaxis, 4 (10%) discontinued before 13 weeks owing to adverse effect, including: nausea (week 1), nausea and malaise (week 3), sleep disturbances (week 4) and headache (week 11). Thirty-nine of 42 participants (95%) reported taking six or seven capsules per week for the first 8 weeks; by week 12, 34 (81%) reported continuing to miss no more than one capsule per week. At week 13, six (16%) of the 38 participants taking oseltamivir elected to discontinue prophylaxis; two requested vaccination. One of 12 people in the vaccine group elected to start oseltamivir. Thus, 33 participants were receiving prophylaxis as of week 14. By week 16, 26 (79%) of these participants reported taking six or seven capsules per week; by week 20, only 13 (33%) were continuing to report this level of adherence. Study participants took oseltamivir prophylaxis for 5-155 days (median 121) and took a median of 87AE5 capsules per 100 person-days (range 66-100). On average, adherence in those reporting taking any of the medication was higher within the first 10 weeks than in the latter 10 weeks of the study (86 versus 75 pills per 100 person-days of follow-up; P = 0AE001). At the exit interview, self-rated adherence to prophylaxis ranged from 70% to 100% (median 96AE5%). There were no significant differences between self-reported adherence and adherence as measured by pill counts or e-cap records. No changes in serum hepatic transaminases were documented for participants taking oseltamivir. Seventy respiratory illness episodes were reported by 36 of the 54 participants, with zero to seven illnesses reported per person (median 1). Fifty-two NP swabs were submitted by 32 participants, with seven yielding influenza and nine yielding other respiratory viruses ( Table 2) . Serologic testing confirmed influenza in all seven participants with positive NP swabs, and in an additional five participants. Of these five, four reported an episode of acute respiratory illness for which an NP swab was not submitted during the interval between the two blood samples with seroconversion. The acute respiratory illness rate was 6AE4 per 1000 person-days, the influenza infection rate was 1AE9 per 1000 person-days, and the infection rate owing to other respiratory viruses was 0AE6 illnesses per 1000 person-days. Median symptom duration of acute respiratory illness was 6 days (range 1-35). Illness duration was 4 days (range 2-17) in cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza (n = 7), 8AE5 days (range 1-15) in cases of laboratory-confirmed illness owing to other respiratory viruses and 2 days (range 1-13) in those who reported an illness but did not submit a NP swab (P = 0AE012). Participants reported working on 240 of 284 (85%) regularly scheduled work days during their acute respiratory illness, and, on average, each participant missed 0AE6 days of work per illness episode. Cumulatively, a total of 4AE0 working days per 1000 person-days were lost owing to acute respiratory illnesses. Of 240 days worked during acute respiratory illness, 70 (29%) were days for which employees reported feeling miserable but being too busy to stay home. There was no association between the likelihood of working while ill and the type of virus detected, gender, age, average hours worked per week or profession. Ten of 42 (24%; 95% CI 12AE8, 38AE3) participants in the oseltamivir group and 2 of 12 (17%; 95% CI 2AE4, 48AE4) participants in the vaccine group (P = 0AE71) were infected with influenza. Five of the ten influenza infections in participants in the oseltamivir group occurred before prophylaxis was initiated (Table 2) . No demographic or clinical factors were found to be associated with infection with influenza in this pilot study.
