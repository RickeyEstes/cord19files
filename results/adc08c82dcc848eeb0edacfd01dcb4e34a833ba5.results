Information obtained by interviewing the owners of the four herds before the study started is presented in Table 1 . The calves were usually kept with their dam for up to 24 h and then moved to individual pens or huts (two herds had pens, one had huts, and one had both pens and huts) where they were kept for two to four weeks until moved and mixed with other calves in group pens or huts. In all four herds the calf diarrhea problems had been ongoing for several years and the farmers estimated the morbidity among 0-60 day old calves to be 33-100% over the last six months. Caretakers gave colostrum manually in all herds except in herd four in which some of the calves suckled their first colostrum. In total, 422 calves were born during the study period, of which 20 were excluded either because the farmers' records were not complete or because the pen had not been kept empty for 24 h before the calf was introduced. Thus 402 calves were finally included in the study. Of these, 196 and 206 were kept in hydrated lime disinfected pens and control pens, respectively. The farmers' recordings are presented in Table 2 . Overall, the farmers detected diarrhea in 214 (53%) of the calves, with similar proportions in experimental and control pens. The mean age when diarrhea was first seen was 8.3 days (range 1-23 days) and it lasted for 3.9 days on average (median 3 days). 'Age at diarrhea onset' was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in experimental pens than in control pens, 9.0 days and 7.6 days, respectively,. There was no significant difference between calves kept in experimental and control pens for the variables 'Presence of diarrhea', 'Days with diarrhea', or 'Severity' (Table 2; Appendix Table I) . Veterinarians examined 156 calves, i.e. all calves that were up to four weeks old at the time of the visits. There was no significant difference in the veterinary registrations regarding either 'General appearance', 'Dehydration', or 'Faecal consistency' between calves kept in experimental pens or control pens (Appendix Table II ). Body condition was scored for 55 calves at two to four weeks of age and from 54 calves at six to eight weeks of age. Mean scores for calves from experimental and control pens respectively were 3.0 (range: 2.0-4.0) and 2.9 (range: 2.0-4.0) at two to four weeks and 3.1 (range: 2.5-4.0) and 2.9 (range: 2.0-3.5) at six to eight weeks. The six to eight week old calves kept in experimental pens had a significantly higher body condition score (p = 0.0069) than calves in control pens, but the difference between the groups in the younger calves was not significant (Appendix Table III ). Faecal samples were collected from 95 calves. Cryptosporidium positive samples were found at all samplings in all four herds. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in 79 (83%) samples and oocyst counts were 50-126 Ã— 10 6 OPG, with a median of 52,350 OPG in the positive samples. There was no difference between experimental or control pens in either the variables 'Oocyst concentration' or 'Oocyst level > 45,000 OPG' (Table 3; Appendix Table IV) . When the Cryptosporidium positive samples from the first and fourth samplings (n = 52) were analysed by molecular biology methods, the species could be determined in 49 samples. C. parvum was the dominant species, found in 45 samples. C. bovis was found in four samples. Two different C. parvum subtypes were found; IIaA16G1R1b in three herds, and IIaA16G1R1b_variant in one herd (Table 4 ). Only one subtype was found in each herd. Rotavirus was found in all the herds and in pools from both experimental and control calves. In total, 32 pools (8 from each herd) were analysed and rotavirus was found in 11 (34%) of them. Coronavirus was not found in any pool. The mean serum protein value was 58.4 g/l (range 46-70 g/l), with no significant differences between the first and fourth visits (59.3 and 56.1, p = 0.244) or between herds (p = 0.290).
