DiUb Activity-Based Probe and diUb-AMC Substrate Synthesis To identify and study DUBs with both S1 and S2 Ub-binding pockets, we designed a set of non-hydrolyzable diUb-based active site-directed probes that carry a reactive group (warhead) at the C terminus of the proximal Ub moiety . We decided to use a propargylamide (PA) warhead as it was found to be an excellent warhead to target DUBs . It provides the broadest reactivity of all Ub-based probes that have been generated so far, and has little reactivity toward enzymes in the Ub conjugation system. Moreover, the stability of the alkyne, commonly used in bio-orthogonal cycloaddition reactions, allows for complex synthetic strategies due to its relative inertness compared with other frequently used warheads. The individual Ub molecules are coupled via a non-hydrolyzable triazole linkage as a peptide bond isostere, preventing unwanted proteolytic cleavage between the two Ub moieties. The triazole linkage, formed by the copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction between propargylamide and azido-ornithine, is a good isostere of the native glycine-Îµ-lysine isopeptide bond ( Figure 2A ). Previously, it was shown that triazole-based polyUb chains and activity-based probes are well tolerated as isopeptide mimics (Dresselhaus et al., 2013; McGouran et al., 2013; Schneider et al., 2014; Weikart et al., 2012) . To generate these S1-S2 site-targeting probes, we used a solid-phase peptide-synthesis-based protocol for the linear synthesis of full-length Ub on a chlorotrityl resin . We first cleaved the Ub 1-75 precursor from the resin using 20% hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), which exposed the C-terminal carboxylic acid. The C terminus was then activated and coupled to PA followed by coupling of TAMRA to the N terminus (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Subsequently, the Ub molecule was globally deprotected with strong acid and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) ( Figure 2B ; 1). Using a similar protocol, the proximal Ub reaction partners, equipped with an azidoornithine mutation at any of the seven lysine positions were synthesized as Ub 1-74 . After liberating the C terminus, the thioester was introduced by coupling of methyl-3-(glycylthio)-propionate. Global deprotection and RP-HPLC purification yielded the thioester precursors ( Figure 2B ; 2a-g). The alkyne and azide precursors were coupled in a CuAAC reaction, and subsequently the C-terminal thioesters were converted into the desired PA probe by direct substitution using propargylamine. RP-HPLC purification and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) were conducted yielding seven TAMRA-diUb-PA probes (Figure 2A ; 3a-g). In addition to covalently binding diUb-based PA probes, diUb-fluorogenic substrates were designed to enable further validation of the results obtained with the covalent probes. Ub-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Ub-AMC) has been used widely to determine DUB activity (Dang et al., 1998) (B) Schematic representation of the key CuAAC reaction to generate non-hydrolyzable diUb activity-based probes 3.

AMC cleavage from Ub liberates fluorescence, and this is therefore a direct measure for DUB activity. DiUb-AMC substrates were generated by equipping the distal Ub molecule with a C-terminal PA moiety through HFIP-mediated local deprotection followed by coupling of propargylamine, global deprotection, and RP-HPLC purification ( Figure 2C ; 4). The proximal Ub moiety carrying an azido-ornithine mutation at any of the seven desired positions was prepared as Ub 1-75 and coupled to glycyl-AMC after HFIP treatment. After strong acid treatment and purification, we obtained the desired series of azide precursors ( Figure 2C ; 5a-g). In a CuAAC reaction, the two Ub synthons were coupled and RP-HPLC followed by SEC yielded the complete panel of seven non-hydrolyzable diUb-AMC substrates ( Figure 2C ; 6a-g).
