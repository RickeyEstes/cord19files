Seventy-four NP swab specimens were obtained from 60 patients 49 to 95 years of age. There was a positive result from any of the test methods in 16 specimens (22%) from 15 patients. The distribution of positive results by patient is shown in Table 1 . All specimens were tested by RVP (direct specimen), DFA, and culture. All but 2 specimens were tested by RVP on 24-h culture supernatant. Thirty-one specimens also underwent rapid antigen testing for RSV and influenza A and B. The distribution of positive results by type of respiratory virus is summarized in Table 2 . For the pediatric comparison group (patient ages 8 month to 17 years), 10 (50%) of 20 samples were positive by direct specimen RVP.
