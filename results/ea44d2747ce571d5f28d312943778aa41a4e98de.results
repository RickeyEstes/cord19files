For the determination of rubella antibodies, dilutions of a positive serum with a titer of 1 : 128 in the HI test were tested in both the HI and the HIG test. The HIG test was performed using 2 different techniques of coupling the virus to the erythrocytes, by hemagglutination and by chemical linkage with reagents in different concentrations. Table I shows that the coupling techniques used produced no improvement in sensitivity. Both with and without chemical linkage, the edge of the hemolysis ring was sharp, allowing exact measurement of diameters. With high concentrations of TOD, chromic chloride and cyanuric chloride, spontaneous hemolysis occurred, whereas with glutaraldehyde in high concentration, no zones of hemolysis were detectable. In different sucrose gradient fractions of a serum positive for rubella-specific IgM, no antibodies of IgM class could be detected in the HIG test by either method of attachment (Fig. 1) . For determination of influenza antibodies the HIG test was carried out with 2 different kinds of antigen, allantoic fluid and Tween-ether hemagglutinin. In addition, the erythrocytes were treated with potassium periodate. The results with allantoic fluid as antigen are shown in Table II . With TOD, chromic chloride and periodate the sensitivity is increased and HI titers of 1 : 8 were detectable by the HIG test. With cyanuric chloride and glutaraldehyde as coupling reagents no improvement was seen. With Tween-ether treated hemagglutinin as viral antigen, without chemical linkage no zones of hemolysis were seen in the plates. After addition of TOD, chromic chloride and potassium periodate sharp zones occurred which had the same diameters as the zones of hemolysis obtained with allantoic fluid as antigen (Table  III) . a 0 = no hemolysis.
