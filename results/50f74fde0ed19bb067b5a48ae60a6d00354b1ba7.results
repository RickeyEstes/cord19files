Cell lines used in this study were manufactured and thoroughly characterized under GMP conditions according to guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization Topic Q5 (ICH Q5) [50] . The characterization of MRC-5 and Vero cells includes confirmation of cell line identity and the assessment of purity and freedom from fungi and bacteria (sterility), as well as mycoplasma and adventitious viruses testing. The human diploid cell line MRC-5 demonstrated cytopathic effects (CPE) when inoculated with 1000, 100, 10 and 1 TCID 50 of ZIKV MR766, an African lineage virus (Fig. 1a , b and Table 1 ). The structural changes to host cell morphology, CPE in the form of retarded cell growth and extensive cell rounding and lysis by ZIKV were clearly observed. Inoculation of MRC-5 with 1000 TCID 50 of ZIKV MR766 was reported in the majority of wells between days 6 and 10 post inoculation (pi) with the mean appearance of CPE on day 8. MRC-5 cells demonstrated early signs of CPE following inoculation with 100 TCID 50 ZIKV MR766 at 6 days post infection (p.i.), and CPE was observed in all wells at day 14 p.i. with the mean appearance of CPE at day 10. When inoculated with 10 TCID 50 of ZIKV MR766, CPE was reported between days 14 and 17 p.i. with the mean appearance at day 13. Inoculation with 1 TCID 50 ZIKV MR766 reported CPE in 33 % of wells on day 14 and in 50 % of wells on day 28 ( Table 4 ). The inoculation of the Brazilian isolate (Asian lineage) ZIKV PE243 [51] at levels of 1000, 100, 10 and 1 TCID 50 on the MRC-5 detector cell line elicited CPE in 67, 44-27 and 11 % of wells, respectively, during a 14-day in vitro assay (Tables 2 and 4 , Fig. 3a , b). The mean appearance of CPE for 1000 and 100 TCID 50 was at days 12 and 14 p.i. On day 14, supernatant from MRC-5 was inoculated onto a subconfluent monolayer of MRC-5 and CPE was observed in 67, 75, 42 and 17 % of wells, respectively, at day 28. CPE in Vero C1008 and Vero CCL-81 cells was similar to that observed on MRC-5 cells and presented as structural changes to host cell morphology, retarded cell growth and extensive cell rounding, detachment and lysis. Vero C1008 reported the presence of 1000 and 100 TCID 50 of ZIKV MR766 on all occasions at 14 days in vitro assay. The onset of CPE was observed as early as 3 days p.i. with the mean appearance of CPE on days 5 and 7 for 1000 and 100 TCID 50 , respectively. ZIKV MR766 at 10 and 1 TCID 50 elicited CPE in 67 and 56 % of Vero C1008 wells during 14 days of in vitro culture, with the mean appearance of CPE on days 8 and 9. Vero C1008 detected the presence of 1000,100, 10 and 1 TCID 50 of ZIKV MR766 in each well inoculated on all occasions during the 28-day in vitro assay (Tables 2 and 4 , Fig. 2e , f). Inoculation with 1000 and 100 TCID 50 of ZIKV PE243 elicited CPE in Vero C1008 wells on all occasions during the 14 days of in vitro assay, with the mean appearance of CPE on day 8. Vero C1008 detected the presence of 10 and 1 TCID 50 of ZIKV PE243 on 67 and 56 % occasions during the 14 days of in vitro assay, with the mean appearance of CPE for 10 TCID 50. reported on day 9. Inoculation with 1000, 100 and 10 TCID 50 ZIKV PE243 elicited CPE in Vero C1008 wells on all occasions during the 28 days of in vitro assay. Inoculation with 1 TCID 50 of ZIKV PE243 reported CPE in 83 % of wells on day 28 (Tables 2 and 4 (Tables 3 and 4 ). The mean appearance of CPE was reported on day 6 for 1000 TCID 50 inoculum, on day 7 for 100 TCID 50 and on day 8 for 10 and 1 TCID 50 . Vero CCL-81 detected 1000, 100 and 10 TCID 50 of ZIKV MR766 in all wells inoculated on all occasions and in 75 % of wells inoculated with 1 TCID 50 during a 28-day in vitro assay (Tables 3 and 4 , Fig. 2c, d) . Inoculation with 1000, 100, 10 TCID 50 of ZIKV PE243 was detected on all occasions in a 14-day in vitro assay. ZIKV PE243 inoculated at 1 TCID 50 resulted in CPE in 39 % of inoculated Vero CCL-81 detector cells in a 14-day in vitro assay and in 100 % of inoculated cells in a 28-day in vitro assay (Tables 3 and 4 , Fig. 3c, d) . The mean appearance of CPE was reported on day 6 for 1000 TCID 50 inoculum, on day 7 for 100 TCID 50 , on day 9 for 10 TCID 50 and on day 14 for 1 TCID 50 . Inoculation of detector cells with measles virus and bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 at 100 TCID 50 , representing system suitability controls for MRC-5 and Vero detector cell lines, respectively, elicited clear detection on all occasions (n=18) within 6 days (Table 4 ).
