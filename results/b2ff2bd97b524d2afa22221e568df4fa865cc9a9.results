The main findings of the survey are shown in Table I . Questionnaires were received from 66 (97%) hospitals, although not all questions were answered by all of the respondents. Ten (15%) replies were received from private hospitals. The median number of acute inpatient beds for all hospitals was 156, but this varied widely between hospital types. The median number of acute beds among specialist hospitals was 121 (range 35e 250). Corresponding values for general hospitals and tertiary hospitals were 142 (range 53e350) and 522 (range 206e753), respectively. There was a median of 0.6 (range 0.1e2.9) whole-time-equivalent consultant microbiologist posts among the 31 (47%) hospitals with an on-site consultant microbiology service. There was a mean ratio of one infection control nurse for every 222 acute beds among the hospitals with one or more infection control nurses on site. The ratio for all hospital beds (acute, long stay, day care and intensive care) with or without on-site access was one per 248. The 10 hospitals without an infection control nurse on site comprised seven general hospitals, two maternity hospitals and one orthopaedic hospital. Eleven (seven general, four specialist) hospitals had no on-site or off-site access to an occupational health physician or occupational health nurse. Occupational health issues were dealt with by an infection control nurse in 24 hospitals. Among the 55 (85%) hospitals with an infection control committee, the membership of the committees included an infection control nurse in 52 (95%) hospitals, a senior administrator in 47 (86%) hospitals, a consultant microbiologist in 39 (71%) hospitals, a general physician in 38 (69%) hospitals, a general surgeon in 37 (67%) hospitals, an occupational health physician in 25 (46%) hospitals, and a sterile services manager in 18 (33%) hospitals. Only nine hospitals had designated administrative/secretarial support for the infection control service, with a median of 0.4 whole-time-equivalents (range 0.1e1). Only six hospitals (9%) had a dedicated budget for infection control, 45 (79%) had a designated computer and 42 (71%) had access to the Internet. However, 47 out of 63 hospitals (75%) provided funding for continuing education and meeting attendance for infection control nurses. Among the 63 (95%) hospitals with single rooms available for isolation, there was a median of one isolation room for every 16 acute beds (range 1.1e 166). Amongst public hospitals, the highest median ratio of isolation rooms was in specialist hospitals (22.6, range 2.5e70). Fifty-five hospitals provided data on the number of isolation rooms with en-suite bathroom facilities, with a median of five rooms (range 0e144) per hospital. For the 43 hospitals that reported having en-suite isolation rooms, there was a median of one en-suite room for every 18 acute beds (range 1.1e188). Only nine (14%) hospitals reported having isolation rooms capable of negative pressure ventilation, with a total of 52 such rooms between them. Five of these hospitals had only one such room and three hospitals had 10 or more rooms, mainly in the Dublin area. All 66 hospitals had documented infection control policies. The distribution of specific policies is shown in Table II . Other policies that were available included a general policy on isolation and transmission-based precautions in 26 (51%) hospitals, severe acute respiratory syndrome in six (12%) hospitals, tuberculosis in 16 (31%) hospitals, and Creutzfelt Jakob disease in 12 (24%) hospitals. Many of these hospitals also listed policies particular to local specialities. Fifty-five hospitals (83%) undertook surveillance of nosocomial infection, the categories of which are outlined in Table III . Sixty-four (97%) hospitals provided data on the ratio of handwashing sinks to acute beds. Twentynine hospitals (45%) had one handwashing sink for every one to five beds and a further 29 (45%) hospitals had one handwashing sink for every five to 10 beds. The remaining six hospitals had ratios ranging from one sink for every 10 beds to one sink for every 25 beds.
