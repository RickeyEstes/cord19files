KSA outbreaks were relatively large, with 180 cases (over the course of 67 days) in Jeddah and 142 cases (over the course of 71 days) in Riyadh. The Korean outbreaks involved 186 cases (over the course of 55 days), including 36 cases (over the course Table I ). The IDEA model was fitted to the daily KSA and Korea MERS-CoV case data according to the onset date. Figure 1 displays the cumulative MERS-CoV case data for the 2014 KSA and the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreaks. The date of symptom onset for Patient 0 was 11 th May 2015; however, he was admitted to the Pyeongtaek hospital on 15 th May 2015. Therefore, the outbreak was assumed to start on 15 th May 2015 via a simulation of the Pyeongtaek hospital outbreak. The outbreak start date for the Samsung hospital was determined to be 25 th May 2015, following the same logic ( Figure 1 ). Figure 2 shows the results of the 2014 KSA outbreak. Squares, circles and asterisks represent data aggregation of the number of cases by serial intervals of six, seven and eight days, respectively; the curves represent model fits for best-fit parameters. The estimated R 0 values for Jeddah and Riyadh were in the range of 3.95e6.68 and 1.92e2.52, respectively, using serial intervals of six to eight days. The estimated R 0 values for the Korea MERS outbreak were 3.96, 4.91 and 5.95 for serial intervals of six, seven and eight days, respectively (Figure 3 ). Since most cases were related to nosocomial infections, R 0 for each hospital was also considered. The outbreak in the Samsung hospital was larger than that in the Pyeongtaek hospital (the first Korean outbreak). The Pyeongtaek hospital exhibited best-fit R 0 values of 4.04, 4.23 and 4.39 for serial intervals of six, seven and eight days, respectively, while the Samsung hospital exhibited greater R 0 values of 5.0, 6.8 and 8.11 for serial intervals of six, seven and eight days, respectively. Figure 3 shows that the IDEA model provided well-fitted curves for the cumulative data regarding South Korean MERS symptom-onset dates for all cases. Although the IDEA model seemed to be appropriate, the original data never fit the model precisely. Therefore, the appropriateness of the model was assessed. , using the incidence decay with exponential adjustment model. Red squares, Jeddah, six days; red circles, Jeddah, seven days; red asterisks, Jeddah, eight days; blue squares, Riyadh, six days; blue circles, Riyadh, seven days; blue asterisks, Riyadh, eight days. evaluated using the relative resnorm to find the best-fit parameters. The results indicated that the best-fit R 0 and serial interval values were 4.9 and seven days for all cases, 4.39 and eight days for the Pyeongtaek hospital, and 5.0 and six days for the Samsung hospital, respectively. d increased with each serial interval because the daily effort of d was aggregated by serial interval.
