This study was conducted during November 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010. In total 19,874 subjects were identified, and 16,032 subjects successfully completed interviews, generating a response rate of 80.7%. The reasons for failing to participate included: 1775 subjects refused to participate; 1037 subjects' current addresses were different from the ones on the household registry; 447 subjects had been relocated, 332 subjects were traveling; 154 subjects could not be reached; and 97 subjects were due to other reasons (household register information discrepancy, death, hospitalization, etc.). There were no statistically significant differences in sex, age, or location of resident between the participants and non-participants. The socio-demographic distributions of the samples are presented in Table 1 . 7917 (49.38%) were man, and 12,282 (76.61%) lived in rural communities. The point and the lifetime prevalence of MDD by sex, location of residence and age group are presented in Tables 2 and 3. The overall point and lifetime prevalence estimates for MDD were 1.10% (95% CI: 0.94-1.26%) and 3.56% (95% CI: 3.27-3.85%) respectively. Table 4 shows the crude odds ratios for MDD (time point prevalence) and each socio-demographic variables (reference group in each category listed in Table 4 ). Univariate regression analysis showed that sex, age, location of residence, marital status, education, employment status, personal and family monthly income, relationships with family, and relationships with others were all significantly associated with MDD. Multivariate factor regression analysis showed that sex, age, family monthly income and the family relationship were all associated with MDD. MDD was more common in female than in male respondents. Older age for respondents was associated with greater risks for MDD as compared to younger age; the group with the lowest family monthly income had the highest risk for MDD; and the group reporting an "average" or "poor" relationship with family or others was associated with an increased risk of depressive disorder.
