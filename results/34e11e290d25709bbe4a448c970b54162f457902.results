A total of 146 bats belonging to 6 species within two families were sampled. Bats of the family Rhinolophidae included 4 Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and 14 Rhinolophus pusillus captured from a karst cave; bats of the family of Vespertilionidae included 26 Eptesicus serotinus from two farmers' houses, 34 Myotis fimbriatus and 10 Myotis ricketti from a city sewer and 58 Myotis pequinius from a cave (Table 2) . Finally, 146 spleen DNA samples were screened for C. burnetii, and 107 blood DNA samples were screened for Babesia spp., Rickettsia spp. and Anaplasma spp. In this study, we found that 2 out of 15 blood samples of E. serotinus (2/15, 13.3%) were positive for Babesia spp., while blood samples of the other 5 bat species (Rh. ferrumequinum, Rh. pusillus, My. fimbriatus, My. ricketti and My. pequiniu) were all negative. BLAST analysis of the 517 bp 18S rDNA sequences showed that the two Babesia spp. detected in E. serotinus in this study (designated as bat Babesia vesperuginis SD030 and bat Babesia vesperuginis SD043), which differed by 4 nucleotides, shared 99.4% similarity with B. vesperuginis (GenBank: AJ871610). BLAST analysis of the 924 bp cox1 sequences showed that the bat Babesia vesperuginis SD030 and bat Babesia vesperuginis SD043 differed by 3 nucleotides, and shared 98.2% and 98.1% similarity with B. vesperuginis (GenBank: MF996533), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of 18S rDNA and cox1genes also showed that Babeisa spp. detected in bats in this study clustered together with B. vesperuginis (Figs. 1 and 2) . The 18S rDNA and cox1 sequences of B.vesperuginis of this study were deposited in the GenBank with accession numbers: MG832414-MG832415 and MH234577-MH234578. We were unable to detect genomic sequences for Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma spp. and C. burnetii. [6, 7, 9, 29] . The prevalence of B. vesperuginis in Mo. megalophylla in South America and in N. noctula in Europe was reported to be 1.19% (2/168) and 1.63% (4/246), respectively [5, 7] . However, the prevalence of B. vesperuginis in other bat species might be biased due to the limited sample size [7, 8] . In this study, the prevalence of B. vesperuginis in E. serotinus from China was 13.3% (2/15), which might also be biased by the limited sample size. To our knowledge, this is the first report of B. vesperuginis in E. serotinus, suggesting that B. vesperuginis has a broad host species and geographical distribution. Natural and experimental infection showed that B.vesperuginis was pathogenic to bats, which could result in symptoms such as lowered blood haemoglobin, raised white blood cell counts and enlarged spleen in bats [8] . Soft ticks (Argas vespertilionis) were suspected to play a role in the transmission of B. vesperuginis among bats [8] . Although no ticks were found on bats in this study, a recent study reported that soft ticks (Argas vespertilionis) collected from B. vesperuginis-positive bats (Pi. pipistrellus) were also positive for B. vesperuginis in northwestern China [6] , indicating that soft ticks might be the vector for B. vesperuginis transmission among bats.
