A summary of the mortality statistics for cats that died or were euthanased at each of the 23 adoption centres included in the study is presented in Table 1 . The percentage of cats that died or were euthanased at the adoption centres varied between 0.9% and 11.5% with a mean mortality rate of 4.7%. The percentage of cats being euthanased ranged from 0.7% to 9.1% and tended to be higher than the naturally occurring deaths which ranged from 0.0% to 4.1%. Infectious causes were reported to be responsible for 148/379 (39.1%) of all deaths recorded at adoption centres during the 6-month study period ( Table 2 ). The most common cause of mortality was attributed to FIV infection (27.7%), whereas FeLV infection accounted for only 4% of deaths recorded, with a further 1.1% of deaths being attributable to FIV and FeLV infection. Conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract (9.8%) and urinary system (7.9%) were responsible for a high proportion of recorded deaths and 19.9% of all euthanasias. Kittens that were either stillborn or that died shortly after birth attributed to 7.1% of all recorded deaths and 29.9% of naturally occurring deaths. Excluding kittens that were born at CP, 27% (20/74) of cats that died or were euthanased within the first 3 days of admission to the centre were relinquished by owners rather than admitted as stray or feral cats. Following removal from the dataset of cats that tested positive for FIV and/or FeLV, a multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to the data, and is summarised in Table 3 . Data relating to the length of stay at an adoption centre were not normally distributed. The median length of stay was 8 days for case cats and 30 days for control cats.
