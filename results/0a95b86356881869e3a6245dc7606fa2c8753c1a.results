We detected highly significant associations between colonies' collective behaviour and the boldness of their boldest individuals (Table 1 ). In colonies in which the boldest individual was particularly bold, the boldest individual attacked prey four times as rapidly as the boldest individuals in colonies in which the boldest individuals were comparatively shy (Fig. 1) . We also detected a highly significant interaction term between day and the boldness of the boldest individual, where the relationship between the behaviour of colonies' boldest individuals and their latency to attack only emerged on days 4 and 5 (Table 1, Fig. 1 ). In contrast, no significant association was detected for days 1e3 (all P > 0.10). Colonies in which the boldest individual was particularly bold also tended to attack prey with more attackers (Table 1) , and the number of attackers that responded to prey increased overall across the 5-day duration of the experiment. Although the interaction between day and the boldness of the boldest individual was not significant (P ¼ 0.0675), there was a tendency for colonies containing bolder individuals to have more individuals participate in the attack. Our combined model predicting the participation of colonies' boldest individuals' in prey capture was highly significant (c 2 9 ¼ 55:35, R 2 ¼ 0.24, P < 0.0001). This result was driven by the large effect of day on the participation of colonies' boldest individuals (Table 2) , where colonies' boldest individuals engaged in prey capture during 60e75% of prey capture events during days 1 and 2, but tapered off to only 10% of capture events on days 4 and 5 (Fig. 2) . Because we failed to detect an effect of reward treatment on task participation of colonies' boldest individuals (P ¼ 0.98; Fig. 2 ), we pooled the data from both treatments for our chi-square tests comparing the involvement of colonies' boldest individuals against that of generic colony members. This procedure increased our statistical power. For day 1 (c 2 2 ¼ 93:44, P < 0.0001) and day 2 (c 2 2 ¼ 141:35, P < 0.0001), colonies' boldest individuals were far more likely to be the first attacker than were colonies' generic individuals. However, for day 3 (c 2 2 ¼ 9, P ¼ 0.011), day 4 (c 2 2 ¼ 0:05, P ¼ 0.97) and day 5 (c 2 2 ¼ 0:05, P ¼ 0.97), this bias disappeared. Note, however, that even for days 3e5, colonies' boldest individuals never engaged in less prey capture behaviour than would be expected by chance. Our combined model predicting within-group behavioural variation at the end of our 5-day trial was highly significant (F 3,32 ¼ 10.66, R 2 ¼ 0.45, P < 0.0001; Fig. 3 ). The significance of this model was driven by the effects of reward treatment and the boldness of the boldest individual, where colonies in the rewarding treatment showed greater within-group behavioural variation at the end our experiments than did colonies in the unrewarding treatment (Table 3, Fig. 3) . Moreover, colonies in which the boldest colony members were particularly bold showed greater withingroup behavioural variation in both treatments. Both aspects of colony performance investigated were associated with the boldness of colonies' boldest individuals. In our rewarding treatment, generic group members gained twice as much mass when they occupied colonies with an extremely bold individual (F 1,16 ¼ 10.66, R 2 ¼ 0.32, P ¼ 0.008; Fig. 4) . Likewise, our combined model predicting the number of surviving generic colony members was significant (c 2 3 ¼ 9:02, R 2 ¼ 0.08, P ¼ 0.028). Here again, colonies that contained one very bold individual boasted 40% higher survivorship than rival colonies (Table 4) .
