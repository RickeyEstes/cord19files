Data collection was conducted via several approaches. One focus group with the airport's key public health professionals was conducted. Seven interviews with key informants related to airport administration, airport operating company, ground services company, immigration authority, security authority and customs authority were performed. Thirty-one policy documents and communications concerning public health measures applied at the airport and produced during the last 4 years were reviewed. All of the interviewed subjects were males, as female workers were a minority at the airport and all of the airport's stakeholders were males. Data analysis produced 49 codes, three main themes and 12 subthemes. A summary of reported codes and their frequencies are presented in Table 1 . The main themes and subthemes of study are summarised in Fig. 1 . A description of main themes of the study is stated below.
