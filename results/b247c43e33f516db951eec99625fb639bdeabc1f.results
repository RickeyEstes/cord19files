Between November 2013 and April 2014, 188 episodes of ARI from 163 patients were reported to the research team (49 men and 114 women), with a mean age of 83 years (SD = 9.2; range: 59-101) for men and 85 years (SD = 7.2; range: 62-101) for women (Table 2) . These patients were from 14 institutions, as four institutions did not report any episode (Table 3) . Overall, there was a significant difference between ECC (p < 0.001) concerning the ratio of the number of episodes to the number of residents. One hundred and thirteen episodes were positive by PCR and/or array for at least one respiratory virus, co-infections with two and three viruses were detected in multiple episodes (Table 4) . Rhinovirus was detected in 53 samples, followed by influenza A (H3), HBoV, HCoVs group 1, HMPV, RSV, HCoVs group 2, and HPIVs types 1/3, respectively with 26, 19, 14, 11, 5, 3 and 1 positive samples (Table 3) . Regarding the severity of the infections, most were clinically mild, although some degree of dyspnea was reported in 50 episodes at the time of collection. The clinical situation deteriorated in 19 (11.7%) patients (severe infection: hospitalization and/ or death). Of these, 14 hospitalizations were reported, and 6 of them died. Five additional deaths in non-hospitalized patients were reported, giving a total of 11 (6.7%) patients dying with ARI during this study. All of the samples from these patients with severe infections were later tested by the array card technique and by a monoplex PCR technique for L. pneumophila. Results of these two approaches in severe patients are presented in Table 5 . To study the association between severe infection and sociodemographic characteristics, clinical information and co-morbidities, a univariable analysis was performed (see Supplementary  Table S1 ). In the final multivariable model, variables "age", "HMPV" and "Respiratory disease" showed an association with severe infection. For each 5 years increase in age there was a 49% increase in the odds of severe infection (OR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.02-2.17; p = 0.042). The residents infected with HMPV had a seven-fold increase in the odds of severe infection (OR = 6.99; 95% CI: 1.96-24.95; p = 0.003). Also, the odds of severe infection was four times higher in residents with "Respiratory disease" (OR = 4.09; 95% CI: 1.51-11.06; p = 0.006). Information about vaccination status for influenza viruses was obtained from 159 patients (159 from 163 with reported infections). The rates of influenza A(H3) infections among vaccinated and unvaccinated patients were quite similar (p = 0.682) (Table 6 ). Moreover, influenza was not associated with serious infections (p = 0.215 and p = 0.357 for hospitalization and death, respectively). Concerning the genetic characterization of influenza strains, typing was obtained only for 9 strains A(H3), from patients living in 3 different ECC (ECC1, ECC2 and ECC6). Eight viruses were from vaccinated patients and 1 from an unvaccinated patient. All the strains belong to the genetic group 3C, which includes also the strain A(H3) of the vaccine 2013/14 season. However, they were divided into different subgroups: samples of ECC1 (n = 1) and ECC06 (n = 5) belong to the genetic subgroup 3C.3 and samples of the ECC02 (n = 3) belong to the 3C.2 (the vaccine strain belongs to subgroup 3C.1). The virus detected in the unvaccinated patient shows the same sequence of strains detected in vaccinated patients of the same ECC (ECC02) (Figure 1) . Relating to the amino acid substitutions, 9 amino acid position changes were identified in the HA1 subunit of the influenza strains from this study, when compared with the strain included in the 2013/14 influenza vaccine, A/Texas/50/2012. Samples of the ECC02 share the same substitutions of amino acids present in the reference strains of the 3C.2 subgroup (N128T, N145S, V186G, P198S and F219S), which distinguishes them from the vaccine strain. The viruses detected in ECC01 and ECC06 share 4 of the substitutions in 3C.2 subgroup (N145S, V186G, P198S and F219S) and acquire three new replacements (N128A, R142G and L157S). Regarding viruses from ECC06, all accumulate the R261Q substitution. All these mentioned amino acid substitutions occurred in the hemagglutinin antigenic sites, and have already been observed in other strains that circulated in the season 2013/ 14.
