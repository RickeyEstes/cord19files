Twenty-nine percent of healthcare worker households have an obligation to care for a child between 3 and 12 years of age. Focusing on households without a non-working adult or sibling 13 years or older who could potentially care for children ages 3-12 (https://www.redcross.org/take-aclass/babysitting/babysitting-child-care-training/babysitting-certification), we find that 15% or slightly more than 1 in 7, healthcare worker households have child care obligations. This may be optimistic because non-working adults may not be able to provide care, e.g., they may require care themselves. On the other hand, it is possible that family members outside the household, neighbors, or friends could care for children, though no data are available in the CPS on these possibilities. We find that 7% of healthcare households are single-parent households, which is greater than all other major industry classifications. Within the healthcare sector, there are critical professions that are even more exposed to child care obligations (Table 1) . These include households with a nurse, psychiatric, and home health care aids, nurse practitioner, medical assistant, nurse anesthetist, diagnostics technologist, physician's assistant, or physician and surgeon. Assuming that non-working adults or siblings 13 or older can meet the child care obligations, 22% of nurse practitioners, 21% of physician's assistants, 19% of diagnostic technicians, 18% of medical assistants, 16% of physicians and surgeons, and 13% of nursing, psychiatric, and home healthcare aids would still have unmet child care obligations. This is just over 20% of the healthcare workforce. School closures may be especially challenging for single parents. 14.7% of nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides are single parents. Medical assistants (10.5%) and licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses (9.7%) are also more likely to be single parents than the healthcare average. Together this is 30% of the healthcare workforce, and is the segment most likely to be providing infection control for the elderly in nursing homes and other facilities. Registered nursing is the most common profession in the healthcare field and accounts for 29.5% of the healthcare labor force, followed by nursing, psychiatric, and home health care aides (18.8%). 28% of registered nurses have child care obligations, but perhaps 13% of registered nurses can meet these obligations with a non-working adult or older sibling, leaving 15% with unmet child care obligations. Five percent of registered nurses are single parents, but this varies from state to state (Figure 1 ). The exposure of the healthcare labor force to school closures is not homogeneous throughout the US (Appendix Table 1 ). How a policy trade-off plays out in one place may be different than another even if two locations experience a similar set of COVID-19 cases. That is, different places may have similar projected benefits from school closures, but different costs. The greatest share of the healthcare labor force with child care obligations is in Utah (35%), Louisiana (35%), and Missouri (34%), whereas the healthcare labor force in Washington DC (16%), Vermont (21%), and Massachusetts (24%) have the least child care obligations. However, household structures also vary. Therefore, if childcare obligations can be met by a non-working adult or older sibling, then South Dakota (21%), Oregon (20%), and Missouri (20%) are the most exposed states to school closure induced healthcare worker shortages. Washington DC (9%), New Mexico (10%), and New Jersey (11%) may be most able to cover their child care obligations. Louisiana (12%), Mississippi (11%), and Pennsylvania (10%) have the greatest fraction of single-parent healthcare worker households. These differences are likely an interaction of variations in state-level healthcare regulation, cultural, and demographic differences. This requires state and local health officials to consider the exposure of their own state (data available at https://github.com/jbayham/us_childcare_obligations) or region. Using the data on child care obligations provides a first estimate of potential reductions in the healthcare labor force during a school closure. This estimate can be combined with projections of the case reductions from school closures to identify the parameter space where estimates of 1 are important to inform whether school closures would reduce net mortality (Figure 2 ). If the is large, then the increase percent increase in the mortality rate is below , and closing schools saves lives. This is the case when school closures lead to many avoided cases, and few healthcare workforce effects. Conversely, if is near zero, then then it is likely that the percent increase in mortality exceeds and school closure increases the cumulative mortality. This is the case if the school closure reduces the labor force substantially but provides a relatively small reduction in cumulative cases. There is a band where 0 ≪ ≪ ∞, where whether or not closing schools saves lives depends on the value of , which is unknown. For the United States, and for most states within the US, the is not sufficently higher or lower to know which way a school closure will turnout without more information on . Consider an example that uses Cauchemez et al.'s (2008) estimate of a reduciton of cases of 15% from a school closure and assume baseline mortality to COVID-19 of 2%. Assume an epidemiological forcast without a school closure predicts 16,000 cases (about a 1/5 th of the cases currently reported in China), which implies 320 deaths (Italy has already reported 463 deaths with 9,172 cases). The school closure reduces cases to 13,600. The for this scenario is 0.176, with an associate 0.024. Therefore, the mortality rate after the closure must rise to at least 2.35% as a result of the 15% loss in the healthcare workforce in order to undo the benefits of school closures. This implies the percent increase in patient survival by avoiding a 15% reduction in the health workforce, an elasticity measuring healthcare worker "prodcutivity," is 0.024. This means that doubling the healthcare workforce must not save more than 2.4% more patients or school closures could lead to more deaths. However, there is substantial variation across the country. For example, in South Dakota this elasticity is 1.7%, wheres in Washington DC it is 4.1%. An additional concern could be timing within an epidemic. School closure could spread out cases so as not to overwhelm the healthcare system. Cauchemez et al. estimates a reduction in peak prevalence of about 42%. This cannot raise the mortality per case in that period to less than 3.4% or an elasiticity of 9.9% for school closure to save lives.
