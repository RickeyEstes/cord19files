Three flights from Wuhan landed at the Istres military air force base carrying a total of 337 passengers, including 178 on the first flight, 124 (31 of which were other European nationals) on the second flight, and 35 on the third flight. Among 337 repatriates, 170 were male (50.4%), and their mean age was 31 years (ranging 0 to 75 years). Unfortunately, because of time constraint, we were not able to document duration of expatriation and professional status of participants. Among the passengers from the first flight, two became symptomatic in the following days. One was diagnosed with rhinitis with a rhinovirus, and the other had consolidated pneumonia without microbiological documentation. Once discharged from the BSL3 unit, these patients were returned to their quarantine base. Of the 178 passengers on the first flight, 172 asymptomatic repatriated individuals were tested at day 1 (D1) and all were negative; two refused sampling and four were not found. Of the 178 passengers present in the quarantine base on day 5, 173 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2; one refused sampling, four were not found but had tested negative on D1. Of the 254 passengers on the second flight, 124 were transferred from the Wuhan airplane to airplanes chartered by European countries, including Belgium, one national of which was later diagnosed in Belgium as being positive. These passengers were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the airport but we retrospectively tested people who had been in close contact with the Belgian patient, who were all negative. For 20 symptomatic passengers who were sampled at the airport, all SARS-CoV-2 tests were negative. Finally, 35 passengers landed with the third flight. No symptomatic cases were detected during the flight and 35 and 33 of the tested repatriates were negative at D1 and D5 respectively (two refused the test at D5). Finally, of the total number of 337 repatriated individuals, 23 were symptomatic, 336 were tested at least once, one refused to be tested, 328 were tested twice at D1 and D5, and all were negative for SARS-CoV-2. The time between the arrival of respiratory samples at the laboratory to the results of SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests varied between the first batch and later batches of tests. For the first flight, samples for all 124 repatriated individuals were received at 8pm, and PCR results were communicated at 12.50am and 2.40am for the first batch of 54 samples and the second batch of 69 samples, respectively. Timeto-results was therefore four hours and fifty minutes (290 minutes) and six hours and forty (400 minutes), respectively. For the second flight, samples were received in two different series, which made them easier to manage. In addition, we optimised the testing strategy by prioritising the extraction of RNA from the samples, rather than performing a complete registration of all samples in our laboratory computer system then preparing all aliquots from the samples including for preparation of the biobank. Thus, a first series of 20 samples was received at 6.20pm and the results were communicated at 9.10pm, two hours and fifty minutes later (170 minutes), while a second series of 75 samples was received at 8.25pm and the results were available Ã  11.30pm, two hours and fifty-five minutes later (175 minutes). The timescale for obtaining the PCR results was similar for the third flight and for the retests at day 5, as results were available approximatively three hours after samples were received at our laboratory. The timetable is presented in Figure 3 .
