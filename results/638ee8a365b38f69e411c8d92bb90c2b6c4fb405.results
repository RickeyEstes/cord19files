There was no death of pigs in the process of intubation. Oxygen saturation was above 95% in all pigs. As is shown in Table 1 , the total intubation time by robot system was longer compared with the direct laryngoscope (mean 74.6 ± 2.3 s vs 53.2 ± 3.1 s, P < 0.01). For robot system, the mean value of "frontline time" consumed by medical students was 23.4 ± 0.7 s ( Table 2) . Four pigs (40%) achieved first-attempt success and six pigs (60%) achieved overall success by laryngoscope while eight pigs (80%) achieved first-attempt success and nine pigs (90%) achieved overall success by robot system. There was no statistically difference in first-attempt and overall success rate between two groups (P = 0.17, 0.30, respectively). However, the absolute numbers of successful intubation by robot system were higher than that by laryngoscope (first-attempt success rate 80% vs 40%, overall success rate 90% vs 60%). Four failed cases in laryngoscope group were due to excessive attempts or prolonged time. One case failure in robot group was caused by bradycardia (heart rate <30 beats/min) in the course of exposing the glottis, which terminated the intubation process. Two intubation complications occurred in the process of intubation by laryngoscope, one was mucosal bleeding and the other was esophageal intubation. One intubation complication occurred in robot group was mucosal bleeding. There was no statistically difference in the number of optimization manoeuvres were required to facilitate tracheal intubation between groups (P = 0.37). There was no statistically difference in the elevation of HR and SBP (P = 0.33, 0.89, respectively), although figures by laryngoscope were slightly higher than that by the robot system.
