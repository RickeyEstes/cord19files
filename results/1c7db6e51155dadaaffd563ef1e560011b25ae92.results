As described in Methods, the distribution of times between symptom onset and hospitalisation was estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo ( Figure 1B and Figure S1 ) from the patient data in Figure 1A . This gave rise to a range of equally plausible distributions describing these time periods (blue lines in Figure 1B ). The average of these distributions is shown by the red line in Figure 1B , however we used the full range of distributions in our calculations of the probability of sustained transmission occurring from each imported case. Each of the range of plausible distributions corresponded to an estimate for the probability of a self-sustaining outbreak (Equation (1) and histogram in Figure 1C) . A single estimate for the probability of sustained transmission can be obtained by summing over the range of distributions using Equation (2) . The resulting probability of sustained transmission is 0.41 (red line in Figure 1C ), with credible interval (CrI) [0.27, 0.55], where the CrI reflects the 5th and 95th percentile estimates. We then considered the reduction in the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission if surveillance is more intense. Specifically, we assumed that intensified surveillance led to a reduction in the mean period from symptom onset to hospitalisation, governed by the parameter ρ (where ρ = 0 corresponds to no intensification of surveillance, and ρ = 1 corresponds to an implausible scenario in which infectious cases are hospitalised immediately). We found that, if surveillance is intensified so that the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation is halved, the probability that each imported case leads to sustained transmission is reduced to only 0.012 (CrI [0, 0.099]; Figure 1D ). Finally, we considered the combined effect if multiple cases arrive in a new location. In that scenario, intense surveillance has the potential to reduce the risk of sustained transmission significantly compared to weak surveillance. For ρ = 0.5, the probability that any of 10 imported cases generate a substantial outbreak is only 0.12 (CrI [0, 0.65]; Figure 2C ). This highlights the importance of rigorous surveillance, particularly in locations where infected hosts are most likely to travel.
