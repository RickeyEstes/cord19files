From among 2266 hospitalized patients, different respiratory infectious viruses were detected in 2041 (91.6%) samples (1082 male and 959 female participants). Among age group of 1 to 5 years 44.7% respiratory infections were recorded and 7.8% infections were detected in age group of 11 to 14 years ( Table 1) (Table 2) . Statistically significant relationships were found between the detection of single and multiple virus infections in the AdV and HEV groups ( < 0.05). In multiple viral infections coinfections were recorded among HRV (36.7%), AdV (35.2%), HBoV (11.2), RSV B (7.8%), and RSV (6.7%), respectively (Table 3) . Patients' clinical presentations with different etiological agents were compared and listed in Table 4 . The monthly distribution patterns of different respiratory viruses were shown in Figure 1 . The prevalence rate of sixteen respiratory viruses during spring, summer, autumn,
