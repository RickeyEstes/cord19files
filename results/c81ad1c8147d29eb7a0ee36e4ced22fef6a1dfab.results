Eleven of the 60 fecal samples were positive for coronavirus. These positive samples came from crias on two different farms, located approximately 100 m from each other, both with mixed alpaca-cattle pastures. Phylogenetic analysis of the generated sequences (393 nt) all segregated within the species Betacoronavirus 1 (Fig. 1) . The majority of the sequences obtained in this study (GenBank KP893231, KP893232, KP893233, KP893234, KP893235, KP893236, KP893238, KP893240, all from farm 1, and KP893237, from the farm 2) were identical to AB354579 (Kakegawa strain BCoV) and AF220295 (Quebec strain BCoV) in the area under analysis, while KP893239 and KP893241 (both from farm 1) had a similarity of 99.5% and 99.7%, respectively.
