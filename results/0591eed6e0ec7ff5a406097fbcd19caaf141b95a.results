Between June 2, 2016, and Jan 4, 2017, we screened 43 participants for this study, of whom 38 were sequentially randomly assigned to six cohorts (figure 1). The study ended after being fully enrolled. After allocation to study groups, all participants completed the planned follow-up. Baseline characteristics of the randomly assigned participants are shown in table 1. 97 adverse events were reported: 64 occurred in 23 (82%) of 28 participants receiving SAB-301 (mean 2·3 adverse events per participant), and 33 adverse events occurred in all ten participants receiving placebo (mean 3·3 adverse events per participant; table 2). There was one grade 3 adverse event of depression, and one grade 4 adverse event of suicide attempt, both occurring in the same participant. There was one serious adverse event of hospital admission for a suicide attempt by the same participant who had received 50 mg/kg of SAB-301, which, as the other two adverse events in this participant, was judged to be unrelated to study intervention. This participant had a history of depression for several years that was not disclosed at the time of screening, and the participant was not receiving medical care or treatment at the time of enrolment. The most common adverse events were headache, albuminuria, increased creatine kinase, common cold, myalgia, and low serum bicarbonate. Most adverse events were noted in similar proportions in those receiving SAB-301 and placebo (table 2). There were two hypotensive events that occurred during study drug administration, both in cohort 6 (50 mg/kg of SAB-301): one in a participant who received SAB-301 and the other in one who received placebo. Regarding the hypotensive event in the participant receiving SAB-301, 30 min after the start of the infusion, the participant complained of feeling warm and slightly lethargic. Blood pressure at the time was 96/58 (about 20 mm Hg lower than pre-infusion), and there was no increase in heart rate. The infusion was stopped for 15 min with no other intervention, and the hypotension resolved. The infusion was restarted with no further episodes of hypotension. Low serum bicarbonate was seen only in participants receiving SAB-301 (three [11%] of 28), and were only noted in cohorts 5 (20 mg/kg of SAB-301) and 6 (50 mg/kg of SAB-301). Two vasovagal reactions occurred in participants assigned to receive SAB-301, dose-proportional increases in the parameters of C max and AUC 0-∞ over the 20-fold range of doses from 2·5 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg (table 3) . We did not use pharmacokinetic data from the 1 mg/kg cohort because a terminal phase could not be identified because of multiple concentrations that were below the limit of assay detection (15·63 µg/mL). Mean concentration versus time profiles of the SAB-301 cohorts at each dose are shown in figure 2A . SAB-301 concentrations after infusion appeared to follow a bi-exponential decline and best fit a two-compartmental pharmacokinetic model. Results for key pharmacokinetic parameters from non-compartmental analysis are shown in table 4 and parameters obtained from the two-compartmental model are presented in the appendix. The average terminal elimination half-life (T 1/2 ) was within the range of a typical antibody in human beings (approximately 28 days) across all dose cohorts, excluding the 1 mg/kg cohort. Both uncorrected and baselineadjusted serum immunoglobulin concentrations over time did not appear to correlate with dose of SAB-301 administered or SAB-301 pharmacokinetic concentrations (data not shown). We determined anti-MERS neutralising antibody titres using the Jordan-N3/2012 strain of MERS-CoV (a clade A strain). Microneutralisation titres correlated with SAB-301 concentrations in serum ( figure 2B) . The functional neutralisation of the MERS virus seems to follow the pharmacokinetic exposure of SAB-301 described previously (R²=0·845, p<0·0001). Pharmacodynamic analysis using the microneutralisation titres showed similar results, with geometric mean titres in the 50 mg/kg cohort of 1/1240 at 7 days and 1/600 at 21 days (appendix). We investigated the immunogenicity of SAB-301 in several ways. We assessed the presence of anti-IgG antibodies using rheumatoid factor. One participant in cohort 5 (20 mg/kg of SAB-301) became rheumatoidfactor positive on day 21, with a maximum rheumatoid factor of 17 IU/mL. This positive rhematoid factor persisted throughout the study, and there were no associated symptoms with this finding (the only adverse event reported in this participant was albuminuria). We also assessed anti-drug antibody (anti-SAB-301). Three participants had anti-drug antibody present at baseline (before study drug administration), which persisted and did not change throughout the study (one participant in the 10 mg/kg of SAB-301 cohort and two in the 50 mg/kg of SAB-301 cohort). The pharmacokinetic parameters for these three participants were compared with the other participants in their respective cohorts, and there was no significant difference in T ½ , C max , or AUC. All participants with preexisting anti-SAB-301 had higher results for T ½ and AUC than the cohort geometric mean. No new anti-drug antibodies were developed after administration of SAB-301. We assessed the presence of anti-bovine κ light chain, representing residual bovine proteins that might be present in the final intravenous immunoglobulin product. Seven participants had antibodies to the bovine κ light chain detected at baseline. There was no development of new anti-bovine κ-light-chain antibodies after administration of SAB-301. We also assessed whether anti-camelid antibody was present, representing immunogenicity towards a llama anti-human κ-light-chain antibody used in the manufacturing process to purify SAB-301. No participants had anti-camelid antibody at baseline, or developed these antibodies during the study.
