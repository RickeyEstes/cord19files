Ribosome profiling shows a temporal shift in PRF efficiency. To investigate PRF efficiency in the context of virus infection, we used ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) to directly monitor the density of ribosomes upstream and downstream of the frameshift site. Ribosome profiling is a recently developed technique that enables global footprinting of translating ribosomes in cells via high-throughput sequencing of ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs) (Fig. 1b) 19, 20 . We infected murine L929 cells with wild-type (WT) or shift site mutant (SS) viruses and harvested cells at 2, 4, 6 and 8 h post infection (p.i.). In the SS mutant, the WT shift site G_GUU_UUU is mutated to A_GUG_UUU (Fig. 1c) to inhibit PRF 17 . Ribo-Seq libraries were prepared from each sample, deep sequenced, and the resulting reads mapped to host and viral genomes. Ribo-Seq quality was assessed as described previously (Supplementary Fig. 1 ) 21 . Figure 1d shows the distributions of RPFs on the WT and SS virus genomes at 4 and 8 h p.i. (see Supplementary Fig. 2a for 2 and 6 h p.i.). For WT virus, a substantial decrease in mean ribosome density was observed to occur after the 2B* ORF at 6 and 8 h p.i., indicating that the majority of ribosomes translating the viral genome frameshift into the 2B* ORF and terminate at the 2B* stop codon. For the SS mutant, however, there is no significant drop in RPF density at the 2B* stop codon, consistent with inhibited frameshifting in this mutant. PRF efficiencies were estimated from the WT ratio of downstream to upstream RPF densities, normalized by the SS mutant to control for variation in translational speed, technical biases and ribosome pausing between different genomic locations. PRF efficiencies were not obviously different from zero at 2 and 4 h p.i., but at 6 and 8 h p.i. were remarkably high, at 64% and 69%, respectively ( Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 2b) . Consistent with the absence of measurable PRF at 2 and 4 h p.i., a noticeable ribosomal pause that was observed in the 2B* region at 6 and 8 h p.i. for WT virus, is absent at 2 and 4 h p.i. and in the SS mutant ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2a) . The effector of this pause is uncertain though, in common with many other ribosomal pauses, it may be nascent peptide mediated. Extraordinarily, from 6 h p.i. RPFs accumulated to high levels on the mutated shift site ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2a ). In contrast, only a modest accumulation was apparent on the WT shift site. The position of RPFs in this region indicate that the pause initiates when the UUU of the shift site is in the ribosomal A-site and, in these samples, continues for B3 codons thereafter ( Supplementary  Fig. 2c,d) , although such broadening of the pause is likely an artefact resulting from ribosome run-on during sample preparation 22 . The total excess accumulation of RPFs over these four codons at 6 and 8 h p.i. relative to 4 h p.i. is B5-fold greater in SS than in WT. Ribosome profiling of eukaryotic systems typically has the characteristic that mappings of the 5 0 end positions of RPFs to coding sequences reflect the triplet periodicity (herein referred to as 'phasing') of genetic decoding. Figure 1f and Supplementary  Fig. 2e show the polyprotein-frame codon positions to which the 5 0 ends of RPFs map for regions upstream of 2B*, within 2B*, and downstream of 2B*. For the upstream and downstream regions, RPF 5 0 ends map mainly to the first and third positions of polyprotein-frame codons. In contrast, within the 2B* region, RPF 5 0 ends for WT virus at 6 and 8 h p.i. map mainly to the third and second positions of polyprotein-frame codons, consistent with a mixture of ribosomes translating the two overlapping reading frames in this region. For the SS mutant, there is no change in the phasing of RPF 5 0 end positions in the overlap region (Fig. 1f) , consistent with inhibited PRF in this mutant. An RNA stem-loop is essential for PRF and ribosome pausing. Previously, a downstream stem-loop structure, separated from the frameshift site by a 13-nt 'spacer', was identified bioinformatically 17 . This positioning is inconsistent with canonical mRNA structure stimulators of À 1 PRF, which are separated from the shift site by just 5-9 nt. The predicted stem-loop is conserved in different isolates of EMCV and in TMEV, with compensatory substitutions (i.e. paired substitutions that preserve the predicted base-pairings) further supporting its biological relevance ( Supplementary Fig. 3a ). RNA structure probing also supported the stem-loop ( Supplementary Fig. 3b,c) . To assess a role for the stem-loop in PRF and/or ribosome pausing, we generated a stem-loop mutant virus, WT-SL, and a corresponding shift site mutant, SS-SL, and performed ribosome profiling at 8 h p.i. (Fig. 2a (Fig. 2d) , consistent with inhibition of PRF. The PRF efficiency was measured as 70% for WT virus, but negligible for the SS, WT-SL and SS-SL mutants (Fig. 2e) . Thus the stem-loop is essential for efficient PRF. The EMCV frameshift signal is located just downstream of the junction between the 2A-and 2B-encoding regions of the polyprotein ORF (Figs 1a and 2a) . Separation between 2A and 2B occurs co-translationally via a mechanism known as 'StopGo' or 'Stop-Carry On' that depends critically on the amino acid motif D(V/I)ExNPGP (where the last proline is the first amino acid of 2B) 15, 16 . To assess whether StopGo affects PRF, we applied ribosome profiling to viruses LV-WT and LV-SS-SL in which StopGo was inhibited by mutating the NPGP sequence to NPLV (Fig. 2a,b) 23 . For LV-WT, RPF phasing in the overlap region was not greatly different from WT (Fig. 2d) , and the calculated PRF efficiency (62%) was only slightly lower than WT (70%) (Fig. 2e ). The modest difference may be due to slower replication in the mutant leading to a lag in achieving maximum PRF efficiency, or may indicate a more direct (albeit modest) stimulatory effect of StopGo on PRF, likely related to proper processing of the C terminus of 2A (see below). On the other hand, for the mutant LV-SS-SL these features were similar to the SS-SL mutant. Thus we found no evidence for ribosome drop-off induced by StopGo alone. Virus protein 2A binds the RNA stem-loop. Having observed that PRF in EMCV increases from 0 to 70% over the course of infection and depends critically on an RNA stem-loop structure positioned unusually far 3 0 of the frameshift site, we reasoned that some virus-induced trans-acting protein might interact with the stem-loop to promote PRF. To test this, we used the RiboTrap system in which RNA transcripts are labelled with 5-bromo-uridine to allow immunopurification of bound complexes. A short RNA transcript containing the EMCV stem-loop was found to bind an B16 kDa protein from EMCV-infected cell lysates that was not observed with mock-infected cell lysates or with a control RNA containing a scrambled version of the EMCV stem-loop sequence ( Supplementary Fig. 6a ). Mass spectrometric analysis of this product revealed it to be the viral protein 2A ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 6b ). To confirm this interaction, we expressed and purified recombinant 2A protein and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with a 64-nt 32 P-labelled RNA containing the EMCV frameshift site and stem-loop. Two main RNA:protein complexes were observed, with the more slowly migrating species accumulating as the amount of 2A was increased (Fig. 3a) , confirming that 2A does indeed bind the EMCV PRF signal. We estimated the K d of the interaction to be B3-4.5 mM (Fig. 3b) . A CCC triplet in the RNA loop is highly conserved between different isolates of EMCV and TMEV ( Supplementary Fig. 3a) , suggesting a potential role in 2A binding. To investigate this, we mutated the middle C to U (C46U; Fig. 3c ) and tested whether cold WT RNA or cold mutant RNA could compete with the 32 P-labelled WT RNA for 2A binding. Whereas the WT RNA was able to compete well, greatly diminishing radiolabelled RNA:protein complexes at increasing molar excess, the C46U mutant was unable to compete, indicating that this single-nucleotide mutation had prevented 2A binding (Fig. 3d) . Similarly, RNAs with stem-disrupting mutations (G52U and SL3 0 ; Fig. 3c ) were also unable to compete with WT RNA (Fig. 3e) , indicating that the presence of at least part of the stem-loop duplex is also important for 2A binding (and not just for proper positioning of the RNA:protein complex for PRF stimulation). A direct interaction between 2A and RNA would likely involve a cluster of positively charged residues on 2A. By inspecting an alignment of cardiovirus 2A sequences we identified a conserved linear basic cluster ( Supplementary Fig. 6c ). We generated a recombinant mutant 2A (hereafter 2A-mut) by changing R95 and R97 to alanines ( Supplementary Fig. 6d ,e). EMSA analysis confirmed that 2A-mut was unable to bind to the EMCV PRF signal (Fig. 3f) R95 and R97 substitutions resulted in a protein expression pattern similar to that of SS mutant virus, indicating that the 2A mutations had inhibited PRF (Fig. 4a-c) . Consistent with the increase in frameshifting efficiency, the amount of 2A in cells infected with WT virus increases dramatically between 4 and 6 h p.i. (Fig. 4d) . Virus protein 2A trans-activates ribosomal frameshifting. Next we asked whether the 2A protein is sufficient to stimulate PRF in the absence of viral infection. To test this we titrated recombinant 2A into a wheat germ (WG) in vitro translation system programmed with a reporter mRNA containing the EMCV PRF signal (Fig. 5a) . Increasing amounts of 2A led to a modest general inhibition of cap-dependent translation, as reported previously 24, 25 . When the reporter was translated in the absence of 2A, only the non-frameshift product was observed (Fig. 5b , lane DB). However, in the presence of 2A, efficient PRF was observed, to a level of B20% with increasing amounts of 2A (Fig. 5b,c) . In control translations, PRF was abolished upon mutating the frameshift site (SS), or the stem-loop and CCC triplet (SL), or upon replacing 2A with 2A-mut (Fig. 5d) . Changing the loop-region CCC triplet to UUU (3CU), CUC (C46U) or CAC (C46A) also inhibited PRF (Fig. 5e) . The SL5 0 and SL3 0 mutations of Figs 3c and 5a substantially reduced PRF (to 4% and 1%, respectively) whereas the SL5 0 3 0 mutations (designed to restore the stem-loop structure but with altered base pairings) restored PRF to WT levels (Fig. 5e) . Further, increasing ( þ U) or decreasing ( À U) the spacer length by 1 nt reduced PRF to 6 and 1%, respectively (Fig. 5e) . Similar results were observed in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) in vitro translation system ( Supplementary Fig. 7) . The in vitro translation systems were also used to further investigate ribosome pausing at the frameshift site ( Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 8 ). The extent of pausing was assessed by comparing the levels of a translational intermediate corresponding to pausing at the EMCV shift site with that of the full-length polypeptide produced during a time course in which translation was synchronized by the addition of edeine, a potent inhibitor of initiation, 5 min after the start of the reaction. Consistent with the ribosome profiling, we observed strong pausing at a mutated shift site (SS) in the presence of recombinant 2A (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 8a) , a much less pronounced pause at the WT shift site (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 8b) , and no pause when the stem-loop and CCC triplet were mutated (SS-SL and WT-SL; Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 8c) or when SS or WT RNA was translated in the presence of 2A-mut ( Fig. 6e and Supplementary  Fig. 8d) . Thus, both the stem-loop and 2A protein are required for ribosome pausing. When the spacer length was increased by 1 nt (SS þ U and WT þ U) pausing was observed in the presence of 2A but was much less pronounced than for SS RNA ( Supplementary Fig. 8e,f) . The appearance of the pause product is transitory (albeit spread over several minutes for WT and many minutes for SS; Fig. 6b,c) , consistent with its identity as a genuine intermediate rather than a dead-end product. There was no evidence for significant ribosomal drop-off occurring at the WT shift site (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 8b , 60-min lane) though we could not rule out a small amount of drop-off occurring when the shift site was mutated due to the long half-life of the pause product for these constructs (Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 8a ).
