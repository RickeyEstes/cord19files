Revealing the Antiviral Potential of IFITM Proteins in Virus-Producing Cells While the role of IFITM proteins as inhibitors of virus entry is well established, the experimental systems used to characterize this antiviral function have relied on cell-free virus infections . However, HIV-1 spreads effectively in culture and likely within infected individuals by passing directly between cells in a process known as cell-to-cell transmission (Dale et al., 2013; Sattentau, 2011; Sourisseau et al., 2007; Murooka et al., 2012) . We used previously described doxycyclineinducible CD4+ SupT1 T cell lines ( Figure S1A , available online), engineered to allow expression of FLAG-IFITM3, to describe their effect during HIV-1 replication. In these cells, a fraction of IFITM3 is found at the cell surface, as assessed by flow cytometry ( Figure S1B ). As reported (Lu et al., 2011) , induction of IFITM3 in target cells followed by incubation with cell-free virions resulted in a potent block to viral replication ( Figure 1A ). However, increasing the viral inoculum lead to a less marked restriction ( Figure S1C ), suggesting that this antiviral effect may be partly saturable. We then assessed the ability of IFITM to impact direct viral cell-to-cell spread. We used a transient coculture system (Malbec et al., 2013; Sourisseau et al., 2007) , in which HIV-1-infected donor T cells were mixed with dye-labeled SupT1 target cells. After 2 hr of coculture, target cells were isolated using a cell sorter. Infection of target cells was assessed up to 3 days later by measuring Gag expression ( Figure 1B ). The Gag signal in targets was due to de novo synthesis, since it was significantly reduced in the presence of reverse transcriptase inhibitor Nevirapine (data not shown). In contrast to cell-free HIV-1, when infections were performed by coculture, the induction of IFITM3 in target cells had little to no effect on inhibiting virus spread ( Figure 1B ). This lack of antiviral effect was observed when donor cells were infected at different levels ( Figure 1B) . Thus, IFITM3-expressing cells are no longer protected against infection from Figure S1 ) before infection with NL4-3 HIV-1. Viral replication was followed by intracellular Gag staining at the days indicated. Left: one representative experiment. Right: mean ± SD of three independent experiments at day 3 p.i., with viral inoculum varying from 1 to 12 ng/ml p24. (B) SupT1 cells were infected with NL4-3. When 30%-50% of the cells were Gag+, IFITM3 was induced, or not induced, overnight with doxycycline. These donor cells were cocultivated 2 hr with labeled SupT1 target cells expressing or not expressing IFITM3. Target cells were sorted, and transmission was monitored by the fraction of Gag+ target cells at the days indicated. Left: one representative experiment. Right: mean ± SD of three independent experiments at day 2 p.i., with increasing amounts of infection among donor cells, varying from 30% to 50%. (C) Schematic illustration of the four combinations of cells tested. (D) One representative experiment. Cocultures were performed as described in (B). (E) Mean ± SD of three independent experiments at day 2 p.i. (F) 293T cells were transfected with pNL4-3 and FLAG-IFITM3 expression plasmids and cocultivated with SupT1 target cells expressing or not expressing IFITM3 for 2 hr. Target cells were harvested, and transmission was monitored by measuring the fraction of Gag+ target cells. Mean ± SD of four independent experiments at day 2 p.i. Levels of Gag in the target cells in the absence of IFITM3 in both donors and targets were normalized to 100%. A one-sample t test was performed in (E) and (F), *p < 0.05. Comparisons were made between the condition indicated and the IFITM3 À/À condition. See also Figure S1 . cell-associated virus, partly because local titers using virus-producing cells are high. This led us to ask whether IFITM3 possesses other antiviral functions that are robust to this mode of HIV spread. We modified the coculture system to include conditions in which IFITM3 was induced either in infected donors, in targets, or in both ( Figure 1C ). While IFITM3 in uninfected target cells had minimal effect, IFITM3 in the donors decreased HIV transmission approximately 2-fold ( Figures 1D and 1E) . A more potent inhibition was observed when both donors and targets expressed IFITM3, which resulted in a 5-fold decrease in productive target cell infection. This unexpected role of IFITM3 was confirmed using another coculture system in which the virus does not spread in the donor cells. We cotransfected 293T cells with an HIV-1 provirus and an IFITM3-expressing plasmid and cocultured them with IFITM3-negative or -positive SupT1 cells. A 5-fold inhibition of virus transmission to target cells was observed in this system, and inhibition was further enhanced when target cells also expressed IFITM3 ( Figure 1F ). Titration of the ifitm3-encoding plasmid demonstrated that inhibition of transmission was dependent on the amount of IFITM3, while a control plasmid encoding MxA had no effect ( Figure S1D ). Together, these coculture experiments identify that HIV-1, by spreading intercellularly, escapes canonical IFITM-mediated restriction in the uninfected target cell. However, IFITM proteins potently inhibit the spread of virus from cells that are already infected. Real-Time Analysis of the Impact of IFITM3 on HIV-1 Cell-to-Cell Spread To further document the effect of IFITM3, we performed a dynamic analysis of viral spread, using HIV-1 encoding an IRES GFP cassette (Wildum et al., 2006) . Infected SupT1 cells were mixed with target SupT1 cells expressing an RFP marker. Cells were then plated in microdishes coated with fibronectin and visualized by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy with images acquired every 5 min for up to 60 hr. Representative examples of viral spread, in the absence of IFITM3 or with IFITM3 expressed in both donors and targets, are shown in Movie S1. Time-lapse analysis showed that in the absence of IFITM3, HIV-1 efficiently spread to new targets, measured as double GFP+ RFP+ objects (Figures 2A and S2A ). IFITM3 significantly impaired viral propagation, with a 4-fold decrease in the number of newly infected target cells after 60 hr of continuous coculture ( Figure 2A ). As expected, an Env-defective virus (HIV-1DEnv) did not spread to new recipients (Figure 2A) , and Nevirapine abrogated viral replication (data not shown). Cells were interrogated at the end of the coculture by flow cytometry to confirm the effect of IFITM3 on viral spread ( Figure S2B ). We then visually scored the appearance of syncytia, identified as giant GFP+RFP+ cells eventually displaying bubble-like membrane extensions ( Figure 2C ). IFITM3 strongly decreased the number of syncytia observed, a phenomenon previously attributed to IFITM proteins in the context of other viruses (Li et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013) (Figures 2B and 2C) . Image extraction at different time points demonstrated that in the presence of IFITM3, infected donor GFP+ cells formed clusters with target RFP+ cells, but in most cases these structures did not lead to cell fusion ( Figures 2B  and 2C) . We also performed a time-lapse microscopy analysis of viral spread when IFITM3 was induced in donors or in targets alone. The main antiviral effect was observed when IFITM3 was present in the donor cells ( Figure S2C ). Therefore, the inhibitory effect of IFITM3 on HIV-1 cell-to-cell transmission is associated with a significant decrease of fusion between infected and target cells, suggesting a decrease in virus production from infected cells and/or a defect in the fusion capacity of membranes present at cell-cell contacts.
