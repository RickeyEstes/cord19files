The ability of different proteinase inhibitors to suppress multicycle Sindbis virus replication in cultured cells was studied in preliminary experiments. For this purpose cell monolayers were primarily infected with a low virus dose (10 -4 PFU/ceI1) and incubated with antiproteinase-containing medium. After incubation, the medium was removed and infected cells were processed for analysis of protein synthesis. Three patterns of polypeptide synthesis could be expected from such experiments. First, the virus replication might fail to be suppressed by the proteinase inhibitor; the monolayer, therefore, would be totally infected due to an effective multicycle virus replication, and the synthesis of virus proteins would be revealed. Second, the antiproteinase agent may suffer virus replication without concomitant toxicity for the host cells; host cell protein synthesis would be detected in these samples. Third, cell monolayer might be damaged by toxic concentrations of the proteinase inhibitors and in this case p?otein synthesis would be markedly reduced or even abolished. The results of a typical experiment are represented in Fig. 1 . Lines 2-4 ( Fig. 1A ) show virus protein synthesis during the course of infection. Host protein synthesis was virtually shut off and the synthesis of virus non-structural B (M w 110 kDa), nsPs (85 kDa and 78 kDa) and structural E1 (59 kDa), PE2 (62 kDa), E2 (55 kDa) and C (28 kDa) polypeptides dominated in cell culture up to 13.5 h postinfection (Fig. 1A, line 4) . This result indicates that multicycle replication of Sindbis virus in CEC leads to a total infection of the monolayer. It is also seen that TLCK and aprotinin-C did not induce visible antiviral activity and synthesis of the main virus proteins was clearly detected in cell monolayers incubated with high concentrations of these inhibitors (Fig. 1 A; lines 5-7, 13-15). In contrast, aprotinin-G at a concentration of 1000 KIU/ml or higher demonstrated a marked reduction cf ',irus-specific protein synthesis (Fig. 1A , lines 11,12). Aprotinin-G had no toxicity for the cells and did not suppress host protein synthesis at a concentration up to 104 KIU/ml (data not shown). More detailed experiments were designed to study the antiviral activity of TPCK which has been reported to have alkylating activity [17, 22] , thus could be toxic for cells. The results of these experiments are demonstrated in Fig. 1B ,C. It can be seen that TPCK concentrations up to 2-5-5.0 p,M did not cause antiviral activity; at concentrations of 7.5-12.5 gM, TPCK markedly reduced virus polypeptide synthesis without affecting host cell synthesis. Initial toxicity resulting in a decrease of protein synthesis was observed at 22.5 p,M TPCK and extensive cell damage was seen at concentrations of 25 laM or more (Fig. 1B, line 11; Fig. IC, lines 10-12) . It is also seen, that in samples where synthesis of virus polypeptides was reduced the synthesis of 75 kDa and 22 kDa host polypeptides was enhanced (Fig. 1B, lines 5-7) . Similar parallelism was denoted in cells treated by high concentrations of aprotinin-G ( Fig. 1 A, lines Table 1 ) and cells were processed to examine polypeptide synthesis. Cellular polypeptides synthesized were analyzed by electrophoresis in 10-15% gradient polyacrylamide gel. (Fig. IA, lines 5-7, 13-15 ). The data on the inhibition of virus protein synthesis by TPCK and aprotinin-G fully correlated with the results indicating a decrease of virus yield in culture fluid of antiproteinase-treated cells (see Table 1 of infection. These data confirmed that Sindbis virus replicated effectively in placebotreated mice. Almost complete inhibition of virus replication in brain and decrease of virus in blood of a majority of TPCK-treated mice was observed. On the third day after infection mean virus titers (log PFU/ml) in blood of placebo, aprotinin G, and TPCK-treated mice were 2.0 + 0.32, 1.2 __+ 0.16, and 0.95 + 0.21, respectively. Statistical significance of virus titer reductions in blood of TPCKotreated mice is P> 0.95. Mean virus titer in brain of control and TPCK-treated mice on day 5 of infection was 4.5 _ 0.58 and 1.2 + 0.53, respectively (mean values for three independent experiments); and this decrease was statistically significant (P> 0.999). A clear antiviral effect was observed at a TPCK dose of about 20 lag/mouse per day (Fig. 2) , whereas a less prominent effect was seen with TPCK at 5 lag/mouse per day (data not shown). The primary non-lethal toxic symptoms (such as hypothermia, reduced weight gain, etc.) were found to occur at TPCK doses of 80-100 lag/mouse per day (data not shown). Aprotinin-G did not cause reduction in the overall virus yield in mouse brain. However, aprotinin-G delayed virus replication in brain and brought about a slight reduction of viraemia (see Fig. 2 ).
