On light microscopic examination, the muscle cells of the control pigs (group C) were seen to be in close apposition to one another. They were filled with myofibrils showing a regular cross-striation which was perpendicular to the long axis of the cells. There was almost no extramyofibrillar space (EMS). The cell nuclei were all at the periphery of the cells [ Fig. 1 (a)] and were 8 to 11 pm long and approximately 4 pm wide. On PAS staining, fine bands of PASpositive material were seen between the myofibrils. These were more pronounced in the younger animals than in the 2-and 3-days-old pigs. In the muscles of the pigs with clinical splayleg (group A) in contrast, there was an interstitial space of variable width. The space was very wide in the splayleg animals at 24 h of age, whereas in the 3-and 4-days-old splayleg animals it was much reduced. Myofibrils filled only part of the sarcoplasm in all splayleg pigs, leaving a significant EMS [ Fig. 1 (b) ]. The extent of the EMS varied from pig to pig and from muscle to muscle. Nevertheless, the M. adductor often appeared to be most severely affected. There was no difference in the size and shape of the muscle cells and the muscle cell' nuclei between splayleg animals and control animals. In contrast, the cross-striation of the muscle cells was remarkably different. In the splayleg animals, this crossstriation was often irregular and not perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the cells. There also was more PAS-positive material in the muscle cells of the pigs with splayleg. This was most striking in the 24 h age groups. The pig that had recovered from splayleg had muscles that were similar in light microscopic aspects to those of the control pigs [ Fig. 1 (c)l. The experimental pigs (group D) all had myofibrillar hypoplasia, which on the whole seemed to be slightly less pronounced than in the natural splayleg cases. In the experimental pigs the intercellular space was moderately increased compared with the controls. The cross-striations of the myofibrils were more regular than in the pigs, with splayleg [ Fig. 1 (d) ]. These lesions seemed to be most prominent in the M. adductor. On PAS staining, the EMS contained only a faint, scattered PAS-positive reaction. In semi-thin sections of blocks treated with potassium hexacyanoferrate, the EMS appeared empty. Histochemical and enzyme-histochemical examination of muscles yielded the following results. Succinic dehydrogenase activity was slightly higher in splayleg muscles. Acid pre-incubated ATPase activity was high in type 1 muscle cells and low in type 2 muscle cells. The newborn pig with splayleg had only few type 1 fibres in its muscles; the control animal had more type 1 muscle fibres. These were homogeneously scattered between the type 2 fibres. The animal that had recovered from splayleg had more type 1 fibres. Cholinesterase activity was limited to the neuromuscular endplates. These endplates (essentially the post-synaptic part) were demonstrated as brown to black dots situated on the edge of the muscle fibres. The endplates were found in groups of 4 to 10. There was no difference in the staining or in the localization of these endplates between the affected, the recovered and the nonaffected pig. Acridine orange staining produced a green fluorescence of muscle cell nuclei and an orange fluorescence of the cytoplasm. The nuclear fluorescence was simiiar for all muscles of all three pigs (groups A, B and C). The cytoplasmic fluorescence was intense in the muscles of the pig with splayleg, indicating a high concentration of RNA in the sarcoplasm [ Fig. 2(a) ]. In contrast, the recovered pig had a low sarcoplasmic fluorescence. The control pig had a faint positive sarcoplasmic fluorescence [ Fig. 2 (b) ] . At the ultrastructural level, the muscles of the control pig appeared normal. The cytoplasm of the muscle cells was almost completely filled with myofilament bundles which showed a regular banding with well delineated Z-lines, approximately 8 nm wide. The A-band was approximately 1.65 pm wide. Between the myofilament bundles, small groups of y-glycogen particles and rows of lipid droplets were regularly seen. Occasional lysosomes were seen to contain a few y-glycogen particles. With phosphotungstic acid staining, the endomysium was seen to consist of coiled collagen fibres. Electron microscopy of the muscles of the splayleg animal revealed that the myofilament bundles filled only part of the cytoplasm. The A-band had a mean length of 1.50 urn. The Z-band consisted of Z-band material, streaming Z-lines and irregular Z-lines approximately 10.8 nm wide. M-lines were often ill-defined. Splitting of myofilament bundles was frequently observed. Ribosome-studded thick (myosin) filaments were often seen obliquely tangential to a myofilament bundle (Fig. 3) . Outside the myohlament bundles, the sarcoplasm contained an EMS which was delineated by the sarcolemma. After 1 (c) Ten-day-old pig, recovered from splayleg. The interstitium contains only empty capillaries (1). Muscle cell cross-striation is clearly defined. l(d) Pig born (24 h) after experimental dexamethasone treatment of the sow. The interstitial space (1) and the extramyofibrillar space (2) potassium hexacyanoferrate treatment, the EMS was seen to be filled almost completely with y-glycogen particles (Fig. 4) . In the sarcoplasm surrounding the peripherally located muscle cell nuclei, various organelles were present. These were mainly mitochondria, cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes and occasional Golgi cisternae. Lysosomes were also found between the glycogen particles of the EMS. In the EMS, groups of glycogen particles were regularly seen to be sequestrated in membrane-bounded organelles neighbouring the lysosomes (Fig. 4) . Occasional fusion of lysosomes with the glycogencontaining organelles was seen. T-tubules were small and irregular. The endomysium was composed of coiled collagen fibres as in the control animal. There was a wide extracellular space containing scarce collagen fibrils. In the lo-day-old pig that had recovered from splayleg, there was almost no EMS. Glycogen was demonstrated with the potassium hexacyanoferrate technique as small rims of y-particles between the myofilament bundles and under the sarcolemma. Occasional secondary lysosomes and residual bodies were present. The A bands had a mean length of 1.65 pm and Z-lines were approximately 9 nm wide. Occasional lipid droplets were present between the myofilament bundles. The ultrastructure of the muscles of the pig born after dexamethasone treatment of the sow was in many aspects similar to that of the muscles of the pig with natural splayleg. There was a wide EMS and so the myofilament bundles filled only part of the sarcoplasm. A-bands had a mean length of I.55 urn and Z-lines were approximately 10 nm wide but were nevertheless clearly defined, as were the M-lines. Occasional splitting of myofilament bundles was seen. With potassium hexacyanoferrate, it was shown that the EMS only contained a few scattered y-glycogen particles. In contrast, membrane-bounded organelles in the EMS were seen to contain many yglycogen particles (Fig. 5) . With phosphotungstic acid staining, the limiting membranes of these organelles were shown to be characteristic of lysosomal membranes. Outside the EMS, other organelles appeared normal. T-tubules were small and irregular. The extracellular space was moderately widened.
