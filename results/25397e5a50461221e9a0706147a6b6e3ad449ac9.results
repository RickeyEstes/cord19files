Our MERS-CoV case-occurrence data set reflected a clear concentration of cases in Saudi Arabia (that is, among Middle Eastern cases only; Fig. 1 ), although a few cases have been detected in neighboring countries (United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Jordan, Iran). This concentration was reflected in the ecological niche model outputs (Fig. 2) : the model based on reported camel exposure showed highest suitability in the northeastern and southwestern parts of the Arabian Peninsula, as well as adjacent areas of southwestern Asia and northeastern Africa. The model based on all occurrences, on the other hand, identified a broader suitable area across the central portion of the Arabian Peninsula and adjacent areas of Asia and Africa. High uncertainty in these predictions, in both cases, coincided with areas of high modeled suitability (Fig. 2) , such that confidence in model predictions is not uniformly high. The outputs of the two ecological niche models contrasted in their spatial predictions across the study region. Figure 3 shows the difference between the two outputs: the model based on camel exposures emphasized the northern and southern coastal parts of the Arabian Peninsula, and de-emphasized the central and western parts. Clearly, the two models emphasize different regions, which reflects different environmental Fig. 2 Visualization of ecological niche model outputs in terms of median prediction of suitability for MERS-CoV transmission to humans (left column; light orange low suitability, dark orange high suitability), and the uncertainty associated with those predictions estimated as the range of suitability values (pixel by pixel) among the 10 bootstrapped random replicate models (right column; white low uncertainty, black high uncertainty). Dots represent camel-exposed cases; X's represent any case occurrence regimes underlying the occurrence data that drive the model outputs. To explore relative niche breadths of models based on reported camel exposure versus the broader suite of possible exposure regimes that could produce MERS-CoV cases, we developed detailed comparisons of ecological niche breadths. That is, we applied 10 % omission thresholds of 0.05357 for models based on camel exposures, and 0.02958 for models based on all occurrences (note that these thresholds are driven by the relationship between calibration data and model outputs) to convert the two to binary models. We then related these two predictions to annual mean temperature and annual precipitation via the random points across the study region. The rarefied points for annual mean temperature in the camel-based model had a standard deviation of 40.5, whereas those for the model based on any occurrence ranged 49.0-50.2; for annual precipitation, the camel-based model had a standard deviation of 94.7, whereas those for the anyoccurrence model ranged 236.2-253.1 (Fig. 4) . Hence, with respect to both temperature and precipitation, the diversity of environments indicated as suitable based on camel-based exposures was significantly less than the diversity of environments so identified based on all occurrences (P < 0.01, in both cases).
