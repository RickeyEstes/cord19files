To determine if mPEG-modification of RSV inhibited viral infection, we initially performed plaque assays with 5 kDa CmPEG. As shown in Fig. 1A , CmPEG-modification of RSV decreased the number of syncytia in a dose-dependent manner. To determine if linker chemistry influenced the anti-viral efficacy, we investigated the effects of 5 kDa SC-and SVAmPEG on syncytia formation (Fig. 1A) . As noted, both SCmPEG and SVAmPEG resulted in a dosedependent decrease in the number of syncytia. However, relative to Cm-and SCmPEG, SVAmPEG resulted in significantly greater inhibition of RSV infection at all grafting concentrations (p < 0.026) with the exception of 15 mM where all linker chemistries yielded nearly complete protection. Importantly, as demonstrated by the insert in Fig. 1A , binding of mPEG-modified RSV to the target cells is dramatically decreased as determined by immunofluorescence staining 90 min post-challenge at 4 C (to prevent internalization). To evaluate the effect of polymer length on RSV inactivation, we compared 2 and 5 kDa SCmPEG, and 2, 5 and 20 kDa SVAmPEG (Fig. 1B) . With all polymer lengths and linker chemistries examined, grafting of mPEG resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the number of syncytia. Comparing the two polymer lengths containing the SC linker chemistry, the 2 kDa mPEG was superior to the 5 kDa chain at grafting concentrations of 5, 7.5, and 12.5 mM (p < 0.012). Importantly, at both 7.5, 12.5 and 15 mM grafting concentrations, the 2 kDa SCmPEG virtually abolished RSV infection while the 5 kDa SCmPEG did not. The SVA-linker chemistry provided superior protection at the lower grafting concentrations at all three molecular weights (2, 5, and 20 kDa; Fig. 1B ). While some statistical advantage (p < 0.025) was seen with the 2 and 5 kDa polymers over the 20 kDa SVAmPEG at the 5 mM grafting concentration, this was not thought to be of biologic significance. Importantly, at high mPEG grafting concentrations (!12.5 mM) all SVAmPEG species completely prevented RSV infection and propagation. To determine the efficacy of this anti-viral prophylactic approach, the effect of polymer grafting to RSV was assessed over a broad range of MOI. Virus MOI ranging from 0.5 to 0.01 were modified with 2 or 20 kDa SVAmPEG for HeLa cell challenge (Fig. 2) . As shown, at the very high MOI of 0.5, low grafting concentrations of SVAmPEG (2 mM) of either the 2 or 20 kDa polymers were ineffective at preventing viral invasion. However, as grafting concentration increased (!5 mM) a dose-dependent decrease in viral infection was noted with a near complete abrogation of infection at !12.5 mM. Interestingly, at the 7.5 mM grafting concentration at an MOI of 0.5, the 2 kDa mPEG polymer was significantly (p < 0.006) more effective at preventing viral infection than the 20 kDa chain ( Fig. 2A) . As the MOI decreased, the relative dose-dependent efficacy of mPEG grafting increased due to a greater polymer to virus ratio (i.e., more chains per viral particle). An interesting finding was that, as a general trend, RSV modification with short chain polymers (2 kDa) provided improved antiviral efficacy over long (20 kDa) chain polymers, especially at lower grafting concentrations (e.g., MOI 0.05 and 0.01 at 2 mM grafting concentration; p < 0.007). At higher RSV grafting concentrations (!12.5 mM), both polymer lengths yielded nearly complete protection against viral infection at all MOI. Across all MOI examined, a grafting concentration of 7.5 mM produced the most dramatic decrease in infection per unit (mM) of mPEG. To demonstrate that viral PEGylation does not simply disrupt the virus particles, TEM studies were conducted. As shown in Fig. 3 , TEM qualitative studies of unmodified (0 mM) and mPEG-modified (2, 7.5 and 15 mM) rgRSV showed no differences in the number of virus particles (data not shown) or RSV virion structure at any of the tested grafting concentrations. In agreement with previous reports, both unmodified and modified virus ranged in size from 150 to 300 nm [20] . Taken together, these findings indicate that mPEG grafting did not dramatically disrupt or alter the size of the RSV virion but did effectively prevent viral infection. Because RSV specifically infects polarized airway epithelial cells in vivo, and Vero and HeLa cells are unpolarized, we evaluated mPEG-modification of RSV in the polarized MDCK cell line. As shown in Fig. 4 , mPEG-modification (7.5 mM) of rgRSV significantly decreased the number of infected cells at both 24 and 48 h postinfection (p < 0.001). Furthermore, from 24 to 48 h, the number of infected cells in the 0 mM control increased dramatically, while no significant increase was noted in cells challenged with mPEGmodified virus. This finding suggests that the virions that managed to infect the cells did not generate significant numbers of progeny to overcome the initial reduction in infection. While direct PEGylation of virus particles is possible under certain circumstances (e.g., blood derived products such as red cells, platelets and plasma), it is less biologically useful for respiratory viruses such as RSV. However, induction of an anti-viral barrier by the direct PEGylation of the target cells (e.g., nasal epithelial cell) of the virus would be of significant clinical utility. To determine if activated mPEG resulted in uniform derivatization of cell monolayers, HeLa cells were PEGylated using a mixture of 5% fluorescein-labeled 20 kDa mPEG and 95% unlabeled 20 kDa mPEG and examined by light and fluorescent microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5 , light microscopy demonstrated that control and mPEG-modified cells exhibited normal morphology. Fluorescent microscopy of the mPEG-modified cells demonstrated uniform fluorescence and increased with mPEG grafting concentration. This result indicates that the polymer grafted to the cell surface in a dose-dependent fashion. Given that the cells were modified with only 5% fluorescein-labeled mPEG it is likely that the cell surface is significantly modified. Furthermore, trypan blue staining of the cell layer demonstrated !98% viability 48 h post-modification. Flow cytometric studies of propidium iodide stained cells also demonstrated no significant decrease from initial viability levels over 24 h incubation post-modification at any mPEG (maximum of 15 mM) grafting concentration (data not shown). To assess the anti-viral efficacy of host cell modification, cells were differentially modified with 2 or 20 kDa SVAmPEG and challenged with unmodified rgRSV at MOI of 0, 0.01., 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5. As shown in Fig. 6 , the 2 kDa polymer was ineffective at any MOI or grafting concentration. Thus, while directly grafting the 2 kDa polymer to RSV effectively inhibited infection, the same polymer when grafted to host cells had no anti-viral effect suggesting that it was incapable of camouflaging the viral receptor. In dramatic contrast, the 20 kDa polymer demonstrated significant anti-viral prophylaxis at all MOI and in a mPEG dose-dependent manner. As noted, even at a very high and non-biologic MOI (0.5; Fig. 6A ) very significant reductions in infection are noted at 20 kDa polymer grafting concentrations of !5 mM. At a more biologically relevant MOI of 0.01 (Fig. 6D) , host cell grafting concentrations of !5 mM of the 20 kDa polymer yielded almost complete protection against viral infection. Importantly, at all MOI, grafting concentrations of !5 mM of the 20 kDa mPEG to the target cells resulted in a significant decrease in viral infection relative to the positive control (0 mM) over the entire 96 h incubation period. This suggests that mPEG grafting to the host cells both dramatically inhibited the initial viral invasion and also prevented the spread of infection by progeny virus. This is important, as it indicates that the grafted mPEG barrier remains intact over the 96 h incubation time. Moreover, at the lower MOI (i.e., 0.01) which approximated a natural inoculation dose, our findings indicated that mPEG-modification of host cells would reduce or completely prevent infection in vivo. As previously discussed, RSV preferentially infects polarized epithelial cells in vivo. To confirm our findings in non-polarized cells, the anti-viral effect of membrane grafting of the 20 kDa SVAmPEG (7.5 mM) to polarized MDCK cells was assessed. As demonstrated in Fig. 7 , a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in rgRSV infection was observed. Indeed, relative to control (0 mM) infections, reductions of 80% and 95% were seen at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Furthermore, while the number of infected cells doubled between 24 and 48 h in the 0 mM control, there was no increase in the level of infection with the 7.5 mM grafting concentration. Indeed, a slight decrease in the number of infected cells was observed -most likely due to death of the initially infected cells. This finding, as with non-polarized HeLa cells, demonstrated that the mPEG anti-viral barrier on the host cell surface was stable and able to inhibit infection by any progeny virus, thereby preventing secondary infections. These findings suggest that the mPEGmodification of the nasal epithelial cells may be capable of producing a highly effective anti-viral barrier.
