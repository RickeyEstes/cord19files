Identification of novel bat paramyxovirus B16-40. In this study, 232 bat samples were collected at 48 sites from natural bat habitats and tested for the possible existence of paramyxoviruses (Supplementary Table S1 ). Based on the RT-semi-nested PCR using the consensus paramyxovirus primers targeting the RdRp region 19 , five samples were positive and confirmed to be bat paramyxoviruses by sequencing. B16-6 was from a urine sample of Miniopterus schreibersii at BT cave in Hapcheon in March 2016, and B16-40 was from a feces sample of Miniopterus schreibersii at G cave in Danyang in April 2016. B16-148 and B16-154 were from feces samples of Murina ussuriensis at OJ cave in Youngwol and at S cave in Pyungchang in July 2016, respectively. B16-230 was from a urine sample of Miniopterus schreibersii at BLR cave in Seogwipo in December 2016. Among these, one paramyxovirus (B16-40) was successfully isolated. The isolated virus, bat paramyxovirus B16-40, was isolated from the Korean bat Miniopterus schreibersii. The virus was successfully cultivated after three blind passages in the MARC-145 cell line (Fig. 1) , which is a clone of the MA-104 cell line derived from kidney epithelial cells of an African green monkey 20 . Viral particles were observed in a pellet of infected MARC-145 cells under a transmission electron microscope (Fig. 1B) . In terms of viral growth, infectious viruses were increased in the culture supernatant and infected cells from 24 hours post inoculation (hpi) and were consistently released for 144 hpi, as measured using tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) method (Fig. 1C ). Infectivity in C57BL/6 mice. When 6-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were inoculated via the intranasal and intragastric routes with 10 5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID) 50 /mL or 10 2.5 TCID 50 /mL of bat paramyxovirus B16-40, we found no evidence of infection, i.e. no viral shedding, histopathological findings, or seroconversion. Characterization of the bat paramyxovirus B16-40. Using high throughput sequencing (HiSeq. 2000 sequencing system based on the transcriptome de novo sequencing platform), 23,336 contigs totaling 8,010,635 base pairs (bps) with an average length of 343 bps were obtained. In the taxonomy annotation with MG-RAST, 12,522 contigs were annotated. While most of the annotated sequences associated with eukaryotes, 13 sequences were associated with family Paramyxoviridae. The 17,771 bases of viral genomic sequences were obtained by RT-PCR using primers designed based on the Paramyxoviridae-associated contigs and RACE sequencing. The genomic sequence of the virus encodes 8 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) ( Fig. 2A) , which is consistent with bat paramyxovirus strain Ms-ParaV/Anhui2011 (KC154054) 13 . In addition, maximum-likelihood trees showed that the bat paramyxovirus B16-40 strain was closely related to the bat paramyxovirus Ms-ParaV/Anhui2011 (KC154054) and BtMI-ParaV/QH2013 (KJ641657) strains rather than Beilong virus, J-virus, and Tailam virus (Figs 2B and S1). Even though the HN amino acids sequences were similar to those from viruses in the proposed genera Shaanvirus, it was also related to that of Sendai virus and human parainfluenza virus 1, which belong to a different genus, Respirovirus showing (Table 1) . Based on the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, the bat paramyxovirus isolates and other Korean bat paramyxoviruses belong to the genus Shaanvirus, with 68.8-79.0% nucleotide similarities (Fig. 2C ). This suggests a single, closely related group of paramyxoviruses circulating in Korea. Consistent with the genetic findings, the bat paramyxovirus B16-40 was found to have haemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities in the haemadsorption assay (0.5% chicken red blood cells in PBS (pH 7.4)) and neuraminidase assay, respectively (Fig. 3 ).
