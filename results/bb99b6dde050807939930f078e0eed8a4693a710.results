Regarding the studies, different peptides usually get different scores/ranks in different analyses. This inconsistency indicates that these results needed to be analyzed with an integrated approach. Indeed, integrated approach is more practical and efficient in such conditions in comparison with analysis by analysis filtering approach, in which those epitopes are chosen for the next analysis that have gotten an acceptable score in the previous analysis. Herein, the integrated approach was applied in both steps of epitope selection. Since the ultimate goal of the discovery of therapeutic epitopes is to use them in human vaccines, only the scores/ranks of human alleles were used to rank epitopes in some studies. However, investigators usually test therapeutic vaccines on mouse species in preclinical trials, thus in the current study, the binding status of the predicted epitopes to mouse MHC-I alleles was also studied by several binding predictors and molecular docking, as well. As stated above, CTL-mediated responses play a crucial role in killing the malignant cells. Besides, the binding of epitopes to MHC-I molecules is the most selective step for antigen presentation to CTLs. Therefore, in the first step, the selection was made primarily by the comparison of obtained MHC-I binding, processing and immunogenicity scores/ranks, and population coverage percentages. However, the MHC-II binding ranks were actually of secondary importance to the selection process as an added advantage. Additionally, the population coverage has a dual application. First, it determines the coverage of a given peptide in the target population. Second, it is the best index for summarizing and evaluating of the HLA-I binding predictions too, since it is calculated from the results of HLA-I binding prediction analyses. In the first step, ten peptides (Tables 3-5 ) from each HPV genotype oncoprotein (120 peptides in total), which got better results in the first step analyses were selected for the second step analyses, including protein-peptide molecular docking, epitope conservation, and crossreactivity with host antigens. The individual detailed results of the MHC-I and II binding (S3 File), MHC-I immunogenicity (S4 File) and MHC-I population coverage (S5 File) predictions, as well as, MHC-I and II molecular docking (S6 File) and epitope conservation (S7 File) analyses are given in supporting information, as 15 Excel files. Indeed, CABS-dock returns ten representative medoids as the best-simulated models and ranks them by cluster density (CD). Cluster density is derived from two factors (the number of elements in a cluster and their average ligand RMSD) that is an advantage for this server. In the second step, five peptides out of ten selected peptides in the first step (Tables 6-8) , which got better results in all analyses of both steps, were selected as the final-predicted epitopes. None of the final predicted epitopes showed more than 90% sequence similarity with mouse and human proteomes.
