2.1. Co-expression of nsp3C and nsp4 induces redistribution from the ER to concentrated foci in the perinuclear region In previous reports, co-expression of SARS-CoV nsp4 with the Cterminal one-third of nsp3 (nsp3C) in the cell was shown to redistribute these proteins from the ER to concentrated foci in the perinuclear region (Hagemeijer et al., 2011) . To confirm this redistribution of the proteins, we constructed the expression plasmids pCAG nsp4-HA and pCAG nsp3C-3xFLAG carrying an HA-tag and 3xFLAG tag in the C-termini of each protein, respectively (Fig. 1A) . Subcellular localization of nsp4 and nsp3C in 293T cells transfected with pCAG nsp4-HA and/or pCAG nsp3C-3xFLAG was determined by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. Although nsp3C and nsp4 were localized in the ER when expressed individually, both nsp3C and nsp4 were detected in discrete foci in the perinuclear region in cells upon co-expression ( Fig. 2A , B top panel), confirming that coexpression of nsp4 with nsp3C of SARS-CoV induces redistribution of the proteins from the ER to concentrated foci in the perinuclear region.
