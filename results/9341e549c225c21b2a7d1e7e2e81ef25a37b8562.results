The attendees generated 102 recommendations for the NHII action agenda. As anticipated, recommendations from each breakout track were not limited to the topical focus originally identified for that track, but reflected the interdependence of key issues. The final clustering of recommendations resulted in 12 categories in four major topic areas: (1) management; (2) enablers; (3) implementation strategy; and (4) domains ( Table 2 ).
