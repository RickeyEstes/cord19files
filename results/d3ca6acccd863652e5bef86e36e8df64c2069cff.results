The serological status and antibody titers of the tested animals were detected by a serum neutralization assay. In the population (n: 94) (Tables 4 and 5) over 96% of the calves were found to be seropositive against BRSV, with changing levels of antibody titers during all sampling periods. The number of PI-3 seropositive calves was increased between the 1st and 2nd months and then a decline occurred up to the 6th month; the number of seropositive calves then began to increase again between the 6th and 8th months. The number of calves seropositive for BHV-1 declined up to the 6th month and then exhibited an increase up to the end of the study. For BVDV, an increase in seropositivity was observed between the 1st and 2nd months, followed by a decrease in the seropositive calf number up to the 4th month. The number of BAV-3 seropositive calves started to decrease after the first month, though an increase was detected between months 6 and 8, and the number of BCoV seropositive calves started to decrease from month 2 and increased between months 6 and 10. With the exception of BRSV and BHV-1, changes in the antibody titers against the tested viruses were compatible with the number of seropositive calves (Table 5 ). In addition to the changes in the seropositivity rates an increase was detected in seroconverted (changed from seronegative to seropositive state) calf number mostly at 4th and 10th months of age (Table 6) . High numbers of seropositive animals among the dams were determined for all the viruses, except BHV-1. In the dam population, the seroprevalence of BRSV, PI-3, BHV-1, BVDV, BAV-3 and BCoV was 100%, 93.2%, 35.9%, 96.6%, 96.6% and 93.2%, respectively (Table 7) . Based on the number of seropositive calves; enterprise size, correlation between the dam's antibody status and maternally derived antibodies, and seasonal distributions of clinical signs were examined. There were no significant differences detected among the large-, medium-and small-scale enterprises with regard to BRSV, BAV-3 and BCoV infections (p > 0.05). However, a significant difference was determined for PI-3 and BHV-1 between the large-and medium-scale enterprises. There were also significant variations for BVDV between the large-and mediumscale enterprises as well as the large-and small-scale enterprises (p < 0.005). Positive correlations for the transfer of maternally derived antibodies from dam to calf were determined for most of the viruses, except BCoV (BRSV r = 0.241, p = 0.015; PI-3 r = 0.483, p < 0.001; BHV-1 r = 0.574, p = 0.001; BVDV r = 0.264, p = 0.007; BAV-3 r = 0.248, p = 0.012; BCoV r = 0.04132, p = 0.752). An examination of the seasonal distributions of the clinical signs showed that respiratory viral infections are most common in autumn followed by winter, summer, and then spring (p < 0.001) ( Table 3) .
