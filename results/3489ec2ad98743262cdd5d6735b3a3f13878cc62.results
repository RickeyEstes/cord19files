Characterization of Huh7.5 cells stably expressing human ISG20 and a related, catalytically inactive mutant ISG20 To determine how ISG20 affects HCV replication in hepatocytes, we developed Huh7.5 cells that stably express human ISG20 (designated as 7.5-ISG20) and as controls, cells expressing the catalytically inactive, D94G mutant ISG20 that is deficient in exonucleasae activity (Nguyen et al., 2001 ) (designated as 7.5-ISG20m) and those expressing the empty vector (designated as 7.5-Bsr), respectively, using retroviral-mediated gene transfer. Huh7.5 cells represent an Huh7 subline that is highly permissive for HCV replication (Blight et al., 2002) . In addition, Huh7 derived cells are susceptible to many RNA viruses of distinct viral families Guix et al., 2007; Hattermann et al., 2005; Keskinen et al., 1999; Lohmann et al., 1999; Muller et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2005; Yi and Lemon, 2002) . By establishing Huh7.5 cells stably expressing ISG20/ISG20m, we were able to evaluate the effect of this ISG on replication of many different viruses. To eliminate phenotypic differences derived from variations among individual cell clones, we utilized stable cell pools instead of clonal cell lines. The ectopically expressed ISG20 (Fig. 1A ) and ISG20m (data not shown) were distributed in both nucleus and cytoplasm, and could be readily detected in 7.5-ISG20 and 7.5-ISG20m cells by immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed either against the myc epi-tag that was introduced at the C-terminus of ISG20 (Fig. 1B, upper panel) or against the ISG20 protein itself (lower panel), but not in the control vector expressing 7.5-Bsr cells. Although they were stably expressed at high levels ( Fig. 1C ), ISG20 and ISG20m did not alter growth characteristics of Huh7.5 cells (Fig. 1D , compare 7.5-ISG20 and 7.5-ISG20m vs 7.5-Bsr cells), nor did they affect the RIG-I signaling defect in Huh7.5 cells (Sumpter et al., 2005) as determined by the absence of ISG56 induction following Sendai virus infection, irrespective of ISG20/ ISG20m expression status (Fig. 1E , compare lanes 3, 5, and 7 vs 9).
