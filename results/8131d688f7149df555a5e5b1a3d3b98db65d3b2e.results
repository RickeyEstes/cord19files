Cumulative numbers of cases and deaths are illustrated in Figure 1 . An increase in the number of deaths is delayed as compared to that in cases. Figure 2 A and 2B show the estimates of the risk of death using the abovementioned method. The most recent estimate of the CFR in the Republic of Korea appeared to be 20.0% (95% CI: 14.6, 26.2). During the course of the outbreak, the crude ratios of deaths to cases without accounting for the time delay from illness onset to death was smaller than our delay-adjusted estimates ( Figure 2A) . Estimate of the CFR in real time appeared to have decreased and become significantly lower than 40% ( Figure 2B ). The most up-to-date CFR among those aged 60 years or older was estimated at 39.5% (95% CI: 28.9, 51.0), while that among those aged from 0-59 years was as small as 6.6% (95% CI: 2.9, 12.4).
