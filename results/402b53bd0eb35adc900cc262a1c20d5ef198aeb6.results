A total of 28 laboratory-confirmed influenza A H5 cases were detected in 2004 from 15 provinces of Vietnam; 21 (75%) were fatal. All 28 cases were RT-PCR positive for influenza A subtype H5 at either the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Hanoi, or the Pasteur Institute, Ho Chi Minh City; H5N1 virus was isolated in 12. The diagnosis of influenza A H5 infection was independently confirmed for 25: 20 at a WHO reference laboratory and 5 at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Vietnam. The interviews began on February 7, 2004, at which time 20 of the 28 case-patients had already been identified. The interval between onset of illness and interview was a mean of 35.7 days; the maximum interval was 63 days. The mean age of case-patients was 14 years (range 1-31 years, median 15 years), and 9 (32%) patients were children <10 years of age. The numbers of male and female case-patients were equal (14 each). Among confirmed case-patients were 2 family clusters (mother and daughter and 2 sisters). A total of 106 control-respondents were enrolled, 4 per case-patient, except for 3 case-patients aged <5 years for whom only 1, 2, and 3 control-respondents could be recruited per case, respectively. All controlrespondents were negative for avian influenza A H5-specific RNA by RT-PCR and for anti-H5 antibodies by microneutralization assay. None of the case-patients or control-respondents worked in the commercial (industrial) poultry-raising sector. The results of matched-pair analysis are shown in Table 1 . Direct handling of sick or dead poultry in the 7 days before onset of illness had the strongest point estimate of effect (matched OR 31) and high statistical significance (p<0.001) despite wide confidence limits (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4-1150). The presence of sick or dying poultry in the household (matched OR 7.4, 95% CI 2.7-59) or neighborhood (matched OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.0-55.7) was also statistically associated with infection as was the absence of an indoor water source in the household (matched OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.3-77.0) and education to high school level or higher (matched OR 16.0, 95% CI 1.2-594.1). Eight variables with p≤0.2 were considered for inclusion in the conditional logistic regression model to estimate independence of effects. Although significantly associated with infection in the single-variable analysis, the presence of sick or dead poultry in the neighborhood was excluded from the final regression model because missing data for this variable led to the exclusion of 36 participants (6 case-patients and 30 control-respondents). Educational level was excluded because it was not a relevant variable for the 13 case-patients <15 years of age. Because of the 2 family clusters, each comprising 2 casepatients, the influence of clustering of household-level factors on the regression model was investigated by running the regression model first with all cases and then again including only 1 case from each of these 2 households. All 4 variations of 1 case from each household were run. Because the outcomes of these different approaches did not differ, all cases were included in the final model. The final conditional logistic regression model included 3 variables as independent risk factors for H5N1 infection (Table 2) . Of the 28 case-patients, 16 (57%) had either sick or dead poultry in their household or had directly prepared sick or dead poultry for consumption; another 6 reported sick or dead poultry in the neighborhood. Of the 28 case-patients, 22 (79%) did not have an indoor water source. No statistically significant effect-measure modification was detected. Among persons who prepared sick or dead poultry for consumption, the proportion of H5N1 cases attributable to this practice (AR%) is estimated in this study to be 89% ([(8.99 -1)/8.99] × 100). However, because only 32% of all case-patients reported this practice, stopping this practice would prevent only an estimated 28% of H5N1 cases (PAR% = 0.89 × 0.32).
