From April 2013 to April 2017, 267 newborns were enrolled in the PRISM study including 64 born at <29 weeks of gestation or extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs), 84 late preterm (29-<36 weeks of gestation), and 119 term infants (³37 0/7 weeks of gestation). To be included in the analyses, subjects had to have had a minimum of 1 follow-up visit ³1 month after hospital discharge and ³1 illness visit with an accompanying parent reported COAST score and viral testing data. During the study period there were 208 active subjects, 118 subjects (Table I) , had a qualifying illness visit (1-12 per subject) resulting in a total of 346 illness visits. Of these, 303 visits (88%) had matching viral testing and parent reported COAST scorecards that form the basis of this report. Sixteen hospitalizations were included for 13 subjects; 89% of illness visits (269) with a matching COAST Scorecard reported ³3 days of illness symptoms and 70% had ³7-10 days of data. Twelve hospitalizations were in the ELGANS group, 2 in late preterm infants, and 2 in term infants with an overall hospitalization rate that was significantly higher in the ELGANS group (15.2%) than the late preterm (1.9%) or term infants (1.7%; P < .001; Table II) . There were 249 samples (82%) from the 303 illness visits that had a viral respiratory pathogen identified with 8 viral co-detections including 7 with RSV and hRV and 1 with hRV and human bocavirus ( Table II) . The rate of viral detection at illness visits was significantly greater than at well visits (383 of 1114 well visits [34%]; P < .001). The rate of pathogen detection at illness visits did not differ by gestational age group with 79% of illness visits in the ELGANS, 83% in the late preterm group, and 84% in the term cohort associated with the detection of a viral pathogen (P = .57). In contrast, a respiratory virus was detected at 28% of well visits in ELGANs, 36% in the late preterm group, and 38% of well visits in term babies, suggesting that babies born at <29 weeks of gestation are significantly less likely to have asymptomatic viral respiratory infections (P = .03). The preterm cohorts were also more likely to have rhinovirus-associated illness visits (47% ELGANS and 55% late preterm) than term (39%) infants (P = .05; Table II ). The percentage of illness visits associated with RSV infection was not different between the 3 groups (P = .84; Table II ). In the PRISM study, 75% of ELGANS and 10% of late preterm infants received palivizumab prophylaxis. Of the 79 illness visits in ELGANS, 10 were due to RSV. Four hospitalizations and 5 illness visits occurred in subjects who received palivizumab, with 1 RSV illness visit in an ELGANS subject who had not received palivizumab. Nine illness visits occurred in late preterm subjects who received palivizumab, none of which were due to RSV infection, whereas 15 RSV illness visits occurred in late preterm infants who did not receive palivizumab, 1 of which was associated with hospitalization (Table III ; available at www.jpeds.com). COAST Score Seven percent of illness visits had maximum COAST scores of £3, suggesting mild upper respiratory symptoms only. However, 39% of illnesses were associated with a maximal COAST score of >10, implying more severe disease. In general, ELGANS had a greater number of illness visits associated with higher scores (Figure 1) . LMER models were used to examine associations between the detection of viral infections as a measure of disease severity and either the maximal COAST score or the average AUC COAST score. Results focus on the maximum scores for ease of presentation as the maximum scores and average AUC scores provided similar results. We chose to examine the associations with RSV, hRV, and other viral infections because the original COAST study showed an association between the identification of a respiratory pathogen and illness severity. The models were repeated using hospitalization as an alternative measure of construct validity. The presence of RSV in the respiratory sample during an illness visit was positively associated with the COAST score in each model (Table IV and Table V [available at www. jpeds.com]). The detection of hRV was inversely associated with the COAST score (Tables IV and V) . Hospitalization was also positively associated with the COAST score (P < .001). African American race was consistently positively associated with the COAST score and gestational age at birth was inversely associated. Development of a New Severity Score, the IRRISS Based on the respiratory symptom components of the COAST scorecard, we next performed a factor analysis to develop a data-driven severity scoring system. The aim was to develop an alternative system to accurately summarize the contribution of each respiratory symptom to disease severity to determine if this approach would improve upon the COAST score. Using the new score the associations with viral infection and hospitalization were reexamined. When developing the new scoring system we initially explored individual associations of symptoms with one another to evaluate the biological plausibility of including each one of the symptoms in the new scoring system. A cluster dendrogram based on a dissimilarity matrix classified the symptoms into 2 main groups-those more associated with lower respiratory tract infection such as retractions and tachypnea compared with those consistent with upper respiratory tract infection (Figure 2 ; available at www. jpeds.com). Pearson c 2 test analyses identified the presence of retractions, tachypnea, and wheeze as significantly associated with hospitalization (Table VI ; available at www. jpeds.com). Cough was associated with the detection of RSV and hRV infection was associated with fever and a longer duration of illness (Table VI) . Viral infections other than hRV or RSV were also associated with fever and hoarseness. Next, a factor analysis was performed to compute weights for each of the 8 symptoms and to derive the new severity scoring system, the IRRISS, with a range of 9-14 ( Figure 3 ; available at www.jpeds.com). Repeating the LMER models using the IRRISS identified the presence of RSV infection and hospitalization to be positively associated with the IRRISS in both models (Table IV  and Table V) . Infection with hRV was inversely associated with the IRRISS when compared with all hRV-negative illness, visits which were predominantly due to RSV and other viral respiratory pathogens (Table VII ; available at www.jpeds.com). Gestational age at birth was also negatively associated with the IRRISS. When comparing the IRRISS and the COAST score, they were highly correlated (r = 0.93; P < .0001; Figure 4 ; available at www.jpeds.com). A sensitivity analysis was performed to confirm the associations between the IRRISS and COAST scores and hospitalization and specific viral infections with ELGANS subjects removed. RSV infection and hospitalization continued to be significantly associated with both the maximal COAST score and IRRISS with an inverse association with hRV infections. A family history of asthma was now significantly associated with the average AUC of the IRRISS in all analyses. Next, separate preterm and term infant severity scores were derived in a similar fashion as the IRRISS using factor analysis to determine if symptoms interacted differently between term and preterm infants. In the preterm cohort the COAST score, IRRISS and preterm factor score were consistently associated with RSV infection and hospitalization (P = .022 to P = .028 for RSV infection and P < .001 for hospitalization) and inversely associated with hRV infection (P = .002 to P = .002). Findings were not consistent when the full-term cohort was analyzed separately. There was an association between RSV infection and the maximal IRRISS score, but no association with the maximal COAST score or the maximal term factor score. Hospitalization was significantly associated with the COAST score, the average AUC of the term factor score and marginally significant with the average AUC of the IRRISS (P = .05) in term babies despite few hospitalizations in this cohort. No associations were noted for hRV. Despite these differences, the separate term and preterm factor scores were highly correlated with the IRRISS score (term score r = 0.97, preterm score r = 1; both P < .001) and the COAST score (term score, r = 0.94; preterm score, r = 0.93; both P < .0001; results not shown).
