Putative G-quadruplex forming sequences are present in the 5′-LTR of both human and non-human primate lentiviruses. To check if the G4 forming region observed in the 5′-LTR of the HIV-1 provirus was a conserved feature of lentiviruses, we investigated the presence of putative G4 forming sequences (PQS) in the LTRs of all known lentiviruses. The viruses belonging to the lentivirus genus can be grouped according to their 5 host types. The primate group, which our reference HIV-1 group M belongs to, comprises viruses that naturally infect both human (HIV-1 and HIV-2) and non-human primates (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus, SIV) mainly belonging to the Cercopithecidae family 44 . The SIV sub-group is the most abundant and composed of viruses isolated from 41 different primate species. Among these, 29 SIV genomes that include the entire LTR region are available: these were considered in our analysis ( Fig. 1 and Supporting Table S1 ). The ovine-caprine group includes 3 viruses: Visna/Maedi virus, Caprine Arthritis Encephalitis Virus (CAEV) and Ovine Lentivirus (OL); the bovine group consists of Bovine Immunodeficiency Virus (BIV) and Jembrana Disease Virus (JDV); the equine group is represented by Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV); the feline group comprises Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) that naturally infects members of the Felidae family (Supporting Table S1 ). Analysis of PQS was initially performed using the online-based algorithm software (QGRS Mapper). The search was limited to 3-stacked tetrads G4s because these are the most abundant stable G4s within eukaryotic promoter regions 45 and these were found in the HIV-1 group M LTR 9 . The following G4 pattern was thus investigated: GGG ≥3 N 0-12 GGG ≥3 N 0-12 GGG ≥3 N 0-12 GGG ≥3 , where N is a 0-12 nt-long loop sequence. This initial analysis allowed to identify the main G4 forming regions, which were next manually analysed in terms of G-tracts, loop composition and size. This step was necessary to include G4s with a single-nt bulge; in fact, this type of G4 has been previously found in the HIV-1 LTR-IV G4 43 . Two-stacked tetrads G4 structures were excluded from the analysis. Results are summarized in Fig. 1 and Supporting Table S1 . PQSs were found in the 5′-LTR regions of 97% viruses of the primate group (32 viruses over 33 analysed viruses). Interestingly, most G4 sequences were located in the U3 region of the viral LTRs, as previously found in the HIV-1 group M LTR 9 . Within the bovine group, JDV presented one LTR PQS formed by 4 tracts of 3 or more Gs, 1 GG tract and additional single Gs that could also be involved in G4 formation. Conversely, BIV and viruses of the equine, feline and ovine-caprine groups lacked the possibility to form three-stacked tetrad G4s in the LTR (Supporting Table S1 ). Some of these viruses presented sequences compatible with formation of two-stacked tetrad G4s or G4s involving multiple bulges (Supporting Table S2 ). These sequences were not further considered due to their low intrinsic stability and lack of preferred conserved location. In the primate group, the identified LTR PQSs highly varied both in length (from 27 to 89 nts) and base composition, and were all characterized by several G-runs that could in principle form multiple overlapping G4s. The HIV-2, SIVcol, SIVcpz, SIVmac, SIVsm and SIVstm genomes, however, shared peculiar features with our reference HIV-1 group M LTR, such as length and the potential to form at least 3 stable G4 structures. In fact, the LTR PQSs of these viruses were all characterized by 4-6 tracts of 3 or more Gs, with additional GG tracts and interspersed Gs. Notably, SIVcpz LTR PQS was composed of 6 GGG tracts, 2 GG tracts and 1 G base that could form a single-nt bulge G4, exactly as we previously reported for the HIV-1 group M LTR 9, 43 . The only exception in the SIV group is SIVmnd2, the LTR PQS of which displayed multiple G-runs with the potential of atypical G4 folding, such as three-stacked tetrad G4s with 2-nt bulges. PQSs of HIV-1 groups N and O were also quite different, being shorter (43 nts) and with unique G-patterns (Fig. 1) . Interestingly, in the primate group the full-length LTR sequence is only moderately conserved: the pairwise sequence similarity of all possible sequence pairs is reasonably low (mean = 56.70%, st.dev. = 6.25%, median = 55.59%) (Supporting Fig. 1a ). In contrast, the possibility to form G4 is conserved even if the G4 pattern is different among strains (Supporting Fig. 1b) . Putative G-quadruplex forming sequences of lentiviruses significantly overlap with Sp1 binding sites. We noted that most of the primate LTR G-rich sequences displayed a conserved sequence (GGGACTTTCC) located at the 5′-end of the PQS ( Table 1 ) that corresponded to one NFκB binding site (consensus sequence 5′-GGGRNNYYCC-3′, R = A or G, N = any nt, and Y = C or T) 46 . The JDV PQS also partially overlapped with a NFκB binding site at its 3′ end (Table 1 ). In addition, the HIV-1 LTR G4s were associated to three Sp1 binding sites (consensus sequence KGGGCGGRRY, K = G or T, R = A or G and Y = C or T) 47 . Since Sp1 binding sites for only a very few viruses are available in the literature, the establishment of a straightforward correlation between LTR G4s and Sp1 was not possible. We thus used the online software PhysBinder 48 to predict Sp1 binding regions in the LTR of all lentiviruses with relevant PQSs. In the primate lentiviruses, 30 out of 32 subgroups displayed Sp1 binding sites that overlapped with the PQS (Table 1) . HIV-1 N and SIVwrc were two exceptions: the former was the only genome that displayed three NFκB binding sites overlapping with the PQS and no Sp1 binding site; the latter was the only genome that lacked both NFκB and Sp1 binding sites. All other subgroups presented 1-3 Sp1 binding sites associated to 0-2 NFκB binding sites, indicating a strong correlation between G4 and Sp1.
