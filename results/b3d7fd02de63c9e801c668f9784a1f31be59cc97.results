Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and genotype analysis A total of 88 samples from 99 dogs were positive for CPV-2. Of the 88 CPV-2 isolates, 17, 23, and 48 were identified as CPV-2a (19.3 %), CPV-2b (26.1 %), and CPV-2c (54.6 %), respectively. First, we observed the CPV-2c variant collected in January 2015 (Additional file 1, Fig. 1 ). This variant rapidly spread throughout the Taiwanese dog population, and detection rates were 53.1 % (26/49) and 68.8 % (22/32) in 2015 (January to December) and 2016 (January to April), respectively ( Fig. 1 ). Taken together, our data revealed co-circulation of CPV-2a, âˆ’2b, and -2c on the island, and CPV-2c was identified as the current dominant variant.
