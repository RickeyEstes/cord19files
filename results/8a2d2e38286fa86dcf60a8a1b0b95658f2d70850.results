The Figures 1a and 1b , we provide sequence plots for both groups of observations (upper and lower RTIs, respectively), superimposing the reference standard classification, accompanied by the results of the statistical model fitting. In Tables 1 and 2 , we present the summary findings for sensitivity, specificity of simple regression and CUSUM models for the detection of upper and lower RTI outbreaks, respectively, with regard to each set of input parameters used, along with the respective 95% confidence intervals. The total amount of comparisons executed by the models for the calculation of these indices is also shown. The performance of the simple regression and CUSUM models under the different set of parameters we selected, generally yielded high values for sensitivity and specificity for both types of RTIs. The main exception was observed when the CUSUM model was run with the ''typical'' set of parameters for (k, h) of (0.5, 5), which yielded high values for specificity but low values for sensitivity. Simple regression displayed excellent sensitivity results for both groups of RTIs. As the m-weeks parameter increased, simple regression displayed slightly lower specificity for both groups of RTIs. The best results were obtained with the parameter selection for m = 4 weeks. Simple regression seemed to perform somewhat better for the upper RTIs compared to the lower RTIs. Concerning the use of CUSUM models, the typical (k, h) = (0.5, 5) set of parameters yielded high values for specificity but low values for sensitivity for both upper and lower RTIs. However, the
