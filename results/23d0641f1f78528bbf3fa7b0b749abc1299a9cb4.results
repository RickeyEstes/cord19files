The decision models yield distinct vaccine adoption and disease transmission dynamics ( Fig  2) . As disease begins to spread, individuals perceive increasing risks and vaccinate according to the decision model, thereby protecting themselves and interrupting potential chains of transmission to others. While all three strategies reduce the total number of infections, the local count strategy affords the greatest and most efficient protection of the three. Under the global prevalence strategy, perceived risk is homogeneous. As cases mount, the vaccination rate rises synchronously throughout the population, arguably resulting in too much too late vaccine coverage. The local strategies avert more infections with fewer vaccinations than the global strategy. As epidemics unfold, risk is both heterogeneous and dynamic, with some portions of the network experiencing greater forces of infection than others. Local decision-making allows earlier detection and response to increasing personal risk, and prevents unnecessary vaccination in lower risk settings, both prior to and following epidemic waves. The local count strategy is more protective than the local prevalence strategy. By tracking the number rather than proportion of infected contacts, individuals more accurately assess the local force of infection. For example, compare a solitary individual with just two social contacts and a gregarious individual with 20. If they both have two infected contacts, then their risk of infection will be similar (assuming that time spent with each contact is sufficient for transmission). Under local count, their perceived risk and consequent vaccination probability will be identical; under local prevalence, the solitary individual will perceive higher risk (i.e., 100% of contacts infected) than the gregarious individual. Under all models, overall vaccine coverage increases as R 0 increases, with the global prevalence achieving near universal coverage by R 0 = 5. The relative and absolute impacts of each strategy are remarkably robust to the transmissibility of the pathogen (Fig 3) . Without vaccines, the expected epidemic size increases non-linearly with R 0 , reaching almost 100% by R 0 = 10 ( Fig 3A) . All of the vaccine strategies avert a large and increasing fraction of cases, as R 0 increases. In fact, the total epidemic size is nonmonotonic, with slightly more expected infections around R 0 = 4 than around R 0 = 10. The local count strategy consistently yields the greatest protection, followed by local prevalence. The decision models result in dramatically different vaccination rates, with the global prevalence strategy leading to near universal vaccination, consistently more than double the coverage produced by the local count strategy (Fig 3B) . The population-level protection afforded by the local count strategy exhibits a non-trivial trend with R 0 (Fig 3C) . Between R 0 = 1 and R 0 = 2, its impact grows logarithmically from less than one infection averted per vaccinator to nearly two infections averted per vaccinator. Thereafter, the indirect benefits continue to grow slowly, reaching three infections averted per vaccinator when R 0 = 9. To explore the dynamic interactions between behavior and epidemiology in the three models, we consider individual nodes based on their degree (number of contacts). In general, the higher the degree of a node, the higher their risk for becoming infected and infecting others, and the greater the number of local infections they could potentially perceive when making vaccination decisions. Indeed, across all decision models, higher degree individuals vaccinate earlier, in terms of the fraction of the population infected at time of vaccination (Fig 4A, bottom) . However, the fraction of individuals vaccinated in each degree class does not necessarily increase with degree (Fig 4A, top) . Local count is the only strategy under which vaccination coverage monotonically increases with degree. Under global decision-making, coverage is inversely related to degree, and under local prevalence, coverage peaks for moderately connected individuals. By the time individuals choose to vaccinate under either of the two suboptimal strategies, their local risk of infection is already quite high (Fig 4A, middle) , particularly for more gregarious individuals. Although the vaccinating individuals are immediately protected, comparable individuals (of the same degree class and local risk) who stochastically fail to make the same low probability vaccination decision are likely to become infected. Consequently, the risk of infection increases steeply with degree under all models except local count (Fig 4B) . In a sensitivity analysis, we find that these qualitative results are robust to our assumptions about the efficacy of the vaccine, the time lag between an individual deciding to vaccinate and becoming protected against infection, the size of the network and the duration of the infectious period (S3 Fig). Finally, we consider the impact of the underlying contact network on the interplay between transmission and vaccination dynamics (Fig 5) . We compare our focal exponential network to a uniform random network in which all nodes have the same degree and a Barab√°si-Albert scale-free network. The local count strategy robustly affords the most efficient population-level protection, averting the maximum number of infections (or nearly maximum in the case of the scale-free network and low R 0 ) with the fewest vaccines.
