For 27 medical students participating in the study, the average number of weeks of clinical experience was 24 (range 0-52 weeks). Of the 27 students, 16 (59%) did not recall prior training in the use of PPE, six (22%) completed an online computer-based training module at the start of their clinical rotations, three (11%) received a lecture that included PPE training, and two (7%) reported having a demonstration on how to use PPE. For those completing computer modules, it was noted that the training focused primarily on the type of PPE to be employed in different situations rather than on how to use PPE. None of the students recalled having to demonstrate their proficiency in use of PPE. Several students commented that they did not receive instruction on how to use PPE, but learned by observing other personnel. During simulations of contaminated glove removal, five students (19%) exhibited correct donning technique and six (22%) exhibited correct doffing technique; only two students (7%) exhibited correct donning and doffing technique. Of the 27 students, 12 (44%) contaminated their hands and/or wrist with fluorescent lotion during glove removal. Table 1 shows the results of the survey for medical residents versus fellows and attendings. The 100 participants represented 67 different medical schools in 18 countries including the United States (N = 34 medical schools), Columbia, Europe, the Caribbean, India, China, Israel, and the Middle East. A majority of participants reported no training in use of PPE during medical school or residency. Less than 40% of participants chose correct donning and/or doffing sequences based on CDC recommendations. There were no significant differences among physicians trained in United States versus physicians trained in medical schools outside the United States, in terms of having had training in use of PPE (p = 0.46) or their knowledge of the CDC recommendations for donning and/or doffing sequences (p = 0.44). Similarly there were no significant differences in use of PPE training or knowledge between residents and fellows/ attendings (p > 0.05 for all comparisons).
