Adaptive immune responses are essential for the elimination of pulmonary-infected SARS-CoV As a first step, we confirmed the time course of viral titers in the lungs of aged (46 months old) BALB/c mice, young (7 weeks old) BALB/c mice, and young (8 weeks old) SCID mice following infection with SARS-CoV Vietnam/NB-04/2003. The intranasal (i.n.) infection of aged BALB/c mice with SARS-CoV resulted in over 10 8 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 )/g lung tissue at 2 dpi (Fig. 1A) . The infected mice exhibited histological signs of severe pneumonia, including interstitial cell thickening, immune cell infiltration, and epithelial damage in the bronchus, at 9 dpi and 21 dpi (Fig. 1B(c and d) ). These results were similar to those of the previous reports that used another SARS-CoV strain such as the Urbani strain (Roberts et al., 2005) . In the present work, SARS-CoV was detected in aged mice starting as early as 2 dpi (Fig. 1A) . The observed titers in the aged-mouse model were considerably higher than those seen in infected young BALB/c mice, which did not show apparent histological signs of pneumonia (Fig. 2B) . Titers in the aged mice remained high ($ 10 7 TCID 50 /g lung tissue) at 6 dpi ( Fig. 1A) . However, the titers decreased to levels below the lower limit of detection (LLOD; o1000 TCID 50 /g lung tissue) in the lungs of aged BALB/c mice and young BALB/c mice at 9 dpi (Fig. 1A) . In contrast, young SCID mice, which lack functional T and B cells, were persistently infected with SARS-CoV during the experimental period (through 21 dpi, as shown in Fig. 1A ). At this time, SCID mice did not exhibit histological signs of severe pneumonia at 9 and 21 dpi, although a high viral titer was detected in the lungs of these animals during the experimental period ( Fig. 1B(g and h) and C). Recently, Zhao and Perlman (2010) obtained similar results suggesting that a mouse-adapted mutant of SARS-CoV (viral strain MA15) persistently infected RAG1 knockout mice (C57BL/6 background), animals that also lack T and B cell populations. Taken together, these results suggested that the pathogenesis of SARS does not correlate with the direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV. To investigate the effect of adaptive immune responses on clearance of pulmonaryinfected SARS-CoV, either naïve splenocytes (obtained from BALB/c mice) or sensitized splenocytes (obtained from SARS-CoV-infected (9 dpi) BALB/c mice) were adoptively transplanted into naïve SCID mice 1 day before SARS-CoV infection. As shown in Fig. 1D , the SCID mice that received naïve splenocytes eliminated SARS-CoV from their lungs as early as the BALB/c mice did. The SCID mice transplanted with SARS-CoV-sensitized splenocytes of BALB/c mice eliminated SARS-CoV more rapidly than mice transplanted with naïve splenocytes, although the initial pulmonary viral titers were effectively the same in all groups of SCID mice at 2 dpi, with or without the transfer of splenocytes. Only one of the SCID mice that received sensitized splenocytes showed detectable lung pulmonary viral titer (3.5 Â 10 4 TCID 50 /g lung) at 6 dpi; titers in the remaining 3 animals of this group (n¼4/time point) were below the LLOD. The SCID mice transplanted with naïve-or sensitized-splenocytes derived from aged BALB/c mice did not show histological signs of severe pneumonia at 9 dpi, although infiltration of immunocompetent cells around bronchioles (arrows) was partially observed in the lung of both groups (Fig. 1E ). These results indicated that induction of adaptive immune responses is essential for the clearance of pulmonary-infected SARS-CoV.
