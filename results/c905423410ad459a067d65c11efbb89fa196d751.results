Of 122 herds invited to participate in the study, 75 (61%) submitted samples. In total, samples from 146 diarrhoeic and 124 healthy calves were sent to the laboratory and analysed. The farmers sometimes submitted samples from several diseased calves but only a single sample from a healthy calf, and this is the reason for the discrepancy between the number of diarrhoeic and healthy calves. Of the 3081 heifer calves born in the study herds during 1998, 302 developed diarrhoea before 90 days of age (Table 1 ). The presence of rotavirus was significantly associated with diarrhoea (P=0.001) and a tendency to an association was found between diarrhoea and the presence of C. parvum oocysts (P=0.067). C. parvum, G. intestinalis and rotavirus were found in 17/75 (23%), 38/75 (51%) and 28/75 (37%) or the herds, respectively. C. parvum, G. intestinalis and rotavirus were found in calves that were between 7-84, 9-84 and 5-78 days old, respectively (Figure 1 ). These agents were found in the faecal samples throughout the year.
