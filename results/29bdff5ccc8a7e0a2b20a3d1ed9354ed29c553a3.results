Characterization of anti-ClfA MAb SAR114. We previously reported on the enhanced protective capacity and isolate coverage afforded by prophylaxis with an anti-S. aureus alpha-toxin MAb (MEDI4893*) in combination with an anti-ClfA MAb (11H10) relative to the individual MAbs in an S. aureus lethal bacteremia model (9) . Although 11H10 is a potent anti-ClfA MAb, we found it exhibited a Ͼ1,000-fold reduced affinity (K on ; below the limit of detection; ND in Table 1 ) and an ϳ40-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) for ClfA002 in the fibrinogen binding inhibition assay relative to ClfA001 and ClfA004 ( Fig. 1A and Table 1 ). ClfA002 is expressed by a prominent S. aureus hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (HA-MRSA; USA100 or sequence type 5 [ST5]) strain (17, 18) . To increase potential clinical isolate coverage, we screened human tonsillar B cells to search for more broadly reactive anti-ClfA MAbs. From this effort, we identified a MAb (SAR114) with high affinity for ClfA001, ClfA002, and ClfA004 (apparent dissociation constant [K D ] of 1.15 to 44.7 pM) ( Table 1) and potent inhibition of fibrinogen binding by these 3 prominent ClfA genotypes (IC 50 of ϳ20 M) (Fig. 1B) . SAR114 also exhibited opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) activity against several S. aureus clinical isolates (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) and improved inhibition of bacterial agglutination in human plasma compared to 11H10 ( Fig. 1C; Fig. S2 ). 11H10 and SAR114 were found to compete for binding to ClfA001 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and in an Octet-based competition assay ( Fig. 2A and B) . These results indicate the MAbs bind an overlapping epitope on ClfA001, suggesting their potency difference against ClfA002 results from different binding affinities. SAR114-MEDI4893* MAb combination provides broad strain coverage in lethal bacteremia. SAR114 protective activity next was evaluated in a murine lethal bacteremia model, alone and in combination with MEDI4893*. SAR114 (15 mg/kg) prophylaxis resulted in increased survival compared to an isotype control IgG (c-IgG) following challenge with S. aureus isolates representing ST8, ST5, or ST30, confirmed to encode ClfA genotypes ClfA001, ClfA002, and ClfA004, respectively ( Table 2 ; Fig. S3 ). Similar to 11H10-MEDI4893*, prophylaxis with the SAR114-MEDI4893* combination (7.5 mg/kg each) significantly increased survival relative to c-IgG following challenge with all strains tested and provided a benefit over the individual MAbs against some strains (Table 2) (9). These results indicate SAR114 is functional in vivo and confirms the need for a MAb combination to provide broader strain coverage. Anti-alpha-toxin-anti-ClfA-bispecific MAb in vitro efficacy. Passive immunization with an anti-ClfA-anti-alpha-toxin MAb combination provided a benefit for strain coverage in lethal bacteremia and retained the anti-alpha-toxin protective capacity in murine dermonecrosis and pneumonia models (9) . To determine if a BiSAb comprised  of the anti-ClfA and anti-alpha-toxin MAbs provided benefit over a MAb combination, we engineered BiSAbs comprised of 11H10 or SAR114 as the IgG backbones, to which the MEDI4893* scFv was appended to the amino (BiS 2 ) or carboxy (BiS 3 ) terminus of the heavy chain ( Fig. 3 ) (19) . The BiS 2 and BiS 3 formats were selected because the scFv is located in disparate locations on the IgG, and the only way to determine if one format has an advantage over another is to test them empirically for the antibody specificities of interest. To understand if the BiSAbs retained the functional activities of the individual MAbs, we measured their potency in inhibiting alpha-toxin-dependent rabbit red blood cell (RBC) lysis and inhibition of fibrinogen binding to ClfA001, ClfA002, and ClfA004. The 11H10-BiS 2 and -BiS 3 molecules and SAR114-BiS 2 exhibited IC 50 s similar to that of MEDI4893* in an alpha-toxin hemolytic assay, whereas SAR114-BiS 3 exhibited reduced alpha-toxin neutralization activity ( Fig. 4A ; Table S2 ). Both 11H10 BiSAbs and the SAR114 BiS 3 Ab exhibited IC 50 s similar to the respective parental anti-ClfA IgG in the fibrinogen binding inhibition assay, whereas the SAR114 Bis 2 Ab lost some activity against ClfA002 but was still superior to 11H10 ( Fig. 4B ; Fig. S4 and Table S2 ). The BiSAbs also mediated OPK similar to that of the parental anti-ClfA IgG (Fig. S5) . Importantly, saturation of the anti-alpha-toxin scFv in the presence of a 10 M excess of alpha-toxin did not interfere with anti-ClfA activity in the fibrinogen binding assay (Fig. 4C) . Similarly, saturation of ClfA binding with a 10 M ClfA excess did not decrease alpha-toxin neutralizing activity of the BiSAbs in the hemolytic assay ( Fig. 4D ; Table S2 ). Taken together, these results indicate the anti-alpha-toxin-anti-ClfA BiS molecules retain in vitro functional activity that in most cases was similar to that of the parental IgG, and this activity was not diminished in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of the other antigen recognized by the BiSAb. Anti-alpha-toxin-anti-ClfA BiSAb molecule efficacy in lethal bacteremia. The anti-ClfA-anti-alpha-toxin BiSAb protective activities next were compared to those of the MAb combinations in an S. aureus lethal bacteremia model. Mice were passively immunized with the MAb combinations (7.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg each) or equimolar doses of the BiSAbs (9 or 1.2 mg/kg, respectively) 24 h prior to intravenous (i.v.) infection with S. aureus SF8300, and survival was monitored for 14 days. Both SAR114-BiSAbs at 9 mg/kg exhibited reduced but not significantly different (P ϭ 0.234 for BiS 2 and P ϭ 0.412 for BiS 3 ) protection compared to the MAb combination at 7.5 mg/kg each (Fig. 5A ). The MAb combination at 1 mg/kg (P ϭ 0.0051 versus c-IgG) and SAR114-BiS 2 at 1.2 mg/kg (P ϭ 0.0336 versus c-IgG) significantly increased survival relative to c-IgG. Consistent with the observed loss of alpha-toxin neutralization activity in vitro (Fig. 4A ), SAR114-BiS 3 did not significantly increase survival when administered at 1.2 mg/kg (P ϭ 0.657) (Fig. 5A ). When tested against S. aureus strain 3049057 (MRSA, ST8), a strain where neither MAb alone is sufficient for significant protection (Fig. S3) , the SAR114-BiS molecules at 1.2 mg/kg did not significantly increase survival relative to c-IgG (P ϭ 0.4310), whereas an equimolar concentration (1 mg/kg) of the MAb combination did (P ϭ 0.0348 versus c-IgG) (Fig. 5B ). This suggested a defect in the SAR114-BiS 2 Ab in vivo. Interestingly, passive immunization with the 11H10-BiSAbs resulted in protection similar to that of the MAb combination at both doses (9 mg/kg and 1.2 mg/kg) and provided a significant increase in survival relative to c-IgG against both ClfA001-expressing strains, SF8300 and 3049057 ( Fig. 5C and D) . These results indicate that the anti-ClfA-anti-alpha-toxin BiSAbs do not provide benefit over the MAb combination, as was previously observed for the BiS 4 ␣PA (MEDI3902) against P. aeruginosa; rather, conversely, the SAR114 -MEDI4893* BiS exhibited a loss in protection at lower doses against a strain where the individual MAbs are not sufficient to provide protection. Binding to ClfA impairs BiSAb efficacy in lethal pneumonia. Since SAR114, in MAb or either BiS format, binds ClfA001 with ϳ1,000-fold greater affinity than 11H10 (Tables 1 and 3) , we hypothesized that its binding to ClfA sequesters the BiSAb on the bacterial surface, leading to poorer capture and neutralization of alpha-toxin as it is secreted. Alpha-toxin is a key virulence factor in S. aureus pneumonia (20) , and passive immunization with an anti-alpha-toxin MAb alone protects mice from lethal S. aureus pneumonia (6, 8, 21) . Moreover, we previously showed that the anti-ClfA MAb does not impact survival in the pneumonia model, and anti-alpha-toxin-anti-ClfA provides protection similar to that of anti-alpha-toxin alone (9) . Therefore, to determine if the decreased protection observed with the SAR114-BiS 2 Abs in the lethal bacteremia model resulted from inadequate alpha-toxin neutralization, we examined SAR114-BiS efficacy in the lethal pneumonia model. Passive immunization with MEDI4893* (15 mg/kg) alone or in combination with SAR114 resulted in 100% protection following challenge with SF8300. However, passive immunization with SAR114-BiS 2 or -BiS 3 resulted in 30 and 0% survival, respectively (Fig. 6A) . Interestingly, passive immunization with the 11H10-BiS 2 , which has ϳ1,000-fold reduced affinity for ClfA (Table 1) , provided 100% survival. These results support the conclusion that binding to ClfA on the bacterial surface sequesters SAR114-BiSAbs, thus impairing alpha-toxin neutralization. To further test this hypothesis, mice were passively immunized with the BiS 2 molecules prior to intranasal (i.n.) infection with the SF8300Δclfa ClfA isogenic mutant. Prophylaxis with SAR114-BiSAb provided protection against the SF8300Δclfa mutant similar to that of MEDI4893* (Fig. 6B) . These results provide further evidence that SAR114-BiSAb binding to surface-localized ClfA prevents effective neutralization of soluble alpha-toxin.
