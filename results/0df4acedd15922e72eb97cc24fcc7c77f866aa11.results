Recombinant nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV (SCoV-N) was cloned from the SARS-CoV genomic library (CUHK-W1) by PCR and tag with a His 6 -tag at its N-terminus for purification. Expression of recombinant N proteins in E. coli was construct-dependent and induced by addition of IPTG. Purified recombinant N protein was characterized with a molecular mass of $52 kDa (Fig. 1A) . The purified recombinant His 6 -N protein was recognized by convalescent serum of SARS patients but not by healthy subject (Fig. 1B) , suggesting that the recombinant N protein shares the same antigenicity as the native viral N protein. To profile the anti-N antibody response, we constructed a phage-displayed scFv library from a mouse that immunized with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cell lysate. As evidenced by Western blot analysis against the recombinant nucleocapsid protein, anti-N response in immunized mouse was detectable 8 days after the first immunization and displaying strong antibody response after two more boost injections (Fig. 2) . No immunoreactive response was observed in mouse without immunization (Fig. 2) , suggesting that the antibody response was induced by the heat-inactivated SARS-coronavirus, and consistent with the previous finding that inactivated SARS-CoV induces high level of neutralizing antibody in mice [19] . After the construction of phage-displayed scFv library, anti-N scFvs were retrieved by bio-panning the library (3 · 10 6 recombinants) against the recombinant SCoV-N protein, and 2100 anti-N scFvs were isolated. Among 14 selected strong SCoV-N protein binders, 2 scFv-phage clones (L9B3a and L9B4b, the clones were renamed as L9N01) gave the identical nucleotide sequence. To our surprise, BLAST search of the derived anti-N scFv sequences against NCBI database indicated that the L9N01 phage Reactivity of individual mice sera (500· fold diluted) towards SCoV-N protein was tested against purified recombinant N protein (0.5 lg). Strong immunoreactivity was noted in immunized mice but not in controls, suggesting humoral response of mouse towards SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cell lysate mimicking antibody response to SARS-CoV infection. clone shares a high sequence homology (84%) with an anti-IL-11 scFv (Accession No. AY171038) (Fig. 3) . In order to examine the cross-reactivity, L9N01 were tested against recombinant N protein and IL-11 by phage-ELISA. The L9N01 scFv-phage bound strongly both to the recombinant N protein as well as to a recombinant IL-11 (Fig. 4) . However, L9N01 did not react with IL-6 which is structurally and functionally similar to IL-11 (data not shown). To evaluate the biological effect of anti-N scFv, IL-11stimulated tyrosine 705 phosphorylation of STAT 3 in rat intestinal epithelial IEC-18 cells was examined. IL-11 stimulated STAT 3 phosphorylation that lasted throughout the 60-min test period. In the presence of L9N01 phage (6 · 10 10 cfu), IL-11-induced phosphorylation was completely suppressed. By contrast, the presence of other specific anti-N scFvs exerted no inhibitory effect (Fig. 5 ).
