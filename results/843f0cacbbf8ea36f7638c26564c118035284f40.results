To illuminate how Nef enables the recognition of MHC-I by AP1, we determined the crystal structure of HIV-1 Nef in complex with the MHC-I CD (residues 314-341) and the Cterminal domain (residues 158-423) of the μ1 subunit. We assembled the complex using a construct of the MHC-I CD fused to the N-terminus of Nef 8, 10 . This fusion protein binds to μ1 directly, and the effects of various mutations on binding in vitro largely recapitulate the behavior of MHC-I downregulation by Nef in vivo 10 . The potential artifact caused by the fusion design was a concern initially, however, the crystal structure demonstrates that the linkage is in a flexible region of Nef and does not affect the structure (see below). We obtained three crystal forms diffracting to 2.6 Å, 2.9 Å, and 3.3 Å resolutions (Table 1) and observed a total of six independent Nef/MHC-I CD/μ1 complexes of the same structure in the asymmetric units of the crystals. The structure provides a detailed molecular description of how Nef hijacks the host membrane trafficking machinery to decrease the expression of MHC-I at the cell surface.
