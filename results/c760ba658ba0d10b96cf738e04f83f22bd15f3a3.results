Wild boars were divided by age, determined by hunters, into three groups depending on number of permanent molars according to SCHEDA Ecological Associates, inc. (one molar 6-18 months, two molars 1.5-2.5 year, three molars over 2.5 years of age). The age group 6-18 months old wild boar consisted of 28 animals (females, n = 13; males, n = 15), the group 1.5-2.5 years old of five wild boars (females, n = 3; males, n = 2) and the group of animals older than 2.5 years of seven wild boars (females, n = 3; males, n = 4). The majority of ill animals belonged to the age group 6-18 months old wild boar (females, n = 6; males, n = 7). Three wild boars belonged to the group 1.5-2.5 years old animals (females, n = 1; males, n = 2) and two to older than 2.5 years group (females, n = 1; males, n = 1). The most common symptoms described by hunters for the 18 ill wild boars were depression, dyspnea, slow movement, and no fear of humans. There was no evidence of any previous vaccination. Among 18 ill wild boars, there were 9 males (6-18 months old, n = 7; 1.5-2.5 years old, n = 1; older than 2.5 years, n = 1) and 9 females (6-18 months old, n = 6; 1.5-2.5 years old n = 2; older than 2.5 years, n = 1) (Fig. 1) . AD virus genome was detected in 8 of 40 samples (20 %). All PCR positive (n = 8) wild boars were reported to be ill and belonged to the group 6-18 months old wild boar (females, n = 3; males, n = 5) ( (Figs. 2, 3 and 4) . The greatest distance between isolates from wild and domestic animals was observed for us9 gene (3 %), followed by ul49.5 (1 %). There was no distance between those groups of isolates for us4 gene. Comparing isolates from Serbian wild boars and other sequences used for phylogenetic analysis, 32 % distance was determined for us 9gene, 26 % for ul49.5 and 4 % for us4 gene. Certain distance, but highest for ul49.5 gene (6 %), was obvious between wild boar isolates and Bartha vaccine strain. However, no distance was observed between wild boar isolates based on any of three examined sequences. ADV was isolated on PK 15 cells from 3 of 8 PCR positive samples. All isolates originated from pool of organs (kidney and spleen) from young (6-18 months old) male wild boars which were serologically negative. CPE was evident after 24 hours of incubation for one sample, and after 72 hours for the other two samples. Observed syncytia, different in size, were well developed. In the neutralisation test, all isolates were inhibited with antiserum, confirming the recovered viruses were ADV. No further virus isolations were obtained from negative samples by further blind passage. Twenty-three out of 40 (57.5 %) serum samples had neutralising antibodies in the VNT against ADV. Eight ill wild boars were negative by VNT, out of which four were PCR positive. The other four PCR positive animals were seropositive by VNT, two at a titre of 1:8, and one each at titres of 1:16 and 1:64 (Fig. 5) . The rest of ill animals had titres 1:64 (n = 1), 1:128 (n = 3), 1:256 (n = 1) and 1:512 (n = 1). Out of 9 ill males, 5 were negative by VNT, two had titre 1:8, and one each 1:64 and 1:256. Out of 9 ill females, 3 were negative by VNT and 6 had certain VN titre (1:16, n = 1; 1:64, n = 1; 1:128, n = 3; 1:512, n = 1) Thirteen of 22 healthy wild boars were seropositive (Table 1) , three at titre 1:8 (6-18 months old, n = 3), three at titre 1:16 (6-18 months old, n = 2; older than 2.5 years, n = 1), four at titre 1:64 (6-18 months old, n = 2, 1.5-2.5 year old, n = 1; older than 2.5 years, n = 1). However, the results of this study did not show any statistically significant difference between neither genders nor age categories (P > 0.05) PRRSV, PCV2, SIV, PRCV and PPV were not detected by molecular methods in samples from the 18 ill wild boars. Anti-PPV2 antibodies were detected in 11 of 18 serum samples (61.1 %). No antibodies to other viruses were detected. No PRRSV, PCV2, SIV, PRCV, PPV and ADV were detected by molecular tests on samples from the 22 clinically healthy wild boars. Seroprevalence for ADV and PPV in that group were 59.1 % (n = 13/22) and 63.6 % (n = 14/22) respectively. No antibodies to other viruses were detected.
