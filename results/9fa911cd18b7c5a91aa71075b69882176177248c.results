Over the study period, 721 patients with suspected CAP were admitted to the 13 hospitals included in this study. Of these patients, 266 had X-ray-confirmed CAP and were enrolled in the study (Figure 1 ). Demographic and other characteristics of the enrolled study population are shown in Table 1 . Patients originated from 43 countries, with the most represented being Indonesia (n = 59, 22.3%), Egypt (n = 27, 10.2%), and India (n = 26, 9.8%). All but one case entered KSA between August 1 and September 10, 2016. Most patients were elderly males (mean age 65.3 years, range 30-90 years; male to female ratio 2:1). The majority of cases (n = 188, 70.6%) were admitted to hospitals in the city of Mecca, the main site of the Hajj pilgrimage, including 40 cases admitted to the four temporary hospitals at the Mecca holy sites. The pattern of admission shows that the number of cases admitted to hospitals increased over the study period and that most cases of CAP occurred post Hajj (Figure 2, Table 2 ). Cough and difficulty breathing were the most common symptoms and were present in 91% (n = 242) and 87.2% (n = 232) of the cases, respectively. Similarly, fever and tachypnea were the most common vital sign abnormalities, recorded in 83.1% (n = 221) and 79.4% (n = 211) of the cases, respectively. At least one clinical or laboratory abnormality was recorded for 63% of cases. Only 22.7% (n = 59) of cases were initially admitted to the ICU upon arrival at the hospital, but 45.4% (n = 108) of cases were treated in the ICU during their hospital stay. Diabetes mellitus was reported by 36.4% (n = 96) of the study population, and 10% (n = 26) declared that they were cigarette smokers. Only 6.6% (n = 17) of the cases acknowledged having used antibiotics in the 5 days prior to their admission, although antibiotic use was unknown in a further 44.6% (n = 115) of the cases. All but one of the 17 cases who had used antibiotics prior to hospital admission had been on a single antibiotic. One person had taken both ceftriaxone and clarithromycin prior to hospital admission. The most common antibiotics used prior to hospital admission were cephalosporins (mainly third-generation) and penicillins. Culture-based methods (sterile sites or respiratory specimens) were performed in 37.6% (n = 100) of the cases, with the etiology determined in 19.0% (19/100) of these cases. S. pneumoniae was identified in 13% (n = 13) of the samples and in 6% (n = 6) of samples from normally sterile sites. Other pathogens were identified in six samples, including staphylococci (n = 5) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1). Urine antigen tests to detect S. pneumoniae infection were performed in 93.6% (n = 249) of CAP cases; 14.5% (n = 36) were positive. The overall proportion of CAP cases with a positive result for S. pneumoniae (based on either culture-based tests or the urine antigen test) was 18% (n = 48). Valid test results for both culture-based methods and the urine antigen test were available for 83 cases. Overall, agreement in results (both negative and positive) between the two methods was Figure 2 . General pattern of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) case admissions to hospitals during the study period. found in 65 cases (78.3%). Based on these results, the sensitivity and specificity of the urine antigen test compared to the culturebased methods were calculated to be 8.33% and 90.1%, respectively. Hospital location and treatment in the ICU were significantly associated with S. pneumoniae CAP cases (p = 0.01). CAP patients admitted to Medina hospitals were less likely to have S. pneumoniae-attributable CAP than those admitted to Mecca hospitals (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.14-0.80). CAP patients treated in the ICU were 2.88 times more likely to be S. pneumoniae CAP cases than those not treated in the ICU (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.37-6.08). No significant association was observed between S. pneumoniae-attributable CAP and age, gender, pilgrim's country of origin, antibiotic use in the 5 days prior to hospital admission, smoking, or diabetes status (Table 3) . Disposition at discharge was recorded for 238 CAP cases. Twenty-four patients died, resulting in an overall case-fatality rate of 10.1%. The case-fatality rate among CAP patients treated in the ICU was nearly nine times that of non-ICU patients (22.2% vs. 2.48%). The case-fatality rate among all S. pneumoniae-positive cases was 16.7%, among S. pneumoniae-positive urine antigen test cases was 10.1%, and among blood culture-positive S. pneumoniae cases was 50%. Only admission to the ICU on arrival and treatment in the ICU were significantly associated with mortality in CAP cases. Patients with CAP treated in the ICU were over 11 times more likely to die than those not treated in the ICU (OR 11.23, 95% CI 3.22-39.1).
