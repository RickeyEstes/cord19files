The utilization of discontinuous cistrons for encoding a paramyxoviral P protein was first described for SV5 (Thomas et a/., 1988) . Figure 1 illustrates the cistron usage map of the SV5 P gene as compared with that for HPIV3. HPIV3 follows the more general pattern of a single continuous P cistron with an alternate overlapping C cistron similar to that first described for Sendai virus (Giorgi era/., 1983; Shioda et al., 1983) . Cloning and sequence analysis of the HPIV3 mRNA/genes by a number of labs (Galinski et a/., 1986b; Luk et a/., 1986; Spriggs and Collins, 1986b; Galinski, unpublished observations) revealed a heterogeneity in the number of G nucleotides between position 801 and 805, which is proximal to the 5'-end of the D cistron ( Fig. 1, labeled D) . Interestingly, the sequence just upstream of this G tract, AATTAAAAAA, resembles the consensus transcription termination sequence, AA-TAACWAAA, found in the gene-end boundaries of HPIVS (Spriggs and Collins, 1986a) . Together with the observation that transcriptional editing occurs in a number of paramyxoviruses at similar sequences suggests that editing is occurring at this site for accession of the D cistron. Since the cryptic V cistron is also present in the HPIV3 P gene, the question of whether transcriptional chattering occurs in the accession of the D and/or V cistrons needed to be resolved. Initially, restriction fragment length polymorphisms present in PCR amplified cDNA was examined. The results of restriction site analysis indicated that the PCR amplified cDNA was homogeneous (data not shown). Thus it was necessary to analyze individual cloned molecules to determine whether any sequence heterogeneity was present. The amplified cDNA was cloned into the Smal site of pGEM-3 and recombinant clones were identified by in situ hybridization using radiolabeled P gene-specific sequences as a probe. Individual clones were then sequenced across the putative editing sites. Approximately 50 clones, derived from either vRNA or mRNA templates, were examined. All the clones from the vRNA template had invariant sequences spanning both putative editing sites (the sequence was identical to that determined by dideoxy sequence analysis of the vRNA). In contrast, clones derived from the mRNA template had variable numbers of G residues at the D editing site and an invariant sequence at the V editing site. The results for the mRNA derived clones are illustrated in Fig. 2 . This figure is a composite of information (dideoxy G or dideoxy C sequencing reactions only) from several representative mRNA clones aligned with the precise sequence spanning the two editing sites derived from a genomic RNA clone. Panel D shows the sequence across the D editing site while panel V shows the sequence across the V editing site. This figure serves to illustrate the indiscriminate insertion of additional G residues into the mRNA template at the D editing site beyond the 5 Gs which are present in the genomic template and, further, the absence of any additional G insertions at the V editing site. The number of Gs inserted into the mRNA template varied from 5-14 residues. These results demonstrate that RNA editing occurs exclusively at the D editing site. Inspection of Fig. 1 shows that downstream of the D editing site there are a number of stop codons in the same reading frame (+2) as the V cistron. Thus any editing which occurs with the insertion of 1,4, 7, or 10, additional G residues would result in the generation of a truncated P cistron following fusion to the termination codons. The role of host cell factors in optimal HPIVS transcription has recently been described (De et al., 1990 (De et al., , 1991 . Extension of these observations to address the question of whether host cell factors participate in RNA editing, or if this process is dependent solely upon viral components was pursued. Nucleocapsid complexes were isolated from purified HPIV3 virions and used in an in v&o transcription system. Transcription was performed either in the presence or absence of uninfected cell lysates. The mRNA was separated from the genomic RNA by oligo dT-cellulose chromatography. The in vitro synthesized mRNA was then used as a template for cDNA synthesis, PCR amplification, and molecular cloning and sequence analysis as described above for the in viva synthesized RNAs. Individual clones were identified and then sequenced across the two putative editing sites. As was observed with the in viva synthesized mRNA, sequence heterogeneity was observed only at the D editing site, and not at the V editing site. Fig. 3A summarizes the results of the in viva and in vitro produced RNAs. Since the putative editing site for the accession of the V cistron was invariant in all clones, only the results for the D editing site are shown in this figure. The effects on cistron usage following the insertion of nontemplated nucleotides in the mRNA are shown in Fig. 4 . In this figure, the three potential reading frames (+l, +2, +3) in the faithfully transcribed P gene and following the addition of one or two nontemplated nucleotides in the edited transcripts are indicated in (A). In all instances following editing, the V cistron is never fused to any other cistron and thus would not be expected to be functional. In addition, since the D editing site is downstream of the C cistron termination codon, this cistron is never affected by the addition of nontemplated nucleotides. The addition of a single nucleotide at the D editing site results in the introduction of a stop codon and the subsequent truncation of the P cistron. This truncated protein consists of 242 N-terminal residues of P and six additional residues (KRERLV) followed by the stop codon. Further, the C-terminal 361 amino acids of the P cistron are fused to nine of the N-terminal residues of the D cistron including an initiating methionine (MTKELKKGG). Displacement of the remaining portion of the D cistron does not provide any methionine codon for internal translation initiation. The most noticeable feature following the addition of two nontemplated nucleotides at the D editing site is the fusion of the main portion of the D cistron (residues 1 O-l 40) onto the N-terminal 241 residues of the P cistron. Displacement of the C-terminal 361 residues of the P cistron does not provide for an initiating methionine within 1300 nucleotides of the 5'-end of the mRNA, and thus, this portion of the P cistron would not be expected to be functional. Since the insertion of three (or multiples of three) nucleotides into the mRNA will add a new codon, multi- The cistron usage map in all three reading frames of the faithfully transcribed HPIV3 P gene mRNA and the mRNAs produced followrng the insertion of one or two additional G residues at the D editing site (denoted with a vertical line). The primary mRNA transcript (faithful copies of the P gene) encodes intact P and C proteins. The principal products following the introduction of a single G are truncated P and C proteins, while the introduction of two G residues leads to fusion of the D cistron and the amino terminus of the P cistron. Recombinant transcription vectors containing genes with fixed number of G residues at the D editing site were assembled as described under Materials And Methods. Each of these clones was transcribed and used to charge a rabbit reticulo- ple "codon" insertions in any reading frame will result in the production of nearly identical proteins except for the addition of a glycine residue. Thus, the insertion of G residues can be viewed as the accession or fusion of three cistrons, the intact P proteins, truncated P (P,) proteins, and a fused P/D protein. Fig. 3B summarizes these details by charting the percentage of recombinant clones encoding P, P,, and P/D. In order to investigate the expression of the various cistrons, P, C, P,, and P/D, we reassembled recombinant genes containing a fixed number of Gs at the D editing site to duplicate the various mRNA species illustrated in Fig. 4A . Three clones, containing either six, seven, or eight G residues in the editing site, were individually transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase following restriction endonuclease digestion with Pvull at a site downstream of the P genes. The RNAs were then recovered and used to charge a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system for the production of various proteins. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 10% polyacrylamide resolving gels. The results of this analysis are shown in Fig. 4B , which compares the proteins produced by each of the fixed mRNA sequences (Lanes 5, 6, and 7) to the proteins synthesized from HPIV3-infected and uninfected CV-1 cell mRNA (lanes 3 and 4, respectively). In addition to the in vitro synthesized proteins, in viva synthesized proteins from HPIV3-infected and uninfected cells are shown (lanes 1 and 2, respectively). The results show that the encoded proteins translated from the recombinant P mRNAs are also present in the translation products of the infected cell mRNAs and that proteins with identical electrophoretic mobilities are present in HPIV3-infected cell lysates.
