The Indian Medical Mission provided health-security to approximately 400,000 patients in a period of 60 days from Aug to Oct 2016 by a team of 144 doctors including 50 specialists, 146 paramedics and 74 ancillary staff. Table 1 . Infectious disease was the most common (53.26%) outpatient diagnosis. Upper and lower respiratory infections, gastroenteritis and diabetes related skin and soft-tissue infections were seen. Respiratory infections outnumbered all other forms of illness. 90% healthcare personnel reported respiratory infections presenting as cough and viral prodrome, sometimes leading to sickness absenteeism. Upper respiratory infections presented as throat pain, sinusitis or otitis after a viral prodrome resembling common-cold or influenza like illness. Lower respiratory infections presented with productive cough, dyspnoea and fever more so in pre-existing lung conditions such as bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Acute gastroenteritis presented with vomiting and diarrhoea, with a history of food intake from multiple sources. Diabetic patients largely presented with pneumonia and cellulitis foot. There was inadequate glycemic control at presentation due to poor medication and precautionary compliance despite prescriptions of insulin and oral antihyperglycemics from India. Urinary tract infections (UTI) were found to have a predilection for female sex, diabetes and benign prostatic hypertrophy. Orthopaedic, trauma and musculoskeletal diseases included fractures, dislocations, myalgia, osteoarthritis, sprains, low backache, sciatica and crush injuries. 45% of all fractures were Colle's fracture due to fall on outstretched hand from escalators, beds or washroom flooring. Blunt trauma during mass-gatherings led to shoulder dislocation and chest wall injuries. Myalgia, osteoarthritis, sciatica and low backache precipitated due to stress, exertion, dehydration and old age. Crush injuries and metatarsal fracture occurred from overstepping of feet and wheelchairs during moving assemblage. Acute myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure (CCF) and angina were frequently encountered cardiovascular diseases. COPD and asthma were common respiratory diseases of non-infectious aetiology. Complications of COPD with cardiomegaly and CCF were seen. Complications of diabetes mellitus such as diabetic foot and cellulitis were seen. Acute urinary retention due to prostatic hypertrophy in geriatric patients needed catheterization. Abnormal heavy uterine withdrawal bleeding due to deliberately delayed menstruation was seen. Mean percentage of psychiatric diseases was 0.006%. Stress related disorders, acute psychosis, anxiety, phobia, depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder; behaviour, mood and sleep disturbances were common. 16.67% psychiatric patients were hospitalized under secondary-care. Heat illness predominantly heat-hyperpyrexia (28 males and 20 females) and heat-exhaustion (24 males and 11 females) was seen in tent-clinics, some of which presented with delirium. Drug induced gastritis was common after self-medication of analgesics and antimicrobials. Various forms of de novo contact dermatitis and intertrigo along with pre-existing chronic skin conditions were seen. Most common pre-existing conditions were diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( Table 2) . 29.20% in-patients were treated in secondary-care for gastrointestinal disorders followed by 20.90% for respiratory diseases (Table 3 ). Most secondary-care hospitalizations were done for Table 4 . Frequent referrals for tertiary care were made for acute myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, unstable angina, arrhythmia, COPD with complications, severe pneumonia, hemiparesis, chronic kidney disease, heat stroke, diabetic foot requiring amputations, fractures requiring internal/external fixation, advanced investigations and imaging. 21% were referred to tertiary-care for cardiovascular diseases followed by 16.80% for orthopaedic surgeries. Most of the referred cases had pre-existing (Table 3) . Few patients of Chronic Kidney Disease on maintenance hemodialysis attempting Hajj were hemodialyzed at Saudi hospitals. Crude unadjusted mortality amongst pilgrims was 11.99/10,000 compared to 27.02/10,000 in 2015. 24 Out of 163 deaths, there were 112 males and 51 females. Most common terminal event was cardiorespiratory arrest. Risk factors associated with high morbidity were old age and pre-existing comorbidities (Table 5 ).
