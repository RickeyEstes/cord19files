There were 30 critically ill patients admitted to the ICU requiring intubation or mechanical ventilation. There is no difference between the age of the two groups (p < 0.05). None of our patients with H1N1 had normal CT findings at presentation. The HRCT findings at presentation in our patients were similar to those described by the reports [6] . The predominant radiographic findings in the patients at presentation were unilateral or bilateral multifocal asymmetric ground-glass opacities alone (n = 29, 27.4%), with unilateral or bilateral consolidation (n = 50, 49.2%), nodular opacities or reticular opacities ( Table 1 ). The initial MDCT scan displayed a pattern of rounded, multiple, peripheral ill-defined ground-glass opacities, including two patients who are pregnant ( Figs. 1 and 2) . The sharp demarcation between the areas of involved and uninvolved parenchyma can been seen on CT scans. The consolidation had peribronchovascular and subpleural predominance. The areas of consolidation were found mainly in the posterior, middle and lower regions of the lungs, but there was no difference between the two groups (Table 1) . Reticular opacities were found in 6 cases of the initial MDCT scan (Fig. 3) . There was no difference between the pattern of disease of the two groups ( Table 2 ). Thickening of interlobular septa and intralobular lines in both sides can be seen (Fig. 4) . 30 cases (31%) of the 106 patients who were hospitalized Table 2 The patterns of the disease in the two groups. and had follow-up CT and obtained within 24 h of presentation showed progression of the disease (Fig. 5) . The most outstanding CT features of the disease include rapidly-progressing basal and axial interstitial/alveolar consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacities (Fig. 5C ). Table 3 ). The one patient in group 1 who had focal disease involving only unilateral lower zones was admitted to ICU for dyspnea and died after 2 days. On CT scans, swelling of brain stem and bilateral thalamus were found (Fig. 6 ). There are 4 patients with pneumomediastinum in both groups that were only evident on high-resolution CT (Fig. 1 ). 20 cases (19%) of the 106 patients had small bilateral or unilateral pleural effusions. Pleural effusions decreased gradually on follow-up. None had evidence of hilar or mediastinal lymph node enlargement on CT performed at admission or later.
