There were 2366 male and 152,143 female nurses included in this study, representing 1.5 and 98.5%, respectively, of the study cohort ( Table 2 ). The mean age of the study cohort was 33.7 years with a standard deviation of 8.9 years, and the 19-29 age group had the highest number of nursing staff (n = 60,537; 39.2%), followed by the 30-39 age group (n = 60,002; 38.8%). About 24.2% of nurses (n = 37,464) worked at medical centers and 29.9% (n = 46,273) at regional hospitals. Our study analyzed hospitalization data from 2011 to 2013 and the results are shown in Table 3 . It was found that 33,267 numbers of nursing staff were hospitalized in this period. Most were female (n = 33,027; 99.3%), the average hospitalization age was 34.57 (7.70) years, and the 30-39 age group had the highest number of hospitalized nursing staff (n = 18,378; 55.2%). In terms of choice of site of hospitalization, most nursing staff were hospitalized at regional hospitals (n = 14,288; 42.9%), followed by medical centers (n = 12,826; 38.6%).

Complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium (630-679) Complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium ( From the 2011-2013 nursing staff hospitalization data, the length of hospitalization for nursing staff was 5.73 (AE15.63) days, and the mean number of hospitalizations was 1.35 per staff member. Regarding female nursing staff, 33,027 were hospitalized, accounting for 99.3% of all hospitalized nursing staff, the length of hospitalization was 5.74 (AE15.69) days, and the mean number of hospitalizations was 1.35 per staff member. As for male nursing staff, 240 were hospitalized, accounting for 0.7%, the length of hospitalization was 3.85 (AE3.02) days, and the mean number of hospitalizations was 1.23 per staff member. The crude hospitalization rate for nursing staff was 21.5%. The crude hospitalization rates for male and female nursing staff were 10.1% and 21.7%, respectively, and the highest rate of crude hospitalization was for the group aged 30-39 years old (30.6%), followed by those aged 60-65 years old (27.4%) ( Table 3) . The sample size and distribution of hospitalization age were significantly different between nursing staff and the general population, controlling for gender, calendar year, and age of the two populations. After adjusting for the differences between the groups, a standardized analysis of hospitalizations was performed. The results showed that the hospitalization risk for female nursing staff was significantly higher than that for the general population for infectious and parasitic diseases (SHR = 121.05, 95% CI = 112.66-129.89), diseases of the respiratory system (SHR = 105.12, 95% CI = 100.60-109.80), complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium (SHR = 102.59, 95% CI = 100.85-104.35), and diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (SHR = 109.71, 95% CI = 101.10-118.86). The difference in hospitalization risk for the category "symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions" did not reach statistical significance. Moreover, the hospitalization risk for female nursing staff in relation to the remaining 11 systemic disease diagnostic categories was lower than that of the general public (Table 4) . On the other hand, after controlling for gender, calendar year, and age, the hospitalization risk for injury and poisoning of the male nursing staff was significantly lower than that of the general population (SHR = 72.48, 95% CI = 52.23-97.98), while there were no significant differences in hospitalization risk for the remaining diagnosis of disorders from ICD-9-CM (Table 4) .
