Fitting three different models with a different assumed number of generations, the observed temporal patterns were well captured overall (Fig 3A) . Identifying a few best-fit models with a different number of generations, the most likely first date of exposure was in the range 26-28 July 2014, dating back 7-9 days from 4 August 2014 (S2 Table) . Regardless of the assumed number of generations, the first generation (i.e., generation 1) coincided with a small peak in the epidemic curve on 14 August; generation 2 was considered to be primarily responsible for the highest peak at the end of August (Fig 3B-3D ). Only when generation 4 was assumed to have existed, generation 3 was considered responsible for a small peak on about 7 September 2014. Table 2 summarizes the parameter estimates derived from the identified best model, given the assumed number of generations. The mean generation time from DENV infection in a human to another DENV infection in a human via a mosquito bite (i.e., μ IP + μ Trans ) was estimated at 17.2 days, 16.1 days, and 12.4 days for the assumed number of generations 2, 3, and 4, respectively. As the assumed number of generations increased, the estimated mean and standard deviation became significantly smaller, reflecting that the explainable transmission dynamics greatly varied by the assumed number of generations. The reproduction numbers in the absence of interventions were greater than the value of 1 by generation 2 (i.e., R 1 ) for the three models, and by generation 3 (i.e., R 2 ) if the assumed number of generations was 4. It should be noted that if the number of generations was 2, then the reproduction number of generation 3 (i.e., R 2 ) was not estimated but must have been zero (owing to the absence of generation 3). It should be noted that the latest estimate of R i was below the value of 1 and this was not surprising, because the epidemic came to an end in October 2014. The mosquito control and public awareness campaigns from 28 August 2014 were considered to have definitely reduced transmission, with secondary transmission reduced by an estimated 30%-70%, with a wide confidence interval (Table 2) . Using the AIC value as the weight, the ensemble estimates of ε 1 and ε 2 following model averaging over different assumed numbers of generations were 0.6 and 0.6, respectively. Despite these reductions, it appeared that the estimated effective reproduction number did not decline below the threshold value of 1 (Fig 4) . However, park closure in combination with the mosquito control and awareness campaigns successfully reduced the reproduction number. The relative reduction in the effective reproduction number owing to the closure of Yoyogi Park was estimated to be 20%-60%, again with a wide confidence interval (Table 2) ; however, the combined effect was estimated to be as large as a 44%-88% reduction in the reproduction number. These findings were robust for the assumed number of generations. We conducted model comparisons to assess the importance of accounting for the effectiveness of the abovementioned control measures. The sensitivity results are summarized in S3 Table. It appeared that the latest estimate of the reproduction number was sensitive to the presence of effectiveness parameters (ε 1 and ε 2 ). Regardless of whether the assumed number of generations was 2, 3, or 4, AICc values of the model with both ε 1 and ε 2 were minimal (AICc = 1855.1, 1856.0, and 1855.2 for models with 2, 3, and 4 generations, respectively), Note: Two-generation, three-generation, and four-generation models indicated that there were a total two, three, and four generations, excluding generation zero. Mean μ IP and standard deviation σ IP of the incubation period were assumed as the parameters governing the gamma distribution. Mean μ Trans and standard deviation σ Trans of the duration of the generation times, other than incubation period, were also assumed to follow a gamma distribution. R n-1 is the reproduction number of the n thgeneration infection in the absence of interventions. To account for the effectiveness of interventions, ε i was factored into the model as the relative reduction in the reproduction number owing to mosquito control (ε 1 ) and park closure (ε 2 ). MSE represents the mean squared error. AICc is the Akaike information criterion with a correction for small sample size, calculated as AICc = AIC+ (2k(k+1))/(n-k-1), where n is the number of data points (i.e., n = 156) and AIC = 2NLL+2k where NLL is the negative log-likelihood and k is the number of parameters. The model average is the average of three former modes with weight as a function of AIC, which was calculated as 0.35, 0.25, and 0.40. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007468.t002 Dengue control in Tokyo, 2014 outperforming models without one or both effectiveness parameters. S2 Fig compares the reproduction number for two-generation model over time, hypothetically examining counterfactual scenarios in which the relative reduction in the reproduction number during park closure, ε 2 (and mosquito control, measured by ε 1 ) is assumed at 1. If ε 2 was 1, the time at which the reproduction number declines would be delayed, indicating that the park closure has played an important role in reducing the transmissibility.
