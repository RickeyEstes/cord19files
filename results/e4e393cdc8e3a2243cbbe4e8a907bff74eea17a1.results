We considered it impractical to isolate the natural membrane-bound S glycoprotein from SARS-CoV and instead used a baculovirus/insect cell system to express an N-terminal fragment of S (nS) as a secreted glycosylated protein that could be readily purified under native conditions. The N-terminal 762 amino acids of the S protein was selected on the basis of hydrophilicity and secondary structure predictions using Kyte and Dolittle and Chou Fasman algorithms (McVector 7.2) and because it includes the region corresponding to S1 of other coronaviruses. A transfer vector was constructed in which the polyhedrin promoter regulates expression of a protein comprised of amino acids 14 to 762 of S preceded by the honeybee melittin signal peptide and followed by six histidines (Fig.  1A) . A baculovirus expressing nS was derived by recombination in insect cells. The yield of secreted and affinity purified nS was approximately 10 mg/l of culture supernatant, and a single major band of~110 kDa was seen by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1B , lane 1) or silver nitrate (Fig. 1B , lane 2). Upon Western blotting, the same 110-kDa band was recognized by antibodies to the polyhistidine tag and SARS-CoV S protein (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4) . Treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F reduced the mobility of the protein to~85 kDa, demonstrating that the higher than expected apparent mass was due to N-glycosylation (Fig. 1C) . To analyze immunogenicity, nS protein mixed with MPL + TDM or QS21 adjuvant was injected subcutaneously into BALB/c mice on days 0, 28, and 56. Control mice were immunized with adjuvant and a secreted form of the vaccinia virus membrane protein L1R that was also produced in the baculovirus system and purified by affinity chromatography (Fogg et al., 2004) . As an initial evaluation of immunogenicity, sera from the mice were tested for antibodies that recognize S protein expressed on the surface of cells by recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA/S) (Bisht et al., 2004) . Because the endoplasmic reticulum acts as a filter for misfolded proteins, S present on the cell surface is likely to be correctly folded. Although SARS-CoV-infected cells could be used for the same purpose, considerably higher containment levels would be required. Uninfected HeLa cells or HeLa cells infected with non-recombinant MVA or MVA/S were fixed and stained with pooled mouse serum followed by Alexa 594-conjugated-anti-mouse IgG and analyzed by confocal microscopy. The serum obtained from mice immunized with nS in QS21 or MPL + TDM adjuvant stained the surface of cells infected with MVA/S but did not detectably stain uninfected cells or cells infected with nonrecombinant MVA (Fig. 2) . In contrast, serum from control mice that were immunized with the vaccinia virus L1R protein stained cells infected with non-recombinant and MVA/S equally (not shown). These data indicated that the antibodies produced by nS were able to bind to the membrane-associated form of full-length S. The relative binding activity of pooled serum from mice immunized with nS and QS21 or MPL + TDM adjuvant was analyzed using nS as the capture antigen. Antibody was detected after the primary inoculation of nS with QS21 and the reciprocal ELISA titer was boosted to 1:409,600 after two more inoculations (Fig. 3A ). With MPL + TDM adjuvant, the antibody response to nS was detected only after boosting but subsequently reached approximately 25% of the level achieved with QS21. The IgG2a/IgG1 ratio is an indicator of Th1 help. The specific IgG2a/IgG1 titers from mice immunized with QS21 and MPL + TDM were 0.25 and 0.03, respectively, suggesting a greater Th1 response with the former adjuvant. A determining effect of adjuvant on helper T cell responses has been noted (Cribbs et al., 2003; Santos et , 2002) . For comparative purposes, we also determined the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio of serum previously obtained from mice immunized with MVA/S. Although the overall IgG titers were lower in mice immunized with MVA/S (Bisht et al., 2004) than with the nS protein, the IgG2a/IgG1 ratios were higher with values of 2 and 4 for pooled sera of mice immunized intranasally and intramuscularly, respectively. The high titer of nS-binding antibody and its recognition of full-length membrane-bound S encouraged us to evaluate the ability of the immune sera to neutralize the infectivity of SARS-CoV. Significant neutralizing activity was observed after the second inoculation of nS with either adjuvant (Fig.  3B) . However, the mean neutralizing titer of 1:1269 achieved with QS21 was 4.6-fold higher than that obtained with MPL + TDM. Thus, there was good correspondence between the relative binding and neutralizing activities of sera obtained with QS21 and MPL + TDM adjuvants. Subbarao et al. (2004) demonstrated that SARS-CoV replicates in the respiratory tract of BALB/C mice and that replication was reduced following passive administration of neutralizing antibody. In this model, peak titers were reached within 1 to 2 days depending on the dose and clearing occurred by 7 days. Two days after the intranasal administration of 10 5 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV, 10 8 TCID 50 of virus per g of lung was recovered in control mice immunized with the vaccinia virus L1R protein in either adjuvant (Fig. 4A ). By contrast, there was at least a 10 6 -fold reduction in viral load in the lungs of mice immunized with nS regardless of the adjuvant (Fig. 4A) . The difference was highly significant ( P = 0.0017) as determined using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric statistical method. Indeed, virus was detected in only one mouse out of seven in each of the test groups. The virus titers in the nasal turbinates showed a 10 3 -fold reduction relative to controls when nS was administered with MPL + TDM adjuvant and N10 4 -fold reduction when nS was given with QS21 (Fig. 4B) . The effect of vaccination with either adjuvant was highly significant when compared with controls ( P = 0.0017) determined as above. Virus was detected in the nasal turbinates of 4 of 7 test mice immunized with nS and the MPL + TDM adjuvant, whereas the titers were uniformly below detection in the turbinates of mice immunized with nS and QS21. The better protection obtained with the QS21 adjuvant was also statistically significant ( P = 0.0250), using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric statistical method corrected for ties, consistent with the higher binding and neutralizing antibody titers. The failure of the nS antibody response to be boosted after challenge (Fig. 3A ) was also consistent with the absence of virus replication.
