General symptoms of C. difficile-infected hamsters In the control group, all hamsters had light stool, wet perianal area and tail, less activity with response to stimuli, and a soft abdomen on day 1 after the C. difficile challenge; few animals had bloody stools as observed by naked eye. The majority of animals in the control group had damp claws and lower abdomen, curved or arched bodies with no activity, soft abdomen, disappeared balance, and shrugged fur on day 2 post-challenge; few animals died. All animals in the control group died by the end of day 4 post-challenge (Figure 2A ). In the empty plasmid group, animals subject to C. difficile challenge all had light stool and a wet perianal area and tail on day 1 post-challenge; some animals were less active but responded to stimuli; one animal died on day 2 post-challenge ( Figure 2A ). After L. lactis carrying the empty vector was administered again, diarrhea symptoms were alleviated in the infected animals. Till the end of the experiment, two animals still had diarrhea, but their perianal area and tail were not wet. In the secreted-protein plasmid group, two of the animals subject to C. difficile challenge had diarrhea on day 1, but their perianal area and tail were not wet. After recombinant L. lactis carrying the secreted-protein plasmid was administered again, diarrhea symptoms disappeared in the animals by day 4 post-challenge. In the membraneanchored group, animals had no symptoms of diarrhea (Table 4) .
