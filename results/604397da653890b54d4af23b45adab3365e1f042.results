Generation of recombinant MP-12 encoding NSs encoding a 17 to 25 aa. truncation Using reverse genetics for the RVFV MP-12 strain, we recovered 11 recombinant MP-12 viruses which encode NSs protein with a 17 to 25 aa. truncation (Fig. 1 ). These NSs mutants exhibited different plaque phenotypes in plaque assay (Fig. S1 ) suggesting possible variation of attenuation by each NSs mutant. The plaques of NSD6-30 and NSD56-80 were clear in neutral red stain, while other mutants made turbid plaques. To test the functions of each NSs protein, VeroE6 cells (type-I IFNincompetent) were mock-infected or infected with MP-12, rMP12-C13type (a control lacking NSs functions) [18] , and NSs mutants using an moi of 3. After 16 hours, cells were collected and the abundance of PKR was measured ( Fig. 2A) as described previously [17] . As expected, PKR was not detectable in cells infected with MP-12 by post-translational downregulation [17] , but was detected in cells mock-infected or infected with rMP12-C13type. However, cells infected with the MP-12 encoding partially truncated NSs did not decrease PKR abundance. Next, we tested if partial deletions within the NSs gene would affect the inhibition of IFN-b mRNA synthesis. Type-I IFNcompetent A549 cells were mock-infected or infected with MP-12, rMP12-C13type or NSs mutants at an moi of 3, and then total RNA was extracted at 7 hpi. Northern blot was performed using RNA probe specific to human IFN-b, ISG56 or RVFV anti-viralsense S RNA/N mRNA as described previously [66, 67] . We tested ISG56 gene, one of the genes controlled under IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE), to confirm the inhibition of host transcription suppression including IFN-b mRNA by NSs. As expected, cells infected with MP-12 inhibited the synthesis of IFNb and ISG56 mRNA, while those infected with rMP12-C13type induced both IFN-b and ISG56 mRNA (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, none of NSs mutants, including NSD210-230 lacking SAP30binding domain, had inhibited IFN-b mRNA synthesis. Viral replication of those mutants was significantly decreased in type-I IFN-competent MRC-5 cells (Fig. S2) . Therefore, it was concluded that a series of MP-12 encoding partially truncated NSs gene does not degrade PKR and inhibit IFN-b mRNA synthesis. In Western blot as shown in Fig. 2A , all NSs mutants, except for NSD249-265, could be detectable by using anti-RVFV mouse polyclonal antibody. It was possible the anti-RVFV polyclonal antibody does not sufficiently contain antibodies reactive to linear epitopes except for the C-terminus. Thus, we next tested the accumulation of NSD249-265 by using indirect immunofluorescent assay to know if the same anti-RVFV polyclonal antibody can recognize conformational epitopes on NSD249-265. 293 cells were transfected with in vitro synthesized RNA encoding NSs of MP-12, NSD249-265 or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) (control), and the cells were fixed with methanol at 16 hours post transfection. Nuclear filamentous inclusion was observed in cells expressing NSs of MP-12 or NSD249-265, while the specific signals of NSs accumulation were weaker in cells expressing NSD249-265 than those expressing MP-12 NSs (Fig. 3) . NSD249-265 was also accumulated in cytoplasm. Next, we tested the cellular localization of truncated NSs other than NSD249-265 by Western blot (Fig. 4) . We did not include NSD249-265 for the experiment as no antibodies were available to detect this NSs in Western blot. 293 cells were mock-infected or infected with MP-12 or NSs truncation mutants at an moi of 3. Cells were collected at 16 hpi, and nuclear and cellular fractions were analyzed for the presence of NSs proteins. MP-12 NSs were accumulated both at cytoplasm and nucleus, while N proteins were exclusively localized at cytoplasm, which is consistent with previous study [65] . Abundant accumulation of NSs in nucleus was only observed in cells infected with NSsD6-30, NSsD 31-55 and NSsD56-80, while other mutants, NSsD 81-105, NSsD106-130, NSsD131-155, NSsD156-180, NSsD181-205 and NSsD206-230, NSsD231-248 poorly accumulated NSs in nucleus.
