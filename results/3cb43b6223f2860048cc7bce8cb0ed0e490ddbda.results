LEISHDNAVAX is systemically distributed after intradermal administration Biodistribution of the vaccine was assessed in rats after intradermal (i.d.) injection of a 120 μg dose. Total DNA was extracted from tissue samples taken 24 h post injection and MIDGE-Th1 vector DNA quantified using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. Vector DNA was found in a varying number of animals per group and in all tissues except for bone marrow (Figure 1a ). The vector copy numbers per μg total DNA ranged from 4.04 × 10 3 (geometric mean, ovaries, 4/5 animals positive) to 2.55 × 10 9 (geometric mean, skin of injection site, all animals positive). Comparable distribution pattern after single or repeated administration Next, we tested whether repeated administration alters the distribution pattern or causes accumulation of vector DNA in tissues. One hundred and twenty micrograms of LEISHDNAVAX were administered to rats i.d. at the same site four times at weekly intervals. Vector DNA was quantified in total DNA extracted from tissue samples collected 24 h after the last injection. Distribution patterns and amounts of vector DNA were comparable 24 h after single and repeated injection (Figures 1a and b) . Copy numbers per μg total DNA ranged from 4.63 × 10 3 (geometric mean, lung tissue, 5/10 animals positive) to 4.50 × 10 7 (geometric mean, skin of injection site, all animals positive). MIDGE-Th1 vectors persist at injection site and in draining lymph nodes Persistence of MIDGE-Th1 vectors was examined 14 days and 60 days post treatment. Fourteen days after four injections LEISHDNAVAX was cleared from the majority of organs (Figure 1c ). High vector copy numbers per μg total DNA were found in skin of injection site (all animals positive, geometric mean: 3.45 × 10 6 copies) and in inguinal lymph nodes (7/10 animals positive, geometric mean: 2.88 × 10 4 copies). Sixty days after four injections, MIDGE-Th1 vectors were cleared from most tissues but persisted in inguinal lymph nodes (5/10 animals positive, geometric mean: 1.44 × 10 4 copies) and skin of injection site (all animals positive, geometric mean: 6.93 × 10 5 copies) (Figure 1d ).
