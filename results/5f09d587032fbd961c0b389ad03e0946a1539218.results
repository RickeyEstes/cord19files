An MS ODN with CCT repeats displayed an inhibitory effect on TLR7/9 activation in vitro To develop a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, considering the close relationship between IFN-α/β production and the development of autoimmune diseases, we selected a type I interferon (IFNα/β) bioassay, VSV protection assay, as a technical platform to screen the ODNs designed with the reference of the sequences of human microsatellite DNA for their inhibitory effects on type I IFN production. In the process, an MS ODN with CCT repeats, designated as SAT05f, was found to inhibit IFN-α production from cultured human PBMC stimulated by TLR7/9 agonists. To determine whether or not SAT05f could block TLR7 activation, serial-diluted inactivated RNA virus (Flu virus PR8) as a TLR7 agonist was used to induce type I IFN production by human PBMC. The anti-VSV activities of the supernatants from TLR7 agonist-stimulated PBMC were compared with those displayed by recombinant IFN-α2b. As shown in Figure 1a , the Flu virus PR8-induced supernatants of human PBMC could protect Vero E6 cells from VSV challenge. An 80-fold-diluted Flu virus PR8 was able to induce the similar antiviral activity as 256 IU/ml of IFN-α2b did and used for later experiments. We then tested the inhibitory effect of SAT05f on IFN production by Flu virus PR8-induced PBMC. Human PBMCs were cultured with inactivated Flu virus PR8 in presence of SAT05f, or two positive control ODNs of A151 and IRS954, or a negative control MS ODN (MS19) fro 48 h and the supernatants were assayed for the anti-VSV activities. The result showed that SAT05f displayed significant inhibition on IFN production and its potency was similar as that displayed by A151 and much stronger than that by IRS954 and MS19 (Fig. 1b) . To find an optimal dosage of SAT05f, PBMCs were incubated with inactivated Flu virus PR8 in the presence of MS19 or SAT05f at a dose range of 1-16 μg/ml for 48 h. It was found that PBMC from different donors responded to SAT05f variously and SAT05f at 8 μg/ml consistently inhibited IFN production from PBMC of all tested blood samples (data not shown). Upon this, SAT05f at 8 μg/ml was selected as the optimal dosage in later in vitro experiments. As shown in Figure 1c , SAT05f at 8 μg/ml remarkably inhibited Flu virus PR8-induced IFN production from PBMC of seven healthy blood donors (p b 0.001), indicating that SAT05f was an antagonist of TLR7 activation. In another set of experiment, inactivated Flu virus PR8 was replaced by imiquimod (a synthetic TLR7 agonist) as a stimulator, and SAT05f at dosages of 4-16 μg/ml could also display significant inhibitory effect on PBMC to produce IFN (Fig. 1d) . Overall, these results showed that SAT05f could inhibit TLR7 activation-induced IFN production. To test whether SAT05f could inhibit IFN production induced by TLR9 activation, inactivated DNA virus HSV-1 and CpG 2216 (an A-type CpG ODN) were used as stimulators. As shown in Figure 1e , 20-fold-diluted HSV-1 was able to display similar antiviral activity as 256 IU/ml of IFN-α2b did and used for later experiments. SAT05f was found to significantly inhibit inactivated HSV-1-induced IFN production from human PBMC with a much better efficacy than A151 (p = 0.019) (Fig. 1f) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1g) . SAT05f could also inhibit CpG 2216-induced IFN production from human PBMC in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1h) . These results indicate that SAT05f can also block TLR9 activation-induced IFN production.
