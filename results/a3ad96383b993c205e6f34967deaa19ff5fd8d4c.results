Fig 2 shows the distribution of procalcitonin concentrations in the five subgroups of children with and without infection. Procalcitonin was undetectable (<0-1 1 ng/mL) in 21 children without infection. At the time of diagnosis, 10 newborn infants and 9 older infants or children with severe bacterial infection (100%) had high serum concentrations of procalcitonin (6-53 ng/mL). Antibiotic treatment rapidly decreased procalcitonin concentrations (days 2-6 of treatment). Among the 5 infants and children with locoregional infection and the 6 newborn infants with skin bacterial colonisation and no sepsis, procalcitonin concentrations did not exceed 1-5 ng/mL (0-3-1-5 ng/mL). Of the 21 patients with viral infections, 18 (86%) had values within or slightly above the normal range (maximum 1-4 ng/mL); 2 children with gastroenteritis (1 coronavirus, 1 rotavirus) had values of 3-5 ng/mL and 8-0 ng/mL, and a child with acute hepatitis A had concentrations of 17 ng/mL on admission and 2 ng/mL on day 8. Serum procalcitonin concentrations varied widely among the 9 burns patients from 0-to 120 ng/mL. Three procalcitonin concentrations of 2 ng/mL and 3 ng/mL within 3 days of the burn; concentrations then fell progressively to normal (subgroup I). These patients did not have any infectious complications during the hospital stay. 3 patients (subgroup II) had higher values, up to 19 ng/mL. The peak concentrations were found at the onset of sepsis, confirmed by clinical and microbiological signs. In subgroup III, serum concentrations of 3 patients were high 1 day after the burn (14 ng/mL, 21 ng/mL, and 78 ng/mL) and continued to rise during the next few days, during acute septic episodes. 1 of these patients, who had severe infectious complications (E coli positive blood culture on day 4, septic shock on day 6, Pseudomonas aerwinosa positive culture on day 20), had high concentrations of procalcitonin in all serum samples; the highest value (120 ng/mL) was measured during septic shock. The 4th patient in subgroup III had toxic shock syndrome 18 days after the bum, and procalcitonin reached a maximum of 70 ng/mL at that time. Only 1 burns patient (subgroup II) died (pulmonary embolism 57 days after injury). Concentrations of mature calcitonin were normal at all times in both burns patients and children. Analysis of serum extracts by reverse-phase HPLC showed a major peak eluting at 37-39 min, as detected by several immunoassays (fig 4) . It is likely that this immunoreactive peak corresponded to the whole molecule of procalcitonin. Two other small peaks detected in some samples could not be identified. Calcitonin was consistently undetectable by a specific m-IRMA.
