The patient was identified as a possible PDAID case based on the unknown etiology of her meningoencephalitis. A cerebrospinal fluid sample from day 3 of her hospitalization was analyzed by clinical mNGS testing at University of California, San Francisco. DNA and RNA sequencing libraries yielded 12 706 666 and 11 080 133 reads, respectively. Analysis using the sequence-based ultra-rapid pathogen identification (SURPI+) clinical bioinformatics pipeline detected HEV. Assembly yielded a 95.6% complete viral genome with approximately 90% pairwise identity to the closest matched reference in GenBank (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1B) . Phylogenetic analysis assigned the genome to genotype 3a, most closely related to viral strains from Japan and Southeast Asia (Supplementary Figure 1C) . The diagnosis of HEV-associated meningoencephalitis was communicated to the patient. Review of the patient's electronic medical record showed normal transaminase levels before lung transplantation, with persistent low-level elevations after transplantation in 2011 (Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B) . The patient was readmitted 2 weeks after being discharged with new decompensated liver disease, encephalopathy, asterixis, ascites, and cirrhosis by abdominal ultrasound and liver elastography. The HEV mNGS results prompted immediate follow-up clinical testing demonstrating serum HEV immunoglobulin M (IgM) positivity, negative immunoglobulin G (IgG), and plasma HEV viremia (5 960 000 international units [IU]/mL) ( Table 1 , Supplementary Figure 2C ), and treatment with ribavirin and low-dose diuretics. Hepatitis E virus RNA declined, transaminases normalized, and ascites, edema, and mentation improved, but the patient subsequently had 2 readmissions for headache, nausea, and vomiting attributed to tacrolimus toxicity or side effects from ribavirin, necessitating multiple ribavirin treatment interruptions. The case was reported to the United Network for Organ Sharing donor safety net. Testing of stored donor serum was positive for HEV IgG and IgM antibody but negative for HEV RNA. The donor was reported to be a 50-year-old woman with methamphetamine use from Central California without clear risk factors for HEV infection or abnormal transaminase levels. Pretransplant samples from the case patient were not available.
