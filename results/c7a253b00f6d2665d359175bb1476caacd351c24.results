A total of 50 NPA specimens isolated from serologically confirmed SARS patients collected during the first 3 days of illness were studied. Of these, 11 (22%) were positive in our previously reported conventional RT-PCR assay (Table 1) . We reasoned that the poor sensitivity of SARS-CoV RT-PCR detection in the early stage of the illness could be enhanced by increasing the initial extraction volume of the NPA sample from 140 to 560 ml. Using this modified RNA extraction protocol, the sensitivity of the conventional RT-PCR assay doubled from 11/50 to 22/50 (Table 1) . The overall detection rate of the modified RT-PCR protocol was statistically different from that of our first generation RT-PCR protocol (McNe-mar's test, P B/0.001, Table 1 ). Of 30 negative control samples, one false positive result was observed. With the RNA extraction modification, the sensitivity and specificity of the conventional RT-PCR on specimens collected during the first 3 days of illness was 44.0% and 96.6%, respectively. To further improve the detection of SARS-CoV in samples from early onset, we adopted a highly sensitive real-time quantitative assay for SARS-CoV detection (Fig. 1A) . With the modified RNA extraction protocol, 40 out of 50 NPA samples were positive in the real-time assay (Fig. 1B and Table 1 ). The overall detection rate of the modified RT-PCR protocol was statistically different from the other two assays (McNemar's test, P B/0.0001, Table 1 ). In particular, 63% of the NPA samples isolated on day 1 of disease onset was positive in the real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay. By contrast, none of the specimens isolated on day 1 was positive in the conventional RT-PCR assay. For samples isolated on days 2 √Å/3, more than 81% of these samples was positive in the quantitative assay (Table 1) . With the modified RNA extraction protocol and realtime PCR technology, the specificity and sensitiv- ity of the quantitative assay towards early SARS samples were 80% and 100%, respectively. The real-time assay also allowed one to quantitate the viral loads of these clinical specimens (1 copy/reaction0/27.8 copies/ml of a NPA sample). As shown in Fig. 2 , the progression of the disease resulted in an increase of viral loads in NPA (open bars). In addition, we further examined the viral loads of clinical samples that were negative (n0/ 39) in our first generation RT-PCR assay (Fig. 2 , grey bars). As expected, the viral loads of these samples (grey bars) were much lower that the overall viral loads of the whole cohort (open bars).
