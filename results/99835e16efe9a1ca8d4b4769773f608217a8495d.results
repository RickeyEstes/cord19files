Data provided a range of participant experiences and perceptions about their experience of SARS. Perceptions yielded both experiential and descriptive information, but also important issues for consideration in health policy and practice planning. Key themes include: interrupted informational flow during the SARS outbreaks; vulnerability and moral doubt; need for effective and responsive leadership; and expedient development of practice guidelines in the shifting landscape of pandemic outbreak. Each dominant theme is documented below, along with the frequency of identification (presented in percentages) and verbatim quotes (in italics) that demonstrate their application within interviews. Each theme is clearly supported with 'thick description' [20] from interviews/transcripts.
