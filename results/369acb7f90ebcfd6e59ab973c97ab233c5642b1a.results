Altogether, samples from 335 domestic cats were included in the study. All cats had owners -no stray or shelter animals were included. The mean age of cats in this study was 4.9 years (range 5 months to 18 years). A total of 155 females (46.3%) and 180 males (53.7%) were included in the research. Of the 155 females, 90 (58.1%) were intact and 65 (41.9%) were spayed; of the 180 males, 119 (66.1%) Figure 2 Origin of the samples collected in this study (map scheme: www.terkepek.net). On the map of Hungary, the 24 locations from where the blood samples were taken are indicated (red and green pinpoints). Cities highlighted with green pinpoints are the locations of partially sequenced FIV strains. Beside the name of city, number in brackets indicate how many sequences were obtained from that location were intact and 61 (33.9%) were castrated. Seventy-seven cats were kept strictly indoors (23.0%) and 258 had outdoor access (77.0%). A total of 136 cats were found to be clinically healthy during the physical examination. We observed an overall low prevalence of vaccination: only 98 (29.3%) were immunised at some point of their lifespan, usually with a combined vaccine, and among these cats, only 39 (11.6%) were vaccinated against FeLV (however, two of them proved to be FeLV-infected). Of was observed in the case of FIV infection for every year older the cats were. We could not find significant correlation of infection status with sex (although males were 1.32 times more likely to have FIV and/or be FeLVinfected than females [95% CI 0.71-2.5, P = 0.3872]). The same was observed for neutering status: there was a 1.34 times higher risk for intact males to be infected (95% CI 0.57-3.42; P = 0.5187) and a 0.78 higher risk for intact females (95% CI 0.3-2.08; P = 0.609), but these data were not statistically significant. Altogether, we were able to sequence 22 partial pol genes out of the 47 FIV PCR-positive cases. We suspect that the rest of the samples contained insufficient amounts or poor quality nucleic acids. Multiple alignments and maximum likelihood tree reconstructions revealed that all of the strains were clustered into subtype B (Figure 3) . Within clade B, the Hungarian sequences were located into a monophyletic group that also included a strain originating from Joinville, Brazil, 2017 (acc. number: KY629414.1). Within this 'Hungarian' cluster, the strains formed several subgroups of closely related sequences that mostly reflected the geographic location of their origin. The subgroups were supported by relatively high bootstrap values. Pairwise genetic analyses revealed that the overall mean genetic similarity between the analysed strains was 98.2% (the lowest similarity was 88.1% and the highest was 99.8%). Only two strains originated from indoor cats and the majority of these cats were males (16 males, six females). The samples represent most of geographic regions of Hungary (Figure 2 ). GenBank accession numbers are MN401425-MN401446.
