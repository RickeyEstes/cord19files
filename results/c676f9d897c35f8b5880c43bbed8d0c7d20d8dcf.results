In the MHC-restricted cytotoxic lymphocyte test using autologous testicular cells as targets and mesenteric lymphocytes as effectors, the percent specific lysis in all calves was less than 10% which is considered as negative or non-significant [9] . Lymphocytes of calf 9 inoculated with attenuated BCV showed no specific lysis at 1 week after infection but showed a 9.9% specific lysis at 3 weeks after infection. Of the calves inoculated with virulent BCV, calf 2 showed specific lysis of 4.2 and 0.9%, at 1 and 2 weeks postinfection, respectively; calf 6 showed no specific lysis at any interval studied; and calf 7 showed a specific lysis of 2.3% at 1 week after infection. Uninfected control calves showed no specific lysis at any of the intervals studied. The differences in specific lysis among various groups of calves were not significant at any time interval. Even the incorporation of 50 IU/ml of recombinant bovine IL-2 (rlL-2, American Cyanamid, Princeton, N.J.) did not increase specific lysis. Although IL-2 caused an increase in counts per minute (cpm), a parallel increase was observed in spontaneous lysis indicating that the percent specific lysis remained the same. The T cell subsets (Tc/T s and TH/TD) were enumerated in an indirect fluorescent antibody test using antibodies against T lymphocyte surface markers. In calf 7, that was infected with virulent BCV, the number of Tc/Ts population decreased from 10.5% before infection to 2% at 6 days postinfection (Fig. 1 ). In addition, this calf experienced a decrease of TH/To population as compared to the control and attenuated virus-inoculated calves (Fig. 2) . On histopathological examination of mesenteric lymph nodes of the calves inoculated with the virulent virus, severe depletion of lymphocytes was noticed in Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes when compared to uninfected controls.
