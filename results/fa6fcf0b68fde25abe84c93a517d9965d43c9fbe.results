A Gain-of-Function Screen Reveals SERPINE1 Encoding PAI-1 as an Inhibitor of IAV Spread To identify ISG effectors targeting late stages of the IAV life cycle, we established a high-throughput, image-based screen using an extended version of a recently published ISG library comprising 401 cDNAs (Schoggins et al., 2011;  Table S1 ). Human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549) were transduced with lentiviral vectors to express individual ISGs ( Figure 1A ). After 48 hr, cells were challenged with IAV WSN/33 (H1N1) at an MOI of 0.01. Red, transduced cells; green, infected cells; blue, DAPI-stained nuclei. (B) Effect of 401 single ISGs on IAV spread. ISGs inhibiting more than 2-fold SD in two independent screens are shown in red. Spread ratio, the ratio of infected cells at 24/8 hpi. A positive control for inhibition is a-HA antibody. (C) Confirmation assays for selected ISGs on A549 cells or primary NHBE cells. Data are represented as mean Â± SEM from n = 6 values in two independent experiments for A549, and n = 3 for NHBE cells. ''Spread ratio'' was calculated from the number of infected cells at 24 hr post-infection (hpi) relative to 8 hpi for each ISG ( Figures  1A and S1A ). The screen was performed twice, using independently generated lentivirus libraries ( Figure 1B) . a-HA antibody, with a spread ratio of $2, was a positive control, whereas empty vector controls had a spread ratio of 50 to 60 ( Figures S1C and 1B) . Nineteen ISGs reduced the IAV spread ratio to <20, greater than two SDs from the empty vector control in both screens ( Figure 1B and Table S2 ). Among these ISGs were several broadly acting antiviral factors involved in pattern recognition and IFN signaling, such as DDX58 (RIG-I), IFIH1 (MDA5), IRF2, IRF7, IL28RA (IFNLR1), inflammatory cytokines, CCL5 (RANTES), and broadly acting or IAV-specific inhibitors, such as IFITM3, Mx1, and BST2 (Schneider et al., 2014) . IFITM3 and Mx1 act early (IAV entry or replication), whereas BST2, also known as tetherin, prevents release of budding virus particles at the host cell surface. Although conflicting data exist on IAV inhibition by tetherin (Mangeat et al., 2012; Watanabe et al., 2011; Yondola et al., 2011) , it potently inhibited spread in A549 cells and was subsequently used as a positive control. We also identified a number of ISGs with previously uncharacterized antiviral activities: MAP3K14, ELF1, PMM2, FAM46C, TBX3, SCO2, CRY1, TNFSF10 (TRAIL), XAF1, MAFF, and SERPINE1 (serine protease inhibitor, member E1). We validated this set of genes with independently generated, high-titer lentiviral stocks and A549 cells, as well as normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE). All but FAM46C, which did not inhibit virus spread on NHBE cells, were confirmed as antiviral ( Figure 1C ). To exclude false positives due to cytotoxicity, we tested cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA damage, and cell death profiles by high-throughput microscopy (HTM) (Figure S1D) . We found that only expression of MAP3K14, the most potent hit in our screen, and TNFSF10 were cytotoxic relative to the empty vector control. Because protease inhibitors have been used clinically to treat other viruses (e.g., HIV), an endogenous effector with a similar function was a promising lead. We therefore focused on exploring the antiviral action of SERPINE1, encoding PAI-1. SERPINE1 expression inhibited spread of various clinical IAV isolates, including a derivative of a highly pathogenic avian H5 influenza virus, modified to remove the polybasic cleavage site in the viral hemagglutinin (Steel et al., 2009) , A/Vietnam/1203/2004(HALo) (H5N1), the pandemic A/California/04/2009 (H1N1), and an isolate of swine origin, A/sw/Texas/4199-2/1998 (H3N2) ( Figure 1D ). In multi-step viral growth kinetics, SERPINE1 expression reduced extracellular IAV WSN/33 titers $10-fold, comparable to inhibition by tetherin ( Figure 1E ). This versatile SERPIN family member has been implicated in many physiological processes, including regulation of fibrinolysis (reviewed in Declerck and Gils, 2013) . However, since an antiviral effector function of PAI-1 protein in the context of the intrinsic immune response is novel, we set out to determine its role in restricting IAV infection. IAV Infection Enhances Secretion of PAI-1, which Is Both Necessary and Sufficient for IAV Inhibition We first studied the kinetics of SERPINE1 gene expression, as well as PAI-1 protein production and secretion. We compared A549 cells and the more relevant in vitro model of NHBE-derived, differentiated human ciliated airway epithelium cultures (HAEC), which mimic both the morphology and physiology of the airway epithelium in vivo. In A549 cells, SERPINE1 mRNA was slightly upregulated upon IFN-b stimulation and following infection with IAV WSN/33 ( Figure 2A ). This was not due to nonresponsiveness of A549 cells, since other ISGs were highly upregulated ( Figures S2A-S2C ). TGF-b is known to trigger SERPINE1 expression via the canonical Wnt/b-catenin pathway (He et al., 2010) . Indeed, TGF-b treatment of A549 cells strongly induced SERPINE1 expression with no or modest effects on ISG15, IFITM3, and BST2 mRNA levels ( Figures S2A-S2D ). Stimulation of SERPINE1 gene expression led to increased intracellular and extracellular levels of PAI-1 ( Figures 2B, 2C , S2E, and S2F). Consistent with PAI-1 being efficiently secreted, total PAI-1 levels in the supernatant were about 16-fold higher than in respective IFN-b-treated cell lysates at 24 hr (Figures 2B and 2C) . We observed apical secretion of PAI-1 by HAEC after either IAV WSN/33 infection ( Figure 2D ) or TGF-b treatment (Figure S2G) . Of note, even mock-treated A549 cells and HAEC constantly produced and secreted basal levels of PAI-1 that accumulated over time ( Figures 2B-2D ). However, PAI-1 is further upregulated by certain stimuli, including virus infection. To test possible IAV inhibition by extracellular PAI-1, we added recombinant active PAI-1 (rPAI-1) to the supernatant of A549 cells during IAV infection. rPAI-1 decreased IAV WSN/33 spread in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2E ). Conversely, we used a polyclonal a-PAI-1 antibody that targets the a-helix F of PAI-1 to neutralize PAI-1's ability to inhibit proteases (Komissarov et al., 2005) . Strikingly, we found that addition of a-PAI-1 antibody to A549 cells during infection significantly enhanced IAV spread compared to the IgG control ( Figure 2E ). Thus far, the extracellular environment in our experiments was defined by components of the growth medium or by proteins secreted by the cultured cells (endogenous or overexpressed). To test the potency of PAI-1 in a more natural setting, we examined IAV growth kinetics on HAEC in the presence or absence of rPAI-1. Strikingly, addition of rPAI to the apical side of HAEC significantly reduced IAV growth compared to carrier control, with $10-fold lower infectivity at 48 hpi ( Figure 2F ). In contrast, addition of a-PAI-1 antibody dramatically enhanced IAV growth as early as 12 hpi and continued throughout the course of infection. In both A549 cells and HAEC, human parainfluenzavirus 3 (HPIV3) was unaffected by either of these treatments, showing that the effect was selective for IAV and not due to cytotoxicity ( Figures S2H and S2I) . Experiments probing which stage of the viral life cycle was affected by PAI-1 showed no effects on early stages, replication, or egress ( Figures S3A-S3E ). However, a reduction of progeny particle infectivity ( Figure S3F ), together with the extracellular presence of PAI-1 ( Figure 2 ) and its well-described function as protease inhibitor (Declerck and Gils, 2013) , led us to investigate this activity as the mechanistic basis of PAI-1-mediated IAV inhibition.
