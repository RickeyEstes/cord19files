The first cases of human-to-human 2019-nCoV infection occurred mid-December 2019, To date, the total confirmed cases and confirmed death surpassed SARS by a magnitude within a shorter period of time 1 . In an attempt to associate the pathologic property of 2019-nCoV with specific virulence factor, we compared the epidemiological 5 information with sequencing data obtained from the WHO 2 . We compared the rate of (Fig S1A) . At the amino acid levels, they only had a few random 20 substitutions at positions with consensus sequences identical to the corresponding amino acid sequences in human and bat SARS (Fig S1B) . author/funder.

Considering potential sequencing errors at both ends, the genome sequence variations among different strains of 2019-nCoV isolated from patients located in different cities were low considering only 5 several mutations in about 30kb genome per isolate. Based on the nucleotide positions 8517 and 27641, the 2019-nCoV strains can be divided into two major groups (Figs 2A and S2). All the group 1 strains have thymine at 8517 and cytosine at 27641, which are same as corresponding nucleotides in SARS, whereas the group 2 stains have cytosine at 8517 and thymine at 27641 (Figs 2A and S3) . Epidemiological data G1 and G2 strains 10 revealed that the collection date and location of the earliest G1 strain (EPI_ISL_406801) was January 5 th , 2020 in Wuhan, whereas the earliest G2 strain was isolated in December 24 th , 2019 in Wuhan (Fig 2A) . The existence of both genetic groups in the same city indicated co-circulation, but evolved convergently at the early outbreak. Within each group, we also observed additional shared mutations added to multiple strains. Based on 15 these potentially inheritable mutations and the identifying times and locations, we generated a mutation tree map to track individual shared mutations and show the relationships among different isolates (Fig 2A and S2 ). For example, five strains identified in Guangdong from Jan. 10-15 all share the same mutation in nucleotide position 28578 on the background of group 1 might be transmitted by the same person. The similar strain 20 may transmit to three patients identified in Japan on Jan. 29-31 with additional mutation at nucleotide position 2397 and to a patient identified in USA on Jan. 22 with additional mutation at nucleotide position 10818. The G10818T is very interesting as it is shared by author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

It is not clear if the common mutation both in group 1 and group 2 strains at 10818 site has any growth advantage but pangolin and bat CoV have L3606V substitution at the same position ( Fig S3) . When the group 1 and group 2 strains were placed onto geographic map (Fig 2B) , it seems that 5 both groups have been transmitted to most countries and regions with reported 2019-nCoV cases with few exceptions, suggesting these two groups are rapidly transmissible. The most closely related strain, betacoronavirus RaTG13, was isolated from Rhinolophus affinis 15 (Fig 3A) . We performed additional phylogenetic analyses using nucleotide sequences for specific viral proteins such asorf1a, spike, matrix and (Table S1 ). The clade II viruses include 49 of bat SARS viruses (bat SARS CoV II) such as ZXC21 and ZC45, which share about 90% overall nucleotide and amino acid identity as the 2019-nCoV (Table S2 ).

Previous structural analysis have demonstrated that the 13-14 amino acid region of the SARS RBM forms a distinct loop structure, which is stabilized with a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues 9,15,16,21 . Although the amino acid sequences of 2019-nCoV within this loop region are very different from those 5 of human SARS, the two cysteine residues are conserved (Fig. 4B) . Interestingly, all the CoV viruses known to use ACE2 as entry receptor are within the clade I, including the 2019-nCoV, which can also infect cells through ACE2 receptor-based on recent studies 22 (Fig. S5 ). On the other hand, there is no report on using ACE2 as entry receptor for the clade II viruses, despite their overall genome sequence homology with 2019-nCoV.
