Tmprss2 and Tmprss4 are coexpressed in alveolar and bronchial regions. It was described previously that Tmprss2 is expressed in type 2 pneumocytes and bronchial epithelial cells (24) , the main target cells for influenza A viruses (25, 26) . TMPRSS4 is an additional protease with in vitro HA cleavage potential (10, 27) . Therefore, we examined the expression profile of Tmprss4 in mouse lung tissues. We performed in situ hybridization (ISH) analyses to differentiate between type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECI and AECII, respectively) in noninfected mouse lungs. As shown in Fig. 1A , round and mostly cuboidal AECII were detected by expression of the cell type-specific marker surfactant-associated protein C (Sftpc; stained blue). Thin and flat AECI could be identified by expression of the cell type-specific marker aquaporin 5 (Aqp5; stained red). In addition, we used immunohistochemical staining to detect expression of both TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4. Staining could be observed in cuboidal and granular cells of alveolar tissue, representing AECII (Fig. 1B) , as well as in the bronchiolar epithelium (Fig. 1C) .
