Drug repositioning strategy and compound screen. To meet the need for new anticryptosporidial drug candidates, we adopted a drug repositioning strategy to capitalize on existing benzoxaborole scaffolds and knowledge from advanced programs within Anacor's Neglected Tropical Disease portfolio, which included antikinetoplastid programs with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) and the Global Alliance for Veterinary Medicine (GALVmed), an antimalarial program with the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), and an internal antibacterial leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) inhibitor program. A library of 7802 compounds, including analogs similar to four chemical scaffolds with antiprotozoal activity, was screened in duplicate for inhibition of C. parvum growth within MDCK cells using high content microscopy and adaptation of a previously described screening assay ( Fig. 1 ) 32 . This screen yielded 403 hits with >70% inhibition at a concentration of 1 µM. Confirmatory dose-response assays were conducted in triplicate on 400 compounds available for follow-up, and an additional 222 compounds were tested to complete structure activity relationship (SAR) analyses for each scaffold. Further prioritization was then done by conducting a preliminary mouse efficacy study with one compound representative of each chemical scaffold that was selected based on availability of chemical stocks, existing potency and mouse PK data, and the potential to leverage other programs within Anacor's Neglected Tropical Disease portfolio. AN7973 was selected # of hits in series: Lowest EC 50 Fig. 1 Screening results and prioritization considerations. Confirmed anticryptosporidial screening hits, lowest EC 50 , and prioritization considerations for four benzoxaborole chemical scaffolds are shown. The 6-carboxamide antitrypanosomal chemical scaffold was prioritized for further study based on a large number of available analogs, existing safety data from a human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) drug development program, and the results of a preliminary murine efficacy study for further development based on these considerations, and the remaining scaffolds were retained as alternates worthy of revisiting if necessary. AN7973 (Fig. 2a) is a benzoxaborole 6-carboxamide representative of a class of compounds active against Trypanosoma brucei, the cause of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). This class of compounds is currently in human trials 33, 34 . The 6-carboxamide SCYX-7158 (AN5568/acoziborole) exhibits favorable PK properties in animals and humans, e.g., prolonged exposure and halflife, and has the potential to provide a single-dose cure for HAT 35 . Related benzoxaboroles from the 6-carboxamide class have also shown good in vitro activity against human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) due to T. br. brucei, T. br. gambiense, and T. br. rhodesiense, and African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) due to T. congolense and T. vivax. 36, 37 . Members of this class have also shown favorable safety profiles, which enhanced the status of AN7973 for the repositioning strategy of this program. AN7973 selectively inhibits Cryptosporidium development. The structure and purity of AN7973 were determined by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, high resolution mass spectral analysis (HRMS), and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2) . In vitro inhibition of the Bunch Grass Farm (BGF) C. parvum Iowa isolate by 48 h of exposure to AN7973 in HCT-8 cells was confirmed repeatedly, with the measured EC 50 ranging from 0.13 µM to 0.43 µM. Comparable activity was observed for inhibition of field C. parvum isolates, and the C. parvum Iowa isolate sourced from the University of Arizona Sterling Laboratory (this isolate has been propagated independently of the BGF isolate for ∼20 years). AN7973 also inhibited the C. hominis TU502 isolate, but with 3-fold to 4-fold higher EC 50 (Fig. 2b) . Cytotoxicity as assessed in three cell lines was not observed at concentrations up to 25 µM (i.e., the highest concentration tested (Supplementary  Table 1 )), yielding a selectivity index for inhibition of Cryptosporidium of greater than 50 in all cases. The anticryptosporidial activity of AN7973 was further examined using a panel of in vitro assays to determine its mode of action 38 . AN7973 had no activity in an assay for C. parvum invasion of HCT-8 host cells (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). It predominantly affected intracellular Cryptosporidium development, since it arrested new DNA synthesis as reflected by inhibition of incorporation of the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2′deoxyuridine (EdU) into newly synthesized DNA (Fig. 2c) potency in reducing the percent of parasites expressing the meiotic recombination protein DMC1, which is a biomarker for Cryptosporidium sexual development 38 . Unlike some compounds, e.g., the piperazine-based lead MMV665917, that have equal potency against asexual and sexual stage parasites 38 , AN7973 inhibited asexual parasite growth four times more potently than asexual-stage to sexual-stage differentiation (Fig. 2d) , which was felt to be consistent with its effect on intracellular replication. Treatment of cryptosporidiosis in immunocompromised individuals such as malnourished children, AIDS patients, and transplant patients might be expected to require a parasiticidal compound. Consistent with this hypothesis, C. parvum time-kill curve assays showed that the approved drug nitazoxanide, which is effective in immunocompetent adults but equivalent to a placebo in AIDS patients, is likely parasitistatic or very slow acting (Fig. 3a) 19 . Time-kill curve data were referenced to the vehicle control for each time point in order to isolate the effect of compounds from the spontaneous decline in C. parvum numbers that occurs after 24 to 48 h of in vitro culture. This demonstrated the absence of nitazoxanide-dependent parasite elimination (Fig. 3b) . AN7973, on the other hand, appeared to act rapidly and drove progressive elimination of C. parvum in vitro in the absence of immune pressure (Fig. 3c, d) . In vitro parasite elimination in the presence of AN7973 was exponential with a half-life of ∼9.2 h, and ∼92 h required for 99.9% parasite reduction. The maximum rate of parasite elimination was achieved at ∼3 × EC 90 (0.63 µM). Pharmacokinetic properties of AN7973. In anticipation of progression to mouse and calf models of cryptosporidiosis, we evaluated the pharmacokinetic properties of AN7973 in these species. When administered intravenously to CD-1 mice at a dose of 2 mg per kg as a solution in a polyethylene glycol/propylene glycol/water vehicle, AN7973 exhibited a high C max (6.82 μg per mL), very low clearance (CL = 40 mL•h −1 •kg −1 ), high exposure (AUC 0-inf = 49.7 h•μg −1 •mL −1 ), and long half-life (t 1/2 = 6 h). When administered orally to CD-1 mice at a dose of 10 mg per kg as a suspension in 1% CMC/0.1% Tween-80 aqueous vehicle, AN7973 showed very high C max (8.63 μg per mL) and exposure (AUC 0-inf = 92.7 h•μg −1 •mL −1 ), a long half-life (t 1/2 = 6.6 h) and modest bioavailability (F = 37%) (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4a ). When dosed orally to calves at a dose of 5 mg per kg in the 1% CMC/0.1% Tween-80 aqueous vehicle, AN7973 exhibited high C max (3.57 μg per mL), very high exposure (AUC 0-inf = 190 h•μg −1 •mL −1 ), and a half-life about five In both the mouse and calf PK studies, we also quantified AN7973 in feces, as we expected that at least some of the antiparasitic activity could be related to direct exposure of parasites to the drug in this matrix. In the mouse study, concentrations of AN7973 in feces generally increased over the 16 h period following oral dosing but were highly variable ( Supplementary Fig. 4b ). In calves dosed orally, considerably lower variability was observed between animals, and concentrations of AN7973 remained high through the entire 168 h observation period ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ). Efficacy in acute and established murine cryptosporidiosis. AN7973 efficacy was first tested in vivo using a NOD scid IL2rg null (NOD scid gamma (NSG)) mouse model, which is a model of established C. parvum infection 19 . Treatment was begun 7 days after infecting mice by oral gavage with the C. parvum Bunch Grass Farms Iowa isolate. The positive control compound paromomycin reduced fecal parasite shedding by ∼90% after 4 days of treatment. On the other hand, after 4 days of treatment, AN7973 reduced parasite shedding by >99% at a dose of 25 mg per kg and by >90% at a dose of 10 mg per kg administered once daily by oral gavage (Fig. 4a) . NSG mice treated with AN7973 gained weight normally, and no adverse effects were observed. The interferon gamma knockout (IFN-γ KO) mouse is another widely used Cryptosporidium animal model 17, [39] [40] [41] . Unlike lethal infection reported by some investigators, C. parvum infection of IFN-γ KO mice produces a self-resolving acute infection in our hands. Various doses of AN7973 were tested using this model and the C. parvum University of Arizona Iowa isolate. Clofazimine, which is parasitistatic and lacks efficacy against Cryptosporidium in the NSG mouse 19 , was used as a positive control 17 . AN7973 demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy, including efficacy at a dose of 10 mg per kg once daily. Maximal efficacy was similar to that seen with clofazimine ( Fig. 4b) . As was the case for NSG mice, AN7973 caused no adverse effects in IFN-γ KO mice. AN7973 efficacy in neonatal calves. Mice infected with C. parvum do not develop diarrhea, but neonatal dairy calves infected with C. parvum develop a self-limited illness much like that seen in infants and characterized by severe watery diarrhea, dehydration, and fecal oocyst shedding 42 . We therefore used a neonatal calf model to test the effect of AN7973 treatment on diarrhea and dehydration, in addition to its effect on parasite shedding. For this, an initial small efficacy study was conducted during which the effect of infection on PK was also assessed. These data were then used to guide the design of additional dosing regimens (Fig. 5a) . One-day-old to two-day-old bull calves were infected by oral administration of ∼5 × 10 7 C. parvum Bunch Grass Farms Iowa isolate oocysts. Fecal parasite shedding was measured daily using qPCR, and the animals were assessed clinically at least twice daily for diarrhea, hydration status, appetite, and overall health status. Clinical observations were quantified using previously described scales ranging from 1 (normal) to 3 (severely abnormal) for fecal consistency, overall health status, hydration status, and appetite (see Supplementary Table 2) All calves tolerated AN7973 well, based on at least twice daily assessment of alertness, interaction with caregivers, and appetite (see Supplementary Table 2 (Fig. 5b, d and e) . Once daily 10 mg per kg AN7973 also reduced peak parasite shedding and diarrhea. However, despite equal or better mean plasma exposures in animals treated with once daily 10 mg per kg vs. twice daily 5 mg per kg AN7973, fecal parasite shedding resumed and persisted in the once daily treated animals (Fig. 5b) . Based on these data, it was unlikely that plasma exposures alone were driving efficacy, suggesting that gastrointestinal exposure to AN7973 was important. Major questions addressed in a second calf study included whether the dosing duration could be shortened, and whether or not fully sick animals would respond to treatment. These questions were addressed, respectively, by testing a 3-day regimen of 6.67 mg per kg three times daily, and testing the efficacy of 10 mg per kg twice daily for 7 days when treatment was delayed until the peak of diarrhea. Even when administered beginning at the peak of symptoms on day 4 after infection, twice daily 10 mg per kg AN7973 cured diarrhea 3 days faster than in controls, and parasite shedding was abolished by day 14 (Fig. 5c) . Total parasite shedding was reduced by greater than 1 log (Fig. 5d) . Treatment with 6.67 mg per kg three times per day for 3 days eliminated diarrhea, and reduced the rate of parasite shedding by ∼3 log during treatment. However, a parasitological relapse followed (Fig. 5c) , suggesting that >3 days and ≤7 days of treatment will be required. Finally, several of the AN7973 treatment regimens significantly reduced the overall severity of dehydration (Fig. 5f) , a surprising result given that all of the animals received aggressive treatment to minimize dehydration. Safety profiling. AN7973 possessed favorable stability, PK (e.g., mouse t 1/2 = 6 h), and safety characteristics (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3 ). It was negative in the Ames test for mutagenic potential, was negative in an in vitro micronucleus genotoxicity assay, had no significant findings in Ricerca Bioscience's Lead Profiling and Adverse Reaction Enzyme offtarget-panel (total # of assays: 109), and was negative for inhibition of the hERG K + ion channel, which is associated with cardiac tachyarrhythmias. Administration of AN7973 by daily oral gavage to male rats at 80 mg per kg per day for seven days was well tolerated, and there were no clinical signs (e.g., changes in activity or grooming (see methods)), weight loss, changes in food consumption, or pathology observed. Slight changes to red blood cell parameters, serum alkaline phosphatase, and serum triglycerides occurred, which were not considered clinically significant. No compound accumulation was observed in a toxicokinetic analysis done in parallel (Supplementary Table 3 ). Based on these data, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of AN7973 was concluded to be greater than 80 mg per kg per day in rats. Additional toxicology studies, including higher doses, will be needed to ascertain the complete pre-clinical picture for AN7973.
