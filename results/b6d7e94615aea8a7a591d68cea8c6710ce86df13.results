Effects of ASMq on the thymic, splenic, hepatic, and renal weights of the U27 tumor mice Compared to the normal control group, the thymic, splenic, and renal weights of the U27 tumor model mice are all lower (p < 0.05); the thymic, splenic, hepatic, and renal weights of the CTX group are all decreased (p < 0.05); the splenic, hepatic, and renal weights of the low-dose ASMq group are all dropped (p < 0.05). In contrast, the splenic and hepatic weights of the medium-dose ASMq group are increased (p < 0.05), while the renal weight is decreased (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the thymic and hepatic weights of the high-dose ASMq group are both elevated (p < 0.05). Compared to the U27 tumor model group, the weights of all of the major organs in the CTX group are decreased (p < 0.05), while the thymic, splenic, and hepatic weights of the ASMq group are increased (p < 0.05). Compared to the CTX group, the weights of all of the major organs in the ASMq group are elevated (p < 0.05), as shown in Table 2 . Effects of ASMq on the tumor inhibition rates and vital organ indexes of the U27 tumor mice The thymus, spleen, and liver indexes of the U27 tumor model group are lower than those of the normal control group (p < 0.05). In addition, the thymus, spleen, and liver indexes of the CTX group are decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The thymus, spleen, and kidney indexes of the low-dose ASMq group are also decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Likewise, the thymus, spleen, and kidney indexes of the medium-dose ASMq group are decreased (p < 0.05), while the thymus, spleen, and kidney indexes of the high-dose ASMq group are decreased significantly (p < 0.05). Compared to the U27 tumor model group, the thymus, spleen, and liver indexes of the CTX group are decreased significantly (p < 0.05), while the kidney indexes of the CTX group are increased (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the thymus, spleen, and kidney indexes of the low-and medium-dose ASMq groups as well as the spleen and kidney indexes of the high-dose ASMq group are decreased (p < 0.05). Compared to the CTX group, the thymus, spleen, and liver indexes of all ASMq groups are increased significantly (p < 0.05), while the kidney indexes of the ASMq groups are decreased (p < 0.05), as shown in Table 3 . The tumor inhibition rates of the CTX group and the ASMq.L group, ASMq.M group, and ASMq.H are approximately 72.21, 31.27, 60.53, and 51.94%, respectively. Compared to the U27 tumor model group, the tumor masses of the CTX group and all of the ASMq groups are decreased significantly (p < 0.05). In contrast, compared to the CTX group, the tumor masses of all of the ASMq groups increased (p < 0.05), as shown in Table 4 .
