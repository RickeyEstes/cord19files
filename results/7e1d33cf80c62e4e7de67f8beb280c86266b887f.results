Dynamic Contact Network. Degree distributions for the aggregated number of contacts at the pen level for the complete period of observation (192-h) were better characterized by a gamma distribution than a normal distribution, indicating that the degree distributions were skewed ( Supplementary Fig. 1) . A detailed description of the parameters and goodness of fit is provided in Table S1a . The degree distributions of hourly contact networks (during 2-3 am interval, shortened as 2 am thereafter; 8 am, 2 pm, and 8 pm hourly interval for pen #1) were better characterized by a normal distribution than a gamma distribution when the animals were more active (at 8 am, 2 pm, and 8 pm intervals), while the degree distribution fit better with a gamma distribution during 2 am, when the animals were inactive and the number of contacts was substantially lower than at other times of day and therefore the network was more sparse (Supplementary  Table 1 , Supplementary Fig. 2) . The time series of hourly number of contacts is shown in Fig. 1 for all three pens. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried to investigate temporal and individual variability. ANOVA results revealed highly significant hourly variability nested in day (P 5 0.003), individual variability nested in pen (P 5 0.001), and at pen level (P 5 0.003) but marginal insignificance between day variability (P 5 0.06). Further spectrum analysis confirmed a peak frequency correlated to an approximate 6.25-h period in number of contacts. Thus there was a clear pattern of diurnal cycle in network degree distribution. The quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) was applied to quantify pairwise contact network structure similarity for different contact rate intervals (see below). QAP could reveal changes in both network topology and roles in individual node. QAP results showed that the structure of the contact network was 90.33% similar between any two low-contact rate intervals (from 2 am to 5 am) on average, was 79.62% similar between any two high-contact rate intervals (at 8 am, 2 pm, and 8 pm intervals), and was only 46.67% similar between a low-and a high-contact rate interval. These results further showed that changes in the network structure (actual correlation between different nodes/calves) were not uniform during different hours in a day, besides the network degree distribution variability described above. An example of actual network structures is shown in Fig. 2 . The degree order was also highly variable throughout the observation period. The distribution of observed mean degree order of animals in each pen was very different from the hypothetical condition that the order of the network was consistent throughout the period (Fig. 3) . This was further supported by the two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test results showing that none of the observed distributions of mean rank in the three pens was similar to the hypothetical population with constant degree order (P 5 0.001 for all three pens, K-S test). Thus in the observed contact network, a calf active during a previous hour may became less active in successive periods, with no clear predictable pattern. Modeling Disease Transmission in a Dynamic Network. The time series of mean disease prevalence for all four conditions are presented in Fig. 4 . Characteristics of disease transmission such as maximum prevalence, its associated occurrence date, outbreak size (n), duration of outbreak (T f ), and basic reproduction number (R 0 ) are summarized in Table 1 . The maximum prevalence occurrence date, outbreak size, and the duration of outbreak did not differ substantially among the four conditions for parameter set 2 (higher R 0 ), whilst in parameter set 1 (lower R 0 ) these characteristics were more distinct. There were substantial differences in the maximum prevalence and the numerical R 0 . Of the four conditions in both parameter sets, R 0 was highest in C3 (with degree distribution change but no degree order change) and lowest in C2 (with degree order change but no distribution change), and it was consistent with other characteristics such as maximum prevalence, outbreak size, and duration of outbreak. In general, conditions with no degree order change (i.e. constant network degree order throughout time) had substantially higher maximum prevalence than those with degree order changes, for both parameter sets (set 1: C1 2 C2 5 4.89; C3 2 C4 5 4.82; set 2: C1 2 C2 5 10.47; C3 2 C4 5 3.12). This was expected because the individuals with consistently higher degree order would have more contacts through time, which caused a higher probability of infection. The conditions with temporal variability yielded higher maximum prevalence than no temporal variability counterparts for both The results demonstrated the statistically distinct disease dynamics of these four conditions. In general, the disease dynamics of C1 and C4 were more similar ( Fig. 4 and Table 1 ) than other pairs of conditions. We believe including temporal variability tended to increase disease prevalence, and incorporating degree order change tended to decrease transmission probability. These two factors acted in opposite directions and offset the effect of each other. Thus the final disease dynamics with both temporal and degree order change (C4) were similar to the condition with neither change (C1). The Gini coefficients of these four conditions are presented in Table 1 . In the first two conditions (C1 and C2, without temporal variability), the Gini coefficients were both very close to zero, indicating all individuals had almost equal contribution to the new infection, despite C1 having no degree order change and higher prevalence. In the latter two conditions (C3 and C4, with temporal variability), C3 had a larger Gini coefficient, indicating the individuals with constantly high degree order contributed to more new infections than the lower order ones.
