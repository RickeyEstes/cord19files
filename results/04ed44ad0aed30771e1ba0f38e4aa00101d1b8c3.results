Immunogenicity of 10-valent HRV vaccine in mice. We first used BALB/c mice to test immunogenicity. We propagated HRVs in H1-HeLa cells and inactivated infectivity using formalin. Sera from naive mice had no detectable nAb against HRV-16 ( Fig. 1) . Alum adjuvant enhanced the nAb response induced by i.m. inactivated HRV-16 ( Fig. 1 ). There was no effect of valency (comparing 1-, 3-, 5-, 7-and 10-valent) on the nAb response induced by inactivated HRV-16 or to the 3 types in the 3-valent vaccine (HRV-16, HRV-36 and HRV-78; Fig. 1 ). The 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) titres of the input viruses before inactivation (inactivated-TCID 50 ) are provided in Supplementary  Table 1 . Original antigenic sin can occur when sequential exposure to related virus variants results in biased immunity to the type encountered first 32 . In bivalent HRV-immune mice, we observed modest original antigenic sin following prime vaccination with 10-valent inactivated HRV, and boost vaccination partially alleviated the effect (Supplementary Fig. 1 ), similar to influenza virus 32 . Collectively, these results prompted us to explore more fully the nAb response to polyvalent HRV vaccine. Sufficient input HRV titre determines immunogenicity. In 1975, it was reported that two different 10-valent inactivated HRV preparations induced nAb titres to only 30-40% of the input virus types in recipient subjects 33 . However, the input titres of viruses before inactivation ranged from 10 1.5 to 10 5.5 TCID 50 per ml, and these were then diluted 10-fold to generate 10-valent 1.0 ml doses given i.m. as prime and boost with no adjuvant 33 . We hypothesized that low input antigen doses are responsible for poor nAb responses to 10-valent inactivated HRV. We reconstituted the 1975 10-valent vaccine, as closely as possible with available HRV types, over a 10 1 to 10 5 inactivated-TCID 50 per vaccine dose, and we compared it with a 10-valent vaccine of the same types with input titres ranging from410 5 to410 7 inactivated-TCID 50 per dose. The reconstituted 1975 vaccine resulted in no detectable nAb after prime vaccination and, following boost vaccination, nAb to the five types that had the highest input titres (Fig. 2) . The high titre vaccine resulted in nAb to 5 of 10 types after prime vaccination and all 10 types after the boost (Fig. 2) . Following the boost vaccinations, there appeared to be a 10 4 inactivated-TCID 50 per vaccine dose threshold for the induction of nAb in this model (Fig. 2b) . Above this titre, there was no correlation between input load and nAb induction. Immunogenicity of 25-valent HRV vaccine in mice. Injectable vaccines used in people are commonly given in a 0.5 ml dose. In our facility, the highest allowable i.m. vaccine volume in mice was 0.1 ml. We tested a 25-valent per 0.1 ml HRV vaccine in mice as a scalable prototype. The 25-valent inactivated HRV vaccine had a 7.4-fold lower average inactivated-TCID 50 per type per dose than the 10-valent composition (Supplementary Table 2) to accommodate the volume adjustment. The 10-valent inactivated HRV vaccine induced nAb to 100% of input types following the prime and the boost (Fig. 3a) . The nAb induced by 10-valent inactivated HRV were persisting at 203 days post-boost ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . We used two different sets of virus stocks for the prime and boost 25-valent vaccinations in these experiments (Supplementary Table 2 ). The reason is that in the interim between the prime and boost vaccinations, we obtained higher titre virus stocks of eleven of the input types (HRV-32, -49, -58, -55, -41, -33, -39, -50, -1B, -21 and -60). The higher titre stocks of these eleven were used in the boost vaccination. The 25-valent inactivated HRV prime vaccination induced nAb to 18 of 25 (72%) virus types, and the 25-valent boost resulted in nAb against 24 of the 25 types (96%; Fig. 3b ). The average nAb titre resulting from prime and boost was 2 7 for 10-valent and 2 6.8 for 25-valent. These data demonstrate broad neutralization of diverse HRV types with a straightforward vaccine approach. Table 3 ). The 25-valent vaccine induced nAb to 96% (RM A) and 100% (RM B) of input viruses following the prime vaccination (Fig. 4a) . The 50-valent vaccine induced nAb to 90% (RM C) and 82% (RM D) of input viruses following the prime vaccination (Fig. 4c) . The breadth of nAb following prime vaccination in RM was superior to what we observed in mice, which may have been due to animal species differences and/or higher inactivated-TCID 50 input titres in the RM vaccines. Following boost vaccination, there were serum nAb titres against 100% of the types in 25-valent HRV-vaccinated RMs (Fig. 4b) and 98% (49 out of 50) of the virus types in 50-valent HRV-vaccinated RMs (Fig. 4d) . The average nAb titre resulting from prime and boost in RMs was 2 9.3 for 25-valent and 2 8.6 for 50-valent. The nAb responses were type-specific, not cross-neutralizing, because there were minimal nAbs induced by the 25-valent vaccine against 10 non-vaccine types ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). The nAb response to 50-valent inactivated HRV vaccine was broad and potent in RMs. HRV yield in WI-38 cells and semi-purification by HPLC. The HRV stocks used in our vaccinations were produced in H1-HeLa cells, a good substrate for HRV replication but not suitable for vaccine manufacturing. We compared the infectious yield of 10 HRV types in H1-HeLa and WI-38, which can be qualified for vaccine production. Adequate yields were obtained from WI-38 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Injectable vaccines require defined purity. As proof of principle, we semi-purified three HRV types by high-performance liquid chromatography and found uncompromised immunogenicity of trivalent inactivated semi-purified HRV in mice ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ).
