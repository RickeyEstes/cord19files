Nucleotides -119 to -1 region are responsible for the murine IRF-3 promoter activity. To determine the specific promoter region responsible for murine IRF-3 induction, we generated a series of plasmids that included various sizes of the 59-flanking region of the murine IRF-3 gene fused to the luciferase gene and transfected them into N2a and 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 1 , a plasmid containing nt -1000 to -1 relative to the transcription start site (pGL3 -1000/-1) showed approximately 33-fold (in N2a cells) and 6-fold (in 3T3 cells) activity compared with the control (pGL3 Basic), while plasmids containing nt -2000 to -1001 (pGL3 -2000/-1001) and nt -1000 to -524 (pGL3 -1000/-524) completely lost their responsiveness. Plasmids containing nt -523 to -1 (pGL3 -523/-1), nt -340 to -1 (pGL3 -340/-1) and nt -119 to -1 (pGL3 -119/-1) maintained similar levels of their promoter activity with the full-length promoter (pGL3 -1000/-1), suggesting that nt -119 to -1 was responsible for the promoter activity. IRF-3 promoter activity is reduced in prion-infected cells. To examine the relationship between the IRF-3 promoter activity and prion infection, we analyzed N2a58 and ScN2a58 (N2a58 cells persistently infected with 22L prion) cells. As shown in Fig. 2a , mRNA of IRF-3 had a significant reduction in ScN2a58 cells. Reduction of the promoter activity was confirmed in ScN2a58 cells which was transiently transfected with pGL3 -119/-1 (Fig. 2b) . Furthermore, in the persistently other prion strain-infected cells by the mouse-adapted Gerstmann-Str√§ussler-Schenker syndrome (GSS) Fukuoka-1 strain (FK-N2a58), IRF-3 mRNA and the promoter activity were also significantly decreased (Supplementary Fig. S6a and S6b). Next, we challenged with 0.1% brain homogenates from 22Linfected mice (22LBH) or normal mice (nBH) to N2a58 cells and incubated for 48 h. As expected, the promoter activity in 22LBHincubated cells was significantly decreased ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), indicating that prion infection reduced the activity. Furthermore, drug treatment was started after the initial seeding of the cells (at 75 cm 2 flask) and renewed every passage. The significantly reduced promoter activity in ScN2a58 cells increased after continuous treatment with Congo red (CR, 10 mM) or pentosan polysulfate (PPS, 20 mg/ml), which are both known as anti-prion drugs 12 (Fig. 2c ; CR: 3.8-fold and PPS: 3.4-fold). The efficacy of the two drugs was evaluated by detection of PK-resistant PrP using western blotting in cells after final passage (Fig. 2d) . The activities of the uninfected control N2a58 cells were not affected during continuous treatment ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Oct-1 is responsible for IRF-3 promoter activity. We identified putative transcription factor binding sites in nt -119 to -1 with the software TFSEARCH ver.1.3 (http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/ TFSEARCH.html) and found that this region contains a potential Oct-1 binding site (59-ATTTGCAT-39, nt -42 to -35) and an acute myeloid leukemia 1 protein (AML1) binding site (59-TGCGGT-39, nt -49 to -44). In addition, an E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) binding site (59-TTTCCCAC-39, nt -116 to -109) was also conserved in murine (Fig. 3a) . To determine whether the Oct-1 site is important for promoter activity, an original and two different mutated plasmids from the Oct-1 site (M1 and M2) were prepared (Fig. 3b ) and the transiently transfected into N2a and 3T3 cells. After 24 h, we evaluated their respective promoter activity by reporter assay. The activities of pGL3 -119/-1 (M1) were also significantly reduced compared with the original promoter activities in N2a and 3T3 cells ( Fig. 3c and 3d ). The activities of pGL3 -1000/-1 (M1) and pGL3 -523/-1 (M1) were also significantly reduced ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). We obtained similar results in the second mutated plasmid pGL3 -119/-1 (M2) where activity was also significantly reduced in N2a and 3T3 cells ( Fig. 3e and 3f) . These results indicate that the Oct-1 site might play a crucial role for murine IRF-3 promoter activity. We next determined whether the E2F1 site was important for the promoter activity. The original plasmid pGL3 -119/-1 and the E2F1 site mutated plasmid (M3: Fig. 3g ) were transiently transfected into N2a and 3T3 cells. After 24 h, we evaluated their respective promoter activity by reporter assay. The activities of pGL3 -119/-1 (M3) were not significantly different compared to the original plasmid promoter activity in N2a and 3T3 cells ( Fig. 3h and 3i) , indicating the E2F1 is not an important determining factor for the regulation of murine IRF-3 promoter. Since two different mutations in the AML1 site (M4 and M5: shown in Supplementary Fig. S4a ) had little effect on the promoter activity in N2a58 cells (N2a cells overexpress wild-type prion protein), indicating the AML1 is not also important ( Supplementary  Fig. S4b ). To confirm that Oct-1 binds to the endogenous murine IRF-3 promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed. PCR analysis revealed that the Oct-1 antibody precipitated the promoter region (nt -119 to -1) from N2a58 cells (Fig. 4a) , while the negative control (anti-rabbit IgG) did not exhibit the DNA binding activity. These data suggest that endogenous Oct-1 binds to the promoter region in vivo. Furthermore, to investigate whether the promoter activity is affected by Oct-1, pcDNA Oct-1-HA and pGL3 -119/-1 were co-transfected into N2a cells. Ectopically Oct-1 overexpression significantly increased the original promoter activities (pGL3 -119/-1 1 mock vs pGL3 -119/-1 1 pcDNA Oct-1-HA), while Oct-1 expression had no effect on the mutated promoter activities [pGL3 -119/-1 (M1) 1 mock vs pGL3 -119/-1 (M1) 1 pcDNA Oct-1-HA], indicating exogenous Oct-1 functions in the promoter region (Fig. 4b) . We next examined the expression levels of Oct-1 proteins in prion-infected cells. As shown in Fig. 5a , Oct-1 expression in ScN2a58 cells was significantly decreased compared with that in N2a58 cells. Similarly, we also analyzed the expression levels of Oct-1 proteins in prion-infected mice brains. We intracerebrally inoculated 22L or FK-1 prion strains into ddY mice and analyzed the levels of Oct-1 protein in their brains after becoming terminal, respectively. Of note, the levels of Oct-1 protein in the two distinct prion strains-infected mouse brains significantly decreased, suggesting that prion infection might repress endogenous Oct-1 expression ( Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. S6c ). These results demonstrate that reduced IRF-3 promoter activity in prion-infected cells is accompanied by decreased levels of Oct-1.
