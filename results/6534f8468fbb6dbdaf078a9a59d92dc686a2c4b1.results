Assay design. To develop a cell-based, isoform-specific EPAC activation assay, HEK293 cell lines stably expressing Flag-tagged Rap1A and full-length EPAC1 or EPAC2 are proposed. HEK293 cells express minimal endogenous levels of EPAC1 and EPAC2 and have been used as host cells for evaluating the cellular activities of ectopically expressed EPAC proteins in an isoform-specific manner 28 . Activation of EPAC1 or EPAC2 in these cell lines by cAMP elevating agents leads to the accumulation of Flag-Rap1-GTP, which can be captured by RalGDS-RBD immobilized in a nickel-coated 96-well microplate. The levels of active Flag-Rap1-GTP protein can be quantitatively monitored using a specific anti-FLAG antibody and a HRP conjugated secondary antibody in a manner similar to that of a conventional ELISA assay (Fig. 1 ).
