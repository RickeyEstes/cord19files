No significant difference in bacterial diversity or community composition (R 2 = 0.01, P = 0.36) was observed between paired blind and non-blind brushes, showing that blind brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota. This has important implications for collecting lower respiratory samples from healthy children. A significant decrease in bacterial diversity (P < 0.001) and change in community composition (R 2 = 0.08, P = 0.004) was observed among controls, in comparison with patients. Bacterial communities within patients with PBB were dominated by Proteobacteria, and indicator species analysis showed that Haemophilus and Neisseria were significantly associated with the patient group. In 15 (52.9%) cases the dominant organism by sequencing was not identified by standard routine clinical culture. Twenty four children with PBB and 20 healthy controls were successfully recruited into the study (Table 1) . Nasal and throat swabs were obtained from mothers for 16 of the children; 11 of the PBB children and 5 of the healthy child controls.
