The dbSNP database contains both validated and nonvalidated polymorphisms. In spite of this drawback, dbSNP was availed because it is the most extensive SNP database (Sherry et al. 2001; Bhagwat 2010) . MBL2 gene contains 661 SNPs in dbSNP database. Out of these 661 SNPs, only 37 validated SNPs having MAF ≥ 0.10 were considered for the present study. Those SNPs which either have MAF < 0.10 or are not validated were excluded for further analysis. These 37 SNPs includes one 3′ near gene, nine 3′ UTR, thirteen intronic SNPs, thirteen 5′ near gene and one synonymous SNP (sSNP). One sSNP was excluded from the study leaving 36. However no non-synonymous SNPs were found to have MAF even ≥0.05. So, SNPs falling in the list of pathogenic significance were also checked for validation status and MAF ≥ 0.1. Only one SNP Gly54Asp (rs1800450) have MAF = 0.1220 was found and hence included in the study. Thus, our investigation accounted for 37 SNPs including 3′ UTR, intronic, 5′/3′ near gene and nsSNP. A map of the MBL2 gene region highlighting the positions of each of these SNPs is shown in Fig. 2 . A list of 37 SNPs was submitted to the FuncPred program and results obtained are shown in Table 1 . Total 24 SNPs were predicted to have effect on function, of which nine 3′ UTR SNPs were found to affect miRNA binding site and three intronic and twelve 5′ SNPs were found to be affecting transcription binding site. RegulomeDB database has divided 37 SNPs included in the present study into six broad categories (Category 1 to Category 6)-where twenty nine SNPs had annotation scores in between 1 and 6 (Table 2) and the remaining eight SNPs had no data annotation (not shown in table). Of the 29 SNPs, only one SNP had RegulomeDB score of 1f three SNPs were less likely to be functional (Category 3a) while, 25 SNPs had minimum functional evidence (Category 4, 5 and 6). The top ranked SNP rs7096206 had annotation for eQTL + TF binding/DNase peak and thus very likely to have regulatory functions. In sequence alignment, except 6 species including F. catus, C. lupus familiaris, C. jacchus, M. musculus, O. cuniculus and R. norvegicus, all were found to show alignment with the human MBL2 gene. Furthermore, all the 37 SNPs involved in present study were found to lie in conserved region, hence are called conserved SNPs (cSNPs) (Fig. 3) . 3′ UTR SNPs submitted online to PolymiRTS server showed four variants affecting miRNA target sites, hence proposed to have obvious consequences on protein truncation (Table 3) . These four SNPs were also predicted by FuncPred for miRNA binding. The 3′ UTR SNPs identified as having putative functional effects, by the four tools were then screened as shown in Table 4 . Two SNPs predicted by all the tools and two SNPs i.e. rs2099903, rs2165813, not predicted by regulomeDB but by other 3 tools, were selected for further analysis because prediction by polymiRTS cannot be ignored. Similarly, intronic and 5′ near gene SNPs identified as having putative functional effects, by the three tools were screened as shown in Table 5 . From the SNPs identified by all the three tools only 7 SNPs which were reported and have regulomeDB score ≤5 were selected and those which either were not reported (rs17334270, 13312736) or have regulomeDB score ≥6 (rs10824794, rs1031101, rs1982266) were not selected. Thus overall total 11 noncoding SNPs form 3′ UTR and 5′ near region of MBL2 gene were filtered through a plethora of SNPs and identified as causal variants. Predictions of deleterious effect of rs1800450 (nsSNP) was performed by SIFT and Polyphen-2 softwares. It was predicted to be damaging by both the servers. The SIFT prediction was deleterious with a score of 0.006. This deleterious nsSNP was submitted to Polyphen-2 as query protein sequences in FASTA format with prediction outcomes to be probably damaging score closer to 1. By using Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB), the MBL2 gene related protein structures were searched. Although different mutations in MBL2 gene are reported, the native primary structure (with complete 248 amino acid sequence) of MBL monomeric protein is not yet available. Only partial protein structure, with PDB ID 1HUP was found (Sheriff et al. 1994) . This partial structure of MBL2 is a 148-residue peptide, stretches from 107 to 248 aa residues consisting of the 'neck' and carbohydrate recognition domains forming trimers in solution and in crystals. MUSTER provided highest score for the same template (PDB ID 1HUP) with Z score 13.966 and alignment length 141 aa residues with coverage of 0.568. However, the rs1800450 nsSNP lies in collagenous domain of human MBL protein (Super et al. 1989; Summerfield et al. 1997; Wallis and Cheng 1999; Wallis 2002; Turner 2003; Larsen et al. 2004 ). Hence, protein modelling based on its structural information was necessary for absolute understanding of its functionality. I-TASSER was chosen to predict MBL monomeric protein secondary structure. Five models were obtained as an output, of these first model with highest C score of −2.80, TM score of 0.39 ± 0.13 and estimated RMSD 12.4 ± 4.3 Å was considered for the analysis of highly damaging nsSNPs on the structure and function of protein. The Ramachandran  plot was also assessed to support quality of predicted MBL model using RAMPAGE server (Fig. 4) . The model showed good proportions of residues in favored (72.4 %), allowed (19.9 %) and outlier regions (7.7 %). The results indicated that the 3D model was of fair quality. I-TASSER also predicted that native Gly residue with score of 3 as buried residue and variant Asp residue with score of 7 as highly exposed in terms of solvent accessibility. To get variant modeled structure at position 54 i.e. Gly → Asp conversion Swiss-PdbViewer and chimera was used (Fig. 5) . This variation leads to slight deviation in various parameters including total energy after minimization, total electrostatic constraint, total bond energy, torsion and non-bonded energy (Table 6 ). It was found that Gly → Asp conversion at position 54 showed a network of clashes with nearby residues that is Asp at position 53 and Gly at position 48 as shown in Fig. 6 while this network is lacking when native residue glycine was there. Furthermore, analysis by I-mutant indicated that Gly → Asp conversion at position 54 decreases the stability of protein with DDG value of −1.37 kcal/mol.
