Of 507 participants from the community enrolled into a cohort, 99 reported having ARI episodes. We also enrolled 142 inpatients from Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), and retrieved 128 influenza cases from a previous study (historical-FLU). Community participants with ARI episodes did not differ significantly from the underlying cohort (Table 1) . Compared to community participants with ARI, inpatients were older, more likely to be male and to have chronic medical conditions. Similarly, historical-FLU participants with medical indications were older, and more likely to have chronic medical conditions as compared to those who were admitted for public health indications. Historical-FLU participants with medical indications were fairly similar to the inpatients although they were slightly younger and less likely to have COPD and heart disease. One hundred and thirty episodes were reported from 99 community participants (community-ARI) with 76, 16, 6 and 1 individuals reporting 1, 2, 3 and 4 episodes respectively. For the inpatients, there were 145 episodes with only 1 individual having 2 and another having 3 episodes (inpatient-ARI). Viruses detected by SRT-PCR and MRT-PCR in Community-ARI and Inpatient-ARI episodes. On using SRT-PCR with MRT-PCR, 53.8% of the community-ARI episodes were diagnosed as panel virus positive (i.e. positive for at least one of the viruses on the MRT-PCR panel used), including 10 (7.7%) influenza virus positive episodes (8A(H3N2), 1A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1 influenza B) and 60 (46.2%) non-influenza panel virus positive episodes. Two viruses were more common than influenza in community-ARI, with 37 (28.5%) episodes positive for rhinoviruses and 13 (10.0%) for coronaviruses (Table 2 ). There were no co-infections detected by MRT-PCR in either community-ARI episodes or influenza negative inpatient-ARI. However, 5 influenza positive inpatient-ARI episodes were positive for more than one pathogen, including 4 dual-pathogen (influenza A + influenza B [2] , influenza A + rhinovirus, and influenza B + respiratory syncytial virus)
