As of July 14, 2015, 185 confirmed cases of MERS (mean age 54.6 years, male to female ratio 1.6:1) have been reported in South Korea (excluding one diagnosed in China). Secondary cases were classified as first-generation infections if there was a history of direct contact with the index patient (through visiting or the provision of care), or exposure in the same healthcare environment where the index patient was clinically managed. Similarly, secondgeneration infections refer to those with exposure to firstgeneration patients. Of the 86 healthcare institutions that have taken in MERS-CoVinfected patients, local transmission has occurred in 13 (plus an ambulance), as shown in Figure 1 . A majority of the transmitted infections have been reported from two hospitals, accounting for 19.5% (n = 36) and 48.4% (n = 89) of all cases. Of note, 99 patients could not give a definitive history of direct contact with any infected persons, but had been staying in the same clinical environment with known case(s). Three generations of secondary infection could be delineated over time: first-generation (n = 26), second-generation (n = 120), and third-generation (n = 22); eight patients could not be classified. Three overlapping waves of transmission could be seen on the epidemic curve ( Figure 2 ). Mapping highlighted a number of characteristics of the outbreak. Firstly, infection within households was distinctly uncommon, accounting for only one first-generation case (wife of the index patient). Hospital infection was found to be the most important cause of the outbreak, but affected largely nonhealthcare workers (154/184 from the collected data); there has been no reported community spread. Secondly, the transmissions appear to have been multifocal as a result of infected patients attending more than one institution during the course of their illness. Two cases, including the index case, were reported to have visited four healthcare institutions, while three had visited three. This can be explained by the phenomenon of healthcare switching, a practice that is common in South Korea, where many adult patients may use hospital performance information to choose the service providers. 5, 6 This practice, coupled with the courtesy of visiting relatives in hospitals, appears to have fuelled the rapid dissemination of the virus. Thirdly, while MERS-CoV is known to spread by droplet transmission upon prolonged exposure to and within a short distance of source patients, direct contact could only be inferred in about 10% of the cases. It was found that the majority occurred instead in people who had shared the same healthcare environment. Fomite transmission is a possibility, as MERS-CoV has been shown to remain viable on inanimate surfaces, even after an extended interval of 48 h. 7 Similarly SARS-CoV RNA has been collected from hospital surfaces days after their deposition by infected patients, although the viability of this virus could not be confirmed. 8 Fomite transmission was the probable explanation for the transmission of SARS-CoV to passengers not in physical proximity to the source patient on an aircraft, 9 an observation that
