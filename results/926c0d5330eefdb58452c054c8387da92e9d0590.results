Clinical signs. Mild clinical signs were seen in cat 1 and cat 3 during the first week after inoculation. They consisted of diminished appetite and moderate weight loss, to 95.4 and 88.4% of the initial weight for cat 1 and 3, respectively. Cat 1 also showed an increased body temperature at 4 (39.5 °C) and 6 (39.7 °C) dpi. No diarrhoea or changes in faecal consistency were observed. From day 9, both cats started to recover and reached their original (or slightly higher) weight at 21 dpi. Cat 2 showed no loss of appetite, weight loss or abnormal stool consistency during the entire experiment, but a slightly raised temperature (39.3 °C) was found at 7 dpi (Fig. 1 ). Viral shedding. Faecal shedding was quantified by 2 different RT-qPCRs and by virus titration in feline enterocyte cultures. These 2 RT-qPCRs were used to assess the overestimation of genomic RNA by the generally used 3′ RT-qPCR 23 , as this RT-qPCR detects not only genomic RNA, but also all subgenomic mRNAs. As shown in Fig. 2 , two different excretion patterns were detected. Cat 1 and cat 3 started shedding viral RNA from day 2-4 onwards. For these 2 cats, faecal shedding peaked at 5 dpi, whereupon shedding slightly decreased but remained at high levels until 28 dpi, and even a second small peak was seen at 28 and 21 dpi for cat 1 and 3, respectively. Thereafter, viral RNA levels dropped and both cats had ceased shedding by 84 dpi. Viral RNA quantities were 3-4.3 log 10 higher with the 3′ RT-qPCR compared to the 5′ RT-qPCR, indicating that only 1/1000 to 1/20000 of all copies detected with the 3′ RT-qPCR are viral genomic RNA copies. Infectivity titration of faecal suspensions in feline enterocyte cultures showed that infectious virus was detectable from day 4 until day 21 (cat 1) or day 28 (cat 3), but that infectious virus titres declined more rapidly than the RT-qPCR titres. In contrast to cat 1 and 3, an aberrant shedding pattern was found in cat 2. At day 2, viral RNA was detected with the 3′ RT-qPCR, but not with the 5′ RT-qPCR. Thereafter, viral RNA was undetectable until 14 dpi. From then, faecal RNA shedding appeared and remained high during the remainder of the experiment, and this cat ultimately stopped shedding 6 months after inoculation (data not shown). Remarkably, no virus replication was observed at any of the time points when faecal samples were inoculated on intestinal epithelial cell cultures. Rectal temperature was monitored daily during the first week, and on day 9, 14, 21, 28, 56, and 84 pi. (B) Body weight was measured at day 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 21, 28, 56 , and 84, and expressed relative to the weight before inoculation. RNA levels in saliva were the highest in all cats directly after inoculation. Subsequently, the days at which the samples were positive varied considerably between cats, and positive samples always contained very low amounts of RNA (data not shown). Immunological parameters. Neutralising antibodies. For cat 1 and 3, neutralising antibodies were detected from 9 dpi and peaked at 21 (cat 3) or 28 (cat 1) dpi. In cat 2 with the delayed shedding pattern, similar signs of seroconversion occurred only after the onset of intestinal replication, with the first detectable antibodies appearing at 21 dpi. In all cats, antibody titres remained high until the end of the experiment (Fig. 2) . Dynamics of leukocyte subsets. For all cats, the absolute number of T cells, B cells, monocytes, and granulocytes were determined in blood taken at regular time points after inoculation. No abnormal leukocyte numbers were noticed in any of the cats, except for a depletion of peripheral granulocytes in cat 1 during the first 3 weeks pi. For each cat, T and B cell numbers followed a similar trend. All cats showed a small decrease in lymphocyte numbers, which started to resolve from 21 dpi, but this recovery phase was much more pronounced in cat 1 and 3 compared to cat 2. Indeed, whereas lymphocyte numbers remained at pre-infection levels for cat 2, both cat 1 and 3 showed a slight lymphocytosis, which coincided with cessation of shedding in both cats. Monocytes of cat 1 and 2 slightly declined to rise back to pre-infection levels at 28 dpi, but numbers always remained within the normal limits (Fig. 3) . Quantification of natural killer (NK) and regulatory T cells (Tregs) showed no abnormal high or low NK cellor Treg numbers during the infection. However, some trends were visible. In all cats, NK cells slowly declined until 14 or 21 dpi, whereupon they rose again to pre-infection level at 56 dpi. Treg counts similarly declined and rose in all cats. When analysing a subset of Tregs (CD8 + Tregs), which has been associated with suppression of gut immune responses, it was noticed that the delayed shedder had higher numbers of CD8 + Tregs, which increased until 7 dpi, whereas the number of CD8 + Tregs was slightly decreased during the first week for the other 2 cats (Fig. 4) . Viraemia. Both cell-free and cell-associated viraemia were assessed at regular time points for all cats, using the 5′ RT-qPCR. No cell-free viraemia was detected, but a cell-associated viraemia was observed at infrequent time points for all cats. In contrast to cat 1 and 3, viraemia in cat 2 was detected before the onset of faecal shedding (3 and 5 dpi), and no longer thereafter ( Table 1) . Analysis of viral genome evolution in faeces. As mentioned above, several inconsistencies between the results for the faecal RNA shedding and the infectivity titration in enterocyte cultures were observed, including a total lack of infectivity for cat 2 during the entire study, and a reduction in in vitro enterocyte tropism for cat 1 and 3 from 14-21 dpi onwards. To find an explanation for this discrepancy, the complete genomes of the faecally shed viruses were determined at different time points. Table 2 shows the nucleotide and amino acid differences between the inoculum and the viruses found at an early shedding stage (day 7, 21, and 9 for cat 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Although inoculated with the same strain, every cat developed its own quasispecies very rapidly. The most striking difference was found in the viruses shed by cat 2, since 83.8% of all reads showed a 101 bp deletion in the 7b gene, resulting in the formation of a truncated 7b protein with only 143 amino acids instead of 206. Surprisingly, this deletion was no longer found at a later time point (84 dpi) ( Table 3 ), suggesting that viruses with an intact 7b protein were in time selected over the mutants containing the deletion. Other amino acid substitutions were found for this cat in nsp2, nsp5, and nsp6. In cat 1, no amino acid substitutions had occurred by 7 dpi, whereas for cat 3, single amino acid substitutions were found in a minority of the viruses in nsp6, nsp9, nsp12, and the spike protein at 9 dpi. In contrast to the early shedding, viruses shed by all cats at the end of the infection had undergone numerous changes in the viral genome, with the spike protein being the most affected in all cats ( Table 3) . Most of the mutations in the spike protein occurred in the globular S1 domain. These changes included deletions (cat 1 and 3) Faeces (or faecal swabs if faeces were not available) were taken at regular time points pi, and the total amount of viral RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR using either primers targeting the 3′ part of the genome and subgenomic mRNAs (3′ RT-qPCR, black dashed line) or primers against the ORF1b to detect only genomic RNA (5′ RT-qPCR, black line). The amount of infectious virus was determined by titration of faecal suspensions in feline enterocyte cultures (orange dashed line). Neutralising antibody titres were assessed in the serum on day 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 21, 28, 56 , and 84 pi by virus neutralisation assay in enterocytes using FECV UCD (blue line). and various amino acid substitutions with possibly a high impact on the charge, polarity and/or glycosylation potential. Amino acid 33 was a hotspot for mutation, since the proline residue had changed to serine in cat 1 (thereby adding a potential N-glycosylation site as predicted by the NetNGlyc server) and leucine in cat 2. In cat 3, 90% of all viruses had a deletion of 8 amino acids in this region, whereas the other 10% showed the proline to serine substitution. All other changes in the S1 region of the spike protein differed between the cats, except for the amino acid substitution K665N that occurred in both cat 1 and 2. In contrast to the S1 domain, the S2 domain of the spike was less affected by mutations, as only one amino acid change had occurred in cat 2 and cat 3. One of these mutations (T1107I in cat 2) occurred in the heptad repeat 1 (HR1), a region that was recently shown to be affected by mutations in many FIP cats 24, 25 . If one or more of these mutations in the spike protein can be linked to the reduced in vitro enterocyte tropism requires further investigation. Apart from the spike protein, mutations were also found in other proteins, which again differed between cats. All these results indicate that there is a strong selection pressure during FECV infections, which forces the virus to rapidly evolve, hence resulting in the onset of virus quasispecies that differ among cats.
