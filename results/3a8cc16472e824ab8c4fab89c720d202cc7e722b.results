During 1993 to 1997 (early cohort), 102 chart-verified lung biopsies were performed on 1418 first allogeneic HCT recipients at FHCRC, of which 66 biopsies occurred post-HCT and comprised 54 surgical lung biopsies and 12 FNA among 56 patients. Table 2) . The overall surgical lung biopsy incidence within the first year after HCT was .15 and .075 per 1000 patient days, respectively, in the early and late cohorts. Patients in the late cohort were 50% less likely to undergo a lung biopsy (unadjusted hazard ratio, .51; 95% confidence interval, .31 to .82; P = .006; adjusted hazard ratio, .50, 95% confidence interval, 29 to .83; P = .008) when compared with patients in the early cohort. The median time to biopsy post-HCT was 71.5 days (interquartile range, 31
