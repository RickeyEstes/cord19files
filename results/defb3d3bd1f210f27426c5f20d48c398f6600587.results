Based on modeling studies, our goal was to identify a latent class model that minimized Bayesian Information Criterion values and yielded an interpretable solution with administratively manageable sample sizes. 51 A two-class model yielded the lowest Bayesian Information Criterion, the lowest Consistent Akaike Information Criterion, and the highest (Table 3 ). Both segments preferred that patients and staff double check patient's identity and medication accuracy. Consistent with HYP 2, an initiative encouraging patients to clean their hands was more important than asking patients to remind staff to clean their hands. Both segments preferred signs (versus staff or volunteers) reminding patients to wash their hands and to ask staff if they had washed their hands (Table 3) . communicating risk and safety information to patients Disclosure of risks exerted an important influence on choices ( Table 2 ). Both segments preferred that all patients were informed of risks and that staff encourage patients to ask about safety (Table 3) .
