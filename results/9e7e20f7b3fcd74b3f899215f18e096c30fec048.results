Influenza-specific plasmablasts are persistently induced throughout infection, providing a rich source of antiviral mAbs B cell responses were examined in nine patients infected with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza virus. These patients had varying courses and severity of disease. The cases ranged from mild disease with rapid viral clearance within a few days after onset of symptoms to severe cases that shed virus for several weeks and required hospitalization with ventilator support. A majority of the patients were treated with antiviral drugs. The diagnoses were confirmed by pandemic H1N1-specific RT-PCR and serology. All patients had neutralizing titers of serum antibodies at the time of blood collection. A summary of the clinical patient data are shown in Table I . The majority of samples were obtained around 10 d after the onset of symptoms, with the exception of a particularly severe case where sampling was done 31 d after symptom onset. Antigen-specific plasmablasts appear transiently in peripheral blood after vaccination with influenza or other vaccines (Brokstad et al., 1995; Bernasconi et al., 2002; Sasaki et al., 2007; Wrammert et al., 2008) , but the kinetics of their appearance and persistence during an ongoing infection remain unclear. Here, we have analyzed the magnitude and specificity of the plasmablast response in blood samples taken within weeks after onset of clinical symptoms of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus infection. Using a virus-specific ELISPOT assay, it was possible to show a significant number of pandemic H1N1-reactive plasmablasts in the blood of the infected patients, whereas none were detectable in a cohort of healthy volunteers (Fig. 1, A and B ). These cells were also readily detectable several weeks after symptom onset in the more severe cases. Fig. 1 (A and C) illustrates that, of the total IgG-secreting cells, over half of the cells were producing antibodies that bound pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Moreover, plasmablasts specific for HA occurred at 30-50% the frequency of virus-specific cells (Fig. 1, C and D) , the specificity most likely to be critical for protection. Most patients also had a relatively high frequency of plasmablasts, forming antibodies that bound to past, seasonal influenza strains ( Fig. 1 C) or recombinant HA from the previous annual H1N1 strain, A/Brisbane/59/2007. Based on the overall frequency of pandemic H1N1-specific cells, it is likely that the cells binding other strains were overlapping populations and cross-reactive. None of the induced plasmablast cells bound to recombinant HA from the H3N2 strain from the same vaccine (A/Brisbane/10/2007). These findings demonstrate that influenza-specific human plasmablasts are continuously generated throughout an ongoing infection and that a fairly high proportion of these cells make antibodies that also cross-react with previous annual H1N1 influenza strains. To analyze the specificity, breadth, and neutralizing capacity of these plasmablasts, we used single-cell PCR to amplify the heavy and light chain variable region genes from individually Hancock et al., 2009) . The Centers for Disease Control reports that there were an estimated 60 million cases of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain, which caused ÓÅ∫256,000 hospitalizations. An unusually high frequency of severe disease occurred in younger and otherwise healthy patients (Hancock et al., 2009 ). In addition, rare infections with avian H5N1 influenza strains in humans had close to a 50% mortality rate (Subbarao and Joseph, 2007) . Emergence of a zoonotic or antigenically distinct strain that combined even a fraction of the morbidity and mortality of the pandemic H1N1 and H5N1 viruses would have dire consequences. Antibodies play a key role in protection against influenza infection in vivo (Puck et al., 1980; Gerhard et al., 1997; Luke et al., 2006; Simmons et al., 2007) . The fact that there were little or no preexisting antibody titers present before the emergence of this pandemic virus, and that the virus atypically caused such severe disease in young adult, illustrates the importance of comprehensively understanding the B cell responses and antibody specificities induced by infection with this influenza virus. Here, we have analyzed the plasmablast responses induced by pandemic H1N1 infection and generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from these cells to analyze their characteristics in detail. In contrast to seasonal vaccination, we show that a majority of the neutralizing antibodies induced by infection were broadly cross-reactive with all recent annual H1N1 strains, as well as the highly pathogenic 1918 H1N1 and avian H5N1 strains. These neutralizing antibodies bound predominantly to conserved epitopes in the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk region (Ekiert et al., 2009; Sui et al., 2009) , with some binding to novel epitopes in the HA globular head. The high frequency of these HA-stalk binding antibodies is of particular interest, as this epitope is a promising target for a broadly protective influenza vaccine (Steel et al., 2010) . Furthermore, the cross-reactive antibodies carried highly mutated immunoglobulin genes, indicative of extensive affinity maturation. Together, these findings support a model in which infection predominantly activated broadly cross-reactive memory B cells that then underwent further affinity maturation. We propose that the expansion of these rare types of memory B cells may explain why most people did not become severely ill, even in the absence of preexisting protective antibody titers. Recent studies in mice strongly support the idea that consecutive immunizations with antigens from divergent influenza stains can indeed hone the antibody response to preferentially target broadly protective conserved epitopes Wei et al., 2010) . Our findings demonstrate that cross-reactive antibodies can be preferentially induced in humans given the right immunogen, providing further support for the feasibility of generating a pan-influenza vaccine. Finally, in vivo challenge experiments showed that the neutralizing antibodies isolated protected mice challenged with a lethal dose of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, even when administered therapeutically 72 h after infection, and also provided protection against antigenically distinct H1N1 influenza strains. These antibodies are thus promising as therapeutics against pandemic H1N1, as well as activated by pandemic H1N1 infection. Consistent with the frequency of plasmablasts secreting antibodies binding annual influenza strains by ELISPOT analyses (Fig. 1 C) , a majority (29/46, or 63%) of the pandemic H1N1-specific antibodies also cross-reacted with seasonal influenza viruses (Fig. 2,  A and B ). In fact, by ELISA, one third of these antibodies bind to the prepandemic strains at lower concentrations than they did to the pandemic H1N1 strain, suggesting higher avidity binding. By comparison, only 22% (11/50) of plasmablasts induced by annual H1N1 strains before the pandemic could bind the pandemic H1N1 influenza (Fig. S1 B) . We propose that the cross-reactivity of pandemic H1N1-induced cells derives from the activation of memory cells originally specific for past influenza immunizations in an original antigenic sin fashion.
