We similarly estimated the mean time from onset-to-recovery using data on outcomes in 169 cases reported outside mainland China. We obtain a slightly longer duration for the onset-to-recovery distribution of 22.6 days (95% crI 21.1-24.4 days) and CV of 0.33 days (95% crI 0.30-0.37 days) ( Figure  2 ). .
