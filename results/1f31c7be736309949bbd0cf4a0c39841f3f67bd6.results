All PRRSv ORF5 sequences (n = 3,582) were field isolates obtained from different type of farms from one swine production system, including farrow to wean, farrow to feeder, and growing pig farms. The complete ORF5 nucleotide sequences were collected between 1 st January 1998 and 21 st April 2016 from PRRSv-infected swine farms located in the Midwest region of the U.S. Here, we defined the Midwest region to include Minnesota, Iowa, South Dakota and Nebraska. Sequencing was performed in Midwest-based veterinary diagnostic laboratories or private laboratories on a fee-for-service basis and according to the procedures in use at the time of virus detection. The information contained in the dataset obtained from the system included RFLP genotype classification, geographical location (latitude/longitude) of the farm from which the virus was isolated, and date of sequencing. The data were shared under a strict confidentiality agreement, in which identity of the production system and location of the participant farms cannot be revealed. Therefore, we generated and plotted a kernel density function of 5 km 2 spatial resolution to represent the locations of infected farms (Fig. 1A) using ArcGIS version 10.4 41 . Sequence dataset used here is currently under preparation to be deposited in the Genbank and will be available soon to the readers with accessions xx-yy. Furthermore, full alignment of sequences has been provided on a FASTA file with the supplementary materials (File S1). We used presence-only maximum entropy, an SDM technique (Maxent) 42 to predict the geographical range of PRRSv high-risk areas in the Midwest region. Geographical locations of all sequences and a set of selected environmental predictors (Table S1) were used for the subsequent Maxent analyses. Furthermore, we used Bayesian Phylodynamic methods implemented in the BEAST 43 software package to model the demographic and phylogeographic history of 3 selected viral clades, from the sequences described above. We decided to select three clades as cases studies, because analyzing 3,582 sequences at one run using complex and advanced phylodynamic methods is computationally demanding and time consuming, which was neither feasible for us nor the swine producers. The selected three clades were genetically distinct, in which two of them were dominated by strains known as endemic (based on the RFLP classification), whereas the third clade compromised emerging strains. Resulting risk maps and posterior parameters of the spatiotemporal diffusion history, from the Maxent and phylodynamic analyses, respectively, of the selected clades were combined visually to qualitatively infer some epidemiological insights about the characteristics of the selected PRRSv clades in the Midwest. The set of selected environmental variables (Table S1 ) used in the Maxent analyses, included: (1) pig density; (2) climate; and (3) land cover. The density of pig farms in the region (referred to as pig density) was represented using a kernel density function with a spatial resolution of 5 km 2 and was derived from locations of all pig farms across the US in 2012, retrieved from the United States Department of Agriculture Census of Agriculture website 44 . We obtained climate data (referred to as Bioclime) from the WorldClim in the form of 5 km 2 resolution rasters 45 . We used 15 bioclimatic variables, out of the 19, and excluded the rest due to known spatial artifact in those four variables, as suggested elsewhere 46 . Finally, we retrieved MODIS-based global land cover climatology from the United States Geographical Survey (USGS) webpage, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 km 2 , to provide an estimate of the geographical distribution of 16 different land cover features in the US 47 . We processed the 17 environmental variables using the 'Raster' package 48 implemented in R statistical software version 3.2.2 49 . All environmental layers were converted into a common projection, spatial resolution, and map extent, and each raster was cropped so that the geographical extent of the spatial analyses covered the Midwest swine production region. Raster data were aggregated and resampled to create a uniform grid size, which resulted in a scale of approximately 5 km 2 . Finally, we visually inspected collinearity between each pair of environmental predictors using scatter-plots. (Table 1) . Pig density was, by far, the most important environmental predictor, followed by temperature seasonality, precipitation seasonality, and land cover in the Midwest (Table 1) . Areas with high pig densities, temperature changes around 11 to 13 Â°C, standard deviation and precipitation variability between 40% and 60% over the course of the year, and located nearby permanent wetlands were found mostly suitable for PRRSv outbreaks in the Midwest. Most PRRSv outbreaks (>25%) were observed in southwestern Minnesota and eastern South Dakota (Fig. 1A) . However, the predicted spatial range of high-risk areas (Probability >0.8) in the Midwest included southern and western Minnesota, northwestern Iowa, and eastern and central of South Dakota as well (Fig. 1B ).
