A significant processing time reduction was realized between the conventional (3 days) and microwave-assisted protocol (4 h 25 min or 3 h 20 min, Table 1 ). As the solution exchange in the microwave ''oven'' is not automated, it had to be performed manually as well as the transfer of the samples into the BEEM-capsules for polymerization (including probe identity tags mounting), which required additional time depending on the number of samples processed in parallel (approximately 1 h). The microwave processed resin blocks were polymerized uniformly and revealed good sectioning properties for semiand ultrathin sections. The sections examined in the EM were stable in the electron beam. The images were crisp displaying a high and uniform contrast. After microwave-assisted processing the fine structure of virus-infected cells and infectious agents was well preserved . The SARS-coronaviruses can be clearly recognized in the dilated perinuclear space and RER-cisternae, also the microtubules of the cytoskeleton and mitochondria of the host cells are visible in detail (Fig. 4b) . In cells infected with the elephant Orthopox virus artificial extraction of the core material was much less common (Fig. 5 ). This is a phenomenon often experienced in conventional embedding preparations. In the apathogenic B. anthracis and E. coli culture similar good preservation of the vegetative organisms as well as of mature Anthrax spores were achieved in both conventional LYNX and microwave-assisted embedding (Figs. 6 and 7) ; each mature Anthrax spore displayed a clearly delineated endo-and exosporium covered with tiny surface microfilaments ( Fig. 6b and d) . In the protozoon L. major, the causative agent for tropical sore, the kinetochore-mitochondrium complex -which is the ultrastructural hallmark of the flagellated promastigote form -was preserved excellently in all procedures used (Fig. 8) . The malaria merozoites of Pl. falciparum had well discernible nuclei and vacuoles with typical pigment inclusions (Fig. 9) . The cross-sections through the adult worm C. elegans body displayed very well-preserved layers of the cuticula with underlying muscle cells and the internal organs in all preparations (Fig. 10) . The very good ultrastructural preservation of the mitochondria was a notable feature of this specimen (Fig. 10a) . In the infected Drosophila flies, microsporidia were observed in all body compartments enclosed by the chitine external skeleton (lateral incised for better solution infusion). Well-preserved mature spores were abundant in the completely microwave-assisted fixed and embedded samples (Fig. 11 often showing an uniformly delineated space between the endoand exosporium (Fig. 11a) . The mouse liver samples, which were microwave-assisted fixed and thereafter alternatively conventional or microwaveassisted processed and embedded, showed excellently preserved ultrastructural criteria of the hepatocytes as well as the glycogen and lipid inclusions (Fig. 12) . At higher magnification fine structural details, e.g., the double membrane profiles of the nucleus and mitochondria as well as the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial matrix, did not appear to differ between the two procedures ( Fig. 12b and d) . This high quality ultrastructure preservation was obtained in samples not exceeding 1-mm edge length. In larger samples, the centres of the tissue blocks showed in semithin sections a reduced staining intensity, in ultrathin sections cell shrinkage (dilated intercellular and Disse space), cytoplasmic matrix disruptions and artificial cavity formation as well as loss of mitochondrial fine structure (Fig. 13) . Noteworthy, also with the application of the shortened (3 h 20 min) microwave-assisted protocol convincing results were achieved: a SARS-virus producing cell (Fig. 14a) , a mature B. anthracis spore (Fig. 14b) , and the human surgical liver sample (Fig. 14c ) displayed good quality of the examined ultrastructure. The cytoplasm and organelles of cells and the pathogenic agents, however, clearly differed in densities (Fig. 14 versus Figs. 4b, 6b and 12b), as there was more ''compactness'' and also the membranes appeared coarser, in comparison with the 4.5 h protocol preparation.
