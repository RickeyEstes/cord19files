In vitro expression of MVA-NP constructs In order to verify the proper expression of the inserted CCHF NP, MVA-NP3010 was used in a Western blot assay. Using an anti-V5 antibody to ascertain the molecular size of the inserted protein, a band of approximately 62.5 kDa was observed. This was consistent with the estimated size of the CCHF NP of 52 kDa, 29 plus the V5 tag and tPA regions. Immunogenicity of MVA-NP Effects of type-1 interferon receptor deficiency on vaccine induced immunity Immunogenicity studies used A129 and 129Sv/Ev mouse strains to represent a susceptible CCHF host and the parent wild-type strain, respectively. To assess whether the type-1 interferon receptor deficiency possessed by the A129 mice affected the vaccine-induced immune responses, both strains of mice were immunised with MVA-NP3010 vaccine. As observed in Figure 1 , MVA-NP3010 induced similar numbers of IFN-g secreting cells specific to peptides derived from CCHF NP in both strains of mice (P > 0 .05, Mann-Whitney statistical test). Responses to the tPA and V5 tags were similarly low in both groups, demonstrating the specificity of the response to the inserted protein. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 2 , Western blot analysis revealed that all (5/5) A129 mice developed an antibody response specific to NP as did all 129Sv/Ev mice (5/5). Therefore, a deficiency in the type-1 interferon receptor did not affect the induction of humoral or cell-mediated immune responses of the MVA-NP3010 vaccine in these assays.
