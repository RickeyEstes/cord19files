Biopanning a phage-scFv display library to isolate T. gondii-specific antibodies Mice were immunized with T. gondii tachyzoites over a period of 3 weeks and were found to be seropositive for infection by immunoblot (Fig. S1 ). The mice were sacrificed to harvest the spleens, and scFv antibody fragments were constructed by amplifying V H and V L gene fragments from the isolated splenic mRNA and then fusing the V H and V L regions by SOE-PCR with an intervening seven-amino-acid flexible linker sequence (GGSSRSS) (Fig. S2) . At least 10 separate rounds of PCR were carried out during the construction of the scFv fragments to increase library size and diversity. The scFv fragments were cloned into the phagemid vector pCANTAB5E and expressed as a phage display scFv library with a resulting complexity of 1.62 Â 10 4 independent transformants. Antibodies with appropriate binding activities were selected by a single round of solution-phase biopanning with T. gondii tachyzoites. Multiple rounds of biopanning were undesirable because this resulted in the enrichment of mostly truncated antibody fragments with stop codons in the variable regions (Figs. S3-S7) . The polyclonal biopanned scFv library had a sixfold higher binding titer to the parasite cells than the un-panned scFv library, indicating enrichment for T. gondii-binding scFvs. Biopanning resulted in the selection of four different antibody fragments with T. gondii binding activity, namely scFvs TG64 (GenBank ID: JN104603), TG69 (GenBank ID: JN104604), TG116 (GenBank ID: JN104605), and TG130 (GenBank ID: JN104602). The corresponding amino acid sequences were analyzed using IMGT V-Quest (imgt.cines.fr/textes/vquest) (Table S2) . Antibody germline alignments are provided in Fig. S8 . Based on this analysis, the divergence of the selected variable domain sequences from germline counterparts is summarized in Table 1 . Sequence divergence from the germline repertoire reflects somatic hypermutation events in B cells during affinity maturation (MacLennan, 1994; Li et al., 2004) and indirectly indicates high affinity and/or efficacy. V-Quest analysis showed that scFv TG130 contained the most amino acid point mutations in the CDRs, that is, six residues in total (V H and V L chains), most of which were localized in CDR3 (Table 1) , which usually contributes the most significant contacts in antibody-antigen interactions. In contrast, scFvs TG64, TG69, and TG116 contained fewer deviations from germline sequences (TG64 = 0, TG69 = 2, TG116 = 2) potentially indicating a lower degree of affinity maturation. The sequences were then analyzed using SAROTUP (http://immunet.cn/sarotup/) to exclude false-positive antibody fragments (Huang et al., 2010) . This indicated that scFvs TG64, TG69, and TG116 (but not TG130) contained TUP motifs (Table S3) . Phage rescue was used to produce recombinant phage particles fused to the selected scFv clones for a monoclonal biopanning assay. Each of the scFv-phage clones was titered before and after biopanning (input and output titers, respectively) by eluting the scFvs from tachyzoites to determine their recovery (Fig. 1) . Beginning with an Notes: DNA (nt) and amino acid (a.a.) sequences of recombinant scFv-phages isolated after biopanning with T. gondii tachyzoites were aligned and comparatively analyzed against its closest homology V-region germline counterparts. V-regions' and J-regions' identity levels were determined through the V-Quest program analysis; while CDR mutational events were manually identified and calculated from alignments. 1 Percentage of total number of CDR1-CDR3 a.a residues that differs from its germline a.a sequence of origin, presumably produced during the somatic hypermutation of B cells on exposure to antigens. 2 Total number of a.a residues mutated from the germline sequence of origin in CDR1-CDR3. 3 Amino acid residue mutations present in CDR3. 4 Amino acid residue mutations present in CDR1. average phage-scFv input titer of 10 11 cfu/ml for each clone, we found that scFv TG116 had the highest T. gondii binding titer (5.62 Â 10 5 cfu/ml) and scFv TG130 the lowest (2.05 Â 10 5 cfu/ml). However, statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in the ability of three of the four isolated scFvs to bind T. gondii and HFF cells (p = 0.05, n = 12) despite initial promising binding titers: P TG64 = 0.44, P TG69 = 0.11, and P TG116 = 0.50), indicating that these antibodies were not specific for the parasite target. The remaining antibody (scFv TG130) was more promising and showed significant T. gondii binding specificity (p = 0.05, n = 12) with a fivefold higher binding titer for the parasite compared to HFF (P TG130 = 0.0303; Fig. 1 ). Antibody specificity should take precedence over titers as an indication of bona fide antigen-specific binding. These results are consistent with our bioinformatic analysis showing that scFvs TG64, TG69, and TG116 contained TUPs, were less mature and more likely to be nonspecific. In contrast, scFv TG130 combined unique antibody CDR sequences with high target specificity, justifying its further characterization and functional validation.
