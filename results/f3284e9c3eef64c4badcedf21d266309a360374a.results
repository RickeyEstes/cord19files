Comparison of MW-RCA with conventional RCA using four DNA polymerases To determine the effect of microwave heating, MW-RCA was performed using four thermostable DNA polymerases that had strand displacement activity. Temperature, power, and frequency profiles of MW-RCA using Bst-LF at 30°C for 30 min is shown in Fig 3. A power profile of microwave is a value obtained by subtracting reflected power from incident power. Temperature profile data proved that MW-RCA was performed at precise temperatures. Conventional RCA and MW-RCA reactions were sampled at intervals from 10 to 60 min and 10 to 30 min, respectively, and analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis and fluorescence emission (Fig 4) . The use of the microwave applicator ended in 30 min under high temperature conditions. A comparison of MW-RCA with conventional RCA using the Bst-LF revealed that the reaction product of MW-RCA was increased by a factor of four compared with conventional RCA (Fig 4A) . Fluorescence intensity showed a 4-fold increase than conventional RCA in 30 min. Repetitive DNA sequences repeated four times (300 bp) and eight times (600 bp) were accurately replicated using MW-RCA using Bst-LF under microwave irradiation. The results of each assay showed that the yields of DNA produced by MW-RCA using the Bst DNA polymerase (60°C) were markedly greater compared with those by conventional RCA during the first 30 min ( Fig  4B) . The fluorescence intensities of the MW-RCA reaction sampled at 20 and 30 min and those of the conventional RCA reaction sampled at 60 min showed that the former plateaued at 20 min ( Fig 4B) . The Bst DNA polymerase was the most effective enzyme for MW-RCA. In the same way, MW-RCA using the Csa DNA polymerase was accelerated at 60°C compared with conventional RCA, and polymerization was increased at 20 min. In contrast, DNA synthesis was not detectable in the conventional RCA reaction at 30 min ( Fig 4C) . The fluorescence intensity in MW-RCA using Csa was higher by a factor of 30 at 30 min compared with that of the conventional RCA, and it was almost equal to that of conventional RCA at 60 and 90 min ( Fig 4C) . Reactions using the 96-7 DNA polymerase were incubated at 55°C, its optimum temperature, and showed an increase in discrete bands at 120 min, representing repeated sequences that were detected in the conventional RCA reaction. In contrast, MW-RCA using the 96-7 DNA polymerase showed diffuse migration of high molecular weight DNA molecules at 20 min, although DNA synthesis using conventional RCA was undetectable after 60 min. The fluorescence intensity of the conventional RCA reaction products at 90 min was twice as that of MW-RCA at 30 min (Fig 4D) . Temperature and power profiles of four DNA polymerases under microwave heating are indicated in the supporting information (S1 File). Comparison of temperature profiles of RCA components using the microwave applicator and the heating block To determine the component of RCA by microwave selectivity heating, we measured the temperatures of the five components (circularized template with primers, dNTPs, ThermoPol Buffer, Bst-LF, and RNase-free water) of the RCA and MW-RCA mixtures for 10 min from 13°C to 60°C. A fiber-optic probe was used to measure the temperature of the conventional heating block. All six samples (RCA and its five components) attained 60°C using a 60°C heating block (Fig 5A) . By microwave heating the RCA mixture including all components reached 60°C in 2 min. Moreover, the ThermoPol Buffer with 45 μL of RNase-free water reached 60°C by microwave heating 10 s after the addition of the RCA mixture. Four samples (dNTPs with 46 μL of RNase-free water, circularized template with primers in 50 μL of RNase-free water, 8 U of the Bst DNA polymerase in 50 μL of RNase-free water, and 50 μL of RNase-free water) reached a maximum temperature of 42°C by microwave heating in 10 min (Fig 5B) . Effect of microwave irradiation on the temperatures of higher concentrations of buffer components added to RCA reaction mixtures The results shown in Fig 5 suggest that the ThermoPol Buffer was a primary factor leading to an increase in temperature under microwave irradiation. To determine whether the Thermo-Pol Buffer contained a specific thermal component that was selectivity affected by microwave irradiation, we measured the temperatures of each of the four ThermoPol Buffer components (Fig 6A) . The microwave applicator heated the four components (20 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 10 mM KCl, and 2 mM MgSO 4 ) from 13°C to 60°C for 10 min. The four components did not reach 60°C (Fig 6A) , i.e., the temperature increase of 10 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 was the highest (47°C). In contrast, 10 mM KCl reached 44°C and the temperatures of 20 mM Tris-HCl and 2 mM MgSO 4 (42°C) were nearly identical to the temperature of the RNase-free water. Further, to examine the MW-RCA increased component of microwave selectivity heating, we measured the temperatures of 4-fold excess concentrations of buffer components under microwave irradiation (Fig 6B) . The temperature of 40 mM (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 reached 60°C after 195 seconds and that of 40 mM KCl plateaued at 55°C; the maximum temperature of 80 mM Tris-HCl was 46°C. Increasing the concentration of MgSO 4 from 2 mM to 8 mM increased its maximum temperature from 42°C to 44°C. The quadruple density of all four samples produced an
