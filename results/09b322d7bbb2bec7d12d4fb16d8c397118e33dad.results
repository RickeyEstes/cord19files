A representative semidifferential (semiderivative) voltammogram showing the in vivo detection of the electroactive species for DA and for 5-HT in VTA-(A~0) in the freely moving and behaving rat is shown in Fig. l(a) . Figure l(b) shows the effect of (SC) cocaine at the 40-rain mark after injection; the electroactive species for DA and 5-HT in vivo are equally and significantly increased 118070 above basal values (p < 0.05). .,~. Fig. 4(a) with an activity pattern plot. Additionally, Table 1 shows these activity patterns in the form of a digital readout. The activity pattern analysis, shown in Fig. 4(a) , is representative of the integrated effect of cocaine *p < 0.05, 95e confidence limits of the mean (cf. text for ANOVA statistics). Bold: Hourly mean ± SE (N = 5) from each accumulated 10 min mean ± SE (N = 5). Behavioral data are expressed as frequency (i.e., the numbers of behavioral events that occurred are shown). on ambulatory, central ambulatory, and rearing behavior. Each square-shaped, schematic diagram represents the floor of the behavioral chamber. A comparison with representative activity pattern analysis plots from saline treated animals ( Fig.  4[b] ) serves to emphasize the dramatic cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior shown in Fig. 4(a) . Table 1 shows that cocaine (20 mg/kg SC) significantly increased ambulations [ANOVA, F(4, 20) = 38.964; p < 0.0001; N = 5]. Post-hoc analysis discloses that data in each of the 4-h testing periods was statistically significant (Fisher PLSD = 443.249; Scheffe F = 16.513, 18.948, 32.066, and 23.953, hours 1-4, respectively; p < 0.01; N = 5). A greater than threefold increase in ambulatory behavior was evidenced within the first 10 rain after cocaine administration. A fivefold increase in ambulatory behavior was seen in the first hour after cocaine. No statistically significant differences were seen between any of the individual postcocaine groups (Scheffe F-test < 1.716). The data show that a profound increase in hyperactivity occurred immediately after cocaine, which was then followed by a plateau effect. Central ambulations (Table 1) were significantly increased by (SC) cocaine [ANOVA: F(4, 20) = 38.366; p < 0.0001; N = 5]. Post-hoe analysis indicates that hours 2, 3, and 4 after cocaine were highly significant (Fisher PLSD = 9.364; Scheffe F = 6.423, 27.877, and 19.846 in respective hours; p < 0.01; N = 5). There was a trend toward basal values in the fourth hour after cocaine. Thigmotaxic (agoraphobic) behavior was dramatically reduced by cocaine, tenfold in the first 10 rain and twentyfold in the first hour after cocaine. Rearing behavior (Table 1) 15 .205 and 6.11 l, in respective hours; p < 0.01; N = 5). Further analysis shows that the postcocaine hourly data did not significantly differ (Scheffe F < 2.037), creating a plateau effect. Rearing behavior was increased by fourfold in the first 10 min and greater than sevenfold in the first hour after administration. Fine movements (sniffing and grooming) ( Table l)
