Selection and characterization of phage-displayed peptides by mAbs 7-10A, 5B19, and 5B170 The mAbs 7-10A, 5B19, and 5B170 were used to screen, side by side, different conformationally constrained and unconstrained phage libraries. As indicated in Table 1 , phage pools having the highest yields and ELISA signals were selected for further study. From these, phage clones were isolated and sequenced in the nucleotide region encoding the displayed peptides (Table 2). As illustrated in Table 1 , the highest yields in rounds 3 and 4 of panning for all three mAbs were from libraries displaying one or two fixed cysteine residues, (405-490 nm) and the ELISA data showed further restriction of the tightest binding phage to a single library for each mAb. Analysis of the amino acid sequences of the selected phage allowed the identification of consensus sequences for peptides recognized by the antiviral mAbs 5B19 and 5B170, which recognize continuous epitopes ( Table 2 ). The critical binding sequence for each of these two mAbs was very similar since phage selected by both mAbs cross-reacted: phage selected by mAb 5B170 were recognized strongly by mAb 5B19 and vice versa, albeit at a lower level, whereas no phage reacted with the isotypic control mAb (Fig. 1) . For mAb 7-10A, which recognizes a discontinuous epitope (Daniel and Talbot, 1990) , consensus amino acid sequences were more difficult to identify; this is typical of antibodies against discontinuous epitopes (e.g., see Felici et al., 1993; Luzzago et al., 1993) . Figure 2 illustrates the amino acid identities between selected phage-displayed peptides and murine coronavirus S glycoprotein sequences. In contrast with other studies (Balass et al., 1993; Felici et al., 1993; , amino acid identity was obtained for phage 12.9, selected by mAb 7-10A, and a linear region of the S glycoprotein of several coronavirus strains. The 7-10A FIG. 1. ELISA for determining cross-reactive phage recognition by mAbs 5B19 and 5B170. Microtiter plates were coated with 1 g/ml of the indicated mAbs, and binding of varying amounts of mAb 5B19-and 5B170-selected phage was determined using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-M13 conjugate. Open symbols represent phage selected by mAb 5B19 (except á®€, control vector phage f88.4), and filled symbols represent phage selected by mAb 5B170. mAb recognizes a discontinuous epitope on S1, as shown by binding studies on isolated S glycoprotein subunits (P. J. Talbot and K. V. Holmes, unpublished data) . Clone 12.9 contains two cysteines and bears similarities to residues 153-161 of the S glycoprotein of MHV. This clone represents the first sequence information obtained on the epitope recognized by mAb 7-10A. For mAb 5B170, Fig. 2 shows that three different phage clones had amino acid identity with sequences of the S glycoprotein of MHV. Sequences within and including the C(V/I)GSXC consensus of clones 7.2 and 8.3 show a match of 6 amino acids within residues 850-857 of MHV-A59 , 902-909 of MHV-4 (Schmidt et al., 1987) and MHV-JHM (cl-2) (Taguchi et al., 1992) , and 761-768 of MHV-JHM (Grosse and Siddell, 1993) . Moreover, the matching sequence of clone 8.3 represents an almost exact match with the residues mentioned above since the Ile to Val amino acid change is conservative. Finally, the matching sequence observed for clone 9.1 shares almost complete identity with residues 890-897 of MHV-Y (Kunita et al., 1995) ; it also shares 6 amino acids with the same residues described above. This is the first detailed information reported on the epitope recognized by mAb 5B170, which was only known to bind to an immunodominant region on the S2 subunit of the S glycoprotein (Daniel et al., 1993) . This epitope appears to be conserved among several strains of MHV. We used mAb 5B19 as a positive control for our experiments since synthetic peptide scanning (PEPSCAN) was previously used to characterize the epitope recognized by this mAb (Luytjes et al., 1989) . The peptide sequence that it selected bears the C(V/I)GSXC consensus identified by mAb 5B170, confirming our results. This result is consistent with previous epitope mapping by ELISA (Daniel et al., 1993) showing that mAbs 5B170 and 5B19 compete with each other for binding to virus. The sequences of the binding regions for both antibodies are identical in MHV-JHM and A59, suggesting that the epitopes recognized by mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 are conserved on the S2 subunit of MHV. To exclude the possibility that these two mAbs are the same or a closely related antibody, the V H regions of both antibodies were sequenced. Table 3 illustrates the very different amino acid sequences of complementarity-determining regions (CDR) of mAbs used in this study. To evaluate the importance of disulfide bridging in binding to mAbs, an ELISA test was performed in the presence or absence of the reducing agent DTT. The results shown in Fig. 3 indicate that disulfide bridging within the phage-displayed peptides was more important for recognition by mAb 7-10A than for mAbs 5B19 and 5B170, since the binding of mAb 7-10A with peptides was more affected by DTT. As a control, immobilized virus was also treated with DTT; the binding of mAb 7-10A to virus was not affected (Fig. 3B) . However, the binding of mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 with the virus was unexpectedly more affected when the virus was treated with DTT. The results suggest that the two cysteines observed in the peptides recognized by mAbs 5B19 and 5B170 may directly interact with the mAb binding site or that disulfide constraints are important but not absolutely required for binding. The alignment analysis shown in Fig. 2C , in which two cysteines form a portion of the epitope, is supported by the fact that several of the clones selected by mAb 5B170 came from the X8CX8 library, in which only one Cys residue is fixed. The second, C-terminal Cys residue in the sequence was selected by mAb from a fully randomized residue.
