The detection rate using RT-PCR in all ARI episodes was 81.8%. In single infections, there was a small, but statistically significant difference between median CT values of RSV for hospitalized versus non-hospitalized children (23.17 versus 24.57, p 0.04) ( Table 2) . For Human Coronavirus (HCoV), there was a moderate correlation between CT value and disease severity (rho −0.548, p 0.006). For influenza virus (FLU), there was a moderate correlation between CT value and length of oxygen use (rho 0.55, p 0.027). In RSV-HCoV multiple infections, there was a moderate correlation between CT values of RSV and LOS (rho −0.526, p 0.021) ( Table 2 ). This correlation was not found for single HCoV in the same children. In RSV-Rhinovirus (RV) multiple infections, there was a strong correlation between CT values of RV and LOS (rho 0.781, p 0.008) and between CT values of RV and length of oxygen use (rho 0.771, p 0.009). In RV multiple infections in which RSV was excluded (RV + any other, except RSV), no significant correlations were found between CT values of RV and clinical parameters. In RVmultiple infections (RV + any other virus, including RSV) there was a moderate correlation between the CT values of RV and length of oxygen use (rho 0.552, p 0.005). These correlations were not found for RSV in the same children. For RV, HCoV and for parainfluenza virus (PIV), the median CT values in single infections were significantly lower than for multiple infections (Table 3) . For RSV, no significant differences of median CT values were found between single and multiple infections.
