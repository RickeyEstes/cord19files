A total of 1,970 passengers and 734 crew members were on cruise A. Median age of passengers was 46 years (range 1-94 years), 57% were female, and most were from Australia ( Table 1) . Median age of crew members was 31 years (range 19-62 years), and most were born overseas (not in Australia). ILI developed in 13 (0.7%) passengers who sought medical attention during the cruise; and infl uenza A results from point-of-care testing were positive for 6. NAT of samples from persons who were sick during the cruise or during the 7 days after disembarkation showed positive pandemic infl uenza virus results for 76 (3.9%), positive seasonal infl uenza results for 98 (5.0%), and positive co-infection results for 2 (0.1%). ILI in the 7 days before disembarkation was reported by 15 (2.0%) crew members; NAT showed positive pandemic infl uenza results for 3 crew members and positive seasonal infl uenza results for none. These crew members were isolated on shore. The remaining 719 crew members were given oseltamivir prophylaxis and continued to work during cruise B; among these, 5 reported ILI (all within 24 hours of cruise B departing), and 3 had positive NAT results for pandemic infl uenza virus. Therefore, 20 (2.7%) crew members from cruise A reported ILI, and 6 (0.8%) of these had positive pandemic infl uenza test results; none had positive seasonal infl uenza test results. Given the relatively low attack rate for the crew, we focused further investigation on the passengers, among whom the attack rate for pandemic infl uenza was highest for children 3-6 years of age, followed by children 7-12 years of age. For seasonal infl uenza, the attack rate was similar among children in all age groups ( Table 1) .
