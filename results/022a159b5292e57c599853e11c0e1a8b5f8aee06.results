The headline results concern the impact on the exchange rate and GDP for each scenario tabulated in Table 1 . The percentage impacts on these parameters compared with the input equilibrium parameters are plotted in Fig. 1 . The magnitude of effect for exchange rate is approximately 75% of the GDP impact for all scenarios, so comments focus here on GDP. The GDP impact for disease only ranges from a reduction of approximately 0.26% for the mild scenario to approximately 0.56% for the severe scenario. These relative values would be broadly comparable to other countries or, converting these percentage losses to financial values, costs applicable to our UK example can be obtained. Losses in GDP due to the pandemic alone are £3.5bn, £5bn, £7.4bn for the three scenarios respectively (based on overall UK GDP of £1.3trn for 2007). Introducing four weeks of school closure would increase these losses to 0.45%, 0.56% and 0.73% respectively, equivalent to £58bn, £7.3bn and £9.5bn. Introducing prophylactic absenteeism, rather than school closure, produces a more varied pattern of impact, since as well as having an increased disease effect, the duration of prophylactic absence was assumed to increase with the severity of disease. The GDP reductions for these scenarios were 1.03%, 1.16% and 1.34% for the mild, moderate and severe disease scenarios (equivalent to losses of £13.5bn, £15.1bn and £17.4bn respectively for the UK). Finally, combining disease, school closures and prophylactic absenteeism yields, rather unsurprisingly, the largest impact, with reductions of 1.14%, 1.25% and 1.42% respectively, equivalent to UK losses of £14.8bn, £16.3bn and £18.5bn. CGE modelling also produces the welfare measure of Equivalent Variation (EV), which represents the amount of money that, if an economic change does not happen, leaves the individual just as well off as if the change had occurred. This may be thought of as the amount of money that the individual might be willing to pay to avert the change. For the purposes of this paper, the welfare measure (EV) is quoted as a percentage of GDP, with the results presented in Table 3 . These results follow a similar pattern to the GDP and exchange rate effects and range from 0.2% for the mild disease only scenario up to 1.05%, suggesting that UK consumers overall would be willing to pay some £2.55bn to £13.68bn to avert the pandemic's economic impact. These estimates do not include individuals' willingness to pay to avoid the illness and possible death that accompany pandemic influenza.
