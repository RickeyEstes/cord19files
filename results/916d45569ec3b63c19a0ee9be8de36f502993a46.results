The number of isolates recovered and the number examined from each site (including fecal samples) at each swine house was presented in Table 2 . Table 2 showed that a total of 60 fecal samples were examined, and 57 E. coli strains were detected in this experiment. At the same time, 41 E. coli strains from indoor air and 19 E. coli strains from downwind air were detected. Only 3 E. coli strains from upwind air were detected at swine house C ( Table 2) . The electrophoretic profiles of the ERIC-PCR products were determined for the E. coli strains isolated from indoor air, outdoor air and fecal samples. The data matrices based on the DNA fragments and the dendrogram using the NTSYS-pc software were constructed, grouping all E. coli isolates obtained in this study into different clusters or branches based on the ERIC-PCR pattern similarity. For best comparision and resolution, the ERIC DNA fragments from the isolates obtained from the same animal house were amplified in one PCR reaction and loaded on the same gel. According to the UPGMA dendrogram (Figs. 1-5), each swine house contained fecal-obtained E. coli strains that shared 100% similarity with the corresponding air-obtained E. coli strains. Additional air sampled strains obtained either upwind, downwind, or indoor had the similarity ranged from 100% to 58% (swine house A); to 43% (swine house B); to 61% (swine house C); to 52% (swine house D); to 50% (swine house E) with the corresponding strains isolated from fecal samples. The number of E. coli strains isolated from indoor air which shared 100% similarity with fecal strains was different in 5 swine houses (Table 3) . 3.1. The similarity among E. coli strains isolated from indoor air and fecal samples As shown in the UPGMA dendrograms, 33.3% (14/42) of E. coli strains (Table 3 ) isolated from indoor air samples shared 100% similarity with corresponding strains isolated from fecal samples in the five swine houses. In swine house A, strains indoor-3 and -4 shared 100% similarity with feces-6, while the same was observed for indoor-1 and feces-9 (swine house B); indoor-1, -11 and feces-1 (swine house C); indoor-8 and feces-3, -10 (swine house D); indoor-9 and feces-5 (swine house D); indoor-3 and feces-5 (swine house E); (Figs. 1-5). In addition, 23.8% (10/42) of E. coli strains isolated from indoor air samples had X90% but o100% similarity with the fecal strains. In swine house A, indoor-1 and feces-6 shared 93% similarity; in swine house B, indoor-3, -6 and feces-9 shared 92% similarity as did indoor-5 and feces-10; in swine house C, over 90% similarity existed among indoor-2, -4 and feces -1, -3, -6, -10; in swine house D indoor-2 and feces-12 shared 93% similarity; in swine house E, indoor-4 and feces-5 had 94% similarity (Figs. 1-5) . Of the strains isolated from indoor air samples, 50.0% (21/42) hado90% similarity with strains isolated from fecal samples in Table 2 Number of isolates recovered and the number examined from each site at each swine house.
