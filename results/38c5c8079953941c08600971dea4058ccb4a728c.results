The CPE in various cells (MA104, HRT-18 and MDBK cells) appeared on the third day of incubation and consisted of rounding and detachment of cells. Real time RT-PCR of infected cell culture fluids indicated the absence of BCV, BRV, and BVDV. However, BLAST analysis of Illumina sequence contigs gave match with BEV and the complete nt sequence of BEV/Egypt/2014/KM667941 was 7417 nt. The organization of nt was typical of the BEV genome including 822 nt in 5′NTR, 6498 nt for ORF, and 97 nt in 3′NTR. The detailed nt and aa content of each gene with their predicted cleavage sites were estimated ( Phylogenetic analysis based on complete ORF of BEV/Egypt/ 2014/KM667941with other genera of Picornaviridae revealed that the virus belonged to the enterovirus genus (Fig. 1A) . Within enteroviruses, the study sequence clustered with BEV-F with 95% aa identity with BEV-F2 (AAZ73369). The isolate grouped differently from BEV-E strains with maximum aa identity of 75% (Fig. 1B) . Sequence analysis of P1 region, which encodes four genes (VP4, VP2,VP3 and VP1), revealed that the BEV-VP1 gene is the most variable among the four structural genes and shared only 75-76% nt identity (92-94% aa identity) with BEV-F2 strains (HQ663846, AY508697, and AY508696). The VP4 gene had the least variation as the nt identity was 80-84% (93-97% aa identity) with other strains of BEV-F2 (see Appendix: Supplementary Table S1 ). The P2 region that encodes three genes (2A, 2B and 2C) showed high identity with HQ663846 (BJ001/China) sharing 82% nt and 98% aa identity. The P2 region (genes 2A and 2B) had high variation among BEV-E and BEV-F strains as compared the 2C gene. The identity was 66-69% nt (75-76% aa), 65-67% nt (70-71% aa) and 71% nt (79% aa) in 2A, 2B and 2C genes, respectively (see Appendix: Supplementary  Table S2 ). The P3 region consists of four genes (3A, 3B, 3C and 3D). The variation in P3 region was the least among the three polypeptides and the 3D gene was highly conserved. Alignment of the conserved gene (3D) with other BEV-E and BEV-F viruses in GenBank revealed that the BEV/Egypt/2014/KM667941closely matched with HQ663846 (BJ001/China) sequence with nt identity of 85% (98% aa) (see Appendix: Supplementary Table S3 ). In relation to the known BEV-E and BEV-F strains, there were several variable regions in the capsid protein especially in the VP1 and VP2 genes of BEV/Egypt/2014/ KM667941. The aa substitutions in the genome of the study strain are shown in Table 2 . All remaining viral isolates were positive by RT-PCR yielding the expected amplicon size of 450 bp for 3D gene and 1180 bp for 5′NTR. The 3D and 5′NTR sequences of six representative isolates were 100% identical with each other and all clustered with BEV/Egypt/2014/KM667941. The GenBank accession numbers for 3D sequences are: KM887136, KM887137, KM887138, KM887139, KM887140 and KM887141. For 5′NTR the numbers are KM887130, KM887131, KM887132, KM887133, KM887134 and KM887135. Each identified genus/species is represented by at least one virus. Amino Acid sequences were aligned with the Clustal W program. Branch lengths are proportional to the genetic divergence. The evolutionary history was inferred using maximum Likelihood method in MEGA 6.0.
