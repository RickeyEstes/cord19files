BAL was performed in 120 AHSCT recipients during the study period. 66 procedures were excluded for patient age<18 (n¼1), subsequent procedures on the same patient (n¼34), and BAL performed before transplant (n¼31). 54 patients who had a BAL after AHSCT were included. Patient demographics, antimicrobials at bronchoscopy, and BAL results are described in Table I . Most antimicrobial therapy was started within two days (n¼11) or over 7 days (n¼18) before BAL. Eleven patients were not receiving antimicrobials. BAL was positive for infectious etiologies in 63%, mostly with elevated AGA (17/54), followed by multiplex PCR (13/54), positive bacterial (8/54), fungal (4/54) and AFB culture (1/54). None of the patients with a positive bacterial culture were on levofloxacin prophylaxis. Of the patients with a positive fungal result, 14/17 were on antifungal prophylaxis. Only 2/17 patients with a positive BAL AGA also had a positive serum AGA. All of the positive multiplex PCR were for viruses. Nine patients had multiple infectious etiologies, all with a positive multiplex PCR. Twentyeight patients had concomitant non-pulmonary infections. No patients were found to have Pneumocystis jirovecicii, Legionella, or Cryptococcus by cytology or antigen testing. Antimicrobials were adjusted in 48/54 (89%) of patients (Table II) . Overall antibiotic escalation occurred in 19/54, and was associated with a positive BAL bacterial culture (OR 7.61, P¼0.017) (Table II) . Antibiotic de-escalation was more likely with an elevated AGA (OR 3.86, P¼0.035) (Table II) . Antiviral initiation was more likely with positive BAL multiplex PCR (OR 17.33, P¼0.010) (Table II) . Antifungals were more likely to be escalated or changed with an elevated AGA (OR 4.33, P¼0.020) ( Table II) . The patients with a negative BAL were more likely to be started on steroids (OR 0.19, P¼ 0.043).
