Phylogenetic trees based on three APV genes (P4b, cnpv186, and DNA polymerase) DNA sequences were constructed and all confirmed the common classification in the genus: canarypox-like viruses, fowlpox-like viruses, and psittacinepox-like viruses ( Fig. 1) . To assess both substitution rate per site per year and TMRCA, different combinations of demographic models and clock models were compared: constant size or extended Bayesian skyline plot models, strict or relaxed (lognormal or exponential) clocks. The lowest AICM values were obtained with a relaxed exponential clock and the extended Bayesian skyline plot model for both cnpv186 and the DNA polymerase genes (AICM values of 11,673.74 ± 0.11 standard error (SE) and 7,316.26 ± 0.12 SE for cnpv186 and DNA polymerase genes, respectively, Table 2 ). For the P4b gene, the AICM value was slightly lower with a strict clock and the Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot model than with a relaxed exponential clock and the extended Bayesian skyline plot model (AICM values of 8, 492.42 ± 0.21 SE and 8, 493.49 ± 0.44 SE, respectively) . We however decided to use the same combination for our three genes for consistency: a relaxed exponential clock and the extended Bayesian skyline plot model (Table 2 ). Analyses were also performed using the General Time Reversible substitution model with gamma-distributed rate and invariant sites (GTR + G + I, best fitted model as per MrModeltest), which gave similar results (data not shown). Our molecular clock analyses showed that APV diverged from a common ancestor approximately 10-30 thousand years ago: 8,682 (95% Highest Posterior Density (HPD): 950-60,718), 10,891 (95% HPD: 963-93,707), and 29,259 (95% HPD: 1871-197,714) years ago for DNA polymerase, cnpv186, and P4b, respectively ( Fig. 1) . Interestingly, fowlpox-like and psittacinepox-like viruses shared a more recent common ancestor than canarypox-like viruses: they diverged 5-16 thousand years ago (5,034 (95% HPD: 625-34,636) years ago for DNA polymerase, 16,012 (95% HPD: 1208-117,230) years ago for P4b, no psittacinepox-like viruses sequence are available for cnpv186, Fig. 1 ). When considering APV collected the same year in the same location such as
