β6 KO mice are protected from diverse respiratory infections β6 expression is induced upon mechanical or inflammatory injury and is an important mediator of ALI [10, 12, 14, 30] . Thus, we hypothesized that upregulation of the β6 integrin during respiratory infections would be involved in viral pathogenesis. To test this, we measured β6 expression by quantitative RT-PCR at different times post-influenza infection. Consistent with lung injury models, β6 mRNA was significantly upregulated in whole lung homogenates by 3 days post-infection (dpi) and expression remained elevated through 5 dpi (p < 0.0001) correlating with the appearance of ALI (Fig 1A) . We then intranasally infected WT and Itgb6-deficient mice (β6 KO mice) with A/California/04/2009 (CA/09) H1N1 virus and monitored morbidity for 12 dpi. Compared to WT controls, β6 KO mice lost significantly less weight (4, 6, and 8 dpi p < 0.0001) and began to recover by 10 dpi, while WT mice lost weight and either succumbed to infection or were euthanized due to morbidity between 6-10 dpi (Fig 1B and  1C ). The dose of CA/09 virus used (10 4 TCID 50 ) was lethal to all WT mice, while 70% β6 KO mice survived the infection (p = 0.0090). Mouse lethal dose 50 (MLD 50 ) studies demonstrated the resistance of the β6 KO to influenza infection, with WT mice having an MLD 50 of 10 2.5 versus 10 5.3 for the KO to the CA/09 virus. Protection was not limited to H1N1 infection; β6 KO mice were also protected from an emerging strain of avian influenza virus associated with severe and even fatal human respiratory disease [17] , A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza virus (p = 0.0326, Fig 1D) . β6 KO mice were also significantly protected from a lethal challenge of Sendai virus (p = 0.006, Fig 1E) and Streptococcus pneumonia (p = 0.0082, Fig 1F) . A major risk factor for influenza infection is secondary bacterial pneumonia [31] . As β6 KO mice were protected from individual influenza and S. pneumoniae challenges, we tested the β6 KO mice with a secondary bacterial challenge model. Mice were inoculated intranasally with a sublethal dose of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 influenza virus, and 7 dpi administered a low dose Inhibiting increased β6 integrin levels during respiratory infections is protective. β6 KO or WT mice were intranasally inoculated with CA/09 H1N1 influenza virus (10 4 TCID 50 ) and monitored for (A) β6 mRNA expression in lungs as quantitated by qPCR and normalized to GAPDH as a control. Data is pooled from 2 independent experiments with n = 2 mice per group. p< 0.0001 by Student's t test; (B) weight loss and (C) survival for 12 dpi. Data from (B) is pooled from 6 of S. pneumoniae (D39X strain) [32] . This dual infection model is generally lethal in WT mice, although neither challenge alone causes death [33] . Survival of WT mice after secondary challenge was~30%, while β6 KO mice were significantly protected (p = 0.0226) with 70% survival (Fig 1G) highlighting the importance of β6 integrin in the pathogenesis of respiratory infections.
