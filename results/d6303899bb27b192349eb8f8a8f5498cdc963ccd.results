From 1983 through 2015, the number of deaths from infectious diseases exhibited a U-shaped trend, whereas the number of deaths from noninfectious diseases decreased from 594.3 to 496.9/100,000 population ( Figure 1 ). The age-standardized mortality rate from infectious diseases decreased from 43.5/100,000 population in 1983 to 16.5/100,000 in 1996 but then increased to 44.6/100,000 in 2015. In 1983, infectious diseases caused 6.8% (17,376/254,563) of all deaths in South Korea; in 2015, the percentage was 8.3% (22,766/275,895) . TB was the leading cause of infectious disease death in 1983 (7,853 deaths; 23.7/100,000 population) ( Table 2 ). In contrast, in 2015, respiratory tract infections were the most common causes of death from infectious diseases (15,030 deaths; 19.5/100,000 population). Of the top 5 infectious diseases (by number of deaths per 100,000 population), CNS infections and vaccine-preventable diseases (on the 1983 list) were replaced by sepsis and viral hepatitis (on the 2015 list). We analyzed mortality rates by age group (Figure 2 ). Infant mortality (i.e., in persons age <1 year) was >100 deaths/100,000 population during 1983-1985, decreased to 38/100,000 in 1994, and fell further to <10/100,000 in 2011. The trends in mortality caused by infectious diseases varied among elderly populations. Among persons age >65 years, mortality rates were 206 deaths/100,000 population in 1983, 135/100,000 in 1996, and 307/100,000 in 2015. We analyzed trends in age-specific infectious disease mortality rates by using joinpoint analysis (Table 3) . Among infants <1 year of age, 3 periods of change were evident. The first period was associated with an APC of -10.86, the second period (2007-2010) with an APC of 14.56, and the third period (2010-2015) with an APC of -18.45. Overall, the average APC for 1983-2015 was -9.41, reflecting a significant decrease from 124.2 to 4.1 deaths/100,000 population. Among persons age >65 years, the average APC did not vary significantly during this period (APC 1.44), but the APC increased significantly during 2007-2015 (APC 7.70). We analyzed age-standardized mortality rates associated with respiratory infections, sepsis, and TB ( Figure 3 , panel A). TB-related mortality rates decreased during 1983-2015. In 2015, the rate was 3 deaths/100,000 population. During 1983-2015, mortality attributable to respiratory tract infections (pneumonia, empyema, and influenza) increased from 15 to 20 deaths/100,000 population, and sepsis mortality increased from 1 to 4/100,000. We also analyzed age-standardized mortality rates for intestinal infections, vaccine-preventable diseases, CNS infections, and viral hepatitis ( Figure 3, panel B) . From 1983 to 1999, the mortality rates associated with all of these diseases decreased. Since 2000, the mortality rates associated with intestinal infections and viral hepatitis have gradually increased. Mortality rates varied by infectious disease; mortality from TB, sepsis, and viral hepatitis exhibited the greatest shifts from 1983 to 2015 (Table 4 ). The overall average APC (from 1983 to 2015) for respiratory tract infections was 1.06 (15.1 to 19.5 deaths/100,000 population). However, a significant average APC decrease occurred during 1983-1992 (APC -8.89), and a significant increase oc- We stratified mortality rates from infectious diseases by education level for persons >65 years of age (Table 5) .
