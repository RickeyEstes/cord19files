The crystal structure of the six-helix bundle core of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein contains an extended central trimeric coiled coil of N-terminal heptad-repeat sequences and distinctly shorter C-terminal helices that are limited to two central heptad-repeat units within the longer heptadrepeat sequence (see Fig. 1 ). To assess the role of this sixhelix structure in promoting membrane fusion, we subjected the C-terminal heptad-repeat region of the S glycoprotein from the Urbani isolate of SARS-CoV to scanning mutagenesis. Specifically, we focused on residues at a and d positions in the heptad repeats, as these hydrophobic sidechains contribute to interhelical knob-inhole packing interactions that play a dominant role in stabilizing coiled-coil structures (Crick, 1953) . These amino acids were individually replaced with serine, a polar residue that would be expected to disturb hydrophobic packing interactions while retaining good a-helix propensity (Chakrabartty et al., 1994) . Previous studies of the murine coronavirus S glycoprotein suggested that less severe substitutions with individual alanine residues, a small Fig. 1 . SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and six-helix bundle. (A) Schematic drawing of S glycoprotein including S1 and S2 domains and the N-and C-terminal heptad-repeat regions. The C-terminal heptad-repeat region is expanded to show the amino acid sequence and the repeating hydrophobic a and d positions. Our analysis spans residues V1158 through L1182. Other landmarks include the signal peptide (sp), the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1, and the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic (cyto) domains in S2. Sequence homology was used to approximate the location of the S1 -S2 boundary, as the furin protease recognition site that is cleaved in Group 2 coronaviruses to form discrete S1 and S2 subunits is absent in the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein (see Discussion).

The helical region is shown in cartoon form and residues included within the heptad repeats are shown as sidechains. helix-forming amino acid that contributes minimally to hydrophobicity, were insufficient to disrupt six-helix bundle packing (Luo et al., 1999) . Expression of the wild-type and mutant SARS-CoV S glycoproteins in simian COS-7 cells was obtained by transient transfection and was driven by the recombinant vTF7-3 vaccinia virus T7 RNA polymerase (Fuerst et al., 1986) . Metabolically labeled cells were lysed in cold Trissaline buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and S glycoproteins were isolated via an S-peptide (Spep) affinity tag (Kim and Raines, 1993) at the cytoplasmic C-terminus and S-protein agarose (Novagen). The Spep addition is innocuous with regard to S glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion (not shown), in keeping with reports of other Cterminal tags (Bisht et al., 2004; Bosch et al., 2004; Moore et al., 2004) . The glycoproteins were then eluted in NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS) and reducing agent and resolved using NuPAGE 3 -8% Tris -acetate gels. As shown in Fig.  2 , each of the wild-type and mutant glycoproteins was expressed to yield the terminally glycosylated glycoprotein of approximately 220 kDa molecular weight, as well as an immature, Endo H-sensitive form of 200 kDa (Bisht et al., 2004; Song et al., 2004 and K.E.F. and J.H.N, unpublished) . The 220-kDa form of the mutant S glycoproteins appeared to migrate somewhat slower than that of the wild type, suggesting a subtle change in terminal glycosylation. Upon deglycosylation with peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England BioLabs), all migrated uniformly at the expected 140-kDa molecular weight of the S polypeptide (not shown). As has been reported by others (Bisht et al., 2004; Simmons et al., 2004; Song et al., 2004; Xiao et al., 2003) , we found no evidence of proteolytic maturation of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein to form discrete S1 and S2 subunits. Expression levels of all the mutant S glycoproteins were generally similar to the wild type, with the exception of A1172S, which was reduced. Higher molecular-weight forms of the glycoproteins were also observed to variable degrees among the wild-type and mutant samples ( Fig. 2 and below) . Transport of the S glycoproteins to the cell surface was determined by flow cytometry using the SARS-CoV neutralizing MAb F26G18 (Berry et al., 2004) and was found to be unperturbed in all the mutants, including A1172S (Fig. 3) . Cell-surface binding of the mutant glycoproteins by other S glycoprotein-directed MAbs (viz., F26G6, F26G8, and F26G19; Berry et al., 2004) was also similar to that of the wild type (not shown). These four MAbs recognize predominantly linear epitopes in the S1 domain (Berry et al., 2004; K.E.F. and J.H.N, unpublished) , and thus binding reflects the amount of cell-surface glycoprotein more so than its conformational integrity. Nonetheless, the consistency in cell-surface fluorescence is suggestive of similar transport and presentation. Taken together, these data indicate that none of the serine substitutions markedly affected the biosynthesis or transport to the cell surface of the mutant S glycoproteins. The ability of the wild-type and mutant S glycoproteins to mediate membrane fusion was assessed by cell -cell fusion using the recombinant vaccinia virus-based hgalactosidase fusion reporter assay (Nussbaum et al., 1994) . COS-7 cells expressing the S glycoproteins were co-cultured with COS-7 cells expressing the cell surface receptor of the SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) . Cell -cell fusion was detected by the induced expression in syncytia of the h-galactosidase reporter. Cell -cell fusion by the wild-type and mutant S Fig. 2 . Expression of wild-type and mutant S glycoproteins. The metabolically labeled S glycoproteins were affinity isolated and separated using NuPAGE 3 -8% Tris -acetate gels (Invitrogen). Samples were heated to 70 -C in sample buffer containing LDS and reducing agent prior to electrophoresis. Fixed and dried gels were visualized using a Fuji-3000G Phosphorimager. Rainbow [ 14 C]-molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the 500-kDa HiMark standard (Invitrogen) are indicated. The mature and immature glycoforms of the S glycoprotein are evident, as are very high molecular-weight species. Identical patterns were obtained using the untagged S glycoprotein and immunoprecipitation by MAbs directed to the S1 domain (not shown). glycoproteins was entirely dependent on expression of the ACE2 receptor (not shown; Li et al., 2003; Xiao et al., 2003) . In these experiments, the ability of the S glycoproteins to mediate ACE2-dependent cell -cell fusion varied markedly among the mutants (Fig. 4A) . Substitutions at the termini of the heptad-repeat region had no effect on fusogenicity (viz. V1158S, L1179S, and L1182S) whereas more centrally located substitutions produced variable deficiencies ranging from 10% of wild-type activity (for L1168S) to Ã¥40% of wild-type activity (for I1161S and A1172S). Interestingly, all the amino acids identified as important for cell -cell fusion in this analysis lie within the short Cterminal a-helix; these a and d position sidechains pack directly into the hydrophobic grooves of the N-terminal coiled coil (Fig. 4B ). In the crystal structure, the outlying residues (V1158S, L1179S, and L1182S) exist in an extended non-a-helical conformation of O-X-O repeats (Duquerroy et al., 2005; Ingallinella et al., 2004; Supekar et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004b) and are not positioned to interact in a conventional knob-into-hole manner with the N-terminal coiled coil. Instead, both V1158 and L1179 utilize main-chain atoms to interact with asparagine and glutamine sidechains on the N-terminal coiled coil (Duquerroy et al., 2005) . These interactions are likely undisturbed in the mutant glycoproteins. The convergence between the crystallographic structure of the six-helix bundle and those sidechains critical for membrane fusion provides strong evidence for the central importance of the a-helical bundle in SARS-CoV S glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion. It is likely that serine substitutions that affect S glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion (I1161S, I1165S, L1168S, A1172S, and L1175S) act, in part, by destabilizing the six-helix bundle. Support for this conjecture may be gleaned from an analysis of the higher molecular-weight forms of the S glycoprotein (>500 kDa) shown in Fig. 2 . These aggregates are stable at 70 -C to disulfide-bond reduction and LDS denaturation and vary in a consistent manner in the extent of their formation. In appearance and stability, these higher molecular-weight forms are reminis- cent of the fusion-active oligomers of the avian leukosis retrovirus envelope glycoprotein that are induced upon receptor binding and acidic pH (Matsuyama et al., 2004; Mothes et al., 2000; Netter et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2004) . Formation of such oligomers may also be triggered by nonphysiological means, such as by treatment with nonionic detergent, heat, urea, or guanidium hydrochloride (Carr et al., 1997; Ruigrok et al., 1986; Wallin et al., 2004 Wallin et al., , 2005 . It is possible then that the higher molecular-weight forms observed in the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein represent postfusion oligomers that provide a fortuitous measure of the relative stability of the wild-type and mutant six-helix bundles. In many of the fusion-deficient S glycoproteins (viz., I1161S, L1168S, A1172S, and L1175S), mutations that affect fusogenicity also affect the extent of formation (Fig. 2 ) and the thermal stability (not shown) of the higher molecular-weight forms. If borne out in biophysical studies, this interpretation lends additional support to the concept that the formation and stability of the six-helix bundle is intimately coupled to membrane fusion. The I1165S mutant in which fusogenicity is diminished despite the ample formation of the higher molecular-weight species suggests that other parameters may also be important.
