A total of 40 patients were analysed (Table 1) . Mean age of the study population was 50.6 years, 18(45%) of the subjects were more than 55 years of age and 28 (70%) were male. The commonest comorbidity was diabetes mellitus in 17 patients (42.5%) followed by chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 9 (22.5%) and drug induced (prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil in various combinations) T cell immunosuppression in 8 (20%) patients. In 13 (32.5%) patients there were no co-morbidities. The most common respiratory virus was rhino virus in 9 (22.5%) patients followed by influenza H3/H3N2 in 7 (17.5%), H1N1 in 6 (15%) and RSV in 4 (10%). All strains of influenza taken together constituted 19 (47.5%) patients. Mixed infections were found in 5 (12.5%) patients. Most cases of influenza were seen during November ( Fig. 1) which coincides with the Northeast monsoon in Chennai and surrounding areas. Two peaks of HRV were seen in March and June. Fever was the most common clinical feature seen in 29 (72.5%) patients followed by cough in 24 (60%), rhinorrhea in 23 (57.5%) and dyspnea in 23 (57.5%). A history of contact with another person with a respiratory virus like illness was present in 22 (55%) patients. Chest X Ray was normal in 12 (30%) of the subjects and other subjects had varied findings as summarised in Table 2 . Patients infected with HRV had dyspnea at presentation in 88.9%, higher than with other viruses. H3N2, Influenza A and HMPV tended to infect patients older than 60 years. Patients infected with H3N2 and H1N1 required mechanical ventilation in more than 50% of cases. Four out of 5 deaths in the study group had infection with the influenza (H3N2, H1N1, influenza B) viruses. Twenty percent of patients infected with the influenza group of viruses required mechanical ventilation compared with only 5% of patients with other viruses, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.02). Of 40 patients studied, 33 were started on antibiotics before the receipt of respiratory viral diagnostics. After the diagnosis of the viral infection, antibiotics were completely stopped in 10 (30.3%) patients and de-escalated to a narrower spectrum agent in another 10 (30.3%) patients. The remaining 13 patients (39.4%), all >55 years of age, were continued on original or escalated to broad spectrum antibiotics due to suspected or confirmed concomitant bacterial infections, 5 of these developed ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) and 1 had bacteremia due to unknown source. Seven out of these 13 patients were either organ transplant recipients or were getting immunosuppression. No patient whose antibiotics were de-escalated died, whereas there were 5 deaths in patients in whom de-escalation was not done (Table 3 ). Total 5 patients had VAP. Four out of 5 deaths were due to VAP and cause of death of the 5th patient could not be identified. All the 5 patients had some comorbidity (4 had DM and 1 was COPD).
