All of the participants were Saudi nationals. Medical students overall awareness of MERS based upon their responses to a questionnaire The questionnaire shown in Table 2 was used to measure the awareness of the students of MERS. General awareness of medical students regarding the important aspects of MERS, such as knowledge of basic science and virology, the mode of transmission, diagnosis, and the treatment and prevention of MERS. Overall, the majority of the students (88%) had heard of the disease before the outbreak in their hospital, with social media being the most common source of obtaining this information (55%). The majority of the students (97.1%) were able to state what MERS stands for. Regarding the students' knowledge of the new cases in August 2015 that were diagnosed globally, 50% of the students were unable to estimate the correct number of new cases. Regarding items assessing their knowledge of the basic sciences, only a minority of the students (14%) knew the genus to which the virus belonged. Also, only a small number of the students (21%) were aware of the basic structure of the virus. Overall, awareness in the basic sciences related to MERS was below the expected level. Regarding the clinical items, 74% of the students were aware that patients with the disease could be asymptomatic. Moreover, 75.7% of the students knew the correct incubation period of the virus. Additionally, 75% of the students reported that camels could be a possible primary host for MERS-CoV, while 13% of students thought that bats were the host of the virus. Regarding transmission of disease, 97.1% of the students believed that close contact with ill patients was the mode of transmission. In addition, 96.3% realized that cough, fever, chills, and shortness of breath were the typical symptoms of the infection. Among the respondents, 66% of students knew that real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of a respiratory specimen was used to diagnose MERS. Also, 61% of the students successfully answered that supportive treatment was the only treatment available for patients with MERS. On questions regarding preventive measures, all of the students knew that hand washing with an alcoholbased hand sanitizer, covering his/her mouth when coughing or sneezing, and avoiding close personal contact are the primary measures for preventing transmission. Also, 92% of the students were aware that vaccines were unavailable during the outbreak. However, only 24% of the students could identify the approximate mortality rate from the disease.
