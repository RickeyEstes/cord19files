In this study, there were 20 (62.50%) males and 12 (37.50%) females. The mean age was 43.99 ± 13.03 years. The main symptoms among the included patients were: fever (96.87%), cough (93.75%), dyspnea (90.62%), sore throat (75%), runny nose (75%), sputum (50%), headache (43.75%), myalgia (40.62%), chest pain (37.50%), hemoptysis (37.50%), nausea and vomiting (34.37%), abdominal pain (28.12%), abdominal pain (21.87%) and diarrhea (15.62%). The mean duration of symptoms before seeking medical advice was 5.30 ± 3.25 days (Table 1) . The chest radiological findings among the included patients were as follows: 8 (25%) normal chest radiology, 5 (15.63%) increased bronchovascular markings, 7 (21.87%) unilateral infiltrates, and 12 (37.50%) diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Pneumothorax occurred in 5 (15.63%) ventilated patients, for 3 of them it was unilateral and for other 2 patients bilateral ( Table 1) . Regarding the ABGs findings in our study: mean PH: 7.26 ± 0.33, mean PaO 2 : 64.04 ± 20.50 mmHg, mean O 2 saturation: 83.92 ± 17.45, mean PaCO 2 : 38.75 ± 4.17 mmHg, and mean HCO 3 19.44 ± 8.5 meq/L ( Table 1 ). The mean APACHE II score was 22.46 ± 4.01, the mean SOFA score was 7.15 ± 2.85 and mean CPIS was 8.03 ± 1.35 (Table 1) . Regarding the presence of co-morbidity, 21 (65.62%) patients out of the included 32 patients were associated with one or more co-morbidities and 11 (34.38%) patients were without co-morbidity ( Table 2) . All patients were admitted in ICU and a mean duration of ICU stay was 11.32 ± 4.50 days. Regarding mechanical ventilation need, there were 23 (71.87%) ventilated patients and 9 (28.13%) patients without mechanical ventilation. For ventilated patients the mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 6.21 ± 3.76 days. The mean total hospital stay was 15 ± 3.6 days ( Table 1) . According to the outcome of 32 patients included in this study, there were two groups: (1) The survivor group that included 18 patients (56.25%) with a mean age of 37.25 ± 15.50 years. (2) The expired group that included 14 patients (43.75%) with a mean age of 50.47 ± 13.80 years. There was a highly statistically significant (P < 0.01) difference between the expired group and the survivors regarding the duration of mechanical ventilation (expired: 9.64 ± 2.46, survivors: 3.55 ± 2.00), ICU stay (expired: 13.98 ± 3.50, survivors: 8.66 ± 2.40) and total hospital stay (expired: 17.50 ± 2.92, survivors: 13.06 ± 2.81) ( Table 2) . In this study, in spite of a statistically significant (P < 0.05) increase in occurrence of corona virus infection among males in comparison with females (62.50% males and 37.50% females), there was no statistically significant difference (P > 0.05) in the mortality among them (45% among males and 41.67% among females) (P > 0.05) ( Table 2) . Current smoking and smoking severity were statistically significantly (P < 0.01) higher in the expired group compared to the survivors. Non smoking and ex smoking were statistically significantly (P < 0.01) higher among survivors in comparison with the expired group. Also, there was a statistically (P < 0.05) significant positive correlation between mortality and smoking severity (r = 0.640) ( Table 2) . In this study, there were no statistically significant differences between the expired and survivors groups as regards fever, cough, dyspnea, runny nose, sore throat, chest pain, hemoptysis, myalgia or headache (P > 0.05), but there was a statistically significant increase in frequency of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea among the expired group than that among the survivors (P < 0.05). Also, there was a statistically significant increase in the duration of the symptoms before the hospitalization among the expired group than that among the survivors (P < 0.05) ( Table 2 ). There was a statistically significant (P < 0.05) positive correlation (r = 0.681) between mortality and prolonged duration of illness before hospitalization. Our study showed that most of the expired patients presented with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates or unilateral infiltrates, but most of the survivors presented with normal radiology or increased bronchovascular markings, and this difference in the results was statistically highly significant (P < 0.01) ( Table 2) . There were statistically highly significant (P < 0.01) differences in the mean values of APACHE II score (21.11 ± 3.70 vs 24.21 ± 3.82), SOFA score (5.83 ± 2.64 vs 8.85 ± 2.17) and Table 2) . This study found a statistically significant decrease in PH, PaO 2 , O 2 saturation and HCO 3 (P < 0.05) among the expired group in comparison with the survivors, but no statistical difference regarding PaCO 2 (P > 0.05) ( Table 2) . As regards the correlation between mortality and specific co-morbidities, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between mortality and old age (r = 0.633, smoking (r = 0.640), obesity (r = 0.712), diabetes mellitus (r = 0.685), renal failure (r = 0.705), chronic heart diseases (0.591), COPD (r = 0.523), malignancy (r = 0.692), kidney transplantation (r = 0.644) and liver cirrhosis (r = 0.525) (P < 0.05), (Table 3) . There was a statistical (P < 0.05) positive correlation between the number of associated comorbidities and mortality (r = 0.735).
