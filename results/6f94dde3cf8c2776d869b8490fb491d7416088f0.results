We identified 1538 patient-episodes (by 1413 patients), and successfully geocoded the residential addresses in 1320 of them. After exclusion of patient-episodes with residential locations without the Tai Po district, 1066 patient-episodes were eligible for analysis. Of these, 204 (19.1%) were from residential care homes for elderly (RCHE). Among the 1066 patient-episodes, 448 (42.0%) were febrile on presentation ( Figure 1 ). Younger patients, especially those aged less than 12 years, were more likely to present with fever (Table 1) . Two hundred and nine patients with fever were provisionally diagnosed to have infections at the emergency department (47.2% vs. 7.8% of patients with normal temperature). Table 2 summarizes the top 5 diagnoses in these 2 groups of patients. We identified 40 clusters (comprising 171 patient-episodes) during the study period. Most clusters contained 3 patients (23 clusters had 3 patients, 5 clusters had 4, 4 clusters had 5, 5 clusters had 6, 1 cluster had 7 and 2 clusters had 8; median cluster size: 3 patients). Twenty five clusters (62.5%) had two or more patients living in the same building block; of these, 18 (45.0%) had two or more patients living in the same RCHE. Clustered cases were of older age, and residents of RCHE were responsible for 33.3% of the cases (Table 1) . Spatiotemporal evolution of clusters was monitored and visualized graphically by the GIS (Figure 2 ), and they lasted for a median of 3 days (range: 2 -8 days). Subsequent analysis of the results on microbiological investigations revealed evidence of parainfluenza virus as a probable etiological cause in one cluster and respiratory syncytial virus in another; both clusters were associated with RCHE.
