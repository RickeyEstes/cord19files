ViReMa is a Python script that iteratively calls the small read alignment program, Bowtie (23) , to try and map all portions of a candidate read. The process used is similar to other recombination or fusion detection algorithms such as Tophat and Tophat-Fusion (24, 25) , FusionMap (26) or MapSplice (27) that split up a read into segments of a specific length, which are then mapped independently. However, ViReMa initially attempts to align the 5 0 end of a read to the reference genome(s) and then dynamically generates a new read segment by either extracting nucleotides at the 3 0 end of the read that fail to align or by trimming the first nucleotide from the read. This continues iteratively until all portions of the read are either mapped or trimmed or a combination of both as summarized in the flow diagram in Figure 1 . This process is illustrated step by step using an example read in Figure 2 . ViReMa is split into two phases. The first phase searches and reports recombinations found for each read of a given dataset. The second phase compiles these results into several output files based on the recombination events that they describe.
