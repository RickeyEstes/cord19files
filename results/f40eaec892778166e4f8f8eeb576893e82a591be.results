The estimated number of latently infected individuals by Jan 01, 2020 in Wuhan was 380.9 (95%-CI: 379.8~381.0). The estimated base population size of daily susceptible individuals was 2*106. The base reproductive number r0 of Wuhan and Hubei was set to 2.2 (95%-CI: 1.4~3.9) referring to the study of Liu, Q., et al [1] . When the interventions continue for 30 days, r0 was reduced to 1.58 (95%-CI: 1.34~2.07). In other provinces, the estimated average base reproductive number r0 was 2.52 (95%-CI: 2.43~2.63), and with 30-day interventions, r0 was reduced to 1.65 (95%-CI: 1.63~1.69). The estimated infectious period TI was 2.26 days (95%-CI: 2.14~2.39) in Wuhan and Hubei, and was 3.75 days (95%-CI: 3.43~4.13) in other provinces. The estimated mean latent was 10.1 days (95%-CI: 8.82~11.78) in Wuhan and Hubei, and was 11.01 days (95%-CI: 9.51~13.06) in other provinces. The estimated removed rate was 0.0125 (95%-CI: 0.008~0.017) in Wuhan, 0.0175 (95%-CI: 0.0126~0.0224) in .

Reasonably, earlier activating substantial social distancing at high-level (1*Î»0), which is the actual social distancing strength implemented in China, could lead to the best results. showed the estimated epidemic controlled with the current strategy (simultaneously activated nationwide social distancing and epicenter lockdown on Jan 23) for comparison. .
