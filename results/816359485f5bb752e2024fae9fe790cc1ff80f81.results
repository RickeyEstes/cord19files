Effects of parameter settings on capture of database structure fragments Numbers of positional hits (residues within spans) corresponding to each position along the poliovirus query . The regions of high variability were "locked" between regions of high specificity, which exhibited little or no change with the variation of win-dow_size. As window_size was increased, the numbers of positional hits tended to decrease in those regions for which window_size-dependent variability was observed. Comparison of positional hit variabilities to secondary structure ( Figure 3 , along x-axis) revealed that the window-related variability tended to occur in regions of helical secondary structure. A polymerase "baseline", amounting to fewer than 50 positional hits (corresponding primarily to polymerase structures) was observed along the entirety of the poliovirus chain ( Figure 3 xaxis). All polymerase baseline regions, with the exception of region 410-461, were identifiable independently of window_size. The latter C-terminal region showed high specificity at window size 90. In this region, lowering the window_size value to just 70 resulted in the capture of many (> 900) structure fragments that have apparent structural similarity to poliovirus RdRp ( Figure  3 , tall red peaks at right side of plot). The N-terminal region of the poliovirus protein yielded the least positional hits, indicating relative structural uniqueness in this region.
