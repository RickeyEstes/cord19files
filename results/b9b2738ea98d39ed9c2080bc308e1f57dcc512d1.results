As noted, 22 policymakers were interviewed. The broad categories of analysis that policymakers primarily referred to were challenges and operational problems encountered when responding to a pandemic influenza. As we discuss below, six themes from the analysis on PRPI were identified: governance and decision-making; coordination and advice; politics, science and policy; key infrastructure for PRPI; information, communication and education; and prevention, mitigation and containment. Responses arising from preparations and actions undertaken during the pandemic period included activating the pandemic plan and initiating influenza surveillance measures. They also included the deployment of generic infection control advice, and coordinating and communicating different response actions in order to maintain the routines and functions of civil society. As noted above, the MoH led the coordination and execution of the pandemic plan at the national level from early 2009 and activated it in April 2009, when the first cases of pandemic influenza were reported in Mexico and when its spread to other continents and countries became a growing global concern. An influenza working group within the MoH coordinated the development of the country's plan and actions to address the pandemic. Response activities were supported by implementing agencies with different roles ( Table 1 ). The development of the Malawi country plan was guided by the WHO PRPI strategy, based on pandemic phases and the conceptual framework of public health functions including communication, surveillance, logistics, detection and response, and containment. The WHO recommended that member states consider a six tier inventory of pandemic phases when developing or updating the national planan inter-pandemic period (Phase 1 and 2), pandemic alert period (Phases 3, 4 and 5) and pandemic period (Phase 6)in the context of countryspecific needs, priorities and actions. Malawi made some country-specific modifications to the WHO PRPI strategy and reduced the WHO six-tier inventory of pandemic phases to three tiers: alert, serious and emergency (Table 2) . These three-tier response levels were based on different risks and predicted a course that might be taken in the event of an avian influenza pandemic. The three tiers, according to the research participants, eased communication with the general public, but the typology was considered irrelevant by some participants because its main focus was on avian influenza to the neglect of other types of influenza. As a result, participants were not clear how they might have used this framework in the context of the influenza outbreak spreading in humans. Table 3 provides a summary of the themes and recommendations.
