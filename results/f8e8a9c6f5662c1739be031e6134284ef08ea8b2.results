As a first proof of concept for detecting ZIKV, we designed DNA nanoswitches to target an already validated sequence in the ZIKV genome that has been used to bind primers in qPCR 28 (note: all oligo sequences are specified in Tables S1 to S9). We made the DNA nanoswitches by hybridizing singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) oligos to linearized single-stranded M13mp18 (M13) genomic DNA in a thermal annealing ramp for 1 hour 24 and then purified them by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 29 For our initial detection target, we in vitro transcribed RNA from the pFLZIKV infectious plasmid containing the full length genome of the Cambodia ZIKV isolate (FSS13025) (Fig. S1 ). 30 Previous results have shown robust nanoswitch detection of small DNA and RNA sequences (20-30 nucleotides) , however, the strong secondaty structures present in long viral RNA was expected to interfere with our detection. 31, 32 To overcome this, we used a chemical fragmentation method to segment the RNA into small pieces that are mostly shorter than 200 nt ( Fig. 1B-C and S2 ). By incubating with our nanoswitch in an annealing temperature ramp, we showed successful detection of the fragmented viral RNAs by gel electrophoresis, thus validating our approach (Fig. 1D) . Having shown successful detection of ZIKV RNA using a single target sequence, we recognized that we could exploit the large genome size (~11,000 nucleotides) to increase our detection signal through multiple targets. Once the long viral RNA is fragmented, the number of available target sequences increases dramatically. Since our detection signal is proportional to the number of looped nanoswitches, a nanoswitch mixture for different target sequences within the viral genome is expected to provide an increased signal. To test this, we developed an algorithm for choosing multiple sequence regions in the viral genome that can be targeted by the nanoswitches (Note S1). First, we chose the default target length as 30 nucleotides based on results from screening nanoswitches with different detection arm lengths (Fig.  S3) . Then, the algorithm selectively excluded target sequences that could form stable secondary structures (Fig. S4 ) and cross-binding with nanoswitch backbone oligos (Fig. S5) , and enforced GC content and uniqueness of sequences. Based on these criteria, we chose 18 target regions along the entire ZIKV RNA for testing and designed the nanoswitches. To facilitate use of our Matlab-based software, we have built a graphical user interface (Fig. S6 ) and made it freely available (File S1). We then validated quality and function of each nanoswitch in the panel of 18 nanoswitches. All nanoswitches performed well with a molar excess of positive DNA controls, although they showed more signal variation with fragmented ZIKV RNA (Fig. S7) . We ranked the nanoswitches from strongest to weakest signal and made a series of equimolar nanoswitch mixtures. Using these mixtures, we validated our inherent signal multiplication strategy using a low concentration pool of equimolar DNA fragments to mimic the fragmented RNA. We observed that our detection signal increased steadily up to around 12 nanoswitches (Fig. 1E, F) , and then plateaued above that value. This plateau was not unexpected considering that the largest mixtures added lower performing nanoswitches that may contribute less to the overall sample. Since there was no significant change in performance between 12 and 18, we continued with using the 18 nanoswitches mix for our follow up experiments. High sensitivity is one of the key requirements for viral detection. Clinical levels of ZIKV RNA in body fluids of infected patients are often in the femtomolar range, 7,21,33 making amplification a prerequisite for most detection approaches. Based on our earlier observation that DNA nanoswitches can detect microRNAs (~22 nucleotides) at the sub-picomolar scale 27 without amplification, we wanted to assess the sensitivity of our approach for ZIKV RNA detection. We reacted the DNA nanoswitch mixture with different amounts of fragmented RNA in a 12-hour annealing temperature ramp from 40 °C to 25 °C. The results showed visible detection for ZIKV RNA as low as 12.5 pg (~3.5 attomole) ( Fig. 1G and S8 ) in a 10 µL reaction volume. Consistent with Fig. 1F , the approach based on using a nanoswitch mix outperformed the highest performing nanoswitch used as a single agent, which had visible detection to about 50 pg (~14 attomole) (Fig. S9) . Another key requirement for a clinical viral detection assay is specificity. Since ZIKV and Dengue virus (DENV) have overlapping geographical distributions and clinical symptoms, infection with either virus may result in clinical misdiagnosis. 34 Serological diagnostic assays are known to show antibody crossreactivity between the two viruses, and DENV has some similarity to ZIKV in its envelope protein 12 and genome sequence. 21, 31 To test the specificity of our approach, we designed a similar panel of nanoswitches to detect DENV (Fig. S10) . Using the pooled nanoswitches specific for ZIKV and DENV, we mixed each set with in vitro transcribed RNA from each virus and found perfect specificity, with each assay only detecting its correct target RNA ( Fig. 2A) . Using the programmability of the nanoswitch, we further demonstrated a multiplexed system for simultaneous detection of ZIKV and DENV. In this case we modified the DENV responsive nanoswitches to form a smaller loop size (Fig. S11) , causing two distinct detection bands to migrate to different positions in the gel. Specifically, ZIKV RNA-nanoswitch complex migrated slower/higher in the gel, while the complex of DENV RNA and the nanoswitch migrated faster/lower in the gel (Fig. 2B) . Therefore, in a single reaction our nanoswitch showed differential and specific detection of ZIKV and DENV RNA. By programming different loop sizes for different targets, this assay can be expanded for up to five viral targets. 27 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . In addition to possible misdiagnosis between different viruses, there is an additional challenge in determining the specific strain of a virus. For example, in Latin America four different DENV serotypes are known to be present and co-circulate, where misdiagnosis of the infecting strain can have significant implications for treatment options. 35 Thus being able to accurately identify a circulating strain of virus broadly impacts medical care, surveillance and vector control. 36 ZIKV was first identified in Uganda in 1947 before spreading to Asia and the Americas, and ZIKV strains (classified within African or Asian lineage) share significant sequence homology. 37 To investigate if our assay can distinguish between the Asian and African lineages, we tested our nanoswitches against two ZIKV strains which have a ~89% sequence homology, namely the FSS13025 isolated from Cambodia and the MR766 strain isolated from Uganda. In designing the ZIKV strain-specific nanoswitches, we identified five target regions that each have a 5-6 nucleotide difference ( Fig. 2C and S12) . To achieve better discernment of the detection signal, the nanoswitches for the Uganda strain were designed to form a smaller loop-size than those designed for Cambodia. Next, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Huh7) was infected with either the Cambodian or Ugandan ZIKV strain. Infected cells were processed to extract total RNA, which was then fragmented and incubated with nanoswitches to probe for viral RNA from either the ZIKV Cambodia or ZIKV Uganda infected cells. The results showed that our assay was able to discriminate between two strains of the same virus even with high genetic similarities (Fig. 2D, S12) . Further applying our technique to detect ZIKV RNA in biological samples, we either mock-infected or infected Huh7 cells with the Cambodia ZIKV strain at a multiplicity of infection of 1 and extracted RNA from the ZIKV infected cells at 1-, 2-and 3-days post-infection. 38 The nanoswitch assay detected ZIKV viral RNA from the infected cells but not the mock infected cells (Figs. 3A, 3B & S13 ). Our detection result shows that the copies of ZIKV RNA within infected cells steadily increased upon the infection and plateaued at 2-and 3-days post-infection (Fig. 3C) . These data demonstrate that our assay can detect ZIKV RNA in infected cell lines, and in contrast to typical RT-PCR assays without amplification of the viral RNA. Moving toward clinical applications, we aimed to demonstrate detection of relevant levels of ZIKV RNA from biological fluids. ZIKV is present in the serum, urine, and other body fluids of infected patients. 39 The viral loads can vary dramatically between individuals, body fluid, and post infection time, 6, 7 but are frequently in the subfemtomolar to femtomolar range, with ZIKV in human urine reported as high as 220 × 10 6 copies/ml (365 fM). 33 While our nanoswitch sensitivity for in vitro transcribed viral RNA in buffer approaches clinically relevant concentrations, detection from body fluids is further challenged by varying viral loads and by body fluids that can reduce the performance of the nanoswitches due to physiological conditions and nuclease activity. 26, 40 To overcome these potential difficulties, we investigated two independent solutions: 1) adding a preprocessing step to extract RNA from body fluids such as urine, or 2) adding an isothermal pre-amplification step. In the first approach, we spiked a clinically-relevant amount of in vitro transcribed ZIKV RNA into human urine and processed viral RNA extraction using a commercial RNA extraction kit. We then mixed the extracted RNA with the nanoswitches and demonstrated non-enzymatic, clinical level detection of the RNA at 0.28 pM (Fig. 4A-B & S14) . In the second approach, we demonstrated that our detection can be coupled with other amplification approaches such as nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA). 41,42 NASBA combines multiple enzymes and primers to achieve RNA amplification in a one-pot isothermal reaction (Fig. S15A) . First, we showed feasibility of the amplification of ZIKV RNA by NASBA in water, followed by nanoswitch detection (Fig. S15) . To mimic clinical samples, we spiked infectious ZIKV particles into either PBS or 10% human urine at clinical-levels (1.49 fM to 0.03 fM). From these samples our assay detected ZIKV RNA in ~5 hours (Fig. 4C-E and S15) . We went one step further and showed that our assay can be performed using a commercially available bufferless gel cartridge (ThermoFisher E-gel) and imaged on a small and potentially portable gel reader (Fig. S16) . With the help of NASBA amplification, the detection ability of our method has about 10,000-fold increase, from ~350 fM (Fig. 1G) to 0.03 fM (Fig.  4D , E) and the detection time was reduced from ~13 hours to ~5 hours (Fig. S17) . Taken together, we demonstrate that programmable DNA nanoswitches can be developed into a robust viral RNA detection platform. The platform has key advantages over existing methodologies in terms of selectivity and specificity, as shown in our experiments with ZIKV and closely related DENV, as well as two closely related ZIKV strains. Moreover, DNA nanoswitch viral RNA detection strategy has femtomolar detection limit without an RNA amplification step, and attomolar detection limit when used with amplification. These limits are within a clinically relevant range and therefore our DNA nanoswitch assay together with the bufferless gel cartridge presents a putative diagnostic assay for clinical detection of ZIKV in low resource areas without significant laboratory infrastructure.
