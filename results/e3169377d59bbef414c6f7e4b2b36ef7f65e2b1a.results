In addition to the database searches, information was available through a total of 61 completed questionnaires, ranging from 4 to 17 per country, and additional contacts through professional networks. The number of peer-reviewed publications on zoonotic  diseases associated with each country identified through  the WoS searches for the period 1996 and 2016 is shown in  Table 1 . The publications were not checked to exclude duplicates and remove papers that did not relate to the disease and country in the search terms, and hence, these numbers over-estimate the actual number of publications. However, given similar errors occur across all search terms, the relativity of the numbers is likely to be reasonably accurate. India is clearly associated with the greatest number of zoonotic disease publications, with fewest from the Maldives. The highest number of publications was associated with visceral leishmaniasis and the lowest number with Q fever.
