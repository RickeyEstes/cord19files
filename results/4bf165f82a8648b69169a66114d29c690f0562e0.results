Independent t-tests comparing the participants to those lost to follow-up revealed that the latter group was significantly older. Although there were no significant differences between the self-reported physical function between these groups, the non-participants exhibited worse function in terms of the performance measures; with respect to the ST and possibly the 6 MWT, p < 0.057 (Table 2) . Of the 152 subjects who participated, 69 underwent THA and 83 TKA. Seventy-five of the subjects were women with 44 of these undergoing TKA and 31, THA. In terms of postoperative complications, 2 patients required blood transfusions, 3 developed urinary tract infections, one developed ileus and one patient within the TKA group had a documented deep vein thrombosis. The patients undergoing TKA were significantly older and had a greater body mass index (Table 1) . No significant differences were noted in their baseline function with respect to the five measures. All participants completed baseline preoperative assessments and had a minimum of at least one assessment during the 4 month postoperative period with 51%, 26% and 6% assessed 2, 3 and 4 times respectively. At discharge from hospital, 33% of the subjects were unable to complete the 6 MWT and 26.0% the ST, compared to only 3% who could not complete the TUG. An independent t-test revealed no significant difference (p = 0.181) between the baseline scores of the individuals who completed the 6 MWT versus those who did not, however, this was not the case with the ST. Individuals who completed the ST at discharge were significantly faster (p = 0.048) at baseline than those not completing it at the discharge assessment point. In each of the Figures (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) , the graphs were constructed from the measure scores predicted by each of the final developed models. The preoperative mean of each of the measures was plotted as a horizontal line to assist in referencing recovery. Lower scores represent improvement for the WOMAC PF scores, the TUG and the ST with the reverse orientation for the 6 MWT and LEFS. As can be seen in each of the figures, the slopes of recovery were greater with significant change happening in the first 6 to 9 weeks for each of the measures. Different patterns of recovery, however, were observed between the self-report measures of physical function and the performance measures. Patients achieved their mean preoperative WOMAC PF scores by 1-2 weeks and their mean LEFS preoperative scores around 3 weeks. In contrast, patients generally met their mean preoperative scores for the performance measures later between 6 weeks and just over 9 weeks. The performance measure graphs all demonstrated differences in the recovery pattern for THA and TKA. In each of these models, site of arthroplasty was a significant predictor of the one week scores with the patients post TKA initially demonstrating higher function. However, a significant interaction (in Figures 1, 2, 3 , demonstrated at the point at which the lines cross) was observed between the rate of change, weeks after surgery and site of arthroplasty with the patients post THA surpassing the function of the patients post TKA between 9 to 11 weeks. Figure 2 also demonstrates a ceiling effect (lower scores are better) for the TUG measure around nine to ten weeks. Unlike the performance measures, similar patterns of recovery are observed for the participants post THA and TKA with respect to the recovery figures for the WOMAC physical function scores ( Figure 4 ) and the LEFS ( Figure 5) . Table 3 provides a summary of the significant fixed effects and random effects for the models with specific model Tables 4 and 5 . A more detailed examination of the findings with respect to the predictor variables is published elsewhere [39] . In most models, the only significant random effect was the intercept indicating that individuals varied in their starting points one week after surgery; however, their slopes and quadratic component of time were similar. The LEFS model was the exception with both the intercept and slope significant. To understand how the standard deviations of the intercepts give an indication of between-patient differences in functioning, consider the results for the 6 MWT reported in To further clarify the interpretation of the interaction terms as estimates of the effects of the predictors on the amount of change over time, one can refer to the estimates in Table 4 . The estimate for the interaction of weeks after surgery with baseline 6 MWT score is .036 indicating that each increase of 1 meter in baseline score, predicts more positive recovery of .036 meters per week. Therefore, if an individual had a baseline score which exceeded another by 100 meters, this would translate into 36 more meters at 10 weeks postoperatively. In the five models, slowing in the recovery trajectory occurred over time and in all models, a second-degree polynomial growth term (quadraticweeks squared) provided a reasonable fit for the data over the study interval.
