This study revealed a great diversity of coronaviruses in bats in the Western Palearctic ( Fig. 1 ; cf. Table S1 for GenBank accession numbers). New coronaviruses were detected in France, Spain, Tunisia and Morocco (Fig. 2) . Among the 1551 samples tested, 212 (13.6%) were found positive for coronavirus, representing 10/26 (42%) species of bats and 20/39 (51%) of localities (Table 1) . When considering species sampled at a given site with significant sampling size (n > 30), the prevalence ranged from 8.8% (i.e. Alphacoronavirus EPI4 in Myotis nattereri in LF5, Pont-château, Loire Atlantique, France) to 37.9% (i.e. Betacoronavirus EPI1 in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in LF6, Cantoin, Aveyron, France). Identity to known coronaviruses ranged from 85% to 99% according to 393 nucleotides of the conserved nsp12 gene (Fig. 2B ). Six alphacoronaviruses were found to have their closest Sequencing of this coronavirus nsp12 gene didn't provide signal of sufficient quality to characterize the species. described relative in Europe (in Bulgaria, Spain or Germany) whereas five were more closely related to Asian coronaviruses previously reported from China and Hong Kong S.A.R. (Fig. 2 A/B ) (Woo et al., 2006; Drexler et al., 2010; Falcón et al., 2011; Gloza-Rausch et al., 2008) . Alphacoronaviruses were predominantly detected in Myotis species (Vespertillionidae) while betacoronaviruses were associated with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum only (Rhinolophidae) (Table 1, Fig. 2 ). Phylogenetic analyses show no major contradiction between virus-host association found here and in literature (Wacharapluesadee et al., 2015; Woo et al., 2006; Drexler et al., 2010) . The 121 partial nsp12 sequences analysed represent at least nine Alphacoronavirus species (44% pairwise nucleotide identity or less) and one putative new species of Betacoronavirus (Betacoronavirus EPI1 -"EPI" stands for EPICOREM, the acronym of the name of the project in which this study was hosted). This putative new species of Betacoronavirus has less than 83% pairwise nucleotidic identity to the closest reference and exhibits an intraspecific genetic diversity (i.e. Strains - Fig. S2) . Notably, this Betacoronavirus EPI1 grouped with the SARS-CoV sister-clade and was detected in Rhinolophus ferrumequinum only, but repeatedly in different colonies from western Brittany to north-eastern Spain (i.e. LF6, LF9, LS7, LS11; Fig. 2 , Table 1 ). Notably, no MERS-CoV-like virus was detected in this study. Among nine alphacoronaviruses reported here, mainly in Vespertilionidae and Miniopteridae bats, two species, tentatively named Alphacoronavirus EPI4 and Alphacoronavirus EPI7 were also detected in multiple species, including in Rhinolophidae (Fig. 2 (Gouilh et al., 2011; Drexler et al., 2010) .
