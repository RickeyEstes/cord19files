This study included 146 patients randomly distributed into two groups (placebo and treatment) of 73 patients each (Figure 1 ). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the study sample. The groups were homogeneous except for weight, which was greater in the treatment group. Mean (±SD) time between V1 and V2 was 72.9 (±10.5) hours, with no significant between-group differences (p = 0.919).
