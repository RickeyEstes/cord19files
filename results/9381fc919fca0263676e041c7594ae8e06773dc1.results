Cloning and sequencing of the gene 3' proximal to the F gene In order to identify the gene upstream (3' proximal) from the F gene, an F gene-specific oligonucleotide was used to generate cDNA from poly(A)+-infected cell RNA, and clones were selected using a radiolabeled F gene restriction fragment. This strategy was based on the knowledge, gained from probing Northern blots of infected cell RNA with F gene-specific probes, that polycistronic mRNAs were generated during transcription ( Fig. 1 , lanes 3 and 5) and the hope that some of these mRNAs contained F and the upstream gene. Six clones were obtained, two of which did not extend beyond the 5' terminus of the F mRNA. The remaining four clones did extend into the 3' proximal gene; indeed two of them continued into a furthergene (Fig. 2) . Unexpectedly one clone (MF35) extended 622 nucleotides FIG. 1. Northern blots showing mono-and polycistronic TRTV mRNAs containtng M and F gene seque-Ices. RNA was extracted from TRTV-Infected (lanes 3. 5, 7, and 9) a Id mock-infected (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) Vero cells and electrophoresed in a denaturing agarose gel before (lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7) and after (lanes 4, 5, 8, and 9) poly(A)+ selection. The poly(A)+-selected RNA migrated slightly faster than the nonselected RNA. After transfer to nitrocellulose the RNAs were probed with a TRTV F-specific (lanes 2-5) and M-specific (lanes 6-9) DNA probe. Lane 1 contains IBV mRNAs, the sizes (kilobases) of which are shown on the left. The monocistronic M and F mRNAs are identified by M and F, respectively, and dicrstronic M-F mRNA by MF. The positions of other polycistronic mRNAs and genome-sized RNA are shown by filled circles, beyond the primer in the direction of the 5'end of the F gene, to nucleotide position 1170 in the F gene sequence (Vu et a/., 1991). Every nucleotide of the gene 3' proximal to F was sequenced from at least two clones; 83% were sequenced from three clones. The entire sequence was determined from both strands of the cDNA and 96% of nucleotides were determined 5 to 16 times and the remaining 4% on 3 or 4 occasions. The M gene is adjacent to the 3' end of the F gene of TRTV As described above the identity of the gene sequences contained within each clone was ascertained by sequencing. Clones MF35 and 36 encoded a large ORF of 254 amino acids. The next longest ORF would encode an ORF of only 51 residues, other ORFs being less than half that size. Comparison of the sequence of the longest ORF with a databank of Paramyxoviridae sequences revealed that it had 37% amino acid identity with the M protein of RS virus which comprises 256 residues (Fig. 3) . The calculated molecular weights of the M protein for TRTV and RS virus were 27,595 and 28,7 14, respectively. Almost immediately upstream from the beginning of the ORF was the sequence GGGACAAGU (nucleotides l-9, doubly underlined in Fig. 3 ) which was identical to the sequence just upstream from the F ORF (nucleotides 827-835, doubly underlined in Fig. 3 ) which we have suggested is the start sequence for the F mRNA (Vu et al., 1991) . Confirmation that these sequences did mark the beginnings of the M and F mRNAs was obtained by mapping the 5' end of the respective mRNAs. Gene-specific oligonucleotides were 5' endlabeled and then used for primer extension. Both the M and the F primer-extended products terminated to yield a double band, consistent with the ends of the respective mRNAs having been reached (Fig. 4) . The same end-labeled oligonucleotides were used in sequencing reactions, with [35S]ATP present, with pBluescript containing either the M or the F cDNA inserts. Electrophoresis of the reaction products in the same gels as those used for analysis of the cDNA generated by primer extension showed that the lower band of the doublet comigrated with a G residue which was the beginning of the sequence GGGACAAGU. This was direct evidence that nucleotides l-9 and 827-835 (Fig. 3) marked the beginning of the M and F mRNAs, respectively. The upper band of the doublet, which was sometimes of lower intensity, was considered most likely to be an artifact, as proposed previously (Jorgensen et al., 1987) . The presence of partial cross-banding in the pBluescript-generated sequence was a consequence of the presence of some n -1 oligonucleotide in the primer preparations. At the end of the TRTV F mRNA is the sequence AGUUA followed three nucleotides later by the poly(A) tail (Vu et a/., 1991). Immediately prior to the start of the F gene, i.e., near the end of the M sequence, was the similar sequence AGUCA (nucleotides 8 12 to 8 16, singly underlined, in Fig. 3 ) followed two nucleotides later by AIWWAUU. This observation, coupled with the identification of the 5'terminus of the F mRNA (Fig. 4B) , indicates that these sequences mark the end of the M mRNA, the UU residues being the M-F intergenic region (in the mRNA sense). Thus nucleotides 1 and 824 in Fig. 3 define the termini of the TRTV M mRNA.
