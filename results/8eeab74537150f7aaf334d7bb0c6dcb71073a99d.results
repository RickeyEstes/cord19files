Ultimately, 7 of 10 inpatients on the oncology ward were diagnosed with influenza A H3 by FilmArray RP 1.0 (attack rate of 70%). The last diagnosis of influenza A in an inpatient was on November 19, 2017. Unfortunately, an attack rate among the staff cannot be reliably calculated, because the exact number of all exposed HCWs in this outbreak is difficult to quantify owing to the frequency of visits from outside personnel (ie, pharmacists, social workers, chaplains, and consultants). Identification of influenza cases in HCWs who work in various locations throughout the hospital resulted in an exponential number of staff with potential exposure (ie, office mates and outpatient clinic staff), all of whom could not be accurately accounted for. Prophylactic oseltamivir was prescribed to 108 persons during the outbreak period, which we suspect exceeds the number of truly exposed persons, but also reflects the diversity of the staff involved. However, we were able to confirm 39 nurses were assigned to the ward between the dates of November 14, 2017 and November 27, 2017 (2 days prior to the first inpatient case through the end of the outbreak). The attack rate for nurses specifically was 8 of 39 or 21%. Of the 50 HCWs for whom symptom data are available and exposure was confirmed, 16 of 50 (32%) tested positive for influenza (14 confirmed and 2 probable), 7 of 50 (14%) tested positive for an alternative organism by FilmArray RP 1.0 (6 rhinovirus/enterovirus and 1 coronavirus), and 26 of 50 (52%) tested negative for any organism (24 by FilmArray RP 1.0 and 2 self-reported by unknown tests). One of the symptomatic staff declined testing. In addition, 2 patient visitors (both spouses of influenza inpatients) were confirmed to be infected with influenza A H3 by FilmArray RP 1.0. These are the only 2 visitors for whom symptoms were self-reported during the outbreak period. Word of the outbreak spread quickly, and numerous symptomatic and asymptomatic staff with questionable exposures presented to request evaluation or testing. We suspect that inappropriate testing may have been performed on some HCWs who were asymptomatic (or did not quite meet the criteria for exposure or for ILI) due in large part to a fear of the outbreak. Although 50 symptomatic staff with confirmed exposure are described above, the total number of FilmArray panels performed at our institution during the outbreak period far exceeded this number at 101. Of the 16 HCWs diagnosed with influenza, there were 8 nurses, 3 physicians, 1 corpsman (ie, medical technician), 1 pharmacist, 1 chaplain, 1 social worker, and 1 stem cell transplant coordinator. Of these HCWs, 14 completed the anonymous survey (13 with confirmed influenza, 1 with probable disease). The HCWs were all healthy and immunocompetent, although 1 was 11 weeks pregnant. The average duration of illness in the HCWs was 7.5 days, ranging from 3-15 days. The most frequently reported symptom was sore throat (in 12 of 14), followed by cough and myalgias (both in 11 of 14). Notably, fever was reported in only 50% of the HCWs (7 of 14 respondents). Of the responses we received from the surveyed staff, 64% (9 of 14) continued to work despite feeling ill. The reasons for working included sense of duty, viewing illness as too minor to impose risk to others, and desire not to incur repercussions from leadership or coworkers. No one reported coming to work ill owing to a desire to not consume sick leave or issues with pay (Table 1) . Of note, influenza was not the only respiratory virus brought into the ward by the HCWs, as 6 tested positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus and 1 tested positive for coronavirus. Because most patients and staff were tested within a 3-day span, our epidemiologic curve was based on reported or documented start of symptoms. This curve demonstrates there was an ill staff member who was symptomatic while working on the floor prior to the first ill patient. He was also working on the ward for 2 days preceding his symptom onset, suggesting this HCW may have been the index case (Fig 1) . Most staff reported onset of symptoms prior to identification of an outbreak on November 19, 2017, which further supports HCW contribution to nosocomial spread. The suspected index case HCW had the longest duration of illness at 15 days, which has been shown to correlate with infectivity. 16, 17 No adverse outcomes from influenza illness were noted. One inpatient who tested positive for influenza A H3 died owing to his underlying end-stage malignancy. Death was imminent in this patient prior to his diagnosis of influenza, and testing was performed for outbreak investigation purposes alone. The remainder of the patients, staff, and family members recovered uneventfully. Additionally, no exposed HCW or visitor who was placed on prophylaxis with oseltamivir developed ILI, although surveillance was limited to self-reporting after the outbreak period.
