The initial volumes of tumours were 416 F 382 mm 3 . The difference (percentage) between the tumour volume initially and after 0, 7 and 14 days post treatment, respectively, were assessed by means of comparing the mean difference for each treatment group, divided with the initially determined tumour volume. Hence, the variation in initial tumour volume, between groups, could be neglected (Fig. 2) . After the EChT was supplied to tumours, it was observed that the volumes initially decreased at the anode and increased at the cathode when compared with the control. Only one rat went into complete remission (Anode 10 C, 7d). The tumour sloughed off 4 days after EChT. In the rest a significant decrease (both anode and cathode) in tumour progression compared to untreated control was achieved. Significant tumour responses were found in the anode 10 C 14d and 20 C 14d, when compared to the corresponding cathodic treatments as well as the controls.
