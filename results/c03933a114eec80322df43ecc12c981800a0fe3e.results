Yeast two-hybrid analysis shows N protein homotypic interaction The yeast system was initially chosen because it is one of the most common systems for analysis of protein-protein interactions in vivo. The full-length SARS-CoV N protein was cloned in-frame into both the pGBKT7 (pGBK-N) and pGADT7 (pGAD-N) yeast two-hybrid vectors to investigate N protein self-interaction. Upon co-transformation of both plasmid constructs into Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109, a phenotype was observed on high stringency nutrition drop-out plates lacking adenine, histidine, leucine, and tryptophan, indicating the presence of N protein homotypic interaction (Fig. 1) . Clearly, controls with empty plasmids and co-transformation of pGBK-M and pGAD-M, which carry SARS-CoV membrane protein, did not demonstrate cell growth, further suggesting that the presence of SARS-CoV N-N self-interaction was specific in the yeast.
