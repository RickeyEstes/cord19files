Between April 1, and June 30, 2013, we obtained 5765 serum samples from local primary health-care The mean sample size per province was 770 (range 321 to 2343 [SD 585]), representing between 19·7 and 97·1 samples per 100 000 individuals per province (mean 52·9, SD 26·7). The age distribution of samples with available age information matched that of the population of Saudi Arabia (fi gure 1). Of the 8719 individuals with available demographic information, 4341 (50%) were male. All serum samples from the general population were fi rst screened for MERS-CoV-specifi c IgG by rELISA, yielding reactive results in 152 (1·52%, 95% CI 1·29-1·78) of 10 009 samples. Subsequent testing by rIFA and PRNT 50 confi rmed less than 0·2% to be stage 1 and stage 2 seropositive (table 1; appendix). Because repeat samples were missing, the timepoint of seroconversion was established by IgM detection. Coronavirus IgM had been previously shown to be maintained for a maximum of 180 days after infection. 22 Only one of 15 seropositive individuals had a reciprocal MERS-CoV IgM titre of at least 100, suggesting recent seroconversion (appendix). In accordance with our previous study, 12 seropositivity with rELISA was ten times higher than with rIFA. Seroprevalence did not diff er between the two subcohorts (seven [0·16%] of 4244 patients in the primary healthcare study group vs eight [0·14%] of 5765 in the burden of disease study cohort group, p=0·94; appendix). Men had a higher proportion of infections (11 [0·25%] of 4341) than did women (two [0·05%] of 4378; p=0·025). Cases were identifi ed in four of six age groups without signifi cant age preference (appendix). Confi rmed cases of MERS-CoV infection were identifi ed in six of the 13 administrative provinces of Saudi Arabia, with higher numbers in central provinces that generally are more rural (fi gure 2). The 13 provinces were classifi ed into seven central and six coastal provinces, on the basis of whether they had a shoreline. Signifi cantly more confi rmed infections were in central provinces (14 [0·26%] of 5479 samples) than in coastal provinces (one [0·02%] of 4529; p=0·003). Data are n (%; 95% CI) from a serosurvey, unless otherwise specifi ed. p values refer to comparison with the general population cohort (χ² test with Yates correction two-tail test; OpenEpi). rELISA=recombinant ELISA. NA=not applicable. The proportion of both camel shepherds and slaughterhouse workers who were seropositive was signifi cantly higher than in the general population (table 1) . Seropositive individuals were identifi ed in fi ve of six age groups with even distribution (appendix).
