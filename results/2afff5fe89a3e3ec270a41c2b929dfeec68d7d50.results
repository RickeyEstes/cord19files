Figures 1A,B show the mean and SD of the time from illness onset to reporting and death, respectively. Employing the gamma distribution, the mean time from illness onset to reporting was estimated at 7.1 days (95% CI: 5.9, 8.4). The mean time from illness onset to death-adopted from a previous study [14] -was estimated at 20.2 days (95% CI: 15.1, 29.5), which led to the lognormal distribution with location parameter of 2.84 and scale parameter of 0.52. .
