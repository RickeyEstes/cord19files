To determine the optimal dose of SP, preliminary experiments were conducted in which minced von Ebner's glands were incubated with 0.01 (n Å 1), 0.1 (n Å 3), 1.0 (n Å 3), 10 (n Å 3), and 100 (n Å 1) mM SP. The percentage secretion was determined at 15, 30, and 60 min. Figure 1 shows the dose response curve at 60 min expressed as percentage secretion above basal. Very little or no secretion was evoked by 0.01 mM, somewhat more by 0.1 mM, and the maximal secretion by 1 mM SP. The percentage secretion evoked by 10 mM was almost the same as by 1 mM, and 100 mM evoked very little secretion. The curves in Fig. 1 show that the percentage secretion above basal for lingual lipase tends to be greater than for amylase, except for the 100 mM dose. Statistical analyses were not performed on these preliminary data. Figure 2 shows the basal secretion of lingual lipase and amylase that occurred when minced tissue was incubated in DMEM for 15, 30, and 60 min. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the percentage basal secretion of lingual lipase was significantly lower than the percentage basal secretion of amylase, p Å 0.0001, n Å 43. The time courses of lingual lipase and amylase basal secretion were significantly different from each other, p Å 0.0102. Secretion of both enzymes significantly increased with time, p Å 0.0001. The nature of the difference between the time courses was analyzed using orthogonal polynomial contrasts. The two enzymes did not differ in the linear component of their time course, p Å 0.91131. There was a significant difference in the quadratic component or curvature, p Å 0.0001. An examination of the graph shows that by 15 min basal amylase secretion was much greater than basal lipase secretion. The slope of the curve for amylase secretion decreased between 30 and 60 min, but the slope of the lipase curve remained constant. SP-elicited secretion of lingual lipase and amylase is shown in Fig. 3 . The percentage secretion of both enzymes increased with time. The slopes of both curves decreased with time, but the decrease in the slope of the amylase curve was greater. This observation was confirmed by statistical evaluation. The quadratic components of the time courses of the two enzymes were statistically different, p Å 0.0001, while the linear components were not. The differences between the two enzymes were significant only at 60 min, p Å 0.003. The 15, 30, and 60 min values for percentage secretion of lingual lipase and amylase were all statistically different from zero, p Å 0.0001. The maximum percentage secretion above basal of lingual lipase was 12.14 { 0.90 and for amylase, 8.30 { 0.42, n Å 39. The mechanism of stimulation of secretion by SP was investigated by preincubating the tissue with the following SP receptor antagonists: the SP analogs, D- Figures 4 -6 show the results of treating the tissue with the SP analogs that are known to be SP receptor antagonists ( 26 ) . One mM Ia ( Fig. 4 ) had no significant effect on enzyme secretion when incubated with the tissue alone. When combined with SP, 1 mM Ia did not have any effect on SP-evoked enzyme secretion. Neither 1 mM Ib ( Fig. 5 ) nor 1 or 10 mM Ic ( Fig. 6 ) had statistically significant effects on secretion evoked by SP. However, 1 mM Ib, when incubated with the tissue ( Fig. 5 ) stimulated secretion of amylase at all time intervals, p õ 0.05. One mM Ic alone stimulated secretion of amylase at 30 and 60 min, p õ 0.05, but 10 mM Ic alone did not significantly stimulate secretion of either enzyme. In preliminary experiments, inhibition of SP-evoked stimulation was not observed using 0.1, 5.0, and 10 mM Ia and 5 mM Ib ( data not shown ) . CP-96,345 is an inhibitor of SP receptors that is not a peptide or an analog of SP (45) . Figure 7A shows the results of seven experiments in which 1 mM CP-96,345 was preincubated for 20 min with minced tissue and was then incubated with 1 mM SP and CP-96,345 for 60 min. Although, when combined with SP, a trend was seen towards inhibition of SP-evoked secretion, there were no statistically significant changes in the time courses of SP-evoked secretion of lingual lipase or amylase in the presence of CP-96,345 (p Å 0.0587 and 0.0671 for lingual lipase and amylase, respectively). CP-96,345 (1 mM ) alone did not significantly stimulate secretion of either enzyme at this concentration. However, with 10 mM CP-96,345 (Fig. 7B) , there was inhibition of SP-evoked secretion. The percentage reduction in lingual lipase secretion was 79. Since SP-analog receptor antagonists did not inhibit SPevoked secretion of lingual lipase or amylase, the effects of antagonists to other receptors were investigated. The effects of SP on major salivary glands involved the phosphoinositol pathway mediated by cholinergic stimulation ( 24 ) . Cholinergic stimulation is the major effector of protein secretion from von Ebner's gland ( 12 ) . Therefore, the cholinergic receptor antagonist, atropine, was used to inhibit any cholinergic responses that could possibly be due to SP. Figure 8 shows the effects on secretion of lingual lipase and amylase elicited by SP after preincubation of minced von Ebner's gland tissue with atropine followed by incubation with SP and atropine. Statistical analyses did not demonstrate a significant effect of atropine on the SP-evoked secretion of lingual lipase. There was no significant difference between atropine and atropine / SP on amylase secretion at the individual time points, however, statistical analysis by repeated measured ANOVA revealed an overall effect ( sum of 30 and 60 min ) of the atropine treatment, p Å 0.0298. Thus, there was some evidence of cholinergic mediation of SP-evoked amylase secretion, but not lingual lipase secretion. Two b-adrenergic receptor antagonists, propranolol ( Fig. 9 ) and timolol ( Fig. 10 ) , having both b 1 and b 2 activities had no significant effect on SP-evoked secretion, nor did they evoke secretion when incubated alone ( data not shown ) . DISCUSSION Our experiments showed that SP stimulated secretion of both lingual lipase and amylase from von Ebner's gland in a doseand time-dependent manner. In addition, recent histochemical studies of rat von Ebner's glands revealed degranulation of acinar cells in response to SP (53) and the presence of SP immunoreactivity in selective cells (38) and neuronal elements (33) . SP-evoked responses are mediated by NK-1 receptors (6, 45) . Receptors for SP have been implicated in the secretory responses of the submandibular (4, 15, 24, 56) , parotid (17, 24, 32, 56) , and sublingual glands (24) , and of the exocrine pancreas (26, 47) . Although most tissues have distinct types of receptors for a variety of tachykinin peptides, there is a lack of specificity among the tachykinin receptors, making it difficult to find specific antagonists (5, 6, 30) . In order to characterize the SP receptor in von Ebner's glands, three SP analogs (Ia, Ib, and Ic) known to antagonize SP receptors were tested. None of these analogs significantly inhibited secretion evoked by SP at concentrations of 1, 5, or 10 mM. However, two SP-analogs stimulated secretion of amylase, 1 mM D-Pro 2 -D-Trp 7,9 -SP (Ib) alone stimulated amylase secretion at all time intervals and 1 mM D-Arg 1 -D-Trp 7,9 -D-Leu 11 -SP (Spantide, Ic) alone stimulated secretion of amylase at 30 and 60 min, but none of the SP-analog inhibitors alone evoked secretion of lingual lipase. However, in other exocrine glands, investigators found that these compounds could inhibit SP-evoked secretion. In superfused segments of isolated parotid glands, Ib (10 mM) reversibly inhibited SP-induced amylase secretion (17) and Ia, Ib, and Ic also reversibly inhibited amylase release from dispersed pancreatic acinar cells (26) . CP-96,345, an SP receptor antagonist that is not a peptide, also was used to characterize the SP-induced secretion The evidence is very strong that CP-96,345 is an antagonist of the SP receptor, NK-1, in exocrine glands. In vivo, CP-96,345 has inhibited salivation elicted by SP in rats (46) and has been shown to be an antagonist of SP receptors in pancreatic acinar cells of the guinea pig (44) . The current experiments did not reveal any statistically significant effects of 1 mM CP-96,345 on the secretion evoked by SP, nor did 1 mM CP-96,345 evoke any secretion alone. However, 10 mM CP-96,345 did inhibit SP-evoked secretion as shown in Fig. 7B . While a concentration of CP-96,345 that is equimolar with SP did not interfere with the effects of SP on the SP receptor, a 10-fold concentration of CP-96,345 was effective in reducing SP-evoked secretion. One possible explanation for these differences can be drawn from reports that the SP receptor has species and organ specificity. Thus, the SP receptor in von Ebner's gland could be an isoform of the receptor found in other organs and this receptor does not bind the above mentioned SP analogs as strongly as it binds SP. Species specificity of the NK-1 receptor was revealed when CP-96,345 was found to be a more potent inhibitor of the human than the rat NK-1 receptor (16) . A minor change in the structure of the receptor could increase the binding of one class of antagonists while decreasing another (16) . A species difference was also observed in the affinity of the nonpeptide NK-1 antagonist, CP-96,345, between rat and guinea pig brains (35) . In addition, in contrast to the rat, SP had no effects on parotid or submandibular secretion in the mouse, but the responses to carbachol and isoproterenol in the mouse were similar to those in the rat (51) . An example of organ specificity was found between rat submandibular glands and the pancreas (52) . Inhibitory effects of SP on [ 3 H]myoinositol transport were mediated through NK-1 receptors in rat submandibular glands, but not in rat pancreas that also have NK-1 receptors. The effects of cholinergic and b-adrenergic receptor antagonists were investigated to determine whether the SP effects could possibly be cholinergic or b-adrenergic mediated. The lack of effect of propranolol or timolol, b-adrenergic receptor antagonists, on SP-stimulated secretion, indicated that the effects of SP were not mediated by b-adrenergic receptors. However, although atropine, a cholinergic receptor antagonist, had no statistically significant effect on the SP-stimulated secretion of lingual lipase, it did show an overall effect on SP-stimulated secretion of amylase (Fig. 8) . Thus indicating the possibility of a cholinergic response that resulted from SP stimulation of protein secretion that was differential between the two enzymes. Using the same methods, propanolol and atropine were shown to inhibit secretion of both enzymes when the tissue was stimulated by isoproterenol and carbachol, respectively (12) . Another interesting finding was that there was differential secretion of lingual lipase and amylase in both basal and SP-stimulated secretion. During basal secretion more amylase than lingual lipase was secreted in the first 15 min. Significant differences were found between the curvatures of the lingual lipase and amylase secretion time courses (Fig. 2) . The slope of the amylase time course decreased after 30 min, whereas the slope of the lingual lipase curve remained the same. If exocytosis was the only pathway of secretion, these slopes should have been identical. Similar differences were also seen when the secretion was stimulated by carbachol (12) , isoproterenol (12) , and histamine (10) . The only explanation for these findings is that factors other than exocytosis may be involved in basal or stimulated secretion of these enzymes. These factors include unstimulated or constitutive secretion (7) , and the maturative secretory pathway. This pathway is postulated to exist between the trans-Golgi network and the mature secretory granule and to provide a continuous delivery of protein to the cell surface (54) . It has been suggested that this pathway accounts for differences observed between the patterns of proteins secreted from the exocrine pancreas of conscious hogs when secretion is blocked by atropine as compared to regulated (cholinergic) secretion (54) . It is possible that the constitutive, maturative, or another as yet unknown pathway that operates in addition to exocytosis is responsible for the differential secretion of lingual lipase and amylase. In a recent review article (25) , it was suggested that processes, in addition to exocytosis, for the secretion of digestive enzymes would be important to allow for modulation of the amounts of different enzymes secreted depending upon the content of the food ingested. Whereas, exocytosis allows for the secretion of stored enzymes that have been previously synthesized, other means of secretion could modulate the synthesis and independent, immediate secretion of enzymes needed to digest a meal that required more of a particular enzyme.
