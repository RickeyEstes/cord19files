A total of 922 patients were interviewed for current symptoms of a respiratory tract infection (Table 1) . Of these, 191 (21%) patients reported at least one such symptom and 168 agreed to be tested according to the study protocol. Twenty-six patients refused to participate (14 male, 12 female, mean age 74.8 years, standard deviation [SD] 7.9 years). During the first and last four weeks of the study, 55 patients without symptoms agreed to be swabbed as well. Altogether, 223 patients (134 males, 89 females, mean age 74.9 years, SD 9.0 years) were swabbed and 845 swabs were used. A total of 183 patients were swabbed with all four swabs, 34 patients with three, five patients with two, and one patient with one swab only. A virus was recovered from at least one swab in 19 (11%) of the symptomatic patients (Table 3 ), all of whom had reported symptoms of respiratory tract infection. No patients tested positive for more than one virus and no virus was found when reswabbing previously positive patients after four weeks. One patient tested positive for Bordetella pertussis and none for Chlamydophila pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumonia. As bacterial infections were not the focus of the current study, these results were excluded from the following analysis. In general, nasopharyngeal swabs were positive at a lower CT value compared to oropharyngeal swabs (mean difference CT 4.25, 95% CI 2.43-6.07, p < 0.001), regardless of the sample type (Fig. 1) . The calculated viral load was 19 times higher (95% CI 5.4-67.2) than in the oropharynx. Influenza A virus-positive samples showed a lower CT value in the nasopharynx than in the oropharynx, with a mean difference in CT value of 8.16 (95% CI 6.98-10.35, p < 0.001), which represents a calculated 286 times higher (95% CI 126-1,305) viral load in the nasopharynx.
