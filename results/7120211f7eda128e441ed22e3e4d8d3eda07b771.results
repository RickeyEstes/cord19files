The characteristics of the nine patients studied are shown in Table 1 . The diagnosis of liver disease included: chronic hepatitis C (n = 7), liver cirrhosis and post-treatment of HCC (n = 1), and post interferon (IFN) treatment for chronic hepatitis C (n = 1). Concomitant medical complications included: hypertension (n = 5), diabetes mellitus (DM)(n = 1) and asthma (n = 1). The distributions of VAS score before and after application of REFRECARE-H ® are as shown in Table 2 . Each VAS score was lower after application of REFRE-CARE-H ® than before its use. Therefore, application of REFRECARE-H ® improved the quality of life according to all criteria. Subjective evaluations of dry mouth, breath odor, oral freshness and sleep disorders significantly improved 30 days after the application of REFRE-CARE-H ® (P = 0.01, P = 0.05, P = 0.03, P = 0.04, Table  2 ). Subjective evaluations of oral pain at a mealtimes and taste disorder improved 30 days after the application of REFRECARE-H ® (P = 0.06, Table 2 ). We analyzed any changes in laboratory data before and after the application of REFRECARE-H ® ( Table 2 ). There were no changes.
