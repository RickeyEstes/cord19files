Differential NA activity on native influenza virus and NA-expressing VLPs VLPs containing NA from H1N1pdm influenza virus were constructed by overexpression of NA in mammalian cells as previously described [23, 24] . Enzymatic activities of N1-VLP and native H1N1pdm viruses were measured by serial dilutions in an NA-Star assay, and the two preparations were normalized for their cleavage activities against the NA-Star substrate (Figure 1(A) ). Two glycosylated forms of NA at ∼75 and ∼55 kDa were detected in western blotting as reported [25] and NA protein levels of the normalized samples were found to be similar (Figure 1(B) ). However, with normalized NA contents, the sialidase activity of the H1N1pdm virus was 46.9 folds higher than that of the N1-VLP when sialic acids cleavage of fetuin was detected in ELLA (Figure 1(C) ). N1-VLP appeared to have markedly lower SA cleavage activity against immobilized fetuin when compared with that against chemiluminescent NA-Star substrate. As NA from the same virus strain was expressed on both N1-VLPs and H1N1pdm virions, it is likely that NA activity was enhanced by another viral component on the influenza virus. Although numerous viral components were missing in N1-VLPs, only the surface HA is known to interact with sialic acids and, therefore, it is rational that the concurrent expression of HA and NA facilitates the cleavage activity of NA against fetuin. Addition of influenza HA to NA-VLPs enhances the enzymatic activity in ELLA The effect of HA-NA co-expression on NA activity was investigated by the addition of HA to NA-VLPs during production. VLPs expressing various levels of FLAGtagged HA and NA from H1N1pdm influenza (N1-VLP, H1N1-VLP and H1 high N1-VLP) were prepared by adjusting DNA ratios during transfection. The VLPs were normalized by their NA activities in NA-Star assay as mentioned above ( Figure S1 ), and western blotting analysis using anti-FLAG antibody reflected a similar level of NA proteins with varied HA contents (Figure 2(A) ). Despite the samples being normalized for comparable NA content and activity on NA-Star assay, elevated NA activity against immobilized fetuin in ELLA was detected in VLPs with higher HA content. The increments were 13.5 folds in H1N1-VLPs and 22.4 folds in H1 high N1-VLPs compared to N1-VLPs without HA expression (Figure 2 (B)), indicating that NA functionality is enhanced in accordance with the level of co-expressed HA. However, ELLA activities of the HA/NA co-expressing VLPS could not reach a similar level as the native virus, probably due to a difference in glycoproteins density between VLPs and whole virions.
