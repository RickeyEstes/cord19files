Patients. In total, 12 patients with SONFH (age, 32.3±2.3 years; range, 25-40 years) and 12 healthy volunteers (age, 33±2.3 years; range, 28-41 years) were enrolled. There was no significant difference in the age (P= 0.827) between the SONFH and healthy volunteer groups. All the patients were diagnosed with ONFH by MRI. The patients classified as stage 1 or 2 by the Ficat classification system were enrolled in the study. The medical records show that all of them had received glucocorticoid therapy due to arthralgia. The mean steroid dose in equivalent milligrams of prednisone was 850 mg (range, 290-3300 mg). The mean time from administration of steroids to the development of hip symptoms was 16.6 months (range, 6-33 months), but none of them fulfilled the diagnosis criteria of rheumatoid arthritis. 2-D DIGE analysis of differential protein expression. 2-D DIGE was performed to analyze differential protein expressions as previously described (12) . Approximately 1,600 protein spots were detected across all four gels by the DeCyder image analysis software (GE Healthcare). Fig. 1A shows the superimposed images in pseudocolor from Cy3-and Cy5-labelled sera samples and the positions of the spots corresponding to the proteins revealed by 2-D DIGE analysis. Fig. 1B presents the differences in protein expression by the DeCyder 3-D spot simulations. Four protein spots with >1.4-fold decrease in abundance between the patient and control groups were identified by computer-assisted comparative analysis (P<0.05, Student's t-test; Table I ). To further confirm the change of these four protein spots, two preparative gels loaded with 500 µg protein from each extract were run in parallel and followed by Deep Purple staining. The decrease of the protein abundance was consistent with the result of CyDye labeled images as analyzed by DeCyder software. Four proteins were revealed to be downregulated in the sera of patients with SONFH. Protein identification. The above four differential protein spots were excised and digested with trypsin in gel for MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) analysis. The product spectra generated by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS were searched against the Swiss-Prot database for exact matches using the MASCOT by PMF (Fig. 2) . The four proteins were respectively inter-α-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITIH4), complement component 4 (C4), A2MG and C3 (Table I) . Western blot analysis and ELISA to confirm the differential expression. To validate the differential expressions of these four proteins, the eight serum samples used for the DIGE experiment were assessed by western blot analysis with the specific antibodies. The levels of C4, ITIH4, A2MG and C3 are significantly lower in the patient group than in the control group (Fig. 3) , which is consistent with the results from the proteomic study. Subsequently, it was determined whether proteins express differentially during femoral head tissue necrosis. To test if it is the case for A2MG, the proteins prepared from the necrotic femoral head tissue were analyzed by ELISA. The expression of A2MG was significantly lower in patient group than in the control group (Fig. 4) , which is consistent with the result of the serum samples. No change was observed in the levels of C3, C4 and ITIH4 in necrotic bone tissues (data not shown).
