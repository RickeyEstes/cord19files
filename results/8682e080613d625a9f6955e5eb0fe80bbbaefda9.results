Expression of SARS-CoV nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6. To determine if any of the three integral membrane nonstructural proteins of the SARS-CoV are capable of inducing double-membrane vesicles, we first validated the expression of our various nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 constructs via Western blot analysis. Constructs were created (Fig. 1A ) as described previously (56) . Lysates from HEK293T cells transfected with our full-length nsp3 construct, termed nsp3 and featuring a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site and a biotinylation signal, yield a pattern similar to that seen with SARS-CoV-infected cell lysates when probed using an anti-nsp3 antibody (Fig. 1B) . A truncated form of nsp3 (N terminus through the group II-specific marker [GSM] domain), called nsp3N, was also detectable using an anti-nsp3 antibody (Fig. 1B) . Our nsp3N-terminal construct, nsp3C-terminal construct (spanning the first transmembrane domain through the C terminus), nsp4 construct, and nsp6 construct, all featuring a C-terminal HA tag followed by a 3ϫ FLAG tag, are detectable using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1C) . We note here that the nsp3C-terminal construct that we used is distinct from that used by Hagemeijer et al. (32) mentioned in the introduction, which included the GSM domain. Immunofluorescence detection of all constructs was also performed (Fig. 2) . Phenotypes observed in electron microscopy of transfected samples were categorized and can be found in Table 1 . A comparison of our observed results versus expected results can be found in Table 2 . An explanation of the quantitation methods used for both tables can be found in Materials and Methods. Both full-length and truncated forms of nsp3 induce DMB and MGV. Single transfection of both full-length nsp3 and nsp3C yielded similar phenotypes. Both appeared capable of causing the Fig. 2A) . In a time course immunofluorescence experiment, the nsp3 hollow structures grew larger as time progressed, with the hollow centers being first visible at 12 h posttransfection (Fig. 2D ). The nsp3N construct appeared to be dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in immunofluorescence (Fig. 2B ) and showed no distinct phenotype in electron microscopy. Nsp4 with nsp3 produces MLBs featuring doublemembrane walls. Transfection of nsp4 alone induced a punc-tate pattern as observed via immunofluorescence microscopy consistent with the localization of nsp4 to the ER (Fig. 2B ), as others have demonstrated (31, 52) . In electron microscopy, cells transfected with nsp4 alone showed no distinct phenotype ( Table 1) . Cotransfection of nsp3 and nsp4 produced a pattern that was distinct from that seen for either nsp3 alone or nsp4 alone in immunofluorescence (Fig. 2C ). In electron microscopy, it was observed that the membranes in this cotransfection form an extensive (typically~2-m diameter) winding mazelike body (MLB), featuring paired membranes interspersed with double-membrane circular structures with an average diameter of~80 nm (Fig. 4) . The apposing walls of the MLB were typically separated from each other by approximately 20 nm. The MLB appear perinuclear, and interconnections with the ER were present (Fig. 4, black arrowheads) . Nsp6 induces single-membrane vesicles around microtubule organizing centers. Transfection of nsp6, either alone or along with nsp3, yielded the presence of a large amount of smoothwalled single-membrane spherical vesicles approximately 280 Ϯ 60 nm in diameter (Fig. 5C ). While this microtubule organizing center vesiculation (MTOCV) phenotype was not exclusive to nsp6 transfections, it was far more prevalent in nsp6-transfected cells (Table 1) . This was consistent with what we observed in immunofluorescence with single nsp6 transfections, where the nsp6 signals clustered perinuclearly in one area of the cell. Interestingly, when nsp6 was coexpressed with nsp4, the MTOCV phenotype was lost (Fig. 5D ) and regions surrounding the MTOC instead looked like the equivalent areas in untransfected or nsp4 singly transfected cells (Fig. 5A and B) (Table 1) . Nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 together induce a pattern of doublemembrane vesicles similar to that seen in SARS-CoV-infected cells. A triple transfection of nsp3 and nsp4 and nsp6 yielded double-membrane vesicles (Fig. 6C to E) with connections to convoluted membranes of morphology similar to that of those induced in SARS coronavirus-infected cells (Fig. 6A and B) . Whereas SARS-CoV-induced DMVs tend to remain approximately 210 Ϯ 30 nm in diameter, the DMVs induced by nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 triple transfection exhibited a smaller average diameter of 120 Ϯ 40 nm. Both infection-induced and transfectioninduced DMVs showed an approximate 20-nm separation between apposing membranes. As is the case for SARS-induced DMVs, the triple transfection induced interconnected DMVs that appeared perinuclear, showed contiguity with the ER, and exhibited dark membrane staining. In addition to the DMVs induced by the triple transfection, regions of MLB and MTOCV appearing in the same cell were found three times as frequently as DMVs were found. Interestingly, a triple transfection of nsp3C with nsp4 and nsp6 yielded regions of DMB, MGV, and MTOCV but never maze-like bodies, double-membrane vesicles, or any additional novel structures (Table 1) .
