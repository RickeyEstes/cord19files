ChAdOx1 MERS vaccination elicited neutralising antibodies with no statistically significant difference detected between immunisation routes (Mann Whitney U test, p = 0.49) (Fig. 1a) . No MERS-CoV neutralising antibody response was observed among the ChAdOx1 vaccine encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (ChAdOx1 eGFP) vaccinees. To evaluate vaccine efficacy animals were challenged intranasally at 28 days post-vaccination with 10 4 TCID 50 of the HCoV-EMC/2012 MERS-CoV strain in a total volume of 25 µl and observed daily for signs of disease. Euthanasia was indicated at >20% loss of initial body weight. At 3 days post-inoculation (dpi), four animals from each group were euthanized and lungs collected for analyses. The remaining six animals per group were sacrificed 28 dpi, or when they reached the humane endpoint . e Nucleocapsid ELISA responses (n = 6 per group). All experimental procedures were performed as previously described. 16 Red = ChAdOx1 eGFP intranasally vaccinated animals; Grey = ChAdOx1 MERS intranasally vaccinated animals; Blue = ChAdOx1 eGFP intramuscularly vaccinated animals; Purple = ChAdOx1 MERS intramuscularly vaccinated animals criteria. These group sizes were sufficient to allow detection of 100% efficacy in the ChAdOx1 MERS group compared to controls with 90% power using a two-sample comparison of proportions at an alpha of 5% as determined in Stata ® v12 statistical software. ChAdOx1 eGFP vaccinees developed signs of disease, including loss of body weight, ruffled fur and lethargy (Fig. 1b) . Weight loss begun 3 dpi and at 7-8 dpi all mice in the ChAdOx1 eGFP groups either succumbed to infection or reached the predefined euthanasia criteria (Fig. 1c) . No signs of disease or significant loss of body weight were observed in mice vaccinated with ChAdOx1 MERS (Fig. 1b, c) . The presence of MERS-CoV RNA in the lungs and brains was analysed by qRT-PCR on mice (n = 4/group) sacrificed at 3 dpi. High viral loads were found in the lower respiratory tract but not the brains of the ChAdOx1 eGFP-vaccinated mice (intranasal 10 5.32 TCID 50 eq/g tissue, 95% confidence interval (CI): 10 2.28 -10 5.77 , intramuscular 10 4.51 TCID 50 eq/g tissue, 95% CI: 10 3.1 -10 4.96 ). No viral RNA was detected in any of the ChAdOx1 MERS vaccinated mice (Fig. 1d) . Immunohistochemistry staining for MERS-CoV in lung tissue showed abundance of antigen in the ChAdOx1 eGFPvaccinated mice, but not the ChAdOx1-MERS vaccines (Fig. 2) . MERS-CoV replication was only observed in the type I and type II pneumocytes (Fig. 2 inserts) but not in any of the other respiratory cells such as endothelial cells, bronchiolar epithelium or macrophages of the ChAdOx1 eGFP control animals. No MERS-CoV antigen was observed at 3 dpi, in the brains of any of the mice. However, as our emphasis was on assessing vaccine efficacy against the respiratory phase of disease, no brain samples later than the peak of virus replication in the respiratory tract (3 dpi) were collected. To address whether or not the single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine truly resulted in sterile immunity, we analysed the pre and post challenge sera with a MERS-CoV nucleoprotein ELISA. Irrespective of the route of immunisation, relatively low levels of IgG antibodies against nucleoprotein were detected (Fig. 1e) , indicating that the animals were likely briefly infected during the first 1-2 days after inoculation but that this did not result in morbidity and mortality. No significant difference in the MERS-CoV nucleoprotein response was detected between the vaccinated groups (Mann Whitney U test, p = 0.6970; Fig. 1e ).
