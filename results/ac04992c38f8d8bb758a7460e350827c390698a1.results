A total of 2085 respiratory samples with RSV detected were collected from children from birth to 21 years of age at Seattle Children's Hospital-University of Washington from November 2008 to March 2013 ( Figure 1 ). Of these, 277 samples were collected from 125 immunocompromised patients, of whom 32 were inpatients at time of diagnosis and 39 had an immunocompromising condition other than a hematologic malignancy or transplant. A total of 67 samples were collected from 54 immunocompromised outpatients. Thirty-seven (69%) patients had a hematologic malignancy, 10 (19%) were SOT recipients, and 7 (13%) were HCT recipients ( Table 1) . The majority of patients with a hematologic malignancy were actively receiving chemotherapy (n = 31; 84%). The median age of these patients was 6 years (range, 10 months-21 years). Of the 15 (28%) outpatients who were hospitalized due to RSV infection, six had a hematologic malignancy, three were SOT recipients, and six were HCT recipients. Thirty-seven (69%) of RSV cases were potentially clinic acquired; the majority of these were in patients with a hematologic malignancy (n = 27; 73%). Patients with a fever were more likely to be hospitalized [13 (87%) vs. 14 (36%), respectively; P < 0Á01], while those with a hematologic malignancy were less likely to be hospitalized [6 (40%) versus 31 (79%); P < 0Á01; Table 2 ]. No patients were receiving palivizumab for RSV prophylaxis at the time of diagnosis. One (2%) patient with an underlying diagnosis of B-cell ALL received IVIG 33 days prior to her RSV diagnosis.
