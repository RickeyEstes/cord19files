Twelve patients underwent allogeneic HCT for hematologic disorders associated with germline SAMD9 (n = 6) or SAMD9L (n = 6) mutations (Table 1) . Patients 3, 4, 6, 11, and 12 (Table 1) were included in previous reports [11, 13, 17] . Indication for transplant was MDS in 10 of 12 (83%) cases. One SAMD9 patient with markedly reduced megakaryocytic precursors in marrow underwent transplantation for a presumed diagnosis of congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, and 1 patient with SAMD9L mutation and shortened telomeres underwent transplantation on a presumed diagnosis of dyskeratosis congenita. Median age at presentation for patients with SAMD9 mutations (1.65 years; range, 0.17 to 4.8 years) was similar to those with SAMD9L mutations (1.43 years; range, 0.67 to 12.6 years). Six patients had pancytopenia, including 5 with thrombocytopenia and 1 with anemia. Bone marrow was hypocellular in 11 (92%) cases and showed dysplasia most prominently in the megakaryocytic lineage in most cases. Chromosome 7 abnormalities, including monosomy 7 and chromosome 7q deletions, were present in all cases. All except 1 case showed somatic mosaicism for chromosome 7 abnormalities (ie, detection of a monosomy 7 or chromosome 7 deletion clone in only a fraction of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow). Exome sequencing revealed 5 different missense heterozygous mutations in the 6 SAMD9 cases and 4 different missense mutations in the 6 SAMD9L cases. Their genomic details and pathogenicity assessment of variants are summarized in Table 2 and cross-referenced [5, 7, 8, 12, 13, [17] [18] [19] [20] . Six of 12 cases were familial. Four SAMD9 patients had phenotypic features of MIRAGE syndrome (patients 1, 2, 5, and 6; Tables 1 and 2); unique findings included panhypopituitarism, laryngeal cleft, and glomerulosclerosis. Two other cases with a SAMD9 mutation had milder phenotypes with growth restriction in 1 and hypospadias and a bifid scrotum in another. The remaining patients had no phenotypic abnormalities. Transplant details of individual cases are summarized in Table 3 . Median age at HCT was 2.8 years (range, 1.16 to 12.8 years). Median age at HCT tended to be higher in SAMD9 patients versus SAMD9L patients at 4.15 years versus 2.2 years, respectively (P = .81). Median time from initial presentation to transplant was 0.45 years (range, 0.2 to 6.53 years). There was an interval of 5.5 and 6.53 years from initial diagnosis to HCT in 2 cases of MIRAGE syndrome because in these cases, blood counts seemed to show improvement before patients developed sustained marrow failure. Stem cell sources included bone marrow (matched unrelated, n = 7; HLA identical sibling, n = 2; and haploidentical parent, n = 1) and unrelated cord blood (n = 2). Nine patients received myeloablative conditioning (busulfan based, n = 7, or total-body irradiation based, n = 2). Three patients received reduced-intensity conditioning with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, or melphalan, with rabbit antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab. Clinically significant pretransplant comorbidities were present in SAMD9 cases with MIRAGE syndrome (Table 3 ). These included chronic diarrhea, electrolyte imbalance, infections, adrenal insufficiency, failure to thrive, lung disease, and renal dysfunction. One patient with SAMD9L mutation (patient 10, Table 2 and Table 3 ) had been treated for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, disseminated sepsis, invasive fungal infections before transplant. Post-transplant complications included pericardial effusions (n = 3), veno-occlusive disease of liver (n = 3), thrombotic microangiopathy (n = 2), and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (n = 1). Unique complications in several MIRAGE syndrome cases included large volume stool losses with dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, temperature and blood pressure instability, and hypoxia. Eight patients required transfer to intensive care for management of respiratory failure (n = 5), sepsis (n = 1), and severe hypertension (n = 1) and VOD of liver (n = 1). One patient with a familial SAMD9L mutation, MDS, (patient 7, Table 3 ) and morbid obesity failed to engraft following reduced-intensity conditioning with double unrelated cord blood transplantation. All other patients achieved neutrophil and platelet engraftment at a median of 16 days (range, 12 to 19; n = 11) and 17 days (range, 12 to 40; n = 10) post-HCT, respectively. Two patients developed grade II to III acute GVHD, which resolved with treatment. Two patients developed mild skin chronic GVHD. Two patients have chronic lung disease, and 2 other patients have chronic kidney disease. One patient with SAMD9L mutation and MDS (patient 7, Table 3 ) with failed engraftment subsequently developed AML and died of its treatment complications. A second patient, with SAMD9L mutation and MDS (patient 10, Table 3 ), died of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage while receiving defibrotide for treatment of veno-occlusive disease of liver. Immune reconstitution data are summarized in Table 4 . Ten of 12 patients were alive with a median follow-up of 3.1 years (range, 0.1 to 14.7 years). All surviving patients (n = 10) at time of last follow-up had resolution of hematologic disorder, had no chromosome 7 abnormalities, and sustained peripheral blood donor chimerism (90% to 100%). All patients were thriving. SAMD9 cases had varying degrees of developmental delays (n = 6) and chronic kidney disease (n = 3). All patients with clinical characteristics of MIRAGE syndrome (n = 4) were short for age, required supplemental feeds, and had persistent adrenal insufficiency. In SAMD9L cases (n = 4), no clinical neurologic manifestations have been observed so far.
