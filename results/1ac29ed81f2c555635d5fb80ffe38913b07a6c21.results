The recombinant-tagged polypeptide S was detected by WB immunoassay by using monoclonal antibody specific for 6Ã— histidine tag. r-S reacted strongly with the anti-histidine monoclonal antibody and appeared as a single band of 30 kDa. The optimal r-S antigen concentration in ELISA (150 ng/well) was selected to give maximum discrimination between positive and control negative sera. By the r-S -bases ELISA, the mean and the standard deviation obtained using 10 CCoV negative sera (#11-20) were 0.021 and 0.0074, respectively. Therefore, the cut-off value of ODs was determined as 0.044. The same sera by the whole-antigen ELISA displayed an OD mean of 0.028, with a cut-off value of 0.040. The four sera positive for CCoV-IIb (#1-4) displayed an OD mean of 0.152, confirming the immunogenicity of r-S (Table 1 ). The wholeantigen CCoV ELISA, carried out on the positive TGEV-like sera, confirmed the presence of antibodies to CCoV, with OD values related to those obtained in the r-S -based ELISA (mean OD value: 0.199). As expected, the sera positive for CCoV-IIa classical strains (#5-10) tested strongly positive by the whole-antigen ELISA (mean OD value: 0.219) but they were negative by the r-S -based ELISA, with an OD median value of 0.031.
