At necropsy examination, the lungs were diffusely firm and mottled dark red in all four puppies; consistent with acute bronchopneumonia (Fig. 1A) . No other significant gross findings were noted. On histopathological examination of the lungs, severe neutrophil and macrophage infiltration was observed in the bronchi and alveoli of all four puppies examined (Fig. 1B) . The lungs were diffusely congested and multifocal necrosis and haemorrhage were observed in areas with severe inflammation. Aggregates of basophilic coccobacilli were often observed on the surface of bronchial mucosa (Fig. 1C) . At higher magnification, the bacterial agents were seen to be attached to the cilia of bronchial epithelial cells (Fig. 1D) . These coccobacilli were negative on Gram staining. No other significant histological lesions were observed in other organs. IHC for B. bronchiseptica antigen revealed positive labelling of the bacteria on the surface of the bronchial mucosa (Fig. 1E ). In addition, positive signals were detected in the cytoplasm of neutrophils and macrophages in the bronchi and alveoli (Fig. 1F) . Lung tissues were negative for E. coli antigen by IHC. SEM showed numerous coccobacilli on the surface of the bronchial mucosa ( Fig. 2A) . On TEM, coccobacilli were observed between the cilia of bronchial epithelium (Fig. 2B) . The bacteria were 0.5 mm in diameter and 1.0e1.5 mm in length, with pili on the membrane attached to the cilia of the bronchial epithelial cells. Real-time PCR of the lung tissue was positive for B. bronchiseptica. Other pathogens associated with CIRD were not detected.
