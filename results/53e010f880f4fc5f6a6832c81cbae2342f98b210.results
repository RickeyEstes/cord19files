For the phase starting February 23, we estimate parameters from data ending on various dates in Table 1 . We could obtain estimates for every consecutive day after recognizing the outbreak, but we only give results for every 10 days for brevity, with the first ending on March 25. The best fitting Richards model, ending on April 26 and 28, yields the parameter values given in bold letters. The estimated value for the turning point t i during this phase is computed from the estimates for r, a, and t m by using equation (2) . As the initial time t = 0 is February 23 and symptom onset occurs ≈5 days after infection (10) (from acceleration to deceleration) for disease transmission in the Toronto area ≈5 days before March 20. The number of cases during the phase ending on April 26 is 144, well approximated by our carrying capacity, K = 144.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] 142.19-146.09). Moreover, the results in Table 1 show that, using data from February 23 to April 4, or 10 days after the turning point of this phase, model fitting gives an estimate of K = 140.53 (95% CI 115.88-165.17). That is, given case data at the time of the outbreak, we could estimate the cumulative case number in the first phase accurately (Figure 3 ) 10 days after the turning point on March 25 and 22 days before the end of the first phase. This estimate also is the cumulative case number assuming no subsequent waves of infection. Unfortunately, this was only the first wave in this outbreak, as indicated by estimates starting to diverge again after April 30. The last 2 rows of Table 1 suggest that the second turning point, the start of a second phase of this outbreak, occurred by April 30. Consequently, we go to step 3 in our procedure. Here we use the incidence data starting on April 18 and continuing past April 30 to obtain a least-squares estimate of the minimum point t min of the incidence curve. This choice of period ensures the minimum is contained in the time interval. Given that t = 0 is April 18, the least-squared estimate of the local minimum converges after May 18 and is t min = 9.11 (95% CI 8.95-9.27) as shown in Table 2 , along with previous estimates given every other day. This finding pinpoints the second turning point of the Toronto outbreak at April 27. Hence, April 27 separates the 2 Sshaped curves spanning the respective time periods February 23 to April 26 and April 28 to June 12, the end of the outbreak. Again, as the data used in this article are given by onset date, which occurred after ≈5 days of incubation (10), April 22 is the actual second turning point that foretold the second wave of infections in Toronto. The index patient for the second phase had onset of respiratory symptoms, fever, and diarrhea on April 19 (11), 3 days before the turning point pinpointed by this procedure. Our result also corroborates the assessment of Health Canada, which pinpointed April 21 as the start of second phase of the outbreak in Toronto (Figure 1 in [11] ). Starting with the second phase of the outbreak on April 28, we again fit the cumulative case data from April 28 to the Richards model. As the case number on April 28 is 144, we use a transformation of S(t) = S real (t)-143, where S real (t) is the actual data at time t, so the initial data on April 28 used here is S(0) = 1. We again fit the model to the cumulative data ending on various dates past May 25; the results are given in Table 3 and Figure 4 . The estimates start to converge after June 4, in the last 2 rows of Table 3 (11). Note also that this estimate is obtained by using data that end just 11 days after the turning point on May 24, giving an accurate prediction of the actual cumulative case number ( Figure 4 ).
