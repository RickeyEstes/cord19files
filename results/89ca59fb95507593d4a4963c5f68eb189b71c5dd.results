We have sequenced the complete genomes of SARS-CoV from five Singapore isolates derived from one index case (SIN2500), three primary cases (SIN2677, SIN2748, and SIN2774), and one secondary case (SIN2679). These sequences showed that the genomes of SARS-CoV isolated in Singapore are comprised of 29 711 bases, with the exception of a five-nucleotide deletion in strain SIN2748 and a six-nucleotide deletion in SIN2677. Initial BLAST analysis suggested that the Singapore SARS virus is similar to, but distinct from, the group 2 coronaviruses in the Coronaviridae family of enveloped and positive-stranded RNA viruses. As in the recently sequenced SARS-CoV (HKU39849, CUHK-W1, TOR2, and URBANI), the Singapore SARS virus contains 11 predicted open reading frames that encode 23 putative mature proteins with known and unknown functions. Most of the non-structural proteins seem to be encoded in the first half of the genome including nsp1 and nsp2, with putative proteinase function and nsp9 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, whereas most of the structural proteins such as spike, membrane, envelop, and nucleocapsid are located in the second half of the genome (figure 1, webfigure: http://image.thelancet. com/extras/03art4454webfigure.pdf). The haemagglutinin esterase, which is common in the group 2 coronavirus, is missing in the SARS-CoV genome, suggesting that some of the non-structural genes are dispensable in coronaviruses. Although the genome organisation of SARS-CoV is similar to that of other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is only distantly related to any coronavirus member, irrespective of species specificity, at both nucleotide and aminoacid levels (figure 2). In assessing the homology with coronaviridae genomes from other species with the SARS-CoV, sequence the genome, and the corresponding fragments from other coronaviruses are placed vertically. The brightness of a pixel corresponds to the strength of the match between a SARS fragment and a coronavirus genome; the smaller the p value, the brighter the pixel. At p=1 it is black, and the brightness is proportional to log (1Ã·p) until p is less than 10 -11 , when it is white. The panel shows the accession numbers of the coronavirus sequences used.
