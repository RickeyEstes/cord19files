Of the 68 patients, 60 (88.2%) completed the study treatment while eight (11.8%) discontinued treatment. Reasons for withdrawal and discontinuation of treatment were as follows: elevated AST or A ALT levels ≥ 3 × ULN in two patients (at 84 and 196 days, respectively), with peak AST and ALT values of 106 and 98 for AST, and 65 and 52 for ALT, respectively; noncompliance or loss of follow-up in six patients (at 28, 49, 69, 127, 151 and 163 days, respectively). Of the six patients with noncompliance or loss of follow-up, four did not return to the outpatient clinic for various periods of time during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in T Taiwan. There was loss of follow-up in the other two patients. These six patients were excluded from the analyses. At the end of the study, the mean dose of rosiglitazone in the remaining patients was 7.7 mg/day and 58 (92%) were taking 8 mg/day. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of the patients at baseline and after 24 weeks of rosiglitazone treatment are shown in the Table. y Rosiglitazone treatment decreased mean FPG by 45 ± 45 mg/dL (p < 0.001), A1C by 1.4 ± 1.1% (p < 0.001), fasting plasma insulin by 4.2 ± 7.2 μ L U/mL (p < 0.001), 2-hour postprandial glucose by 51 ± 95 mg/dL (p < 0.001) and HOMA-IR by 2.88 ± 3.65 (p < 0.001). Mean A1C reduced significantly from a baseline of 8.4 ± 1.3% to < 7.0% in 60% (36/60) and < 6.5% in 30% (18/60) of the patients. Mean ALT decreased significantly from 47 ± 13 U/L to 35 ± 17 U/L (p < 0.001), and AST decreased from 32 ± 10 U/L to 30 ± 12 U/L, although this change was not significant (p = 0.333). Mean y TC, LDL-C and HDL-C all increased significantly (9.2%, 15.9% and 6.0%, respectively, p < 0.005), while TG decreased by 10.9%, although this reduction was not significant (p = 0.195). Mean diastolic blood pressure showed significant reduction at the end of the treatment period from 80 ± 10 mmHg to 76 ± 9 mmHg (p = 0.003), while mean systolic blood pressure showed no significant change. Weight increased in 88.3% (53/60) of pat tients over the treatment period. Mean weight increased by 2.6 ± 2.4 kg (p < 0.001). Although the incidence of mild to moderate clinical edema was 20.0% (12/60), it was not severe enough y to require discontinuation of treatment in any patient. There was a significant increase in mean fat mass (2.0 ± 3.0 kg, p < f 0.001), percentage of body fat (1.7 ± 3.6%, p < 0.001) and BMI (1.1 ± 1.1 kg/m 2 , p < f 0.001). However, the weight of total body water did not change significantly. Mean WC decreased by 2.0 cm (p < 0.05), while mean waist/hip ratio (WHR) reduced by 0.06 ± 0.08 (p < 0.001). The mean level of A1C with time and the perr centage of patients with normalization of liver function in the response group with time are shown in Figure 1 . Mean A1C decreased rapidly during the first 8 weeks of treatment, from 8.4% to 7.4% (p < 0.001), with a slower but cony tinued decrease to 7.0% by the end of the study period. Before the addition of rosiglitazone, 63.3% (38/60) of patients had dyslipidemia, w while 70.0% (42/60) had dyslipidemia at the end of the study (p = 0.44). In the response group, normalization of liver function was first noted as early as the 4 th week after starting rosiglitazone in 15% (9/60) of patients. This incidence increased to 22% (13/60) by the 8 th week and to 33.3% (20/60) by the 12 th week. c There was no significant difference in metabolic i Figure 1 . f h l f Percentage of cases with normalization of liver function and mean A1C with time in the study group (n = 60).

Stepwise regression analysis showed no significant correlation between ALT and A1C, ALT and HOMA-IR, ALT and body weight as well as ALT and fat mass. Linear regression analysis showed significant correlations between change in weight and A1C (p = 0.007), and change in weight and fat mass (p = 0.001) (Figure 2 ). Follow-up abdominal sonography after rosiglitazone treatment did not show significant change in the fatty liver status in either the response or nonresponse group. Of the initial 68 patients, only two patients (2.9%) withdrew due to elevated AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN. In one of the two patients who withdrew due to elevated liver transaminase levels, follow-up after discontinuation of rosiglitazone showed AST and ALT levels had reduced to < 3 × ULN. In the other patient, AST and ALT levels fluctuated after stopping rosiglitazone but remained > 3 × ULN. Both patients were otherwise stable. No patient developed episodes of hypoglycemia, heart failure, weight gain or other side effects severe enough t to necessitate withdrawal from the treatment protocol.
