Velocities of door-opening and figure movement in each scenario were defined and programmed into the controller chip to be within a realistic parameter range when scaled up to their full-scale motions in an air medium. Realistic walking speeds equivalent to , 1-1.2 m/s in air were chosen for these model parameters, though obviously walking speeds may vary considerably between individuals. Only one sliding door opening-speed was examined (Table 1 , Figures 3 and 4 , Videos S1-S2), as other settings showed relatively little difference. For the hinged-doors, both slow (Table 1 , Videos S3-S4) and fast (Table 2, Figures 5 and 6) angular velocities were investigated. This was done because the effect of these door-opening motions on the movements of the food dye were much more dramatic and it was of interest to capture these flows at these two speeds, with the fast parameters being approximately twice those of the slow parameters. Brief descriptions of each door-opening scenario are also included in Tables 1  and 2 . From a qualitative visual inspection of these images, it can be clearly seen that the single-doors produce less disturbance than the double-doors, and sliding doors produce far less air exchange than hinged-doors, i.e. single-sliding,double-sliding,single-hinged,double-hinged, when the doors are graded in terms of the potential for their door-opening motion to induce bulk air flow movement across the doorways. For both the single-and double-sliding doors, the movement of the human figure through the door caused a significant additional amount of food dye to be exchanged (both into and out of the room) because the motion of the sliding doors themselves caused very little disturbance to the food dye. In contrast, the relative effect of the manikin movement on the food dye was much smaller when moving through the single-and double-hinged doors because the opening motion of these hinged doors caused significantly more movement of the food dye across the doorway.
