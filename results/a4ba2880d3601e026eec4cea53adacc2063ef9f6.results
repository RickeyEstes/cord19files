In order to assess the safety and efficacy of Montanide TM adjuvanted mucosal IB live vaccines, 8 groups of 10 1-day old SPF chickens were vaccinated with Montanide ISA 201 VG, Montanide IMS 1313 N VG, Montanide Gel 01 ST or commercial non-adjuvanted IB formulations by mucosal delivery, either via individual intranasal delivery or by multi-animals spray delivery (Trial 1). One negative control group was left unvaccinated. A kinetic of blood sampling was performed to assess the immune response and antigen titers were measured via antigen specific IgG ELISA. All animals from all groups were submitted to an IB challenge at day 56. To confirm the potential of adjuvants for live vaccines in field conditions, the same protocol was applied to 5 groups of 10 22-day old farm chickens via intranasal delivery (Trial 2).
