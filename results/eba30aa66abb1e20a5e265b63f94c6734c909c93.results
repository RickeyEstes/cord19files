The Extracellular Domain of gE Interacts with IDE VZV gE is essential for virus replication and may be important for virus entry. To identify cellular ligands that interact with gE, a soluble form of the extracellular domain of gE fused to human Ig Fc was immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads and used in a pull-down assay with cell lysates from human melanoma cells that are permissive for VZV infection. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie blue. A unique band of about 120 kDa ( Figure 1A ) was pulled down by the gE-Fc fusion protein but was absent from protein lysates incubated with Sepharose alone or control Fc fusion proteins. The band was excised, and sequencing identified the protein as IDE. To confirm the interaction of gE with IDE and rule out the possibility of binding to the Fc tag, pull-down assays were performed using truncated gE without an Fc tag (gEt) immobilized onto protein A-Sepharose beads with monoclonal antibody to gE and incubated with lysates from HeLa cells or human T cells. After extensive washing, the beads were boiled in sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE separation, transferred to membranes, and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-IDE antibody. gEt formed a complex with IDE that was detected with antibody to gE in both HeLa and T cells ( Figure 1B , lanes 5-6) but not in HeLa cells when a control antibody was used in place of antibody to gE ( Figure 1B, lane 4) . IDE also bound to gE in VZV-infected melanoma cells. Immunoprecipitation of gE with anti-gE antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-IDE antibody indicated that gE interacted with IDE in VZV-infected but not uninfected cells ( Figure 1B,  lanes 1-3) . gB and gH play important roles in viral entry and/or infectivity of herpesviruses. We tested whether IDE interacts with VZV gB, VZV gH, VZV gI, or HSV gE. Lysates from VZV-infected cells were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to VZV gE, gB, or gH and immunoblotted with anti-IDE antibody. While gE coimmunoprecipitated with IDE, gB and gH did not interact with IDE ( Figure 1C , lanes 7-9). Transfection of CV-1 cells with plasmids expressing VZV gE, VZV gI, or HSV gE followed by immunoprecipitation with the corresponding antibody and immunoblotting with anti-IDE antibody showed that the extracellular domain of VZV gI, which functions as a gE chaperone but lacks sequence homology with gE, also interacted with IDE, although at a much weaker level than gE ( Figure 1C , lanes 1 and 2). This was confirmed using an ELISA-based ligand binding assay. When similar levels of His-tagged soluble gE, gI, or gB were incubated with HA-IDE, the latter bound significantly greater to gE than to either gB or gI over a range of concentrations ( Figure 1D ). HSV gE, which has 32% amino acid identity with VZV gE within a 170 amino acid region, interacted very weakly with IDE ( Figure 1C , lane 4). Immunoprecipitation of IDE from infected cells followed by immunoblotting with antibody to gE showed that the amount of gE-IDE complexes increased during the course of VZV infection ( Figure S3 ), which was in parallel with the increasing amounts of gE produced in these infected cells over time, even though the total amount of IDE remained unchanged (data not shown). A Portion of IDE that Interacts with gE Is Located on the Plasma Membrane Computer analysis indicates that the predicted sequence of IDE contains a putative amino-terminal signal peptide with a potential cleavage site between residues 22 and 23, and the majority of the sequence might be extracellular; however, a typical transmembrane domain is not apparent (TMHMM program, Technical University of Denmark). Cell fractionation studies showed that IDE is localized primarily in the cytosol (Akiyama et al., 1988) , with a small amount present on the cell-surface plasma membrane (Seta and Roth, 1997; Yaso et al., 1987) . Vekrellis et al. (2000) identified a 115 kDa cell-surface membrane-associated IDE isoform on neuronal cells (Vekrellis et al., 2000) . To verify that IDE is present on the surface of cells, we biotinylated cell surface proteins followed by immunoprecipitation with streptavadin-coated agarose beads and immunoblotting with anti-IDE antibody. A protein of 120 kDa was present on the surface of HeLa and melanoma cells (Figure 2A, lanes 1 and 2) . To determine whether gE interacts with IDE on the plasma membrane, cell-surface proteins were biotinylated and incubated with gEt. The IDE-gE complex was immunoprecipitated with gE antibody followed by immunoblotting with streptavidin-conjugated HRP to detect cell surface IDE or anti-IDE antibody to detect total IDE. A portion of the total IDE in the gE-IDE complex was derived from IDE on the cell surface ( Figure 2B , lanes 2 and 6). Controls lacking antibody to gE showed that the IDE-gE interaction was required for detection of IDE on the cell surface in this assay ( Figure 2B, lanes 3 and 4) . Anti-IDE Antibodies and Soluble IDE Extracted from Liver Reduce VZV Infectivity and Cell-to-Cell Spread Polyclonal and monoclonal IDE antibodies were tested for their ability to block VZV infection. Commercially available polyclonal anti-IDE antibody PRB-282C and monoclonal antibody 9B12 (Covance, Berkeley, CA) were used. In sev-eral experiments, addition of either antibody (50 ug/ml for 9B12 and 1/200 dilution for PRB-282C serum) to MeWo cells prior to VZV infection resulted in 30%-45% inhibition of virus infectivity ( Figures 3A and 3B) , while a control antibody (anti-CD3) or normal rabbit serum showed little or no effect. Polyclonal antibody ( Figure S4 ) blocked VZV infection in a dose-dependent manner. To determine if IDE antibody affects cell-to-cell spread of VZV, we preincubated cells with the polyclonal antibody at 1/100 to 1/200 dilutions at 4 C for 60 min followed by infection with cell-free ROka-lacZ in the presence of the antibody. Three days later the cells were stained with X-gal. IDE antibody markedly reduced plaque sizes compared to the cells treated with control normal rabbit serum The extracellular domain of gE fused to the Fc portion of human IgG (gE-Fc) bound to protein-A Sepharose was incubated with a cell lysate from melanoma cells, and proteins that bound to gE-Fc were resolved on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. A 120 kDa cellular protein is present in the cell lysate that interacts with gE-Fc. (B) gE protein from VZV ROka-infected cells (lane 1) or VZV Molly, a low-passage clinical isolate (lane 2), was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-gE antibody, and IDE was detected in immune complexes. Purified extracellular domain of gE (gEt) immobilized onto protein-A Sepharose beads with anti-gE antibody (lanes 5 and 6) pulls down IDE from cell lysates. (C) Plasmids encoding the extracellular domain of VZV gE (lane 1), gI (lane 2), full-length HSV gE (lane 4), or control vectors (lanes 3 and 5) were transfected into CV-1 cells, and immunoprecipitation with the respective antibodies pull down IDE with VZV gE and, to a lesser extent, with gI. Lysates from VZV-infected cells immunoprecipitated with anti-gE, but not with anti-gB or anti-gH, antibody pull down IDE (lanes 7-9). (D) ELISA plates were coated with HA-IDE and incubated with equal amounts of His-tagged gEt, gBt, or gIt, and binding was assayed using anti-His antibody. HA-IDE binds to gEt significantly greater than to gIt or gBt. Error bars show standard deviations, and t test was used to determine p values. ( Figure 3C ). Therefore, IDE antibody inhibits cell-to-cell spread of VZV. To determine whether purified soluble IDE can inhibit entry of VZV, we incubated cell-free ROka-lacZ with soluble IDE extracted from liver or uninfected sonicated cell protein as a control, at 37 C for 30 min before infection of melanoma cells. Four days postinfection the cells were stained with X-gal and the number of blue foci, indicative of infectivity by cell-free virus, were scored. Soluble IDE inhibited infectivity by 70%, while control protein had no effect ( Figure 3D ). In three independent experiments, IDE inhibited VZV infectivity by 50%-70%. In contrast, when soluble IDE was added at 1.5 hr after infection, it failed to reduce the number of VZV foci (data not shown), suggesting that soluble IDE extracted from liver blocks VZV entry during the initial stages of infection. To determine if soluble IDE extracted from liver affects cell-to-cell spread of VZV, we infected cells with cell-free ROka-lacZ in the presence of soluble IDE or control protein (37.5 mg/ml each) and added the proteins again on the second day of infection. Two days later the cells were stained with X-gal. Soluble IDE markedly reduced plaque sizes compared to the cells treated with control protein or no added protein ( Figure 3E ). Therefore, soluble IDE inhibits cell-to-cell spread of VZV. Interestingly, VZV infectivity was enhanced when the virus was pretreated with recombinant soluble IDE (rIDE) produced in a baculovirus expression system ( Figure 3F ). rIDE is initiated from the second ATG of the IDE coding sequence and thus is missing the first 41 amino acids of the protein. Since rIDE is produced in insect cells, it may be processed differently than IDE extracted from liver. The enhancement of VZV infectivity by rIDE supports a role for IDE in an early stage of VZV infection. Several soluble receptor molecules have been described that can either block or promote virus infection, including nectin-1 for HSV (Kwon et al., 2006; Lopez et al., 2001) and sCD4 for HIV (Sattentau and Moore, 1991; Smith et al., 1987) . Since IDE interacts with gE, and IDE degrades several proteins, including insulin (Farris et al., 2003; Goldfine et al., 1984) and amylin (Farris et al., 2003; Vekrellis et al., 2000) , we determined whether IDE degrades gE. Incubation of purified IDE with gEt at 37 C for 4 hr did not reduce the amount of the glycoprotein, while IDE degraded insulin when incubated at 37 C for 30 min ( Figure S1A) . Conversely, addition of bacitracin (1 mg/ml), an IDE inhibitor that reduces degradation of insulin and amylin by IDE (Bennett et al., 2003) , did not change the turnover rate of gE in VZV-infected cells during a pulse-chase experiment ( Figure S1B ). These results suggest that IDE is not important for degradation of gE in cells.
