The 33 compounds were aligned over, under the superimposition of the common moiety and Template Compound 6. The statistical parameters for database alignment-q 2 , r 2 , F, and SEE-were The whole framework of the comprehensive in silico method for screening potential targets and studying the quantitative structure-toxicity relationship (QSTR). The 33 compounds were aligned over, under the superimposition of the common moiety and Template Compound 6. The statistical parameters for database alignment-q 2 , r 2 , F, and SEE-were Table 1 . The CoMFA model with the optimal number of 6 components presented a q 2 of 0.624, an r 2 of 0.966, an F of 124.127, and an SEE of 0.043, and contributions of the steric and electrostatic fields were 0.621 and 0.379, respectively. The CoMSIA model with the optimal number of 4 components presented a q 2 of 0.719, an r 2 of 0.901, an F of 157.458, and an SEE of 0.116, and the contributions of steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bond acceptor, and hydrogen bond donor fields were 0.120, 0.204, 0.327, 0.216, and 0.133, respectively. The statistical results proved that the aconitine alkaloids QSTR model of CoMFA and CoMSIA under the database alignment have adequate predictability. Experimental and predicted pLD 50 values of both the training set and test set are shown in Figure 2 , and the CoMFA ( Figure 2A ) and CoMSIA ( Figure 2B ) model gave the correlation coefficient (r 2 ) value of 0.9698 and 0.977, respectively, which demonstrated the internal robustness and external high prediction of the QSTR models. Experimental and predicted pLD50 values of both the training set and test set are shown in Figure  2 Residuals vs. Leverage Williams plots of the aconitine QSTR models are shown in Figure 3A ,B. All values of standardized residuals fall between 3σ and −3σ, and the values of leverage are less than h*, so the two models demonstrate potent extensibility and predictability.

Under MeSH (Medical Subject Headings), a total of 491 articles (261 articles were received from Web of Science, and others were received from PubMed) were retrieved. After selecting cardiotoxicity-related and excluding repetitive articles, 274 articles were used to extract the correlative proteins and pathways for building a PPI network in the STRING server. The correlative proteins or pathways are shown in Table 2 . All proteins were taken as input protein in the STRING database to find its direct and functional partners [51] , and proteins and its partners were then imported into the Cytoscape 3.5 to generate the PPI network with 148 nodes and 872 edges ( Figure  4 ).

After removing the central node "AC," the centrality measurements of 147 nodes were calculated by CytoNCA and documented in Table S1 . The top 10% of three centrality measurement values of all node are painted with a different color in Figure 4A . To screen the node with the high values of each three centrality measures, nodes with three colors were overlapped and merged into sub-networks in Figure 4B .
