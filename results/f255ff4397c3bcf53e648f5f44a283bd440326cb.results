Of the 29 health care personnel who received the survey, 23 (79%) completed and returned it. Of the 23 participants, 9 (39%) classified themselves as physicians, 8 (35%) as registered nurses (RNs), and 6 (26%) as other health care personnel, including 1 nurse practitioner, 1 paramedic, 1 respiratory therapist, 1 dialysis technician, 1 medical student, and 1 infection control professional. The infection control professional's responses were excluded from this analysis. The remaining 22 participants represented a variety of health care settings, including hospitals (45%), outpatient clinics/facilities (18%), long-term care facilities (14%), federal and local public health agencies (14%), and prehospital care (9%). Most of the participants (82%) had more than 10 years experience in health care, and 50% had experience in public health. All but 1 participant was involved in providing some ''hands-on'' patient care.
