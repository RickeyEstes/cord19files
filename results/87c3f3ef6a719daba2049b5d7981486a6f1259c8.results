Data analysis. We have studied the available data for total (cumulative) number of cases R(t) as a function time t and extracted the data for number of new cases I(t) from these. Most of the earlier studies have dealt with the actual numbers of cases. However, as we attempt to provide a comparative picture, we have taken the fraction i.e., divided the numbers by the total population N p for each country. One can easily see that the comparative trends become different in the two different approaches (Fig. 1) . The disease is seen to affect the least fraction of the population in Guinea and the maximum in Liberia. However, the number of cases is maximum for Sierra Leone and not for Liberia. Considering the time at which the data reach a saturation value, one can also conclude that the disease has existed over a longer period in the case of Sierra Leone and Guinea. Had the infection probability been the sole factor responsible for the spread, the patterns would have been the same for the three countries. We argue that the network structure is responsible for the different trends. Hence a theoretical model that yields results comparable to the observed data must have more than one parameter. A minimal model would consist of two parameters like the one considered in ref. 20 . Here the agents have two nearest neighbour connections and a random long range connection to a agent located at a distance l with probability l −δ (details given in the Methods Section). The parameter δ essentially controls the network structure and the other parameter is of course the infection probability q. This study revealed that for a given δ, above a threshold value of q (which depends on δ), an epidemic can occur. The removed population in the model in ref. 20 was fitted to the form: where a, c and T depend on the values of δ and q. Note that the removed population in the model essentially corresponds to the cumulative infected cases since in the model the infected agents were assumed to be removed immediately after being infected. This fitting form is used for the cumulative data of infected cases and shows very good agreement for Guinea ( Fig. 2 (a)), while there is fairly good agreement with the data of the other two countries ( Fig. 2 (b,c)). Rescaling R(t) such that it varies from 0 to 1, one can find out the goodness of fit. We performed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to evaluate the goodness of the fit for all the three sets of data. The values are: 1.1294 for Guinea (sample size N s = 217), 1.1070 for Sierra Leone (N s = 235) and 1.4959 for Liberia (N s = 233). Thus the fittings are acceptable at the level of significance α = 0.10 for Guinea and Sierra Leone and at α = 0.01 for Liberia. From eq. (5), one can show that a peak value for I(t) will occur at t p = T log(1/c). The associated values of the exponents a, c and T are found out for the three countries and the values of t p also extracted. We have plotted the data for I(t) against t in the insets of the Fig. 2 (a-c). We observe a lot of fluctuations and not a very clear peak in the data just as in the case of SARS 11 . Even then, the theoretically estimated values of t p tally with a large value of new cases occurring close to this time. The exponent values and t p are tabulated in Table 1 . The errors in the estimation of exponents are for a,  − (10 ) 3 for c and (10 ) 0 for T (beween 0.9 to 7.6 percent). One can see that t p is also directly proportional to the total duration, being least for Liberia and maximum for Guinea. Results from the model. The cumulative data for infected people has a sigmoid form in general and has been shown to have a form given by eq. (5) in a recent study as well 27 . To establish that indeed the Euclidean network is an appropriate model responsible for the epidemic spreading, one should be able to reproduce from the model the consistent results and trends using suitable values of the parameters, at least qualitatively. Epidemic spreading on the Euclidean model with the two parameters δ and q, already mentioned in the context of data analysis, was first considered in ref. 20 . The model and simulation methods are given in detail in the Methods section. The behaviour of the network depends on the value of δ. The network behaves as a small world network for δ < 1 and as a regular one dimensional lattice for δ > 2. For 1 < δ < 2, it shows short range behaviour. These properties of the network had been earlier detected by considering its network properties as well as critical phenomena on the network (see refs 20 and 28 and the references in these papers). The Ebola virus spreads through actual body contact and in most cases the infection occurred within family members. Hence the underlying network must be short ranged. Therefore to get results comparable to the real data, one should use a value of δ larger than 1. Also, δ < 2 is chosen as a real network is more connected than a regular one. The values of q should be same in principle as it depends on biological factors. However, the value of q may be effectively altered using control schemes like contact tracing, quarantining the patient and efficiently treating the disease. Such possibilities have not been directly included in the model. We will address this issue in the next section again. We first discuss the case of Liberia and Sierra Leone. We note that the saturation values are quite close while the saturation in Liberia has been reached earlier (Fig. 1) . We find that the same value of q but a different value of δ can indeed reproduce these features; the red and green curves in Fig. 3(a) show the results for δ = 1.4 (for Liberia) and 1.6 (for Sierra Leone) while the q values are same (q = 0.70). We next discuss the case for Guinea. It has the lowest saturation value of the cumulative data for infected population while the disease is of duration slightly longer than that of Sierra Leone. This makes it quite apparent that one has to use a smaller value of q to get data consistent with that of Guinea. We find that indeed one can get such values of q keeping δ = 1.4 such that the saturation value is smaller while the duration is larger comparatively. We show the data by the blue curve in Fig. 3 (a) using q = 0.58. Of course these are some typical values which yield results comparable to the real data. A range of values exist which more or less show the same behaviour. However, that range is not too large which would mean that the values are irrelevant. For δ, this range is ± 0.05 while for q it is ± 0.02. Figure 3 (b) shows the data for I(t) against t from the Euclidean model. Again we find consistency, the red curve has a peak occurring earliest while the disease lasts for the shortest duration which corresponds to Liberia. The green curve shows a peak occurring at a later time and the duration is also longer. This we claim to correspond to Sierra Leone. The peak value is slightly less in height for the green curve compared to the red which is also consistent with the real data (up to a multiplicative factor) if one takes the single spike occurring in Fig. 2(c) inset to be spurious. The data for Fig. 2(a) inset is easily comparable to the red curve in Fig. 3(b) . The blue curve in Fig. 3 (b) corresponds to Guinea as the peak value occurs at a slightly larger time compared to the green curve while the duration is longest. The quantitative values of t p shown in Table 2 are also consistent with the real data. The errors in the estimates lie between 0.04 to 0.49 percent. The argument behind the choices of δ and q are discussed in the next section. As in the real data, one can quote here the goodness of fit for R(t) from the simulations. different (see Tables 1 and 2 ). It may be noted that a/c corresponds to the saturation value of R(t) and c and T determine the value of t p . The mismatch of the t p values is not surprising, unit of time in the model is just one Monte Carlo (MC) time step that has got nothing to do with real time. On the other hand, the saturation values depend heavily on the normalization factor. The actual population who are susceptible may form only a subset of the total population so saturation values can be different changing the values of a and c. Nevertheless, we find that the ratio of of a/c from the data and from the model for Sierra Leone and Liberia are very close which indicates that the fractions of susceptible population in these two countries were comparable while for Guinea it was smaller. Indeed, Table 3 shows that the density of infected population were same for Sierra Leone and Liberia and order of magnitude smaller in Guinea. However, one can still explore the possibility of rescaling the real data to obtain better quantitative agreement between the parameters. This may be possible by suitably choosing a normalization factor for each of the three data sets. Assuming the total population which has been removed at time t to be R tot (t) and ρN p the actual population susceptible to the disease, we calculate the density where R(t) is the density calculated earlier by dividing R tot (t) by the total population N p and ρ a proportionality constant. Taking R s (t) to be the saturation value of R(t) obtained from the model and equating it to the saturation value of R(t) obtained from the real data, one can estimate the value of ρ. For example, for Guinea, the saturation value of R(t) is 0.000328 from the data and from the model it is 0.354720. Hence ρ ≈ . × − 9 24 10 4 . Similarly for Sierra Leone and Liberia it is 3.27 × 10 −3 and 3.58 × 10 −3 respectively. On the other hand, one can compare the t p values from real data and the model and we find that the timescales in the real data are approximately 8-9.2 times the timescales in the Monte Carlo simulations. Hence we also rescale the time for the results obtained for the model. The rescaled data R s (t) and R(t) are plotted against "real time" in Fig. 4 and show an excellent agreement for Guinea and a reasonably good agreement for Sierra Leone. The agreement for Liberia is not that good, however, the data for Liberia are somewhat irregular and it is difficult to fit them with a smooth function very accurately as already noted. Particularly for Liberia and Sierra Leone we find that before saturation, there is a slower increase in R(t); this might be due to an enhancement in the treatment and preventive measures against the disease. One can similarly rescale the newly infected density I(t), however, the data being too noisy, we do not attempt that. Nevertheless, we find that the peak values of the newly infected density I(t), when scaled by ρ shows order of magnitude agreement with the model data. Further, we have fitted R s using equation 5 and present the value of the parameters in Table 4 . The values from the model and the real data are easily comparable now showing order of magnitude agreement for most of them.
