Characterization of recombinant protein containing residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV S protein fused with human IgG Fc We and Mou et al. have shown that the recombinant protein containing residues 377-662 or 358-588 of MERS-CoV S1 and human IgG Fc fragment can induce neutralizing antibody responses in immunized mice or rabbits [15, 16] . We thus believe that a truncated RBD sequence spanning residues 377-588, which includes RBM (residues 484-567) [18, 19] , may contain the major neutralizing epitope in RBD. Therefore, we expressed a recombinant protein containing residues 377-588 fused with human IgG-Fc (S377-588-Fc) (Fig. 1A) . We found that this protein could be highly expressed in the culture supernatant of transfected 293T cells and purified to high purity. Its molecular weight under the non-boiled condition was almost 1-fold greater than that under boiled condition in 10% SDS-PAGE in the presence of reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 1B) , suggesting that S377-588-Fc formed a stable, dimeric structure under reducing condition. Cross-linker analysis was then applied to characterize the conformational structure of expressed S377-588-Fc. We found that the molecular weights of the cross-linked S377-588-Fc samples were almost 1-and 3-fold higher than the samples without crosslinking (Fig. 1C) , which indicates that MERS-CoV S377-588 fused with Fc tag was able to form dimeric or tetrameric conformational structures. The bands of S377-588-Fc fusion protein in SDS-PAGE were further confirmed by Western blot using a polyclonal antibody against S1 of MERS-CoV ( Fig. 1B-C) .
