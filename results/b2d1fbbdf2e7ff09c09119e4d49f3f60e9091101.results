Total population of India is susceptible to EVD as on 01.01.2017 (Figure 4) . Dynamics of hypothetical EVD transmission from 01.01.2017 to 01.01.2019 in India is as follows. On 01.01.2017, single case of EVD was reported at New Delhi (28.6139 ∘ N and 77.2090 ∘ E). Since then, EVD hypothetically spread according to deterministic SEIR model. Spatiotemporal distribution of EVD exposed, infectious, and recovered population at 4-month interval is represented by Figures 5, 6 , and 7, respectively. From STEM data logger, number of effected districts, exposed individuals, infectious persons, and deaths at different time point is shown in Table 2 .
