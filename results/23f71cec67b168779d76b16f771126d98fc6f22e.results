A total of 241 children 2-4 years of age with gastroenteritis were tested, and samples from 36 (15%) were positive for T. whipplei. In 2006, 2007, and 2008, the infection rates for T. whipplei were comparable: 12/78 (15.4%), 10/72 (14%), and 14/91 (15.4%), respectively. No seasonal variation was observed. None of the children in the same age control group without diarrhea had samples positive for T. whipplei (0/47; p = 0.008). High bacterial loads (>10 4 /g of stool) were observed in 64% (23/36) of the T. whippleipositive children. Such high loads have not been observed in chronic carriers, but they were comparable to the levels for patients with Whipple disease (14) . Bacterial load in stools ranged from 170 to 1.5 × 10 6 /g (mean ± SD 1.5 × 10 5 ± 3.6 × 10 5 ) for children with gastroenteritis versus 85 to 2.5 × 10 6 /g (mean ± SD 5.5 × 10 5 ± 8.3 × 10 5 ) for patients with Whipple disease (p = 0.1). Only 1 postdiarrheal stool specimen was slightly positive 15 days later and had a bacterial load <85/g of stool; the bacterial load was 2 × 10 4 at the time of diarrhea. Stool samples obtained from the same patient 1 month later were negative by PCR. Genotyping of T. whipplei was performed for 34 children with diarrhea. A dendogram showing phylogenetic organization of genotypes is shown in Figure 1 . We observed genetic heterogeneity in sequences associated with gastroenteritis and identifi ed 12 new genotypes. One useful fi nd-ing was that genotype 3 was detected in 10 of the 34 children. Using Western blotting, we found that case-patients with Whipple disease were signifi cantly more likely to be seropositive than controls with diarrhea ( Figure 2 ) for IgG (7/8 vs. 5/25; p = 0.001) and IgM (7/8 vs. 1/25; p<0.001) and than controls without gastroenteritis for IgG (5/20; p = 0.004) and IgM (1/20; p<0.001). Clinical and biological features of the 36 PCR-positive children 2-4 years of age with diarrhea were compared by retrospective review with those of matched 67 control children of the same age who had gastroenteritis but were negative for T. whipplei by PCR. Results are summarized in Table 1 . Among children with positive PCR results, the proportion of girls and boys was equal. T. whipplei PCR-positive patients with diarrhea had a milder illness than PCR-negative patients. Length of rehydration required, duration of fever, and duration of hospitaliza-tion were signifi cantly shorter for the patients infected with T. whipplei (p = 0.003, p = 0.003, and p = 0.01, respectively). Moreover, the level of C-reactive protein was signifi cantly lower incase-patients (p = 0.03). Patients with T. whipplei were less likely to experience anorexia (p = 0.03); however, their weight loss was signifi cant (p = 0.045). Another signifi cant difference was increased contact with sand boxes for case-patients (p = 0.002); however, the size of the group analyzed was small, and these data should be confi rmed. Children infected with T. whipplei were co-infected with an associated pathogen more often than patients with diarrhea without T. whipplei infection (13/36 vs. 36/205; p = 0.01) ( Table 2 ). Co-infection was less common in 23 children with high T. whipplei bacterial loads (>10 4 /g of stool) than in 13 children with lower bacterial loads (5/23 vs. 8/13; p = 0.02).
