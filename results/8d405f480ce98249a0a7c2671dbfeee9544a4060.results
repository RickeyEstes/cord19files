Four chimeric oligonucleotides for five of the most common serotypes of IBV were designed. As an example, the target sequences for the anti-Massachusetts and anti-Arkansas chimeric oligonucleotides are shown in Fig. 1 . Agarose gel analysis of cleavage products verified that each chimeric oligonucleotide tested specifically cleaved runoff RNAs from the homologous S1 gene, while not cleaving runoff RNAs from heterologous S1 genes. Fig. 2 shows a representative agarose gel analysis of Massachusetts 41 S1 runoff RNA as cleaved after incubation with each chimeric oligonucleotide and RNase H. Cleavage analysis results for the Arkansas DPI and Delaware 072 S1 runoff RNAs were similar (data not shown). In each case, specific cleavage of the S1 gene runoff RNA produced the correct size cleavage products as predicted from sequence data (see arrow, Fig. 2 ). There were no non-specific cleavage products for any of the chimeric oligonucleotides tested as determined by agarose gel analysis. (Bogdanova et al., 1995; Yu and Steitz, 1997) . To assess further the specificity of each chimeric oligonucleotide, we tested their ability to cleave sample RNA extracted from eight IBV strains representing seven different serotypes. We performed SRRQ for each sample and the results of our analysis are summarized in Table 2 . All four chimeric oligonucleotides mediated the cleavage of RNA extracted from the homologous serotype of IBV. No crossreactivity was observed for any of the chimeric oligonucleotides with strains from a heterologous serotype.

The Arkansas 99 strain RNA was cleaved in the tube containing the anti-Arkansas chimeric oligonucleotide (Fig. 3A) and had a C t value of 28.57, which was approximately 3.59 cycles higher than the C t of the RNA without a chimeric oligonucleotide. The RNA from the CAV 56b strain, which does not belong to any of the four serotypes for which a chimeric oligonucleotide was synthesized, was not cleaved (Fig. 3B) . For some IBV strains not tested ex-perimentally (Table 1) , we examined the S1 gene sequence flanked by the RRT-PCR primer set, and no complementary regions to any of the chimeric oligonucleotides were present. To test further our assay, the SRRQ test was carried out on 15 allantoic fluid samples without prior knowledge to their grouping and found that we could identify accurately Massachusetts, Arkansas, Connecticut, and Delaware viruses in those samples ( Table 3 ).

Fig. 3 . Representative sample to residual ratio quantification (SRRQ) amplification graphs and data analysis. For each graph, the x-axis represents the PCR cycle number and the y-axis represents the fluorescence measured during each PCR cycle. The cycle threshold (C t ) for each sample was calculated using the second derivative maximum option. Amplification signal in the negative control (water) samples represents primer dimer and was verified by melting curve and agarose gel analysis (data not shown). (A) SRRQ for IBV strain Arkansas 99 (sample A = anti-Connecticut, C t = 24.82; sample B = anti-Massachusetts, C t = 24.15; sample C = anti-Delaware, C t = 24.90; sample D = no chimeric, C t = 24.98; sample E = anti-Arkansas, C t = 28.57). (B) SRRQ for IBV strain CAV 56b (sample A = anti-Massachusetts, C t = 20.85; sample B = anti-Arkansas, C t = 21.34; sample C = anti-Connecticut, C t = 20.59; sample D = anti-Delaware, C t = 21.57; sample E = no chimeric, C t = 21.07). no cleavage with any of the chimeric oligonucleotides or that were not amplifiable with the primer set were listed as "not typeable". Each "not typeable" strain was either an IBV from a serotype for which a chimeric oligonucleotide was not developed or an altogether different virus (Table 3) .
