The mean estimated vaccination coverage across all districts was 84% (range: 61-99%; Fig. 1a and b) . Six districts (Mangochi, Kasungu, Nkhata Bay, Mwanza, Nkhotakota, and Dedza) had estimated vaccination coverage below 80%. Mangochi, in central Malawi, had the lowest estimated vaccination coverage of 61% (CI: 57-64%). Vaccination coverage at the health polygon level resembled coverage at the district level, but was more variable; coverage at the health polygon level ranged from 0 to 100% (Fig. 1c and d) . The health polygons within the district of Mangochi had uniformly low coverage, which was consistent with the district level estimate. However, many other districts did not follow this pattern; Kasungu had district level coverage of 68% (CI: 66-70%), but the health polygon level estimates ranged from 0% (CI: 0-70.6%) to 94.8% (CI: 91.9-96.8%). Interestingly, in the district of Lilongwe in central Malawi, estimated vaccination coverage increased radially outward from the center of Lilongwe City. The mean susceptible birth cohort per district was 3510, but the value varied greatly from district to district (64-13,182, Fig. 2a and b) . The district of Mangochi, which had the lowest vaccination coverage, unsurprisingly had a susceptible birth cohort of 12,196 children per year (CI: 11, 199 ). Lilongwe, which had relatively high vaccination coverage of 83% (CI: 82-83%), had the highest susceptible birth cohort of 13,182 (CI: 12,792-13,582). These results demonstrate that vaccine coverage alone may obscure the absolute contribution of each spatial unit to the regional susceptible pool. The susceptible birth cohort at the health facility polygon scale reveals high local variability in the contribution to the regional susceptible pool (Fig. 2c) . At the district scale, Lilongwe, Mangochi, and Kasungu had the largest annual contribution to the absolute number of susceptibles. Within the districts of Mangochi and Kasungu, the health facility polygons with the largest contribution to the annual susceptible birth cohort were highly clustered. In the district of Lilongwe, though vaccination coverage (Fig. 1d ) tended to increase with distance from the city center, the higher population density in the center of the city suggests that the outlying health facility polygons contributed relatively fewer susceptibles on an annual basis (Fig. 2c) . Across Malawi, R E varied from 1.00 to 2.56 at the polygon scale. The effective reproductive ratio (R E ) at the polygon scale was the highest in southern Malawi and lowest in northern Malawi with the exception of two clusters of health facility polygons with high R E values in Mzimba and Lilongwe (Fig. 3) . Health facility polygons within the district of Blantyre had the highest R E values. We note that polygons in which no cases were reported may reflect areas where R E was below the invasion threshold of 1 or areas that have little contact with their neighbors and therefore were not exposed to infection. Each of the measures describe different characteristics of the measles epidemiology: VC is a measure of the vaccination program, the susceptible birth cohort is a measure of potential outbreak size, and R E is a measure of both the speed of an outbreak and expected outbreak size [16] . Areas that rank as high risk with respect to multiple measures may be of particular concern and warrant high priority for supplemental vaccination. At the district level, we found six districts (Mangochi, Kasungu, Nkhata Bay, Mwanza, Nkhotakota, and Dedza) with estimated vaccination coverage less than 80% (Fig. 4a) . To make a similar comparison, we mapped the six districts (Mangochi, Dedza, Lilongwe, and, Kasungu, Nkhotakota, and Blantyre) with the largest susceptible birth cohort (Fig. 4b) . Only 4 districts were among the 6 at highest risk with respect to both VC and susceptible birth cohort: Mangochi, Dedza, Kasungu, and Nkhotakota (Fig. 4c) . At the health facility polygon scale, we found 254 polygons with VC estimates less than 80% (Fig. 4d) . To make parallel comparisons, we mapped the 254 "target" polygons with the highest annual susceptible birth cohort per polygon area (Fig. 4e ) and the 258 (8 polygons had equal values) polygons with the highest values for R E (Fig. 4f) . The measurements of VC and susceptible birth cohort had similar spatial distribution, varying only slightly in the areas of Lilongwe and Mangochi. Mangochi had more target polygons when using VC to prioritize targets and Lilongwe had more target polygons when susceptible birth cohort was used to prioritize targets. Conversely, the distribution of R E differed greatly from that of VC and susceptible birth cohort. The highest R E values were in health facility polygons near Blantyre, Ntcheu, Lilongwe, and Mzimba whereas the highest values for VC and susceptible birth cohort were in the areas of Mangochi, Lilongwe, and Kasungu. The districts of Mangochi, Lilongwe, and Kasungu were prioritized by all three measurements at the health facility polygon scale (Fig. 4g ).
