The microscopic features of both patients were similar, apart from more extensive fi broproliferative changes in the lungs of patient 2. Both lungs of patient 1 showed features of diff use alveolar damage (fi gure 1A) and focal desquamation of epithelial cells into alveolar spaces without evidence of type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. In the lungs of patient 2, patchy foci of consolidated bronchopneumonia and areas of fi brosis were seen. We found variable numbers of macrophages in the alveoli (especially in patient 2), and moderate numbers of scattered neutrophils and rare lymphocytes in the interstitial spaces. Both patients had substantially depleted lymphoid tissue in the spleen, lymph nodes, and mucosal lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract. The liver in both patients had spotty necrosis. In both patients, we detected very low numbers of macrophages with haemophagocytosis in the spleen, lymph nodes, and liver. The kidneys showed extensive tubular necrosis. Other organ systems showed no pronounced histological changes, apart from hypertrophy in the thymus of patient 2. The placenta showed development appropriate for the length of gestation. We saw scattered foci of syncytiotrophoblast necrosis, sometimes with associated dystrophic calcifi cation. Whether this fi nding was induced virally or was the sole result of maternal shock is unclear. Acute necrotising deciduitis was detected focally, and regarded as consistent with maternal shock. Fetal tissues mostly showed no specifi c histopathological fi ndings, and development was also consistent with gestational age. However, sections of fetal lung showed oedema and very small numbers of scattered interstitial neutrophils, which raised the possibility of mild acute interstitial pneumonitis, although this appearance was notably less severe than that seen in patients 1 and 2 (webfi gure 1). Sense and antisense probes for in-situ hybridisation detected viral genomes focally in tissue samples from various organs (table 1). The two sets of probes (for In the respiratory tract, we detected positive signals in tracheal epithelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells (fi gures 1B and 1C, webfi gure 1). However, only an estimated 10-20% of epithelial cells in the trachea and about 5% of epithelial cells in the alveoli showed positive signals. Both bronchi and bronchioles were negative. Double labelling combining in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry with tubulin-β antibody showed that both ciliated (tubulin-β-postive) cells and non-ciliated (tubulin-β-negative) cells of the trachea had viral sequences (fi gure 1C, webfi gure 2). We also found putative basal cells to be infected. Double labelling with antibodies for cytokeratin and surfactant protein A showed that the positive alveolar cells were type II pneumocytes (webfi gures 1C and 1D). In-situ hybridisation showed no positive staining in endothelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, fi broblasts, or any other cell type in the lungs or blood. However, we found positive viral signals in the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells in hilar lymph nodes (fi gure 1D). Double labelling and consecutive sections showed that cells positive for in-situ hybridisation were T lymphocytes (ie, positive for CD3 and negative for CD68, CD20, and S100, webfi gure 3). Additionally, positive signals of intracytoplasmic viral sequences were present in mucosal epithelial cells of the small intestine (>50% in some intestinal segments, fi gure 1E). We also detected viral sequences in the cytoplasm (and to a much lesser extent in the nuclei) of brain cells from patient 2 (fi gure 1F, webfi gure 1). Double labelling with neural markers neurofi lament or neuron-specifi c enolase showed that these H5N1-positive cells were neurons (webfi gures 1O and 1P). Table 2 shows the topographic distribution of cells with positive signals from in-situ hybridisation. No positive signals were seen in the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, oesophagus, bone marrow, or stomach. Placental tissue samples showed a large number of infected cells in chorionic villi (webfi gure 4). Most positive cells were localised in the connective tissue core of these villi. These cells were confi rmed (by labelling with monoclonal antibodies to CD68 and PLAP in consecutive sections) to be Hofbauer cells but not syncytiotrophoblasts. A subgroup of the cells with positive signals was found in the periphery of chorionic villi (fi gure 1G), which morphologically resembled cytotrophoblastic cells and were confi rmed by immunostaining with E-cadherin antibody on consecutive sections. No positive signal was seen in syncytiotrophoblasts. In the fetus, in-situ hybridisation identifi ed viral sequences in the lungs, circulating mononuclear cells (webfi gure 1), and mononuclear cells in the liver (fi gure 1H). The latter cells were identifi ed as macrophages (Kupff er cells) by double labelling with antibody to CD68 (webfi gure 1). Both sense and antisense probes were Distribution of immunohistochemical staining (table 1) was consistent with that of in-situ hybridisation, apart from the absence of viral antigens in the intestines. Positive staining for nucleoprotein and haemagglutinin was detected in pneumocytes (fi gure 2A) and cytotrophoblasts and Hofbauer cells in the placenta (fi gure 2B) in patient 1; as well as in tracheal epithelial cells (fi gure 2C), the brain (fi gure 2D), and T lymphocytes in hilar lymph-node tissue (fi gure 2E) in patient 2. The fetus showed positive staining in bronchial epithelial cells, pneumocytes (fi gure 2F), and circulating mononuclear cells. Nucleoprotein was mainly detected in the nucleus and haemagglutinin in the cytoplasm. Negative controls validated the specifi city of the immunohistochemistry protocol (webfi gure 5).
