We have used the new Quascade system to implement distributed workflows for comparative phyloinformatics using different algorithms. Figures 1, 2 , and 3 show these workflows for distance-based algorithms, maximum parsimony algorithms and maximum likelihood algorithms, respectively. The workflows use ClustalW [10] to compute multiple sequence alignments and different phylogenetic algorithms from the PHYLIP package [4] . The most compute-intensive parts of each workflow (i.e. ProtDist in Figure 1 , ProtPars in Figure 2 , and ProtML in Figure 3 ) are executed in a distributed computing environment by simply multiplexing the data and using several instances of the respective programs. Figures 4 and 5 show execution times of the workflows for varying numbers of processors and sequences. In summary it can be seen that the system can achieve linear speedups. We have used the designed workflows for the phyloinformatics analysis of NA in different populations of H5N1 in particular and in influenza viruses in general. The reason for choosing a protein-based phyloinformatics approach instead of a gene-based approach is to gain a better understanding of the molecular evolution of the gene product that makes this deadly virus spreading across different hosts. To perform this study, three protein data sets have been collected as follows.
