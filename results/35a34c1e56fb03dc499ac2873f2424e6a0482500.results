A total of 1,997 nurses from 26 states completed the survey. The overall response rate was 21.9%, although it was 50.2% among states who sent a recruitment e-mail to their members (as opposed to posting a link to the survey on their Web site or sending the link via a newsletter). The majority of nurses (61.8%; n ¼ 1,228) reported covering only a single school. Among nurses who cover only one school, 41.3% (n ¼ 413) worked in an elementary school, 36.5% (n ¼ 440) worked in a high school, and 21.0% (n ¼ 253) worked in a middle school; only 1.2% (n ¼ 14) provided care to college or university students. Of those nurses who reported covering multiple schools (38.2%, n ¼ 769), most (40.1%, n ¼ 304) covered 2 schools, with a range of 2 to 86 schools covered. The study group was predominately female (99.1%; n ¼ 1,980) and Caucasian (94.8%; n ¼ 1,894). Nurses of all ages and with all educational levels participated, but the largest group of responders (48.2%; n ¼ 963) were aged 51-60 years and had a Bachelor's degree (40.9%; n ¼ 817); only 3.8% (n ¼ 76) were nurse practitioners (NPs). More than half (59.5%; n ¼ 1,188) self-identified as a school nurse in a nonadministrative or lead nurse role, and as a member of her school/district disaster planning committee (57.7%; n ¼ 1,153).
