GILT is expressed in lung epithelial cells and upregulated by IFN-γ GILT is synthesized as a precursor of 35-kDa soluble glycoprotein [15] . After sorting into endocytic compartments and lysosome, the N-and C-terminal propeptides are processed to produce a 30-kDa mature form protein [16] . As the only identified lysosomal thiol reductase that reduces the disulphide bonds of endocytosed antigens to facilitate their unfolding or degradation, GILT is constitutively expressed in multiple professional APCs [15, 16] . However, the expression of GILT in other cell types, especially lung epithelia cells, is still unknown. To address this question, we assessed GILT expression in human lung cancer cell lines A549 and MRC-5 fibroblast cells. We found that both A549 and MRC-5 cells constitutively expressed GILT ( Figure 1A) . However, IFN-γ, but not IFN-α, dose-dependently induced GILT expression in both cell lines ( Figure 1A) . Consistent with that observed in professional APCs, microscopy studies revealed that GILT co-localizes with late endosome marker Rab9 and lysosome marker LAMP1, but not EEA1, an early endosome marker ( Figure 1B) . GILT inhibits viral entry mediated by envelope glycoproteins of SARS-CoV, Ebola virus and Lassa fever virus GILT facilitates the unfolding of internalized proteins containing disulphide bonds in lysosomes [37, 38] , the reduction of disulphide bonds in envelope glycoproteins of incoming virions by GILT may result in GP degradation or interrupt the GP-mediated membrane fusion and consequentially inhibit virus entry. To test this hypothesis, we established FLP-IN T Rex 293 cell line that expresses human GILT in a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible manner and determined its effects on the entry mediated by envelope GP from a panel of enveloped viruses, including five human coronaviruses (HCoVs), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1 and murine leukaemia viruses (MLV). Tet treatment efficiently induced GILT expression, as judged by Western blot ( Figure  2A ) and immunofluorescence staining assays ( Figure  2B ). Interestingly, only the infection by lentiviral particles pseudotyped with spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARSpp) was significantly inhibited by GILT expression ( Figure 2C ). Considering that GILT is mainly localized in lysosomes and the SARS-CoV enters into the cytoplasm of host cells via lysosomes [26], we speculated that GILT may not restrain the viral entry that occurs at plasma membrane or early/late endosomes, but only impede the virus entry in lysosome. We thus further examined whether GILT could inhibit the entry of EBOV and LASV that enter cells in lysosomes [29, 39, 40] . To this end, A459 cells stably expressing ACE2, the receptor of SARS-CoV, were transduced with retroviruses expressing GILT or empty retrovector pQCXIP as a control, respectively. The expression of GILT in transduced A549 cells was at a level comparable to that induced by IFN-γ treatment ( Figure 2D ). As shown in Figure 2 (E), both IFN-γ treatment and expression of GILT in A549 cells significantly inhibited the infection by Blam-Vpr lentiviral particles pseudotyped with envelope glycoprotein from EBOV, LASV and SARS-CoV. However, while IFN-γ treatment significantly inhibited Blam-Vpr lentiviral particles pseudotyped with IAV hemagglutinin 1 (H1) and neuraminidase (N1), expression of GILT did not, suggesting that other ISG(s) mediate IFN-γ suppression of IAV entry.
