Considering that autochthonous cases had been rarely reported for the past 70 years in Japan [4, 5] , the dengue outbreak which resulted in a number of domesticallyinfected patients in 2014 was surprising. According to the Ministry of Health in Japan [24], a total of 161 autochthonous cases were confirmed in 2014. Figure 1 shows a list of provinces where at least one domestic case was reported during 2014 in Japan. The total number of domestic cases in 2014 was by far the highest in Tokyo, with 108 confirmed episodes, followed by Kanagawa, Saitama, and Chiba provinces. Figure 2 shows the CRF index and the number of reported dengue cases over time in Tokyo, Japan. The number of imported cases had been consistently reported from 2006 to 2016 in Tokyo, but the total number of imported cases generally remained low, with the highest number being 19 cases in September 2013. In the case of domestic episodes, no patient had been reported in Tokyo before 2014 (except one in 2006), but there was a dramatic increase in the number of autochthonous dengue patients during the summer of 2014 when the outbreak occurred. Given that the number of imported dengue cases in 2014 was not much higher than the numbers reported in other years, this epidemic was not thought to be solely caused by the influx of dengue viruses into Tokyo from travelers. Looking at the trend of the CRF index over time in Tokyo, it can be a All the climate raster files were resampled into 0.008 by 0.008 degree resolution by taking the nearest-neighbor assignments [2] b Due to data limitations, the night lights in 2013 was assumed to be consistent in 2014-2017, as the population density would not dramatically change during a short period of time [2] Fig . 1 The number of domestic cases by province during 2014 in Japan observed that the CRF index reached its peak during the same period, potentially indicating the impact of the changes in climate and non-climate factors on a large surge of infected dengue patients. The rising trend of the CRF index in 2014 was different also from other years. In Tokyo, temperature and humidity generally hit their highest levels during the summer season and go down from September to February. Though the same patterns were observed over the discrete monthly values in 2013, the CRF index did not fall even after the summer season and instead continued to rise throughout the winter until the early summer of 2014. This is because the winter of 2013 to 2014 was warmer and more humid than the winter of 2012 to 2013, leading to the increasing trend of the 12 month-moving averages for temperature and humidity. More importantly, a substantial drop in precipitation, which is negatively associated with dengue incidence, was observed throughout the first-half of 2014 and contributed to the overall increase of the CRF index. Combining all, transmission probability between hosts and vectors may have been escalated and prolonged in this densely populated city due in part to the more favorable environmental conditions for vector survival. The geographical variation of the CRF index was further estimated at the 5 km by 5 km resolution during the epidemic period in Japan, and is shown in Fig. 3a. At the provincial-level (Fig. 3b) , high-risk areas for dengue fever were the Eastern part of Tokyo and Kanakawa, the South-Eastern part of Saitama, and the North-Western part of Chiba. These areas exactly correspond to the top four provinces where the majority of autochthonous cases were identified in Fig. 1 . Small fractions of the Southern part of Shizuoka and Aichi also appear to be high-risk areas. Previously, Kutuna et al. (2015) [5] followed up on a subset of domestically-infected cases during the 2014 epidemic in Tokyo and found that 15 out of 19 patients were bitten by mosquitoes during their visits to Yoyogi Park, and the rest of the patients visited Shinjuku Central Park, Meiji-Jingu Shrine, Meiji-Jingu Gaien, and Ueno Park. The CRF index in Fig. 3c clearly indicates that all five public parks were at the greatest risk in 2014. Figure 4 demonstrates potential disease hotspots during the summer of 2017 using the most recent climateand non-climate datasets. In Japan, while the Southern part of Shizuoka and Aichi provinces is no longer at high risk in 2017, the other four aforementioned provinces still appear to be high-risk areas for dengue fever. In general, the risk levels for dengue outbreaks are lower in South Korea than in Japan. Nonetheless, the following locations in South Korea were identified as high-risk areas in the case that dengue viruses start circulating: Dongnae, Yeonje, Busanjin, Suyeong, and Haeundae in Busan; the Western part of Ulsan; Gunsan; the Southern part of Muan; the Northern and Southern parts of Jeju island. In particular, both Busan and Jeju are popular tourist destinations among domestic and international travelers including those from dengue-endemic countries. It should be noted that the central and Western parts of Seoul are also at risk, although the city is not at the highest risk-level.
