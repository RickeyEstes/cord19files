No differences emerged between Edinburgh and London in the characteristics of the patients studied, nor in the meteorological data obtained throughout the study. Therefore the findings from the two centres have been combined. The study lasted 28 months. The total period of observation was 695 patient-months. The duration of observation of individual patients ranged between two and 27 months: in 53% of patients it was more than 20 months, and in 79% more than 12 months. Patients were seen for monthly follow-up on 636 occasions. Exacerbations were reported on 116 occasions, 79 of which were notified within three days of the onset of symptoms. On 37 other occasions when patients attended for routine follow-up they reported that since their last attendance they had had symptoms which fulfilled our criteria of an exacerbation. These 'missed' exacerbations were not notified for a variety of reasons, such as absence on holiday, the imminence of their next routine attendance or the wish to avoid troubling their doctors (although they were reminded at every routine attendance to report any new symptoms at once).
