Overview of lncRNA profiles. Based on the lncRNAs expression profiles, a number of differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified between the CTEPH and healthy control samples. The expression profiles of lncRNAs in the paired samples were determined by calculating the log fold change of CTEPH/control samples. Due to the limited sample size, FDR and P-values were calculated from normalized expression levels. Hundreds of differentially expressed human lncRNAs were identified using the RefSeq (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq), Ensembl (www.ensembl.org), lncRNAdb (www.lncrnadb.org), Broad Institute, Human Body Map lincRNAs (www.broadinstitute. org/genome_bio/human_lincrnas/) and transcripts of uncertain coding potential catalog (http://www.broadinstitute.org/ genome_bio/human_lincrnas/?q=TUCP_transcripts_catalog) databases in the CTEPH patients and healthy controls. Using the microarray data, the expression levels of lncRNAs in the five CTEPH tissue samples were compared with the matched normal tissue samples. In total, 185 lncRNAs were identified in which the expression levels were found Table II . Collection of the top ten deregulated lncRNAs detected using microarray analysis in ten CTEPH and control samples. to be significantly different between the two groups. The characteristics of the five CTEPH patients and five normal controls are shown in Table I . The procedure used to obtain a sequence may vary depending on the database used for lncRNA classification. While tens of thousands lncRNAs were investigated in normal and diseased tissues, only a few hundreds lncRNAs were found to be significantly upregulated or downregulated. Thus, the upregulation or downregulation of lncRNAs was used to distinguish the CTEPH patient tissues from healthy tissues (Fig. 1 ). Compared with normal tissues, NR_033766 was the most evidently downregulated lncRNA, whereas TCONS_l2_00010131-XLOC_l2_005462 was upregulated to the greatest degree (Table II) . Therefore, downregulated lncRNAs were shown to be more prevalent compared with upregulated lncRNAs in the CTEPH group. Overview of mRNA profiles. In total, â‰¤30,654 coding transcripts were detected in the ten samples that were examined. Using the RVM t-test method, 880 genes were found to be upregulated and 734 genes were found to be downregulated in the CTEPH samples, compared with the healthy controls. The results supported the hypothesis that CTEPH is a metabolic disease as the mRNA expression level of oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 showed the greatest upregulation, while the mRNA expression level of chordin-like 1 showed the greatest downregulation. Therefore, upregulation of mRNA expression levels was more prevalent compared with downregulation in the CTEPH group.
