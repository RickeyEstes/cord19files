CD200R promotes MCMV persistence in the salivary glands MCMV replicates in numerous organs, including the spleen, liver and lungs, during acute infection, prior to dissemination to the salivary glands (SGs), in which MCMV replicates for 1-2 months [27, 28] . We hypothesized that CD200R signaling may facilitate MCMV replication in vivo. To test this, wild type C57BL/6 (wt) and CD200R -/mice were infected with MCMV and virus load measured. Peak acute MCMV replication at day 4 post-infection (pi) in the spleen (Fig. 1A) and liver ( Fig. 1B) was unaltered by CD200R deficiency. However, CD200R -/mice exhibited a reduced burden of replicating virus (Fig. 1A) in the spleen 7 days pi. We next investigated whether CD200R promoted MCMV persistence. In our model, replicating virus is first detectable in the SGs at day 7 pi. Virus load in wt and CD200R -/mice day 7 pi was comparable (Fig. 1C) , suggesting that improved antiviral control in spleens of CD200R -/mice ( Fig. 1A ) did not influence dissemination to the SGs and associated brown fat in which MCMV replicates at this time-point [29] . Crucially, however, CD200R -/mice restricted persistent MCMV replication in the SGs 14 days pi, and more CD200R -/mice cleared MCMV by day 33 pi as compared to wt controls (Fig. 1C) . Thus, intact CD200R during chronic infection promoted virus persistence within this mucosal organ.
