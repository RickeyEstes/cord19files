The process of exchanging data electronically is iterative and is initiated with numerous rounds of message testing and varying gradation of technical assistance based on data submitter need and capabilities. Each step in the process was deemed critical in its impact on the quality of data which moves across clinical sector and public health. Table 1 lists the six identified key processes for ELR onboarding, relevant sub-processes/notes and their influence including both DQ metric and DQ dimension. All DQ metrics (Intrinsic DQ, Contextual DQ, Representational DQ, and Accessibility DQ) were impacted with varying influence on DQ dimensions. Some errors such as improper mapping on EHR end had a cascading effect and can pass through technical filters and go undetected till use of data by epidemiologists. Some DQ dimensions such as accuracy, relevancy, value-added data and interpretability are more dependent on users at either end of the data exchange spectrum, the relevant clinical groups and the public health program professionals. The results from analysis of data in MEDSS by various criteria identified by the informatics team is presented in Table 3 . Evaluation for cases which are not mapped to any disease program and assigned to "other/unknown" category yielded 952 cases. Assessment of messages for these cases noted an absence of LOINC and/or SNOMED codes and their combination pair for disease assignment. Next, the analysis focused on submission of non-reportable respiratory diseases along with reportable conditions (Influenza) due to issues with special lab test panel, and this identified 366 cases. This was followed by evaluating the number of incoming messages which get rejected due to errors and there currently isn't any process that keeps track of it. The corresponding impact on data quality metrics due to these identified issues are also presented in Table 3 . An enhancement was implemented in January 2018 to import demographic data (race, ethnicity) from ELR feeds and this evaluation presented in Table 4 . Of the total of 3,651 electronic lab messages received from January through February 2018, data on Race was present in 2,310 messages and 1,680 messages received in that time frame had data on Ethnicity. Comparison of this new data with already existing race and ethnicity data in MEDSS obtained through case reporting and follow-up investigations revealed 270 number of messages wherein race from ELR feed was different than one currently recorded in MEDSS.
