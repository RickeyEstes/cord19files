Determination of the PVP-I kinetics with low and high protein load using the new European test virus for virucidal efficacy against enveloped viruses (MVA) The test concentrations and contact periods were chosen in order to observe the point at which each test preparation produced efficient virus inactivation. To demonstrate virucidal efficacy, disinfectant and antiseptic products are required to produce a log 10 reduction in virus titre of at least 4 [7] . The log 10 reduction factors produced by each test product under clean and dirty conditions at each time point are shown in Table 1 . Viral titres of MVA were reduced by >99.99 % to > 99.999 % under clean and dirty conditions after application of undiluted and 1:10 dilutions of 10 % PVP-I solution, 7.5 % PVP-I surgical scrub and 4 % PVP-I skin cleanser for as little as 15 s. The 3.2 % PVP-I/alcohol solution had a similar effect, except under dirty conditions at the 1:10 dilution for 15 s, when the reduction factor was 3 (99.9 % reduction). Under both clean and dirty conditions, a concentrationdependent virucidal activity was seen with the PVP-I only products (Table 1) . Under dirty conditions, the minimum concentration of PVP-I needed for a 4 log 10 reduction of MVA was 5.3 times higher at a 30 s contact time (0.4 g/L versus 0.075 g/L) and 4 times higher at a 15 s contact time (0.4 g/L versus 0.1 g/L), than under clean conditions ( Table 1) .
