The phylogenetic analysis presented in Fig. 2 shows the nsp12, S, and N trees obtained by a maximum likelihood method. Two clusters, one grouping BCoVs and BCoVs-like and the other one containing HCoV-OC43s, are observed in the nsp12 and N trees. DcCoVs differentiates as a potential third cluster on the S tree. The BCoV cluster of the nsp12, S, and N maximum likelihood trees is divided into three sub-clusters. These sub-clusters are globally comprised of by the same molecular isolates for nsp12, S, and N trees. Nsp12, S, and N produced comparable tree topologies and therefore a globally congruent phylogenetic signal that does not suggest BCoV recombination events, contrary to HCoV-OC43 during the same period and in the same geographic area (Kin et al., 2015) . The positions of BCoV and BCoV-like sequences on each tree are summarized in Table S2 (supplementary material) . According to nsp12, S, and N trees, one sub-cluster named C 1 contains BCoVs and BCoVs-like from the USA, constituting the genotype C 1 C 1 C 1 . A second sub-cluster, named C 2 , groups on each trees all the BCoV sequences generated in this study defining the genotype C 2 C 2 C 2 . Finally, the last sub-cluster, named C 3 , contains the prototype strains Kakegawa, Mebus, Quebec, and CrCoV on all trees, constituting the genotypes C 3 C 3 C 3 . Two exceptions are observed. First, the three DcCoVs are included on sub-cluster C 2 on nsp12 and N tree, but are grouped in a potential outlier position from BCoV and HCoV-OC43 clusters, constituting a genotype named C 2 C OUTLIER C 2 . The second exception is the HEC 4408 that is located on sub-cluster C 3 on nsp12 and N trees, and in sub-clusters C 2 on S tree, constituting the genotype C 3 C 2 C 3 . This analysis reveals a potential geographical distribution with a segregation of BCoV and BCoV-like sequences from US on one hand, and BCoV from France in another hand. An additional S tree, depicted in Fig. S4 (supplementary material), includes additional BCoV and BCoV-like sequences from the USA, Brazil, South Korea, China, Sweden, Denmark, and Italy. The topology of this additional S tree is concordant with the S tree presented in Fig. 2 . The same tree clusters (BCoV and BCoV-like, HCoV-OC43, and DcCoV) were observed. In the same way, the three sub-clusters C 1 , C 2 , and C 3 were observed inside to the BCoV cluster. The additional sequences include in this most detailed S tree allowed us to deeply characterize the geographic distribution of BCoV and BCoV-like. Indeed, in addition to USA sequences, the sub-cluser C 1 contains BCoVs and BCoVs-like from both America and Asia continent, more precisely from China, South Korea, and Brazil. The sub-cluster C 2 contains in addition to the 14 French BCoVs, 35 additional BCoVs from other European countries such as Sweden, Denmark, and Italy (cf. Tables S2 and S3 in supplementary material).
