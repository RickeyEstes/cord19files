Of 5,662 participants in the ILI 002 study, 486 met the eligibility criteria for this analysis (77 controls, 44 with mild exacerbations, and 365 with severe exacerbations). Characteristics of study participants are given in Table 1 . Those with severe exacerbations were older and more likely to be overweight or obese and to delay seeking medical care. Among all participants with asthma, 64.0% were found to have 1 or more viral infections ( Table 1 ). The most common viral infections were rhinovirus (29.4%), influenza A (13.2%), and coronavirus (10.1%). There was no difference in the type or number of viral infections when comparing those with severe infection and those without exacerbation. Univariate analyses of ILI symptoms are included in Table 2 . Overall, patients with severe exacerbations reported fewer ILI symptoms compared with those with no exacerbation. Cases were more likely to report cough with phlegm (76.7% vs 57.1%) and less likely to report muscle pain (32.6% vs 55.8%), eye symptoms (32.9% vs 53.3%), gastrointestinal symptoms (14.0% vs 33.8%), and sore throat (17.5% vs 49.4%). Overall, cases had more radiologic findings than controls, with the most common finding being abnormal air collection and rib or diaphragm flattening (31.5% vs 1.3%); because of the large number of missing data, results should be interpreted with caution, and no further analysis was conducted. Those with severe exacerbations were more likely to have leukocytosis (64.9% vs 23.4%), neutrophilia (80.3% vs 57.1%), and lymphocytopenia (81.1% vs 46.8%) compared with those without exacerbations ( Table 2 ). No differences were observed in creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels. On the basis of univariate associations, 10 variables were identified to be assessed individually with multivariate logistic regressions (Table 3 ). In unadjusted analysis, being overweight or Laboratory references are as follows: leukocytes, greater than 10 Ã‚ 10 3 cells/mm 3 ; neutrophil, greater than 62%; lymphocytes, less than 20%; CPK, greater than 308 IU/L for males and greater than 192 IU/L for women; LDH, greater than 192 IU/L; and C-reactive protein, greater than 0.8 g/dL. obese increased the risk of severe exacerbations. However, after adjusting for age, sex, and current smoke exposure, the association was no longer significant (odds ratio [ , and a sore throat (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.14-0.43) were less likely to experience a severe exacerbation. Finally, compared with those who sought medical attention within 0 to 1 days of symptom onset, patients who delayed 2 to 3 days (OR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.46-5.88) and 4 or more days (OR, 5.32; 95% CI, 2.18-12.98) were at increased risk for a severe exacerbation. After stepwise modeling of the 14 symptoms and 5 demographic variables (Fig 1) , 5 key were identified: Cough with phlegm and delay in seeking medical care were associated with higher odds for severe asthma exacerbation, whereas muscle pain and nasal drip were associated with reduced odds.
