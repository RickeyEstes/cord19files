CpG adjuvant improves efficacy of Fluzone 1 vaccine to H1N1 challenge in young adult mice A group of young adult C57BL/6 mice (6-8 weeks; n = 5-8) was vaccinated with a commercial influenza vaccine, Fluzone (FZ). Analysis of serum 4 weeks post vaccination showed that H1N1 specific IgG was detectable; however, no hemagglutination inhibition activity (HAI <5) was observed (Table 1) . When challenged with H1N1 A/California/09 influenza virus, these mice experienced weight loss similar to unvaccinated controls ( Fig 1A) and 100% mortality ( Fig 1B) . We wanted to investigate whether a well characterized innate immune TLR9 agonist (CpG) could improve the immunogenicity and the efficacy of FZ in this model. Four weeks after immunization, young adult mice immunized with FZ+CpG had H1N1 specific IgG titres over 3 times greater compared to FZ alone (Table 1 ) and had detectable HAI activity equivalent to a 16 fold increase post vaccination (HAI = 80) ( Table 1 ). This increased serum IgG and HAI activity was associated with a decrease in peak weight loss following infection followed by full recovery (Fig 1A) , with improved clinical scores as judged by increased activity and less fur ruffling (data not shown). Furthermore, mortality in the unvaccinated and unadjuvanted (FZ) groups reached 100% following infection compared to only 20% in the adjuvanted (FZ+CpG) group (Fig 1B) . CpG adjuvant fails to improve efficacy of Fluzone 1 vaccine to H1N1 challenge in aged mice Similar to young adult mice, aged mice (18-24 months; n = 5-8) vaccinated with FZ had positive anti-H1N1 IgG titres 4 weeks after immunization compared to unvaccinated mice, but no detectable HAI activity (Table 1) . However, unlike young adult mice, the addition of a CpG adjuvant (FZ+CpG) did not show either an increase in Influenza A virus (IAV) specific IgG titre or HAI activity when compared to FZ alone (Table 1) . Vaccinated aged mice did show slightly lower weight loss at each time point compared to unvaccinated controls following influenza infection (Fig 1C) . Despite this, both vaccinated and unvaccinated aged mice succumbed to H1N1 infection with 100% mortality in those groups (Fig 1D) . Since the adjuvanted vaccine was partially protective in young adult mice but ineffective at preventing influenza mortality in aged mice, it confirmed that age related differences in influenza vaccination efficacy seen in young and aged human subjects could be modeled in mice.
