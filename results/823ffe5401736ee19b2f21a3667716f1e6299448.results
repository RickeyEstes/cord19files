The treatment groups with the respective number of litters and piglets and the survival rates of piglets far-rowed during the 14 day study period are listed in Table 1 greater (PC 0.05 ) survival rates (50.7% and 49% respectively) than piglets given placebo (41.9%). Survival data were analyzed by age at treatment ( Table 2 ). The 367 piglets from 44 litters which were 13-20 days old at the time of first treatment had a significantly greater (P~O.001) survival rate (94.6%) than newborn piglets (33.4%). The 311 piglets, which were l-l 2 days old when first treated, were probably exposed to TGEV within the first 8 days of age; regardless of treatment, these piglets had a mean survival rate of 35.4%. A similarly low overall survival rate (33.4%) was observed in 1062 newborn piglets from 107 litters in which treatment was begun on the day of farrowing. These piglets were likely exposed to TGEV at birth. The mean litter sizes for the three age groups ( 13-20 days, l-12 days, or newborns) were 10.4, 10.4, and 10.5, respectively. However, because some piglets died before the treatment began, the mean treated litter sizes were 8.3,6.0 and 9.9 piglets, for 13-20 days, 1-12 days and newborns respectively. Survival of piglets within the 1-12 day age group was favorably affected by treatment. For piglets 1-12 days old, nHuIFNa increased survival rate from 15.2% (placebo) to 50.0% (20.0 IU nHuIFNa); all dosages of nHuIFNa improved survival rates (P~0.01). In contrast, oral nHuIFNa! treatment of newborn piglets did not significantly improve survival rates compared with placebo treatment.
