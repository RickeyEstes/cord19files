A total of 230 children with radiologically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia (cases) were enrolled during the study period. Of these, 120 (52%) were male and 147 (64%) aged ≤ 5 years; the median age was 38 months (IQR: 19, 81). Twenty-one (9%) cases were Aboriginal. Of the 230 cases, 210 (91%) had received at least 2 doses of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Demographics and existing or ever diagnosed with co-morbidities of the enrolled children are summarized in Table 1 . The median length of hospitalization was 2 days (IQR: 1, 3) and all children were discharged with no deaths. At hospital presentation, 38 (17%) cases had blood oxygen saturation (SPO 2 ) level ≤ 92% and tachypnoea observed in 88 (38%). Nearly half of cases (109/230) received antibiotics in the 7 days prior to hospital presentation and all but three (227/230, 99%) received antibiotics during hospital stay. Twenty-four cases were diagnosed with pleural effusion and of these, 21 (88%) had pleural fluid drained: all 21 had microscopic purulence consistent with empyema. There were 30 (13%) cases of definite bacterial pneumonia: 9 with bacteraemia, 15 with empyema, and 6 with both bacteraemia and empyema. Of the 21 pleural fluid samples from empyema cases, 1 was culture and PCR positive, and 9 were PCR positive (only) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 each cultured methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pyogenes; and 1 sample was PCR positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. At least one respiratory virus was detected in NPS of 12 of the 30 cases with definite bacterial pneumonia. Of the remaining 200 cases, at least one virus was detected in nasopharyngeal swab from 118 (59%) cases including 98 with co-detection of respiratory bacteria. Among these 118 presumed viral pneumonia cases, 43 (36%) had RSV detected, 31 (26%) had rhinovirus, 21 (18%) had HMPV, 15 (13%) had influenza and 9 (8%) each had adenovirus and parainfluenza. No virus was detected in the nasopharyngeal swabs of 82 (41%) cases (other pneumonia) including 51 had detectable respiratory bacteria on NPS. The distribution of bacteria detected in NPS in three case groups of pneumonia are presented in Additional file 1: Table S1 . The distribution of bacteria in NPS in three case groups were similar. Among cases in three groups, 53% of definite bacterial pneumonia cases, 40% of presumed viral pneumonia cases and 56% of other pneumonia cases received antibiotics before hospitalization. The clinical features of cases and medical interventions are summarized in Table 2 . Few differences in clinical symptoms and signs were observed across the different groups (Table 2 ). Fever (defined as temperature ≥ 38.0°C) was more frequently observed in definite bacterial pneumonia than in presumed viral (p = 0.002) or other pneumonia cases (p < 0.001). Rhinorrhoea was more frequent in presumed viral pneumonia than in either definite bacterial pneumonia (p < 0.001) or other pneumonia cases (p < 0.001). Age-specific tachypnoea was also more common in presumed viral pneumonia than in definite bacterial (p = 0.08) or other pneumonia cases (p = 0.003). More definite bacterial pneumonia cases required intravenous fluid therapy than presumed viral (p = 0.02) or other pneumonia cases (p = 0.001). Furthermore, more than half (53%) of definite bacterial cases required both supplemental O 2 and intravenous fluid, substantially higher than presumed viral (32%; p = 0.03) or other pneumonia cases (23%, p = 0.002) ( Table 2 ). Definite bacterial pneumonia cases also had a greater median length of hospital stay (6.5 days, 9 days with empyema and 2 days without) than presumed viral (2 days) or other pneumonia (2 days) (p < 0.001 for each). The mean RISC severity score was 1.2 (range: 0, 5) for definite bacterial cases, compared to 1.0 (− 2, 5) for presumed viral and 0.8 (− 2, 4) for other pneumonia cases, respectively. The median blood CRP concentration was more than 6 times higher in definite bacterial cases than in presumed viral (174 versus 24 mg/L; p < 0.001) and other pneumonia cases (174 versus 27 mg/L; p < 0.001). The CRP, WCC and ANC did not vary significantly between presumed viral and other pneumonia cases and between empyema and bacteraemia cases ( Table 2 , Additional file 1: Table S2 ). The blood biomarker values did not vary significantly between presumed viral cases with different viral pathogens detected (data not shown). •Immunodeficiency a 7 (3.0) •immunocompromised condition 5 (2.1) •congenital abnormality b 17 (7.3) •chronic respiratory illness 9 (3.9) •chronic neuromuscular disorder illness 9 (3.9) •Other c 1 (0.4) a: IgG subclass deficiency (n = 1); Low IgA (n = 1); T-cell deficiency (n = 1), Mannose-binding lectin deficiency (n = 2), DiGeorge's syndrome (n = 2) b: Capillary malfunction syndrome (n = 1); Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and congenital hypothoroidism (n = 2); Atrioventricular septal defect (n = 1); Down syndrome (n = 3); Sotos syndrome (n = 1); Spinal muscular atrophy type 2 (n = 1); Developmental delay (n = 1); Congenital heart disease (n = 2); Prader Willi syndrome (n = 1); Congenital sensorineural deafness (n = 1); Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (n = 1); Gasroschisis (n = 1); Cleft lip (n = 1); c: Intracranial shunt (n = 1) The AUC for CRP was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.91) for discriminating definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonia (Fig. 1a) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.89) for discriminating definite bacterial from presumed viral plus other pneumonias (Fig. 1b) . For WCC, the AUCs were 0.63 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.74) and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.76) for discriminating definite bacterial from presumed viral plus others pneumonias, and definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonia, respectively (Additional file 2: Figure S1a, 1b) . For ANC, the AUCs were 0.68 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.78) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.58-0.79) for discriminating definite bacterial from presumed viral plus other pneumonias, and definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonias, respectively (Additional file 2: Figure S2a , 2b). Based on these AUCs, we further assessed the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV at CRP cut-offs of ≥ 40 mg/L, ≥ 60 mg/L and ≥ 100 mg/L, for differentiating bacterial from presumed viral plus other pneumonias, and definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonias (Additional file 1: Table S3 ). CRP ≥ 40 mg/L, CRP ≥ 60 mg/L and CRP ≥ 100 mg/L cut-off had sensitivity of 83, 75 and 67%, respectively for differentiating definite bacterial pneumonia from presumed viral pneumonias. From the Youden index, the optimal CRP threshold of ≥72 mg/L was found to discriminate definite bacterial from presumed viral plus other pneumonias with sensitivity 75% (95% CI: 55, 89), specificity 82% (95% CI: 76, 87), PPV 38% and NPV 96%; for discriminating definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonias the sensitivity was 75% (95% CI: 55, 89), specificity 84% (95% CI: 76, 90), PPV 53% and NPV 93% (Table 3 ). Significant differences in symptoms and signs were then included to assess the impact on the diagnostic performance of the algorithm (Table 3 ; Additional file 1: Table S3 ). The combination of CRP (≥72 mg/L) with either the presence of fever or absence of rhinorrhea, improved the The PPV for the combination (CRP ≥72 mg/L + fever) and (CRP ≥72 mg/L + absence of rhinorrhea) was 48 and 59% for discriminating definite bacterial from presumed viral plus other pneumonia, and was 63 and 87%, respectively, for discriminating definite bacterial from presumed viral pneumonia, respectively (Table 3 ).
