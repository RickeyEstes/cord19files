The figure shows the exacerbation rates before and during the study for the two groups of patients. The exacerbation rates of both groups fell during the study: recipients mean 1-79 (SEM 0-17) to 0-76 (0-15) per year; controls 1-98 (0-21) to 1-48 (0-17) per year. However, the change was significantly greater in the recipients than in the controls ( 1-02 v 0 &deg; 51 exacerbations per year: p < 0-04). The greater reduction in rate in recipients compared with controls was consistently observed at all three centres. The mean prestudy rates of the recipients and controls were nearly identical, but the recipients' mean rate during the study was significantly lower than that of the controls Interferon Placebo Mean exacerbation rates (exacerbations/year) before and during the study in 34 recipients and 35 controls with MS. Vertical bars represent 2SEM; Alfn is reduction in recipient rates and .6 Pla reduction in placebo controls during study. (p<0'001). Correlation analysis revealed that the exacerbation rate during the study was strongly dependent on and directly proportional to the prestudy rate in the controls (r=0'51, p<0001), but not in the recipients (r = 0-02, p=045). Clinically, 26 recipients (76-5%) and 21 controls (60%) were improved or unchanged, and 8 recipients (23-5%) and 14 controls (40%) were worse at the end of the study. The extent of deterioration was greatest in the controls (mean modified Kurtzke score increases: controls 0-80, recipients 0-32). However, this trend (recipients clinically stable or better; controls clinically worse) was not statistically significant (chi-square p = 0-23). Side-effects of treatment (headache, nausea, myalgia, lethargy) occurred with comparable frequency in recipients and controls, which may be attributed, at least partly, to the efficacy of indomethacin in reducing IFN-B side-effects. Low-grade fevers (mean 38-2&deg;C) occurred more often in recipients (75%) than in controls (31 %) (chi-square p < 0&deg;001), but this did not break the double-blinding (see above). Pleocytosis and rises in CSF protein occurred in recipients during treatment. The maximum pleocytosis (mean 1-22x10/1, range 0-12-5-66 x 10$/1) and rise in protein (mean 590 mg/1, range 240-1600 mg/1) were noted during the first 5 weeks of treatment. At the last treatment (6 months), mean pleocytosis was 0-25 x 108/1 (range 0-02-1-88 x 10$/1) and mean CSF protein 460 mgjl (range 150-1600 mg/1). At 2 years, mean pleocytosis was 0-16 x 108/1 (range 0-01-0-61 x 108/1) and the mean CSF protein was 460 mg/1 (range 150-1600 mg/1).
