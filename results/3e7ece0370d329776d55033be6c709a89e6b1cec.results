The Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV interacted with pRb The conserved LxCxE motif is a key feature for viral proteins that bind to pRb (Dahiya et al., 2000) . We aligned the amino acid sequences of the Nsp9 among 17 representative strains of genotype 2 PRRSV and found that the Nsp9 of all the analyzed viruses shared an identical LxCxE motif-LACAE (Table 2) . To analyze whether the Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV interacts with pRb through the LACAE motif, the recombinant lentiviruses that were expressing Nsp9-GFP, Nsp9 (L415A/C417A)-GFP and Nsp9 (E419K)-GFP were constructed. MARC-145 cells were transduced with the lentiviruses and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP mAb, and were then detected with an anti-pRb mAb by Co-IP assay. The GFP-expressing lentiviruses were used as the control. As shown in Fig. 1A , the endogenous pRb could be probed in the cells that were expressing Nsp9-GFP and Nsp9 (L415A/C417A)-GFP, whereas it could not be examined in the cells that were expressing Nsp9 (E419K)-GFP, indicating that Nsp9 interacts with pRb and the third conserved residue (E) of the LACAE motif plays a crucial role in sustaining the interaction between Nsp9 and pRb. To further confirm the interaction of Nsp9 with the exogenous pRb, HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with the Myc-pRb-tru-expressing plasmid together with the HA-Nsp9-, HA-Nsp9 (L415A/C417A)-or HA-Nsp9 (E419K)-expressing plasmids, and Co-IP assays were performed. The similar results were obtained (Fig. 1B) . Our results suggest that the LACAE motif indeed plays a critical role in the interaction between the viral Nsp9 and pRb. The Nsp9 of genotype 2 PRRSV co-localized with pRb in the cytoplasm To analyze the co-localization of Nsp9 and pRb, MARC-145 cells were co-transfected with pCMV-HA-Nsp9 and pCMV-Myc-pRbtru. The confocal immunofluorescence assays showed that Nsp9 primarily co-localized with pRb-tru in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 2A) , and the endogenous pRb also co-localized with Nsp9 in the cytoplasm of PRRSV-infected MARC-145 cells (
