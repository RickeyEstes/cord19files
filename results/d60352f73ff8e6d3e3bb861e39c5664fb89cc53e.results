In preliminary studies, no effects upon TGEV infectivity of either AmB or DOC separately were found at concentrations up to 5 fLg/ml. In the experiment using a concentration of 2 ug/ml of AmB or DOC alone, TOEV infectivity decreased as a function of incubation time, similar to controls. However, in the presence of fongizone, or of AmB plus DOC, the decrease in TOEV infectivity was clearly different from that of the controls ( fig. 1 ), suggesting that AmB and DOC have a virus-inactivating effect only when they are combined. Addition of fongizone, or of a combination of AmB plus DOC in agaroverlay medium, apparently did not affect the plaque number (data not shown), but the plaque size was found to be reduced proportionally to their concentrations ( fig. 2) . No difference in plaque formation was observed between the control and the experiment using DOC. However, AmB alone added in agar-overlay medium enhanced plaque formation. This enhancement was observed only in ST cells ( fig. 3) , not in RPD cells. As ethanol had been used to dissolve AmB, a control with ethanol added to the agar-overlay medium was performed which resulted in no variation in plaque numbers (data not shown). AmB or fongizone in the medium used for virus growth had no effect on either viral yield or on IFN production, as indicated by the similarity of virus and IFN titres between the experiment and the control (data not shown). However, AmB, when added with DEAE-dextran, induced virus replication from viral RNA, although the ratio of RNA titre vs. virus titre was about to-8 . However, no virus replication resulted when the RNA was diluted in other solutions (data not shown).
