All the inoculated pigs showed typical clinical symptoms, namely, sneezing and coughing. They also developed a high fever, and their average rectal temperature exceeded 40.0Â°C between PID 2 and 4. In contrast, control pigs exhibited no clinical symptoms throughout the experiment. The three groups infected with H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2-infected groups did not differ significantly in their clinical appearance that included sneezing, coughing, rectal temperature, and respiratory rate (data not shown). The viral RNA of H1N1 was detected in lung samples from the infected pigs at PID 2 (2/3; number of positive pigs/number of pigs tested), PID 4 (3/3), PID 7 (2/3), and PID 14 (1/3), while the viral RNA was detected in the pigs infected with H1N2 or H3N2 at PID 2 (1/3 or 3/3), PID 4 (3/3 or 3/3), and PID 7 (2/3 or 2/3), respectively. However, pigs of the control group remained negative for the viral RNA throughout the study period. The gross lung lesions of infected pigs ranged from multifocal lesions to a coalescing reddish-tan consolidation of the lung, particularly affected the cranial lobes, but these lesions were not detected in the control pigs ( Figure 1 ). The three infected groups differed in their gross lesion scores following post inoculation. The H3N2 infected pigs showed significantly higher lung lesion score than other groups (P < 0.05) at PID 2, and this then progressively decreased. Both the H1N1 and H1N2 infected pigs lacked gross lesions at PID 2, but they showed minimal to mild pneumonia lesions on PID 4, 7 and 14. The pigs infected with H1N1 had significant scores (P < 0.05) of gross lesions when compared with the other pigs infected with H1N2, H3N2, and control at PID 14 (Figure 2A.) . The histological lesions were limited to the bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli, but no lesions were observed in the tissues of control pigs. The pigs infected with H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 all shared the following histopathological features; bronchial/bronchiolar necrosis, thickening of the alveolar septa due to the infiltration of inflammatory leukocytes, and pulmonary hemorrhage and atelectasis ( Figure 3 ). The H3N2 infected pigs had severe histological lesions at PID 2, while, in the other sub-type infected pigs, the lesions were milder at PID 2. However, at PID 14, these lung lesions of H1N1-infected pigs had a significantly higher mean histological score (5.3, P < 0.05) than those from the lungs of H1N2 (0) and H3N2 (2.1) infected pigs ( Figure 2B) . SIV was detected in the lung tissue following IHC staining. Influenza viral antigens were predominantly found in the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium. In addition, numerous necrotic epithelial cells that underwent phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages were detected in the lumen. In the three infected groups, mean antigen-positive score of the viral antigens of H3N2-infected pigs was higher than those of the other group's pigs at PID 2. The mean antigen scores of pigs infected with H1N2 and H3N2 were rarely detected from PID 7. However, an increased amount of viral antigens in H1N1infected pigs were found in the bronchioles and alveolar epithelium, and the mean score was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of H1N2 and H3N2 infected pigs at PID 14 (Figures 4 and 5) . The H3N2-infected pigs had severe pneumonic lesions at PID 2, while H1N1-and H1N2-infected pigs lacked gross lesions; however, at PID 14, the lesion score of H1N1-infected pigs were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of H1N2-and H3N2-infected pigs. (B) The H3N2-infected pigs had higher histological lesion scores than H1N1-and H1N2-infected pigs at PID 2; reversely, at PID 14, the score of H1N1-infected pigs were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of H1N1 and H3N2 pigs. Figure 3 Histopathological lesion of the lung of the pigs infected with H1N1, H1N2 or H3N2 and non-infected pigs at post-inoculation days (PID) 2 and 14. The lung section of pig infected with H3N2 shows diffuse necrosis of bronchiolar epithelium and infiltration of inflammatory cells composed of mostly neutrophils and mononuclear cells around bronchioles (C), however most lesions were restored in the pigs at PID 14 (G). The pig infected with H1N1 shows less inflammation around bronchioles, but exhibits hemorrhagic lesions at PID 2 (A), whereas chronic inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and epithelial proliferation is observed in H1N1-infected pig at PID 14 (E). The pig infected with H1N2 shows mild interstitial pneumonia lesion at PID 2 (B), but the lesion was restored at PID 14 (F). Control pigs show no histopathologic lesion at PID 2 (D) and at PID 14 (H).
