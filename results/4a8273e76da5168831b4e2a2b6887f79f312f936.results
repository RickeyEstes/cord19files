The analytical sensitivity of the multiplex PCR was tested using serial dilutions of plasmid DNA from the ATCC strains. PCR amplifications were observed at 10-100 copies per reaction (Fig. 1) . The detection limits of single-targeted PCR and multiplex PCR were the same. Fig. 2 shows a summary of the specificity test results. ATCC standard organisms (28 species) and the mixture of 12 respiratory viral clones were used. The multiplex PCR identified each specific respiratory virus. No cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses or bacteria was observed. A comparison between multiplex PCR and conventional viral culture was made. Among the 101 clinical specimens, 57 samples (56.4%) were positive for the respiratory viruses using viral culture. Isolated viruses were 25 PIV-3, 12 RSV, 8 PIV-1, 8 AdV, 3 influenza-B, and 1 influenza-A. All the culture-positive specimens were also found PCR-positive, without any discrepancy (Fig. 3) . The multiplex PCR identified 19 respiratory viruses among 44 culture-negative samples (43.2%). Fifteen of these 19 viruses were 12 RSV, 1 AdV, and 2 co-infections of AdV/PIV-3 and RSV/PIV-1 (Table 2) , which viral culture was expected to detect. Excluding the four specimens with rhinoviruses and coronaviruses, which could be detected only by the multiplex PCR, the overall concordance rate was 88.7% (86/97). In addition, the multiplex PCR detected 13 specimens with co-infections. These included 9 culture-positive specimens and 4 negative ones. After excluding 3 specimens with rhinoviruses and 1 co-infection of RSV-A/RSV-B which could be detected only by the multiplex PCR, the co-infection rate was 12.3% (7/57) of culturepositive specimens and 13.3% (2/15) of culture-negative specimens, respectively. Interestingly, six of the nine co-infections contained RSV. No co-infection was detected by viral culture and immunofluorescence. At least two times of specimens were collected from six patients (Table 3) . Follow-up cultures were carried out during the same Fig. 2 . Analytical specificity of the multiplex PCR assay.
