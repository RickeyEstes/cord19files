A total of 517 samples collected in 2008 were randomly selected and retrospectively screened for HRVs. These were from patients aged between 3 months and 47 years old with a 9:4 male to female ratio. Clinical symptoms exhibited by these patients included the following: fever (100%), cough (100%), runny nose (92%), nasal stuffiness (69%), sputum production (38%), difficulty in breathing (35%), diarrhea (27%), vomiting (23%), and chills (19%) among others (Table 1) . These samples were collected all year-round except for January and December. However, March and May had the highest recordings with 39% of the positive samples having been collected in these months. Among the samples, 131 (25%) tested positive for HRV by real-time PCR. A fragment of~549 bp including the hypervariable part of the 5 0 NCR and full-length VP4 and partial VP2 gene region was successfully amplified in 37 (28%) samples. Eleven samples were excluded from further analyses. Of these, six displayed poor sequence quality while the other five sequences comprised echovirus (two) and coxsackieviruses (three). BLAST analyses of the remaining 26 sequences indicated the three HRV species comprising of 14 HRV-A, 9 HRV-C, and 3 HRV-B species. All the patient samples had been previously tested for other viral etiologies of respiratory disease. From those tests, the two patients infected with KENHRV002 and KENHRV022 had coinfection with Coxsackie B virus and one patient infected with KENHRV026 had a coinfection with human parainfluenzavirus type 3. Analyses of genetic identities revealed that intraspecies identities of the Kenyan HRV strains ranged from 58% to 100% at the nucleotide level and 55% to 100% at the amino acid level. Within the HRV-A species, nucleotide identity of the Kenyan viruses to their prototype reference strain ranged from 77% to 88% and the corresponding amino acid identities were between 91% and 99%. These strains also shared 73-96% nucleotide and 87-99% amino acid identities with other HRV-A contemporaneous strains. HRV-B strains displayed 77-97% and 87-97% sequence similarity to their prototype reference strain at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, and 75-88% nucleotide identities and 85-99% amino acid identities with other HRV-B contemporaneous strains. There was a slight difference in the sequence comparison of the HRV-C strains to the reference and the prototype strains. These showed a much lower relatedness compared to the other two species. Percentage nucleotide identity to the prototype reference strain was only 73-77% and 82-92% at the amino acid level. Furthermore, comparison of the Kenyan HRV-C strains to contemporaneous strains showed the nucleotide and amino acid identities varying between 59-98% and 60-100%, respectively. Phylogenetically, the Kenyan HRVs clustered into 20 serotypes among the HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C species (Figure 1 ). Serotype-specific comparison of the Kenyan HRV sequences to contemporaneous sequences and the serotype-specific reference sequence available in Genbank revealed that the nucleotide and amino acid identities generally ranged between 79-100% and 94-100%, respectively ( Table 2) . The Kenyan HRV strains showed countrywide distribution with more than one serotype circulating in the same region. The coastal region had the highest number of serotypes in circulation with seven identified (A01, A20, A47, A49, A71, C02, and C33), followed by the Nairobi region where six (A58, B84, C02, C13) serotypes circulated. Five different HRV serotypes (A30, A20, A29, C02, and B91) were identified from the western region at the Kisii, Alupe, and New Nyanza hospitals. Only one serotype (A01) was identified from the Rift Valley region. Selection pressure analyses of the VP4/VP2 genomic region revealed no statistically significant (P-value < 0Á05) positive selection as determined by the SLAC, FEL, or IFEL methods. However, numerous negatively selected sites were observed for all the species. The global selection pressures on the gene region for HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C as estimated by the SLAC method were 0Á0353, 0Á0305, and 0Á0702, respectively (P-value < 0Á05).
