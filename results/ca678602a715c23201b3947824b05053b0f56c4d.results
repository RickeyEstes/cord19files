SGRPs identifying specific O-acetylated Sia moieties. We used the recombinant soluble HE proteins from three nidoviruses as SGRPs to survey for the display of O-acetylated modified Sias in the respiratory tract tissues that are the natural sites of influenza virus infection in mammals, as well as in the gastrointestinal tract tissues in Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) and the tissues of embryonated chicken eggs. These SGRPs have been previously characterized with defined Sia binding and esterase activities (14) . Mouse hepatitis virus S strain (MHV-S) HE recognizes 4-O-Ac Sia, bovine coronavirus Mebus strain (BCoV-Mebus) HE primarily recognizes 7,9-O-Ac Sia, and porcine Torovirus P4 strain (PToV-P4) HE recognizes 9-O-Ac Sia. Hosts examined included those that are naturally infected and which sustain transmission of influenza viruses in nature (humans, Pekin ducks, swine, horses and dogs) and those used as experimental models for human influenza virus infection and transmission (mice, ferrets, and guinea pigs). The HE proteins are fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 and to a hexahistidine (His 6 ) sequence, allowing ready expression, purification, and detection (Fig. 1A) . Proteins were expressed from insect cells using a baculovirus vector and purified using protein G columns, resulting in isolation of a single protein (Fig. 1B) . Those proteins contained N-linked (but not O-linked) glycans, as shown by treatment with enzymes specific for different glycosylation forms (Fig. 1C) . As the proteins were produced in insect cells, they would display high-mannose N-linked glycans and would not themselves be sialylated. Testing the specificities of the SGRPs in a solid-phase lectin binding assay (spLBA) with either horse serum proteins (displaying 4-O-Ac Sias) or bovine submaxilliary gland mucin (7,9-O-Ac Sias and 9-O-Ac Sias) showed the expected binding specificities (Fig. 1D) , and those were also confirmed by pretreating the Sia substrates with the esterase-active form of the proteins before conducting the assay, removing the binding substrate (Fig. 1D) . The use of solutions at pH 6.5 during esterase treatments prevents O-acetyl migration on the Sia glycerol side chain (56, 57), and esterase controls performed alternatively at pH 7.5 confirmed previous findings of BCoV-Mebus HE-Fc (but not PToV-P4 HE-Fc) binding to 7,9-O-Ac Sias present in bovine mucin (58) . We observed no binding of the SGRPs to nonmodified Sia substrates (bovine fetuin, various animal serums) or nonsialylated glycoprotein substrates (results not shown). Goat serum was used as a block of nonspecific binding of the anti-Fc secondary antibody in all subsequent tissue staining experiments. The Sia of that serum did not react with the probes on tissue slides or in testing performed by spLBA, suggesting that the serum does not contain O-acetylated Sias (results not shown). The binding specificity of the probes was tested on a glycan microarray containing Neu4,5Ac 2 (n ϭ 1), Neu5,9Ac 2 (n ϭ 20), and Neu5Gc9Ac (n ϭ 1), along with their equivalent but nonacetylated glycan forms (Fig. 2 ). Binding was ranked as relative fluorescence units (RFU) (n ϭ 4, standard deviations [SD]). MHV-S HE-Fc bound very specifically to Neu4,5Ac 2 ␣3Gal␤4GlcNAc␤R1 (R1ϭpropyl azide) as the only Neu4,5Ac 2 glycan on the current array. Both PToV-P4 HE-Fc and BCoV-Mebus HE-Fc bind specifically to 9-O-Ac sialic acids. While PToV-P4 HE-Fc binds only to Neu5,9Ac 2 , BCoV-Mebus HE-Fc binds to both Neu5,9Ac 2 and Neu5Gc9Ac. Note that 9-O-acetylation is partially lost on many spots because of instability. Thus, results on those spots are meaningful only if binding is much better than that to the corresponding non-O-acetylated glycan spot. Glycan microarray results correlated with our spLBA observations and largely The binding is presented in heat map form. The heat map was generated according to a method previously described (87) . Binding was ranked and calculated as follows, where RFU represents relative fluorescence units: (glycan RFU/maximum glycan RFU) * 100. Binding data represent results determined at 40 g/ml (n ϭ 4, standard deviations [SD]). confirmed the Sia moiety specificity of the SGRPs. Glycan microarray results obtained with our SGRPs consistently overlapped previous results reported for these nidovirus HEs (14) . The distribution of O-acetyl Sias in tissue culture cells. The 4-O-Ac Sias were found in cultured cells derived from horses (NBL-6), with between 10% and 30% of the cells showing positive staining results by microscopy ( Fig. 3 ) and flow cytometry (data not shown). The 4-O-Ac Sias were not detected on the human (HEK-293, A549) or canine (MDCK) cells examined (Fig. 3) . The 9-O-Ac and 7,9-O-Ac Sias were widely but variably displayed on cells from different hosts, including several different human and animal cell lines (Fig. 3) . The specificity of the SGRPs for their modified Sia target on cells was confirmed by 9-O-acetylesterase-active treatment of MDCK cells prior to PToV HE-Fc probing (Fig. 3 , inset box). MDCK cells, which are frequently used for passage, amplification, and titration of influenza viruses, display both 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac Sias on their plasma membranes. Human cell lines (A549 and HEK-293) also synthesize 7,9-O-Ac and 9-O-Ac Sias, but the majority was detected at intracellular sites, likely within the Golgi/ endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network based on their colocalization with GM130 as detected by antibody staining (data not shown). The intracellular localization of 9-O-Ac Sias in those human cells has been previously described (14) . A horse cell line (NBL-6) displayed both 7,9-and 9-O-Ac Sias in addition to the 4-O-Ac Sias, and those were primarily detected on the cell surface. The distribution of Sias in mouse respiratory tissues. To generally confirm the binding of SGRPs and plant lectins to Sia forms in tissues, as well to determine their distribution in a key laboratory animal, we surveyed the respiratory tissues of C57BL/6 mice by histochemistry (Fig. 4) . Mice showed little 4-O-Ac Sia in the respiratory tract tissues, with some signal seen in the lamina propria of the trachea and at pneumocytes in the lung, but high levels were displayed in the tissues of the small and large intestines (results not shown). Mice displayed 9-O-Ac (and 7,9-O-Ac) Sias in the trachea, often in the submucosal glands but also at some tracheal epithelium, and in the lung at pneumocytes of alveolar tissue. We also observed that the 9-O-Ac Sias were often distributed on endothelial linings of vessels and on erythrocytes preserved in the tissue sections. Lectin stains identified limited ␣2-6-linked Sias (SNA), with more-robust staining for ␣2-3-linked Sias (MAH) being particularly abundant in the lungs (Fig. 4A) . The same general Sia identification patterns were observed in frozen tissue sections as in paraffin-embedded (PE) tissues. However, we observed staining variance in that frozen sections had both lower signal in the trachea and higher levels in the lung of 9-O-Ac Sias than in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue and also showed some staining of the mucus that was still present on the slides (Fig. 4B) . The distribution of 4-O-acetyl Sias in mammalian influenza virus host respiratory tissues. The MHV-S HE-Fc SGRP showed a widespread display of 4-O-Ac Sias in the tracheal and lung tissues of horses and guinea pigs (Fig. 5 ). In horses, the 4-O-Ac Sia was displayed in the airway-exposed respiratory cells, including tracheal epithelia and alveolar pneumocytes, and that therefore would likely be in contact with infecting influenza viruses. Within the guinea pig respiratory tract, 4-O-Ac Sias were not seen at the tracheal epithelium but rather were displayed in the submucosa at the endothelial cells lining vessels. The lungs displayed significant 4-O-Ac Sia staining at alveolar pneumocytes (and endothelia, again). We observed display of 4-O-Ac Sias in small numbers of cells within ferret and dog tissues, but with little consistency or organiza- tion, and we did not observe any 4-O-Ac Sias in the examined respiratory tissues from humans or pigs. The distribution of 9-and 7,9-O-acetyl Sias in mammalian influenza virus host respiratory tissues. We probed respiratory tissues using PToV-P4 HE-Fc to locate 9-O-Ac Sias (Fig. 6A) and BCoV-Mebus HE-Fc to locate 7,9-O-Ac Sias (Fig. 6B ). The 7,9and 9-O-Ac Sias were present in tissues of all mammals screened here, but with distinct tissue and cell display patterns. Human respiratory tissues displayed these modified Sias in both the trachea and lung. Within the human trachea, 7,9-and 9-O-Ac Sias were localized within submucosal glands, which are involved in excretion of respiratory mucins. Within the human lung, they were displayed on alveolar pneumocytes, as well as endothelia of vessels. The ferret lung displayed some 7,9-and 9-O-Ac Sias, while few to none were detected in the examined guinea pig respiratory tissues. In the respiratory tracts of pigs, horses, and dogs, 7,9-and 9-O-Ac Sias were displayed within the tracheal epithelial cells. Overall, 7,9-and 9-O-Ac Sias appeared most abundant within the respiratory tissues of humans in comparison to the other mammalian hosts surveyed. The distribution of Sia linkages in mammalian influenza virus host respiratory tissues. Staining of mammalian respiratory tissues with plant lectins (␣2-6-linked Sias [SNA], ␣2-3-linked Sias [MAH]) for Sia linkages confirmed a significant presence of Sias on the tissue sections (Fig. 7) . Human respiratory tissues had abundant ␣2-6-linked Sias (SNA) at the tracheal epithelium (Fig. 7A) , while an increasing level of the ␣2-3-linked forms (MAH) was seen in the lung (Fig. 7B) . Ferrets displayed far more ␣2-6-linked Sias in the lung and in the submucosal glands of the trachea, while levels of ␣2-3-linked Sias appeared limited at vessels and in the lung alveolar tissue. Guinea pigs displayed both Sia linkages, though ␣2-3-linked Sias were more likely to be detected at the tracheal epithelium. Pigs displayed abundant ␣2-6-linked Sias at the tracheal epithelium, while both linkage forms were found throughout the tissues. Horses showed fairly equivalent levels of both Sia linkages in the respiratory tissues examined here. The tracheal epithelium of dogs was enriched for ␣2-3-linked Sias, where staining of cilia was easily observed. The distribution of O-acetyl Sias in Pekin duck respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues. Waterfowl of many types are the primary ecological hosts for influenza virus diversity in nature (59) . Here we probed for O-acetylated Sias in respiratory (trachea, lung) and gastrointestinal (small intestine, colon, cecum, cloaca) tissues of Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos domesticus) and found the display of all O-acetyl Sias (Fig. 8A ). By probing with MHV-S HE-Fc, we showed that 4-O-Ac Sias were displayed within a few epithelial cells of the trachea and alveolar pneumocytes of the lung but that none were observed within the digestive tract tissues examined. 9-O-Ac Sias were detected on the tracheal epithelia and within the lung pneumocytes in parallel to the 4-O-Ac, but we did not see a similar respiratory display of the di-7,9-O-Ac Sia form. Within the cloaca, we identified mono-9-O-Ac Sias within mucosal epithelia cell bodies lining the cloacal opening. Within the intestines and colon, enteric ganglia displayed 7,9-and 9-O-Ac Sia forms. An additional reported site of influenza replication, the pancreas, was screened with no display observed (data not shown). Examination of Sia linkage by lectin staining (SNA, MAH) confirmed the abundant presence of Sias in the tissue sections (Fig. 8B) . Respiratory tissues tended to display both ␣2-3-linked and ␣2-6-linked Sias, while ␣2-3-linked Sia forms predominated in gastrointestinal tissues at the epithelia. One exception was the enriched display of ␣2-6-linked Sias within colonic crypts. The distribution of O-acetyl Sias in embryonated chicken eggs. Embryonated chicken eggs are used for the amplification of many influenza viruses for diagnostic and experimental studies and for vaccine production, and they have been shown to display primarily ␣2-3-linked Sias, resulting in rapid selection of human strains (33, 60) . We surveyed both embryonic tissue and a sampling of extraembryonic chorioallantoic membranes (CAM). Staining performed with PToV-P4 HE-Fc showed that mono-9-O-Ac Sia was present at high levels in the embryonic tissues and the extraembryonic membranes (Fig. 9) . However, BCoV-Mebus HE-Fc failed to stain those tissues for the 7,9-O-Ac form, and the 4-O-Ac Sia form was also not observed. A solid-phase assay performed on allantoic fluid extracted from the eggs failed to identify any O-acetylated Sias (data not shown), suggesting that the 9-O-Ac Sias are primarily expressed on the cells of the embryos and the membranes. Staining with lectins for Sia linkage largely confirmed the significant presence of ␣2-3-linked Sias (MAH) in both the embryo and CAM, with only trace signals for ␣2-6-linked Sias (SNA).
