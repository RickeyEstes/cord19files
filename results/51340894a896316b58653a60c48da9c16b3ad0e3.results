Anti-adenovirus activity of salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs. In initial studies, we determined the inhibitory concentrations of the three anthelmintic drugs against HAdV in a plaque assay measured as the percentage of plaque formation inhibition compared to a control cells infected in the absence of drugs. The three salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs showed a dose-dependent anti-HAdV activity against both HAdV5 and HAdV16, with 100% inhibition of plaques formation at 1.25, 5 and 2.5 μM for NIC, OXY and RAF, respectively ( Fig. 2a,b) . The IC 50 values for the three anthelmintic drugs are summarized in Table 1 . We also evaluated whether these salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs were able to inhibit virus production using HAdV5, HAdV16 and HAdV19 yield reduction assays. Treatment with NIC, OXY and RAF was associated with overall reductions in virus yield from 10 to 186-fold (Table 1) . In an assay measuring antiviral activity of the three anthelmintic drugs as a function of MOI, inhibition was inversely proportional to the number of input particles (Fig. 3 ). While they were also inhibitory at high MOI, the relationship between the number of infecting HAdV particles and the drugs concentration is less marked, as expected. The cellular cytotoxicity of the salicylanilide drugs was also analyzed. The CC 50 values for these molecules were in all cases significantly higher than the IC 50 concentrations required for inhibition in our antiviral activity and mechanistic assays for both 293β5 cells (Table 1 ) and A549 cells (22.9 ± 9.8 µM, 76.1 ± 14.4 µM and 80.6 ± 34.7 µM for NIC, OXY and RAF, respectively).
