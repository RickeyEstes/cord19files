A total of 502 live-born Holstein calves were eligible for enrollment. The majority were born during summer and fall months (spring: March, April, and May = 23.9%; summer: June, July, and August = 32.5%; fall: September, October, and November = 32.1%; winter: December = 11.5%). One newborn bull calf presented with clinical signs consistent with congenital malformation and was excluded from the study. Systematic assignment to feeding group resulted in 250 ACD calves (117 heifer calves and 133 bull calves) and 251 RES calves (118 heifer calves and 133 bull calves). After enrollment, 1 ACD bull calf was removed from the study because of poor feet and legs. Additionally, 2 RES bull calves were removed from the study; 1 calf developed a severe joint infection and the other calf was reared on the wrong milk feeding treatment while housed in the preweaning barn. All data from these 3 calves were excluded from statistical analyses. Thus, data were available for 249 calves per treatment group. Summary information about the calves appears in Table 1 . Calves from twin births were more frequently assigned to the ACD treatment group. However, twins represented a relatively small proportion (4.6%) of the overall study sample. Treatment assignment was not associated with any of the other calving factors, colostrum management, serum total protein concentration, or birth structural measurements. The ACD and RES treatment groups were balanced for number of bull and heifer calves enrolled (P = 0.93). Thus, systematic assignment to treatment group resulted in calves being similar at baseline. Preweaning disease treatment and mortality risks are reported in Table 2 . Median age at weaning for ACD and RES calves was 42.0 and 41.0 d, respectively (P = 0.45). The odds of ACD calves being treated for a preweaning disease event tended to be lower than that of RES calves [odds ratio (OR), 95% CI: 0.2, 0.1 to 1.1; P = 0.07]. Two ACD calves and 9 RES calves required treatment during the preweaning period for neonatal calf diarrhea complex, and 1 ACD calf and 5 RES calves were treated for omphalophlebitis and respiratory disease, respectively. Calves did not differ by milk feeding treatment for preweaning mortality (OR, 95% CI: 1.1, 0.4 to 3.2; P = 0.79). Deaths of 4 ACD calves and 5 RES calves were associated with neonatal calf diarrhea complex, and 1 RES calf died of bloat. Causes of death for an additional 3 ACD calves and 2 RES calves were not determined. Average age at death for ACD calves and RES calves was 20.9 and 14.3 d, respectively. Differences in preweaning growth performance are summarized by milk feeding treatment in Table 2 . The ACD calves had greater ADG during the preweaning period and greater BW at weaning relative to RES calves. The ACD feeding treatment also was associated with greater preweaning structural growth for all anatomical measurements. Effects of milk feeding treatment on fecal consistency and shedding of enteropathogens are presented in Table  3 . Calves assigned to the ACD feeding treatment had Measured between 0 and 7 d of age. 5 (7.6, 9. 3) 6.9 (6.1, 7.8) <0.001 Body length growth, cm 12.2 (10.8, 13.6) 9.6 (8.2, 11.0) <0.001 Heart girth growth, cm 12.9 (11.9, 13.9) 9.9 (8.9, 10.9) <0.001 1 Calves assigned to the ACD treatment had free access to milk replacer acidified to a target pH between 4.0 and 4.5. 2 Calves assigned to the RES treatment were fed 3 L of milk replacer twice daily. 3 Treated for at least one disease event between birth and weaning. 4 Died before being weaned off milk. more fluid fecal consistency at wk 5 and 6, but were similar at all other time points, as compared with the RES calves. The ACD calves tended to have greater odds of fecal shedding C. parvum oocysts compared with RES calves (OR, 95% CI: 1.4, 1.0 to 1.9). Milk feeding treatment was not associated with rotavirus or coronavirus shedding. Escherichia coli F5 was not detected. Effects of milk feeding treatment on postweaning disease treatment, mortality, and growth for the replacement heifers are shown in Table 4 . Median age for postweaning follow-up did not differ by feeding treatment (ACD: 263 d and RES: 266 d, P = 0.71). Similarly, calves on ACD and RES treatments did not differ for postweaning disease treatment (OR, 95% CI: 1.1, 0.6 to 2.1; P = 0.80) or mortality (OR, 95% CI: 0.9, 0.3 to 2.7; P = 0.80). Most heifers requiring treatment were treated for respiratory problems (24 ACD and 23 RES); there were also 3 cases of lameness (2 ACD and 1 RES) and 1 case of systemic infection (1 ACD). Postweaning mortality risks for both treatment groups were low, with postweaning respiratory disease reported as the suspected cause of death for 3 ACD heifers and 5 RES heifers. In addition, 1 ACD heifer died from enteritis, 1 ACD heifer died from systemic infection, 1 ACD heifer died from injury, respectively, and 2 RES heifers died Calves assigned to the ACD treatment had free access to milk replacer acidified to a target pH between 4.0 and 4.5. 2 Calves assigned to the RES treatment were fed 3 L of milk replacer twice daily. 3 Treated for at least one disease event between weaning and follow-up. 4 Died between weaning and follow-up. 5 Least squares means (95% CI) are presented. 721 from bloat. No difference was found by milk feeding treatment for ADG after weaning (P = 0.58) or BW at the postweaning follow-up time point (P = 0.33). Effects of milk feeding treatment on postweaning disease treatment, mortality, and growth for veal calves are shown in Table 5 . Median age for slaughter measurements did not differ by feeding treatment (ACD: 230 d and RES: 231 d, P = 0.85). Veal calves did not differ by milk feeding treatment for the odds of postweaning disease treatment (OR, 95% CI: 1.5, 0.8 to 2.6; P = 0.18) or postweaning mortality (OR, 95% CI: 0.8, 0.3 to 1.7; P = 0.50). Respiratory disease was associated with all cases of postweaning disease in veal calves. Moreover, respiratory disease was the leading cause of postweaning mortality for veal calves (13 ACD, 15 RES), together with 2 calf deaths from bloat (1 ACD, 1 RES); causes of mortality for 3 additional ACD calves were not determined. Milk feeding treatment did not affect length of time required for veal calves to reach slaughter weight (P = 0.85). Moreover, no difference was found between the ACD and the RES veal calves for postweaning ADG (P = 0.13) or live weight at slaughter (P = 0.66). Carcasses from 57 ACD veal calves and 55 RES veal calves were graded at the slaughter facility. Twenty-two carcasses (10 ACD and 12 RES) exceeded the maximum dressed weight restriction for veal and were not eligible to receive a grade classification. Feeding treatment did not affect carcass characteristics (P = 0.62). In total, 36/47 (76.6%) of the ACD veal carcasses and 31/43 (72.1%) of the RES veal carcasses were assigned the Canada A2 grade category, and all of the other carcasses were assessed as Canada A1 grade.
