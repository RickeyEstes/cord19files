A range of cell lines and primary cells were infected with HIV-1 (BaL, NL4.3, RFW strains), HSV-1 (NC-1 strain), CMV (Toledo and Towne strains) and VZV (Schenke strain) and harvested at the earliest time of maximal productive infection as illustrated in Table 1 . The expression levels of 10 commonly used QPCR normalisation genes in both and mock and virally infected cells was determined by QPCR. The housekeeping genes investigated were beta-2microglobulin (B2M), peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 gamma (EEF1G), succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA), GAPDH, hydroxymethyl-bilane synthase (HMBS), TATA box-binding protein (TBP), 18s Ribosomal RNA (18sRNA), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), and BACT. In order to accurately ascertain which housekeeping genes would be most reliable for use as normalisers in QPCR we subjected the data to analysis using the GeNorm tool [13] ( Table 2 ). Using the results from the GeNorm analysis it was possible to list the housekeeping genes in order of reliability in the context of each viral infection (Table 3) . 18sRNA was the least reliable reference gene as it had had the highest sum v value (13.26) which represents the standard deviation (SD) of reference gene expression over all viral infections investigated. Correspondingly it was either the least or second least reliable gene in 9 of the 10 experimental settings. Additionally BACT and HMBS also had high sum v values of 10.51 and 9.65 respectively, indicating that these genes are generally less reliable for use as normalisers for QPCR assays. According to this analysis the most reliable overall reference gene was PP1A with a sum v value of 7.41 and the most reliable gene in 7 of the 10 viral infections. Other genes with low sum v values were SDHA (8.91), GAPDH (8.74), TBP (9.06) and EEF1G (9.16), though in the context of HSV-1 NC1 infected HELA cells EEF1G was identified as the least reliable gene. In the case of CMV an almost identical pattern in reliability was observed in infected primary HFF cells regardless of differences in the virus strain used and a very similar pattern was also seen in VZV Schenke infected cells despite differences in the origin of the primary cell types used for infection. Though the expression pattern of reference genes in HELA and HEP2 cells infected with HSV-1 NC-1 were also similar, it is of note that in HEP2 cells GAPDH was the second most reliable gene whereas in HELA cells it was the third most unreliable. The expression pattern of reference genes in cells infected with HIV-1 was also similar though greater differences were detected compared to the other
