Morbidity and mortality data on calves during the first 30 d are presented in Table 1 . Clinical disease of the trial calves was characterized by diarrhea of varying severity and by pneumonia. No other common clinical syndromes of the newborn calf were observed. Calves in group A did not have morbidity or mortality significantly different from those of calves from group B. Administration of DC plus two levels of colostrum (groups C and D) did not lead to a better clinical outcome than administration of colostrum alone or DC. The calves that died, one in group A (at 11 d of age) and one in group B (at 30 d of age, shortly after being weighed and bled), had severe diarrhea with marked dehydration. Gross necropsy and histological examinations on the major organ systems revealed no unique lesions other than acute enteric disease. Culture for Salmonella sp., fluorescent antibody staining for Rota and Corona viruses, epithelial adherent Escherichia coli, and fecal examination for Cryptosporidia sp. were negative in both calves. The BW from the calves of the four groups are presented in Table 2 . On d 1 and 30 after birth, the comparison of the BW did not reveal significant differences among groups. The average increase in BW was about 9 kg in 30 d in each group. The serum concentrations of IgG from the calves of the four groups are shown in Table 3 . Immediately after birth, IgG concentrations were not significantly different among groups. Twenty-four hours after birth (i.e., 22 h after treatment), the increase of IgG concentrations was significant in all four groups. At this time, calves treated with DC in whole milk (group A) had a mean IgG concentration that was significantly lower than those of the other three groups. The 85 g of DC plus 3 kg of colostrum (group C) 24 h after birth did not lead to IgG concentrations significantly higher than 3 kg of colostrum alone (group B). Calves fed with 85 g of DC plus 1.5 kg of colostrum (group D) demonstrated a mean IgG concentration at 24 h after birth that was not significantly different from that of calves given 3 kg of colostrum (group B) but that tended to be numerically lower. However, at 24 h after birth, calves of group D showed a mean IgG concentration that was significantly lower than that of calves fed 85 g of DC plus 3 kg of colostrum (group C). For the two groups with the highest mean IgG at 24 h after birth, groups Band C, IgG concentrations decreased ".b.c.dMeans within the same column (between-group comparison) with different superscript letters differ (P < .05).

There were 15 calves per group. One calf in group A died between 24 h and 30 d after birth. significantly between h 24 and d 30 after birth. Changes were not significant in the other two groups over the same period. Colostrum IgG concentration was 96 g/kg; IgG content of DC was 113 mg/g of DC.
