The embryonic kidney cell line 293T can be readily transfected and transduced and was, thus, chosen as the main tool for the present study. For directed expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 in 293T cells, a retroviral vector system was employed. Western blot analysis of cells transduced with IFITM1, 2 and 3 variants, bearing a C-terminal c-myc tag, revealed robust expression of all IFITM proteins, although expression of IFITM3 was most efficient ( Figure 1A ). Similar results were obtained when cells transduced to express untagged IFITM proteins were analyzed, employing an IFITM1-specific antibody and an antiserum raised against IFITM2, which is cross-reactive with IFITM3 ( Figure 1B) . Moreover, this analysis revealed that endogenous expression of IFITM proteins in 293T cells was low or absent ( Figure 1B) . In order to test if the IFITM proteins unfold the expected antiviral activity, the IFITM-positive cells were transduced with retroviral vectors bearing the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus (FLUAV), the glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), the envelope protein (Env) of murine leukemia virus (MLV) or the glycoproteins of Machupo virus (MACV-GPC) and Lassa virus (LASV-GPC). Cells expressing IFITM proteins without myc-tag were used for this experiment and all subsequent studies, since the tag might interfere with the antiviral activity of IFITMs. Expression of IFITM3 and to a lesser degree IFITM1 and 2 reduced entry driven by FLUAV-HA and VSV-G ( Figure 1C ), as expected [14] . In contrast, entry driven by MLV-Env, LASV-GPC or MACV-GPC was not inhibited ( Figure 1C ), again in keeping with published results [14] , indicating that our experimental system was suitable for the analysis of the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins. We next assessed whether the cellular entry driven by the S proteins of the human coronaviruses 229E and NL63 (229E-S, NL63-S) and the S proteins of the emerging coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is differentially inhibited by IFITMs. Expression of all IFITM proteins reduced 229E-S-and NL63-S-driven entry about 40% to 70% ( Figure 2 ). In contrast, IFITM1-and IFITM3-mediated inhibition of entry driven by SARS-S and MERS-S was inefficient (although in the case of SARS-S/IFITM1 statistically significant) and entry driven by these glycoproteins was only reduced to about 50% upon expression of IFITM2 ( Figure 2 ). We next analyzed if the differential sensitivity to inhibition by IFITM proteins can also be detected in the context of a lung-derived cell line. For this, we engineered the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 to stably express IFITM3 and analyzed the effects of an IFITM3-specific siRNA on S protein-mediated transduction. Transfection of parental A549 control cells with IFITM3 siRNA slightly increased transduction efficiency compared to cells transfected with scrambled, control siRNA. However, this effect was also observed with pseudotypes bearing the IFITM-insensitive MLV envelope protein and the IFITM-sensitive FLUAV-HA and was, thus, most likely unspecific. In contrast, transfection of A549-IFITM3 cells with IFITM3 siRNA efficiently increased HA-but not MLV-Env-driven transduction, indicating that an IFITM3-dependent block to viral entry was operative in these cells. Notably, entry into A549-IFITM3 cells driven by all S proteins studied was comparably augmented by IFITM3-specific siRNA, suggesting that the S proteins from globally circulating and emerging coronaviruses are comparably sensitive to inhibition by IFITM3 in this cellular system. In sum, 293T but not A549 cell entry driven by S proteins from human coronaviruses is more susceptible to inhibition by IFITM proteins than entry driven by the S proteins of emerging coronaviruses. Whether this differential IFITM sensitivity is due to differences in the expression levels of IFITM3, or other cellular components, remains to be determined. It has been suggested that IFITMs inhibit viral entry into host cells by accumulating cholesterol within late endosomes [22] . We, therefore, investigated whether entry driven by the S proteins of globally circulating and emerging coronaviruses is differentially susceptible to inhibition by U18666A, a cationic amphiphilic drug, which induces the accumulation of cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes [27] , and has been previously studied in the context of Ebola virus entry [28, 29] . However, entry into 293T cells driven by the S proteins of the globally circulating hCoV-NL63 and 229E and the emerging MERS-CoV was comparably inhibited by U18666A, while inhibition of SARS-S-driven entry was most efficient ( Figure 3A ). Cytotoxic effects were not observed ( Figure 3B ). Thus, differential sensitivity to endosomal cholesterol might not account for the differential susceptibility of these S proteins to inhibition by IFITMs. Expression of beta-actin was assessed as a loading control. Comparable results were obtained in a separate experiment; (B) The experiment was carried out as described for panel (A) but cells were transduced with vectors encoding IFITM proteins without antigenic tag, and IFITM expression was analyzed with an IFITM1-specific monoclonal antibody and an antiserum raised against IFITM2, which is cross-reactive with IFITM3. Similar results were obtained in an independent experiment (C) 293T cells, transiently transduced to express IFITM1, 2 or 3, or cat as described for panel (B), were transduced with infectivity- transfected to express the viral receptors and transduced to express IFITM1, 2, 3, or cat as control, were transduced with infectivity-normalized retroviral vectors bearing the S proteins of the globally circulating human coronaviruses NL63 and 229E as well as the S proteins of the emerging SARS-and MERS-CoV. Transduction efficiency was determined at 72 h post inoculation by measuring luciferase activity in cell lysates. Transduction of control cells was set as 100%. The average of three independent experiments carried out with triplicate samples is shown, error bars indicate SEM. Statistical significance was calculated using one tailed, paired t-test. * p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01; (B) A549 wild type cells (control) and A549 cells transduced to stably express IFITM3 were transfected with siRNA directed against IFITM3. Scrambled siRNA were used as a control. Knockdown of IFITM3 expression was analyzed by Western blot. Detection of β-actin served as a loading control; (C) A549 control cells or A549-IFITM3 cells were transfected with siRNA directed against IFITM3 or scrambled siRNA as control. Cells were then transduced with the retroviral vectors described in (A). Transduction efficiency was analyzed at 72 h post transduction. Transduction of cells transfected with the scrambled siRNA was set as 1. The average of three independent experiments performed with triplicate samples is shown; error bars indicate SEM. The Welch-Test for independent samples was used to determine whether the effects of the siRNAs on transduction of A549 control and A549-IFITM3 cells were significantly different. * p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01. In order to further assess whether the sensitivity of viral entry to inhibition by IFITMs and increased cholesterol in late endosomes correlate, we investigated the impact of the cationic amphiphilic drugs clomiphene and terconazole on transduction efficiency, which, like U18666A, were found to induce cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes [29] . Both inhibitors reduced 293T cell entry driven by all coronavirus S proteins studied (Figure 4) , and the relative inhibition efficiencies did not correlate with the sensitivities to inhibition by IFITMs, which were measured in the same cellular system ( Figure 2 ). Moreover, although inhibitor sensitivity of MLV-Env and Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV)-GP-driven entry paralleled IFITM sensitivity, both clomiphene and terconazole either increased or had no effect on FLUAV-HA-dependent transduction (Figure 4) , which is highly sensitive to inhibition by IFITM3 ( Figure 1 ). Finally, filipin-staining of U18666A-, clomiphene-and terconazole-treated cells confirmed that these compounds indeed induced accumulation of cholesterol in intracellular compartments ( Figure 5 ), as expected [29] . In sum, sensitivity of S protein-and, particularly, FLUAV-HA-driven entry to IFITM expression and endosomal cholesterol accumulation are not linked, indicating that modulation of cholesterol trafficking by IFITM proteins might not account for their ability to inhibit entry of certain viruses.
