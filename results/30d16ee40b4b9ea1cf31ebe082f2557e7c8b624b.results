A total of 3507 children with CAAP were seen at the Soroka University Medical Center between November 2001 and October 2005. Nasopharyngeal wash specimens were obtained from 1296 of these children (37%), of whom 997 (76.9%) were hospitalized. Of note, 137 of the children who were hospitalized for CAAP during the first year of the study also had been included in the analysis of a previous 1-year study that compared the features of HMPV, RSV, and influenza A virus in children hospitalized for a broad spectrum of LRTIs, including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and exacerbation of asthma. 11 In addition, nasopharyngeal wash specimens also were obtained from a total of 135 healthy controls enrolled between November and May in each of the study years. The total number of patients in whom a virus was detected was 608 (46.9%). HMPV was identified in 108 children with CAAP (8.3%). HMPV was identified in 84 children (6.5%) as a single viral pathogen and in 24 children (1.8%) as a copathogen (HMPVco) with RSV (n = 10), adenovirus (n = 4), RSV and adenovirus (n = 3), RSV and influenza A virus (n = 1), cytomegalovirus (n = 3), influenza B virus (n = 2), or parainfluenza virus type 3 (n = 1). Overall, HMPV was the second most common viral pathogen after RSV (identified in 23.1% of the children), followed by adenovirus (3.4%), influenza A (2.9%), and parainfluenza viruses (2.9%). Coinfection with more than one respiratory virus other than HMPV was found in an additional 3.2% of the children. A blood culture was obtained on enrollment in 3160 children (90.1%). An organism considered by the clinicians to be a true pathogen grew from 42 of these cultures (1.3%): S pneumoniae (n = 29), Hemophilus influenzae (nontypable, n = 3; type b, n = 2; type a, n = 1), Enterococcus spp (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 1), Brucella spp (n = 1), or Neisseria meningitidis group B (n = 1). A clear seasonality of CAAP was observed, with 2 annual peaks: the major winter peak, usually from November through March, and a minor annual peak, usually from April through June. During the winter peaks (November through March), respiratory viruses were detected in the majority of patients with CAAP (550/1017 [54.1%]) (Figure 1) . HMPV-associated CAAP overlapped with the winter seasonal peaks of RSV-associated CAAP, with further extension toward late winter and spring and occasionally early summer. Of the 108 cases of HMPV-associated CAAP, 95 (88%) occurred between November and May. During this peak period, HMPV was detected in 95 of 1017 patients with CAAP (9.3%) versus 3 of 136 healthy controls (2.2%) (P = .005). Some year-to-year variation in prevalence of HMPV-associated CAAP was detected during these months: 37/255 (14.5%), 17/291 (5.8%), 17/273 (6.2%), and 24/198 (12.1%) of all CAAP specimens were positive for HMPV in the first-, second-, third-, and fourth-year peaks, respectively. A detailed analysis of the proportion of virus detection by age revealed that in children under age 12 months (n = 602), RSV was significantly more common than HMPV (223 [37.0%] vs 39 [6.5%]; (P < .001) (Figure 2) . The predominance of RSV was still significant during the second year of life: 49/334 (14.7%) versus 18/334 (5.4%) (P < .001); however, during the third to fifth year of life, the proportions of the 2 viruses were similar, with a decline in RSV detection. The number of children age 24 to 59 months who were admitted to the ED with HMPV-associated CAAP equaled that of those admitted with RSV-associated CAAP (n = 27). Of note, the proportion of virus-negative specimens increased from 222/602 (36.9%) in children under age 12 months to 466/694 (67.1%) in children age 12-59 months. The proportions of adenovirus, influenza A virus, and Children with HMPV-associated CAAP were significantly older than those with RSV-associated CAAP ( Table I) . A history of acute otitis media requiring tympanocentesis was significantly more common in the children with HMPVassociated CAAP, even after adjustment for age (P = .032); a similar trend was found for a history of pneumonia (P = .097). Children with HMPVco were more likely to have had a history of wheezing or diagnosis of asthma in the last 3 months compared with those with HMPV as a single infection (P = .022). The groups did not differ significantly with regard to history of recent antibiotic treatment. Patients with HMPV-associated CAAP had a significantly higher rate of wheezing (P = .001) and gastrointestinal symptoms (P < .001 adjusted for age) than those with RSV-associated CAAP (Table II) . Gastrointestinal symptoms also were more common in those with HMPVco. There were no significant differences in respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, or duration of hospitalization in children with HMPV versus children with other respiratory viruses, or in children with HMPVco versus children with single HMPV detected. Children with HMPV were less likely to be hospitalized than those with RSV (76.2% vs 93.3%; P = .005, adjusted for age). The maximal temperature on day of admission was usually high in all children with CAAP. Mean maximal temperature was higher for children with adenovirus infection compared with those with HMPV, RSV, or parainfluenza infection (Table II)
