Out of 159 eligible candidates, 11 responded at 6 weeks but not at 12 weeks and were not included in the analysis. Another three responded much later than 12 weeks and were likewise excluded. A total of 63 participated in the psychological study and were analysed. Six of them participated in the pilot assessment at Week 6, and the responses were used for a side analysis. The responders and the nonresponders were comparable on demographic parameters, duration of hospital stay, preillness health status, as well as the proportion of patients admitted to the intensive care unit ( Table 2 ). The slight overrepresentation by health care workers accounted for a slightly higher female-to-male ratio as majority of the nurses were female locally. The response rate was about 40%. As only English questionnaires were administered, it is likely that many who did not respond were not English literate.
