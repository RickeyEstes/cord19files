Molecular design, synthesis, purification and characterization of the peptides Kn2-7 (FIKRIARLLRKIF) was designed based on the peptide sequence of BmKn2 (FIGAIARLLSKIF) to enhance the net positive charge of the hydrophilic side. Kn2-7 peptide contains five positive charges while BmKn2 carries only two positive charges (Table 1) . Glycine, Alanine and Serine residues of BmKn2 were replaced with Lysine or Arginine (G3K, A4R, and S10R). The secondary structures were predicted by PHD method [40] on the website (http://npsa-pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat. pl?page = /NPSA/npsa_seccons.html), suggesting that Kn2-7 has higher a-helix percentage than BmKn2, which are 84.62% and 76.92%, respectively. Information of mucroporin, mucroporin-M1 and mucroporin-S1 were describe by our previous study [38] . The five peptides were successfully synthesized on an Abimed AMS 422 synthesizer by Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis. The purities of all five peptides showed reliable quality of more than 95%. The molecule weights measured by mass spectrometry (MS) were completely matched with the calculated molecule weights of these peptides. Kn2-7 was identified as the most effective scorpion venom peptide against HIV-1 PV by screening assay To assess anti-HIV activities of scorpion venom peptides, pseudotyped virus-based assays with TZM-bl system were adopted for the screening of anti-HIV-1 effect of different peptides. The results showed that mucroporin-M1, BmKn2 and Kn2-7 could significantly decrease infectivity of an HIV-1 clade B b12-resistant pseudotyped virus CAAN5342 compare to the mucroporin, mucroporin-S1, BSA and no-peptide virus mock control, in which peptide Kn2-7 showed the highest level of anti-HIV-1 activity and almost completely inhibited viral infection (Fig. 1) . This gave us a hint that peptide Kn2-7 is the most potential for developing anti-HIV agent. Therefore, Kn2-7 peptide was chosen for further study to clarify its anti-HIV effect. Mucroporin-S1 was chosen as a negative control for the further study because it shows no antibacterial and antiviral activity in our previous research [31] but has similar number of amino acid with Kn2-7 peptide. Kn2-7 acted sensitively and rapidly against HIV-1 PV To confirm whether anti-HIV-1 activity of Kn2-7 was dependent on concentration, several concentrations of Kn2-7 anti-HIV-1 activity were measured by pseudotyped virus-based assays with TZM-bl detection system. As shown in Fig. 2A , the antiviral-activity of Kn2-7 against HIV-1 PV was in a dosedependent manner and an inhibition of 40.1% was achieved at a concentration of 2 mg/ml and its EC 50 value was calculated as 2.76 mg/ml. Up to 98.7% inhibition could be achieved when concentration rose to 16 mg/ml. To determine the effective time needed for Kn2-7 to act on HIV-1 PV, 3 mg/ml peptide was incubated with 200 TCID 50 of HIV-1 PV for 3 min, 10 min, 30 min, 60 min and 90 min, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2B , from 3 min to 60 min, the longer time treatment, the higher inhibition was achieved but no significant difference was observed between 60 min treatment group and 90 min treatment group. The inhibition could be up to 42.3% when Kn2-7 was incubated with HIV-1 PV for only 3 min. Therefore, the time needed for Kn2-7 to act on HIV-1 PV was very short and the activity peaked at the time point of 60 min. According to this result, the concentration of 3 mg/ml (nearby the EC 50 value) and 60 min treatment were chosen for further assay of Kn2-7 peptide on anti-HIV-1 PV activity in the following experiments. The inhibitory effect of Kn2-7 was selective to HIV-1 PV To distinguish selective antiviral activity from nonselective cytotoxicity, we tested the cytotoxicity of the peptides on TZM-bl cells. TZM-bl cells were treated with several concentrations of Kn2-7 peptide for 24 hours and the viability of TZM-bl cells was measured using the MTS assay [41] . The absorbance was measured at 490 nm using an ELISA plate reader and the CC 50 value were calculated by SPSS. As shown in Table 2 , CC 50 of Kn2-7 on TZM-bl cells was 38.46 mg/ml, which is 13.93 times over the EC 50 value. Therefore, the antiviral activity of the peptide Kn2-7 against HIV-1 does not result from the cytotoxicity of the peptide on TZM-bl cells.
