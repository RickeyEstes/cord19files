3.1. The matching degree of +ssRNA viruses to their hosts' tRNA pools MD values were calculated for viral ORFs. Unfortunately, some viruses lacked data of tRNA copy numbers, and coding sequence of their hosts. Therefore, only 255 viruses (+ssRNA) were used in this analysis. The 101 strains of arboviruses that belonged to BSTVs were optimized according to their hosts' tRNA pool expression systems (host: arthropods, mammals, Gallus gallus). MD values (mean ± SD) were 0.7388 ± 0.0121, 0.7383 ± 0.0083, and 0.7427 ± 0.0045 in the three hosts, respectively (Supplementary Table 2 ). The MD values of 154 NSTVs strains had a mean of 0.7617 ± 0.0168 (Supplementary  Table 3 ). Wilcoxon & Mann-Whitney U test obtained statistically significant higher MD values in NSTVs than BSTVs (Z = −9.99, p < 0.001; Z = −10.25, p < 0.001; Z = −5.59, p < 0.001, respectively. Fig. 1a) . Among the different genera of arbovirus (Fig. 1b) , the extent of matching for Flavivirus to their hosts' tRNA pools was higher than that of Alphavirus. In addition, among the 18 genera of NSTVs, the MD values of Togaviridae (rubivirus) were the highest, followed by
