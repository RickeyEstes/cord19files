Twelve of the 13 local Louisville and southern Indiana acute care hospital EDs agreed to participate. Those twelve hospitals consisted of one pediatric facility, one university trauma center, and 10 acute care facilities. One hospital declined to participate, citing concerns with unanticipated costs and a lack of desire to be part of the project. Data were received from all 12 hospitals during the course of the 4-week study, and 9 of the 12 hospitals submitted useable data (see Figure 3 ). Participation by hospitals varied during the 4-week project, with an average of 6 to 7 hospitals providing data on any given day. This variation was, in part, the result of variable compliance with data transmission on weekends. In both the PDAG and CRG groups, the category labeled ''Other'' was the most frequently assigned reason for accessing care at EDs. No obvious acute increases in ED utilization for a particular syndrome were identified during the study period.
