Epithelial cells of the oviduct are highly susceptible to the QX strain Explant cultures of premature oviducts were prepared and analysed for their viability with a live/dead staining kit. The majority of the epithelial cells were alive for more than 72 h (data not shown). An advantage of the preparation of this oviduct explants is that the epithelial cells are in the same arrangement as in vivo. The oviduct explants of the different segments infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, and uterus were infected 24 hours postpreparation with 10 4 FFU of either of two IBV strains, QX and B1648. At 12, 24 and 48 hpi the organ explants were frozen in liquid nitrogen and cryosections were prepared and stained for IBV antigen. We observed clear differences between the IBV strains. The epithelial cells of all segments were highly susceptible to infection with the QX strain, which led to a high antigen detection rate and an increasing cytopathogenic effect over the three analysed time points. Infection with the B1648 strain was only detected in the infundibulum at very low rates. (Figure 1 and Table 1 ).
