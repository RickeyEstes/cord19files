Optimized temperature of LAMP assay for PCV2 On the basis of our temperature determination for the LAMP assay, the products amplified at 59°C exhibited slightly larger amounts of DNA than at other temperatures. Therefore, the optimal temperature of the LAMP reaction was 59°C. The Bst DNA polymerase was also work very well at this temperature ( Figure 1 ). The optimal temperature for the PCR reaction was 54°C by incubating the reaction mixture.
