The recently sequenced genomes of 2019-nCoV strains combined with the comparative analysis of the SARS genome organization and transcription allowed to determine the tentative list of gene products [51] . It has been suggested that 2019-nCoV has 16 predicted non-structural proteins (that are referred to as wNsp1-wNsp16 here) constituting a polyprotein (wORF1ab), followed by (at least) 13 downstream ORFs: Surface, ORF3a, ORF3b, Envelope, Membrane, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, Nucleocapsid, ORF9a, ORF9b, and ORF10 that we refer in this work as wS, wORF3a, wORF3b, wE, wM, wORF6, wORF7a, wORF7b, wORF8, wN, wORF9a, wORF9b, and wORF10, correspondingly. The three viral species whose proteins shared the highest similarity were consistently the same: human SARS (SARS-Cov), bat coronavirus (BtCoV), as well as another bat betacoronavirus (BtRf-BetaCoV).
