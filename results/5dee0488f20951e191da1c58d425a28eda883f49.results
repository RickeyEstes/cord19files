There were 2,844 articles that met the selection criteria mentioned. Ninety-eight percent of the articles were published in English. Other languag-es also appeared, such as French (15 articles; 0.53% of 2844 articles), German (10 articles; 0.35%), Polish (6 articles; 0.21%), Korean (6 articles; 0.21%), Chinese (3 articles; 0.11%) and one for each in Czech, Japanese, Persian, Slovenian and Spanish, respectively. The 2,844 articles were authored by 12,914 authors, among whom 9,648 (75%) contributed to only one article, 1,790 (14%) contributed to two articles, 653 (5.1%) contributed to three articles, 326 (2.5%) contributed to four articles, 159 (1.2%) contributed to five articles and 338 (2.6%) contributed to six or more articles. Moreover, 126 articles (4.4%) were single-author articles, 250 (8.8%) had two authors, 257 (9.0%) had three authors, 254 (8.9%) had four authors, 293 (10%) had five authors, 257 (9.0%) had six authors, 247 (8.7%) had seven authors, 233 (8.2%) had eight authors, 211 (7.4%) had nine authors, 154 (5.4%) had ten authors and 562 (20%) had more than ten authors. Figure 1 shows publication trends with articles searched by keywords "pluripotent stem cell" and "pluripotent stem cells" in terms of topic (title, abstract, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus), front page (title, abstract, author keywords), and article title only. In recent years, more pluripotent stem cell related articles have been published and the keywords are not always found in the article titles. Number of articles located via SCI-EXPANDED and the number of articles with the required keywords somewhere in the front page of the article were not the same. The rapid increase in the number of articles published after 2007 can be attributed to a couple of groundbreaking articles on pluripotent stem cell research. In 2006 and 2007, Takahashi at Kyoto University of Japan published as first author in Cell, articles entitled "Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors" (28) and "Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors" (29) . Within the same time period followed literature such as, "Induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from human somatic cells" (30) , "Generation of germline-competent induced pluripotent stem cells" (31) and "In vitro reprogramming of fibroblasts into a pluripotent ES-cell-like state" (32). Table 1 presents the top articles cited in TC2012. Out of these 10 articles, seven were published after 2003 and one in 1991, 1998 and 2001, respectively. The journals in which these articles were published were Cell [impact factor (IF2012=31.957)] with four articles, and Nature (IF2012=38.597) with three articles, and one each in Nature Biotechnology (IF2012=32.438), Science (IF2012=31.027) and Tissue Engineering (IF2012=4.065). The citation index of an article might not be a direct measure of its quality or importance; it is a measure of recognition that may suggest its visibility or impact on the scientific community (33) . Some scientists previously studied the citation life cycles of highly cited articles (34, 35) . The articles with top TC2012 were recently reported (24) . The citation lives of the top ten articles are shown in figure 2 . The articles with the highest TC2012 can be considered the most popular articles in the last 20 years. In general, only the trends of the top three articles by Takahashi and Yamanaka (28) in 2006, Takahashi et al. (29) in 2007, and Yu et al. (30) in 2007 saw continuous sharp increases since their publication years, while the slopes of the other publications climbed initially but then reached a plateau after which they continued to be of high impact with more than 100 annual citations. However, the article by Chaudhary and Roninson (12) in 1991, which reached its peak citation rate five years alter its publication, subsequently decreased to 17 citations in 2012. Highly cited articles may not always be those with the highest impact (36) . Some of the top ten highly cited articles in 2012 had just been published, for example in 2009 (25) . Their citation lives are shown in figure 3 . The articles with the highest C2012 were considered those with the most impact in the past few years. Recently published articles, for example, "Hotspots of aberrant epigenomic reprogramming in human induced pluripotent stem cells" (37) and "Somatic coding mutations in human induced pluripotent stem cells" (38) have great potential, but they did not have a high TC2012 because the time span was not sufficient to accumulate a large number of citations.
