A direct implementation of the Naive Bayesian method results in prediction accuracies between 60.84% and 81.08% LOO cross-validation was performed to evaluate the accuracy of the Bayesian classifier; this particular method was used to allow the calibration data to be reused as test samples while simulating the prediction of future unknowns [21] . The average accuracy from this validation was at 60.84 ± 35.96% for classifying amyloidogenic sequences, with 25.95% of the non-amyloidogenic sequences being misclassified ( To evaluate the effects of training set size, the holdout test set was combined with the original training set to generate a new set of classifiers. These were again subjected to LOO cross-validation, yielding a higher average accuracy of 81.08 ± 29.33% (Table 1 , AMC, new).
