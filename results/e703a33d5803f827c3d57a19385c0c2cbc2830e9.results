Based on the PCR assay, among the healthy puppies screened, 80% were found positive for C. difficile, and 10% were positive for CPV-2b. Among the affected puppies, all were positive for C. difficile, 90.3% were positive for CPV-2b, 17.7% were positive for cpe, 9.7% were positive for cpa toxin, 6.4% were positive for E. coli shiga toxin (STEC), 6.4% were positive for E. coli -enterotoxin (LT), and 3.2% were positive for CDV ( Figure-1) . None of the puppies were shedding both the CPV and CDV together whereas, cpe together with cpa and LT were detected in two of the puppies with hemorrhagic diarrhea. Salmonella sp., Campylobacter sp., and C. difficile toxin B, enteric CCoV and Rotavirus were found negative in 62 puppies with hemorrhagic diarrhea screened samples. The fecal antibiotic sensitivity results revealed gentamicin to be sensitive in 95% of the cases, azithromycin in 50%, enrofloxacin in 25%, cefotaxime in 20%, and tetracycline in 5% of the cases. The order of sensitivity was gentamicin > azithromycin > enrofloxacin > cefotaxime > tetracycline. Maximum resistance (100%) to amoxicillin and least resistance (5%) to gentamicin were observed.
