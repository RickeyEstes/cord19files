Thirty HCWs were observed removing their PPE (see Table 1 ). Forty-three percent of HCWs (13 of 30) removed their PPE in the correct order. However, only 17% of HCWs observed (5 of 30) removed their PPE in the correct order and disposed of it in the patient room. Only 13% of individuals (4 of 30) observed removed their PPE in the correct order and did so gently as recommended. Twenty-three percent (7 of 30) failed to remove their gloves gently. Forty percent (12 of 30) removed their PPE in the hallway, outside of the designated isolation area in the patient room. Fifty-seven percent (17 of 30) removed their gown before removing their gloves. Half (15 of 30) incorrectly removed their gown with a lot of movement (ie, wiggled their arms out and then tried to wiggle their gown over their head or failed to untie the gown before removing it from their body). Sixty percent of HCWs observed (18 of 30) properly disposed of their PPE in the patient room.
