Chemical analyses of milk replacer and starter are shown in Table 1 the LF and milk replacer was less than the detection limit of the assay (0.10 mg/kg). Lactoferrin content of the reconstituted milk replacer was 0.014 Â± 0.002 mg/ml. Preweaning fecal scores followed a quadratic pattern, with the group fed the 1-g treatment having the lowest score and the control group having the highest score ( Figure 1 ). During the second week, calves fed LF had lower fecal scores than did controls (Table 2) . Preweaning (Figure 2 ), wk 3, and overall number of days medicated responded in a quadratic fashion ( Table 2 ). The group fed the 1-g treatment had the lowest number of days medicated, and the control group had the highest. The number of days medicated in wk 6 decreased linearly with increasing amounts of LF. Calves consumed all colostrum and milk replacer. Body weight and weaning age were not different among treatments (Table 3) . No differences in starter DMI were observed (Table 3) . However, at wk 5 there was a linear trend (P = 0.10) for increasing starter DMI with increasing amounts of LF. As mentioned previously, the average weaning age for these calves was around 28 d, and while there was not a significant response seen in weaning age, the calves fed 0 and 1 g of LF tended to have later weaning dates than the calves fed 2 and 3 g LF. While only 1 to 2 d separate the weaning ages, this could make a difference in the average daily starter DMI seen during the week after weaning (wk 5). Preweaning average daily gain (ADG) increased linearly with LF supplementation (Table 3) . A quadratic response occurred in wk 5; the calves receiving the 0and 3-g treatments had higher ADG than the calves receiving the 1-and 2-g treatments (Table 3) . Preweaning feed efficiency (gain/DMI) increased linearly with increasing LF supplementation, whereas postweaning feed efficiency decreased linearly ( Table  Table 2 . Least square means of overall, preweaning, and postweaning fecal score and number of days medicated of calves fed different amounts of lactoferrin during the preweaning period. Calves were supplemented with either 0, 1, 2, or 3 g/d of lactoferrin added to milk replacer during the preweaning period. 3). Similar to ADG, wk-5 feed efficiency tended (P = 0.07) to respond quadratically, with the 0-g and 3-g treatments having higher feed efficiency than the 1-g and 2-g treatments. Overall, average daily heart girth gain increased linearly (P = 0.02) with LF level (0.25, 0.24, 0.29, 0.31 cm/d; SE = 0.02) for treatments 0, 1, 2, and 3 g/d.
