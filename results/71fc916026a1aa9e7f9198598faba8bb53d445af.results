The RT-PCR results of this current research revealed that 14 (54%) of sampled cats were positive for FCoV mRNA. The results are summarised in Table 1 , which also shows that 10 of the 16 female cats were positive (63%) compared with four of the 10 males (40%) but these proportions are not significantly different (P > 0.05, c 2 ). In the samples identified positive for FCoV, fragment of expected size 295 bp for M gene of FCoV were obtained in mRNA RT-PCR. Also glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) positive controls were detected in all tested samples (Fig 1) .
