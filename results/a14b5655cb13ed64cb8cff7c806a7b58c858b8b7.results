To achieve control of 90% of outbreaks, 80% of contacts needed to be traced and isolated for scenarios with a reproduction number of 2·5 ( figure 3 ). The probability of control was higher at all levels of contact tracing when the reproduction number was 1·5, and fell rapidly for a reproduction number of 3·5. At a reproduction number of 1·5, the effect of isolation was coupled with the chance of stochastic extinction resulting from overdispersion, 19 which is why some outbreaks were controlled even at 0% contacts traced. Isolation and contact tracing decreased transmission, as shown by a decrease in the effective reproduction number ( figure 3) . When the basic reproduction number was 1·5, the median estimate rapidly fell below 1, which indicated that control was probable. For the higher transmission scenarios, a higher level of contact tracing was needed to bring the median effective reproduction number below 1. The effect of isolation without contact tracing can be seen at 0%, where the effective reproduction number was lower than the simulated basic reproduction number because of rapid isolation (and ceasing transmission) of cases. The number of initial cases had a large effect on the probability of achieving control. With five initial cases, there was a greater than 50% chance of achieving control in 3 months, even at modest contact-tracing levels For code see https://github.com/ cmmid/ringbp (figure 4). More than 40% of these outbreaks were controlled with no contact tracing because of the combined effects of isolation of symptomatic cases and stochastic extinction. The probability of control dropped as the number of initial cases increased-eg, for 40 initial cases, 80% contact tracing did not lead to 80% of simulations controlled within 3 months. The delay from symptom onset to isolation had a major role in achieving control of outbreaks ( figure 4) . At 80% of contacts traced, the probability of achieving control fell from 89% to 31%, with a long delay from onset to isolation. If no transmission occurred before symptom onset, then the probability of achieving control was higher for all values of contacts traced ( figure 4) . The difference between 15% and 30% of transmission before symptoms had a marked effect on probability to control. We found this effect in all scenarios tested (appendix p 5). In scenarios in which only 10% of cases were asymptomatic, the probability that simulations were controlled by isolation and contact tracing for all values of contact tracing decreased ( figure 4) . For 80% of contacts traced, only 37% of outbreaks were controlled, compared with 89% without subclinical infection. These figures show the effect of changing one model assumption at a time; all combinations are given in the appendix, in comparison to the baseline scenario (appendix pp 2-5). In many scenarios, between 25 and 100 symptomatic cases occurred in a week at the peak of the simulated outbreak ( figure 5 ). All of these cases, and their contacts, would need to be isolated. Large numbers of new cases can overwhelm isolation facilities, and the more contacts that need to be traced, the greater the logistical task of following them up. In the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Liberia, each case reported between six and 20 contacts, 8 and the number of contacts seen in MERS outbreaks is often higher than that. 10 20 contacts for each of 100 cases means 2000 contacts traced to achieve control. Uncontrolled outbreaks typically had higher numbers of cases (appendix p 13). The maximum numbers of weekly cases Figure 5 : The maximum weekly cases requiring contact tracing and isolation in scenarios with 20 index cases that achieved control within 3 months Scenarios vary by reproduction number and the mean delay from onset to isolation. 15% of transmission occurred before symptom onset, and 0% subclinical infection. The percentage of simulations that achieved control is shown in the boxplot. This illustrates the potential size of the eventually controlled simulated outbreaks, which would need to be managed through contact tracing and isolation. *The interval extends out of the plotting region. figure 5 might appear counterintuitive, because a lower maximum number of weekly cases is not associated with higher outbreak control. This occurs because with better contact tracing it becomes possible to control outbreaks with higher numbers of weekly cases.
