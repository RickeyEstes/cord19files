Computational Analysis of the SARS-CoV Frameshift Signal Suggests the Presence of a Three-Helix-Containing RNA Pseudoknot À1 PRF signals typically have a tripartite organization. From 59 to 39, these are composed of a heptameric ''slippery site,'' a ''spacer'' region, and a stable mRNA secondary structure, typically an mRNA pseudoknot (reviewed in [11] ). A previous analysis of the SARS-CoV À1 PRF signal demonstrated that a sequence spanning nucleotide positions 13392-13472 satisfied these three requirements and was able to promote efficient À1 PRF in rabbit reticulocyte lysates [8] . The À1 PRF signal presented in that study contained a typical mRNA pseudoknot composed of two double-helical, Watson-Crick basepaired stems connected by two single-stranded loops ( Figure 1A) . The presence of a long, 29-nt loop 2 seemed to be unusual, prompting us to subject the sequence from positions 13392-13472 to additional computational analyses in an effort to further define the structure of this mRNA pseudoknot. The nucleotide sequence suspected of featuring a À1 PRF signal between ORF1a and ORF1b was scanned by RNAMotif [12] , using a pattern-based description capable of finding common À1 PRF signals in other RNA viruses. As expected, a so-called slippery site (UUUAAAC) and a large H-type pseudoknot were identified-the two primary stimulating elements required for efficient ribosomal slippage. This analysis was coupled with Pknots [13] , a software package that predicts the most thermodynamically stable structure for a given RNA sequence. The predicted structure for the SARS-CoV frameshift signal was extremely stable, with a calculated minimum free energy (MFE) of À26.68 kcal/mol. The surprising result was that the 29nt sequence designated loop 2 by Thiel et al. [8] was predicted to form a third helix, nested within the sequences defined by stems 1 and 2 ( Figure 1B) . Though a small, internally nested third helix (helix-3) has been shown to be present in the HIV-1 group O frameshift signal [14] , such an extensive basepairing pattern has not to our knowledge been heretofore demonstrated for any other viral frameshift signal. To determine the statistical significance of this finding, a distribution of MFE values taken from 500 randomly shuffled SARS-CoV frameshift signals was created. Each of the randomly shuffled sequences was folded using Pknots with the same parameters. The resulting normal distribution had mean MFE of À21.12 kcal/mol (standard deviation = 2.67, 5003), revealing that the predicted three-stemmed pseudoknot structure of the native sequence is highly significant with a z-score of À2.05 and a p value of 0.02 (one-tailed Student's t-test).
