Forty-three nurses worked at least one shift in a critical care unit where there was a patient with SARS; 37 worked in ICU and 6 in CCU. Eight nurses were infected with SARS, four who worked only in the ICU, three who worked only in the CCU, and one ICU nurse who worked one shift in the CCU. All cohort nurses were female; the mean age was 41 years (range 27-65 years). Only two nurses had a history of respiratory illness (one asthma, one bronchitis). Illness onset for the eight nurses was March 16-21. The most common symptoms included fever (8 [100%] of 8), myalgia (7 [87.5%] of 8), cough (6 [75%] of 8) and chills (6 [75%] of 8). Five nurses (62.5%) had headaches, and four (50%) had shortness of breath. Of the eight nurses, four (probable SARS case-patients) had unilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph and four (suspected SARS case-patients) had normal chest radiographs. SARS diagnosis in these eight nurses and in the three SARS source patients was confirmed by serology.
