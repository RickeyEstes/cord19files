C31 has pangenotype anti-HCV activity. The anti-HCV activity of the new SMCypI compound 31 (C31), our most potent inhibitor of Cyp PPIase activity, was tested in different HCV genotype models containing luciferase reporter genes, including an infectious chimeric J6/JFH1 (genotype 2a/2a) virus; genotype 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, and 5a HCV subgenomic replicons (HCV-SGRs); and a chimeric 2a/4a HCV-SGR containing a genotype 4a NS5A sequence (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). In addition, the anti-HCV activity of C31 was evaluated in the recently developed full-length infectious HCV genotype 3a model (DBN-3acc) (19) . ALV and CsA were used as controls in all experiments. C31 equally inhibited the replication of genotype 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, and 5a HCV-SGRs and chimeric genotype 2a/4a HCV-SGRs, with 50% effective concentrations (EC 50 s) ranging from 1.20 Ϯ 0.83 to 7.76 Ϯ 1.57 M (Table 1 ). C31 also inhibited the replication of the infectious J6/JFH1 virus, with a comparable EC 50 of 2.80 Ϯ 0.40 M. Finally, C31 inhibited DBN-3acc RNA replication in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal 244-fold HCV RNA reduction at 10 M (Fig. S3 ). C31 did not affect cell viability at its effective concentration (Fig. S2) . Altogether, these results demonstrate the pangenotype activity of the new SMCypI. C31 anti-HCV activity is related to its binding to CypA and inhibition of CypA PPIase activity. To understand the molecular mechanism of the anti-HCV action of our new SMCypI, the CypA binding modes of C31 and CsA were modeled ( Fig. 1A and B, Table S1 in the supplemental material). The Pearson correlation coefficient (R) and P value are shown on the graph. respectively). As shown in Fig. 1B , the structure of CypA in complex with C31 revealed its expected dual binding in the "hydrophobic pocket," the CypA PPIase active site, on the one hand and the "gatekeeper pocket" on the other hand (18, 20) . Interestingly, the methoxy group of compound 31 pushes Arg55 to create a hydrogen bond with the urea moiety of the compound. The CypA binding sites of C31 and CsA were partially overlapping, suggesting competitive binding to CypA. Thus, time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) was used to assess whether C31 competes with CsA for binding to purified CypA. Both nonlabeled CsA and ALV displaced labeled CsA from its CypA binding site, with K d (dissociation constant) values of 8.4 and Ͻ5 nM, respectively (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1C , C31 also displaced labeled CsA, with a K d value of 105 nM, confirming competition with CsA binding to CypA. Finally, we assessed whether the anti-HCV effect of the SMCypIs was related to their ability to inhibit CypA PPIase enzyme activity. For this, the anti-HCV activities of 6 different chemically related SMCypIs listed in Table S1 in the supplemental material, including C31, were determined with a genotype 1b HCV-SGR and plotted against their respective inhibitory activities in a PPIase enzyme assay. As shown in Fig. 1D , the anti-HCV activity of the SMCypIs was strongly correlated with their ability to inhibit PPIase activity, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 and a P value of Ͻ0.0001. Altogether, these results demonstrate that our new family of SMCypIs inhibits HCV replication by binding to both the PPIase catalytic pocket and the gatekeeper pocket of CypA, thus blocking its PPIase catalytic activity. C31 disrupts the CypA-NS5A interaction. Because CypA has been shown to play an important role in the HCV life cycle through its interaction with the NS5A protein, we measured the effect of C31 on the NS5A-CypA interaction. Purified CypA tagged with a polyhistidine sequence (CypA-6His) was bound to Ni-NTA (nitrilotriacetic acid) magnetic beads. A cell lysate containing wild-type NS5A (WT-NS5A) or the NS5A D320E mutant (NS5A-D320E) fused with the Renilla luciferase (NS5A-Rluc) was incubated with CypA-loaded magnetic beads in the presence or absence of C31 and of ALV, used as a control. After washing and elution with imidazole, the luciferase activity corresponding to NS5A-Rluc-CypA-6His interacting complexes was measured. As shown in Fig. 2 , the CypA-NS5A interaction was disrupted by both ALV and C31 in a dose-dependent The interaction between NS5A-Rluc and CypA-6His was assessed by means of a protein-protein interaction assay with Ni-NTA magnetic beads. After loading of CypA-6His, the beads were incubated with a lysate of Huh7.5 cells expressing WT-NS5A-Rluc (A) or NS5A-D320E-Rluc (B) and two concentrations of C31 and ALV. After washing, CypA-6His-interacting proteins were eluted with imidazole. The NS5A-Rluc activity was measured in the eluate. Huh7.5 cells expressing Rluc were used as a negative interaction control. The data are shown as means Ϯ SD of results from at least three independent experiments. NS, not significant; ***, P Ͻ 0.001. manner. The same result was observed with NS5A-D320E. Together, these results indicate that SMCypIs disrupt the interaction between CypA and the HCV NS5A protein through their binding to CypA.
