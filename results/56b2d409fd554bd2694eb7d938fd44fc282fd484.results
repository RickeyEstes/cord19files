The G4 ligand c-exNDI highly stabilizes the HSV-1 G4s. We have previously shown that c-exNDIs, compounds that were specifically developed against HIV-1 G4s, were indeed able to selectively recognize and bind with high affinity the HIV-1 G4 sequences 19 . The human telomeric G4-folded sequence and the G4s forming in the promoters of some oncogenes were also bound, albeit with lower affinity. To test the possibility to expand their antiviral activity, we here evaluated the ability of the lead member of the c-exNDIs family, c-exNDI 2 in 19 (herein called c-exNDI) to interact also with the G4s forming in the terminal repeats of HSV-1. Three sequences were considered: two sequences forming a four-stacked-G-quartet structure (un2 and gp054a) and one forming a three-G-quartet G4 (un3) 27 . Stability and conformation changes upon addition of c-exNDI were detected by circular dichroism (CD). In 100 mM K + , c-exNDI stabilized un3 and gp054a by >24.9 °C and 15.2 °C, respectively (Table 1) , and induced a slight change in the oligonucleotide G4 conformation at 20 °C (Fig. 1a,b) . In the case of gp054a, during thermal unfolding, the presence of the compound showed an increased stabilization of an alternative parallel-like conformation (Fig. 1b) . Un2 G4 displayed a starting T m above 90 °C in 100, 20 and 5 mM K + , therefore no appreciable ΔT m value could be obtained. However, a mild CD spectrum variation of un2 upon addition of c-exNDI indicated interaction (Fig. 1c ): in addition, in the absence of K + , an appreciable ΔT m was obtained with c-exNDI (Table 1 ). These data indicate that c-exNDI is able to effectively bind and stabilize all HSV-1 G4s. To confirm the increased stability of the viral G4s in the presence of the compound, a Taq polymerase stop assay was set up. Templates corresponding to un2, un3 and gp054a sequences (Table S1 ) were annealed to a primer and incubated with Taq polymerase for 30 min at 60 °C. A sequence unable to fold into G4 was alongside assayed as negative control. In the absence of K + , un2 and gp054a displayed a marked stop site corresponding to the first G of the most 3′ G-tract (Fig. 2a, lanes 1 un2 and gp054) , indicating stable G4 folding. The stop site increased upon addition of K + and c-exNDI (Fig. 2a, lanes 2-5 un2 and gp054) ; moreover, in the presence of the compound the full-length amplified product sharply decreased, indicating effective stabilization of un2 and gp054a G4s and thus inhibition of polymerase progression (Fig. 2a, lanes 3-5 un2 and gp054) . In the absence of K + no stop site was observed in the un3 sequence, which thus did not form G4 in these conditions (Fig. 2a , lane 1 un3); upon addition of K + and c-exNDI, a marked stop became visible at the most 3′ G-tract (Fig. 2a , lanes 2-5 un3), indicating effective stabilization also of this template. Quantification of the stop sites indicated a similar degree of polymerase stalling induced by the compound in the three G4-forming sequences (Fig. 2b) . To check the selectivity of c-exNDI for HSV-1 G4s, mass spectrometry (MS) competition was performed. Selected competitor G4s were hTel, c-myc and c-kit2 G4s, which correspond to the G4-forming sequences of the human telomeric repeat, the promoter of the c-myc oncogene and c-kit protooncogene 30, 31 , and HIV-1 LTR-III G4, the HIV-1 G4 previously shown to be selectively bound with high affinity by c-exNDI 5, 19 . In each case, HIV-1 LTR-III G4s were preferred over HSV-1 G4s, data that confirm c-exNDI selectivity for HIV-1 G4s 19 ( Table 2) . C-myc G4 was also always preferred and c-kit2 G4 was preferred vs HSV-1 un2 and gp054a. In contrast, HSV-1 un2 and un3 G4s were preferred over hTel. Gp054a was generally less preferentially bound over all the other analysed sequences. The measured selectivity did not depend on the starting stability of the competing G4s: in fact, in 100 mM K + , preferred G4s such as LTR-III (T m 52.9 ± 0.2 °C) and c-myc (T m > 90 °C) had T m values both lower and higher, respectively, than HSV-1 G4s (Table 1 ); in contrast, non-preferred G4s had similar T m values (hTel21 68.6 ± 0.2, c-kit2 72.9 ± 1.1 °C) ( Table 1) . C-exNDI displays potent anti-HSV-1 activity. Since our data indicate that even if HSV-1 G4s are not totally preferred, nonetheless they are preferred over telomeric G4s, the most abundant cellular G4 structures in infected cells, we tested the ability of c-exNDI to inhibit HSV-1. In plaque assay, the compound showed 50% inhibition of HSV-1 production (IC 50 ) at 18.3 ± 1.4 nM (Fig. 3a) . Interestingly, the compound concentration able to kill 50% of the cells, as measured by MTT assay, was 628.4 ± 2.1 nM, resulting in a remarkable selectivity index (SI = 34.3 ± 2.7) (Fig. 3a ). To confirm this data, a recombinant HSV-1 expressing GFP fused to the viral protein VP16 (HSV-1 [V41]) was used to infect cells; this mutant virus is characterized by normal replication kinetics and yields 32 . Analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Cells were treated with c-exNDI and acyclovir (ACV), the antiviral drug of choice for treatment of HSV-1 infections 33 , here used as the reference drug to which compare the anti-HSV-1 potency of c-exNDI. Both compounds were used at low/non cytotoxic concentration (i.e. 100 nM c-exNDI and 3 μM ACV) corresponding to 5 times their IC 50 values 34, 35 . Cells infected with HSV-1 [V41] and treated with c-exNDI or ACV at 24 h.p.i were monitored for their GFP fluorescence. C-exNDI (Fig. 3b ,c) induced an almost complete reduction of GFP fluorescence (8.6%, expressed as mean of GFP fluorescence), whereas 26% of cells remained fluorescent upon treatment with ACV (Fig. 3b,c) . To investigate the mechanism of action of c-exNDI, mRNA levels of representative viral genes were measured at 4 and 24 h.p.i. upon treatment with c-exNDI. In particular, genes corresponding to immediate-early (IE: ICP22, ICP47), early (E: UL30) and late (L: UL36) proteins were considered. At 4 h.p.i., no significant inhibition of viral mRNAs production was observed, whereas at 24 h.p.i. all mRNAs were reduced to a similar extent (28-45%) (Fig. 4a) . A similar trend has been reported for ACV 36 . To assess the main and temporally last viral step targeted by c-exNDI, we performed a time of addition (TOA) assay where the maximal low/mild-cytotoxic concentration of the compound was added at different times post-infection (corresponding to different viral cycle steps). The compound maintained its inhibitory activity when added up to 8 h.p.i (Fig. 4b) . This is the time when viral replication occurs; indeed, ACV, a known inhibitor of the viral DNA polymerase 37 , showed a remarkably overlapping TOA profile. These data indicate that c-exNDI inhibits viral production mainly by targeting viral replication. Inhibition of viral DNA replication was further confirmed by qPCR analysis. At 4 h.p.i no reduction in viral DNA replication and production was observed, whereas at 24 h.p.i viral DNA was reduced of about 40% (Fig. S1 ), similarly to what observed with another G4-ligand targeting HSV-1 DNA 27 .
