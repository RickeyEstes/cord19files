A total of 63 samples were collected over a 17-month period across the three sampling locations for human and bovine virus analysis of which 20 were collected during low-flow periods and 43 were collected during rainfall or snowmelt runoff periods. Human viruses were present in 49% and bovine viruses were present in 41% of these samples (Fig. 4) . Overall average concentrations were 56 genomic copies/L for the sum of human viruses and 1.2 genomic copies/L for the sum of bovine viruses.
