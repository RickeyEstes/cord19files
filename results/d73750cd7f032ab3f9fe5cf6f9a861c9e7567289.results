MHV N protein forms large oligomers in vitro. To gain insights into the self-assembly mechanism of the N protein, we decided to use an in vitro approach to exclude the eventual involvement of other factors in this event. Since order-disorder and secondary structure predictions coupled with sequence alignment has highlighted that all CoV N proteins have the modular organization as MHV N protein, we used this as a model first. Hence, MHV N protein was expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion construct and purified using glutathione Sepharose (GSH-beads). The immobilized GST fusion protein or GST was incubated with bacterial cell extract of E. coli expressing recombinant 6xHis-tagged full length MHV N protein. As illustrated in Fig. 1b , recombinant 6xHis-tagged N protein specifically bound GST-N protein but not GST alone, which is in agreement with previous reports 19, 23, 24, [27] [28] [29] and further shows that N proteins self-interact directly. Since it has been shown that CoV N proteins also bind non-viral RNA 19, 21, [37] [38] [39] [40] , we also investigated the association between purified GST-tagged and 6xHis-tagged N proteins after RNase A treatment to exclude a role of bacterial RNA in the assayed interaction. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1a , RNase A treatment removed large part of the RNA present in the bacterial extract and nucleic acids were not detected associated to the purified N protein even when this was not exposed to RNase A. Importantly, removal of RNA did not affect the binding between the two N protein fusions ( Supplementary Fig. S1b ). We concluded that the bacterial RNA does not participate in the in vitro interaction of MHV N protein. To determine whether the N-protein form homo-dimers or homo-oligomers, we sedimented recombinant 6xHis-tagged N protein on a continuous 5-20% glycerol gradient For comparison sedimentation of the protein standards ovalbumin (44 kDa) and thyroglobulin (669 kDa) was analysed, which could be recovered in fractions 1-2 and 6-8, respectively ( Fig. 1c and d) . GAPDH, which is present in the cytoplasm as a monomer 41 , was detected in the first fractions of a sedimentation performed with a LR7 cell extract. In contrast, the 6xHis-tagged N protein was exclusively found in fractions 8-11, indicating that it forms large homo-oligomers ( Fig. 1c and d) . MHV N protein assembles in cytoplasmic oligomers over the course of an infection. We explored whether the N protein also forms oligomers over the course of an infection. In MHV-infected cells, the N protein localizes to three distinct locations: RTCs, virions and cytoplasm 2, 9, 10, 13, 42 . Since the N protein is in large complexes with other viral proteins in both RTCs and virions, we decided to focus on its cytoplasmic pool and to separate it from the two other populations through differential centrifugations. We generated cell extracts (Ext) from MHV-infected LR7 cells and centrifuged them at 15,000 × g to discard the pellet P13, which includes compartments with low sedimentation rates such as whole cells or debris, nuclei and mitochondria. The resulting supernatant S13 was subsequently centrifuged at 110,000 × g to sediment organelles such as the Golgi apparatus but also virions that could have remained associated to the cell surface at the moment of the lysis 43, 44 . Successful fractionation of each step was followed by visualization of the membrane bound protein VAPA for P13 45 as well as the cytoplasmic proteins GAPDH and tubulin for S45, which also contained soluble N protein (Fig. 2a) . Thus, we concluded that the cytoplasmic pool of the N protein is enriched in the S45 supernatant. The S45 supernatant was then applied onto the same continuous 5-20% glycerol gradient employed for the analysis of the size of recombinant N protein complexes. Interestingly, cytoplasmic N protein from MHV-infected cells was exclusively detected in the last fractions of the gradient similarly to recombinant N protein, while GAPDH was found only in the low-density fractions ( Fig. 2b and c) . A small difference in size between the MHV N protein oligomers formed in vitro and in vivo, however, was detected. This could be due to either a slight inhibition of recombinant N protein self-interaction caused by the 6xHis tag, or a better oligomerization in vivo because of cellular factors such as molecular chaperones. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that there are host proteins that associate to N protein oligomers. The S45 supernatant was also incubated with RNase A to degrade all nucleic acids ( Supplementary Fig. S1c ), before applying the sample onto the glycerol gradient to examine whether N protein oligomerization is influenced by binding to gRNA in vivo. This treatment, however, did not change the sedimentation profile of the N protein ( Fig. 2b and c). Altogether these data show that the MHV N protein forms large cytoplasmic oligomers in infected cells, and that this aggregation does not depend on its binding to gRNA. Moreover, this result underlines the validity of using recombinant N protein to study its oligomerization determinants.
