Sequence identity of TRSV genomic segments and morphology of the virus isolates. Sequence analysis of cDNA libraries from purified virus preparation revealed overlapping and nonoverlapping clones of different lengths. About 75% of the clones (n ϭ 40) matched the genome sequences of common honeybee viruses, including BQCV, DWV, and Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV). Unexpectedly, about 20% of the clones (n ϭ 10) matched the sequences of TRSV for two genomic segments in the NCBI database. By assembling sequence fragments from different cDNA clones, we obtained a 1,545-bp length of nucleotide sequences encoding the RNA helicase and covering~21% of the coding region of the polyprotein gene of genomic RNA-1. We also obtained a 2,024-bp long sequence encoding the complete capsid protein. A BLAST search of the helicase sequence showed highest identity with a TRSV strain isolated from bud blight disease of soybean (GenBank accession no. U50869), with 88% homology at the nucleotide level and 96% homology at the amino acid level. A BLAST search of the DNA fragment encoding the capsid protein showed strongest similarity to a TRSV strain from bean (GenBank accession no. L09205), with 96% homology at the nucleotide level and 99% homology at the amino acid level. The cDNA sequences were used to design two primer sets, TRSV-F1/R1 and TRSV-F2/R2 (Fig. 1) , for the subsequent studies of TRSV replication and distribution in honeybees and Varroa mites. Electron microscopy showed no obvious contamination from host cellular material. Negatively stained viral particles had a diameter of 25 to 30 nm and an icosahedral shape, typical morphological features of secoviruses (Fig. 2) , and RT-PCR assay confirmed the presence of TRSV in the viral preparation for EM analysis. The purity of the virus preparation in our study was confirmed by electron microscopy. Electron microscopy showed no obvious contamination from host cellular material. Negatively stained viral particles had a diameter of 25 to 30 nm and an icosahedral shape, typical morphological features of secoviruses (Fig. 2) . However, the viral preparation was determined by RT-PCR to contain not only TRSV but other bee viruses as well, including BQCV, DWV, and IAPV. It was not possible to definitely distinguish TRSV viral particles morphologically from these other bee viruses. Distribution and replication of TRSV in infected honeybees. Although no apparent disease symptoms were observed in examined bees, TRSV was widespread in honeybee tissues, which was confirmed by the amplification of a 731-bp PCR fragment with the TRSV-F2/R2 primer set. Except for the compound eyes, TRSV was found in all tissues examined, including hemolymph, wings, legs, antennae, brain, fat bodies, salivary gland, gut, nerves, tracheae, and hypopharyngeal gland. Although there was the same amount of input cDNA, the intensity of the PCR signals varied between samples. Tissues of the gut and muscle had weaker PCR bands than other tissues, indicating a relatively lower level of TRSV infection (Fig. 3) . It is unclear if the absence of PCR amplification in the compound eye was due to PCR inhibition previously reported for that tissue (27) . TRSV is a positive-stranded RNA virus replicating through the production of a negative-stranded intermediate; therefore, the presence of negative-stranded RNA constitutes proof of active viral replication. To investigate the replication of TRSV in bees, negative-stranded RT-qPCR was performed using a tagged primer system (28) . Amplification and sequence analysis of a 462-bp negative-strand-specific product in different tissues showed that active replication of TRSV occurs in most tissues (Fig. 4) . A single peak on the melting curve analysis corroborated the specificity of the amplicon. The lack of amplification following RT-qPCR of total RNA without primers in the reverse transcription reaction mixture ruled out any nonspecific effect from self priming due to the secondary structure of viral RNA or false priming by antigenomic viral RNA or cellular RNAs. Among tissues with detectable levels, the relative abundance of negative-stranded TRSV varied significantly (P Ͻ 0.001; one-way analysis of variance [ANOVA]). The brain had the lowest detectable level of negativestranded TRSV and was chosen as the calibrator. The abundance of TRSV in other tissues relative to the brain ranged from 56-fold to 957-fold. The concentration of TRSV in additional body tissues showed the following ranking: muscle Ͼ hypopharyngeal gland Ͼ leg Ͼ fat body Ͼ trachea Ͼ hemolymph Ͼ antenna Ͼ nerve Ͼ wing. The replication of TRSV was not evident in the salivary gland, gut or compound eye (Fig. 5) , although the presence of PCR inhibitors in the latter is a possibility (27) . Localization of TRSV in the ectoparasitic Varroa mite of honeybees. In situ hybridization showed that TRSV could also be detected in the ectoparasitic mite, V. destructor, collected from the same TRSV-infected bee colonies. Sections hybridized with a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled TRSV RNA probe had strong staining within the storage organs of the mite, the upper and lower gastric ceca (Fig. 6A ), although histopathological signs were not evident in these areas. No positive signal of TRSV was observed in other mite tissues, and no signal was observed with the negative-control probe (Fig. 6B) . Prevalence of TRSV infection in honeybee colonies. Of ten bee colonies included in this study, six were classified as described in Materials and Methods as strong colonies and four were classified as weak colonies. Both TRSV and IAPV were absent in bees from strong colonies in any month, but both were found in bees from weak colonies. As with other detected viruses, TRSV showed a significant seasonality. The infection rate of TRSV increased from spring (7%) to summer (16.3%) and autumn (18.3%) and peaked in winter (22.5%) before colony collapse. Of viruses detected in weak colonies, DWV was the most commonly detected, with an average annual infection rate of 44%, followed by BQCV, IAPV, and TRSV. Additionally, a low incidence of SBV and chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) infections was also detected in bees from weak colonies. While DWV and BQCV were detected in both healthy and weak colonies all year round, the prevalence of DWV and BQCV in weak colonies was significantly higher than that in strong colonies. The bee populations in weak colonies that had a high level of multiple virus infections began falling rapidly in late fall. All colonies that were classified as strong in this study survived through the cold winter months, while weak colonies perished before February. In Fig. 7A and B, the seasonal prevalence of TRSV along with other bee viruses in both weak and strong colonies is presented. Phylogenetic characterization of TRSV isolates. Figure 8 illustrates the phylogenetic relationship among our TRSV isolates and viruses with existing GenBank TRSV sequence records, based on the partial capsid protein sequence amplified with primers. TRSV isolates infecting plants constitute the early lineages of the phylogenetic tree, and TRSV isolates from honeybees, bee pollen, and Varroa mites clustered together, branching next from the early lineage. There is no obvious sequence divergence among TRSV isolates from bees, mites, and bee pollen.
