To determine whether the removal of cholesterol from the target membrane affected NDV entry into cells, ELL-0 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of MβCD. MβCD treatment of cells resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the cellular cholesterol content (Fig. 1a) . Approximately, 85-90% of cellular cholesterol was removed at a concentration of 10 mM MβCD. The fusion of NDV with MβCD-treated ELL-0 cells was significantly reduced in a dosedependent manner, as determined by an R18 transfer assay (Fig. 1b and Table 1 ). At a concentration of 5 mM MβCD (60% of cholesterol reduction, Fig. 1a ), viral fusion was reduced by about 25% (Fig. 1b and Table 1 ), whereas the highest concentration of MβCD assayed, (10 mM, which led to 80% of cholesterol reduction (Fig. 1a) ) elicited about 40% of NDV fusion inhibition (Fig. 1b and Table 1 ). The effect of cholesterol depletion on NDV attachment was analyzed by flow cytometric assays. The binding of NDV to cholesteroldepleted cells was reduced by about 50% as compared with the controls in 10 mM MβCD-treated cells (Fig. 2a and Table 1 ). As a negative control, the virus was inactivated by heating at 100°C for 2 min. No differences with samples in the absence of virus were detected, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 . To analyze whether cholesterol depletion was affecting the expression of viral receptors at the cell surface, after the MβCD treatment, cells were labeled with two fluorescent-labeled lectins, FITC-MALI and FITC-SNA. The binding of FITC-MALI to cells preincubated in the presence of sialidase from Vibrio cholerae was reduced as assessed by fluorescence microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S3 ) revealing the specificity of lectin binding to sialoglycoconjugates. The degree of binding of both lectins to treated cells was similar to that of control cells (Fig. 2b) , indicating that after cholesterol removal the receptor concentration was not modified at the cell surface. Nevertheless, when we analyzed the lectin-labeled cells by confocal microscopy, the FITC-MALI lectin-staining pattern was altered (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. S4 ): upon MβCD treatment, the cell surface displayed patches enriched in sialic acid compound (Fig. 2c ), in agreement with previous reports [34, 46] . The infectivity of NDV was probed by FACS-based assays after 24 h of infection (Fig. 3a) . Pre-treatment of ELL-0 cells with increasing concentrations of MβCD prior to exposure to 5 mois of NDV resulted in a reduction in viral infectivity, being about 50% less than that of untreated control cells at the highest MβCD concentration assayed (15 mM) ( Fig. 3a and Table 1 ). In negative controls, the virus was inactivated by heating at 100°C for 2 min. No differences with samples in the absence of virus were detected, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S5 . Additionally, cellular cholesterol was depleted at several time points post-infection by treatment with 10 mM MβCD (Fig. 3b) . ELL-0 cells were infected with rNDV-F3aa-mRFP recombinant NDV. Viral infectivity was monitored at 24 h post-infection, as detailed in Materials and methods. The results showed that the addition of MβCD at 1 h post-infection did not exert any inhibitory effect on NDV. Moreover, treatment with MβCD at 20 min post-infection only had a moderate effect (Fig. 3b) . These results suggest that cholesterol is required during the entry of NDV into the host cell during the first stages of viral infectivity. To further check that the inhibitory effects of MβCD treatment on NDV activities described above were due to the removal of cellular cholesterol, the effect of cholesterol replenishment was analyzed ( Fig. 4 and Table 2 ). After the depletion of cellular cholesterol by pre-treatment with 10 mM MβCD, cholesterol-depleted cells were incubated in the presence of MβCD previously complexed to cholesterol, acting as a cholesterol donor to cells [12] . The addition of 200 μM of exogenous cholesterol almost completely restored cellular Cholesterol was extracted and quantified as described in Materials and methods. Data are means ± standard deviations of three independent experiments. (b) R18-labeled NDV was bound to MβCD-treated cells and untreated cells (control) for 1 h at 4°C, after which they were allowed to fuse for 1 h at 37°C. Fusion was assessed by transfer of the R18 red dye to the cell membrane. As a control of non-specific dye transfer, NDV was inactivated by incubation at 100°C for 2 min (NDV-R18 inact). In these samples, non-significant dye transfer was observed in both untreated and MβCD-treated cells. cholesterol levels to those of the controls (Fig. 4a) . Our data revealed a correlation between the degree of cholesterol replacement (Fig. 4a ) and the degree of recovery of NDV activities ( Fig. 4 and Table 2 ). Viral fusion and infectivity were recovered by almost 100% in comparison with the control (Fig. 4b, d and Table 2 ); viral binding was recovered up to 70% (Fig. 4c) . In sum, the recovery of viral activities following cholesterol replenishment strongly supports the notion that the inhibitory effects of MβCD treatment on NDV activities would be due specifically to cholesterol depletion per se, and that this effect would be reversible. The effect of MβCD treatment on the synthesis of viral proteins in NDV-infected cells was also analyzed (Fig. 5) . In these experiments, Fig. 1b. (c) After cellular cholesterol replenishment, NDV at a moi of 5 was allowed to bind cells for 1 h at 4°C. Then, the binding of NDV to target cells was analyzed by a FACS-based immunoassay as detailed in Materials and methods. The negative control corresponds to cells in the absence of virus. (d) Viral infectivity was analyzed by infecting control, cholesterol-depleted and cholesterol replenished ELL-0 cells with 1 moi of the recombinant rNDV-F3aa-mRFP for 1 h at room temperature. After 24 h at 37°C, the cells were observed under an Olympus IX51 inverted fluorescence microscope with a 10× objective. Quantification of infectivity was accomplished by measuring the area of red fluorescence (infected cells that express the RFP) in pixels referred to the area of nuclei (blue fluorescence) of the field in three to seven random fields. Areas were quantified using the analysis tool in ImageJ software. Fig. 4d , means of two independent experiments. infection. These results indicated that the synthesis of viral proteins was reduced in cholesterol-depleted cells, in support of the infectivity inhibition data shown in Fig. 3 . We observed a certain stimulatory effect of protein expression in the presence of 200 μM exogenous cholesterol, which correlates with some enhancement of viral infectivity ( Table 2) . This enhancement might be related to the increase of cholesterol in the cell membrane above normal values (Fig. 4a) , although further research is needed to clarify the significance of this enhancement. Since it is reported that MβCD-driven removal of cholesterol led to a disruption of the cholesterol-rich DRMs of lipid rafts, we next wished to determine whether NDV might localize to these membrane microdomains during entry. We analyzed the association of viral proteins with isolated DRMs from ELL-0 cells by treatment with TX100 at low temperatures, followed by discontinuous OptiPrep flotation gradients, as detailed in Materials and methods. As a control, caveolin, a protein raft marker, was mainly present in the detergent-resistant fractions 5 and 6, whereas β-tubulin was mainly found in the detergent-soluble membrane fractions 11 and 12 (Fig. 6a) . For some samples, NDV was bound to cells for 1 h at 4°C (Fig. 6a, HN 4°C) ; for other samples, after virus binding for 1 h at 4°C, cells were shifted to 37°C for an additional hour (Fig. 6a, HN 4°C/37°C ). Then, the cells were lysed and layered at the bottom of a 40%-30%-5% OptiPrep density gradient. Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed by Western blotting, probing with a polyclonal anti-NDV antibody. We found that after virus binding at 4°C, HN was distributed in both the low density Triton-insoluble fractions 5 and 6 as well as in the detergent-soluble fractions. Nevertheless, after viruscell samples shifting to 37°C, the association of HN to raft fractions was limited to fraction 6. These results were also corroborated in HeLa cells, where HN protein was distributed in both the raft and non-raft fractions (Fig. 6b, HN 4°C/37°C ). After MβCD incubation of cells (Fig. 6b, HN 10 mM MβCD), the viral protein concentration was reduced and was mainly associated with the non-raft fractions. After the replenishment of cholesterol (Fig. 6b, HN 10 mM MβCD + 200 μM Cho), the distribution of HN in the flotation gradient fractions was as observed in the case of the control cells (Fig. 6b HN 4°C/37°C ).
