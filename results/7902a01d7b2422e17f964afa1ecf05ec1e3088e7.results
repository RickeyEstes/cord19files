A total of 406 DHPs responded to the questionnaire giving the response rate of 90.22% (406 out of 452). Majority of them were male (59.9 %) and belonged to all dental health professional categories with undergraduates/ graduates most in number (89.4%). Nearly half of the study participants mainly worked in university dental clinics with majority (57.1%) of them having 1-2 years of experience, and (57.1%) of them were Saudi nationals. The characteristics of respondents are mentioned in table 1. Table 2 shows the frequency distribution of responses of the study participants to the knowledge, attitude and practice on droplet and airborne isolation precautions. The results of the study revealed that for knowledge the percentage of correct answers was lowest (56.4%) for the question number 4 (Mask should be worn if or when a subject is within a 90 cm distance from a patient under droplet precaution care) and was highest (87.9%) for the question number 1 (Patients with a droplet spread disease should be isolated in a private room). This suggests that the DHPs are very well knowledgeable of the droplet spread diseases and isolation of patients with such diseases. Similarly, for attitude towards airborne and droplet precautions lowest and highest responses were observed for the question numbers 10 (Wards should be notified prior to receiving a patient requiring airborne precautions) and 5 (Hospital wards should be notified prior to receiving a patient needing droplet precautions) respectively. Additionally, frequency of correct response for practice section was lowest for the 2nd, 6th and 11th questions and highest for the question number 3 (Patients with a droplet spread disease should wear a mask during transport). Table 3 shows the mean and standard deviation of knowledge, attitude and practice scores for different groups. A total mean score for knowledge was 10.61 ± 1.19; Mean scores for attitude and practice 50.54 ± 7.53 and 8.50 ± 2.14 were obtained respectively. All the demographic variables (gender, qualification, designation, main work place and nationality) were significantly associated with mean knowledge score p<0.05. Female (8.87 vs 8.21, p = 0.013), those having Post graduate and above qualification (9.58 vs 8.37, p=001) and non-saudi (8.91 vs 8.20, p=005) DHPs showed significantly higher knowledge score as compared to their counter parts. Dental practitioners, those working in government sector and having experience of above 10 years showed significantly (p<0.05) high mean knowledge score. On contrary years of experience was only the demographic variable significantly associated with mean attitude score. DHPs with above 10 years of experience showed significantly (p<0.05) high attitude score within the group. Similarly, all the demographic variables were significantly associated with practice score except for the years of experience. Kruskal-Wallis tests with Bonferroni-Holm corrected Mann-Whitney post hoc tests for multiple comparisons for type of DHPs showed statistically significant differences (p<0.01) in knowledge between dental students and dental practitioners, students and dental assistants, interns and dental practitioners, and interns and dental assistants. However attitude did not differ significantly among DHPs. But Practice score significantly differed between dental students and dental assistants (p<0.01). Similarly, DHPs working in the private sector showed significantly high mean rank compared to the government DHPs (p<0.01). Spearman's correlation test revealed a significant linear positive correlation between knowledge and attitude(r-0.501, P-0.01), knowledge and practice (r-0.185, P-0.01) and attitude and practice (r-0.351, P-0.01) of DHPs about airborne isolation precautions table 4. In general study results suggested that DHPs considered in the present study showed a good knowledge, positive attitude and good practice towards droplet and airborne isolation precautions.
