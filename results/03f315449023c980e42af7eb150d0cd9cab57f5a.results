The overall seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in all collected sera (3821 samples) from the seven countries (Egypt, Uganda, Senegal, Tunisia, Jordan, KSA, and Iraq) as illustrated in Figure 1 was 73.7% with seroprevalence of 30.3% in juvenile (<2 years old) and 82.6% in adult camels (>2 years old) ( Figure 2 ). The prevalence rate of MERS-CoV RNA in 4331 nasal swabs collected from the seven countries was 4.7%, with virus detection rates of 5.5% and 1.4% in adult and juvenile, respectively. Male camels had a significantly higher detection rate of MERS-CoV than female camels (8% and 1.2%, respectively, p-value < 0.001) ( Figure 2 ). No significant difference in the seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in male and female camels was detected (76.5% and 71.5%, respectively).
