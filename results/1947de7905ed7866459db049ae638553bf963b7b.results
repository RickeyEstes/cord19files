ACE2 is localized in lipid rafts in Vero E6 cells, cholesterol depletion does not affect the surface expression of ACE2, but shifted it to nonraft fraction ACE2 was identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV [11] . We determined its relationship with lipid rafts by biochemical fractionation and confocal microscopy. In normal Vero E6 cells, approximately 70% of ACE2 was co-fractionated with the raft marker caveolin-1 in fractions 3 and 4 (Fig. 1A, untreated) . In contrast, a nonraft marker, transferrin receptor CD71 [12] , was confined to the detergent-soluble fractions 10 and 11 (Fig. 1A, untreated) . The results show that ACE2 is largely associated with lipid rafts in Vero E6 cells. After extraction of cholesterol, the localization of CD71 in cellular membrane remained unchanged (Fig. 1A , MbCD-treated), but both ACE2 and caveolin-1 were shifted to fractions 10 and 11 (Fig. 1A, MbCD-treated) . No obvious change in the cell surface expression of ACE2 was observed (Fig. 1C) using flow cytometry. The results indicate that disruption of lipid rafts does not block the translocation of ACE2 to the cell surface. The association of ACE2 with lipid rafts was investigated in intact cells by confocal microscopy. The fluores-cently labeled CT-B could specifically binds to a raft-resident ganglioside GM1 [12] . Treatment of Vero E6 cells with Alexa 594-conjugated CT-B alone resulted in a uniform unpatched staining pattern of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1B, GM1, unpatched) . However, incubation with rabbit anti-CT-B led to the formation of large GM1 patches (Fig. 1B, GM1, patched) . Incubation of cells simultaneously with Alexa 594-conjugated CT-B/rabbit anti-CT-B and goat anti-ACE2/Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat antibody, resulted in substantial colocalization of ACE2 with GM1 patches (Fig. 1B overlay) . The results demonstrate that ACE2 and GM1 reside in the same lipid environment in Vero E6 cells.
