We identified 1672 articles through the electronic database search and one additional record through hand search of references in the current literature. Duplicates were excluded and of the remaining 1349 titles and abstracts, 162 were eligible for full text assessment. Of these, 44 studies were included for qualitative synthesis as depicted in the PRISMA flow chart (Fig. 1) . Eligible studies were conducted between 1st January 1967 and 12th August 2018 and included 489 participants from 13 countries: 24 studies from Asia, 15 from the Americas, 4 from Europe and 1 from Africa. Participants' age at presentation ranged from 1 day to 17 years. Of the 44 studies, 22 were case reports, 18 were case series, three cross-sectional studies and one cohort study. Thirty-three of the 44 included studies documented cytohistological assessment of bronchioalveolar lavage and/or lung biopsy ( Fig. 2 and Appendix B).
