Identification of B38-CAP as an ACE2-like enzyme. To address whether there are any ACE2-like proteins in bacteria, we first searched published crystal structures of M32 carboxypeptidase in the database of MEROPS (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/) and found that three microbial M32 carboxypeptidases are reported for their three-dimensional (3D) structures, including BS-CAP (or BsuCP) (B. subtilis), Taq (Thermus aquaticus), and Pfu (P. furiosus). Although BS-CAP, Taq, or Pfu showed low sequence identity to ACE2, we examined whether BS-CAP, Taq, or Pfu has structural similarity to human ACE2 by using the program of Molecular Operating Environment (Chemical Computing Group, Canada). The program detected only BS-CAP as a protein structurally related to ACE2 and the 3D structures of both proteins are mostly merged (Fig. 1a) . Importantly, the position of key amino acids constituting the catalytic site (His-Glu-X-X-His motif) and substrate-binding region (Arg273/348, His345/234, His505/408, and Tyr515/420 in ACE2/BS-CAP) were almost identical between both proteins, implicating that BS-CAP may have similar substrate preference to ACE2 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1 , and Supplementary Table 1) . Indeed, a previous study on BS-CAP structure had predicted that there may be structural similarity between ACE2 and BS-CAP 24 . We further searched for bacterial proteins that exhibit high sequence identity to BS-CAP in the BLAST and found that BA-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, is homologous to BS-CAP ( Table 1) . Furthermore, we found that our recently identified bacterial strain, Paenibacillus sp. B38, also has a similar M32 carboxypeptidase to BS-CAP with high sequence identity (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1 , and Supplementary Table 1 ). We termed this Paenibacillus sp. B38derived M32 carboxypeptidase as B38-CAP hereafter. Despite evolutionally distant relationship to ACE2 (Fig. 1b) , these bacterial enzymes are likely homologs of ACE2 with divergent evolution. We prepared recombinant proteins of BS-CAP, BA-CAP, and B38-CAP in the Escherichia coli protein expression system (Fig. 1c) and all of the proteins were highly expressed and soluble in E. coli and easily purified with anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography ( Supplementary Fig. 2a) . Indeed, the production of recombinant B38-CAP in E. coli (16.8 mg protein yield per culture volume (L)) was more efficient in terms of the recovered protein amount compared with the production of His-tagged rhACE2 in baculovirus-Sf9 insect cells (5.42 mg protein yield per culture volume (L)). Moreover, the time for culture and purification of B38-CAP (2 days) was shorter than that of rhACE2 (6 days, not including baculovirus preparation) (Supplementary Fig. 2a-d) . We first tested whether these enzymes have ACE2-like proteolytic activity to hydrolyze the fluorogenic peptide Nma-His-Pro-Lys(Dnp), which we had previously developed as a specific ACE2 substrate 19 . As a result, all the enzymes were revealed to catalyze the hydrolysis of the ACE2 substrate Nma-His-Pro-Lys (Dnp) (Fig. 1d and Table 1 ). When we incubated Ang II peptide with BS-CAP, BA-CAP, or B38-CAP in vitro, all of the enzymes converted Ang II to Ang 1-7 ( Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 3a ). On the other hand, the dependency of ACE2-like enzymatic activity on anion (Cl âˆ’ ) concentration is much higher in B38-CAP than in BS-CAP and BA-CAP (Fig. 1d) , suggesting that B38-CAP is the most potent in ACE2-like activity under physiological conditions of mammals. Analysis for kinetic constants with the fluorogenic ACE2 substrate revealed that B38-CAP has the same potency as rhACE2 protein (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3b) . Consistently, the IC 50 values of ACE2 inhibitor (MLN-4760) for B38-CAP and human ACE2 were almost equivalent (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3c ). In addition, the dependence of B38-CAP proteolytic activity on pH and temperature was also similar to that of ACE2 6, 19 (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e) . Moreover, when various and Supplementary Fig. 4a ). For non-ACE2-substrate peptides Ang 1-7 and angiotensin 1-9 (Ang 1-9), however, B38-CAP did cleave Ang 1-9, whereas it did not affect Ang 1-7 (Fig. 1f , g and Table 2 ). Consistently, B38-CAP converted Ang I to Ang 1-7 (Fig. 1h) , which is distinct from ACE2 conversion of Ang I to Ang 1-9 4 . To address how B38-CAP converts Ang I to Ang 1-7, we conducted kinetic analysis (Fig. 1i, j and Supplementary Fig. 4b ). Ang 1-9, Ang II, and Ang 1-7 peptides were detectable at 10 min after mixing Ang I with B38-CAP (Fig. 1j) . Ang 1-7 production increased and finally reached the same levels of the initial Ang I amount, whereas Ang I was undetectable at 90 min (Fig. 1i, j) . On the other hand, Ang 1-9 and Ang II exhibited a minor peak at 20 min and 60 min, respectively, and both peptides became undetectable at the end of the reaction period (Fig. 1j) . Consistent with peptide kinetics, the amino acids leucine (Leu), histidine (His), and phenylalanine (Phe) were generated in the same order as mono-carboxyl proteolysis of Ang I, Ang 1-9, and Ang II, respectively (Fig. 1j) , indicating that the conversion of Ang I to Ang 1-7 by B38-CAP is mediated through three steps of monocarboxyl proteolysis. Therefore, B38-CAP has an ACE2-like activity, which converts both Ang II and Ang I peptides to Ang 1-7 in vitro.
