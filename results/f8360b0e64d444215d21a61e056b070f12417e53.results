After combing the two line lists, a total of 100 pediatric cases were identified. Pediatric cases represented 3.0% of Sun et al. 5 China, Japan has the most pediatric cases included in this analysis (n=15), accounting for 34.1% of all international cases. In total, cases from 14 countries were included ( Table 1 ). The median age of patients was 10 [IQR: [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] years. The distribution of patients by age is presented in Figure 1 . No significant differences in age were detected between cases inside and outside China (10 [IQR: [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] inside vs. 9 [IQR: 5-15.5] outside; p=0.91). For 13 patients (15.9%), only an age range was available. To include these patients in further analyses, cases were split into two age groups based on how data was reported in the line lists. There were 53 children (65.6%) between 0-12 years and 27 adolescents (32.9%) between 13-19 years, with 2 missing age range data (2.4%). Males accounted for 52.4% of included cases, females accounted for 32.9% and 14.6% were unknown ( Table 2 ). When broken down by age range, no significant differences were observed between the proportion of cases between age groups (p=1.0), with a male skew of cases seen within both ( Table 2) . When compared by location, males accounted for 52.6% of cases within China and 57.3% outside China (p=0.22). A timeline of cases and cumulative cases is presented in Figure 2 by age range and Figure 3 by location. In both children and adolescents, weekly cases peaked between January 20-26, 2020. The number of reported cases continued to drop reaching a low in mid-February, then undergoing a rapid increase sustained through to the end of the study period, driven by new international cases. Within China, the number of weekly cases steadily decreased from the beginning of the study, with no new cases added to the databases since February 3-9, 2020. The number of cumulative international cases has been constantly increasing over the study period with a more rapid increase in recent weeks. .

No significant differences in this delay time was observed for subgroups of age (p=0. 29) or location (inside/outside China) (p=0.67). The median delay between the onset of symptoms and first visit to hospital/clinic was 1 [IQR: 0-3.3] day (n=20). There was no significant difference with respect to age subgroup (p=0.93). However, within China this delay was significantly shorter with a median duration of 1 day [IQR: A total of 29 (35.4%) patients were noted to have an infected family member. In one adolescent case in Japan, the patient was the son of a physician who had earlier tested positive for the virus. Data on patient symptomatology was available in 25 (30.5%) of the cases. Fever was the most common symptom, present in 17 (68.0%) of those cases, while 2 (8.0%) cases were asymptomatic. Cough was reported in 9 (36.0%) cases. A breakdown of patient symptoms is presented in Table   3 . Data on disease severity, need for hospitalization or intensive care support, and patient outcome was not available for analysis.
