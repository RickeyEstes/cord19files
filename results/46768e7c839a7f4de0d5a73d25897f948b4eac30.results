From July 1 to August 31, 2015, 143 cases of MERS-CoV were reported by the MoH (Figure 1 ). The median age of cases was 58 (range 2, 99) years, 91 (64%) were male, and 124 (87%) were of Saudi nationality. The case fatality rate was 43%. Comorbid medical conditions were documented for 88 (62%) cases, with diabetes (n = 63; 44%) and hypertension (n = 57; 40%) most common. Cases were reported from 7 regions of SA, with Riyadh region accounting for 131 (92%) cases (Supplementary  Table) . One hundred twelve cases (78%) were classified as secondary and linked to the Hospital A outbreak, including 75 cases reported from Hospital A and 37 cases with links to Hospital A as patients, healthcare personnel, visitors, or contacts of a Hospital A patient (Table 1 ). In addition, 2 initial cases were reported from Hospital A in July (before secondary transmission at Hospital A was recognized): 1 was classified as sporadic and 1 as unknown. Twenty-nine (20%) of 143 cases were not linked to Hospital A, and, of these, 17 (59%) were secondary cases, including 5 (17%) healthcare personnel, 10 (34%) with healthcare contact during the exposure period, and 2 (7%) close contacts of MERS cases. Limited transmission was documented at 3 healthcare facilities in addition to Hospital A during August. Eight (6%) of 143 cases were classified as sporadic after telephone interview. Sporadic cases ranged in age from 35 to 91 years, 7 of 8 were male, and residence was reported from 6 regions: 3 from Riyadh and 1 each from Makkah, Eastern, Qasim, Asir, and Najran (Supplementary Table) . Six (4%) of 143 cases were labeled unknown, including 3 not reachable by telephone and 3 whose exposures remained unknown after proxy interviews. Genome sequencing was performed on specimens from 6 MERS cases with dates of illness onset ranging from June 27 to August 19, 2015 ( Figure 1A ). All 6 cases were either from Riyadh or had traveled to Riyadh within the exposure period. Four of the 6 cases were exposed to Hospital A as patients or visitors. Phylogenetic and recombinational analysis revealed that all 6 viruses were members of a recently described novel recombinant clade (NRC-2015). Sequences from cases linked to Hospital A were genetically similar ( Figure 1B) and distinct from 2 cases not linked to Hospital A. Of cases not linked to Hospital A, one had visited a relative (not a MERS case) in a Riyadh hospital where limited transmission had occurred, but the patient denied contact with a known MERS-CoV case. The other case was an 83-year-old man who resided in Jeddah, but he had visited Riyadh during the exposure period and had healthcare contact in both Riyadh (not Hospital A) and Jeddah for a chronic illness. The MERS-CoV sequence from this patient possessed a unique 20-nucleotide frameshift deletion spanning positions 387/388 to 407/408 of the nonstructural protein gene ORF5. Whereas native ORF5 is predicted to encode a 224-amino acid (aa) protein, the deletion would predict a 147-aa truncated protein consisting of the amino-terminal 129 aa of ORF5 plus 18 non-ORF5 residues prematurely terminating in an out-of-frame stop codon. This sequence clustered most closely with MERS-CoV sequences derived from 3 camels in April 2015 from Taif, SA, that lacked the deletion [4] (Figure 1B) . No definitive link to camels was identified for this patient; however, the patient was deceased and the interview was conducted with a relative.
