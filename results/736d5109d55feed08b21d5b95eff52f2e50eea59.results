Evaluating the effects of the expression of IFITMs on the production of virion particles derived from a broad panel of viruses To assess the degree of conservation of the IFITM-mediated negative imprinting on the virion particles infectivity, we examined a panel of fourteen viruses spanning families distinct in terms of genome, replication, interaction with their cellular host and more interestingly, presenting different modes of virion assembly (as schematically presented in Fig 1A) . This list included several members of the Retroviridae family and in particular MLV (genus Gammaretrovirus), MPMV (genus Betaretrovirus) as well as SIV MAC and HIV-1 (genus Lentivirus, the latter of which we had previously characterized with respect to its susceptibility to IFITMs, [18] ); the plus-strand RNA Flaviviridae WNV (genus Flavivirus) and HCV (genus Hepacivirus); representative members of different minus-strand RNA virus families such as Rhabdoviridae (VSV), Paramyxoviridae (MeV); Filoviridae (EBOV), as well as segmented RNA viruses belonging to Bunyaviridae (DUGV of the genus Nairovirus and RVFV, of the genus Phlebovirus) and Arenaviridae (MOPV). To complete this analysis, two DNA viruses respectively members of the Herpesviridae (EBV) and Parvoviridae families (AAV) were also included here. Contrarily to all the viruses examined in this study, AAV is a non-enveloped virus. To minimize the inevitable variations dictated by the specificities of each one of these viruses (cellular tropism, availability of cloned genomes, of viral-coded reporters and so forth), we decided to use an as much as possible homogenous setup to assess the ability of IFITM1, 2 or 3 to interfere with the production of infectious virions (as schematically presented in Fig 1B  and as more specifically detailed in Supplementary S1 Fig) . IFITMs are expressed in virus-producing cells in conditions and amounts that are comparable to those that can be measured in primary monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) stimulated with type I IFN (Supplementary S2A, S2B, S2C and S2D Fig) and that we had previously employed to reveal this novel antiviral mechanism in the context of HIV-1 [18] . Due to cell type specific transfection rates, the intracellular levels of IFITMs measured upon transient DNA transfection varied among cell lines, although variations were contained within four-fold in terms of both number of IFITM-positive cells and median fluorescent intensity (MFI, as measured by flow cytometry, Supplementary S2A and S2B Fig) . When cloned viral genomes that allow efficient viral rescue upon DNA transfection were available, virion particles were produced by simple co-transfection of viral components along with DNA coding IFITMs (as for HIV-1, SIV MAC , MLV, MPMV, WNV and AAV). Otherwise, cells transfected with the individual IFITMs were infected shortly after transfection to obtain a consistent pool of virus-producing IFITMs-expressing cells. Then, viral particles newly-produced in cell free supernatants were isolated and purified by ultracentrifugation through a 25% sucrose cushion (w/v) and then normalized for protein or genome content (Supplemental S1 Fig) . Normalized amounts of virion particles produced in the presence or absence of IFITMs were then analyzed by WB or used to challenge target cells to measure their infectivity and possible effects of IFITMs on this parameter (Supplementary S1, S3A and S3B Figs for a comprehensive comparison of the infectious titers used). Few modifications were used to adapt to specific virus features. Hone cells that bear a latent EBV genome carrying gfp were transfected with IFITMs coding DNA along with an expression vector coding the EB1 viral transcription factor to stimulate viral reactivation and virion assembly [49, 50] . Given its assembly in the nucleus, AAV virions were purified from cell lysates using a well-established procedure that includes freeze-thaw cycles and virion purification on a 4 step gradient of iodixanol [51] . For HCV, IFITMs were expressed in hepatocytic Huh-7.5.1c2 cells [52] and to circumvent the poor transfection rate of these cells, expression of IFITMs was obtained by retroviral-mediated transduction. Finally, while parental viruses were examined in most cases, vectors were used for retroviruses. This allowed us to pseudotype retroviral particles with the same heterologous envelope (the VSV G protein, VSVg) to better appreciate potentially subtler differences due to distinct virion assembly mode existing between Retroviridae. VSV-G pseudotyping is commonly used in studies on retroviruses and we had previously determined that IFITMs exert similar defects on the infectivity of HIV-1 viral particles bearing the HIV-1, the VSV-G, the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) or the feline leukemia virus RD114 envelope proteins [18] . When the conditions described above were used, the presence of IFITMs in virus-producing cells did not appreciably modify the amount of virion particles produced, although a trend toward increased viral production was observed for AAV, EBV and MOPV in the presence of IFITM3 and a negative one was observed for HIV-1, MLV and HCV (Supplementary S3C Fig) . To focus only on their intrinsic infectivity, all the subsequent assays were performed for each virus after normalization of virion particles produced in the presence or absence of IFITMs. Next, the ability of IFITMs to be incorporated (or to co-fractionate) in normalized viral preparations was assessed by Western blot (Fig 2A) . In line with its non-enveloped characteristics, viral preparations of AAV were devoid of IFITMs even when four times more starting material than the one used for the other viruses was used (Fig 2A) . On the contrary, readily detectable amounts of IFITM1, 2 and 3 were observed in viral fractions of all enveloped viruses tested, under the experimental conditions used here. The unique exception was represented by DUGV in which IFITM1 was undetectable in viral preparations, contrarily to IFITM2 and IFITM3 and despite comparable intracellular expression levels. These results are not due to lower viral inputs, because similar amounts of physical DUGV particles were analyzed than other viruses (as for example MOPV and RVFV, Supplementary S3A and S3B Fig) . Overall, the data presented here on fourteen different viruses indicates that IFITMs co-fractionate with most enveloped virion particles in a robust manner. IFITMs associate to viral particles of most, albeit not all, viruses tested and do not induce detectable changes in mature glycoproteins incorporation. A) Virion particles produced in presence or absence of IFITMs and their corresponding cellular lysates were analyzed by WB. Virions were harvested from the cell supernatant and purified by ultracentrifugation through sucrose, with the exception of AAV for which cells were first lysed by freeze/thaw and then virions were purified by ultracentrifugation on a four-step iodixanol gradient. Load.; loading controls using either anti-actin, -tubulin or -EF1Î± antibodies. Virus-specific antibodies were used according to their availability. In the case of MPMV for which antibodies were not available, CA was identified by comparison with control supernatants and quantified after Coomassie staining and densitometry. The panels display representative results of 3 to 5 independent experiments. B) When available, the same viral preparations displayed in A were probed with antibodies specific to the indicated mature glycoproteins. The panels present representative results. The intracellular processing pathways of the viral glycoproteins analyzed is shown schematically at the right. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1006610.g002 A direct interaction between the HIV-1 Env and IFITMs has been hypothesized to drive functional alterations of the amount of Envelope spikes present in virion particles [22] , although this finding has not been confirmed by other studies, including our own [18, 23, 53] . Given these discrepancies, it was important to determine whether IFITMs could modify or not the extent of mature glycoproteins incorporation in the case of other viruses. To this end, we examined the extent of mature glycoproteins incorporation in virion particles derived from viruses for which antibodies were available (Fig 2B) . No specific defect in mature glycoproteins incorporation into virions was observed in the presence of IFITMs, irrespectively of the glycoprotein intracellular processing/maturation pathway (schematically displayed at the right of the panels of Fig 2B) , refuting the hypothesis of a generalized mechanism through which IFITMs may interact and/or modify viral glycoproteins maturation and incorporation into virions. Two further considerations can also be drawn from the comparison of the migration patterns observed for the different IFITMs after SDS-PAGE gel analysis. First, the IFITM1, 2 and 3 proteins in Huh-7.5.1c2 cells (HCV panels) migrate at distinct apparent molecular weights, contrarily to the IFITMs expressed in the other cell types. The reasons for these differences are unclear although both patterns are equally present in the literature and both have been indistinctly linked to an antiviral phenotype [6, 8, 18, 19, 25, 45, 54] . Second, slower migrating forms of IFITMs, especially of IFITM2, can be in some cases observed in cellular and viral fractions. These bands have been observed before, but at present their identity is unknown, although we speculate they may represent post translational modifications of IFITMs. The finding that such forms appear more concentrated in viral preparations of some viruses may suggest their selective enrichment at the sites of virion assembly, an hypothesis that will require further studies.
