Two hundred and thirteen respiratory samples were tested by the 4 different assays with only 10 respiratory viral pathogen targets common to all assays; targets that were unique to a single assay were not analysed further. Although samples were not sequential, the pattern of viral pathogens detected still represented the local epidemiology with influenza A, RSV and picornavirus being the most common ( Table 2 ). The predominant influenza A virus strain detected was A(H1N1)pdm 2009. Only 4 isolates were identified as the A(H1N1) seasonal strain circulating up to mid-2009, and one was A(H3N2). The majority of picornaviruses detected were rhinoviruses; the FTD assay was the only assay to differentiate rhinovirus within the picornavirus family. Analysis of the internal control results, for each assay revealed no PCR inhibition in the FTD, IH PCR or EP assays., However inhibition was detected in 11 samples by MS2 PCR in the xTAG RVP assay. Of these 11 inhibited samples, 5 were sputum and 4 had a pathogen detected which indicates issues with the sample matrix and the MS2 PCR. Statistical analysis using analytical (percentage) agreement between the 4 different assays showed high agreement rates with a range from 93.0 to 100% agreement. The Kappa values ranged from 0 for bocavirus (FTD vs Easyplex) to 1.00 for influenza A virus (IH vs EP), see Table 3 for results. All influenza viruses detected were influenza A. Results for parainfluenza viruses 1-3 were pooled (no parainfluenza type 4 was detected), as were the results for the 3 strains of coronavirus detected.
