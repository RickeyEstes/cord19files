We first investigate the impact of social distancing interventions alone. The received wisdom of outbreak control strategies is that the maximum level of control measures should be put in place as rapidly as possible. However, there may be delays before control strategies are implemented due to difficulties in identifying the early stages of a novel outbreak, as well as other logistical, political and economic constraints. Because the interventions considered here are sub-optimal, cases will continue to occur whilst the intervention is in place, but at a slower rate than in the unconstrained epidemic. This means controls may need to be held in place for a long time, which may be costly. Detailed derivations of the analytical results are given in a Text S1.
