RESTV NP-and GP 1,2 -specific antibodies, neutralizing antibody responses, and the viral antigens in the cynomolgus macaque sera from the 1996 RESTV epizootic Twenty-seven serum samples derived from cynomolgus macaques that were either found already dead or had been euthanized at the facility were available. The presence of RESTV NP antigens was evaluated by antigen-capture ELISA [15] or immunohistochemistry [3] , while that of anti-RESTV NP IgG was evaluated using IgG ELISA and IFA methods [6] [7] [8] In order to examine whether the sera contained anti-GP 1,2 antibodies, we employed a GP 1,2 -specific ELISA and IFA [16] . RESTV GP 1,2 Î”TM prepared by a baculovirus expression system and RESTV GP 1,2 -expressing HeLa cells were used as antigens for GP 1,2 -specific ELISA and IFA, respectively. Anti-RESTV GP 1,2 IgG were detected in 10 (#2180, 2181, 2189, 2190, 2191, 2195, 2404, 2693, 2696 and 2713) out of the 27 serum samples according to ELISA (37%), whereas the remaining 17 samples (63%) showed negative reactions. Nine serum samples positive for GP 1,2 antibodies in the IgG-ELISA also showed positive reactions in the IFA, while one serum sample (#2194) was only positive in the IFA. Serum samples showing positive reactions in either the GP 1,2 -specific IgG-ELISA or IFA were considered to be anti-GP 1,2 positive (11/27, 41%, Table 1 ). Interestingly, the sera derived from cynomolgus macaques in the acute viremic phase did not contain any detectable anti-GP 1,2 IgG, although they often contained anti-NP IgG. We next attempted to detect the neutralization (NT) antibody response in the sera of RESTV-infected cynomolgus macaques. The VSV pseudotype RESTV GP 1,2 (VSV-RESTV-GP 1,2 /GFP) was used for the NT assay [17] . Twelve serum samples (12/27, 44%) neutralized the VSV-RESTV-GP 1,2 /GFP infection, with NT titers ranging from 80 and 640 (#2721, 2972, 2180, 2181, 2189, 2190, 2191, 2195, 2404, 2693, 2696 and 2713) ( Table 1 ). The anti-GP 1,2 IgG were not detectable in #2721 and #2972 by IgG ELISA, while those samples both had a neutralizing activity. These two specimens showed a positive response for viral antigen in the Ag-capture ELISA and were thus considered to be collected in an early seroconversion phase. All cynomolgus macaques at the facility were euthanatized regardless of clinical status and there was a possibility that some of the cynomolgus macaques had combined infection with simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) in the animal facility [18] . Therefore, immune responses against RESTV did not always reflect the clinical manifestation. For these reasons, we defined "convalescent" or "non-convalescent" based only upon serological findings. It is noteworthy that, among the serum samples that were positive for viral antigen and negative for the NT antibody (Ag +, NT -), all nine serum samples were negative for anti-GP 1,2 antibodies, whereas only two samples were negative for anti-NP antibodies. On the other hand, all of the ten serum samples that were negative for viral antigen and positive for the NT antibody (Ag -, NT +) were positive for both anti-GP 1,2 and anti-NP antibodies. This finding indicates that the anti-GP 1,2 antibody may therefore increase in cynomolgus macaques in the convalescent phase, while anti-GP 1,2 antibody is rarely detectable in the acute viremic phase of infection.
