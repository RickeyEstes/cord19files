There were 268 farms included in this study; the majority of participating farms were located in the swine dense regions of Minnesota and Iowa. Fig 1 shows Table 1 . Fig 2 depicts the prevalence, upper and lower 95% confidence intervals of farms containing animals actively shedding PRRS virus over the weeks examined in this study. There was a difference in the nature of PRRS seasonality among states. A fall/ winter seasonal pattern was only detected for farms located in the states of Minnesota, North Carolina and Nebraska. For the other two states (Iowa and Illinois), two seasonal peaks were detected within a year: one every 6 months (biannual). Figs 3 and 4 shows the fit and diagnostics for all final models, and covariate estimates, standard errors and AIC values are provided on Table 2 . All models appeared to fit well considering the graphs and all p-values from the Box-Pierce test were p > 0.05.
