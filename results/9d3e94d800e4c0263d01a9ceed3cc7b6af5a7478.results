To analyze the patterns of transmission of the EVD infection after a community member in a latent stage has been arrived, stochastic simulation results were obtained by 2,000 trials. In the analysis of simulation results, the total number of patients is the sum of and from the mathematical model. Figure 2 depicts the changes of numbers of patients as the result from 2,000 trials in SI; more specifically, the number of patients of the 5 randomly selected results, mean of total number of patients from the entire simulation, and the upper bound of 95% confidence interval (CI) of patient number (a percentile of 97.5% of all 2,000 trials), are represented in gray curved lines, red solid lines, and red dashed lines, respectively. The results demonstrated that there can be at the most 3.5 patients within the 95% CI after 25 days the first imported case of a patient, and that the number of patients remains less than 1 on average. Figure 3 shows the distribution of each simulation result as a box plot, regarding the predicted number of patients and epidemic duration that points to the recovery of the last patients. Table 3 lists the results for each EVD response scenario; total number of patients for C group and HCW group; median and maximum, and minimum values of the CI; maximum number of new cases per day; epidemic duration; and the probability of estimated total cases having greater than or equal to 10, 20, and 30 patients, which is calculated by the ratios of number of trials with those patients numbers, as well as the basic reproductive number before the intervention. In SI, the median for the total predicted number of patients was calculated as 2 and the maximum number as 11. The probability of having more than or equal to 10 patients was 4.1%, and median epidemic duration was approximately 44 days. It is of interest to note that the results are similar to that of EVD cases in the USA [13] [14] [15] . In SII with 3-day of diagnosis delay, a total of 5 cases (2 in C and 3 in HCW) are predicted to occur. The maximum number of new patients in a day is predicted to be 2 at day 23 from the first domestic imported case, and the epidemic duration is estimated to be approximately 2 months (58 days). If there is a 6-day of diagnosis delay, a total of 7 patients are expected, and the duration of epidemics would extend to 69 days. In SIII with 1 case missing, the median number of infected patients becomes 8 (3 in C and 5 in HCW). At the most 3 new patients would be observed per day in the day 24 after the first EVD patient arrives, and the epidemic duration is expected approximately 77 days. Impact of 1 case missing is equal nearly an 8-day diagnosis delay in SII, within around 88 days of epidemic, the median number of infected cases would involve 15 patients (5 in C and 10 in HCW), and it is predicted that at day 24, at the most 5 patients would appear per day. When there are 2 case missing, there is a 75.7% chance that more than 10 new cases would occur.
