The volume of airline travelers from 17 SEA countries into China nearly quadrupled from 3.6 million in 2005 to 13.8 million in 2015, with the most (69.3% of all 73.9 million passengers) departing from Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia (Fig A in S1 Appendix) . Nine SEA countries with available monthly dengue incidence data for risk analysis had a total of 63. Seasonal patterns of dengue transmission in nine countries were also seen with annual amplitude positively correlated to the latitude of each country. Furthermore, there was a significant synchrony between dengue incidence in SEA and importation to China, and the seasonal epidemics in China were also highly coherent with dengue transmission in SEA and importation into China (Fig 2 and Figs D-F in S1 Appendix). The monthly DENV importation risk from nine countries of SEA into a province of China have increased from a median of 0.18 (IQR 0.03-0.57) in 2005 to 0.98 (0.72-1.0) in 2015 (Fig  3, panel A) . Both Chinese travelers and SEA residents contributed to increasing risk over that decade, but Chinese travelers (median 0.26, IQR 0.03-0.88) were more likely to introduce dengue into China than SEA residents (0.14, 0.02-0.56), particularly since 2011 (Figs G-I in S1 Appendix). Across all years, the lowest risk (median 0.22, IQR 0.03-0.82) was in March, and the highest (0.65, 0.12-1.0) was in August when 23 cities (13.9% of 165 cities) had an average risk greater than 0.5 between 2005 and 2015 (Fig 3, panel B and Figs J and K in S1 Appendix). The percentage of cities with a median importation risk higher than 0.5 increased from 4.8% (8/165) in 2005 to 21.8% (36/165) in 2015 with most emerging destinations in central and western China (Fig 4) , and cities with a median probability of risk greater than 0.5 due to Chinese travelers increased from 7 to 35, versus 5 to 18 for SEA residents (Fig L in S1 Appendix) . Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore were consistently amongst the locations with the highest risk for DENV importation into China; while Sri Lanka and Maldives were emerging as important origins due to the increasing travel, particularly in Chinese (Fig 5 and Seasonal risk of dengue importation from South-East Asia into China A total of 11,901 infections (95% UI 6923-16,917) via air travel was estimated to import from nine SEA countries into China between 2005 and 2015, which was 13.5 times (7.8-19.2) of the 879 imported cases reported in dengue surveillance system of China. The estimates had positive correlations with the reported numbers by month and country, and by nationality (Fig 6 and Figs O and P in S1 Appendix). Furthermore, the estimated time series with a onemonth lag could significantly predict the numbers of cases reported in surveillance (F = 203.7, p<0.001) (Fig Q in S1 Appendix) . The probability of DENV introduced local transmission from nine SEA countries into China also rose, with a median risk increasing from 0.10 (IQR 0.01-0.30) in August 2005 to 0.56 (IQR 0.21-0.91) in August 2015 at provincial level (Fig 3, panel C) . Significant seasonal variation was evident, with high risk during the warm months between May-October, but very low risk in other months (Fig 3, panel D) . Compared to cities with intensive importation in cold regions of northern China, e.g. Beijing and Shenyang, the introduced risks in the lower latitude cities, e.g. Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Haikou, were much higher and extended over longer time periods (Fig 4 and Fig K in S1 Appendix) . The countrywide change in the probability of introduced transmission between 2005 and 2015 led to a much larger population being at risk: Guangzhou, Shanghai and Xiamen with 32 million people were the only three cities with a risk greater than 0.5 in August 2005, while there are 102 million people in 10 cities (Guangzhou, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, Haikou, Nanning, Wuhan, Changsha and Chongqing) with the same risk in August 2015 (Fig R in S1 Appendix) . The dynamics of dengue in SEA, the volume, demography and immunity level of airline travelers, and the environmental suitability of DENV local transmission in China have been changing the high-risk routes for importation and introduced transmission (Figs S and T in S1 Appendix). For instance, the Maldives-Guangzhou, Philippines-Fuzhou and Malaysia-Hangzhou routes have had increasing risks since 2005, and cities in central China and middle coastal regions, e.g. Hangzhou, Chengdu and Wuhan, are emerging as destinations with an increasing risk of introduced transmission. Additionally, compared to the monthly occurrence of cases reported at the provincial level in China, the ROC curves showed our model performed robustly with an AUC of 0.86 for importation risk estimates and 0.92 for introduced transmission estimates (Fig U in S1 Appendix) . Moreover, the importation risk estimates for SEA residents had a slight better performance than for Chinese travelers (AUC 0.91 vs 0.86).
