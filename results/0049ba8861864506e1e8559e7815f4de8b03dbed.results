Expression of scFv in the lipid raft of plasma membrane through a GPI anchor To generate GPI-anchored and secretory scFvs, the sequences encoding scFvs derived from seven different human antibodies AB31, AB32, TG15, 4E10, 48d, X5 and AB65 were genetically linked with the sequence encoding a his-tagged IgG3 hinge region and with or without the sequence encoding a GPI attachment signal of DAF [37] . The fusion genes scFv/IgG3 hinge/his-tag/ DAF and scFv/IgG3 hinge/his-tag were inserted into a third generation lentiviral vector pRRL ( Figure 1A ). The recombinant viruses were then generated as described before [38] and used to transduce TZM.bl cells and human CD4 + T cells CEMss and CEMss-CCR5 (see below). The expression of transgenes and localization of transgene products in the transduced cells were carefully studied. Figure 1B shows the expression of scFvs/hinge/his-tag/ DAF and scFvs/hinge/his-tag in cell lysates and culture supernatants of transduced TZM.bl cells by western blot using anti-his-tag and anti-tubulin antibodies. As expected, without a GPI attachment signal, all scFvs were detected in both culture supernatants and cell lysates with a majority in supernatants (the right panel). By contrast, all scFvs with a GPI attachment signal were only detected in cell lysates, but not in culture supernatants (the left panel). These data indicate that inclusion of a GPI attachment signal prevents secretion of the scFvs. To determine if scFvs/hinge/his-tag/DAF were expressed on the cell surface through a GPI anchor, scFv/hinge/his-tag/DAF-transduced TZM.bl cells were treated with or without phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and stained with anti-his-tag antibody followed by FACS analysis. As a control, cells transduced with previously reported m-scFv (TG15), a cell-surface expressed scFv (TG15) with a conventional transmembrane domain [23] went through the same PI-PLC treatment and staining processes. Figure 1C shows that all scFv/hinge/his-tag/DAFs express highly on cell surface (about 10-fold higher than that of m-scFv) and the expression were substantially reduced with PI-PLC treatment. In contrast, no reduction in cell surface expression of scFv was observed in m-scFv-transduced cells, indicating that the expression of scFv/hinge/histag/DAF on the cell surface is indeed through a GPI anchor. In addition, cell surface expression of GPIanchored scFv (4E10) along with GPI-anchored scFvs (AB65 and X5) was also analyzed by immune staining and FACS analysis. Additional File 1 shows that cell surface expression of GPI-anchored scFv (4E10) is similar to those GPI-anchored scFvs (AB65 and X5). Thus, for the sake of simplicity in the remaining text we will refer the scFv/hinge/his-tag/DAF as GPI-scFv and scFv/hinge/ his-tag as secretory scFv. To determine if GPI-scFvs are located in the lipid rafts of plasma membranes, mock-and GPI-scFv (AB65 and X5)-transduced TZM.bl cells were seeded into wells of cover slip chambers and cultured overnight. Cells were then fixed with 4% formaldehyde and co-stained with 1) mouse anti-his-tag antibody followed by Alexa 488conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody; 2) Alexa 555conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (CtxB); and 3) DAPI. CtxB interacts with GM1 (a lipid raft marker) on the cell surface. Figure 2 shows that both GPI-scFvs (AB65 and X5) are co-localized with GM1 on cell surface, implying that they are located in the lipid raft of the plasma membrane. GPI-scFv (X5) exhibits remarkable degree of breadth and potency against HIV-1 Next, we compared CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 expression in the secretory and GPI-scFv-transduced TZM.bl cells and found that there is no significant difference in their expression compared to mock-transduced TZM.bl cells, suggesting that the expression of transgenes does not alter the expression of the receptor and the coreceptors for HIV-1 in the transduced cells (Additional File 2). Neither did we find that the expression of the transgenes alters the cell growth (Zhou et al. data not shown). To test neutralization activity of the secretory versus the GPI-scFvs against HIV-1, an eleven multiclade HIV-1 pseudotype panel and a retroviral envelope 10A1 pseudotype were used to infect transduced TZM.bl cells in a single-round infection experiment [23] . The retroviral envelope 10A1 recognizes either Ram-1 or Glvr-1 as a receptor for cell entry [39] and used here as negative control. The eleven HIV-1 pseudotypes consist of HIV-1 envelopes derived from clade A (Q168), clade B (HxBc2, JF-RL, ADA, AD8, Yu2 and consensus B), clade B' (CNE11), clade C (Mj4 and CNE17) and clade E (CNE8). Figure 3 shows mean and standard deviation of relative luciferase activity (RLA) in mock-, secretory and GPI-scFv-transduced cells infected with these pseudotypes. Compared to mock-transduced cells, cells transduced with all secretory and GPI-anchored scFvs did not show significant neutralization activity against 10A1 pseudotypes control ( Figure 3A and 3B). Compared to mock-transduced cells, cells transduced with secretory scFvs (AB65, AB31, AB32, TG15, and 48d) did not show significant neutralization activity against any of these HIV-1 pseudotypes tested. Cells transduced with secretory scFv (X5) showed low degree of neutralization activity against 3 of 11 HIV-1 pseudotypes (ADA, Consensus B and Mj4). In contrast, cells transduced with secretory scFv (4E10) exhibited more than 50% neutralization activity against all 11 HIV-1 pseudotypes tested ( Figure 3B ). Compared to mock-transduced cells, cells Figure 1 Expression of secretory and GPI-anchored scFvs in transduced TZM.bl cells. A.

Wen et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:79 http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/79 transduced with GPI-scFvs show various degree of potency and breadth against HIV-1 pseudotypes ( Figure  3A ). Like cells transduced with GPI-scFvs (AB65) control, cells transduced with GPI-scFvs (AB31) did not show neutralization breadth and potency against any of these pseudotypes tested. Cells transduced with GPI-scFv (AB32) neutralized 2 of 11 HIV-1 pseudotypes (JR-FL and Consensus B) with low degree of potency. Cells transduced with GPI-scFv (TG15) neutralized 8 of 11 HIV-1 pseudoviruses expressing envelopes derived from clades A, B and B' with various degree of potency, but not clades C and E. Cells transduced with GPI-scFv (4E10) neutralized all 11 HIV-1 pseudotypes with increased potency (more than 90% neutralization activity) as compared to cells transduced with secretory scFv (4E10). Cells transduced with GPI-scFvs (48d) neutralized all 11 HIV-1 pseudotypes with great degree of potency against HIV-1 pseudotypes expressing envelopes derived from clades A, B, B' and E, but less potent against envelope derived from clade C. Strikingly, cells transduced with GPI-scFv (X5) neutralized all 11 HIV-1 pseudotypes with remarkable degree of potency. We next tested neutralization activity of the secretory versus the GPI-scFvs against 6 replication competent HIV-1 strains including two clinical isolates (quasispecies). Figure 3C and 3D show mean and standard deviation of RLA in mock-, secretory and GPI-scFv-transduced cells infected with these HIV-1 strains. Compared to mock-transduced cells, cells transduced with all secretory scFvs did not show significant neutralization activity against any of these HIV-1 strains tested ( Figure 3D ). In contrast, cells transduced with the GPI-scFvs show various degree of breadth and potency ( Figure 3C ). Like cells transduced with GPI-scFv (AB65) control, cells transduced with GPI-scFv (AB31) did not neutralize any of these HIV-1 strains tested. Cells transduced with GPI-scFv (AB32 and TG15) It was previously showed that the scFv (X5) neutralizes HIV-1 better than the Fab and the whole IgG [40] and the binding and neutralizing capability of scFv (X5) can be greatly enhanced by adding soluble extracellular domains of human CD4 (sCD4) [21, 41, 42] . We therefore produced and purified soluble CD4 using the drosophila S2 expression system (see Additional File 3). We then tested the effect of sCD4 doses on HIV-1 infection (Bru-3, Bru-Yu2 and Mj4) and found that at 1 μg/ml or higher a concentration-dependent inhibition of HIV-1 infection by sCD4 was observed; while below 1 μg/ml no significant inhibition by sCD4 was observed (Zhou et al. data not shown). Thus, we chose sCD4 at the concentration of 0.3 μg/ml in the subsequent post-CD4 experiments as described before [43] . Figure 4 shows mean and standard deviation of RLA in mock-, secretory and GPI-scFv-transduced TZM.bl cells infected with or without HIV-1 Bru-3 or Bru-Yu2 that were pre-incubated with or without sCD4. Preincubation of 400 and 4,000 TCID 50 of these two HIV-1 strains with sCD4 greatly enhances inhibition in cells transduced with secretory scFv (X5); while complete inhibition was observed in GPI-scFv (X5)-transduced cells infected with 400 and 4,000 TCID 50 of these two HIV-1 strains, regardless whether the viruses were preincubated with sCD4 or not ( Figure 4A -D). Thus, these results clearly show that while sCD4 enhances inhibition by secretory scFv (X5); GPI-scFv (X5) exhibits the greatest potency of inhibition, which is totally independent of addition of sCD4. GPI-scFv (X5) confers long-term resistance to HIV-1 in human CD4 + T cells Next, we evaluated if GPI-scFv (X5) would confer the long-term resistance to HIV-1 in human CD4 + T cells. Human CD4 + cell line CEMss was first transfected with a retroviral vector expressing human CCR5. After stable CEMss-CCR5 cells were established, they were further transduced with secretory and GPI-scFv (X5 and AB65). The expression of secretory and GPI-scFvs as well as CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 in transduced CEMss-CCR5 cells were tested by western blot and immune staining followed by FACS analysis as described above (see Additional File 4). Transduced CEMss-CCR5 cells were then infected with HIV-1 strains Bru-3 and Bru-Yu2 at multiple of infection of 0.01 as described before [23] and cultured in the complete DMEM medium for 75 to 105 days, except for cells transduced with secretory scFvs (AB65 and X5) and infected with Bru-3 (the culture of these cells was terminated on day 27 post infection). As shown in Figure 5A and 5B, replication of both HIV-1 Bru-3 and Bru-Yu2 was completely inhibited in cells transduced with GPI-scFv (X5) throughout the experiments. In contrast, robust replication of HIV-1 Bru-3 and Bru-Yu2 was observed in cells transduced with secretory scFv (AB65) and GPI-scFv (AB65) controls. For cells transduced with secretory scFv (X5) and infected with HIV-1 Bru-3, HIV-1 replication was as robust as secretory scFv (AB65) and GPI-scFv (AB65) controls. By contrast, for cells transduced with secretory scFv (X5) and infected with HIV-1 Bru-Yu2, robust HIV-1 replication was observed in the first 6 days and then slowly dropped to the undetectable level on day 51 and thereafter. These data demonstrated that GPI-scFv (X5) completely inhibits the infection of HIV-1 Bru-3 and Bru-Yu2. By so doing it maintains long-term resistance to HIV-1. On the contrary, secretory scFv (X5) cannot inhibit the infection and replication of fast replicating HIV-1 like Bru-3, but can partially inhibits the replication of relatively slow replicating HIV-1 like Bru-Yu2.
