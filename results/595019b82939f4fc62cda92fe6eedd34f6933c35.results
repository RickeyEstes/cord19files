Lung cancer cases and healthy subjects enrolled in the present study numbered 43 and 21, respectively. Demographic and clinical data of study subjects are summarized in Table 1 . We were able to detect a fungal colonization by Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus ochraceus and Penicillium ssp in the EBC. 12 (27.9%) of NSCLC patients, and 0 (0%) controls turned out to be fungi colonized in the EBC: 5 by Aspergillus niger (11.6%), 3 by Aspergillus ochraceus (6%), 4 by Penicillum spp. (9.3%). Fungi positivity in the EBC was always confirmed in paired bronchial brushing. The EBC was found to have a similar sensibility compared to the bronchial brushing for fungi detection. When analyzing lung cancer patients no difference was found according to sex, age, histotype, stage, smoking habit, pack years, time since quitting smoking in subjects with fungal colonization (p > 0.05).
