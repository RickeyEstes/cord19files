Antiviral activity of amodiaquine and artesunate and their metabolites in cell culture. The antimalarial treatment ASAQ that was administered to EVD patients in 2014, is a coformulation of artesunate (AS) and amodiaquine (AQ). AS and AQ are rapidly metabolized in the liver to dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and desethylamodiaquine (DEAQ), respectively. Prior to in vivo evaluation, the drug ASAQ, its components, and the metabolites were characterized for their inhibitory effects on EBOV (Makona variant, EBOV/Mak) replication in cell culture ( Table 1 ). The data confirm previous reports that both AQ and the metabolite DEAQ block EBOV replication with similar activity (IC 50 = 2.8 to 3.2 µM) in Huh 7 and Vero E6 cell lines (IC 50 = 9.5 to 11 µM). In primary human macrophages, both AQ and DEAQ exhibited elevated cytotoxicity, which precluded any interpretation of antiviral activity. In contrast, activity of AS and its metabolite DHA was weak or undetectable. Combinatorial testing of AQ and AS or the metabolites, DEAQ and DHA, did not reveal in vitro synergistic effects against EBOV replication (data not shown). Based on the in vitro data, the decision was made to evaluate AQ in the NHP model of EBOV infection.
