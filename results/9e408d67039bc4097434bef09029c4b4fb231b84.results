The screening results of SOM and FCM are shown as a threedimensional scatter plot in Fig. 4(a) . The 83 subjects were divided into three groups: 17 were placed in the HR-I group, indicated by red spheres and cone dots bounded by red ellipses; 26 were placed in the LR-I group indicated by the blue sphere dots bounded by blue ellipses; and 40 were included in the Non-I group indicate by the green sphere dots bounded by green ellipses. The screening results are summarized in Fig. 4(b) . The 43/83 subjects were classified into the influenza group including 34 influenza patients (HR-I and LR-I) and 9 misclassified normal control subjects; 40/ 83 subjects were classified into the Non-I group including 39 normal control subjects and one misclassified influenza patient. The corresponding sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 97.1%, 81.3%, 79.1%, and 97.5%, respectively. The SpO 2 value was used as a reference to determine the stage of influenza infection. With an SpO 2 cut-off value of 96%, the HR-I group and the LR-I group were compared. The details are summarized in Table 1 . Ten out of the 17 HR-I group cases exhibited an SpO 2 of less than 96%, whereas only two out of the 26 LR-I group cases exhibited an SpO 2 of less than 96%. The chi-squared test revealed significant differences between the HR-I group and the LR-I group (c 2 Z 13.36; degree of freedom Z 1; p < 0.001). In the Non-I group, there were no subjects with an SpO 2 of less than 96%, which indicates that no higher-risk influenza patients were misclassified as normal. To investigate the clustering tendency, the vital-signs data and reference data are shown in part in Table 2 . The 17 influenza patients classified into the HR-I group all have an SpO 2 level of less than 96%, or have notably increased vital signs. Moreover, the vital-sign values and SpO 2 were compared for the Non-I, the LR-I, and the HR-I groups. Fig. 5a shows that the average heart rate differed significantly among the three groups (Non-I Z 68 bpm, LR-I Z 84 bpm, HR-I Z 98 bpm; p < 0.05). Fig. 5b shows that a significant difference was identified between the Non-I and the LR-I groups (p < 0.05), but there is no significant difference between the LR-I and the HR-I groups in terms of respiration Figure 3 Schematic representation of the SOM combined with fuzzy clustering algorithm to create a non-linear discriminant function for distinguishing the HR-I and LR-I groups from the Non-I group. rate (Non-I Z 16 bpm, LR-I Z 19 bpm, HR-I Z 20 bpm). Fig. 5c shows that a significant difference was found between the Non-I and the LR-I groups (p < 0.05), but there is no significant difference between the LR-I and the HR-I groups in terms of facial temperature (Non-I Z 35.7 C, LR-I Z 36.3 C, HR-I Z 37.0 C). For the reference SpO 2 data (Fig. 5d) , there was a significant difference among the three groups (Non-I Z 97%, LR-I Z 96%, HR-I Z 95%; p < 0.05).
