During the study period, there were 3027 positive tests for influenza A, with a mean weekly count Correlations between weekly influenza counts and later bacterial counts were generally high, as expected (results not shown), but the corresponding IRR adjusted for short work weeks, long-term and seasonal trends, in Table 1 , show much weaker associations. Only two IRR, between influenza B and subsequent S. pyogenes infections, approach significance. The full model for influenza B and S. pyogenes, in Table 2 , shows several effects, all adjusted for each other. (i) Short work weeks are associated with a 27% decrease [(1)0.7337)*100] in S. pyogenes notifications. (ii) The large coefficient for sine1 reflects the yearly notification peaks, but there is also a weaker six-monthly (cosine2) and twomonthly (cosine6) periodicity. (iii) All the long-term-trend terms are highly significant. (iv) Influenza B counts for a given week (week 0) are associated with increases in S. pyogenes notifications in the same week and in the following one (weeks 0 and +1), of about 3.8% [(1.0376)1)*100] and 3.5% [(1.0354)1)*100] per additional positive influenza B test, respectively. They are also associated, although not statistically significantly, with decreases in S. pyogenes notifications in weeks +2 to +5. These two phenomena together are suggestive of 'harvesting' 31, 32 : at least some of the S. pyogenes infections following influenza B would have occurred even without influenza, but a few weeks later, having merely been brought forward in time by influenza B. However, a model containing influenza B counts for all 6 weeks does not show a better fit than one containing only the counts for weeks 0 and )1 (deviance = 6.96, P = 0.1381), indicating that this apparent 'harvesting' of cases may well be in fact random variations in the parameters. (Note that the N. meningitidis terms marked c and d in Table 1 , although large and almost significant, are in the wrong sequence for harvesting, which is why they are not reported as a finding.) The comparison of observed and expected S. pyogenes counts before and after influenza counts are added to the model (Figures 4 and 5) shows a visible improvement in fit. A comparison of the two dark lines shows that, with influenza B in the model, four transient increases in S. pyogenes infections are now modelled that were not before: those in 1997, 2001, 2007 and especially 2008. Looking back at the time series of influenza B counts (dark line in Figure 1 ), one notes that these were years with late, high peaks in the weekly numbers of influenza B-positive tests. An additional indication that this association may be causal is that the average age of known influenza B cases in these 4 years is significantly higher, 33.9 years, than in other years, 24.6 years (P < 0.000), and closer to the average ages of S. pyogenes cases, 45.9 years. Comparisons of the closeness-of-fit of various nested models quantify rigorously the relative contributions of long-term trends, seasonal trends and influenza (Table 3) . All infections except those caused by N. meningitidis display significant long-term trends (model 1), and both streptococcal infections also show significant seasonality (model 2). These findings confirm what has been observed in Figure 3 . When long-term trends but not seasonality are controlled for (models 3 and 4), influenza A and B counts significantly improve the model fit for both streptococcal infections, but the improvement is greater for S. pneumoniae than for S. pyogenes. When seasonality is also controlled for by dedicated terms, however, the only effect remaining is that of influenza B counts on S. pyogenes counts, as mentioned earlier (models 5 and 6). This effect Table 1 . Incidence rate ratios (IRR) between each of the bacterial infection counts for a given week (week 0) and the influenza A and B counts for weeks 0 to )5.
