The frequencies of CR1 genotypes in the five populations were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05). The allele and genotype frequencies of the CR1 SNPs rs17259045, rs17047660 (McC a/b ), rs17047661 (Sl1/Sl2) and rs6691117 (KCAM+/-) differed significantly among the groups (p 0.01) ( Table 1 ). Genotype frequencies of the CR1 variants rs41274768 (Kn a/b ) and rs4844609 (Sl4/Sl5) did not differ. The rs17259045AG genotype and the rs17259045G allele were more frequent in the Brazilian population. Moreover, the G carriers (AG and GG) and the G allele of variants rs17047660 (McC a/b ), rs17047661 (Sl1/Sl2) and rs6691117 (KCAM+/-) were observed more commonly among the two African populations (Republic of Congo, Ghana). Interestingly, among Congolese and Ghanaian individuals the minor allele of SNPs rs17259045A/G, rs41274768G/A (Kn a/b ) and rs4844609T/A (Sl4/Sl5) did not occur at all; this allele was observed exclusively in Brazilian individuals. Except for rs6691117 (KCAM+/-), the Vietnamese population was monomorphic. The Indian group was monomorphic for three of the SNPs, but not for rs17259045, rs41274768 (Kn a/b ) and rs6691117 (KCAM+/-). Brazilian individuals were polymorphic for all SNPs ( Table 1 ). The Knops blood antigen distribution among the studied populations is summarized in Table 2 . Haplotypes were reconstructed from the six CR1 variants. A total of nine haplotypes were observed. The haplotype distributions are summarized in Table 3 and Fig 1. The CR1 Ã AGAATA haplotype was more frequent among the Brazilian and Vietnamese populations; CR1 Ã AGAATG occurred frequently among the Indian and Vietnamese groups, while CR1 Ã AGAGTG was observed frequently among Congolese and Ghanaian individuals. The CR1 Ã AGGGTG and CR1 Ã AGAGTG haplotypes were observed only in Brazil and Africa, being far more frequent among the Congolese and Ghanaian groups. Interestingly, CR1 Ã GGAATA was exclusively observed in the Brazilian population. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis between SNPs revealed medium levels of LD for SNPs rs17047661 (Sl1/Sl2) and rs6691117 (KCAM+/-) and for rs17047660 (McC a/b ) and rs17047661 (Sl1/Sl2) in the Congolese and Ghanaian study groups (Fig 2) .
