The total number of samples tested for the presence of FeLV antigen between 1996 and 2011 decreased gradually ( Figure 1 ). Over the 16 year period, 4465 samples were analysed. The age distribution of cats sampled in 1996 and of the pooled analysis from 2008 to 2011 was comparable, with the largest proportion (>36%) of all cats aged <1 year (Table 1) . No age was given for >50% of cats included in the 2008 group. The sex distribution of cats analysed in 1996 and in 2008-2011 was evenly distributed. Owing to a lack of data for the 2008 population, >25% of animals in the pooled analysis were classed as sex unknown. The prevalence of FeLV antigenaemic cats between 1996 and 2011 is shown in Table 2 . The OR was calculated for each year (1997-2011) compared with the baseline year of 1996. The OR for the pooled analysis group (2008-2011) compared with 1996 was 0.78, meaning that cats tested between 2008 and 2011 were less likely to test positive for the presence of FeLV antigen than those tested in 1996. Data from 1996 and from 2008-2011 were entered into a 2 × 2 contingency table and analysed using the χ 2 test (Table 3 ). The χ 2 value (with Yates correction) equals 1.135 with 1 degree of freedom. The prevalence of FeLV antigenaemic animals in 1996 was 7.4% compared with 5.9% in 2008-2011. The difference between the year groups is therefore 1.5% (95% CI -1.3 to 4.3) and is not statistically significant at the 5% level (P = 0.3036). The age distribution of FeLV antigenaemic animals is shown in Figure 2 . In 2011, 80% of FeLV-positive cats were aged >1-5 years, whereas in 2008-2010, the majority (>72%) of FeLV-positive cats were 0-1 years of age. Using the χ 2 test, age data from FeLV antigenaemic cats were analysed as shown in Table 4 . The difference between year groups with respect to age is not statistically significant at the 5% level. However, as the χ 2 value is relatively high, there is a low probability that the differences between FeLV-positive cats aged ⩽5 years or >5 years occurred by chance alone. No correlation could be made between sex and FeLV antigenaemia. The χ 2 value (with Yates correction) equals 0.451 with 1 degree of freedom (P = 0.5416).
