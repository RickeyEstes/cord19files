In the period observed 10,030 cases that could be considered to be imported infectious diseases were identified. These include various infectious diseases as listed in Table 2 with reported number of cases (imported, domestic, unknown and total), imported case rate among imported and domestic cases, incidence rate of domestic cases per year per 1,000,000 population and the incidence rate of imported cases per year per 1,000,000 outbound travelers. Shigellosis ranked as the most common imported infection, followed by amebiasis, malaria, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndromes (AIDS), typhoid fever, dengue fever, hepatitis A, giardiasis, cholera, and paratyphoid fever. The rate of imported diseases of malaria, dengue fever and rabies is complete as they are not endemic in Japan and over 50% in coccidioidomycosis, paratyphoid fever, typhoid fever, cholera, shigellosis and Echinococcosis (Echinococcus granulosus). Although coccidioides is not considered to be indigenous, a domestic case is identified with no history of overseas travel. However, this case was a dealer of imported cotton and he may have acquired the infection from fungi attached to the imported cotton. 6 The annual trends of imported diseases always fluctuate because of the local situation and sometimes there is sudden increase because of cluster among the same tour groups. The Amebiasis tended to increase recently both in domestic and imported cases. And cases acquired infection through sexual contact represented 50% of the total cases. 10 There were continuous reports of imported disease of AIDS, syphilis and hepatitis B. Dengue fever is increasing year by year, but malaria is decreasing gradually. Typhoid and paratyphoid fever and hepatitis A showed an increase and decrease throughout observation period. Although the outbreak among group tours to endemic countries was reported to account for the increase of imported diseases, 11 investigation of attributable events or causes were not always made in a timely manner. Retrospective investigation could recognize the increase of cases returning from certain countries, but it was difficult to seek further risk factors because limited information was listed on line.
