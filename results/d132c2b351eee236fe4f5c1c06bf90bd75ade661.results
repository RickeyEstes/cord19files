Clinical and laboratory characteristics of study participants From 178 HIV-1-positive infected individuals, 74 were identified as rapid progressors (as described in the 'Methods and materials' section), and the other 104 patients with no significant CD4 þ decline were grouped as nonprogressors. A significant difference in CD4 þ T-cell count between rapid progressors and nonprogressors was observed at seroconversion (384. 45 Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. The C allele at single-nucleotide polymorphism 12252 was associated with rapid progression Three hundred base pairs of the IFITM3 locus encompassing SNP rs12252 were sequenced in all acute HIV-1-infected patients and in the control group. Among them, 91.89% of rapid progressors carried CC/CT genotypes, a higher frequency than in HIV-1-negative individuals (79.08%, 155/196; P ¼ 0.01), whereas the genotype frequency of the nonprogressors was not significantly different from the HIV-1-negative group (P ¼ 0.721). The association of rs12252 with the progression of the infection was tested in other genetic models, as described previously [9] . A significantly higher frequency of the CC/CT genotypes was found in rapid progressors ( (Fig. 1b) . To identify whether there is a difference in disease progression in individuals with CD4 þ T-cell counts below 350, who are CC/CT genotypes carries versus the TT genotype carriers, a logrank (Mantel-Cox) test was performed. The result of this test verified that CC/CT genotype carriers are more likely to become rapid progressors (P ¼ 0.0068; Fig. 1c ). The effect of rs12252-C allele on rapid progression is independent of HIV-1 subtypes Four different HIV-1 subtypes were identified among 125 acute HIV-1-infected patients in this cohort, and their distribution was described: subtype B 34.4% (43/125), subtype BC 11.2% (14/125), subtype C 1.6% (2/125), and subtype AE 52.8% (66/125). We did not find any difference in the distribution of HIV-1 subtypes between rapid and nonprogressors (data not shown). However, a higher percentage of rapid progressors were CC/CT genotype carriers, regardless of the infecting HIV-1 subtype (data not shown).
