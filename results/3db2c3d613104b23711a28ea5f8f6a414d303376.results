A total of 358 children of 2-60 mo age and acute respiratory infections were screened and finally 300 patients were included after meeting the eligibility criteria. Following were the reasons for exclusion in 58 children: chest X-ray suggestive of bacterial pneumonia ( = 19), streptococcal sore throat ( = 15), underlying chronic conditions ( = 10), severe malnutrition ( = 7), illness lasting more than a week ( = 3), complicated pneumonia ( = 2), and being hospitalized in last one month ( = 2). The M : F ratio was 1.7 : 1 (URI = 1.6 : 1; LRI = 1.9 : 1). Out of 300, 174 (58%) were LRI and 126 (42%) were URI cases. Month-wise recruitment of URI and LRI cases has been shown in Figure 1 . Most URI cases occurred in the month of January and December. Most LRI cases occurred in the month of January, August, November, March, and July. Most children with LRI were in the age range of 2-12 mo (54%) and with URI were in the age range of >12-60 mo (45.2%). Auscultatory wheeze was present in 85% and crackles in 82% of LRI cases. Chest X-ray findings were hyperinflation (93%), peribronchial cuffing (60%), interstitial infiltrates (48%), and patchy opacity (46%). Of the 300 nasal and throat swabs, 248 cases were positive for viruses [LRI = 142/174 (81.6%), and URI = 106/126 (84.1%)]. Month-wise recruitment of ARI cases and samples positive for viruses has been shown in Figure 2 . The maximum number of cases recruited and samples positive for viruses were in the months of January, December, and August. The respiratory viruses found in URIs and LRIs are shown in samples were positive for single virus and 56 (39%) were positive for more than one virus. The coinfection pattern differed between acute URI and LRI, and this has been detailed in Table 2 . The most common viruses isolated from URI cases were RV (31.1%), ADV (18.9%), RSV (17%), and IFV (17%). The most common viruses isolated from LRI cases were RSV (30.3%), IFV (17.6%), RV (14.8%), and ADV (13.4%). RSV, ADV, RV, and IFV were the most prevalent viruses isolated from all the ARI cases. IFV-A was predominant over IFV-B, and PIV-3 was predominant over other subtypes of PIV. RSV-A subtype dominated over RSV-B in URI cases, whereas RSV-B dominated over RSV-A in LRI cases. PIV-2 and 4, hCoV, and EV were not detected in URI cases. The detection rates of viruses corresponding to different age groups are shown in Table 1 . In case of URIs, RV was the most prevalent virus (2-6 mo age = 2.8%; >6-12 mo age = 13.3%; >12-60 mo age = 14.2%). RSV was the second most common virus detected in age groups of 2-6 mo and >6-12 mo. ADV was the second most common virus detected in age group of >12-60 mo. hMPV and hBoV were not detected up to 12 mo age. The least common viruses in all age groups were PIV, hBoV, and hMPV. hCoV and EV were not detected in any age group. In case of LRIs, RSV was the most prevalent virus (2-6 mo age = 13.4%; >6-12 mo age = 11.3%; >12-60 mo age = 5.6%). IFV was the second most common virus detected in all age groups. hMPV, hBoV, and hCoV were not detected up to 6 mo age. EV was not detected up to 12 mo age. The least common viruses in all age groups were hBoV, hCoV, EV, and hMPV. The distribution of viruses by month has been shown in Figure 3 . There was difference between URIs and LRIs. RV was the most common virus detected in URIs, but it was fourth most prevalent in LRIs. It was detected throughout the year, the maximum rate being in December, January, March, and August. RSV was the most common virus detected in LRIs, but it was third most prevalent in URIs. It was detected throughout the year, the maximum rate being in December, January, and February. IFV was second most common virus detected in LRIs, but it was third most prevalent in URIs; maximum positivity rate was in August followed by in July, and minimum positivity rate was in November. The trend for PIV differed from that of IFV. PIV had a higher prevalence in April to July, and a low prevalence from September to March. EV and hCoV 43 were not detected in URIs. There detection rate was lower in LRIs. Like hMPV, hBoV was present throughout the year in LRIs. The clinical features, demographics, and risk factors of children among viral positive and virus negative group with LRIs were compared (Table 3 ). It was observed that significantly higher number of children below 12 mo were virus positive ( = 0.01). Children presenting with preceding bronchiolitis were significantly associated with total viral infections ( = 0.003). Rhinorrhea was significantly present in the virus positive group ( = 0.02). Among risk factors, ARI in family was significantly associated with virus positivity ( = 0.04). In LRIs, out of 174 cases (LRI = 101; severe LRI = 51; very severe LRI = 22), 161 were cured and 13 died. Of 13 cases who died, 10 had coinfection with more than 1 respiratory virus (IFV + RSV = 5; RSV + RV = 3; IFV + hCoV43 + RV = 2). In URIs, all were cured.
