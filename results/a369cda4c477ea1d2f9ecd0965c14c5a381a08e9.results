To investigate the impact of epidemic severity on network immunization algorithms, we simulate the SIR model at various infection rates. Then, we measure the average number of infected individuals over 50 SIR trials on networks for deterministic immunization algorithms. For stochastic algorithms (SHCI and RI), we consider 50 SIR trials on five different immunized networks. Note that only simulations with a significant final epidemic size (i.e. least 2% of the population) are included in the calculation of the average (Salathé and Jones, 2010) . As shown in Figs. 1-3 , the variance of epidemic size is mostly less than 1% in each networkimmunization-disease interaction. The maximum variance is 6%, which occurs in the case of high infection rate in small-world network (see Fig. 3(f) ). We plot the average fraction of infected individuals with α = 0.2, S, versus vaccination coverage, q, in Fig. 1 . The performance results vary according to the network topology. Betweenness immunization exhibits the best performance in the Erdös-Renyi network, while, Effective degree immunization (EDI) and degree immunization (DI) are the most effective ones in scale-free networks. However, degree-based immunization algorithms are generally more effective than other algorithms, and are therefore among top-3 algorithms in all networks. On the other hand, other algorithms such as SHCI, which ignore network degree, fail to stop spreading of this type of epidemic. The result highlights the importance of network average degree in the suppression of low infection rate epidemics. The above conclusion is also confirmed by similar trends of algorithms in controlling weak epidemics and lowering the average degree (see Figs. 1 and A.1) . Another surprising result of a weak epidemic simulation (i.e. α = 0.2) is that it dies out in small-world networks (see Fig. 1 (f)) although its basic reproduction number is greater than one (i.e. R 0 > 1). The result can be explained through special characteristic of small-world networks (i.e. high modularity and clustering coefficient) where R 0 cannot solely determine epidemic dynamics (Saramäki and Kaski, 2005) . In other words, an epidemic with a low infection rate is commonly confined in the local community of the primary infectious individual (Badham and Stocker, 2010; Saramäki and Kaski, 2005) . Finally, it should be noted that all immunization algorithms obviously outperform random immunization in AS and scale-free networks with a low-power degree distribution. For instance, Effective-Degree immunization is up to 68% more effective than random immunization in AS network. We run SIR simulation at infection rate α = 0.5 as a representative of moderate epidemics. As depicted in Fig. 2 , Eigenvector immunization (EI) offers the worst immunization algorithm in all networks with a performance 60% worse than that of random immunization in Small-World network when immunization coverage is equal to 20%. Unlike the low-infection rate epidemics, their moderate counterparts are widely propagated through non-immunized small-world network (see Fig. 2 (f)) such that the whole population becomes infected. However, the majority of immunization algorithms can suppress epidemics by immunizing only 5% of the population. Betweenness immunization is still the most effective approach in the Erdös-Renyi network outperforming the next best algorithm (i.e. SHCI) by up to 11%. Comparing the performance of SHCI in the cases of low and medium infection rates indicates that it is more effective in suppressing the moderate one. For instance, Effective degree immunization (EDI) is highly superior to this scheme in the control of weak epidemics in scale-free network (Fig. 1(e) ), while, SHCI exhibits a similar performance concerning medium infection rate (Fig. 2(e) ). This increasing in relative performance of (a) HEP network. represents the average of maximally 50 simulation runs for targeted immunization algorithms and 50 runs on 5 different immunized networks for SHCI and random immunizations, (note that only simulations with a final size of at least 2% of the population were included in the calculation of averages). Fraction of infected individuals is measured considering the whole population (i.e. including immunized and non-immunized nodes). SHCI must rely on the fact that as infection rate increases, the contagion is more likely to infect all reachable nodes in the component of initial seed. Therefore, the number of infected individuals becomes equal to the size of the largest connected component of the network when the most severe epidemic occurs. Fig. 3 depicts the results of SIR simulations of high infection rate epidemics (α = 0.8). Our experimental results confirm the hypothesis of superiority of SHCI in the prevention and mitigation of severe epidemics in comparison to other algorithms. SHCI outperforms all strategies over all networks except Erdös-Renyi network where it is up to 14% less effective than betweenness immunization ( Fig. 3(d) ). SHCI algorithm displays a maximal improvement of 8% in Facebook-like and AS network, 4% in Small-world network, 40% in HEP, and 22% in Scale-Free, compared to the next best algorithm. The desired performance of SHCI justifies the claim that the size of the largest connected component of network is the most important factor in spreading of severe epidemics. This assumption is confirmed by trends of other algorithms. For instance, PageRank immunization offers the second best performance in modular and homogeneous networks such as Small-World since it is highly efficient in fragmenting small-world networks into small components by immunization of nodes connecting different clusters (Fig. A.2) . Moreover, Degree-based immunization algorithms are quite optimum over heterogeneous networks such as Scale-Free and AS networks, as it easily breaks them down via hub immunization.
