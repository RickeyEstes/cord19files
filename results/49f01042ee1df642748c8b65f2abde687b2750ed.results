In untreated AR mice, sneezing and thin nasal discharge was accompanied by excessive scratching. In glycyrrhizin-treated groups (20 and 30 mg/kg BW), abnormal symptoms were not found. However, in AR mice treated with glycyrrhizin (10 mg/kg BW), sneezing and thin nasal discharge was accompanied by slightly scratching. In the lycopene-treated group, sneezing and thin nasal discharge was accompanied by slightly scratching. During the experiment, there was no serious or purulent nasal discharge at all. None of experimental animals developed secondary infections or were treated by additional drugs, such as antibiotics. In the medicine-treated groups, two mice died. As can be seen in Table 1 , body weights were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the untreated AR mice than the normal control mice (P < 0.01). Mice having received an oral administration of lycopene and glycyrrhizin had lower body weight than that of the untreated AR mice. However, a statistical difference was not found. In addition, mice having received an oral administration of lycopene (20 mg kg −1 BW) had slightly (P > 0.01) lower body weight than that of mice receiving an equivalent dose of glycyrrhizin. As can be seen from Table 2 , OVA specific IgE levels were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in untreated AR mice than normal control mice (P < 0.01). Oral administration of glycyrrhizin significantly and in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05; P < 0.01) reduced OVA specific IgE levels in untreated AR mice compared to normal control mice. Oral administration of lycopene slightly (P > 0.05) reduced OVA specific IgE levels in untreated AR mice compared to normal control. As can be seen from Table 3 , while blood and nasal mucosa MDA contents were significantly higher in untreated AR mice than normal control mice (P < 0.01), they decreased significantly (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) in medicine-treated (lycopene and glycyrrhizin) groups when compared to untreated AR mice (P < 0.01). Mice having received an oral administration of lycopene (20 mg kg −1 BW) had markedly (P < 0.01) lower concentrations of MDA than that of mice receiving an equivalent dose of glycyrrhizin. Table 4 shows the blood and nasal mucosa GSH levels at the end of the experiment. After 12 days of treatment, the GSH concentrations of untreated AR mice showed a significant (P < 0.01) decrease compared with the normal control mice. However, an increase of GSH concentration of mice in the medicine-treated (lycopene and glycyrrhizin) groups was observed (P < 0.01). There was a dose-dependent relationship between GSH concentration and glycyrrhizin consumption. Mice having received an oral administration of lycopene (20 mg kg −1 BW) had higher concentrations of GSH than that of mice receiving an equivalent dose of glycyrrhizin. The SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and TAOC activities significantly (P < 0.01) decreased in blood and nasal mucosa of untreated AR mice compared to normal control mice. The decreases were significantly restored (P < 0.01) in the mice supplemented with lycopene and glycyrrhizin (Tables 5 and 6 ). There was a dose-dependent relationship between antioxidant enzymes' activities and glycyrrhizin consumption. Mice having received an oral administration of lycopene (20 mg kg −1 BW) had higher antioxidant enzyme activities than that of mice receiving an equivalent dose of glycyrrhizin. Table 7 shows the nasal mucosa IFN-γ, IL-4 levels and IFN-γ/IL-4 at the end of the experiment. After 12 days of treatment, the IFN-γ, IL-4 concentrations of untreated AR mice showed a significant (P < 0.01) decrease and increase compared with the normal control mice. Subsequently, IFN-γ/IL-4 markedly decreased. However, lycopene and glycyrrhizin administration significantly (P < 0.01) increased nasal mucosa IFN-γ and reduced IL-4 concentration of mice in the medicine-treated (lycopene and glycyrrhizin) groups. Subsequently, IFN-γ/IL-4 markedly increased. There was a dosedependent relationship between IFN-γ, IL-4 levels and glycyrrhizin consumption. Mice having received an oral administration of lycopene (20 mg kg −1 BW) had lower IFN-γ and higher IL-4 levels than those of mice receiving an equivalent dose of glycyrrhizin.
