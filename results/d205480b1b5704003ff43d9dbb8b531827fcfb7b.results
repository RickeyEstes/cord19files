A total of 56 case farms had reported 137 confirmed BNP cases. 23 farmers reported only one case calf, the remaining farmers reported up to 9 affected calves on their farm. Half the farmers had detected their affected calves on the basis of haemorrhages, while the calves in the other half of the case farms were affected by other diseases prior to the bleeding disorder. None of the farmers reported any unusual treatments in the dams of the affected calves during pregnancy. Univariable analysis using the set of randomly selected control farms identified a number of variables that were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the occurrence of BNP, either as risk or as protective factors (Table 2) . Of the 56 case farms, 55 vaccinated against BVD, and all of them were using PregSure ® BVD vaccine, whereas 16 of the 50 control farms vaccinated against BVD, of which two used PregSure ® BVD vaccine; one farmer did not recall the name of the vaccine that had been used. Linseed meal, which was fed to cows by 10 of 56 case farms, but by none of the control farms, was also a highly associated risk factor. Univariable analysis using the matched controls, comparing the case farms with controls of matched veterinary practices, bivariate conditional logistic regression models did not converge for the use of PregSure ® BVD vaccine and many other variables, due to the non-existence of matched factor occurrences. Of the 45 matched case control pairs, 32 were discordant in that the case farm used PregSure ® BVD vaccine, but the control did not; in 12 pairs both, case and control farm used this vaccine; and in one pair, neither case nor control farms used this vaccine. However, there were no pairs where the control farm used PregSure ® BVD vaccine, but the case farm did not. Therefore, a non-conditional univariable analysis was used for the comparison between case and control farms of the second set (Table 2 ). In total, 17 of the 50 control farms in the second set of controls vaccinated against BVD, of which 13 used PregSure ® BVD vaccine, which led to an odds ratio of 156.5 (95% CI: 19.6-1248.3) for the use of PregSure ® BVD vaccine. There were no significant differences between case and control farms in other factors known to lead to haemorrhagic diathesis, such as access to bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), sweet clover (Melilotus spp.) or horsetail (Equisetum spp.), investigated in the questionnaire (Table 1) . The results of the multivariable logistic regression models are listed in Table 3 for both sets of comparisons. In the first comparison linseed meal and purchase of cattle were excluded from the multivariable logistic regression, due to their rare occurrence (<10%). Also the variables breed, feeding of hay to cows and feeding of grass silage to cows were excluded, as they occurred in both cases and controls in very high frequencies (Table 2) . Only the use of PregSure ® BVD vaccine remained as significant risk factor in the model. The analysis of correlations between this factor and all other factors not included in the model revealed several significant high correlations (Chi-squared test p < 0.001). In a logistic regression model without the factor PregSure ® BVD vaccine five factors remained in the model (Table 3) . Two-way interactions were not significant. Two factors were positively associated with the BNP-status of the farm: respiratory health problems in calves and the use of dam vaccination against calf diarrhoea, while three factors were negatively associated with the BNP-status of the farm: the feeding of barley to cows, the use of teat dips and the use of stem growth regulators. These variables were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios for the factor PregSure ® BVD vaccine and the presence of BNP on the farm. The resulting odds ratios for PregSure ® BVD vaccine ranged between 528 (adjusted for respiratory health problems) and 714 (adjusted for dam vaccination), while the crude odds ratio for PregSure ® BVD vaccine was at 1292. The results of the multivariable logistic regression model for the comparison with the second set of controls are given in Table 3 . Variables excluded from the stepwise logistic regression due to their rare occurrence (<10%) were: purchase of cattle, a frequent problem of inappetence in calves, the use of oral vaccination or colostrum replacers in calves and the use of calcium boli in cows. Other factors that were present in most case and control farms, such as the feeding of whole milk or hay to calves, feeding of hay or maize silage to cows, were also excluded from the analysis. Five variables remained in the final non-conditional logistic regression model: positively associated factors were the use of other prophylactic measures in cows, such as parasite control (OR = 14.3; 95% CI: 1.4-151.9) and the use of PregSure ® BVD vaccine (OR = 426.0; 95% CI: 19.9-9095.4). Negatively associated with the occurrence of BNP were the use of vitamin E and selenium (OR = 0.113; 95% CI: 0.014-0.905) the frequent use of mastitis tubes (OR = 0.032; 95% CI: 0.002-0.421) and the use of stem growth regulators (OR = 0.083; 95% CI: 0.015-0.448). No significant interactions were found. The results of the non-conditional logistic regression model using all significant variables of Table 3 -except for PregSure ® BVD vaccine -and of a conditional regression model using the same variables are compared in Table 4 . The obtained odds ratios and p-values differed only slightly.
