Based on the findings of the in-depth interviews, some changes to the preliminary model were identified. Two attributes (agency advertisement and sufficient brochures provided) could possibly be omitted from the model since they were not mentioned by any of the in-depth interview respondents. Two additional attributes (parking and travel reward programs) could be included in the model for further investigation in the second stage of the research as they were mentioned by more than 50% of respondents. These attributes highlighted in the in-depth interviews were then used in stage 2 of this research to determine their relative importance in the selection of a travel agency in a regional context. The second stage of the research achieved a response rate of approximately 54% with 217 responses received from a total of 400 surveys that were distributed. The respondents were predominantly more female (63.6%) than male (36.4%) with the majority of them married (64%) and reported as having no dependents (approximately 60%) in their household. The age groups and qualifications obtained in the responses were evenly spread across their respective categories, except for the under 24 years age group, where it registered only 10% of the responses. The annual household income groups were also relatively wide and evenly spread in the responses with only 3% of the sample indicating earnings of above $100,000. Table 1 provides a brief summary of the demographic profiles of the respondents. The survey investigated the 12 attributes -knowledgeable and experienced travel consultants, helpful and friendly staff, holiday/package price, quality of travel packages, travel agency reputation, variety of holiday/tour packages, additional services, convenient location, trading hours/days, agency layout and atmosphere, parking and travel reward programs -as identified in the in-depth interview stage. The findings indicated that knowledgeable and experienced travel consultants and travel reward programs as being the most and least important selection attributes respectively (refer to Table 2 for the frequency distribution of the selection attributes). The most influential attribute used in the selection of a travel agency was knowledgeable and experienced travel consultants, which was supported by majority of the respondents (213 respondents out of a possible of 217 which equates to approximately 98%). This attribute was seen as critical by these respondents (with a mean score of 4.52 out of a possible 5) as they believed that knowledgeable and experienced travel consultants could better assist them in making appropriate decisions on the travel itinerary and packages they sought. This could contribute positively towards their overall travel experiences and achieve postpurchase satisfaction, which could lead to subsequent repeat purchases (Kotler, 2003) . Travel reward program was identified as the least important attribute by the respondents (about 36%, with a mean score of 2.37 out of a possible 5) when selecting a travel agency in a regional context. These respondents suggested that this attribute was not the key driving force in determining their choice of travel agency, but rather as an insignificant associated incentive. Table 3 briefly illustrates the relative importance of the various attributes used to select a travel agency in a regional context. Generally, respondents were consistent in their responses to the importance of the different attributes when selecting their travel agency. However, findings show that there were notable significant differences between some selection attributes as indicated in Table 3 , column 3. Furthermore, there were also notable differences between gender group (such as helpful and friendly staff, travel agency reputation and additional services), age group (such as quality of travel packages, travel agency reputation, additional services, convenient location, agency layout and atmosphere and parking), and household income group (such as holiday/package price, quality of travel packages, travel agency reputation and additional services). Tables 4, 5 and 6 briefly illustrate the differences in these respective groups. The variation can be explained by respondents' level of travel experiences as a whole and also their attitudes towards travel agencies.
