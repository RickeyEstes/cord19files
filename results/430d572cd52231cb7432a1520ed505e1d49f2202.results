Based on cell culture results, 60 NPAs were found to be positive for hMPV whereas 16 were negative (10 of the latter were positive for another virus). In addition, 17 NPAs found to be positive for other respiratory viruses by multiplex RT-PCR assay only 10 were also included in the study. Thus, in total, 27 viruses were used for specificity analysis including 10 human respiratory syncytial viruses, 4 parainfluenza viruses (1 PIV-1, 1 PIV-2 and 2 PIV-3), 2 adenoviruses, 1 coronavirus (NL-63), 1 influenza A virus, 1 rhinovirus, 1 herpes simplex virus, 1 measles virus and 6 co-infections with viruses other than hMPV. Among the 60 NPAs that were positive for hMPV by cell culture, the hMPV EIA was positive in 43 (71.7%), negative in 12 (20%) and equivocal in 5 (8.3%). RT-PCR testing on discordant results revealed that all 5 EIA-equivocal as well as 10 of 12 EIA-negative NPAs were in fact true positive (Table 1) . On the other hand, hMPV EIA was negative in 32 (97%) of 33 hMPV-negative NPAs by cell culture or RT-PCR. One rhinovirus/enterovirus RT-PCR-positive sample was found to be equivocal by hMPV EIA and was confirmed as hMPV-negative by RT-PCR (Table 1) . The performance of the Biotrin hMPV EIA was established with respect to cell culture complemented by the use of RT-PCR for discordant results (Table 2 ). According to this gold standard and counting EIA equivocal/RT-PCR-positive results as true positive, hMPV EIA had a sensitivity of 82.8%, a specificity of 97.1%, a positive predictive value of 98% and a negative predictive value of 77.3%. Because of the unavailability of specimens for repeat testing, exclusion of samples with equivocal results would result in a more valid estimate of test performance. In that case, the hMPV EIA had a sensitivity of 81.1% (95% CI: 68.0-96.6%), a specificity of 100% Ten hMPV samples identified as positive by cell culture and RT-PCR were not detected by hMPV EIA. This discrepancy was probably not related to a lack of detection of a specific hMPV genotype since we identified both hMPV types (A and B) with the EIA (Table 1) . On the other hand, discrepant results correlated with viral load, and low viral load might limit detection by EIA. Thus, mean RT-PCR cycle threshold (C T ) values of 31.5, 34.7 and 39.1 were obtained for 5 selected EIA positive/RT-PCR positive samples, 5 EIA equivocal/RT-PCR positive samples and 10 EIA negative/RT-PCR positive samples, respectively (Table 1) . We cannot rule out possible viral degradation in the two samples that were originally cell-culture positive in 2002 and 2003, but found to be negative by both EIA and RT-PCR on subsequent testing several years later.
