A total of 4,326 women (and their newborns) were included in Georgia PRAMS during the 28-mo study period. Influenza vaccine information was available for 4,168 (96.3%) women in PRAMS (study population); of these, 578 women (14.9% [weighted]) had received the influenza vaccine during pregnancy. The vaccine coverage was 19.2% (weighted) among mothers of infants born during the putative influenza season. Out of the 122 wk of the study, at least local influenza activity was detected during 27 wk (22.1%)-including widespread activity in 8 wk ( Figure 1 ). There were 1,547 premature newborns (10.6% [weighted]) and 1,186 newborns with SGA (11.2% [weighted]) in our study population. The odds of having received influenza vaccine during pregnancy were lower (a) for black women than for all other ethnic groups (OR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.98), (b) for women with diabetes (OR = 0.30, 95% CI, 0.10-0.95), and (c) for mothers who used multivitamins in pregnancy (OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.50-0.83) ( Table 1) . Insured women were more likely to have received the influenza vaccine (OR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.09-1.81). Likelihood of having received an influenza vaccine during pregnancy was not associated with any of the other binary covariates (Table 1) . Similarly, gestational age at first prenatal visit was similar for vaccinated women and unvaccinated women (mean: 5.2 wk versus 5.3 wk; p = 0.23), and maternal weight before pregnancy was similar for vaccine recipients and non-recipients (mean: 68.3 kg versus 68.1 kg; p = 0.88). Based on the approach of identifying covariates that produce adjusted ORs of 1 during the pre-influenza period, the group of covariates in the prematurity multivariate models included gestational age for first antenatal visit, maternal diabetes (gestational and/or non-gestational), multivitamin use in pregnancy, history of alcohol use during pregnancy, education less than 12th grade, and mother married. The covariates in the primary multivariate models for SGA included maternal age less than 19 y, maternal medical risk factors, labor/delivery complications, hypertension (treated or untreated), birth defects, and history of alcohol use during pregnancy. In unadjusted models, and in models with covariates based on lack of effects in the pre-influenza season, infants born during the putative influenza season (1 October-31 May) and whose mothers were vaccinated against influenza during pregnancy were less likely to be premature than infants of unvaccinated mothers born in the same period (adjusted OR = 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38-0.94). The magnitude of effect of maternal influenza vaccine on prematurity increased during the period when there was at least local influenza activity in any part of the state (adjusted OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.73) and was the highest for those born during the period of widespread influenza activity (adjusted OR = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11-0.74) ( Table 2 ). The adjusted and unadjusted ORs were not significant for the association between receipt of maternal influenza vaccine and prematurity for the pre-influenza activity period or for the analysis without consideration of influenza activity ( Table 2) . Compared with newborns of unvaccinated women, those born to vaccinated mothers had lower odds of SGA (adjusted OR = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13-0.75) during the period of widespread influenza activity (Table 3) . Although the magnitude of the ORs of the association between maternal influenza vaccine and SGA generally increased with the increase in the intensity of influenza activity, these associations were not statistically significant (other than for the period of widespread activity) ( Table 3 ). The associations observed in the secondary multivariate models using the traditional approach were qualitatively similar to the associations in the primary multivariate models (Tables 2 and 3) . Newborns of vaccinated women were, on average, 96.7 g heavier than newborns of unvaccinated women (3,348 g versus 3,251 g; p = 0.002). During the putative influenza season, the difference between the two groups increased to 113 g (3,360 g for the vaccinated group versus 3,247 g for the unvaccinated group; p = 0.004). There were no significant differences in birth weights outside the putative influenza season (3,317 g [vaccinated] versus 3,255 g [unvaccinated]; p = 0.233). There was no statistical interaction by specific influenza season (i.e., 2004-2005 and 2005-2006) for all analyses of prematurity, SGA, and birth weight (for all interaction terms: p.0.05-detailed data available on request). Moreover, the association between maternal influenza vaccine and birth outcomes was qualitatively similar for the two influenza seasons. For example, during the period of widespread influenza activity, the adjusted ORs for prematurity were 0.17 (95% CI, 0.03-0.86) for the 2004-2005 season and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.10-1.14) for the 2005-2006 season. The fraction of prematurity prevented in the population during the study period (population prevented fraction of prematurity) was 0% for the pre-influenza activity period and 7.9% for the putative influenza season. The population prevented fraction increased during the periods of influenza activity (at least local activity, 15.7%; at least regional activity, 17.5%; widespread activity, 17.5%).
