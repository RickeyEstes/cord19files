HLA-B*46:01, HLA-B*15:01, and HLA-C*01:02 Have Distinctive Peptidomes To compare the peptides bound by HLA-B*46:01 and its parental allotypes, we isolated these HLA molecules, eluted the bound peptides, and determined their sequences by mass spectrometry. We identified 6,387 peptides for HLA-B*15:01, 788 for HLA-C*01:02, and 2,115 for HLA-B*46:01 ( Figure 1A ). This is consistent with previous reports showing that HLA-C peptide repertoires are generally smaller and less diverse than those of HLA-A and -B (Neisig et al., 1998; Rasmussen et al., 2014) . The intermediate size of the HLA-B*46:01 peptidome is consistent with its binding site being a hybrid of the parental allotypes. A majority (84.2%) of the peptides characterized is specific for one of the three HLAs, while only 15.8% bind to two of the three HLA class I molecules, and only one peptide, TSSYKPIV, binds all three ( Figure 1A ; Figure S1 ). Consistent with the similarity of their primary structures, the HLA-B*15:01 and HLA-B*46:01 peptidomes have the greatest overlap, with 333 shared peptides ( Figure 1B) . Although the sequences of the peptide-binding domains of HLA-B*15:01 and HLA-B*46:01 differ only by 3.8%, their peptidomes differ by >84%. Consistent with their gene-specific polymorphisms (Turner et al., 1998; , the peptide-binding domains of HLA-B*15:01 and HLA-C*01:02 differ by 14.4%, and these allotypes have only three peptides in common (Figure 1B) . The peptide-binding domains of HLA-C*01:02 and HLA-B*46:01 differ by 10.6%, and these allotypes have 19 common peptides. Thus, the gene conversion that created HLA-B*46:01 gave it a new and distinctive peptidome. The HLA-B*46:01 Peptidome Is Skewed toward Nonamer Peptides We identified differences in the lengths of peptides bound by each allotype ( Figure 1C ). HLA-B*15:01-binding peptides exhibit a wide range in length: a minority (44%) are nonamer peptides and $30% are longer than decamers ( Figure 1D ). With a majority (54%) of HLA-C*01:02-binding peptides being nonamers, their range is narrower than those of HLA-B*15:01 ( Figure 1D , upper panel). HLA-B*46:01-binding peptides have the narrowest range, with >80% of them being nonamers or decamers (Figure 1D, upper panel) . Among the 333 peptides shared by HLA-B*15:01 and B*46:01, $75% are nonamers ( Figure 1D , lower panel; Figure S1 ). Thus, the skewing of HLA-B*46:01 peptides for nonamers is more pronounced in peptides also bound by HLA-B*15:01. This contrasts with those shared with HLA-C*01:02, of which only 37% are nonamers ( Figure 1D , lower panel). Thus, HLA-B*46:01 has a peptide-binding site with stronger selectivity for nonamer peptides than either parent. HLA-B*46:01 Incorporates Elements from Both Parents in Its Peptide-Binding Motif We next identified the amino acid preference of each peptidome. Peptides bound by HLA-B*15:01 and HLA-B*46:01 usually have Tyr, Phe, Leu, or Met at P9, and they share a similar, though less conserved, preference for Lys or Ile at P3. These properties are consistent with HLA-B*15:01 and HLA-B*46:01 having sequence identity in the F and D pockets that bind P9 and P3, respectively ( Figure S1E ). By contrast, at P2, HLA-B*15:01 and HLA-B*46:01 have divergent preferences. Although both bind peptides with Leu at P2, Gln is abundant in HLA-B*15:01 peptides (26%) whereas Ala is most common in HLA-B*46:01 peptides (28%) (Figure 2A ). Like HLA-B*46:01, HLA-C*01:02 binds peptides with Ala and Leu at P2 (32% and 17%, respectively), as well as peptides with Ser at P2 (20%). Thus, all three allotypes commonly bind peptides with Leu at P2, the most common amino acid in peptides bound by HLA-B*15:01, but not in those bound by HLA-B*46:01 or HLA-C*01:02 where Ala predominates. These results correlate with the sequences at positions 66-70 of the B pocket, which are identical in HLA-C*01:02 and HLA-B*46:01, but not in HLA-B*15:01 ( Figure S1E ). HLA-B*46:01 and HLA-C*01:02 share a common motif (Glu, Ala, or Ser) at position 8. This is an unexpected finding as the HLA backbone places limited constraint on P8 (Boyington et al., 2000) . One possibility is that Val76, a residue shared by HLA-B*46:01 and HLA-C*01:02, mediates this effect. HLA-B*46:01 also acquired new properties in peptide selection. This is most evident at P1 where Phe and Tyr are common, but not in either parent ( Figure 2A ). The HLA*C*01:02 motif is different from the four broad motifs described for HLA-C (Rasmussen et al., 2014), in having Pro at P3 and Leu at P9 in >85% of its peptides. Subsets of HLA-B*46:01-Binding Peptides Resemble HLA-B*15:01-or HLA-C*01:02-Binding Peptides A covariation matrix was used to identify conserved pairs of amino acids in nonamer peptides bound by each allotype ( Figure 2B ). In the peptides bound by HLA-B*15:01 and HLA-B*46:01, pairs of residues at P2 and P9 are conserved. The most common motif observed in HLA-B*15:01 ($35%) and HLA-B*46:01 ($30%) peptides combines Leu at P2 with Tyr at P9. Both allotypes have a second, less common motif: Gln at P2 with Leu at P9 in HLA-B*15:01 and Ala at P2 with Leu at P9 in HLA-B*46:01 ( Figure S2 ). For HLA-C*01:02 peptides, pairs of residues at P2 and P3 and at P3 and P9 are conserved. These peptides combine Ala at P2 with Pro at P3 and Pro at P3 with Leu at P9 ( Figure S2C ). Reflecting its hybrid structure, HLA-B*46:01-and HLA-B*15:01-binding peptides share the Leu2/Tyr9 9 pair of residues, whereas the HLA-B*46:01-and HLA-C*01:02-binding peptides share the Ala2/Leu9 pair of residues. Covariation between pairs of amino acid residues in peptides bound by MHC has been previously observed (Birnbaum et al., 2014) , with structural analyses indicating it occurs due to alterations in the register of the peptide backbone, causing compensatory changes along the peptide-MHC interface (Chappell et al., 2015; Fremont et al., 1995; Koch et al., 2007) . Extending this analysis, we relaxed the requirement for conserved pairs of identical amino acids, and we compared the biochemical properties of each peptidome by principalcomponent analysis (PCA) ( Figure 2C ). The HLA-B*15:01 peptidome forms a single dominant cluster, contrasting with a small tight cluster formed by that of HLA-C*01:02. There is little spatial overlap between these peptidomes, indicating that they contain biochemically distinct peptides. The HLA-B*46:01 peptidome is more diffuse, resembling a fusion of the two parents. The larger cluster overlaps with that of HLA-B*15:01, the smaller one with HLA-C*01:02. These results are consistent with the covariation analysis ( Figure 2B ; Figure S2 ), and they show that HLA-B*46:01 presents two subsets of peptides that are biochemically similar, but not identical, to those of its parents. To determine if KIR2DL3 displays a preference for specific peptide combinations, we incubated KIR2DL3-coated beads with sHLA, isolated the bound peptides, and determined their sequences by mass spectrometry. We call these peptides KIR permissive, as they enable the HLA molecule to be recognized by KIR2DL3. No KIR-permissive peptides were isolated from HLA-B*15:01. By contrast, six KIR-permissive peptides were eluted from HLA-C*01:02 and 38 from HLA-B*46:01 ( Figure S3 ). These peptides comprise 7% and 21% of the total number of peptides identified for HLA-C*01:02 and HLA-B*46:01, respectively (Figure 3A) . For both allotypes, the proportion of nonamers was greater in KIR-permissive peptides ( Figure 3B ). That a higher proportion of HLA-B*46:01-binding peptides are KIR permissive is consistent with binding assays showing that HLA-B*46:01 has a higher affinity for KIR2DL3 than HLA-C*01:02 (Hilton et al., 2012 (Hilton et al., , 2015a (Hilton et al., , 2015b Moesta et al., 2008) . The sequences of the KIR-permissive and non-permissive nonamer peptides bound by HLA-B*46:01 were compared ( . Each logo consists of stacks of amino acid symbols, one stack for each position in the sequence. The total height of the column of amino acids represents the level of conservation at that position, and the residue height denotes its relative frequency. The colors of each amino acid correspond to their biochemical characteristics: acidic (red), basic (blue), hydrophobic (black), and polar (green). Sequence logos were generated using WebLogo (Crooks et al., 2004) . ( Figure 3D , lower panel). Here, KIR-permissive peptides are significantly more likely to have small, positively charged, and hydrophobic amino acids.
