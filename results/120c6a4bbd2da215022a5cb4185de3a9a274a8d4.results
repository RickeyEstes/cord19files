Serum chips revealed the contents of influenza virus, PIV, RSV, hMPV, BoV, and CoV in the serum microarray. The microhole distribution of each type of virus antibody is shown in Fig 1. Part of the microhole plate test results is shown in Fig 2, which indicated no cross-influence among the results. The ROC curves for patients with acute respiratory infection compared with patients without respiratory infection were plotted. The AUCs for protein chip detection were: influenza virus, 0.985 (95% CI, 0.97e1; P < .001); PIV, 0.984 (95% CI, 0.921e1.062; P < .001); RSV, 0.979 (95% CI, 0.961e0.997; P < .001); hMPV, 0.966 (95% CI, 0.942e0.990; P < .001); BoV, 0.974 (95% CI, 0.701e0.859; P < .001); and CoV, 0.996 (95% CI, 0.986e1.005; P < .001), respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy of acute respiratory virus were calculated according to the ROC and listed in Table 1 .
