ISG56/IFIT1 is primarily responsible for the IFN-induced alterations to the pattern of PIV5 protein synthesis We have shown previously that PKR, OAS and Mx are not the major IFN-inducible activities that limit PIV5 replication . To attempt to identify the IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) primarily responsible for the IFN-induced inhibition of PIV5, cells were transiently transfected with plasmids permitting the constitutive expression of IFIT3, IFN-induced protein 35 (IFI35), ISG15, ISG20, viperin or ISG56/IFIT1, and the cells were subsequently infected with a variant of PIV5, CPI2, that is unable to block IFN signalling (Chatziandreou et al., 2002a) . At 18 h p.i., the cells were fixed and stained for viral NP and for the overexpressed ISGs. Overexpression of IFIT3, IFI35, ISG15, ISG20 and viperin did not have any obvious effect on the levels of NP or P (data not shown). In contrast, and as shown in Fig. 1 , cells that transiently expressed ISG56/IFIT1 were negative for NP. We next knocked down the expression of the endogenous human ISG56/IFIT1 gene in Hep2 and A549 cells using small hairpin RNA (shRNA; Fig. S1 , available in JGV Online). The cells used here had been engineered previously to express the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) N pro protein constitutively, which renders them unable to produce IFN, although they are still able to respond to exogenously added IFN Hilton et al., 2006) . When control cells (i.e. those that express BVDV-N pro but not shISG56/IFIT1) were infected with the CPI2 strain of PIV5, a normal pattern of virus protein synthesis was observed (Fig. 2 , lanes 1). However, virus protein synthesis was dramatically reduced in cells pre-treated with IFN ( Fig. 2 , lanes 2). In striking contrast, a near-normal pattern of virus protein synthesis was observed in IFN-treated cells with impaired ISG56/IFIT1 expression (Fig. 2 , compare lanes 3 and 4). We also examined the effects of treating cells with IFN subsequent to infection. Again, treatment of control cells with IFN at 8 h p.i. reduced the overall levels of virus protein synthesis, in particular expression of the M and HN proteins (compare lanes 5 and 6 in Fig. 2 ; the position of the M protein is highlighted by an asterisk in the total cell extracts). When the ISG56/IFIT1-knockdown cells were infected with CPI2 and subsequently treated with IFN, a near-normal pattern of virus protein synthesis was again observed (compare lanes 7 and 8 in Fig. 2 ). Knockdown of ISG56/IFIT1 in naïve Hep2 cells (i.e. without the expression of BVDV-N pro ), which can produce and respond to IFN and thus begin to inhibit PIV5 prior to the addition of exogenous IFN to the culture medium, also restored a near-normal pattern of virus protein synthesis, even when exogenous IFN was added to the culture medium (Fig. S2) . Similar results were also obtained with naïve A549 cells (Fig. S3 ). These results clearly demonstrated that ISG56/IFIT1 is primarily responsible for the IFN-induced inhibition of virus protein synthesis. It was also striking that the effect of IFN on the levels of virus protein synthesis in Hep2/BVDV-N pro cells was not due to a general shutdown of protein synthesis, as the levels of host protein synthesis were similar in IFN pretreated, post-treated and untreated cells ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 . ISG56/IFIT1 is primarily responsible for the IFN-induced changes in CPI" protein synthesis. Hep2/BVDV-N pro (control) cells or Hep2/BVDV-N pro .shISG56/IFIT1 (shISG56) cells were treated or not with IFN at 8 h prior to infection with a high m.o.i. of CPI" (IFN pre-treated), or were treated with IFN at 8 h p.i. (IFN post-treatment). At 20 h p.i., the cells were radioactively labelled with L-[ 35 S]methionine for 1 h and the viral proteins were immunoprecipitated. Total cell extracts (left-hand panels) and immunoprecipitates (right-hand panels) were separated by electrophoresis through a 4"12 % polyacrylamide gel and the labelled proteins visualized using a phosphoimager. The position of the M protein in the total cell extracts is indicated by asterisks. Samples of the total cell extracts corresponding to the samples in lanes 5-8 were also immunoblotted for the presence of STAT1 and ISG56/IFIT1 (bottom panel), which are inducible by IFN, and for b-actin.
