We tested at first how different substrates-GEL, FN, and LAMaffected the efficiency of the protocol to isolate LPCs as spheroids, namely PSs and as PDCs. We also performed preliminary optimization of cell culture media: F12 and DMEM low-glucose media could not successfully promote explant outgrowth (data not shown), whereas CEM on each coating yielded sufficient outgrowth EDCs after 2-3 weeks (Fig. 1B) . A significant subset of EDCs plated on poly-D-lysine formed PSs, consistently with a recognized stemness feature [32] , whose yield and size were assessed after 1 week and were independent of the explant coating (Fig. 1C, 1D ). PSs were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy, and no differences were observed in protein abundance or distribution among PSs derived from different coatings (data not shown). Representative panels for PS staining are shown in Figure 2 ; their features were comparable to other described spheroid models. In fact, small PSs at an early stage of growth were highly positive for the stemness marker Oct4 [33] , and proliferating double-positive Ki67+/Oct4+ cells could be identified ( Fig. 2A) . Also, PSs contained a majority of TTF1+ cells (Fig.  2B ) while expressing very low levels of VIM. When attaching to the culture plate surface, however, PDCs spreading from the PS as a monolayer were highly positive to vimentin staining (Fig.  2C) , suggesting the acquisition of mesenchymal traits and cytoskeletal remodeling. PSs contain some dispersed cells positive for AQP5 (Fig. 2D) , whereas KRT5 and pro-SFTPC were detectable in the outer layers (Fig. 2E) , consistently with a commitment gradient inside the spheroid. At early timing of attachment, examples of clusters of cells migrating from the PSs and still highly positive for KRT5 and pro-SFTPC could be detected (Fig. 2F) . Cells positive for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (KDR) and cytokeratin 18 (KRT18) were not detectable at this stage in any of the coatings tested (data not shown). Once fully attached and spread in 2D, relevant subsets of PDCs expressed ki67 (15.8% 6 1.5%), Oct4 (45.2% 6 4.6%), and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1; 38.6% 6 2.9%) independently of the coating, as assessed by quantification of immunofluorescent staining; most were positive for vimentin (Fig. 2G-2J) . PDC monolayers were highly proliferating and undifferentiated, with comparable doubling times between 2 and 2.5 days on different coatings (Fig. 3A) . Comparative expression analysis by real-time PCR for a panel of genes of interest (markers of stemness, pneumocytes, endothelium, and epithelium) in PDCs (Fig. 3B ) revealed that for a subset of genes (TTF1, Oct4, SFTPA1, KRT18), gelatin coating was associated with slightly, albeit significantly, higher levels than fibronectin and laminin, with other genes (i.e., CCSP, p63) showing similar biological trends without reaching statistical significance. PDCs on fibronectin coating had significantly higher RNA levels of AQP5, with a clear trend toward downregulation for SFTPC, suggesting a preferential commitment toward an alveolar type 1 (AT1) phenotype. PDCs contained a subpopulation with clonal growth capacity, yielding a comparable cloning efficiency of approximately 9% on all coatings (Fig. 3C) . The PDC immunophenotype was consistent with previously described results, and was unaffected by coating, with approximately 95% CD90+ and significant subpopulations of CD105+ cells (Fig. 3D ) but negative or very low CD45, CD31, CD117, and CD133 subpopulations; this was consistent with a nonhematopoietic and nonendothelial lineage. Because culture coatings seemed to have a negligible effect on the phenotype of our cell model, we next investigated the influence of the spontaneous 3D-culture switch by comparing gene expression profiles of PSs, normalizing to corresponding PDCs for each coating (Fig. 3E) . Irrespective of the coating, almost all markers were significantly upregulated in PSs compared with PDCs, considering a wide panel of genes for stemness (TTF-1, CCSP, NGFR, and p63), pneumocytes (i.e., AQP5, SFTPA1, and SFTPA2), endothelium (i.e., AQP1 and KDR), and basal epithelium (i.e., KRT18, KRT14, and KRT5). This suggested a spontaneous 3D organization in a microtissue-like structure, inducing epithelial committed phenotypes. The significant, albeit slight, upregulation of Snai1 and b-catenin also suggested that partial EMT mechanisms are involved in PS formation, as already described for other spheroid culture systems [9, [34] [35] [36] . Vimentin expression was significantly downregulated in PSs versus PDCs, consistently with the observed immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 2C, 2H) . Markers of lung endothelial phenotype (i.e., AQP1, KDR) were upregulated, although endothelial proteins were never detectable by immunofluorescence (data not shown) and cytofluorimetry (Fig. 3D) . PDCs maintained sphere-forming capacity, because they were able to yield IIPSs once they were plated back in the appropriate conditions. IIPSs resembled all features of primary PSs. In fact, a clear on/off switch in the expression of key epithelial markers (KRT5, pro-SFTPC) could be observed between 3D (both PSs, IIPSs) and 2D (PDCs) culture by immunofluorescence staining, with the opposite switch for vimentin expression (supplemental online Fig. 1) . To further characterize the phenotype, we performed a double-labeling EpCam/CD90 for flow cytometry. Cells were mainly CD90+ at all stages (supplemental online Fig. 2a) . Results showed that a small EpCam+/CD90+ double-positive population was present in a constant proportion among EDCs, PSs, PDCs, and secondary PSs stages (supplemental online Fig. 2b-2d) ,thus suggesting the stromal, albeit plastic, nature of the cell population overall. To fully elucidate the apparent mesenchymal traits acquired in 2D culture by PDCs, we also performed a mesodermal multilineage differentiation assay on EDCs and PDCs for the three mesenchymal lineages: osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic (supplemental online Fig. 3) . EDCs displayed an incomplete mesenchymal potential, because osteogenic differentiation was not detectable. PDCs selected after the spheroid stage, however, contained a subpopulation with partial ability for multilineage mesodermal transdifferentiation. Nonetheless, such potential was dramatically lower than that of lung mesenchymal stem cells (L-MSCs), independently isolated from lung parenchyma, shown as the positive control in supplemental online Figure 2 . Thus, PDCs significantly differed from resident L-MSCs, and the mesenchymal-like traits acquired in 2D seemed consistent with a transient mesenchymal transition of progenitors induced when not in optimal 3D culture conditions. Next, we performed a differential gene expression analysis between PSs and PDCs after 1 week of culture in BEGM media (Fig. 4A) to test responsiveness to definite pulmonary commitment. PSs were strikingly more responsive to the specific stimuli than corresponding PDCs, indicating both maintenance and commitment of undifferentiated cells toward epithelial (i.e., AT2, basal cells) phenotypes. In fact, stemness/progenitor genes (i.e., TTF-1, CCSP, NGFR, Oct4, and p63), AT2 markers (i.e., SFPTA1 and SFTPA2), and basal epithelial genes (i.e., KRT18 and KRT5) were significantly upregulated compared with control media. AQP5, which was spontaneously upregulated in PSs, was downregulated after BEGM exposure; this was consistent with the induction of a preferential bronchiolar versus alveolar phenotype by this culture media. Endothelial markers were modulated, with a further increase in KDR levels but a decrease in AQP1, which was downregulated in a similar proportion in PDCs as well. PDC gene expression levels were mostly unaffected by specific BEGM media treatment except for a slight decrease in p63 expression and increase in b-CAT expression. PSs cultured in BEGM were also analyzed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy (Fig. 4B) . Vimentin expression was confirmed to be very low, whereas strong Oct4 expression was detectable. Few KRT18+ cells were detectable inside PSs after BEGM culture; KRT5+ and SFPTC+ cells were still detectable in outer PS layers but appeared to involve a thicker portion than basic culture conditions, consistent with the upregulated gene expression levels. Cellular interactions inside a stem cell niche are regulated by both direct contacts and paracrine signaling; therefore, we performed PS-conditioned media (PS-CM) screening to define their specific secretomic profile compared with monolayer PDCs. PSs produce and release a wide panel of humoral factors, some of As indicated by immunofluorescence staining after BEGM culture, vimentin expression in PSs was low under control conditions, and high expression levels of Oct4 were confirmed inside the PS. KRT18 expression was low but detectable, whereas pro-SFTPC was expressed in outer cell layers on a thicker portion than under basic culture conditions. All PS images were taken at the confocal plane of the core, unless specified. Scale bars = 50 mm. p, p , .05; #, p , .01 versus the reference (two-dimensional culture or control medium).

In particular, the strongest array signal was that of EGF, together with highly detectable levels of other growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Binding proteins, such as insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBPs), that regulate growth factor availability and are suggested to play roles in stem cell biology [37, 38] , were produced as well. PSs secreted chemokines, such as IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1a, and RANTES; and proteins, such as osteoprotegerin, with a well-known immunomodulatory function. Metalloprotease inhibitors (i.e., TIMP1, TIMP2), mitogenic factors (i.e., GRO) and regulatory factors for EMT and development (i.e., tumor growth factor [TGF]b2, FGF9) [17] were detectable, as well. When comparing the CMs of PSs and PDCs, significantly different secretomic profiles were evident, as shown by plotting optical density ratios of differentially secreted factors (Fig. 5B ) or optical densities from the screening of the two CMs (Fig. 5C) . Interestingly, the secretion of the epithelial factor EGF had the highest PS/PDC ratio, whereas TGFb1 the lowest, being secreted only by the more mesenchymal-like population (i.e., PDCs).
