Observations of Passenger and Crew Shedding. Our study team flew on 10 transcontinental flights, departing in the morning or afternoon, and of duration between 211 and 313 min. Seven flights had no unoccupied seats, while the others had 2, 3, and 17 unoccupied seats. On each flight our 10-member research team recorded the behaviors and movements of passengers seated and crew serving in the economy class cabin on single-aisle aircraft. Only one passenger on one flight was observed to be coughing moderately and no passenger (of 1,540) was observed to be coughing severely. No crew member (of 41) was observed to be coughing.
