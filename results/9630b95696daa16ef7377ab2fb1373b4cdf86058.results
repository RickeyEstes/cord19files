The relation between smoking and in¯uenza was further analyzed by using a classi®cation of non-smokers, light smokers (1±9 cigarettes per day), moderate smokers (10±19 per day) and heavy smokers (20 or more per day). The rate of serological in¯uenza in the vaccine group was 6% in non-smokers, 3% in light smokers, 3% in moderate smokers and 0% in heavy smokers (trend p = 0.10). In the placebo group serological in¯uenza increased from 9% in non-smokers to 11% in light smokers, 13% in moderate smokers and 15% in heavy smokers (trend p = 0.13). No trends were found for clinical in¯uenza. Table 3 shows the ecacy of vaccination in smokers and in non-smokers. The data do not con®rm the hypothesis that smoking attenuates vaccine ecacy. Rather the reverse was true when serological in¯uenza was the outcome measure. Vaccinated smokers were more protected against serological in¯uenza (corrected OR = 0.17) than were vaccinated non-smokers (corrected OR = 0.71). This dierence in ecacy between smokers and non-smokers was statistically signi®cant (likelihood ratio test p < 0.0001; corrected for age, sex and risk group). When clinical in¯uenza was the outcome measure no dierence in ecacy of vaccination was found between smokers and non-smokers (likelihood ratio test p = 0.46; corrected for age, sex and risk group). Table 4 shows the mean logarithmic titre change, from pre-titre to post-titre and from post-titre to endtitre, in the vaccine group for smokers compared with non-smokers. No great dierences were found in pretitres for smokers compared to non-smokers (adjusted for age, sex and risk group). The rise in titre after vaccination was statistically signi®cantly higher in smokers for A/Singapore/6/86 and B/Beijing/11/87, but not for A/Beijing/353/89 and B/Panama/45/90. For all strains the post to end-titre decline was marginally higher in smokers. The end-titre was still slightly higher in smokers compared to non-smokers for B/Panama/45/90 and B/Beijing/11/87 and statistically signi®cantly higher for A/Singapore/6/86 (P = 0.04, adjusted for age, sex and risk group).
