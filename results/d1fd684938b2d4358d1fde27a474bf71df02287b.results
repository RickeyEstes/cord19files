This study was based on a cohort involving 2656 children hospitalized with respiratory tract infection (RTI) where 162 tested positive for hMPV. From the hMPV positive children we selected samples without detectable co-infections (n = 30) as described in the methods section. Further, children admitted for elective surgery without recent symptoms of RTI were randomly selected and included as controls (n = 10). Table 1 shows that the majority of the children were diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infection (bronchiolitis or pneumonia), and the disease severity ranged from 0-4. One half of the patients had more severe disease with a score higher than zero (S1 Table) . During the period of this study, A2 (43% of the samples) and B2 (42%) were the dominant genotypes found in the cohort and therefore our focus. The length of hospitalization was average 4.1±4.2 days for A2 and 3.1±2.0 days for B2 infected children (P>0.05, Student's t-test). The maximum C-reactive protein (CRP) values in the patients ranged from approximately 5 to 100 mg/L with the majority below 50 mg/L, indicating that severe bacterial infections were unlikely. To determine the presence of antiviral cytokines in children infected with hMPV and controls, we initially investigated the expression of type I, II and III IFNs. Fig 1A shows that only A2 infected children had slightly elevated mRNA levels of the type I IFN-β compared to the controls. As shown in Fig 1B, the mRNA levels of the type II IFN-γ was not elevated in any of the patient groups relative to the controls. In correspondence with this, IFN-γ protein was not detected in the blood samples from any of the investigated children (data not shown). Finally we evaluated the mRNA expression of the type III IFN IL-28. Fig 1C shows that both the A2 and B2 positive patients had significantly increased levels of IL-28 expression. Next, we wanted to investigate the possible involvement of NF-κB and inflammasome-associated genes in response to hMPV infection. Fig 2 shows the mRNA expression of A) IκBα, a repressor gene induced by NF-κB activation [19] , B) IL-1β, C) IL-18 and D) NLRP3 in hMPV infected children and controls. The expression of IL-18 was significantly increased for both A2 and B2 infected children. However, for the other genes investigated their expression was not significantly increased compared to the controls. It should be noted that the standard deviations for the IκBα, IL-1β and NLRP3 expression were high. This was caused by a considerable fraction of the hospitalized children having undetectable expression while others had high mRNA levels relative to control subjects. In contrast, children from the control group exhibited similar levels of IκBα, IL-1β and NLRP3 mRNA levels. To illustrate this individual variation, differences in gene expression for individual A2 and B2 positive patients are outlined in Fig 3. From this figure, it can be seen that A) IκBα, B) IL-1β and C) NLRP3 were significantly upregulated in several patients. Interestingly, most of the patients with upregulation of IκBα, IL-1β and NLRP3 had increased expression of all three genes. To evaluate the involvement of other relevant immunomodulator genes, we measured the mRNA expression of IP-10, TNF-α, IL-6 and ISG54. As shown in Fig 4A, the expression of IP- 10 was increased for both the A2 and B2 infected patients. The TNF-α expression (Fig 4B) was significantly higher in patients infected with B2 compared to the controls. Further, the expression of IL-6 ( Fig 4C) was not increased at mRNA level in any of the groups with hMPV infected children. Finally, the expression of ISG54 (Fig 4D) was markedly increased for both A2 and B2 infected patients. As mentioned earlier, the expression of inflammatory genes can possibly promote pathogenic events during RTI. Consequently, we wanted to investigate if the gene expression profiles differed in children with a severity index of zero compared to those with more serious disease and a higher severity score. As summarized in Table 2 , the mRNA expression of IL-1β and NLRP3 were more frequently upregulated in the children with a severity score of 1-4. Finally, the concentration of several secreted cytokines in blood plasma was measured for a random subset of the patients (n = 10) and the controls (n = 10) as shown in Fig 5. Herein, we also included the chemokines Gro-α and Gro-β to evaluate implications of neutrophil recruitment to the lungs. Fig 5 shows that all of the cytokines included in the analysis, except for IL-28, were detected at significantly higher concentrations in patients compared to the controls. The percentage with up-regulated genes is given in the brackets. Statistical significance is indicated with the P-value from a Fisher's exact test comparing the two groups. Further, as mentioned earlier, IFN-γ was not detected above the threshold value in the controls or patient samples.
