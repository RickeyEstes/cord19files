Reproductive number proxy. Our estimates of R proxy , for each province within China and other countries appeared to be consistent across the range of serial intervals we analyzed, as shown by the vertical lines displayed in Figure 1 for each location. Most regions demonstrated R proxy estimates well above 1, signaling the likely presence of local exponential growth. Univariate relationship with absolute humidity. As shown by two separate data interpolation approaches in Figure 1 , observed patterns of transmissibility as a function of absolute humidity were mixed. Specifically, panel A in Figure 1 (Loess regression) shows that not only dry and cold locations experience high values of R proxy (as in influenza) but locations with high absolute humidity may also have higher values of R proxy , while the magnitude of its variability is small and all values are well above 1. Relationship with environmental factors. The regression model, demonstrates that both absolute humidity and temperature are associated with local exponential growth of COVID-19 across provinces in China and other affected countries (Table 1) . Absolute humidity and temperature yielded a positive relationship and a slight negative relationship respectively. Limitations. Our estimates of the observed R proxy across locations were calculated using available and likely incomplete reported case count data, with date of reporting, rather than date of onset, which adds noise to the estimation. In addition, the relatively short time length of the current outbreak, combined with imperfect daily reporting practices, make our results vulnerable to changes as more data becomes available. We have assumed that travel limitations and other containment interventions have been implemented consistently across provinces and have had similar impacts (thus population mixing and contact rates are assumed to be comparable), and have ignored the fact that different places may have different reporting practices. Further improvements could incorporate data augmentation techniques that may be able to produce historical time series with likely estimates of case counts based on onset of disease rather than reporting dates. This, along with more detailed estimates of the serial interval distribution, could yield more realistic estimates of R. Finally, further experimental work needs to be conducted to better understand the mechanisms of transmission of the COVID-19. Mechanistic understanding of transmission could lead to a coherent justification of our findings.
