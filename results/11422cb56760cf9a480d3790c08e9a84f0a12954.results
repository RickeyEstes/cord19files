Autocatalytic processing activity of EoV 3CL protease in E. coli To determine whether the putative EoV 3CL protease domain can autocatalytically release itself from flanking domains, we expressed the two fusion proteins, His-Pro 2160-2680 -Flag and His-Pro 2026-2738 -Flag, which contain amino acids 2160-2680 and 2026-2738 of the EoV polyprotein, respectively ( Fig. 2A ). Both fragments covered the entire putative 3CL protease region as well as various portions of the neighboring domains. They were linked to the pET32a vector with a His-tag at the N-terminus and an inserted Flag-tag at the C-terminus. After being expressed in E. coli, the proteins were then subjected to Western blot analyses with various antibodies. Western blotting with anti-His monoclonal antibody revealed an approximately 78-kDa band corresponding to the intact His-Pro 2160-2680 -Flag in addition to two cleavage products of around 23 kDa and 57 kDa (Fig. 2B , lane 1). Meanwhile, we observed an approximately 99-kDa band corresponding to the intact His-Pro 2026-2738 -Flag fusion protein as well as two more bands around 38 kDa and 72 kDa (Fig. 2B , lane 2). The cleavage products of His-Pro 2160-2680 -Flag and His-Pro 2026-2738 -Flag with molecular weights of around 23 kDa and 38 kDa, respectively, were presented in relatively smaller amounts than other proteins, and are believed to be the products that were autocatalytically cleaved from the N-terminal of the putative 3CL protease region in both His-Pro 2160-2680 -Flag and His-Pro 2026-2738 -Flag fusion proteins. Of note, both fusion proteins included a 19-kDa amino acid sequence from the pET32a vector ( Fig. 2A, black box) . On the other hand, the 57-kDa and 72-kDa protein bands should correspond to the C-terminal cleavage products of both fusion proteins. The detection of intact His-Pro 2160-2680 -Flag and His-Pro 2026-2738 -Flag proteins (around 78 kDa and 99 kDa, respectively) in these experiments indicates that cleavage of the proteins was not completed. The cleavage products were also examined via Western blotting with anti-Flag monoclonal antibody. In addition to the intact fusion proteins (around 78 kDa and 99 kDa), two cleavage products of around 55 kDa and 21 kDa were observed for His-Pro 2160-2680 -Flag (Fig. 2C , Lane 1), while for His-Pro 2026-2738 -Flag, two cleavage products of around 61 kDa and 27 kDa were clearly detected (Fig. 2C, lane 2) . The 21-kDa and 27-kDa bands should be the C-terminal cleavage products of His-Pro 2160-2680 -Flag and His-Pro 2026-2738 -Flag, respectively, whereas the 55-kDa and 61-kDa bands should be the cleavage products from the N-terminal of the putative 3CL protease region ( Fig. 2A) . Moreover, to exclude the possibility that the cleavage of both fusion proteins was mediated by any bacterially derived protease, the putative core conserved active residue GXC(2383)G (Fig. 1B ) was mutated to GXA(2383)G, which was expected to abolish the processing activity of a 3CL protease. The mutants His-Pro 2160-2680 -Flag(C2383A) and His-Pro 2026-2738 -Flag(C2383A) could not undergo any autocatalytic cleavage, as the Western blots with both anti-His and anti-Flag antibodies revealed only the intact fusion proteins at their expected molecular weights (i.e., 78 kDa and 99 kDa respectively) (Fig. 1D , lanes 1-4). Taken together, these results indicate that EoV 3CL can release itself from neighboring domains via the localization of 3CL protease activity in the putative EoV 3CL region, and the predicted catalytic residue C(2383) is indispensable for the proteolytic activity.
