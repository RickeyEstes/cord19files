In total, we identified 15,981 cases of respiratory ERV in the study period, including 12,798 (80%) due to acute upper respiratory infections followed by 1,954 (12%) due to lower respiratory diseases. The daily mean of respiratory ERV was 15, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 88 patients per day (Table 1) . Because of technical difficulties and maintenance, 218 days of particle size-segregated measurements were missing. Consequently, effect estimates for particulate air pollutants other than PM 10 are based on 818 days of data (13,055 respiratory ERV were recorded in this period). Particle number concentrations were dominated by particles < 300 nm and particle surface area concentrations by particles in the range of 50-1,000 nm (Table 1) . The time series of respiratory ERV showed a seasonal and weekly pattern, with more cases during the cold season and a peak on the weekend and on holidays (data not shown). Size-segregated particle number and surface area concentrations were correlated with meteorologic and other air pollution variables [ Table 2 ; see also Supplemental Material, Table 1 (doi:10.1289/ehp.1002203)]. Particle number concentrations of smaller particles (< 50 nm) and UFP were negatively correlated with air temperature, relative air humidity, and SO 2 . UFP and NO 2 concentrations were not correlated when all days were included in the analysis (Table 2 ) but were moderately correlated when restricted to summer (r = 0.45), winter (r = -0.33), or transitional months (r = 0.16). There were small negative correlations between NO 2 and PNC 3-10 (-0.16) and PNC 10-30 (-0.09) and a moderate positive correlation between NO 2 and PNC 30-50 (0.22) and PNC 50-100 (r = 0.43). Particle number and surface area concentrations of larger particles (> 100 nm) as well as PSC total were moderately correlated with relative air humidity, NO 2 , and PM 10 . PNC total was moderately correlated with all meteorologic (air temperature, relative air humidity, and air pressure) and air pollutant (SO 2 , Abbreviations: PNC x , particle number concentration in the given (x nm) or total size range (3 nm-1 µm); PSC x , particle surface area concentration in the given (x nm) or total size range (3 nm-1 µm). NO 2 , and PM 10 ) variables. In addition, correlations between adjacent particle size classes were high. Respiratory ERV increased by 5% [RR = 1.05 (95% CI, 1.02-1.08)] with an IQR increase (4,400 cm -3 ) in PNC 100-300 with a 1-day lag (PDL model) [ Table 3 ; see also Supplemental Material, Table 2 (doi:10.1289/ehp.1002203)]. Effect estimates for an IQR increase in NO 2 were similar in magnitude to estimates for IQR increases in particle number and surface area concentrations of particles > 100 nm. Some inverse associations were observed with UFP and particle number concentrations of fractions < 50 nm. In most cases PNC 50-100 was positively associated with respiratory ERV based on PDL models, although some single lag model associations were inverse. Effect estimates for PNC, PSC, and NO 2 were mostly higher in magnitude after adjustment for PM 10 [ Table 4 ; see also Supplemental Material, Table 3 (doi:10.1289/ ehp.1002203)]. Associations with PNC and PSC were comparable in magnitude but less precise after adjustment for NO 2 , with borderline p-values (p < 0.09) only for PNC 100-300 and PSC 100-300 cumulative effects over 3 days (present and previous 2 days). In two-pollutant models, associations between respiratory ERV and NO 2 were more consistent than those for other pollutants. Associations with PNC 100-300 were robust to variations in model parameters [see Supplemental Material,
