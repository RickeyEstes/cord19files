Gene replacement in L. acidophilus NCK1909 with modified slpA A slpA modified strain derived from L. acidophilus NCK1909 was constructed by gene replacement. The resulting strain, L. acidophilus NCK2208, includes the 16-mer MPER-encoding sequence integrated into SlpA. To validate this mutation, chromosomal DNA was analyzed by PCR using primers that were either specific to sequences flanking the replaced region or specific to the inserted MPER-encoding sequence (S1 Fig). As shown in Fig 1a, similar sizes of DNA fragments were amplified in both wild type and mutant strains when the outer primers were applied. Meanwhile, MPER-specific primers amplified a specific band only from the mutant strain. These results confirmed the wild type slpA gene was replaced with the modified slpA gene in NCK2208.
