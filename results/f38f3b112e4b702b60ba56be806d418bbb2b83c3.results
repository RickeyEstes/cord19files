To develop an optimal Ebola vaccine using rAd vectors, we first analyzed mutant forms of GP in which the transmembrane domain had been removed. Although we have previously reported that deletion of the mucin domain eliminates cytotoxicity [15] , this deletion removes nearly 200 aa, eliminating many potential T and B cell epitopes. Previous data suggested that the in vitro cytopathic effects of GP may be mediated at or near the cell surface and require transmembrane anchoring of the protein [16] [17] [18] . An alternative approach to the elimination of the GPinduced cytopathic effects was therefore explored by removal of the 26 aa putative transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Diminished Immune Protection of a Mutant GP Lacking a Transmembrane Anchor Domain GP protein was readily detected in the supernatants of cells transfected with the transmembrane-deleted vector DTM(Z), confirming its secretion, in contrast to supernatants from cells transfected with the wild-type GP(Z) ( Figure 1A) . Furthermore, synthesis of the two previously defined forms of GP, generated by posttranslational processing [19, 20] , was readily detected at comparable levels. Deletion of the transmembrane domain eliminated GP-induced cytopathicity in transfected HEK293 cells in contrast to wild-type GP ( Figure  1B ), but total DTM expression was equivalent to wild-type protein levels ( Figure 1A ). To determine whether the DTM mutant of the ZEBOV could protect against infectious Ebola challenge, cynomolgus macaques were immunized with rAd vectors encoding NP and either DTM(Z) or GP(Z). Immunization with GP(Z) þ NP protected all animals vaccinated with either 10 11 or 10 12 adenoviral particles and challenged with 1,000 pfu of ZEBOV 28 d later (Figure 2A ). In contrast, survival frequencies decreased in animals receiving the DTM(Z) vaccine. In the group vaccinated with 10 12 adenoviral particles, protective immunity was decreased by 33% and, at 10 11 , by 66%, indicating a substantial decrease in efficacy in animals vaccinated with DTM þ NP versus GP þ NP (p , 0.05). In a separate experiment (unpublished data), 10 11 particles of DTM alone failed to protect against infection. Analysis of cellmediated immune responses showed that GP-specific CD4 þ and CD8 þ T-cell responses were present in the majority of animals by 3 wk postimmunization ( Figure 2B , left and middle panels, respectively) and correlated well with NP-specific (B) Immune responses in immunized animals. Left and middle graphs: Intracellular flow cytometry was performed to quantify TNF-a production from Ebola-specific CD4 þ or CD8 þ lymphocytes, respectively, from animals immunized as indicated (the 10 12 group contains only three CD8 points due to technical error in one sample). Immune responses were measured at 3 wk postimmunization. Circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles indicate responses for individual animals. Horizontal line indicates the average of individual responses in the immunization group. Results represent the percent cytokine-positive in the gated lymphocyte group, and background stimulation (DMSO alone) has been subtracted from each sample. ELISA titers of Ebola GP-specific antibodies in sera of vaccinated animals collected at week 3 postimmunization (right graph). ELISA results represent endpoint dilution titers determined by optical density as described in Methods. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030177.g002 cellular responses (unpublished data). Antigen-specific cellular responses measured by intracellular cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-a [TNF-a]) secretion were indistinguishable between GP(Z)-and DTM(Z)-vaccinated animals. Similarly, humoral immune responses measured by anti-Ebola GP ELISA IgG titers were comparable in all vaccinated animals ( Figure 2B , right graph). Neutralizing antibody titers were low, and were absent in some surviving animals (unpublished data). These results suggested that deletion of the GP transmembrane domain reduces vaccine efficacy, with no readily apparent correlates of protection.
