Passage 7 of HCMV Toledo contains both wild-type and mutated ULb' regions. Compared to other primary isolates, BAC-cloned HCMV Toledo displayed an inversion in the so-called ULb' region that is frequently mutated upon multiple passages of HCMV. Specifically, BAC-cloned Toledo displayed an inversion resulting from a recombination event within sequences located between UL128 and UL129 at one end and UL133 and UL148a at the other end ( Fig. 1A) (11) . This recombination event led to a truncation of UL128 (19) , a chemokine-like protein that is a subunit of the pentameric complex gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A (20, 21) . While the pentameric complex promotes infection of endothelial, epithelial, and myeloid cells, mutations in the nonessential subunits UL128, UL130, and UL131A are selected for upon passaging in fibroblasts, presumably due to the fact that pentamer-deficient viruses are less cell associated (12 attenuated in vivo (22) , this fibroblast adaptation was at odds with the clinical observations in volunteers inoculated with the Toledo isolate. Therefore, we determined whether early passages of Toledo already contained this deletion by isolating DNA from supernatants of fibroblasts infected with Toledo passage 7 (P7), the earliest passage still available, and performing diagnostic PCR of genes adjacent to UL128 of UL133 and the native versus inverted configuration. In the HCMV isolate TR, used as a control, UL128 is adjacent to UL127, whereas UL133 is adjacent to UL148 as indicated by the appropriate PCR fragments PCR-1 and PCR-3 (Fig. 1B) . Interestingly, the same fragments were also amplified from P7 Toledo, indicating a noninverted genome orientation similar to that of TR. In addition, P7 Toledo also contained genomes in the inverted configuration in which UL128 is adjacent to UL148 (PCR-4) and UL133 is adjacent to UL127 (PCR-2) (Fig. 1B) . Thus, the early passages of Toledo used in clinical trials consisted of a mixture of wild-type and fibroblast-adapted genome configurations. Next-generation sequence analysis of an early passage of HCMV Toledo. To further examine the genome content of low-passage-number Toledo samples in an unbiased fashion, we employed Illumina HiSeq paired-end sequencing on viral DNA isolated from the supernatant of fibroblasts infected with P7 Toledo. The depth of sequence coverage was sufficient to obtain the full-length sequences of both the majority sequence representing the fibroblast-adapted Toledo strain and the minority, presumably parental, wild-type sequence. We will refer to the fibroblast-adapted Toledo strain and the presumably parental wild-type strain as Toledo-F and Toledo-P, respectively. Toledo-F was mostly identical to the Toledo sequence deposited into GenBank (GenBank accession number GU937742.2). However, a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, most of them synonymous mutations (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). These SNPs are either due to sequencing errors in the GenBank sequence or mutations that occurred during further passaging and cloning of the Toledo isolate. In order to model the sequence of the Toledo-P genome and the Toledo-F genome, we edited the reference genome sequence (GenBank accession number GU937742.2) based on our sequencing results. Individual SNPs were allocated to either one or both Toledo genomes based on the following criteria. If the variation was homogeneous, it was applied to both genomes. If the variation was heterogenous, the major allele was applied to the fibroblast-adapted genome, while the minor allele was applied to the parental genome. Usually, for heterogeneous variations, one of the alleles would match the allele in the reference genome, such that "applying" it would be to take no action to the derivative genome at that locus. Alignment of the full-length sequences of Toledo-F and Toledo-P revealed that, in addition to the inversion of the UL128-UL133 fragment which is flanked by two small deletions, Toledo-F had a 279-bp in-frame deletion in the RL13 gene, as previously reported (23), a 59-bp insertion in the intergenic region between UL59 and UL60, as well as several SNPs in the UL region ( Fig. 2A and B) . By comparing the sequence coverage (number of reads) of Toledo-F versus Toledo-P at the SNP loci, we were able to estimate the ratio of the two sequences in the viral DNA preparation. The P7 Toledo-F genomes represented the vast majority of sequences, whereas only 5% of the reads belonged to Toledo-P (Fig. 2C ). Since only these two genome sequences were detected in the P7 sample, it is highly likely that P7 represents an intermediate mixture in which most of the culture has been taken over by a faster-growing, fibroblastadapted variant, with some of the original isolate remaining. Similar observations have been reported upon serial passaging of the primary isolate Merlin where mutations in RL13 occurred within three passages, and mutations in the UL128-to-UL131A (UL128-131A) region upon subsequent passages (12) . Since clinical studies were performed with passage 4 Toledo, these data also suggest that the percentage of non-fibroblastadapted, wild-type, sequence was likely higher, although no passage 4 samples remain, making it impossible to determine the exact composition. TAR cloning of HCMV Toledo. The observed presence of different variants within a given primary isolate illustrates a typical challenge for the cloning of HCMV genomes. Continued passage of Toledo likely resulted in the presence of only the Toledo-F population so that two independently derived BAC clones correspond to Toledo-F (11, 24) . Moreover, four different chimeras of HCMV Toledo cloned as overlapping cosmids with the vaccine strain HCMV Towne were exclusively based on Toledo-F which might explain their limited infectivity and immunogenicity in clinical studies (25) (26) (27) . To enable the cloning of primary isolates with limited propagation in tissue culture, we therefore used the P7 Toledo sample as a test case for a new TAR cloning-based strategy applicable to HCMV isolates in general (Fig. 3 within the P7 Toledo-F genomic sequence. The ratio of P7 Toledo-F to P7 Toledo-P was approximately 95% to 5%, respectively. The positions of long and short terminal repeats (TR L and TR S , respectively) and long and short inverted repeats (IR L and IR S , respectively) are shown. (C) List and frequency of nucleotide differences in the minority sequence Toledo-P compared to Toledo-F. For SNP 164616, the coverage of reads was at least twofold lower than the other loci (indicated by the asterisk), rendering the estimation of frequency less accurate. P, parent; ND, not determined. HCMV isolates, we identified highly conserved sequences that were used to design 40-bp-long, synthetic "TAR hooks" (Table S1 ) for the cloning of the entire genome as 16 overlapping fragments (Table S2 ). Pairs of adjacent TAR hooks flanking 10-to 20-kb regions were inserted into a yeast centromeric plasmid with BAC sequence (YCpBAC) and transformed into yeast together with sheared P7 HCMV Toledo DNA (Fig. S2A) . Each of the 16 fragments which contain 80 bp of homology between adjacent fragments as well as flanking I-SceI sites was characterized by PCR and restriction analysis as shown for fragment TAR04 (Fig. S2B to D). The efficiency for cloning the HCMV fragments ranged from 20% (TAR15) to 80% (TAR03). Since multiple attempts to obtain full-length genomes from the 16 overlapping DNA fragments failed, we assem- Half genomes of HCMV were assembled separately from fragments 1 to 8 and fragments 9 to 16. The corresponding fragments were pooled with a linear YCp/BAC vector that harbored terminal homology to each end of the half genome and flanked by a unique restriction enzyme (RE) site. These DNAs were transformed into S. cerevisiae (yeast) cells, and transformants were screened by PCR for assembly of the half genomes. The DNA from positive transformants was transformed into E. coli cells to produce high concentration DNA stocks. (C) Plasmid DNAs of both half genomes were isolated and digested to linearize the HCMV DNAs. The half genomes were transformed into yeast cells with a linear YCp/BAC vector, which has homology to the terminal repeats of HCMV flanked by unique restriction sites and has a different marker for selection in yeast than was used for the half genome assemblies. DNA from positive transformants was isolated and transformed into E. coli. DNA was isolated from E. coli, and the viral genome was released by digestion with a restriction enzyme targeting flanking sequences. Transfection of the DNA into mammalian cells reconstituted live HCMV. bled the full-length HCMV Toledo in two steps. In the first step, we generated two half genomes by cotransforming overlapping DNA fragments 1 to 8 and fragments 9 to 16 together with the YCpBAC vector into S. cerevisiae (Fig. 4A ). The resulting half genomes were also transferred into E. coli and characterized by PCR analysis (Fig. 4A ). Assembly of the half genomes was very efficient. Positive results were observed in 95% of the clones that were screened. To generate a full-length genome, the half genomes were released from the YCpBAC by I-SceI or PacI restriction digestion and transformed together with linearized YCpBAC containing TAR hooks for the beginning and end of the HCMV genome (Table S1 ). The resulting full-length genomes in S. cerevisiae were analyzed by junction PCR analysis (Fig. 4B) , and positive clones were transformed into E. coli. The success rate for assembling full-length Toledo-F genomes in yeast was approximately 15%, and the transfer of the full-length genomes to E. coli was close to 100% efficient. Next-generation sequence analysis showed that the TAR-assembled HCMV genome was identical to the P7 Toledo-F sequence present in the low-passagenumber sample (Fig. 4C ). To assemble the Toledo-P genome also, we took advantage of the ability to simultaneously change the sequence of each of the 16 fragments either by mutagenesis or by gene synthesis. The major differences between Toledo-P and Toledo-F are located on three fragments: fragment TAR01 contains the RL13 sequence, fragment TAR07 contains open reading frames (ORFs) 59 and 60, and fragment TAR13 contains the UL128-UL133 (UL128-133) region. There were also four SNP differences between Toledo-P and Toledo-F (Fig. 2) . However, since these either occurred in noncoding regions or were synonymous, we did not modify them in our assembly of Toledo-P. The genome alignment is shown as described in the legend to Fig. 2 . Four SNPs were identified in the reconstituted Toledo-F compared to assembled or P7 Toledo-F at positions 89516 (C to C), 94187 (C to T), 94226 (G to T), and 231238 (G inserted). However, all of these SNPs were in regions of lower sequencing coverage and are therefore more likely to be sequencing errors than true mutations. TAR01 and TAR07 corresponding to the Toledo-P sequence were generated by in vitro Cas9 digestion followed by assembly with a PCR fragment containing the Toledo-P sequence (Fig. 5A) . TAR13 was modified to contain the appropriate Toledo-P sequence by first amplifying the inverted region with primers that not only contained the additional sequences for Toledo-P but also contained sequences to restore the proper The genome alignment is shown as described in the legend to Fig. 2 for the sequence of Toledo-P cloned into YCpBAC upon repair of TAR01, TAR07, and TAR13 of Toledo-F (assembled Toledo-P) and the sequence of virus after 4 passages in vitro (reconstituted Toledo-P). (C) List and frequency of nucleotide differences in the assembled and reconstituted Toledo-P compared to the minority sequence Toledo-P present in P7 Toledo. The locations, frequencies, and sequences of these changes in the reconstituted virus are shown compared to P7 Toledo-P. Assembled Toledo contained four SNPs compared to the P7 Toledo-P sequence, since these SNPs were not modified in TAR-cloned Toledo-F. The four SNPs were also found in reconstituted Toledo-P. In addition, reconstituted Toledo-P contained three SNPs in the indicated fraction of the genome. The SNPs in RL13 and UL128 were found in the majority of sequences. However, SNP 231501 (indicated by the asterisk) is contained in a homopolymeric stretch of G's and might be a false-positive result due to a misalignment of the sequencing reads. Additional SNPs were identified in the reconstituted Toledo-P at positions 89795 (C to G), 94414 (C to T), and 94453 (G to T). However, all of these SNPs were in regions of lower sequencing coverage and are therefore more likely to be sequencing errors than true mutations. orientation of the UL128-133 region. A YCpBAC with the remaining Toledo sequences was also amplified, and the two fragments were assembled utilizing Gibson Assembly (SGI-DNA) and transformation into E. coli. The resulting TAR plasmids were sequenced to confirm that the respective Toledo-P fragments had been generated (data not shown). The full-length Toledo-P genome was then generated from two half genomes in which Toledo-P fragments TAR01, TAR07, and TAR13 replaced the corresponding Toledo-F fragments. The assembly of the full-length Toledo-P genome in yeast and transfer to E. coli were not as robust as those of Toledo-F. Only 3% of the yeast Toledo-P clones were correct (compared to 15% for Toledo-F), and the efficiency of Toledo-P full-length genome transfer to E. coli was 10% (compared to almost 100% for Toledo-P). The reasons for this relative inefficiency for Toledo-P are not yet understood. The resulting full-length YCpBAC containing Toledo-P genome was analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) (Fig. 5B and C) . Except for the four SNPs that were not repaired (and hence occur in 100% of the assembled virus), the sequence of the assembled full-length Toledo-P YCpBAC corresponded to the minority, Toledo-P sequence in the P7 Toledo sample. Reconstitution and characterization of TAR-cloned HCMV Toledo. The TARcloned HCMV Toledo genomes were released from the YCpBAC by restriction enzyme digestion targeting the flanking restriction sites with PacI endonuclease. To recover virus, the released full-length genomes were transfected into MRC-5 fibroblasts. After 4 passages in MRC-5 cells, purified viral stocks were generated for in vitro and in vivo characterization. At the same time, viral DNA was extracted by the Hirt method and sequenced by NGS. Comparison of the Toledo-P virus with the YCpBAC sequence revealed frameshift mutations in RL13 amino acid residue 193 and in UL128 amino acid residue 154 ( Fig. 5B and C) . The frameshift mutation in RL13 and UL128 were found in approximately 71% and 85% of the genomes, respectively, suggesting that mutations in these gene regions are rapidly selected for even when starting with a molecular clone. However, while the RL13 mutation truncates the protein by 50% and likely inactivates the protein, the frameshift in UL128 eliminates only the final 16 amino acids. Since UL128 is a subunit of the pentameric complex that facilitates entry into nonfibroblast cells, we determined whether the UL128 truncation would affect the anticipated ability of Toledo-P to infect endothelial cells. In a multistep growth curve (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 0.01) in MRC-5 cells, both Toledo-P and Toledo-F generated comparable titers of virus in the supernatant and with comparable kinetics (Fig. 6A ). In contrast, only Toledo-P was able to grow in human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs), whereas Toledo-F did not grow (Fig. 6A) . These data suggest that Toledo-P retained a functional pentameric complex despite the truncation in UL128. We previously reported a humanized mouse model in which primary isolates of HCMV are able to establish latency and can be reactivated upon mobilization of myeloid cells from the bone marrow (28) (29) (30) . In contrast, laboratory-adapted strains such as AD 169 are unable to do so (P. Caposio, unpublished observations). To compare Toledo-P and Toledo-F in this model, we engrafted NOD-scidIL2R␥c null (NSG) mice with CD34 ϩ human progenitor cells. At 12 to 14 weeks after engraftment, mice were infected via intraperitoneal injection of human fibroblasts infected with HCMV TR, HCMV Toledo-P, or HCMV Toledo-F. At 8 weeks postinfection, the mice were split into two groups, and one group was treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and AMD3100 (see Materials and Methods) was administered intraperitoneally to mobilize human monocytes/macrophages. At 1 week after mobilization, the mice were sacrificed. Total DNA was extracted from the spleens and livers, and HCMV genomes were analyzed using quantitative PCR. When comparing G-CSF-treated to untreated groups, we were able to detect quantitative differences in viral DNA loads in the spleen and liver for both HCMV TR and Toledo-P (Fig. 6B) . In contrast, no increase in viral genome copies were observed for Toledo-F. Moreover, compared to HCMV-TR and Toledo-P, genome copy numbers tended to be lower even in nonmobilized mice infected with Toledo-F. Thus, Toledo-P and Toledo-F strongly differ in their ability to establish latency and reactivate in vivo. Only Toledo-P behaves similarly to other primary isolates (TR, TB40E) in this model, whereas Toledo-F resembles laboratoryadapted strains like AD 169.
