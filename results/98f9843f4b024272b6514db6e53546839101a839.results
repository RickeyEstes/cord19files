The incidence of the 2015TN dengue outbreak are shown in Fig. 3A . The outbreak emerged in May with a handful of sporadic cases and finished the next January with a total of 22,784 cases. We divided the outbreak into six stages: emerging (I), growing (II and III), peak plateau (IV), and decaying (V and VI), to depict the spatiotemporal evolutions of the outbreak. Figure 3B shows the Adjusted R t and Non-Adjusted R t of the outbreak. These R t curves are median or mean estimates of the adjusted and non-adjusted individual reproductive numbers, summarizing the temporal evolution of population-level transmission potential. Adjusted R t provides further information: the shaded area represents the interquartile range (IQR) of adjusted individual reproductive numbers, reflecting the spatial individual heterogeneity of the transmission potential. In contrast, individual reproductive numbers of incident cases that shared identical dates of illness onset are constants in Non-Adjusted R t . This indicates that the incident cases during this period were highly geographically heterogeneous in their transmission potential. The distributions of Adjusted R j in these stages are also multimodal and right-skewed, which indicates that some incident cases could have higher transmission potential (i.e. super-spreaders). Figure 3C shows the spatial distributions of incident cases in these stages. We can identify the linkages between time-varying reproductive numbers (Fig. 3B ) and spatial-temporal distributions of incident cases (Fig. 3A,C) in different stages. In the emerging stage, the irregular growth of Adjusted R t reflects the initial growth of the outbreak with a sporadic distribution of incident cases and a small emerging cluster (Fig. 3C ). Subsequently, in the growing stages (from stage II to III), the epidemic curve started to show exponential growth (Fig. 3A) ; the larger IQR of the individual reproductive numbers (Fig. 3B ) reflects some incident cases with higher transmission potential that occurred and resulted in vigorous expansion of disease clustering (Fig. 3C ). In the stage of peak plateau (stage IV), Adjusted R t dropped under the epidemic threshold (<1), indicating that the outbreak was contained. The spatial distributions of cases also show that the clustering areas remained and stopped expanding. In sum, the time-varying reproductive numbers, Adjusted R t and Non-adjusted R t , can reflect the timing of the outbreak containment according to the epidemic threshold. The Adjusted R t can further reflect the timing of epidemic expansion when the IQR of individual reproductive numbers increases. In Fig. 4 , the distributions of individual transmission distance were compared between the two methods: Non-adjusted and Adjusted R j . Based on the neighborhood transmission setting of Adjusted R j , the transmission distance of an infector is around 200-300 meters and few long-range transmission links (longer than 2 kilometers). Furthermore, we used Adjusted R j = 10 as a threshold to categorize super-(Adjusted R j > 10) and normal-(Adjusted R j < 10) spreaders. The figure also shows that long-range transmission links are from super-spreaders. The result indicates that dengue cases with high transmissibility have the ability to spread pathogens to geographically distant areas. To further explore spatial relationships of super-spreaders and dengue epidemic expansion, we illustrated the locations of super-spreaders and clustering tendency of the dengue epidemic during the rapidly growing period (stages II and III), as shown in Fig. 5 . Except the very beginning of the stage II (June-25-July-6), the figure shows that super-spreaders tend to distribute at or outside the edge of the main clusters from July-06 to August-23. In addition, the circle size of the super-spreaders in Fig. 5 represent their transmission range. Therefore, the locations of larger circles would reflect long-rage transmission occurred at the edge of dengue clusters. It implied that the role of super-spreaders could be the drivers of geographic expansion of the dengue epidemic. In order to profile the roles of different spreaders in detailed spatial transmission/expansion process, we classified the cases into two types, early spreaders and succeeding spreaders. Early spreaders are regarded as the sources of new emerging clusters, and succeeding spreaders are those that come after early spreaders. Figure 6 presents a succeeding spreader a (panel A) and an early spreader b (panel B). In each panel, we also compared different methods (spatially adjusted and non-adjusted) that estimate the transmission probability from a spreader to its potential infectees. The time of the incident cases on these maps is the 30 th day after the onset day of the given spreader. Infectees labeled with darker colors have a higher probability of becoming infected by spreader a or b. . Spatial distribution of super-spreaders (R j â‰¥ 10), compared with the main clusters of the dengue outbreak during the rapidly growing stages (II and III). The red area represents the most clustered region, the center of the ongoing outbreak, while the light yellow area represents the edge of the outbreak. The green circles represent the locations of the super-spreaders, with the radius being proportional to their transmission distances. The maps are generated by R package ggplot2, and sf (version 3.6.1, https://cran.r-project.org). By the non-adjusted method, the two spreaders have identical transmission probabilities and individual reproductive number because of the homogenous mixing assumption (Non-adjusted R a = Non-adjusted R b = 4.15). However, they should play different roles in the spatial expansion of the outbreak. Spreader a (the succeeding spreader) occurred in an ongoing cluster; thus, this case is unlikely to be the primary source that triggered this local outbreak. Spreader b (the early spreader), on the contrary, initiated a new cluster where no case had occurred before, and the following cases that emerged were centered on spreader b. Thus, a subsequent local outbreak can be logically attributed to spreader b as the primary ancestor. The adjusted method (left-side maps in Fig. 6 ), which takes into account the spatial-temporal relationships of incident cases, differentiates the individual reproductive numbers of early and succeeding spreaders (Adjusted R a = 1.84, Adjusted R b = 5.74). It also yields more reasonable spatial transmission potential by upweighting the potential infectees proximity to spreader a in Fig. 6A . To clarify the distinct roles of early and succeeding spreaders in the outbreak expansion process, we compared the distributions of Adjusted R j between different types of spreaders in Fig. 7A . We found that all the super spreaders (Adjusted R j > 10) are early spreaders and most of succeeding spreaders have low Adjusted R j . To examine the generalization of this pattern, we estimated Adjusted R j of dengue cases in top five largest dengue epidemics since 1990 in Taiwan, including KH2002, TN2007, KH2014, KH2015, TN2015, as shown in Fig. 7B . Non-adjusted R j were used as the baseline to control for the fluctuations across different stages of the outbreak. The figure showed consistent patterns among these large-scale dengue outbreaks, which means early spreaders with high transmissibility can be generally highlighted by the spatially adjusted method.
