Median age of patients and controls was 2.77 years (range, 1.20 to 4.12 years) and 3.95 years (range, 2.15 to 4.46) respectively. There were 24 females (43.6%) in patient group and 43 (55.1%) in control group. The age was higher in controls than in patients (P=0.028), and the gender distribution was not different between groups (P=0.330). A total of 42 subjects were found to be infected with one or more of 10 different viruses by multiplex RT-PCR (Table 1 ). The detection rates in KD patients and controls were 32.7% (18/55 patients) and 30.8% (24/78 controls), respectively. More than 2 viruses were detected in 2 controls and 3 patients. Most frequently detected virus was rhinovirus, 10 in patient group and 20 in control group. However, there was no significant difference in the virus detection rate between the two groups (P=0.811), and no virus was significantly associated with KD. Comparison between the 18 patients with positive RT-PCR and the 37 patients with negative RT-PCR revealed no significant differences with respect to clinical findings (Table 2) , including the prevalence of incomplete presentation of disease (P=0.368) and coronary artery diameters (P>0.05 of all coronary arteries). Coronary artery dilatation was detected in 5 patients (1 in RT-PCR positive group, P=1.0). Positive RT-RCR was not related to the existence of respiratory symptoms, because of no difference of the frequency of respiratory symptoms between 2 subgroups.
