The fit of the model can be assessed by comparing the numbers of hospitalisations or deaths predicted using the model and the actual numbers observed in the data set (Fig. 2) . For Australians aged 50-64 years, the annual excess hospitalisations attributable to influenza were 33.3 (95%CI: 23.2-43.4) per 100,000 for influenza and pneumonia and 57.6 (95%CI: 32.5-82.8) per 100,000 for other respiratory disorders (Table 1) . For Australians aged ≥65 years, the annual excess hospitalisations attributable to influenza were 157.4 (95%CI: 108.4-206.5) per 100,000 for influenza and pneumonia and 282.0 (95%CI: 183.7-380.3) per 100,000 for other respiratory disorders. The annual excess all-cause mortality attributable to influenza was 6.4 (95%CI: 2.6-10.2) per 100,000 and 116.4 (95%CI: 71.3-161.5) per 100,000, for Australians aged 50-64 years and those aged ≥65 years, respectively (Table 2) . Influenza was found to be associated with 1.3% of all deaths in Australians aged 50-64 years and 2.8% of all deaths in those aged ≥65 years. For those aged 50-64 years, no significant association was found between influenza activity and circulatory hospi-talisations or circulatory mortality in the model. Similarly, no association was found between influenza activity and circulatory hospitalisations in those aged ≥65 years. However, in Australians aged ≥65 years, influenza-related circulatory mortality accounted for approximately 1200 deaths annually ( Table 2 ).
