To set up a targeted RNA recombination system for PEDV we first created a recombinant PEDV virus carrying MHV spikes (mPEDV). To this end a transfer vector p-mPEDV was construced ( Fig. 2A) that was composed of a 59-terminal genomic cDNA fragment ligated to a cDNA representing the entire 39-terminal part of the genome starting within ORF1b, except for the S gene. This gene was replaced by a hybrid gene encoding a chimeric S protein composed of the 1,263 aa long ectodomain from MHV S and the transmembrane domain plus cytoplasmic tail (61 aa) from PEDV S. RNA was transcribed from the T7 promotor of this vector and electroporated into PEDV-infected VERO cells after which the cells were overlaid onto a murine cell (L cells) monolayer. The recombinant mPEDV virus generated during subsequent incubation was cloned by two rounds of plaque selection on L cells. The identity of purified mPEDV viruses was checked at a genetic level by RT-PCR sequencing of the ORF1b-S gene junction (data not shown) and at the protein level by an immunofluoresence assay (Fig. 3A ). All mPEDV infected cells stained positive both with the polyclonal MHV serum and with the monoclonal antibody directed against the PEDV nucleocapsid protein confirming the purity and the identity of the chimeric virus. In contrast to the parental virus, mPEDV displayed the ability to induce syncytia in the absence of trypsin (Fig. 3A) . As predicted, cell-cell fusion mediated by mPEDV could be inhibited by a MHV S specific, peptidic fusion inhibitor (Fig. 3B) . The generated mPEDV virus was used as a recipient virus to reintroduce by similar procedures the PEDV spike along with other genome modifications by targeted RNA recombination. Candidate recombinant viruses carrying the PEDV spikes can be selected by their regained ability to replicate in VERO cells. Apart from the wild-type recombinant virus (r-wtPEDV) we aimed at constructing a virus lacking the ORF3 gene (PEDV-DORF3). A number of cell culture adapted viruses including the strain used in this study have each acquired during passaging an identical 51 nucleotide in-frame deletion in the ORF3 gene, giving rise to a 17 amino acid deletion (aa 82-98) in their ORF3 protein [10] . We constructed a transfer vector (pPEDV-DORF3, Fig. 2A ) from which the entire ORF3 gene was deleted. Donor RNAs transcribed from the pPEDV and pPEDV-DORF3 transfer vectors were electroporated into mPEDV-infected L cells after which we were able to recover and purify the r-wtPEDV and PEDV-DORF3 viruses in VERO cells. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the intended loss of the ORF3 gene from the viral genome ( Fig. 4A ) and the genetic identity of the ORF3 lacking virus was further verified by sequencing of the RT-PCR product (data not shown). The PEDV-DORF3 grew unimpaired in cell culture (Fig. 4B) , demonstrating that the ORF3 gene product is not required for virus propagation in vitro. In addition, the successful deletion of the ORF3 gene from the viral genome demonstrated the feasibility of the mPEDV-based targeted RNA recombination system to manipulate the 39 end of the viral genome. We next explored the possibilities of expressing heterologous proteins from the PEDV genome by inserting reporter genes at different genomic positions. Transfer vectors were made with the Renilla luciferase gene (936 nt) and the GFP gene (720 nt) at the position of ORF3, creating the pPEDV-DORF3/Rluc and pPEDV-DORF3/GFP vectors ( Fig. 2A) . These marker genes are under the transcriptional control of the TRS of ORF3 (CTAGAC) which is located in the 39end of the S gene, 46 nucleotides upstream of the ORF3 gene. The Renilla luciferase gene was also inserted as an extra expression cassette between the ORF1b and S gene, creating the pPEDV-Rluc vector. To this end the otherwise overlapping ORFs 1b and S were first separated and a unique BamHI restriction site was introduced (p-rPEDV vector, Fig. 2A and B), which did not hamper the generation of a viable virus (data not shown). The Renilla luciferase gene was subsequently cloned into the BamHI site of the p-rPEDV vector under control of the TRS in ORF1B (GTAAAC) originally driving S gene expression, whereas the S gene was provided with a new TRS (GTAAAC; Fig. 2B ). The PEDV-DORF3/GFP, PEDV-DORF3/Rluc and PEDV-Rluc recombinant viruses were successfully recovered by the targeted RNA recombination procedure. RT-PCR analyses confirmed the insertion of both reporter genes at the intended positions ( Fig. 5A) , which was further confirmed by sequencing. We studied the luciferase expression by the 2 recombinant viruses carrying a Rluc gene as well as the expression kinetics of one of these viruses, PEDV-Rluc, upon infection of VERO cells at three different MOI's. The result shows (Fig. 5B ) that luciferase expression levels were linearly related to the MOI during the early phase of infection until 12 hours p.i. whereas at 24 hours p.i. luciferase values converged due to reinfections. Similar kinetics of luciferase expression, but to higher levels, was observed for the PEDV-DORF3/Rluc recombinant virus (Fig. 5B ). Next we studied the GFP expression of the PEDV-DORF3/GFP virus upon infection of VERO cells at two MOI's. GFP expression in PEDV-DORF3/GFP virus infected cells could be seen starting from 9 hours p.i. and became clearly evident at 12 hours p.i. (Fig. 5C ). The cell adapted PEDV DR13 p100 strain can propagate in the absence of trypsin in the growth medium but does not form syncytia when trypsin is absent. Yet the clustered appearance of GFP-positive cells suggests that the virus predominantly spreads locally from cell to cell which may correlate with the reported cell surface attachment of progeny viruses released from infected cells in the absence of trypsin [11] . The early detection of the luciferase and GFP reporter proteins during infection can be applied to develop a more rapid PEDV neutralization diagnostic test. The readout of the classical virus neutralization assay with wild-type PEDV is based on the visual inspection of cytopathic effect and can only be done after a multicycle infection which takes at least 2-3 days. Thus, the PEDV-DORF3/GFP and PEDV-DORF3/RLuc virus were preincubated with dilutions of serum obtained from an experimentally PEDV-infected pig and control serum, and the mixtures were subsequently added to VERO cells and incubated after which the GFP and Renilla luciferase expression was recorded at 9 and 6 hours p.i., respectively (Fig. 5D) . In contrast to the control serum, the PEDV antibody-positive serum was able to neutralize PEDV infection as reflected by the reduction of GFP positive cells and luciferase activity. The results demonstrate that neutralization of the PEDV-DORF3/GFP and PEDV-DORF3/RLuc virus can already be scored within a single replication cycle, thereby significantly speeding up the assay time. This type of assay is additionally preferred as it avoids the subjectivity that is associated with scoring of cytopathic effects.
