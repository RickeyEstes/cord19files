From Seoul and Chungcheongnam-do, 7 ICN leaders participated. Their hospitals (1,122 average beds [range, 706-1,980 beds]) had at least 3 probable MERS cases (range, 3-5,300; 0-82 confirmed cases) during the outbreak. Each leader with an average of 10 years of ICN experience directed PPE trainings for an estimated 50-5,495 HCP, mostly using fluorescent markers. All participants enumerated difficulties in developing hospital-customized PPE protocols and trainings, facing PPE variations, and inconsistent donning/ doffing orders in guidelines. Difficulties observed were classified by theme: ill-fitting PPE sizes, anxiety, confusion from unstandardized protocols, doubts about PPE quality and effectiveness, and complexity of using several PPE items together. Due to the 1 size (ie, extra large) of level-D coveralls, petite female HCP had baggy fits that blunted their work processes. In contrast, for large male HCP with problems rolling down the coverall off their shoulders, 1 hospital changed its protocol to advise them to pull the coverall down by holding the sleeves with hands inside the sleeves on the back. Likewise, cup-shaped N95 respirators often developed cracks in the chin area for small-jawed female HCP. When HCP failed the fit-test or found fluorescent lotion contamination, it provoked anxiety. Evolving PPE protocols over the prolonged outbreak period caused confusion for HCP at later PPE trainings attributable to changes from practical experience or other hospital benchmarks. Inconsistent government protocols (eg, different holding locations for N95 respirators; that is, by side strings or the front) increased confusion. Participants also wanted valid evidence on effective hours for PPE items. The most common doffing difficulty was locating the coverall zipper-slider and pulling it down with gloved hands. Sometimes the overlapping parts of different PPE items were ill-fitted (eg, gaps between goggles and N95 respirator). With more PPE items, the doffing order became complicated and confusing. For example, the outer gloves were not the first doffing item when untying the outer shoe cover strings first. Category branches for the fishbone diagram (Fig 2) included support environment, management, process, preparedness, equipment, and HCP. Depending on hospital budgets, the quality of PPE preparedness differed (eg, purchases of powered air purifying respirators). Limited hospital layouts disrupted space management for PPE use. In the presence of hospital visitors, PPE use was Fig 2. A fishbone diagram presenting a comprehensive summary from the focus group interview. inconvenient. Various underlying factors included task characteristics (from trivial to emergent), selection among various PPE, and absent incentives for HCP compliance.
