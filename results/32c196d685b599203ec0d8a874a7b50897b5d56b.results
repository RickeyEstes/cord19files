The NiV receptor EB2 is endocytosed in different cell types The idea of NiV entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis was supported by the recent report that the NiV receptor EB2 is internalized from human endothelial cells (Korff et al., 2006) . To analyze if EB2 endocytosis is a general phenomenon in NiVsusceptible cells, we performed a qualitative uptake assay using Vero, MDCK, PAEC or HeLa cells which have been transfected with an EB2-encoding expression plasmid. After addition of recombinant mouse EphB4/Fc, a soluble EB2 receptor fused to the Fc region of human IgG, cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h to allow binding of EphB4 and co-endocytosis of EB2 and EphB4/Fc. Surface-remained EphB4/Fc was then stained with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody at 4°C. After permeabilization, internalized EphB4/Fc was visualized by incubation with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Fig. 1 clearly shows that numerous fluorescent intracellular vesicles (green) were found in all EB2-expressing cells indicating that the EB2 receptor is efficiently endocytosed in NiV-susceptible cells. G-containing VLPs and NiV particles are internalized from the surface of EB2-expressing cells To determine if NiV particles bound to EB2-expressing cells are also internalized, we made use of the recent finding that the NiV G protein is released in virus-like particles (VLPs) upon single expression (Patch et al., 2007) . The G-containing VLPs resemble infectious NiV particles in shape and size (not shown) and can therefore be utilized to study G-mediated attachment and uptake into host cells outside of the BSL4 facility. VLPs were generated by transfection of 293T cells with the NiV G tag gene. At 72 h post transfection, supernatants were clarified by low-speed centrifugation and pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion. VLP-containing pellets were resuspended and added to EB2-expressing cells in combination with an antibody directed against the HA-tag. After 1 h at either 4°C or 37°C, surfacebound antibodies were stained with a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody at 4°C. After permeabilization, internalized VLPs were visualized with a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody and cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Merged pictures of the FITC, rhodamine and DAPI fluorescence channels are shown in Fig. 2A . As expected, no intracellular VLPs could be detected in the sample incubated at 4°C ( Fig. 2A, control-4°C). In contrast, a substantial amount of VLPs was found within the cells (red dots) if endocytosis was allowed at 37°C ( Fig. 2A , control-37°C). When we performed the VLP uptake assay in the presence of 0.45 M sucrose which is known to inhibit endocytic uptake in general, internalization was clearly inhibited (Fig. 2B , + sucrose). Many VLPs had bound to the surface of sucrose-treated cells (green dots), but intracellular VLPs were found less frequently. In order to reveal the endocytic pathway required for VLP uptake, either 25 µM chlorpromazine, an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent internalization, or 5 mM β-methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD), an inhibitor of caveolaedependent endocytosis, was added prior and during uptake of the VLPs. Chlorpromazine had basically no negative effect on the internalization indicating that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is not involved (Fig. 2B , + chlorpromazine). In contrast, MCD which removes membrane cholesterol and disrupts lipid rafts thereby preventing uptake via caveolae, markedly inhibited VLP endocytosis (Fig. 2B , + MCD). To quantify the effect of the inhibitors on VLP uptake, the number of internalized VLPs in 40 randomly chosen cells of each sample was counted and averaged. When VLP uptake in untreated cells incubated at 37°C (Fig. 2B , control-37°C) was set at 100%, chlorpromazine inhibited were incubated with EphB4/Fc for 1 h at 37°C to allow binding and endocytosis to proceed. Surface-remained EphB4/Fc was stained with a rhodamine-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody (surface). After fixation and permeabilization, internalized EphB4/Fc was detected by a FITCconjugated secondary antibody (intracellular). endocytosis by only 11%, whereas sucrose and MCD treatment produced a 48% and 51% uptake inhibition, respectively. This result suggests that internalized VLPs have entered the cells via caveosomes. In agreement, internalization of EB2 was also significantly reduced in the presence of sucrose and MCD (data not shown). To support the idea of endocytic particle uptake, we performed an uptake assay using infectious NiV. For this, NiV particles were concentrated and partially purified from infected cell supernatants. Viruses were then adsorbed to Vero cells and labeled with an anti-NiV serum at 4°C. Subsequently, cells were either shifted to 37°C to allow endocytosis of surface-bound virions, or were kept at 4°C. Antibodies on the cell surface were then detected by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies and internalized virus-antibody complexes were stained with rhodamine-coupled secondary antibodies after cell permeabilization. If cells were not shifted to 37°C, no intracellular staining was observed (Fig. 2C, 4°C ), but numerous intracellular (red) viruses could be detected after incubation at 37°C when uptake of virus particles was allowed (Fig. 2C, 37°C) . This demonstrates that a substantial portion of surface-bound NiV particles can enter the cells via endocytosis. Together, these findings supported the concept that NiV uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis might be an additional or alternative route of virus entry to fusion at the plasma membrane.
