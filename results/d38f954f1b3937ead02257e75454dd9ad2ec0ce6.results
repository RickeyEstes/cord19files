A total of 120 interviews were conducted, of which three were disqualified because the interviews were not completed. The mean age of participants was 34 +/ -9.6 years, age range 16-62 years. Of the 117 participants, four (3.4 %) were survivors, 93 (79.5 %) were contacts, 19 (16.2 %) were contact relations and one (0.9 %) was a survivor relation (Table 1) . Two thirds of the participants were females and 77 (65.8 %) had a tertiary education. Forty-five (38.5 %) were health workers and about half (48.7 %) resided in Eti-osa Local Government Area (LGA) of Lagos state ( Table 1) . The most frequently occurring psychological distress among all respondents were "Not been able to concentrate on what you are doing" (38.5 %) and "Lost much sleep over worry" (33.3 %). The least occurring psychological distress was "Been thinking of yourself as worthless" (6.0 %). "Not been able to concentrate on what you are doing" and "Lost much sleep over worry" were the most frequently occurring psychological distress among survivors (100 % and 75 %, respectively) and among contacts (35.5 and 33.3 % respectively). Only 22 (18.8 %) of the participants reported "Can count on less than 2 people for help for serious problem" ( Table 2) . Losing a relation to the EVD outbreak (OR = 6.0, 95 % CI, 1.2-32.9) was significantly associated with the psychological distress of "feeling unhappy or depressed" while being a health worker (OR = 0.4, 95 % CI, 0.2-0.9) was protective. Having no tertiary education (OR = 0.3, 95 % CI, 0.1-0.7) was significantly protective against "Not been able to concentrate", while living in Eti-osa LGA (OR = 3.2, 95 % CI, 1.2-8.5) was significantly associated with "Not feeling reasonable happy". All the four survivors reported they had, "Not been able to concentrate" (Table 3) . Losing a relation (AOR = 5.7, 95 % CI, 1.2-28.0) remained an independent predictor of the psychological distress of "feeling unhappy or depressed". Loss of a relation (AOR = 10.0, 95 % CI, 1.7-60.7) remained an independent predictor of the psychological distress of "Not been able to concentrate" while having no tertiary education (AOR = 0.2, 95 % CI, 0.1-0.6) remained a protective factor against "Not been able to concentrate" (Table 4 ).
