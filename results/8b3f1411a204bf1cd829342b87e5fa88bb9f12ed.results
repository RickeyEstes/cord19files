A total of 138 respondents participated in the survey. Among participants who declared their age (3 did not declare age) the age ranged from 20 to 59 (median 25.6) years with a male to female ratio of 2.5:1. Students/trainee HCWs formed the largest group (41%) followed by nurses (28%) and physicians (16%). Eight per cent (n = 11) respondents were "at increased risk" either because of age or having a pre-existing medical condition. Sixty six per cent (91/138) of the respondents attended Hajj at least once in the past (Table 1) . Of all respondents, 11.6% (16/138) reported receiving all three (meningococcal, influenza, pneumococcal) vaccines, 15.2% (21/138) did not receive any of the vaccines, another 2.9% (4/138) were unsure of their vaccination status. Females were more likely to receive a vaccine than males [OR 3.6, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): (1.0-12.7), P < 0.05]. As The reasons for receipt and non-receipt of vaccines are listed in Figures 1 and 2 respectively, willingness to follow health authority's recommendation was the main reason for receipt of vaccine (78.8%) while believing that they were up-to-date with vaccination and hence did not need any more vaccines (39.8%), and unawareness of Hajj vaccines (31.9%) were the prime reasons for non-receipt.
