We evaluate the haplotype number estimation and clustering performance of VirBin on both simulated and mock HIV quasispecies sequencing data. The simulated data provide us with known ground-truth for accurate evaluation of the clustering performance. To evaluate how the number of haplotypes affects the haplotype inference performance, we produced simulated quasispecies sequencing data consisting of 5 haplotypes and 10 haplotypes, respectively. For each experiment, we evaluate the performance of VirBin from three aspects: haplotype number estimation, clustering performance, and the computed haplotype abundance. When the originating haplotypes of the input contigs are known, we can evaluate both the recall and precision for the clustering step. First, we map the clusters to haplotypes based on the consensus haplotype label of the component contigs. If there is no consensus haplotype membership (e.g. a tie), we map the clusters to haplotypes based on the ranking of the abundance. Let a cluster be B and its paired haplotype be H. As the input to our program is a set of contigs, let the contig set originating from H be C H . Define B ∩ C H as the common regions between the two contig sets. Following other contig binning tools [15, 18] , the base-level recall for H is thus |B∩C H | |C H | , which quantified how many of the bases in C H are correctly clustered in B. The base-level precision is defined as |B∩C H | |B| , which quantifies how many of the bases in cluster B are from contig set C H . Similar metrics can be defined for contig-level, which can be found in the Additional file 1.
