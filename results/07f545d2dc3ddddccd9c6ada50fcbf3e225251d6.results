Wind tunnel test data, field measurements, and LES outputs are cross-compared to quantify their similarities and differences. We attempt to discover what causes deviations in pedestrian-level ventilation in different atmospheric conditions. In addition to wind speed, wind direction will be investigated as well. But first of all, we have to determine which diabatic simulation (T 0 , T 1 , T 2 , or T 3 ) best represents the typical actual boundary conditions.
