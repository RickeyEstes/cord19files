If cells are treated with 10/~g/ml BFA, proteins within the ER acquire endoglycosidase H-resistant oligosaccharides (9, 28) . Since resistance to endoglycosidase H reflects the concerted action of the medial Golgi enzymes, GlcNAc transferase I and Golgi mannosidase II (27) , these data suggest that resident enzymes of the medial Golgi return to the ER upon BFA treatment. Indeed, the redistribution of mannosidase II has been shown directly (28) . We tested whether galactosyltransferase, a trans-Golgi enzyme (37) , and sialyltransferase, an enzyme localized to both the trans-Golgi and the TGN (38; see also reference 2), also return to the ER in the presence of BFA. The 300-kD man6P receptor was used as a marker for the action of galactosyl-and sialyltransferases. This receptor provides a sensitive means to detect glycosyltransferase action, since it contains 19 potential N-linked oligosaccharide addition sites (30) and is highly glycosylated. The experiment was carried out as follows. CHO cells were labeled with [35S]methionlne and cysteine for 60 rain to label newly synthesized rnan6P receptors. At this time, labeled man6P receptors reside in the ER, since these receptors require up to 3 h to fold and be completely exported from this compartment (19, 40) . Cells were then chased for various times in the presence of BFA, and the potential acquisition of galactose residues was determined by affinity chromatography of isolated man6P receptors on columns of the galactosespecific lectin, RCA-I (1). To further increase the sensitivity of the assay, we used CHO clone 1021 cells that lack apparent sialyltransferase activity (6, 8) . In these cells, any added galactose residues will be present at the termini of N-linked oligosaccharides and fully accessible for optimal lectin binding (1). Fig . I (top) shows the results obtained from such an experiment. Man6P receptors isolated from cells immediately after the labeling period should not have contained galacrose. As expected, none of the man6P receptors bound to RCA-I agarose; all were recovered in the flowthrough fraction. In contrast, with increasing times of BFA treatment, man6P receptors acquired the ability to be retained on an RCA-I column, and could be eluted from such columns with galactose. Quantitative analysis of this experiment (Fig. I, bottom) showed that half of the man6P receptors gained the Triangles, +BFA; squares, -BFA. capacity to bind RCA-I agarose within '~2 h. This was somewhat slower than the rate observed in the absence of BFA (hr~ = 80 rain). A control experiment showed that galactose addition was not due to the action of newly synthesized galactosyltransferase, also accumulated in the ER, since cyclobeximide had essentially no effect on the extent of galactose addition (not shown). RCA-I lectin binds to galactose residues present on both N-and O-linked oligosaccharides (1) . To determine if the binding observed was due to the addition of N-linked galactose residues, we carried out a parallel experiment using CHO clone 15B cells that lack the activity of the medial Golgi enzyme, GlcNAc transferase I (20) . In these cells, Figure 3 . Man6P receptors acquire limited sialic acid within the ER of BFA-treated cells. CHO wild type cells were metabolically labeled for 60 rain in the presence or absence of 10 #g/ml BFA and then chased in the presence or absence of BFA for the indicated times. Fresh BFA was added after 4 h to ensure its continued action (13) . Man6P receptors were then isolated by affinity chromatography and applied to slug lectin-Affigel columns. The percentage of man6P receptors eluted from such columns was determined by densitometric scanning of autoradiograms as in Fig. 1 . galactose cannot be added to N-linked oligosaccharides because the oligosaccharides lack penultimate GlcNAc. O-linked sugar assembly is unaffected, since the O-linked sugar acceptor would be GalNAc, rather than GlcNAc, As shown in Fig. 2 , man6P receptors isolated from CHO clone 15B cells, incubated in the presence or absence of BFA for 3 h, did not bind to RCA-I columns. Failure of these receptors to bind to RCA-I columns was not due to the presence of sialic acid-blocked, O-linked gaiactose, because neuraminidase treatment did not increase the RCA-I binding capacity of the isolated receptors (not shown). We conclude that man6P receptors within the ER acquire N-linked galactose in BFA-treated CHO cells. This is consistent with recent results of Lippincott-Schwartz et al. (29) who used indirect immunofluorescence to show the essentially quantitative redistribution of galactosyltransferase to the ER in BFAtreated cells.
