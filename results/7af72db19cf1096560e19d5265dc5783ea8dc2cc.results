Details on herd types, number of animals sampled, and sampling results at herd level are provided in Table 1 . Mannheimia haemolytica s.l., P. multocida, and H. somni were found in 27.3% (3 of 11), 63.6% (7 of 11), and 18.2% (2 of 11) of the BRD outbreak herds, respectively. Mycoplasma bovis was only found in both veal farms with BRD outbreaks (18.2%; 2 of 11). Very few targeted respiratory pathogens (n = 7) could be retrieved from the 3 control herds. In 2 herds (herds 13 and 14), 2 P. multocida isolates were retrieved, whereas in herd 14, 2 H. somni isolates also were retrieved. In herd 13, M. bovis was isolated from a single calf. In herd 12, no respiratory pathogens could be isolated ( Table 2 ). With DNS and BAL, both in cases as controls, P. multocida (n = 67) was isolated most frequently, followed by M. bovis (n = 39), M. haemolytica s.l. (n = 30), and H. somni (n = 13). In case calves, the isolation rates were not significantly different between DNS and BAL for all studied bacteria, except for H. somni which was less frequently isolated from DNS (P < .01; Table 2 ). Mixed infections (i.e., isolation of ≥ 2 respiratory target bacteria from the same DNS or BAL sample) were only seen in cases from the veal farms (Table 3 ). In cases, agreement between DNS and BAL culture results was moderate for all bacteria (j = 0.41-0.60), with the exception of H. somni, for which it was slight (j = 0.16; Table 4 ). A positive DNS culture result in cases significantly increased the odds of a positive BAL for M. haemolytica s.l., P. multocida, and M. bovis (Table 4 ). This relationship was significantly affected by the herd effect (P < .001). Case Beef 9-13 7 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 7 ] in controls), meaning that no Pasteurellaceae or M. bovis could be phenotypically identified from the plate. Compared to DNS, BAL samples were significantly less polymicrobial (P < .001 for cases and controls), more often negative (P < .001 for cases, P < .01 for controls), and more often returned pure cultures of Pasteurellaceae or M. bovis (P < .001 for cases, P < .02 for controls; Table 2 ). In summary, BAL samples returned an interpretable result (either negative, pure, or dominant culture result) in 79.2% of the cases and in 61.5% of the controls, compared to 31.2% and 17.9% for DNS in cases and controls, respectively (P < .01 for both comparisons; Table 2 ). The polymicrobial nature of a sample result was strongly affected by the herd effect (P < .001). A polymicrobial DNS and BAL culture result in at least 1 animal was present in almost all herds (11 of 14 herds, the other 3 herds had no polymicrobial BAL culture result), but there was very large variation in the percentage of polymicrobial results among the herds sampled (Table 1 ). In the cases, a polymicrobial DNS culture result did not increase the probability of a polymicrobial BAL result by ≥30% (P = .09), nor did it influence the probability of a negative culture (P = .52). However, the probability of retrieving M. haemolytica s.l. and P. multocida from the BAL sample still decreased when the DNS was polymicrobial. In contrast, there was no effect of a polymicrobial DNS result on the probability of isolation of M. bovis from the BAL sample (Table 5 ).
