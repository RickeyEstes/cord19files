565 patients had two or more specimens tested (Fig 1) . Of these, 111 patients had 2 or more specimens that were tested positive for HRV/enterovirus (HRV++), 74 patients had a specimen that tested positive for HRV/enterovirus followed by a specimen that tested negative for HRV/enterovirus (HRV+-), 46 patients had a specimen that tested negative for HRV/enterovirus followed by a specimen that tested positive for HRV/enterovirus (HRV-+) and in 334 patients all specimens were tested negative for HRV/enterovirus (HRV--) (Fig 1) . The details of the distribution of these patient groups with regard to the total number of specimens tested per patient is shown in S2 Table. Of the 111 patients that had 2 or more specimens that tested positive for HRV/enterovirus (HRV++), 55 patients had repeated detection of HRV/enterovirus in respiratory specimens taken at least 45 days apart. Specimens of 52 patients were available for typing. Typing was successful in 137 of 139 (98.6%) specimens from 52 patients. Of these, 77 were HRV-A (56.2%), 28 were HRV-B (20.4%), 30 were HRV-C (21.9%) and 2 were Coxsackievirus A21 (1.5%). One patient, in whom the second specimen was untypeable, was excluded from further analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP4/VP2 region of the 136 HRV/ enterovirus positive specimens of the other 51 patients is shown in Fig 2. 18 out of 51 patients (35%) had detection of the same HRV/enterovirus type in at least two respiratory specimens taken at least 45 days apart and thus fullfilled the criteria of persistent HRV/enterovirus infection (Fig 1) . Underlying conditions in patients with persistent infection were acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 5), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 3), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (n = 2), multiple myeloma (n = 1), hemophagocytic syndrome (n = 1), bone marrow aplasia (n = 1), myelofibrosis (n = 1), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1), Hodgkin's disease (n = 1), polyarteritis nodosa (n = 1) and cystic fibrosis (n = 1). 10/18 (55.6%) patients with persistent infection had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Among the 18 patients with persistent infection, the minimum median duration of HRV/enterovirus shedding (i.e. the time interval between the first and the last specimen with the same HRV type) was 92 days (range 50 to 455 days). 33 patients had a reinfection with a different HRV/enterovirus type (Fig 1) . 25 patients had a HRV/enterovirus positive specimen followed by a HRV/enterovirus negative specimens at an interval of 3 to 44 days. These patients were included in the cleared infection group (Fig 1) . Clinical characteristics of the three groups are shown in Table 1 . Age was significantly different between the three groups (p = 0.002, Table 1 ). Immunosuppression and hematologic disorders as underlying conditions were associated with persistent infection (p = 0.003 and p = 0.001, respectively, Table 1 ). The variables age and hematologic disorder were associated with persistent infection in logistic regression analaysis. (p = 0.02) and cleared infection versus reinfection groups (p<0.001) but not between the reinfection versus persistent infection groups (p = 1.00). d Hematologic disorders were acute myeloid leukemia (n = 10), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 9), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 2), chronic myeloid leukemia (n = 1), chronic myelo-monocytic leukemia (n = 2), multiple myeloma (n = 3), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 2), Hodgkin's disease (n = 2), follicular lymphoma (n = 1), hemophagocytic syndrome (n = 1), bone marrow aplasia (n = 2), myelofibrosis (n = 2), auto-immune hemolytic anaemia (n = 1), osteopetrosis (n = 1), Blackfan Diamond syndrome (n = 1). e Pairwise comparisons showed that there was a significant difference between the cleared infection versus persistent infection groups (p<0.001) and reinfection versus persistent infection groups (p = 0.004) but not between the cleared infection versus reinfection groups (p = 0.207). f cystic fibrosis (n = 6), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n = 5), pulmonary agenesis (n = 1), pulmonary valve agenesis (n = 1), follicular bronchiolitis(n = 1), asthma (n = 1), Wegener's granulomatosis (n = 1), myopathia with history of tracheotomia and long-term mechanical ventilation (n = 1). g Diaphragmatic hernia (n = 2), polyarteritis nodosa (n = 1), Gorlin syndrome (n = 1), Pompe disease (n = 1), Niemann-Pick C disease (n = 1), myopathia with history of tracheotomia and long-term mechanical ventilation (n = 1), nephrotic syndrome (n = 1), glycogenosis (n = 1), newborn with benzodiazepine severage (n = 1), resection of small intestine and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n = 1), neurofibromatosis type 1 (n = 1). h Pairwise comparisons showed that there was a significant difference between the cleared infection versus persistent infection groups (p = 0.001) and reinfection versus persistent infection groups (p = 0.006) but not between the cleared infection versus reinfection groups (p = 0.306). i Detection of other respiratory viruses at the first or first persistent episode. The detection of other respiratory viruses was relatively frequent in all three groups ( Table 1) . The nearest HRV/enterovirus type, the duration of virus shedding, the respiratory site of the HRV/enterovirus detection and other respiratory viruses that were detected are shown in S3 Table for the 18 patients with persistent infection. HRV-A was detected in most patients with persistent infection (66.7%). When first episodes of infection or persistent infection were compared between reinfection and persistent infection groups, respectively, there was no statistically significant association between HRV/enterovirus species and persistence (p = 0.15) ( Table 2 ).
