We analyzed two scenarios: one in which the N95 respirator is worn and one in which surgical masks are worn; for both types of masks we considered three different variations in mask effectiveness. Each case is evaluated with 10%, 25%, and 50% of susceptible and exposed individuals wearing masks, while in each case the fraction of infectious individuals wearing masks is slightly larger. When 10%, 25%, and 50% of susceptible and exposed individuals are wearing masks the fraction of infectious individuals wearing masks is 30%, 40%, and 50%, respectively. All simulations assume that in a population of one million there are initially 10 infected individuals reported and everyone else is susceptible. Mask start being used when there have been 100 reported cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009. The numerical results for the percentage of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases are shown in Table 3 for the N95 respirator and in Table 4 for surgical masks. The effective reproduction numbers for each case are shown in Table 5 for N95 respirators and in Table 6 for surgical masks. The cumulative number of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases can be seen graphically for the varying mask effectiveness and the different fractions of individuals wearing masks in Figure 2 and in Figure 3 for N95 respirators and surgical masks, respectively. Table 3 and Table 4 show that when masks are not used, then the total percentage of the population who will be infected is 74.61% in a population of 1 million people. With the implementation of N95 respirators Table 3 exhibits a reduction in the cumulative number of cases of almost 200,000, or a 19% decrease, when 10% of the population wears masks and they are 20% effective. Table 5 shows the implementation of the N95 Respirators' impact on the effective reproduction number < con ; it is reduced from 1.83 to 1.66 when masks are 20% effective in reducing both susceptibility and infectivity and 10% of the population is wearing masks. When effectiveness is increased to 50% < con is reduced even further to 1.4. As the fraction of the population wearing N95 respirators increases, < con is reduced Table 4 shows that surgical masks do not have as large of an impact in reducing the cumulative number of cases as does the N95 respirator. Table 6 displays the effective reproduction number < con when surgical masks are implemented. The lowest value surgical masks reduce < con to is 1.77. In Figure 2 the effectiveness of the N95 respirator in reducing the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 is significant. As the percentage of the population wearing masks increases the number of cumulative cases decreases and when the mask effectiveness is greater, the number of cases is also greatly reduced. The impact of surgical masks is not as large as seen graphically in Figure 3 , the reduction in the cumulative number of cases is relatively small compared to that of the N95 respirator. If mask effectiveness is 5% and 50% of the population wears surgical masks the reduction in the number of cumulative cases is 6%.
