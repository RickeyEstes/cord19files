The baseline characteristics of the 3938 patients with respiratory tract infections are summarized in Table 1 . The mean age of the study population was 22.9 ± 21.7 months (range 7 days-168.0 months), and the sample contained 2195 males (55.7%) and 1743 females (44.3%). The mean duration of hospital stay was 4.4 ± 1.5 days (range 1.0-19.0). The mean age, sex, hospital stay, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels differed with the radiologic findings and causal microorganisms (Supplementary Tables 1-7) . The study population consisted of 177 patients with upper respiratory tract infections (4.5%), 724 patients with acute bronchiolitis (18.4%), 969 patients with acute bronchitis (24.6%), 1978 with interstitial pneumonia (50.2%), and 90 with segmental or lobar pneumonia (2.3%). In multiplex RT-PCR analyses for nasopharyngeal aspirates, human adenovirus (HAdV) was isolated in 137 patients (3.5%), influenza A virus (FLUAV) or influenza B virus (FLUBV) in 107 (2.7%), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) in 297 (7.5%), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in 199 (5.1%), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) in 871 (22.1%), human rhinovirus (HRV) in 172 (4.4%), human bocavirus (HBoV) in 576 (14.6%), and no virus was detected in 813 patients (20.6%). Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was detected in 255 patients (6.5%), and coinfection with multiple microorganisms was diagnosed in 511 patients (13.0%). Hyponatremia was observed in 531 (13.5%) of the 3938 patients, among whom 20 had moderate hyponatremia (127-130 mEq/L) ( Supplementary Fig. 1) . No patient had severe hyponatremia, and two patients had hypernatremia (146 and 151 mEq/L). The incidence of hyponatremia differed according to the radiologic findings (P < 0.0001) and microorganisms (P = 0.001). The incidence of hyponatremia was highest (44.1%) in children with upper respiratory tract infections. It was 10.5% in acute bronchitis, 13.4% in interstitial pneumonia, 16.7% in segmental and lobar pneumonia, and lowest (9.7%) in acute bronchiolitis. Upper respiratory infections were overrepresented in the hyponatremia group (14.6% vs 2.9%), whereas acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis were underrepresented in the hyponatremia group. In univariate analyses, children with hyponatremia were significantly older (P < 0.0001), more likely to be male (P = 0.019), and had higher CRP levels (P < 0.0001) and coinfections with multiple organisms (P = 0.001) than children without hyponatremia. In addition, serum potassium, chloride, total carbon dioxide (tCO 2 ), calcium, and phosphorus levels were significantly lower, and serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were significantly higher in children with hyponatremia than in those without it (Table 2) . Patients infected by 2 or 3 organisms had a higher incidence of hyponatremia then those with a monoinfection. In the hyponatremia group, the detection of two microorganisms was more common (P = 0.004), along with coinfections in general (p = 0.001), than in the without-hyponatremia group. HAdV was the only organism overrepresented in the hyponatremia group (5.3% vs 3.2%). (Table 3) . In multivariate analyses, an older age at admission (OR 1.007, 95% CI 1.002-1.012, p = 0.006), male gender (OR 1.361, 95% CI 1.105-1.675, p = 0.004), and increased CRP levels (OR 1.093, 95% CI 1.060-1.128, P < 0.0001) were independent risk factors for the development of hyponatremia. Coinfection (OR 3.493, 95% CI 0.814-14.998, P = 0.092) had borderline significance (Table 4 ). In a comparison of electrolyte changes among patients (Table 5) , serum sodium (P < 0.0001), chloride (P < 0.0001), and tCO 2 levels (P < 0.0001) were increased in both groups (with and without hyponatremia) at discharge. The mean sodium level in patients with hyponatremia increased from 132.8 mmol/L to 136.9 mmol/L after treatment. Serum sodium levels correlated positively with serum chloride (r = 0.487, P < 0.0001) and tCO 2 levels (r = 0.231, P < 0.0001) and negatively with white blood cell (WBC) counts (r = −0.033, P = 0.037) and CRP levels (r = −0.130, P < 0.0001). CRP increased the odds ratio of hyponatremia by a small amount (OR 1.093). Also, we found an inverse correlation between serum sodium levels and the length of hospital stay (r = −0.037, P = 0.020). However, that correlation differed according to the various microorganisms and radiologic findings ( Table 6,  Supplementary Table 8 ). The area under the curve (AUC) values of age, CRP, and BUN for the prediction of hyponatremia are described in Table 7 and Supplementary Fig. 2 . The AUC value of age (0.586, P < 0.0001, 95% CI: 0.559-0.613), CRP (0.599, P < 0.0001, 95% CI: 0.571-0.628), and BUN (0.559, P < 0.0001, 95% CI: 0.531-0.588) were all significant predictors of hyponatremia.
