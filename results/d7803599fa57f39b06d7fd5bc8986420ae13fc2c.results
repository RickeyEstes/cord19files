3575/08 and 2575 WT share sequence homology except in 3a, 3b, and 5b genes. The complete genome of IBV 3575/08 was sequenced in this study, and the sequences were submitted to GenBank with the accession number KX266757. Excluding the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions the entire genome size is 26,704 nucleotides. The genome comprises ten ORFs in the order of 5′ -1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-3′ . No significant protein truncation was observed. To evaluate the nucleotide sequence identities among 3575/08 and other reference IBV strains, sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses on each gene segment were performed ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Comparisons of the available full-length genome showed that the sequence identities between 3575/08 and other IBV strains ranged from 85.0% (with strain BJ) to 94.9% (with strain 2575/98). Overall, IBV 3575/08 showed close genetic grouping with 2575/98 and other Taiwan local strains in 1a, 1b, S, E, M, 5a and N genes. The sequence similarities of these protein genes between 3575/08 and 2575/98 were 95.6% (1a), 94.2% (1b), 95.6% (S), 93.3% (E), 92.4% (M), 93.4% (5a), and 96.3% (N) for the respective genes. Further comparison of the two spike protein subunits between 3575/08 and 2575/98 showed sequence similarities of 97.1% and 94.4% in the S1 and S2 subunits, respectively. Based on the S gene, 3575/08 was clearly defined as a TW-I strain. The sequence identities of S gene between 3575/08 and other analyzed strains ranged from 67.6% (with strain Georgia 1998 pass8) to 96.4% (with strain 3468/07). While 3575/08 was closely related to 2575/98 in four structural protein genes, their homology in ORF 3a (86.1%), 3b (82.1%), and 5b (95.5%) were relatively low (4.5% difference is considered significant for the 5b protein since its variation among IBV strains is small). According to the phylogenic tree ( Fig. 1) , IBV 3575/08 and 2575 WT are grouped in different clusters with respect to their 3a, 3b and 5b genes. Identification of IBV 3575/08 as a unique serotype. To investigate the antigenic serotype of the newly emerged TW-I strain 3575/08, cross (two-way) neutralization tests against three major serotypes in Taiwan-TW-I, TW-II and Mass type-were performed in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos. The neutralizing titers and the r-values were then analyzed (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ). With the r-value of homologous virus-serum set as 100, the r-value directly correlates with the relatedness of the strains. The results showed that all the r-values obtained in this study were below 30, indicating all the tested strains belonged to different serotypes. Particularly, TW-I 3575/08 conferred poor cross neutralization not only to heterogeneous Mass type H120 (r-value = 1.1) or TW-II 2296/95 (r-value = 3.4) but also to homologous TW-I 2575/98 (r-value = 3.3), supporting IBV 3575/08 as a unique serotype.
