The CHIKV CP contains an active NLS and binds to Karα4 Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is a well-studied Old World alphavirus and its capsid protein is reported to have an N-terminal NLS [4, 15] . To validate the role of the corresponding region in CHIKV CP, the putative NLS containing sequence was cloned in fusion with EGFP and HEK293 were transfected with pNLS-EGFP. As shown in Figure 1A and B, the NLS-EGFP fusion protein was quantitatively imported to the nucleus with 5.48 times (± 1.41) higher nuclear accumulation when compared to the control EGFP expression (1.59 ± 0.42 times nuclear). As in other alphaviruses, a substantial amount of CP was seen in nucleoli [4] . Karyopherins are known to directly interact in the cytoplasm with proteins bearing a NLS and to carry these through nuclear pores into the nucleus. To investigate possible mechanisms of CHIKV CP nuclear translocation, we analyzed the interactions of this protein with various karyopherins. Recombinant CHIKV CP was expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged protein and purified using the Ni-NTA column system. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with various FLAG-tagged karyopherins (Karα1-4) were lyzed and incubated with the purified CHIKV CP. Pull-down assays revealed that the viral CP interacts strongly and specifically with Karα4 ( Figure 2A , lane 4). To confirm the observed interaction between CHIKV CP and Karα4, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with FLAG-Karα4 and CHIKV-CP-EGFP. Cells were lysed and the protein complex was co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. Bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with an anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Figure 2B , the band detected in lane 4 indicated that CHIKV CP co-immunoprecipitates with Karα4. The experiment was performed five times and similar results were obtained each time. No binding was observed in the control experiments using only beads or a non-specific antibody. The CHICK CP binds to the Karα4 major NLS binding site Karα molecules contain two NLS binding sites that directly recognize NLS sequences of cargo proteins. The primary NLS binding site is located at the N-terminal arm (alpha helices that form a hairpin structure) repeats 2 to 4, while the secondary NLS binding site is located at the C-terminal arm repeats 7 to 9 ( Figure 3A ). The NLS major binding site is involved in the interaction with monopartite NLS, while the minor binding site associates with bipartite NLS. The acidic residues of the binding site undergo electrostatic interactions with positively charged functional groups of basic amino acids in NLS peptide regions. The hydrophobic chains of basic residues, like lysine and arginine in the NLS peptide, also form hydrophobic interactions with conserved residues of the binding site [16] [17] [18] [19] . To further characterize the specific mechanism of CHIKV CP binding to Karα4 molecule, we created the deletion mutant Karα4Δ259, which lacks the minor binding site, and analyzed whether this region is required for the interaction with CHIKV CP by pull-down assay. Indeed, Karα4Δ259 was able to interact with CHIKV CP both alone ( Figure 3B , lane 5), and in the presence of excess full-length Karα4 (Karα4-FL) protein ( Figure 3B , lane 6). This demonstrates that CP binds to the Karα4 NLS major binding site. One can conclude that CHICKV CP and Karα4 binding occurs as a monopartite NLS-driven interaction.
