Among the 100 stool specimens from patients with diarrhea, 67 (67%) contained at least one of the four viruses examined for, whereas no virus could be detected in the 33 (33%) remaining samples. The frequency of each individual agent was as follows: rotavirus 59 (59%), astrovirus 8 (8%), norovirus 6 (6%) and enteric adenovirus 2 (2%). Dual or multiple infections were found in six out of the 67 positive samples (9.0%). All of these were combinations of rotavirus with other viruses. In one stool sample, three viral agents were identified and they were rotavirus, astrovirus and norovirus, respectively. Enteric adenoviruses were not found to co-infect with any other viruses (Fig. 1) . For rotavirus and astrovirus, viruses were detected by both EIA and RT-PCR. Identical results were obtained with the two different methods.
