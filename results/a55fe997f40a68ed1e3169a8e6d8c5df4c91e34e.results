Retrospective study. From January 2001 to April 2010, we recruited 8696 pregnant women including 8258 Taiwanese women and 438 foreign spouses from China and other Southeast Asian countries. We excluded 426 (4.9%) who had no data on birth date ( Table 1 ). The prevalence rate of positive HBsAg decreased in each year over the 10-year study period (p < 0.001). By stratifying the mothers by birth date into four groups under different coverage strategies of HBV vaccination as before June 1979, July 1979 to June 1984 (5 years before universal immunization to newborns born to HBeAg-positive mothers), July 1984 to June 1986, and after July 1986 (nationwide vaccination to all newborns), the HBsAg-positive rates were 15.9%, 12.4%, 7.8%, and 2.6%, respectively (p = 0.001). The subjects born after the universal vaccination program had been implemented (July 1986) had a much lower seropositive rate than those born before the program had been launched (June 1984) (p < 0.001). However, the carrier rate had already started to decrease in the women born 5 years before the introduction of the HB vaccination program (July 1979 to June 1984). With regards to nationality, we did not find any statistical difference in the HBsAg carrier rate between Taiwanese and other Asian women (14.5% vs. 12.6%, p = 0.249). A total of 263 HBeAg-positive mothers with 353 deliveries were identified from 1256 HBsAg-positive mothers with 1595 deliveries. No trend was identified in the positive rates of HBeAg during the 2000s ( Table 2 ). Even so, the positive rates of HBeAg did decline with age, from 42.0% in women aged less than 25 years to 9.9% in those aged 35 years or older (p < 0.001). Neither the number of pregnancies nor parity were significantly associated with the positive rate of HBeAg. Moreover, women born in Taiwan had a significant lower HBeAg-positive rate than those from other Asian countries (21.3% vs. 40.6%, p < 0.001). In multiple logistic regression analysis, age and nationality were still independently associated with HBeAg-positive rate ( Follow-up study. A total of 133 women of the 263 HBeAg-positive mothers responded to our request to return for a postpartum follow-up study. After excluding 14 subjects who had received antiviral therapy, the remaining 119 were recruited for analysis. The mean age of these mothers at follow-up was 35.2 ± 4.7 years, and the mean duration from the first diagnosis of being HBeAg-positive during pregnancy to returning for the follow-up study was 5.1 ± 3.2 years. Thirty-six (30.3%) of the women tested negative for serum HBeAg with HBV DNA levels less than 2000 IU/ml, and were regarded as having successful HBeAg clearance. In addition, among those mothers who were persistently positive for HBeAg, 86.7% had an HBV DNA level higher than 2000 IU/ ml (not shown in the tables). In univariate analysis comparing factors related to HBeAg clearance, body mass index (BMI), fatty liver and nationality had a trend of association with successful HBeAg clearance (Table 4) . Furthermore, in multiple logistic regression analysis for these associated factors, only BMI was statistically significant, showing a delayed HBeAg clearance in the women with a BMI < 24 kg/m 2 (OR 3.43, CI 1.40-3.38, p = 0.007).
