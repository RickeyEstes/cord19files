In total, 437 NPA samples were tested for children aged less than two years. One hundred and eighteen children were excluded from the study, either because they had a single respiratory pathogen other than RSV or RV (N ¼ 41) or they had co-infection with two or more viruses (N ¼ 77). Of the 41 children who had a single virus detected on extended PCR panel, the three most common viruses were: parainfluenza virus (N ¼ 14), human metapneumovirus (N ¼ 10) and coronavirus (N ¼ 7). There was no single third predominant viral pathogen identified. The three most common viruses in the coinfection group (N ¼ 77) were: rhinovirus (N ¼ 58), RSV (N ¼ 19) and human metapneumovirus (N ¼ 18). Sixty-three patients had two pathogens, 13 patients had three pathogens, and one patient was co-infected with four pathogens. The remaining 319 children were included in the study: 162 had RSV (114 antigen positive; 48 PCR positive), 65 had RV and 92 served as negative controls. The male:female ratio was 1.4:1 for RSV and 1.7:1 for RV. In the PCR-negative control group, the ratio was 1.3:1. The median age at presentation was 87 days (range 12e692 days) for the RSV group, 92 days (range nine to 693 days) for the RV group and 109 days (range 12e674 days) for the PCR-negative control group. As expected, the occurrence of RSV infections was seasonal, with only 20/162 (12.3%) cases diagnosed between February and October ( Figure 2) . RV was much more evenly distributed all year round, with a peak in December [21/65 (32%)]. Fortyeight percent of cases (N ¼ 31) of RV-associated bronchiolitis occurred outside the non-RSV season (FebruaryeOctober). This difference was significant when comparing the RV group with the RSV group (P < 0.01). Figure 3 Highlights the distribution of risk factors amongst the three different groups. Children with RSV had significantly fewer risk factors (113/162; 70%) compared with the RV group (57/65; 88%) (P ¼ 0.004). Table I summarizes the elements of supportive management (intravenous fluids, intravenous antibiotics, chest X-ray, need for respiratory support) given to patients. Few children in any of the three groups needed HDU and PICU care for advanced respiratory management. Few significant differences between the groups were found, but this may reflect the relatively small number of cases and controls. Infants with bronchiolitis will often have changes noted in their chest X-rays. Figure 4 compares the three groups when ordering a chest X-ray (if requested) and use of intravenous antibiotics. The study data did not show an increase in the use of antibiotics after a chest X-ray (N ¼ 39/227; 17%) in the RSV or RV group when compared with cases in the RSV or RV group who were treated with antibiotics but did not have a chest X-ray (N ¼ 37/227; 16%). However, patients with RV were more likely to have interventions (chest X-rays and/or antibiotics) than patients with RSV (P ¼ 0.034). There were no deaths amongst any of the patients. The mean LOS in the study group was: RSV group, 3.2 days (range 0e13 days), RV group, 4.6 days (range 0e21 days); and Figure 1 .

The greater LOS in the RV group compared with the RSV group was significant (P ¼ 0.032). Children who had a chest X-ray and/or antibiotics had a longer LOS compared with children who did not need such interventions. For the RSV group, the mean LOS for those who needed interventions was 4.5 days, compared with 2.5 days for those who did not need interventions. In the RV group, the comparable figures were 6.3 and 3.1 days.
