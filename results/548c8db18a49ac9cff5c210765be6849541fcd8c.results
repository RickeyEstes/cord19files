All four patients had history of poultry contact (table 1) . The presumed incubation period ranged from 3 to 8 days (mean 5Â·8 days). Mean age was 56 years (table 1) . None of the patients were obese and none had upperrespiratory-tract symptoms or conjunctivitis. All patients had fever, and lower-respiratory-tract symptoms (includ ing dyspnoea, cough, and sputum), and one had prominent myalgia (table 1) . Chest radiography and CT of all patients showed multilobar patchy consolidation and diff use alveolar opacities (fi gure 1A-1F). CT of patients 1 and 4 showed ground glass changes in some areas. Mean time between onset of symptoms and respira tory failure was 9 days. Three patients were given 75 mg oral oseltamivir twice daily after tests for H7N9 virus were positive, starting a mean of 16 days after onset of symptoms onset (table 1) . All patients required respiratory support-oxygen given through nasal cannulae at presentation. Two patients needed non-invasive ventilation by con tinuous positive airway pressure, and three subsequently received mechan ical ventilation. Two patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and all received intra venous methylprednisolone (table 1) . Two patients (pa tients 1 and 3) died 4 days after intubation. The other two patients were recovering clinically and radiologically and had been successfully extubated at the time of writing (fi gure 1). 303 house hold or workplace contacts and 82 health-care workers with unprotected exposure to the four patients were put under medical surveillance but none of them became symptomatic after 14 days. Table 2 lists the results of laboratory investigations in the patients. All patients had pronounced lymphopenia at presentation. Total leucocyte counts were healthy or low at presentation, but leucocytosis with neutrophilia developed with disease progression. Three patients had thrombocytopenia at presentation. All patients' coagu lation profi les were impaired and D-dimer concentrations substantially increased with disease progression. The patients who died had persistent lymphopenia, renal Results for when the patients presented and the patients' most abnormal result during disease progression are given. If the reading at presentation was the most abnormal reading, only one result is given.
