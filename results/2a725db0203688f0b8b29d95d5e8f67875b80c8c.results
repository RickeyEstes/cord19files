Due to improved production techniques more product became available for the trial after cohort 1 was finished. 4H9-G1-LL3 7 Con trol P =0.00 3 Fig. 1 . Daily clinical score. Clinical parameters were scored as described in methods and scores from all animals (cohort 1-4) in the same treatment group were used to calculate the mean daily health score. Error bars represent the daily standard error of all animals in the treatment group (6-8 calves). Statistical analysis of the daily means from treated and control groups for significant differences was done by a full factorial regression model as described in methods. The p-value indicates statistically significantly better health scores for the 4H9-G1-LL37-treated animals when compared to the control-treated animals over the observation period (day 1-10). Despite the fact that the trial had already started, it was decided to increase the dose from 87 mg to 130 mg and from 6 treatments to 9 treatments (for details see Section 2) for all subsequent cohorts. After termination of the trial, statistical analysis comparing the two treatment regimens was performed and no significant difference was observed (data not shown). It was therefore decided to consolidate the data from all cohorts for statistical analysis. Two control calves died, one in cohort 1 on day 4 PI (due to a volvulus of the small intestine) and one in cohort 2 on day 8 PI (due to an acute severe bacterial peritonitis secondary to omphalophlebitis).
