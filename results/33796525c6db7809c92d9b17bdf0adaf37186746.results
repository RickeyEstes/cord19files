Reaction of N-Cbz-L-serine b-lactone with HAV 3C protease C24S The required irreversible inhibitor, N-Cbz-Lserine b-lactone (1a), is readily synthesized by Mitsunobu cyclization of commercially available N-Cbz-L-serine. 19 Depending on the particular species and the solvent, nucleophiles can attack such b-lactones either at the b-carbon to give alkylated product or they can react at the carbonyl carbon to give acylated material ( Figure 2 ). 19, 20 "Soft" nucleophiles such as thiolate tend to attack the b-carbon whereas "hard" nucleophiles such as alkoxide or hydroxide target the carbonyl. 21 Nitrogen nucleophiles may attack at either site. 22 In previous studies, serine or threonine residues in proteins were shown to attack b-lactones at the carbonyl to give acylated products. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] b-Lactone 1a, like other a-amino-b-lactones lacking a b-substituent, is reasonably robust in acid but displays low stability in basic aqueous media wherein hydrolysis to the corresponding hydroxy acid (N-Cbz-L-serine) is fairly rapid. 21 However, its half-life in phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 is 76 min, which is sufficiently long for the inhibition studies with HAV 3C protease C24S variant. 16 This protease variant still has the intact active site Cys172 and displays the same catalytic properties as the wild-type enzyme. The enzyme activity is easily monitored using a fluorometric assay at an enzyme concentration of 0.1 mM and a fluorogenic peptide substrate Dabcyl-GLRTQSFS-Edans. The b-lactone 1a irreversibly inactivates HAV 3C protease with a k inact value of 0.70 min K1 . This process is not affected by the presence of a tenfold molar excess of dithiothreitol, indicating that the inhibition is quite specific. 16 We have previously shown that the corresponding ring-opened hydrolysis product, N-Cbz-L-serine, exhibits no significant inhibition of HAV 3C at a concentration of 100 mM. In our earlier studies we used electrospray mass spectrometry to show that the mass difference between enzyme-inhibitor complex (24,101 Da) and the enzyme alone (23,882) is 219 Da, which is within experimental error of the calculated mass of one inhibitor molecule (221 Da). To determine the mechanism of inhibition, . The left hand panel shows the labeled methylene signal for the enzyme modified at His102, whereas the right hand panel shows the analogous signal for enzyme modified at the active site Cys172. The signal in the right hand panel appears very broad on the proton axis because the contour slice was cut low to be comparable to that used to detect the weak signal in the left hand panel. 13 C-labeled b-lactone (1b) was synthesized and allowed to inactivate HAV 3C (C24S) protease. The enzyme-inhibitor complex was then analyzed by HMQC NMR and a new cross-peak at d c 40 ppm (Figure 3 ) was detected. Comparison to 1 H and 13 C chemical shift model compounds ( Table 1 ) clearly showed that most of the inhibitor 1b had reacted at its b-carbon and alkylated the active site thiol of Cys172. 16 However, when X-ray crystallographic analysis (see below) indicated that reaction had occurred at the 32-nitrogen of the surface His102, the original HMQC NMR spectra were re-examined and a weak cross-peak at d c 55.9 and d H 4.18 could be seen ( Figure 3 ). Its position is slightly displaced from the corresponding chemical shifts (d c 52 and d H 4.4) of the model adduct (Table 1 ) made by reaction of 1a with imidazole, but this is likely due to the presence of nearby protein residues, the additional substitution on the imidazole ring as well as solvent effects. Approximate quantitation of cross-peak intensities for the sulfur and histidine adducts suggests that the ratio of sulfur to nitrogen alkylation is considerably greater than 3:1. The crystallization of the minor component with His102 modified proceeded readily. The resulting 3C-1a crystals could not be easily redissolved under non-denaturing conditions. Some level of catalytic activity was observed when a single 3C-1a crystal was crushed and resuspended for protease activity assay using the fluorometric method as described ( Figure 4 ). This activity can be irreversibly destroyed by a dipeptide inactivator, N-iodoacetyl-Val-Phe-amide, which is known to alkylate the active site cysteine 172 based on both biochemical and crystallographic evidence. 8, 28 Prolonged exposure of the solution containing the two singly modified forms of HAV 3C protease to a 100-fold excess of inhibitor 1a leads to complete loss of the enzymatic activity and multiple covalent modification (i.e. 1:2 enzyme/inhibitor complex) based on electrospray mass spectrometry (data not shown).
