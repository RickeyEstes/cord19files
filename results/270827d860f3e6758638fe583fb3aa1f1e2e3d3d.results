Tolerance of the N-terminal cleavage site (Q 2779 -S 2780 ) of the 3C-like proteinase to mutations The previously predicted Q 2779 -S 2780 dipeptide bond was shown to be the N-terminal cleavage site of the 3C-like proteinase in an in vitro processing assay (Tibbles et al., 1996) . Substitution mutagenesis was carried out to investigate the effects of mutations on the self-cleavage efficiency of the proteinase at this position. The Q 2779 -S 2780 dipeptide bond was first mutated to E 2779 -S 2780 , giving rise to pIBV9⌬1Q 2779 -E (Fig. 1a) . Expression of pIBV9⌬1Q 2779 -E led to the detection of three protein species (Fig. 1b, lane 2) . In addition to the 33-kDa protein, two products of approximately 43 and 48 kDa, respectively, were also detected (Fig. 1b, lane 2) . The 43-kDa protein may represent a fusion product containing the 33-kDa protein and the product encoded by nucleotides 8693 to 8865, and the 48-kDa protein may represent the full-length product encoded by this construct (Fig. 1a) . As a significant amount of the 33-kDa protein was detected from the expression of this construct (Fig. 1b, lane 2) , this result indicates that an E-S dipeptide could be used efficiently by the 3C-like proteinase at this position. Substitution of the Q 2779 residue with a K was then carried out, giving rise to pIBV9⌬1Q 2779 -K (Fig. 1a) . Expression of this construct resulted in more efficient detection of the 43-and 48-kDa products (Fig. 1b, lane 3) . However, a trace amount of the 33-kDa protein was still detected (Fig. 1b, lane 3) . These results suggest that cleavage at the Q 2779 -S 2780 dipeptide bond may be tolerant to mutations and the Q to E substitution is better tolerated than the Q-K substitution. Mutation and deletion analyses of the C-terminal region of the 3C-like proteinase Mutation of the C-terminal cleavage site (Q 3086 -S 3087 dipeptide bond) of the 3C-like proteinase to E 3086 -S 3087 was subsequently made, giving rise to pIBV9Q 3086 -E (Fig.  2a) . Expression of pIBV9Q 3086 -E led to the detection of a novel product with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 35 kDa (Fig. 2b, lane 2) . No 33-kDa protein was observed (Fig. 2b, lane 2) . This was unexpected, as no further cleavage site was predicted to be located 30-60 bp downstream of the Q 3086 -S 3087 dipeptide bond. To investigate the possibility that the C-terminus of the 35-kDa protein may be derived from a novel cleavage site located 10 to 20 amino acid residues downstream of the Q 3086 residue, two deletion plasmids, pIBV9Q 3086 -E⌬1 and pIBV9Q 3086 -E⌬2, were constructed. As can be seen in Fig. 2a , the IBV sequence present in pIBV9Q 3086 -E⌬1 The Q 2779 -S 2780 , Q 3086 -S 3087 , Q 3379 -A 3380 , and Q 3462 -S 3463 scissile bonds and viral products generated from cleavage by the 3C-like proteinase are indicated. Also shown are the IBV sequence recognized by anti-3C, the stretches of hydrophobic residues encoded by ORF1a and the IBV sequences present in pIBV9, pIBV9⌬1Q 2779 -E, and pIBV9⌬1Q 2779 -K. The viral products generated from cleavage by the 3C-like proteinase and the full-length products encoded by some plasmids are illustrated. The molecular masses of these products were estimated according to their migration on SDS-PAGE. The Q 2779 -S 2780 , Q 3086 -S 3087 , Q 3379 -A 3380 , and Q 3462 -S 3463 residues are encoded by nucleotides 8863-8868, 9784-9789, 10,663-10,668, and 10,912-10,917, respectively. (b) Mutational analysis of the Q 2779 -S 2780 dipeptide bond. Plasmids pIBV9, pIBV9⌬1Q 2779 -E, and pIBV9⌬1Q 2779 -K, respectively, were transiently expressed in Cos-7 cells using the vaccinia-T7 expression system. Cells were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine-cysteine, lysates were prepared, and polypeptides were immunoprecipitated with anti-3C. Gel electrophoresis of the polypeptides was performed on an SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel and polypeptides were detected by fluorography. was terminated at nucleotide position 9911. Expression of this construct, once again, led to the detection of the 35-kDa protein (Fig. 2b, lane 3) . Meanwhile, a novel product migrating more slowly than the 35-kDa protein was also detected (Fig. 2b, lane 3) . Its apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa suggests that it is a fusion product containing the 35-kDa protein and the product encoded by nucleotides up to 9911. pIBV9Q 3086 -E⌬2 was constructed by introducing a UGA termination codon immediately downstream of the Q 3086 residue (Fig. 2a) . Interestingly, expression of this plasmid led to the detection of a single protein species comigrating with the 35-kDa protein processed from pIBV9Q 3086 -E⌬1 (Fig. 2b, lane 4) , suggesting that the E 3086 residue is actually the C-terminus of the 35-kDa protein expressed from pIBV9Q 3086 -E and pIBV9Q 3086 -E⌬1. These results demonstrate that mutation of the Q 3086 residue to an E only marginally reduces the cleavage efficiency occurring at the Q 3086 -S 3087 dipeptide bond, but alters the mobility of the 33-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE. To investigate the possibility that the C-terminal region of the 3C-like proteinase may contain sequences nonessential for the catalytic activity of the proteinase, five deletion constructs, pIBV9⌬19, pIBV9⌬20, pIBV9⌬21, pIBV9⌬22, and pIBV9⌬23, were made and expressed in intact cells. These constructs encode proteins with deletions of 3, 7, 33, 67, and 135 amino acid residues, respectively, from the C-terminus of the 3C-like proteinase. Expression of pIBV9⌬19 and pIBV9⌬20 showed that almost full enzymatic activity was maintained upon the deletions. As can be seen, a 35-kDa product representing the C-terminally truncated form of the 3C-like proteinase was detected in both cases (Fig. 2b, lanes 6 and 7) . No full-length product was observed from the expression of pIBV9⌬19 (Fig. 2b , lane 6), but a trace amount of the full-length product was detected from the expression of pIBV9⌬20 (Fig. 2b, lane 7) . Progressively less enzymatic activity was observed when pIBV9⌬21 and pIBV9⌬22 were expressed. In each case, two products representing the full-length proteins and the C-terminally truncated 3C-like proteinase were detected (Fig. 2b , lanes 8 and 9). Expression of pIBV9⌬23 showed the detection of the full-length product only (Fig. 2b , lane 10), indicating that the catalytic activity was abolished by this deletion. These results suggest that the extreme C-terminal region is not essential for the catalytic activity of the 3C-like proteinase.
