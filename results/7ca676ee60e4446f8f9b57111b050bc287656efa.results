Bovine coronavirus, BC-1, replicated in organ cultures from each of four different foetuses. Maximum titres of haemagglutinin were detected between 10 and 14 days after inoculation. The virus was passed serially three times in organ cultures. The medium collected when haemagglutinin titres were highest was used and 0.1 ml was inoculated undiluted into fresh cultures. Maximum haemagglutinin titres increased from 4 in the first passage to 32 in the third (Table I) . No haemagglutinin was detected in uninoculated organ cultures from any of the foetuses. Although some ciliary damage was detected in the first passage of BC-1 virus, this was not seen in subsequent passages and could not be correlated with virus replication. No histological changes were seen in either infected or control cultures. A confluent columnar, ciliated epithelium was present up to 21 days after inoculation. No inclusion bodies were seen in infected cultures. Viral antigen stained with fluorescent antibody was first detected 7 days after inoculation in the cytoplasm of the glandular epithelium of the lamina propria. By 14 days after inoculation patchy cytoplasmic fluorescence was also seen in the ciliated epithelium. Maximum fluorescence was seen 21 days after inoculation in both the lamina propria and epithelium when less than 20% cells showed fluorescence. Patchy fluorescence of the peritracheal connective tissue was also seen 21 days after inoculation. Examination of material from passages 2 and 3 in the electron microscope revealed particles with characteristic coronavirus morphology ranging in diameter from 110 nm to 150 nm (Fig. 1) . Many particles had a complete ring of club-like projections which were 17 to 24 nm long.
