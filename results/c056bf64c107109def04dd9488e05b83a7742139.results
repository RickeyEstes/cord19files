Specific increase of Fusobacterium abundance in C. parvum-only infected calves revealed by metagenomic analysis. Metagenomic analysis based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences was performed for a total of 120 faecal samples collected at six time points from 20 neonatal Holstein calves (Table S1 ). The calves were aged between 0 and 15 days old and were located on a farm (farm #A) in Iwate Prefecture, Japan. All of the calves were female and were born in identical cattle sheds. Birth weights ranged from 35-45 kg. All treatments after birth, including colostrum practices, were identical for all calves. The distribution of the relative abundance of the different bacterial genera is shown in Fig. 1a for each of the three groups: C. parvum-only-infected (n = 8), rotavirus-only-infected (n = 5) and the pathogen-negative group (n = 7) determined by the commercial immunochromatographic test (ICT) strips (Bio-X Diagnostics SPRL, Jemelle, Belgium). None of the animals tested positive for coronavirus infection. The most abundant genus in C. parvum-only-infected calves was Fusobacterium (14.1%, average of all samples), followed by Escherichia-Shigella (12.8%). The relative ratio of Fusobacterium was low in the rotavirus-only-infected (0.7%) and pathogen-negative (2.0%) groups, while the relative ratios of Escherichia-Shigella in the two groups (11.9% and 17.0%, respectively) were similar to that observed in the C. parvum-infected group (Fig. 1b , Table S2 ). The abundance of Fusobacterium appeared to be increased in the faecal microbiota of C. parvum-only-infected calves (Figs 1c and 2a) . A significant increase was found in the abundance of the bacteria between the 1 st (0-1 day old) and the 6 th (10-15 days old) sampling points (Fig. 2a , Wilcoxon test, P < 0.05). No significant increase was detected in rotavirus-only-infected (n = 5) and the pathogen-negative calves (n = 7) (Fig. 2a) . No other genus-specific increase was observed among the top 10 genera identified in the C. parvum-only-infected samples (listed in Fig. 1b-e) . The results of the metagenomic analysis were reproduced by the qPCR assays at the 6 th sampling point (10-15 days old) (Fig. 2b) . A specific increase in the abundance of Fusobacterium was detected in C. parvum-only-infected calves (n = 8) in comparison with the rotavirus-only-infected (n = 5) and the pathogen-negative calves (n = 7). A significant difference was observed between the C. parvum-positive group and the other groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, P < 0.05).
