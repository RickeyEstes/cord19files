S. pneumoniae serotypes with variable haemolytic activities differentially stimulate caspase-1-dependent production of IL-1β by human cells. To confirm that production of IL-1ß by human cells is dependent on PLY and on conventional inflammasomes, we infected human PBMCs with S. pneumoniae serotype 2 expressing haemolytic allele 1 PLY (D39) or with the isogenic mutant lacking PLY (D39Δply) and tested the effect of a caspase-1 inhibitor. We found that only S. pneumoniae expressing PLY stimulated strong IL-1β production, whereas the PLY-negative mutant induced only small amounts of IL-1β (Fig 1A) . In contrast, transcriptional regulation of Il1b mRNA and production of the inflammasome-independent chemokine IL-8 was not affected by the lack of PLY (Fig 1B and  1C) . Moreover, IL-1β but not IL-8 secretion was strongly reduced by treatment with the caspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD (Fig 1D and 1E) . These data are in line with previously published studies and show that pneumococcal PLY is recognized by a conventional caspase-1-dependent inflammasome to stimulate IL-1β production [23, 24] . Next, we investigated the ability of different pneumococcal strains to induce haemolysis and IL-1β production. S. pneumoniae serotypes 3, 6B, and 9N induced red blood cell lysis, indicating expression of a haemolytic PLY (Fig 1F) . In contrast, serotypes 1 and 8, expressing a non-haemolytic PLY, exhibited no haemolytic activities, as shown before (Fig 1F) [21] . Sequencing of the ply gene confirmed the expression of an allele 5 PLY in serotype 1 and 8 bacteria, and demonstrated that serotype 3, 6B and 9N express haemolytic allele 1 or 2 PLY (Table 1 ). Allele 5 PLY possesses several mutations in the protein domain D3 (Fig 1G) , which is suggested to insert into the host cell membrane after conformational changes and is therefore crucial for the pore-forming ability of PLY [41] . In accordance, only serotype 6B and 9N stimulated a strong IL-1β production in human PBMCs, whereas serotypes 1 and 8 did not (Fig 1H) . Unexpectedly, serotype 3 was also a rather weak inducer of IL-1β production. This suggests that other factors than PLY, such as perhaps an extensive capsule production of serotype 3 pneumococci, affect the innate sensing of the bacteria. All tested bacteria induced the transcriptional regulation of Il1b mRNA ( Fig 1I) and equally stimulated production of the inflammasome-independent chemokine IL-8 ( Fig 1J) . Moreover, cell death induced by S. pneumoniae D39 was dependent on PLY (Fig 1K) , and correlated with expression of haemolytic PLY ( Fig  1L) . Accordingly, purified allele 1 PLY induced a much stronger cell death as compared to allele 5 PLY in humans cells (Fig 1M) . Collectively, the data confirm and extend previously published results [24] , and demonstrate that pneumococcal strains expressing diverse toxins induce different amounts of IL-1β production and cell death. The production of IL-1β in S. pneumoniae-infected human lung tissue is dependent on PLY and caspase-1 Next, we tested if the S. pneumoniae-induced production of IL-1β in human lungs is also dependent on PLY and caspase-1. We found that S. pneumoniae D39 but not D39Δply stimulated strong IL-1β production in human lung tissue (Fig 2A and 2B ). In contrast, both strains induced expression of Il1b mRNA and proIL-1β protein (Fig 2C and 2D ). Inhibition of caspase-1 by the specific inhibitor Z-YVAD reduced the pneumococci-induced production of IL- Table 1 . Pneumolysin allele determination by sequencing of ply genes was performed from the 6 isolates used in this study. The first row refers to amino acid positions. The second row shows allele 1 PLY expressed in S. pneumoniae D39 [21] . The amino acid polymorphisms in the clinical isolates are highlighted. Deletion of an amino acid is represented by the abbreviation DEL. Serotype 1 and 8 pneumococci express an allele 5 PLY as previously shown [21] .  doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0137108.t001 1β ( Fig 2E) . Thus, production of IL-1β in S. pneumoniae-infected human lung tissue is dependent on PLY and inflammasomes.
