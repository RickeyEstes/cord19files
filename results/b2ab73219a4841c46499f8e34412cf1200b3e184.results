1 Due to mixed infections, the sum of individual infections is greater than the number of animals which were positive for coccidia. E = Eimeria, I = Isospora. -'The second set of figures in all the columns refers to free-ranging village pigs, and the first to commercially-farmed pigs. 4 Numbers within parentheses refer to percentage prevalence of coccidian oocysts. s Piglets aged 6--24 days. Of the 125 piglets examined, 29.6% were diarrhoeic, and of these, 43.2% were positive for coccidian oocysts. I. suis oocysts were found in 25% of the 16 diarrhoeic piglets which had coccidia, and 10.8% of the 37/88 nondiarrhoeic piglets which were positive for coccidia. Figure 1 summarizes the mean opg data for the five groups of both farm and village-raised pigs which were positive for coccidia. The highest mean opg (23 550) was recorded from the diarrhoeic farm piglets on concrete, and the lowest (6100) from the gestating farm sows. Because of the insufficiency of the samples from the wild boar, opg counts were not taken. brings the total number of coccidian species found in domesticated PNG pigs to nine, a finding in accordance with those from the rest of the world (Vetterling, 1965 (Vetterling, , 1966 Pell~rdy, 1974; Greiner et al., 1982; Lindsay et al., (Rodriguez and Herrera, 1971; Gomez et al., 1974; Pell6rdy, 1974 . Coccidian oocysts were reported in 60% of swine raised on pastures and 2.4% of swine on concrete (Vetterling, 1966) . In a recent survey, Lindsay et al. (1984) reported the presence of coccidia in 81.8% of sows from farms with a history of I. suis coccidiosis, and in 94.8% of sows from farms without such a history. Coccidian oocysts were also found in 87 and 87.5% of feral swine in two surveys (Wheat and Cook, 1979; Greiner et al., 1982) . The present finding that 48.8% of the pigs sampled had coccidia (108/232 of the farm pigs raised on concrete and 53/98 of the free-ranging village pigs)confirms for the first time that coccidia are common parasites of pigs in PNG. A comparison of the total percentage prevalence of coccidia reported in domestic pigs by Vetterling (1965) and Lindsay et al. (1984) , and in feral swine by Greiner et al. (1982) with the results obtained in the present study (Table II) shows that the 46.6 and 54% prevalence in the commerciallyfarmed pigs on concrete and village pigs, respectively (Table I) , is considerably lower. While the effective sanitary controls and hygiene practices prevailing at the commercial farms account for the lower prevalence of coccidia in pigs from these farms, one would have expected a much higher prevalence of coccidia in the scavenging village pigs. Perhaps the absence of confinement, and the free-ranging and ad libitum foraging habits of these pigs in an area of about 3--4 km of open bush boosted their resistance to coccidiasis and/or minimized the rate of re-infection. No other viable explanation to this rather intriguing finding can be offered until further detailed comparative studies are completed. Vetterling (1966) found all his 33 <3-week-old piglets to be free of coccidia, and 1.6 and 59.8% of weaners raised on concrete and pasture, respectively, to be positive for coccidia. My finding that 32 and 59.6% of the 6--24day-old piglets raised on concrete and dirt pens, respectively, and 47.5% of the weaners on concrete had one or more species of coccidia (Table II) differs substantially from that of the above author. Eustis and Nelson (1981) reported that 62.2% of the diarrhoeic piglets they sampled had coccidiosis, and Sanford found neonatal porcine coccidiosis in 20.5% (258/1453) of piglets, and I. suis coccidiosis in 7% of those positive for coccidia. The present finding of I. suis oocysts in 6.4% of piglets (Tables I and II) is comparable to the findings of the above author. The total prevalence of/. suis oocysts in 3.9% of the 330 pigs sampled in the study is comparatively higher than that reported in domestic and feral swine by previous workers (Vetterling, 1966; Greiner et al., 1982) . Lindsay et al. (1984) reported the absence of/. suis in 77 sows from farms with a history ofL suis coccidiosis and only 0.6% prevalence of/. suis in 172 sows from farms without a history of isosporoid coccidiosis (Table II) , a finding very similar to that of Vetterling (1966) . However, the finding in the present study that 8.3% of the sows on conclete were positive for I. suis (Tables I and II) does not support the contention of Lindsay et al. (1984} that "/. suis is not widely prevalent in adult swine". In fact, the 8.3% prevalence of I. suis in the sows on concrete equalled that ofE. perminuta and exceeded that of E. spinosa (2.8%). This, coupled with the cumulative prevalence of I. suis in 6.4 and 1.3% of piglets and weaners, respectively (Table  II}, indicates that I. suis is not an uncommon porcine coccidium in PNG. However, the finding that none of the 6 lactating and 4 gestating village sows were positive for I. suis when 2/19 and 1/17 farm sows were (Table I) , is intriguing, particularly since the samples were collected directly from the rectum and the identification of L suis oocysts strictly followed its speciesspecific characteristics (Biester and Murray, 1934; Vetterling, 1965) , and also in view of the fact that the less hygienic village conditions ought to be more conducive to the spread of coccidia. The only logical explanation for this finding perhaps rests in the fact that the number of village sows {10 only) sampled was too small a group to reveal all the species of coccidia; a conclusion which may also explain why four of the 10 species of coccidia reported from feral swine in the United States were not detected in the five wild boar (Tables I and II) in the present study {Wheat and Cook, 197~': Greiner et al., 1982) . ]Yansmissible gastroenteritis virus (Pensaert et al., 1970) , corona-like virus (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980) , rotavirus (Pearson and McNulty, 1977}, haemolytic Escherichia coil (Kramer and Nderito, 1967) , Strongyloides ransomi (Sangster et al., 1978) , species of Eimeria and Isospora suis (Roberts et al., 1980; Stuart et al., 1980; Coussement et al., 1981; Eustis and Nelson, 1981; Robinson and Morin, 1982; Robinson et al., 1983 ; have been associated with the occurrence of scouring and diarrhoea in neonatal pigs. :Although microbiological and histopathological data were not attempted from the diarrhoeic piglets in the present study, the finding that of the total of 37 diarrhoeic piglets only 16 (43.2%) were positive for coccidia, and of the 16 positive only 4 (25%) shed oocysts of I. suis (Table I) seems to dwarf the diarrhoeic attributes of Eirneria spp. and Isospora suis in neonatal pigs. Furthermore, the observation that of the 88 non-diarrhoeic piglets sampled, although 37 were positive for coccidia m~d of these 4 harboured I. suis, none had any symptoms of diarrhoea prompts the question: do these genera of parasites cause coccidiasis or coccidiosis? An appraisal of the literature cited above and the present results suggest that porcine neonatal diarrhoea and associated symptoms are perhaps the cumulative manifestation of more than one group of intestinal parasites.
