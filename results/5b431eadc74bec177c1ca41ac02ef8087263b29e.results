Phage treatment caused a numerical reduction of fecal E. coli when compared to the controls; the mean log CFU for the placebo-treated group was 9.25 (SE =0.42) versus 9.11 (SE = 0.34) for the phage-treated group, but the difference is not statistically significant (p= 0.15; Fig. 1 ). Additionally, the log CFU of the phage-treated group decreased quickly after the first phage treatment was administered, indicating a potential treatment effect. Nevertheless, despite the known in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of the phage cocktail against E. coli strains (Bicalho et al., 2010) , repeated oral application of high titers of phage cocktail did not significantly reduce fecal E. coli CFU. However, the statistical power of our study was limited, given that only 10 calves were enrolled. To evaluate the susceptibility of phages to acidity, an in vitro experiment was carried out in which the phages were exposed to a range of pH values. Dilutions of 10 and 10 showed higher lytic action among all the serial dilutions made in our laboratory. Relative viability was estimated by comparing the phage titer in acidic SM buffer with that in neutral SM buffer, pH 7.5. Phages were nonviable at pH 1 and 2. The effects of higher pH (pH 3-11) on the viability of all 4 phages used in this study were not evident (Fig. 2) . In the present study, fecal phage titers were estimated by spotting 10 μl of each dilution tube onto a bacterial lawn of E. coli 137. The presence of phage in each diluted sample was determined by the occurrence of plaques (clearing zones) in the bacterial lawn. Bacteriophages were recovered only from the treated group, and only after study day 3, 24 h after the first phage treatment (Fig. 3) . E. coli-infecting phages were recovered from all phage-treated calves at concentrations of 10²-10³ PFU/g of fecal matter on study days 4 and 5, but no bacteriophages were detected in the feces of control calves. On study day 6, mean phage titers reached approximately 10 PFU/g, and on study days 7-10 the mean phage titers decreased to 10 PFU/g. On study day 11, the final day of the study, the mean phage titer was 10 PFU. Rozema et al. (2009) reported a significant decrease in E. coli O157:H7 in orally bacteriophage-treated adult cattle compared to steers who received the treatment by rectal application. They concluded that the longer retention time experienced by the orally administered phages within the digestive tract, with the digesta being present in both liquid and solid phases, increased the opportunity for the phages to interact with their target E. coli cells and replicate, thereby increasing both the phage population size and the likelihood of infection of additional E. coli cells.
