From July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2013, a total of 38,775 (24,762 SARI and 14,013 ILI) specimens were collected from patients in the 11 sentinel surveillance sites. Overall, 90% of SARI samples and 87% of ILI samples were collected from children ,5 years ( Table 1 ). The median ages of SARI and ILI cases were 1 year (range: 1 month-95 years) and 1 year and 4 months (range: 1 month-75 years), respectively. Of the SARI and ILI cases, 10,823 (44%) and 6,582 (47%) were female, respectively. A significantly greater percentage of SARI patients reported having any underlying and chronic conditions compared to ILI patients (6.8% vs. 2.3%, p,0.001). The most common underlying medical conditions and chronic symptoms reported were recurrent chest pain (2.0%) and asthma (1.5%) among SARI patients, and asthma (0.6%) and chronic shortness of breath (0.5%) among ILI patients. The median duration of illness from the date of symptom onset to presentation at the health facility was three days [interquartile range (IQR): 2-5 days] for SARI patients, and 2 days (IQR: 1-3 days) for ILI patients. Although overall 1.5% of all SARI and ILI patients reported having received influenza vaccination in the previous year, the majority of these patients (60%) were from Kakuma Refugee Camp (data not shown), where free seasonal influenza vaccine was distributed by the Kenyan Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation in 2010. Overall 16.0% of SARI patients ,5 years old, 18.6% of SARI patients $5 years old and 9.7% of all ILI patients had been hospitalized during the previous year. In all, 2,378 (9.6% of total) SARI cases and 2,041 (14.6%) of ILI cases were positive for influenza viruses (p,0.001, Table 1 ). For years in which a complete calendar year of surveillance was conducted, the percentage of influenza-positive SARI cases ranged from a low of 7.2% in 2012 to a high of 12.0% in 2009, while the percentage of influenza-positive ILI cases ranged from a low of 8.1% in 2012 to a high of 18.2% in 2009. Of all influenza-positive SARI specimens, 77.1% were influenza A, 22.1% were influenza B, and 0.8% were co-infections with influenza A and B. Among the influenza-positive ILI samples collected, 77.2% were influenza A, 20.7% were influenza B, and 2.1% were co-infections. Most influenza A samples that were subtyped were either H3 (25.8% and 25.1% of SARI and ILI patients, respectively) or A(H1N1) pdm09 (32.1% and 37.1% of SARI and ILI patients tested after May 2009, respectively). In the six years of surveillance, influenza circulated nearly every month. There were periods of increased influenza activity, particularly during the initial months that pandemic influenza A Table 2) . Asthma was less common in influenza-positive children compared to influenza-negative children (aOR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.9). Fever and convulsions were slightly more common in influenzapositive patients, while weight loss was more common in influenzanegative children. Among SARI patients $5 years old, no demographic factors were associated with influenza cases, and headache was the only symptom more common in influenzapositive cases compared with influenza-negative cases (aOR = 1.4 (95% CI = 1.1-2.0) ( Table 3 ). For ILI and SARI patients ,5 years old and $5 years old, in multivariate analysis, the percentage of influenza positivity varied by hospital (p,0.001 for all three comparisons). Among ILI cases, children #23 months old had the lowest percentage of influenza-positive specimens [844/7916 (10.7%] compared to all other age groups. ILI patients who presented to the hospital after 7 days of illness were less likely to be influenzapositive compared to ILI patients with shorter presentations. There were no other demographic characteristics or clinical signs or symptoms that were significantly associated with either influenza-positive or influenza-negative ILI patients (Table 4) . Of the 9,419 SARI patients who were followed up after being admitted to the hospital, 257 (2.7%) died; 246 (96%) of these deaths occurred within 30 days of admission ( Table 5 ). The median length of stay was 4 days (IQR = 2-6 days) for all SARI patients. The percentage of SARI patients who died varied between hospitals, and SARI patients with underlying chronic disease were more likely to die than those without (Adjusted Relative Risk = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.3-2.8). There was no difference in the duration of hospitalization between influenza-positive and influenza-negative patients. However, fewer influenza-positive patients died compared to influenza-negative patients (0.9% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.010). Of the seven influenza-positive patients who died, six were male, the median age was 1 year (range: 8 months-32 years), and the median number of days between admission and death was 12 days (range 4-19 days). Three had pandemic influenza H1N1, one had H3N2, three had influenza B, and two were influenza A with indeterminate subtyping results.
