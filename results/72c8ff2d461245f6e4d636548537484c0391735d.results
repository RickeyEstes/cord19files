In total, 15 older adults, aged between 66 and 85 years old, were interviewed. Data saturation was achieved. There were 8 male and 7 female participants. 9 interviews were conducted in English and 6 in Mandarin. The date of last vaccination was self-reported by participants and used to categorise participants by their vaccination status in the analysis. Three categories were defined; acceptors who had received the influenza vaccine within the one year prior to the interview, defaulters who had received the influenza vaccine previously but not in the year prior to the interview and refusers who had never taken the influenza vaccine. Overall, the sample consisted of 6 refusers, 3 defaulters and 6 acceptors ( Table 1) .
