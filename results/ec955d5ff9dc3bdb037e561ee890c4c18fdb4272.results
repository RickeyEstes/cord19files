Eleven coronavirus ICK positive specimens were collected from the CRVL and then subjected to further analysis at the Virology Unit, Department of Biological Sciences, Cork Institute of Technology (CIT). Of the 11 positive faecal samples tested using an ICK, 8/11 (72.7 %) tested positive for coronavirus using molecular techniques (Table 1) . Initial analysis was carried out using the online BLAST tool, Bioedit [14] , and using MEGA5.1 [15] for phylogenetic analysis. Initially, a partial sequence representing the HVR of the spike was characterized, 7/8 strains were successfully amplified, and 4 representative strains were selected and sequenced. Fig. 3 Maximum likelihood tree based on the complete spike gene (4092 bp), including the S1 and S2 subunits. Irish isolates from this study are indicated by a filled circle (â€¢) in the tree Sequence alignment of the spike HVR showed that Irish strains had novel substitutions compared to the Mebus strain sharing between 92.2-93.5 % amino acid identity. The hypervariable region of the spike gene (S) had 7 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 464 bp sequence, resulting in 3 amino acid changes (Fig. 1) ; the amino acid changes occurred at positions 21, 60 and 149. Position 21 had a substitution from proline to leucine, found only in isolate RVLC4. Position 60 shows two different residue changes, the most common being proline to serine (RVLC4, 9, 10 However, only 3/4 of the Irish strains contained this proline to serine substitution, while the fourth contained a change from proline to phenylalanine (RVLC 7), which has a different polarity and lacks the ability to be phosphorylated. The position 149 shift was found in all strains and resulted in an aspartic acid residue being changed to glutamic acid here. From alignment analysis of the HVR sequences, one isolate was selected for complete sequencing of the whole S gene, using primers previously described [12, 13] . Isolate RVLC7 was selected due to the novel polymorphism identified in position 60 of the HVR (proline to phenylalanine, corresponding to position 501 in the complete S protein). As depicted in Table 2 , the complete spike protein contained a total of 14 residue changes when compared to the Mebus strain; 9 of these changes were shared with other strains found in Europe (light grey regions in Table 2 ), Table 2 ).
