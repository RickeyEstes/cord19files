Forty two paired canine serum samples were examined for antibody to the type strain of M. cynos using Western blotting. The paired samples were taken on the day of entry into the kennel and 21 days later. An immunodominant antigen of 45 kDa was clearly prominent in the blots (Fig. 1) . Many of the dogs showed reactivity to this antigen in both the entry and 21-day sera while others showed no reactivity from either serum. Fifteen of the dogs (36%) showed a two-fold or greater increase in antibody to a 45 kDa antigen and in some cases this was a marked increase. Of the 42 dogs, 26 (62%) became clinically sick with respiratory symptoms during the 21-day period after admission, while 16 (38%) remained healthy. Of the 26 diseased dogs, 46% had become seropositive to M. cynos while 54% had not seroconverted. Of the 16 clinically healthy dogs, only 3 (19%) had serocon-verted compared to 13 (81%) which had not (Table 1 ; p = 0.07). As a comparison, the same sera were analysed against M. felis antigen by immunoblotting. A larger number of M. felis antigens were recognised by the canine serum samples. However, there was no discernable difference between the days 1 and 21 serum samples with respect to the number or intensity of the antigens detected. The clinical status of the animals was related to the increase in antibody levels. Comparison of the numerical values of the increase in band peak intensity for the two groups (healthy versus diseased) by the Mann-Whitney test showed the difference in the two groups to be statistically significant ( p < 0.05).
