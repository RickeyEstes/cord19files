Virus infection reprogrammed host lipid metabolism. To understand the host response to virus infection, we determined the transcriptomic profile of human bronchial epithelial Calu-3 cells infected with MERS-CoV. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed to explore multiple aspects of virus-host interaction, including cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, human diseases, organismal systems, and metabolism (Fig. 1a) . Within the major category of metabolism, there is a combinational GO item with many global and overview maps that comprise sub-items such as carbon metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and biosynthesis of amino acids 16 . Notably, lipid metabolism was the top-ranking affected metabolic pathway, highlighting the importance of lipids among the metabolic changes triggered by MERS-CoV infection. In addition, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that steroid biosynthesis being the most highly enriched pathway, which indicated the markedly heightened lipid demands during MERS-CoV life cycle (Supplementary Figure 1a) . To explore how MERS-CoV infection perturbed lipid metabolism, an untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed in MERS-CoVinfected Calu-3 cells. Lipid features significantly changed with p < 0.05 (Student's t-test) in MERS-CoV-infected cells were selected. For better demonstration of changed lipids profile trend after MERS-CoV infection, a Heatmap was constructed according to the identified lipid list (Supplementary Data 1). As shown in Fig. 1b , these changed lipid features include glycerophospholipid and fatty acids classes, indicating that MERS-CoV infection strongly perturbed lipid homeostasis. To map the landscape of metabolic-transcriptional alterations in the context of virus infection, we performed an integrated transcriptomic and lipidomic analysis to simultaneously map genes and lipid metabolites in different pathways. As shown in Fig. 1c , integrative network modeling specifically revealed that the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway was most dramatically modulated by MERS-CoV infection. Collectively, we demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection triggered marked host lipid metabolic changes. To investigate the importance of lipid metabolites in virus life cycle, we screened a lipid library using MERS-CoV and H1N1 virus infections. Colorimetric assays reflecting cell viability were performed to select compounds that inhibited the cytopathic effects (CPE) that develop upon virus infection (Fig. 1d) . Screening conditions were optimized, in which at 0.1 MOI and 24 h post-MERS-CoV infection and at 0.01 MOI and 48 h post-H1N1 infection were chosen, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1b, c) . A lipid metabolite with anti-inflammatory effects, 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 , protected Huh7 cells against MERS-CoV infection, while the aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist FICZ and apoptosis regulatory messenger C16 Ceramide protected MDCK cells against H1N1 infection. Notably, AM580, a synthetic agonist, exhibited cell protection against both viruses and was selected for further investigations (Fig. 1d) . Interestingly, (R)methandamide, an agonist of cannabinoid receptor that functionally increased lipid accumulation in hepatocytes 17 , facilitated virus replication at non-toxic concentrations, thus caused more severe CPE than that of the virus control. These findings indicated that modulation of host lipid metabolism could significantly change the outcome of virus infection, thus corroborate with our hypothesis of modulating virus-induced lipid reprogramming for therapeutic intervention. Figure 3) . Overall, AM580 showed potent anti-MERS-CoV activity in cell cultures with significant inhibition of virus replication, cell protection, and anti-inflammatory responses. We previously established the human intestinal organoids (intestinoids) as an alternative route of virus transmission for MERS-CoV and an ideal tool for pharmacological evaluation 18 . Herein, we inoculated these intestinoids with 0.1 MOI of MERS-CoV and evaluated the effect of AM580. Our data demonstrated that AM580 treatment significantly (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) reduced MERS-CoV replication intra-and extra-cellularly (Fig. 2f , g). At 48 hpi, no PFU was detectable in AM580-treated intestinoid culture supernatants, representing a nearly 6-log 10 reduction in titers when compared with DMSO-treated controls (Fig. 2f) . The inhibition of MERS-CoV by AM580 was also evidenced by the markedly decreased expression of viral NP in the AM580-treated intestinoids when compared with the DMSOtreated intestinoids (Fig. 2h) . Collectively, we demonstrated that AM580 robustly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in human intestinoids. Our screening of a lipid library demonstrated the broadspectrum antiviral potential of AM580 (Fig. 1d ). Next, we investigated AM580's in vitro antiviral effect against other viruses especially the emerging or respiratory pathogens, including both RNA [SARS-CoV, H1N1 virus, enterovirus-A71 (EV-A71), and Zika virus (ZIKV)] and DNA [human adenovirus type 5 (AdV5)] viruses. Notably, AM580 inhibited the replication of all evaluated viruses at 50% inhibition concentration (IC 50 ) ranging from nanomolar to micromolar scales in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2i) . The selectivity index of AM580 was remarkable for most of the tested viruses, in particular for MERS-CoV (507), SARS-CoV (114), and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (159), suggesting the potential for safe usage of AM580 or its clinically available analogs in therapeutic settings for a broad spectrum of viral pathogens (Supplementary Figure 2c) . AM580 exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral effects in vivo. To evaluate the in vivo antiviral activity of AM580, we first examined whether the drug conferred protection against lethal challenge with MERS-CoV in human DPP4 (hDPP4)-transgenic mice 18 . Previous pharmacokinetics study revealed that AM580 has a relatively large apparent volume of distribution (1.1-1.5/kg) and small clearance (8.8-9.7 ml/min/kg), with pharmacokinetic behavior linear within the dose range from 2 to 10 mg/kg after intraperitoneal injection 19 . Intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation of the maximal amount of AM580 soluble in PBS (12.5 mg/kg) for 7 days resulted in no signs of toxicity (Supplementary Figure 2b) . In mice challenged with 50 PFU of MERS-CoV, all 20/20 mice (100%) survived after they received 3 days of i.p. injection of AM580, whereas 14/20 DMSO-treated mice died (survival rate 30%; Fig. 3a ). Mice in the AM580-treated group exhibited significantly less body weight loss (p < 0.05, Student's t-test) than that of the DMSO-treated group on days 4 and 5 post-infection (Fig. 3b) , and with lower lung tissue virus titers and viral loads (p < 0.01, Student's t-test) at days 2 and 4 ( Fig. 3c ; Supplementary  Figure 7e ). On day 4 post-challenge, the viral RNA load in brain tissues of the AM580-treated mice was undetectable and was 4log 10 lower than that of the DMSO-treated mice (Supplementary Figure 7e) . Histopathologic examination showed that alveolar damage and interstitial inflammatory infiltration in the lung tissues of the AM580-treated mice were substantially diminished compared to the control mice (Fig. 3d) . Collectively, these results demonstrated that AM580 effectively protected hDPP4transgenic mice from lethal MERS-CoV challenge by inhibiting MERS-CoV replication and virus-associated pneumonia and encephalitis in vivo. In parallel, the antiviral effects of AM580 against the highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H7N9) were evaluated in Balb/c mice 20 . In mice challenged with 100 PFU of H7N9, intranasal AM580 treatment resulted in significantly higher survival rates (6/10, 60%; vs 0/10 in DMSO-treated controls, 0%; p < 0.01, log-rank test) (Fig. 3e ). AM580-treated mice showed less body weight loss than that of DMSO-treated group from day 3 to day 7 post-infection (Fig. 3f) . The mean viral RNA load in the lung tissues of AM580-treated mice was significantly (p < 0.01, Student's t-test) lower than that of control mice ( Fig. 3g;  Supplementary Figure 7f ). Histopathological examination Fig. 1 Integrative transcriptomic-lipidomic analysis and lipid screening. Calu-3 cells were mock infected or infected with MERS-CoV at 2 MOI and incubated in DMEM medium. At 24 hpi, cells were harvested for transcriptomic (a) and lipidomic (b) analysis, respectively. a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the MERS-CoV infected and non-infected Calu-3 cells. DEGs were classified under six categories as indicated.

Both enrichment (blue) and topological (yellow) analysis are scored, indicating the glycerophospholipid metabolism as the most affected pathway after MERS-CoV infection. Shown is the normalized result by setting mock-infection as 100%, which is averaged from three independent screenings revealed that AM580 treatment ameliorated virus-associated pulmonary inflammatory infiltration and bronchopneumonia (Fig. 3h) . Taken together, our results demonstrated the in vivo protective effects of AM580 against lethal H7N9 infection. SREBPs are essential for virus replication. The extraordinary potency and broad antiviral spectrum of AM580 hinted that its cellular target should be a vulnerable and upstream effector. Using AM580 as a tool compound, we try to decipher the key Searching of the upstream proteins regulating the host lipogenic pathway showed that SREBPs are the major factors that control lipid biosynthesis through transactivation of genes encoding the lipogenic enzyme 21 . To evaluate the role of SREBPs on MERS-CoV replication, we compared the growth of MERS-CoV in wild-type control cells (mock) and SREBP gene silencing or hyper-expression cells. Notably, transfection of SREBP1-or SREBP2-targeted siRNAs diminished the precursor SREBPs (pre-SREBPs) production, which significantly (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) reduced MERS-CoV replication (Fig. 4c) . Though the expression level of SREBP1 and SREBP2 in double knockdown is not more reduced than that of the individual knockdown because only 50% the amount of siRNA for each SREBP was applied, the double knockdown of both SREBPs resulted in about 2 log 10 (p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA) decrease of infectious virus particle when compared with the 1 log 10 reduction of individual knockdown, which indicated a potential synergistic effects when both activities of SREBP1 and SREBP2 were inhibited. Together, this result indicated that SREBPs were essential for MERS-CoV replication. Transactivation of lipid biosynthesis genes requires cleavage of pre-SREBPs to release their N-terminal nuclear forms (n-SREBPs), a process which is regulated by sterols 22 . Overexpression of either n-SREBP1 or n-SREBP2, however, diminished the antiviral potency of AM580 by about 1.5-log 10 upon MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 4d) . Together, these results indicated a pro-viral role of n-SREBPs in MERS-CoV replication and an inhibitory role of AM580 on n-SREBPs' activity. To further confirm if the functionality of SREBP1 and/or SREBP2 are affected by AM580, reporter gene assays reflecting SREBPs-dependent transcriptional activation were performed. As shown in Fig. 4e , lipogenic enzymes such as HMGCS and FAS were blocked at the transcriptional level. However, the Liver X Receptor response element (LXRE), which is required for the activation of SREBP 23 , was not affected. These results indicated that AM580 might specifically disrupt the transactivation of lipogenic enzymes mediated by n-SREBPs. AM580 blocked n-SREBPs binding to SREs. FAS and HMGCS are two lipogenic enzymes that belong to separate lipid biosynthesis pathways. Inhibition of both genes transactivation, as shown in Fig. 4e , led us to suspect that AM580 functions to interrupt the interaction of n-SREBPs with the SREs that are conserved in lipogenic promoters including FAS, ACC, HMGCS, etc. To this end, SREBP1/2 transcription factor assays were performed, in which specific double stranded DNA (dsDNA) sequences containing the n-SREBP1-or n-SREBP2-binding SREs were immobilized in the solid phase. Binding intensity of nuclearextracted n-SREBP1 or n-SREBP2 was then detected in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Notably, AM580 inhibited the binding of both n-SREBP1 (Fig. 5a) and n-SREBP2 (Supplementary Figure 5a ) with their corresponding SREs, whereas the compounds FICZ and 25-hydroxyvitamin D 3 did not (Supplementary Figure 7m ). To determine whether AM580 targets n-SREBPs or SREs, we pre-incubated AM580 with either immobilized SRE-dsDNA before adding n-SREBPs or with n-SREBPs before binding with SRE-dsDNA. Taking n-SREBP1 as an example, AM580 was found to bind with n-SREBP1 and not SRE-dsDNA, and inhibited the SRE-dsDNA binding activity of n-SREBP1 in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5b) . Next, to determine the interacting residue(s) on n-SREBPs that are responsible for AM580 binding, we first performed molecular docking analysis using the published crystal structures of SREBP1 and SREBP2 (refs. 24, 25 ). The V-shape DNA-binding domain of Black line indicates AM580 was added and incubated in SRE-dsDNA-immobilized wells, washed before addition of n-SREBP1; red line with square indicates AM580 was pre-incubated with n-SREBP1 before adding to SRE-dsDNA-immobilized wells. Students' t-test was done between groups with same concentrations of AM580 but different treatments. The experiments were performed in triplicate and replicated twice. The results are shown as mean ± s. d. **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05. c AM580 was predicted to occupy the SRE-recognition sites of both SREBP1 and 2. Shown is the 3D molecular docking analysis. Potential interaction surfaces on SREBPs (red) are shown, while AM580 (green) is displayed in stick and mesh representation. Partial sequence alignment of the DNA-binding domains of human and mouse SREBP1 and 2 is shown. Tyr335, the key residue for AM580 binding is highlighted with a box. d Structure of an AM580-derived probe (AM580dp) showing the locations of designated groups with specific functionalities. Azido-AM580 was synthesized through the reaction between azido-PEG5-amine and AM580. AM580dp was further synthesized through the addition of tri-functional crosslinker with azido-AM580. e Cellular distribution of azido-AM580. AM580 was used as a negative control due to the lack of phosphine-specific azido group. Scale bar:10 µm. f Tyr335 was critical for AM580 and n-SREBP1 interaction. AM580dp was immobilized on streptavidin beads and incubated with the cell lysate that were transfected with either WT or Y335R mutant constructs. After pull-down, western blot was employed to detect n-SREBP1 using both anti-n-SREBP1 and anti-Flag antibodies. Overexpression of RAR-α protein was used as a positive control for the pull-down capacity of AM580dp, while azido-AM580 was used as a negative control to exclude non-specific binding n-SREBP1 and 2 shows structurally similarity and binds AM580 as a homodimer (Fig. 5c) . Taking n-SREBP1 as an example, AM580 binds to the E-box site through four amino acids (His328, Glu332, Tyr335, and Arg336) that are highly conserved among helix-loop-helix proteins (Supplementary Figure 5b) . The major interaction was predicted to be between AM580 and residue Tyr335 by a hydrogen bond. Importantly, the Tyr335 that determines SRE recognition 24 is completely conserved between human and mouse SREBPs (lower panel, Fig. 5c ), which may explain the conservation of the broad spectrum antiviral property of AM580 in human cells and in mouse models. To explore if AM580 inhibits the DNA-binding activity of SREBPs by physically blocking SRE recognition (i.e. via Tyr335), we introduced an Y335R mutation into n-SREBP1 and compared its AM580 binding capacity with that of the wild-type protein. An AM580-derived probe with biotin and photo-affinity tags (AM580dp) was synthesized to facilitate the evaluation of its binding characteristics. The AM580dp was made by introducing a linker arm containing an azido end to the carboxylic acid group on AM580, yielding the azido-AM580, which was designed for further addition of a tri-functional linker with UV photo-affinity and biotin tags with specific probing functionalities (Fig. 5d) . Like AM580, azido-AM580 inhibited MERS-CoV replication in Huh7 and Vero cells (Supplementary Figure 5c) . Next, using an azidoreactive green fluorescent dye for localization, azido-AM580 was found largely in the host cell nucleus, which corroborated our hypothesis that AM580 may target a lipogenic transactivation event (Fig. 5e ). To capture the binding target, AM580dp was immobilized on streptavidin-conjugated agarose by its biotin group and incubated with transfected cell lysates expressing WT or Y335R n-SREBP1. RAR-α, a known AM580 receptor, was cotransfected as a control. After ultraviolet irradiation to activate the crosslinking photo-affinity tag in AM580dp, the protein-AM580dp complex was fixed and isolated. As shown in Fig. 5f , almost equal amounts of RAR-α were precipitated by AM580dp in both WT or mutant Y335R n-SREBP1 groups, indicating that AM580dp was biologically functional. However, significantly more WT n-SREBP1 was detected than Y335R n-SREBP1, suggesting a stronger binding affinity between AM580 and WT n-SREBP1 than that of Y335R n-SREBP1. In addition, SRE binding activity of n-SREBP1 was significantly (p < 0.01, Student's t-test) diminished when Tyr335 was substituted with arginine, which highlighted the crucial role of Tyr335 in SRE recognition (Supplementary Figure 5d) . Taken together, we concluded that AM580 disrupted n-SREBP1 and SRE binding, specifically via impairing the SRE-recognition functionality of n-SREBP1. Block of SREBPs-dependent pathways reduced viral fitness. Disruption of n-SREBP and SRE interaction leads to failure of lipogenic transactivation. To elucidate these downstream consequences, we investigated one of the SREBP-mediated pathways, fatty acid synthesis. First, we explored the ability of an endproduct of the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, sodium palmitate, to reverse the antiviral activity of AM580. Notably, both C75 (a FAS inhibitor specific for fatty acid biosynthesis pathway) and AM580 showed anti-MERS-CoV activity (Fig. 6a) . Addition of sodium palmitate did not affect the virus yield in MERS-CoV-infected cells treated with DMSO, but increased the virus yield (p < 0.05, one-way ANOVA) in MERS-CoV-infected cells treated with either AM580 or C75 (Fig. 6a) . This finding suggested that MERS-CoV replication hijacked host fatty acid synthesis, which can be inhibited through shut-down of lipogenic transactivation while rescued by exogenous palmitate. Next, we explored whether fatty acid synthesis was critically involved in the replication of other AM580-inhibited viruses. To this end, replication rescue assays using H1N1 (negative-strand RNA virus representative), EV-A71 (non-enveloped RNA virus representative), and AdV5 (DNA virus representative) were performed (Fig. 6b, d) . Indeed, significant (p < 0.05, Student's t-test) extents of rescue were achieved for these viruses and especially H1N1 virus (p < 0.01, Student's t-test) with addition of sodium palmitate. Positive-sense RNA viruses are known to replicate their genomes on intracellular membranes. For MERS-CoV, doublemembrane vesicles (DMVs) provide the anchoring scaffold for viral replication/transcription complexes, which might be disrupted by the blockade of fatty acid synthesis. Using electron microscopy, perinuclear DMV clusters were readily detectable in MERS-CoV-infected cells (left panel, Fig. 6e ). In contrast, almost no DMVs were visualized after treatment by AM580 (right panel, Fig. 6e ). Since co-expression of nsp3 and nsp4 of MERS-CoV was sufficient to induce the DMV formation 26 , we used AM580 to treat the Huh7 cells co-transfected with nsp3 (~209 kDa) and nsp4 (~57 kDa) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 6f , no significant changes were detected in the expression levels of both viral proteins. The finding indicated that the reduced DMV formation was caused by the inhibition of lipogenesis directly and not by the decreased viral replication indirectly. Negative-sense RNA viruses, such as influenza A viruses, utilize a different mechanism of genome replication and transcription that is independent of intracellular replicative organelles. Palmitoylation, a downstream consequence of fatty acid synthesis, is a post-translational modification that modulates protein function and protein localization. In the context of influenza A viruses, the best characterized palmitoylated protein is the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) 27 . Therefore, we explored whether blockade of fatty acid synthesis would impede influenza HA palmitoylation and inhibit H1N1 replication. HAoverexpressed A549 cells were cultured with AM580 or vehicle (DMSO) or the positive control inhibitor 2-BP, which is specific against protein palmitoylation 28 . Palmitoylated HA protein was purified via resin-assisted capture. Strikingly, reduced levels of palmitoylated HA were observed with the addition of 2-BP (56%) and AM580 (69%) when compared with DMSO (100%) controls (Fig. 6f) . Moreover, 2-BP also showed inhibition against MERS-CoV and H1N1 replication in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 4b) . To examine the specificity, oleic acid, a downstream metabolite of palmitate was also used in the complementation assays. The result showed that additional oleic acid (100 µM) could not rescue the influenza A H1N1 virus replication but indeed complement the viral growth of MERS-CoV, ZIKV, and AdV5 (Fig. 6a, c, d) . This finding suggested that the palmitoylation of the viral HA was the main target of influenza A H1N1 virus inhibition by AM580. Overall, using DMV formation and viral protein palmitoylation as two important downstream consequences of SREBPs-dependent pathways, we demonstrated that the suppression of SREBPsdependent lipogenic transactivation reduced viral propagation fitness by intervening the downstream fatty acid biosynthetic pathway.
