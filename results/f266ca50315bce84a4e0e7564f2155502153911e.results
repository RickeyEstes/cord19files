The results showed significant contamination at all distances sampled when high-speed instruments were used. The mean density of aerobic oral bacteria was 823 CFU/m 2 /h at <1 m distance from the patient. At distances > 1.5 m, the density was 1120 CFU/m 2 /h. The increase in the contamination density with respect to distance from the patient was not statistically significant (P > 0.5). Figure 2 shows the results of the bacterial fallout collection during restorative dental treatment. Gram-positive cocci, namely viridans streptococci and staphylococci, were the most common findings. Contamination was less intense during periodontal and orthodontic treatment (mean 598 CFU/m 2 /h) where high-speed rotating and ultrasonic instruments were not used, as shown in Figure 3 . Gram-positive cocci were also predominant in these samples. The difference in the contamination level between the rooms where high-speed instruments were used and the rooms where they were not used was statistically significant (P Â¼ 0.001). Contamination was practically non-existent (mean 35 CFU/m 2 /h) in rooms at rest. The facial masks became equally contaminated during the use of high-speed rotating instruments. Figure 3 gives the results of bacterial counts from the facial masks of two dentists and two dental nurses after a 40-min treatment session where high-speed rotating instruments were used. A notable difference was found in the facial contamination between the two teams. Using surface sampling, high counts of Gram-positive cocci were detected on various surfaces before disinfection, but the samples were predominantly negative after disinfecting the working area in preparation for the next patient.
