Mouse cells transfected with the hAPN transgene construct were permissive to HCoV-229E and produced infectious virus The transgene construct and a plasmid that encodes a neomycin resistance (Neo) gene driven by the SV40 promoter were co-transfected into mouse CMT93 cells to show that hAPN protein was produced from the transgene and that it functioned as a receptor for HCoV-229E. FACS analysis with anti-hAPN MAb-WM15 showed that 29% of the G418 resistant co-transfected cell population expressed hAPN on the cell surface, whereas the control cells transfected with Neo vector alone did not show any reactivity to the anti hAPN MAb (data not shown). Control cells and the hAPN co-transfected cells were inoculated with HCoV-229E and the titer of released virus (Control-S and hAPN-S) or the total cell associated plus released virus (Control-T and hAPN-T) was determined at various times post-inoculation by plaque assay (Fig. 2) . The data show that HCoV-229E entered, replicated, and infectious virus was efficiently released from mouse cells expressing hAPN protein (Fig. 2) . The hAPN transgene construct/Neo cotransfected cells were also sorted for hAPN expression by FACS, and 88% were positive for cell surface expression post-sort (data not shown). Transfected cells sorted by hAPN expression were inoculated with a low MOI (0.001) and the supernatants were harvested over 72 h (Fig. 2 , hAPN sorted, solid squares). These data show that HCoV-229E completed multiple rounds of replication in mouse cells that expressed hAPN. Cell lines were generated from the hAPN-positive population and analyzed for reactivity with a panel of anti-hAPN MAbs (WM15, WM47, MY7, DW1, Y2K, and BB1) that bind to multiple epitopes (Ashmun et al., 1995) . MAb-DW1, -Y2K, and -BB1 are new anti-hAPN receptor MAbs and inhibit virus infection. FACS analysis of the hAPN-positive cell lines showed they reacted similarly with all six of the anti-hAPN MAbs, indicating proper surface conformation of hAPN on the mouse CMT93 cells (data not shown). hAPN mRNA was expressed in a tissue-specific manner by the transgene construct The proximal hAPN promoter used in the transgene was expected to be very active in the epithelial cells of the respiratory and enteric tracts and in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney. Progeny mice from 8 founder animals were initially screened by a hAPN-specific RT-PCR assay designed to amplify only polyadenylated RNA from total RNA isolated from the small intestine. One of these lines expressed higher levels of hAPN mRNA and was used for subsequent studies (data not shown). Total RNA was isolated from the kidney (K), small intestine (SI), lung (L), spleen (S), liver (Li) , muscle (M), and heart (H) of nontransgenic and hAPN-transgenic mice. The hAPN transcript was identified by a 712-bp amplicon visible by ethidium bromide staining in the kidney, small intestine, and liver of the transgenic mice and it was not amplified from the RNA of the non-transgenic animal tissues (Fig. 3, RT) . The hAPN transcript amplicon was shown to be specific by Southern blot using a 32 P labeled RNA probe complementary to the 3V terminus of hAPN and part of the SV40 3VUTR that is specific to the transgene (data not shown). This assay demonstrated that the 712-bp amplicons visible by ethidium bromide staining and a band amplified from the lung RNA of the hAPN-transgenic mouse were specific to hAPN mRNA transcription (data not shown). The smaller amplicons observed in the lung, brain, and liver of both the nontransgenic and the hAPN-transgenic mice did not hybridize with the hAPN-specific probe and therefore were nonspecific amplification products (data not shown). When the sensitivity of hAPN mRNA detection was increased using hemi-nested PCR that maintained the specificity for a polyadenylated hAPN transcript, a 439-bp amplicon was identified in every tissue tested in the transgenic mice ( Fig.  3, HN) . The data showed that hAPN mRNA was expressed at qualitatively higher levels in the kidney, small intestine, liver, and to a lesser extent in the lung, which was identified by Southern blot. This expression pattern corresponded to the tissue-specific expression pattern found in previous transcriptional analysis of the proximal hAPN promoter (Shapiro et al., 1991) . Human APN protein was expressed with the same cellular distribution as mouse APN in the small intestine and the kidney To identify expression of hAPN and mouse APN (mAPN) proteins in the small intestine and kidney of Fig. 3 . The hAPN-transgenic mice express hAPN mRNA with a tissue-specific distribution. Total RNA was isolated from the kidney (K), small intestine (Si), lung (L), spleen (S), brain (B), liver (Li) , muscle (M), and heart (H) of non-transgenic and hAPN-transgenic mice. Amplicons from an RT-PCR reaction that used a forward primer specific for hAPN (hAPN-2880) and a tailed oligo dT reverse primer specific for the poly-A tail (oligodT/Xho1) were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide (RT). The expected size of the RT-PCR amplicons was 712 bp and molecular weight markers, 100-bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen), were run in the first and last lanes. Hemi-nested (HN) PCR of an aliquot of the hAPN RT-PCR reaction was also preformed using an internal hAPN forward primer and the same reverse primer used for the RT-PCR reaction. This HN-PCR reaction increases the sensitivity and specificity of the assay and produces a 439-bp DNA fragment when hAPN transgene mRNA is present. hAPN-transgenic and non-transgenic mice, we used immunocytochemistry with a biotinylated MAb-DW1 or a rat MAb-R3-242 against mAPN. These were detected by either streptavidin-HRP or a biotinylated rabbit anti-rat followed by streptavidin-HRP, respectively. The Vector Red substrate used stained regions bound by antibodies red and was also fluorescent. The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The data showed the cell type distribution expected for mAPN in the epithelial cells of the brush border along the villi of the small intestine and by cells of the proximal convoluted tubule in the kidney (Fig. 4, anti-mAPN) . Both the non-transgenic and the hAPN-transgenic mice showed similar mAPN protein distribution patterns, demonstrating that expression of the hAPN protein in the transgenic animals did not dramatically influence the level of mAPN expressed. Human APN protein was expressed in the small intestine and kidney of the transgenic mice in the same manner as mAPN (Fig. 4, . The hAPN protein was expressed on the brush border membrane by epithelial cells on the intestinal villi and by cells in the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney (Fig. 4 , anti-hAPN). MAb-DW1 binding suggests that hAPN expressed in the mouse tissues was in the proper conformation for interaction with HCoV-229E. The hAPN protein was expressed similarly in homozygous female, heterozygous female, and hemizygous male transgenic mice The hAPN expression corresponded with a transgene cassette that was inserted into the X chromosome of this transgenic line. The APN expression in the various genotypes was determined using cryosections of the small intestine from non-transgenic (XX, XY) and hAPN homozygous (X h X h ), heterozygous (X h X), and hemizygous (X h Y) transgenic mice. The same expression pattern of both hAPN and mAPN proteins was detected in the brush border membrane of the small intestine (Fig. 5A ). Fluorescent Vector red staining of mAPN was observed in all mice, and hAPN protein was detected only in transgenic mice (Fig. 5A ).
