TLR9 triggering alters gene expression and activates Akata cells in a MyD88-dependent manner. CpG ODNs activate B cells by impacting on gene expression. 21 We asked how the gene expression pattern of BL cells is affected by TLR9 triggering using CpG ODN. We performed a microarray analysis comparing ODN CpG-2006-treated versus untreated Akata cells. Most of the Z2-fold changes in gene expression were upregulation and only few downregulation. Among upregulated genes, we were mainly interested in those involved in cytokine (human interleukin 10; hIL-10) and chemokine expression (CXCL10), B-cell activation (CD40), transcription (NF-kB) and apoptosis (FAS) as these genes are those that preferentially determine cell proliferation and survival (Supplementary Table 1) . Thirteen genes, including two regulating cell cycle, one transcription factor, one involved in B-cell differentiation and apoptosis, four of diverse functions and four of unknown function, showed downregulation following ODN CpG-2006 treatment (Supplementary Table 2 ). We earlier confirmed that TLR9 triggering of Akata cells with ODN CpG-2006 increases hIL-10 expression and leads to the translocation of NF-kB to the nucleus. 16 To validate a marker for B-cell activation, in this context, we measured CD40 expression by flow cytometry. CD40 expression was increased upon ODN CpG-2006 treatment (Figure 1a ). After 48 h, CD40 expression on ODN CpG-2006-treated cells was increased 2.7-fold compared with untreated cells (Figures 1a  and b) . Surprisingly, the control ODN GpC-2006, which is similar to ODN CpG-2006 but lacks the CpG motifs, also led to a 2.4-fold increase in CD40 expression (Figures 1a and b) . This might reflect a TLR9-independent mechanism or the ability of the control ODN to stimulate TLR9 in BL cells. To clarify this point, we used Akata cells overexpressing a dominant-negative mutant of the adaptor protein MyD88 (DN-MyD88). 16 Table 1 ) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and confirmed activation of STAT3 by western blot (data not shown). Collectively, we validated our microarray data showing that triggering with ODN CpG-2006 activates Akata cells to induce CD40 and STAT3 expression. Moreover, our results indicated that both ODNs used here act in a MyD88dependent manner and that the ODN lacking CpG motifs activates Akata cells to a similar extent as the ODN containing CpG motifs.
