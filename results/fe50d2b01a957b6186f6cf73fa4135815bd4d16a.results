Four hospitals no longer had major EDs. We obtained complete data from 203 (79%) of the remaining 257 hospitals approached. Only 49 (24%) of these hospitals had isolation facilities available in the ED. Of these 49 EDs 37 (76%) had one isolation room available, seven (14%) had two isolation rooms available, four (8%) had three isolation rooms available and one (2%) had six isolation rooms available. Thirty (61%) reported an independent ventilation system and 18 (37%) reported a separate access from outside the ED. The majority of EDs would isolate patients with potential infectious diseases, however, 47 (23%) would not isolate patients with suspected chickenpox, 37 (18%) EDS would not isolate patients with suspected pulmonary TB, 12 (6%) EDS would not isolate patients with suspected SARS and 55 (27%) EDS would not isolate patients with other suspicious infections. Results for approximately how many cases of suspected chickenpox, pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and SARS were seen in EDs in the past year were generally not available and consequently are not reported. Table 1 shows the facilities and procedures in UK EDs for the management of infectious diseases patients.
