Codon adaptation index (CAI) limits for human coronaviruses and DCAI for HCoV-OC43 and BCoV CAI upper and lower limits for the seven human coronaviruses included in this study in human respiratory and enteric tracts were 0.244-0.611 (corresponding to HCoV-SARS nsp11 and nsp10, respectively) and 0.244-0.472 (corresponding to HCoV-SARS ORF7b and nsp11, respectively). BrandÃ£o 693 CAI optimization (DCAI>1) was found for nsp2-5, nsp8, nsp11, nsp15, ns2, HE, S, M, I and N and nsp2, nsp4-6, nsp11, nsp14, nsp16, ns2, M and N proteins on the enteric and respiratory tracts, respectively. Deoptimization (DCAI<1) was found nsp1, nsp6, nsp9-10, nsp12-14, nsp16 and E and nsp1, nsp3, nsp8-10, nsp12-13, HE, S, E and I proteins for the enteric and respiratory tracts, respectively. A DCAI=0 was found for nsp7 on both respiratory and enteric human tracts and for nsp15 on the respiratory tract. DCAI values for each coding region/mRNA of HCoV-OC43 on the human enteric and respiratory tracts are represented in Figure 1 . For both BCoV and HCoV-OC43 nsp7, the lowest CAI distance (-0.039) was found for both the human and respiratory and enteric tracts regarding the lower CAI limit calculated for all seven human coronaviruses, while the highest CAI distances for the lower human coronaviruses CAI was found for BCoV and HCoV-OC43 N for both the human and respiratory and enteric tracts (-0.282 and -0.302, respectively) and BCoV nsp15 (-0,282) for the human respiratory tract. Correlation analysis of DCAI and nucleotide identities amongst the 23 BCoV and HCoV-OC43 homologous coding regions/ mRNAs based on 1st, 2nd and 3rd and on the 3rd nucleotide position only showed the highest r 2 (correlation coefficient) value (0.27) for the 3rd nucleotide position regarding the human respiratory tract, while r 2 values for DCAI and 1st, 2nd and 3rd regarding the human enteric and respiratory tracts were both 0.05 and, regarding the 3rd positions only and the human enteric tract, 0.07.
