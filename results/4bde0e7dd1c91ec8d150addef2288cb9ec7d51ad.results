Eleven hundred fifty-two participants completed the survey, 280 of whom were currently using EHFRs. The majority of participants in each group were women. Current EHFR users differed from current N95-FFR users and PAPR users by several demographic and occupational characteristics as shown in Table 1 . When asked, "With regard to comfort, how much do you like your respirator?" most responses were neutral to favorable (Fig 1 Panel a) . N95-FFR users rated their respirators significantly more favorably than did either EHFR (P < .001) or PAPR users (P < .001) ( Table 2) . Similarly, when asked "With regard to communication, how much do you like your respirator?" N95-FFR users again rated their respirators more favorably in comparison to EHFRs (P < .001) or PAPRs (P < .001), which were both rated similarly in the neutral to negative categories (Fig 1 Panel b and Table 2 ). In contrast, when participants were asked "How well do you think your respirator protects you?" EHFR users rated their respirators most favorably (Fig 1 Panel c and Table 2 ). Both EHFR (P < .001) and PAPR users (P = .012) rated their respirators significantly more favorably than did N95-FFR users. EHFR users were more confident that their respirator would protect them based on their fit testing or training in contrast to either N95-FFR users (P = .003), who would require similar fit testing, or in comparison to PAPR users (P = .005), who still require training despite not needing to undergo fit testing (Fig 1 Panel  d and Table 2 ). Multivariable analysis, including adjustment for frequency of fit testing or training, did not decrease the significance level of these comparisons. To understand respirator preference and the impact of escalated threat levels on preference, users were asked to select their preferred respirator given 3 choices (EHFR, N95-FFR, or PAPR). First, the question, "What respirator would you prefer to wear under usual circumstances, such as caring for a patient who is being ruled-out for TB?" was asked. The risk scenario was then escalated to caring for a patient with known, active TB and finally to a setting of pandemic H1N1 or SARS. The majority of each user group preferred to stay with their current respirator type under usual circumstances ( Table 3) . As risk increased to exposure to active TB, however, the percentage staying with or switching to EHFR or PAPR increased in each user group. When exposure was to pandemic H1N1 or SARS, the propensity to stay with or switch to EHFR was not as strong as with exposure to active TB, but propensity to prefer PAPR was higher. For all user groups, reusable respirators were significantly more likely to be preferred over N95-FFRs in higher risk scenarios compared to usual circumstance scenarios (Table 4 ). Adjustment for covariates increased the odds of preferring either EHFR or PAPR compared to N95-FFR in all user groups and in each threat scenario compared to usual circumstances. To understand whether EHFR and PAPR users perceived their susceptibility differently than N95-FFR users, we asked participants how likely they believed they would be to contract various communicable diseases from caring for an infected patient while not wearing a respirator. Whereas most respondents reported their belief that it would be likely or very likely that they would contract TB, H1N1, SARS, or Ebola, there were no significant differences in the frequency of reporting of the different responses among the user groups (data not shown). EHFR, elastomeric half-face respirator; N95-FFR, N95 filtering facepiece respirator; PAPR, powered air-purifying respirator. *Significance level unchanged after adjustment for sex, race, education level, employer, assigned respirator, respirator status prior to 2009 H1N1 pandemic, unit setting, supervisor status, frequency of use, frequency of training, years in health care. y 1 = "very much dislike," 2 = "dislike," 3 = "neither like nor dislike," 4 = "like," and 5 = "very much like." z 1 = "not well at all," 2 = "somewhat," 3 = "not sure," 4 = "well," and 5 = "very well." x 1 = "strongly disagree," 2 = "disagree," 3 = "neither agree nor disagree," 4 = "agree," and 5 = "strongly agree."
