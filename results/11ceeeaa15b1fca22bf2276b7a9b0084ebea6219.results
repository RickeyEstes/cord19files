The microwave radar output through the high-pass filter shows a cyclic oscillation, which corresponds to the cardiac oscillation ( Fig. l(b) upper) . The peaks of the oscillation were delayed by approximately 200 ms relative to the Rwave of the ECG ( Fig. 1 (b) lower) . This time delay can be attributed to the delay caused by the phase shifter of the microwave radar. The RR intervals derived from the ECG and that derived by the non-contact apparatus are shown in Fig. 2(a) . They show similar fluctuations, the RR intervals derived by the non-contact apparatus significantly correlated with the RR intervals from the ECG (r = 0.98, P < 0001, Fig. 2(b) ). The power spectrum of the RR intervals derived by the non-contact apparatus has a similar power spectrum (Fig. 2(c) ) to that of the RR intervals from the ECG (Fig. 2(d) ).
