With one exception, all rtRT-PCR-confirmed CHIKV infections in our student cohort occurred in the 9-week period between May 23 and July 25, 2014; the one "outlier" case occurred in mid-August, 2014. Among the 100 plasma specimens taken from febrile schoolchildren in the May-August time period, 82 tested positive via rtRT-PCR for CHIKV, but were negative for DENV1-4 and ZIKV. Among the 18 specimens from febrile schoolchildren during this time period that were not positive for CHIKV, two gave equivocal results in the rtRT-PCR assay and were excluded from the analysis, two were DENV type 1 positive, and 14 were negative in all assays. Cultures were not performed on these 18 specimens due to insufficient specimen volume, reflecting the large number of assays that had been conducted in the initial screening of what were relatively small blood samples from each child. The mean age of children from whom specimens were collected was 9.6 years. Ninety-two of the 100 specimens were from students at Campus A of the school; 7 were from Campus B, and one was from Campus C. Gender, average age, and school level for the 82 children whose samples were positive for CHIKV by rtRT-PCR are included in Table 1 .
