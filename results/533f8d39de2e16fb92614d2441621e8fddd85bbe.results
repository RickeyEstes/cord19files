ROC curves were compared for AKI diagnosis in all 167 patients (Fig. 1) . PENK (AUC, 0.725) and the four eGFR equations (AUC, 0.757, 0.761, 0.712, and 0.743, respectively) showed fair discriminatory ability, but NGAL demonstrated poor discriminatory ability (AUC, 0.675). However, PENK, NGAL, and the four eGFR equations were all comparable, showing no statistical difference. A more refined analysis based on nested logistic regression models showed that PENK was superior to NGAL (P = 0.022), but inferior to the eGFR equations based on MDRD, Cr, and Cr-CysC (P < 0.05). PENK exhibited no statistical superiority over eGFR based on CysC (P = 0.473). NGAL was inferior to all eGFR equations (all P < 0.05). The optimal cut-off value for AKI diagnosis was 154.5 pmol/L for PENK and 493 ng/mL for NGAL and ranged from 28.3 to 36.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for the eGFR equations. With regard to RRT, both PENK and NGAL concentrations were significantly higher in patients with RRT than in patients without RRT (PENK, 421.9 vs 82.5 pmol/L, P < 0.0001; NGAL, 1,270.0 vs 375.0 ng/mL, P = 0.0001). Based on ROC curve analysis, PENK showed good performance and NGAL showed fair performance to predict RRT (AUC, 0.872 vs 0.741, P = 0.0085). The distribution of GFR categories varied across each eGFR equation (Fig. 2) . The proportion of reduced GFR ( < 60 mL/min/ 1.73 m 2 ) was the highest based on the CKD-EPICysC equation and the lowest based on the CKD-EPICr equation, showing a significant difference (58.7% vs 44.9%, P < 0.0001, Chi-square test). Of note, each pair of eGFR equations showed minimal to weak The distribution of PENK and NGAL concentrations differed significantly according to GFR category (all P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3) . Both PENK and NGAL concentrations increased significantly according to GFR category based on the MDRD Study and CKD-EPI equations (P < 0.0001). In normal GFR ( â‰¥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) categories, PENK concentration was below the 154.5 pmol/L cut-off obtained by ROC curve analysis and was also lower than or similar to the 99th percentile of the normal range (80 pmol/L). NGAL concentration was also below the 493 ng/mL cut-off obtained by ROC curve analysis; however, it was higher than the literature-and manufacturer-recommended 150 ng/mL cut-off. In terms of 30-day mortality, except for NGAL, PENK concentration and eGFRs showed significant differences between survivors and non-survivors based on all four equations (all P <0.005) ( Table 3) . Based on survival analysis using two different cut-offs (optimal ROC curve analysis cut-off and literature-and/or manufacturer-recommended cut-off), PENK and the eGFR equations all showed significant differences between the two groups (favorable vs unfavorable). However, no significant difference was observed for NGAL, regardless of cut-off. PENK showed the highest HR with the 80 pmol/L cut-off value (HR = 7.9, P < 0.0001).
