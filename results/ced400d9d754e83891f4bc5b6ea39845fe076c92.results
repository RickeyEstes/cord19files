Detection and characterization of pathogens. (i) DNA pathogen detection. Ten (of 16) DNA samples were known to have one or more target pathogens based on previous diagnostic assays (16 total pathogens) ( Table 1 , asterisks). At least one previously identified pathogen was detected in nine of these samples. All target pathogen taxa were detected except puma lentivirus clade A (PLVA), which was not sequenced in any of the three samples in which it was detected via nested PCR (estimated to represent less than 100 viral copies per one million cells, or 3.3 ϫ 10 Ϫ9 pathogen nucleotides/host nucleotide). Nine pathogens were detected that had not been detected prior to this study despite analysis by standard laboratory methods. The presence of all newly detected pathogens was reconfirmed by additional PCR analysis of the original samples. The breadth of coverage (percentage of each targeted genome region that was covered by sequencing reads) varied from 0 to 100%, with an average breadth of 84% among the 22 pathogens detected (Table 1) . No reads could be confidently classified as belonging to novel feline pathogens. (ii) RNA pathogen detection. Eleven of the 12 RNA samples sequenced had at least one target pathogen based on previous diagnostic assays (Table 2) . Nine samples (including one negative control) were enriched according to the standard SureSelect protocol using the custom RNA probe library. One sample was enriched using half the recommended concentration of probes, and two were sequenced without enrichment (see Materials and Methods). Seven of 11 pathogens previously detected were sequenced, including four of four samples with previous detection of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and three of three samples containing feline coronavirus (FeCoV), including the sample (sample 21a) subjected to half the concentration of TGC probes as other samples. Feline foamy virus (FFV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) were partially sequenced in a sample in which these pathogens had not been previously detected. Four pathogens that had been detected by serologic methods were not detected by TGC. This included three feline calicivirus (FCV) isolates and one feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) isolate. The FCV and FHV-1 isolates were originally diagnosed via quantitative PCR (qPCR) using oronasal swab samples. Of the pathogens detected by the RNA assay, the breadth of coverage ranged from 20% to 100%, with a mean of 58.3% ( Table 2 ). The depth of sequencing also varied greatly from a low of 30 reads/base for FFV (sample 24) to a high of 295,367 reads/base for FIV (sample 17). Neither of the pathogens in the two unenriched samples (FIV in sample 18a and FeCoV in sample 21b) were detected by NGS, although both of these pathogens were characterized in their paired, enriched RNA samples. DNA enrichment and sequencing. All 12 DNA samples in experiment 1 demonstrated a relative decrease of host GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene copies (Fig. 1A , samples 1 through 16). Depletion of host DNA averaged 74-fold in DNA libraries relative to original DNA samples (range, 3.2-fold to 1,600-fold decrease). Conversely, all 13 pathogens evaluated pre-and post-TGC by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) demonstrated relative increases in copy number, averaging 386-fold postcapture enrichment (range, 20-fold to 50,000-fold increase). The overall enrichment of pathogen DNA relative to host DNA averaged 14,000-fold (range, 970-fold to 2.8 million-fold relative increase in abundance) (Fig. 1B) . The number of NGS reads per sample ranged from 0.64 to 3.1 million (median, 0.79 million) ( Table 1) . Two samples (samples 8 and 9) accounted for 35% of the total NGS reads generated for the 16 pooled DNA samples. These samples contained DNA extracted from high-titer in vitro cultures of feline herpesvirus and had the lowest percentage of reads map to the cat genome (3% and 1%, respectively). For all other DNA samples, the majority of NGS reads (51% to 82%) mapped to the cat genome. Each sample contained sequences that did not map to either the cat genome or the target pathogen reference sequences representing 20 to 46% of the total reads. We postulate that most of the unmapped reads correspond to feline genomic sequences that did not map to the cat genome reference sequence, which remains incompletely annotated. RNA enrichment and sequencing. GAPDH RNA was decreased in postcapture libraries relative to that in original samples in six of the nine enriched RNA samples evaluated (Fig. 1A , samples 17 through 25). The average depletion of host RNA (cDNA) was 128-fold (range, 6.3-fold increase to 63,000-fold decrease). Three enriched samples had similar or slightly increased levels of GAPDH RNA postcapture. The average difference in postcapture target pathogen cDNA relative to the original samples was 1,000-fold for enriched samples (range, 158-fold to 12,500-fold increase). The overall abundance of pathogen cDNA relative to host cDNA increased by an average of 107,000-fold in postcapture samples (range, 58-fold to 56 million-fold) (Fig. 1B) . Interestingly, FeCoV in sample 21a, which was enriched using only half of the recommended concentration of baits, had values for the depletion of host cDNA and enrichment of pathogen cDNA similar to those of sample 21, which used the full concentration of baits during the hybridization (capture) step in the protocol (Fig. 1A) . The two unenriched samples (18a and 21b) were the only samples evaluated by RT-PCR that did not have a relative increase in abundance of pathogen cDNA relative to the host (Fig. 1B) . The number of reads per RNA sample ranged from 2.7 million to 85.1 million (median, 24.5 million) ( Table 3) . Of these, the proportion of reads for each sample that mapped to the cat genome ranged from 0.7% to 65.3% (median, 41.8%). The proportion of reads that mapped to the pathogen reference sequences ranged from less than 0.1% to 96.3% (median, 1.0%). The proportion of reads that did not map to the cat genome or the target pathogen sequences accounted for 3% to 98.9% of the sample reads (median, 43.6%). FIV enrichment quantification in experimental samples. The log copy numbers of FIV and GAPDH copies remained relatively unchanged throughout the course of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology preenrichment library preparation steps, with FIV copies present at a level approximately 3-log fold lower than that of GAPDH copies (mean FIV copy number ϭ 3.54, SD ϭ 0.60; mean GAPDH copy number ϭ 6.77, SD ϭ 0.46) (Fig. 2) . However, the enrichment and subsequent PCR resulted in an increase of FIV copies and a decrease of GAPDH copies in each sample. The average enrichment of FIV relative to GAPDH was 147,000-fold. PLVB was originally detected at a very low copy number (100 copies per million cells) by qPCR but was not detected in any of the final enriched samples. FIV probes included in a second set of DNA probes (DNAv2) included sequences that shared 63% pairwise identity to PLV proviral genomic regions present in extracted tissues (alignment available upon request).
