During the study period 1 July 1997 to 31 March 2011, there were 1,312,424 admissions to the paediatric medical wards of Hong Kong's HA hospitals. Three had no gender specified and 118 had missing age data and were excluded. Of the 1,312,303 admissions with valid data, 95.1% (1,248,297) were below 18 years of age and 62.8% (824,514) were below 5 years of age. 1.6% (13,147/824,514) had "any" CMS diagnosis of rotavirus. Gastroenteritis-associated disorders were coded as the primary diagnosis in 9.8% (81,111) and 8.4% (104,527) of admissions of children aged below 5 and 18 years respectively, and as the primary or as one of any 9 secondary diagnoses in 11.8% (97,211) and 10.0% (124,728) respectively (Appendix 4). The rates of gastroenteritis-associated admissions varied considerably between the 12 HA hospitals providing general paediatric services, in both children aged below 5 and 18 years old (Appendix 5). Likewise the proportion of hospitalisations aged below 5 and 18 years of age with "any" diagnosis of rotavirus ranged from 0.1% to 2.8% and 0.1% to 2.0% respectively between these hospitals (Appendix 5). The total number of admissions to all HA hospitals with any CMS rotavirus diagnosis was highest during the first year of life (Appendix 6). Peaks of rotavirus admissions in Hong Kong were from November to March as previously noted [3] , and the 2008/9 rotavirus season had the greatest total number of CMS rotavirus positive admissions (Appendix 7). After linking the CMS data to the sentinel laboratory surveillance at PWH, there were 100,330 children below 18 years of age and 65,297 below 5 years of age admitted during the period 1 July 2000 to 31 March 2011 (Table 1) . Rotavirus testing was requested for 8.7% (8705/100,330) of all the admissions below 18 years of age during this period and for 59.9% (5150/8595) of all patients with a primary diagnosis of gastroenteritis. Similarly, for the patients below 5 years of age there were 68.7% (4385/6381) with a primary CMS gastroenteritis diagnosis who had a stool specimen collected. In children below 5 years of age, the rotavirus positive rate for tested specimens was 23.4% (1710/7314), ranging from 13.0% to 33.8% during the 11 year period (Appendix 8). There were 1085 children below 5 years of age with "any" diagnosis coded as rotavirus (Table 1) . Adjustment factor 1 was not age related (Appendix 3) and a mean value of 1.59 was used for all age groups below 5 years of age. However adjustment factor 2 and adjustment factor 3 varied with age so a smoothed value was used for each age group below 5 years of age (Appendix 3). 1.7% of all admissions below 5 years of age had a CMS rotavirus diagnosis. Applying adjustment factor 1 (1.59) would increase this proportion to 2.7%. The proportion of all admissions at PWH due to rotavirus (adjustment factor 3) peaked between about 12-18 months (Appendix 3). Overall 2.4% of admissions to PWH below 2 years and 2.6% below 5 years of age had laboratory confirmation of rotavirus (Table 1 and Appendix 8). The proportion of all admissions that had laboratory confirmed rotavirus also varied by year of admission (Appendix 8). The incidence rates of hospitalisation for rotavirus per 100,000 person-years were lowest in the first two months of life, then peaked between 7 and 8 months, and then declined from about 18 to 24 months (Fig. 1) . Similar patterns were observed over all 14 rotavirus seasons of the study. The unadjusted incidence rates per 100,000 person-years based on any CMS rotavirus diagnosis (ICD = 008.61) were: 249 (0 to <1m); 612 (1 to <2m); 1066 (2 to <6m); 1383 (6 to <11m); 959 (1 to <2y); 406 (2 to <3y); 233 (3 to <4y); 124 (4 to <5y) ( Table 2 ). Overall the incidence was 1071 in children below 2 years old and 542 in children below 5 years of age. Adjusted incidence rates were generally higher than the unadjusted rates (Table 2, Fig. 1 ). In the older age groups the effect of adjustment factor 3 was less i.e. this factor assumes that the proportion of rotavirus positive admissions as a proportion of all admissions by age group were the same in all HA hospitals as they were in PWH. Incidence rates of both unadjusted CMS rotavirus diagnosis (p = 0.001, standardised coefficient = 0.778) and adjusted rotavirus diagnosis (adjustment factor 1, p = 0.001, standardised coefficient = 0.778; adjustment factor 2, p = 0.001, standardised coefficient = 0.778; adjustment factor 3, p < 0.0001, standardised coefficient = 0.959) trended up over the 14 rotavirus seasons (Fig. 2) . Although there was a similar upward trend for the incidence of all-cause gastroenteritis based on primary CMS diagnosis alone (p = 0.046, standardised coefficient = 0.540), this was less marked than that seen for rotavirus (Fig. 2) . The length of stay (LOS, date of discharge minus date of admission plus one) is one measure of severity of illness. The median LOS for rotavirus diarrhoea (4 days) was longer than that of other viral gastroenteritis (3 days) for children aged both below 5 years and below 18 years of age (Appendix 9). The LOS in rotavirus was similar to that of bacterial and parasitic gastroenteritis. In PWH, there were two deaths in children below 18 years old during the period July 2000 to March 2011. Both children were over 5 years old and were coded respectively as gastroenteritis of presumed infectious and non-infectious diarrhoea and vomiting and gastritis. No patient coded as rotavirus gastroenteritis died. Most of the patients were discharged without follow up, and 13.5% of the patients coded as rotavirus gastroenteritis below 5 years of age had a follow-up visit scheduled after discharge. This proportion was similar to that of patients with other viral and non-specific gastroenteritis but less than that for patients with bacterial and parasitic gastroenteritis (Appendix 9). Similar patterns were seen for all patients admitted to other HA hospitals, although the proportions of patients with follow-up was greater. There were 5 deaths in all HA hospitals coded as a gastroenteritis-related illness, and three of these were below 5 years of age.
