Of the three viral metagenomic datasets inspected, only the pangolin dataset contained coronavirus genomes sharing significant homology with the outbreak strain. Two samples in this dataset yielded two partial coronavirus genomes that overlapped >8.4kb at >99% nucleotide identity with each other. After merging, the final Pangolin-CoV draft genome was 90.5% similar to nCoV-2019 (median nucleotide identity). Figure 1 shows the sequence homology of Pangolin-CoV, RaTG13-CoV and Bat-CoV relative to nCoV-2019 ( Figure 1A shows the homology across the entire genome length). The multiple alignments across the RBM segments revealed an 89% nucleotide ( Figure 1B ) and 98% amino acid identity ( Figure 1C ) of the Pangolin-CoV compared to nCoV-2019. The sequence homology plots showed that the Pangolin-CoV was more similar to nCoV-2019 at the RBD region than the RaTG13-CoV and Bat-CoV ( Figure 1B) . The multiple alignment comparing the PRRA insertion region at the S1/S2 junction shows the insertion present in nCoV-2019 and missing in the other three CoV genomes ( Figure 2 ).
