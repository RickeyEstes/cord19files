Generation of rNDVs expressing S1, S2 or S protein of IBV. The expression cassettes containing the codon optimized S1, S2, S and non-codon optimized S genes of IBV were cloned into the cDNA encoding the complete antigenome of NDV strain LaSota, using the PmeI site, between P and M genes (Fig. 1) . The correct sequences of genes cloned into full length cDNA of NDV were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Infectious recombinant NDVs containing S1, S2 and S genes of IBV were recovered from all cDNAs. The sequences of S1, S2 and S genes present in the rNDVs were confirmed by RT-PCR. To evaluate genetic stability of rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein, the viruses were passaged five times in 9-day-old embryonated specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken eggs. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the S gene showed that the inserted ORF were maintained without any adventitious mutations. Evaluation of the expression of the S1, S2 and S proteins of IBV. The expression of codon optimized S2, and S proteins and non-codon optimized S protein of IBV strain Mass-41 by rNDV constructs was detected by Western blot analysis in DF-1 cells using a chicken polyclonal anti IBV serum ( Fig. 2A -upper panel and B). As the expression of non-codon optimized S was not detected clearly in the first attempt ( Fig. 2A) , we detected it in another attempt (Fig. 2B) . The expression level of codon optimized S protein of IBV was significantly higher than that of the non-codon optimized S protein of IBV. For the codon optimized S protein of IBV expressed from rNDV ( Fig probably represent uncleaved S protein (S0) or polymeric forms of S protein. The ~95 kD band represents S2 or S1 subunit of cleaved S protein of IBV. In the case of rNDV/IBV-S2 strain ( Fig. 2A-lane 1) , there are two bands (~170-220 kDa) on top, representing polymeric folded forms of S2 protein, a ~105 kDa band and a ~95 kDa band representing S2 subunit. The expression of S2 protein from a transcription cassette in which the signal peptide sequences of S protein was not fused with S2 gene was not detected (data not shown). Lane 4 of Fig. 2A and lane 3 of Fig. 2B represent rNDV as control. Lane 5 of panel A represents non-infected DF-1 cells. These results showed that codon optimized S and S2 proteins of IBV were expressed efficiently. The non-codon optimized S protein was also expressed from rNDV, but not efficiently and not consistently. A monoclonal anti-NDV/HN antibody was used to detect a ~70 kDa of HN protein of NDV in lysates, confirming similar level of NDV protein in each lane ( Fig. 2A-lower panel) . We further evaluated incorporation of IBV S and S2 proteins into NDV virions. The rNDVs expressing codon optimized S and S2 proteins and rNDV expressing non-codon optimized S protein were inoculated into eggs, 3 days after inoculation, viral particles in infected allantoic fluid were partially purified and analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 2C-upper panel) . Two bands (~170-220 kDa) on top, representing S protein, a ~95 kDa band and a ~60 kDa band representing S2 or S1 subunit of cleaved S protein, were detected in purified particles of rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C-lane 2) . The lane 4 of Fig. 2C shows two bands (~170-220 kDa) on top, representing polymeric folded of S2 protein, a ~105 kDa band and a ~95 kDa band representing S2 subunit. The lane 1 of Fig. 2C represents purified rNDV control and lane 3 of Fig. 2C shows purified rNDV expressing non-codon optimized S protein. These results suggested that the codon optimized S and S2 proteins of IBV expressed by rNDVs were incorporated into rNDV particles. A monoclonal anti-NDV/HN antibody was used to detect a ~70 kDa of HN protein of NDV in partially purified virions, confirming similar level of NDV protein in each lane (Fig. 2C-lower panel) . The expression of codon optimized S1 protein expressed from four individual rNDV constructs were detected by Western blot analysis in lysates (Fig. 3A) and supernatant (Fig. 3B ) of infected DF-1 cells, using a chicken polyclonal anti IBV serum. The lanes 1-5 represent infected DF-1 cell lysates of rNDV, rNDV/S1, rNDV/ S1 + IBV-S-TM&CT, rNDV/S1(cs−) + NDV-F-TM&CT and rNDV/S1(cs+) + NDV-F-TM&CT, respectively. A ~130 kDa band representing expression of S1 by rNDV/S1 + IBV-S-TM&CT, rNDV/S1(cs−) + NDV-F-TM&CT, and rNDV/S1(cs+) + NDV-F-TM&CT in lysate of DF-1 cells (Fig. 3A -lanes 3-5) and rNDV/S1 in infected DF-1 cell supernatant (Fig. 3B-lane 2) was observed. Our attempts to detect the incorporation of the S1 protein into NDV envelope were not successful, due to the difficulties in the detection of very low level of S1 protein by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Our results showed that the S1 protein was expressed at very low level by all the rNDVs based on Western blot analysis. Only the unmodified S1 protein was detected in the cell culture supernatant. Growth characteristics of rNDV constructs. The recovered rNDVs were passaged in 9-day-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs. All the viruses were able to replicate well in eggs (≥2 8 HAU/ml). rNDV/S1, rNDV/ S1(cs+) + NDV-F-TM&CT, rNDV/S2, rNDV/codon optimized-S and rNDV were evaluated in the presence of exogenous protease in DF-1 cells (Fig. 4) . Compared to the parental virus, rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV grew slightly less efficiently. The maximum titer of parental virus reached 10 7.5 TCID 50 /ml at 40 hours post infection, whereas the maximum titer of rNDV expressing codon optimized S gene of IBV reached 10 7.2 TCID 50 /ml at 40 hours post infection. These results indicated that presence of S, S1 and S2 genes did not significantly affect the growth characteristics of rNDV. The protective efficacy of rNDVs expressing S1, S2 or S protein of IBV in chickens against a virulent IBV challenge. IBV protection experiment 1. To evaluate the protective efficacy of rNDVs expressing S1, S2 or S protein of IBV, SPF chicks were immunized at 1-day-old age with each virus via oculanasal (ON) route. At three weeks post-immunization, chickens were challenged with virulent IBV strain Mass-41. The severity scores of IBV clinical signs were recorded twice a day for 10 days post-challenge (Fig. 5A ). Compared to chickens immunized with parental rNDV and chickens inoculated with PBS, chickens immunized with rNDVs expressing Figure 1 . Schematic diagram of recombinant NDV constructs containing IBV genes. Seven transcription cassettes including; 1-4) Four versions of codon optimized S1 subunit of S gene of IBV strain Mass-41; namely, (a) S1 subunit of S gene (1614 nt), (b) S1 subunit of S gene (1611 nt) fused with N-terminus of transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail of S gene (255 nt), (c) S1 subunit of S gene (1611 nt) containing five putative cleavage site residues of S gene fused with N-terminus of transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail of F gene of NDV (171 nt). In this construct, five C-terminus putative cleavage site residues of S1 gene (RRFRR) plus the first serine (S) residue of N-terminus of transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail of F gene of NDV provides six putative cleavage site residues of S protein of IBV strain Mass-41 (RRFRR/S).

SCientifiC REPoRTS | (2018) 8:11951 | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-30356-2 codon optimized S, S1 or S2 protein of IBV showed significantly less severe of clinical signs (P < 0.05). Among groups of chickens immunized with rNDVs expressing codon optimized S1, S2 or S protein, the group immunized with rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein showed the least severity of clinical signs (P < 0.05). In order to evaluate the efficacy of rNDVs expressing S1, S2 or S protein of IBV in preventing shedding of virulent IBV challenge virus in immunized chickens, on day five post-challenge, tracheal swab samples were collected from chickens of each group and were evaluated for the viral load by RT-qPCR. Our results did not show significant difference in virus shedding among groups of immunized chickens at day five post challenge (Fig. 5B) . However, the results of the inoculation of the tracheal swab samples into 10-day-old embrynated chicken eggs showed that 14 out of 15 (93.3%) chickens vaccinated with rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV and 0 out of 5 (0%) of non-infected chickens were shedding virus in trachea, respectively, whereas 15 out of 15 (100%) of chickens of all other groups were shedding virus in the trachea (data not shown). IBV protection experiment 2. To evaluate the protective efficacy of rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV in adult chickens, SPF chickens were immunized at 4-week-old age. The protective efficacy of rNDV Two bands (~170-220 kDa) on top represent uncleaved S protein (S0) or polymeric forms of S2 or S1 protein (C-lane 2). The ~95 kDa and the ~60 kDa band represent S2 or S1 subunit of cleaved S protein (C-lane 2). The two bands (~170-220 kDa) on top represent polymeric forms of S2 protein, the ~105 kDa band and the ~95 kDa expressing codon optimized S gene of IBV was determined by challenging the immunized chickens with the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) recommended dose (10 3.1 EID 50 ) of virulent IBV strain Mass-41 at 3 week post-immunization 1 . The severity scores of IBV clinical signs were recorded twice a day for 10 days post-challenge (Fig. 6A ). Compared to chickens inoculated with PBS, chickens immunized with rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV and chickens immunized with a commercial live attenuated IBV vaccine showed significantly less severe clinical signs (P < 0.05). In order to evaluate the efficacy of rNDV expressing S protein of IBV in preventing shedding of virulent IBV in immunized chickens, at day 5 following challenge with a Figure 3 . Western blot analysis of rNDV expressing S1 protein of IBV. The expression of codon optimized S1 protein of IBV expressed from four individual rNDVs expressing four different expression cassettes of S1 protein were detected using Western blot in cell lysates (A) and cell supernatant (B) of infected DF-1 cells infected with rNDVs, using a chicken polyclonal anti IBV serum. The lanes 1-5 represent cell lysates of rNDV, rNDV/S1, rNDV/S1 + IBV-S-TM&CT, rNDV/S1(cs−)+NDV-F-TM&CT, rNDV/S1(cs+) + NDV-F-TM&CT, respectively. A ~130 kD band represent expression of S1 protein by rNDV/S1 + IBV-S-TM&CT, rNDV/ S1(cs−) + NDV-F-TM&CT and rNDV/S1(cs+) + NDV-F-TM&CT in infected DF-1 cell lysate (A lanes [3] [4] [5] and rNDV/S1 in infected DF-1 cell supernatant (B-lane 2). The full-length gel is presented in Supplementary Figure S1 . The severity scores of IBV clinical signs include; ocular discharge, nasal discharge and difficulty in breathing (0 = normal, 1 = presence of mild ocular discharge, mild nasal discharge and or sneezing 2 = presence of heavy ocular discharge and or heavy nasal discharge with mild tracheal rales and mouth breathing and or coughing 3 = heavy ocular discharge and heavy nasal discharge with sever tracheal rales and mouth breathing, gasping, dyspnea and or severe respiratory distress) were recorded twice a day for each chicken for 10 days after challenge. The severity scores represent as average scores of clinical signs measured for each chicken over 10 days. (B) Relative viral load determined by RT-qPCR in tracheal swab samples at day five following virulent IBV challenge. The relative viral load expressed as mean reciprocal ± SEM log 10. whereas chickens inoculated with PBS showed high levels of viral load in the trachea (P < 0.05). However, compared to chickens immunized with a commercial IBV vaccine, chickens immunized with rNDV expressing codon optimized S showed slightly less viral load in the trachea (Fig. 6B ). IBV protection experiment 3. To evaluate the protective efficacy of rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV in adult chickens against a higher dose of virulent IBV challenge, SPF chickens were immunized at 4-week-old age. The protective efficacy of rNDV expressing codon optimized S gene of IBV was determined by challenging the immunized chickens with 10 4.7 EID 50 virulent IBV strain Mass-41 at 3 week post-immunization. The severity scores of IBV clinical signs were recorded twice a day for 8 days post-challenge (Fig. 7A ). Compared to chickens immunized with rNDV and chickens inoculated with PBS, chickens immunized with rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV and chickens immunized with a commercial live attenuated IBV vaccine showed significantly less severe clinical signs (P < 0.05). In order to evaluate the efficacy of rNDV expressing S protein of IBV in preventing shedding of virulent IBV in immunized chickens, at days 4 following challenge with virulent IBV, the tracheal swab samples collected from five chickens of each group were analyzed for the IBV specific lesions in chicken embryo. Our results showed that 2 out of 5 (40%) chickens vaccinated with rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV and 1 out of 5 (20%) chickens vaccinated with a commercial IBV vaccine were shedding virus in trachea, respectively, whereas 5 out of 5 (100%) of chickens immunized with parental rNDV and 5 out of 5 (100%) of chickens inoculated with PBS were shedding virus in the trachea (Fig. 7C) . The tracheal swab samples collected from five chickens of each group were also analyzed for the viral load by RT-qPCR. Our results showed that chickens vaccinated with rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV showed low levels of viral load in the trachea and chickens vaccinated with a commercial IBV vaccine showed very low levels of viral load in the trachea, whereas chickens inoculated with PBS and rNDV showed high levels of viral load in the trachea. Compared to chickens immunized with rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein, chickens immunized with a commercial IBV vaccine showed less viral load in the trachea (P < 0.05) (Fig. 7B ). IBV protection experiment 4. To evaluate the effect of the route of inoculation of virulent IB challenge virus on the outcomes of the protective efficacy of rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV, SPF chicks were immunized at 1-day-old age. The protective efficacy of rNDV expressing codon optimized S gene of IBV was determined by challenging the immunized chickens with 10 4 EID 50 virulent IBV strain Mass-41 by the intraocular route at 3 week post-immunization. This route of challenge has been specified in USDA-CFR-9 for IBV 33 . The severity scores of IBV clinical signs were recorded twice a day for 10 days post-challenge. Compared to chickens immunized with rNDV and unvaccinated chickens, chickens immunized with rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV and chickens immunized with a commercial live attenuated IBV vaccine showed significantly less severe clinical signs. However, compared to chickens immunized with commercial IBV vaccine, chickens immunized with rNDV expressing S protein showed less severe clinical signs (P < 0.05) (Fig. 8A) . In order to evaluate the efficacy of rNDV expressing S protein of IBV in preventing shedding of virulent IBV in immunized chickens, at days 5 following challenge with virulent IBV, the tracheal swab samples collected from all chickens of each group were analyzed for the IBV specific lesions in chicken embryos. Our results showed that 2 out of 10 (20%) chickens vaccinated with rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV and 5 out of 10 (50%) chickens vaccinated with a commercial IBV vaccine were shedding virus in trachea, respectively, whereas 10 out of 10 (100%) of chickens immunized with parental rNDV and 5 out of 5 (100%) of unvaccinated chickens, infected with IBV, were shedding virus in the trachea (Fig. 8B) . The protective efficacy of rNDVs against a highly virulent NDV challenge. To evaluate the protective efficacy of rNDV expressing S gene of IBV against a virulent NDV strain, groups of five 1-day-old chicks were immunized with rNDV, rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein and PBS. Three weeks after immunization, chickens were challenged with virulent NDV strain Texas GB in our BSL-3 plus facility. Our results showed that all chickens immunized with the rNDV and rNDV expressing codon optimized S gene of IBV survived after highly virulent NDV challenge, while all chickens in PBS group died at day 5 and 6 post-challenge (Fig. 9A) . Antibodies produced against IBV and NDV. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using a standard protocol of OIE was used to assess the level of antibodies mounted against NDV in serum samples of chickens 21 days after immunization. The results showed that HI titers of NDV was detected in serum samples of all chickens immunized with rNDV and rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein. There was no significant differences observed among HI titers against NDV in serum samples of chickens from groups immunized with rNDV and rNDV expressing S protein (Fig. 9B ). Virus neutralization assay was performed according to a standard protocol of OIE to assess the level of neutralizing antibodies mounted against IBV strain Mass-41 in serum samples of chickens at 21 days after immunization. The results showed that the neutralizing antibodies against IBV were detected in serum samples of chickens immunized with rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV and with commercial live attenuated IBV vaccine (Fig. 7D) . Neutralizing antibodies against IBV were not detected in 1:8 dilution of a serum sample from a chicken immunized with empty rNDV vector. This result showed that the rNDV expressing codon optimized S protein of IBV induces neutralizing antibodies against IBV.
