Complete genomic sequence determination of multiple ZIKV strains. Constructing an infectious clone requires knowledge of the complete viral genome sequence. However, many early ZIKV sequences deposited in GenBank annotated as being a "complete genome" were actually incomplete (accession numbers KU729218, KU707826, KF383116, etc.), consisting of a complete open reading frame sequence with incomplete sequences of the 5= and/or 3= untranslated regions (UTRs). We therefore sought to determine whether our laboratory stocks of MR766 and H/PF/2013 matched the published sequences. MR766 is the prototype ZIKV strain, isolated in Uganda in 1947 (1) , and has undergone extensive in vivo and in vitro passaging resulting in substrains. Conversely, H/PF/2013 is a human clinical isolate from French Polynesia, 2013, with limited passage in Vero cells (23) . Our laboratory stocks of both of these viruses were grown in C6/36 cells, and cDNA was prepared from infected cell supernatant. Sanger sequencing was performed on PCR products to obtain a consensus sequence of the open reading frame, and these exactly matched deposited sequences for each virus (MR766, accession no. KU955594, and H/PF/2013, accession no. KJ776791). Of interest, we identified our MR766 strain as being among those substrains that carry a four-codon deletion that ablates a canonical N-linked glycosylation site in the envelope (E) glycoprotein (Fig. 1B) , rather than an alternative MR766 substrain (and other ZIKV strains) that encodes a glycosylation site at this position (N154). We next obtained complete sequences of the 5= and 3= genomic termini for both strains. We used a modified 5=-3= rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method because conventional RACE protocols are dependent upon a 3= poly(A) tail which is not present on flavivirus genomes (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). The deposited genomic sequence of MR766 included complete 5= and 3= termini, and our sequences matched these exactly ( Fig. S1B and C). As the deposited sequence of H/PF/2013 consisted of a complete open reading frame with only partial UTR sequences, our analysis added 60 nucleotides (nt) to the 5= end and 130 nucleotides to the 3= end to generate a new complete genomic sequence for this virus ( Fig. S1B and C). An additional contemporary outbreak strain, PRVABC59, a human clinical isolate from Puerto Rico, 2015, had the same 5= and 3= UTR sequences as H/PF/2013 except for a single difference in the 3= UTR at nucleotide 10391 ( Fig. S1B and C) . Interestingly, the nucleotide change at position 10391 also occurs in both of the early Brazilian ZIKV isolates (SPH2015 and BeH819015) and matches the PRVABC59 sequence as well. This represents a diversity of only 0.23% between the 3= UTRs of H/PF/2013 and PRVABC59, whereas the H/PF/2013 and MR766 3= UTRs differ by 17 nucleotides (3.90%). These results indicate a high degree of conservation of the 5= and 3= UTR genomic regions, especially in natural clinical isolates that have not undergone extensive in vitro and in vivo passages. Development of a ZIKV reverse genetics system using unidirectional assembly of a quadripartite genome. We previously developed reverse genetics platforms that are comprised of multipartite genomes with unidirectional assembly to generate stable infectious clones for coronaviruses (24, 25) and DENV (20) (21) (22) . Given the high genetic relatedness between DENV and ZIKV, we adapted this strategy to design a clone of our MR766 ZIKV substrain, which lacks E glycosylation due to a 4-amino-acid (aa) deletion (ϪGly MR766), using a quadripartite subgenomic system to disrupt toxic genomic regions by partitioning them onto four high-copy-number plasmids for bacterial amplification ( Fig. 1A and B) . The partition sites were chosen to mimic those used to construct DENV infectious clones by this method (20) and by the location of naturally occurring class IIG restriction sites which cleave outside their recognition site, generating nonpalindromic ends that allow for unidirectional ligation of the purified four genomic fragments into full-length genomes. A T7 RNA polymerase promoter site was oriented directly upstream of the first ZIKV nucleotide and used for in vitro transcription of full-length ligated genomes, while a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme immediately following the last ZIKV nucleotide generates an authentic 3= terminus on the full-length infectious genomic RNA (Fig. 1A) . These transcripts were electroporated into C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells, which released high-titer infectious virus (approximately 10 6 to 10 7 focus-forming units [FFU]/ml) in the culture supernatants (Fig. 1D ). These were collected and passaged once or twice on C6/36 cells to generate virus stocks used for experiments. To verify the presence of molecularly cloned viruses, we sequenced the full viral genome, confirming the genetic origins of each recombinant virus. Since the MR766 infectious clone included engineered ablation of duplicate restriction sites, we also digested cDNA from the clone and isolate viruses, confirming the expected restriction fragment sizes from two of the clones (Fig. 1E) . Although our substrain of MR766 exactly matched deposited sequences of this virus (accession number KU955594), other deposited MR766 substrain sequences differ and encode an intact N-linked glycosylation site at N154 of E. Since this N154 glycosylation site is a known determinant of virulence, neuroinvasion, and vector competence for other flaviviruses (26, 27) , we constructed an additional MR766 variant with an intact glycosylation site based on this published sequence (accession number KU720415). A third clone restoring the 4-aa deletions but not encoding the N-linked glycosylation site was also generated (accession number LC002520). An amino acid alignment of the region surrounding the N154 glycosylation site highlights the differences in the clone viruses (Fig. 1B) . Restoration of the 4-aa deletion and functional glycosylation was confirmed by Western blot analysis of E protein. As expected, glycosylated E migrates at the highest molecular weight followed by the ϩDel and ϪGly clones and natural isolate (Fig. 1F ). While peak infectious titers of all three clone viruses reached similar levels as our isolate virus with the 4-aa deletion (Fig. 1D) , the viral clone with restored glycosylation appears to have an early growth advantage and to make larger infectious foci than the other allelic mutants ( Fig. 1C; Fig. S2 ).
