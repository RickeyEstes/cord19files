During the study period, 143 preterm infants were born, of whom 30 (20.9%) required admission for respiratory infection, compared with 129 (6.9%) of 1858 term infants born in the same period (p < 0.0001, OR 3.6 CI 2.0 to 5.0). The gestational age between the 143 preterm babies was 32 0 ---33 6 (moderate preterm) in 30 cases (21%) and 34 0 ---36 6 (late preterm) in 113 (79%) cases. 33% (10 cases) of the moderate preterm infants required hospitalisation versus 18% (20 cases) of the late preterm babies. A viral agent was identified in 25 of the 30 (83%) episodes in preterm babies, and in 110 of the 129 (85%) of the episodes in term infants. The virus most frequently involved in the preterm infants was RSV (76%) followed by rhinovirus (20%) ( Table 1) . We detected coinfections in 10% of the cases in moderate preterm babies, in 35% of late preterm infants, and in 25% of those born at term. The most frequent associations were RSV with adenovirus and rhinovirus. We found no differences in the aetiology of infections in preterm and term infants. Clinical characteristics of the episodes in the preterm group are described in Table 2 . The average age at admission was 5 ± 3.5 months, gestational age at birth 34.4 ± 1.5 weeks, birth weight 2246 ± 469 g and male predominance (56%). 68% of those with respiratory infection had a history of having been admitted at birth. Fever was present in 56% and 28% showed pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography. 68% of them received treatment with epinephrine, 12% with salbutamol and 20% did not receive bronchodilators. 80% of them required oxygen therapy, 24% of them with high-flow system. The average length of hospital stay was 5.43 ± 4.29 days. Four preterm infants required admission to intensive care unit (2.79%), all due to RSV infection. The most frequent diagnosis was bronchiolitis. We compared clinical and epidemiological characteristics of episodes among term and preterm infants (Table 2) , and we found no statistically significant differences in the parameters studied. 24 patients required admission to intensive care unit, of whom one (10%) was moderate preterm, five (25%) late preterm and 18 (13.9%) were born at term. 25% of them had a personal history of adaptive respiratory distress (p < 0.05, OR 2.6 CI 1.238 to 5.827) ( Table 3) . 66% were younger than a month old on admission to intensive care. None had presented respiratory virus infection during their admission to the neonatal unit. No significant differences were found between the number of moderate and late preterm infants who needed ICU admission.
