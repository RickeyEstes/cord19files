Similar to most of the group A rotaviruses (Estes and Cohen, 1989; Bellamy and Both, 1990) , the VP7 nucleotide sequence of strains RV198/95 and RV52/96 is 1062 nucleotides long. The ORF starts at nucleotide 49 with an AUG (ATG) start codon and ends at nucleotide 1029 with a UAG (TAG) termination codon, comprising 981 nucleotides. The inferred VP7 amino acid sequence of strains RV198/95 and RV52/96, aligned with the sequences of other G3 animal and human rotaviruses, is reported in Fig. 1 . As expected, the sequence of both the strains is 326 amino acids long and conserves the potential glycosylation site NST at residues 69-71 (Bellamy and Both, 1990) . On the basis of sequence analysis, both strains RV198/95 and RV52/96 clearly belong to the G3 serotype. Rotaviruses belonging to the same G serotype generally share more than 91% VP7 amino acid similarity (Kapikian and Chanock, 1996; Palombo et al., 1997) , even if strains displaying an overall identity of only 88.7% are included into the G3 serotype (Li et al., 1994) . As shown in Table 3 , strain RV198/95 had the highest nucleotide identity (about 96-97%) to the canine strains K9, CU-1, A79-10 and to the human strain HCR3A. Sequence similarity of strain RV52/96 was highest (90%) to the rhesus rotavirus RRV, followed by the equine strain ERV316 (85.8%), rather than to the canine strains (83-84%). In regard to the amino acid composition, strain RV198/95 revealed the highest identity to the G3 human strain HCR3A (100%), followed by the canine strains K9, CU-1, A79-10 (97.5-99%) and the feline strain CAT97 (99.4%). As regards strain RV52/96, a high amino acid similarity was found to the simian strains RRV (96.1%) and SA11 (95.1%), whereas identity to the canine strains was about 94-95%. The two Italian isolates showed about 84.0% nucleotide and 96.2% amino acid similarity to each other. In Fig. 2 the neighbor-joining tree based on the VP7 amino acid sequence of human and animal Gouvea et al. (1990) . G3 rotaviruses is presented. Human G3 rotaviruses differ from the animal G3 isolates, with exception of the human strain HCR3A, which is clustered together with the canine strains, and the feline strain CAT2, which is grouped with the human isolates. Strain RV52/96 seems to be genetically more similar to the simian strain RRV.
