A multi-frame tag to monitor single RNA translation in two reading frames simultaneously We created a multi-frame (MF) tag to monitor, in living cells, the translation of single RNAs with overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). The tag builds off earlier technology to visualize translation using repeat FLAG or SunTag epitopes labeled by fluorescent Fab or scFv, respectively (Lyon and Stasevich, 2017; Morisaki and Stasevich, 2018) . In the MF tag, FLAG epitopes in the 0 frame are separated from one another by SunTag epitopes in the -1 frame. With this arrangement, single RNAs with ribosomes translating the 0 frame will produce FLAG epitopes labeled by Fab, while those with ribosomes translating the -1 frame will produce SunTag epitopes labeled by scFv. Thus, depending on the chosen frame(s), polysomes will appear all green (all ribosomes translating the 0 frame), all blue (all ribosomes translating the -1 frame), or some combination of the two (Fig. 1A) . To ensure both frames of the MF tag encode functional proteins and have similar ribosomal occupancy, we inserted the first exon of the human GNAS1 locus downstream of the FLAG and SunTag epitopes. The GNAS1 locus contains two overlapping ORFs of roughly equivalent lengths that encode peripheral membrane proteins in the 0 and -1 frames: XXLb1 and AlexX (Abramowitz et al., 2004; Aydin et al., 2009) (Fig. 1A ). In combination with the epitopes, this arrangement has several advantages: 1) epitope densities are maximal since -1 frame epitopes act as linkers for the 0 frame and vice versa; 2) signals are digital, so frameshifted and non-frameshifted species are marked by two distinct probes/colors, and 3) epitopes are placed in nearly equivalent positions, so signals appear at roughly the same time and with similar amplification when translated with similar kinetics. As a first application of the MF tag, we focused on -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting caused by the HIV-1 frameshift sequence (FSS). We inserted the FSS upstream of our MF tag and transiently transfected the resulting construct into U-2 OS cells. The FSS contains a slippery poly-U stretch nine nucleotides upstream of a stem loop. Two to ten hours post transfection, we observed cells with tens or hundreds of individual RNA diffusing throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 1B) . Nascent Chain To confirm these RNA were active translation sites, or polysomes, we performed two experiments. First, we re-imaged cells 12-24 hours after transfection. At these later time points, Fab and scFv began to accumulate in the cell membrane ( Fig. S1 and Movie this frame encoding a functional protein, as demonstrated by shifting the sequence by one nucleotide into the 0 frame ( Fig. S1 and Movie S2, right panels). Second, we treated cells with the translational inhibitor puromycin. Just minutes after treatment, we observed a dramatic decrease in the number of Fab-and/or scFv-labeled RNA, consistent with the premature release of nascent chains ( Fig. 1D and Movie S3). Together, these data provide strong evidence that we are able to detect single RNA frameshifting dynamics with the MF tag.
