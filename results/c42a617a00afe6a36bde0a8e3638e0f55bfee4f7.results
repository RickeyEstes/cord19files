We apply the aforedescribed procedure to the data obtained so far for cities in South Korea, Italy and Iran. These data represent the early stage of progression of the epidemic spreading, as the trends clearly show that the numbers of infected cases in most cities are still climbing, as of March 6, 2020. For each city or region, we identify a group of 10 profiles of best fit from the historical archive, and retrieve the corresponding sets of profile codes for generating the propagation profiles in the coming days. Using these 10 profiles, we produce an average progression profile, which is also accompanied by a deviation range at 95% confidence level. Other Iranian cities will see less than 1,000 eventual infected cases. Our prediction gives a total of 14450 ±6244 individuals eventually infected, which is 0.018% ±0.008% of the country's population. 5. Provided the authorities continue to impose strict control measures, the epidemic will come under control by the end of April and is expected to end before June 2020, and as the quality of treatment improves, more rapid recovery will be expected. Our prediction on the South Korean cities has revealed a very rapid progression of the epidemic, with 5,000 infections emerged within 10 days and peaks to be expected in most cities or regions within about 2 weeks. The Korean authorities have managed to test an overwhelmingly large number of people (140,000) within a short time, thus preventing a large number of infected and infectious individuals not being quarantined in time [13] . This strategy has an obvious advantage of offering a clear picture of the extents and locations of the infected individuals in the country at the early phase of the epidemic progression. The epidemic progression is found to be more rapid than typical, reflecting on the effectiveness of the control measures being taken. Italy has the second highest death toll after China, reaching 197 on March 6, 2020 [14] . The fatality rate is about 4%, which is the highest in the world. With infection cases soaring to 3,916 (as of March 6, 2020), Italy had implemented control measures to contain the spread of the virus by shutting down schools and suspending public events in regions where outbreaks were reported. The epidemic is expected to progress in a typical pace (with the present set of parameters), unless more stringent measures are in place. The situation in Iran is also critical, with the number of infected cases escalated to over 4,000 in less than 2 weeks. Iran has reported death of two lawmakers as of March 7, 2020, and has been struggling to control the contagion, which has spread to 31 provinces [15] . The progression profile is again typical, however, expecting to peak in around 3 weeks. Like Italy, most cities show typical spreading profiles, and the peaks and subsequent decline are 6 .
