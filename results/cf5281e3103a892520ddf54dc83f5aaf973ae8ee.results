Based on pathophysiology of formation nine effusions were transudates (all secondary to CHF) and 11 were exudates (five caused by malignancies, three by chylothorax and three by infectious diseases) ( Table 1) . Five of the cats with transudates were male (one entire and four neutered) and four were female (one entire and three neutered), with an average age of 8.89 AE 4.58 years (range 3.0e14.41 years). Those with exudates were five male (all neutered) and six female (one entire and five neutered), with an average age of 9.07 AE 4.96 years (range 0.33e13.83 years). Using the traditional veterinary classification 8, 9, 15 of the nine modified transudates, TPp and TNCCp values caused misclassification of two effusions (effusion number: 2 and 9) as pure transudates and it was not possible to clearly classify two more effusions (effusions number: 1 and 8) because of discordant information deriving from TPp and TNCCp (Table 1) . Of the 11 exudates TPp and TNCCp results caused misclassification of four effusions. Three (effusion number: 15, 16 and 17) were incorrectly classified as modified transudates and one (effusion number: 10) was misclassified as intermediate between a pure transudate and a modified transudate. In addition TPp and TNCCp results prevented clear classification of four more exudative effusions (effusion number : 12, 14, 19 and 20) because of discordant information deriving from TPp and TNCCp (Table 1 ). The overall accuracy of the traditional veterinary classification was 40%.
