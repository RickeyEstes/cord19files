In our laboratory we have prepared some 75 hybridoma antibodies. Of these, 21 were found to immunoprecipitate the H-polypeptide, 1 the nucleocapsid, and 2 the matrix protein of measles virus Edmonston. The remainder were not positive by this technique, even though all bound to high titers in a radioimmunoassay . The biological properties of the anti-H-hybridomas have been tested, and on this basis, these antibodies were divided into 5 groups (ter Meulen et al., 198 1) . These groups are summarized below (Table I) . This type of analysis has provided the first evidence that a given antigenic determinant on the H-polypeptide could be altered in functional significance between measles and SSPE virus strains. That is, the site for a given antibody may still be present, but the antibody-antigen combination no longer produces the same biological effect .
