In vitro expression of pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) Sequence analysis of pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) showed 100% identity of the S sequences compared to those of GenBank accession numbers DQ811789.1 (TGEV-S1) and AF353511.1 (PEDV-S1 and S), respectively. Analysis by immunofluorescence microscopy showed that transfection of BHK-21 cells with pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S1) and pIRES-(TGEV-S1-PEDV-S) plasmids resulted in the expression of the S or S1 proteins, respectively, of TGEV and PEDV (Figure 2 ). Western blot further confirmed the in vitro expression of these genes of interest (Figure 3 ).
