This study illustrates how one aspect of the thermal information, the orbital max temperature and the use of mean ratios have utility as early predictors of illness. Tables 1 and 2 illustrated how these predictors compare to other clinical standards commonly used in the animal industries both at the time a positive diagnosis is made with the calves or the day of illness and for a subset of animals measured 4-6 days prior to the positive identification of the disease. Of the sixty five animals meeting the criteria for a true positive diagnosis, it was possible to also collect prior data from 4-6 days earlier on thirty seven of these calves. Bovine respiratory disease predictive values, cut off values as determined by ROC curves and efficiency calculations were completed for all calves in the true positive and true negative populations. These calculations were made for both clinical (Table 3 ) and 4-6 days pre clinical (Table  4 ) time frames. Both absolute and mean ratio infrared values are displayed compared to several other commonly used predictors of disease in cattle including core temperature, white blood cell count, neutrophile/lymphocyte ratios, clinical scores and salivary cortisol values. Examples of response operant characteristic (ROC) curves are shown for both clinical scores and infrared absolute values calculated at both clinical and pre clinical times. For illustrative purposes, the progression and onset of bovine respiratory disease as detected by infrared thermography is shown in one animal (Fig. 2) . In terms of test comparisons, Fishers exact test results indicated that on the day of illness there were no significant differences in the ability of the tests to distinguish diseased animals (P > 0.05). In other words, when an animal was clinically ill then clinical scores, core temperature, haematology values or infrared thermography would suggest that animals was ill with equivalent accuracy. However, for data 4-6 days prior to the appearance of clinical illness, Fisher exact test scores indicated that infrared thermography was significantly better (P < 0.01) at identifying true positive animals than either clinical scores or core temperature.
