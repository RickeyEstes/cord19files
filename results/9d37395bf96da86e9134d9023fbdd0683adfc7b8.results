During the study period, 114 HCWs (all of those interviewed) responded to the questionnaire. The partition of HCWs by category and department is presented in Fig. 1 . The majority of participants were women (74.6%); the mean age was 33.5 Â± 10.0 years. Behaviour of HCWs in use of MPs during work at hospital All HCWs owned a PMP, and 99 of them (86.8%) used a DECT daily at work. All the HCWs declared that they knew that MPs could host infectious agents. The participants received more than ten calls per workday in 65.6% of cases (75/114 HCWs); no statistical difference was found among categories. Table 1 lists the results of the questionnaire analysis. HCWs used their PMPs in hospital in 37.7% (43/114) of cases, with medical HCWs using their PMP more frequently than paramedical HCWs (respectively, 33/65 vs. 10/53, p <0.001). Seventy-three HCWs (64%) used MPs during care. Among them, 28.8% (21/ 73) never performed hand hygiene before using their MP, whereas 37.0% (27/73) of HCWs never performed it after using their MP. Overall, 15 HCWs (20.6%) never performed hand hygiene both before and after using a MP. As shown in Table 1 We also sampled 22 PMPs from medical students who were present in the wards during the study; 11 (50%) were found to be positive for virus RNA (RV n = 7, RSV n = 2, influenza virus A and influenza virus B n = 1 each). Because they did not respond to the questionnaire, they were not included in the multivariate analysis. Correlation of viral contamination of MPs to the behaviour of HCWs Table 1 shows the detection of viruses on at least one MP by HCW category. By multivariate analysis, the presence of virus RNA was significantly associated with MPs from paediatric HCWs compared to adult HCWs (p < 0.001; 32/59 vs. 10/50; odds ratio increased by 2.76). Other recorded behaviours in using MPs in hospital were not associated with viral contamination. Notably, there were no differences in viral contamination regarding staff categories or hygiene habits related to MP use.
