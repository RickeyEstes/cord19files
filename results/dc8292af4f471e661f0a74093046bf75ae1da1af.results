Expression and purification of recombinant truncated polypeptides of S450-650 and their fusion products with GFP Preparation of recombinant S450-650 was as previously described (Zhao et al., 2005a (Zhao et al., , 2005b . DNA encoding truncated fragments covering the sequence of S450-650, namely S-I (450-510), S-II (511-560), S-III (546-595), S-IV (581-630) and S-V (601-650), were amplified by PCR using vector pET28a-S450-650 (encoding for S450-650 of SARS-CoV) as template. The resultant products were inserted into prokaryotic expression vector pET28a. DNA encoding GFP was inserted downstream the S protein genes for preparation of GFP fusion proteins S450-650-GFP, S450-510-GFP and S511-650-GFP (Fig. 1A) . Glycine-and serine-rich linkers of various length have been widely used in protein engineering since these linkers may offer little structure hindrance to folding proteins in their own constructs Nardella et al., 2004) . A linker sequence (GSGGSGS) was therefore introduced between S fragment and GFP. The recombinant products, expressed in E. coli, were purified to more than 90% homogeneity using Ni columns and examined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (Figs. 1B and 2).
