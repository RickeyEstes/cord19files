No cases of ONFH were recorded in the Recent group (0%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0%e3.3%), although eight cases of ONFH were recorded in the Past group (3.4%; 95% CI, 1.5e6.7%; one-sided Fisher's exact probability test, p ¼ 0.043). Intergroup comparisons of background and demographic factors revealed significant increases in age, BMI, number of patients with ABO and HLA incompatibilities, and living kidney donors in the Recent group ( Table 1) . Comparison of postoperative immunosuppressant use showed increased frequency of tacrolimus use, increased number of patients with concomitant use of basiliximab, and decreases in MPSL, PSL, and total steroid dose at postoperative weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 in the Recent group ( Table 1) . Regardless of the increase in risk factors for RT such as older age and increased number of ABO/HLAincompatible transplants among patients, decreases in steroid administration and improvements in postoperative renal function have been observed in the Recent group. In addition, significant decreases were seen in the number of cases with DGF, concentrations of BUN and Cr at 8 weeks after transplantation, incidence of acute transplant rejection, and duration of hospitalization over time ( Table 1) . The overall results were surveyed for risk factors for ONFH. According to the analysis of individual factors, total MPSL dose at postoperative weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8, total steroid dose at postoperative weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 and DGF were identified as significant risk factors (Table 2) . PSL administration at postoperative weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 was not a risk factor. We performed multivariate analysis (logistic regression analysis) for age, gender, and total MPSL dose at postoperative week 2, and DGF. Significant risk factors for ONFH were total MPSL dose at postoperative week 2 (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.04e8.07; p ¼ 0.04) and DGF (OR, 5.97; 95% CI, 1.36e26.26; p ¼ 0.02) ( Table 3) . When the MPSL doses at postoperative weeks 4, 6, and 8 were selected as a risk factor rather than that at week 2, the following were the adjusted values: for week 4, OR was 2.29 (95% CI, 1.03e5.13; p ¼ 0.04); for week 6, OR was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.02e3.28; p ¼ 0.04); and for week 8, OR was 1.71 (95% CI, 1.03e2.83; p ¼ 0.04). MPSL administration at week 2 showed the highest adjusted OR. The types of ONFH according to Japanese investigation committee classification, their natural course and surgical treatment were summarized in Table 4 .
