During validation of short-term projections, from one week to four weeks, we found models consistently scored higher on shorter-term forecasts. Based on case counts as of February 25, the stochastic model projected a median case count of 933 cases by February 18 (95% prediction interval: 872-1054) and 955 cases by March 4 (95% prediction interval: 874-1105), while the auto-regression model projects median case counts of 889 (95% prediction interval: 876-933) and 898 (95% prediction interval: 877-983) cases for those dates, respectively. Projected median final counts range from 953 to 1, 749 . Although the outbreak is already larger than all past Ebola outbreaks other than the 2013-2016 outbreak of over 26,000 cases, our models do not project that it is likely to grow to that scale. The stochastic model estimates that vaccination coverage in this outbreak is lower than reported in its trial setting in Sierra Leone. When we started performing our short-term forecasts on August 20, 2018, there were 102 reported EVD cases in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, DRC. We used our stochastic and auto-regression models to project one-week, two-week, four-week, and eight-week forecasts of outbreak size. As time lapsed, we compared predicted and known outbreak sizes, and found a higher probability of accurate forecasts at one week than at eight weeks (Figs 2 and 3) . Loglikelihood scores typically declined as projection times extended further into the future. These lower-scoring longer-term projections tended to include wider prediction intervals, reflecting less certain outcomes in which less probability was assigned to any one value. The epidemic curve accelerated in early October, and stochastic model forecasts occurring just before that change were especially low scoring, as they failed to anticipate the coming rise in case counts. Subsequent projections took into account the reported acceleration and their performance recovered. After our model validation process was completed, we used the stochastic and auto-regression models to project one-week, two-week, four-week, and eight-week outcomes (Figs 4 and  5) . We used the Gott's rule and Theil-Sen regression models together with the stochastic model to project final outbreak sizes (Figs 6 and 7) . As of February 25, the total reported count of probable and confirmed EVD cases was 875 cases. With the stochastic model, the four-week projection of median outbreak size was 955 cases (95% prediction interval: 874-1105). With the auto-regression model, the four-week projection of median outbreak size was 898 cases (95% prediction interval: 877-983). Median final outbreak size projected by the stochastic model was 990 cases (95% prediction interval: 860-1295). With the Gott's rule model, the median final outbreak size was 1749 cases (95% prediction interval: 921-17498). Median final outbreak size projected by the regression model was 953 cases (95% prediction interval: 882-1136). The possibility of a final outbreak size exceeding 1,000 cases was projected to be quite likely by all the models, with the Gott's rule forecast being particularly pessimistic, as it was in all cases. The probability of a very large outbreak (10,000 or more cases) was calculated to be below 8% for Gott's rule and negligibly small for the other models. A final outbreak size of a catastrophic outbreak larger than the West Africa outbreak (28,616 or more cases) was projected to have probability less than 3% by Gott's rule and negligibly small for the other models (S2 Table) . We generated short-and long-term projections from earlier snapshots of the current outbreak case counts with each model, for the purpose of both scoring and forecasting. These additional results can be found in the Supplemental Material.
