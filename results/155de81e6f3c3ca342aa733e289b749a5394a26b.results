Fullerene cages can have varying degrees of symmetry, including the icosahedral symmetry of the Buckminster fullerene and carbon onions, the lower dihedral symmetries of prolate architectures, and the asymmetric shapes of fullerene cones. Similarly, nanoparticle graphs and SAPNs can vary in symmetry. We start with a classification of nanoparticle graphs with non-planar symmetries, i.e. those with at least two different types of symmetry axes. Note that fourfold symmetry axes cannot occur. This is because vertices of nanoparticle graphs cannot occupy fourfold axes, and octagonal faces are excluded. Therefore, icosahedral and tetrahedral symmetries are the only possible non-planar options. Symmetry imposes strong restrictions on the number N of edges of the nanoparticle graph, so that only particles with certain numbers of PBBs are allowed. In order to construct the nanoparticle graphs for these cases explicitly, we adapt methods used previously in the context of fullerene architecture. In particular, for the modelling of the icosahedrally symmetric nanoparticle graphs we adapt the Goldberg-Coxeter procedure [21, 22] , and for the tetrahedral graphs we use its extension to tetrahedral symmetry by Fowler et al. [23] . In each case, we first construct the fullerenes with required symmetry and number of edges, and then derive the corresponding nanoparticle graphs via the vertex colouring rule in figure 2.
