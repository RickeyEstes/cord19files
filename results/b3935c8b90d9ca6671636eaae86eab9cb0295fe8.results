3.1. Passive treatment with egg yolk powder containing bovine RVA IgY Abs significantly reduced diarrhea duration and severity compares with colostrum deprived calves For this experiment, newborn calves assigned to each experimental group were orally inoculated with virulent bovine RVA (Indiana strain, G6P[5] genotype) at 36 h of life. The onset of diarrhea after virus inoculation was statistically similar for all groups of calves, (G1: 2.0 days; G2: 1.2 days; G3: 2 days). In agreement, bovine RVA infectious viral particles were detected in feces from all animals by the same day that diarrhea appeared. Results for diarrhea and virus shedding are detailed in Fig. 1 . Following the experimental design, calves assigned to G1 received RVA IgY Ab treatment within 2 h since the development of diarrhea and for seven consecutive days. Diarrhea in this group terminated an average of 3.2 days after the beginning of the passive treatment (range 2 to 5 days). This duration was significantly shorter than the ones registered for CD calves (10.4 days, G3) while animals fed colostrum followed by RVA Ab free milk (G2) developed RVAassociated diarrhea of an intermediate duration (average 7.6 days). Interestingly, virus shedding duration was significantly shorter in calves in G1 (average 4.5 days) than in animals in G2 (average 11.6 days), while calves in G3 showed an intermediate duration of 6 days in Fig. 1 . Virus shedding, diarrhea duration and coproAbs titers in feces of the experimental groups of calves. Calves in G1 were fed two liters of commercial bovine milk supplemented with 100 g of egg yolk powder containing Indiana RVA strain-specific IgY Abs, twice a day for 7 days from diarrhea onset. Calves in G2 and G3 were fed RVA Ab free milk without any supplementation. Continuous lines represent the average ELISA Ab titer of isotype-specific bovine coproAbs to bovine Indiana RVA strain detected in feces. Dashed line in G1 represents the average ELISA IgY Ab titer to Indiana RVA strain. Columns represent average daily profile of virus shedding for experimental calves expressed as FFU/mL. Horizontal bar indicates mean diarrhea duration. Tables included in each graph indicate diarrhea duration defined as the number of days with fecal score ≥2. Feces consistency was scored daily (0 = normal; 1 = pasty; 2 = semi-liquid; 3 = liquid). 1 Means in the same column with different superscript upper case letters differ significantly (Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test; p b 0.05). 2 Determined by ELISA and CCIF. Number of days with bovine RVA-associated hyperthermia was considered as days with body temperature N39°C. C = colostrum/CD = colostrum deprived. AUC: area under the diarrhea/virus shedding curve. PID: post inoculation day. VS: virus shedding. LIC: large intestinal contents. SIC: small intestinal contents. average. However, the areas under the curve of virus shedding (AUC) were not significantly different between the experimental groups of calves. Severity of RVA-associated diarrhea, considered as the average AUC of diarrhea score for each group of calves, was also significantly lower in RVA IgY Ab treated calves (G1) than in either of the other groups of animals (G2 and G3). Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the number of days with RVA-associated hyperthermia for calves in G1 (2.5 days in average) compared with animals in control groups (G2: 12 days and G3: 11.4 days). It is important to mention that animals receiving passive RVA-specific IgY Ab treatment (G1) did not show other clinical signs of bovine RVA infection like anorexia, dehydration or depression (personal observation, data not shown), while they were evident in all calves in G2 and specially in G3. All the calves in G1 cleared the viral infection while they were under passive treatment with IgY Abs and infectious virus was not detected during the experiment (Fig. 1a) . As shown, IgY Abs to Indiana RVA strain from the passive treatment were detected by ELISA in feces from calves in G1 (Fig. 1a) . The ELISA IgY Ab titers to RVA varied daily and could be associated with the viral replication and shedding, especially because there was an increase in the titers observed once RVA-infection was cleared, around PIDs 9-10. Finally, IgY Abs disappeared in one or two days after the end of the passive treatment (Fig. 1a) .
