The experiment results showed that the ESMS has abilities to help SRRT and the community team in the 8th health region. It successfully demonstrated four potentials for a better process as it reduces time and improves an overall performance by taking out the duplicated and informal documents. Many informal processes and documents such as using the social network were reduced. The results from SRRT and surveillance team indicated that with this system the contamination is easier to achieve. As the program allowed the team to manage and operate their work. With the data entry function that could select staff tasks along with their area of responsibility that matched the available resources, provincial public health staffs easily determine and set up the active field team according to the outbreak level. With the HIS-import function, the ESMS is able to fill out the patient forms in a shorter time and thus reduce the mandate and workload for the SRRT and back office. Moreover, it showed the system effectiveness by warning the local team for data completion of the requested area, and reminding the DDC to analyze the laboratory test. The alert massage also set to pop-up when information was missing such as the number identification. This function helped a local team and care provider not to miss typing patient information. The GPS pointed out the demographical data in the event case. The program sent a report back to DDC and region health office in the csv format. Fig. 2 displays the items and functions in the ESMS report module as the dashboard style. All reports from each hospital using this program can successfully sent directly to the provincial public health office, but fail to deliver to National Health Society Organization (NHSO) due to the new data format.
