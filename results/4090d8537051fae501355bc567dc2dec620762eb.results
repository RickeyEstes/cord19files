Terms initially searched a total of 108 articles. After we removed duplicates, checked the title and abstract, and reviewed full-text, eight studies 3-10 eventually met the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. As of February 25, 2020, a total of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 46248 participants were included in our meta-analysis. As presented in Table 1 , the median age was 46.0 years and 23871 (51.6%) were men. The result of this meta-analysis showed the most prevalent clinical symptom was fever ( 91±3, 95% CI 86-97% ), followed by cough (67±7, 95% CI 59-76%), fatigue ( 51±0, 95% CI 34-68% ) and dyspnea ( 30±4, 95% CI 21-40% ). However, the I 2 varying from 84.9% to 96.4% in the evaluates of the clinical features showed significant statistic heterogeneity (p=0.00). The prevalence of comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular diseases. As shown in Figure 2 (inserts A, B, C, D), the most prevalent comorbidity were hypertension ( 17±7, 95% CI 14-22% ) and diabetes ( 8±6, 95% CI 6-11% ),followed by cardiovascular diseases ( 5±4, 95% CI 4-7% ) and respiratory system disease( 2±0, 95% CI 1-3% ). In analysis by the proportion of comorbidities, the significant heterogeneity observed for estimates of hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (p=0.000), but not respiratory system disease (p=0.126) with an I 2 index ranging from 39.9 to 87.5%. In Figure 3 , we analyzed the relationship between complications and severe group and Non-severe group. A higher risk of with hypertension, respiratory system disease, and cardiovascular diseases in the severe group compared to those in Non-severe, the result were (OR 2.36, 95% CI: 1.46-3.83), (OR 2.46, 95% CI: 1.76-3.44) and (OR 3.42, 95% CI: 1.88-6.22)respectively. They showed low heterogeneity, with I 2 from 0 to 39.3 %. However, it was not a statistically significant difference in diabetes, (OR 2.07, 95% CI: 0.89-4.82).
