Rev-NoLS requires two arginine residues for strict nucleolar access during HIV-1 production Rev mutations lacking four amino acid residues from the NLS C-terminal end ( 48 RQRQ 51 ) were previously demonstrated to maintain nucleolar localization pattern in COS-7 cell lines; deletion mutations that extended three residues upstream ( 45 WRERQRQ 51 ) exhibited nucleolar mislocalization. 34 We replicated these nucleolar mutations and examined localization pattern in the presence of HIV production. Rev-NoLS mutations containing amino acid deletions or single-point substitutions of each arginine residue within NoLS-45 WRERQRQ 51 -were generated and fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Rev-EGFP fusion variants were examined for intracellular localization pattern within Rev-deficient HIV-1 HXB2 during proviral production (HLfB, Fig. 1 ). Localization pattern of Rev-EGFP fusion variants was also examined in the absence of viral production (HeLa, Supplementary Fig. S1 ; Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/aid). Rev-NoLS maintaining two arginine residues after deletion (M8-DRQ) or glycine substitution (M4-R46G, M5-R48G, and M6-R50G) remained strictly nucleolar in pattern as WT Rev (Fig. 1A ) during viral production. In the absence of HIV-1, the nucleolar patterns of M4, M5, M6, and M8 were similar, however, included subnuclear distribution outside the nucleolus ( Supplementary Fig. S1A ).
