A total of 48 patients undergoing cancer treatment agreed to participate in the study, totaling 104 episodes with fever and/or respiratory symptoms. The median age was 12 Â± 5.1 years, and the youngest patient was 1 year old. The A respiratory viral pathogen was obtained in 50% (52/104) of the analyzed cases for at least one type of respiratory virus. HRV was the most common pathogen, found in 23.1% (24/105) of infectious episodes (Table 2) . The analysis of 104 samples by rapid test for IFA (indirect fluorescent antibody), IFAH 1 N 1 , and IFB (monoclonal antibody pools, one specific for type A influenza viruses and one specific for type B influenza viruses, are provided for use in IFA assays) resulted in six samples positive for influenza virus (four influenza A and two influenza B). Regarding the number of viruses, 51 cases (49%) had one type. The number of cases of co-detection of respiratory viruses was 17% (18/104) with two, and 3% (3/104) with three; the most frequently observed were rhinovirus and coronavirus 43 ( Table 3) . The presence of fever and respiratory virus positivity was observed in 17.6% of the episodes (p = 0.332), with at least one peak of fever in 41 (39.4%), and respiratory symptoms in 53 (51%) cases, at the time of the consultation. Statistical significance was found between the presence of fever and severe neutropenia in the analyzed episodes (p < 0.001). Among the severe neutropenic cases, 30.7% (4/13) were positive for some type of respiratory virus, two with respiratory syncytial virus A and B, one with coronavirus 229, and one with rhinovirus. However, when considering the mild to moderate neutropenic cases (5.9%), there was no statistical association (p = 0.169). It was observed that the majority of cases had only mild respiratory symptoms, in 38.4% (20/52). Of the 33 blood cultures collected, three (9.1%) were positive, and the bacterial pathogens associated with febrile episode were: one case of Klebsiella pneumoniae, one case of multi-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and one case of Gram-negative bacilli. Of the 104 episodes studied, empirical antibiotic therapy was case of in 36 (34.2%) cases. Of the patients with respiratory viral infection, none had positive blood or urine culture, and 34.6% (18/52) received antibiotic therapy. A total of 102 episodes were analyzed regarding the hematological characteristics, with leukopenia observed in 23.5% (24/102) of patients, neutropenia in 20.5% (21/102), and severe neutropenia in 16.7% (17/102), of which 52.9% of patients had ALL. Lymphopenia was present in 41% (42/102) cases. It was also observed that 30.6% (30/102) of patients had anemia and 11.7% (12/102) had thrombocytopenia. Although it was observed that 99% (103/104) of patients had good general health status, hypothermia was observed in 15% (16/104) and anemia in 43% (44/104) of the sample. Only one individual had a clinical picture of bacteremia; however, no deaths were attributed to the studied episodes. Regarding the epidemiology of the ARI episode, it was observed that most patients had no previous history of contact with ARIs (8/104). Although not statistically significant (p = 0.282), the correlations between the total number of virus positive patients versus season were 7.7% (8/104) for summer, 18.3% (19/104) for spring, 32.7% (34/104) for winter, and 41.3% (43/104) for fall.
