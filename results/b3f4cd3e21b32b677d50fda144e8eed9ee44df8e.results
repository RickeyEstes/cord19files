High-dose Zn prevents diarrhea in piglets but does not affect other trace elements and virus shedding TGEV infection caused only mild symptoms and there was no difference in dehydration, anorexia, lethargy and body temperature when the different Zn treatment groups were compared. However, the body weight in Zn high was higher at 7, 14 and 18 dpi in comparison to both other groups ( Figure 1A) . Furthermore, the fecal score from 2 to 7 dpi was also higher in Zn high compared to the Zn low control group ( Figure 1B ). Serum and liver Zn concentrations were higher in the Zn high group as compared to the Zn med and Zn low groups, but other trace elements were not affected. In addition, there was an increased Zn, manganese and iron concentration, but decreased copper concentration, in both liver and serum from 1 to 18 dpi (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Low amounts of shedding TGEV could be detected by qPCR from 1 to 6 dpi, irrespective of Zn feeding group. The highest incidence was observed at 4 dpi with 4 out of 10 positive TGEV shedding piglets in each group. Figure 2 shows the systemic and mucosal immune responses of piglets as measured by ELISA. At the time of challenge, all piglets fed with different concentrations of Zn were negative for TGEV-specific serum IgG antibodies. The serum antibody response after infection occurred earlier in Zn high piglets and was measurable already at 7 dpi, when all piglets from this group tended to develop higher (P = 0.06) TGEV-specific serum Figure 1 Body weight and fecal score of TGEV-infected piglets. Piglets fed with Zn low , Zn med and Zn high were orally infected with TGEV. (A) Body weight was recorded at given time points and (B) fecal scores (from 1 to 5, where 1 means watery and 5 hard and dry stool) were recorded daily after infection. Boxes indicate medians (n = 10) (horizontal lines) and the lower and upper quartiles (bottoms and tops of the boxes). The vertical bars in the box plots indicate the minimal and maximal values recorded. Asterisk indicates statistically significant difference (p â‰¤ 0.05) between the groups. antibody titers than piglets in the Zn low group. At 11 dpi, seroconversion was clearly detectable in almost all animals. Greater antibody levels were detected in Zn med (P = 0.009) and Zn high (P = 0.03) groups compared to the Zn low group at 14 dpi ( Figure 2A ).
