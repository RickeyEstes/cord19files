Histology.-Pathological changes were found in the whole of the nephron as well as in the small blood-vessels. These changes seemed to be at different stages of development in any one area. Patent hypertrophied glomeruli and occluded hyalinised ones were found next to each other, with others showing various degrees of pat,hological change in between. There was a conspicuoils lack of inflammatory cellular infiltration. The regular changes included an increase in the numbers of mesangial and endothelial cells, diminution or obliteration of the lumen of the capillary loops, and an uneven thickening of the P.A.s.-positive basement membranes. The epithelial cells were swollen and the urinary spaces narrowed. Dilated urinary spaces were found only when the glomeruli were collapsed. The membrane of the Bowmans' capsule was unevenly thickened and P.A.s.-positive. These changes were found in various degrees and combinations in different glomeruli, but mostly in the subcapsular cortical region. Pathological changes were also found in the tubules, especially in the cells of the proximal tubules. The cells were in various stages of vacuolar degeneration. The cell boundaries were often lost, and granular material was present in the lumina of the tubules. The basement membranes of the tubular cells were unevenly thickened and P.A.s.-positive. In addition, there were also changes in the extra-glomerular blood-vessels, consisting of uneven thickening of the wall and deposition of P.A.s.-positive material in the tunica media. Ultrastructural changes.-These confirmed and complemented the histopathological findings. There was a mesangial reaction in the glomerulus. The basement membrane was convoluted and grossly thickened, sometimes as much as ten times ( fig. 1 ). Deposits of amorphous, fibrillar, or granular appearance were present, mostly subendothelially and in the membrane ( fig. 1 ). Membrane-bound particles were seen embedded in the basement membrane. It was striking that in some glomeruli, despite pronounced changes in the endothelial cells and the membrane, the foot processes of the epithelial cells (podocytes) looked normal. The Bowman's capsule was also unevenly thickened and contained deposits similar to those of the glomerular membrane. The cells of the tubules showed various degrees of spongiform degeneration (figs. 2 and 3). One important finding was that most of the cells of the tubules were fused with each other (figs. 2
