We analysed the spike protein of SARS-CoV strain Tor2 5 by a PredictProtein program. 37 The protein consists of an SARS-CoV spike protein was analysed for the probability of forming ␣-helical coiled-coil structures by use of the program MultiCoil; 31 sequences are submitted to (http://jura.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/multicoil/multicoil.pl). To predict the conformation of the NP-1/CP-1 complex by homology modelling and docking techniques, we first looked at the sequence alignment of the NP-1 and CP-1 peptides with the corresponding N-peptides and C-peptides of HIV-1 gp41. This analysis showed about 45-50% sequence similarity (figure 1). We used the X-ray crystal structure of the gp41 core structure (pdb code 1env) to build a model of interaction between the SARS-CoV NP-1 and CP-1 peptides as described below. We aligned HIV-1 N-peptide N36 and SARS-CoV N-peptide NP-1, and HIV-1 C-peptide C43 and SARS-CoV Cpeptide CP-1 by use of the program ClustalX. 32 Any insertions and deletions were manually adjusted to avoid gaps in the helix regions. Homology models of each peptide were built by the automated software 1-1199) , a transmembrane domain (residues 1200-1215), and an intracellular domain (residues 1216-1255). A signal peptide (residues 1-13) at the amino-terminus was observed, but no obvious fusogenic peptide sequence was identified. The spike proteins of most coronaviruses (except porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus) are cleavable by cellular proteases to yield S1 (receptor binding) and S2 (virus fusion) subunits. 9,10,12,38 SARS-CoV spike protein does not contain a typical cleavage site (a basic aminoacid sequence-eg, RRFRR, GRHRR, KRRSRR). 9 Therefore, the boundary between the S1 and S2 domains cannot be accurately identified at present. As in other coronavirus spike proteins, the S2 domain has a more conserved sequence than the S1 domain. The latter is a compact globular structure as predicted by the PredictProtein program Globe for prediction of globularity. The S2 domain contains HR1 (residues 892-1013) and HR2 (residues 1145-1194), similar to other class I viral fusion proteins. 9, 13, 39 Analysis by the MultiCoil program 31 showed that the sequences in the HR1 and HR2 regions have a tendency to form trimeric or dimeric helix bundles, consistent with the observation that coronavirus spike proteins are homotrimers or homodimers. 9 Thus, these regions may take part in the oligomerisation and conformational changes of spike protein during virus-cell fusion events. The spike protein of SARS-CoV has only about 24% pairwise aminoacid identity with the corresponding proteins of other coronaviruses, consistent with the observation by Rota and colleagues. 6 However, the identity of their HR1 and HR2 sequences is much higher (table 2), which suggests that the sequences in the HR1 and HR2 regions are more conserved than other sequences in spike protein. Alignments of the peptides derived from the HR1 and HR2 regions of SARS-CoV spike protein and the HIV-1 gp41 revealed high sequence similarity between HIV-1 N-peptide N36 and SARS-CoV N-peptide NP-1 and between HIV-1 C-peptide C43 and SARS-CoV C-peptide CP-1 (45% and 51%, respectively; figure 1 ). Thus, the HR1 and HR2 regions in SARS-CoV spike protein and HIV-1 gp41 may share certain structural and functional features. We have also noticed that most of the residues located at the "a" and "d" positions of the helical wheels are hydrophobic (figure 1; grey boxes) and more conserved than those in the "b", "c", and "f" positions, which are hydrophilic (figure 1; white boxes). This feature suggests that these helices form homologous oligomers by hydrophobic association through "knobs-into-holes" packing interactions at the "a" and "d" positions, in a way similar to interactions between the N-helices in the HIV-1 gp41 core. 18 The residues at the "b", "c", and "f" positions form a hydrophilic face towards the solution, making the oligomeric bundles water soluble. Since the HR1 and HR2 sequences of SARS-CoV spike protein are highly similar to those of HIV-1 gp41, we hypothesised that the HR1 and HR2 domains have similar functions to those of HIV-1 gp41-ie, participating in the viral fusion process. 17,40 Therefore, we designed and synthesised six peptides overlapping the sequences of the HR1 and HR2 regions (table 1; figure 1 ). The peptides range from 34 to 40 aminoacid residues in length. Only Table 3 : Molecular masses of the isolated peptides NP-1 and CP-1 and the NP-1/CP-1 complex measured by sedimentation equilibrium (pH 7·2); NP-1 and other N-peptides had random coil structure in the same solution. When NP-1 was mixed with CP-1 in equimolar concentrations, the ␣-helicity increased ( figure 3) . However, the ␣-helicity did not change when NP-1 was mixed with CP-2, or when CP-1 was mixed with other peptides from HR1. These findings suggest that NP-1 and CP-1 associate to form a complex with ␣-helical conformation. This helical complex is relatively stable in phosphate buffer with a Tm of about 59°C ( figure 3 ). gp41 C-peptides, interacts with a site in the HR1 region and interferes with the conformational change of the spike protein during the viral fusion process. To identify the CP-1 binding site in HR1, we immobilised biotinylated CP-1 on streptavidin sensor chips and searched for the CP-1binding peptides from HR1 region, as determined by surface plasmon resonance with BIACORE. CP-1 strongly bound to NP-1 with a high binding affinity or kinetic dissociation constant (1·62ϫ10 -8 mol/L; figure 2 ), whereas other peptides derived from the HR1 region had very low or no binding activity to CP-1 (data not shown). CP-2, which has a ten-residue shift towards the C-terminus of CP-1 ( figure 1; table 1 ), did not bind to NP-1, which suggests that the N-terminal residues of CP-1 are important for the interaction between NP-1 and CP-1 or that the C-terminal residues in CP-2 interfere with binding between NP-1 and CP-1. Circular-dichroism spectroscopic analysis showed that the peptide CP-1 had a low content of ␣-helicity (with minima at 208 nm and 222 nm) in phosphate buffer We have previously shown by N-PAGE that the HIV-1 gp41 peptides N36 and C34 can interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle. 30 By a similar approach, we investigated whether CP-1 also forms an oligomeric complex with peptides derived from the HR1 region. With the exception of NP-3, N-peptides showed no bands in the gel (figure 4) because they carried net positive charges under the native electrophoresis conditions (table 1) and could therefore have migrated up and off the gel. NP-3 did migrate down in the gel because it has net zero charge, but it showed two bands, perhaps because it has differing conformations. Peptide CP-1 showed a band in the lower part of the gel. The mixture of NP-1 and CP-1 showed two bands: the lower one had the same position as isolated CP-1, and the upper one is expected to be a higher order of oligomeric complex formed by NP-1 and CP-1. To confirm whether this band indeed represents a complex formed between NP-1 and CP-1, we analysed the mixture of NP-1 and biotinylated CP-1 at different ratios by N-PAGE in two gels. One was stained with Coomassie blue ( figure 4, middle gel) . The peptides and their complex in another gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, which was stained with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and its substrate ( figure 4, lower gel) . With increasing concentrations of NP-1, the intensity of upper bands increased and that of the lower bands decreased, which suggests that formation of the upper band depends on the concentration of NP-1 and confirms that the band does not represent aggregates of CP-1. Since the migration speed of a molecule or a complex in N-PAGE depends on both the size and the net charge of the molecule or complex, this method cannot be used to measure exactly the molecular mass of NP-1/CP-1 complex in the gel or to find out whether the lower band of CP-1 is monomer or oligomer. Therefore, we analysed the apparent molecular masses of the peptides NP-1, CP-1, and NP-1/CP-1 complex by sedimentation equilibration, which was successfully used to find out the mass of the six-helix bundle formed by the HIV-1 gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides. 17 The isolated NP-1 was a monomer and the molecular mass obtained for CP-1 corresponded to a trimer in phosphate-buffered saline (table 3). The HPLC-purified mixture of NP-1 and CP-1 showed a complex with a molecular mass of about 24 781 Da (figure 5), which was close to the calculated molecular mass of a trimer of dimers. These results were confirmed by SE-HPLC; NP-1 showed a single peak of monomer and CP-1 a major peak corresponding to a trimer, whereas the mixture of NP-1 and CP-1 showed three peaks corresponding to NP-1 monomer, CP-1 trimer, and NP-1/CP-1 trimer of heterodimer (hexamer) ( figure 6 ). These findings suggest that NP-1 is a monomeric structure and that CP-1 has a trimeric conformation in phosphate-buffered saline. Once they are mixed at equimolar concentration, they interact to form a six-helix bundle consisting of three molecules of NP-1 and three of CP-1. This notion is consistent with the biophysical properties of the HIV-1 gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides as shown by sedimentation equilibration and SE-HPLC. 17, 30, 41 Alignments of the NP-1 and CP-1 peptides on the corresponding HIV-1 gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides revealed reasonable sequence similarities and gave us confidence that a homology model of NP-1 and CP-1 association could be built on the basis of the X-ray crystal structure of the HIV-1 gp41 core formed by the gp41 N-peptides and C-peptides. 18, 19 NP-1 showed a typical coiled-coil structure (figure 7). Most of CP-1 had an ␣-helical conformation with the exception of a kink in the middle of the structure. The structure of the possible complex between these two peptides was then investigated by use of specialised protein-docking software. 35 The residues at the "a" and "d" positions in the NP-1 and CP-1 are hydrophobic. The complex structure formed by the docking technique also shows that there are hydrophobic interactions between these two peptides: eg, L898, I905, F909, I913, and I916 of NP-1 interact very well with L1182, V1171, L1168, I1165, and I1161 of CP-1, respectively. Owing to the lack of crystal coordinates of the sequence beyond the N-terminus of the HIV-1 gp41 peptide C34, 18 the corresponding N-terminal sequence (residues 1153-1159) of CP-1 could not be modelled and its interaction with the corresponding region in the C-terminus of NP-1 could not be predicted.
