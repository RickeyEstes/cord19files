As of August 31, 2009 , there were 221 hospitalized cases of pandemic H1N1 in the Province of Manitoba, Canada, with 11 confirmed deaths and 50 total admissions to the ICU for ventilator support. 28 Of 50 patients, 47 (96%) were confirmed and 3 (4%) were probable by WHO criteria. The average age of patients admitted to the ICU with pandemic H1N1 was 35.5 Ϯ 15.8 years, and most were female (72%). Racial information was available for 66 of 82 (80%) of the pandemic H1N1 cohort, corresponding to 48% aboriginal, 36% white, and 14% other. Admission characteristics for pandemic H1N1 patients are listed in Tables 1 and 2 . Average body mass index was high (34.8 Ϯ 12.0 kg/m 2 ), with the comorbid conditions of diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, asthma, and hypertension occurring in more than one-fifth of the cohort. Eight patients were pregnant at an average term of 25.8 Ϯ 12.3 weeks. Mean APACHE II score and Glasgow Coma Scale were 19 Ϯ 6 and 11.5 (interquartile range, 10-13), respectively. Most patients required vasopressor or inotropic blood pressure support medications (66%), and all required mechanical ventilation. Median creatine kinase value was increased at 325 mol/L (interquartile range, 73-903). Patient outcomes are listed in Table 3 . AKI occurred in 66.7%; acute renal failure, in 66%; and the requirement for dialysis, in 22% of patients with pandemic H1N1. Of 11 patients requiring dialysis after admission to the ICU, 2 (22%) died and 1 (11%) required ongoing dialysis therapy upon discharge. Median length of stay was 16.0 days (interquartile range, , with mortality of 16%. We examined the association between kidney disease and length of stay and mortality in patients with pandemic H1N1 ( Table 4 ). Because of our small sample size, only univariate associations were explored. As expected, the odds of death was substantially higher in those who experienced kidney failure (odds ratio, 11.29; 95% CI, 1.29-98.8) and length of stay was increased in all patients who required dialysis (relative risk, 2.38; 95% CI, 2.13-25.75; data not shown). Key characteristics of patients who experienced a kidney outcome are listed in Table 5 . AKI was more frequent in older patients (38.4 vs 28.7 years; P ϭ 0.02), whereas kidney injury and failure were more common in patients with higher Note: Values expressed as number, mean Ϯ standard deviation, number (interquartile range), or number (percentage). Conversion factor for creatinine in mol/L to mg/dL, ϫ0.0113; no conversion necessary for troponin T in g/L and ng/mL or white blood cell count and platelets in 10 9 /L and 10 3 /L.

By RIFLE criteria, kidney injury is defined as doubling of serum creatinine level or urine output Ͻ0.5 mL/kg/h for 12 hours. Kidney failure is defined as tripling of serum creatinine level or serum creatinine level Ն353.6 mol/L with an acute increase Ͼ44 mol/L or urine output Ͻ0.3 mL/kg/h for 24 hours or anuria for 12 hours. 21 For the kidney injury cohort, patients with chronic kidney disease (n ϭ 2) were excluded.

Again, the requirement for dialysis therapy was associated with an increase in length of ICU stay (P ϭ 0.02). Time courses of AKI and kidney failure, need for dialysis, and death during the first 28 days of admission to the ICU are shown in Fig 1. AKI, kidney failure, and initiation of dialysis therapy occurred within 24 hours of ICU admission in 47.9%, 28%, and 6%, respectively. Most kidney injury and kidney failure occurred within the first 14 days (30 of 32 and 33 of 33 patients, respectively), whereas dialysis requirements peaked at day 28.
