A total of 22 interviews were conducted. These included interviews with 5 physicians, 4 nurses, 3 hospital pharmacists, 2 infection control practitioners, 1 ID consultant, 1 microbiologist and 2 hospital managers representing the three Saudi MoH hospitals. The head of the Infection Control Department and the head of the Pharmaceutical Care Department in the General Directorate of Health Affairs in the Saudi region as well as 1 consultant clinical microbiologist and 1 clinical pharmacist representing the Saudi MoH departments of Infection Control and Pharmaceutical Care were also interviewed. The participants had a median of 9 years of practice (range 2-15 years). Interviews lasted up to 40 min. Details of the participating hospitals are summarised in Table 1 and details of the participants are summarised in Tables 2 and 3 . Several main themes emerged from the interviews, including the current state of ASPs in hospitals as well as barriers to ASP implementation in Saudi MoH hospitals; these were further divided into subthemes. This study suggests that formulary restriction is the main ASP strategy adopted in Saudi MoH hospitals. Furthermore, adoption and implementation of ASPs is hindered by three sets of barriers. First, sociopolitical context barriers, including lack of adherence to guidelines and legislation. Second, healthcare organisation-related barriers such as lack of management support, disintegration, poor communication, lack of recruitment/shortage of ASP team members, lack of education and training, and lack of health information technology (IT). And third, healthcare professionals' barriers relating to their fears and concerns. The following sections provide a detailed description of the emerging themes, which are summarised in Table 4 .
