A total of 210 patients and 71 HCWs were sampled by administering questionnaires to participants in the hospital within the study period. There was 100% response to questionnaire since only patients and HCWs were randomly sampled. The respondents of HCWs were made up of 43 (60.6%) males and 28 (39.4%) female of which the majority were nurses 30 (42.3%) and the least were laboratory technologists 3 (4.2%). Sixty-three (88.7%) of HCWs have heard of HAIs out of which all (100%) defined it as infections acquired in the hospital. Just above half 39 (54.9%) always washed their hands frequently while on duties in the hospital and after work 32 (45.1%) washed sometimes (Table 1) . Spearman's correlation (r) and P-values on knowledge of HAIs and its influence on attitudes of HCWs and patients are shown in Tables 3 and 4 .
