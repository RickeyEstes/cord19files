The exonic arrangement of the two regions of the dystrophin gene under investigation are shown in Figure 1 , indicating exon:intron sequences, intron length, and splice site scores. Both mutations (c.1992 + 1 g>t and c.6614 + 1 g>a) occurred at the invariant first "g" of introns 16 and 45, respectively, ablating the canonical donor splice sites. Splice site scores were determined using the algorithm http://rulai.cshl.edu/new_alt_exon_db2/HTML/ score.html that predicts the maximum 5' donor score as 12.6, with the average score of constitutive exons being 8.1. Hence, the normal exon 16 donor score of 8.0 is average ( Fig. 1A) , while the exon 16 donor splice site mutation lowered the value to À2.7. The normal exon 45 donor splice site (Fig. 1B ) score of 7.1 was marginally below average, and the mutation reduced the value to À3.6. Dystrophin exon 16 is flanked by introns of 7.6 and 20.3 kb, whereas exon 45 is flanked by introns of 248.4 and 36.1 kb. Cells from the two patients, DMD-16ss and DMD-45ss, were propagated and RNA extracted to assess the consequences of these mutations on the mature dystrophin gene transcript. RT-PCR across exons 12-17 (DMD-16ss) produced either no signal or sporadic amplicons of various lengths (Fig. 1C) , while amplification across exons 41 to 47 (DMD-45ss) resulted in no product (data not shown).
