We enrolled 100 subjects in group 1 and 101 subjects in group 2 between November 2009 and August 2011 in St Louis, Missouri. There were greater proportions of men and subjects who ever smoked cigarettes in group 1 than group 2 ( Table 1) , and there were no gender differences in group 2 (data not shown). Heart disease was reported by 77.6% and lung disease was reported by 65.3% of group 1 patients. Illnesses were reported and assessed in all calendar quarters, and the largest numbers of illnesses occurred between the fourth quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2012, Group 1 patients were at least 60 years of age with underlying chronic lung or heart disease. Group 2 patients were healthy and aged 18-40 years. Group 2 patients could not have a medical history of underlying heart and lung disease. Comparisons of categoric variables by chi-square tests. Characteristics did not differ between male and female patients in group 2 (data not shown). CLDSI ¼ Chronic Lung Disease Severity Index; NA ¼ not available; SD ¼ standard deviation. *P < .0001, greater proportion of male patients in group 1 than group 2. †The CLDSI score was determined only in group 1 patients. ‡Patients with underlying lung disease could have >1 pulmonary diagnosis based on reported history and medical record review. §P < .0001, greater proportion of patients who ever smoked cigarettes in group 1 than in group 2. when the numbers of patients being followed were highest ( Figure 1A ). Incidence rates for all illnesses were highest in the first quarter of 2010, fourth quarters of 2010 and 2011, and second quarter of 2012. Incidence rates overall were lowest in the second and third quarters of 2010 and third quarter of 2012 ( Figure 1B) . Coronavirus-associated illnesses were not detected in the third quarter of 2010 and 2012 ( Figure 1B) . The decrease in the number of illnesses during the last 4 quarters of the study was most likely due to the fewer number of patients being actively followed. Of 74 illnesses in 38 subjects in group 1 and 121 illnesses in 59 subjects in group 2, 29 (39.1%) and 59 (48.7%) were virus associated, respectively. Coronaviruses were identified by serologic change or nucleic acid detection in 14 (48.3%) of 29 virus-associated (18.9% of 74 total) illnesses in group 1 and 26 (44.1%) of 59 virus-associated (21.5% of 121 total) illnesses in group 2 without gender differences. HCoV-OC43 was the most common. Of the 40 coronavirusassociated illnesses in groups 1 and 2, 13 had a >3-fold increase in antibody titer (serologic change) to more than 1 coronavirus strain. In group 1, 9 illnesses had a serologic change to only 1 coronavirus strain: 3 to HCoV-229E, 3 to HCoV-OC43, 2 to HCoV-NL63, and 1 to HCoV-HKU1. In group 1, 5 illnesses had a serologic change to more than 1 coronavirus strain: 2 to both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, which were also HCoV-OC43 RT-PCR positive; 1 to both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63; 1 to HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, which was also HCoV-OC43 RT-PCR positive; and 1 to HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. In group 2, 3 illnesses were HCoV-OC43 RT-PCR positive without a serologic change, and 18 illnesses had a serologic change to only 1 coronavirus strain: 3 to HCoV-229E, 7 to HCoV-OC43, 5 to HCoV-NL63, and 3 to HCoV-HKU1. In group 2, 8 illnesses had a serologic change to more than 1 coronavirus strain: 3 to both HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1; 2 to both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, of which 1 was also HCoV-HKU1 RT-PCR positive; 1 to HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1; and 2 to HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. There were co-infections in 10 illnesses, 9 with and 1 without a coronavirus detected. In addition to coronavirus, another virus was associated with 2 illnesses in group 1 (both enterovirus/rhinovirus) and 7 illnesses in group 2 (1 with Figure 1 Acute respiratory illnesses evaluated by calendar quarter. (A) Shown are the numbers of enrolled study subjects who were being actively followed in the study for acute respiratory illnesses by calendar quarter and the numbers of illnesses, in association with viral infection or not, with onset during each calendar quarter. (B) Shown are the numbers of enrolled subjects who were being actively followed in the study for acute respiratory illnesses by calendar quarter when more than 20 subjects were actively enrolled. The incidence rates of acute respiratory illness, calculated as illnesses per patient per year, are shown by calendar quarter and association with viral infection or not. Comparisons of categoric variables were by 2sided Fisher exact test. The "All Illnesses" line includes the 95% confidence interval of the incidence rate for each calendar quarter. a P < .05, incidence of illnesses not associated with a virus infection was highest in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2010 and first quarter of 2011. b P < .05, incidence of illnesses not associated with a virus infection was higher in the first quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter of 2012. c P < .05, incidence of illnesses associated with all virus infections was highest in the second quarter of 2012 compared with the first and third quarters of 2012. d P < .05, e P < .05, incidence of all illnesses was higher in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the second and third quarters of 2010. f P < .05, incidence of all illnesses was higher in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2010. g P < .05, incidence of all illnesses was higher in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the first quarter of 2012. h P < .05, incidence of all illnesses was higher in the second quarter of 2012 compared with the third quarter of 2012. Among illnesses not associated with coronavirus in group 1 patients, enterovirus/rhinovirus was detected in 12 illnesses, and respiratory syncytial virus, metapneumovirus, and adenovirus were each detected in 1 illness (total illnesses ¼ 15). Among illnesses not associated with coronavirus in group 2 patients, enterovirus/rhinovirus was detected in 30 illnesses, parainfluenza and enterovirus/rhinovirus were detected in 1 illness, and parainfluenza and adenovirus were separately detected in 1 illness each (total illnesses ¼ 33) ( Table 2) . Thus, enterovirus/rhinoviruses were detected in the majority of illnesses with virus infections implicated that were not associated with coronaviruses. At illness onset, the majority of patients reported at least 6 symptoms of respiratory illness (group 1: 51 [68.9%] and group 2: 74 [61.2%] illnesses). The 6 most common symptoms at onset in both groups were nasal congestion, cough, sore throat, headache, malaise, and sputum production. Group 1 patients were significantly more likely to experience 9 to 11 symptoms at illness onset than the younger subjects, but male and female patients did not differ within group 2 ( Table 2) . The maximum symptom severity was often mild to moderate; however, the more common the symptom, the greater the proportion of illnesses with a moderate to severe grade ( Figure 2) . The frequency of symptoms and distribution of severity grades were similar for illnesses associated with coronavirus only compared with a grouping combining illnesses with a coronavirus alone and coronavirus with another co-infecting virus. Dyspnea, including moderate to severe grades, was more common in group 1 compared with group 2 for coronavirus-associated infections ( (Figure 2A, B) . Among group 1 patients, myalgia was less common in patients with a coronavirusassociated illness than in patients with a noncoronavirus viral infection (Figure 2A) . Myalgia was also less common in group 1 than group 2 patients with coronavirus-associated illness (3 [21%] of 14 vs 17 [68%] of 25 illnesses, P < .01). Fever was uncommon in both groups. Nasal congestion was reported by 84% to 100% of patients. Among group 2 patients, cough was more frequent during illnesses without an identified virus infection than among coronavirusassociated illnesses (Figure 2) . Sore throat and headache were more common in group 2 patients compared with group 1 patients with noncoronavirus viral infections (sore throat, 26 (Figure 2) . Among group 1 patients, the mean Chronic Lung Disease Severity Index indicated less severe symptoms at the enrollment visit than at the acute illness visits considering all illnesses (14.4 AE 4.2 vs 17.1 AE 4.9, P < .0001) and did not improve at the follow-up illness visit (17.2 AE 4.6). The mean *P < .05, greater proportion of group 1 patients who had 9 to 11 symptoms at onset of illness for illnesses without a virus identified and for all illnesses (virus identified or not), respectively, than group 2 patients. index was higher at the acute than the follow-up illness visit for coronavirus-associated illnesses (18.0 AE 4.8 and 15.9 AE 4.3). The mean symptoms and signs scores at the acute illness visits were significantly greater than at the follow-up illness visits in both groups 1 and 2 for both virus-and nonvirus-associated illnesses. The mean symptoms and signs score and the mean visual analogue scale of overall illness severity were significantly higher at the follow-up illness visit for group 1 than group 2 ( Table 3) . Mean symptoms and signs scores at the acute illness visit for group 2 female patients were higher than for male patients, but statistical significance was achieved only in the case of mean scores for all illnesses ( Table 3 ). The duration of illness is not available because this was not an outcome measure. Especially in the group 1 patients, underlying respiratory symptoms at baseline changed during acute illness but did not resolve, so that end of acute illness was difficult to pinpoint. The symptom scores suggest that illnesses in group 1 patients as a group had not returned to baseline at the convalescent 3-to 4-week follow-up illness visit. Among group 1 patients, 1 was hospitalized for respiratory symptoms approximately 2 weeks after an acute respiratory illness during which no virus was detected, 1 was hospitalized for pneumonia but did not undergo study evaluation at that time, and 1 died without recent acute respiratory illness reported. One group 2 patient died in a motor vehicle accident. Proportions of illnesses for which 1 or more new medications were taken as treatment were similar in group 1 (47.9% of illnesses) and group 2 (46.3% of all illnesses; Figure 2 The number of illnesses with each symptom and the maximum symptom severity during each illness are shown by severity grade (mild, moderate or severe), subject age group, and association of illness with viral infection or not. Data for maximum severity were not available for 1 illness in group 1 and 11 illnesses in group 2. The height of each vertical bar is the number of illnesses with that symptom. The percentage of illnesses with that symptom is plotted with each vertical bar, respectively. Comparisons of categoric variables were by 2-sided Fisher exact test. (A) Maximum systemic illness symptoms in group 1, chronically ill, older adults aged !60 years. a P < .01, myalgias were more common in patients with viral infection other than coronaviruses compared with illnesses with a coronavirus infection. Comparisons of continuous variables by Student t test. *P < .05, †P < .01, mean score was higher at acute than follow-up visit. ‡P < .0001, mean score was higher at acute than follow-up visit comparing acute illness with follow-up time points within each age and etiologic group, respectively. §P < .0001, mean score at follow-up visit was higher in group 1 than group 2, comparing group 1 with group 2 for each illness cause category, respectively. kP < .0001, ¶P < .05, mean score at acute illness visit was higher than at follow-up visit, comparing acute illness with follow-up time points within each age and illness etiologic group, respectively. #P < .05, **P < .001, mean score was higher at follow-up visit in group 1 than group 2, respectively. † †P < .05, mean score at acute illness visit in group 2 was higher in female than male patients. Table 4) . Prednisone was more commonly prescribed for illnesses in group 1 than group 2 patients, particularly with coronavirus and other virus-associated illnesses, and antibiotics were more commonly prescribed in group 1 than group 2 patients during illnesses, whether virus associated or not (Table 4) , without differences by gender in group 2. Group 1 patients who were prescribed prednisone had underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, or asthma, but the clinician's reason for prescribing prednisone was not recorded in the study database. Only 1 patient received an antiviral (oseltamivir).
