IgG concentration. Serum IgG concentrations at 0 h, 48 h, 72 h and 168 h post birth in dairy and beef calves are shown in Table 1 . There was a significant effect of breed (P < 0.05) sampling time (P < 0.0001) and breed × sampling time interaction (P < 0.0001) for serum IgG concentrations. As expected, at 0 h, prior to the first feed of colostrum, baseline serum IgG concentrations were lower (P < 0.0001) compared with all other sampling times. In LF calves, serum IgG concentrations were greater (P < 0.001) compared to dairy calves at 48, 72 and 168 h post-birth and were not different from CL, except at 168 h when concentrations were lower in CL compared with LF. Colostrum IgG concentrations (mean (SD)) were not different across the three cow breed types (H; 63.1 (14. Table 2 . Lists of all DEG found in each comparisons are shown in Supplementary Tables 1-7. RNAseq data from the current study are available on NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus through GEO Series accession number GSE114432. Pathway analysis across all comparisons. Over enriched networks in dairy calves over the first 168 h post birth. Comparisons of dairy calves at 0 h, 48 h, 72 h and 168 h, were examined for the presence of enriched molecular and cellular functional networks, physiological system developmental networks, and for the presence of biologically interesting canonical pathways, which are shown in Table 2 . The top enriched pathway in the comparison of 0 h calves to those sampled at 48 h was the role of pattern recognition receptor in recognition of bacteria and viruses, in which enriched genes were present at higher levels of abundance in the 0 h samples. The complement system pathway was also enriched in the comparison, with the majority of the genes present at higher levels in the 48 h calves than in the 0 h. Enriched networks included 'Post translational modification' (Network 1) and 'Immunological disease' (Network 2, Fig. 1 ). Comparison of the transcriptomic profile of calves aged 168 h to those sampled at 72 h highlighted 1l-8 signalling as the most enriched canonical pathway, with the majority of genes present at lower levels in the 168 h calves than in the 72 h. Networks of interest included 'Cell signalling, Molecular transport, Vitamin and mineral transport' (Network 3), and 'Cellular development, Cellular growth and Proliferation' (Network 4). On investigation of any upstream effects of DEG enriched in the comparison of 168 h and 72 h dairy calves, we identified inhibition of a growth factor at 168 h, TGFβ1. Additionally, inhibition of a transmembrane receptor, EPOR, was identified as −5.487 times lower in the 168 h calves, with 22 out of the proposed 366 genes involved in its upstream regulation present in the DEG list. Table 2 . Firstly, biologically interesting pathways were investigated within the CL crossbred calves. Comparison of 48 h to 0 h CL calves resulted in 2095 DEG, 1766 of which were successfully mapped in IPA. Biologically interesting enriched molecular, cellular and physiological networks included cellular movement, immune cell trafficking, and lymphoid tissue structure and development. Top enriched canonical pathways included cholesterol biosynthesis, which was upregulated in the 48 h old calves, the complements system, also upregulated at 48 h, and two interleukin signalling pathways, 1l-9 and Il-12 in which the majority of genes were present at higher levels after 48 h. Investigating upstream analysis effector genes identified a number of significantly altered upstream regulators including a number of growth factors (Areg, Hgf, VEGFA), cytokines (c5f2, PRL, IFNa2), and also the Fc gamma receptor upstream pathway activated in the CL calves at 48 h. Supplementary  Fig. 10 shows activation of transmigration of cells with many immunologically important receptors highlighted as included cellular movement, immune cell trafficking and also cellular function and maintenance. There were no canonical pathways identified as significantly enriched in the comparison. Overall a major stabilization of the immune response was evident through the inhibition of a number of immune related regulators ( Supplementary  Fig. 11 ). The LF calves were also compared across the four time points (0 h, 48 h, 72 h and 168 h) to investigate the development of immunocompetence during the first week of life. Similarly high levels of DEG were evident at the early timepoint comparison of 48 h versus 0 h, with 2021 DEG identified in total, with 1640 of these being successfully mapped in IPA. Top enriched molecular and cellular networks included cellular movement, cellular function and maintenance; immune cell trafficking, and lymphoid tissue structure and development. A number of upstream regulators including a large number of cytokines (TNFα, Il1β, IFN), transmembrane receptors (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR9) exhibited activation in the 48 h calves compared to 0 h. LF calves were then compared at 168 h versus 72 h to identify observable alterations to key genes and pathways involved in the development of immunocompetence. Overall there were 1897 DEG identified, with 1562 being successfully mapped using IPA for functional analysis. The vast majority of total DEG, 1362 out of 1897, were present at lower levels in the 168 h calves, highlighting the stabilization on the initial surge in immune gene expression. A number of biologically interesting networks were enriched in pathway analysis of the 168 h and 72 h calves, including network 14 mapping enrichment of immune cell trafficking and the inflammatory response, of which the majority of genes are present at lower levels of expression by 168 h (Supplementary Fig. 12 ). Network 23 however, humoral immune response, showed upregulation of a number of genes in the 168 h calves (See Fig. 2) . A significant number of upstream gene regulators including cytokines (Il1α, IFNγ, Il1P, OSM), and immune regulatory complexes (MAP2K1, NFκB) were inhibited by 168 h. (ii) Comparison of CL calves to LF calves across time: In order to investigate any differences in the development of a competent immune response during the first week of life in the two beef crossbreeds, the breeds were compared at each time point. Only the 48 h timepoint comparison generated a significant number of DEG, 716 in total, 594 of which were mapped for functional analysis using IPA. A number of interesting networks were highlighted as being enriched in the comparison of 48 h, including network 5, antimicrobial response, in which the majority of the genes were present at lower levels in the CL calves (Fig. 3 ). Figure 4 highlights variations in the overall immune response of cells showing inhibition in the CL calves at 48 h compared to the LF breed. Biologically important upstream regulators were also identified as being significantly differentially expressed in the comparison of beef CL to LF, including NFκB and Il12 complexes, both inhibited in CL calves compared to LF at 48 h. A number of immunologically important upstream regulators were also inhibited in the beef CL calves, including CD40LG, the cytokine that binds to CD40 ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ).
