Concept of the fragment-warhead activation assay. The envisaged fragment-warhead activation assay is based on the idea that a templated ligation reaction of a protein-binding fragment with an electrophilic warhead should lead to the accelerated irreversible inhibition of the protein, if a reactive protein nucleophile is present (Fig. 1) . In this concept, a nucleophilic small-molecule fragment binds to a binding site of a protein (Fig. 1a, step 1) . The protein-binding fragment undergoes a reversible ligation reaction with a bis-electrophilic protein-reactive group (warhead) 21, 22 (step 2). The ligation reaction thereby positions the second reactive electrophilic functionality of the warhead at the active site of the protein inducing an irreversible, covalent reaction of the active-site nucleophile with the warhead (step 3) resulting in the irreversible deactivation of the protein. The described reaction sequence enables the testing of combinations of nucleophilic fragments and electrophilic warheads in a biochemical assay and inhibitory fragment combinations detected in this 'warhead activation assay' are blueprints for the construction of potent irreversible enzyme inhibitors. Selection of the protein target. As a protein target, the 3C protease of Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3 3C protease) was selected 23, 24 . Coxsackie viruses are members of the large genus of enteroviruses, representing uncoated positive-strand RNA viruses of the picornavirus family and causing numerous human diseases including meningitis, myocarditis and diarrhea [25] [26] [27] [28] . The genus Enterovirus comprises numerous human pathogens, including rhinoviruses, polioviruses, echoviruses and other humaninfecting viruses like EV-A71 and EV-B93 (refs 26,29,30) . Coxsackie virus 3C protease, like other enteroviral proteases, is a cysteine protease with a characteristic specificity for glutamine in the P1 position of its substrates (Fig. 1b) . Thus, for this target, fragments binding to the S1 pocket are biomimetics of the glutamine side chain, while the active-site nucleophile is the thiolate of cysteine 147 (Cys-147). Development of warhead activation assay. Several bis-electrophiles were considered as warheads for the warhead activation assay. Enantiomerically pure ethyl (2S,3S)-epoxy-4-oxo-butanoate 1 was selected and prepared from commercially available ethyl 4-oxo-but-(2E)-enoate 31 . This warhead contains both an aldehyde and an epoxide functionality as electrophilic reaction sites for the ligation with a protein-binding, nucleophilic fragment and the irreversible alkylation reaction with the active-site cysteine of the protease. The 2,3-trans-epoxysuccinyl structure is derived from the natural cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 and has been recognized as a privileged reactive warhead targeting cysteine proteases [32] [33] [34] Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 1 a b Figure 1 | Concept of the fragment-warhead activation assay. (a) Proteintemplated, covalent assembly of an irreversible inhibitor of a cysteine protease: reversible binding of a nucleophilic fragment (Nu ¼ nucleophile) to the S1-site (step 1) positions the bis-electrophilic warhead 1 in a templated dynamic reaction at the active site of the protein (step 2), leading to irreversible inhibition of the protein (step 3). In the case that Nu is an amine nucleophile (Nu ¼ NHR), an imine intermediate instead of the depicted hemiaminal may be formed. (b) The active site of an enterovirus 3C protease with a bound peptide substrate containing a glutamine residue (Gln, Q) in P1 position occupying the S1 pocket of the enzyme. alone was investigated as an inhibitor of the 3C protease of Coxsackie virus B3 (Fig. 2) . Employing an enzymatic protease assay with a substrate containing a fluorescence-resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair, fragment 1 was identified as a weak, irreversible inhibitor of the CVB3 3C protease with a relative inactivation rate (k inact /K I -value) of 2.4±0.1 M À 1 s À 1 . This inactivation rate corresponded to an apparent half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of 4 41 mM after 10 min (Fig. 2b , Table 1 ). The covalent mode of action was confirmed by electrospray ionization high-resolution ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) measurements. Incubation of the protease with warhead 1 shifted the main deconvoluted mass peak of the protein from 21,471.5 to 21,588.5 Da and the observed protein mass difference of 117 Da corresponded well with the molecular weight of bis-electrophile 1 after hydrolysis of the ethyl ester. Next, a fragment ligation assay was conducted to identify nucleophilic fragments inducing the deactivation of the protein through a ligation reaction with fragment 1. For this purpose, a concentration of fragment 1 was determined, which decreased the activity of the protease by B10% over a time period of 10 min. This level of inhibition was used to ascertain the maximal sensitivity of the assay. A small library of 850 primary amine fragments, composed by applying a substructure analysis of the World Drug Index 35 , was screened in the fragment ligation assay. Fragment 2, 5-amino-1-cycloheptyl-1,2-dihydropyrazol-3-one (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 1 ), displayed the strongest overadditive effect of inhibition of protease activity. While fragments 1 or 2 alone reduced the enzyme's activity by no more than 10%, the protease was inhibited completely by a combination of 1 and 2 at the same concentrations (Fig. 3b) . Incubation of the protease with mixtures of 1 (1.2 equiv.) and 2 (1 equiv.) led to a concentration-dependent deactivation of the enzyme with an apparent IC 50 value of ca. 200 mM and a k inact /K I of 8.3 ± 0.6 M À 1 s À 1 (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Deconvolution of the ESI-MS of the protease after ligation with a mixture of both fragments 1 and 2 showed the modification of the protein mass by addition of both fragments (144 þ 195 ¼ 339 Da) as the major mass peak (100% intensity, see Fig. 3c ). For comparison, the mass peak for the remaining unmodified protein displayed only 12% intensity and that of the protein coupled to the bis-electrophile 1 alone ca. 8%, supporting the assumption that the protein modification was strongly amplified by the presence of fragment 2. Incubation of the mutated protease C147A (ref. 36) did not display any modification in MS, indicating a selective alkylation of the active site. Compound number k inact /K I (M À 1 s À 1 ) The ligation reaction of fragments 1 and 2 was analysed by HPLC/MS with and without the protein target present ( Supplementary Fig. 2) . Several different addition products of 1 and 2 were formed according to mass analysis and retention times and two of these products had the additive mass of both fragments, which had been observed in the deconvoluted MS of the protein sample reacted with both fragments. This formation of several different addition products of 1 and 2 is in agreement with the reported reactivity of 5-amino-1,2-dihydropyrazol-3ones, which were found to react with electrophiles at both the exocyclic amino group, the carbonyl oxygen and in the carbon-4 position 37, 38 . The product ratio varied strongly depending on the solvent and presence/absence of the protein target. Isolation of the formed ligation products by preparative column chromatography furnished again mixtures of compounds, indicating that they were formed reversibly in an equilibrium reaction. To evaluate the potential of the various ligation products as inhibitors, possible fragment combinations were generated in silico and docked 39 into the active site. Docking poses were selected according to their ability to bind and react in a similar manner as observed in PDB entry 3ZZA representing the crystal structure of CV3B 3C protease. In particular, two criteria were applied: (i) the hydrogen-bonding pattern between the lactam moiety of the co-crystallized ligand, and His-161 and Thr-142 in the S1 pocket had to be fulfilled by the docked poses for a plausible position in the binding site and (ii) the distance of cysteine sulfur and the potentially covalently binding electrophile of the ligation product had to be in a reasonable range for subsequent covalent binding (Supplementary Table 2 ). Docking of fragment 2 suggested that 2 can bind to the S1 pocket of the protease occupying the position of the primary amide of the native glutamine residue (Fig. 3d) . Sampling the various reaction paths of the electrophile 1 with the nucleophilic positions of fragment 2 supported the best fit for a nucleophilic attack by the carbon-4 ring position (Fig. 3e ). According to our docking experiments, the putative reaction product, a secondary alcohol, can be positioned in the active site of the protein and can be attacked by Cys-147 resulting in the opening of the epoxide ring and the formation of the covalent protein modification (Fig. 3f ). Fragment-based inhibitor design. Based on the observation that fragment 2 is a potent activator of bis-electrophile 1 inducing the assembly of an irreversible protease inhibitor, a set of fragment combinations was designed, varying the chemical nature and the attachment of the protein-reactive electrophile (Fig. 4 , Table 1,  Supplementary Table 1 ). Trans-epoxide 3 was a moderately active irreversible inhibitor of the protease (k inact /K I ¼ 3.7 M À 1 s À 1 ), while trans-epoxide 4 was a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme. Cis-epoxide 5 was inactive as expected, so was the naphtyl-1-methyl amide 6, which was designed according to a recent report 40 . Increased reactivity with the protease was observed, when alternative electrophiles were linked to the primary fragment 2. While the acrylic ester derivative 7 was only a weak irreversible inhibitor with k inact /K I to 0.4 M À 1 s À 1 , the ethyl fumaroyl electrophile in 8, containing also a trans-olefine, raised the relative inactivation rate to 132 M À 1 s À 1 , more than 60-fold than the initial electrophile 1. The same electrophile, an N-fumaroyl ester, was inactive in the 5-amino position as shown by compound 9. Converting the stereochemistry at the double bond of 9 furnished the N-maleoyl ester 12 displaying an impressive inactivation rate of 606 M À 1 s À 1 . To assure that the inhibition of 12 was effected by the amino-pyrazolone fragment, the unsubstituted maleoyl amide ester 13 was prepared and found to be only moderately active (34 M À 1 s À 1 ). Transformation of the ethyl ester 12 to the ethyl amide 14 reduced the inactivation rate by 10-fold (63 M À 1 s À 1 ). The maleoyl-diamide 15 was fully inactive. Further enhancement of the inactivation was accomplished by trans-vinyl sulfone 20 displaying the maximal inactivation rate of 1,008 M À 1 s À 1 . Broad-spectrum inhibitors of viral 3C proteases. Three of the most potent inhibitors of CBV 3C protease derived of the S1-binding amino-pyrazolone fragment 2, maleoyl ester 12, maleoyl-diamide 14 and vinyl sulfone 20 were tested towards a panel of six additional rhinoviral and enteroviral 3C proteases, equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV-1), human rhinovirus A49 (HRV-A49), human enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), Aichi virus 1 (AiV-1), porcine sapelovirus 1 (PSV-1) and human enterovirus B93 (EV-B93) at protein inhibitor stoichiometries of 1:1 and 1:3 (Fig. 5) . Inhibitors 12 and 20 under these conditions strongly reduced the activity of all six proteases investigated, with 20 being generally more potent than 12. All compounds, 12, 14 and 20, showed the highest inhibition for EV-B93 and both 14 and 20 fully inhibited the enzyme even at one inhibitor equivalent. For 12 and 14, the inhibitory activity decreased for EV-B934PSV-14ERBV-14AiV-14EV-D684HRV-A49. IC 50 values of the most active compounds were determined by incubation of a fixed enzyme concentration for 3 h with different concentrations of inhibitors 14 and 20 (Table 2 ) and the most potent inhibitor, compound 20, showed sub-micromolar inhibition for all tested viral proteases, with strongest inhibition for EV-B93, followed by PSV-1, AiV-1, ERBV-1, HRV-A49, and finally HEV-D68, with ERBV-1 being the only protease tested where 12 is more active than 20. Finally, the selectivity of the representative inhibitors 14 and 20 was validated using four proteases possessing nucleophilic aminoacid residue in the active site, namely the serine proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin, and factor Xa and the cysteine protease caspase-3. The four enzymes cover a broad range of S1-preferences, namely for arginine/lysine (trypsin, factor Xa), hydrophobic residues (chymotrypsin) and aspartate (caspase-3). Compound 14 was inactive towards all four proteases (IC 50 4500 mM); compound 20 was inactive towards the three serine proteases (IC 50 4500 mM) and revealed very low inhibition of the cysteine protease caspase-3 (IC 50 4300 mM) (Supplementary Table 3 ). Structure of EV-B93 3C protease with inhibitor 14. Compounds 12, 14 and 20 were incubated with EV-B93 3C protease. The enzyme was repurified by size-exclusion chromatography and subjected to crystallization trials. The protein complex with 14 gave well-diffracting crystals, which showed the presence of additional electron density in the active site corresponding to the molecular structure of the inhibitor. The high-resolution structure (PDB: 5IYT, 1.73 Å) of the protease-inhibitor complex revealed several additional aspects of the inhibition of the protease with compound 14. As described by our docking studies, exclusively the electrophilic C-2 of 14 was attacked and covalently linked to the nucleophilic Cys-147, forming a stable tetrahedral Michael addition product (Fig. 6a-c) . As a result, 14 is inserted between the solvent-exposed b-strand E2 and the loop formed by Thr-142, Arg-143, and Ala-144 and occupies the S1 and S1 0 sub-pockets of the protein. Other than the reference inhibitor AG-7404 (Fig. 6d) , which is attacked at C-3 (see asterisk), the C-1 carbonyl oxygen of the ethyl amide in 14 is oriented towards the oxyanion hole and forms a hydrogen-bonding network with the backbone amides of Cys-147, Gln-146 and Gly-145. The N-ethyl group points into the S1 0 -pocket. The pyrazolone ring of 14 is sandwiched in the S1 pocket by p À p interactions with the peptide bonds between Arg-143-Ala-144 on one side and the Gly-164-Asn-165 on the other side. The pyrazol-5-amide NH interacts with Arg-143, Gly-164, and a water molecule that mediates a hydrogen bond to His-161. In addition, plausible hydrogen bonds were identified between the pyrazolone ring, and both Gly-164 and Thr-142 as well as to a water molecule that supports the interaction with Ala-144. The cycloheptane shows only weak electron density indicating the flexible orientation of this part of the molecule at the protein surface, a van der Waals interaction is observed between the ring C4 atom and the side-chain C b atom of Ala-144. In summary, the crystal structure shows that the binding of compound 14 is distinct from that of the established inhibitors such as AG-7404 in several aspects that contribute to an understanding of the observed inhibitory activities. The modified warhead structure seems to favour binding through an additional interaction with the oxyanion hole and with the p-stacking of the pyrazolone. For comparison compounds 12 and 20 were docked to the enzyme and similar binding poses as in the crystal structure were obtained ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).
