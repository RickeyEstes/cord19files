We recruited a total of 1458 participants from 97 classes in 35 schools (24 kindergartens, 3 primary and 8 secondary schools), including 309 clinically diagnosed HFMD cases. After selecting classes with â‰¥2 cases for further analysis, a total of 65 classes with 286 HFMD cases were identified. We further removed 147 cases with missing onset or absence dates and the subsequent cases in the same class and 40 isolated cases. A total of 99 HFMD cases were available for analysis from 12 schools (4 kindergartens, 1 primary and 7 secondary schools). We identified 1 case with prior household infection and was considered not to be infected in class, but possible to infect other classmates. Table 1 shows the basic characteristics of the HFMD cases in our study. Among the 99 HFMD cases, 64.5% are males. The mean age was 12.1 years (standard deviation 4.7 years). The median time from symptom onset to sick absence was 2 days (interquartile range (IQR) 0-2 days) and the median number of HFMD cases per class was 2 (IQR 2-4 cases). The median days from the onset dates of the first to the last cases per class was 7.5 (IQR 5-14 days). On average, there were 1.3 infectors (range: 1-5) associated with each symptom onset to define the exposure period. Based on the symptom onset dates and sickness absence dates of the HFMD cases included for analysis, we fitted log-normal, gamma and Weibull distributions to the observed ranges of the incubation periods (Table 2) . Gamma was the best-fitted model with the lowest AIC for secondary and all schools, and log-normal was the best fitted distribution for kindergartens and primary schools. Other distributions also fitted well with AIC differences <3 comparing to the best-fitted distribution. Most of the distributions have satisfactory fit to the observed data, except for primary school where we had a small sample size (see Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The estimated median incubation period for all children from the Gamma distribution was 5.4 (95% CI 4.4-6.5) days, with estimated 5% and 95% percentiles of 1.0 and 16.0 days respectively (Fig. 1 ). The incubation period for kindergarten students were shortest with a median of 4.4 (95% CI 3.8-5.1), while that for secondary school students were longest with a median of 5.7 (95% CI 4.6-7.0). However the differences were not statistically significant (bootstrap tests, all p-values >0.07). As a sensitivity analysis, we included the first and at most three subsequent cases in each class, in which 42 HFMD cases were included for the analysis. The estimated median incubation period for all children was then 5.7 (95% CI: 4.7-6.8) days, with 5% and 95% percentiles of 1.3 and 15.2 days respectively. For the sensitivity analysis which restricted to single class outbreaks in each grade, 34 HFMD cases were included for the analysis. The estimated incubation period was 4.8 (95% CI 3.8-5.8) days, with 5% and 95% percentiles of 0.9 and 14.0 days respectively.
