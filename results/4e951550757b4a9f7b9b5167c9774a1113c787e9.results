All subjects (n = 25) enrolled in the Phase I open-label trial completed the safety evaluation. One subject was excluded from the analysis due to administration of Subunit vaccine, rather than Sub/MF59™. For the Phase II/III trial, the baseline characteristics of the study population were similar for the Sub/MF59™ and Subunit vaccine groups, with an equal match for gender, age and availability of current and past medical history. A total of 600 subjects were recruited in the subsequent Phase II/III trial and randomised to receive Sub/MF59™ (n = 400) or Subunit (n = 200) vaccine. Safety evaluation was completed for 589 subjects and serological analysis was performed for 554 subjects (Figure 1 ). The major reasons for patient withdrawal were refusal to continue the study (25 and 10 subjects receiving Sub/MF59™ and Subunit, respectively), a change in residence or hospital/being unable to receive follow-up as too busy (4 patients, 2 in each vaccine group) or other drop-out (6 and 1 subjects receiving Sub/MF59™ and Subunit, respectively). No subjects were withdrawn from the study because of an AE due to the study vaccines.
