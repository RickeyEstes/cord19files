Of the 1,266,085 articles in the PMCOAS, 931,087 (73.5%) were research articles, and 204,097 matched our infectious disease keyword search and (16.1%) matched our infectious disease search query. 157,779 articles matched both criteria, and contained matched locations. The mean total deviance for the publication model was 56.5, and the residual deviance was 15.2; the percentage explained was 73%. is theoretically aligned with our outcome of interest at a smaller-than-country resolution, and produces a similar distribution at country level as the previous method in 4 , we think it is a meaningful advancement in disaggregating infectious disease reporting effort past country level. Future research should focus on improving the natural language processing algorithms used to create the measure, and create gold standard datasets to test the accuracy at publication level.
