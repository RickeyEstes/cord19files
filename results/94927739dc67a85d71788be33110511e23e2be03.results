In order to get an insight on these chameleon sequences in nature, we surveyed the whole non redundant PDB, to find the so called chameleon sequences which can serve as the core of amyloid fibril formation. Subsequently, we analyzed the singlet and doublet propensity for different amino acids, and we extracted from our dataset the most abundant chameleon sequences in proteins and the proteins with the most chameleon sequences (CFPs).
