Trend information is to follow a "Bottom-Out" approach to data export ( Figure 1 ). In this scheme, the FilmArray Instrument sends data via the Internet directly to a single cloud database where it can be viewed by health care providers at the originating institution. This data export 140 pathway contrasts with a "Top-Out" approach ( Figure 1 ) in which diagnostic test results are pushed from the instrument up to the LIS, then to the HIS and, finally, a subset of this information is forwarded to cloud-based databases. 145 Bottom-Out and Top-Out approaches for data export are indicated by solid and dashed lines respectively. Some institutions have developed their own systems for aggregating and displaying infectious disease data (indicated by "Internal website").
