Pernasal swabs (n = 80) were collected from children with an ALRI of 0-24 days' duration at time of sample collection (median = 3.0 days). A further 273 samples were collected from The detection (%) of adenovirus type B or C, influenza virus A and respiratory syncytial virus in children grouped by age (months) with no ALRI symptoms (n = 273) and during ALRI episodes (n = 80). Significant associations with disease are marked *p < 0.05, **p < 0.005, ***p < 0.0005. children with no ALRI symptoms at the time of specimen collection or within one week of that sample collection. These yielded an extensive range of respiratory viruses (Table 1) . Adenovirus (p < 0.01), influenza A (p < 0.0001) and RSV (p < 0.0001) were associated with ALRI, but significant adenovirus associations were confined to species B (p < 0.01) and C (p < 0.05). When analyzed by age ( Fig. 1) , the association between RSV and ALRI was significant in 2-to <12-month-age groups (p < 0.0005-0.005), adenovirus B or C and ALRI (p < 0.05) in the 6-18 month age groups and influenza A and ALRI (p < 0.005) in the 6-to <12-month-age group. There was no evidence of an ALRI disease association for bocavirus or the KI and WU polyomaviruses, which were detected in 53 (19%), 4 (1.5%) and 75 (28%) of non-ALRI samples and 18 (22.5%), 0 and 16 (20%) samples from children during episodes of ALRI, respectively. Picornaviruses were detected in 61.5% of samples, mainly HRV species A and C based on 5 UTR sequencing (Fig. 2) , including 13 mixed picornavirus infections. Adequate capsid gene sequences were obtained for 150 of the samples: 146 partial VP4/VP2 sequences and 76 partial VP1 sequences. These matched the 5 UTR results for 67 samples with HRV-A, 9 with HRV-B, 48 with HRV-C, 11 with HEV and 13 with mixed picornavirus species. One picornavirus was unable to be assigned to a species as the 5 UTR matched best with HRV-B, the VP1 sequence with HRV-A and the VP2/4 with HEV. Limited sample volume and lack of virus isolates prevented further sequence analysis of these samples. There was no association of picornavirus detection with ALRI when analyzed overall or by individual species (Fig. 2) . Two new species C rhinoviruses were detected from non-ALRI patients and designated as HRV-C47 and HRV-C48 by the Picornaviridae Study Group (http://www.picornastudygroup.com/ types/enterovirus/hrv-c.htm). VP1 and VP4/2 coding region sequences were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers JF519760-JF519763. Sequential samples separated by 0.5-13 months (mean = 4.9 months), were available for 95 children. For one child, HCoV-OC43 was detected in consecutive samples separated by 17 weeks. The later sample was collected when the child had an ALRI and also contained HRV-A and RSV-B. A further 41 children had rhinoviruses detected in consecutive samples. However, except for one child with HRV-A12 detected in two samples collected 3 months apart, all had different HRV types in the different samples. Multiple viruses were detected in 53/80 (66.2%) ALRI samples and 115/273 (42.2%) non-ALRI samples (p = 0.0002). Combinations that only included viruses shown to be individually pathogenic were detected in 39/80 (48.8%) of ALRI samples and 50/273 (18.3%) of non-ALRI samples (p < 0.0001). In contrast, combinations that only contained HBoV, PyV, HRV, HEV or adenovirus D showed no association with ALRI. The viruses significantly associated with ALRI, namely RSV, influenza A, adenovirus B and adenovirus C, were detected as mixed infections with any other virus in 19/273 (7.0%) of the non-ALRI cases and 29/80 (36.3%) of the ALRI samples (p < 0.0001).
