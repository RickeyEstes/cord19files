Of 4869 individual patient records with PCT and/or RP results, 2031 met inclusion for the study (Fig. 1) lg/mL, a positive PCR, or both ( Table 2 ). The median duration of antibiotics was 3 days for all [19] . In the outpatient setting including the emergency department, the majority of antibiotic prescribing has been for patients presenting with respiratory conditions [20] . Many such infections are of viral origin including nearly 30% of pneumonias [3, 4] . In turn, much antibiotic prescribing for respiratory infections in outpatients is unwarranted [21, 22] . Unnecessary antibiotic use in the hospitalized patients with apparent respiratory tract infections also occurs [23] . This overuse can be explained to a large extent by the inherent difficulty in clinically differentiating bacterial from viral infection. At the same time, it appears that the treatment of respiratory tract infections represents a major area of opportunity for more judicious and limited use of antibiotics. The utilization of rapid diagnostic tests may help with this differential. The use of PCT and RP alone, or in combination, has been successfully and safely used to guide diagnosis and therapy [13, [24] [25] [26] [27] . A number of studies have shown PCT to be an effective test to utilize in altering antibiotic prescribing patterns without adversely affecting patient outcomes [13, 24, 25] . In these studies, empiric antibiotics therapy was strongly IQR interquartile range, PCT procalcitonin, RP respiratory panel in antibiotic duration when that information was made available to the primary care provider [26] . Patients in whom the positive viral RP was disclosed to the primary care provider (n = 11) had a median duration of antibiotics of 7 days as opposed to 12 days (P = 0.05) in patients with proven bacterial infection (n = 28). Furthermore, when a positive viral PCR was not disclosed (n = 19), the median duration of antibiotics was 12 days-similar to the bacterial infection group. These findings of decreased antibiotic exposure based on viral PCR were also reported by Oosterheert and colleagues [27] . In their study, positive PR results led to a discontinuation of antibiotics in 11% of patients. One potential challenge of the reliance on these rapid tests to rule out bacterial infection is co-infection with viral and bacterial pathogens, which has been reported in 14 [32, 33] . We studied clinician-prescribing behavior at our institution once RP and/or PCT laboratory results were available to the prescribing physician and were suggestive of a pure viral respiratory infection. We observed antibiotic discontinuation rates of only 17-20% in patients with positive viral RP results or PCT\0.25 lg/mL. In patients with both test results available (n = 31), and highly suggestive of a pure viral infection, antibiotic discontinuation rates were even lower (10%). One possible explanation for the low rates of antibiotic discontinuation could relate to the relatively low prescribing of antibiotics (38.9%) to patients with proven or suspected respiratory infections which had either a low PCT, a positive viral RP result, or both. We believe the relatively low incidence of prescribing in this context suggests many prescribers avoided antibiotic therapy based on other clinical factors suggesting a non-bacterial illness causing respiratory symptoms. An earlier study by Falsey and colleagues of respiratory illness reflected similar results to ours substantiating the opportunity for more judicious antimicrobial use based on the results of RP and PCT [14] . In this single-center study, patients were deemed to have a pure viral infection if a viral test was positive, all bacterial tests were negative, and serum PCT levels were\0.25 lg/mL on admission and day two of hospitalization. Duration of inpatient antibiotics was found to be significantly less in the viral alone group as compared to the mixed viral-bacterial group with means of 4.2 vs 6.2 days, respectively. These data suggest an opportunity in the use of combining RP and PCT results to narrow the etiologic diagnosis and perhaps decrease unnecessary antibiotic exposure. While mixed viral-bacterial infection was noted in 40% of patients, the utilized diagnostic battery appeared to distinguish these from pure viral infections. It is also notable, however, that while RP and PCT results suggesting pure viral infections resulted in shorter durations of antibiotic therapy, the average duration of therapy extended more than 2 days beyond the availability results of RP and PCT testing. Recently, in a follow-up study, antibiotic prescribing patterns associated with low PCT and positive viral RP results in patients with non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infections were characterized into two groups of patients, one receiving standard of care and the second receiving care specified by use of PCT algorithms and viral testing [15] . The investigators observed antibiotic discontinuation rates of 57% when PCT was\0.25 lg/mL and a positive viral RP was reported. This was substantially different than the 10% antibiotic discontinuation rate we observed. Several differences in study methods likely explain these disparate results. Importantly, ''nonpneumonic'' was apparently defined as those with clinically suggestive symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection with no clear evidence of or risk factors for bacterial pneumonia. Further, as the previous study [14] was conducted at the same institution as this more recent study and the methods and results of that study were shared with medical staff prior to commencing the Proactive intervention, such as that provided by ASPs is important in ensuring meaningful use of rapid diagnostics as opposed to a lack of clinical benefit in the absence of such ASP-facilitated interventions [36, 37] .
