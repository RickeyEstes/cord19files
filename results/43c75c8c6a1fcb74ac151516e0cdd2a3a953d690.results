Isolation and identification of viable viruses in aerosols collected 11 March 2016. Viable human respiratory viruses were recovered by the VIVAS and the BioSampler in each of three separate air sampling intervals performed on 11 March, but no viruses were recovered in control runs performed with HEPA-filtered VIVAS and Bio-Sampler air intakes. Cytopathic effects (CPE) consistent with those caused by influenza viruses were observed in MDCK cells beginning 6 days postinoculation (p.i.), suggesting the possibility that influenza A or B virus (or both) had been isolated (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). Moreover, syncytia consistent with those expected for human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were also observed in A549, LLC-MK2, and Vero cells regardless of trypsin content, but these effects were much more pronounced and easiest to detect in the cells in serum-free cell growth medium with added tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-trypsin. The syncytia became evident beginning 8 days postinoculation of the LLC-MK2 cells with trypsin and 10 days later in trypsin-free LLC-MK2 cells. In contrast, no CPE were observed in mock-inoculated cells or in control runs with HEPA-filtered samplers. Though the onset varied according to sampling interval, in each case, the CPE were observed first in cells inoculated with collection media from the VIVAS. Solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results indicated that both influenza A and B viruses had been isolated from the VIVAS samples (Fig. S1B) . Remarkably, reverse trancription-PCR (RT-PCR) indicated that influenza A virus subtypes H1 and H3 had been isolated, as well as Victoria-lineage influenza B virus. Similarly, RSV-A was identified in some of the cell cultures. The viruses detected per sampling interval are listed in Table 1 ; GenBank accession numbers for the influenza virus sequences are listed in Table S3 , and those for RSV-A are summarized in Table S3 . Sequence data analyses revealed the H1N1 viruses belonged to HA subclade 6B.1, based on criteria mentioned in reference 17; the results are presented in Text S1 and Table S4 for the reference strains and other recent local H1N1 viruses we isolated from humans or from other air samplings in other studies. Similar analyses that were performed as outlined in reference 18 indicated that the influenza H3N2 viruses belonged to HA clade subclade 3C.2a. These viruses have amino acid changes at major immunogenic epitopes of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein (Table S5 ) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins (Table S5 ) relative to the vaccine strain. Finally, the influenza virus B strains were all Victoria lineage (clade 1A) viruses, as discussed in reference 19. The RSV-A sequences were alike for the four isolates and were identical to those reported for contemporary RSV-A viruses in circulation in the United States (data not shown). Fig. S2 . Examples of cell cultures depicting virus-induced CPE are given in Fig. 1 . Sequencing of the influenza viruses revealed that once again, H1N1 clade 6B.1, H3N2 clade 3C.2a, and Victoria-lineage influenza B viruses had been isolated, as during the 11 March 2016 air samplings. The RSV-A sequences were identical to those of the RSV-A sequences from 11 March. As this project was originally designed to answer whether influenza virus aerosols could be detected in the student health care center, the other viruses were not sequenced after they were identified based on a combination of diagnostic PCR or RT-PCR and GenMark analyses.
