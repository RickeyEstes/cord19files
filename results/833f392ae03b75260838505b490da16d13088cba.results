Expression of endogenous retroviral sequences Rat leukaemia virus (RaLV) Northern blot hybridisation analysis was used to quantitate the expression levels of retrovirus-related sequences in rat livers. Messenger RNA transcripts, about 6.8 kilobases long, homologous to RaLV were detected in all of the liver samples from rats fed either the basal or BR931 diet. The results obtained with 12 representative samples are known in Figure la . There was some interindividual variation in the level of expression of RaLV transcripts between animals in the same treatment group. The BR931 diet led to a slight increase (about 1.7-fold) in the level of RaLV RNA (Table I) , when compared to agematched rats fed the basal diet. The level of these transcripts was found to be increased as early as day 3, which decreased to almost the control level at day 14 after the start of the BR931 diet. Messenger RNA transcripts homologous to RaLV were also detected in the liver tumour samples and in all of the 'normal' tumour-adjacent liver samples ( Figure 2 ). The relative abundance of these transcripts was increased (about 2-fold) in liver tumours induced by BR931, when compared to the results obtained with liver RNA samples obtained from age-matched rats fed the basal diets (Table II) . The relative abundance of these transcripts was, however, not significantly different between the 'normal' tumour-adjacent and liver tumour samples ( Figure 2 and Table II) . 30S In addition to RaLV sequences, the rat genome also contains another family of retrovirus-related sequences designated '30S'. Messenger RNA transcripts, about 8.4 kilobases long, homologous to a 30S probe (similar to those shown in Figure 2 ) were detected in all of the liver samples from rats fed either the basal or BR931 diet. No significant interindividual variation in expression of 30S transcripts was observed. Nor did the feeding of the BR931 diet influence the level of this RNA species (Table I) . . 32P-labelled probes corresponding to the indicated sequences were hybridised to polyadenylated RNA samples isolated from rats fed control or BR93 1 diets. Lanes 1-6, rats fed control diets; lanes 7-12, rats fed BR931 diets. In panel a the samples were obtained on day 3, and in panels b and c on day 56, following the onset of the control or BR931 diets. For additional details see Materials and methods. Messenger RNA transcripts homologous to 30S were also detected in all of the liver tumour and the parallel control liver and 'normal' tumour-adjacent liver samples (Figure 2 ). The levels of expression of 30S were not significantly different between the liver tumour, control liver and 'normal' tumouradjacent samples (Table II) . Expression of cellular proto-oncogenes c-myc Messenger RNA transcripts, about 2.5 kilobases long, homologous to c-myc were detected in all of the liver samples from rats fed either the basal or BR931 diet. The results obtained with 12 representative samples are shown in Figure lb . There was some interindividual variation in the -6.8 kb level of expression of the c-myc transcript between animals in the same treatment group. The BR931 diet led to a marked increase (about 8-fold) in the level of c-myc, when compared to age-matched rats fed the basal diet. The level of these transcripts was found to be increased as early as day 3, and reached a maximum at day 56 (Table I ). An additional finding was that the level of c-myc in normal liver decreased with age in the rats fed the basal diet; thus, the level of c-myc at day 3 was about 2.3-fold higher than the level at day 56 (data not shown here). The relative abundance of c-myc mRNA transcripts was increased about 2-fold in liver tumours induced by BR931, when compared to that found in liver RNA samples from age-matched rats fed the basal died ( Figure 2 and Table II ). The relative abundance of these transcripts was, however, not sigificantly different between the liver tumour s the samples from 'normal' tumour-adjacent sar II).

The results obtained with 12 representative samples are shown in Figure la . There was slight interindividual variation in the level of expression of the c-H-ras transcript between animals in the same treatment group. The BR931 diet led to a slight increase (about 2-fold) in the level of c-H-ras mRNA, when -6.8 kb compared to age-matched rats fed the basal diet. The level of these transcripts was increased as early as day 3, but decreased to almost the basal level at day 28 (Table I) . The levels of expression of c-H-ras were not significantly different between liver tumours, the normal liver samples -8.4 kb from age-matched controls and the 'normal' tumour-adjacent samples ( Figure 2 and Table II) . Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor EGF receptor--2.5 kb related transcripts that were 10.5, 7.5 and 5.8 kilobases in size were found in all of the liver RNA samples obtained from rats fed either the basal or BR931 diet. The results obtained with 12 representative samples are shown in Figure  Ic . There was some interindividual variation in the level of -1.4 kb expression of EGF receptor transcripts between animals in the same treatment group. The BR931 diet caused a marked decrease (about 3.5-fold) in the level of EGF receptor RNA, -10.5 kb when compared to age-matched rats fed the basal diet. The level of these transcripts was found to be decreased as early --7.5 kb as day 3, and persisted throughout the experiment (Table I ). ---5.8 kb Messenger RNA transcripts homologous to EGF receptor were also detected in all of the liver tumour samples, the -2.6 kb 'normal' tumour-adjacent tissues and the age-matched con--2.4 kb trol samples (Figure 2 ). The relative abundance of these transcripts was decreased about 3-fold in the liver tumours induced by BR931, when compared to liver samples from the f RaLV and age-matched rats fed the basal diet (Table II) .

The BR931 diet led to a slight increase (about 2-fold) in the level of ODC RNA, when compared to age-matched rats fed the basal diet (Table I ). The level of these transcripts was found to be increased as early as day 3, and persisted throughout the experiment (Table I) . Messenger RNA transcripts homologous to ODC were also detected in the liver tumour samples, the 'normal' tumour-adjacent samples and the liver samples and the liver samples from normal age-matched controls (Figure 2 ). The relative abundance of these transcripts was increased -(about 1.7-fold) in the liver tumours induced by BR931, when compared to the age-matched control samples (Table II) . The relative abundance of these transcripts was, however, not significantly different between the 'normal' tumour-adjacent and liver tumour samples (Table II) .
