Some cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) infected with SARS coronavirus have been reported to develop clinical disease signs including a transient rash, respiratory distress, and lethargy. 24, 8 We have investigated three species of monkeys, namely cynomolgus, rhesus (M mulatta), and African green monkeys, for permissiveness for SARS-coronavirus replication and possible disease (unpublished data). Of the three, African green monkeys supported the highest levels of replication as measured by virus shedding and hence were used in this study. None of the 12 animals in any of the three species developed overt disease signs, and we did not note disease signs in this study. Mice, ferrets, and cats have been shown to support high levels of pulmonary SARS-coronavirus replication, and some of the infected ferrets became lethargic. 25, 20 We did not assess BHPIV3/SARS-S in mice because the HPIV3 vaccine vector is severely restricted for replication in this animal, and the cat and ferret models were only recently reported. Thus, although our study showed complete protection against shedding of challenge virus, we could not assess whether protection would be afforded predicted full length unmodified S protein is 138 kDa and has 23 potential glycosylation sites. [5] [6] [7] There was no evidence of proteolytic cleavage of the SARS S protein into two subunits, as occurs with some coronaviruses. Since the SARS-coronavirus S protein is a transmembrane virion component and BHPIV3 also is an enveloped virus, we wanted to determine whether the S protein was incorporated into BHPIV3 particles. Western blot analysis did not detect the S protein in purified, concentrated BHPIV3/SARS-S virus particles (figure 2A, lane 1) under conditions where direct Coomassie staining ( figure 2B, lane 2) showed that viral protein was present in quantities greater than that required for detection by western blot. The absence of significant incorporation of S protein into virions suggests that its expression would be unlikely to affect the tropism of the vector and is a safety factor. Table 1 shows the monkeys' responses to immunisation. Analysis of the nasal swab samples taken after immunisation showed that the peak titre (3·9 vs 4·3 log 10 TCID 50 /mL) and duration of shedding (5·8 vs 7·8 days) from the upper respiratory tract did not differ significantly between BHPIV3/SARS-S and BHPIV3/ Ctrl. Analysis of the tracheal lavage samples, a measure of shedding from the lower respiratory tract, showed that two of the four animals infected with BHPIV3/SARS-S did not have detectable virus shedding, whereas the other two showed some shedding at 2 days but this was less than for the BHPIV3/Ctrl-immunised animals (table 1) . Thus, expression of the SARS S protein had an attenuating effect on the replication of the vector, particularly in the lower respiratory tract. Nevertheless, BHPIV3/SARS-S and BHPIV3/Ctrl each induced a moderate titre of HPIV3-specific antibodies as measured by an HAI assay (table 1 ). In addition, BHPIV3/SARS-S induced a detectable level of serum antibodies that neutralised SARS-S coronavirus in vitro (mean reciprocal titre of 3·9 log 2 ). Table 2 shows responses to challenges with SARS coronavirus. All four monkeys immunised with BHPIV3/Ctrl shed challenge SARS coronavirus from the upper and lower respiratory tract. By contrast, none of the animals immunised with BHPIV3/SARS-S shed SARS coronavirus on any day from either the upper or lower respiratory tract. SARS-coronavirus-neutralising serum antibody titres 28 days after the challenge are shown in table 2. The increase in titre in the BHPIV3/SARS-S group after the challenge could be the result of an immune response to the antigen present in the virus inoculum or to a low level of replication of SARS coronavirus.
