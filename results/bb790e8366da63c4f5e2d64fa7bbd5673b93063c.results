Preliminary observations made in our laboratory demonstrated that mutations downstream of the TAAAT motif result in a 4-to B-fold increase in promoter strength as compared to the wild-type translocated promoter. In contrast, the efficiency of translation can be decreased more than lo-fold as compared to the wild-type translocated-dhfr construct. This phenomenon appears to be independent of the test gene cloned downstream of the mutated promoter (unpublished data). A detailed analysis of the different mutants will be presented elsewhere. The reduction of the translatability of these messengers indicates that the sequence at the 5' end of the mRNA might be directly or indirectly involved in a translational control mechanism. We have therefore analyzed the structure and sequence at the 5' end of late vaccinia messengers in more detail.
