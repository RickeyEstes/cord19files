All cats were FIV-and FeLV-negative, while FCoVpositive cats were present in all groups. The percentage of positive animals was higher ðP < 0:001Þ in cats with FIP (90.6%) than in other groups (group 1: 25%; group 2: 36.4%). Results from FCoV-exposed cats did not significantly differ from those of controls, whereas cats with FIP had increased total globulins and globulin fractions, except for a 1 -globulins, and increased APPs (Table 2) . However, b-and c-globulins were higher compared to con- *P < 0:05; **P < 0:01; T 0 ¼ first sample; T 28 ; T 53 ; T 83 ¼ 28; 53 and 83 days after T 0 , respectively; n.s., not significant. a Appearance of the symptoms in another cat of the group. trols, but not to FCoV-exposed cats. The results from cats with wet FIP were not significantly different from those obtained in cats with dry FIP. After the appearance of clinical symptoms, a 1 -, a 2globulins and Hp decreased, while c-globulins increased in both the cats with FIP (Table 3) . b-Globulins and AGP were however different in these two cats and SAA did not change in the single cat in which it was measured. Total proteins and albumins significantly decreased at T 53 in FcoV-exposed cats (Table 4) . No other significant changes were detectable, in spite of an increase of mean values of a 2 -globulin from T 0 to T 83 and of the APPs at T 28 and/or a T 53 . In fact after the onset of the disease in the group, transient increases of the APPs were detected in all four cats, but in different samplings (Figs. 1-3) .
