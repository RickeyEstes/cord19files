In Experiment 1, for assessments of CO 2 concentration changes within the chamber following a 5 min infusion of normoxic 20% CO 2 we observed a significant over time effect (F (19, 114) = 105.2, p < 0.001, Figure 1a , n = 7). In this analysis there was a rapid increase in CO 2 concentrations from undetectable to 10% within 1 min, and 20% to 24% at 2-6 min post-infusion, which returned to 3% to 0% 3-5 min post-infusion of atmospheric air. It is noteworthy that the infusions of a custom mixed normoxic 20% CO 2 tank led to approximately 24% CO 2 concentrations which could be due to the range error of the sensor, which was +/´3% and/or errors in tank preparations. For assessments of O 2 concentration changes within the chamber following a 5 min infusion of normoxic 20% CO 2 , we also observed a significant over time effect (F (19,114) = 35.2, p < 0.001, Figure 1b, n = 7) . In this analysis O 2 concentrations increased from 20.9% to 21.1% within 1 min, then returned to 20.9% 7 min post-infusion which could also be due to the range error of sensor, which is +/´2% and/or errors in tank preparations. Compared to atmospheric air infusions, infusing normoxic, 20% CO 2 into a small volume chamber induced a robust and immediate pressor response in the rats that went from baseline means of approximately 120 mmHg to 145 mmHg (gasˆtime interaction F (19,399) = 42.1, p < 0.001, Figure 1c , n = 12,11). The pressor response began to return to normal post-CO 2 infusion, but then increased again. This coincided with a dramatic increase in respiration rate in Figure 1d when we noted that the rats had increased respiration rates during CO 2 infusion but then, at offset, were moving to the atmospheric air intake, where they began to breathe rapidly (gasˆtime interaction F (19,361) = 24.5, p < 0.001, Figure 1d , n = 11,10, we lost signal on one rat in each group). Locomotor activity increased post CO 2 infusion and remained increased even at offset (gasˆtime interaction F (19,399) = 2.3, p = 0.002, Figure 1e , n = 12,11). Dramatic reflexive bradycardia responses post-CO 2 returned to baseline at offset of CO 2 , and became tachycardic shortly after (gasˆtime interaction F (19,399) = 53.7, p < 0.001, Figure 1f , n = 12,11). Behaviors assessed immediately following air challenges revealed that CO 2 -challenged rats had reduced social interaction durations, compared to atmospheric air challenged rats (F (2,33) = 24.4, p < 0.001, Figure 1g , n = 12,12,12), and increased thigmotaxis in the open field test (line crossing t (10) = 4.1, p = 0.002, middle entries t (10) =´12.1, p < 0.001, middle time t (10) =´10.1, p < 0.001, center entries t (10) =´13.8, p < 0.001, center time t (10) =´13.0, p < 0.001, distance traveled t (10) =´13.1, p < 0.001, Figure 1h , n = 11,11, video malfunction on one rat, other crossover removed for paired t-test analyses). In Experiment 2b, for assessments of CO 2 concentration changes within the chamber following 10, 30% and 100% CO 2 volume per minute displacement rates, we observed a significant gas infusionˆtime interaction (F (40,180) = 8.0, p < 0.001, Figure 2a , n = 4,4). For the 100% CO 2 volume per minute displacement rate there was a rapid increase in CO 2 concentrations from undetectable to 30% and 90% 1-2 min post-infusion, respectively. For 30% volume displacement this increase only significantly lagged by 1 min, but with 10% CO 2 volume displacement it took 4 min for CO 2 concentrations to be >40%, and the chamber reached 100% CO 2 11 to 12 min post-infusions. For in vitro assessments of O 2 concentration changes following 10%, 30% and 100% CO 2 volume per minute displacement we observed a significant gas infusionˆtime interaction (F (40,180) = 12.4, p < 0.001, Figure 2b, n = 4,4) . In this analysis, with 100% CO 2 volume displacement there was a rapid decrease in O 2 concentrations from approximately 21% O 2 to 12.5% and 2% O 2 within 1-2 min, respectively. For 30% volume per minute displacement, the decrease was slower and it took 5 min to reach approximately 2% O 2 . With 10% CO 2 volume per minute displacement, it took 5 min for CO 2 concentrations to be 12.5%, and the chamber reached 2% O 2 at 13-14 min post-infusion.
