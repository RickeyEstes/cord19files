We used NimbleGen tiling arrays to analyze the genomic variability of 18 SS2 isolates (Table 1) , including five strains (ZYH214, ZYH215, ZYH354-1, Habb, and 98T003) isolated from STSS patients during the two Chinese SS2 outbreaks, two strains (JR and JZD-1) isolated from dead pigs during the 2005 outbreak in China, eight virulent strains isolated from China before the 1998 outbreak (strains 606, 1940, and 1941) or from other countries (strains 607, SS2-N, S735, 8011, and S10), and three avirulent strains (05HAS68, ZF, and T15). The complete genome sequence of 05ZYH33 (GenBank accession number NC_009442), a highly virulent strain isolated from a Chinese STSS patient during the Sichuan outbreak in 2005 [4] , is available and was used as the common reference strain for each CGS analysis.
