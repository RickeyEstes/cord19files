Faecal samples from 20 healthy FECV-infected cats were applied to sequence analyses of the accessory protein genes 3a, 3b, 3c, 7a and 7b, the S2 region of the spike (S) protein gene and the membrane (M) protein gene. Faecal (F) samples and ascites (A) from 19 cats with FIP were also tested including 10 animals, where paired samples comprised ascites as well as faeces from the same animal (n = 20) and nine animals, where only either ascites (n = 5) or faeces (n = 4) was available. Sequences were submitted to GenBank; samples, regions sequenced and the respective accession numbers are listed in Table 1 . In order to obtain reliable data each sequence represents a consensus sequence of three independent clones.
