Murine AKAP7 rapidly degrades 2-5A with kinetics similar to those of MHV ns2 and rotavirus VP3. Alignment of murine AKAP7 to its eukaryotic homologs suggests that it is a member of an ancient family of 2H phosphoesterases that extend from plants to humans (Fig. S2 ). To determine whether murine AKAP7 is a 2=,5=-PDE, cDNA encoding full-length AKAP7␥ (hereinafter "AKAP7" unless stated otherwise) was expressed in bacteria, purified, and tested for its ability to cleave the trimeric species of 2-5A, (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 , in vitro. Wild-type (wt) AKAP7, AKAP7 mutated in both conserved histidines (AKAP7 H93A;H185R ), and, for comparison, MHV strain A59 ns2 and human rotavirus strain WA VP3-CTD ( Fig. 1A) were incubated with (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 at 37°C. 2-5A levels were measured by activation of RNase L in vitro in comparison to a standard curve of 2-5A dilutions using a previously described fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) method (20) . ns2, VP3, and AKAP7 (each at 1.5 M) rapidly degraded (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 (10 M) such that after a 1-min incubation at 37°C, less than 30% of the input (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 remained intact (Fig. 1B) . Little or no detectable 2-5A remained after 10 min of incubation with any of the three proteins. In contrast, AKAP7 mutated in the two conserved histidine residues lacked the ability to degrade 2-5A (Fig. 1B) . To demonstrate that AKAP7 has a 2=,5=-PDE activity that cleaves one 5=-AMP at a time from the 2=,3= terminus of 2-5A, we performed incubations at a lower temperature, 22°C. As we reported previously (7) , ns2 degrades (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 to (2=-5=)p 3 A 2 and 5=-AMP, and then the diadenylate (2=-5=)p 3 A 2 is degraded to 5=-AMP and 5=-ATP (Fig. 1C) . AKAP7 also removed one 5=-AMP at a time from trimeric 2-5A, and therefore it is also a bona fide 2=,5=-PDE (Fig. 1D ). As expected, active-site mutant AKAP7 H93A;H185R failed to degrade (2=-5=)p 3 A 3 (Fig. 1E ). Quantitation of these results showed that AKAP7 and ns2 displayed comparable kinetics (Fig. 1F) . AKAP7 degrades 2-5A in intact cells transfected with dsRNA. To determine if AKAP7 was able to degrade 2-5A in intact cells, cDNAs for full-length AKAP7, AKAP7 CD, and mutant AKAP7 H93A;H185R (with a C-terminal Flag epitope) were transiently expressed in the human ovarian carcinoma cell line Hey1B (21) . Hey1B cells were selected for these experiments because endogenous AKAP7 was undetectable by Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against an AKAP7 CD peptide (Fig. 1G ). Ectopic expression of the different AKAP7 proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting ( Fig. 1G ). At 20 h posttransfection with either an empty vector or the AKAP7 cDNAs, cells were transfected for an additional 3 h with the synthetic doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) poly(rI) · poly(rC) (pIC), a potent activator of OAS (22). 2-5A was undetectable in control cells transfected with the vector alone as determined by FRET (the lower limit of detection was about 15 fmol/10 6 cells) (Fig. 1H ). However, pIC caused high levels of 2-5A (38 pmol/10 6 cells) to accumulate in the vector control cells. In contrast, expression of the AKAP7 CD reduced pIC induction of 2-5A by almost 200-fold (to 0.2 pmol/10 6 cells). The full-length AKAP7 reduced pIC-induced levels of 2-5A by about 12-fold (to 3 pmol/10 6 cells), while fulllength mutant AKAP7 H93A;H185R failed to deplete pIC-induced levels of 2-5A (26 pmol/10 6 cells remaining). These findings demonstrate that AKAP7 (full length and CD) effectively degraded 2-5A in intact pIC-transfected cells.
