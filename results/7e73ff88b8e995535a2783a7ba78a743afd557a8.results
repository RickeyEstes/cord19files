Positive selection shaped the evolution of clade c betaCoV spike protein. We first investigated whether positive selection drove the evolution of MERS-CoV-related coronavirus spike proteins. Previous phylogenetic analyses of S genes of viruses isolated from humans/camels (MERS-CoV), bats, and hedgehogs (Supplementary Table. S1) indicated that the S1 and S2 regions display different tree topologies (Fig. 1B) , possibly as a result of recombination 6 . Because recombination can inflate estimates of positive selection 20 , we separately analyzed the two regions. We pruned the S1 and S2 multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) from unreliably aligned codons and we screened them for evidence of additional recombination events using GARD (Genetic Algorithm Recombination Detection) 21 , which detected no breakpoint. The saturation of substitution rates represents a major problem in the detection of positive selection among distantly related sequences. Computation of the nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitution rates over whole phylogenies allows breaking of long branches, resulting in improved rate estimation. Thus, evidence of episodic positive selection was searched for by using the codeml branch-site test 22 , which is relatively insensitive to the saturation of substitution rates 23 . In the S1 and S2 regions, 3 and 4 branches yielded statistically significant evidence of positive selection under different codon frequency models (Fig. 1B , Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3 ). Positively selected sites along these branches were detected using the BEB (Bayes empirical Bayes) procedure and validated using the Mixed Effects Model of Evolution (MEME) 24 . One positively selected site was found in the S1 region, 7 sites in the S2 subunit (Fig. 1A , Table 1 ). The R652 selected site (in S1) almost corresponds to two mutations that independently arose in the SARS-CoV spike gene as a result of in vitro adaptation of zoonotic strains to primate cells 25 (Fig. 1A) . In S2, most selected sites are located in the HR1, HR2, and in the intervening linker. Remarkably, position 1060 is the almost exact counterpart of aminoacid changes that expand the host range or cell-type tropism of infectious bronchiolitis virus (IBV, L857F) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV, E1035D) ( Fig. 1A) 26, 27 . No positively selected site was found to be located in the RBD (Fig. 1A) . Nevertheless, the pruning of unreliably aligned codons operated on the MSA left a minority of RBD sites available for analysis. We thus repeated the branch-site test on a subset of more closely related sequences (Fig. 1B) . This procedure decreased divergence and pruning in the RBD and allowed analysis of most codons; even with this procedure, no positively selected site was detected (not shown).
