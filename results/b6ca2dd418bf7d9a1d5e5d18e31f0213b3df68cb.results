Calves presented no signs of respiratory disease or any other disease at week 0 (three calves had a clinical score of 1 at week 0 because of rectal temperature of 39.0-39.5 8C). All calves showed signs of BRD starting at week 1 (Fig. 1) . Clinical disease became more pronounced at weeks 2, 3 and 4 (Table 1) . Clinical scores of all calves increased from week 0 to 1 (p < 0.001) and from week 1 to 2 (p < 0.01). Clinical scores decrease from weeks 4 to 5 (p < 0.001). No differences were seen in patterns of clinical signs between BRSV antibody response groups. Overall, only mild to moderate clinical respiratory disease was recorded (maximal score 8). Two calves were treated with antibiotics (5 days) based on the clinical evaluation at week 3 (calves nos. 1 and 5, clinical scores of 7 and 8, respectively) ( Table 1) . These calves had also relatively high Hp values at that time (0.43 and 0.67 g/l, respectively) (Fig. 2) . All calves were seronegative to BRSV at week 0. By week 6, all calves had become seropositive (COD values from 0.6 to 2.3) (Fig. 1 ). Calves were seronegative to BCV throughout the observation period. Antibodies to the PIV-3 virus were present in all calves at week 0, and these gradually decreased (data not shown). BRSV was found in five calves in the 2-week TBL samples (Table 1) but not in 6-week TBL samples. No BCV was found in any of the TBL samples investigated. P. multocida was isolated from nine and six calves in the first and second samplings, respectively, and at least once from every calf ( Table 1 ). The only calf with no P. multocida infection at week 2 had an increase of SAA and LBP concentrations from week 0 to 1 (from 13.4 to 23.8 mg/l and from 2.6 to 9.8 mg/l respectively). No change was seen after that (range of 2.7-5.2 mg/l and 2.0-4.3 mg/l in the subsequent samples, respectively) and no Hp response at all. That calf had also the lowest peak of clinical score ( Table 1) . All available P. multocida isolates (n = 14 since isolate of calf no. 3 was not stored for further analysis) had an identical SalI restriction pattern (data not shown). Mycoplasma dispar was found in all TBL samples except for one (calf no. 9 at week 2). More bacterial species were isolated in the middle of the BRD outbreak (week 2) than at later stage (week 6) ( Table 1) . Mean SAA and LBP concentrations of all calves increased between weeks 0 and 1 (p < 0.001) and then decreased between weeks 3 and 4 (p < 0.01). Mean Hp concentrations of calves decreased between weeks 3 and 4 (p < 0.05) and mean AGP concentrations decreased between weeks 0 and 1 (p < 0.05). There were no differences in initial APP concentrations or age between BRSV antibody response groups before the outbreak of BRD. In general, APP patterns changed differently in the antibody response groups. Calves with low antibody response had more elevated concentrations at week 3 (Fig. 2) . Mean SAA concentration increased in the low antibody group between weeks 2 and 3 (p < 0.001) compared with the high antibody group, where the mean concentration decreased. Mean LBP concentrations decreased between weeks 1 and 2 (p < 0.05) and increased between weeks 2 and 3 (p < 0.001) in low antibody group compared with the high-response group, where the mean concentrations increased and decreased, respectively. SAA and LBP concentrations of the same three calves from the low antibody group remained elevated to the end of the study (weeks 4, 5 and 6) (Fig. 2 ). Similar differences in changing patterns between antibody response groups were seen also in Hp concentrations. In the low antibody group Hp concentrations increased between weeks 2 and 3 (p < 0.05) and decreased between weeks 3 and 4 (p < 0.01) compared with the high-response group, where no other clear changes occurred except two high values at week 2 (Fig. 2) .
