Defining the G6 Idiotype on IGHV1-69-Encoded Human Anti-influenza Abs Targeting the HA Stem Domain We (Sui et al., 2009 ) and others (Corti et al., 2017; Pappas et al., 2014) discovered the biased use of IGHV1-69 F-alleles in HV1-69-sBnAbs. These data led us to further investigate if these HV1-69-sBnAbs also bind to the anti-Id + Ab G6. Surprisingly, an ELISA assay showed that of the five previously discovered HV1-69-sBnAbs (Sui et al., 2009) , only D8 strongly bound to G6 ( Figure 1A ). Very weak binding was also observed for the IGHV1-2 germline-based sBnAb H40. In subsequent assays that tested G6 binding of 7 other HV1-69-sBnAbs, only CR6331 (Throsby et al., 2008) and 70-1F02 (Wrammert et al., 2011) were found to express the G6 CRI. In addition, no binding activity was observed when C9114 (Dreyfus et al., 2012) was tested for binding against humanized hG6.3 (Chang et al., 2016) . Thus, of a total of 12 HV1-69-sBnAbs that were tested, only three were G6-reactive. Analysis of the three G6-reactive heavy chain CDR sequences ( Figure 1B ) revealed the commonality of P52aA/G substitution in CDR-H2 together with shorter CDR-H3 regions that encode three tyrosine residues at positions 97-99 (Kabat numbering). The G6-reactive HV1-69-sBnAbs maintained germline N58. Fewer amino acid substitutions occur in CDR-H1 and CDR-H2, with higher V-segment germline gene identity (92.0% ± 3.5%), for G6-reactive compared to the G6-nonreactive HV1-69-sBnAbs (85.1% ± 1.5%). Three of these G6-nonreactive HV1-69-sBnAbs, F10, A66, and CR6261, were used to investigate the contributions of V-segment amino acid substitutions, whereby the expression of G6 idiotope was analyzed for chimeras constructed by using the IGHV1-69 germline non-mutated V-segment and maintaining the original (wild-type; WT) CDR-H3/J and light chains. Restoration of strong G6 binding was observed for the three VH1-69/F10, VH1-69/A66, and VH1-69/CR6261 chimeras ( Figure 2A ) that now failed to bind HA (data not shown). This finding of reciprocal gain of G6-idiotype with loss of HA binding was unexpected. We have previously shown that a consensus motif for HV1-69-sBnAbs is composed of critical amino acid substitutions in the VH-segment together with a hydrophobic amino acid at position 53, Phe54, and properly positioned Figure 1 . The G6 Idiotype Appears on Select Influenza sBnAbs HV1-69-sBnAbs discovered in our previous study (Sui et al., 2009) were analyzed by ELISA for binding to G6 (A). Their heavy chain CDRs sequences are shown in (B) as well as other HV1-69-sBnAbs that were analyzed for G6 binding by using Biacore T100 (or by using Octet RED96 for CR9114 against hG6.3). Grey colored residues are those that are in consensus with the germline gene residues of IGHV1-69*01 (representative of 51p1 alleles). Also shown are the residues at position 58, and the V-segment amino acid germline identity mean and SD of the G6 reactive and nonreactive groups as determined by IgBlast. CDR-H3 Tyr . Thus, unique VH-segment substitutions, particularly those involving the CDR-H2 loop, are involved in HA binding. To further define the contribution of individual VH-segment substitutions for G6 and HA binding, several VH1-69/F10 variants were tested in which amino acid substitutions were backintroduced into CDR-H2 ( Figures 2B and 2E ). The substitutions of either I52S or I53M resulted in lower G6 binding affinity, as determined by faster dissociation rates, and the combined I52S I53M substitutions resulted in a significant loss in binding affinity. Interestingly, in contrast to our previous report that showed that VH1-69/F10 CDR-H2 I52S restored binding activity to HA, while VH1-69/F10 CDR-H2 I53M did not, both constructs had a similar effect on diminishing G6 binding. In addition, the VH1-69/F10 CDR-H1 G26E G27V CDR-H2 I52S I53M variant (that introduced two HV1-69-sBnAb amino acid changes in CDR-H1) resulted in complete loss of G6 binding. This set of VH1-69/F10 variants was also displayed using artificial BCRs and tested against G6 and hG6.3 as antigens. Both G6 and hG6.3 were able to cross-link the various VH1-69/F10 variant BCRs ( Figures 2C and 2D ), but not the WT F10. In contrast to the kinetic binding data ( Figure 2B ), the VH1-69/ F10 CDR-H2 I52S and VH1-69/F10 CDR-H2 I53M variants had similar and modest increases in binding, respectively, compared to VH1-69/F10, and the combination CDR-H2 and CDR-H1/H2 variants also maintained some level of G6 binding. This disparity may be attributed to avidity in the BCR experimental system that is generated by bivalent to bivalent interactions (Vauquelin and Charlton, 2013) . Thus, the G6 idiotope is exclusively located in the VH segment and is most sensitive to amino acid changes The V-segment of the non-G6 reactive HV1-69-sBnAbs F10, CR6261, and A66 was replaced with the non-mutated IGHV1-69*01 germline V-segment. Binding kinetics of the three variants (VH1-69/F10, A66, CR6261) were analyzed against G6 by using Biacore T100. (B) VH1-69/F10 variants were generated, in which F10's V-segment amino acid substitutions were back-introduced and then analyzed by Biacore T100 for binding activities against G6 when using a single concentration of 2.85 mg/mL per variant. (C and D) The same variants were also tested for binding by using an artificial B cell receptor display system in which the VH1-69/F10 variants were displayed as BCRs and either G6 (C) or hG6.3 (D) were added at the concentration of 50 mg/mL. In the upper panels of (C) and (D), the binding response is shown for isotype controls and varying concentrations of G6 or h6.3 when tested against VH1-69/F10. Binding was monitored by fluorescent measurements of calcium ions being released from intracellular compartments. (E) The heavy chain of F10 is shown (PDB 3FKU) with residues colored in red that were back-introduced in the VH1-69/F10 variants and the unchanged CDR-H3/J residues are shown in pink. in CDR-H2 but can be further influenced by amino acid changes in CDR-H1. The Crystal Structures of the D80 Fab Fragment and the D80-hG6.3 Fab Fragment Complex The G6 idiotope was further elucidated at the structural level by investigating the critical binding interactions of one of these HV1-69-sBnAbs, D80 (that has a similar VH chain as D8 except for a K23R substitution) that binds both HA and hG6.3. The crystal structures of the Fab of D80 were determined for both D80 alone and bound to the hG6.3 Fab, each to 2.5 Å resolution ( Figure 3 ; Table S1 ). Macro level view of the hG6.3-D80 complex shows that the two Abs form an angle of 130 with respect to the (A) The angle of approach between D80 and hG6.3, measured between the planes defined by the centers of mass for the V and C domains and the 2-fold pseudo-symmetry axis (orange and red dots) of the Fab fragments. The planes are colored lighter to darker for parallel to perpendicular relative to the image plane. The two red dots are aligned in the sight line (visual axis) in the last panel.

The binding interface between D80 and hG6.3 has a total buried solventaccessible surface area of 900 Å 2 per binding partner. The two antibodies interact with each other through their variable domains, where the CDR loops in the VH domain of D80 Fab directly interact with their complementary CDR loops in the VH and light chain (VL) domains of the hG6.3 Fab ( Figure 3B ).
