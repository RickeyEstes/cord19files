It was apparent that most of the patients were young people below 25 (429; 78.28%) and only less than one percent of them was elderly aged 65 and above (3; 0.55%). The numbers of male and female patients were quite evenly distributed with a difference of a few percentage points (30; 5.48%). Considering the spatial distribution of cumulative disease incidents, Kowloon was observed to incur the bulk of diseased cases (225; 41%) with the remaining occurrences equally spread between Hong Kong Island (161; 29%) and the New Territories (162; 29%) ( Table 2 ). Looking at the time course of confirmed cases of H1N1 (Table 3) , a sharp increase in the cumulative disease counts was observed in week 7 (136; 24.8%) peaking in week 8 that accounted for nearly half of all cases within the study period (268; 49.0%). The outbreak seemed under control in week 9 (96; 17.5%) with a cumulative count of less than one percent of all cases (3; 0.5%) by week 10. Table 4 presents the correlation coefficients (r) between selected population-related factors and disease incidence at three grid resolution (200 m × 200 m, 400 m × 400 m and 1000 m × 1000 m). It was noteworthy that a large proportion of the 8 761 grid cells (200 m × 200 m) did not have census data since relevant data were masked and they were too few numbers to report in those areas. Table 4 lists the results for grid cells with census data in which four of the six population-related factors were found significantly correlated with disease incidence at different grid resolution: percentage of elderly population, percentage of cross district work population, net residential density and population density. Table 4 shows the results only for grid cells containing confirmed H1N1 cases. Population density emerged as the only factor showing a consistent relationship with disease incidence at different spatial resolution. Table 4 also shows improved performance in terms of the effect size of the correlation coefficients with decreased spatial resolution for all instances.
