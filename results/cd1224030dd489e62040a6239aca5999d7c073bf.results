During the study, 83 female coyotes tested positive for relaxin prior to parturition and appearance of pups (Table 1) . Concurrently, 26 females repeatedly tested negative and no pups were seen. Four females tested positive for relaxin although pups were subsequently never found, and because neither ultrasonography nor radiography was performed it remains inconclusive whether these four females were actually pregnant. In contrast, two females tested positive and were known to have experienced spontaneous abortions, confirmed by recovery of the expelled fetuses. In the first 2 years of the study, eight males, seven unmated females, and two females with castrated mates were also sampled ( Table 1 ). The OD measurements of these animals provided some guidelines as to how this assay would perform against plasma from non-pregnant coyotes. The measurements of these negative internal controls fell within the range of the manufacturer's negative controls throughout the study (Table 2) . Absorbance values were recorded for 82 full term pregnant females. A gestation length of 62 days was assumed (Gier, 1968; Kennelly, 1978) and the OD readings were aligned using the day of parturition as the reference point. Partitioning of the gestation period into weekly intervals showed optical density increasing by week 4 (Table 3) . When more than one sample was collected, it was possible to estimate the day of gestation based upon when a coyote first showed a positive relaxin test result (Table 4) . Under these conditions, the earliest positive result was obtained at an estimated 23 days gestation; on days 24-27 results either were negative, indeterminate, or positive. However, from day 28 on, all results were positive and had an OD ≥ 0.100 (Fig. 1) . We also note that while some negative and indeterminate results were recorded, at least 90% of the samples collected on days 25-27 were interpreted as positive (Table 4 ). An indeterminate threshold range of 0.030-0.050 OD was established based upon the absorbance values of the internal coyote controls and those of the manufacturer's reagents; and reinforced by the absorbance measurements recorded for the mated females with and without pups. All internal (coyote) controls were ≤0.032, and the difference between the maximum ReproCHEK TM negative control (0.037) and the minimum ReproCHEK TM positive control (0.051) was in the range of 0.038-0.050 (Table 2) . Samples (n = 69) from the 26 mated females without pups fell in the range of −0.005 to 0.072 (median 0.009 OD). The singular female with the OD measurement of 0.072 retested 2 weeks later at 0.033; and while 5 other samples in this group were also between 0.030-0.050, 62 samples (90%) were <0.030. Days are aligned from day of parturition and assume a common 62-day gestation for all females. % Pos: percentage of samples (n) testing positive per day. a Earliest day of gestation when a positive sample was observed. b All samples from day 28 forward tested positive. Serial blood sampling from five subjects revealed that within 48-72 h a pregnant female coyote could display a rapid increase in OD measurements representing a plasma-conversion from negative to positive. For example, one female changed from 0.015 to 0.117 in 2 days, while another from 0.012 to 0.160 in 3 days. This latter data suggested that the absorbance readings of females who were pregnant (true-positives) would quickly increase in intensity (Fig. 1) , thus differentiating them from non-pregnant cohorts within a short period of time. However, the timing of a sample collection might produce an indeterminate result (0.030-0.050 OD), and such results need to be rechecked. After parturition, 44 females were sampled initially during the first 4 weeks post-partum, then randomly sampled from weeks 9 to 20 (Table 5 ). All females continued to test positive (OD measurement >0.050) until day 72 when one female had an OD reading of 0.001. All other post-partum subjects remained positive until the next female tested negative (0.005) at day 87. Gradually all females reverted to negative levels ( Fig. 1 ) and the last OD measurement that was >0.030 was recorded on day 127.
