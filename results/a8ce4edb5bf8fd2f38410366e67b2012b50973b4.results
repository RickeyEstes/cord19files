In Hong Kong, a total of 183 questionnaires were sent to family medicine tutors with 137 valid replies (74.8%). In Toronto, 51 (34.0%) doctors replied. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the participating physicians from both regions. We observed that there were more male doctors and doctors with over 10 years of experience (in addition to postgraduate training) in the Hong Kong sample. In Hong Kong, 33 (24.1%) respondents diagnosed SARS cases in their community, whereas in Toronto, only 2 (4%) had diagnosed this disease. The majority of family medicine tutors from either Hong Kong or Toronto had no training in infectious disease control (84.6% and 80.0%, respectively) and lacked confidence in dealing with SARS (68.1% and 73.5%, respectively) ( Nearly identical proportions of doctors in the Canadian sample, 26 of 51 (51.0%) and in Hong Kong, 61 of 136 (50.7%) were classified in the high-anxiety group. Factors independently predicting anxiety are shown in Table 3 . In Hong Kong, older doctors who put high value on SARS information from television, those who put low value on information from the Hong Kong Medical Association Web site/circular, and those who did not lose income due to clinic closure were significantly more likely to be in the high-anxiety group. While gender was not quite significant (P 5 .11), this variable was included in the final model due to the large effect size, with women having close to two and a half times the odds of being in the high-anxiety group compared to men. For the Canadian sample, only having had previous training in handling infectious disease outbreaks was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of being in the high-anxiety group. There was a large discrepancy between the groups in their degree of satisfaction in how their respective governments handled the SARS epidemic: 23.1% and 72.5% of the Hong Kong and Toronto doctors, respectively, reported satisfaction (95% CI 0.05, 0.26). Table  3 shows that dissatisfaction with the government's handling of SARS by Hong Kong doctors was independently associated with being younger, having more clinical experience, working full-time, and feeling that the SARS screening tool changed too often. In Toronto, dissatisfaction was associated with not having had the clinic closed.
