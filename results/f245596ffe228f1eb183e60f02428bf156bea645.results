Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among 155 samples, two were BRSV-and three BPIV3-positive. Four of the positive samples were swabs, and one was a lung sample. The BPIV3-positive samples originated from Erzurum-AÅŸkale Province (swab), Erzurum-Aziziye Province (swab), and Erzurum slaughterhouse (2 nd period, Apr. 2014) (lung sample). BRSV-positive samples originated from Erzurum-Aziziye Province (swab) and Bayburt-Centre (swab). All animals identified as positive were young cattle. Phylogenetic analysis. Nucleotide sequences of the viruses identified in the study were closely related to Asian and European strains (Figs 1 and 2) . The phylogenetic analysis of the fusion (F) protein of BRSV showed that the identified BRSV strain belonged to subgroup III (subgroup A) and was in the same cluster as reference viruses (KU159366 strain USII/S1/USA and FJ543092 strain 375/Brazil). The matrix gene sequence of the BPIV3 strain sequenced from a BPIV3-positive sample was classified into a cluster of genotype C.
