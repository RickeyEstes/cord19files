Ferrets Infected with historical H1N1 strains show mild clinical symptoms. The ferret, Mustela putorius furo, is a superlative animal model for respiratory infections and the influenza ferret infectome has recently been published [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Ferrets show respiratory illness similar to humans and clinical features of disease are easily observed where fevers can persist days following infection of viruses such as 2009 H1N1pdm influenza 21, 23, 30 . As well as fever, nasal discharge and sneezing can also be observed in animals infected with influenza viruses 21 These influenza A viruses were chosen due to their emergence and influence in H1N1 genetic history (Fig. 1 , strains used in this study are marked with an asterisks) as covered in the introduction. Following infection, ferrets were monitored for body temperature, weight, inactivity level, sneezing and nasal discharge from each group were observed daily until Day 14 post-infection (pI). Infection by all strains produced an increase in temperature; the normal range for ferret temperature is indicated by the shaded area of each graph 23 ( Supplementary Fig. S1a ). The pandemic H1N1 strain NY/09 induced the greatest fever on Day 2 to a temperature of 104% (of baseline). NCal/99 and Marton/43 infection also caused a high temperature of 103% from baseline, which peaked on Day 1 and Day 2 pI, respectively ( Table 1) . USSR/77 and Taiwan/86 had moderate fevers and FM/47 had the smallest increase in temperature reaching only 101% above baseline ( Table 1) . Analysis of weight loss showed that animals infected with of all viruses except pandemic NY/09 were able to recover to original weight or greater following infection (Supplementary Fig. S1b and Table 1 ). NY/09 infected ferrets had the most significant weight loss compared to normal weight fluctuations (shaded area) 23 which peaked at 91% of baseline weight on Day 6 and Day 7. USSR/77 and NCal/99 reached less than 95% and 95% of baseline weight, respectively, on Day 2 pI ( Table 1) . Infection with Taiwan/86 produced the smallest amount of weight loss and animals infected with FM/47 did not lose any weight at all ( Table 1) . Secondary clinical signs were also measured and analysed for all infections, including nasal discharge, sneezing, and inactivity level (Supplementary Table S1 ). USSR/77 infected ferrets had the highest amount of nasal discharge and NY/09 ferrets had the greatest amount of sneezing and lethargy. Taken together, analysis of the complete clinical signs for each H1N1 strain infection suggested a unique clinical picture for each strain: NY/09 infection had the most severe with significant increase in temperature and an unrecovered weight loss compared to mildest strain, FM/47, which did not produce any weight loss and only a slight increase in temperature. Analysis of HA immunogenicity in historical H1N1 strains. The HA protein, a homotrimeric protein that functions in viral entry into host cells 31 , and antibodies reactive toward HA have been associated with host resistance and a decrease in disease severity [32] [33] [34] . It has been shown that 60% of antibodies produced during an influenza infection are reactive toward the HA protein 35 . After determining the clinical signatures of ferrets infected with historical and contemporary H1N1 viruses, we went on to analyze the aspects of H1N1 HA immunogenicity. The Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) assay, is a common assay used to determine the reactivity and/or amount of antibody to the HA protein produced during a viral infection and the cross-reactivity of antibodies raised toward these specific historically important H1N1 viruses has not been investigated. To determine the crossreactivity produced by infection among the historical and contemporary influenza strains, we used the harvested antisera from each ferret strain infection and perform HI assays with our panel of Table S2) . Interestingly, ferret anti-sera toward the Marton/43 virus showed HI with its own virus and with the older PR/34 but not with its nearest chronological neighbour FM/47 (Fig. 2a) . FM/47 and USSR/77 antisera recognized its respective virus and each other ( Fig. 2b and c) . Taiwan/86 and 2009 H1N1pdm (NY/09 or Cal/09) antisera both only reacted with their respective viruses ( Fig. 2d and h). NCal/99 antisera only showed HI with its own NCal/99 virus (Fig. 2e) . Unexpectedly, the SI/06 and Bris/07 antisera were able to inhibit the NCal/99 virus ( Fig. 2f and g) . Furthermore, SI/06 antisera also cross-reacted with the Bris/07 virus and the Bris/07 antisera recognized the SI/06 virus. Taken together, these results showed antigenic cross-reactivity to infection among historical and contemporary H1N1 influenza strains. This data suggested similarities of the host immune response between Marton Table S4 ). Importantly, no detection was observed for the Tawain/ 86 virus and earlier viruses with the WHO H1N1 seasonal control. Taken together, this work suggested that the WHO seasonal H1N1 antisera is only capable of detecting infection from recent seasonal H1N1 strains. We investigated the phylogenetic relationship and sequence homology of the HA gene among the H1N1 viruses used in this study and included other strains implicated in important historical H1N1 outbreaks. The temporal structure of phylogenetic tree was comprised of 3 groups separated by long braches (Fig. 3a) . The 1918 pandemic strains and 2009 pandemic isolates each formed their own distinct cluster. The middle cluster contained 10 epidemic isolates. Within this cluster, FM/47 was closer to USSR/77 than Marton/43 which was more similar to PR/34. The 3 latest strains of seasonal H1N1, NCal/ 99, SI/06 and Bris/07, were positioned as a clade which was separated from the early stains by a long branch and clustal alignment of these three viruses ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ) showed several amino acid changes from NCal/99 and conserved between SI/06 and Bris/07: A3V, T99K, Y111H, K157E, V182A, R224K, W268R, T283N, and N489D. We calculated the protein homology by using the most variable region of the HA gene (HA135-295) which covers most of the viral surface and sequence change in this area has a strong impact in immunogenicity 36 . We found that 94% and higher homology scores led to HI cross-reactivity in all the cases. On the other hand, crossreactivity with lower homologies of 91-93% may or may not take place (Fig. 3b) . Taken together, our results suggested an important relationship and cross-reactivity between FM/47 and USSR/77 as well as the NCal/99, SI/06 and Bris/07 group that can be related to the genetic HA sequence. Further analysis of other influenza genes may also be important to the understanding of H1N1 evolution.
