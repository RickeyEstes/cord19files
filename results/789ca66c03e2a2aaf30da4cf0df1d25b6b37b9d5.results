The focus on influenza will also undoubtedly have been at least in part due to the highlighting of emerging strains with pandemic potential. The strong correlation between burden and investment is encouraging with, broadly, the high-burden diseases receiving greater funding (pneumonia being the key exception), and lower-burden infections less funding. Within therapeutics research, the proportionately-greater investment for tuberculosis compared with influenza seems appropriate, as does the tuberculosis-related focus within diagnostics. New high-impact infection threats to humans are often respiratory in nature. From SARS to influenza to Middle East respiratory syndrome, these have the potential to be highly virulent with rapid transmission and global spread, and with substantial health and economic impact. Although difficult to accurately quantify, in our dataset there was little funding for research to develop predictive epidemiological models for future pandemics -which would be an important part of infection prevention and control. However, caution must be exercised when developing these epidemiological There was limited funding for pneumococcal and pneumonia research. Whilst infections such as meningitis may be in decline in some countries due to successful introduction of new vaccines, 22 there are still many areas globally with weak health systems where pneumococcal incidence is high. There is also evidence of respiratory infection transmission at mass gatherings, such as the Hajj. 23 In addition to providing meningococcal and influenza vaccination for travellers, there should be investment in operational research to explore health system responsiveness to emerging threats and efficient ways to provide preventive medicines, as well as measuring the effectiveness of preventive therapies. There was very little funding for translational research relating to pneumonia, a clear gap in the UK portfolio. Other vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis, which are causes of high disease burden globally, also received very limited research funding despite there clearly being the need for translational and operational research. 16 The worldwide burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis is rapidly increasing, with WHO estimates of 630,000 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis worldwide, great variation between countries, and emergence over the last decade of extensively drug-resistant cases. 24 Given the difficulties of developing a more effective vaccine, 25 the need for new diagnostics, therapeutics and targeted use of existing medicines becomes even more important. The reported resistance to antiviral drugs used to treat influenza 26 emphasises the need to for develop effective antivirals and effective vaccines. There is a paucity of research in antimicrobial resistance. 27 This is of concern, and has been highlighted by the UK Chief Medical Officer, 28, 29 with new funding for research related to antimicrobial resistance provided. 30 We believe that other funders should follow this lead. Most countries are under-investing in tuberculosis R&D 31 Our study has several limitations, which have been highlighted and discussed in detail elsewhere. 16 There was little publicly-available data from the pharmaceutical industry. Hence, there is a data gap in relation to funding of clinical trials and development of vaccines and diagnostics, which the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are financing. Beyond disease burden, other measures, such as economic burden should also be utilised when prioritising limited resources, but little information is available regarding the economic impact of respiratory infections. We rely on the original data being complete and accurate, and are unable to take into account distribution of funds from the lead institution to collaborating partners, nor can we assess quantity of each award given to overheads or the impact of the introduction of full-economic costing. Also, assigning studies to categories is a subjective and imperfect process -although we used two researchers to do this to reduce inter-observer error. Our study focuses on UK-led investments -we do not know if similar patterns (e.g. a dominance of pre-clinical research and lack of public or charitably-funded clinical
