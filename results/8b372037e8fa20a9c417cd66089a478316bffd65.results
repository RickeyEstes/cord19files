Identification of residues in PCPa domain of PRRSV nsp1a those are important for inhibiting IFN production Previously others and we have demonstrated that PRRSV nsp1a is an inhibitor of IFN-b induction Chen et al., 2010) . The current experiments are intended to map the residues/domains of nsp1a involved in suppressing IFN production. Alanine substitutions (3 aa to 5 aa) were made in both N-terminal zinc finger domain (1-65 aa) and the PCPa domain (66-166 aa) (Sun et al., 2009 ) of nsp1a. These alanine scanning mutants are designated by the aa residue number of the first aa, followed by the number of residues mutated to alanine e.g., mutant 10-5A has aa residue number 10 to 14 substituted by alanine. It is possible that, these substitutions might affect correct processing of the nsp1a-nsp1b junction by nsp1a protease, which is important for virus viability. To ensure correct processing of this junction, these single amino acid substitutions were made in the background of a full-length nsp1 expression plasmid in which the nsp1b protein has been rendered inactive for ISG56 promoter inhibition. They were first checked for successful cleavage of the nsp1a-nsp1b junction and then subjected to ISG56 reporter assay. The ISG56 reporter vector contains tandem repeats of IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter elements, which can be activated by IRF3/IRF7. ISG56 reporter assay of these mutants showed that mutants (89-5A, 93-3A, and 97-4A) involving amino acid residues 89 to 100 are relieved of their IFN-suppression property (Fig. 1A ). However residue 96 was not part of these mutants. None of the mutants in the N-terminal zinc finger domain were able to relieve the IFN-suppression. Four single amino acid substitution mutants of nsp1a (G90S, L91A, N92A and R97A) in the 89 aa to 100 aa region showed almost complete relief of the inhibitory effect (Fig. 1B) . Since several viral proteases that down regulate IFN production can degrade certain signaling intermediates in the IFN induction pathway (Li et al., 2005a (Li et al., , 2005b , it is possible that nsp1a's IFN suppression activity is mediated through its protease activity. The exact protease active sites of the proteins were determined on the basis of pairwise sequence alignment of the FL12 strain (used in this study) to that of Lelystad strain (Kroese et al., 2008) .To examine whether nsp1a proteolytic activity is essential for its IFN-antagonism, we generated mutants containing alanine substitution of nsp1a protease active site residue His146. This mutant did not alter nsp1a's IFN-suppression ability (Fig. 1C) . Thus, our mutational studies identified four specific amino acids of PRRSV nsp1a responsible for its IFN-antagonism. Several amino acid stretches of nsp1b are involved in its IFN-suppression function Our subsequent experiments were intended to map the residues/domains of nsp1b involved in suppressing IFN production. Initially, six mutants of nsp1bs were made; each with 30 aa block deletions, and their ability to reduce the IFN-suppression was analyzed by ISG56 reporter assay. To our surprise, all mutants completely relieved the IFN-inhibitory property of wt nsp1b (data not shown). This suggested that the 30 aa block deletions of nsp1b might results in gross deformations in the protein tertiary structure which likely results in nonfunctional protein and thus having no effect on ISG56 promoter. Therefore, we decided to perform alanine-scanning mutagenesis where short amino acid stretches (5-7 aa) of wt nsp1b were replaced by alanine. The crystal structure of PRRSV nsp1b was solved and the protein has been found to possess three distinct domains: the N-terminal nuclease domain (1 aa to 48 aa), the linker domain (49 aa to 84 aa) and the C-terminal cysteine protease domain (85 aa to 181 aa) (Xue et al., 2010) . All the three domains were targeted for mutagenesis and most of the residues mutated are well conserved among type II PRRSV strains. The resulting 15 different mutants were then tested for protein expression and their ability to suppress ISG56 promoter activity. There were wide variations in the protein expression level of the different mutant nsp1b relative to wt nsp1b in transient transfection assays, with some mutants exhibiting higher levels of protein accumulation, while others showing lower levels than wt nsp1b ( Fig. 2A bottom). The ISG56 reporter assay results showed variable degree of alleviation in the IFN-suppression effect, with the highest exhibiting 60% relief ( Fig. 2A top) . The cysteine protease activity of nsp1b is essential for its proteolytic processing of the nsp1b-nsp2 junction, which leads to the release of nsp1b from the polyprotein. To examine whether nsp1b proteolytic activity is essential for its IFN-antagonism, we generated mutants of nsp1b with the individual protease active sites mutated to alanine (C90A and H159A). When tested for their IFN-inhibitory property in an ISG56-luc assay, these mutants showed similar or even stronger suppression of the ISG56 promoter as measured by response to dsRNA stimulation (Fig. 2B ). We conclude that the protease active sites of nsp1b are not critical for down regulation of IFN induction. Taken together, we identified several mutant nsp1b with mutations located in all the three domains with reduced ability to suppress induction of an IRF3 dependent promoter in response to dsRNA treatment.
