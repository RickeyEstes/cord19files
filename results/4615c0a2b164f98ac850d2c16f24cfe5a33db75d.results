Detection of interactions between SNAREs with imaging ellipsometer. The cytosolic regions (without the transmembrane domain) of Sso2p, Sec22p and Ykt6p were expressed in E. Coli and purified to high quality (Fig. 1 ). To detect their interactions, we designed the microfluidic array as illustrated in Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b . According to the design, the interactions among three SNAREs were detected in 12 parallel areas (Fig. 2c) . The application of target proteins will form a layer on a chip, and the interacting partners will form another layer on the chip (Fig. 2d) . The light reflection intensity represented by grayscale value indicates the thickness of the SNARE protein film. Thus the increase of the grayscale value after the addition of potential interacting proteins could indicate the interaction strength. Fig. 3 shows the changes in grayscale values for bindings between Sso2p, Sec22p and Ykt6p. The corresponding Pvalues were calculated with single factor analysis of variance in Microsoft Office Excel 24 . As observed in Fig. 3 , the protein A-IgG pair, the positive control on the microfluidic chip, demonstrated significant change in grayscale value in both directions (immobilizing protein A then adding IgG (P-value 5 0.0002); immobilizing IgG then adding protein A (P-value 5 0.0295)). Notably, for the Sso2p-Sec22p pair, we also observed significant change in grayscale value in both directions (immobilizing Sso2p then adding Sec22p (P-value 5 0.0273); immobilizing Sec22p then adding Sso2p (P-value 5 0.1227)). In addition, the Sso2p-Ykt6p pair could be regarded as positive interaction as there observed a significant change in grayscale when Ykt6p was added to the immobilized Sso2p (P-value 5 0.0084). In static measurement, rinsing may cause remarkable false negatives especially for weak interactions. But false positives will not occur in high frequency. In this regard, the static ellipsometry measurement is reliable for weak interaction detection and it can be used as a rapid and convenient screening method before kinetic analysis. We carried out the SPR assay over a range of analyte concentrations to check the two positive interactions in imaging ellipsometer assay. In SPR assay, Sec22p/Sso2p and Ykt6p/Sso2p (see Methods) also showed positive signal. After Sso2p was immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip, Ykt6p was injected into the Sso2p channel at the concentration of 5 to 80 mM. Sec22p was injected into the Sso2p channel at the concentration of 1.25 to 40 mM. Supplemental Fig.  S1 showed sensorgrams for the binding of Ykt6p (Fig. S1a) and Sec22p (Fig. S1b) to immobilized Sso2p. Sso2p was immobilized at 3938 RU. Ykt6p and Sec22p showed steady increase of the RUs during injection but the response levels in RU were extremely low at all concentrations of both analytes in relation to the theoretical analyte binding capacities. The weak signal may result from the large portion of inactivation of ligand in covalent immobilization step by amine coupling or the extremely low binding affinities of the interactions. In this study we would like to regard the SPR data as a qualitative evidence to estimate the binding specificities of the two SNAREs' interactions instead of evaluating their binding affinities. The agreement between the SPR and imaging ellipsometer results demonstrated the interactions between the three SNARE proteins. The interactions at protein level were also consistent with Y2H result at domain level 7 . Previous study also showed that the R-SNAREs Sec22p and Ykt6p can substitute for each other in the fusion of ER-derived transport vesicles with the cis-Golgi 25 .Their similar interaction pattern with the Q-SNARE Sso2p observed in our study reinforces that the two R-SNAREs are functionally identical. Kinetic analysis of Ykt6p/Sso2p and Sec22p/Sso2p interactions with real-time imaging ellipsometer. To gain a deep understanding of the SNARE pairing, we further took advantage of the real-time function of imaging ellipsometer to characterize the binding affinity of Sso2p/Ykt6p and Sso2p/Sec22p. As seen from the sensorgrams for analysis of Ykt6p/Sso2p (Supplemental Fig.  S2 ), reaction curves showed the dynamic changes in grayscale value during the whole analysis process including the stages of ligand immobilization and analyte injection. Fig. 4 highlighted the reaction curves of Sso2p/Ykt6p and Sso2p/Sec22p at various protein concentrations. Real-time binding curves were fitted (Supplemental Fig. S3 ). Coefficient of determination (R 2 ) was used to measure goodness of fit in Fig. S3 . The range of R 2 : 94% , 99% showed the consistence between the fitted curves and experimental curves, allowing us to obtain the association rate constant (k a ), the dissociation rate constant (k d ) and thus association constant (K A ) (K A 5 k a /k d ) and dissociation constant (K D ) (K D 5 k d /k a ) for the interactions. The kinetic constants of Sso2p/Ykt6p and Sso2p/Sec22p were summarized in Table 1 . The k a , k d , K A and K D were 10 2 M 21 S 21 , 10 23 S 21 , 10 4 M 21 and10 25 M, respectively.
