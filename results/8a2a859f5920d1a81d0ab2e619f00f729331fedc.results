Expression and purification of recombinant MaMIF. Although MIF was the first described cytokine, its role in some important pathophysiological conditions across different species have remained unclear. MIF from human and mouse or even from different human parasites have been structurally and functionally characterized [41] [42] [43] . In this study, we cloned and purified MaMIF as described in the materials and methods section. In one of our previous studies, we had cloned MaMIF coding sequence (CDS) from mRNA isolated from hamster pancreatic stellate cells 11 . The mouse genome is known to harbor multiple MIF-related sequences; however, only the true Mif gene has an intron/exon structure and a 5′ untranslated region 44 . Although the mouse MIF-related pseudogenes are highly homologous to cDNA, those contain different mutations that would generate truncated or altered MIF-like proteins. Hence, before cloning the hamster Mif CDS into the expression vector, we checked the hamster Mif genome organization. In silico analysis of recently updated genome sequence available in NCBI database (NW_004801628.1) confirmed that the Mif CDS cloned in this work is from the true Mif gene, which has a similar genomic organization as the human and mouse genes ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The expressed and purified MaMIF showed an approximate molecular mass of 12.5 kDa with more than 95% purity as observed from 18% SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 1A) . Comparison of the elution volume of MaMIF with low molecular weight protein standards in the analytical size-exclusion chromatographic experiment suggested the molecular mass of MaMIF in solution to be approximately three-times higher (39 kDa) than the monomer mass (12.5 kDa). This result indicates that the purified recombinant MaMIF exists as a trimer (Fig. 1B) , like human and mouse MIF. The CD spectroscopic analysis showed the recombinant protein to be properly folded. The secondary structure content of the protein was estimated to be 27% α-helix, 54% β-sheet, 8.8% turns and 10.2% unordered structure, with an RMSD and NMRSD values of 0.40 and 0.0237, respectively, as given in the form of a pie chart along with the profile (Fig. 1C) . The Western blot analysis revealed the cross-reactivity of MIF polyclonal antibody (NBP1-81832; Novus Biologicals) towards MaMIF and further confirmed successful expression and purification of the protein (Fig. 1D) . Immunoblot analysis using a non-MIF primary antibody with similar isotype (rabbit IgG) as a negative control showed very minimal background signal compared to the MIF-specific primary antibody (Fig. 1E) .

Alignment of the primary sequences of MIF from hamster, mouse, and human was performed with PRALINE program. Figure 2A indicates that MaMIF shares 93% and 89% sequence identity with mouse MIF and human MIF, respectively. The alignment reveals that the residues responsible for tautomerase activity and substrate binding such as Pro2, Lys33, Ile65, Tyr96, and Asn98 are conserved in MaMIF as well. In addition, the 'CALC' motif required for oxidoreductase activity is also conserved in MaMIF ( Fig. 2A) . As both the tautomerase and oxidoreductase sites are present in hamster MIF, it might have similar enzymatic and biological activities as that of human and mouse MIF. The phylogenetic analysis of MIF from hamster, mouse and human was carried out using the Neighbor-Joining method with the help of MEGA 7 software further confirmed that MaMIF is evolutionarily closer to the mouse MIF than human MIF (Fig. 2B ). Crystal Structure of MaMIF. The data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1 . The crystal structure of MaMIF was resolved to 1.8 Å resolution. It forms a trimer, with three identical molecules in an asymmetric unit. A monomer of MaMIF is made up of six beta strands, four of which form a mixed beta sheet within one subunit, two antiparallel alpha helices and two shorter beta strands on either end of the sheet (Fig. 2C) . Also, a very small beta strand (β7) is present towards the C-terminus. The monomer structure is highly conserved among MIF from human, mouse and hamster, as could be observed from the structure alignment (Fig. 2C ). The RMSD for the Cα backbone atoms between hamster and human MIF (PDB id: 3djh) and between hamster and mouse MIF (PDB id: 1mfi) are 0.24 Å and 0.26 Å, respectively. The trimer adopts a barrel-like architecture formed by three inter-connected monomeric subunits (Fig. 2D ), as has been reported for other MIF structures. The trimeric MaMIF structure is retained by the short beta strands β3 of one monomer and β6 of the third monomer becoming part of the beta sheet formed by the beta strands β1, β2, β4 and β5 of the second monomer in between, together forming a six-stranded beta sheet. Herein, β3 of monomer-1 comes in close proximity and form hydrogen-bond network, typical of beta sheets, with β2 of the monomer-2 and β6 of monomer-3 comes close to β5 of monomer-2. This contribution of beta strands by all three monomers to their respective adjacent monomers to form beta www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ sheets seems to provide stability to the trimeric structure. In the trimeric ring structure of MIF, the beta sheets of the three monomers together form a solvent-accessible central water channel, whose role in the context of MIF function is still not known 41 . A MIF trimer has been reported to have three catalytic pockets for tautomerase activity, located in the monomer-monomer interface between the three monomers (Fig. 2D) . The residues Pro2, Lys33 and Ile65 from one monomer and the residues Tyr96' and Asn98' from its adjacent monomer 45 , together form the catalytic pocket responsible for the tautomerase activity in human and mouse MIF and these residues are conserved in MaMIF as well. This would explain why MaMIF also shows tautomerase activity (described in the next section). Tautomerase activity of human MIF is known to be inhibited by the MIF-inhibitor ISO-1 46 . ISO-1 binds to the residues Pro2, Lys33, Ile65, Tyr96, and Asn98 47 , all of which form part of the tautomerase catalytic site located at the interface of two monomers (Fig. 2E, Supplementary Fig. 2) . The aromatic ring of human MIF Tyr96 and the hydroxyphenyl ring of ISO-1 make a π-interaction, wherein, the angle between the ring planes is 78° and the distance (edge-to-face) between the ring centroids is 4 Å. As the residues of the catalytic pocket and ISO-1 binding are completely conserved in MaMIF (Fig. 2F) , ISO-1 and other similar compounds binding to the catalytic pocket would block MaMIF catalytic function as well. Several reported MIF structures have sulfate ions bound to the positively charged residues lining the central solvent channel (involved in transporting the negative ions/ligands) or to the peripheral helix of MIF [48] [49] [50] . However, the MaMIF structure from this work did not have any sulfate ions, presumably because the final crystallization condition did not have any sulfate. Tautomerase activity of MaMIF. Unlike all other cytokines, MIF has a tautomerase activity, and it performs this enzymatic function through an N-terminal catalytic proline base 51 . In this study, the tautomerase activity of the purified MaMIF was analyzed using L-dopachrome methyl ester substrate. The activity was determined after background correction for the non-enzymatic activity (dopachrome dependent non-specific activity; Supplementary Fig. 3A,B) . As the linear range of the kinetic assay for the L-dopachrome methyl ester is too short, the slope value from the initial linear part (ranging from 0 to 15 sec.) of the declining curve (Δ abs. s −1 ) was considered to determine the activity (Supplementary Fig. 3C) . Supplementary Fig. 3D shows that BSA by itself, which was used as a negative control has no tautomerase activity. However, the addition of MaMIF to the BSA showed enzymatic activity. The rate of tautomerase activity of the protein (i.e., the amount of the product formed per second) showed a typical enzymatic response, wherein activity increased with increasing concentration of protein at lower concentrations and revealed a saturation tendency at higher concentrations (Fig. 3A) . The initial velocities of the reaction were measured as a function of substrate concentration from 0 to 800 μM (nmol ml −1 ). The data presented in Fig. 3B was used to determine the K m by non-linear least-squares fit method following a simple Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 3C) . The calculated K m value is 665 μM (nmol ml −1 ).
