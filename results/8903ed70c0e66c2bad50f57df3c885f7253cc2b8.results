Fragment screening. In total, 34,409 fragments were computationally docked into the canonical active site and the gatekeeper pocket of CypD by means of the FlexX programme. Forty-four fragments were selected based on their mode of interaction. Their ability to interact with CypD was further studied by means of NMR spectroscopy. Ten fragment hits with low-affinity dissociation constants (millimolar range) were identified (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Their scaffolds and proline-mimicking motifs were used to select in cerebro a set of 52 derivative fragments for subsequent X-ray crystallographic experiments. Apo CypD crystals were soaked with each of the 52 fragments. X-ray structures of CypD complexed with 14 fragments were obtained. Supplementary Fig. 2 shows the chemical structures of the 14 binding fragments. Four fragments (9, 11, 12 and 13) bound the catalytic site of CypD, whereas five fragments (6, 15, 16, 17 and 18) bound the gatekeeper pocket. Fragment 14 bound between the two sites. Finally, four fragments (5, 19, 20 and 21) were nonspecific multibinders. The density map of each fragment is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3 and at (https://figshare.com/ articles/Stereo_views_of_cocrystal_structures_of_cyclophilin_in-hibitors_with_cyclophilin_D/3490493). The ability of each fragment to inhibit cyclophilin activity in vitro was assessed in cell-free enzyme assays for CypA, CypB and CypD. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of the 14 fragments were 45 mM in all instances. Fragment selection for linking. Among the 14 fragment hits, the final selection of compounds 6 and 13 for subsequent compound optimization was based on a number of criteria, including their ligand efficiency, their ability to access key regions, their synthetic tractability and the possibility to link them to generate ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms12777 compounds binding both the catalytic site and the gatekeeper pocket. The X-ray crystallographic structure of CypD complexed with fragment 6, solved at a resolution of 1.10 Å, showed that this fragment deeply buried into the gatekeeper pocket, a hydrophilic region (Fig. 2a) , and its amino group displaced a water molecule present in this pocket in the apo form of CypD. Within the gatekeeper pocket, fragment 6 made one direct hydrogen bond with Thr107 and two hydrogen bonds with Ala101 and Gln111 through a water molecule (Fig. 2b) . The crystallographic structure of CypD in complex with fragment 13 was solved at a resolution of 1.35 Å (Fig. 2c ). In addition to its hydrophobic contacts with Phe60, Met61, Phe113 and Leu122 within the catalytic site of CypD, fragment 13 directly interacted with Asn102 via a hydrogen bond (Fig. 2d) . Linking strategy. Superimposition of fragments 6 and 13 with the known structures of CsA and SfA, two cyclophilin inhibitors, suggested that a urea moiety could be used as a linker between the two fragments, because of one hydrogen bond with Gln63 and two with Asn102 (Fig. 2e ). Compound 22, consisting of fragments 6 and 13 connected by a urea moiety, was thus generated (Fig. 2f) . This compound inhibited CypD activity, with an IC 50 of 6.2 ± 3.7 mM ( Table 1) . The structure of CypD complexed with compound 22, obtained at a resolution of 1.93 Å, revealed binding to both the gatekeeper pocket and the catalytic site ( Fig. 3a and b) . Compound 22 maintained the key interactions of fragments 6 and 13 within their respective pockets, while making one, one and two additional hydrogen bonds with Arg55, Gln63 and Asn102, respectively (Fig. 3b) . The binding mode of compound 22 to CypD was confirmed by means of NMR experiments. The CypD 15 N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum revealed significant chemical shift perturbations on ligand binding only for residues located at or near the catalytic site and gatekeeper pocket, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Cross-peaks of Gly151, Asn144 and Asn145 disappeared on ligand addition, likely to be due to intermediate chemical exchange, demonstrating that these residues are part of the binding site and the corresponding amide protons are located at proximity of the ligand. Compound 22 also potently inhibited CypA and CypB (IC 50s : 13.1±5.9 and 6.1±3.8 mM, respectively). Structure-based lead optimization of the compounds. Structure-guided optimization was used to improve cyclophilin affinity and stability of the compounds. As ester functions are often associated with low biological stability, the first step was to replace the ester function of compound 22, which makes a key hydrogen bond with Arg55, without affecting the cyclophilin inhibitory potency. All designed compounds lacking the ester function lost their interaction with Arg55, resulting in a drastic decrease of cyclophilin inhibition (IC 50 4500 mM). This was the case of compound 23 (Table 1) complex (PDB code 1YND) the side chain of Arg55 is pushed by an oxygen atom of SfA, a phenyl-pyrrolidine moiety was added to generate compound 24 ( Table 1) . As shown in Fig. 3d , compound 24 shared the same binding mode as compound 22. In addition, the methoxy of the phenyl-pyrrolidine moiety displaced the side chain of Arg55, making a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl moiety of the urea motif ( Fig. 3e and https://figshare. com/articles/Stereo_views_of_cocrystal_structures_of_cyclophilin_ inhibitors_with_cyclophilin_D/3490493). Compound 24 proved to be a potent inhibitor of CypA, CypB and CypD PPIase activities, with IC 50s of 2.8 ± 0.6, 1.2 ± 0.1 and 11.4 ± 3.0 mM, respectively. A series of phenyl-pyrrolidine derivatives were then synthesized, including compounds 25-31 (Table 1) Table 1 shows the inhibitory effects of these compounds on CypA, CypB and CypD PPIase activities in enzyme assays. As compounds with an aniline motif have been reported to potentially bear toxic properties 25, 26 , a very large number of chemical modifications aimed at replacing compound 22's aniline motif, while retaining its PPIase inhibitory activity, were made. These included replacement of the amino group by the following: halogens (F, Cl and Br), hydroxyl, methoxy, ester and acetamide; replacement by pyridines, aminopyridines and heterocycles that sometimes contained an amine function, and fused or non-fused 6:6 or 6:5 bicycles; and substitution with methoxy or alkyl groups. The list and structure of the compounds tested for PPIase inhibitory activity is shown in Supplementary Table 1 . Among them, only compound 32, in which the aniline motif was replaced by an amino-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yl, retained the PPIase inhibitory potency of its parent compound, with IC 50 s of 7.4 ± 6.8, 8.7 ± 1.5 and 12.8 ± 2.5 mM for CypA, CypB and CypD, respectively (Table 1 ). In addition, replacement of compound 31's aniline motif by a 3-amino-pyridine led to the generation of compound 33, which, although less active than its parent compound, retained significant PPIase inhibitory activities, with IC 50 s of 4.2±1.6, 2.2±1.2 and 7.7±0.8 mM for CypA, CypB and CypD, respectively (Table 1) . On the other hand, macrocyclization was attempted to stabilize the bioactive conformation of the compounds. However, macrocyclic compound S69 (Supplementary Table 1 ) was inactive against cyclophilin PPIase activity. In contrast, the addition of a phenyl ring between the urea and carbonyl of compound 31 stabilized the bioactive conformation by a p-p interaction between the two phenyl moieties, leading to an at least threefold gain of anti-PPIase activity. Ultimately, compound 31 was the most potent cyclophilin inhibitor generated, with IC 50 s of 0.1 ± 0.07, 0.08 ± 0.04 and 0.2 ± 0.08 mM for CypA, CypB and CypD, respectively (Table 1) . Broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Huh7 cells harbouring an HCV genotype 1b replicon were treated with increasing concentrations of compounds 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32 and 33. As shown in Table 2 , all of them inhibited HCV replicon replication in a dose-dependent manner, with EC 50s ranging from 0.4 to 8.4 mM. Representative inhibitory curves are shown for compound 31 in Supplementary Fig. 8 . The EC 50s of CsA and compound 31, the most potent inhibitor, were in the same range (0.3 ± 0.1 mM versus 0.4±0.3 mM, respectively) and B40-fold higher than the EC 50 of the CsA derivative alisporivir (0.01 ± 0.0007 mM; Table 2 ). The compounds were not cytotoxic at their effective concentrations. The antiviral activities of compounds 26, 27, 29 and 30 were also assessed against HIV-IIIb replication in MT4 cells. All tested compounds inhibited HIV replication better than CsA, with EC 50s ranging from 3.6 to 15 mM. The compounds were not cytotoxic at their effective concentrations (Table 2) . Finally, the antiviral activities of compounds 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32 and 33 were assessed against human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) in MRC-5 cells. The seven tested compounds inhibited HCoV-229E replication with EC 50s ranging from 7.2 to 71.5 mM, without associated cytotoxicity ( Table 2) . Effect of NS5A protein substitutions on anti-HCV activity. The D320E and R318H substitutions in domain II of the NS5A protein have been reported to be associated with slightly reduced HCV susceptibility to the antiviral action of CsA and its nonimmunosuppressive derivatives 27 . The corresponding nucleotide substitutions were introduced in a genotype 1b subgenomic replicon by means of site-directed mutagenesis and the antiviral activity of compounds 27, 29, 30 and 31 was measured in the mutated replicons in comparison with a wild-type replicon. The results shown in Table 3 indicate that substitutions D320E and R318H very slightly reduced susceptibility to these compounds (1.0-to 2.8-fold change in EC 50 ), in the same order as the change in CsA and alisporivir susceptibility they induce. Lack of calcineurin inhibition properties. In addition to its anticyclophilin activity, CsA displays potent immunosuppressive properties through the formation of a stable ternary complex in a 1:1:1 stoichiometry with calcineurin, CypA and CsA, resulting in the inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase activity 28 . Although the new family of inhibitors is unrelated to CsA, preincubation studies were performed with the binary complex formed of CypA and compound 31, to determine whether this complex inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity. As shown in Supplementary  Fig. 9 , a dose-dependent decrease of calcineurin activity was observed in the presence of increasing concentrations of the CypA-CsA complex, used as a positive control of inhibition. In contrast, no inhibition was observed in the presence of the binary complex of CypA and compound 31. In addition, CsA potently inhibited interleukin (IL)-2 production in stimulated immortalized T lymphocytes (Jurkat cells) with an EC 50 of 0.005 mM, whereas compound 31 had no effect on IL-2 production (EC 50 420 mM). In vitro metabolism. Compounds 29 and 30 were assessed for their in vitro metabolism before compound 31 was synthesized. The results are summarized in Supplementary Table 2 . The measured octanol/water partitioning (LogD) values for compounds 29 and 30 were 2.5 and 2.6, respectively. Both compounds were very soluble at pH 7.4 and at pH 1.0. They were not degraded after incubation in PBS for 24 h at 37°C and slightly degraded after incubation in HCl 0.1 N at pH 1.0 for 24 h at 37°C (98% of compound 29 and 92% of compound 30 remaining at 24 h). Permeability was high for both compounds, whereas the efflux was negligible for compound 30 and low for compound 29 in monolayers of Caco-2 cells, suggesting a high absorption potential for the family. Binding to human plasma proteins was 85.0 and 85.1% for compounds 29 and 30, respectively. The high recovery indicated satisfactory plasma stability. Therefore, both compounds were predicted to display low shifts in biological potency in the presence of human plasma compared with cell culture medium. The metabolic stabilities were studied using human hepatic microsomal fractions in the presence of NADPH, to support oxidative metabolism. Compounds 29 and 30 were metabolized in microsomal fractions with in vitro half-lives of 21.6 and 35.5 min, respectively, yielding moderate predicted clearances. Neither compound 29 nor compound 30 was metabolized by CYP1A2 or CYP2B6. Both compounds were metabolized at the highest rate by CYP2C19. Compound 30, but not compound 29, was metabolized by CYP3A4. The relative contributions of the individual enzymes to the metabolism of the compounds could not be determined from these experiments, but the data suggested that compounds 29 and 30 were predominantly metabolized by CYP2C19 enzymes. Neither compound 29 nor compound 30 significantly inhibited CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6. Both compounds were moderate inhibitors of CYP2C8 and potent inhibitors of CYP3A, suggesting possible drug-drug interactions through the inhibition of CYP3A enzymes.
