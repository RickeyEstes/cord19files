Total activity of both disaccharidases decreases sharply in the apical portions of the villus-crypt unit because of small amounts of protein in apical homogenates. The net result of the different patterns of distribution is that 63% + 3% (mean +-SEM) of total lactase activity along the villus-crypt unit is present on the top 50% of the unit as compared with 51% + 3% of sucrase activity (P < 0.02)
