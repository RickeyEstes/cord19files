History and setting of the Kumbh Mela Kumbh in Sanskrit means pitcher and Mela means fair. In Hindu mythology, it is believed that the nectar of immortality was poured from a pitcher on four different places in India (Allahabad, Haridwar, Nasik and Ujjain), as a result of a long battle between the Gods and the Demons, which lasted 12 days and 12 nights. The Mela in its different forms alternates between these places. The Kumbh Mela happens once every 3 years in one of these locations on the banks of the corresponding rivers; Ganga in Haridwar, Godavari in Nasik, Kshipra in Ujjain and Sangam (confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers) in Allahabad (Fig. 1) . The Ardh (half) Kumbh is held every 6 years in Haridwar and Allahabad. The Purna (full) Kumbh and the Maha Kumbh (great/supreme pitcher) are held CMI every 12 years and every 144 years, respectively, only in Allahabad (9) . The Sangam, a place where the rivers meet in Allahabad, is very auspicious according to Hindu mythology and people believe that one dip in the waters of the Sangam at a precise moment in time can wash away all of a person's sins [11] . The total number of auspicious days varies depending on the total duration of the festival. In 2013, the festival in Allahabad lasted for 55 days with six important bathing days attracting close to 100 million people [12]
