The estimated reproduction numbers decreased over time as the norovirus outbreak spread through the international scout jamboree (Figure 3 ). We estimated an initial reproduction number of 7.26 secondary cases per primary case (95% predictive interval 5.26-9.25); 5 days after the enhanced hygiene protocol began, the estimated reproduction number dropped below 1 (Figure 3, black diamonds) . Under the hypothesis that transmission potential decreased abruptly when enhanced hygiene measures began, we estimated a reproduction number of 14.05 secondary cases per primary case (95% predictive interval 9.96-17.98) without enhanced hygiene measures and a reproduction number of 2.13 secondary cases per primary case (95% predictive interval 1.88-2.40) with enhanced hygiene measures ( Figure  3 , black solid line). This decrease corresponded to a relative reduction in reproduction number of 84.8% (95% predictive interval 81.2%-86.6%). The disease attack rate varied among different camps, from 2.3% to 10.7%; overall attack rate was 7.2% (Table) . For camps A and B, the estimated time course of reproduction number was initially high for the 2 index case-patients ( Figure 4, black diamonds) . Repeating the analysis with additional information about the host population structure and pathogen genotypes resulted in similar point estimates of the reproduction numbers (Figure 4 , gray boxes) but with narrower predictive intervals. The value of the initial reproduction number in each camp followed a time course consistent with 85% reduced transmission when enhanced hygiene measures were implemented (Figure 4 , black solid lines), indicating the time course of the reproduction num-bers did not depend on the time of introduction of norovirus in the camp-because this differed between camps-but on the time the enhanced hygiene protocol began, which was identical for all camps.
