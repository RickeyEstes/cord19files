During the last 38 years, 1052 cases of EVD have been reported in the DRC, of which 996 are reported in this dataset. The geographical context, historical timeline, and main characteristics of these outbreaks are depicted in Figure 1 and Table 1 . A detailed account of the outbreaks can be found in Appendix 1, Section B. The early accounts of all outbreaks except for Mweka 2007 involved a healthcare facility. The direct epidemiological link between index cases (when known) and animal reservoirs has not been found for any of the outbreaks. The lack of systematic surveillance together with the presence of diseases with similar symptoms allows EVD cases to go unnoticed for long periods of time. A repository of the interventions that led to the control of the outbreaks is outlined in Supplementary file 2. Table 2 summarises the number of cases and deaths reported in each outbreak.
