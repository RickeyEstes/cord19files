At the time of this study, Canary contained 1,661 articles from 1966 to 2007. Of these, 465 (28%) were judged to be appropriate original epidemiological investigations that related animal disease data to human disease data. These 465 papers were further analyzed. Table 1 shows that the majority of studies linked animal and human data in a descriptive fashion (57%), thus describing or listing the number of cases in animals and humans without an attempt to predict future risk based on the results. This often includes the trapping of suspected animal reservoirs that are located in the vicinity of confirmed or suspected human cases. In these types of studies, results are often reported as percentage of positive cases in animals and percentage of positive cases in humans. Complicated or in-depth statistical analysis is often not conducted in descriptive linkage studies. Papers that used analytic methods ( [2, 13, 15, 18, 20, 21, ) to link animal and human data consisted of 6% of the articles retrieved and the methods used in each are summarized in Table 2 . For each paper, the primary author, the zoonotic disease, the animals studied (domestic, livestock, or wildlife), and our summary of the methods for analytic linkage are presented.
