Age and laboratory findings in studied groups are shown in Table 1 . Increased levels of IgE were observed in asthmatic patients when compared with non-asthmatic patients and controls. In general, the serum levels of IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-4, IL-5, MCP-1, and RANTES were increased in patients with acute viral respiratory infections ( Figure 1 ). Cytokine expression was similar in asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients; only chemokines (MCP-1 and RANTES) were significantly increased in asthmatic patients when compared with control and non-asthmatic patients. Asthmatic patients with bronchitis were not found (Figure 1 ). In general, serum chemokines (MCP-1 and RANTES) had lower levels in bronchitis than in pneumonia ( Figure 2 ). The infection by RSV, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus had similar cytokine induction; however, only RSV induced significant increased expression of chemokines ( Figure 3) . In vitro infection of normal monocyte cultures by RSV, parainfluenza virus, or adenovirus induced increased cytokine concentrations in culture supernatants; only RSV and parainfluenza virus were capable of inducing significant increase of MCP-1 expression (Figure 4) . No significant increased expression of IL-8 was found in patient's serum (control: 29Á55 AE 5Á81; viral ARI: 73Á58 AE 60Á30 pg/mL) or in viral-infected monocyte cultures (control: 648Á1 AE 164Á4; RSV: 978Á0 AE 239Á4; parainfluenza: 1133Á0 AE 250Á5 and adenovirus: 961Á3 AE 130Á2 pg/ mg protein). Expression of IL-4 was positively correlated with IL-5 expression (r = 0Á4662; P < 0Á001). There was no correlation between the studied serum cytokines and serum IgE levels. There was no association between the age of the donors and cytokine/chemokine production.
