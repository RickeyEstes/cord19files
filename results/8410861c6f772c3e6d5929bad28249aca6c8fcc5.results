3.1. The residues in the position 586 and 592 of nsp9 determined the replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV in PAMs To screen for the potential amino acid sites affecting the replication efficiency of PRRSV, we used the chimeric full-length cDNA clones (pWSK-RvJHn9n10 and pWSK-RvHJn9n10), and constructed a serial of full-length cDNA clones with mutated differential amino acid sites in nsp9 and nsp10 between JXwn06 and HB-1/3.9. Totally, 18 viruses with a single residue mutation were rescued ( Table 2 ). The replication efficiencies of these mutated viruses in PAMs were examined and compared by drawing growth curves, together with the parental viruses (RvJXwn, RvHB-1/3.9, RvJHn9n10 and RvHJn9n10). As shown in Fig. 1A , compared with the parental virus RvHB-1/3.9, the RvHJn9n10 with swapping nsp9-and nsp10-coding regions of JXwn06 had an increased replication efficiency in PAMs. While the HJn9n10-T586A with the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 of nsp9 had lower titers than RvHJn9n10, with significant differences at 36 h and 48 h pi (p＜0.01); the HJn9n10-S592T with the mutation of Ser to Thr in 592 of nsp9 also showed the decreased titers, with a similar level to RvHB-1/3.9, and its titers were significantly lower than RvHJn9n10 at 36 h (p＜0.01) and 48 h pi (p＜0.05). The viruses with other mutations in nsp9 and nsp10 showed similar growth kinetics to the RvHJn9n10 (Fig. 1B) . On other hand, we measured the growth kinetics of mutant viruses based on RvJHn9n10 with swapping nsp9-and nsp10-coding regions of HB-1/ 3.9. The results showed that RvJHn9n10 had a decreased replication efficiency than RvJXwn, but the viruses with mutated differential amino acid sites did not exhibit an increased growth efficiency than RvJHn9n10, even the viruses with the mutation of Ala to Thr in 586 and Thr to Ser in 592 of nsp9 (JHn9n10-A586T and JHn9n10-T592S) had slightly decreased titers ( Fig. 1C and D) . Obviously, these data indicate that it is insufficient to increase the replication efficiency of the chimeric PRRSV RvJHn9n10 by mutating only one amino acid. To further confirm the influence of the two residues (586 and 592 in nsp9) on PRRSV replication, we used the full-length cDNA clone (pWSK-RvJXwn) of JXwn06 and constructed a serial of full-length cDNA clones with mutated differential amino acid sites in nsp9 and rescued the viruses (JXwn-T586A, JXwn-S592T, JXwn-T586A/S592T, JXwn-A427T/D609G) (Table 2 ). Meanwhile, considering that the nsp10 of HP-PRRSV also plays a role in its fatal virulence for piglets (Li et al., 2014c) , we used the chimeric full-length infectious cDNA clone pWSK-RvJHn10 as backbone and mutated the corresponding amino acid sites, and rescued the viruses (JHn10-T586A, JHn10-S592T, JHn10-T586A/ S592T and JHn10-A427T/D609G) (Table 2) . Firstly, we evaluated the replication efficiency of these mutant viruses and their parental viruses in PAMs. As shown in Fig. 2A , the viruses with the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 or Ser to Thr in 592 or both had lower titers than the parental virus RvJXwn, with significant difference at 24 h pi (p＜0.05), and delayed peak. While the viruses with the mutation of other two residues together showed no change of the replication efficiency. Similar data were obtained in the mutant viruses based on pWSK-RvJHn10. The titers of the viruses with the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 or Ser to Thr in 592 or both decreased and their titer peaks delayed, while the viruses with the mutation of other two residues together had no significant differences in viral titers, compared with RvJHn10 (Fig. 2B) . Moreover, PAMs were infected with respective virus at a MOI of 1, and the copy numbers of nsp9 gene for the viruses were detected in order to evaluate the RNA synthesis efficiency by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 2C , the copy numbers of nsp9 gene of all viruses had a similar level at 0 h pi, while at 12 h pi, the average copy numbers of JXwn-T586A, JXwn-S592T and JXwn-T586A/S592T reached 7.16log10/μl, 7.46log10/μl, and 6.92log10/μl, respectively, which were remarkable lower than that of RvJXwn (7.74log10/μl) (p＜0.01 or 0.001), in addition to the JXwn-A427T/D609G with a similar level to RvJXwn. The RNA synthesis efficiency of the mutant viruses based on pWSK-RnJHn10 was also measured. The mutant viruses (JHn10-T586A, JHn10-S592T and JHn10-T586A/S592T), had the nsp9 copy numbers of 7.31log10/μl, 7.23log10/μl, and 6.95log10/μl, respectively, which were significantly lower than that of RvJHn10 (7.75log10/ul) (p＜ 0.001), while the virus JHn10-A427T/D609G showed no statistically significant differences in nsp9 copy numbers with RvJHn10 (Fig. 2D ). Taken together, the above results indicated that the mutations of the residues 586 and 592 in nsp9 decreased the replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV in PAMs, while the mutations of the residues 427 and 609 in nsp9 did not, suggesting that the residues 586 and 592 in nsp9 contribute to the replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV.
