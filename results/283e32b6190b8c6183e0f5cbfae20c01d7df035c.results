Data collection was carried out successfully. Data analysis is still ongoing and almost completed. We have already presented preliminary results at scientific meetings and promoted public discussions about the study. 60 Formal recommendations to national authorities and public education materials will be made available in written documents. The number of evaluations performed in each task is summarized in Table 2 . During Phase I we collected data on 45 DCCs (25 in Lisbon and 20 in Oporto). All participating and non-participating DCCs were included in the same management model (IPSS). As DCC selection procedure was stratified according to the district, the proportion of social strata/residential areas was expected to be similar in both participating and nonparticipating DCCs. Despite this, the non-participating DCCs could not be visited and no data was available to allow us to compare building characteristics with those of participating DCCs. The age of the buildings was very diverse with a median age of 50 years (P 25 ---P 75 : 20---134) ---the oldest built in 1579 and the most recent in 2008. In Phase I, CO 2 was used to select the DCCs to be included in Phase II as it allowed sampling of DCCs in two different clusters insofar as ventilation was concerned. The first cluster included 4 DCCs in Lisbon and 5 in Oporto. Percentages represent the proportion of individuals (DCCs or children) evaluated out of the eligible population at a given time point and ''---'' means that measurement was not applicable at that time. a Presented data concern the number of DCCs. Average CO 2 levels, indoor temperature and relative humidity were 2137 ± 368 ppm, 18.7 ± 2.2 • C and 57.4 ± 5.0%, equivalent to the cluster with worst ventilation conditions. The second cluster included 7 DCCs in Lisbon and 4 in Oporto. Average CO 2 levels, indoor temperature and relative humidity were 1233 ± 170 ppm, 20.1 ± 1.8 • C and 45.6 ± 5.9%, equivalent to the cluster with better ventilation. CO 2 (p < 0.001), indoor temperature (p = 0.025) and relative humidity (p < 0.001) differed significantly between the two clusters. Phase I questionnaire allowed us to collect some data on parental education, medical history and smoking at home. It was also possible to estimate the prevalence of wheezing in the previous 12 months, atopic dermatitis, reported asthma and food allergy. As for the response rate, 3186 out of 5161 questionnaires were returned (61.7%). About half of the sample (50.5%) were boys and the average age was 3.1 ± 1.5 years. During Phase II we had one DCC drop out during Visit 1 and two others during Visit 2. Indoor air quality was evaluated in 19 DCCs during Visit 1 and in 17 DCCs during Visit 2. Measurements included thermal comfort parameters, CO, CO 2 , PM 10 , TVOC, formaldehyde, bacteria, molds and dust mites. Information regarding indoor and outdoor values was collected. Objective ventilation measures were gathered during Visit 2 from 16 DCCs (7 in Lisbon and 9 in Oporto). The ventilation data are being used to create modeling software that may be useful in future studies. In relation to the questionnaires used in Phase II, we had different return rates. Of the 2287 ISAAC questionnaires handed out, 1221 were returned (53.4%). The average age of the sample was 3.5 ± 1.5 years, and 52.4% were boys. Data concerning non-respondents were available only for the DCCs included in Phase II, as many institutions considered these data confidential. With regard to the ISAAC questionnaire, no statistical differences were found for gender (p = 0.700) and age (children under 3 years versus children over 3 years: p = 1.00) between respondents and non-respondents. When the Phase I and Phase II samples were compared in terms of gender and age, the only significant difference between Phase I and the ISAAC questionnaire was that children in Phase II were slightly older. As for the questionnaires used to evaluate recent respiratory symptoms (follow-up questionnaires), 755 out of 1221 were answered during Visit 1 (53.3% of boys with an average age of 3.5 ± 1.5 years) and 667 out of 1411 during Visit 2 (54% of boys with an average age of <3.2 ± 1.6 years). During Visit 2, nitrates/nitrites and pH were measured in 100 exhaled breath condensate samples collected in Lisbon DCCs, and 94 samples from children of different DCCs were collected and tested for respiratory viruses, out of the target population of 1411 children. Finally, parental stress questionnaires were collected during both visits.
