On April 1, 19,574 contacts were identified for active screening. Between April and June 2005, 4934 patients were screened at least once, including 84% (912 of 1086) of inpatients on April 3. By the end of June, a total of 147 carriers and 4 clinical cases had been detected. The latter comprised 3 patients with bacteremia and 1 with wound infection, all of whom died from underlying comorbidities, which included metastatic carcinoma. PFGE analysis of these isolates demonstrated the presence of a major ''outbreak'' clone pattern, A, along with smaller clones, none of which bore any relation to the 2004 hematology outbreak. All of the clinical cases bore the ''outbreak'' clone pattern A. Of note, clone pattern B appeared to involve mainly ESRF patients (Fig. 2 ).
