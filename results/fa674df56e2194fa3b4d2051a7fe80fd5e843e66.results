The safety tests of the POLI-IF, carried out s.c. or i.m. on laboratory rodents had a positive issue: no general reactions were ascertained and local reactions were persistent small granulomas. Calves exhibited a small granuloma at the injection point and in some animals a mild hyperthermia and anorexia were seen within 24 h post injection. The reactions in pigs were similar to those seen in calves but the percentage of animals with general consequence was higher and ranged 10%. The efficacy tests in laboratory, performed on calves and piglets provided homogeneous results. The mean values together with the deviation have been reported in graphs: At the clinical examination local and general reactions previously described in the safety tests have been remarked. Hematologically, no remarkable modifications of the erythrocytes and hemoglobin rate were seen whereas in POLl-IF treated animals, a marked increase in the number of leukocytes was checked. In Figs 1 and 2 the mean values and the mean square deviation seen in calves and piglets are reported. With the horizontal lines the field is shown where the normal values of controls are framed. Following the injection the increase ofleukocytes reaches the peak within 12 h in piglets and in 48 h in calves. In such points the circulating leukocytes number is redoubled. Within 48 h following the peak the values get back to normal again. At the 2nd injection the increase of circulating leukocytes is rapid and the peak, in both animal species, is reached 24 h later. The values of the 2nd peak are higher than those of the previous one and even the duration of the phenomenon is longer. Within 72 h the circulating leukocytes in piglets get back to normal while in calves they are still double in number after 4 days from injection. The rate of circulating interferons is reported in Figs 3 and 4 for calves and piglets, respectively. The sudden appearance of circulating IFN is seen after POLl-IF injection and peaks are reached between 12 and 24 h, with mean values of about 100 U/ml. After the 2nd injection the phenomenon takes place again, but the peak shows higher mean values, nearly 140 U/ml and 260 U/ml in calves and piglets, respectively. Even the IFN, after the 2rid injection still remain in circulation for 24 h more than the first one. The serum bactericidal activity (SBA) is reported in Figs 5 and 6 for calves and piglets, respectively. The SBA has been followed only after the 1st injection for 4 days. In fact, we considered that the immunostimulator contains raw toxin of E. coli and the technique to find the SBA is based on the inhibiting activity of the serum towards a colibacillus. In such conditions the titration performed 5 days post injection could have also shown specific andibodies whose values summed to the specific ones would increase the SBA titres. In control calves the SBA has constant values, ranging between 63 and 68% (in Fig. 5 the values are reported in the form of horizontal lines). In injected animals the percent values rapidly increase and reached the peak within 72 h, with mean values of 86% and the SBA remains on such values for at least 24 h. In piglets the mean values of controls are constant around 70% (see horizontal lines in Fig. 6 ). After POLl-IF injection a rapid increase of SBA is seen, the peak being reached within 24 h, up to mean values of 97%. Subsequently, the activity rapidly decreases and 96 h post injection the values are already back to normal. The efficacy tests in the field, carried out in problem-herds allowed us to check the practical value of the immunostimulator [7, 8, 9] . In calves suckled artificially the conditioning factors that favoured the action of the opportunistic agents were: poor assumption of colostrum, sudden passing to the artificial suckling, crowding in sheds with unproper microclimate. In these breedings, infections generally affect both digestive and respiratory systems and within 1-2 weeks they rapidly involve most animals. Within 2 to 3 weeks, if properly treated, the same syndromes decline and gradually disappear. Losses are to be ascribed to lack of weight increases, high mortality, large number of discarded heads. The results obtained with the POLl-IF in 16 problem-herds with artificially suckled calves are reported in Table 4 . The first injection of the immunostimulator has been carried out on 50% of the animals as soon as they entered the breeding, that is when transport, crowding and the beginning of the artificial suckling already had a marked stressing action. The 2nd injection, in the previously treated subjects, carried out 7-10 days from the first one, generally matched the beginning of the conditioned pathology in the most debilitated calves. The effects were the same in all breedings, although the index of the affected animals shows differences in the breedings. As a whole, the results are positive and can be schematized as follows: The group of calves treated with POLl-IF had 2782 animals. Among these the conditioned infections affected 608 animals (21.8%). The agents in the different foci were IBR, PI3, Adeno-and Rotaviruses, E. coli, S. dublin, Pasteurellae and Mycoplasma. In the same breeding two or more opportunistic agents were always present at the same time. The reaction to the conventional therapy, though different from focus, was generally good, so that the mean duration of the disease slightly exceeded a week (8.7 days). Forty animals died (1.4%) and the discarded ones with chronic lesions or with a poor weight increase were 38 (1.4%). As a whole, losses due to mortality and discarding were 3.1% in treated groups. The groups of untreated control calves consisting of 2909 animals, even if belonging to the POLl-IF treated breedings, had even more severe damages. The conditioned infections affected 1931 animals (66.4%); the opportunistic agents involved were the same and even these animals were often attacked by 2 or more species of organisms at the same time. The reaction to therapy often resulted unsatisfactorily so that the mean duration of the disease was nearly three weeks (18.2 days). The mortality involved 249 heads (8.6%) while the discarded ones were 176 (6.1%). As a whole, animal losses in control groups were 14.7%. The differences, among control and treated groups were statistically significant: P < 0.005. In piglets at weaning the main stressing factors were transport, crowding, the sudden replacement of the maternal milk in the diet, the change of the environmental microclimate. Even in these animals the opportunistic organisms mainly involve digestive and respiratory systems within 7-10 days. The spread of the syndrome is rapid and the duration of the disease in the breeding is nearly 3 weeks, provided that the therapy is appropriate. Losses are due to a marked mortality, discard of irrecoverable animals owing to their chronic lesions, lack of weight increase, expensive mass-or individual therapy. In Table 5 are summarized the results obtained in different weaning cycles of 4 problem-herds, where nearly 50% of animals were treated with POLl-IF during their transport from delivery rooms to weaning sites. The remaining 50% consisted of untreated controls. After 7-10 days the POLl-IF was injected once again to treated animals. The results, even if slightly different from a cycle to another, can be summarized as follows. The groups of piglets treated with POLl-IF consisting of 4,387 animals had 264 heads affected with conditioned infections, the rate being 6.1%. The opportunistic agents were Rotavirus, Coronavirus-like, E. coli, Streptococci, Campylobacter spp., Bordetella bronchiseptica, Haemophilus spp., Pasteurellae, Mycoplasms, Coccidia, Trichomonas. In most cases, in the same group of animals, more opportunistic agents were seen, contemporaneously. However, the response of animals to the ordinary therapy was generally good. The duration of the disease in animal groups was nearly a week (6.3 days) and only 52 heads died, with a rate of 1.2%. The discarded animals were 13 (0.3%). Losses among treated animals were 65 (1.5%). The groups of untreated control piglets, are 4,461 heads. Among these the subjects with conditioned infections were 1,828 (40.9%). The opportunistic agents seen were the same of the POLl-IF treated groups. However, in spite of the same therapy, the incidence of the various syndromes was much more severe. The duration of the disease, in single animals, markedly exceeded 2 weeks (17.8 days); the individuals that died were 396 (8.8%); the discarded heads were 49 (1.1%). As a whole, losses among animals of control groups were 9.9%). The statistical differences among control groups and those of treated ones are rather significant: P < 0.005.
