The demographic characteristics of 159 eligible patients were reviewed. Forty eight of the patients were confirmed to be MERS-CoV RT-PCR positive while 111 were negative in MERS-CoV RT-PCR tests ( Table 1 ). Of the 48 MERS patients, 44 were hospital acquired and 23 HCW. Health care workers with MERS were more likely to be expatriates than MERS-CoV infected non-HCW (p<0.01) or MERS-CoV negative (p<0.01) patients. However, there was no difference between non-HCW MERS-CoV positive and MERS-CoV negative patients in this regard. Of the 23 HCW with MERS, 21 were from the Philippines, one was from Malaysia and one from India. Although MERS-CoV positive patients were overall more likely to be female (68.8% vs 49.6%; p = 0.04), the non-HCW MERS-CoV positive patients were not significantly different in this regard from MERS-CoV negative patients (56.3% vs 49.6%; p = 0.28). MERS patients who were non-HCW were more likely to be older (median age 60 years) than non-MERS patients (median age 33 years) (p<0.01) and HCW MERS patients (median age 36 years)(p = 0.01). The non HCW MERS patients were all persons who had been attended the hospital emergency room or those who were admitted for other reasons and acquired infection within the hospital. A history of exposure to animals (camel, dog or poultry) was more common in the MERS-CoV positive patients overall, compared with MERS-CoV negative patients (p = 0.04) ( Table 2) . A history of exposure to ill persons in a health care setting in the two weeks prior to onset of illness was more frequent in non-HCW MERS-CoV positive (95%) than in MERS-CoV negative (62%) patients (p = 0.01). The presenting clinical features and co-morbidities of MERS-CoV positive (HCW and non-HCW) and MERS-CoV negative patients are shown in Table 3 . Comparatively, MERS-CoV positive (HCW and non-HCW and negative patients had similar clinical presentations and comorbidities, except for diarrhoea that was more frequent in the MERS-CoV positive cohort. The frequency of reporting diarrhoea in the MERS-CoV positive HCW, MERS-CoV positive non-HCW and MERS-CoV negative patient groups was 11/23 (50%), 5/25 (23%) and 15/111 (16%) respectively. A statistically significant difference was observed when the frequency of diarrhoea was compared between the MERS-CoV positive patients (either HCW or non-HCW) and MERS-CoV negative patients (p = 0.02). Within the MERS-CoV positive cohort, shortness of breath, tachycardia and underlying co-morbidities (such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension and heart disease) were significantly more frequent amongst non-HCWs than in HCWs. The biochemical and haematologic parameters between the three groups were similar, except for higher white blood count (WBC) values in MERS-CoV negative patients and higher serum creatinine levels in MERS-CoV positive non-HCW compared with MERS negative patients (Table 4 ). There was no significant difference between the laboratory parameters of MERS-CoV positive HCW and non-HCW. Among the 48 patients with confirmed MERS, 47 had chest radiography available for review. Of these, 12 (25%) had normal chest radiographs at initial presentation, 21 (45%) had unilateral lung infiltrates and 14 (30%) had bilateral lung infiltrates. Seven (15%) of the total cohort never developed an infiltrate. Amongst those with normal initial radiographs, 3 (25%) and 2(17%) deteriorated and developed unilateral and bilateral infiltrates, respectively. Amongst patients with baseline unilateral infiltrates, 15 (71%) progressed and developed bilateral infiltrates; 4 (19%) had no changes. Two patients with bilateral infiltrates survived and had their lungs revert to normalcy. Table 5) . Among the patients with MERS-CoV infection, a poor clinical outcome (ICU admission or death) was significantly associated with older age, presence of co-morbid conditions, lower lymphocyte count, higher neutrophil count, higher serum creatinine and higher serum LDH levels, by univariate analysis (Table 6 ). Diabetes was the co-morbid condition most strongly associated with adverse outcome (p = 0.0002). In multivariate regression analysis, factors that remained associated with a decreased risk of death were younger age and being a HCW (Table 7) . Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, survival was shown to be significantly different in patients with MERS-CoV infection (taken together) in comparison with MERS-CoV negative patients (Fig 1 upper panel) . When MERS-CoV positive patients were stratified as HCW and non-HCWs, the former had better clinical outcome compared with non-HCW (p = 0.003) (Fig 1  lower panel) . MERS positive non-HCW had worse outcome that MERS negative patients (p<0.001). Survival time was not significantly different between MERS-CoV positive HCW and MERS-CoV negative patients (p = 0.45). Survival analysis confirmed than MERS patients without co-morbidities had markedly better survival than those with diabetes (p = 0.01), but there was no significant difference compared with patients with co-morbidities other than Table 4 . Comparison of laboratory parameters among three patient groups. diabetes (p = 0.54). Finally, MERS patients with diabetes had significantly worse survival that those with co-morbidities other than diabetes (p = 0.01) (Fig 2) .
