Altogether 2234 hospitalized children were recruited in the study, their ages ranged from 1 month to 14 years (median 8 months) and 66Á6% were male. Among all the tested children, 191 (8Á55%) were infected with HAdV. Further genotyping revealed 92 (48Á17%) infection with HAdV-7, 72 (37Á70%) with HAdV-3, 6 (3Á14%) with HAdV-55, 5 (2Á62%) with HAdV-5, 4 (2Á09%) with HAdV-1, 1 (0Á52%) with HAdV-2, and 11(5Á76%) with untyped HAdV (not sequenced due to running out of the samples).
