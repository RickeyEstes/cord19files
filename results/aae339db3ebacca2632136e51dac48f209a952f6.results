The SAa2-3Gal expression of primary CTE cells The distribution of SAa2-3Gal expression on the primary CTE cells was determined by the staining with a plant lectin, MAA (EY Laboratories). The ciliated cells were revealed by the intense fluorescent microvilli, labeled by the b-tubulin specific antibody [13] . Mucin 5AC glycoprotein and cytokeratin-14 (K14) were the specific markers for the goblet and basal cells, respectively [14, 15] . Immunocytochemistry (ICC) staining illustrated that most btubulin + cells expressed SAa2-3Gal terminal glycan (ratio of MAA + /b-tubulin + cells, 0.8760.06, n = 317) (Fig. 1A) . In a high magnification field, the intense spots of MAA signal were surrounded by cilia bundles on the ciliated cells (Fig. 1B) . In addition, MAA lectin could also be detected on the primary K14 + basal cells (ratio of MAA + /K14 + cells, 0.4660.12, n = 267) (Fig. 1G) . Interestingly, the MAA signals did not colocalized with the mucin-expressing cells (ratio of MAA + /mucin + cells, 0.00760.01, n = 223) (Fig. 1D) , indicating that goblet cells may not express the SAa2-3Gal glycans which show high affinity to the MAA lectin. However, for the immunohistochemistry in tissue sections, the distribution of SAa2-3Gal expression may show inconsistent distribution when different MAA/MALs were applied or the same lectins were from different providers [16, 17] . To further address the SA expression on goblet cells, MAL-I, same as MAA, was given by Vector Laboratories and applied to stain the CTE cells. We found that abundant MAL-I was detected on the b-tubulin + cells (ratio of MAL-1 + /b-tubulin + cells, 0.8260.10, n = 301) (Fig. S1), rather than the mucin + cells (ratio of MAL-1 + /mucin + cells, 0.0260.02, n = 201) (Fig. 1E ), similar to the result for MAA. Subtypes of SAa2-3Gal glycans with different subterminal sugars present varied affinity to MAA/MAL-I and MAL-II. Whether the SAa2-3Gal glycan is not expressed on goblet cells was further evaluated by MAL-II (Vector Laboratories). Surprisingly, 0.3760.12 mucin + cells (n = 594) were double-stained with MAL-II (Fig. 1F ), indicating that a glycan subtype that shows a high affinity for MAL-II only, was expressed on the goblet cells. We also found that only 0.3360.09 b-tubulin + cells (n = 230) can be labeled with MAL-II (Fig. 1C ). In addition, about half basal cells were MAL-II positive (0.5360.12, n = 265) (Fig. 1H ). The SAa2-6Gal expression of primary CTE cells The distribution of SAa2-6Gal on the CTE cells was determined by staining with SNA (Vector Laboratories). In contrast to the finding for MAA/MAL-I, abundant SNA signals were mainly restricted to the mucin + cells (ratio of SNA + /mucin + cells, 0.8560.09, n = 368) ( Fig. 2A) , indicating that the goblet cells expressed SAa2-6Gal terminal glycan. In addition, SNA lectin can also be detected in a one-third proportion of K14 + cells (ratio of SNA + /K14 + cells, 0.3660.09, n = 284) (Fig. 2B) . Especially, the SNA signal did not localize on the b-tubulin + cells (ratio of MAA + /b-tubulin + cells, 0.0160.01, n = 237) (Fig. 2C ). Testing the SNA-I, which was provided by EY Laboratories, showed no difference to the result of SNA, evidenced by the undetectable binding by SNA-I on the ciliated cells (Fig. 2D ). The SAa2-3Gal and SAa2-6Gal expression on basal cells Although both MAA and SNA bound to the surfaces of a subpopulation of the K14 + cells ( Fig. 1G and Fig. 2B ), their detected signals were relatively weak (Figs. S2A and S2B). To determine whether a single basal cells can express both SAa2-3Gal and SAa2-6Gal, CTE cells were triple-stained with K14 primary antibody (Cy5-2u Ab, purple), FITC-conjugated MAA (green) and biotin-labeled SNA (detected by Cy3-Streptovidin, red) (Figs. 3A, 3B and 3C). Their cell nuclei were revealed by DAPI staining (blue). When viewed in the same field under a confocal microscope, the ICC result indicated that MAA and SNA can be co-expressed on single K14 + cells (indicated by the arrows). The distribution and relative expression levels of SAa2-3Gal and SAa2-6Gal are summarized in Table 1 . It should be noted that because the relative affinities of the lectins to their targeted glycans may differ, comparing the intensity of staining between the MAA and SNA cannot be used as a quantitative comparison of the relative SAa2-3Gal and SAa2-6Gal expressions. In addition, the H6N1 viral antigens detected in the infected cells at a MOI of 0.1 were mostly restricted to the b-tubulin + cells at 6 h.p.i. (Fig. 5A ). Few H6N1 antigens were detected in the goblet cells or basal cells, possibly due to the low expression of AIV receptors (Figs. 5B and 5C). These results indicate that the ciliated cell, rather than the goblet or the basal cells, is the primary target cell for the AIV. In addition, these data also illustrate that the distribution of SAa2-3Gal expression among cells determines the cell tropism of the AIV H6N1 virus (as summarized in Fig. 6 and Table 1 ). The infectivity of H6N1 in CTE cells was further characterized at a MOI of 1. ICC results showed that the ciliated cells (Fig. 5D ), goblet and basal cells were all susceptible to infection by H6N1 as measured at 6 h.p.i. (Figs. 5E and 5F ). Although SAa2-3Gal expression was relatively low in goblet and basal cells, still 21.360.05% of goblet cells and 51.1610.9% of basal cells were infected. We speculated that the low infection of goblet cells by influenza virus at a high MOI might mediate through the binding to MAL-II specific SA or through a SA-independent pathway [18] . However, this hypothesis still requires the support from further experiments.
