After ED revenue adjustment and natural log processing, the series revealed good stability ( Figure 1 ). Generally, the original series of trauma, nontrauma, and pediatric visits were stable ( Figure 2 ). Although several peaks were noted in the three divisions and meteorological aspects, spectral analysis revealed no seasonal trends. The annual numbers of ED visitors from 2005 to 2008 were 22988, 20956, 22736, and 23416, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the variables for meteorological, clinical, and economic conditions in Taiwan during the study period. Mean maximum temperature ranged from 27.85 • C to 35.74 • C, and mean minimum temperature ranged from 8.90 • C to 25.22 • C. Monthly relative humidity was 62.96%-91.18%, and monthly rainfall was 18.73 mm to 568.93 mm with maximum rainfalls observed in June and September. Additionally, the largest fluctuation in the stock index occurred in 2008. The Spearman correlation analyses suggested that mean maximum temperature, relative humidity, accumulated rainfall, and stock index fluctuation were all positively correlated while mean minimum temperature was negatively correlated with monthly ED revenue, number of nontrauma visits, and number of pediatric visits, with lag time ranging from zero to two months ( Table 2) . Mean minimum temperature, accumulated rainfall, and stock index fluctuation were all positively correlated whereas mean maximum temperature and relative humidity correlated negatively with number of monthly trauma visits, with the lag time ranging from zero to two months. Table 3 shows the parameter estimates for the optimum ARIMA mode (1, 0, 0) for the series of monthly ED revenue. The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of the residuals showed a good data fit (data not shown). The residual plots showed small variations around the zero mean. In no case did the magnitude of these residuals exceed double the standard deviation. As a set, autocorrelations for residuals did not significantly differ from zero, and variance was consistent, which confirmed the adequacy of the model (Ljung-Box statistic = 22.04; P = 0.483). The analysis showed that mean maximum temperature, relative humidity, accumulated rainfall, nontrauma visits, and trauma visits were significantly and positively related to ED revenue, but mean minimum temperature was significantly and negatively related to ED revenue (P < 0.05). Table 4 shows the parameter estimates for the optimal ARIMA modes for the series of trauma visits, nontrauma visits, and pediatric visits. The autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions of the residuals also showed good data fit (data not shown). Mean minimum temperature and stock index fluctuation were significantly and positively associated with number of trauma visits (P < 0.05). Moreover, mean maximum temperature, relative humidity, and fluctuation in stock index were significantly and positively associated with number of nontrauma visits (P < 0.05). Additionally, mean maximum temperature and relative humidity were significantly and positively associated with number of pediatric visits, but mean minimum temperature was significantly and negatively associated with number of pediatric visits (P < 0.05). Table 5 shows that the performance of the ARIMA during validation phase was good to excellent. The validation phase data in Table 5
