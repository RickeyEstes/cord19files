A significant finding was the effect of door position on air exchange rates in outpatient consulting rooms A and B, which was most marked in the former and resulted in a near-doubling of air exchange compared with the closed-door situation. We ascribe this to the presence of a large air return air vent in the corridor immediately adjacent to consulting room A that promoted air movement out of the room. This effect was enhanced under open-door conditions. The number of outdoor ACH was equal to the measured ACH rate multiplied by the proportion of outdoor air supplied. Lung Function Laboratory Figure 1 shows the effect of outdoor air-exchange rate on the infection risk of susceptible individuals occupying the Lung Function Laboratory for 15 minutes and for 45 minutes. For all scenarios, risk decreased rapidly with increasing air exchange. The outdoor airexchange rate in the Lung Function Laboratory (4.9 ACH; shown as the vertical dotted line in the figure) was relatively high and resulted in risks ranging from 0.1% after a 15-minute exposure to rhinovirus to 3.6% after a 45-minute exposure to influenza.
