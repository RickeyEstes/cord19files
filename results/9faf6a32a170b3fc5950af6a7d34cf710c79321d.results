ST6Gal Ι expression in siRNA-transfected A549, HBE, and HEp-2 respiratory epithelial cells Using qPCR assays, we determined there was an 80-90% reduction in ST6GAL1 mRNA expression levels up to 48 h post-transfection ( Figure 1A ,B). Both ST6GAL1-siRNA01 and −02 were more potent than the other siRNA candidates. Their effects were verified using western blot assays. In cells transfected with the selected ST6GAL1 siR-NAs, ST6Gal Ι expression was substantially lower than in those transfected with control siRNAs and untransfected cells ( Figure 1D ). This roughly corresponds to the reduction in mRNA levels as observed by qPCR.
