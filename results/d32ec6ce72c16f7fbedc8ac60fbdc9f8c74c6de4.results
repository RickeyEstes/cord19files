High expression of the CXCL9 gene promotes the pathogenesis of prostate cancer mice. In order to determine whether CXCL9 overexpression affects the pathogenesis of prostate cancer in mice, prostate cancer was induced in C57BL/6 (C57) and B6.Cg-Selplgtm1Fur/J (CXCL9-overexpressed) mice. H&E staining (Fig. 1A) revealed that the prostate cancer pathology of CXCL9-overexpressed mice was significantly greater than C57 mice and CXCL9-overexpressed mice had developed differentiated adenocarcinoma at 20 weeks. The nuclear staining was significantly greater, the ducts were irregular and glandular cavity became smaller (black arrows). At 24 weeks, CXCL9-overexpressed mice exhibited a clear pathology of prostate cancer with a neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype (Fig. 1A) . Therefore, the mice at 24 weeks were selected for subsequent experiments. Immunohistochemical staining (magnification, x400) of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) revealed that proliferation levels in CXCL9+DMAB mice were increased compared with C57+DMAB mice (Fig. 1B) . The aforementioned results suggested that CXCL9 overexpression serves an important role in promoting progression of prostate cancer and accelerates the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. High expression of CXCL9 inhibits T cell activation. As chemokines serve an important role in the tumor microenvironment, it was hypothesized that CXCL9 regulates T cell-mediated immunity. The present study examined the alterations of T cells in peripheral blood and spleen in C57+DMAB mice and CXCL9+DMAB mice. The results showed a reduction in the number of T cells in peripheral blood and spleen of CXCL9+DMAB mice compared with C57+DMAB mice ( Fig. 2A) (Q4 quadrant) . The infiltration number of T cells in tumor tissues was also examined in CXCL9+DMAB mice and C57+DMAB mice. The results suggested that high expression of CXCL9 significantly inhibited T cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment (Fig. 2B) . Based on the above findings, it was hypothesized that CXCL9 may regulate the
