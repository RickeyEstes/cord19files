A total of 2987 testing episodes in 2625 unique patients were identified. Seven were excluded as samples were not processed through the 2-stage pathway appropriately and 4 because results were equivocal, leaving 2976 episodes from 2614 patients in our final analysis. Median age at the time of testing was 45 years (range 0-102 years), 1232 patients (47%) were male, and 520 patients (20%) were less than 18 years old. Specimens were most commonly received from inpatient units (n = 1497) followed by ambulatory clinics (n = 642), the emergency room (n = 602), bedded outpatients (n = 202), employee health (n = 29) and outpatient dialysis (n = 4). 1814 samples were processed during winter via the 2-stage algorithm, compared to 1162 during summer, which underwent FilmArray® only. More than one pathogen was detected in 77 cases throughout the study period. Overall, 1287 (43.2%) tests were positive. Results of the final diagnoses obtained stratified by testing season are shown in Table 1 . Of the 1814 patients tested by the 2-stage algorithm, 321 (17.7%) were diagnosed by Sofia®, with 282 cases of influenza (205 influenza A and 75 influenza B) and 41 of RSV (including 2 patients testing positive for both influenza A and RSV). Results are shown in Fig. 1 . The 1493 patients with a negative Sofia influenza antigen went on to FilmArray®, and of these 580 (38.8%) were positive: 163 for influenza (125 influenza A and 38 influenza B), 87 for RSV (including 5 patients with influenza and RSV), 331 for another virus and 4 for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Overall, 37% (163/445) of patients diagnosed with influenza tested negative by Sofia®. Sofia® testing for RSV was performed in 363 patients (all children b5 years old and on request in others), and 28% of these (16/57) were Sofia® negative but FilmArray® RSV positive. An additional 71 cases of RSV were diagnosed amongst patients who did not have Sofia®-RSV antigen testing performed, 5 of whom were also positive for influenza. Negative predictive values (averaging prevalence across the whole period of testing) were 89.4% (1369/1532) for influenza and 95% (306/322) for RSV. Specimen collection times were available for 2454 samples, 1505 of which were tested during winter and 949 during summer. Kaplan-Meier curves comparing these two time periods are shown in Fig. 2(a) . While the two curves look similar overall, there were a significantly higher proportion of final test results available in less than 90 minutes in the winter compared to the summer, due to the use of the faster antigen test during that season (11.1% versus 3.4%, odds ratio 3.58, 95% confidence interval 2.46-5.36, P b 0.001). This corresponded to 144 cases of influenza and 21 cases of RSV in which a diagnosis was made in less than 90 minutes. A comparison of the time to result by test type in only the 1505 patients tested using the 2-stage algorithm is shown in Fig. 2(b) . Median time to result was 1.12 hours (interquartile range, IQR 0.78-1.73 hours) if Sofia® was positive, compared to 3.46 hours (IQR 2.53-6.00 hours) if patients went on to have a FilmArray® (P b 0.001). Based on costs of these individual tests in our laboratory, if FilmArray® alone had been performed on all samples, the total cost over the influenza season would have been an additional $36,353. Instead, FilmArray® was avoided in all those patients positive for a respiratory virus by the less expensive Sofia® test.
