In present study 40 patients were registered, of which only 37 participants completed the study. The sociodemographic profile of the participants shows that 57.5% (23) were male and the rest 42.5% (17) were females. The age groups of 5e6, 7e8, and 9e10 years consisted of 18 (45%), 27.5% (11), 27.5% (11) participants, respectively. The majority (90%, 36) of the participants belonged to the Hindu religion. Socioeconomic assessment revealed that 37.5% belonged to the lower-middle class followed by 30% in the uppermiddle class strata. Prakriti (genetic phenotype) yielded the majority 87.5% (35) were having Pitta-Kapha Prakriti. A mixed diet was consumed by 80% (32) of the participants. Sleep patterns showed the 60% (24 participants) slept for around 10 hours/day but 62.5% (25) had disturbed sleep, while 37.5% (15) had normal sleep. The family history of the participants highlighted that 25% (10) had a positive family history of chronic tonsillitis. Duration of tonsillitis revealed that 27.5% (11) participants had a duration of tonsillitis for a period of 3 years or more, 17.5% (7) had a duration of tonsillitis for a period of 2 years or more and 55% (22) had a duration of onset of tonsillitis for a period of 1 year or less. Poor oral hygiene was observed among 67.5% (27) participants and only 10% (4) had good oral hygiene. Chief complaints reported were throat pain among 10% (4) patients, difficulty in deglutition in 17.5% (7) patients, halitosis in 12.5% (5) patients, fever in 10% (4) patients, breathing difficulty among 20% (8) patients (16.66%) with complaints of mouth breathing in 22.5% (9) patients. Only 5% (2) reported having Jugulodigastric lymphadenopathy and 2.5% (1) having enlarged tonsils. Clinical diagnosis revealed 62.5% (25) patients with chronic parenchymatous tonsillitis, 32.5% (13) patients with chronic follicular tonsillitis and only 5% (2) were diagnosed as chronic fibroid tonsillitis. Within the group (Wilcoxon signed ranks test) statistical significance (p < 0.05) on signs and symptoms of chronic tonsillitis was found for KR intervention, but nothing significant was observed with Godhuma Vati intervention (Table 1) . However, between groups (Mann Whitney U test), the effects of KR on signs and symptoms of chronic tonsillitis was found to be significant (p < 0.05; Table 2 ). Routine laboratory blood investigations assessed within the KR (study group) showed statistical significance (p < 0.05) on Hb%, TLC, lymphocytes and ESR, whereas Godhuma Vati (placebo) were nonsignificant ( Table 3 ). The comparisons on the effect of KR (study group) and Godhuma Vati (placebo group) on laboratory investigations and fever were nonsignificant (p > 0.05) as detailed in Table 4 .
