During the period 2001 to 2012, the number of inpatients discharged from public hospitals increased steadily by 1.48% per annum, from 607 000 to 714 000. An exception was found in 2003, in which a large reduction was recorded. This was due to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), when many of the hospital services for the community were disrupted. People avoided going to hospital for fear of contracting SARS in the hospital during the outbreak in the first half of 2003. However, we note that the number of hospital beds in HA hospitals decreased by 7.97% between 2002 and 2012. 34 As reported by HA, the total hospitalisation days of inpatient discharges and deaths in public hospitals decreased greatly, from 9.46 million in 2001 to 7.66 million in 2004 ( Figure 1) . During the decreasing period, total hospitalisation days decreased by 599 718 days per annum on average, representing an annual reduction rate of 6.79%. Decomposition analysis showed that the decrease in LOS, the change in the number of discharges per patient, and the decreased discharge rate in almost all age-gender groups contributed to 63.86%, 8.14%, and 57.88% of the reduction, respectively. By contrast, growth in population size and the change in population structure would contribute an increase to total hospitalisation days of 29 254 and 149 933 days per annum, respectively, representing Figure 2 visualises the projected increase of total hospitalisation days in the future, assuming stable hospital discharge patterns (ie, base scenario). The projected numbers are presented on an accumulating basis from 2012. Over the next few years, total hospitalisation days are expected to increase steadily. However, the contribution of an ageing population will become larger from 2022 onwards. Total hospitalisation days in 2022 are projected to increase by 1 021 592 days contributed to by population ageing, and 631 544 days due to population growth -a total of 20.14% increase from 2012. Between 2012 and 2041, population ageing is predicted to contribute to an increase in total hospitalisation days of 4.99 million (60.77%), and the growth in population size contributes to another 1.57 million (19.10%). In addition, even if the discharge patterns remain unchanged at age-gender group level, the overall hospital discharge rate would still increase by 34.42% due to a large older adult population in 2041. Simply increasing the number of hospital beds is insufficient to cope with expansion at such a rate. Results from the scenario analysis are summarised in Table  3 . Scenario 1 assumed that LOS would further decrease by 5% at every age-gender group in 2041 through service improvement. It would decrease the total projected days by 738 371 and the reduced LOS would contribute to a 568 667 days decrease. The same reduction would be obtained in scenarios 2 and 3, which assumed the same percentage of decrease in the number of discharge episodes per patient and hospital discharge rate, respectively. This was an expected result, as total hospitalisation days was a multiplication of the five components. Scenarios 7 to 9 applied a 10% decrease in each of the three service components to individuals aged 45 and above, who will account for 56% of the total population in 2041. These scenarios reflected future interventions that would mainly target middle-aged group and older adults. Focusing on this 56.26% of the population would bring about 87% of the effect in scenarios 4-6. In all scenarios, change in population age-gender structure would remain a significant factor in driving up total hospitalisation days. We might still restrain this enormous increase by introducing multiple measures that bring large reductions in all three service components (scenario 10).
