In the first group, all nine untreated kids showed persistent diarrhea from day 6 to day 13. Cryptosporidial oocyst output peaked at days 7 and 10, all animals having an oocyst score above 2 at some point (Table 1) . Five kids died between day 10 and day 13. At day 17, three of the four remaining kids maintained a low oocyst excretion. In contrast, medicated kids showed only a transient diarrhea at days 4 and 5; four animals had a low oocyst output ( score 1) from day 9 to day 15 and the five other kids had an oocyst count of zero until day 19. By day 19, all treated animals were negative for cryptosporidial oocyst output and no mortality was recorded. Between day 2 and day 10 the mean daily body weight gain of control kids was impaired compared with medicated kids (30 g vs. 80 g) but the difference was not statistically significant. In the second group, neither control nor medicated kids showed persistent diarrhea. The patterns of oocyst excretion and mortality in the control kids of the second trial were similar to those in the first group, with an output peak on day 7 and two mortalities on day 11 (Table 2 ). Only three out of seven medicated kids had oocyst excretion (score 1) and one died at the end of the survey (day 15). The growth of control kids was inferior to that of medicated kids throughout the study (mean daily body weight gain days 2-10, 100 g vs. 180 g), but the difference was not significant. The eight kids that died during the two trials were necropsied. Except for the medicated kid from the second trial, all animals showed a distension of small and large intestines by Table 2 Comparison of cryptosporidial oocyst shedding score in treated ( paromomycin from day 2 to day 13 of age) and untreated kids; trial 2
