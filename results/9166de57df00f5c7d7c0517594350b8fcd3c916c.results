Conclusions: Genotype D is the most common in the area of Northern Greece. The M204V/I mutation is the most frequent among genotypes D and A. Although the appearance of mutants seems to have no correlation with HBV genotypes and viral load, the type of change is propably relayed. The test was conducted to find infection of Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and the genotypes against twenty-six of the patients with fatigue and nausea. Fifteen isolates (57.7%) were amplified by RT-PCR using HAV specific primer, and then compared to 168 bp nucleic acid sequences in VP1/2A junction region for the genotypes. Based on 79% similarity, 13 out of 14 isolates were clustered with genotype IA and 1 out of 14 isolate was separated to IIIA. Above 13 isolates found in genotype IA were sporadic to Japan, China, and Korean strains which are grouped determined by it's geographic region with over 95% similarity. The history of patients informed the high relationship of endemic or family transmission, and it also showed the changes according to risk age group followed by the economic growth as 14~46 years-old patients.
