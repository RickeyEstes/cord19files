A total of 5065 individuals (625 children and 4440 adults) were screened for MERS-CoV during the 12-month period: hospitalized patients with suspected MERS-CoV infection (n = 2908, 57.4%), HCW contacts (n = 1695; 33.5%), and family contacts of laboratory-confirmed MERS cases (n = 462; 9.1%) (Fig. 1 ). There were 108 cases (99 adults and nine children) of MERS-CoV infection detected during the 12month period (108/5065, 2% case detection rate) ( Table 1) . Of 108 MERS cases, 45 were females (six children and 39 adults) and 63 were males (three children and 60 adults). Of the 99 adults with MERS-CoV infection, 70 were hospitalized patients, 19 were HCW contacts, and ten were family contacts. Of the nine children with MERS-CoV infection, two were hospitalized patients and seven were family contacts. A significant increase in the number of screened and tested specimens was evident over the study period (Fig. 2a) , but there were no significant increases in MERS-CoV detection rates over the 12-month period (Fig. 2b)
