TGEV neutralization by MAbs . The majority of TGEV was neutralized (Fig . 1 ) by individual murine MAbs in the first 2-3 min of the reaction, following an exponential decline in surviving virus, which was followed by a second-phase reaction with a decreased rate of neutralization, leaving in some cases a persistent fraction that remained constant after 2 hr of incubation (results not shown) . The extent of neutralization in the first minutes of the reaction was similar to that obtained ( Fig . 1 ) when the virus adsorption period was reduced to 5 min . Extent of virus neutralization was a function of the MAb (Fig . 1A ) and, for each MAb, it was related to its concentration ( Fig . 1 B) . Culture supernatants containing MAb I E .F9 neutralized virus infectivity 100-fold, while 10 -' or 10 -3 dilutions of this MAb reduced infectivity 10-fold or virtually not at all, respectively . Neutralization of TGEV by MAbs was reversed between 1 023 and 10 6 '-fold (Table 2 ) by diluting the virus-antibody complexes and incubating to allow their dissociation, which indicates that TGEV neutralization is a reversible process . Characterization of TGEV and of 11 mar mutants derived from it, by RIA and neutralization using MAbs (Fig .  2) , showed that some MAbs (for example, MAb 1 B .C1) that bound and neutralized the original strain of TGEV also bound, but did not neutralize, the mar mutants, indicating that neutralization requires more than simple binding of the antibody to the critical epitope . To determine if MAbs specific for the different antigenic subsites involved in TGEV neutralization cooperated in this process, inactivation by all possible binary combinations of saturating amounts of six MAbs, which bind to three antigenic subsites (subsite Aa : MAbs 1G .A6, 1C .C12, and 1B .C1 ; subsite Ab : MAb 1D .E8 ; subsite Ac : MAbs 1A .F10 and 6A .C3) was studied . The neutralization by any pair of MAbs tested resulted in a nonsignificant cooperation . In contrast, when site A-specific MAbs (1G .A7, 1B .C1, 1D .E8, 1A .F10, and 6A .C3) were combined with MAb 5G1 specific for a site different from site A (R . Woods, R . Wesley, and L . Enjuanes, unpublished results), a synergistic effect was observed, which produced an increase of 2 in the NJ above the NI obtained with the best neutralizing MAb individually used (results not shown) . was saturable, reaching a plateau 90-120 min afterthe reaction was started ( Fig . 3A ), when free virus was still available . The binding was specific, as it was inhibited up to 90% by a 40-fold excess of unlabeled virus, butÂ°
