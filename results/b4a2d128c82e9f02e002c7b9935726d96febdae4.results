Initially, patients of all ages were entered into the study at both morning and evening surgeries. However, because of incompleteness of data (no pulmonary function tests in patients under 12-years-old, and no presentation pulmonary function for evening surgery patients), the paper describes the results of patients aged 12 years or over referred for study from the morning surgery only. During the study period, forty-two episodes were investigated in 40 such patients. Thirty patients attended both follow-up appointments, four attended one only and 6 did not attend either follow-up appointments, an overall re-attendance rate of 81%.
