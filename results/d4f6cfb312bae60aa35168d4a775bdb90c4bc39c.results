During the 12-month study period, there were 37 059 admissions to the ER (24 189 adults and 12 870 children), of which 11 953 (32Á3%) presented with respiratory symptoms. The most common symptoms were cough (73Á4%), fever (56Á1%), dyspnea (40Á9%), chest pain (24Á5%), and coryza (20Á9%). The median duration of symptoms before admission was 3 days (IQR: 1-6 days). A total of 2205 (18Á5%) patients admitted to ER needed to be hospitalized; of these patients, 242 (2Á0%) required ICU admission. ILI and SARI were diagnosed in 3698 (30Á9%) and 2063 (17Á7%) patients, respectively. The overall mortality rate among all study participants was 280 of 11 953 (2Á3%). Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 . According to the selection criteria of the study, 425 patients met the inclusion criteria and were invited to participate, and 15 patients declined to participate. Then, 410 adults were enrolled for virological investigation, 255 in the first year and 155 in the second one. There were no differences in age, sex, race, years of schooling, and symptoms between selected sample and all adults admitted to the ER in the same period. However, as expected, the median duration of symptoms was lower in the selected Seven samples considered to be unsatisfactory for IFI were positive by PCR. Another 50 samples that were negative in IFI were positive by PCR. Of the 37 samples positive in IFI, 18 were sent for PCR too, and in nine, the result was positive. In seven of these cases, the results of IFI and PCR were concordant. In one patient, adenovirus was identified on IFI and influenza A was found in PCR. In another case, IFI detected PIV type 2, and PCR identified PIV types 1 and 3. The characteristics of patients with PCR positive and negative were shown in Table 3 . Figure 1 shows timesseries graph for virus percent positive by IFI and by PCR by month. Table 4 shows the descriptive statistics corresponding to the environmental variables considered in this study. Figure 2 shows the modeled and observed values for ILI and SARI cases. Figures 3 and 4 show the daily number of patients with ILI and SARI and meteorological parameters. We checked the autocorrelation between the covariates of climate data and observations from previous days, and we considered the following lags (in days) for each variable: average temperature (5), rainfall (2), sunshine duration (6), relative humidity (5), mean concentration of pollutants (3), and absolute humidity (2) . The number of ILI and SARI cases tends to be higher between July 5, 2009, and August 22, 2009 . In this period, the mean temperatures (Tmin: 9Á52 AE 3Á89°C and Tmax: 18Á9 AE 4Á92°C) and the sunshine duration (4Á13 AE 3Á31 hours of sun per day) were lower, as expected in winter. The rainfall tends to be higher than the median calculated for the entire year (0 mm, IQR: 0-5Á4 mm). In addition, the absolute humidity (AH; 7Á8 AE 2Á1 g/kg) and mean concentration of pollutants (20Á0 AE 7Á0 lm/m 3 ) were lower in this period compared with the annual values. Table 5 shows multivariate logistic regression model for IFI and PCR. We included 255 patients in logistic regression for IFI and 180 patients in logistic regression for PCR, because we have climate data only for the first year of study. IFI positivity was statistically associated with AH (OR: 0Á72; 95% CI 0Á59-0Á86), use of air conditioning (OR: 4Á16; 95% CI 1Á45-11Á83), and presence of mold in home (OR: 2Á95; 95% CI 1Á10-8Á29). On the other hand, PCR positivity was statistically associated with use of air conditioning (OR: 2Á27; 95% CI 1Á04-4Á97), average temperature (OR: 0Á92; 95% CI 0Á86-0Á98), and mean concentration of pollutants (OR: 1Á04; 95% CI 1Á00-1Á08). The multivariate time-series models for ILI and SARI cases are summarized in Table 6 . Sunshine duration was the only independent covariate that was significantly associated with the frequency of ILI cases. The b-coefficient for this parameter was negative, indicating increasing ILI frequency with decreasing sunshine duration. In the model for SARI cases, the following variables proved to be significant: mean temperature (b = 0Á399; P = 0Á025), sunshine duration (b = À0Á392; P = 0Á007), RH (b = À0Á098; P = 0Á05), and mean concentration of pollutants (b = À0Á079; P = 0Á018).
