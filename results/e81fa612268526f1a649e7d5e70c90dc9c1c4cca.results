There were 340 sellers and 221 middlemen interviewed in 30 Vietnamese LBMs, and 54 sellers and 30 middlemen in 8 Cambodian LBMs. The refusal rate was 8% among Vietnamese traders, with the principal reason being that they were too busy to participate. In Cambodia, only 2 (2%) people declined interviews. LBM features are described in Table 2 . LBMs in Bac Giang province in Viet Nam were either open every day (n = 4) or periodically (n = 5). Periodic markets were open 6 or 12 days per month. LBMs in Ha Noi province were grouped as either retail and mixed markets (n = 17), hosting from 2 to 13 sellers, or wholesale markets (n = 4), which were the largest markets, hosting from 30 to 80 sellers. Cambodian LBMs were grouped as either urban markets (n = 4), located in Phnom Penh or its close proximity, or peri-urban markets (n = 4), in other provinces. Urban markets were open throughout the day for 12-15 hours, whereas peri-urban markets were only open in the morning for 6 hours or less. Most Vietnamese (80%, n = 340) and Cambodian (70%, n = 54) sellers reported having a surplus, at least occasionally. In contrast, most middlemen reported never having a surplus (Viet Nam: 76%, n = 221; Cambodia: 97%, n = 30). As they generally spent less than 1 hour in a LBM, middlemen kept their poultry in LBMs for only a very short time and were therefore excluded from the multivariate analysis. Following the FAMD and the HCA, Vietnamese sellers were divided into 4 clusters and Cambodian sellers into 2 clusters. Tables 3 and 4 present the distribution of poultry management and contact features for each seller profile in Viet Nam and Cambodia, respectively. A description of the factors is provided in Text S1. Vietnamese sellers in Cluster V.1 were farmers or occasional sellers. Most farmers' flocks consisted of 50-500 birds and were located in the market vicinity. They were characterized by an infrequent and short presence at market and a very low number of sales. Encompassing 48% (n = 340) of Vietnamese sellers, Cluster V.2 was composed of sellers trading larger volumes and more frequently than Cluster V.1 sellers. However, they spent little time in LBMs, with 60% (n = 162) only trading 4 hours or less per day. Their surpluses were also low, with the median frequency of having a surplus being 14% and the median proportion of unsold chickens and ducks being 10% and 6%, respectively. Cluster V.3 was also composed of regular sellers. Although their number of sales was slightly lower than Cluster V.2 sellers, they reported higher surpluses than traders in other clusters. The proportion of traders reporting a surplus every day was 51% (n = 71), and the median proportion of unsold chickens and ducks was 32% and 17%, respectively. Moreover, 45% (n = 71) of Cluster V.3 sellers were not supplied every day and 66% (n = 71) purchased birds the day before offering them for sale, keeping them overnight at home. These proportions were higher than in other clusters. For traders who were not supplied every day when operating at a market, part of the newly purchased birds were stored at home for 1 to several days before bringing them to market. Cluster V.4 included sellers spending more time at market, with 64% (n = 64) trading at least 10 hours per day, and selling substantially more poultry than other clusters. However, the median surplus frequency of 29% and the median proportion of unsold birds, less than 10% for chickens and ducks, were much lower than those reported by Cluster V.3 sellers. Except for Cluster V.1, most Vietnamese sellers were supplied by farms, the majority of which were small commercial farms (50-500 birds). Cluster V.2 and V.3 sellers were also supplied by backyard farms (,50 birds), whilst Cluster V.4 sellers were also supplied by large farms (.500 birds). The number of sellers visiting several markets to purchase or sell poultry was higher in Cluster V.2 (48%, n = 162) than in Clusters V.3 (38%, n = 71) and V.4 (3%, n = 64). Whilst the proportion of Cluster V.2 sellers was high in all market groups, 74% (n = 43) Cluster V.1 sellers were found in Bac Giang markets, 80% (n = 71) Cluster V.3 sellers were in Ha Noi retail and mixed markets and 95% (n = 64) Cluster V.4 sellers were in Ha Noi wholesale markets. All Bac Giang markets were strictly or predominantly populated by Cluster V.1 or V.2 sellers, or both (Fig. 2) . Cluster V.3 was the only, or the predominant, seller profile in 13 of the 17 Ha Noi retail and mixed markets. This seller profile was, however, absent in 2 markets located in peri-urban areas, far from the main urban centres. Contrary to other market groups, Ha Noi wholesale markets were highly heterogeneous in terms of seller composition. However, when considering the proportion of poultry traded by each seller profile in each market (Fig. S1 ), largescale sellers (Cluster V.4) were predominant in all Ha Noi wholesale markets but 1. The market location was, therefore, a good predictor of the seller composition. Cambodian sellers were classified into 2 clusters. Cluster C.1 sellers spent little time in LBMs and either rarely, or never, had a surplus. In contrast, most Cluster C.2 sellers spent all day in LBMs and reported high surpluses. The median length of time spent in LBMs was 4 hours for Cluster C.1, and 11 hours for Cluster C.2 sellers. Most Cluster C.1 sellers (58%, n = 26) never had any unsold poultry at the end of the market day, whereas all Cluster C.2 sellers but 1 reported surpluses. Whilst most Cluster C.1 sellers were supplied by farmers, most Cluster C.2 sellers were supplied by traders. Contrary to Viet Nam, all supplying farms were backyard farms (,50 birds), and none of the Cambodian sellers visited other markets to buy or sell poultry. Cambodian seller profiles were also associated with market groups, with 85% (n = 26) Cluster C.1 sellers operating in periurban markets and 86% (n = 28) Cluster C.2 sellers operating in urban markets. Three of 4 peri-urban markets were exclusively populated by Cluster C.1 sellers, and Cluster C.2 predominated in 3 of 4 urban markets. Chicken sales peaked in Viet Nam and Cambodia during the Tet and the Chinese New Year (late January or early February), respectively, with 72% (n = 340) and 96% (n = 54) sellers reporting an increase in chicken sales by 100% on average. Likewise, the number of sellers operating at markets increased. Sellers did not report any other changes in their practices during these periods.
