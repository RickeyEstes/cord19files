Among 82 adult Hajj pilgrims who attended a travel medicine and international vaccination consultation to receive meningococcal vaccination during the study period, no eligible pilgrim refused to participate. The mean age was 54.8 ± 14.5 years; 53% were women. A large majority of the pilgrims (89%) were able to understand French. Sixty-eight percent did not have a high level of education. The responses to the questionnaire before and after receiving information about MERS-CoV are reported in Table 1 . At the time they completed the first questionnaire, only 32% of pilgrims namely know MERS-CoV disease, and 52% of them know the geographical area at risk. More than 50% of them were aware of the contagiousness and severity of the illness. In contrast, pilgrims had poor knowledge of the routes of transmission (4%), the symptoms (7%) and the preventive behaviours to adopt either abroad (22%), in case of fever (17%) and after return (11%). Pilgrims had a higher rate of correct responses on each question at the time they completed the second questionnaire, as compared with the first, with 11 of 13 questions answered significantly better after delivery of educational information about MERS-CoV. However, although the rate of correct answers to the questions about routes of transmission, symptoms, preventive behaviours to adopt in case of fever and time delay between return and potential MERS-CoV occurrence increased significantly after receiving the information, the rates remained below 50%. The absence of available vaccine or specific treatment was also poorly known, with only 23% and 24% of correct answers, respectively, increasing to 76% and 67%, respectively, after the delivery of information. Finally, the rates of correct answers differ according to the level of education (having high level of education, yes versus no). For the first questionnaire, pilgrims with a high level of education (n ¼ 23) had significantly more correct answers for 3 questions: Is it contagious? (70 vs 42%; P ¼ 0.03) Is it a serious disease? (78 vs 52%; P ¼ 0.03) and Is this disease respiratory, cardiac or genetic? (70 vs 44%; P ¼ 0.04). For the second questionnaire, the pilgrims with a high level of education had more correct answers for only one question: On your return: No special measures required; I must take precautions for the period during which I could develop disease symptoms; I can develop the disease 2 weeks after my return? 2 months after my return? (57 versus 20%; P ¼ 0.002).
