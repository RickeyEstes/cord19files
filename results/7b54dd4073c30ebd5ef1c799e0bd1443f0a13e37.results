The number of inpatients dramatically dropped during the MERS outbreak period and was significantly lower than the non-outbreak period (20,790 vs 51,510 PD per month; P < .001). The antibiotic use per inpatient increased during the outbreak period. After the outbreak, inpatient numbers recovered rapidly from August 2015, and the number of inpatients and antibiotic prescriptions were not different between the post-outbreak and non-outbreak periods. Overall trends of pathogen isolations and MDRO proportions are presented in Figure 1 , and comparisons between each period are presented in Supplementary Table S1 . Isolations of S aureus and MRSA decreased during the post-outbreak period, but it was not statistically significant compared with the non-outbreak period. Isolations of both Enterococcus spp (179.34 vs 306.26 per 10 3 PD; P = .045) and VRE (50.09 vs 160.60 per 10 3 PD; P = .010) significantly decreased during the post-outbreak period. The proportion of VRE among total Enterococcus spp isolates also significantly decreased (27.52 vs 53.06%; P = .028). These significant reductions were associated with disinfected wards/intensive care units (ICUs) (97.80 vs 202.81 per 10 3 PD; P = .025 for Enterococcus spp; 30.13 vs 85.24 per 10 3 PD; P = .047 for VRE). Isolations of Enterobacteriaceae, third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and CRE did not decrease during the post-outbreak period. Decreased isolations of Pseudomonas spp and CRP decreased during the post-outbreak period were observed without statistical significance. Isolations of Acinetobacter spp and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter did not decrease during the post-outbreak period.
